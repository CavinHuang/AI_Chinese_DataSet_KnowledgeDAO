["Q: How can I view recently added songs in iTunes grouped by Album like the Songs view does? I have just added 6 albums worth of downloaded music to my iTunes library. I know that some of the files will not be identified as the same album by iTunes because of different Album Artist metadata, and some of the tracks will be missing track or disc numbers. These problems are easiest to see in the Songs view, where I can see one album split in half, then select all of the offending songs and apply the 'Compilation' flag or correct the missing metadata. However, the only way I can find to filter my view down to just the newly added tracks is using the Recently Added smart playlist, which does not give me a preview of the Songs view's album grouping behavior.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, in the 'music' section, sort by date added, select the six albums worth of songs and create a New Playlist from Selection (Cmd-Shft-N, or right-click on selection). From that playlist, you should have the view you want.\n", "Q: Mail keeps setting \"Save drafts on the server\" checked I open \"Preferences\" in Mail, uncheck \"Store drafts on server\" and save (Gmail account). However, when I open the preferences again, the \"Store drafts on server\" (or whatever it says in English version) is checked again.\nIt really pisses me off. How can turn it off permanently?\nI use OS X Mavericks.\n\nA: Another good option that fixed the problem for me is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail.app.\n\n*Log into Gmail in your favorite web browser.\n\n*Click on the gear menu and select Settings.\n\n*Click on the Labels tab.\n\n*Under System Labels, next to Drafts, click on show if unread and uncheck the Show in IMAP box. Now disable Store draft messages on the server.\n\n*Launch Mail.app.\n\n*Select Mail → Preferences…\n\n*Click on the Accounts button in the toolbar.\n\n*Click once on the account name and then click the Mailbox Behaviors tab.\n\n*Uncheck the Store draft messages on the server box.\n\n*Close the window and opt to save your changes when prompted.\n\n\nSource: Apple Support Communities: Mavericks Mail app and Gmail Drafts folder\n\nA: Are you using Mavericks? This is probably related to the MANY Gmail related problems that have cropped up since it's release. \nYou are in luck though, as Apple has just released an update to solve many of said problems.\nhttp://www.macrumors.com/2013/11/07/apple-releases-mail-update-for-mavericks-to-address-gmail-issues/\n", "Q: How to logout another user in 10.8? With 10.6 I used to kill the process loginwindow to logout another user, but with 10.8 I noticed that even if I do so, many processes from that user stay active.\nSo, is there a way to logout another user in 10.8, other than logging him in or manually killing all his processes?\n\nA: As an administrator:\nsudo su - user_to_be_logged_out\nkill -9 -1\n\nThat will log out any user by ending all of the user processes. Use care to not issue the kill -9 -1 as root else some work would be expected to be lost as the system would immediately self-destroy all processes.\nThere are of course one line commands, but I like having a pause to look and make sure I switched to the correct user before issuing a powerful command like kill -9 -1 and I also avoid at all costs having sudo appear before that kill since I don't even want to kill all processes as root.\n\nA: Like bmike mentioned but combining the commands into an alias that can be used in /bin/tcsh shell. Again this is nice and fast but be careful. Don’t do this on root or yourself.\nalias ku \"sudo su user_to_be_logged_out -c 'kill -9 -1'\"\n\n", "Q: Who installed this Emacs? I have:\n$ /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --version\nGNU Emacs 24.3.1\n$ /usr/bin/emacs --version\nGNU Emacs 22.1.1\n\nHow do I get rid of the second installation of Emacs?\n\nA: The second emacs came with OS X.  For files that are logged in the package database, you can use pkgutil:\n$ pkgutil --file-info /usr/bin/emacs\nvolume: /\npath: /usr/bin/emacs\n\npkgid: com.apple.pkg.BSD\npkg-version: 10.9.0.1.1.1306847324\ninstall-time: 1382483268\nuid: 0\ngid: 0\nmode: 555\n\nA list of packages can be obtained via pkgutil --packages.  However, note that—again—this only covers items in the package database.\nYou should not modify items that are part of the core operating system.  If you prefer a locally-installed program to override one that came with the operating system, you should adjust your PATH to prefer that program before system paths such as /usr/bin are checked.\nOne way to do this is to have /usr/local/bin be first in your path and link your /Applications version of emacs to /usr/local/bin so that it will be called first unless a program explicitly calls /usr/bin/emacs\n\nA: The file /usr/bin/emacs is installed as part of Mac OS X. It is generally not a good idea to change or modify files that are installed as part of the default OS installation; other programs can rely on their presence.\nUtilities installed as part of the operating system can be invoked by other programs with the expectation that the version installed will match the operating system spec. Removing them or replacing them with a different version could cause other programs to fail to operate as designed.\n", "Q: How to send the entire iMessage conversation to a friend? App to take a screenshot of the whole conversation? Is there an app for that? I want to send the entire iMessage conversation to a friend, organized, so he can understand the conversation. Not just the text in there. Is there a way to do that?\n\nA: There is likely a log of all your chat history in Library->Messages. If you open the .ichat file in iMessage then it will come up in the standard chat format.\n\nA: If you copy and paste from Messages, it is organized by who typed each message. \n", "Q: Best practises for battery/charging MBPr I have purchased my first macbook recently and would like to know what are the best practises for keeping the battery in good condition.\n\nA: Apple provides a number of recommendations for MacBook batteries at their battery information page.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html\n\nThere are a number of tips that Apple provides for maximising the lifespan of your battery on this page, summarised below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you plug in your battery and let it charge fully for the first time.\n\nBe sure to fully charge your portable when you plug it in for the first time, and then run Software Update to ensure you have the latest software. Apple periodically releases updates that may improve battery performance.\n\n\n*If possible, don't leave your battery on charge all the time.\n\nFor proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time.\n\n\n*Charge/discharge at least once a month.\n\nApple recommends charging and discharging its battery at least once per month. Need a reminder? Add an event to your desktop’s iCal.\n\n\n*Don't store a flat battery for a long period of time.\n\nIf you don’t plan on using your notebook for more than six months, Apple recommends that you store the battery with a 50% charge. If you store a battery when it’s fully discharged, it could fall into a deep discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding any charge.\n\n\n*Don't store a fully-charged battery for a long period of time.\n\nConversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may experience some loss of battery capacity, meaning it will have a shorter life.\n\n", "Q: iPad inbox out of date I have a work email account that uses Zimbra as the backend server. For my iDevices, I set up this account as an exchange account and everything usually works fine. On my laptop, it's set up as IMAP (for some reason I can't set it up as exchange there). \nMy problem is that when I read mail on my MacBook and move it to another mailbox, it doesn't always update the inbox of the iPad. My iPhone seems to be fine though. I'm seeing old mail still in the inbox even after I slide down the message list to \"refresh\". Any ideas?\n\nA: So I went through the settings to see what might have been different. The only thing I noticed was that I was syncing \"unlimited\" emails on my iPad but only a month on my phone. I changed the setting on my iPad and the inbox seems to have cleaned itself up. We'll see if it sticks. I'll mark this as answered tomorrow if it does. \n", "Q: Automatic Window Switcher I'm looking for a Mac app that will accomplish the following:\nSwitch between two full-screen mac apps - Tweetdeck and iCal, automatically on a timed interval. Back and forth without stopping.\nWe have a Mac setup as an office information kiosk. Staff can see quick Twitter updates, then take a look at our shared Exchange calendar in iCal.\nCurrently I am running an Apple Script using the keyboard shortcuts in Lion to scroll left and right between the two full screen apps. This is great, but from time-to-time the script crashes, or scrolls too far to one side. Looking for something robust and simple.\n\nA: If the applications are in different windows, I think you can simply activate them. Save this as a stay open application:\nproperty counter : 0\n\non idle\n    set counter to counter + 1\n    if counter mod 2 = 0 then\n        activate application \"Twitter\"\n    else\n        activate application \"Firefox\"\n    end if\n\n    return 3 -- in seconds\nend idle\n\n", "Q: How do I restore the tab to Increase Indent Level in Keynote '13? As of Keynote '13 for Mavericks, it seems Apple disabled ⇥ Tab to increase indent level (and ⇧ Shift+⇥ Tab to decrease it).\nIs there any way to re-enable this? I tried using the Keyboard Shortcuts control, but you cannot set ⇥ Tab as a keyboard shortcut (it instead just moves you to the next control).\n\nA: After a great deal of testing, I have come to the conclusion that tab works to increase indent, but ONLY if your master slide is configured to have bullets. My solution (since I did not really want bullets on my slides) was to turn on bullets and set the color opacity to 0. \n\nA: I had decimal tabs bult into a text block and when using the Tab key, it pushed lines from the far left.\nHolding the OPTION key don while tabbing makes it work correctly....Bizarre behavior\n\nA: I have this same issue where tabs insert a tab without increasing the indent... and I have to use the indent button to get the bullets feature to behave correctly from the master template. This was confusing me a great deal as bullets weren't working correctly per the master template formatting... until I figured out the issue was with the tab key response. The issue is associated with keynote files updated from 09. I haven't found a solution yet to get the tab working to drive indentation\n", "Q: Can't add a printer on Mavericks I'm trying to use an Epson Workforce 840 over Wifi with Mac OS X 10.9. This Mac has never used the printer before.\nI've tried going through the usual steps but it's not working. My Mac sees the printer over Wifi, and I select it. But the response is that \"The software for this printer is currently unavailable. Please contact the printer’s manufacturer for the latest software.\"\nThen I go to Epson, and they just tell me to do the same thing I just did.\nIf I try to add the printer in System Preferences, it also sees the printer over Wifi, but I get the same result. If I click the \"Add Printer...\" button, choosing \"auto select\" for the driver produces a message reading \"Software for this printer isn't available from Apple. Contact the printer's manufacturer for the latest software.\"\nLather, rinse, repeat.\nBut: I have two Macs running Mavericks, and one of them can use the printer. The one where it works \"inherited\" its printer driver from Mac OS X 10.8, I believe. The one where it doesn't work has never used this printer before.\nHow do I break this loop and get the printer working?\n\nA: I eventually found Apple's instructions for how to reset the Mac OS X printing system. Once I did that, the usual automatic download worked.\n", "Q: Finder sidebar icons gone After a reboot caused by an empty battery, my Finder’s sidebar icons are just gone. I tried a few reboots, re-launching Finder, but I can’t fix it.\n\n\nA: Try resetting Finder by running the following Terminal command:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist && killall Finder\n\nThis will reset all Finder preferences back to default.\n\nA: I just install Mavericks and that's fixed.\n", "Q: Time Machine: exclude folders with same name, now AND in the future I want to exclude backup of proxy media in Final Cut Pro. This media is located in:\n~/Movies/Final Cut Events/[Event Folder]/Transcoded Media/Proxy Media\n\nProblem is, when I create a new [Event Folder] it creates a new directory named \"Proxy Media\" which has to be manually omitted from Time Machine each time. I'd like to automate this process.\nI've looked at tmutil in the command line, but I don't think that will do it.\n\nA: You could save a property list like this as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/excludefinalcut.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>EnableGlobbing</key>\n  <true/> <!-- enable wildcard and tilde expansion for ProgramArguments -->\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>excludefinalcut</string>\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>tmutil</string>\n    <string>addexclusion</string>\n    <string>~/Movies/Final Cut Events/*/Transcoded Media/Proxy Media</string>\n  </array>\n  <key>WatchPaths</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>~/Movies/Final Cut Events</string>\n  </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThen load the plist by running launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/excludefinalcut.plist.\ntmutil addexclusion gives files a com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem extended attribute. sudo tmutil addexclusion -p would add files to the SkipPaths dictionary in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist that is also modified by System Preferences.\n", "Q: Accessing a terminal when an interactive desktop session is unresponsive? On linux distributions one can simply press the following keys in order to access the shell:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+F2\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+F7 to exit and return to the GUI.\n\n\nIs there a similar capability in OS X that would let me access a terminal when my interactive desktop session is no longer responsive?\nIf anyone wants to know why, read below\nI have a reason for needing this, and mainly because I killed the wrong process id, which in term ended the launchd daemon.  As now I couldn't run Terminal.app, or type in my existing shells I needed to gain access of the main shell (my session is running in) which was active because Spotify still worked!  In order to start-up that daemon again to rectify my problem - annoyingly I had to restart which for Unix operating system is ridiculous - ONLY time a linux/unix system need be rebooted is after kernel updates are installed, otherwise it doesn't need to be.\n\nA: There hasn't been a console bypass on OSX since 10.0 days, so it's not so much Apple removed it as the feature never passed review for initial implementation. Having such a bypass is a security risk if anyone with physical access to the machine can simply open a shell with a key press or two.\nHere's what you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can ssh into your OS since it runs sshd like all unix.\n\n*You can use a remote management tool like Apple Remote Desktop to issue remote commands as well.\n\n\nI understand your take on it being a flaw or omission, but it's just not part of the OS X heritage to have a back door to a prompt like linux has implemented.\n\nA: What I do for this:\nEither:\n\n\n*\n\n*LogMeIn - Full desktop, bit of a pain from an iPhone or iPad, but it works from anywhere, not just local network with no necessary port forwarding, etc.\n\n*Enable SSH and use a Terminal from your phone. I use Prompt by Panic on my iPhone, it's a nice client. Not free, there are free ones available too. SSH is enabled from the Sharing option in System Preferences. Check Remote Login.\n\n*VNC - half way between both of the above. Enable VNC on the Mac, and get a VNC client on your phone/iPad/etc.\nI use the console option fairly often to kill off run-away processes, etc.\nFor reference, you can get a console login, but not while a GUI session is active. At the login prompt, if you have it set to type in the username and password, not the selecting from a list option, the username '>console' will take you to a console. Exit takes you back to a login screen. At the console you still need to log in as a user, it's still secure.\n", "Q: How can I forward email as a readable attachment? I'm writing a new email, and in that email I'm referring to a couple of other emails and I want to include them as attachments. When I drag and drop a mail to the mail I'm writing, some icon appears but when I double click on it, it shows plain text with headers, and not a nice formatted mail.\nHow can I attach it properly?\nATTENTION!! I know about \"Mail -> Message -> Forward as Attachment\" but it is not working properly: when I double-click on attached icon, it opens as text (with headers) and not as nice formatted mail. I also know about \"Save as RTF\" - but this is also not a proper solution as headers are lost.\nFor example, when I attach email in Thunderbird or Outlook, it attaches EML file - and when I open it, it is displayed properly (with formatting), and it is also has all headers (but not visible by default).\nOS X 10.9, Mail 7.0 (1816)\n\nA: If you find the message in Library->Mail copy the .emlx file into the email then you will be able to see it nicely in mail (worked for me).\nUnfortunately, the challenge here would be to find the message that you want to send (since the file categories seem arbitrary, at least to me).\n\nA: The only way I have found this to work is to copy (drag) the attachment to the Desktop and rename it from \"Attachment\" to \"Attachment.eml\" and drag it back in again.\nI've never had people tell me they cannot open the \"Attachment.eml\".\n", "Q: The iTunes currently-playing track is blank; how do I get it back? I'm using iTunes 11.1.2 on the Mac. The top center of iTunes has an area that normally shows the currently-playing track (title, artist, album, etc.) with the track time slider. (Apparently this is called the \"scrubber\".)\nAfter a recent Software Update, that area is now empty; it just has the Apple logo. I can't find any way to make the track data and time slider appear again (clicking and right-clicking does nothing, the View menu doesn't have an option for this, etc.).\nHow can I get this to reappear?\n\nA: Apparently a lot of people are seeing this problem.

I'm trying to start using Mavericks tagging system, even though it has its bugs…\nI'm also evaluating Yep to better organize my docs, but maybe I can do without, if I can find how to display all the untagged files in a Finder window via smart folders/saved searches. There's the filter for \"Tag\" (in \"other…\"), but it wants me to write a tag name (or the start/end of it). Is there any way to use a wildcard, or an hidden way to set \"has tags\" as filter?\n(Also, a more intuitive way to view files with two or more tags would be good…)  \n\nA: Ok, I should have taken a look at SuperUser, here's a way to do what AllInOne says without fiddling with XML files (and it's faster).\nSimply create a new smart folder or hit cmd+F, choose \"Raw Query\" from the filters and type kMDItemUserTags != '*' in the field.\n\nA: A simple way to do this in Finder...\nAt the top of the finder window you see the column headers such as \"Name\", \"Size\", \"Kind\" etc like in the picture below.\n\nJust right click on any column header and you can add a column called \"tags\"as seen here.\n\nThen you can sort that column.\n\nA: Create a new Smart Folder where Tags is not foo.  Save your new Smart Folder to your Desktop.\nOpen your \"Smart Folder\" in a text editor.  Yes, they are just XML files!\nGo to line 8.  You will see something that looks like:\n<string>((kMDItemUserTags != \"foo\"cd))</string>\n\nReplace \"foo\" with the wildcard character, like so:\n<string>((kMDItemUserTags != \"*\"cd))</string>\n\nSource\nSave the text file.  \nThere is some kind of caching in saved searches.  We need to overcome this so the Smart Folder will use the new search criteria instead of the old (cached) criteria.  What worked for me was duplicating the Smart Folder.  \nOpen the duplicated folder and you should see all of the non-tagged files and none of the tagged files.\n", "Q: How to Partition hard Drive + install previous OS (10.7.2) on one, while leaving 10.8.4 on other I am having to do this to make my Presonus Firewire 26x26 work since they do not have updated drivers past 10.7\nBought the Macbook Pro in 2009 - it came with Snow Leapord.

I am thinking about giving out iPad Airs to my customers. However, I have some concerns about how to \"gift\" an iPad + 3G.\nDo we have to pay the data for the device or could we make them responsible for the data? Does it require a contract or is it that it's just a normal iPad until they walk to their neighborhood __ store and get a SIM card? Or is it where there is a contract like a phone and we will be billed?\n\nA: All iPads that have cellular data are on a contract-free basis and you only pay for the capability to connect when you buy the iPad from Apple (and presumably all other sellers - even a wireless store).\nThere is no linking of the account that purchased to the SIM cards and you don't need any sort of credit check, subsidy or contract with the iPad Air.\nThe devices in the USA are tied to the carrier that you selected, so if you wanted to let your recipients pick the model they wanted, just buy them an Apple Store gift card (which is very different than an iTunes or App Store gift card) so that they can purchase the appropriate model. The only down side is they may choose to use the gift for other purposes so you might want to poll them to their preferred carrier or let them haggle a closed box return / exchange with Apple or someone on the street with cash seeking an iPad.\n", "Q: Filesystem not showing correct size I installed a new HDD and transferred my old data to it by using dd on my old HDD and then dd again to the new HDD.

I used it all day, until it died. Once I got home, I plugged it into the charger, and now it's stuck on the boot loop again. When the iPhone booted normally, iTunes allowed me to put files on it, etc. I have already tried RecBoot, and iTunes won't let me sync.\n\nA: If your iPhone is stuck in recovery mode, DO THIS: (ON Screen USB pointing to a CD with a Music Note).\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your iTunes is up to data, if not re-download itunes.\n\n*after re-installing ITUNES, plug your iphone via USB into your computer. ITUNES will automatically pick it up and a pop up box will probally say that your IPHONE is in recovery mode would you like to restore?\n\n*Click the restore tab.\nNote - If ITUNES if out of date, this will not work.\nNote - Do not do this over WIFI\nNote - Do not interrupt the restore\nNote - If you did not make a previous back up, your IPHONE will restore back to the factroy settings.  \nAll this happened to me, fortunately I made a back up. I hope this helps.\n\nA: If you're able to have iTunes recognize the phone and are able to attempt to do a restore, you can use redsn0w to modify a download of the current iOS firmware version (the version you have on the phone) to create a new firmware file whose purpose is just to boot up the phone in DFU mode (without the having to use the power/sleep and home buttons).\nThe entire process is described in this tutorial by iClarified - How to Enter DFU Mode With a Broken Home or Power Button (it's for Windows, but it's the same process on OS X).\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest version of redsn0w for your OS (OS X or Windows)\n\n*Download the right firmware for your current iOS version for the iPhone 4 from Apple through the direct links on this iOS firmware download page\n\n*Extract the redsn0w zip file and run the redsn0w application\n\n*Click the Extras button in the main window\n\n*Click the Even More button in the Extras window\n\n*Click DFU IPSW\n\n*Acknowledge the dialog that describes that this is for devices with broken buttons\n\n*Choose the firmware file you downloaded earlier from Apple\n\n*redsn0w will let you know once it's done creating a new firmware file for DFU mode (the name would start with ENTER_DFU)\n\n*Connect your device with iTunes open and in the Summary view, click Restore while holding Option (on OS X) or Shift (on Windows)\n\n*When iTunes prompts you to choose the firmware, select the ENTER_DFU firmware file\n\n*Once the device is restored, it will be in DFU mode\n\n\nA: Download and install Recboot. This will often let you put the phone in recovery mode. here is the link http://sebby.net/recboot-mac/recboot_2_2.zip\n", "Q: No speaker sound in ios7 on iPhone 4s Recently I received a refurbished iPhone 4s running ios 7.  The speaker sound does not work in some applications.  For example videos from the Photos app play no sound.  However, the ringtone works.  Keyboard sounds do not work.  The music app does not emit sound either.\nI have tried power cycling, updating applications, calling the phone and restoring from backup.  \nCalling the phone seemed to help as audio returned, but then the same problem resumed about a day later.\nEDIT 1: This problem is intermittent.  For example when unlocking the first two keys make sound but the third and fourth do not.  It does not always fail in this pattern.  One moment the sound may be working on youtube, and go silent the next.  There does not seem to be any pattern to the failures.\nWhat can be done to fix this?\n\nA: i had exactly the same issue. Cleaned the charging socket + the earphone entrance.  Voila!  it was working again\n\nA: I had a similar problem…\n\n\n*\n\n*I had no sound playing on phone speaker from any application / music, but the phone rings and I can talk to other parties and rasise and lower the volume with the buttons\n\n*The volume + and - buttons had no effect and I had no control over rasing or lowering volume in a phone idle situation, or within any application except when in setting mode under sound while selecting a tone — the selected tone is played and the volume buttons can then operate normally for that particular purpose only. The same is applicable to the alarm clock settings when selecting a tone from within the clock applications. Sound was also available in voice recording application (built in iOS 7 latest update).\n\n*In all other cases there was no sound and no control over volume. When pressing the volume buttons I get a screen that says ringer on top but I cannot control it\n\n\nIf you have this problem, it has nothing to do with hardware or earphone sockets, charging socket, etc. The problem only occurs if you have updated your iPhone using OTA update. For some reason updating over the air causes the system to trigger the sound and volume problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*First back up your phone on iTunes so you can restore data later.\n\n*Keep the phone connected to itunes and enter the phone into a DFU mode as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the power button and home button simultaneously for 15 seconds.\n\n*Release the power button while keeping the home button pressed for another 15 seconds.\n\n*Release the home button.\n\n\nYour screen would turn to pitch black as it is now in DFU mode. If the screen is anything but black repeat the sequence above until you get the pitch black screen.\n\n*At this particular time when you are correctly in DFU mode, iIunes will show a message stating that your phone needs restoration. Press Restore.\n\n*iTunes will start downloading the latest version of iOS 7 — do not unplug the phone or power off computer.\n\n*Once downloaded, message will appear to ask you to restore hit restore and wait for the process to continue.\nOnce phone restarts you can now restore your data back up that you have created on your computer or iCloud that you have created before you started this process.\nThe phone sound will not return immediately — give it a couple of hours to allow systems to reset and there you go your phone is working again.\n\nA: Just clean the charger port using clean toothbrush and blowing air into the port...it could be because of some dust particle.\n\nA: Check the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is your ringer switched to off?\n\n*Is DND (Do Not Disturb Mode) on?\n\n*Has your iPhone / Apple Product had water damage recently or in the past?\n\n*If you plug in headphones does it work?\n\n*Is it glitched into headphone mode?\n\n\nThe answer to most is simple and you can also try restarting.\n\nA: I had the same problem till I discovered that iOS 7 had turned on the DND (Do Not Disturb). Once I turned off it worked perfectly.\n", "Q: Why doesn't window management software like Divvy work with Adobe Photoshop? I use both Divvy and SizeUp to manage my  windows. They work fine with application windows with the exceptions of Adobe Photoshop. They just don't seem to work with Photoshop. Whenever I apply them on Photoshop the window just acts bizarrely.\nHow may I address this? \n\nA: turns out that slate works just fine with photoshop.. it's a bit more technical/harder to set up than the other two.. but based on the people i've spoken with.. it's well worth the trouble\n\nA: Unfortunately, Adobe uses non-standard windows which don't respond to being resized programmatically.\nI just tried Slate, but while it can move Adobe windows, it can't resize them.\n", "Q: Proxy @ work, no proxy @ home I own a MacBookAir and surf great from home (wi-fi with WPA2).\nFrom time to time, I'd want to bring it at work where I have a connection through proxy (i know address and port).\nIf I do save the settings when I am at work, will I have to reopen settings page and remove proxy setting when reconnecting from home?\n\nA: You can configure two locations in your network settings and then configure the proxy for your work location in the advanced settings.\n\nA: You can setup two different network locations, one for home (no proxy) and one for work (with the proxy) and easily switch between them from the Apple menu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Network from the Apple menu\n\n*In the Locations dropdown, choose Edit Locations...\n\n*Click the \"+\" button to add a new location (call it \"home\" or any other name) and click Done\n\n*With this location chosen in the dropdown, modify your network settings  (by clicking the Advanced button) and click Apply\n\n*In the Locations dropdown, choose Edit Locations...\n\n*Click the \"+\" button to add a new location (call it \"work\" or any other name) and click Done\n\n*With this location chosen in the dropdown, modify your network settings with the proxy (by clicking the Advanced button) and click Apply\n\n*You can switch between locations (i.e., network configurations) by going to the Apple menu and then to the Locations submenu, where you can choose the network configuration that you have setup for that location\n\n\nSee Making new locations in the Using network locations Apple support page.\n\nA: There are three ways to deal with this, at least, so you don't have to enable/disable the proxy depending on your location. \n\n\n*\n\n*When you click the Apple menu in the top left corner of your menu bar, you'll see \"Locations\" menu item, and in there, by default, you should have two locations: Automatic and Manual. You can just create another location (e.g. \"Work\") which has everything configured in the exact same way as your current location, with the exception of the proxy. All you'll need to do when coming into work is to choose that location, and when going back home, choose the other one. This method is still manual, but requires less clicks, and doesn't require any external software. \n\n*You can use excellent program called ControlPlane which allows you to automate some tasks depending on your surroundings (e.g. WiFi networks visible, IP address assigned, Bluetooth devices visible, etc). It will allow you to change default printers, enable/disable proxies and all sorts of other things. The only problem I've sometimes had with it is it wouldn't set the default printer correctly, but all other actions worked great.\n\n*Lastly, your DHCP server in work can be configured to send the proxy details to either your machine only (based on the MAC address) or to all machines. As far as I remember, DHCP server uses Option 252 to inform clients of the proxy settings. The DHCP server, along with option 252, should pass the URL of the proxy configuration file. If you google this up, you'll get a better explanation, I just wanted to highlight this method too. This method doesn't require users to make any changes to their machines at all, however it will need the Network Administrator to change the configuration of the DHCP server and to prepare the proxy configuration file. \n", "Q: CLI to copy to clipboard but still output to term ?

The iPhone 5 magnetic enough on the back near the camera lens to attach a staple to. Why there is a magnet there and what it is for?\n\nA: It's very likely to be the speaker. Because yes, speaker use magnets. \nIt's on opposite side of the top speaker only and looking at this picture (courtesy of iFixit's iPhone teardown) there is nothing else that is magnetic. \n", "Q: Homebrew warning: \"No developer tools installed\" even though Xcode is installed After installing Homebrew the \"brew doctor\" command returns:\nWarning: No developer tools installed.\nYou should install the Command Line Tools.\nRun `xcode-select --install` to install them.\n\n…and I do have Xcode installed.\nAnyway, after running xcode-select --install the Xcode installer appears, then I click \"install\" and the installer closes.\nIs this normal? …and do I have to install Git from Homebrew, or can I use the one that comes with Xcode?\n\nA: Yes, it is perfectly normal for homebrew to prompt you to install Xcode. That happened to me right after I installed Mavericks.\nAs for your question about git, it depends a lot on your usage. Default git (and almost every other tools) are not of the latest version. If you're OK with that, then of course you can just use the default one.\n\nA: Xcode itself isn't what i needed to install, it was Specifically the \"Xcode Command Line Tools\", apparently thats a different thing...\n\nA: If you have Xcode installed this warning also appear even if make and gc is succesfully provided by Xcode itself. In this case you can just ignore this warning.\n", "Q: My iPhone 5 synced contacts from my wife's iPhone 5 My iPhone 5 (iOS 6.1.2) synced contacts from my wife's iPhone 5 (iOS 7.0.2) and changed many of them (changed names to contacts with similar numbers). She uses my Apple ID, but contacts transfer from her phone to mine. Does anyone know why does it syncs contacts?\n\nA: If you use the same Apple ID for iCloud on both devices then it will sync data like contacts between the two. I would suggest you sign out of iCloud on your device and create a new Apple ID for yourself.\n\nA: Suggesion 1: \nPardon me for being slightly out of context here, but I'd suggest creating a new Apple ID for her anyway. Apple now has Family Sharing feature, which would allow you to share media and purchases if you need. Though its available in only iOS 8+ (you'll have to upgrade of course) I recently got to upgrade my personal iPhone 4s to iOS 8 and I think its really useful in sorting out such situations with family and kids.\nSuggestion 2: \nI have switched off contacts sync with iTunes completely. Leaving iCloud to be only way the contacts sync, hence reducing the confusion and ambiguity.\n", "Q: Mavericks window loses focus on Cmd+Tab In OS X Mavericks (10.9) I have discovered a very annoying bug.\nTo reproduce:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have an external monitor connected to your Mac\n\n*Open two windows of the same application (e.g Chrome), and place one window on your Mac and the other on the external display\n\n*Click in the window on your external display to bring focus to it\n\n*⌘ Cmd+Tab ⇥ to another app (e.g Code editor)\n\n*⌘ Cmd+Tab ⇥ back to the app\n\n*Focus is now in the window on your Mac, and not on the external display (where the focus originally was). This means you have to click in the window to bring focus to it again.\n\n\nPractically this means, I can no longer have a window open on my Mac while working with the same app on the external display. How can I solve this?\n\nA: I can't help with this but I can confirm that this is one of many issues with multi screen multi window applications on mavericks. As he says, when you have 2 windows of the same app open on different screen, it will always give focus to the one on the primary monitor when you cmd+tab away and back to the app. This makes it rather annoying for development work when you are switching between a browser and editor regularly.\n\nA: I was having the same issue. The issue went away after I disabled all the checkboxes under the \"Mission Control\" system preference pane.\nI don't use Mission Control so this solution worked fine for me. If you use Mission Control you can probably narrow down which one of the checkboxes changes this specific behavior (I'm guessing \"Displays have separate Spaces\").\n\nA: Just when you switching between applications with Cmd + Tab, when you release CMD, keep hold down Alt \n\nA: I just noticed this same bug when I added a second monitor to my MBP.  \nUpgrading to OSX El Capitan (Beta) seems to have fixed it. (Yay!)\n\nA: faced this on Monterey with Chrome, set checkbox \"Group windows by application\" at Mission Control\n", "Q: Command+Tab misbehaving for apps on multiple monitors I tend to keep a few Terminal windows open in one monitor, and another Terminal window and Chrome open in another monitor.\nWhen I'm using a single monitor, pressing ⌘⇥ remembers which Terminal window was last selected, but when some of the Terminal windows are on one monitor and some on another, ⌘⇥ away from Chrome always goes to the Terminal on the same monitor, not the Terminal on the other monitor, which is the Terminal window I last selected.\nTL;DR. Is there a setting I can tweak to get ⌘⇥ to work in multi-monitor mode as it does in single monitor mode, remembering the last selected window for each app?\nSystem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal.app\n\n*Chrome.app (latest official stable)\n(Though I could have listed any two apps.)\n\n*Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks\n\nA: It seems that this is related to displays having separate spaces. This can be changed by unchecking System Preferences -> Mission Control -> Displays have separate Spaces. (requires logout+login)\nNote that with this you'll get the old full screen with multiple monitors support (that isn't so nice usually)\nRelated also to other multi-monitor functionality things, see for example cmd-tab behavior on Mavericks with multiple displays.\n", "Q: sound quality difference between USB cables I am currently reading about Digital-Analog-Converters in a magazine. In one section about connecting an iPod, it says that the sound via a USB cable such as the one from Audioquests Cinnamon is significantly smoother and more velvety compared to the official USB cable from Apple.\nAlso, a standard USB cable: In the description of Audioquest \"Coffee\", they are claiming that there is a huge difference. And they cost about 280€! Or their \"Diamond\" version costs about 550€! Here is some review, again claiming that there is a difference. Here is another review. And here another one.\nHow can that be? The signals which go through the cable are digital. How can there be any difference?\n\n(Just for reference, I also asked the same question on AVP.SE with similar answers.)\n\nA: The digital path, as long as it is good enough to work, will not make any difference.\nA long or poorly shielded USB cable can cause noise problems on the power supply side of the attached device. I have seen this on electronic test equipment using long and very thin USB cables. This has manifested itself as a 50Hz buzz on the 5V line which is then picked up by the ADC in the device. I would imagine it would be the same for any sound card.\nMost cables are however fine.\nThe particular articles linked to sound like the usual made up audiophile rubbish though.\n\nA: As far as I understand it, cable jitter is a possibility so a USB cable with less jitter is better.\nThe question seems to be: does a standard USB cable have that much jitter that you need a expensive usb cable?\nSo far I think most reviews have taken a subjective point of view. Here are some actual measurements:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://archimago.blogspot.de/2013/04/measurements-usb-cables-for-dacs.html\n…so it seems there are no differences between the USB cables, but people are willing to pay the prices so somebody is going to offer.\n\nA: If we're talking about 30-pin iPod connectors (which we seem to be, based on the link you provided), there is an analog signal for audio—line out is carried on pins 3 and 4 if pin 11 is grounded.\n(That said, I'll wholeheartedly commit to the prospect that multi-100-euro cables are almost certainly substantially overpriced.)\nhttp://pinouts.ru/PortableDevices/ipod_pinout.shtml\n", "Q: Outlook 2011: Keyboard shortcut to assign categories? In Outlook 2011, is there some way to assign keyboard shortcuts to specific categories, so I can categorize messages without having to use the mouse to select the drop-down from the Categories menu in the Ribbon?\n\nA: Yes, you can do this.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Select Keyboard.\n\n*Select Keyboard Shortcuts.  \n\n*Select Application Shortcuts in the left navigation pane.\n\n*Click the + button to create a new shortcut.\n\n*Choose Microsoft Outlook.app in the Application drop-down menu.\n\n*Enter the exact name of the menu command you want to add. E.g. for an Outlook category named \"Project X\" enter that category name, \"Project X.\" \n\n*Click in the Keyboard Shortcut field and press a unique keyboard sequence such as Control-Option-T. \n\n*Click the Add button.\n\n\nFor some more ideas about how you could add keyboard shortcuts to Outlook:Mac, check out \"Unleash new uses for keyboard commands in Outlook for Mac\" in the Office:Mac Help Blog.\n\nA: I had mixed results with the above method. It would work once, and then just scroll to the last email received in my list after that.  However, I launched Automator (in Applications folder) and created a service (looks like a gear) from the new workflow menu. From there it only took 2 actions from the several Outlook choices included in Automator:\n • Get Selected Outlook Items\n • Set Category of Outlook Items\n\nDrag these items to the workflow area and select the Category from the dropdown.  Save and and name this workflow. Then, select Services > Services Preferences...  from the program name in the title menu, scroll to your named workflow and double-click to the right to assign a keyboard shortcut.\nThe only downfall is that this shortcut will work from anywhere, I will try to isolate it to work ONLY when using Outlook later.\n", "Q: Can OS X dump cores in the working directory instead of /cores? I don't know when it started, but at some point, OS X started dumping cores into a special folder (/cores). This is a pain since they get jumbled together and it's hard to keep track of which core files goes with which execution. Is there an environment variable or special flag I can set to have cores dumped into the working directory (as with other operating systems) instead?\n\nA: I finally figured this out. It turns out that this is a kernel parameter controlled by sysctl. You can set this on a per shell basis to dump in the current working directory with:\nsysctl -w kern.corefile=core.%P\n\nSince I never wanted my core dumps to end up in /cores, but always in the current directory, I added this plist to /Library/LaunchDaemons/:\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>sysctl</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/sbin/sysctl</string>\n        <string>-w</string>\n        <string>kern.corefile=core.%P</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nUPDATE:\nSince I wrote this, it looks like the sysctl command changed.

So my Question is, is there any possibility to download only a few Mails (like on iOS - the first 200 Mails) or does have anybody of you out there a great Solution to prevent Apple Mail to download all my 19.000+ Google Mails and 5.000 iCloud Mails?\nI would like to use the \"native\" Apple Mail Client.\nWhat also would be a Idea (but i found nothing to solve this Problem) to redirect the mail to my Mailbox on my (uberspace.de) Account where i'm able to use qmail.\nSo it should be a nice Solution to help People with the same Problem here.\n(btw yeah i'm searching for a long time for an \"awesome\" Solution ;)\n\nA: I doubt that changing your Apple Mail settings is going to help with your disk space problem (I've got more mail items than you do in my IMAP accounts, but my Apple Mail folder in ~/Library/Mail/ is under 1 GB), but leaving that aside, here are some ways to address the question that you have posed.\nIf offline access to your email isn't important to you, you can simply not have Apple Mail store your email locally.  To do this, in Apple Mail, go to Preferences -> Accounts -> [your Gmail or iCloud account] -> Advanced, and select \"don't keep copies of any messages\" under \"Keep copies of messages for offline viewing\".  \nIf offline access to your email is important to you, there are a couple of options.  There are a couple of options in the aforementioned \"Keep copies …\" dropdown menu which might help you, such as not keeping attachments or only keeping mails which you have read.  \nIf you'd like to redirect mail from Gmail to your uberspace.de account, that is trivial.  In Gmail, open your Settings, select \"Forwarding and POP/IMAP\", and then select \"add a forwarding email address\".  Gmail will send a confirmation link to the email address that you provide.  After that, back on that same tab, select this email address to forward to and choose what you want Gmail to do with the forwarded email (keep it, archive it, delete it).  (Gmail's full instructions for this are here, which includes links to information about how to filter email that you forward.) In Apple Mail, you would then disable downloading new mail from Gmail and enable it for this new account after you've gotten qmail set up to your needs.  \nIf you'd like to redirect mail from iCloud to your uberspace.de account, that is also trivial.  In iCloud, open the Settings (lower-left corner), and enter the email address to which you want your mail forwarded.  You can choose there whether iCloud should delete the mail it forwards, and I presume that you would thus not have Apple Mail downloading your iCloud mail.\n\nA: You can delete unused mails also.\n", "Q: Is the 120 FPS video recording's quality 720P?

You can perform :map <esc>Ok + but it won’t affect \"<esc>Ok.\n\n*Mapping <esc>Ok to something will add a delay in processing single <esc> press (see :h timeoutlen).\n\n", "Q: CalendarAgent keeps asking for access to \"login\" after reboot I'm running Mountain Lion 10.8.5... and every time I restart my computer or log-out & back in, I get a message box saying that \n\n\"CalendarAgent wants to use \"login\" keychain\".\n\nI've tried repairing the keychain... didn't work.\nI've tried setting all names in the login keychain to \"Allow all applications to access this keychain\".... didn't work.\nI've tried deleting the keychain and setting all passwords again... didn't work.\nThis is beyond frustrating at this point. The only I can seem to get it to quit asking me this is if I delete my exchange account from calendar and quit using it altogether. \nAre there any other suggestions on how to fix this?\n\nA: What I would do in this situation is rename the \"login\" keychain in ~/Library/Keychains to something like login.keychain.old.\nThen I would open the Keychain Access app and drag login.keychain.old into the keychains sidebar. OS X will create a new login keychain. So all you have to do is open the old login keychain list you created and drag the passwords into the new login keychain. \nHope this helps.\n", "Q: messed up .bash_profile while configuring PostgreSQL I am quite new to Terminal use. \nWhile installing and activating a local PostgreSQL server on my MacBook Pro (OS 10.6.8) I definitely messed up my .bash_profile (probably by messing around with user / superuser and password settings). \nActually I got the server running by entering:\npsql -U postgres -p 5432 -d postgres\nBut I didn't get the additional plug-ins (PostGIS and osm2pgsql) to function, probably due to the messed-up profile. \nAfter starting a Terminal session the following message is shown:\n-bash: export: /Users/Jop/.bash_profile': not a valid identifier\nAnd the content of the .bash_profile is:\nexport PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:$PATH\nexport PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:$PATH source\n/Users/Jop/.bash_profile\nalias psql=/usr/local/pgsql-9.2/bin/psql\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\" source /Users/Jop/.bash_profile\nalias psql=/usr/local/pgsql-9.2/bin/psql\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\" source /Users/Jop/.bash_profile\nalias psql=/usr/local/opt/postgresql/bin/psql\nalias psql=/usr/local/pgsql-9.2/bin/psql\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n\nCould anyone help me out?

I sometimes need to run very long computations on my computer (usually using code I wrote myself, sometimes compiled, sometimes interpreted), which can take minutes, hours, or even days to complete.  OS X Mavericks incorporates several features that are designed to minimize energy usage, such as App Nap and timer coalescing.  If I were designing such a feature, I would be skeptical of a process that was still requesting maximum CPU usage after running for days; even if this process was started by a user action, that action was days ago.  But as a user, I actually do want such computations to run to completion with high priority, even though they are usually running in the background.\nIs there any possibility that my extended computations would be slowed down by the power-saving features of Mavericks?\n\nA: According to the Apple Developer documentation (and Core Technologies Overview for Mavericks), App Nap can be opted out by either an Application developer or a user, but by default are active. \nFor a GUI application, the user can opt an application out of App Nap manually with a checkbox in the Finder “Get Info...” pane.\nTimer Coalescing only becomes active when on battery power, so it should not affect your long running background processes.\nFinally, you can check on the status of App Nap in the Activity Monitor. On the Energy Tab, there is a column describing App Nap status for each application, so if policies change, you can check actual status here.\n\n\nA: Mavericks (10.9.2) interfers heavily with the on-going processes. Because it is designed for the average user, and not for the engineer running days long analyses.\nI am a Matlab user, and using a MBP beast to analyze data on a daily basis. Sometimes these may take as long as few days. My experiences are as follows:\n1/ App Nap doesn't interfere with my running analyses.\n2/ Switching user accounts and then coming back to the account where the analyses are running heavily interferes with the processes. For example, when I have 5 Matlabs open and running analyses, switching to another user account leaving these analyses on the background has an impact on the performance. More interestingly, when I come back to the account where these analyses are running, the processes lose their priority. And using the \"renice -20 PID\" command cannot bring these processes to a higher priority level.\n3/ I also observed that the lock screen also interferes with the running analyses. In such a way that after unlocking the screen I realized tgat the process priorities were different.\nBest Practice so far:\nWhen starting an analysis, never ever interrupt it until it finishes.\nProposed Solution:\nMaverick Server, which is designed to run simultaneous processes in parallel, might be much better suited for such computational heavy user profiles. It is unfortunately not free...\n\nA: Both technologies you list - App Nap and Timer Coalescing are basically opt-in features that need to be baked into an app.\nSince you are crafting your own programs, at worst you'll have to make sure your framework and code doesn't enable these features. At best, nothing will change and you can expect the computations to run on a system that's intentionally throttling programs that have volunteered for less CPU when they are idle and see a speedup without needing to change anything.\n\nA: Yes. To my experience it does!! \nI have as well long computations that may last hours or days. If I switch user accounts, while one of the accounts has, say 5 processes that are doing analyses in parallel, their priority gets demoted. \nMore importantly, when I come back to the analysis account where these 5 processes are running, I can never get them back to full power again. \nThis is highly annoying.\nSee for example the figure, 5 analysis-related processes are using only 27% of the CPU, whereas before I loged out to another account, they were using nearly 90% (the other figure)... I cannot promote them to higher priority and I this costs me a lot of time of course.\n\n\nAfter this logout/login cycle I am not able to bring these 5 processes to the same level of resource consumption. (renice'ing has no effect whatsoever).\nThis is independent than App Nap as it is turned off.\n", "Q: Outlook 2011 Meetings - how to add as an attachment? I'm trying to get Outlook for Mac to do what Outlook for Windows has done for a long time.\nI want to create an email, attach a meeting to the email and send it - I don't want just the meeting details summarized as text (what seems to happen), I want the whole meeting to be added to my email as an attachment.\nI loved this feature in Windows as I could send the meeting to a non-participant to keep them in the loop and not have to redact any details, but at the same time, it didn't pop up on the recipient's calendar the way a forwarded meeting does.\n\nA: In your Outlook:Mac calendar, drag the meeting tile from your calendar to your desktop or a Finder window.  It will create a new file named MyMeetingTitle.ics.  You can then create your new email and attach this .ics file to it.  Your recipient will then be able to add this .ics file to their calendar.\n", "Q: How can I turn off the gamed service or more generally, any service? Yeah, bought a Macbook Retina, come from a Linux background where this stuff is usually a question of removing via the package manager. \nAnyhow, I don't play games on this, it's purely for business/development. But I keep seeing this gamed process that came down with the Mavericks update trying to phone home. \nApart from software update, I don't really want any process phoning home, especially when I paid 2G for the damned thing. \nAnyhow, anyone know how I can disable/uninstall/kill this process for good?\n\nA: I'm not sure how to completely disable the process but I've set up Little Snitch to disallow incoming / outgoing processes associated with the Game Center. It's a useful little program. \n\nA: Specifically for the gamed service, the following command in one of the posts about a similar topic on the Apple Support Communities worked for me, without any need to modify plists or rename files:\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.gamed disabled -bool true\n\nChanging \"true\" back to \"false\" will re-enable it, although I've not tried it.\n\nA: The first thing to do is open the damn thing and log out of Game Center, and delete whatever it still filled in.\n\nA: This is a cheap hack:\nsudo mv /System/Library/Frameworks/GameKit.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/gamed /System/Library/Frameworks/GameKit.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/gamed.inactive\n\n\nA: In Yosemite 10.10.3 the gamed process can be found in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/GameCenterFoundation.framework/Versions/A/gamed.\nI needed to rename the process to get rid of it, the defaults write and unload suggestions didn't work.\n\nA: Apple really wants this service to run:\n# pwd\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/GameCenterFoundation.framework/Versions/A\n# mv gamed gamed.disabled\nmv: rename gamed to gamed.disabled: Operation not permitted\n# rm gamed\noverride rwxr-xr-x  root/wheel restricted,compressed for gamed? y\nrm: gamed: Operation not permitted\n# ls -l gamed\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  4430368 Jul  9 04:51 gamed\n\nThis was on El Capitan 10.11.6\n", "Q: Install an older OS X version on an external volume I am using 10.9 and would like to install 10.7 on an external volume. I have the “Install Mac OS X Lion” application, but when I run it, I get the message\n\nThis version of Mac OS X is too new to run “Install Mac OS X” from Mac OS X 10.7.\n\nWell, I do not want to downgrade, I just want to have a way to boot into 10.7. Is there any way around this?\n\nA: Carsten Shultz' answer is still generally correct, but there's also the easier option to use a tool like Diskmaker X http://diskmakerx.com/whats-this/ or since Mavericks use the built-in ability to make a bootable disk with a Terminal command.\nFor the latter with the Mavericks or Yosemite installer\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the Mavericks/Yosemite installer that you previously downloaded and stop at the first screen with the big X symbol and continue button.\n\n*Open up Terminal and if Mavericks, then issue this command on a single line:sudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/[DiskName] --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app --nointeraction \nreplacing [DiskName] with the name of the disk you want to reformat into an installation disk. If there are spaces in the name use \"quotation\" marks around the whole path: \"/Volumes/[DiskName]\". Alternatively, if Yosemite issue this updated command instead:sudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/[DiskName] --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction\nIn both cases you of course need to supply your administrator password as usual.\n\n*Wait for the installation to complete, This can take a very long time, like an hour or so, depending on the speed of the disks involved and other factors.\nWith the OS X USB Installer disk ready follow Carstens's advice and hold down option after reboot and boot up from the installer and unfettered from the installed OS X on your internal disk install the OS X version on the external disk of your choice.\n\nA: There is a much simpler method, IF you have access got a system that is currently running the prior OS.  I installed El Capitan, then ran into an application that was not yet compatible.  So I took a Thunderbolt/USB 3 drive, formatted it GUID and installed Yosemite to it from my wife's laptop (which is running Yosemite).\nThen simply plugged the external drive into my MB Pro with El Capitan, held down Option while booting, and now I have the selection of booting Yosemite or El Capitan until the application is El Capitan compatible.\nThis is a process that will \"buy you time\" if the need for Yosemite is only for an infrequently required application.\n\nA: The (or at least a) solution is embarrassingly simple: Do not start the installer from a running system, but make a bootable install medium from the disk image included in the install program package and use that.\nQuick instructions (more detailed ones can easily be found on the net, but I have not read any thoroughly enough to be able to endorse them):\n\n\n*\n\n*Take for example USB drive or SD card, partition it in Disk Utility, make one partition and make sure to select GUID partition scheme so that the medium will be bootable.\n\n*In Disk Utility use \"Restore\" to copy the Installer to the boot medium: As destination use the newly created partition, for the source use the Finder to show the package contents (right click) of \"Install Mac OS X Lion\", there locate InstallESD.dmg and drag it to the source field.\n\n*After copying, reboot holding the option key, select the install medium you just created and happily install Lion to a destination of your choice.\n\n\nAn 8GB medium will be fine for the installer (it's 4.7GB), and a 32GB partition for the installed system (this will leave you with more than 7GB of free space).\n\nA: An alternative solution might be to run earlier versions of OS X in a Virtual Machine. Parallels Desktop Lite is free from the Mac App Store, and can create a VM from an OS installer app.\nYou can run versions of MacOS even if they are too old for the hardware. This is perfect for maintaining legacy software.\n", "Q: Chrome AutoSelectCertificateForUrls OSX I have a client SSL certificate for authentication. I'm trying to map it to a URL in Chrome on OSX, however the Chromium documentation is of no use.\nI have no idea what file to put the AutoSelectCertificateForUrls preference in.

You can only format the partition containing your OS and do the install on that partition.\nIf you want to install Mavericks on a different partition to allow multi boot (Mavericks/Mountain Lion) you can use another partition to do so as long as there is enough free space on it.\nOne important tip to remember is the ability of disk utility at creating additional partitions :\n\n\n*\n\n*Open DiskUtility.app\n\n*Select the desired hard drive\n\n*Go to the Partitions tab\n\n*Under the partitions list click on the add button to create a new partition.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Migration Tool VS CCC I have a 2010 Mac Pro. Still running Snow Leo, as there are still quite a few programs that are PPC and I'm not prepared to update all of them.\nMy current boot drive is 1.5TB and I'd like to swap it out for a new 3TB. From past history I'm looking between the Apple Migration tool and Carbon Copy Cloner.\nThe migration tool will mean a full install to the new drive, and then migrating, while CCC just a full copy. Seems the migration might be more effort but might help leave some garbage behind. The current system has been slowing down, and I'd imagine a new OS install would help get it back to the \"new Mac\" speed. \nAny thoughts on these two methods and my goal? i.e. a speedy-fresh install with all my software moved from the older drive. \n\nA: Indeed, there are some differences between cloning the disk and Migration Assistant.\nAs you mentioned, MA will not migrate all the files, which can be both good and bad…\n\n\n*\n\n*Corrupt system files won't be copied if you use MA since you are installing a completely new OS, then copying certain files over.\nHowever, be warned that since they won't be copied over, any modifications that you've made will be lost. This can be mitigated by manually copying over any system files that you've modified1.\n\n*Incorrect preference files will still be carried over, but only if they're specific to your account.\nMost system-wide preference files will be reset, which can be useful if you have system-wide problems, but may cause some extra effort if you have specific changes that you've made.\nThis can be mostly mitigated if you know which global preference files you have modified, since these can be copied over1.\n\n*Because CCC doesn't reinstall OS X, the Recovery HD will not be changed.\nThis means that it won't reset it if you have problems with your Recovery HD or for any other reason, although you can manually copy your Recovery HD using CCC which can be useful if you've made changes to your Recovery HD that you wish to keep.\n\n*MA should not copy any system-specific preferences, which can be useful if you are migrating to a different computer, but since you are migrating the same computer, this should not be a reason to decide one over the other.\n\n*CCC will leave you a fully-bootable OS, which is much quicker than re-installing OS X then using MA separately.\n\n*If an app relies on an HD's unique identifier stored in a certain preference, CCC will not correct this.\nSince MA will reset almost all system-wide preferences, any such preferences will not be maintained, and will revert any settings to match the current installation.\nIn conclusion…\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want the speediest possible Mac, with all your data and almost all your settings, Migration Assistant is the best way to go.\n\n*If you want the simplest migration or want to ensure that all your settings are copied over, use CCC or another disk cloning tool.\n1 This is where looking through your backups of system files & preferences before you changed them can really help, because you did make backups, right? :)\n", "Q: Finder Search (spotlight) not finding all relevant results I'm trying to remove an application manually by deleting it and any extras using the search function in Finder. \nAs a backup, I also ran the app through AppCleaner to see if it caught anything as well and I noticed that AppCleaner marked some files (.plist, plist.lockfile, and some actual folders) that no matter what keyword I use won't show up via finder search.\nMy settings are to search 'My Mac' and have made sure system files are included and used both 'name matches' & 'name contains' but I can't pull up these files.

What can I do to convince iTunes that the iPad really can play these videos that the iPhone took?

Currently, there's a symlink on 'Macintosh HD' pointing to /Users on 'Data HD'. \n\nA: Here's what I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your full disk (all partitions) to an external disk using Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper.\n\n*Copy your home folder back to the main partition (to /Users) using \"Paste Exactly\": in Finder, go to your home folder on /Volumes/Data HD, select Edit → Copy from the menu, go to /Users (still in Finder), open the Edit menu, hold down the Command, Option and Shift modifier keys, and select \"Paste Exactly\".\n\n*Go to System Preferences and open the \"Users & Groups\" preferences\n\n*Unlock using the lock-icon in the bottom left\n\n*Right-click the user account of which you're moving the home folder\n\n*Choose \"Advanced Options…\"\n\n*Change the user's home directory using the \"Choose…\" button and point it to the copy you just made in /Users\n\n*Reboot your computer\n\n\nExtra check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename old the user folder in /Volumes/Data HD so that you are sure OS X cannot find it anymore\n\n*Reboot your computer\n\n*Make sure that everything still works\n\n\nIf everything still works, you can go to Disk Utility, delete the partition corresponding to /Volumes/Data HD, and then resize the main partition to use the entire harddisk. All this is done by selecting the disk on the left-hand side in Disk Utility (so the main entry that is listed above the two partitions, not the partition itself), and then selecting the \"Partition\" tab. Select the partition you want to delete, click the 'minus' button, click Apply. Then resize the first partition by dragging its bottom border down to cover the entire drive and click Apply again.\nFor more information and/or alternatives, please refer to this post: https://discussions.apple.com/message/23510349#23510349.\n", "Q: Printer Setup Utility gone in Mavericks, how to set default printer in Applescript now? I have some Applescripts that set the default printer using \"Printer Setup Utility\", that seems gone in Mavericks.\nAnyone have an alternative to suggest?\n\nA: You can use AppleScript to execute shell scripts, so you can use:\ndo shell script (\"lpoptions -d printername\")\n\nReplace printername with the actual printer name. It may not be exactly as it shows in System Preferences (I think ALL non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores, but I'm not certain) so you can view your list of printers with:\nlpstat -p\n\n", "Q: How can i get Facebook back if the app won't re-download? \niPhone Facebook app had a \"bug fix\" update so I clicked it and it wouldn't load. I deleted the app and reinstalled and now it keeps saying it can't be downloaded at this time. I've tried re-downloading it with both my Wi-Fi on and off and it still doesn't work!\n\nA: The servers of Apple did not allow downloading the Facebook application for some (unknown) reason. It was probably a bug.\nDownloading Facebook on the iPhone now works again (at least in France).\n", "Q: What happens if I delete used cache I've read this Mac OS X daily article, and now in finder I can see all the cache folder/files sorted by size:  \n\nThe problem is that I don't which cache is still in use from my applications, for example I don't know what is com.apple.helpd used for. So the question is: can I safely delete any folder? Or instead I risk that an application goes to search from these folders and maybe it crashes?\n\nA: Nothing at all. Any caches that are required will be recreated at next reboot. I clean my caches once in a while as an OCD thing, but it's not needed. A cache is just a temporary file. If you delete it, the apps will recreate them when needed.\nCaches were needed back in the HDD days to speed up loading in applications. On SSD's they're not as important, but they're legacy and probably won't go away anytime soon. You can keep deleting them, but they'll always come back. Don't worry about anything going wrong. A properly written app is smart enough to not actually save any settings in a cache so you won't have to worry about losing information.\nDelete them all if you want. The ones your apps need will just be recreated. If you're on a HDD you'll notice slowdown for a while as apps recreate the cache. But on an SSD you won't notice a thing.\n", "Q: Run applescript after specific application launch VLC can't autoload extensions, so I write applescript to load extensions, now I need make run it every time after VLC start, any suggestions ?\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro also supports running a macro when an application is activated:\n\n\nA: You can make an AppleScript like the following\nopen -a VLC\n--Load extensions\n\nOtherwise you can make a shell script to do the exact same thing. However, making it automatic when you actually open VLC by itself would require modifying it's contents. You can also make an Automator script, add the above AppleScript, save it as an application called VLC-1, move it to your applications folder, and open that instead of VLC each time. Another option is to move VLC, save the Automator app as \"VLC\" and have it open the original app wherever you put it.\n", "Q: Is restoring a Time Machine backup on a clean install of OS X Mavericks still a 'clean' install? I would like to upgrade to OS X Mavericks. Also, I think it would be a good chance to clean up my system.\nMy question is: If do a clean install of OS X Mavericks and then restore my machine from a Time Machine backup, then…\n\n\n*\n\n*would this still be \"clean\"? …or would this just be the same as upgrading my system the regular way?\n\n*will I lose any data/settings/apps?\n\n\nThank you guys for your help!\n\nA: If you reinstall 10.9, don’t choose \"Restore from Time Machine Backup\". Make a simple install after you reformatted your drive with Disk Utility.\nAfter the install, the setup process will start and you can choose if you want to restore from Time Machine. I would recommend you to deselect the System to restore, just your home directory and your applications. So you will just restore your data (docs, music, pics), your applications settings (~/Library) and the application bundles from /Application.\nThis the closest you can get to a \"clean\" install, without manually migrating your data and setup again every single app.\n\nA: Absolutely. A clean install is one where the core OS comes from a valid installer. Past that, you can test the system for whatever level of \"fitness\" you require and only move users, user data and third party apps from a backup in a controlled manner if desired. \nI like to look at the loss of data in the opposite direction. When that installation goes badly, the loss has typically already happened. If you don't have a backup and restore system where by you can get back to the pre-upgrade status, you might not want to change anything on the system as you can't really recover from a random failure at that point either - let alone have a good option if the software you have installed isn't compatible with the new OS.\n", "Q: Migrate Mac to Mac with external iTunes & iPhoto I've got an iMac with 2 external hard drives.\nOne 1.5TB external hard drive for iTunes and iPhoto (750GB combined) and one 3TB external hard drive for Time Machine backups.\nI want to migrate everything to my new MacBook Pro which has 512GB storage.\nHow can I do this? Migrate assistant won't work because there is not enough storage on my MacBook.\nOr can I just plug the external hard drives into my MacBook and select them as my iTunes & iPhoto library?\n\nA: Yes, you just plugin your external hard drives and start iTunes and iPhoto with the option key hold to select your library\n", "Q: App for finding iPhone from a Mac? Is there any Mac client to enable the \"Find my iPhone\" service? It would be better from the command line, but an app will also do.\nNone of the programs I have tried seem to work right now.\n\nA: I use Sosumi: http://clickontyler.com/sosumi/\nIt is essentially a Mac app version of the iCloud Find My iPhone webpage.  Except it allows you to add multiple iCloud accounts.  So as an example, I added my own so I can track my own iDevices, but I also added my Mom's to track her iPhone if need be.\n\nA: You don't need an app. Just log into your iCloud account through Safari or Chrome or any other browser you use. \n1) Log into iCloud.com with your Apple ID\n2) Click on “Find iPhone” App\n3) Here we go: you should be able to see it as long as\n--You have your iPhone connected to your Apple ID\n--Your iPhone is online and charged\nYou can also filter view of your devices.

I have an iMac with 10.8.5 running fine with Windows XP installed with Boot Camp that works both as native boot and with Parallels. I want to install 10.9 over 10.8 (not clean install) and I have read that XP cannot be installed from 10.9. But will the existing functional XP/Boot Camp installation survive the upgrade?\n\nA: When I recently installed OS X 10.9.1 over 10.8.5 on my mid-2010 Mac Mini running Windows XP in Boot Camp, XP continued to work fine in Boot Camp.  I don't run Parallels, and I don't have your exact configuration, so I can't guarantee results.  Additional information: I had originally installed XP in Boot Camp when my Mac was running Snow Leopard, and I subsequently upgraded to Lion, then Mountain Lion, then Mavericks.  Microsoft is stopping security patches for XP in April 2014, so if you use XP on the network, you may want to install a newer version of Windows.\n", "Q: Youtube crashes audio Whenever I play videos from youtube, the speakers seem to crash, the sound plays more times even on it and repeats.

(MacBookPro 15 SSD, MacBookAir(new), MacBookPro 15) By that I mean, if I select from the menu restart they shutdown and do not turn back on. The only thing I can think of in common about them is that they have FileVault setup and all have Mavericks installed.\nWhat step can I take to figure out how to change the setups so that restart works to actually bring back the system to a running state?\nI am very comfortable with terminal, editing files.\nI took a look at pmset and don't see anything there.\nI tried $ sudo shutdonw -r now  Same result, turns off stays off.\nFile vault was setup after initial computer setup. I had to enter the password for each user when I turned on FileVault and I saved the key. I have other computer with fileVault setup \"i think\" the same. I did it on each of them and they work fine.\n\nA: Since you didn't list enough technical details about how file vault is set up (for instance if you have auto log in enabled or disabled, whether you are using institutional keys or just having one or more users storing the unlocking keys in the user accounts so that the recovery HD can unlock things) - I'll start with some steps to narrow down what might be happening.\nFirst thing is to check if the machines are capable of restarting by storing the file vault key in RAM:\nfdesetup supportsauthrestart\n\nIf that reports \"false\" then your hardware might not support restarts with FileVault 2 enabled. If it's true, does the system reboot if you ask for a controlled restart?\nfdesetup authrestart\n\nAlso, if you're not comfortable with the fdesetup tool, you might want to review some of the helpful articles from Rich Trouton's blog. You'll want to start with an old article getting the basics covered if the current articles assume too much knowledge of how fdesetup works as dealing with file vault from the command line is a lot like the proverbial \"sip of water from a fire hose\" to many.\n\nA: Since it sounds like the Macs in question have FileVault 2 enabled, here's what happens on a FileVault 2-encrypted Mac when it's restarted without using the fdesetup authrestart command:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Mac boots to the FileVault 2 pre-boot login screen\n\n\nThis login screen loads before the OS does. There's no remote access to this login screen, since remote access tools need the OS to be running.\n\n\n*\n\n*If nobody logs in within a few minutes, the Mac shuts off.\n\n\nThis auto-shutoff is a safety feature. Since the OS is not running at the pre-boot login screen, there's no way for the Mac to determine and regulate its own temperature. To prevent any issues with the Mac getting overheated, the Mac will turn off.\n\n\n*\n\n*If someone logs in with their FileVault-enabled account, the OS on the Mac then boots and the account is logged in.\n\n\nIf the Mac is rebooted using the fdesetup authrestart command, here's what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*fdesetup stores at least one additional copy of an unlock key in both system memory and (on supported systems) the System Management Controller (SMC).\n\n*On reboot, the unlock key is fed to the disk encryption to unlock it and allow the OS to boot.\n\n*The reboot process clears the unlock key from memory and (on supported systems) the SMC.\n\n*The OS boots and goes to the OS's regular login window.\n\nA: Get your mac to the nearest service center and get it repaired because sometimes we cannot deal with every problem sitting at home sometimes technicians are really helpful but still the question here is of software issues so you can try to re install a new mac os that can help you out.\n", "Q: Free media player with jump-to-specific-time option for big mp3 files I'm listening to some mp3 files, some of them lasting 5 hours or more, and I'm looking for a player which allows to jump directly to a specific point in time in the mp3 file.\nVLC has an option \"jump to time\" but it's buggy, it doesn't do anything or just hangs the app. Each time I reopen any player I've tried so far, I have to guess and click the time progress bar trying to find where I left.\n\nA: Are you aware of iTunes' option to remember the play position in a file? Right-click on any track (or select it and press Cmd-I) to open it.\n\n\nA: You could assign a shortcut to a script like this:\nset text item delimiters to \":\"\ndisplay dialog \"\" default answer \"\"\nset ti to text items of text returned of result\nif number of ti is 1 then\n    item 1 of ti\nelse if number of ti is 2 then\n    60 * (item 1 of ti) + (item 2 of ti)\nelse if number of ti is 3 then\n    3600 * (item 1 of ti) + 60 * (item 2 of ti) + (item 3 of ti)\nend if\ntell application \"iTunes\" to set player position to result\n\nOr install ffmpeg with brew install ffmpeg --with-afplay and use a command like ffplay -ss 1:23:45 file.mp3.\nI also use scripts like this to change the playback position with the keyboard:\ntry\n    tell application \"iTunes\"\n        if player position < 15 then\n            previous track\n        else\n            set player position to player position - 15\n        end if\n    end tell\nend try\n\ntry\n    tell application \"iTunes\"\n        set player position to player position + 15\n    end tell\nend try\n\n", "Q: Changing Metadata of an Epub in iBooks How can I edit the metadata of an Epub file?

For example, in Chrome, when I browse to nytimes.com, in the status bar, I see the message \"waiting for css.nytimes.com\" or \"waiting for www.nytimes.com\" for a long period of time.\nThis is happening at home (on VPN to my employer's network or off) as well as when I'm connected to my employer's network directly. The problem occurs on all browsers on my Mac [Chrome, Safari, Firefox] and the curl command line tool in Terminal.\nThis problem seems to be isolated to my Mac. For example, when I browse on my iPhone (or my Windows laptop or another Mac laptop) on my home network, performance is great. It's terrible on my Mac. So this is definitely an issue with my Mac (OS Mountain Lion). This seems to be isolated to HTTP/HTTPS and not all TCP traffic since I can use SSH/RDP w/o any issues.\nUsing Activity Monitor, I can see ample free RAM and CPU utilization is minimal.  I noticed this problem a couple of weeks ago.  A reboot clears it up and then after 2-3 days, browsing starts to slow down again.  Some pages take minutes to appear (or some suddenly appear in a flash when I stop loading the page).\nWhat can I do diagnose the cause?\n\nA: I have the Cisco AnyConnect agent installed, which is only used for VPN and not Web Filtering. Still, the acwebsecagent process is running and slowing down my web browsing.\nTo uninstall acwebsecagent, run:\nsudo /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/websecurity_uninstall.sh\nCredit to this post for the above command.\n\nA: You didn't specify the brand of VPN software, but the process you cited leads us to the Cisco AnyConnect client. A quick search turned up a blog post tracing similar problems no the default install options for the Cisco AnyConnect client. THe punch line is that an uninstall then custom reinstall of that software seems to have cleared the problem up for several users.\nHere is the post.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Since the problem doesn't seem to be the network\n\n\n*\n\n*What are your proxy settings (Settings.app -> Network -> (select current uplink) -> Advanced -> Proxies -> Any setting with a checkmark)?\n\n*What are your DNS settings?

I have found where to see the devices that are using the Airport, but I can't identify which computer is which. Anyway, the most important question is can I turn of access to individual devices when I wish to? (Right now I just unplug the wifi.)\n\nA: You might easily manage this using Timed Access Control settings with a default rule that prohibits wireless internet during off hours.\n\nThen you could set up devices that have exceptions to the rules (or the opposite - block certain devices while letting most clients unfettered access).\nTo get to the screen above, run Airport Utility and then choose Network and enable Timed Access at the bottom of the visible window.\n", "Q: Restore functionality of Escape key in Finder (Mavericks) It's always been possible to remove focus from all selected files in Finder by pressing the ⎋ Escape key.

What kind of steps can I take to fix it?  \nThe Mac that is going to sleep has has OS X 10.8.  It works ok if I wake it up by hand.\nEdit:  Thanks for the responses.  I should have mentioned I do not have an Apple router.  Back to My Mac used to work without having to ask the computer never to sleep (in System Preferences).  Asking it to wake for network access seemed to be enough.  Unfortunately, some weeks passed after it last worked and before I tried it again, so troubleshooting is tricky.   Asking it to sleep is OK as a work-around, but I'd like to find the real problem.  \n\nA: The obvious solution would be to set the Mac never to sleep in Energy Saver Preference Pane. If your home router is an Apple Product, you could enable the bonjour sleep proxy setting on your Mac that's labeled \"Wake for Wi-Fi network access\" and even a sleeping Mac will be woken when Airport detects the remote control packets coming in for your Mac.\nAlternatively, you could use a free program called Caffeine to prevent sleep. Lastly, consider Edovia's free screens connect control panel to prevent your Mac from sleeping.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://edovia.com/en/screens.html\nScroll to the bottom of the page and download their control panel installer.

But also using Command-R doesn't boot the recovery HD, instead it starts Internet Recovery (which should start on Command-Alt-R?!) All features like Find my Mac or FileVault 2 (FileVault's encrypting as I write) work just fine as far as I can see. My MacBook is located correctly and I can play a sound on the Mac from iCloud.com, so I guess it works just the way it should. Everything else works fine, too.\nI don't really need my Recovery HD, because I also got another external recovery partition on an USB Stick. But I would be glad to know about what's the issue here, especially since it makes me feel crumbly to have an encrypted drive which relys on a not correctly installed Recovery HD by using CoreStorage. Running on a correct setup would make me feel a lot better ;)\nI installed it by the following steps:\nDIY Fusion Drive: Adding Recovery HD to a CoreStorage Volume Group\n(First made install on HD to create Recovery HD, then merging Full SSD and HDD partition, recovering backup from CCC)\nWhat I also do know is it's important to setup BootCamp prior FileVault.

Most everyone recommends using a VM instead.\n\nA: So, I came to a unexpected resolution, I just saw I could clone my internal recovery HD with CCC from my external CCC Backup (where I cloned it to when I started the backup a few weeks ago). After that the Recovery HD worked properly, the second \"Mac OS X\" boot device on alt pressing on startup disappeared and it shows a \"Wiederherstellung 10.9\" instead. That boots the Recovery HD, CMD+R still boots Internet Recovery, but I'm fine with that :)\n", "Q: Can I restrict download when my macbook is being hot spotted? I plan to stick an NFC tag on my macbook so that I can just click my phone on it to create a Wifi Hotspot which my laptop will automatically connect to.\nThe only problem I can think of though is that I have restricted data on my phone plan therefore I don't want the laptop to be doing anything like syncing with my dropbox, downloading system updates etc.\nIs there a way I can configure the macbook so that if using a certain WIFI network, it will restrict the traffic to only web browsing traffic.\n\nA: Little Snitch\nLittle Snitch has profiles that you can switch to which can contain custom network rules.\nFor example, you can create one profile that is bound to your home network that allows all incoming/outgoing connections for all applications, then create a second profile that allows all connections for Safari, but blocks all connections from other apps.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can request that applications ask for connection when not connected to your home network.\nThese profiles can be switched through the menu bar icon, or automatically upon joining a certain network.\n\n", "Q: Contacts in Mavericks Messages display phone numbers instead of contact names Since updating to Mavericks the Messages app doesn't display the contact names for people I've been communicating with iMessage, it shows their phone number instead. My messages thankfully still stay synced between my iPhone and Messages on Mavericks.\n\nA: When Messages receives an iMessage, it matches the source with an entry in your Contacts. If you don't have a matching contact, you just see the phone number or email address of their iCloud account. \nIf your phone syncs its contacts to iCloud, Facebook or some other source, and you would like your contacts on your computer to also sync to this source, open System Preferences then choose Internet Accounts. If you use iCloud for syncing, choose iCloud from the list of accounts then tick the \"Contacts\" checkbox. If you use Facebook, add a new Facebook account and your friends list's contact information will download and stay up-to-date as they change it. Pretty much any other source of contacts you can think of can be added here, either through one of the main account types for the major providers or \"Add Other Account\" for standards-based things like LDAP & CardDAV. \nWait a few seconds after adding the new account and ensuring \"Contacts\" is checked off, and your iMessages should now match up names where there were phone numbers or email addresses before.\nWhile you're in Internet Accounts, you can also add certain other message sources to Messages, if you desire. As an example, you can add a Google account and tick the \"Messages\" checkbox, and then your Google Talk messages will appear inside of Messages alongside your iMessages. AIM, Yahoo! and Jabber round out the other options; no Facebook yet.\nThere are a number of other routes to access your Messages and Contacts sources (namely via the iCloud preference pane or via the \"Accounts\" tabs present in each app's preferences) but Internet Accounts is the one-stop source for all of this. Each different route controls the same information, back here in the master source.\n\nA: I use the internet accounts (google contacts) and had to make sure icloud was off for contacts, then restarted the messages app and all the names/pics came back.\n\nA: I had this same issue and it turned out that I had to include the country code for each contact's phone number to get their name to show up in Messages. This may be an artefact of the Australian telecom I use, but to make it work I need to add +61 to each contact.\nI noticed this because the country code was included in the phone number that Messages was using instead of the name and thought it odd. Sure thing, when I change the corresponding number in contacts to match exactly what Messages was showing, the persons name and thumbnail image became viewable instantly.\nIn your case, it may be some other difference between the number your carrier shows and the number you have in your contact's details.\n\nA: The answer to my non-syncing contacts in iMessage was to ensure that the international dialling code is added to all of my contacts as this is what our local network (Vodacom) uses. The system then successfully matches the number the network uses with the number in my contacts and then displays the name and picture successfully. \nThank you for your help with this.\n\nA: I know how to fix this problem, just found out while looking for a solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Messages app in Mavericks \n\n*Click in Preferences, then select your iCloud account.\n\n*Over there you have to click in Details... \n\n*Login in your iCloud.\n\n*In Location change to your desired country code and save. \n\n\nA: Same thing was happening to me.  I opened \"Contacts\" on my Mac.  It said it could not access my Exchange contacts and I needed to input the password for my Exchange account. Once I did that all my contact names showed up in iMessage.\nApparently iMessage pulls contacts from the Mac \"Contacts\" and that needs access to the Exchange contacts.\n", "Q: How to share Mac audio over Skype with the microphone? System:  2011 iMac, built-in microphone, Mountain Lion.\nThis is a two part question.  First the more basic scenario, second the more-niche scenario that I hope to ultimately solve.\nI want to share my Mac audio over Skype, while still being able to simultaneously talk to the person on the other end of the call.  As of yet, every combination of options I have tried (dozens) involving Soundflower, aggregated devices, and even LineIn.app has completely failed.  \nSo firstly, what are the precise steps needed to get my Mac audio (say, youtube videos playing in a browser...) to transmit over Skype along WITH my voice from the built-in Mic?\nNow for the ultimate solution I hope to achieve.  I want to be able to collaborate musically with other parties, using a program called Reason from Propellerhead Software.  Reason has its own audio interface setting - a single setting for both input and output.  I use the Propellerhead's own audio interface called \"Balance\" as my audio device for the software, providing my physical I/O as well as a headphone mix.\nI want to be able to merge the audio output of Reason, along with my voice via the built-in mic of the Mac, and send them together over Skype so that the other person can hear what I'm doing in reasonable fidelity (subject to Skype's limitations, of course).\nCan anyone provide the exact steps to share Reason's audio along with my mic, over Skype?\nIf 3rd party software beyond SoundFlower/LineIn is required, I'm OK with that... though this should work with just SoundFlower even.  I even had it working a couple months ago but can't seem to replicate the result again.\n\nA: FWIW, after a lot of tinkering I solved this issue using Soundflower and the excellent Ladiocast application. Never looked back.\nSolution: \n\n\n*\n\n*install Soundflower from github, this gives you 2 new audio devices\n\n*install Ladiocast from the Mac AppStore\n\n*configure Skype to use the Soundflower (2ch) device as microphone, built-in speakers as output\n\n*start Ladiocast and select Soundflower (2ch) as Main Output\n\n*select the built-in microphone as Input 1, send to Main Output (using the buttons)\n\n*select Soundflower (64ch) as Input 2, send to Main Output\n\n*configure your Mac to send output through Soundflower (64ch) using System Preferences\n\n*if you want to listen to yourself, configure e.g. your headphones as Aux Output 1 and send both Inputs to it as well\n\n\nNow the other party will hear your Mac's audio plus your voice over the microphone. You can test this with Spotify and the echo123 Skype test service. Ladiocast must be running for this to work; quitting Ladiocast ends the sound links. \n\nA: Turns out I had some strange Core Audio driver issue.  Every time Skype was running, process \"coreaudiod\" would fire up and begin to hog CPU like crazy.  I fixed permissions on my boot volume and it fixed a bunch of stuff related to iTunes, which apparently also fixed whatever was going on.\nOnce the coreaudiod issue was resolved, here's the setup that is working perfectly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Skype \"microphone\" (input) set to Soundflower (2ch)\n\n*Aggregate Device created, consisting of Built-In Microphone and Soundflower (2 ch.)\n\n*Reason set to use the Aggregate Device\n\n*SoundflowerBed set to output to Balance.\n\n\nNow all I have to do is create an audio track and enable monitoring, and I can hear myself in the mic, while normal Reason audio flows out both to Skype and my Balance to my headphones, and all is well with the world.\n", "Q: What do I do if the disk image data is corrupted?

If it fails again, make sure that the download isn't being interrupted.\n\nIf you can obtain a checksum for the file, you can check it against your download by running openssl sha1 ~/path/to/download which will show the checksum for your download.

HFS+ (what you used) will hold the files, but it won't be recognized. You concluded this correctly.\nTry either NTFS or EXFAT. For NTFS formatting you will need a Windows or a current Linux system which can write to NTFS. Another alternative would be to install NTFS drivers with write permissions in your OS X setup, but I'd consider this the least preferred option.\nLong story cut short:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try formatting the drive as EXFAT and see if that works\n\n*Try formatting the drive as NTFS and writing the file within Windows or a modern Linux setup\n\n*Try splitting the file without re-encoding with special software.

I was running out space on the drive where I stored my iTunes media, because every time I opened iTunes, the application would immediately begin downloading TV shows I had purchased on my Apple TV.\nHow can you stop iTunes from downloading purchased TV shows whenever you open it?\nSee my answer below\nNote: Though it may or may not be entirely relevant to the problem (this bug has bit me across versions of iTunes and OS X), the bug was reproduced and eradicated using iTunes 11.1.3 under Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks\nPossibly related detail: I write possibly, because I've modified where my iTunes media lives outside of the iTunes defaults. \nThis is a common thing to do, when you realize the space on the meager 128 GB drive that came with your computer will no longer suffice. \nThis detail also warrants mentioning, because the use case deviates slightly from the norm, and pathing often emerges as the culprit in software-related bugs.\nAnother possibly related detail: I've moved the location of my iTunes media a couple of times, but didn't delete the old location's directory, which is also a parent directory of my current iTunes media location. I've been meaning to re-organize, but there were music files I didn't want to lose at the time I made to the decision to change the media location a second time. \nI mention this, because as a software engineer I've run into stupid bugs and relative vs. absolute path issues simply because a user chose to nest directories awkwardly or carelessly.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Ultimately, I was able to stop iTunes from automatically downloading TV shows with the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*With iTunes open select iTunes > Preferences... and click the Store tab\n\n*If checked, uncheck checkbox Always check for available downloads\n\n*If checked, uncheck checkbox Download pre-orders when available  \n\n*Click the OK button, and close iTunes\n\n*Remove the contents of your Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Downloads directory. You should be able to do that through Finder or by following these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Open Applications > Utilities > Terminal.app\n\n*Type rm -rf ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/Downloads/* then press <Enter>to delete the plist file along with all of the downloads of TV shows. (Note: this method removes the files permanently, which is fine since the next step re-downloads them.)\n\n\n*Re-open iTunes.

I want to pass my iPhone on to a friend. I backed up his old phone and restored it to the new one. After restarting it I see this:\n\nThis is the case, because I had \"Find my iPhone\" activated and did not deactivate it before restoring my friends backup.\nI followed the instructions of Find My iPhone Activation Lock: Removing a device from a previous owner’s account and removed the phone from my account, by opening icloud.com/#find and removing it.\nThe problem is, I can still not activate it. Neither with my Apple ID nor with the Apple ID of my friend. I hoped that the deletion and removal from my account would just might take some minutes or even hours, but 12 hours later, the problem still exists.\nAnything else I can try?\n\nA: You mention that you removed the phone from your Find my iPhone in iCloud, but then it can't be activated with anyone's Apple ID. Only the Apple ID that is shown on the page is the one that can be used to activate it. Once it is activated, you can use any Apple ID to register the iPhone and log in to iCloud.\nIn the screenshot above, only the Apple ID matching e•••••@gmail.com can be used to 'unlock' the phone. Make sure that this is the Apple ID that the device was removed from in Find my iPhone.\nOnce you have removed the phone from the relevant Find my iPhone account, try rebooting the phone. This should force the device to re-check Apple's servers for the Find my iPhone status of the device. If this fails, simply use the Apple ID that you removed the device from to activate it, then you can set it up normally.\n\nA: Restoring the iPhone did the trick. To restore the phone, you can follow the instructions in this KB article: iOS: Unable to update or restore. Afterwards, the activation worked fine.\nIf this doesn't fix your problem, you should make sure that your SIM card is neither \"sim locked\" nor \"net locked\".\n", "Q: Can I use my Macbook Pro Retina as extra monitor for my iMac through Thunderbolt I just bought a new late 2013 iMac and a new late 2013 Macbook Pro retina. Also bought an Apple thunderbolt cable.\nPressing CMD+F2 (enabling Apples \"Target Display Mode\") on my iMac lets me use the iMac as external monitor for the MB Pro, but I'd like it the other way around (which doesn't seem to work).\nDoes anyone know how I through Thunderbolt (for speed, am aware that apps like Air Display and Screen Recycler can do it through WiFi) so that my MB Pro becomes an extra external monitor for my iMac?\nWhile this question addresses this problem for earlier hardware and software, I'm looking for a solution that supports using a thunderbolt cable and works with late 2013 Macs with OS X Mavericks.\n\nA: If you really don't want to do it over the network, the retina MBP's display uses DisplayPort internally. You could disassemble your machine and use this pinout to connect it via Thunderbolt.\n\nA: Target Display Mode is right out since the hardware doesn't support it. What about using one of the networked applications (Air Display, Screen Recycler, etc) and running it over Thunderbolt instead of WiFi? If you have two Macs connected by a Thunderbolt cable, there's a Thunderbolt Bridge network interface that runs at 10Gbps, which might solve your speed problem.\nI don't have a TB cable to test with, but I believe the bridge is enabled by default and you should be able to just get the IP for it from Network Preferences (it should automatically pick something in the 169.254.x.y range). If the app you're using typically handles finding the server automatically, you might have to find the option to enter the IP manually to force it to run over the thunderbolt interface.\nHere's an example of someone using this. Note that only one of the Thunderbolt ports on each device might be usable for this purpose, so if the interface doesn't seem to be connected, try the other port.\n\nA: With Maverick you can set up the network accross Thunderbolt. Be sure both machines are Thunderbolt and make sure to add the \"Network\" interface in \"System Preferences\". Then you can use AirServer on the Retina but not sure the latency will be great (as sending the image using TCP)…\n\nA: According to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924, no. But it might be done with Screen Recycler. As far as I know, Apple has no official support for this.\n\nA: I was going to just leave a comment to existing answer, but I don't have enough reputation for that, so I'll just write it here.\nI'm running AirServer on my MacBook Pro, and I'm using it as a AirPlay monitor for my much more powerful hackintosh desktop.\nI can confirm that when using gigabit lan instead of wifi, performance goes up and latency goes down noticeably (it's still not as good as direct hdmi cable though)\nI've just purchased 2m thunderbolt cable and going to check if it will bring any improvement over gigabit lan.\nAnother option would be using USB3 HDMI capture card, like this one (haven't tried that myself yet)\nAlso Nexdock is about to release their generation 2 model, which hopefully will be exactly what we are waiting/looking for.\n\nA: If you want it so you can do KVM access to Mac mini then I suggest you look at \"Remote Desktop\".   Much more convenient than video target mode as you can have multiple VNC connections open simultaneously.\n", "Q: What are the recovery options from an encrypted Time Machine? Luckily, this hasn't happened yet, but I would like to make sure that I have a recovery option after my iMac would be stolen or lost in fire, etc.\nI have an iMac 27-inch, Late 2009, running OS X 10.9. File Vault is turned ON. Time Machine is set up, with encryption ON, on an external hard drive.\nSuppose I lose the iMac, but retain de external hard drive, what are my recovery options and how would I go about that?\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I access individual files on the Time Machine from a different Mac?\n\n*Can I buy a new iMac and migrate \"everything\" on the Time Machine to that new iMac? (Will \"everything\" include settings, software, keychain, etc.?)\n\n\nA: As far as I know, both can be answered with yes. Of course, you'll need the password you used encrypting the backup.\nAccessing individual files would work by clicking the Time Machine symbol in the menubar while holding alt and selecting something like \"Search other backup volumes\" (I'm from Germany so I don't know what it says exactly). Then you should search the backup like any other after you've entered the password.\nWhen you use migration on another Mac, everything should be copied (except for some machine specific files maybe).\n", "Q: Alternatives to purge command I read in a different thread (How to specify command to always run as root?) that using the purge command in Terminal to free memory is not a good idea. Does anyone know an alternative way to do this without installing third-party software? This is a curiosity based question, I don't mind if it's a complicated process, because I already have third-party software to clean memory. Thanks.\nEDIT (maybe I wasn't clear in my question):\nSometimes I want to speed up my Mac because too much memory is being used (for example immediately after closing a memory-consuming app). The question is: how would I quickly clean and retrieve memory to give to other tasks? Do I have to wait for the computer itself to do this or can I also do it manually?\n\nA: The problem is with clearing inactive memory in the first place, regardless of which command is used to do it.\n\nIndeed, using purge is \"not a good idea\" but the problem is due to what the end result of the command is rather than how the command does it or other specific problem due to the command.\nRunning purge attempts to clear inactive memory. An 'alternative' command would not be any better than running purge, providing it does the same thing.\nThis excellent answer explains the reasoning behind inactive memory in more detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Isn't Inactive memory a waste of resources?\n", "Q: How to access gmail via pop instead of imap in mail.app in mavericks I have a fresh install of mavericks. For reasons relating to my own workflow I would like to access my gmail via mail.app using pop instead of IMAP (I prefer to store only what I need on my mac but never delete anything from gmail).\nHowever mail.app seems to have become too clever for this now, and automatically identifies my account as gmail and sets it up with IMAP even when I try to set it up a second time with pop.\nHow do I get mail to let me configure a pop account for gmail? Or has mail not been simplified to the point of removing this basic configurability?\n\nA: The magic Option key again: when you are setting up an account, don't click on Create, but hold down the Option key and the button will change to Next - where you can continue to IMAP or POP, and it is recommended even with IMAP that you set up Google not as a Google account but through this, the last, unbranded choice in the Internet Accounts preference pane.\nI have some hope this info will be used in the other zillion questions on the same subject.\n\nA: Just \"add other mail another account\" and instead of imap.google.com use pop.google.com as Mail server. \n \n\nA: You will need port 995 for the POP server rather than port 993 for the IMAP server.\n\nA: The Option key trick is not working for some people — but what is, is to add not a new Google account, in Internet Preferences Pane, but just \nAdd Account - at bottom of list. \nThe idea is to get past Google's immediate assumption you are setting up IMAP. Not easy, but can be done. \nIf you've already attempted this, start again with POP by moving the contents of the Mail folder out of ~/Library/Mail/ for now. That mail can always be Imported later, in Mail, as can any Mailbox from anywhere. A pain to sort, but that's what Apple intends.\n\nA: Well, doing all this (option does work for me), and I have tried the default ports and the suggested ones.\nI always get an \"Unknown error has occurred\" at the last step/dialogue.\n", "Q: Change Terminal Theme for Developing I just got an iMac and wanted to change the default terminal to, what i believe, is a theme.\nI saw it a while ago and i'm not finding it.\nScreenshot below.\n\nYou can find a video from Yeoman using it here\n\nA: The closest I've found is the Steeef theme for oh-my-zsh.

Is this a bug or  some kind of device limitation that prevents Hangout on the Ipad Mini? we already downloaded all the updates both on the iPad mini and the Apple TV console. Our Apple Tv/ Hangout setup does work on the same rig when we use a Mac Mini computer.\nMany thanks\n\nA: I googled around for it, but all I found was this question asked with the same words on other fora.\nThe second link has someone giving the answer I thought likely: the app disallows AirPlay. Some app makers don't want you to watch their iOS content on your TV. HBO Go was a notable example, but they updated their app to allow AirPlay streaming to AppleTV in February 2013 (see here). While I can't find any documentation that the Google Hangout iOS app does not allow AirPlay, the behavior you describe is at least consistent with that hypothesis.\n", "Q: iMovie 10 (Mavericks): Altering the duration of imported pictures (stills) In earlier versions of iMovie, you could relatively easily import still pictures and alter their duration to create slide show. However, in the latest release, iMovie 10, this ability seems to have disappeared or at least moved. If I import a series of pictures (PDF format), I can use 'Adjust' to see a duration of the form '1.0 s of 0.9 s'. I can type in the '1.0' part but not the '0.9' part, and changes are not reflected in the movie.

You have \"Disk Utility\" 13.\n\nWhere shall I find Disk Utility suitable for Mavericks? Is there any other easy procedure to empty my EHD?\n\nA: It appears that Disk Utility.app has been replaced by an incorrect version, or you are attempting to open a Disk Utility from a different installation of OS X. Make sure that you are opening Disk Utility from /Applications/Utilities and not from any other volume.\nYou can replace Disk Utility by re-installing OS X, which will replace all Apple apps in /Applications with new versions from the installation media.\nAlternatively, you can use a Time Machine backup or other backup media to obtain a replacement copy of Disk Utility.\nIf you have a second computer with exactly the same version of OS X, you can copy it from that computer into the same location on the first computer.

I use Dvorak for my day-to-day work, however I find that Microsoft's Remote Desktop application doesn't play very nicely with this: if I connect to an existing session it will use whatever keymap was in place before (usually US), but if I connect and it logs in a new session, it will set the keymap to dvorak which affects other users if they log in! \nIt would be nice if Microsoft could make it not break, but I don't see that happening any time soon. Meanwhile, is it possible to set a keymap for a particular application? I've tried the option Automatically switch to a document's input source, but this doesn't seem to have any noticeable effect.\n\nA: I've found a better way of dealing with things than setting a keyboard layout per app, and this is with the excellent Karabiner keyboard customiser.\nSimply set the system keyboard to QWERTY, and enable the Karabiner option 'QWERTY to Dvorak'. The only caveat is you have to remember to log in with QWERTY as Karabiner can only start once you have logged in.\n\nA: I think the app AutoKeyboard may offer this function:\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/51829/autokeyboard\n", "Q: Which iPhone 5s sold in the US is better to use in spain? Specially for LTE use I'm planning a visit to New York and I'm wanted to buy a new iPhone 5s unlocked but someone has told me that if I'm going to use it in Spain I might have problems to use LTE. Does anyone know if that's true? It's a problem with the LTE bands used in the US ans in Spain. Or so they say...\n\nA: Short answer: Get the A1457 model.\nYou can see the different models and their verified compatibilities here. According to the site, iPhone 5s model A1457 has the support for the LTE bands which are used in most of Europe, while A1453 and A1533 have support for the most common LTE bands in the US. I don't know if the A1457 model is sold that much in the US since it supports only two US-based carriers, but if you can find it, it willl work.\n", "Q: Sync iOS iBooks to OS X iBooks Is there a way to sync the iBooks that were not purchased from iTunes on my iOS device with my OS X iBooks? Specifically, I have some PDFS I'd like to sync.\nPlease note I am seeking to synchronize the books themselves, not just highlights and notes.\n\nA: I have a similar problem. Non-iBook store epubs don't sync with iOS devices, no matter what options are switched on/off.\nLooking at the directory they're now stored on in Mavericks (~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books), they seem to have been converted to a different format (from .epub to a folder with xml/html files), and i suspect that's why they don't sync.\nAny suggestions on how to sync these would be most appreciated!\nEDIT: To answer my own question, check that iTunes is actually syncing all books. It had changed my previous preference to selected books, and preferentially un-ticked all non-iBook store epubs. Changing that fixed the syncing problem for me...\n\nA: You absolutely can sync notes and highlights for ePubs not purchased from iTunes when using iBooks on your Mac and iOS devices.\nHere is how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Place your not-purchased ePubs in iBooks on your Mac.\n\n*Connect your iOS device to your Mac.\n\n*Open iTunes.\n\n*Select your iOS device in the left column.\n\n*Click Books.\n\n*Choose All Books or Selected Books.\n\n*Click Apply to copy the books to your iOS device.\n\n*Repeat steps 2 to 7 for other iOS devices.\n\n*Enable notes and highlights syncing for iBooks on your Mac and each iOS device.\n\n*Make notes and highlights in any of the ePubs you have copied from iBooks on your Mac to your iOS devices. These notes and highlights sync to all other devices.\n\n\nIt is very important to use the same version of the book on you Mac and all of your iOS devices. You cannot download an ePub from Gutenberg to your Mac and then download it again to your iOS device and expect notes and highlights to sync. That probably won't happen. If you think it through, this makes sense because iBooks needs to know for sure which files to use for syncing and file name alone is too imprecise.\n\nA: There are two ways to synchronize your own eBooks/PDFs between iBooks on the Mac and iBooks on an iOS device.\n\n\n*\n\n*using iTunes\n\n*using iCloud\n\n\nShort answer: synchronising own eBooks/PDFs doesn't work when iCloud synchronising is turned on on the Mac but not on the iOS device.\nLong answer and my experience:\nProblem 1: my own eBooks/PDFs were not visible in iTunes\nReason: on the Mac -> System preferences -> iCloud -> iCloud Drive there is a checkmark for iBooks.app.\nWhen this checkmark is checked, iTunes is no longer responsible to synchronise own eBooks/PDFs. \nProblem 2: I didn't get my own eBooks/PDFs in my iPad/iPhone\nReason: I did not have the iCloud Drive App from Apple on my iPad.\nAfter downloading the iCloud Drive App, there are a few new options in the iOS preferences:\nPreferences -> iCloud ->\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Drive\n\n*iBooks\n\n*and many more\n\n\nThis iBooks option is not available, when the iCloud Drive App is not installed and turned on.\nAfter turning on the iClod Drive option and (after a few seconds) the iBooks option and then starting iBooks, iBooks will ask if you want to use iCloud.\nAfter saying yes, all the own eBooks and PDFs are available for download one by one and controlled from th iOS device.\n\nA: On OS X copying files from the container below will copy the books from your library.\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books\n\nTo copy the Highlights and Notes you did, you need to copy the files from\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iBooksX/Data/Documents/AEAnnotation\n\n\nA: I found a simple way to transfer PDFs from iBooks to any  computer, or app you have on your iDevice... However, you must be jailbroken for this to work.\nHere's how:\nIn Cydia, download and install a file manager like \"Filza\" (it's in the BigBoss repo) \n\n\n*\n\n*Note: your iDevice might respring once installed\n\n\n\nSolution A) To your computer: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Filza\n\n*Click settings icon in the right top corner and enable WebDAV server. \n\n*Open a browser on your computer and navigate to the address given by Filza\n\n*You will find a file manager / ftp like solution. Navigate to \"/var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases\" and download pdf files.\n\nSolution B) To another app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Filza and navigate to \"/var/mobile/Media/Books/Purchases\" without quotes.  \n\n*Long press on the file, select \"Open in\" option that appears and select your app of choice. \nNormally it will either copy or link the file to your application. If it's linked , then the original file will stay where it was.\n\n\n*Alternatively, assuming you use Filza, you can select \"Move\" (or copy). Then press on the Favorites (star) icon, and tap on \"Apps Manager\". Find the app of your liking in the list that follows and tap on it.\n\n*Enter the \"Documents\" folder that you will find, and paste file there. \n(Note: sometimes I experience the required folder is called \"Inbox\")\n\n*Open the app, and start reading. \nIt's really simple and faster than syncing through iTunes.  \n", "Q: From Mavericks to Snow Lion: how to get back?

Is it possible to reinstall Snow Lion and use Time Machine to place all date files back or am I going to be in trouble here?\nAdded: I meant Mountain Lion (in stead of Snow Lion -- sorry ;-))\n\nA: There is no \"Snow Lion\"—Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion strike me as possibilities—but regardless, the answer is the same: you can roll back with your Time Machine to an earlier version of OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter Recovery by rebooting and holding command+R.\n\n*Select \"Restore from a Time Machine backup\".\n\n*Select a backup from before your Mavericks upgrade.\nUnfortunately, you may not be able to use all of today's data from a pre-Mavericks installation.  Some Mavericks applications (such as Mail.app) will upgrade their databases.  That data will not be able to be understood by pre-Mavericks versions of those applications.  If you haven't had any significant data changes since your upgrade, I would recommend a wholesale reversion back to your preferred OS.

Installation of spidermonkey is successful, however, it appears to be incompatible with the installation of jslint.  Consequently, jslint is not installed.\nProblem Description in Detail:\nWhen I tried to install jslint, it successfully installed its dependency, spidermonkey, however, failed to install jslint.  Below is the error message that was returned, which I copied and pasted from the log that was produced.\n:debug:configure configure phase started at Mon Nov 11 13:31:53 EST 2013\n:notice:configure --->  Configuring jslint\n:debug:configure Using compiler 'Xcode Clang'\n:debug:configure Executing org.macports.configure (jslint)\n:error:configure You need to install spidermonkey with the +fileobject variant in order to use jslint.\n:error:configure org.macports.configure for port jslint returned: incompatible spidermonkey installation\n:debug:configure Error code: NONE\n:debug:configure Backtrace: incompatible spidermonkey installation\n    while executing\n\"$procedure $targetname\"\n:info:configure Warning: targets not executed for jslint: org.macports.activate org.macports.configure org.macports.build org.macports.destroot org.macports.install\n:notice:configure Please see the log file for port jslint for details:\n    /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_ports_lang_jslint/jslint/main.log\n\nThis is a problem that has been reported to the MacPorts project, however, closed due to it being 'invalid'.  See the following link.\nhttp://trac.macports.org/ticket/37053\nSo, my question is, how do I go about installing spidermonkey with the +fileobject variant in order to install and use jslint?  Furthermore, is there a way to configure macports so I don't have to do this each time I try to upgrade my macports?\nAny advice/suggestions on how to resolve this would be appreciated.\n\nA: If you don't have spidermonkey installed, use sudo port install jslint +fileobject. If you already have it installed, you need to rebuild it with the +fileobject variant: sudo port upgrade --enforce-variants spidermonkey +fileobject and re-try installing jslint.\n", "Q: Apple Mail send only account I have two accounts, a gmail one and a school email address. I want to be able to send emails from my school address and gmail, but receive only from the gmail one (the gmail and school email accounts are synced together so I don't want to get duplicates). is there any way to make only the receive section of an account offline in Mail.app? I'm using OS X 10.9 Mavericks, if that helps. I already turned off automatic receiving for my school email, but if I hit \"get mail\" all the email from that account gets fetched anyway.\n\nA: Set up a new empty email box (perhaps with server side quota or rules to delete all mail immediately upon receipt).\nEnter those credentials as a new account in Mail.app and end the sending credentials and server for this shell account. \nNow you can send from the account you want and have no emails coming in. \n\nA: After tests, I think the least buggy method for Apple's bad implementation is setup gmail with pop3 method in Mac Mail.app and set rules to delete all incoming emails.\nThere are no rules for iPhone but we can turn off auto fetching.\n", "Q: OS X Desktop PSD?

Any idea how?\nPS:\nI should mention that I am not talking about iMessage but the Messages chat application that lets you interface with gtalk, yahoo messenger etc.\n\nA: Two ways to do this.\nFirst, if you have messages set up in notifications, then you'll get your messages even if Messages is closed (and you can send messages from the notifications as well).\nSecond, if you actually want to launch Messages at login, add Messages to your Login Items list in the User & Groups system preference.\n\n\nA: Uncheck the \"When I quit messages set my status to offline\" box in Messages preferences.\nYour status will be set to Available next time you log in and/or unlock your computer.\n\n", "Q: Is Java 6 on Mavericks safe to use? I have some web applications (java applets) which have trouble running with Java 7 and java 64 bit.\nThe tech support wants me to install Java 6 and disable Java 7, here are the instructions:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Please download and install the Java update named \"JavaForOSX2013-05.dmg\" from Apple for better security. For OS X 10.7 and above: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572\n  \n*After that, please follow the instructions below to re-enable the Apple-provided Java SE 6 web plug-in and Web Start functionality: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5559\n\nSecurity-wise, is it safe to setup OS X this way? \n\nA: Nothing is safe in security terms, all that you can say is that there is a risk and try to quantify it.\nFor Java there are often exploits for Java applets and at some time Apple found that they and Oracle could not produce a fix quick enough to stop a well known exploit. Apple then put out a change to Safari to block all Java applets if the Java version was below a given version and this version limit is increased regularly.\nThe latest Apple-provided Java installer as of 17 Oct 2014 is Java for OS X 2014-001. It fixes the vulnerabilities listed here by providing a version of Java version 1.6.0_65.\nAlso see this answer\nThere will be vulnerabilities in that but Apple have so far decided none of those known to them are serious enough to block the use of this version or produce a new version.\n", "Q: What is the recommended way to set up and run an OS X web server for a busy public website? I am moving from a VPS to a dedicated Mac mini server running Mavericks. All I want to do is serve a typical website using Apache, an nginx reverse proxy, PHP and MySQL.\nMy website isn't gigantic, but it's not tiny either: I typically serve a hundred thousand pageviews a day. It is a public site on the internet, not a local intranet. I am familiar with tweaking .conf files and fiddling in the terminal, but the idea of creating virtualhosts and manually setting up modules stretch my abilities.\nI have had difficulty finding the right software solution for this task. From what I can tell, there are three basic ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the inbuilt Apache provided by Apple and managed in Server.app. The configuration options are limited and certain advanced aspects (including using nginx, or anything much involving security) are not covered.\n\n*Use Homebrew or plain old .tar.gz files to set up my own server, treating the OS X like any old Unix. While this would work, I am hoping OS X can help me avoid the quagmire of editing config files entirely on my own.\n\n*Using Mac software like MAMP or AMPPS, though both of these appear to be outdated or unsupported, and seem geared towards local testing rather than production server use.\n\n\nI would like to know of the best way to set up a Mac mini as a \"real\" web server, ideally with a solution that is both easy to configure and open to. Is there a well-known tutorial that I can follow? What of the alternate software recommended by this months-old article which ultimately recommended AMPPS, albeit for local testing?\n\nA: For my own outward-facing servers, I did everything from within the built-in server software itself, except managing virtual hosts, for which task I used VirtualHostX.\nThe best tutorial I know for configuring Mavericks for web server use is done by Charles Edge, at his site, Krypted. I followed this same process essentially, and thus far, I've seen no issues since deployment.\n\nA: OS X have Apache. This is a pretty standard build, so you should be able to configure it to do just about anything you'd like. If you want to do this you may need to read up on apache configuration and such. There are numerous tutorials all over the place for setting up virtual hosts, etc.\nHere's a walkthrough for setting up a server in Mountain Lion which is mostly similar in Mavericks: http://mwholt.blogspot.com/2013/03/install-nginxphpmysql-on-os-x-mountain.html \nYou could also just splurge on the OS X Server. It might not provided everything you are looking for out of the box, but it does make a number of administration task (including virtual servers) quite easy.\n", "Q: MacBook pro boot Kernel panic no kext summary Yesterday my Mac crashed and after trying to turn it on again I recieved a message like this:\n\npanic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff800667b0b2): \"VM page 0xffffff800ad5fad0 should not have an error\\n\"@SourceCache/xnu/xnu-2422.1.72/osfmk/vm/vm_kern.c:457\n  Debugger called:\n  Backtrace(CPU 0), Frame : Return Address\n  ...\n  ...\n  ...\n  Can't perform kext scan: no kext sumaryczny\n  BSD proces name corresponding to current thread: unknown\nMac version:\n  Not yet set\nKernel version:\n  Darvin Kernel Version 13.0.0: thu sept 19 22:22:27 pdt 2013; root:xnu-2422.1.72~6/release_x86_64\n  Kernel UUID: ...\n  Kernel slide: 0x0000000006400000\n  Kernel test base: 0xffffff8006600000\nSystem uptime in nanoseconds: 0\n\nAnd I know there is a similar post and a good answer to that.\nI can't access Recovery HD.

I use hot corners to lock my screen/start the screensaver.  I've also recently started playing some games on Steam that run in fullscreen on Mavericks.\nUnfortunately, since the mouse cursor is used to control movement, use of hot corners basically makes the games unplayable.\nIs there an easy way to toggle hot corners on and off before and after playing games in fullscreen?\nI used to use this script but it doesn't work on Mavericks.\n\nA: This is a quite old question, but I stumbled on it looking for the same thing (although on ML). The script looks interesting, but it's a bit far-fetched for me, I was looking for something simpler and preferably without add-ons.\nThis is what I found and works for me: in the hot corner's pref pane, hold Command, Option, Control and/or Shift after clicking a drop down list of a hot corner and you can add one or any combination of the modifier keys to a hot corner trigger. This way, they only work if and when you hold that(those) key(s) which you probably won't during a game, or any full screen app.\nI'm pretty sure this works on all OS X versions.\n", "Q: Logitech Mouse: how can I use additional buttons? I recently bought a Logitech M560 mouse.\nIt works fine on my Mac, but I wonder if there's a software/prefpane (free or paid) I can use to map the additional buttons I have on my mouse (i.e. to open dashboard, select line, etc...)\nLogitech at the moment offers no support for Mac for this model (I was aware of this when I bought the mouse)\n\nWithout any configuration the bottom side button works as \"Add bookmark\" in Chrome, so I think I can do something for this...\n\nA: According to an answer on a similar question, it's possible to use a program called Karabiner to detect the Logitec Windows-specific keyboard events sent by the M560, and translate them to regular keyboard or mouse button events that tools such as BetterTouchTool can pick up on.\nPlease see the original answer on the duplicate question for full details, including a Karabiner configuration file for the M560.\n\nA: Thanks to the previous answers, I have successfully used BetterTouchTool to map three different buttons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Usign \"Normal Mice\" tab:\n\n*\n\n*Button 3 (Wheel Left)\n\n*Button 4 (Wheel right)\n\n\n*Usign \"Keyboard\" tab:\n\n*\n\n*cmd + D (Back), which I assigned to \"Middle click\".\n\n\n\nTwo buttons remain unmappable (Forward and Middle click), but it is better than nothing. Hope that it will fit to your needs.\n\nA: If you're interested in using the side buttons for navigation, I made an open-source menu bar utility called SensibleSideButtons that solves this problem. Instead of binding the side buttons to keyboard shortcuts like most of the other programs mentioned here, mine instead binds them to virtual left and right swipe gestures. This approach offers several benefits: almost universal adoption across the OS (including Xcode), avoidance of destructive behavior, no menu bar blink or annoying noises, commands only sent to the specific window under your cursor.\n(This assumes that your side buttons emit standard M4 and M5 events.)\n\nA: I've used Steermouse in the past with excellent results.\n\nA: I made Mac Mouse Fix. \nIt lets you remap your Side Buttons to Windows-style Back and Forward (just like Sensible Side Buttons - in fact, I copied their code) or to Switching Spaces. It also features a refined Smooth-Scrolling algorithm, which I think strikes a great balance between fluidity and control, and more.\nMac Mouse Fix is very light on system resources and it's a System Preferences Plugin so there's no status bar item. I tried to make it as clutter-free as possible.\nOn top of that, it's 100% free, it doesn't sell your data or anything, it's lightweight, easy-to-use, and fully open source. \nI really hope that you'll find Mac Mouse Fix useful!\nDownload | Github\n\nA: I have used USB Overdrive\n\nThe USB Overdrive is a device driver for Mac OS X that handles any USB\n  mouse / trackball / joystick / gamepad / media keyboard and any\n  Bluetooth mouse from any manufacturer and lets you configure them\n  either globally or on a per-application, per-device basis. Note that\n  the Apple Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad are not handled by the USB\n  Overdrive to let Mac OS X implement its full multitouch support.\n\nWorked really well .\n\nA: BetterTouchTool\nBetterTouchTool will allow you to map mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts or predefined actions. Simply click in the area with the button that you want to map, select a modifier key if you wish, then choose a keyboard shortcut or predefined action to map.\n\n\nA: Hammerspoon is another free open source versatile tool that may be used to map the keys on the mouse to different functions - with many other options/plugins (known as 'Spoons') available. You'll need to install the tool and supply it with some appropriate config - see examples here for mouse remapping. Here is an example config that remaps the Logitech Marble mouse right mini-button(4) to as a Middle click(2):\nhs.eventtap.new({4,25,26},\n    function(e)\n        local pressedMouseButton = e:getProperty(hs.eventtap.event.properties['mouseEventButtonNumber'])\n        if pressedMouseButton == 4 then\n           mousepos = hs.mouse.getAbsolutePosition()\n           hs.eventtap.event.newMouseEvent(e:getType(),mousepos):setProperty(hs.eventtap.event.properties.mouseEventButtonNumber, 2):post()\n        end\n    end\n):start() \n\n", "Q: How do you hide specific or certain calendars in the Mavericks Calendars (iCal) App? I have multiple calendars from different services like Gmail, iCloud, etc.  All the calendars together take up too much room to view in the year view of the Calendars app. Also, some calendars are for a specific purpose and I do not want them to display with my \"main\" calendar listing all the time.  How can I selectively turn on and off individual calendars?\n\nA: Follow this procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the calendars app\n\n*The default view when first setup hides the calendar listing pane. I am not sure if previous versions hid it by default also.\n\n*Click View --> Show Calendar List\n\n*A list of all calendars tied to your accounts will appear. Each calendar name has a checkbox next to it.  Just uncheck the ones that you do not want to display. \n\n\n \nAlso you might see some duplicate entries - for example in holidays.  One way this can occur is if you have a Google Holidays calendar and you also have the Apple Holiday calendar checked - you will see both. Just uncheck one of them to fix this.\n", "Q: Increasing The Size Of The Mouse Pointer In OS X Mavericks?

I attempt to delete the event and it comes right back.\n\nA: You do not have to delete a contact's birthday to remove it from Calendar--unless it is the only birthday you want to remove. You can subscribe/unsubscribe to birthdays to allow them to show in Calendar.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*In iCloud Calendar, click the Action pop-up menu  in the sidebar, then choose Preferences.  \n  \n*In the General pane, select “Show Birthdays calendar,” then click Save.\n  \n*Show or hide the Birthdays calendar by turning it on or off in the Subscriptions section of the Calendars sidebar.  \n  \n\nThis will show all birthdays that have been added to your Contacts. If you want to show the other birthdays and important dates (as you can also add anniversaries and such) and exclude just one birthday, then you will have to remove that date from the contact's 'birthday' field.\n\nTo modify a birth date, use iCloud Contacts; changes are reflected in iCloud Calendar within a day.\n\nI have a few contacts where, instead of deleting their birthday altogether, I have moved their birthdays from the designated field and into the Notes field--no information lost and no reminders or Calendar events.\n\nA: I had the same problem, what I ended up doing was changing the event type you click the event and click on calendar then change the calendar color (purple to yellow, etc). Then go into the calendars menu from the main calendar page and disable that color. Tedious but it worked for me.\n\nA: It may be due to a contact having a birthday, in which case the simplest thing to do would be to go to your contact on the phone and remove their birthday.\n\nA: I had the same problem. It's via birthdays free app and will it be removed after uninstallation.\n\nA: Something called 'Lone's birthday' suddenly appeared on my calendar and I couldn't delete it. When the birthday date finally arrived I went into birthday calendar edit and deleted it and all future notifications then.

I get messages when syncing my iPod that tell me that a song cannot be copied because I am not authorised to play them.\nIs there a quick way to find all songs that are like this and delete them?\n\nA: First, why not authorise your computer?

But I think XQuartz doesn't launch within that environment, so it never sees it until it is too late.\n\nA: I am having a similar issues (related to R documentation), which boil down to the same thing.\nFrom an XQuartz window, if you right click (or CTRL r-click) to get to the VT fonts menu, then select UTF8-fonts and UTF8-encoding, this will probably fix your problem.\nHowever, I have not yet found a way to configure these by default, although I have found this:\n$ appres XTerm | grep UTF\n*fontMenu*utf8-mode*Label:      UTF-8 Encoding\n*fontMenu*utf8-fonts*Label:     UTF-8 Fonts\n*fontMenu*utf8-title*Label:     UTF-8 Titles\n\nI took a wild stab in the dark and added this to my .Xdefaults:\nxterm*utf8-mode: 1\nxterm*utf8-fonts: 1\n\nUnsuprisingly this did not work, since these 2 resources don't exist.\nI'm still looking for a way to turn it on by default.\n", "Q: securityd using 100% CPU and polluting system.log Since I upgraded to Mavericks, I often have the following processes using full CPU power:\n\n\n*\n\n*securityd\n\n*syslogd\n\n*kernel_task\nI guess securityd contains a bug, because it is polluting /var/log/system.log with thousands of messages per second, and the system can not follow up.\nHere is an example of messages I get:\nNov 11 15:55:10 localhost securityd[22]: assertion failed: 13A603: libxpc.dylib + 44365 [4554927A-9467-365C-91F1-5A116989DD7F]: 0x13\nNov 11 16:14:47 --- last message repeated 1 time ---\nNov 11 15:55:10 localhost securityd[22]: assertion failed: 13A603: libxpc.dylib + 26642 [4554927A-9467-365C-91F1-5A116989DD7F]: 0x13\nNov 11 16:14:47 --- last message repeated 1 time ---\nNov 11 15:55:10 localhost securityd[22]: assertion failed: 13A603: libxpc.dylib + 44365 [4554927A-9467-365C-91F1-5A116989DD7F]: 0x13\nNov 11 16:14:47 --- last message repeated 1 time ---\nNov 11 15:55:10 localhost securityd[22]: assertion failed: 13A603: libxpc.dylib + 26642 [4554927A-9467-365C-91F1-5A116989DD7F]: 0x13\nNov 11 16:14:47 --- last message repeated 1 time ---\n\nI believe this is a critical issue, as it makes Mac OS X is extremely slow and unresponsive.\nKilling securityid doesn't help. The process is recreated, and keeps polluting syslogd.\nIf I reboot the entire system, everything seems ok for a while, before the same issue happens again. I didn't figured out what triggers this issue yet.\n\nA: In my case, the haywire securityd process was caused by GitHub desktop app - during commit, network issues caused an error in ssh handshake. Subsequent commits went fine. GitHub app was left open, securityd was heating up my CPU. Quitting GitHub app fixed the problem - probably terminating something in securityd. So my guess is, securityd has some infinite loop issue during crypto operations, maybe just with ssh and handshakes.\nSo, check if and how your daily workflow can trigger securityd (logging into server? github?) and isolate the problem.\n\nA: I have the same problem with securityd occupying high CPU on a Mac, it's caused by Source Tree credentials in Keychain Access. Removing the login data of SourceTree in KeyChain restored my CPU usage back to normal levels.\n\nA: You can temporarily alleviate the problem by restarting SecurityAgent using the following terminal command:\nsudo killall SecurityAgent\n\nThis worked each time for me. I am still investigating the root cause.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this was triggered by switching to another user account where I'd had to reset the password as I'd forgotten the original password. This caused multiple Keychain failures (original password required to unlock the Keychain) and I got an 'endless loop' of prompts along the lines of 'Apple Messages Agent wants to use the item 'login' from your keychain..'\n\nA: I'm seeing the same exact problem for the second time in a row within a week with the exact same messages in the console.\nFor me, rebooting usually solves the problem (first time I had to force shutdown as machine was unresponsive). And like you, I have yet to find the trigger that starts the messages.\nThe activity monitor is not the culprit, I am usually alerted by the fan going crazy, so then I start the activity monitor just to see both syslogd and securityd using about 90% of CPU. \n\nA: Troubleshooting the actual cause may be problematic since XPC is a generic inter-process communication protocol and only loads on demand. The Apple software uses this subsystem as can any third party program - so it could be Apple's fault or it could be something you are running and the main problem is you don't have an easy way to know which program is causing the heavy logging load (and perhaps a heavy legitimate workload as well as just logging).\n\nI agree that any diagnostic logging that is so rapid and uncontrollable as to affect either the energy usage of the computer or the performance of the computer noticeably should be considered a fault.\nThe most productive way to address that is actually to document the problem and report this as a bug to Apple.\nMavericks has done a stellar job at exposing both the diagnostic tools and the energy usage over time of all processes to the interested end user.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Energy Saver, select Energy and sort by Avg Energy Impact -  snap a picture of the window it processes the last day's usage logs.\n\n*Select the CPU view, search for securityd, select it in the list of active tasks and then \"Run System Diagnostics...\" either from the View menu or the gear in the toolbar.\n\n*Send both the picture and the compressed diagnostics report to Apple at https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/\nYou will need an AppleID that is associated with some sort of developer account, so you can sign up as a Safari developer for free if you don't already have an account that is enabled for reporting specific bugs to Apple.\n\nA: I created a VM using virtualBox and this issue is somewhat recreateable.  I have created some keychain items and when I visit the website that the keychain item is for, the VM hangs for a good 1-2min, then frees up.  It may be git-osxkeychain-helper causing the securityd process to eat the whole cpu.\n\nA: I solved the issue by following:\n\n*\n\n*Open Activity Monitor\n\n*Force quit securityd\n\n*Enter the password of ssh key like the image\n\n*Uncheck Store password in keychain\n\n*Click Ok\n\nHope to help you!\n\n\nA: I think this may be a bug much older than Mavericks. I'm not sure I was having the same problem as you because I never checked my syslog, but I did have securityd eating up CPU and RAM. I used an old solution from 2007 (for Leopard?).\ntldr: \nsudo mv /var/db/CodeEquivalenceDatabase /var/db/CodeEquivalenceDatabase.old\nthen restart. Feel free to delete the old file afterwards, as OS X automatically creates a new one.\n\nA: Seems to have something to do with keychain manager.

I tried downloading certain programs listed in other answers, but they did not pick up iMac 2.\n\nA: You'll also likely need to turn your keyboard off/back on and make it discoverable.\nSee:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1809\nfor a complete walk-through, but to be safe, turn off first mac, off keyboard, then back on while searching on the second Mac (using bluetooth control panel)\nAlternately, instead of fully turning off the first Mac, you could just turn off its Bluetooth, which is much faster.

However in traditional Unix/Linux fashion you can set up your path statement to check /usr/local/bin first, thus utilities installed there (default for homebrew) will be used before /usr/bin (or /bin).

I had opened sharing to everyone on my Mac as a \"temporary\" experiment to exchange files with another Mac. I forgot, and later that night when I went to shut down, the Mac reported that 2 users were connected. \nIs there a log to see who those users were? I assume one was me given my experiment. But the other? \n\nA: The file sharing protocol AFP used by OS X does not log access per default. While (at least for OS X Server) reporting to a log file can be activated before starting file sharing, it is quite a \"chatty\" log process (meaning it generates huge, meaningless log files easily).\nTo put it simple: No, there's no way to find out who accesses your Mac beside yourself after file sharing ended.\n", "Q: How can I buy an unlocked iPhone 5s in the US? My parents are on holiday in the US now, and they were supposed to buy me an iPhone 5s to use in Norway. But they were told in the store that they couldn't buy an unlocked iPhone 5s.\nIs this true or have they misunderstood? iPhone 5s is beeing sold unlocked in Norway, so I just couldn't understand why not in the US?\n\nA: It is up to Apple to decide when and where unlocked iPhones are sold. Currently in the U.S., Apple does not explicitly state that it sells unlocked iPhone 5s - the Apple online store page for iPhone 5s does not mention unlocked phones, unlike the Apple online store in say, Canada.\nHowever, buying directly from Apple and choosing T-Mobile as the carrier means paying the full price, and it may be unlocked (do not purchase from T-Mobile). See this thread titled  iPhone 5s purchased from Apple is not unlocked on the T-Mobile forums for more information. After buying the T-Mobile option from Apple, if it seems locked, activate it with T-Mobile and request T-Mobile for an unlock.\nAlso note that all unlocked iPhone 5s models sold on Amazon and elsewhere are probably from other countries since the pricing is a lot higher (which may be an indication that it's not easy to get unlocked iPhone 5s in the U.S.).\n\nA: You can get unlocked iPhones online in the US from various resellers via Amazon. You can even buy unlocked iPhones directly from Apple.\n\nA: Officially you can now:\nThe 16GB version of the newly-released flagship handset will set you back $649, the 32GB costs $749, and the costliest model is the 64GB variant, for which you will need to pony up $849.\nGSM is the standard in Europe, so if you frequent this territory, the GSM model is definitely for you. Moreover, it will work in the US with the likes of AT&T and T-Mobile, so you needn’t worry about encountering any issues whilst in the USA.\nSource.\nSee the Official US Apple Store for more details.\n\nA: All US Verizon iPhones are unlocked by default, so you can purchase from Verizon and then put in a Norwegian SIM card and it should work just fine.\n", "Q: Cover flow doesn't update after I delete a file I have a folder with images. I'm viewing it in cover flow mode. After I delete an item, the preview stays the same and no longer reflects the currently highlighted item. Is this a bug, is there a quick way to force a refresh?\n\nA: This is a bug, at least in Mavericks. I've filed a bug report with Apple.

OS Version is 10.9. I'm using a trackpad connected to the bluetooth.  All of the sudden, and at random times, my trackpad will lose its connection and will not reconnect.  When this happens, I pull up the Bluetooth preferences and I see:\n<< do not localize >...\nName not available\n\nBluetooth will not turn off at all. Nothing can connect to bluetooth once this happens.  I have to do a hard reboot of my laptop to get bluetooth working again. This tends to work for a few hours, sometimes an entire day, but at random, bluetooth seems to go corrupt again.\nAnyone else having a problem similar to this? Any hints on fixing it?  Also, is there some way I can force a reset of just bluetooth? Maybe by the command line?  \n\nA: I found some workaround that will at least spare you a reboot when problem arrives. It may be found here: https://discussions.apple.com/message/23705326#23705326\nShortly, type in terminal:\nsudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\nsudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\n\nAfter doing this your devices should reconnect. I have the same OS Version (10.9) and Early 2013 Macbook Pro and it works with my problems with bluetooth keyboard.\n\nA: There have been several significant updates to Mavericks, so the first step would be to run software update and get the OS and any firmware updates installed. Next, you can troubleshoot the issue as follows:\nSystem log\nLook at the error messages relative to the blued daemon:\ngrep blued /var/log/system.log\n\n(this is a command to type within Terminal).\nCheck in this system log if you don't have connexion attempts from an unknown\nBluetooth equipment. To be able to detect the intruders note your own\nBluetooth address within:\nSystem Information > Hardware > Bluetooth\n\nex. :\nHardware Settings:\n    Address:      A8-BB-CF-9B-07-D8\n    Manufacturer: Broad…\n\nBattery check\nThis system log won't display any information about the battery level.\nYou should check it with Alt ⌥ + Bluetooth menu bar icon:\n\nInterference check\nFor this interference analysis, install iStumbler and run it.\nIf you are in such a full of interferences environment, put away the other Bluetooth equipments, turn off your Trackpad, wait 30 s,\nturn it on. If your problem is the result of Bluetooth interference, this might recover its system connectivity (Bluetooth equipment rotate through the frequencies to use on the same channel than the 802.11g. When 2 of them are on the same channel, they are jaming each other).\nYou may also analyse the behaviour of your Bluetooth connexion in realtime with MacOS X standard tools:\nSystem Preferences > Bluetooth\n\npress Alt ⌥ to display the actual level of Bluetooth signal:\n\nAnd to go further, open the gear drop down menu to select Monitor Connection RSSI to monitor the connection quality:\n\n\nRestart the daemon\nIf you are able to start a Terminal or access your system through ssh, then you can easily restart blued with these few commands:\nps ax | egrep '[ /](PID|blued)'\n/usr/bin/sudo launchctl stop com.apple.blued\nps ax | egrep '[ /](PID|blued)'\n\nThe second ps should display a new process ID, confirming you that\nlaunchd restarted blued correctly.\nIf blued doesn't restart (PID stays the same) then you are facing a more serious problem to investigate, and you will have an harder kill:\nps ax | egrep '[ /](PID|blued)'\n/usr/bin/sudo killall -c blued -KILL\nps ax | egrep '[ /](PID|blued)'\n\nBut this isn't a good sign at all. This means that blued was stucked within a system call beyond any possibility to deal with a signal. This\nis most notably the sign of a bug within the Bluetooth driver or kernel extension.\n", "Q: Fresh Install OSX on new hard drive without the .dmg (iso) file Today is the day my hard drive failed.\nMy issue now is to install OSX (Mavericks) I have purchased to the new HDD. \nI have neither a DVD installer nor an iso file nor another Mac Device (but I could ask friends) \nHow can I proceed to reinstall OS X? \nDownloading an iso from the net could solve this? Or should I need my specific iso downloaded from the App Store?\n\nA: To re-install Lion (10.7) or later versions of OS X (including Mavericks), you can use Internet Recovery. Just boot your MacBook Pro while holding down ⌘R, until the Apple logo appears. You'll see an option for internet recovery (you may need to connect to your Wi-Fi first). Click that and follow the instructions and you'll have a fresh install in a while (it may take some time as it downloads the full installer).\n", "Q: Where is the 'Where from' meta data stored when downloaded via Chrome? I'm running Mavericks with Chrome, and when I download an image/file it saves the 'Where from' when viewing via Get Info. This also happens in Safari.\nNow, I understand there is a separate download history which can be viewed and deleted via the the tricks in the following article: http://www.cultofmac.com/179873/list-your-macs-entire-download-history-at-once-os-x-tips/ These are used when opening Applications for the first time to show the user where they come from.\nHowever, I've deleted this and confirm it's empty but yet it still shows in the 'Where from.' I've done some further tests and uploaded the image to view the EXIF and meta data but it doesn't appear to be stored in the files meta data at all. So where could it be stored?\nDoes anyone know how this 'Where from' meta data is stored, and where it is stored. Does it stay with the file if you put the file on the USB drive and open on a different computer?\nI'm not so much worried about removing it, but I just can't see where it comes from?\n\nA: There are extended attributes assigned to downloaded files, like com.apple.quarantine to put executable files in quarantine and com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms for the \"Where from\" data. The presence of these attributes can be revealed in the Terminal via ls -l@ /path/to/downloaded/file.\nNow to get the actual Data stored in this kMDItemWhereFroms, I found a solution based on this answer (which also explains a bit more about the conversion method):\nxattr -p com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms /path/to/downloaded/file | sed -e 's/0D//g' -e 's/.*\\(5F 10\\)...//' -e 's/00.*//'| xxd -r -p | sed -e 's@ (.*@@g'\n\nThis will return the url. Please note that at this moment it's in a relatively hard to read form, since my command-line-fu seems to fail me. I'll update the answer once I found the proper sed for it.\n\nA: It's stored in an extended attribute on the file. Specifically the com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms attribute. It may stay with the file when you move it to different computers, but it depends on the filesystem or file sharing protocol you use. If you move it to another Mac on an HFS+ disk, it will likely keep it, but not necessarily if you transfer over the network, and most likely not with an external disk with a non-HFS+ filesystem.\nYou can check a file by running xattr -lp com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms myfile in the Terminal, or remove it with xattr -d com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms my file. ls -l@ flag is also useful; it will list the names of xattrs along with the usual ls information.\nIf you want to remove it from multiple files, have a look at this question: How to remove xattr com.apple.quarantine from all .webarchive files with that extended attribute?\n", "Q: Would reformatting my Mac and restoring the latest Time Machine backup be likely to improve its stability? My MacBook Air used to be rock solid, but it has grown increasingly unstable over the past year. For example, this afternoon I can't switch to my other user account. I select the account from the fast user switching menu and nothing happens.\nPart of me wants to just start over, reinstall and reconfigure OS X and all of my applications from scratch. It would probably solve a lot of problems. But I have so much work invested in my current configuration. It would take days or weeks to fully rebuild.\nI'm thinking the next best option would be to wipe the drive and restore my latest Time Machine backup. I know that Time Machine doesn't back up everything -- caches, log files, etc. -- so maybe restoring from backup would have a \"rejuvenating\" effect. Or it could just be a complete waste of time.\nIn general, is reformatting and restoring from Time Machine a good way to get a Mac running like new? Or is it merely \"worth a shot\"?\n\nA: There could be various causes for a Mac that runs slow during certain times:\n\n\n*\n\n*too many applications running on the system (launched at login or explicitly by the user)\n\n*inadequate RAM\n\n*inadequate free space on the drive\n\n*file permission issues\n\n*corrupted files or configuration\n\n*updated OS and applications that need faster hardware, and so on\n\n\nFor all these cases, reformatting and restoring from Time Machine will not help.\nIf you'd like to clear caches and logs and repair permissions, there are far quicker and easier ways to do it than a time consuming reformat and restore from Time Machine. Make sure you have a backup and then try some of these utilities (you can also search for \"OS X cleanup\" to find other utilities):\n\n\n*\n\n*OnyX\n\n*MainMenu\n\n*Cocktail\n\n*CleanMyMac 2\nIf these do not help:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you're running OS X Mavericks, check the Memory Pressure information in Activity Monitor - this will tell you if RAM is inadequate for the applications you're running\n\n*try trimming down the number of applications that are running. Start with items launched at login (go to System Preferences > Users & Groups and then to the Login Items tab)\n\n*free up disk space (if it's quite low)\n\n*using Activity Monitor, check which applications use a lot of CPU and either remove them or reinstall them afresh (trash the application with a proper uninstall utility like AppCleaner so that its preferences and other files are also deleted and then reinstall it)\n\n*as a last resort, you may have to do a fresh install of the OS, followed by a fresh install of your applications, followed by a restore of only your data from the Time Machine backup (do not restore the entire applications folder or the home folders since that would bring back corrupt preference files, if any)\n\n\nA: I like MK's answer above. Look at those things first.\nThen - consider this...\nI experienced something similar to what you are describing. I tried the erase, format and restore from Time Machine... it didn't really help.\nThen someone suggested starting up with the option key held down and reinstall the operating system. (this 'reinstalls' the OS while keeping all of your files!)\nIf you are running Mountain Lion or later, you can follow Apple's instructions here: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH10763?viewlocale=en_US\nThis solution worked much better for me.\n\nA: If you are looking for a \"rejuvenating\" effect, depending of what version of Mac OS X you are running I would upgrade to Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) or Maverics (OS X 10.9).\nIt is more likely to stabilise your system and is easier than doing a full rebuild.\n", "Q: Two Macs and One Apple ID (purchases on App Store) I have a Macbook Air mid 2012 model and now I'm thinking about buying a Mac Mini or a iMac so that I can have my Macbook Air for when I'm on the road, and the Mini or iMac stationed at home all the time. For my setup now, I have a external display for my Air when I'm working at home, and I'm getting kinda tired of disconnecting and connecting the external display, mouse, and keyboard every day.\nBut then I thought about, how about all my purchases on App Store (OS X apps), are they automatically cleared to be installed on my new machine, while I still have them on my Macbook Air or is there going to be some kinda conflict with license?\n\nA: This question can only really be answered on a per app level (The End User License Agreement (EULA) will specify how many machines an application can be installed on), but in general I have a MacBook Pro, My wife has a Macbook Air and we have a media center mac mini and I install all my apps on all of them without an issue, but we share a single Apple ID for all app store purchases, since apple has restrictions on using multiple Apple IDs on a single machine.\nDevelopers seem to have a more sane point of view on mac (excluding Adobe or other graphics packages) than on windows, so I haven't had an issue.\n\nA: You can have up to ten devices (any combination of iOS devices or Macs) associated with one Apple ID; that means you could install the same software from the App Store on up to ten Macs. If one of them breaks or you sell one, you can de-authorize it, so your total goes down again.\nFor details on authorizing that go beyond your initial question (including some time limits for changing authorization), see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4627?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n", "Q: wrong icon of Unix symbolic link in Finder I am now on OS X 10.9, and I am not sure whether this issue also occurs on other versions.\nSo, I have many symlinks in my file system (created by ln -s). Today I modified one of them with ln -f -s (see detailed steps below). The symlink is working without problem, but the icon of the symlink in Finder changed from folder icon (with alias badge) to file icon (with alias badge). Namely, the icon should be\n\n(since the symlink is pointing to a folder) but it is now\n\nThe steps I took to modify the link were as follows (say I had the symlink ~/links/folder linking to ~/folder before, and I want to move ~/folder to ~/renamed-folder while updating the symlink to ~/links/renamed-folder):\n\n\n*\n\n*mv ~/links/folder ~/links/wrongly-renamed-folder, the link is active but renamed (happen to be wrongly renamed in my specific case, revealed by my zsh history).\n\n*mv ~/folder ~/renamed-folder, here the link became dead. After this step the link icon should be a file icon (that is the default behavior when link is dead).\n\n*mv ~/links/wrongly-renamed-folder ~/links/renamed-folder, I corrected the wrong link name (I don't whether this contributed to the final behavior, so I record it here faithfully).\n\n*ln -f -s ~/renamed-folder ~/renamed-folder, the link is working again, and ideally the icon of the symlink should be back to a folder icon. But in my case the icon is still a file icon.\nI took some measures to fix this problem but failed. The things I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the link completely and reconstruct a new one with ln -s. No use. The icon is still a file icon. Strangely enough, if I create another link with the same destination (but a different name), the icon will be a folder icon as expected. Only that one single name (~/links/renamed-folder in the above example) is \"reserved.\"\n\n*Try to paste the correct icns file into the Info panel. No use. And I didn't expect this to work actually, since Unix symlinks do not have their own associated icons, unlike OS X aliases.\n\n*Relaunch finder, or even log out and log back in. I know this is dumb, but people do this when desperate. And it sometimes does work like a charm; but not this time, unfortunately.\nThen I did an experiment that actually kind of revealed a bug in Finder. Steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*ln -s ~/Downloads ~/tmp. The icon of tmp is the aliased download folder icon\n\nas expected.\n\n*rm ~/tmp.\n\n*ln -s ~/other-folder ~/tmp. The icon of tmp, however, is still the aliased download folder icon, though the folder linked to is not the download folder anymore.\nSo there seems to be some kind of \"cache\" going on behind the scenes that controls the icons of symlinks, and Finder sometimes fails to update the cache when symlink is modified.\nSo, my question is, where is the \"cache\" that controls icons of symlinks? Thanks.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and it seems the problem in LaunchService in OS X. To clear it \"cache\" try this command in terminal \n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user ;\n\nand then \nkillall Finder; killall Dock;\n\nIn Mavericks it should work without reboot or re-login.\n", "Q: If I use Apple Tv as a separate display on Mavericks will it transfer sound I want to get an apple tv, so I can wirelessly use my tv as a separate monitor, now with mavericks I know this is supported. I was wondering if this means I can also transfer any sounds from my computer to my tv, otherwise it's sorta not worth getting.\n\nA: AirPlay mirroring sends video and sound to the connected device.\nYou can over-ride the sound if needed by selecting an alternate output as well as just send sound to any AirPlay receiver as well.\nThis is how AirPlay has worked since it started with sound and the video mirroring support keeps adding features as time goes by.\n", "Q: How Can I Copy a Video to iPhone and Send It Over iMessage?

Any \"folder\" in iPhoto which is able to be synced by iTunes should do the job.\n\n*Now it should appear in your pictures app on the iPhone and you should be able to share it via iMessage\n\n\nHope that helps\n", "Q: Mac OS X (10.9) and 8192 bit certificates - Error -67762 I've only recently upgraded to Mavericks and hence I'm not entirely sure whether this is a Mavericks only problem or not, but here it is:\nSecurity update 2006-007 apparently broke 8192-bit certificates on OS X and no one bothered to fix it (https://discussions.apple.com/message/3650856#3650856). However there is (or rather used to be) a solution for this bug (or feature?) and it is in https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2668985\nYou've just got to execute\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.crypto RSAMaxKeySize -int 8192\n\nin a Terminal prompt. Well I did, then I also restarted my macbook. However this had no effect other than setting the RSAMaxKeySize.

(http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2013-10/0036.html)\n\nA: The answer, as discovered by shizmob, is that Apple moved the location of this preference in Maverics to /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.

It's making it almost impossible to read anything else in the log.\n\nA: From the Apple Developer Reference, IOSurface is an API being called that allow applications to move complex image decompression and draw logic into a separate process to enhance security. \nApps that share media utilize this API, such as Messages or QuickTime.\nI've read that this issue can arise when using a VPN, but I can't seem to corroborate that at the moment.\n", "Q: App Store on iOS keeps asking for another user's iTunes credentials I recently helped a friend activate her iPhone 5. She used to have an iPhone 4S which I helped her do a backup on my Macbook. After backing up her iPhone 4S, I restored her iPhone 5 with the backup. Because her SIM card was not the correct size, I used my own SIM card to activate the phone as well.\nBut now there is a very weird issue where if she downloads certain apps from the App Store, it would ask for my Apple ID credentials instead of her's. I tried signing out of the App Store and having her sign in. But every time I download a certain app, it keeps asking for my credentials. Very strange. \nAny one know of how to fix this?\nPS: iCloud is also signed in with her credentials.\n\nA: *\n\n*When an iPhone is restored from a backup, it gets as much data as is can locally. Any app data is stored in the backup, but the apps themselves either have to be synced from a local iTunes (preferred) or downloaded.\n\n*When an iPhone is synched with iTunes, by default all apps on the iPhone are copied to the iTunes library, assuming iTunes is registered with the same Apple ID as they were purchased with. I think.\n\n*iOS app files are registered with a specific Apple ID, and without this same authentication, there's no (easy, non-jailbreak) way to use the app with another Apple ID.\nSo, when you restored your friend's iPhone with your computer, rather than download all of the apps from the iTunes servers, it copied as many as it could from your computer. These apps are linked to your Apple ID, so in order for your friend to use them her iPhone would need to be registered with your Apple ID.\nThe solution: Your friend can back up her iPhone to iCloud or another computer (make sure, if so, that the offending apps are deleted from the iTunes library after synching) and restore it again. This will definitely keep her data from the other apps, and probably from yours as well. Alternatively, she can delete all of yours and re-download them from the App Store, which will definitely lose the data.\n\nA: I have found a solid solution to the problem. I once put some music on my friends phone and you have to sync to do that and when you do you add his apple ID to your computer. What has happened is that somehow I downloaded an app and he had also and the app is backed up to the icloud under his apple ID. The fix is to  \n\n\n*\n\n*first sign into itunes account for the account that is the wrong one and go and then go to help and view account info. Then down to itunes in the cloud and on the right click on manage devices, then remove from the computer you first synced the wrong account to. Next comes the tedious part.\n\n*sign into itunes using the correct account and then go to the apps section, specifically the update all section. Next right click on your apps and then view info, you should see which acct the apps were originally purchased/downloaded into your phone and also the ones that were purchased/downloaded to the wrong acct. NOW delete those apps not synced to the right itunes ID and select delete from computer also. After removing the problematic apps, update them, then sync the phone and all should be good. \n\n\nA: I believe that if you download a DRM-free file to your iPhone, some of the metadata of the person who first obtained that file copies over. I had a weird Apple ID come up and bingo, under Show Info for one of my music videos, there was his email address.\n\nA: I found another solution that may be good for some people.\nIf you don't mind deleting your apps in iTunes, just when you're about to back up your friend's phone, delete all the apps on your iTunes, go to the Apps tab, press Cmd-A and right click delete. You might also have to de authorise your iTunes, and authorise it with your friend's Apple ID when prompted.\nThen after this, back up your friend's old phone (press Backup now) and restore it to their new phone. \nThis shouldn't affect you if you regularly back up your phone daily, just that maybe your next backup might take a bit longer. \nNote that if you are keeping old versions of apps (e.g. Apps that have now been pulled from the App Store, apps that new versions aren't compatible with your phone, etc), then do not use this method. You will lose those Nintedo emulators etc.\n", "Q: How to enable Three Finger Drag from command line I'm trying to write a shell script that will automatically set the trackpad to use the three-finger-drag option that you can find in the system preferences.

I find that after 10+ years of experience using Windows, the habit of segmenting the windows into different \"task areas\" is a bit difficult to get used to.\nI was hoping that there could be an easy way to subtly tweak the behavior of Cmd+Tab: Only bring into focus the last used window of the app that I am switching to. For instance I usually have a large number of Terminal or iTerm windows open in which I do a large number of various types of tasks, and then there are the other apps that I have many windows open in, such as the web browser. Here's a screencap of Expose right now: \n \nAs you can see I've been dumping all my work in the first space. This is actually a lot cleaner than it usually is, right now there are just 2 terminal windows, the rest of the grey windows are Sublime Text windows, which this issue also crops up with as well, as it is pretty cumbersome to be moving around all of those windows too, and I am often touching 3 or more projects at a time (each of which I try to constrain to its own window). I already have 3 Sublime windows minimized to the Dock, the reason that I did that was to alleviate this issue, where switching back to the app would cover the whole screen.\nThe usual case is Cmd+Tab to switch back and forth to see a description of something to enter into the terminal. Unfortunately this is often encumbered by me arranging both the terminal windows and the browser windows in such a way that Cmd+Tabbing to each app will cover the entire screen. Thereby not making it easy for me to see the contents of one app while using another, without manually re-focusing the individual windows using the mouse. \nIt's pretty obvious that desired behavior here is not obvious and e.g. if I was using an image editing app I'd certainly want all my toolbox windows to become visible when I tab back into that app. So this is probably something that I don't even want to \"switch on globally\".\nSo maybe there is a tweak out there that can customize this. Or even a feature in the iTerm terminal emulator that can change how it shows itself when tabbed to.\n\nA: I think Witch comes pretty damn close to giving me the level of control that I want, and then with even more nice stuff on top.\n\nA: The HyperSwitch tool integrates into the system cmd+tab widget. Gives you opt+tab to do exactly what I wrote about in OP. \nI use this now.\n", "Q: Getting an iPhoto book project created on an iPhone to another device like a Mac or iPad I can't find an option for exporting my iPhoto book project off my iPhone.

I'm hesitant to spend $30 on a book from my iphone without checking resolution on a larger screen. \n\nA: I've looked into this as well. As of this time (March 2014) there is no way to export an iphoto book created on an iphone or ipad other than to automatically send it in for printing with the associated cost. Hopefully they will come up with a way to export these as a pdf file the way they have done with the desktop version of iphoto.\n", "Q: Can you control brightness on two monitors simultaneously via the brightness key?

I have a 15-inch, mid 2010, MacBook Pro with OS X 10.9. It crashes very often (about 0-3 times a day). I have installed all available updates. Where do I start searching for the root cause of the problem? It could be some 3rd party product. Should I start uninstalling the 3rd party programs till the problem disappears? My suspicion is that it has something to do with the video driver, as the crashes happen when I maximize a photo in Facebook, for example, or do some other things related to changing something in the display. However, I updated the video driver and the problem persists. I also have the stack trace from the crash, but I can't read it. If anyone can point me to a tutorial about reading such a trace, it would be nice. Any advices about the problem are welcome. Thank you.\nP.S. The problem was caused by a faulty motherboard.\n\nA: Start with log files.  You have a program in your Applications > Utilities folder called Console; Fire that up, and it will show you a collection of log files - you should inspect these to see if there is anything obvious showing up at the time of your crashes.  Once you have discovered something that looks odd, or consistent across your crashes, you can google it or ask again here.\n\nA: Apple provide a help page on If your Mac restart because of problem... And if you want to actually attempt to debug a kernel crash then another page on Kernel Core Dumps which explains that you'll need to setup a debug server and also configure your crashing machine to dump core and/or debug to that server machine.\nThe other possibility is that whilst the GUI may be unresponsive the kernel may not have crashed so you might be able to connect remotely using ssh or remote desktop to attempt to ascertain the problem.\n", "Q: How to switch between fullscreen applications in OSX (Mavericks) I use a lot of different spaces for my fullscreen applications to get me focus on the different tasks I have to do. For example, I have a space with my mail app, subversion app, safari and so on.\nTo switch between my active apps I use ⌘ + tab all the time. Even though the icon of my fullscreen apps appears when tabbing and the menubar getting active, I don't see the app. Only when I go to Mission Control and click the app it will switch to the fullscreen window.\nIs there a setting or a shortcut to achieve this without using the mouse?\n\nA: I suggest Apptivate app for this. \nEasiest way for switching between apps. No need for complicated shortcuts, jus stroke sequence like: F1, than any key for yours app. No problem to use single key (F1 / F2 / F3 ...), or longer sequence (F1,F2,F1 / F2,F2,q).\n\nA: This doesn't let you switch straight to a target app, but ctrl + cursor keys will let you move left and right through your spaces to reach the full screen app.\nThe shortcut can be changed in system preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Mission Control.\n\nA: I spent a really long time looking at this and found that under keyboard > shortcuts there is a section under the name keyboard called mission control. It says that ctrl + arrow key, whether it be left or right, will switch \"spaces\". \"Spaces\" are your full-screen applications you have running. You can use cmd + tab to switch the focus window that will appear at the top, but it didn't seem to work for full-screen apps as quickly as the ctrl + arrow key. All of those keyboard shortcuts work, but if you wanted a quick way to switch between full-screen apps, just use ctrl + arrow key. I don't know what to tell you for minimized apps though because those don't work. You could just set focus to the app and use the \"show available windows\" option in mission control by using ctrl + arrow down.\n\nA: It has been a while and it seems that the keyboard shortcut for switching spaces has changed. In Mac OS X High Sierra it was set to ctrl + option + arrow key for me.\n\n\nA: If you're using new MacBook Pro models with the Touch Bar, you can change your Keyboard settings for Touch Bar to display Spaces (including full screen apps) on the Touch Bar, which allows you to directly switch to a specific fullscreen app without looping through all of them with Cmd+Tab or swipe gestures. It looks something like this.\n\nHere's the relevant Settings page.\n\n\nA: yes, there is.

If I try to reinstall, it says it is already installed.\nRunning Mac OSX 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion) and tried both Kepler and Juno releases of Eclipse (installed from www.eclipse.org), and PyDev latest from www.pydev.org, using the same procedures I use under Ubuntu (adding the site under \"Install New Software\").\nI'm running Java runtime 1.6.0_65-b14-462-11M4609.\nAny idea as to how I can get this working, so that I can get to a Python perspective in Eclipse?\n\nA: Found out from someone at work...\nTurns out that PyDev 3.x needs Java 7. Since I have Java 6, I need PyDev 2.x. I uninstalled, and then re-installed (unchecking the box that shows only the latest version) and now the PyDev perspective appears.\n", "Q: copy last command in terminal I can see the last command in the terminal by pressing up arrow as in the following example:\nI typed cd /:\nMakss-Mac:~ maks$ cd /\n\n... pressed enter, command cd / executed and now I can press up arrow and see the command cd / again:\nMakss-Mac:/ maks$ cd /\n\nI want to not only see the last command but also copy it to the clipboard.\nMaybe there exists a shortcut that not only shows the last command in the terminal (as up arrow does) but at the same time copies it to the clipboard.\nOr maybe there is a shortcut for selecting all from current terminal line. And so I would be able to copy the last command (after pressing up arrow) by pressing super+c. Of course I can select it with the mouse. But when commands are 10 times longer than cd / it can be too time-consuming, especially if you do it every 30 seconds.\nOr is there maybe a way to write a plugin for the terminal?\n\nA: Here's another take based on the answer by @Asmus. To make his alias work in my bash script, I had to use a bit of quoting, since single quotes don't work in a single-quoted alias without some additional quoting:\nalias copyLastCmd='fc -ln -1 | awk '\\''{$1=$1}1'\\'' | pbcopy'\n\nThe '\\'' will basically close the current quote, then add an escaped quote, and then open the actual quote again.\nThe above version will copy the last command to your clipboard, and once you paste it, it's immediately executed, since it will have a newline at the end.\nTo get rid of the newline at the end, so you can actually edit the command before running it, you can do the following:\nalias copyLastCmd='fc -ln -1 | awk '\\''{$1=$1}1'\\'' ORS='\\'''\\'' | pbcopy'\n\nThe ORS='' (that's without the quoting) will strip off the trailing newline character, so you can edit the pasted text before running it.\n\nA: I came here as came up with Sam Berry's exact same answer, but it doesn't work for me (OSX 10.14.6).\nManaged to get it to do so with quotes around the !! :\necho \"!!\" | pbcopy\n\nA: You can set your history to ignore commands that start with a space:\nexport HISTIGNORE=' *'\n\nAnd then run the following command to git the last command to the clipboard (make sure you have a space at the beginning):\nhistory 1 | cut -d \" \" -f 4- | pbcopy\n\nYou probably would then want to save the command as an alias to make it easier to remember.\n\nA: Put this into your ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile or where-ever you like it:\nalias copyLastCmd='fc -ln -1 | awk '{$1=$1}1' | pbcopy '\n\nAfter opening a new window (or running source ~/.bash_profile) you should be able to run copyLastCmd and have the command in the clipboard.\nTo explain what's going on: you're basically using \"fix command\" (fc) to get you the last command, remove both leading and trailing whitespace for nicer formatting with awk and then copy it into your Mac's pasteboard with pbcopy.\nEDIT:\nNow that we know that you want to copy to paste into another terminal tab, there's another option:\nAdd these lines to your ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile or where-ever you like it:\nshopt -s histappend\nPROMPT_COMMAND='$PROMPT_COMMAND; history -a; history -n'\n\nThen, once you have some new tabs open (let's call them \"tab A\" and \"tab B\"):\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute any command in tab A\n\n*Switch to tab B, press enter on an empty line, giving you a \"fresh\" new line (and thus re-evaluating the history)\n\n*use the up arrow once and you should have the command you've just entered in tab A.\n\n\nEDIT 2:\nI've replaced the usage of sed with awk in the original answer above, to take care of both leading and trailing whitespace .\n\nA: This will use history expansion to grab the last command and echo it. You can pipe to pbcopy to save the last command to your clipboard.\n> echo !! | pbcopy\n\nIf you want a command from your history that was not the last one, you can run:\n> history\n\nAnd reference the desired command number like:\n> echo !5 | pbcopy\n\n", "Q: How do I copy photos edited via the Camera app on my iPhone to my PC? So, I know that the photos edited via the Camera app can't be copied to a Windows PC along with the edits.\nI realise that the alternative is to email 5 photos at a time.\nThis is obviously cumbersome. Can anyone suggest alternatives?\n\nA: Okay. I've found it.\nThe easiest alternative to getting the edits onto your PC, instead of emailing them to yourselves is to upload it to Flickr.\nObviously, you'll need iOS7, as it has native Flickr integration.\nYou can upload 10 photos at once which is far better than emailing.\nMoreover, if you're like me, who backups photos to a cloud, you can use IFTTT to create a trigger and upload it to your favorite service whenever a new photo is uploaded.\n\nA: Use iCloud.  On your phone go to Settings > iCloud and enable Photos.  It may take some time to sync, but they will.\nThen go to iCloud.com and log into your account from your PC.  Then you can browse your iCloud files including your photos that you've sync'd from your phone.\n\nA: There are a couple of wireless syncing options.\nIf you want to upload a small number of photos I would suggest using Google Drive / Dropbox; both support multiupload, you only select the ones you want to upload and they will just appear in according folders on your PC.\nIf you want to upload your entire photo stream you can start using Google Photos. It can be configured to upload only when on wifi.\n\nA: I had hundreds of photos edited on iOS that I needed to transfer (yes, I actually did edit that many photos in my case)\nHere's a solution I recently used, https://send-anywhere.com/ (free at the time of this writing)\nBoth the sender and receiver can receive/send files via the website, Android App or iOS App.\nSo, it's not just for PCs, but any platform. And obviously, it's not just for photos, but for files in general.\n\nAdditional notes:\nIn my case, I was trying to transfer edited photos from my iPhone to my Mac, and I initially used Photos to import them, which transferred the original ones (i.e. not what I wanted).\nThen I used AirDrop, which did transfer the edited ones, but are all named as FullSizeRender.jpg, FullSizeRender(1).jpg, FullSizeRender(2).jpg, etc, but not in the order I selected. It almost seemed like whichever file gets fully received first gets the available name first (again, not what I wanted)\nSo I ended up selecting my photos on iPhone, sharing to the Send Anywhere app, and downloaded the files from my Mac. I got the same file name patterns, but this time they were all in the sequence I expected and wanted, which I can live with.\nThose were photos of dozens of pages of notes I had, so I specifically didn't want them to be transferred and named in random order.\n\nUnconfirmed speculations:\nFrom the AirDrop experience I mentioned, if you actually have two Apple devices, I'm speculating that the edited photos get transferred from one device to another.\nIf this is true, then you can first send the edited photos from one device to the second, then through USB/wire, transfer your edited photos from the second device to your PC.\nI can't actually try this yet - if someone can confirm this, that would be great.\n\nA: You can find the solution on this link:\nHow to import to Mac/Windows the iOS edited images without losing the changes\n;-)\n", "Q: Numbers Won't Open On My MacBook Pro with OS X 10.8.5 I'm not a tech or computer expert - I understand clear directions, but not tech-speak, so I'm going to put this as plainly as I can…\nI've updated to the most recent system, OS X 10.8.5, on my MacBook Pro. My Pages and Keynote applications are opening and functioning fine. However, when I attempt to open and utilize my Numbers application, it either either does nothing, or flashes a message that the document can't open.\nI have tried to search other answer sites for insight into what might be going on, without finding a direct answer. Would you please explain to me why this might be happening, and how I can troubleshoot the problem?\n\nA: The first thing to do when troubleshooting an iWork app that connects to iCloud is to test launching the app from a brand new user. This will isolate whether your user settings are causing problems or the problem is truly with the App itself or the OS install.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Select Users & Groups\n\n*Make a new user - test or something obvious.\n\n*Log out of your current user (users if you have fast user switching enabled).\n\n*Log in to the new account.\n\n*Open Numbers.\n\n\nAt that point, you can see if the console app has information about Numbers from the current user launching the app and the previous user. Console app is in /Applications/Utilities.\nSince this won't actually solve the problem you may need to edit the question or ask a new question - but it should help inform you if the problem relates to your documents in Numbers or the Numbers app itself. From there, you'll have a more narrow problem to ask/chase/fix.\n", "Q: iOS App to record narration with images I'm looking for an iPad app that can record a narrated audio track and edit it include still images to go with the spoken audio. The end product I'm looking for is a movie with a spoken audio track with still images placed at various points in the spoken track.\nCan anyone recommend an iOS app that can do this?\n\nA: iMovie for iOS\niMovie for iOS will let you record sound using the voiceover tool and overlay this on media in your timeline, such as pictures imported from your camera roll, Photo Stream or imported pictures.\n\nAdd background music, sound effects, and voiceover narration to your movie. And with new advanced audio tools, you can trim, split, duplicate, and reposition audio anywhere in the timeline.\n\n\n", "Q: Can't email Numbers 3.0 or Pages 5.0 documents via Google Mail (Gmail) When I try to email a Numbers 3.0 or Pages 5.0 document via Google Mail, I receive the following error.\n\n\nA: It appears that with the new version of Numbers, Apple changed from using files to using folders that appear as files.

I would like to know how secure this is. I can imagine that the \"encrypted\" files are not really encrypted at all, and continue to lie on the hard disk in plain, unencrypted form. Are the individual files or file chunks themselves encrypted?\nIf one is lucky, one can recover deleted files from a hard disk. It might, as far as I know, be just as easy or maybe easier to recover files on an encrypted dmg.\nMy question is: what are the facts here? And how secure are the files in an encrypted disk images?\n\nA: The files on an encrypted disk image are encrypted. \nAs you can see currently you can have 128 bit AES and 256 bit AES.  As is pointed out 256 bit will be slower but more secure, however both methods will leave your data encrypted, until it is decrypted.\n\nThe real issue is how strong the password for the encrypted volume is.  If the password is not a random string of characters, but based on a dictionary word with substitutions of 1 for i etc, the files while encrypted might as well not be.\n\nEnsure your password is based on a long sentence where you use all punctuation marks, include spaces, numbers and special characters.\n", "Q: OS X 10.9 Fullscreen on second display doesn't stretch to full screen, but only part of it I'm on OS X 10.9 and with this OS upgrade, the ability to run fullscreen apps on a second display while working on another was implemented.\n\nWhat I want:\nPlay YouTube and other online sources (divxstage.eu to name one) videos on my second (1080p) screen while working on my internal MacBook Pro display.\nWhat happens:\nCase (1): Youtube videos can be run in fullscreen mode, so if I click on the button it expands to the whole secondary display. When switching back to my MBP, after a while OR (when in a playlist) upon starting the next video it resizes to only a portion (I believe about the same size of the MBP display!) of the screen in the upper left corner, however cutting off the video and displaying a 3/4 black screen. (Example: if there was a circle in the video, you'd now see like a segment of this circle)\nCase (2): I found that with e.g. divxstage.eu, videos do not even expand to the full screen, but leave it blank in 3/4 right away. (Same size as with YouTube videos)\n\nHas anyone experienced this, too? Can anybody help, a possible solution, workaround, or even just the source of the problem?\n\nA: Here's my workaround: right click on the 1/4-screen video and, if you're using Flash 15.0.0.xxx, you should see a Stretching is <type> item in the options list. Click on that and the video will fill the screen. Keep repeating until you get back to the 'Stretching is none' setting, unless you prefer something else.\nI have the same issue when using firstrowsports.eu on my 2014 MBP, multiple different browsers, no plugins, no additional screen, hardware acceleration on and off, Mavericks and now Yosemite.\n", "Q: Disable Escape key in Safari for getting out of full screen mode I use Safari in Full Screen mode on OS X Mavericks all the time.  I also use the escape key in web pages fairly frequently for various things (depends on the webpage).\nOne unfortunate side effect of these two facts is that I will occasionally turn off Full Screen mode inadvertently by hitting the escape key on a page that doesn't intercept the escape key.\nIs there a way to disable the \"Escape turns off full screen mode\" behavior in Safari?\n\nA: \nNow, you could go ahead and brute-force disable the Escape key in\n  Safari. But that'd defeat the purpose of still allowing Escape to work\n  as a shortcut in the aforementioned places, which I'd rather avoid.\n\nSee here for an example to remap Escape to ⌥Escape with a Keyboard Maestro macro:\n\n\nA: For macOS 12.3, Safari 15.4 and Tampermonkey 4.17.6162 ($2 in App Store), this script (based on https://superuser.com/a/388993/620906) works for most websites (and you can usually still use Esc to close modals!):\n// ==UserScript==\n// @name           Keep Full Screen\n// @namespace     http://superuser.com/q/315949\n// @description    Prevents Escape key from leaving full screen.\n// @include      https://*\n// @include      http://*\n// ==/UserScript==\n\ndocument.onkeydown = function (evt) {\n    if (evt.keyCode == 27) evt.preventDefault();\n}\n\n\nA: Simply use the alternative escape sequence: CTRL-[.

I have have screen shots of my contact list, missed calls and a full contact.\n\n\n\nA: This would be explained entirely by a change to your accessibility settings to \"Invert Colors\".\nYou can change that back in Settings->General->Accessibility. \n", "Q: Disable App Update Notifications on OSX? When I have apps that need updating in OSX I get a notification on the top-right corner of my screen that does not go away until I click it (which opens the app-store). Is there a way to turn these notifications off? \n\nA: In OSX Mavericks:\nYou can temporarily disable the notifications by scrolling down in your notifications panel and switching the \"Do Not Disturb\" to On.  My understanding is that the duration of time that this is in effect is determined by your settings in System Preferences > Notifications > Do Not Disturb > From XXX to XXX.\nThis is explained in more detail here and here.\nThe permanent solution has already been answered in this question.\n\nA: If the App store doesn't know about updates it should not be able to notify you - so within System Preferences go into the \"App Store\" preference pane and deactivate the option to search for updates automatically. \n\nA: OSX Monterey allows creating custom \"Focus\" settings in Notifications & Focus.\nBy creating a custom Focus using a Time Schedule, and specifying specifically which apps are allowed to send you notifications you can effectively turn off all notifications.\nIn my experience so far this includes OS & App Store related notifications.\nThis is particularly useful given that the new OSX includes random add like Notifications for Safari.\n", "Q: I deleted an important contact on my iPhone I deleted a contact on my old inactivated iPhone 4.  This to my surprise deleted to from my new iPhone 5s.  Is there anyway to retrieve it?  I realize now my new iMac, new iPhone and old one are all synced from the cloud. \n\nA: If you look at your restore options in iTunes, there are usually a couple of previous backup versions. You could make a new backup, try restoring an older one, save the contact you want on another system then restore your new backup. \n", "Q: Backup external hard drive to the cloud via Time Capsule I'd like to move my photo directory to an external hard drive, but still have that hard drive backed up both locally and to the cloud. This wouldn't be a problem if I was using a desktop machine of some sort. However, I have a laptop, and I'd like for the external drive to be able to backup to the cloud without needing my laptop as an intermediary to the cloud. Is it possible to have an external hard drive that's connected to a Time Capsule backup to a cloud backup service (like CrashPlan) using the Time Capsule's internet connection?\n\nA: Yes - but the flow of the data isn't linked directly.\n\n\n*\n\n*The external drive can be opted in to back up to any Time Machine destination as long as there's enough space on the destination drive.\n\n*You can configure CrashPlan to back up files from the external drive - directly to the cloud.\n\n\nNote: These are independent - you could enable 1 and not 2 or 2 and not 1 or both 1 and 2 as you wish.

I am sure that this is not a problem with the app since the bar looks fine on other phones (i.e. text is written in black over a white background).\nI have tried deleting the app and reinstalling it. I have also tried resetting the iPhone settings (iOS 7.0.3 on iPhone 5). But I am still facing this problem.\nIs there some setting in the phones which forces the text to be white for some apps?\n\n\nA: I don't think there is any way to change it in your iPhone. It is up to the programmer to set the colour of status bar that will be shown. What you can do is to write a review for the app, and it might get corrected in the next version of the app. \n\nA: As an iOS developer I can tell that this is a setting that the developer made for iOS7.\nIt's simply a poor design choice.\n", "Q: Multiple IP addresses in Safari Is it possible to choose which IP address will be used to browse the web? I am connected to a VPN which created tun interface with different IP addres so now I have two of them. \nI would also like to browse the web through the second one, the tun interface. \n\nA: Yeah, I found the answer.. If you're using VPN via OSX Network settings, there is a setting under Advanced button to \"Send all traffic over VPN connection\". If you're using OpenVPN with Tunnelblick, the same \"Route all traffic hrough the VPN\" is under Settings->Advanced->While connected.\n", "Q: Can you tell different iPad Configurations by their Weight? Just wondering, would there be a weight difference between a 32GB vs 128GB or Wifi vs Cellular configuration of the same iPad model (e.g. iPad Air)?\n\nA: According to Apple, the LTE version is 9 grams heavier than the WiFi version.\nWhen you look at that picture of the logic board of the iPad Air (http://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/rqfMxwyBxWTko3xN.huge, taken from iFixit iPad Air 16 GB teardown, the yellow one is the Toshiba NAND Flash chip) you can see that there's not much room for more chips, so they would just integrate the same chip size with more NAND inside for e.g. 128 GB configuration. So I did some research about that and it seems there are up to 128 GB chips in the same size since 2010/2011 (just that time Apple first released a 128 GB model, what a coincidence :D). So theoretically this would be possible. Of course, you'd need to see a teardown of a larger model to say for sure.\nHaving said that it'd be hard to tell the difference in weight between those configurations, independent if they put more NAND in one chip or used maybe 2 chips for larger configurations (what looks difficult if you take a look at the layout of the motherboard: http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPad+Air+Teardown/18907). The difference would be just below 1 gram...\n", "Q: Can an MDM system (e.g. GOOD) report on iOS app usage? If a company uses an MDM system (like GOOD or MobileIron) to deploy apps to their iPads and iPhones does iOS provide the MDM system data about when the app is used, so it will show up in their usage reports? \n\nA: Yes, Airwatch, Good, and MobileIron all utilize some form of app usage monitoring. For a taxonomy of enterprise MDM systems, and their features, reference this link, specifically under the Application Management subheading.\n", "Q: OS X Native full on IDE I'm wondering if there is a good full on IDE for Mac. I know of and have tried Sublime, BBEdit, Coda, Espresso, Netbeans, Eclipse, Aptana, PHPStorm, WebStorm, Textmate and probably other that I don't remember. \nWhat I mean by full on (which I believe excludes Sublime, BBEdit, Coda, Espresso and Textmate) is something like PHPStorm/NetBeans/Eclipse with a full feature set, intelligent code completion, code linking, etc. \nI really like PHPStorm but it doesn't feel like a native OS X app and is really sluggish.\nIf anyone knows of IDE that I haven't mentioned above, would be much appreciated.\n\nA: AFAIK Xcode can support web languages with some plugins, but all the informations I have are pretty old. http://web.archive.org/web/20110811093439/http://developer.apple.com/internet/scripting/phpappledevtools.html\nAnd there are some projects to support autocomplete for PHP that I never really tried.\nhttps://github.com/tonyjohnston/PHP-Xcode-Autocomplete\nI'm very happy about PHPStorm, btw and I don't feel the need for a native IDE after moving to it from Eclipse/Aptana.\n", "Q: PPC emulator to run MacOSX 10.5 Is there any PPC emulator (for either Intel Macs or any Linux) which can run MacOSX 10.5 PPC?\nMy current research only points me to PearPC and the latest post/release was from 2011. On the homepage, they say that they have support for MacOSX 10.3 with some caveats. Also, it doesn't seem to emulate a soundcard which is relevant for me. Some totally outdated forum posts are asking about MacOSX 10.5 but without any real answers, e.g. here or here.\n\nA: To do a 100% accurate test your best bet would be to get an actual PowerPC Mac. Alternatively, you can install 10.6 (Server) in a Virtual Machine, which can test PPC Applications through Rosetta.\n", "Q: Recursive chmod fails I have a folder owned by root:admin. I would like to change permissions of all files inside, so I can edit them without sudo, but recursive chmod fails:  \n$ sudo chmod -R u+w some-folder/\n\ndoes nothing. Any ideas how to fix it?\nAt the same time changing permission to a single file works seamlessly.\nStory:\nI installed a Python package from GitHub repository via pip, as an editable install.

As you are using sudo I assume you are in the admin group (this is not necessarily the case but if anyone  alters this I would expect they fully understand these permissions). These files are owned by admin so the permission that matters is the g one.\nThus the chomd you need is\nsudo chmod -v -R g+w some-folder/\n\nThere are alternatives\n\n\n*\n\n*As this is where python is installed you should be using pip, easy_install and setuptools to do these updates which will require sudo.

I've tried turning off the Energy Saver preference for \"shut down hard drives when possible\", but it keeps happening.\n\nA: To troubleshoot this, you could use System Information to inspect the USB tree on all ports and see if you can see the connected hubs.\nThat might make it easier to diagnose what part of the chain is dropping.\nAdditionally, the console app can let you search for error messages around the time when the devices go missing. Searching for USB and other disk related messages might turn up some idea if it's an overpower condition where the hardware is shutting down the ports as a preventative measure or due to sustained errors on the USB bus.\n", "Q: How to connect to an already open Terminal session on another Mac I am running Mac OS X 10.7 on a MBP and OS X 10.8 on a Mac Mini.

After applying the Mavericks Update for Mail 1.0, I'm still having the same problems: Gmail works great on iPhone/iPad/Gmail.com, but OS X Mail still does not reflect any changes made on other devices. Also, the recommended settings for Apple Mail on Google's website are uselessly outdated.\nAre there any new, up-to-date recommended settings for Apple Mail and Gmail to make them play nicer, has anyone published a good comprehensive blog or anything? (Current as of AFTER the release of the update?)\n\nA: Here's what I'd do:\nNOTE: I tend to rename folders and prefix them with a '#' instead of moving them.  Do whichever you'd prefer.\nDelete gmail accounts from mail.app.\nClose mail and go to ~/Library/Mail.  Move it somewhere (delete it later if all goes well).\nGo to ~/Library/Containers/, and move com.apple.mail.\nGo to ~/Library/Preferences/, and move com.apple.mail.*\nRun Mail, and set your accounts up.  Go to Mail -> Preferences -> Accounts.\nFor each gmail account:\n\n\n*Turn off Junk Mail.\n\n*Give them a good name so you can tell them apart.\n\n*In the SMTP settings, make sure 'use only this server' is checked.\n\n*In the SMTP settings -> Edit SMTP server list -> give it a good description, change the port to 587, make sure credentials are filled in and SSL is checked.\n\n*Mailbox behaviours - all checked except junk mail.  I set dropdown boxes to never, never, and one month old.\n\n*Advanced - IMAP path prefix should be '[Gmail]', IDLE checked.\nI tend to also go to Viewing, and set it back to classic layout.  I like enabling the bold unread messages.  Then I'll customize my columns.\nFinally, once your email begins to download you'll need to map the sent/drafts/trash folders properly.  Send an email and a 'Sent Messages' folder will be created if it doesn't already exist.  This is the one Mail uses but not the one gmail/iPhone will use.  So click on Sent Mail, and go to the Mailbox menu -> Use this Mailbox for ... -> Sent.\nDo the same with Trash and Drafts.\nNow if you do have the sent messages folder, I recommend logging in to the gmail web interface at gmail.com, and just move all of those messages to the correct sent folder.  Takes about 2 seconds in gmail.com, but will take forever if you try and do the same thing from mail.app.\nWait for everything to sync up, test sending/receiving from your computer, iPhone, iPad, etc.  Make sure the mappings are working out and everything goes where its supposed to.\nIf you get sick of mail.app, go and buy MailMate (http://freron.com), which is my new favourite mail client.\n", "Q: Could I trust such a FlashPlayer update?

Prior to the OS upgrade, I was running an older version of the Intellipoint software (sorry, not sure which version); it required running System Preferences in 32-bit mode to change settings.  After updating to Mavericks, I found that the Intellipoint features no longer worked, and checking System Preferences, I could not open the Intellipoint Prefs pane.  \nSo I downloaded and installed the latest (8.2.0 v.305) Intellipoint software for OS X.  The preference pane works, but it doesn't see my mouse.  The Buttons tab shows a picture of a USB device being plugged into a USB port, and the Device Info button says \"No Microsoft mouse devices found\".\nBased on a similar question I found for Mountain Lion, I have confirmed that 'MicrosoftMouseHelper' is in my startup items and is currently running.  The mouse functions, but using the standard OS X mouse settings; I prefer the way the mouse behaves when using the Intellipoint drivers and my settings within that.  Any ideas for getting the Intellipoint software to recognize the mouse?  \n\nA: I resolved this by uninstalling the Intellipoint Software (using the provided uninstaller) , rebooting (as requested by the uninstaller), reinstalling, and rebooting (as requested by the installer).  I suspect something went wrong in my prior in-place upgrade of the Intellipoint Software.  I did lose my Intellipoint settings, but I had made note of them prior to uninstalling.\n\nA: In Mojave, add NSAppleEventsUsageDescription key to:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/PreferencePanes/Microsoft Mouse.prefPane/Contents/Resources/MicrosoftMouseHelper.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\n*/Library/PreferencePanes/Microsoft Mouse.prefPane/Contents/Info.plist (not sure this is needed or works)\n\n\n<key>NSAppleEventsUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Foo</string>\nThe mouse will not show up as connected in the pref pane, (and you might not be able to modify settings in the pref pane) but the original IntelliPoint mouse acceleration will work as expected.\n", "Q: What is the Best App to Create Gifs?

I have a cable modem in one room that currently feeds into our primary router (which I want to replace with an Extreme), which feeds into a switch, which then distributes Internet and LAN services over ethernet via CAT5 to an office upstairs and another office a few rooms over. (The walls in our building are thick, so I can't do a purely wireless mesh.)\nWhat I want is basically for one Extreme (the one next to the cable modem) to be my primary router and DHCP server, and the other two to be access points extending the primary network. \nI tried using the Airport Utility to set it up following their instructions to extend a network, however, it seems that it was trying to do so wirelessly, not through the ethernet cables I had plugged into the Extremes. As a result, the two access point Extremes kept losing their connections to the primary Extreme. \nHow can I get this setup to work the way I want it to?\n\nA: On the satellite AE's, set the WAN port to bridged, and make sure all three AEs have the same SSID, security, and password.  Connect satellite AEs to the main AE via ethernet cables (or all three to a switch). I do this at my house and it works flawlessly.\nI believe one of the other answers is incorrect based on the information above.\n\nA: You can only extend the network wirelessly. For wired interconnections, the other AE's will need their own WiFi netwok names. You can make all the names the same or different just be aware that many devices won't seamlessly roam and will not automatically use the strongest connection or switch when you move between rooms. IMHO, having used both approached, you are better off with different names so it's obvious what's going on.\nOne AE can do all the DHCP assignments.\n\nA: If the bridged AE's are 2nd generation, they need to be plugged in via the WAN port, not the LAN ports! I know there are much newer versions for AE, but for those of you that have old AE 2nd gen's sitting in a closet, take them out and use them to create a roaming network, but remember to plug them into the WAN port, not the LAN. However, on the newer AE's, you connect via the LAN ports! Until I found (old) documentation on the Apple web site, I didn't know why my AE 2nd gens weren't working as roaming networks. Now they do, and they do it well! \n", "Q: Mavericks has wrong Russian layout Looks like the Russian layout included in Mavericks has wrong characters mapping. The layout image in preferences looks correct (see the image). But actual mapping of punctuation characters resembles the DOS ones a decade ago. E.g., to enter comma or dot i need to press Shift-6 and Shift-7 respectively, instead of Shift-? and ?.\nThis was a forced upgrade from previous mac os x version by my company. Any ideas how to install correct Russian layout?\n\n\nA: My Russian PC layout works correctly.  It sounds like you are using Russian instead.  Make sure you have the Russian flag with the PC underneath showing at the top right of the screen.  Or that you have the layout called Russian removed from your active Input Sources.\nIf you have the right flag showing, do you have this problem for all apps including TextEdit?\n\nA: with \"Russian PC\" keyboard you can type \"ё\" by holding \"е\" and then pressing 1. Dunno how I guessed that, but it works.

I have installed 10.9 on four machines now and each time I have seen it wipe out the login.keychain and sometimes after that it also wiped out some preferences, but after a reboot and restore of some of them things seemed to settle down.  Fortunately I've been able to restore the backup on all except one.  I've hit an odd wall with one of the MacBook Airs in particular where the system not only wiped out the login.keychain but snowballed into wiping out all of the other preferences it appears to all apps.  This included the Dock and most application preferences.  Some things seemed to remain such as Desktop and Screensaver settings, so it was quite queer.\nThis particular problem machine went so far as to have the iPhoto and iTunes databases continually corrupted.  After turning on and off iCloud, many reboots and about 20 rebuilds of the iPhoto database, I've reached the end of my tolerance level.  The most reliable way to corrupt the iPhoto database and iTunes has been to connect a new iPad Air to it.  I finally got it switched over to sync via wireless and to not trigger iPhoto and iTunes automatically on connection and so that is calmed down, however the other settings such as Dock's and Finder's are being obliterated yet still on each reboot and seemingly at random times.\nThis is quite odd for me as I'm usually the guy that tells the Geniuses at the Apple store what is going on as I have 20 years of Unix, etc. experience, but this is just a baffling situation and I wanted to see if anyone else has seen anything quite like this.  I have not yet been able to find the same scenarios with quite a bit of searching and so I felt it was time to pop on over here.\nFYI, I also did reset the keychain entirely multiple times as well as run repairs, which rebuilt it since it was being deleted too apparently.  Filesystem and permissions also were fine.\nAny thoughts or anyone seen something similar?\n\nA: So I found that after looking at the extended attributes that somehow this particularly problematic system had issues where there were a number of user immutable files.  After resetting the extended attributes things started to become a bit more sane.\nFor example, I found a handy command line option on the Apple forums:\nfind ~ $TMPDIR.. \\( -flags +sappnd,schg,uappnd,uchg -o ! -user $UID -o ! -perm -600 -o -acl \\) 2> /dev/null | wc -l\n\n(Drop off the final | wc -l to see actual files with issues.)\nI then went through resetting things judiciously and selectively executing these where appropriate (also found on the Apple forum, but modified from original form):\nsudo chflags -R nouchg,nouappnd ~ $TMPDIR..\nsudo chown -R $UID:staff ~\nsudo chmod -R u+rwX ~ \nchmod -R -N ~ # Or specific paths\n\nFor example, I found that even after executing these and rerunning the find command sans the postfixed line count that there were still a number of corrupt permissions and had to selectively run chmod -R -N on those paths again.  Odd that it didn't take care of them the first time, but ultimately I ended up with a 0 count of permission afflicted files.\nFor good measure I took the advise of rebooting into the recovery partition and running Terminal -> resetpassword and subsequently reset the folder permissions for the homes, but I don't think that that was necessary as the permissions seemed to checkout prior to that for the folder and children.\n", "Q: How can I buy an older version of Keynote that's compatible with 10.8?

I just tried to buy it, but I'm getting an error that the current version (6.0) isn't compatible with 10.8. How can I buy an older version of Keynote that's 10.8-compatible?\n\nA: I presume that you're trying to purchase iWork from the App Store.  \nYou can purchase a physical copy of iWork '09 and install it.  \nIf your Mac doesn't have a disc drive, you can use Remote Disk to do so.  You'll need access to another computer (either Mac or Windows) that has a disc drive.  Apple has complete directions for using Remote Disk here.\n", "Q: How to search by coordinates in Apple Maps?

Apple has\n  acknowledged that users are still having trouble despite multiple\n  updates since a new version of Mail first released with the updated\n  operating system, but the suggested fix is only a temporary\n  workaround.\nApple suggests that users disconnect and reconnect from their mail\n  servers by selecting 'Take All Accounts Offline' and then clicking\n  'Get All New Mail' from the Mailbox menu. This has the same effect as\n  quitting and restarting the app, which is what many users had resorted\n  to doing. Apple also helpfully adds that these two commands can be\n  added to Mail's main toolbar by clicking 'View > Customize Toolbar'\n  and then dragging them from the palette that pops up to the desired\n  position.\nThe workaround does not fix the underlying problem, although Apple's\n  acknowledgment means they know it exists and are hopefully working on\n  it already.\nSince the release of Mavericks, also known as OS X v10.9, users have\n  complained that the Mail app refuses to download new emails and that\n  they have trouble while moving and deleting messages, especially when\n  connected to Gmail accounts. Such problems relate to the desktop\n  software's inability to synchronise changes with remote mail servers.\nTwo previous updates, including a dedicated Mail Update and the\n  overall Mavericks 10.9.1 release failed to fix these problems for many\n  users. Apple's release notes for 10.9.1 specifically mention improved\n  support for Gmail, reliability fixes, and improved search and mailbox\n  functionality.\nOther problems relate to mail being delivered late, folders and tags\n  not updating, and searches not displaying messages that are known to\n  exist.\n\nWhat I read from it, is Apple knows about the IMAP issues and it is working to fix it. So far the 10.9.2 has not completely resolved it.\nI suggest you open the Activity window in Mail to monitor the progress if you have multiple accounts (it might take a while), before doing the get mail (go online)\n\nA: The only thing that worked for me: enabling 2-step authentication with gmail. \n", "Q: does leaving a hotspot on when no one is connected use data? I am concerned. I do not want the hotspot using data and wasting data without anyone connected. I was told to turn it off but i normally leave it on. I want to find out if it does or if it does not.\n\nA: if it does it will be a very minimal amount. But it will drain your battery(if its a wireless device) and others have a chance of connecting to it if you leave it on (even if its password protected they have a chance of hacking it)\n\nA: I was just checking the same thing out. I went to the AT&T store and then I went to AT&T online and chatted with them. The hotspot does use data just being turned on. You can get unlimited data plans for $90/month. That is the only way it would be worth having a hot spot and leaving it on 24/7, IMHO.\n", "Q: Downloading videos using iTunes, how can I back them up?

I'm considering upgrading my MacBook Air to a Pro in the interest of getting better performance out of Xcode development experience. Right now using Xcode 5 seems ok for writing code. However storyboards are becoming painful to work with.\nWhat specs will influence the performance of storyboards the most?\n\nA: I had the same issue. Whenever I opened the storyboard after the inconsistencies message was displayed, Xcode would consume 60%+ CPU and essentially make it unusable.\nI (very slowly) found which images were being reported as problems, then deleted them through finder and restarted Xcode. You may also need to remove any references to these images in the storyboard.\nXcode now runs fine - hope it helps!\n", "Q: Offline download of Enhanced Dictation in Mavericks I want to use the amazing Enhanced Dictation Feature available in OSX Mavericks, like the screenshot says is required a download of 785 MB.\n\nThe only problem is that in my home where i have my Mac i haven't internet connection so i need a way to download some kind of pkg or dmg to use at home when i have my offline Mac.\nIs there any way to do that, links are appreciated if exists.\n\nA: I had the same problem and i figure out how to solve it\nI wanted to keep the file so I don't have to re-download every time\nhere is the way tested on mavericks 10.9.3 and it works\ndownload the file 785 mb\nwhen it finished go to\nSYSTEM --> LIBRARY -->SPEECH Recognizers\nSpeechRecognitionCoreLanguages this is the folder \nhit get info and look at the size simply copy and paste that folder and save it , if you need to install in another computer copy and paste the folder to that location , if you ever reinstall the system you don't need to re-download because you already have it\nhere is the link for the pkg i haven't try this pkg yet i just got you the link\nhttp://swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/55/13/031-1940/chpuvr2ntbhisy2em872b4j6hsk71croja/SpeechRecognitionCoreLanguage_en_US.pkg\n\nA: No, there is not a way to do this yet.

How can we replicate that function on iPhone?\n\nA: It's not possible to configure this five finger pinch gesture on an iPhone without jailbreaking it. Currently there are no jailbreaks for iOS 7 (see jailbrea.kr for available jailbreaks).\nIf the iPhone is a device with a version of iOS that can be jailbroken, then this can be achieved after a jailbreak using SBSettings and Activator (both installed through the Cydia app store). You can even assign custom gestures, like for example, a three finger pinch or a four finger pinch, for this action.\n", "Q: Outlook 2011 Reading pane: wrap the subject text instead of truncating with ellipsis When viewing a mail with longer subject, in reading pane it shows the subject only in one line and if it exceeds it truncates with ellipsis notation.\nIs there any way to display the complete subject with line wrapping? \nOne alternative is on hovering the subject,it shows the complete subject in a tooltip.\n\nA: Outlook 2011 does not provide a way to change the behavior from ellipsis to line wrapping however you can try the following options to achieve a similar result.\nOutlook 2011 contains 3 main window panes.  The navigation pane (furthest to the left), the email list pane (the middle pain that shows the list of emails -- I think this is the pane you wish to change) and lastly, the reading pane (furthest to the right).  This is the pane where you read the contents of a particular email.\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the location of the Reading Pane.  I think by default the reading pane shows on the right hand side of the application.  From the main menu in Outlook choose 'View > Reading Pane > Below'.  This moves the entire reading pane below the list of emails pane.  Moving the reading pane below the email list pane allows the email list pane to span more horizontal real estate thereby allowing more of the subject line to show.\n\n*Hide the Reading Pane.  This will turn off the reading pane all together.  This option will afford you more horizontal AND more vertical space.  To read an individual email you have to double click to open it.  Note that for both option 1 and 2, in the email list pane you may have to also adjust the columns that are displayed or the width of those columns in order to see more of the subject column.  Move the mouse over those column boundaries until you see the slider.  Click and hold the slider to make a column more or less wide.\n\n*Make the Reading Pane Smaller.  If moving the reading pane to below the email list pane or hiding it out right is not an option you could click and drag the left hand slider of the reading pane to the right.  By making the reading pane smaller (less wide) you are effectively increasing the width of the email list pane.  A wider width will show you more of the subject line.\nHappy Computing! \n", "Q: How do I get F11 and F12 to behave like normal function keys? I have a 2013 MacBook Pro Retina 15\" and I'm trying to set the function keys to perform as normal function keys.  So I want the behaviour to be inverted from the standard behaviour where I need to press Fn to get the keys to work normally.  I've enabled the setting in Preferences as shown below.\n\nThis works fine for all function keys except F11 and F12.\nFn + F11 and Fn + F12 both have the expected behaviour of adjusting the volume now, but when I press F11 by itself it enters Expose and when I press F12 by itself it launches Dashboard.\nHow can I get my F11 and F12 keys to just behave like normal function keys?\n\nA: Well I actually just figured this out.  In Preferences under Mission Control there were two options set to use the F11 and F12 keys.  I set these to '-' and that fixed the issue.  The options that were set to use these function keys are highlighted in the screenshot below.\n\n", "Q: How to select images from my Desktop in Keynote? In Keynote 6 you can edit images on master slides to serve as Media Placeholders. I've created a theme for our company that has several slides with Media Placeholders configured like this. \nProblem is that when someone adds an actual slide and clicks the media button on the placeholder a window pops up which apparently reads someones iPhoto library and only shows those images. Most of the images we use in our presentations are on the company NAS however so storing them in iPhoto isn't really practical.\n\nHow can I add folders to this media browser or make it so that when someone clicks the placeholder button, he can have a default Finder browser so he can select images from any location on his Mac?\n\nA: I had the same problem, but couldn't get it to work over this dialogue. It's kind of weird that you can only use images from Library Files over that button.\nThe solution is to go to \"image in the \"Format\" band on the right of Keynote. There is another button to \"replace\" the image. You can choose any file from there...\nHope that helps, since I'm from Germany I don't know the exact denotations in the English version. If you cannot find the right button, just let me know ;)\n\nA: You can also drag and drop photos from Desktop / Finder into Keynote. \n", "Q: iOS development: GameCenter and In-App activated default So I've created an application in XCode and I've tried to put it in the store.\nHowever, the options In-App purchases and GameCenter are activated and I cannot uncheck them.\nWhy are these on? And why can't I turn them off? I don't see why they should be active as my application has neither one of these.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nA: You cannot deselect them. As apple mentions here they are automatically added to explicit app ids. The only way to do not have them is to create a wildcard app id (which is not a solution in most cases as it has many drawbacks). \nThink of them as libraries added to your app. You do not have to use them and they change nothing to your project or to the way your app appears in the app store (unless you use them of course).\n", "Q: How to make the tags appear the old way on Mavericks? Is there a way to make the folders tagged in any color (red, blue, purple, etc.) appear in a more visible way than the OSX 10.9 way?\n\nFor instance, on OSX 10.8, the whole title of the item was colored.\nA long time ago (System 7), even the color of the folder was changed. \n\nA: There is no officially supported way to do this (and no unofficially supported hack that re-enables it either).  The behaviour of Tags in Mavericks as compared to Labels in every previous version of OS X is very different, and you cannot pick and choose elements to work in one way and have the rest to work in another, it's all or nothing I'm afraid, so if you are on Mavericks the best you can do is hope for a feature as part of a future OS update that adds extended options to tags.  I'm sure further tag options will be forthcoming, as it's essentially a V1 feature at present, and maybe this will be one of them.\n", "Q: Command line open pkg I am trying to write an app that will trigger an pkg to open so the user can install this.

I'm trying to install mod_pagespeed for Apache server, but I can find instructions only for Linux. Is there any tutorial or description on how to do it on Mac?\n\nA: mod_pagespeedis currently not supported. However, you can build it from source. Google is describing here how you can do that. \nInstead of using apt-get you can install brew. Brew is a lightweight package manager for OS X and can be obtained at their official homepage.\nI'd recommend to install a Linux distro on a VM and then installing mod_pagespeed as this is way easier, plus you get more support probably.\n", "Q: Open Preview in full page view Whenever I open a PDF that is of ordinary DIN A4 format, the Preview window is oriented such that I can only see the upper half of the PDF.

I recently spilled water on my computers keyboard, and as a result the left shift key seems to be stuck in the on position. This means that the system always boots into safe boot unless I hold down the option key. I have managed to change my password to one which is all caps and once I login I use keyremap4mac but it is still very annoying. Is there anyway which I can remap the keyboard during boot? Possibly with a startup bash script or something similiar? If that is not possible is there any way to use a script to bypass safe boot? I was planning on installing a new bootloader anyway in order to dual-boot linux, I don't know if this will help. Advice is appreciated.\n\nA: You could enable a firmware password.  When a firmware (EFI) password is active it prevents modifier keys during the boot process unless you first disable the firmware password.  Apple's KB article detailing this behavior - HT1352\nI'm going to assume that you can't boot to your recovery partition, or an installer disc, thanks to the stuck shift key.  Typically you would enable the firmware password from either of these options, however it's still possible to do from the OS.\nTo enable the firmware password while inside your OS, 10.7 or newer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter the following string in Terminal.  This enables the debug menu in Disk Utility. defaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1\n\n*Open Disk Utility and choose \"Show every partition\" from the Debug menu.\n\n*Your Recovery partition should now be visible on the left side of Disk Utility, select and click Mount to mount it in your system.\n\n*In Terminal, enter the copy & paste the following command to load the Recovery disk image. open /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg\n\n*The Recovery disk should open in a new window, browse to it's /Applications/Utilities folder.\n\n*Locate the Firmware Password application and double click to launch it.\n\n*Follow the on-screen instructions to enable a firmware password.  I would recommend keeping this password very simple and easy for you to remember.  The firmware password CAN be bypassed but the difficulty of doing so varies between Macs.\n\n\nIf your version of Mac OS X is 10.6 or older:\n\n\n*\n\n*While booted to your OS, insert the gray restore disc labeled \"Install Mac OS X\".\n\n*Open Terminal and copy & paste the following command, this will open a window showing the Utilities folder from the system installer. open /Volumes/Mac\\ OS\\ X\\ Install\\ DVD/Applications/Utilities\n\n*Double click the Firmware Password application to launch it.\n\n*Follow the on-screen instructions to enable a firmware password.\n\n", "Q: iTunes 11 - Difference between \"Play Next\" and \"Add to Up Next\" buttons Is there a difference between iTunes' \"Play Next\" and \"Add to Up Next\" buttons? (See screenshot above). They appear if I right click an album and it seems to me that they do the same thing: Adding the songs of the album (or artist) to my \"Up Next\" line.\n\n(source: m-i-u.de)\n\nA: 'Play Next' adds the song/album to be played directly, 'Add to Up Next' adds the song/album at the end of the songs/albums that have already been added to Up Next. For the first song/album, this will make no difference, but try adding a couple more and you'll see the difference.\nIn other words, 'Play Next' works as a stack - Last In First Out, while 'Add to Up Next' works as a queue - First In First Out.\n", "Q: User management for an AFP share I've been tasked with setting up an AFP share on a server running Mountain Lion. My question is mostly about best practices and to find out if I'm doing this right. My only prior experience has been (very) basic NFS and SMB shares focused mostly on Linux.\nSo here's the situation.\nThere will be (to start) approximately 7 or 8 users that will need access to various parts of the share. I basically need two access levels (for now). One that can access everything (an admin), and one that can only access a subset of everything. Pretty standard right?\nIn the sharing dialog, I can add shared folders and add users to the specific shares. So I've created the the shares and I was just going to add all the 2 or 3 admin users to all the shares, then the remaining users to the specific shares they need access to. The UI doesn't seem to expose anything of the nature, but can I manage the users independently of the shared folders? Put another way: can I mark a folder as belonging to a particular group and assign users to that group in order to grant them access to that particular share?\n\nA: My recommendation for best practices would be to use Server.app ($20 on the App Store) to perform file sharing. The benefit of using Server.app is that it supports more advanced file sharing configuration. For example: you can set ACLs (Access Control Lists - a list of permissions) on different folders for the group access that you want in System Preference -> Sharing. However, by default those ACEs (Access Control Entry - a single permissions entry in an ACL) will not support permissions inheritance. Permissions inheritance keeps file permissions in the share point set correctly (so that the entire group continues to have read/write access). The absence of inheritance becomes problematic when one user of the group has written a file to the share, and another user attempts to modify it - by default, the ACL that specifies read/write at the root of the share will not have inherited permissions to descendant files/folders\nThe best way to manage the permissions on a share point is usually to do it by creating groups. That way, you can set the permissions on share points to allow group access to the folder/share. This makes it easy to provide users access to that share in the future, as you'd simply add them into the group. For example: most \"normal\" users (including the \"admin\" users) should be part of a group that's allowed access to the general-use shares (or all shares, as you've mentioned). Your \"admin\" users will be part of a group that has access to the other \"restricted\" share points. Setting each of those groups up as an entry (ACE) in Server.app -> File Sharing will allow permissions inheritance to occur.\nIf you really want to use the System Preferences -> File Sharing setup to serve files, I'd recommend using System Preferences -> Users & Groups to create groups to control access. However, be aware that you will likely run into permissions problems somewhere down the road.\nAlthough you can use chmod on the command line to specify ACLs that do support inheritance, it's a little bit cumbersome for some users.\n", "Q: Disable Esc shortcut to quit Fullscreen Some apps (Safari, iTunes...) quits fullscreen mode on Esc keyboard shortcut. Is there a way to disable it? It interferes e. g. with web apps control resulting in unintentional quitting fullscreen when you just hit one more Escape than you should. \n\nA: It is way easier - in Firefox:\n\n*\n\n*In the URL bar write \"about:config\"\n\n*Agree with security risks\n\n*Search for \"escape\", it should find the entry browser.fullscreen.exit_on_escape\n\n*Double click on \"true\", it should go to \"false\"\n\n\nA: Good question. Before browser makers figured out cmd-q was awfully dangerous without at least a prompt that the user really wants to close 60 tabs, I always changed the keyboard shortcut for the Quit command on my main browser. You can disable shortcuts via Keyboard Shortcuts.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences: Keyboard.\n\n*Click Keyboard Shortcuts in the top pill shaped tab.\n\n*Click the Applications Shortcuts icon in the left hand column.\n\n*Choose Safari from the drop down menu of offered applications (looks like the default list is applications which have been opened in the last  three months).\n\n\n*Enter the exact name of the menu item you wish to disable. In this case \"Exit Full Screen\".\n\n*Add an alternative keyboard shortcut (in this illustration, I added Ctrl-Opt-Cmd-c)\n\nThis is what the finished result looks like.\n\n\n*Test (alternative Application Shortcuts do now always work exactly as planned).\n\n\nYou can do the same thing with Keyboard Maestro (and much much more). Apple's feature is probably taken/adopted from Peter N. Lewis's implementation (which existed for many years before Apple came up with the feature in Snow Leopard). In Keyboard Maestro, you can also assign the same shortcut to multiple applications. In Keyboard Maestro, you can also take over keyboard commands which do not have menu items (complex applications like Photoshop come to mind: there are so many commands that many of the commands have no menu equivalent). It's also easier to move these preferences around from computer to computer if you are using Keyboard Maestro.\n\nOn the other hand the Apple version exists on all Macs past 10.6.8, including your less technical girlfriend's MacBook Pro. I use both depending on whether I want a quick fix or if I'm building permanent tools/shortcuts for an application I use professionally on multiple computers. Keyboard Maestro does far more than just substitute keyboard shortcuts: you can write sequential macros with pauses to automate what would otherwise be five or ten keypress and click type actions, i.e. redirecting, address and send email to someone else in the company with a single keyboard command.\n\nA: When it comes to Safari, then for macOS 12.3, Safari 15.4 and Tampermonkey 4.17.6162 ($2 in App Store), this script (based on https://superuser.com/a/388993/620906) works for most websites:\n// ==UserScript==\n// @name           Keep Full Screen\n// @namespace     http://superuser.com/q/315949\n// @description    Prevents Escape key from leaving full screen.\n// @include      https://*\n// @include      http://*\n// ==/UserScript==\n\ndocument.onkeydown = function (evt) {\n    if (evt.keyCode == 27) evt.preventDefault();\n}\n\nAnd you can usually still use Esc to close modals!\n\nA: Oh, finally I did it!\nUsing Better Touch Tool app (but I think other such apps might work as well).\nAdded a custom keyboard shortcut ⎋Escape for Final Cut Pro which does nothing.\nAs a drawback, you won't be able to do useful things with Escape key (i.e. closing Preferences window).\n\n\nA: If you use BetterTouchTool (which is amazing, and everyone should use it), I found a really easy trick which works for Safari, and should work for any other browser too. Do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Create a new app-specific keyboard shortcut in BTT for your preferred web browser\n\n*Set \"ESC\" as the trigger key, and set \"Shift + ESC\" as the assigned action.\n\nShift + ESC seems to cause exactly the same behavior as ESC for everything I use ESC for in the web browser (like removing focus from a text box, or exiting an in-page text search), but Shift + ESC does not trigger full-screen mode exit for the browser window, so the resulting behavior is exactly what I want!\nHope that helps!\n\nA: To avoid the situation when the whole app quits fullscreen mode when you accidentally hit ESC twice you can learn to use a different key.\nCmd-. will quit web apps that are in fullscreen (e.g. YouTube) but will not perform any undesirable actions when used twice.\n", "Q: How to analyze/resolve Gmail timeouts in Apple Mail? I am using Google Apps/Gmail with Apple Mail on OS X Mavericks. For some reason, sending email is extremely slow (minutes to hours) and I constantly get this message:\n\nThe server returned the error: The connection to the server “imap.gmail.com” on port 993 timed out.\n\nThere are often (but not always) little error triangles on the inboxes.\nDoes anyone know why this happens and what I can do to solve the issue?\n\nA: Close Apple Mail and flush your DNS cache - imap.gmail.com is actually a collection of servers and occasionally your DNS will send you a bad one.\nIn El Capitan the command is sudo dscacheutil -flushcache\nIt's different for earlier versions.\nEven the connection logging in Mail didn't show that DNS was the problem, only that it was a timeout in my case. Unfortunately this is only one possibility.\nA way to check is by running the following in Terminal:\n$ telnet imap.gmail.com 993\nTrying 64.233.187.109...\nConnected to gmail-imap.l.google.com.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n\ntest\nFConnection closed by foreign host.\n\n(I typed test there, and the server doesn't understand that so I get disconnected. This proves that the connection between the computer and GMail is fine)\n\nA: There are many discussions of this around (example).  One thing that seems to work for some is:\nTry pointing at imap.googlemail.com instead of imap.gmail.com.\n\nA: \nTry pointing at imap.googlemail.com instead of imap.gmail.com.\n\nThis seems to help, but doesn't entirely resolve the issue.\nHere's a screenshot showing how to change the 'Incoming Mail Server' setting in the Mail.app preference pane.\n\n-Greg\n", "Q: Dragging files onto desktop causes Finder window to unwantedly open Every time I drag a file onto my desktop, my finder folder opens.

I have an iPad 3 iOS5.1.1 jailbroken.\nNow that iOS 7 (exactly 7.0.3) is on the Apple update servers, I want to know if I am able to update my iOS to 6.1.2 or not.  \nI downloaded the firmware of 6.1.2 and want to update to this except iOS 7.0.3.\nAnytime I want to update it via iTunes, it wants to check it with Apple servers and obviously they say you should upgrade to 7.0.3.  \nIs there any way I can upgrade my iOS to 6.1.2?\n\nA: This answer has been moved to a more generic question: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/114076/18387\n", "Q: Do the 2013 Time Capsules work as a NAS drive? Can I partition the 2013 Time Capsules to use some of their storage as a network drive?\n\nA: No. The internal drive gets shared as one volume. You would need to layer user access controls to set up folders for different uses within the same share.\nBut you can attach an external drive to the USB port and access that as shared storage from any peripheral on your network. Those show up as separate volumes when you use the stock Apple firmware on the Time Capsule.\n\nA: Can we revisit this a minute?\nWhat does this mean? \n\n\"You would need to layer user access controls to set up folders for\n  different uses within the same share.\"\n\nI have a 128 SSD and a 256 SSD on two MBA's\nNo way i need 2 TB to that up.

Now I have to create a web app for iPhone (it just opens a website inside an app).\nI tried installing Xcode 5, but it's not compatible with OS X 10.8.4. I think I have to download Xcode 4, but I can't find it anywhere?\nHow do I install Xcode on OS X 10.8.4?\n(I can't update this OS X because the Mac is not mine.)\n\nA: Old Xcode versions can be downloaded from developer.apple.com, free registration is required for this. To install (and distribute) your own applications, you'll need to register as an iOS developer. This costs $99/year but can easily be done later.\nHaving said that, you may not even need to develop an app for what you have in mind. In Mobile Safari you can save any web site/URL as an application icon on your home screen. When tapped on, this will open the web site as an application.\n\nA: The Below links you get free download for Xcode 4.6.3\nXcode 4.6.3 download\nNote:\nYou may also get via torrents \n", "Q: Terminal app Tabs, how to position next to current tab instead of at the end I use Cmd-T all the time to open new tabs, and it's set to use the same directory.\nHowever, it positions the new tab as the last / far right tab in the window, instead of next to the current tab that I'm in.  Since it's often related to what I'm working on, I'd like to appear right next to the current tab.\nIs there a setting for this?  (found lots of things about Terminal and Tabs, but not this specific question)\nThanks\n\nA: It is possible in nightly release of the alternative terminal program iTerm2 via Preferences → Advanced → Tabs: New tabs are added at the end, not next to current tab set to No.\n\nA: I think Apple has changed this behavior, somewhere in the High Sierra updates, so that now the new terminal comes up next to the one I'm in - cool!\n", "Q: How to solve international credit card issues? The issue is:\nI had an US account which some iTunes gift card credit on it. Using this credit, I bought the game Magic 2014. I played a lot and after some time I decided to buy its expansion through an in game buy.\nIn the mean time between my first purchase of the game and the purchase of the expansion I decided to switch my iPad to my Brazilian account, since I got bored of buying iTunes gift cards. Since then my iPad was always using my BR account, but all my apps kept installed, some bought at the US store and some at the BR store.\nIn game, I pressed the buy button and bought it using my BR credit card, which was rejected. Now I want to pay for my expansion and to keep playing my game. \nI need to contact apple and ask them to try to charge my credit-card again, but how do I do that? I haven't even received any email about this... it only tells me that my purchase was not processed...\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Your question seems to boil down to \"How do I contact support to resolve billing-related account issues?\"\nWhich has the easy answer: http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/account/\nI'm not sure about the long path you took to get to that question though.\n", "Q: What app places a lower-case 'd' icon in the menu bar?

I now have a new one and would like all the photos I had backed up on iCloud on my new Mac. How do I do this?\n\nA: If the photos were in Photo Stream, then you can go to System Preferences → iCloud, log in and check the box for Photos. Then, open iPhoto/Aperture and let it download the photos.\nIf the photos were added to iCloud by a specific app, go to System Preferences → iCloud, log in and check the box for Documents & Data, then open the app that you used to back up the photos.\nIf the photos were manually backed up to the Mobile Documents folder, go to System Preferences → iCloud, log in and check the box for Documents & Data, then wait for your files to sync.\n", "Q: Is it possible to enable shift+click in icon view in the Finder? I would like to use the shift+click selection method on windows within the Finder that are using icon view.  Unfortunately, whilst it works fine in the other views to block highlight all files between the first and second click, its behaviour changes to operate the same as cmd+click in icon view.\nI have a few hundred images in the folder and I want to select a big range to move it to a separate folder. The range is higher than my screen, so it needs be scrolled down - to a point. This is one of the most frequent situations in dealing with images. I don't know which images are which just by their filenames. I need to see them to select them. I don't want to drag the mouse/trackpad to select the range, as I need to be extra cautious about the scroll speed that way. It's infinitely more convenient to use the Apple's all-glorified trackpad (two-finger scrolling) that admittedly does work great. Then, when I find the last picture, I want to shift-click it and have the range selected.\nIs there any way to get this working in icon view, or can anyone at least attempt to explain why it does not work, and if it's perhaps a bug or maybe a conscious decision to implement it in this way?\n\nA: \nWhen they take that feature away from me, what is my benefit?\n\nThey didn't \"take that feature away\"; OS X has never had it. Obviously, we can't know exactly why OS X doesn't have it, so your question cannot be definitively answered in the way you insist upon. But here's my hypothesis:\nFinder items in Icon View don't always have an obvious order the way they do always do in List View. They start being arranged in rows by whatever you have it set to arrange by, but you can then drag icons to any position, and that position will be (in theory) remembered forever. If your icons are haphazardly arranged, how is OS X to divine which items are \"between\" any given two items? \nThey could come up with some algorithm, but given that your icons could be scattered amongst arbitrary pixel-granular coordinates, there would undoubtedly be cases where it didn't do the thing you thought you wanted. For that matter, also unlike List View, items in Icon View can be located outside the viewable bounds of the Finder window on both axes, and shift-click range selecting would then sometimes select icons you can't see and had no idea were being selected.\nSo, if anything, what you \"gain\" by this behavior is an assurance against accidentally moving/copying/trashing your files without expecting or knowing it.\n\nA: Here is a workaround. In Icon View, select the first and last items using Command-click.  Change to List View.  Command-click the first or last item to de-select it, and then Shift-click the same item to select the entire range.\n\nA: There IS a way of doing it clever clogs! Click on the screen (not on the ICON) and drag a box around the icons you which to highlight ... Voila!\n\nA: Using a combination of the Shift / ⌘ key, mouse ‘marquee selection’, and (if necessary), scrolling, you can essentially ‘shift select’ items across multiple rows in icon view using this three step process, and it’s really not too inconvenient:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the top row, drag a marquee selection with the mouse (via either click and drag or three-finger drag), from the beginning of where you want to select to the end of that particular row.\n\n*Then, while holding the Shift / ⌘ key, start dragging a marquee selection over the whole second row (after which you can release the Shift / ⌘ key), and simply move the cursor to the bottom of the screen to let it continue adding however many ‘whole rows’ you want before you reach your final (custom, not whole) row.*\n\n*While pressing the Shift / ⌘ key a final time, marquee-select the items wanted in the LAST row, in the same way the top row was.\nDONE! Pretty quick.\nI agree, that it’s unintuitive to not be able to simply, shift-select items in icon view like you can in the other views - but you can at least shift-select EXISTING mouse selections, indeed that of ANY randomness as you need like 2 middle images in one row plus the two last images in a row five rows down!\n\n* With Apple’s trackpad, you have the additional option of scrolling, (down, or up), to choose the size of your ‘middle’ whole-row, multi-row selection, arguably with finer granularity, to control, correct or pace the ‘big jump’ if need be, with small, big or medium scroll movements, both up or down! My own test with an external mouse however shows even that can scroll during shift-selection, albeit with not as much fine control like Apple's trackpad.\n", "Q: How to bring focus to Show Fonts dialog (eg. in TextEdit) on a MacBook Pro keyboard? I'm a quick typist and I don't want to use the mouse/trackpad unless I absolutely have no way to do something on a keyboard. It slows me down by at least 5 times.\nNow, for example, TextEdit is on. I'm typing. If I want to change the font size, I can select (SHIFT-arrows) and use CMD+ and CMD- keyboard shortcuts. Works fine.\nHowever, if I want to change the font, I can hit CMD-T to bring up the Show Fonts dialog. And that's it, the end of keyboard. I must move my hand and aim with the cursor to select the font.\nIs there a way to bring the focus to the Show Fonts dialog from the keyboard, without having to resort to the trackpad?\nPlease keep in mind that this is about the laptop keyboard (MBP Retina), so it's not the full keyboard.\nPlease avoid answers like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why do you want to access the Show Fonts dialog from the keyboard?\n\n*Apple's trackpad is magnificent, you should use it, believe me it's better.\n\n\nA: After you open the Show Fonts window, you can press Ctrl+F6 to bring focus to the floating Fonts window. To return focus to the window you were in, you can press Ctrl+F4.\nOn a laptop, you'll also need to hold Fn when you press the above keyboard shortcuts unless you go to System Preferences > Keyboard and check \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\".\nAfter you move focus to the Fonts window, you can press Tab and Shift+Tab to cycle focus through the different columns and the search field.\n\nA: Actually, CTRL+F6 will set focus to a floating window in other applications too.\nFor example, it can be really handy in Apple Pages word processor.\nTo show Inspector hit ALT-CMD-I, then CTRL-F6 to set focus on in.\nFrom that point on you can access all fields with TAB and SHIFT-TAB.\nI'm guessing that this holds true for any app with a floating window.\n", "Q: In iTerm, why is a command shell's command not picking up things on my $PATH? I've got a script in my ~/.bin directory that changes iTerm's background before starting an SSH session (as detailed here, script slightly modified from this version).\nIf I start a regular login session and run my command, sshb servername, it works fine! The background image loads and the SSH session starts.\nHowever, if I set up a profile to start a session with that same command, it errors out and says it can't find sshb. If I make my command ~/.bin/sshb servername, it runs the command, but says it can't find the ImageMagick convert command used in that script.\nIt seems as though the command shell command doesn't know about my $PATH. I suppose I could figure out where convert lives and edit the script to use the full path, but that seems to be treating symptoms, not the problem. Is there a way to make the command shell load my environment variables before it runs that command?\n\nA: Environment variables like PATH and TERM are normally inherited from the shell. When you run the script directly, they are unset.\nYou can run the script as a child process of a login shell by setting the command to bash -lc \"~/.bin/sshb servername\".\n", "Q: OS X Mavericks Screen brightness auto adjusting even when option is disabled Now I know from trying to find an answer to this to go uncheck the auto adjust box, since apparently it got checked when I updated to Mavericks, but now it seems my MacBook Pro has a mind of its own and still feels the need to auto adjust when I'm not doing anything.\nI made sure 10 times at least that the auto adjust box wasn't checked, and it's not. So why is my Mac randomly doing this? (and btw, this only started today, and I got the update on the first day it was available)\n\nA: I was just struggling with the same issue—it really annoyed the hell out of me. What helped me was a good ol' SMC reset:\nSee http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964 on how to do it.\n\nA: It may have to do with your charger.\nI had the same problem; look at your charger, the lights probably keep changing from green to orange to nothing. When you plug in your adapter it automatically adjusts your brightness, the bad contact makes it do this over and over again.\n\nA: I found that disabling \"Automatic graphics switching\" in the \"Energy Saver\" system preferences dialog fixed the problem (at least temporarily).\nEDIT: Later in the evening, when I wanted to keep my brightness low, the bug recurred, then spontaneously disappeared again.\n\nA: I just had this issue when \"upgrading\" the OS.  It stopped auto-adjusting after I unchecked the box \"Slightly dim the display while on battery power.\"  This is found in System Preferences / Energy Saver / Battery.  I know that's a different function, but it would appear there's a bug where the auto-adjust is tied to that checkbox instead of the one it's supposed to be tied to.\n\nA: Are you sure? \nSystem Preferences -> Displays -> Display -> Automatically adjust brightness\n\n\n\nA: I had the same problem - have just downloaded this ap and fingers crossed, it seems to be holding the brightness levels steady.\nhttp://www.resexcellence.com/2013/01/29/control-mac-screen-brightness-with-shady/\n", "Q: Headphones not detected when connected to MBP When I plug headphones into output of MBP (15-inch Early 2008) with Mavericks - nothing changes, sound comes from internal speakers, nothing in System Preferences too.

Since its a hardware issue, better take it to  apple store and get the jack replaced.\n\nA: Funny, but despite the fact that headphones are working in linux properly - after replacing the small board with audio and power components - everything works fine on mac os x now :D\n\nA: I tried all of the above.  What finally fixed the problem was resetting the PRAM.  Reboot. After the screen goes black and before the apple logo appear, basically at the moment it starts coming back, hold down command-option-P-R.  Continue holding through the boot sound until the screen blacks and the apple logo appears a second time.\nThat should do it.\n", "Q: Where are my finder windows after a reboot I have a late 2011 MBP, running Mac OS X 10.7.5, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5, with 16GB 1600 MHz DDR3.\nWhen I reboot and I try to open a Finder window with command + n or from the menu \nFile > New Finder Window \nI see the window open and then disappear somewhere off to the left or right off the screen.\nIf I open multiple windows the same thing happens.\nWhen I invoke App Expose I can see all the Finder windows I opened but as soon as I close App Expose they disappear again. \nI cannot drag or select the windows in any way.\nWhen a second monitor is connected I tried dragging them onto the second monitor but that does not help either.\nThe only thing I found works is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press: command + alt+esc ;\n\n*Select Finder;\n\n*Click Relaunch.\n\n\nNormal behaviour resumes. \nIs there any way to troubleshoot this behaviour and stop it?\n\nUpdate:\nThis has just happened again, and this time I took a video.  \nWhen the finder windows appear in this video, that is when I am changing desktops with command+ right.

be causing the problem. If you restart with the [shift] key held down does it make a difference?\nHolding the [shift] key down at startup until you get to the login screen and see 'Safe Boot' at the login window prevents 3rd party extensions from loading which will help you determine if it's the KeyRemap4MacBook extension that's causing the problem.\nMore on Safe Boot here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1564\nI would hazard a guess that you updated the OS to 10.9 without updating KeyRemap4MacBook to a Mavericks compatible version.\nI looked again, you appear to be running v 9.0 which is the latest version. My guess then would be a messed up preference file or cache.\n~W\n", "Q: How can I change my shell language localization on the macOS command line? I have a Mountain Lion macbook and it's default locale is english, it's keyboard is english (US) as well. I need to change the language that the terminal replies to Swedish.\nFor example,\nInstead of replying \"Connection Refused\" for a failed telnet, it should say \"Forbindelse Vagras\" (which is the Swedish translation)\nEDIT:\nI have tried setting LANG=sv_SE.UTF-8 and same with LC_ALL, to no effect\nHave also tried changing system-wide settings, which changes the language in the entire system but not the zsh shell.\nIs this split localization possible on macOS?\n\nA: In the terminal enter\nexport LANG=sv_SE.UTF-8\n\nYou can add that to ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc for zsh) in order to change the language for all terminal sessions.\nAll command line tools that are localized should now print the output in Swedish.\nHowever, those command line tools that were built without localization but use hard-coded texts cannot be changed in any way (except on source code level, of course), your example telnet being one of them.\n\nA: I imagine you'll want to set the LANG environment variable.\n", "Q: Getting launchd to read program arguments correctly I have a launchd script where the command I'm trying to run is erroring (apparently that's not a word, it is now), complaining of improper usage.\nThe specific error I'm getting is the command's usage text dumped to the system log. From this I infer the other info (path to the command, timing etc.) in the plist is being parsed correctly, just not the command's options.\nAfter the command usage I have one last line:\n18/11/2013 09:30:00.101 com.apple.launchd.peruser.501: (fake.lable.seti[33833]) Exited with code: 1\n\nBut that just means \"I exited with an error\".\nI know launchd splits the command from its options and in the man page tells you about ProgramArguments: \"...Please note: many people are confused by this key. Please read execvp(3) very carefully!..\"\nWell I read execvp(3) and I'm none the wiser, so I'm asking you lovely lot.\nNormally, running the command from the terminal it'd look like this:\n/Library/Application\\ Support/BOINC\\ Data/boinccmd --host localhost --passwd gobbledygook --project http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/ update\n\nThis works a treat.\nAnd this is how I've split it in the Program/ProgramArguments section of my LaunchAgent plist:\n<key>Program</key>\n    <string>/Library/Application Support/BOINC Data/boinccmd</string>\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>--host localhost</string>\n        <string>--passwd gobbledygook</string>\n        <string>--project http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/ update</string>\n    </array>\n\n(for the record, I originally had the path to boinccmd \\escaped out, but that doesn't work, launchd escapes spaces in the path for you)\nI've tried splitting the arguments down further:\n<key>Program</key>\n    <string>/Library/Application Support/BOINC Data/boinccmd</string>\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>--host</string>\n        <string>localhost</string>\n        <string>--passwd</string>\n        <string>gobbledygook</string>\n        <string>--project</string>\n        <string>http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/</string>\n        <string>update</string>\n    </array>\n\nBut that didn't seem to work either.\nAs ever, I'm very sure I'm missing something so simple.\nThanks.\n\nANSWER:\nThe first line of ProgramArguments needs to be the path to the program. This is what was tripping me up and indeed what was probably meant by the \"...Please read very carefully!..\" comment :)\nI also found I had to split the arguments down to their component parts. When I had all that in place the whole thing works a charm. Thank you very much.\n<key>Program</key>\n    <string>/Library/Application Support/BOINC Data/boinccmd</string>\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Library/Application Support/BOINC Data/boinccmd</string>\n        <string>--host</string>\n        <string>localhost</string>\n        <string>--passwd</string>\n        <string>gobbledygook</string>\n        <string>--project</string>\n        <string>http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/</string>\n        <string>update</string>\n    </array>\n\nA final edit to say for an easy to understand explanation as to WHY this should be, see SirPavlova's explanation.\n~W\n\nA: Based on the man page for exec(3), it seems that the first program argument should be the path to the executable:\nThe execv(), execvp(), and execvP() functions provide an array of pointers to null-terminated strings\n that represent the argument list available to the new program.  The first argument, by convention,\n should point to the file name associated with the file being executed. The array of pointers must be\n terminated by a NULL pointer.\n\nIf you can specify the path to the executable as the argument at index 0, it may help...\n\nA: The Program key specifies the file to execute, & the ProgramArguments key specifies the arguments which will be passed to the executing process. Strictly speaking you can pass whatever arguments you want to a process, but the convention is that the first one should be the name by which the process was invoked, so most programs ignore their first argument.‡ The file to execute is obviously necessary information, but if the  Program key is is missing, launchd pretends it has the same value as the first argument in ProgramArguments purely as a convenience.\nYour first example starts boinccmd & gives it arguments that would be equivalent to the terminal command\n--host\\ localhost --passwd\\ gobbledygook --project\\ http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/\\ update\n\nwhich tells boinccmd that you invoked it as \"--host localhost\" & only passed it two weird arguments.\nYour second example separates the arguments correctly, but as Eddie Kelley suggested it needs one inserted at the front. It tells boinccmd that you invoked it as \"--host\", then passed another six arguments. boinccmd can recognise the last five as being two options, but has no idea what the \"localhost\" business is about. As far as boinccmd can tell, it was invoked from the terminal as\n/Library/Application\\ Support/BOINC\\ Data/boinccmd localhost --passwd gobbledygook --project http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/ update\n\n(note the missing \"--host\").\nboinccmd is probably one of the great majority of programs that don't care what their first argument is, so you could probably actually just shove <string>HELLO</string> at the head of the ProgramArguments array, but it's probably cleaner to remove the Program key altogether & just use this:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Library/Application Support/BOINC Data/boinccmd</string>\n        <string>--host</string>\n        <string>localhost</string>\n        <string>--passwd</string>\n        <string>gobbledygook</string>\n        <string>--project</string>\n        <string>http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/</string>\n        <string>update</string>\n    </array>\n\n‡ It can seem like a meaningless redundancy, but some programs use this to good effect: bash et al. act as login shells if their first argument begins with -, & Vim enters various emulation modes if its first argument is ed or vi instead of vim.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have one menu bar while having displays as separate spaces in Mavericks? The Mavericks feature \"Displays have separate spaces\" is nice except for one thing: With vertically arranged displays, you need to aim for the menu bar in the lower display. \nThis breaks the primary advantage of having the menu bar on the top of the display, which is that one can just throw the pointer upwards, and it will hit the menu bar and stop. (Fitts' law.)\nIs it possible to have the best of both worlds: Separate spaces for my displays, but only one menu bar, located in my main display?\n\nA: There's no built in function afaik. \nHowever - even if you manage to hide the menu bar via terminal magic (don't know if there is) you will still face the issue that windows can't lap over the monitor (since windows can't lap between spaces), you can only move the complete window to one space/monitor or the other\n\nA: The only thing that works, is to have at least one window in the current application displayed on the top screen.\nOtherwise, you will just need to aim for the menu bar for apps displayed on the lower screen.\n", "Q: Is there a way to view and control the powerstate of the discrete GPU on a 2011 MBP in OSX? I noticed that running with the discrete GPU uses more power and generates more heat. I just need the discrete GPU to drive an external monitor, I'm not concerned about performance.\nBy controling the power state I expect to control the voltage and frequency of the GPU. This could be achieved by either changing the power state of the GPU or the voltage and frequency directly.\nI just want to make sure that the MBP runs as cool as possible.\n\nA: I use gfxCardStatus to see and control if my discrete GPU is in use. Is that what you want?\nTo see how much power is consumed you can use iStat Menu for example...\n", "Q: use MBP as external screen I've done some search about it, leading me to this link which provide support for using it with another mac. What I'd like to do is use it with another device (like a ps3) via HDMI & Thunderbolt. I've got a late 2011 mbp 15\"\n\nA: I've researched this topic myself, and everything I've found says that the HDMI port and/or Thunderbolt port on Macs is not meant as a display input. You can't use it for that purpose.\nHowever, something that may work, if you're willing to spend money, is a capture card. I've used them for recording video game footage before. The one I use has a noticeable lag. It's split from the TV to the capture card, and what happens on the TV takes 1 or 2 seconds to display on the input from the capture card.\nIf you could find one without lag, or with very minimal lag, it'd be usable for gaming purposes. Of course, if you're trying to hook up something that doesn't need to be lag free, such as a movie player, or anything else that plays non-actively controlled media (actively-controlled media would be video games, and pretty much nothing else), you could do with a capture card that has some lag.\nThis is a capture card that advertises OS X compatibility: http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/intensity/\nIt has probably any input you could need. I'm not sure if it lags or not, as I have not used it. Also, you have to consider the fact that they may use proprietary software for recording. If they do, and there's no way to display a video stream without recording, it's probably not a good solution for you. \nSome quick searching seems to indicate there is no noticeable lag with Blackmagic's Intensity capture cards. It also seems to suggest that their software can display without recording. I don't know if you can full screen it or not. Or if you can display a video stream in a program of your choice.\nEdit: I just noticed on their site, they said it supports streaming. And doing so with \"all leading streaming software\" too. Which would suggest that it does provide a video stream, which you could utilize in a program of your choice, and also display in full screen.\n\nA: as far as I know, Target Display Mode are supported only on iMacs, which means only iMacs can accept input from other Macs.\nOlder iMacs with Mini Display Ports are able, through third-party adapter of course, to receive input from devices like PS3 or Xbox. That feature or hack no longer work as new iMacs feature Thunderbolt which requires the other end of the device to be a Thunderbolt-equipped Mac.\nThat being said, I will say capture cards would be your best option, as what superriku11 suggested.\n", "Q: What does it mean to have \"custom access\"? I'm having some permissions-related trouble with OSX clients and a Samba server.\nWhen I create, for example, a new directory on the mounted share, it will be created with rwxr-xr-x permissions. But when I open the info window for the directory in Finder, it will tell me \"You have custom access\" and it won't allow me to display or change the permissions for the directory.\nWhat is the message trying to tell me and why won't Finder let me change the permissions?\n\nA: Generally, the \"You have custom access\" can indicate that the file has more complex permissions set than the Finder's Get Info window can display. From this Apple support article:\nCustom: If the permissions for an item is set to Custom, the permissions have been configured in a way that is more complex than is provided in the basic user settings.\n\nIt's possible that the files on your SMB server have Access Control Lists setup. You may be able to get additional information about these (non-POSIX) permissions in OS X by using a command like ls -ale /Path/To/Folder.\nIt's probably also worth noting that the Finder may have problems setting permissions on your SMB share. I'd probably recommend configuring some sort of server-side permissions inheritance (i.e., using ACLs) to keep permissions in check on your share.\n", "Q: MAMP always grabbing focus when quitting an app in Mavericks Upgraded from Lion to Mavericks and now when quitting any app, MAMP is always grabbing the focus instead of the previously opened app e.g. open MAMP, open Safari, open TextWrangler, quit TextWrangler, MAMP has focus instead of Safari. This was working fine in Lion. Anyone seeing similar behaviour or know how to fix it?\n\nA: I have this issue sometimes with several applications, all i do is to quit and reopen Google Chrome and everything get back to work as expected. \n", "Q: Errorr kernel SMC::smcReadKeyAction in Console I have OSX 10.9 Maverics on my iMac and I got this message (in Console) every few seconds:\nkernel[0]: SMC::smcReadKeyAction ERROR TH0P kSMCBadArgumentError(0x89) fKeyHashTable=0x0xffffff802af9b000\n\nAny idea ?\n\nA: The culprit can be a fan controll program you may have previously installed.\nTo my knowledge there are two possible candidates (FanControl & smcFanControl but there may be more that have the same problem).\nYou can verify if you have them installed and eliminate if needed.\nNOTE: this problem is similar but not equal to this one Kernel SMC::smcReadKeyAction error The other one is for another version of OSX.\n\nProcedure to check & eliminate FanControl\nOpen terminal and search for FanControl:\n$ ps -ef | grep -i fan\n0   145     1   0 Gio12am ??         3:58.07 /Library/StartupItems/FanControlDaemon/FanControlDaemon run\n\nThis tell you that you really have FanControlDaemon running as pid 145 as PidNumber\nTo eliminate it :\n$ cd /Library/StartupItems/\n$ sudo rm -Rf FanControlDaemon/\n\nand then kill the daemon:\n$ sudo kill PidNumber\n\nWARNING: if you replicate this procedure replace PidNumber with the PID you get from ps -ef \nThis eliminate the messages for me.\n\nProcedure to check & eliminate smcFanControl\nI also try to run the current version of another fan controll utility called smcFanControl (version is 2.4) and it seem to not work in Maverics (no window) but it produce near the same message in Console:\n15/11/13 14:19:35,000 kernel[0]: SMC::smcReadKeyAction ERROR TC0F kSMCBadArgumentError(0x89) fKeyHashTable=0x0xffffff802af9b000\n\nNote that for smcFanControl you got \"ERROR TC0F\" instead of \"ERROR TH0P\".\nIf you have this problem you can try to find and kill the process \"smcFanControl\" instead.\n$ ps -ef | grep -i fan\n501 45716   254   0  2:44pm ??         0:00.38 /Users/dave/Downloads/firefox/smcfancontrol_2_4/smcFanControl.app/Contents/MacOS/smcFanControl\n\nIf you find it then kill the rogue process as explained before.\n\nA: I too have the same error and I am using smcFanControl 2.4 with Maverics.

I have been using this machine for a couple of years. I just start it with \nsudo apachectl start\n\nBut, after the upgrade to 10.9 a problem has surfaced (I'm not sure if these are related). Sometimes the httpd daemon stops answering requests. That is, I try to telnet mymachine 80 and it just hangs there.\nBut, I still can ssh my machine and that works. Immediately after I connect via ssh the httpd daemon starts responding. So, I am guessing it was sleeping? But then, right after I disconnect from ssh the httpd also stops responding (sometimes, other times it runs fine).\nI have already checked under System Preferences → Energy Saver. I have it set to Computer \"Never go to sleep\".\nThis is also true when using the $20 \"OS X Server\" app to run the web server.\n\nA: I think the answer is \"Stop pressing the Power Button\".\nI had read that tapping the power button in Mavericks would turn off the monitor. In fact this is wrong, it puts the machine to sleep. \nIt is a very light sleep because the machine will still respond to 'ssh' requests, and the moment one tries to ssh into the machine the httpd will magically wake up. But, if no one tries to ssh, the httpd daemon will stop responding a minute or so after one taps the power button.\nI was sometimes tapping the power button to turn of the monitor. I have stopped doing that. So far so good. \nMore updates if this turns out to be the wrong answer.\n", "Q: Logic X's synths look distorted I'm not sure if this is a legacy thing, or if I'm being stupid, but when I open the ES1/ES2 whatever in Apple Logic X, it shows me something tiny and illegible \nI'm guessing this is just cause Apple decided not to update these, but can someone confirm?\n\nA: That's what it has always looked like. It hasn't been updated for LPX.\n\nA: This is due to the View settings in the top right (Zoom). Change to 100% and it should be ok (although  quite small on large screens). \nThis has been improved on the latest versions of Logic X.\n", "Q: Mac won't finish logging in after restart, must shut down to login completely Not sure if this is a duplicate question (I haven't been able to find a question dealing with this yet). Here's my problem:\nCurrently on OSX Mavericks.\n\n\n*\n\n*I restart my machine.\n\n*It shuts down and starts back up.\n\n*I get the login screen.\n\n*I enter in my login credentials successfully.\n\n*I'm passed to the interstitial white/gray screen that you typically get when starting up.\n\n*Instead of continuing the login process, it just hangs on this screen and never logs in.\n\n\nIf I shut down completely and then turn my computer on, I can log in with no issues.\nAny ideas how I can fix this issue?\n\nA: Since I posted this question, I ran Disk Utility. I repaired some permissions. When I restarted again, it logged in properly. At this point I can't find any other issues.\nI guess the moral of the story is run Disk Utility first before posting in the future.\n", "Q: Reinstall Mavericks update When Mavericks came out I've (as many others) installed the update. But something went wrong. First of all update didn't finish properly. It stayed on the last step in \"less than 1 minute left\" state for multiple hours, then screen became black and I rebooted my Mac Mini. System rebooted and loaded without problems, so I've decided that it was some unimportant glitch. But now my system misbehave in different ways and is pretty much unusable.\n\n\n*\n\n*When my screen sleeps and I awake it, nearly every time some windows are broken: they jump to top left corner, become very small (something like quarter of screen) and are unresizable and unmovable. Every time I try to move them they jump again to their beloved place in the corner and refuse to go from there. I need to quit from broken application and start it again. Also changing screen resolution back and forth helps.\n\n*Sometimes after awakening the screen I see the same black screen as in Mavericks installation and need to reboot Mac.\n\n*Sharing my folder by SMB to my Android devices stopped working (ok, this should be because of SMB update in Mavericks, so it's more of a feature than a bug)\n\n\nI believe this is the most frustrating OS experience which I had for a long long time. Including different versions of Windows, different Linux distros and even Android MiniPC.\nSo the question is -- is there any way I can reinstall Mavericks update without losing (and backing up) all my data and applications? I know there is always an option to format HDD and make clean install, but I would prefer a less radical way if it is possible.\n\nA: Ok, answer for the question was pretty much obvious -- you just go to the AppStore and hit 'Download' on Mavericks once again. It then asks  if you really want to reapply the once downloaded update. Just accept it and update will be reinstalled.\nIf you want to reuse once downloaded update file you could use advice from this question.\nBut the main problem (with jumping windows) wasn't resolved. To resolve it I used advice from this thread on apple.com. I've rebooted to safe mode and then rebooted once again to normal mode. After that the issue was gone. At least till now. Hope this helps to someone.\n", "Q: How do I use AFP with Back To My Mac? When my Macbook and home Mac were running Mountain Lion, I used Back To My Mac to get to my home system and it showed me all of my drives if I logged in with my normal account credentials.  Since I've upgraded to Mavericks, it appears to be defaulting to Samba instead of AFP because I only see the single read-only SMB share I have set up, and I can't log in with my normal account user/pass.  When I'm at home, if I manually go to afp://ip.address/ it works fine.  Obviously that is not an option with Back To My Mac.  Does anybody know how I can get the afp-over-wan behavior back?  It was really handy!\n\nA: You can find your Back To My Mac hostname by doing this:\n% dns-sd -E\nLooking for recommended registration domains:\nDATE: ---Fri 15 Nov 2013---\n12:00:39.211  ...STARTING...\nTimestamp     Recommended Registration domain\n12:00:39.212  Added     (More)               local\n12:00:39.212  Added                          icloud.com\n                                             - > btmm\n                                             - - > members\n                                             - - - > 1234567\n\nUsing that you can derive the hostname as computer_name.1234567.members.btmm.icloud.com. Now use Finder's \"Connect To Server...\" command and enter afp://computer_name.1234567..members.btmm.icloud.com in the dialog box. It works! If your computer name has a space in it, replace it with a hyphen. The hostname should be all lower-case, so if your computer name is \"My Mac\" use my-mac.1234567.members.btmm.icloud.com.\n(If your mac is running ssh, you can ssh to it as well, which opens a whole world of secure-tunnelling possibility!)\n", "Q: iTunes keeps starting automatically With 10.9 iTunes keeps starting automatically after few minutes and I don’t know why.

looks to me like some process is using launchd as user 501 to open iTunesHelper. The PID in brackets is the culprit. What's process 149?\nlaunchctl list will tell you what's loading via launchd. Check the list; if you see any plugins or helpers you know you removed, kill them with launchctl remove name.of.process\nTwo other things to try: You keep getting error messages about Mux IDs not existing. Kill all the items in the Mux ID list by deleting /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.usbmuxd.plist and reboot.\nIf that doesn't help, trash iTunes and your iTunes plists, then download and install iTunes 11 fresh from Apple.\n\nA: I've had problems with 3rd-party iTunes extensions not keeping up with iTunes updates and causing all kind of weird behavior.  In order to figure out if a plugin or extension might be involved, try starting iTunes up in safe mode:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ts3430\nIf the odd behavior goes away, then it's just a matter of figuring out which extension is the culprit.\n\nA: I do know that an infrared remote can start iTunes if the \"play\" button is pushed.  Have you looked into this possibility?  \nTo disable all infrared remotes, go to System Preferences -> Security and Privacy and click the \"Advanced\" button at the bottom of the window.  Then check the box labeled \"Disable remote control infrared receiver\".\nTo ensure only a specific remote that you trust and control is used with your computer, use the \"Pair...\" button in the same sheet, to pair your computer with a remote.\nIF... you wanted to temporarily test this, without disabling anything, you could place a piece of electrical tape over the IR receiver on the front of your computer.  You know... just to make sure that nobody in the office is jacking with you. \nBill\n\nA: I found the solution. It was one of third party Launchbar 5 Extensions. An Update von Launchbar 6 with the new extension fixed the problem.\n\nA: As well as turning off the infra red receiver I'd also plug in a pair of headphones which should cut down the possibility that it is something in the headphone jack. As I'm a total cynic I'd also replace your keyboard for the day.\nSee how those go.\n\nA: I have had the same problem. This appeared to be an issue with the Last.fm scrobbler program for me. Force-quitting (via the apple menu) first Last.fm and then iTunes fixed iTunes rising from the dead again.\n\nA: I may have resolved a similar problem on a MacBook Air.\nNothing indicated here worked. \n\n\n*\n\n*Nothing was plugged into any port before or during experiencing\nthisproblem. \n\n*I killed processes.\n\n*I launchctl removed iTunes and it's helper. \n\n*I removed the only Plug-In: Quartz  \n\n*I removed .plist files\n\n*I rebooted. Repeatedly.\n\n\nRather than go insane, I expanded the iTunes package and trashed the two .apps.\nBack in the console I noticed this message:\n2/28/14 6:17:45.928 PM rcd[249]: spawn_via_launchd() failed, errno=22 label=com.apple.iTunes.25552 path=/Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes flags=1\n\nThis indicates that the remote control daemon is being triggered by a remote somewhere.\nBUT MY MACBOOK AIR DOES NOT HAVE AN IR PORT!\nSo this is a bug or malware or a virus of some sort in my case.\nThis is how I stopped the problem, I used the instructions of JeremyCrabTree to disable rcd:\n\nThe culprit here is the Remote Control Daemon, it lives in\n/System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app\nTo simply disable it, open a terminal window and type\nsudo chmod a-x /System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app/Contents/MacOS/rcd\n  killall -9 rcd\nTo re-enable it,\nsudo chmod a+x /System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app/Contents/MacOS/rcd\nThen log out and back in. (I couldn't get iTunes to respond again\n  without logging out and back in)\nyou will now be able to use your media keys with any app you want. You\n  won't be able to use them with iTunes, however. (odd, huh?) The\n  problem appears, to me, to be that rcd uses AppleScript to communicate\n  with the various Apple apps it controls (Quicktime Player, Quicktime\n  PlayerX, DVDPlayer, Aperture, iPhoto, iTunes, and Keynote) (warning\n  technical stuff to follow) If you view the strings contained in the\n  executable you can see it explicitly launching iTunes\nstrings /System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app/Contents/MacOS/rcd\nYou will find the following, if you look for it,\ntell application id \"com.apple.iTunes\" to launch\nwhich is not present in the 10.5 version of rcd.app (yes, I checked)\nJust for giggles and grins I opened the executable\n  (/System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app/Contents/MacOS/rcd) in a hex\n  editor and munged the launch command above. I logged out, then logged\n  back in. I can now use my media keys without autolaunching iTunes AND\n  I can still use them with iTunes when it is open.\nIn summary, someone at Apple deliberately altered the Remote Control\n  Daemon to launch iTunes when using the play/pause button. It would be\n  trivially easy for them to fix, either by disabling it or making it a\n  configurable option.\n\nThen I untrashed my two apps and went about my business.\nI still don't know what caused it. \n\nA: I had the same thing happen to me.  iTunes was automatically launching.  I finally figured out it was because of my bluetooth stereo speakers.  Every time I connected to my external bluetooth speakers, by either turning my bluetooth speakers on or turning my MacBook bluetooth on using the Menu bar icon control, iTunes launches. \nSo, at least now I know why iTunes is launching automatically.  It is because somehow iTunes is 'configured' to automatically launch when a bluetooth speaker of some sort becomes connected to my MacBook.\nWhat I don't know is how to disable that behavior.\nIt seems kind of intrusive and disruptive that iTunes would 'assume' that every time I connect a bluetooth speaker I'm going to want to play music using iTunes.  I have not used iTunes for music in several years.  Maybe if iTunes/Apple had a decent streaming music service that was 1/2 as good as Spotify, I would, but I still would not want iTunes to ASSUME that I'm going to use it and launch itself. \nI'll start iTunes when I WANT to use iTunes.  It is annoying that it is launching itself.  Apple thinks it knows better than I do when I want to use iTunes.  I THINK NOT.\nIf anyone figures this out, I would be very interested in knowing how to DISABLE iTunes from automatically launching based on when bluetooth devices are connected.\nI hope this helps someone.\n\nA: Mine was relaunching immediately, so I had to quit iTunes while holding down command-option and held them down 'til it's inevitable relaunch. The dialog for iTunes safe mode came up, and iTunes launched. I quit iTunes. It didn't restart. I opened it again (not in safe mode) and quit and it doesn't relaunch anymore. Evidently, launching in safe mode forced some process to quit (maybe a visualizer?) that was causing the relaunch. Hope this helps someone.\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nIn my case removing the earphone (it's a mobile earphone) solved the issue.\nIt seems when I plugin the earphone while playing some media files with either iTunes or VLC or anything for that matter the iTunes doesn't start automatically. But I think the point is to insert the plug in the jack only after when you have started playing (player doesn't matter).\nIf you insert the earphone before switching on the MBP or insert it just after logging in then the iTunes could pop up.\nHope this helps someone.\n\nA: I had the same problem. It turned out to be a Dashboard Widget. Try going to the Dashboard and remove any iTunes related widgets.\n\nA: I tried almost everything. It's probably hardware issue. The only thing that works for me is... log out user from iTunes when playing music from web.\n\nA: My iTunes was opening every time I'd make a Skype call to a telephone. Not only would it open, but it would cut off the outgoing sound so that the person I was calling couldn't hear me. I have a MacBook Pro. I tried a lot of things to get it to stop, including rebooting, to no avail. Finally I went to Finder>Applications and ctrl-clicked on the iTunes icon. Lo and behold, there were two Skype files in the Contents folder. I removed them and pasted them into the Skype Contents folder. Problem solved. \n\nA: When i have my headphone plug into my iMac, iTunes automatically start. In my situation, my iMac headphone plug slot is somehow broken. So my iTunes start randomly. I solved this issue simply by removing my headphone from my computer.\n\nA: I think I found the answer: I have two speaker jacks in the back of my iMac.  One labeled for 'Headphones' and the other with a 'Pair of speakers' symbol.  I accidentally plugged my external speakers into the headphones jack.  When I switched to the other jack, the problem of automatic and repeated starting of iTunes stopped.\n\nA: For me, it was because I had a Pimmsleur language CD in the CD player. So... it kept seeing a CD and turning iTunes on, playing whatever my last playlist was (weird). This happened randomly, it seemed to me, but especially if I was scrolling or start/stopping a Youtube video with my touchpad. \nI like being able to leave a CD in, so, I went to my computer Settings, opened CD/DVD, and switched what to do with a CD in the slot from \"Open iTunes\" to \"Ignore.\" \nIf I want the CD to open iTunes, I'll click on it and tell it to. Or just open iTunes. \nSo far, no more problems. \n\nA: It appears that iTunes is set as one of your login items.\nGo to system preferences>Users and select your account.\nTowards the top of the window you will see a button labeled as \"login items.\" Check iTunes(and any other unnecessary apps) and click the minus symbol to remove them from the list of apps that will automatically start.\nIf that doesn't help, you can try manually killing all iTunes-related tasks.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I just realized that, having headphones with a mike and a mute button, my elbow was accidentally pushing it. Stupid, for sure :-)\n\nA: UnCheck \"Check for new software updates automatically\" under \"Preferences/Advanced\"\n\nA: https://blog.dave.io/2013/07/fix-for-itunes-starting-up-and-playing-music-by-itself-or-help-my-laptop-is-possessed/\nThis solved it here. I've just unplugged my headphone from the laptop. Never happened after it.\nI hope that helps.\nCheers.\n\nA: On Yosemite- but this appears to not be release-dependent.  It is a \"feature\" not a bug.\nI am experiencing this with a particular subprocess from a CNN webpage page in Firefox.  Never seen it before, but I thought it might be a server push request... sure enough, I close the page, and it stops, visit the url and it does it again.  I then disabled the Quicktime Firefox addon and reloaded the same url.  This prevented it trying to talk to iTunes.  I didn't see any code up-front in the HTML, so it was in some javascript includes it was using.  I'm not interested enough to dig around in the .js files to find it (it's bedtime).\n\nA: I had the same problem with Yosemite - in the end, it was quite simple. \nGo to System Preferences > System > Users & Groups > [Your user ID] > Login Items. \nThe programs that automatically start on Login are listed. \nIf 'iTunes helper' is ticked, untick it.\n", "Q: Trying to securely erase hard drive, but Security Options not available (Mavericks) Recently got a new Macbook Pro 13″ and I'm preparing my old Macbook Air for sale. I'm following steps in the Apple Support article on this topic (as well as other similar articles I've found).\nI'm currently at the stage of Erasing the startup disk. I've booted my machine with ⌘R and am running Disk Utility. Initially I was able to set Security Options to Most Secure (7 pass zeros), but after I clicked Erase there was some error and it said it could not be completed.\nNow Security Options is grayed out (unavailable), however Erase is still available.\nThe error occurred after only seconds, so I'm assuming it did not actually complete a 7 pass erase and rewrite before stopping. Guessing that means my data is still there and relatively accessible.\nIs there anyway to re-access the Security Options and get this thing to securely wipe from this point?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to re-enable secure erase. All you need to do is to format the partition once again. Just make sure you select \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\", with any password that you will remember (just in case). Once formatted, the \"Security Options\" button will be available again, and you can securely wipe out the partition!\n\nA: Interesting - so apparently, according to Apple Security Options is grayed out on SSD's because erasing an SSD normally is secure enough:\n\nNote: With OS X Lion and an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD. For more security, consider turning on FileVault 2 encryption when you start using the SSD drive.\n\nI'm actually on Mavericks, but I'm assuming this article merely hasn't been updated to reflect Mavericks yet.\n\n\n*\n\n*found via https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/90942/1261\n", "Q: How do you add the resolution icon to the top menu bar on the Macbook Pro (retina) I just got a MacBook pro retina to replace my old Macbook Pro.\nI no longer see the screen resolution icon at the top icon bar, (where the Wifi, audio, Backup, etc Icons reside)\nDo you know how to add that?\n\nA: There is no method built-in to Mavericks (the OS you are likely using on a new Retina MacBook Pro). However, there are 3rd party utilities to add this functionality.\nTry QuickRes. You may want the paid version rather than the free in order to select all the resolutions your machine offers...\n", "Q: Time Capsule Connection Failed after update to Mavericks After I updating OS X to Mavericks, Time Machine backup stopped to work on Time Capsule. \n\n\n*\n\n*I am connected on internet through Time Capsule without problems\n\n*AirPort Utility indicators are green with no errors (as well as Time Capsule LED)\n\n*Time Capsule name is displayed in Shared in Finder\n\n*I didn't do any changes except for update to Mavericks\n\n\nBut Time Capsule connection fails:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Connection Failed\" is displayed if I select TimeCapsule name in Finder\n\n*If I click \"Connect as…\", error dialog says: \"There was a problem connecting to the server …\"\n\n*If I click \"Backup now\" on Time Machine, it says: \"Backup Failed: The backup disk … is not available.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: In my case a serie of rabid and chaotic experiments with restarts and erasing a plist fixed the issue. Steps I did were: \n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled TM Backup\n\n*Removed TimeCapsule from TM Backup Disk (this might not be necessary, you will not be able to add it again until it will start to work)\n\n*Saving a screenshot of Exluded paths in TM Options (just for the case)\n\n*Renamed /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist to *.bac\n\n*Restarted Mac\n\n*Restarted TimeMachine\n\n*Removed /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist and renamed the old plist back\n\n*Restarted Mac again\n\n*Added a TimeCapsule back to TimeMachine Backup Disks\n\n\nHopefully it started to work. I don't know which of the steps were necessary and which just desperate. \n\nA: There is an epidemic hard drive failure problem associated with Mavericks.  Some drives (including my own Time Capsule) have been permanently damaged.  If that happens to your TC, you will get a constant amber light and the wifi will continue to work until the hard drive is restarted, because the wifi needs to access info on the disk to restart - something to consider before you unplug your TC or do a soft or hard reset.  If you have any Western Digital external hard drive applications on your computer, you may want to remove them (google Western Digital and Mavericks if that's a concern).  Good luck!\n\nA: In airport utility: change routermode from off(bridge mode) to DHCP + nat.\nAfter a reconnect, it works correctly.\n", "Q: How to know which program has just played sound? At times, my computer suddenly played some annoying short sound (sounds like darrrt, seems not from the system), and it's so short that I have no idea where it comes from (and cannot capture it).\nIs there any ways to find which program/process did that? (I really want to kill it!)\nI am using OS X Mavericks.\n\nA: While it's not possible to check that directly, here are some workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using Google Chrome (or similar web-browser), look for speaker icon next to tab or window (e.g. check in Window menu).\n\n*If you're using Safari, you should see also speaker icon next to the tab which is playing.\n\n*Some apps such as SoundFlower can provide extra kernel extension for pass-through audio, so then they can check which processes are accessing sound device.\n\n*Double check Notifications in System Preferences, and either set Do Not Disturb or disable Play sound for notifications for the recent or all apps. See this post.\n\n*Check for log entries, e.g. by the following command:\nlog stream --level=debug\n\n\n*Check for any file activity by fs_usage command, e.g.\nsudo fs_usage\n\n\n*Using trial and error, pause and resume processes to find out about the process, e.g.\nps d\nkill -STOP 1234 5678 # Stop processes via PID(s).\nkill -CONT 1234 5678 # Resume selected processes.\n\n\nA: Sounds like the iMessage logged in notification.\nTry this command in terminal to verify:\nafplay \"/Applications/Messages.app/Contents/Resources/Logged In.aiff\"\n\nTo turn if off you can turn off \"Play sound effects\" in the iMessage preferences.\n\nA: SoundBunny might be able to help with this. The primary purpose of the app is to let you control various apps' sound levels, but it also usually shows you what apps have recently made sounds, which might help.\nYou can download a free demo from their website and leave it running until you hear the noise again, then switch over to SoundBunny and see what it shows.\n\nA: Thanks for all answers! The problem was solved, it was turned out to be caused by a Safari plug-in( notifier of Gmail ).\nMethod: inspiration(sorry guys I just found it out by realizing I installed a weird plugin... really hard to explain how the idea came to my mind...).\n\nA: In my case it turned out to be PowerChime, chiming over and over in the way it does when you plug in power because I was using a bad USB-C port.\nThe fs_usage suggestion made by others was key, but here's a more complete example. Building on the suggestions of others, I first opened a terminal and ran:\nsudo fs_usage\n\nThis printed too much information, so I started to winnow it down. If I suspected a program had nothing to do with it, I hit control-C, hit the up arrow and edited my command line to use grep -v to filter out that program:\nsudo fs_usage | grep -v zoom \n\nBut this added a lot of entries for grep itself, so I filtered that too:\nsudo fs_usage | grep -v zoom | grep -v grep\n\nEventually I added about six different steps to this pipeline, at which point I could see that PowerChime kept popping up. That was my clue to think about my bad USB C port problem and realize I had the power cord plugged into it.\n\nA: Here is what I did to find a pesky application playing a system file. Go to System Preferences -> Sound -> Sound Effects. Toggle through the effects and make note of the sound that your mystery application is playing. When you find it go to the terminal and type:\nsudo fs_usage | grep \"aiff\"\n\nEnter in the system password if asked.\nWait for the sound to get played again and then look at the terminal output. Look for the name of the sound file you noted in the sound effects and look all the way to the right. On the right you should see the application that played the sound file. Now simply go to that application and tell it to disable playing the sound file if possible.\n\nA: Boom 3D can do this, and a lot more.\nInstall it, enable system-wide support in the main window of the app (it requires you to install another extension), then you can click on the tray icon:\n\nJust click on the purple button near the top-right corner, and you will be shown a list of all the apps and their volume.

I want to make kind of a time schedule, for example blocking Facebook between 8am and 8pm, and let it free outside this \"window\", and do the same with different \"time-windows\" for other websites... Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: My preferred method of doing this is to use a DD-WRT router and block specific sites on a time basis. (See here.)\nAlso, Netgear offers similar functionality in conjunction with OpenDNS. (See here.)\n\nA: you can use Self-Control to create a time-schedule. Check here and here.\nYou could also use a browser extension, like WasteNoTime. Goto Settings->Time Allowed->Edit Settings. Here you are able to create a time-schedule. It appears that you use several browsers. I know WasteNoTime is available for Chrome and Safari. Probably also for Firefox but I haven't checked.\nI have not tried using different time-windows for different websites. Normally you want to block all disturbing websites at once. There are more browser extension which block websites, you would probably have to check them.

I don't use the email address that it's associated with because I can't remember the password, so I can't do the \"forgot my password\" because they'll send it to the email address that I can't remember the password for. If I take my laptop in to get it fixed, they usually say it'll wipe that computers contents out. Reading some of the answers from similar questions don't give me much hope. I am very computer illiterate and don't understand a lot of the suggestions using different software and apps and I don't know what DRM is.\nIs my library salvageable?\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you've bought a lot of music from the iTunes Store, but don't have access to the email address associated with your account there, correct? If that's the case, your best bet is to contact Apple Support - assuming you can establish yourself as the account owner, they may be able to get you back into your account.\nOnce you have access to your iTunes Store account again, you can use it to download previous purchases onto your new computer (the availability of previous purchases may vary depending on your location). Any music you had in your iTunes library that you did not purchase from the store will likely be lost, however.\n", "Q: How can I keep System Events from deactivating?

I don't want to build delays into the Applescripts because many of them are for remote control type actions (imagine if your TV required a 10 second delay every time you tried to use your remote.  That'd be annoying).\nIs there a way to keep System Events active?

The Lion purchase remains visible, but Mountain Lion becomes 'Hidden.'\nFire up App Store and go to Purchases. Now go to the Store menu and select View my Account - enter your password when asked. Go to the 2nd Section iTunes in the Cloud and click on Manage - You'll find Mountain Lion in the list.\n\nA: You might just download a torrent for Mountain Lion. OS X doesn't have any copy protection. You can create a VM from the dmg included with the installer application (Install OS X Mountain Lion.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg), so don't download any modified ISOs meant for PCs.\n", "Q: Safari - is there a way to set a preferred screen size? As the title says, I would like new windows to open in a set screen size. I believe that the default is that they open in the size of the last window. Sometimes, I want to make a window smaller for some reason, but I want new windows to open as usual. Is there a shell script/command to accomplish this? Thanks \n\nA: I use the following bookmark, which you can create as many as needed, to resize my safari window to a specific size:\njavascript:self.moveTo(0,0);self.resizeTo(1250,screen.availHeight);\n\nThis moves the window to the far left, top and then makes the width 1250 pixels and makes the hight fill to the available (limited by the dock hight, if not hidden).\nTo use, bookmark any page and then edit the address with the code above.\nEvery now and again, an update to safari will break this, and then it'll work again after a subsequent update. \n\nA: There is a great extension available for Safari called ResponsiveResize which works great for me: http://www.midwinter-dg.com/downloads_safari-extension_responsive-resize.html\n", "Q: Stop Mavericks from opening apps on the second screen? I have a MacBook Pro and connected an external display to it, so far, so great. However, Mavericks seems to insist on opening new applications on the secondary display, even if the currently active (key and main) window/app is on the main display. Incredibly frustrating because they have different screen sizes and it messes terribly with my saved window sizes. Is there any way from stopping Mavericks from doing that? I only want apps to open on the main display, or at least have them remember on which display I closed them last time.\nIn case it helps, this is my display arrangement from the system preferences:\n\n\nA: As of Mavericks, there is a distinction between active and non-active monitors. You can see which monitor is active by looking at your menubar (I presume you use the new Mavericks spaces behaviour). If you compare them on both screens, one will be faded out and one will be mostly opaque. The one which ismostly opaque is activated and new application windows will open on the screenwith the opaque menubar screen unless there are other windows of the same app on the other screen.\nSo how can you change which screen is active?\nJust press anywhere on the desktop on the screen you want the window to open. This will make the menubar of the screen almost opaque and opening the window should now open it on the screen.\nAlso note that this behaviour is independent from your Docks position. In my experience, I had to click on the desktop (between the fileS) to activate the other screen (by which I mean get it in the active state)\nUpdate\nAdmittedly that doesn't prevent Mavericks from opening windows on the other screen 8you can go to \"mission control\" in System settings and uncheck \"monitors use different spaces\" to get back to the pre Mavericks behaviour. This way it'll open on the screen last closed and/or the screen where the menubar is on. The method I described above the update is just a workaround of the Mavericks way.\n\nA: with the App open, press F3 to open Mission Control and then drag the app over to the screen on which you want it to open on in the future. It's assigned to a \"space\" on your computer - Change the space to which it's assigned.\n\nA: New windows will always open in the display with the 'menu bar', so simply move the 'default' menu bar to the Display where you prefer new windows to launch. \nLook at the screenshot above of the 'Display Preferences' dialog. Note that only one of the 'Displays' shows a menu bar. Also, note the text \"To relocate the menu bar, drag it to a different Display\".\n\nA: I'm used to connecting to conference room projectors or big-screens that vary in resolution, so as I move from room to room over the course of the day, my windows constantly have to be resized too. So I feel your pain. :-) \nIn order to avoid confusion, I want to define a couple terms for this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*The primary display is the one with the menubar in the Arrangement tab in System Preferences.\n\n*The main display is the one you want stuff on, whether or not it is the primary display.\n\n*The secondary display is the one without the menubar in the Arrangement tab in System Preferences.\n\n\nBasically, the problem is that you see an important difference between the main and primary displays; Mac OS X does not, and it's going to fight you when you try to maintain this distinction by treating the secondary display as the main display.\nUnless they specifically try to do otherwise, apps will always open on whatever the primary display is. That's definitionally one of the characteristics of the primary display. (It's a pretty low level part of the Quartz API, specifically the CGConfigureDisplayOrigin call, so this behavior is unconfigurable if the app itself doesn't let you configure it.)\nI'd suggest maybe asking about the things that are making it annoying for you (\"messes with other things\" as you put it in your comment) to not keep your main display as the primary display when you connect, because those may be configurable; this behavior is not.\nI do have a couple tricks for you that might help, though:\nMirroring and then un-mirroring displays causes all windows too large to fit on the smaller screen to be resized to fit and gets all the windows onto the primary display. It isn't the perfect solution, I know, since you want things on the secondary display, but it can be a useful workaround when combined with the next trick, especially if you know the keyboard shortcut: ⌘-F1. Press it, let the system switch to mirroring, and press it again. All your windows will be resized to the smallest display and will be on the primary display.\nAnother very useful tool for working around the issue is the BetterTouchTool, which lets you set \"Center Window on Next Monitor\" and \"Maximize Window to Next Monitor\" gestures. I assign these to four- and five-finger clicks, respectively, and then I can quickly pop a window from one monitor to the other just by mashing on the trackpad. (If you don't use a trackpad when you're connected to the big display, BTT can do gestures with other pointing devices, too.)\nThese two tricks together have made working with constantly-changing resolutions not perfect, but at least tolerable. If I want to get all my windows onto the secondary display (I'm giving a training session, say, and want the menubar to be visible to students but I want all my windows not related to the training to be on the other display), I do the mirror/unmirror trick and then four-finger-smack the trackpad a bunch of times until the windows are all popped over.\nFinally, if you like to fiddle, you could take a look at this Applescript which moves all windows to primary via a different method. Unlike the mirroring method, which moves windows to primary as a side-effect, this one does it explicitly, so you could modify it to move windows to your preferred main, secondary, display. But it isn't easy, which may give you an idea of why everything's fighting you against this usage. Here's the crucial line of this Applescript:\nset position of window x to {0, 22}\n\nSince the menubar is 22 display coordinates (what used to be \"pixels\" before Retina displays) high, and screens and windows have their origin points at the top-left, this line moves window x right below and flush-left with the menubar. In order to adapt this script so it would instead move all windows to the upper-left of the secondary display, you'd need to figure out its coordinates, and use that as the x value. In the arrangement you show in your screenshot, the \"0\" there will be replaced by a negative number, since you're to the left of the menubar. It would take some fiddling to get right, especially if you wanted the script to work regardless of the arrangement.\nThis is all kludgey, I know; but you're going to have to accept kludges if you want your main display and primary displays to be different. That's why I'd really strongly recommend you try to address what's keeping you from letting the other display be primary rather than fighting this particular battle.\n\nA: I was having the same problem. What I found is applications open on whatever ever screen the dock is on. \nI had my screens set up the same as yours, dock on the left side. I switched the dock over to the right and now they open up on the main monitor and not the secondary. \n\nA: To get OS X to always open an App on a specific display in Mavericks or newer, right click on the dock icon for the App and select \"Options\" - Assign To Desktop 1 Or 2 (Desktop 2 should be your secondary display).  I have found this doesn't always work once you drag some Apps to the other display (e.g. Safari in El Capitan).  Once there, sometimes it wants to keep opening there and at least in El Capitan, it normally opens on the primary display unless specifically told that way to open on the secondary display.  You can also use the OPTIONS -> Assign on the dock to move a program back to any display (can save time by not having to move the mouse to another display to drag it back over, particularly if you have more than two monitors.  \nI just wish there was an option to have a Dock on every display at all times.  I prefer the side-mounted docks and you can't have those migrate which is a royal pain.  I've send feedback about this to Apple but they just ignore it.  It'd be so easy to have a dock on each screen at all times like the menu bar (maybe even a different dock for each screen for setups where you use certain apps on certain screens often) and have each dock on each screen open apps on that \"active\" screen.  I wouldn't mind having a button on the window itself have a \"send to display\" either.  It's simpler than having to drag windows around, particularly if you have them arranged so they are not side-by-side (e.g. I use diagonal so I don't accidentally move my mouse to the other display and that lets me keep a Dock on my left side of my right monitor as I like the dock on the left and the icons on the right at all times, regardless of monitor positions).\n", "Q: Is it possible to use FileVault 2 on a non-primary boot partition? (Dual-boot setup) To be more specific yet still brief, I'm looking to use Filevault 2's entire partition encryption, for a partition other than my primary boot partition.\nIdeally, I want to have 2, or in the future, maybe even more than 2 bootable partitions. What I want though is to have an unencrypted partition be my primary boot partition. So that you hit the power button on the computer, it starts up to a standard login screen without you ever seeing a password prompt.\nI still want to have a protected bootable partition, however. Ideally, I'd like to be able to choose this partition under the boot manager (hold Alt/Option at startup) and have it proceed to the password prompt after choosing it. But it's important that this partition only boots when chosen, and that during a normal boot, the unencrypted partition boots.\nI'm aware it's possible to choose an unencrypted partition from the boot manager while having an encrypted primary partition with FV2. As this is popular with Bootcamp dual-boot setups. What I couldn't find any information on though, is whether or not people were able to set their Windows partition (or other unencrypted partition) to their primary boot partition. However I don't imagine this is a very common thing people want to do either.\nWhat I want is different than the usual for dual-boot situations. I want to have 2 OS X partitions. I don't see why this should matter. Any bootable OS should work fine on any partition. And I don't see why OS X would try to touch an encrypted partition it isn't told to at any point. However, if you know of any problems with this setup, please let me know.\nAnd one more note. I don't see why it would interfere, but it's also important to know that I use a firmware password. Yes, I'm aware that if my proposed setup would work, it would require me to enter two separate passwords, one to bypass the firmware lock and another to boot the partition. I'm perfectly okay with this.\nPlease and thank you for any help, advice, or possible tidbits of information you may be able to provide!\n\nA: Yes, this should work fine. I actually have essentially this config on one of my computers , the only odd thing is that my default boot (unencrypted) is OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion), and the alternate (encrypted) partition is OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). I'm not really using it in this mode (it's a test computer that just happened to wind up with this combo), but the only unusual thing I've noticed is that when you boot from the unencrypted partition, every time you log in it asks you to unlock the encrypted partition so it can be mounted. You can either enter the password of one of the FileVault-enabled accounts from the encrypted partition, or click Cancel and go about your business.\nI do not have a firmware password set on this test computer, but I wouldn't expect setting one to cause any problem. To boot from the encrypted partition, you'd have to start the computer with the Option key held down, enter the firmware password, select the alternate partition, then enter one of the FileVault-enabled account passwords. After that, it should behave normally.\n", "Q: How do I disable text antialias (font smoothing) in Terminal and globally for all apps? I'd like to disable every kind of text anti-aliasing and font smoothing globally in OS X.\nWith OS X 10.8 on a mid-2013 MacBook Air 13\", I've tried quite a few options:  the Turn off text smoothing for font sizes … and smaller, which corresponds to AppleAntiAliasingThreshold in NSGlobalDomain, doesn't seem to cause any effect — I've tried setting it to 12 through the interface, and to 24 through defaults, to no effect.\ndefaults read | fgrep Smooth returns nothing, but manually setting AppleFontSmoothing -int 0 or AppleSmoothFixedFontsSizeThreshold -int 24, for NSGlobalDomain, as per https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11660895/disable-anti-aliasing-fonts-in-xcode-4-4-in-mountain-lion, doesn't seem to cause any effect, either.\nFor example, with Terminal, if I go to preferences, in Settings, Text, Text, there's an option Antialias text, and it's ticked, and there's no way to untick it, because the whole option is greyed out.\nHow do I completely disable antialias in Terminal and globally for all apps?\n\nA: defaults write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int 0 should just disable subpixel rendering, like unchecking  \"Use LCD font smoothing when available\" from the General preference pane.

I see similar behaviour when pinging external sites though - much slower and variable.\nI have tried plugging into power (possibly power saving could cause this) and also restarting.\nI searched before posting and found no other questions, but now one of the related questions is useful - changing the interval to 200ms makes the pings fast and consistent.\nBut why would changing the ping interval to be 200ms instead of 1s change the latency?\n\nA: The ping on Mavericks is badly broken. The reason for this is Mavericks puts network card into a power save mode within milliseconds when there's no traffic that it considers vital, and apparently it doesn't consider pings to be valuable traffic, therefore the network card (or, rather, wifi card) goes to \"sleep\" immediately, and it takes time for it to do so, therefore causing completely random ping results.\nI have submitted a bug report to Apple in the early beta stages of the Mavericks, but they refused to address the issue, claiming \"will not fix\".\nSo the results you're seeing are not representative of the actual network connection.\n\nA: Try running the following command if you need low latency for something like online gaming. It continuously pings your router every 200ms to stop the new 802.11ac Broadcom chip in the 2013 Haswell Macs from ever going to sleep.\nping -i 0.2 `netstat -nr | grep -m 1 '^default' | awk '{print $2;}'`\n\nHopefully, Apple will provide a proper fix for this in the coming Mac OS 10.9.2 update. They really screwed up on this one.\n\nA: weeks trying to sort random ping results from my Mac and it was the power saver setting - found this post by accident and is spot on - turned network sleep off (System Preferences-->Energy Saver-->Wake for network access) and ping is immediately consistent, as is all intermittent network traffic.\n\nA: For those who met strange high ping compared to other OS in the same environment (Win/Linux). Nothing has changed in Monterey (12.0.1). Everything is about Network card power management. You can perform very simple test:\n\n*\n\n*Run ping to your gateway (for example local router, e.g. 192.168.1.1)\n\n*Run speedtest or any other network intensive app/website\n\nThe ping is good and the same as on Win/Linux machines during intensive network communication. As soon as the network throughput drops - ping takes off to 3/4 times.\nThis is the same thing, that @fletom @dniq suggests.

I replaced it via MacPorts, but I find that cvs co [projname] with a correct $CVSROOT and cvs -d acct@server://path-to-cvs-repository co proj_name also fails with a \"server: Connection refused\" message.\nClearly, I'm using ssh to connect and sync, and I know there are two types of keys that cvs supports and I wonder if I'm sending the wrong key type.\nMy server is a FreeBSD system on 9.2 and I may not have attempted a checkout or import since I updated from 9.1.\nBefore I dove into man pages, I was wondering if any one else has found and solved this problem?\n--EDIT December 3, 2013\nInstalling cvs via fink solved my problem. fink also installs an openssl dependency and my casual conclusion is that is the key. After testing /sw/bin/fink, I uninstalled my MacPorts cvs so there'd be only one available on my $PATH.\n\nA: It sounds like a Problem with the CVS Server config.\nYou should probably take a look at the config file.\n  CVSROOT/config \nAlso it would help you if take a look at the cvs logfile on the server maybe there is something logged why your connection has been refused.\nI use the cvs cli tool from homebrew and it works with no Problems. CVS under Mavericks still works.\n\nA: Even though the reported issue is old. I am writing the answer as I done feel moving away from macport is a solution instead changing what cvs command is using for connection is.\nI faced the same issue recently when I installed the CVS with macports. On further debugging of cvs command revealed that rsh connection is being used in macport cvs instead of required ssh, to resolve this issue without moving to fink, I just added the below lines to the ~/.bash_rc profile of my user, and opened a new terminal to load updated bash profile.

I already tried to get rid of the ACLs but somehow this doesn't worked out.\nThe folder is calles CrashPlan.app.\nHere is what the terminal says:\n    sh-3.2# ls -ahel@\n    total 0\n    drwxrwxr-x@ 3 root  admin   102B 23 Okt 22:58 .\n        com.apple.backupdelta.MoveChecked      3B \n        com.apple.s stem.Security     68B \n    drwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel   102B 30 Okt 13:21 ..\n        com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeFSEventStoreUUID      36B \n        com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeLastFSEventID     20B \n        com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeUUID      36B \n    drwxrwxr-x  2 jan   staff    68B 13 Nov  2012 CrashPlan.app\n\n    sh-3.2# cd CrashPlan.app/\n    sh-3.2# ls -ahel@\n    total 0\n    drwxrwxr-x  2 jan   staff    68B 13 Nov  2012 .\n    drwxrwxr-x@ 3 root  admin   102B 23 Okt 22:58 ..\n        com.apple.backupdelta.MoveChecked      3B \n        com.apple.s stem.Security     68B \n\nStrange thing here is, if you look from the outer folder there are no ACL for the folder. But if you look from the inside there are.\nHow can that be and how I can get rid of it?\n\nA: The CrashPlan.app does not have an ACL. The output of ls is consistent, you must have misread it.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you run ls -a in the parent directory, it tells you that . (i.e. the parent of CrashPlan.app) has extended attributes, and that CrashPlan.app has no ACL (mode string rwxrwxr-x).\n\n*When you run ls -a inside CrashPlan.app, it tells you that . (i.e. the CrashPlan.app directory) has no ACL (mode string rwxrwxr-x), and that .. (i.e. the parent directory) has extended attributes.\n\n\nThe parent directory does not have an ACL, but it has extended attributes com.apple.backupdelta.MoveChecked and com.apple.s stem.Security. This second attribute is odd: it should be com.apple.system.Security. This is a sign that your filesystem may be corrupted.\n\nA: I had what appeared to be the EXACT same problem. The issue was with the system immutable flag on CrashPlan.app in my .MobileBackups folder.\nActually, it was an old .MobileBackups folder from a Previous System folder that was created during an \"Archive and Install\" of OS X, so I knew it was nothing I needed. It was completely inactive, but I couldn't delete it no matter what I tried.\nThis is what finally did it for me:\nsudo find TopLevelFolder/ -flags +schg -exec chflags noschg {} \\;\n\nWhere TopLevelFolder is the folder containing (all of?) the offending CrashPlan.app folders. This removes the system immutable attribute which makes it possible to now delete the files.\n\nAs always, be very careful with rm -rf, but running the following command next will then remove the files.\n\nsudo rm -rf TopLevelFolder\n\nWhere, again, TopLevelFolder is the same as the one above. I hope that helps someone else.\n", "Q: backing up an OSX image to an NTFS drive? I would like to make an image of my entire OSX install, so that I may restore to it if necessary.

I'd like to be able to backup an image of my OSX to the drive.\nI cannot find any solution that simply makes a compressed image of OSX and allows you to save it somewhere; all the solutions seem to require formatting the drive (for example, Time Machine wants to create an entire partition on the drive).

If you want incremental backups and a DIY solution, choose a sparse disk image and use rsync to update the band files that you store on NTFS, just like Time Machine does to Time Capsule.\nIf you really just want a painless backup solution, you might select a professional tool set such as (in alphabetical order):\n\n\n*\n\n*Arq\n\n*Backblaze\n\n*Carbonite\n\n*CrashPlan\n\n*Mozy\nSince I listed some of the more popular incremental backup software packages (some are hosted, some you can self host), the one that seems to fit your requirement the best is the free CrashPlan software that would be self hosted and need a computer connected to the NTFS drive to host the Mac data as a backup destination.\n", "Q: My MacBook won't go to sleep anymore Since the update to Mavericks, my MacBook has stopped going to sleep when I close the lid.

When using the built in maps navigation, I'm sure I once was able to choose which mapping tool to use (Google Maps or CoPilot) but now for the life of me I can't work out how I did it. \nI'd like to find a place using the normal mapping application and then choose which navigation application to use to get me there.\nI've seen this question How to invoke navigation on Google maps using Siri?, but I would like a non voice activated solution if there is one.\n\nA: You cannot change the underlying routing service with the default maps app for driving instructions, but what you can do is choose 3rd party applications for certain routing routing options, namely cycle routes, public transport options etc that are not provided by default within the app directly (since the switch to Apple's own mapping service).\nFollowing the steps from this knowledge base article, the workflow seems to be \n\nTransit\nMaps in iOS allows you to choose your own third-party app from the App\n  Store to provide transit information. To choose a transit option, tap \n  . You can choose from the list of installed third-party transit apps,\n  or you will be directed to download one from the App Store.\n\nThis is a little misleading, as you actually need to select the Public Transport icon first, then try to route it first before it offers you a choice of what to use to route with.  At this point it will offer you a list that shows currently installed options as well as choices from the App Store:\n\nYou could also click on a dropped pin and choose Public Transport Directions underneath the directions to/from here text to get to the same screen.\nOnce you select from one of your installed apps (or go to the App Store, download one, then repeat the process when you have one installed), it should then switch to that app for routing.  Note that it will switch to the 3rd party app and route using either Public Transport or whatever option the app provides (for example Co-Rider does;t offer Public Transport, only Cycle Routes, but it's still accessed in the same way).\nBy default driving and walking directions will always be provided in app using Apples own systems. If you want 3rd party driving directions then you will need to do a crafty workaround; choose Public Transport then your 3rd party app that also supports driving instructions (for example Google Maps and Waze in my screenshot - the types of routing options available are listed against each app), then switch back to driving options once you have the 3rd party app open with the start & destination set.  To use Google Maps as your example, it will open happily showing your transit options, and a single tap in the top left icon to switch to driving gets your end result via the back door.\n", "Q: How to keep sound from muting while using dictation? Whenever I try to use the dictation feature in OSX, it mutes my sound. I want to hear the audio I'm playing in iTunes or somewhere else while I have dictation enabled. How can I do that?\n\nA: This preference was made visible in System Preferences, so you don't need to run Terminal commands any more. Go to the Accessibility preference pane, choose Dictation and disable Mute audio output while dictating.\n\n\nA: You need to set some hidden preferences to make this work (OS X 10.9 - Mavericks). Open Terminal and enter the two commands below:\ndefaults write com.apple.SpeechRecognitionCore AllowAudioDucking -bool NO\ndefaults write com.apple.speech.recognition.AppleSpeechRecognition.prefs DictationIMAllowAudioDucking -bool NO\n\nAfter doing this turn off dictation in Systems Preferences, wait a few seconds and then re-enable it. You should now be able to dictate while audio is playing. I’ve only tried this while using a headset/headphones, it’s probably not advisable without. :)\nTo restore your system to it’s virginal state, run these commands in Terminal and then restart dictation:\ndefaults delete com.apple.SpeechRecognitionCore AllowAudioDucking\ndefaults delete com.apple.speech.recognition.AppleSpeechRecognition.prefs DictationIMAllowAudioDucking\n\nFound via: https://gist.github.com/rmangino/8388849\n\nA: The program Audio Hijack Pro can handle this. \nAdd system audio on right, then press hijack 1st and mute 2nd. \n\nA: It's possible to use Voice Control's voice dictation while listening to something on YouTube. At first it wasn't working on Google Chrome but I had to restart the app and now it's working.\nThe only weird thing is this voice dictation never really stopped so there is never a click sound that says voices dictation is over. Even though I clicked it on so maybe have to restart my whole system but as it stands this is what it does and it looks OK.\nI also might mention that it disables it is the dictation button so that's kind of weird and even though I am using AirPods Pro it seems like it's not as tight of a voice dictation accuracy as the original voice dictation.\n\n", "Q: Changing text applied when duplicating file in Finder When duplicating files in the finder, OS X attaches a space followed by 'copy' to the file name.

Along with other tasks, I want to secure my laptop when the phone goes out of range (enable screensaver and password), then disable the password requirement when my phone comes back in to range.\nPrior to 10.9\nI had this working (mostly) in OS 10.8 and earlier. When my phone went out of range, I could run:\ndo shell script \"defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -int 1\"\ndo shell script \"/Users/Chris/Library/Scripts/Proximity/notifyScreensaver\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set ss to screen saver \"Soundstream\"\n    start ss\nend tell\n\nThe notifyScreensaver is a compiled C program that makes the screensaver reread the password requirement preferences (from this forum post). \nThis would enable the requirement for a password, and then immediately run the screensaver. This was the correct behavior for if my laptop was in a public environment. However, when at home, I didn't want to have to type in password everytime I walked out of the room and came back in a minute later. So adding another layer of complexity:\ndo shell script \"defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -int 1\"\ndo shell script \"/Users/Chris/Library/Scripts/Proximity/notifyScreensaver\"\n\nset ssid to getWifiSSID()\nif ssid is equal to \"RouterName\" then\n    (* if at home, only enable password requirement without triggering screensaver *)\nelse\n    (* if not at home, lock screen immediately *)\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set ss to screen saver \"Soundstream\"\n        start ss\n    end tell\nend if\n\non getWifiSSID()\n    set theWiFi to do shell script \"wifi=`/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I | awk '/ SSID/ {print substr($0, index($0, $2))}'`\necho $wifi\n\"\n    return theWiFi\nend getWifiSSID\n\nUsing this, when I'm at home I only need to type in my password if my phone is out of range AND if my computer has been idle for long enough to trigger the screensaver timeout (~20 minutes).\nWhen my phone came back in to range I would run:\ndo shell script \"defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -int 0\"\ndo shell script \"/Users/Chris/Library/Scripts/Proximity/notifyScreensaver\"\n\nIf the screensaver was already running, one would still need to type in the password to unlock the computer, but the password would not be required if the screensaver was started again later. \nThere was a bit of a glitch here: occasionally (I believe when there was no user input between the time the out-of-range script ran and the in-range script ran, and the screensaver had been enabled), the screen would just be completely black instead of showing the password prompt to unlock the computer. However in this case I could tab into the password field and type the password blindly to unlock the computer.\nIn 10.9\nThe most significant change I've encountered in 10.9 occurs when the password and screensaver are enabled and then the password is disabled, without any user input in between. When I then come back to unlock the computer, the screensaver does not require a password and immediately jumps back to the desktop. However, the keyboard is still trapped by the screensaver: I can interact with programs with the mouse, but any keystrokes just cause a warning alert sound (\"Funk\" from the standard alerts).\nA minimum example that causes this behavior is:\ndo shell script \"defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -int 1\"\ndo shell script \"/Users/Chris/Library/Scripts/Proximity/notifyScreensaver\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set ss to screen saver \"Soundstream\"\n    start ss\nend tell\n\ndelay 5\n\ndo shell script \"defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -int 0\"\ndo shell script \"/Users/Chris/Library/Scripts/Proximity/notifyScreensaver\"\n\nThe main way I've found to get out of this semi-locked state is to re-enable the password requirement and rerun the screensaver, and then enter the password manually.\nThe most ideal behavior (in my opinion) would be to lock my computer as soon as my phone goes out of range, then automatically unlock it (without a requirement for typing in a password) when my phone comes back in to range. However, since earlier OS versions I have been working under the assumption that user input is required to unlock the computer after the screensaver and password requirement have been engaged. With this constraint, the desired behavior is just to restore the functionality that was present prior to 10.9 – being able to type in the password to unlock the computer when back in range, but not require a password again until the phone goes out of range.\nAny suggestions on how to accomplish this?\n\nA: The same thing happens to me in 10.9. I also tried changing require password to wake of security preferences and putting displays to sleep instead of starting a screen saver:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set require password to wake of security preferences to true\n    --start screen saver \"Random\"\n    do shell script \"pmset displaysleepnow\"\n    delay 5\n    set require password to wake of security preferences to false\nend tell\n\nNeither of them helped though.\nYou might log out to the fast user switching screen instead of locking the screen though:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\n\n", "Q: Find symbolic links (’s names) with Spotlight (Finder) underwhelmed by the fact that OS X’s Aliases got really big with Mountain Lion (Lion?) I basically switched to using symbolic links instead.\nNow I’m just learning the hard way that Spotlight (or, Finder for that matter; since Finder’s find relies on Spotlight) doesn’t index symbolic links (or, their names). I.e., when you look for a specific string/word in the name of a symbolic link (by way of Finder’s search-field) nothing shows up. This is different from Aliases (’s names), which do show up.\nThis is very bad for me and I’m looking for a way to make Spotlight index symbolic links (some mdimporter magic?), or to be able to search for (the names of) symbolic links in some other way.\nYou see, I’m using the symbolic links mostly to link to larger files that reside on eternal hard drives in order to save space on my internal drive. But I really need to find these files (by searching their respective folders) by entering some search term that matches their name.\nI’m searching for (the names of) the linked files, not for the symbolic link-files themselves; that’s why a solution like proposed here:\nhttp://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1109635\ndoesn’t help me. If I understand correctly.\nOver the last weeks (after switching to Mountain Lion from Snow Leopard) I created lots of symbolic links that are now invisible to any search functionality.\n\nA: You can use the find command to show you the target of the symlink then have awk throw away the rest of the line.  Then wrap that in a loop that tells you what it's doing then feeds the names to mdimport:\nfor linktarget in $(find ${HOME} -type l -ls | awk -F'-> ' '{print $NF}'); do\n    echo \"importing ${linktarget}\"\n    mdimport \"${linktarget}\"; \ndone\n\nIt's probably easier to cut and paste this little script since there are some spaces that are easy to miss.  (like the one after the arrow in the awk statement).\n", "Q: Sync books from iBooks on Mac with iBooks on iPhone This task should be very easy to solve, but still, I can't do it.\nI have downloaded a epub book, dragged it to iBooks app on Mac.

No way to sync that single book with my iPhone.\nSo, my question is: what am I doing wrong? Is there any way to do that without killing virgin and summoning Devil? Because to me all this sync issues seem to be a black magic.\n\nA: In short, the iBooks application and its behavior were kind of a big surprise to everybody. Before I opened it, Mavericks seemed great.\nThe iBooks application seems positioned to deal only with purchased (DRM) books. This includes your ePubs and PDFs. It wasn't announced, but it seems to be the case. Also the iBooks application on the desktop isn't intended to be the means to sync to your iDevices. When you sync your device, the iTunes \"Books\" selections will come from the new iBooks application.\nAll of your not-purchaed ePubs and PDFs that you used to store and sync in iTunes, well now you have to use something else, like Calibre. Whether or not this continues to be the case is unknown. It's possible that the new iBooks app is an attempt to distance Apple from non purchased books.\nI spent a day putting all my non-purchased books into Calibre and it works fine. It's not seamless with the syncing, especially if you used to do it over WiFi. For the moment that capability is not available. Calibre has multiple methods for copying to devices, and you will definitely need to do a little digging in the documentation.\nSo for the moment, you have two separate methods of syncing books: iBooks and iTunes for purchased, and Calibre (or whatever) for non-purchased.\nWhen you start iBooks for the first time, your iTunes books will be transferred to a folder buried out-of-sight. Most of the ePub metadata will be in the ePub file, but not so for PDFs. If you were lucky you copied your stuff out of iTunes before using iBooks. I wasn't so lucky.\nBTW, any PDFs that are music booklets (or in my case, sheet music) can stay with the album in iTunes. However they are media type \"Music\". \n\nA: It is possible to sync notes/annotations of 3rd party EPUBs using iBooks for Mac & iBooks for iOS, but the EPUB files themselves do not sync. Weird, but true.\n(1) Keep your 3rd party EPUBs centrally in Dropbox, so it can be \"accessed\" from any Mac or iOS device. (You can also host these on a private web-page on your LAN. I use papaya app from lightheadsw.com for this.)\n(2) Open the EPUB on each Mac and iOS device, from the Dropbox folder. This creates a copy of the EPUB in each of the iBooks apps.\n(3) Last read position, highlights & notes that you make on the EPUB on any Mac or iOS device will be synced across all other devices -- provided you've signed into iBooks store using the same Apple ID on all these devices. And you've checked the sync bookmarks/notes setting in iBooks.\nPoints to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*iBooks doesn't sync data using your iCloud account, it does so using the \"store-linked\" apple ID. Think of iBooks as an extension of iTunes. It doesn't behave like Pages/Keynote/Numbers etc which use iCloud for documents sync. it behaves like iTunes Match which uses your store account for ratings/metadata sync.\n\n*The EPUB itself is not synced by iBooks - only the highlights/notes are synced. When you insert the same EPUB into iBooks for Mac and iBooks for iOS, it tries to match the EPUB against notes/annotations stored in the cloud, and if there's a match, then notes will show up on that device. Thus, it's important to take the exact same EPUB and open it on iBooks on Mac, iPhone, iPad for notes sync to work. Think of an EPUB as read-only, including the filename, and that you need to manually insert it into every copy of iBooks.\n\nA: Why bother just use the kindle app. Send to kindle allows syncing non-drm books across up to 5 devices, puts a copy in the cloud for viewing as well. It's not as nice an app, but does the trick. \n\nA: I just moved the epubs to my dropbox and opened them in iBooks on my iPhone as the books tab doesn't seem to appear in iTunes when I sync my iPhone. Its a round about way but it works. \nThe other trick that worked on my iPad, which had the books tab in iTunes while syncing, was to select \"sync all books\" and it will show all the books be they epub, purchased or non purchased, pdfs etc in iBooks on the iPad.\nThough why the same trick won't work on my iPhone is beyond me since on the macforums it seems to work for others. C'est la vie or rather C'est la Apple!!\n\nA: Note that the answers on this question are obsolete because more recently, Apple has allowed non-DRM (i.e. non-iTunes-purchased) files to be synced between different iBooks instances using iCloud Drive.\nSee my question+answer for a basic description of how to do this: PDF added to iBooks on Mac does not sync to iCloud Drive or my iPhone\n", "Q: iMessage with shared Apple ID I was recently notified that my ex boyfriend signed into iMessage on his laptop using my email address. I have since then changed my Apple ID password and was immediately asked to enter my new password into iCloud. If I changed the password, will it automatically sign out on his computer as well? And, if so, is he still able to use my email for iMessage?\n\nA: Changing the password should be sufficient. You can see which devices are currently logged in with your Apple ID by following the instructions provided in this Apple support article:\nCheck your Apple ID device list to see where you're signed in\nYou can also remove devices from your Apple ID profile by clicking the Remove button that appears in the device information box after you've clicked on one of the devices.\nAs an added step, I would highly recommend turning on two-factor authentication after you get everything squared away. You can read more about two-factor authentication and how to enable it in the following Apple support article:\nTwo-factor authentication for Apple ID\n\nA: If you change the password, he will can't login iMessages with your Apple ID.

I am not a mac power user and when ever I need to find an application or file, I open Finder and look for it. Couple of weeks ago, I saw someone using some keyboard shortcut, which opened a dialog box, where as he enters the name, the application showed the files matching the word he is searching. Is this a mac power tool or is this a different app?\nThanks\n\nA: Spotlight is a part of OS X. The default keyboard shortcut is, I think, Command-Space for the Spotlight menu entry and Option-Command-Space for the Spotlight field in a Finder window. (Clarified after Chris' answer.)\nThere is also a third party application named Quicksilver.\n\nA: The default keyboard shortcut for Spotlight is Command-Space.

I'm running 10.9.\n\nA: locate is not equivalent to Spotlight. \nHaving said that, lets look at the meat of your question:\nYou can try to force an update of the locate db using sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb which will rebuild the locates database.\nI would check the manpage for locate for additional options regarding other volumes as I believe there is a flag to stay on the current filesystem from locate but it escapes me at the moment. Locate Man Page for 10.9\nHaving looked at it the best thing I can come up with is to use a regular expression that won't visit another filesystem or to create seperate databases for each.\nAnother option is to use the find command which can be told to stay on the current filesystem -x on BSD, -xdev in linux.\n", "Q: Only Chrome can access the Internet Very curious problem - only Chrome can access the Internet, but literally everything else cannot. Confirmed this in Activity Monitor's Network tab (it shows 0 bytes sent/received for literally every process other than Chrome). Mail, Software Update, Safari, App Store, all can't connect. At first I suspected it was a botched uninstall of Little Snitch or K9 internet filter, but now I'm suspecting something deeper in the system. Cleared DNS cache and other items using Onyx. Still no luck. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Are you able to get access out using command line programs? For example, can you ping google.com or perhaps ping 74.125.226.226? Ping will communicate using the ICMP protocol. So knowing whether or not requests on ICMP can communicate out may help to solve this mystery.\nAs far as whether or not you can communicate on TCP, you should try curl google.com and/or curl 74.125.226.226. Whichever works. The google.com one should produce some short HTML code, in which you can see \"301 Moved\". The 74.125.226.226 one should produce a lot of code. This is what Google's standard search page is. If neither work, something's perhaps blocking any TCP request not made by Google Chrome. Which is really strange. If one, the other, or both work however, we may be looking at more of a blacklisting situation. Hard to tell though. If it fails though, tell me what it says when it fails. It may be a standard \"couldn't connect to host\" or it may be something more helpful.\nOne more thing you can do is check Activity Monitor for any possible processes leftover from Little Snitch or K9. Only Little Snitch can block programs, I'm guessing though because from a quick glance at K9's site, they didn't say anything about blocking programs. So you really want to look for anything that might be associated with Little Snitch.\nThat's all I can think of for now.

My iMac is connected to an iPhone's hotspot to get its internet connection.\nI have another iPhone that requires internet connection, but it can't connect to the hotspot.\nInstead, I would like the iMac to serve as another hotspot, from which the other iPhone can connect through wifi.\nTherefore, the connection would look like this:\niPhone A (wifi)-> iMac (wifi)-> iPhone B\nHow can I achieve this? I went to Internet Sharing in the iMac, but it doesn't seem to have an option to share the iMac's wifi connection to other iPhones using wifi.\n\nA: The wireless card in your iMac, which is what is responsible for handling Wifi connections, is only capable of one connection at a time, to explain it most simply. The card cannot connect to a Wifi signal (your iPhone's Hotspot feature) and broadcast a signal at the same time.\nHowever, a solution to what you wish to achieve may be possible if you can use USB Tethering as opposed to Wifi Hotspot on iPhone A. Then your wireless card on your iMac would be free to broadcast a Wifi signal for internet sharing.\nI have not used any iPhone OS version since 3.1.2, where it was not called \"hotspot\" anywhere and the settings for tethering were even in a different set of menus. However, a quick search seems to show that you can activate USB tethering by going into your Personal Hotspot on the phone (Settings > General > Cellular > Personal Hotspot) while USB and Bluetooth are turned off. Then turning on Personal Hotspot, and tapping \"USB Only\" when prompted. USB tethering is also supposedly turned on even if Wifi and/or Bluetooth are on, yet I personally prefer to not have them on, and especially to not have the phone making a hotspot if I'm only going to use USB for connectivity.\nBe advised, the iTunes Helper process is required to be running to provide the network interface for iPhone USB Tethering. This requires iTunes to be installed. If the iPhone does not initially provide you a network connection on your iMac, install if necessary and open iTunes, and it should start the iTunes Helper process and also add it to your login items.\nAt this point, your iMac should have a connection through your iPhone via USB. You can enable Wifi Internet Sharing in System Preferences and you should be good to go. Internet Sharing on most Macs, and I'm pretty certain on every modern one, produces a network in Infrastructure Mode. Which means there should be no problems connecting to it, even for devices that don't support certain other modes such as ad-hoc. So your other iPhone (B) should work fine.\n", "Q: iMac screen won't turn back on after a sleep session in Windows 8.1 I do a lot of hardware programming, and some of the chips I write applications for don't have IDEs and/or compilers that are compatible with anything other than windows, so I do use Windows quite often. I have recently decided to dedicate my personal laptop to my main operating system, Linux, and move Windows over to my other computer, iMac. The problem I have been encountering ever since I installed Windows 8.1, though, is that the screen won't turn back on after a sleep session. Has anyone else had a similar problem? How did you overcome it?\nNote: I have already set my screensaver time to none and that didn't seem to fix anything.\n\nA: I have a 2011 iMac which I have been having the same issue with since windows 8.  For me, it is an issue with when \"turn off the display after...\" is set. I have turned off this feature, and my PC just goes into sleep mode instead. It is slightly inconvenient though, as I can't run things in the background during.\n", "Q: Is there a way to simulate a numeric keypad on apple wireless keyboard in OSX? I'm tempted to get an Apple Wireless Keyboard but the lack of a number pad is a concern. I'm interested whether there is some form of software you can use where for example you hold some control keys down and you can use a set of keys like the following as a substitute numeric keypad: \n7890\nuiop\njkl;\nm ./\n\n\nA: Macworld explained the procedure for a unibody MacBook, but I imagine the procedure is similar for an Apple wireless keyboard:\n\nIn order to bring the MacBook’s number pad functions back from the dead you need do nothing more than install [Edit: software is now called Karabiner-Elements] and restart your Mac. If you’re running Snow Leopard you don’t have to remap anything or even open the Preference Pane. Just hold down Fn plus the letters you mentioned and your laptop will cheerfully produce numbers as did your old one.\n\nLink to Karabiner-Elements\nDespite the name, this app will also work happily with non-MacBooks, or even non-Apple keyboards. I haven’t used it specifically to simulate a numeric keypad on an Apple wireless keyboard, but I have used it for other things and it generally works well.\nIt’s also well-maintained: the developer has been releasing regular bug fixes and new versions for OS X releases since late 2006.\n\nA: In most cases, I would recommend that you follow alexwlchan's suggestion. However, if you're entering lots of numbers at once and would rather not have to hold down the fn key, there is another solution: creating a custom keyboard layout!\nThe free app Ukelele enables this to be done fairly painlessly. Simply place the numbers and any other keys you want to have access to, and select File > Install > Install For [Current User/All Users].\nOnce the layout is installed, add it to your input sources in  > System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources by clicking the + icon and finding your custom layout.\nYou can then have a couple options for switching between layouts. If the appropriate box at the bottom of that window is checked, you can switch with the mouse using the icon in the menu bar. Alternatively, you can set a keyboard shortcut to toggle between them by navigating to the Shortcuts tab of the same window, clicking Input Sources in the left-hand list, and double-clicking the shortcut you'd like to change.\n", "Q: How to Permanently Delete Photos from iPhone I have so many photos on the iPhone. And my iPhone's internal space is not enough now.\n\nA: Presuming you're not looking to securely delete these photos, just recover space that they're consuming, as suggested by your original question, let's just start simply...\nAside from the suggestions by superriku11, including using iPhoto to transfer them off with the delete option and Image Capture, you do realize that you can, in Photos in your Camera Roll select Edit and then proceed to select a series of photos and then Delete them. This is time consuming for lots of photos, but does allow you directly on the iPhone to get rid of images you may no longer want to keep. This is the obvious solution to getting rid of multiple images at once but some people forget about it. Realize that if you delete a photo in the Camera Roll that's in an Album it goes away there too. You can delete albums using the Edit button, but this keeps images in the Camera Roll. \nIf you want to get rid of all the photos in your Camera Roll all at once, go into Settings > General > Usage under Storage click Photos & Camera and the right swipe Camera Roll to bring up a Delete button. Give it some time and it will delete all your photos in the Camera Roll. Likewise you could delete all the photos in your Photo Library and/or Photo Stream the same way. \n\nA: Must they be permanently (securely) deleted? If not, simply deleting them regularly should suffice. There's a delete option while viewing the picture. That's pretty slow though, so here's some faster options:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's an option in iPhoto (if you use that) to delete photos after transferring. \n\n*If you're able to access the iPhone photos through another method that allows you to delete photos (such as the fact that an iPhone presents a USB interface on other systems than OS X) you can delete them much more quickly and easily too.\n\n*I haven't used it in a while, but I think Image Capture on OS X may provide a way to delete pictures from the camera (your iPhone) as well. If so, it may provide an option to bulk delete.\nIf the photos must indeed be securely deleted, the question is how secure. Tests on Solid State Drives (SSDs) have shown that even with standard deletion, the data is almost entirely irrecoverable afterwards. The NAND storage that iPhones use is likely similar. \nIf you absolutely need a secure delete though, it may be possible through running a secure delete tool such as srm (OS X) or shred (nearly the same thing, for Linux systems) on the photos if you can connect to the iPhone via USB interface. To be more sure, you should run a secure erase command from the phone itself, which would probably require it to be jailbroken and you to SSH into the phone or use a terminal program.\n\nA: please only do this, if you know what you are doing!\nUnder Linux:\nPlug your iPhone via USB.\nOpen your file explorer (I used Nautilus) and navigate to your iPhone -> DCIM.\nRight-click the folder 100APPLE -> \"open terminal\".\nIn the Shell, delete photos using the rm command.\n", "Q: Connect to FTP server in Finder not working I can get to my FTP server just fine from the command line but I cannot get to it from Finder.

No traffic whatsoever was going through. On a whim, I tried a blank password and saw traffic going through! After changing my password on the FTP server I was successfully able to connect with Finder. It apparently had something to do with my password??? I played around to see what the exact problem was with my password and, at the risk of revealing too much information about my security credentials, found that any password with an '@' symbol in it caused Finder to immediately display that error and not even try to send any traffic to the FTP server.\n\nA: This seems to also impact cPanel FTP user accounts which mandate the addition of the domain name after the username (e.g. username@domain.com).

Can I download it free on my MacBook? \nThanks.\n\nA: You can download it, for the purposes of backup/syncing etc with iOS devices via iTunes, but it is not an OS X application so it will not run.  Some companies release software for both platforms, often with the same name/version number/price point, but they are separate applications, and when you buy you are purchasing on a platform specific basis, so even if you own iA Writer (or Byword, or any other cross platform app) you only own it on the platform for which it was purchased.\n\nA: Some software companies do have such a policy, but Apple certainly does not require it.

Thanx...\n\nA: Microsoft Word for Mac 2019 now has built-in shortcuts for this:\n⌘ Command+] increases the font size by one step\n⌘ Command+[ decreases the font size by one step\n\nA: OK, I've found the answer. You can assign keyboard shortcuts to any Word 2011 command. Go to Tools, then Customize Keyboard. Choose Format category. Find GrowFont and assign a keyboard shortcut to it. Find ShrinkFont and assign a keyboard shortcut to it.\nI assigned CMD+SHIFT+Arrow keys (up to grow, down to shrink).\nThey make no conflicts to me, and they are Word only.\nThese two single keyboard shortcuts make worlds of difference when editing docs.\n\nA: Ctrl+[ increases the font size by one point.\nCtrl+] decreases the font size by one point.\n\nA: *\n\n*Increase the font size: ⌘-+\n\n*Decrease the font size: ⌘--\n\nA: Quite often this type of command, using keys with punctuation rather than just letters, is language-dependant.\nAlso, quite often, the physical key is in the same place as it would be in English, making the actual keystroke generated different.\nHere are common examples of key-stroke types where the generated character changes, but the position remains the same.\n\nThese are common pairing positions for many key command 'sets'. It's recommended if you are using a non-English language you try these positions on your own keyboard, ignoring the actual characters printed on them.\nThe two on the left are different in ANSI [US] & ISO [UK English & variants for rest of the world]\n\nA: Increase the font size : COMMAND + SHIFT + >\nDecrease the font size : COMMAND + SHIFT + < \n", "Q: How to make a Mac mini and MacBook Pro work together (one keyboard for two Macs)?

I just bought MacBook Pro 13\" with Retina Display. I have noticed that bitmap images (which are not vector graphics) are pixelated and fuzzy on several websites. However, videos seem to be fine. Why is that so? Can anyone explain why only bitmap images are affected by this (low resolution) but not videos?\nFor example, when I open YouTube, the logo of YouTube on left corner appears fuzzy, but video is played fine and correct. What method is used in videos then?\nDoes anyone know?\n\nA: The videos remain sharp on the retina display because they're scaled down to half their original size (a 720p video is 1280x720, but displayed at 640x360 on YouTube). \nImages on webpages are usually blurry because in order to display at the same physical size as on a non-retina display, they have to be scaled up 2x (unless the website provides 2x source images, like Apple.com does).\n", "Q: place text over image without imagemagick I have a png image file which I would like to overlay text onto, via the command line (for use in a Makefile). The text to be overlaid is dynamic, decided at the time the image is modified.\nI am aware that I can install ImageMagick to do this, but I would prefer to use a method that only requires standard OS X along with Xcode's developer tools.\nIs there a command (or sequence of commands, including AppleScript if necessary) that I can use to make this happen? (If there is, an example would be excellent.)\n\nA: You could try using a scripting language that comes installed with OS X, such as  PHP or Ruby, and write a command line script using that.\nHere's an example using PHP:\n<?php\n\n/*\nUsage\nphp addtext.php input.png \"The text\"\n*/\n\n//  The source image (taken from the command line argument)\n$image = imagecreatefrompng($argv[1]);\n\n//  The text (taken from the command line argument)\n$text = $argv[2];\n\n//  Red colour\n$colour = imagecolorallocate($image, 255, 0, 0);\n\n//  Change font as desired\n$font = '/Library/Fonts/Impact.ttf';\n\n//  Add the text\nimagettftext($image, 20, 0, 20, 30, $colour, $font, $text);\n\n//  Save the image\nimagepng($image, 'out-image.png');\n\n//  Free up memory\nimagedestroy($image);\n\n?>\n\nSave this script to a file called something like addtext.php and then run it like this…\nphp addtext.php image.png \"Some text to add\"\n\nThis example script should output an image called out-image.png with the text added, using the Impact True Type font that's installed with OS X, in the same directory as the PHP script.\nYou may want to read up on PHP's imagettftext function to play around with the text rendering.\nSomething similar could be done in Ruby, Python, etc. but I'm not sure of the \"in-built\" image manipulation / creation commands / libraries that come installed with OS X for those scripting languages.\nHope this is a good starting point.\n\nA: I was trying to do what you requested using Applescript and Preview.app but Preview is not Applescriptable.\nThis is an ugly hack but it may suit your purpose, using Automator set up the following workflow:\n\nIf you save it as a workflow you can run it from the command line with the automator command like this:\nfor i in `ls {location of files to be processed}`;do `automator -i $i {location of .workflow}`;done\n\n", "Q: While moving files in Finder, how to prevent the files from hiding the target folder? When you want to move a group of files in Finder in column mode, you first select the group, then drag the group to a target folder. The problem is that the files hide the target folder, and in column mode, you have to put the mouse cursor over the file name. Sometimes, the files fade a little, get out of the way, and a red label with the total number of files is displayed. I don't know when this happens, but this solves the problem, because nothing is displayed near the cursor. Also, sometimes the files are not moved away from the cursor, but there is still a red label displaying the number of files.\nIs there a way to force the dragged files to be always displayed in a compact, faded way, with the red label indicating the number of elements being moved ? If it is not possible, when does this happen exactly ?\n\nA: After selecting the group of files. Position your cursor (not the item in column) inside the column area where your target folder is located. Wait for a few seconds for the list of selected items to fade away right to the mouse cursor.\nInstead of using column view, I recommend DragonDrop to make moving files between folders easier.\n", "Q: Applescript dictionary for Preview Is there an Applescript dictionary for Preview.app?  I am unable to find it under Mac OS X 10.7.5, and Applescript 2.2.1.\nI did a rudimentary search in google and duckduck but came up empty.\nI've also ran https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/40084/10733 however when I run it for Preview I am getting the following error:\ntell application \"Preview\"\n    get every property\n        --> error number -1708\nResult:\nerror \"Preview got an error: Can’t get every property.\" number -1728 from every property\n\nWhere can I find the scriptable objects for Preview?\n\nI have found several answers saying it is not scriptable, however I have not changed the NSAppleScriptEnabled preference and the following runs:\ntell application \"Preview\"\n    set save_location to ¬\n        (choose file with prompt \"Choose the png to be modified\")\n    activate\n    open save_location\n\nend tell\n\nI've posted a separate question about why this runs on stackexchange.\nMy original question stands.  Where/How can I find the scriptable objects?\n\nA: As markhunte said, NSAppleScriptEnabled is set to true by default in Preview's Info.plist in 10.9. So Preview has a basic AppleScript dictionary, and tell application \"Preview\" to properties works by default. \nIn 10.8 or earlier versions of OS X you can set NSAppleScriptEnabled to true manually:\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview NSAppleScriptEnabled -bool true\n\nThe open and activate commands also work with applications that don't have an AppleScript dictionary.\n\nA: Preview.app is NOT made Scriptable by apple and as far as I am aware never has been.\n\nUpdate:\nIt does appear apple have enabled scriptability in Preview.app\nAnd I only say this is the case as I have a new install on a Macbook Pro that I know I have never change the Previews scriptability.\nNever the less there is still no Preview.app suite.\n\nI suspect (and I may have the facts wrong) this was because Preview.app was original only for previewing files and not an editor.\nAlthough there are now more options to actually edit some file types in Preview apple have NOT made it scriptable.\nThis is not to say it cannot be made scriptable. AFAIK all cocoa app can be made scriptable if the developer creates a Scripting Definition File for it. To do this you would need to know the methods in the code of the application to define ( putting it simply)\nYou could even write the sdef file yourself if you know the method information.\nYou can make Preview.app scriptable by changing it's NSAppleScriptEnabled  preference. But that is pretty much pointless as this would only list some of the standard suits. But Preview.app would know nothing about it's self. \n\nA: I would say that considering Automator contains scripted actions which are based in Applescript there is indeed a way to script Preview, just depends what you're trying to do.  \nSome perusing in the Automator actions section for Preview may yield good results.  There are a number of tools I use such as rotation and scaling operations for batch processing which should be accessible to Applescript.  Perhaps also Automator might prove a good method to get around not having direct Applescript access since you can embed Applescript in an Automator workflow.\nGood hunting!\n", "Q: Recovering lost photos on iPhone 5s after restoring from iTunes backup I used to have an iPhone 4s and all the data from there is synced in my iTunes in my Mac. I just got an iPhone 5s yesterday and decided then to plug it to my iTunes. There was a welcome message and 2 options: whether to set up as new iPhone or set up as old iPhone (4s contents).\nSo to be able to make everything fast, I chose the latter, but then all the new photos in my iPhone 5s were deleted and were replaced with all the contents from my 4s. Is there any way I could retrieve it?\n\nA: In my opinion, it is something that's really hard to do (or that might even be impossible), that's why, sadly, I think that you are not likely to get your data back.  \nMost of the time, when you erase some data on a storing device, actually, you don't really erase it but just hide it and give to the devices using it the authorization of writing on it, that's why, in some cases, you can get your data back.\nUnfortunately, in your case, that's something much more complex for several reasons.\nThe first one is that getting back the data in the way I mentioned above needs to have an access to the storage at a pretty low level. Apple putted some restrictions on the iOS devices and for this reason I don't see any way to gain such a low level access without doing something dangerous and not allowed by Apple such as jaillbreaking your device (and even with this I'm not even sure you could gain this access).\nThe second one is that since you transferred some content from your iPhone 4s to your iPhone 5s, it might be possible that the photos have been replaced by some new content (so some or even all of your photos might be missing/corrupted).\nThe last one — which might be the biggest one — is that the storage is managed in a pretty special way in iOS for some security reasons and although I don't know what happens exactly when you restore you device, it might be possible that iOS protects the previous content by removing some keys that were encrypting your data, making it nearly (not to say completely) impossible to get it back.\n", "Q: Battery diagnostic tool at Apple Genius Bars I have a one-year old iPhone 5 and it's battery performance has dramatically decreased over the last few months. As I could use my iPhone for over 24 hours a year ago, the lifespan has halved by now.  \nI'm not interested in the reason why or answers like \"it's normal\", but in the following. A friend of mine told me Apple has a diagnostic tool at it's Genius bars to check the health of the battery. Is this a rumor or is the tool real? And if so, can it be bought by  consumers (I don't thinks so, but you never know :))\n\nA: You can get the battery information that the Apple Genius gets by installing iBackupBot.\n\n*\n\n*Open iBackupBot\n\n\n*Plugin your iOS device\n\n\n*Select your device under Devices on the left \n\n\n*Select More Information\n\n\n*See Battery details - your battery is in good health if FullChargeCapacity (health of your battery) is near DesignCapacity\n\n\nA: You can get access to the diagnostic data that the iOS Diagnostics tool sends by following these instructions: http://www.lyonanderson.org/blog/2014/02/06/ios-power-diagnostics/\nThere's a lot of data to through, but you may find something useful.\n\nA: Users running jaibroken devices can find this information using an app from Cydia called BatteryLife.\n\n\nA: It is real.\nOne of the Genius perform the diagnosis right in front of me. If memory serves, it goes like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*With your iPhone, or whichever iDevice, connected to the Apple Store's wifi, \"Apple Store\", open Safari, and connect to URL \"diagnosis.apple.com\" (or diagnostics)\n\n*A page will show up, with a text entry bar for the Genius to enter a verification code.\n\n*The genius will pull up a page from his \"Genius\" iPod touch, (the one with bar code scanner), and possibly clicked a certain icon, which leads him to the verification code. I assume that the verification code is changing over time.\n\n*After entering the code into your device, there goes the diagnosis page.\n\n\nIn the brief moment he was looking at my iPhone, I was able to see the maximum capacity (by design) and the capacity left, which is 98% in my case. By this figure he will determine whether your iPhone's battery needs a replacement. If not, he will suggest that you restore the iPhone and the battery issue (if any) will likely go away.\nI asked the Genius whether that's a secret page, he just calmly answered that it's just a tool for them to do the diagnosis.\nSo no, you cannot purchase it, as it is simply an internal webpage which requires Genius verification.\n\nAs a side note, informed by the same Genius, the easiest way to tell whether your battery/system has problem with battery life is to go to Settings - General - Usage in your device.\nLook at the \"Time Since Last Full Charge\" section, it tells you how long the device has been used and how long it has been on standby. If the two figure are very close, e.g. 2 hours for usage and 2 hours 10 minutes for standby. But you clearly remember that you haven't been \"using\" the device for 2 hours, but only let in stay in sleep mode. This means that something running in the background is draining your power, and your device is never sleeping.\nIn this case, the Genius will suggest that you restore the iPhone (and restore from iCloud or iTunes if you wish) and the problem will most likely go away.\n==============\nUpdate\nAfter visiting the Genius bar again, I saw a genius helping a customer on similar issue and I took a picture.\n\nInstead of connecting to some normal URL in safari, a link in the format of \"diags://#####\" would be generated and visited by the device in question.\n\nA: https://getsupport.apple.com/Issues.action\nYou can run the diagnostics tool there.

I'd like to give the Mail app a real try, and see what it'd be like moving off of gmail. I have a small company (2 people) and I use its domain name to receive and send all my email. Currently, I use google apps to handle all the company's email (and calendars too, etc.)\niCloud seems like it might be an option, except that the web client won't support a domain name.\n\nA: My short answer is any mail provider that supports IMAP except for Google or Apple is your solution.\n\nApple's mail app works best with standard IMAP services, so iCloud is out since you can't bring any email except @icloud.com / @me.com / @mac.com to that service.\nGmail is out due to the non-standard breakage that many are experiencing due to Apple/Google's combined inability to play well together.\nSo, you are left with pretty much any other implementation of IMAP mail that exists as a good technical option for you. I've had good luck with http://gandi.net IMAP email for years and have heard nothing but raves from people that use http://fastmail.fm but you could pretty much pick any company that meets your desire for price, support and features and find that IMAP is really IMAP on Apple's Mail.app for iOS and Mac and the only pain point is between gmail's IMAP/Exchange history assuming that you don't ever want to go back to larger pain that was POP3 access for mail.\n", "Q: afconvert: Difference between AAC formats: 'aac ' 'aace' 'aacf' 'aach' 'aacl' 'aacp' 'alac' 'paac' When using afconvert for AAC output, I find little documentation on the format variants under the m4af category:\n'aac', 'aace', 'aacf', 'aach', 'aacl', 'aacp', 'alac', 'paac'.\nI can guess probably 'aac' is the basis, 'alac' is the lossless format, 'aach' is the HE-AAC.

I downloaded an iPhone iOS dmg file from the iOS Dev Center, but don't know how to install it.\nHow do I load it on to my device?\nI'm using iTunes 11 on Windows.\n\nA: Files and applications in the iOS Dev Center are tools for developers working on iOS application development. As an OS X system is required to run Xcode and to install test apps on an iPhone, any supporting tools require OS X as well. You can't install them directly on iOS.\n\nA: You need to use Xcode (free downloadable from AppStore). In the Xcode you go to Window>Organizer, there to Devices and than drag the app from the dmg file to the device.\nXcode may prompt you to turn the device into the development mode for that. This is only to let Xcode install apps.\n\nA: It's actually pretty simple to do in Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the beta .dmg.\n\n*Open it in a file compression/extraction program (I used 7-Zip).\n\n*Locate and extract the .ipsw file.

I'm thinking of purchasing a portable disk drive that supports hardware encryption (most of them seem to do these days). However, if I'm using such a drive can should I still encrypt my TimeMachine backups? I'm assuming that TimeMachine uses software to encrypt the backup data which would be slower than the hardware encryption supported by the drives. Is my assumption wrong?\n\nA: It is neither wrong, nor correct :) The drive uses a chip inside to do the encryption and everything depends on how powerful the chip is. Most likely Mac CPU will be more powerful.\nAlso if you connect over network or through USB2, encryption speed will not matter much because the transfer will be much slower than the encryption.\nI would not bother with hardware-encrypted drives and just use Mac encryption. Why pay more for hardware encryption if you can do it with nearly the same speed on a Mac and you have other speed limiting factors?\n", "Q: Can't select option in OSX Utilities I'm having a pretty bizarre problem in OSX Mavericks. I'm attempting to install a fresh version of the OS, so I boot to OSX Utilities (Cmd+R). The option that I'm looking for is listed (re-install operating system), but I can't select it or anything else from the list.\nI can move the mouse around, but clicking does not work. I tried with both the trackpad as well as a USB mouse. I can navigate through the options with the arrow keys, but pressing enter has no effect.\nHow the heck am I supposed to do anything from the utilities?\n\nA: To get around this problem I went to the option I wanted with the arrow keys then got frustrated when I couldn`t click.\nWhat I proceeded to do was start in the bottom right with the options key and push all the buttons across and up the next two rows skipping the Cap Locks. The continue button then illuminated. To then select it I pushed the space bar. Hope this works  \n\nA: After you highlight the option you want with the arrow keys, press the \"tab\" button to highlight \"continue\" and then press spacebar to select. \n\nA: Click Harder!\nIm not joking. Im experiencing the same issue, tab and space works good too. But I noticed that if I click the trackpad harder and for up to 5 seconds the click eventually registers.\nPerhaps the trackpad needs some tuning that doesnt happen in recovery mode.\nThis is on a 2011 mac book pro with El Captian.\n\nA: As per the above - I had this issue, but I found that although I couldn't 'tap' on my trackpad, I could 'click' (press on bottom left of pad).

After the upgrade she has had issues with the proximity sensor.\nIt works fine when holding the phone to her ear with her hand.  However, when she tries to pinch the phone between her head and her shoulder, the proximity sensor does not see that it is near anything and she ends up dialing keys or hanging up.\nAgain, this only happens when trying to hold the iPhone with her shoulder.\nYour response may be, \"don't do that\".  But she was able to do it with iOS 6 just fine, so it is kind of hard for me to tell her that.\nIt is only after the upgrade to iOS 7 that she started having this issue.\nSo my question is, can the sensitivity of the proximity sensor be adjusted? (So I can put it back to iOS 6 levels?)\n\nA: No, currently there is no way to change the proximity sensor sensitivity in iOS.\nThere is not even any way to change it currently in iOS 6 jailbroken, so even if a jailbreak is developed for iOS 7, it would not mean that the proximity sensor could then be customised.\n", "Q: Finder temporary freeze when copying to network drive (Mavericks) Whenever I try to copy files (usually larger files from > 250MB) to my Synology NAS, Finder temporarily freezes for about 10 seconds and sometimes locks up till the whole file is copied.

The file copy process itself is not slow but I can't use Finder to perform other operations. Many thanks in advance\n\nA: First of all, let's try to verify that OS X is using SMB2 for your shared drive.\nCan you connect via Finder to your NAS share drive? Then open a Terminal (type terminal in Launchpad) and execute the command mount without any parameters, like this:\nmount\n\nThis should output you several lines, one of which should be about your shared drive and how OS X is opening it (using SMB, AFP, NFS, etc.). Can you confirm that OS X is mounting it as SMB (or SMB2 if it shows that level of information)?\nThis is to confirm which protocol is effectively used.\nOnce the protocol is confirmed, try via the command line to copy a file > 250 MB. For this use the command rsync to show the progress, here is an example assuming you have in your home directory a big file named big_file.ext and the shared drive on your NAS is called share:\nrsync --progress big_file.ext /Volumes/share\n\nDo you have the same behaviour? Can you describe it better now?\nFinally, it seems you are not alone and people are proposing workarounds while Apple is preparing (hopefully) a fix: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5467191\nIn addition, try updating your Synology OS to the latest version.

AD password expiration date time is 42 days.\nMy questions are :\n1 - Is remind us our password is expiring like Windows OS? or is there any notification related to this?\n2 - Let's say MAC users wants change their password. How to reset MAC user's expired passwords ?\nis there any equivalent like CTRL+ALT+DELETE combination in windows?\nBecause when to changing my password in the System Preferences, but that did NOT change my AD password. Am I wrong or correct?\n\nA: (1) The only notification on the newer Mac OS releases is a prompt at the login screen once you successfully authenticate.  As it starts to login it receives the notification from AD that your password is set to expire in X number of days.  For instance, if AD is set to remind users of their password expiration 10 days before it expires then the prompt will be along the lines of \"Your password is set to expire in 10 days.  Click change password to change your password or continue to continue logging in.\"\nIf you click continue you will continue logging in and you can change your password later.  If you click change password you will be prompted to enter a new AD password.  This will update your mobile user accounts password as well, however it will NOT update your keychain password or other passwords stored within your account.  The Mac OS basically treats this like a password reset from outside of the system, just like it would if you reset the password from your recovery partition.  Once you've logged in you will need to update your login.keychain (and now with Mavericks, your local/iCloud.keychain) password to match the new password.  While you're in keychain it would be smart to update any of your saved entries for the old password as well.\n(2) I don't think this is correct, although this could be the case if you were not connected to your office network.  Updating through System Preferences > Users & Groups > Change Password is actually my preferred method for our users to update their passwords. This process updates the AD password, the local/mobile account password as well as the keychain passwords.  The only thing our users have to do afterwards is update their Outlook and phone system password entries in their login.keychain and on their iPads & iPhones.  This process only works when you're connected to the network where your Active Directory resides.  When my users are outside of our network (away from the office) they can change their passwords using the option in Microsoft Outlook Web Access.  This is also the only place they'll receive the password expiring in X number of days warning when they're outside of the network.  When they come back to the office they will need to login while connected to the network in order to update the password, then update their keychain password.\nSo my recommended method for our users is this.\nIf you're in the office:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click continue to login without changing your password\n\n*Put your iPad and/or iPhone into Airplane Mode (to prevent account lockout during the process)\n\n*Open System Preferences > Users & Groups, select your account and click Change Password\n\n*Open Keychain Access (Applications/Utilities) and find the entry for your Exchange account.  Double click it to open and change the stored password.  Repeat this for our phone system (it uses AD credentials) entry in keychain.\n\n*On your iPad and/or iPhone, go to Mail, Contacts & Calendars > Work Account > Account and enter your new password.  Disable Airplane Mode once you're finished.\n\n\nIf you're away from the office and it can't wait:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put your iPad and/or iPhone into Airplane Mode (to prevent account lockout during the process)\n\n*Login to Outlook Web Access\n\n*Click on Options > Password, change your password\n\n*Open Keychain Access (Applications/Utilities) and find the entry for your Exchange account.  Double click it to open and change the stored password.  Repeat this for our phone system (it uses AD credentials) entry in keychain.\n\n*On your iPad and/or iPhone, go to Mail, Contacts & Calendars > Work Account > Account and enter your new password.  Disable Airplane Mode once you're finished.\n\n*Login to your user account when you're back in the office.\n\n*Update your keychain password once you've logged in by opening Keychain Access and clicking Edit > Change password for \"login keychain\"\n", "Q: How to use 3 external monitors on 15\" late 2013 MacBook Pro Retina?

Either, 2 thunderbolt, or 1 thunderbolt and 1 HDMI. When I plug in all 3, only 2 of them work.\nApple tech says\n\nYep. You can only have 2 external monitors (unless you want to add a usb monitor).\n\nIs there some trick I am missing? Some setting to tweak? I have 3 monitors just waiting for the solution. One of my monitors feels quite left out...\n\nA: 3 external displays DOES work. \nI am on a Late 2013 MacBook Pro. I have 1 monitor on the HDMI port, 1 on a displayport to HDMI adapter, and one on an ACTIVE displayport to DVI adapter. I'm thinking that the trick here is to use an Active DVI adapter (mine is from Accell)\n\nA: I have a Macbook Pro 15\" Retina (mid 2013). I run three monitors with it.  From the mini HDMI port, I run an old Apple Cinema Display.  From one of the Thunderbolt ports, I run a 2013 Apple Thunderbolt display.  From its Thunderbolt port, I daisy-chain another 2013 Thunderbolt display.\nI have experienced no difficulties with running all three displays at once (typically watch Slingbox or Netflix on one, working on Photoshop with another, and running other apps on both the MacBooks' native display and the old Cinema display monitor.\n\nA: I can confirm that the 13\" MBPROr 2.6gHz i7 can NOT power three external displays. I connected an Apple Thunderbolt Display via Thunderbolt cable, a Cinema Display connected with a mini-display to DVI adapter and a Samsung monitor connected via HDMI. Only two would work at a time. Frankly, when I could get the Samsung to work by disconnecting one of the other monitors, the quality was disappointing using the HDMI but it's a great monitor and I was excited to use it. The quality of the Thunderbolt display is a revelation. It is miles ahead of everything that preceded it. \n\nA: This is my current setup on a Late 2013 15\" MacBook Pro\n\nA: According to the Tech Specs page of the 15\" MBP Retinas the Apple agent wasn't misleading you. I double checked because there was a similar thing with the 2012 Mac Minis that came out. The basic model and the server model could only support 2 displays but the higher end standard Mac Mini with the juiced up GPU could run 3 (2x Thunderbolt and 1x HDMI).\nI assume that the Tech page is accurate in stating that you have only have two external monitors and that an external display via USB or AirPlay might be the next course of action.\nIn the YouTube video the person has a Mid 2012 Retina and I don't know why it works, my suspicion is the iMac in Target Display Mode... According to the Tech Specs for that model Retina it is also limited to two. I'd write the YouTuber and see if he had any troubles setting that up and what tricks he used, if any.\n\nA: just wanted to say , i have just set up 3 external monitors on my early 2013 MBP retina 16 GB ram , NVIDIA gtx 850M 1024 mb , and this works PERFECTLY in OS.X , bootcampt ... I have my middle one set up with hdmi , and 2 others set up with 2 vga cables to 2 minidisplay port - to - vga adapters , THIS WORKS perfectly , no issues at all:)\n\nA: The 2015's Radeon chips lack passive display connections (or timers?).  Pick up an “active” mDP cable and your monitors should come to life.  These GPUs only support two passive connections, the rest NEED to be active cables.

Note that the Apple Cinema Displays have their own graphics card and can be daisy-chained (up to 5 displays) and yet only on thunderbolt port is used to plug into the MacBook.\nThis makes sense if the MacBook can only run two and the third has its own Graphics Card to run itself. \n", "Q: Remove malformed iOS app from device I incorrectly edited the plist that goes with an .ipa file and tried to install this .ipa.\nThereafter the app shows with a missing icon:\n\nSo now I'm not able to delete application that incorrectly installed. \n\n\n*\n\n*Long press on app, selecting ✕ and Delete option does nothing.\n\n*Have tried to do it through iTunes with no result.\n\n*Rebooting doesn't help.\n\n\nI can remove all other applications on device.\nUPDATE 1:\nAfter fixing plist, installation goes with success, but old application remains:\n\nI'm using iPad mini with iOS 7.0.3.\nI know how to correctly install my app, my question is about how to remove aftermath of my last try.\n\nA: Go into Settings > General > Usage\nFrom there find and tap on the app in the list of installed apps and select delete app. \n", "Q: How to create linux USB discs that do work on Apple Macs? It seems that there are several problems releated to incompatibilities between  Apple-EFI and UEFI that do prevent Apple users from easily using USB drives to install or even run other operating systems.\nI am planning to make this a quick guide, so others will not loose precious time encountering the same problems as me.\nIt seems that the latest ISO of Ubuntu that has the UEFI removed in order to be able to boot on Macs is 12.04.3\nWhat I did so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tryed YUMI with mac blend of the ISO and it produces a disc that is recognized by rEFInd but that gives \"Missing Operating System\" when trying to load it..\n\n*unetbootin tool works on OS X, Linux or Windows BUT it will not create USB disks that will work on Macs.\n\n*Tried penguintosh.com with both Ubuntu ISOs and none of them works, it does run and creates the USB disc but it's not recognized by Mac EFI or rEFInd.\n\n\nSo, how can I create an USB disk that will install Ubuntu on Mac, preferably latest version Ubuntu. \nNote: Assume that I do not want to keep anything on the Mac, the USB has to be bootable and any use of DVD drive is excluded.\n\nA: When first posted in 2013, this question never received an answer, because there is no answer. In other words, Intel Macs can not BIOS boot from flash drives. I make the BIOS boot assumption based the the following phase from the OP's question:\n\n\"UEFI removed in order to be able to boot on Macs\"\n\nIf the OP assumes the UEFI boot method has been removed, then the only remaining boot method must be by using a BIOS. Let me explain this further.\nWhen Apple started building Intel Macs with 64 bit processors, most (if not all) models contained firmware with 32 bit EFIs. This prevented the EFI booting of 64 bit operation systems (including OS X). However, these models could BIOS boot 64 bit operating systems. This led to the creation of special Ubuntu installation ISO files designed to install a BIOS booting GRUB. These files can be identified by names ending with the sequence -amd64+mac.iso. The correct procedure was to burn the ISO file to a DVD and use the DVD to install a 64 bit Ubuntu on an Intel Mac. Eventually, some users are still installing Ubuntu this way. For example, see the question Booting 64-bit Ubuntu Images on a First-Generation Mac Pro 1,1.\nUnfortunately, you can not transfer these types of ISO files to USB flash drives and successfully boot using an Intel Mac. Basically, you can not BIOS boot Intel Macs from a USB port. However, you can install a BIOS booting Ubuntu as a dual OS X/Ubuntu boot. This can be accomplished without using a DVD or USB flash drive. For a example, see the question Installing Ubuntu without DVD or Flash Drive.\nBoth bmike (in a comment) and kenorb (in a answer) have correctly pointed out that Ubuntu can be installed using a USB flash drive.

I can turn off vibration, of course, but i really don't know what Do Not Disturb really does!\nIt turns of Vibration and Sound when new Notifications arriving, but when i am using the Phone, it should be complete silent as well.\n\nIs this a bug or just a missing feature?\n\n\nA: It's my understanding that this is by design. \nDo Not Disturb mode is meant to be active when the phone is not actively in use. The idea behind it is that, if the phone is unlocked and you are working with it, you do in fact WANT to be notified of a new item. \nHowever, when the phone is locked and dormant, the logic is that you no longer wish to be disturbed, and it will suppress vibration / notification indicators.\nSo for example, if you are sleeping, and DND is on, then it will remain silent, and not vibrate. If you roll over, pick up your phone to check messages, and it's active, the DND will still allow vibrate to indicate new messages while you are using it. \n\nA: When you're in the middle of using the Messages app, and you receive a new message, it's actually the Messages app itself that is asking the phone to vibrate, rather than a notification coming in and causing the phone to vibrate. So you're right, the 'Do Not Disturb' setting doesn't stop apps from asking the phone to vibrate or play audio while they are being used -- it only affects the behaviour of notifications.\nThis is a design decision that goes all the way back to the first iPhone OS, to the best of my knowledge. You can see it in the behaviour of the 'ring/silent' switch: if you have the switch set to silent, then notifications don't make any sound, but an app is still allowed the play audio (e.g. the Music app).\nA 'total and complete silence, no vibrations, please, whatever I'm doing, yes I really meant it' setting would be really useful, but it doesn't exist in iOS. The closest you can get to guarantee silence is to manually:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn 'Do Not Disturb' on, and set 'Silence' to 'Always'.\n\n*In 'Sounds', turn all 'Vibrate' settings off.\n\n*Set the 'ring/silent' switch to 'silent'.\n\n*In Control Center, pull the volume down to zero.\n\n*Use the volume buttons to turn the Ringer volume down to zero.\n\n\nA: If you go into the do not disturb settings, at the bottom there is an option to silence always or only when the phone is locked.\n\nA: May be its not obvious but if the app is using yet notifications system DND applies. \nIf the app is configured for sound but not notifications DND may not apply. \nUnder test since iPhone woke me up this morning!\n\nA: Use Airplane Mode. Simply pull up Control Panel and tap the Airplane icon On and Off. \n", "Q: Unable to connect to TP-Link wireless router with iPad 2 I work in an office of 3 developers, all of whom own an iPad.

No big deal, you may say - I just don't have the bandwidth for it. The only thing is, if I copy the video over the network to my laptop, it only takes 10 minutes for a 90 minute movie, telling me that I have 9X the bandwidth required for streaming. This suggests that buffering may be the problem, but I've used both Movist and VLC and get the same problems.\nHas anyone experienced something similar - where more than enough bandwidth is available, but video streaming still stutters horribly?

I've installed MacZFS, I've read the FAQ and Getting Started section, but I've still troubles to understand how to simply format the external drive into ZFS on OSX. I'm confused with zpools, can anybody explains what are the zpools and how to format the drive?\nI've tried also to use Disk Utility ZFS-Dumodule, but without success.\nIs there any simple command to format the hard drive or to use Disk Utility for that? \nMy drive is: /dev/disk5.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Solaris tip of the week: file-based ZFS for development and test environments\n\nA: The getting started page you posted a link to explains how to create a simple one disk pool.\nThis is the only thing you need to do. Creating a pool will automatically create a file system with the same name as the pool, which is what you call formatting a drive.\nIn your case, you can run from the command line:\ndiskutil partitiondisk /dev/disk5 GPTFormat ZFS %noformat% 100%\nzpool create extdrive /dev/disk5s2\n\nand you'll have a new volume named extdrive available.\nIf you happen to run software with inconsistent file naming, like Adobe products and possibly Nikon capture, you might want to create a dedicated file system with case insensitivity set using something like:\nzfs create -o casesensitivity=insensitive -o normalization=formD  extdrive/data\n\n\nA: I'm not so familiar with ZFS on Mac, so I'll try and speak on ZFS in general.\nZFS is a software-based volume manager that you can use to 'virtually' RAID a number of disks together. \nThe resultant storage volume that is created, is referred to as a zpool.\n\n\n*\n\n*For example, you can take 2x raw disks [2x 3TB disks for example] and create a zpool (mirrored) via:\nzpool create MyPool mirror /dev/sda /dev/sdb\n\n*It's possible you might not have raw disks; in this case you can force ZFS to use preformatted disks by using the -f flag:\nzpool create -f MyPool mirror /dev/sda /dev/sdb\n\n*In your case, with a single preformatted disk, you can try forcing the creation of a zpool via:\nzpool create -f MyPool /dev/sda\n\n*Some disks use a 4k sector size. You might choose to create your zpool using a 4k sector size to maintain proper alignment:\nzpool create -f -o ashift=12 MyPool /dev/sda\nNow let's assume you have a zpool called MyPool with total pool capacity of 3TB (mirrored 2x 3TB drives).\nCreating A Filesystem:\n\n\n*\n\n*From that raw 'pool' of storage, you can now create a filesystem. Your OS will be able to use/read/write the filesystem... NOT the pool.\n\n*create a ZFS filesystem on your pool via:\nzfs create MyPool/Videos\n\n*Now you should have a zfs filesystem called 'Videos' residing in /MyPool/Videos\n\n*You can freely read and write to /MyPool/Videos, share it over the network, set permissions, etc.\n\n\nCreating a Virtual Block Device:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want, you can also create a virtual block device from your zpool via:\nzfs create -V 100GB MyPool/TestDevice\n\n*TestDevice will be a virtual device with 100GB capacity, and it generally resides in:\n/dev/zvol/MyPool/TestDevice\n\n*You can create any filesystem you want on TestDevice (HFS, EXT4, NTFS, etc), mount it, then use it!\n\n\nYou can create a bunch of Filesystems/Virtual-block-devices on your pool, and use them all very differently.\n\n\n*\n\n*For example, you can have a zpool with multiple filesystems/virtual-devs tuned accordingly to Videos, TimeMachine-backups, Databases, etc respectively.\n\n*All these filesystems/virtual-devs would share from the same pool of storage. All data on the pool is redundant and dynamically protected against bit-rot.\n\n\nA: First, find your device node:\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk1\n   1:               Windows_NTFS My Book                 4.0 TB     disk1s1\n\nThen format your HDD (where /dev/disk1 is your device node from above command):\n$ zpool create -f -O casesensitivity=insensitive -O normalization=formD WD_4TB /dev/disk1\nchecking path '/dev/disk1'\n\n\nYou may be able to improve performance for some workloads by setting ashift=12. This tuning can only be set when the pool is first created and it will result in a decrease of capacity.

I'm curious about how stable are pre-release versions of minor software updates (OSX 10.9.1-pre, for example) for everyday use in production.\nHad anyone encountered any bugs with pre-release versions in the past that made the system unusable?\n\nA: Like all pre-release software it's mixed.

Doing that, Mac OS should only use the integrated GPU until you either switch it back to automatic or explicitly tell it to use the discrete GPU.

However, I'm thinking their power strip may have just been accidentally unplugged for a second.\n\nA: Yes. This setting reliably prevents a Mac from sleeping. I've had my iMac set to \"Never\" sleep for over a year, and it's still running (though its display turns off after 10 minutes or so per the other setting on that screen).\n", "Q: runaway distnoted process Sometimes I see a distnoted process suddenly spin up and chew up 100% CPU (on one core) and a ton of memory, often in the neighborhood of 1.5G or so. This happens a few times a day, starting a month or so ago.\nThe command line is /usr/sbin/distnoted agent, and it's started by launchd, neither of which help much. It's usually been running for somewhere between 4h and 24h before it spins up and pegs the CPU.\nWeb searches say distnoted manages notification delivery, and lots of other people report the same problem with it, but I haven't yet found a fix. Some people find that closing a culprit application (e.g. Skype) stops it, but I haven't found a culprit on my machine yet. I'm usually only running a few apps: Emacs (24.2 from Homebrew), Firefox, Adium, and Dash.\nI'm on Mavericks on a late 2012 13\" Retina MBP.

On 10.9 with emacs 24.3.1 from homebrew (or from emacsforosx) the distnoted + emacs leak (they both slowly increase in memory consumption) will happen with one shell-mode buffer open. It won't if you just visit files.\nJust wanted to note it here, gmane appears to be down and I keep finding this discussion on my twice weekly search for followups to this issue.\n\nA: I've seen this too.  Emacs 24.3.1, Mavericks 10.9.\nI've found that the distnoted process calms down within seconds after I quit out of Emacs.\nI've filed an Emacs bug here: http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.bugs/80836\n\nA: This seems to happen when an application somehow makes a wrong use of the notification API provided by macOS. In my case the culprit was iTerm2. After quitting it, the distnoted processes exited. Other culprits that have been identified are Emacs and iTunes.\n\nA: Summary from the OP: This was a great tool for debugging. It originally pointed me to Spotlight reindexing the filesystem, but I narrowed down the things it's allowed to index, and I still saw the problem. I ended up setting up a cron job to kill distnoted regularly. See answer farther down.\n\nYou can debug distnoted by creating the file /var/log/do_dnserver_log \nThis causes the CFNotificationCenter server (distnoted) to record information about all notifications to the system log.\nI would start there, reboot and look at the system log when the CPU spikes up. This should out the culprit easily.\nMore info on CFNotificationCenter debugging can be found in official Developer docs here: Technical Note TN2124 > CFNotificationCenter\n\nA: I know I'm late to the party but this is a memory leak specific to Cocoa emacs on Mavericks that is fixed in the trunk. For now there is a patch you can use to build emacs 24.3 with just the fix.\nhttps://gist.github.com/anonymous/8553178\n\n\nA: I think I can only remember 2 occasions where distnoted has gone haywire. On this occasion there were 2 of them sitting to top of cpu list and one was over 400%. It happened shortly after returning to the office and plugging in a couple of external displays - one of which is usb powered - I took a guess that it might be related. I did nothing else to try and fix the problem before pulling the USB display out which brought sanity back instantly. And then plugging it back in resulted in no repeat problem.\nWhich proves what? No idea!\nI plug them in hundreds of times and this is the first time that it occurred to me that it might be related. And since it doesn't happen everytime I plug them it, then it might have something to do with plugging them both in too quickly after each other, or something random like that. Anyhow thought I would share in case other people find it has anything to do with plugging in peripherals (if that is what an external screen is)\n\nA: I've been having the same problems with distnoted on El Capitan for some time. My solution isn't as harsh as killing it regularly, rather I check for it running out of control (high CPU usage), and then kill it. I use this script:\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# check for runaway distnoted, kill if necessary\n#\nPATH=/bin:/usr/bin\nexport PATH\n\nps -reo '%cpu,uid,pid,command' | \n    awk -v UID=$UID '\n    /distnoted agent$/ && $1 > 100.0 && $2 == UID { \n        system(\"kill -9 \" $3) \n    }\n    '\n\nThe script is run from cron every minute with this line in crontab:\n*   *  *   *  *   sh \"$HOME/bin/checkdistnoted\"\n\nIn practice, the script kills distnotedonce or twice a day, and typically this occurs after backupd starts.\nFor those not comfortable with the using the OS X shell (command line), the following script will install both the checkdistnoted script and the crontab entry:\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# install $HOME/bin/checkdistnoted\n# setup crontab to run every minute\n# \n# MWR Apr 2016\n#\n\nINSTALLCMD=bin/checkdistnoted\ncd \"$HOME\"\n[ ! -d bin ] && mkdir bin\n[ -f $INSTALLCMD ] || {\n    cat > $INSTALLCMD <<-\"!!\"\n    #!/bin/sh\n    #\n    # check for runaway distnoted, kill if necessary\n    #\n\n    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin\n    export PATH\n\n    ps -reo '%cpu,uid,pid,command' | \n        awk -v UID=$UID '\n        /distnoted agent$/ && $1 >= 100.0 && $2 == UID { \n            # kill distnoted agent with >= 100% CPU and owned by me\n            system(\"kill -9 \" $3) \n        }\n        '\n!!\n    chmod +x $INSTALLCMD \n    echo installed $INSTALLCMD\n}\n\nINSTALLCRON=\"# check for runaway distnoted every minute:\n* * * * * sh \\\"\\$HOME/$INSTALLCMD\\\"\"\ncrontab -l | grep -q '$HOME'/$INSTALLCMD || {\n    crontab -l > mycron\n    echo \"$INSTALLCRON\" >> mycron\n    crontab mycron\n    rm mycron\n    echo updated crontab\n}\n\nYou need to save the above as install_checkdistnoted.sh on your desktop, then run Applications/Utilities/Terminal and type:\ncd Desktop\nsh install_checkdistnoted.sh \n\nIf it works fully it will print confirmation of each of the steps. The script won't overwrite an existing checkdistnoted script or crontab entry.\n\nA: For what it's worth, I was able to fix this problem by disabling my anti-virus software.\n\nA: This happened to me as well, distnoted was going crazy. After closing a bunch of applications, nothing helped. \nThen I noticed one of those 'Report to Apple' dialogs from a crashed Python process had been left open all night.\nThough it could just be coincidence, after closing the dialog the distnoted process calmed down.\n\nA: I ran into a similar issue with distnoted a few months ago and could not track down why the CPU usage was spiking above 100%. Finally, I added an entry to my crontab to killall distnoted every 2 minutes which solved my problem.\nRecently, I have been having an issue with Sublime Text where typing subl path/to/file was failing to open the file correctly in the Sublime Editor. A restart of the app fixed the issue, but it quickly began to happen again.\nAfter racking my brain to no end, I identified the fact that I was killing distnoted process every 2 minutes to why the subl command had mysteriously stopped working.\nThe conclusion: the super high CPU usage may have been related to sublime. Now that sublime has updated, hopefully my conclusion is correct, CPU usage remains low, and my subl command returns to working as expected now that distnoted is running again without my crontab killing the process every 2 minutes.\n\nA: I've had this problem too, for quite some time now, but intermittently. Apparently distnoted is part of iTunes and has caused problems on Windows as well. When I killed iTunes (which was playing a song), the distonted process that was using 400% of my CPU (I have 4 cores) stopped being a problem. \nSo my answer, until I know better, is to recommend that you kill iTunes, not distnoted, and let us know what happens.\n\nA: Peter Buckley is right, I'm wrong.   I hate it when that happens.\nDon't remove distnoted, the next boot will be no fun at all.\n\nwrong> I took a more sledgehammer approach\nwrong> \nwrong>    sudo mv /usr/sbin/distnoted /usr/bin/distnoted.unwanted\nwrong>\nwrong> This is a work machine and I have no interest in sync'ing with iTunes.\n\n\n\nA: I also see distnoted go haywire, in my case it seems related to fontd. I have three distnoted running, one for _spotlight, one for _distnote and one for my user.\ndistnoted   0,0 6:39,85 2   0   101 _distnote   0 bytes 0 bytes     No      -   No  No  No  0 bytes 0 bytes 64 bit\ndistnoted   0,0 0,05    2   0   642 _spotlight  0 bytes 0 bytes     Yes     -   No  No  No  0 bytes 0 bytes 64 bit\ndistnoted   82,1    1:19:38,30  49  1   353 nils    0 bytes 0 bytes     No      -   No  No  No  0 bytes 0 bytes 64 bit\n\nWhenever distnoted eats cpu (30-90%), fontworker and fontd eats about 30-60% cpu each. As soon as I kill fontd, distnoted and fontworker for my user calms down. Killing fontworker does nothing. After a couple of minutes when fontd has restarted and been running a while it all starts again.\nfontworker  27,2    52,81   4   1   1073    nils    0 bytes 0 bytes     No      -   No  No  No  0 bytes 0 bytes 64 bit\n\nfontd   32,6    1:07,41 6   0   1072    nils    0 bytes 0 bytes     No      -   No  No  No  0 bytes 0 bytes 64 bit\n\nI have no clue on why this is happening…\n", "Q: Uploading app to app-store with same name for another developer id Let me explain clearly,\nI have developed an application and created an app in the app-store with an apple developer id.

I have not independently verified that this addresses the problem, since the above work-around had already taken care of my issue, but their release notes say simply “Fixed a Keychain issue.”  Both the new version and the release notes can easily be found at the iStat Server link above.\n", "Q: How to install apache24 and php55 from macports?

Aim: I would like to charge my MacBook Pro (MBP) form a 12V lead-acid battery. However there are no official chargers from Apple for that purpose. There exist quite some alternative products on the internet. For example this one simply comes with a MagSafe adapter and lets you choose 18V. However I am afraid that such a solution might hurt my battery.\nDoes anybody know how exactly the MBP battery is charged? Does it require a particular charge line? Is it OK to simply connect 18 Volts and see what happens?\n\nA: If you connect 18 V to the power/ground pins, your Mac will be powered off the 12 V battery, but it won't charge: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/132332/26231\nTo charge, the laptop needs to identify the charger by communicating over the signal pin in the middle. http://www.righto.com/2013/06/teardown-and-exploration-of-magsafe.html\nSolution: Sacrifice an apple charger by cutting the cable and connecting the correct pins to your DC/DC converter. I recommend using the 45 W ones so your DC power supply doesn't have to be very big.\n\nA: Use a DC to AC inverter.\nYou simply attach the alligator clips to the correct battery terminals, turn the device on  and plug your cord into the inverter. It's that simple.\nAmazon sells a 400 watt inverter for $25, that's all you'll need.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RNOHBC/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n", "Q: Using bluetooth PAN with iPad Air I have Mac Book Pro running Mavericks and my iPad Air with iOS 7.

When it boots up to the login screen it will let me move the cursor around, but it won't recognize click events.\nI thought it was the trackpad, so I connected a wired mouse, and the symptoms persist.\nAfter a little searching online I found that MacBook Pro owners have been having this same issue, and that Apple recommends closing the lid for 60 seconds, which causes some reset.\nThis has also worked for me, however, a few minutes into working, the cursor will stop accepting click events (even though I can still move it).\nI can't keep closing and opening my lid every few minutes. Anyone got any ideas?\n\nA: I just had this problem and was resetting SMC and all kinds of other things. Then realized I had set something on my Magic Trackpad under my monitor, which was registering a click obviously so killed all other clicking. Make sure you eliminate that possibility!\n\nA: I just had this problem too. What fixed it for me was enabling the Mouse keys in \"System Preferences->Accessibility->Mouse & Trackpad\" with the option to press the option-key five times to toggle the feature. Once you have this enabled press the \"i\" key to single click. \nI psuedo single clicked with the \"i\" key a few times and then my actual mouse clicks started working again.\n\nA: Found a strange solution for the same issue with Mavericks on an iMac not clicking. However, while I couldn't click anything in the desktop, app windows or launchpad, I was able to click menu items.\nMy solution was simply to open the alert menu (default set to swipe two fingers from the very right edge of a trackpad, toward the left). The first time the menu appeared beneath the application windows, but the second time it moved the desktop and apps in normal fashion.\nAfter that, I was able to click normally. Still don't know what caused the issue.\n\nA: One of the most common causes of this is a magic mouse turned on in your laptop bag or somewhere similar. \nTurning off bluetooth will ensure no remote button is being held down. \n\nA: Typically they way I ask people to troubleshoot such problems is asking them if the issues exist using a freshly created new user account on the machine, and if the issues exist when they boot from the Recovery volume. If the answer to both is yes than the likelihood is that you have a hardware problem. If you don't experience the problem in a clean user account than you have an issue with your preferences or applications, and if you don't have the issue in the Recovery volume than you have a system wide issue a re-install will fix. \nThat said, if it's not a software problem cleared up by one of the above, I've seen similar issues that are hardware related where something presses up against the trackpad from underneath it. Sometimes this has been caused by a building battery in the MacBook, or something that has lodged underneath the trackpad. If there's pressure under the trackpad it will register as if the \"mouse\" is already clicked down and will also explain why adding another mouse or trackpad also exhibits the same problem. \nDoes the mousepad physically and noticeably \"click\" down when pressed? If not then it needs repaired of the issue underneath it fixed. \n\nA: I thought I'd finally fixed the \"mouse tracks but won't register clicks\" issue by cleaning ALL battery contact points + & - in the belly of the mouse with rubbing alcohol on a swab. In my case, the +  contacts were visibly \"foggy\"/dirty.\nAfter doing so, clicking worked but my iMac behaved as if it wouldn't let go of the \"down click\" state, so, it lasso'd everything until I turned the mouse off.  :(\nSO, what actually WORKED was *holding down the POWER button on my Apple wireless keyboard\" for a loooong time. Evidently, cycling the power on the wireless kybd \"woke up\" the proper functionality for my Apple Magic Mouse. (OF course, I trashed the various preference files before any of this, and un-paired & re-paired the bluetooth for the Magic Mouse). Turned my keyboard back on & now all is well... just had to re-enable the right-click functionality via Mouse System Preference.\n\nA: I had the same problems as most of the statements and tried most of the suggestions to no avail.  I finally reloaded Maverick, which takes a long time, using the Mac utilities.  So far trackpad works like a charm.  I don't know if Apple made some changes since Maverick first came out or the first load became corrupted but works great.  Hope this helps as I know how frustrating the problem is. \n\nA: I Just had the same problem with my Macbook. Could not left click using the mouse or trackpad. Although the pointer would move and the right click is working.\nThe solution for me is to take out the battery. Then, the left click and trackpad works fine.\nAlso noticed the battery had a large bulge in the middle. I'm sure this is putting pressure on the trackpad from underneath.\nGood Luck,\nAlan\n\nA: What I surmise is that the Trackpad button is stuck clicking.  This is disabling\nthe button on any USB mouse that I connect.  The Rowmote iPhone app must use a different\ncomm HW/SW path.  When I set the Accessability Preferences to ignore the trackpad when\na USB mouse is connected, the mouse button works after I close & open the laptop.\nSo I can use a USB mouse until I replace the top case of the MacBook.\nThis is kind of the reverse or the problem or a BT mouse being stuck on inside a bag or laptop case.\n\nA: So, what worked for me:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist ControllerPowerState 0\n\nps -A | grep blue # find the blued process ID\nsudo kill -9 PROCESS_ID_NUMBER\n\nSome more commands from: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2619301?tstart=0\nsudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist ControllerPowerState\n\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist ControllerPowerState 0\n\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist ControllerPowerState 1 \n\nsudo killall blued\n\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist\n\nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist\n\nsudo launchctl start com.apple.blued\n\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.blued\n\n", "Q: How to recover missing notes since Mavericks update?

I have a new (late 2013) MBP that I use with an external monitor. Annoyingly, when I plug/unplug the monitor, arbitrary spaces end up being fixed to either the internal or external monitor. Going to mission control doesn't appear to let me move spaces from one monitor to another, so I have to manually shuffle around each window. Is there a keyboard shortcut (or something) I'm missing to move spaces between monitors?\nThanks!\n\nA: TotalSpaces allows you to assign spaces and their contents to specific monitors.\n\n\nA: You can only move spaces which are non-active.\nFor example, lets say you have spaces 1 and 2. If space 1 is active, you can not move it. You first have to select space 2 then you can move space 1 to a different monitor.\n", "Q: OSX Mavericks and OSX Lion Login Server At work, we are required to login to our work stations via an OSX Lion Server. I now need to update my iMac to Mavericks (for iOS7 and Xcode 5 support). Will the server need to be updated as well? If so, will every Mac in the office need to be upgraded as well (we are trying to avoid this scenario)?\n\nA: Updating Server.app is not really necessary. OS X Mavericks clients are backward compatible with OS X Lion Server, in the same way Mavericks Server is backward compatible with Lion clients. It is only required to update Server.app if you want the new features available in the updated OS X Server, or if you wish to upgrade the host OS on the server (i.e. Lion Server.app is not compatible with OS X Mavericks).\n\nA: Are you asking if your workstation (client) iMac can be upgraded to Mavericks and still retain the functionality of accessing your user account / files / etc provided by the Lion Server?\nIf so then yes.  The only functionality that the central Lion Server couldn't provide to you is the Software Update Server, where software updates are cached by and served out from your office's server.  In order to retain the Software Update Server, and possible Caching server, functionality you would need to update the Lion Server to Mavericks.\nAside from that you should still be able to access your network user account, shared files, etc from the Lion Server using your iMac running Mavericks.\nSource: I currently have 9 Mavericks clients accessing our central Mac Pro running Mountain Lion server.  Software Update Server is the only function of the server that doesn't work with the Mavericks clients.  For software updates I upgraded an old secondary Mac mini server to Mavericks and installed the 3.0 Server client, the only service that is active is Software Update Server and only the Mavericks clients pull from it.\n", "Q: Deleted photos continue appearing in screensaver I use one of OS X's built-in photo screensavers and point it to my Dropbox folder so that photos I add to Dropbox automatically appear. However, I've noticed that photos I've deleted from Dropbox continue appearing in the screensaver, long after they've been deleted.\nI suspect that when I first set up the screensaver, OS X cached a copy of the photos in my Dropbox folder, so they remain even after I've deleted the source photos.\nIf so, is there any way to clear this cache to keep the deleted photos from appearing? I've tried toggling between different screensavers, but they still show up. And I thought maybe the cache would clear itself after a few hours or a day, but it's now been nearly a week and the deleted photos are still appearing.\n\nA: I can't reproduce your problem in Mavericks or Mountain Lion; if I add an image to the watched directory and start the screensaver, the new image appears; if I delete the image and restart the screensaver it disappears. So a logout/login cycle and/or restarting the Mac seems called for.\nBut if those fail, I saw a similar issue some years ago that resulted from a corrupted screensaver preferences file, and you could try solving it the same way: Try flushing the screensaver preferences by deleting the plist file.\nTo do that, in the Terminal, run the following (quit System Preferences first):\nrm -i \"$(ls -t ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.[0-9A-F]*.plist | head -1)\"\n\nThe -i is for safety; it should ask if you want to remove a single file, like this:\nremove /Users/trey/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.65BC01F5-7A67-5B3E-9193-9464C78533AD.plist?\nConfirm by pressing y and return. If it asks to remove a file that doesn't look like that, or tries to remove more than one file, press Control-C to abort.\nNow re-open System Preferences, select the screensaver again and point it at the Dropbox directory again. The screensaver should now update normally.\n", "Q: Upgrade from iPhone 3G 4.2.1 to iPhone 5S 7.0.4 A friend of mine has a good old iPhone 3G (yep, the thing still works :)) and he just bought an iPhone 5S.

The iPhone 5S just starts in his configuration screen (select language). So it looks like the backup cannot be restored.\nWeird thing is, when he tries to turn off the iPhone 5S, the background screen of his iPhone 3G is shown... So some data has been transferred, but not enough for the iPhone 5S to boot with the restore...\nWhat's going on here? Is the backup of the iPhone 3G too old? Or is he missing something?\n\nA: I just upgraded from 3G to 5S and at first had the same problem. What I learned in another chat was that prior to restore I had to update to IOS 6.1... Once the OS was updated, I backed up the 3G and did a restore to the 5S from the latest 3G backup. It took a long time, but was well worth it.\n", "Q: Moving a folder copies it, no longer moves it I changed permissions on a folder to allow another user of that same computer, so they could access it while logged in.  I wanted to then move that folder (formerly in Pictures folder) to the Shared folder.  Now when I attempt to move the folder, it will only copy it.  I've tried resetting the sharing/permissions to what they originally were using the info panel, Sharing & Permissions, but it doesn't change the the fact that every time I try and move them, the computer just duplicates them in a new location.  \nIs there a way to fix this or to reset permissions (since I'm assuming that's what the issue is) to a default state for that user?  I'm running Mavericks.\n\nA: Do you have write permission to the parent folder of the folder? If you don't, you can force moving the folder by holding command while dragging it.\nYou can see if you have write permission to a folder by running ls -led /path/to/folder:\n$ ls -led Desktop/untitled\\ folder/\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 2 lauri  staff  68 Nov 21 08:46 Desktop/untitled folder/\n 0: user:test allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If the output includes lines for an ACL like above, try removing the ACL with sudo chmod -N /path/to/folder.\n\n*If the owner in the third column of the first line is not you, try running sudo chmod $USER /path/to/folder.\n\n*If the owner is you but you don't have write permission, or the first column looks like dr-xr-xr-x+ instead of drwxr-xr-x+, try running sudo chmod +w /path/to/folder.\n\n\nA: If you only have read access to a file/folder, you can only copy instead of move. Use Get Info to apply read/write to the folder and contents, then attempt to copy the folder again.\n\nIf you wish to reset the permissions on a user's home folder as you mentioned, you can use the ACL tool on the Recovery HD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the Recovery HD using ⌘R.\n\n*Run resetpassword in Terminal (available from Utilities → Terminal).\n\n*Select the account you wish to reset the permissions for from the drop-down list.\n\n*Click the Reset button for Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs.\n\n", "Q: Cannot create a file with sudo in Apache web directory Suddenly the following problem has happened:\nI have an Apache web directory at /www.

On the other hand I am able to create new files in my home directory (using both mentioned ways) and then to copy or move them to /www. What may be the issue and how to solve it?\n\nA: sudo echo \"\" > newfile should never have worked, because sudo only applies to the echo command and not to the redirection. Try using sudo touch newfile or echo \"\" | sudo tee newfile.\nSublime Text doesn't seem to support creating new files to a directory you don't have write permission to. It does support authenticating as root when modifying an existing file though. See http://sublimetext.userecho.com/topic/27820-prompt-if-need-elevated-permission-to-save/.\nMaybe you did have write permission to the directory earlier but something (like upgrading to 10.9) removed it.\n", "Q: how can I create a new mail folder?

Does it do anything else?\n\nA: This is the iCloud Mail service. Turning it on provides the iCloud mail account for Mail.app to use, nothing more. It is basically an automated method of entering the iCloud mail server information into Mail.app to configure your @icloud.com email account, per this Apple KB article:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud: Mail server information\nIt does not sync other accounts in any way - settings or emails of other accounts are not affected by this setting, just your @icloud.com or @me.com account.\n\nYou can read more about iCloud Mail at this Apple KB article:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud: Mail overview\n", "Q: Ipad Mini is locked!

Then, this morning, I turn it on and see that I need to put in a password! I never input a password, so can anyone tell me why this just happened?\n\nA: It's possible that your school, or school district, has the device under control of an MDM which can set a lock code remotely. This action may have been accidental, or deliberate, but your only recourse is to ask the IT department to fix it for you.\nThis functionality, and many other options, is available in Meraki, and I have used it myself.\n", "Q: Can't share the boot drive root dir with authorization for \"everyone\" set to \"no access\"? If you add your boot drive to the network filesharing list of shares, the option to set the privileges for class \"everyone\" to \"no access\" is disabled. \n\nCan anyone explain why? Or how to enable it?\nAccording to this thread, authenticated users always have privileges to their home dirs, and authenticated admins always have privileges to the whole disk. So in some sense, adding the whole disk and disabling nonauthenticated users is redundant; you could just delete the share if that's the behavior you want. But what if you want more fine grained access for some groups, but still no read access for unauth'ed users? It seems impossible to accomplish this.\nAlso it seems rather arbitrary that the OS restricts that authorization option for network sharing, given the fact that the system will happily remove filesystem permissions from the boot disk, making the system unbootable. You'll let me wreck my boot disk making the entire disk unreadable to world, but you won't do the analogous but innocuous for network shares? Can anyone account for that?\n\nA: It's not innocuous. The permissions you're seeing (and controlling) in the Sharing preference pane are the regular filesystem permissions, not some separate sharing-only permissions. Setting the permissions here to Everyone: No Access would deny all users (other than root) access to the entire volume, thus rendering your Mac unbootable. This seems like a good enough reason to prevent you from doing it.\nYou could ask why the Finder does allow you to do this, but I don't think there's any particularly deep answer. It's impossible to block all possible destructive actions, so inevitably Apple will have chosen some to block and not bothered with others.\n", "Q: How do i know exactly what is taking up space in iCloud?

Having 10 seconds as an delay should give you enough time to re-open the editor and click on \"stop\". Another option would be to use repeat while instead and to create a stop criterium, like if exists \"/path/to/makeitstop\" as POSIX file which would make it stop after a file makeitstop is created.\n", "Q: How to open CSV file with Microsoft Excel and get the information into separate columns?

I read here that \"The standard U.S. layout has a few dead key stated under ⌥\". Does that mean that pressing Alt+that key would make that key act as a dead one?  \nI am looking for a layout that uses as dead keys the symbols that look like accents before the letters that one wants accented, like the \"US-International\" in Win7 and \"English-US, with dead keys\" in Ubuntu-Linux. In these layouts, the keys for ` , ' , ^ , \" are dead. After them, Space key brings the character as such, while something like e will bring è, é, ê, ë respectively.\nAre there such keyboard layouts for Mac? (I am very new to the system.)\n(I am not looking for answers like \"use this app and create your own layouts\".)\n\nA: The answer to your new question is the US International PC layout provided by Apple. \n\nA: They don't normally produce absolutely nothing.  You will usually see the accent mark in yellow when you press the dead key.  Here is a list of standard accent dead keys\nhttp://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/accents/codemac.html#accent\nThat is: \nFor each accent, a certain different key has to be used along with the Option (Alt) key , before the letter that we want accented:\nFor example, for the accents with the letter O:\nAcute   accent (ó Ó)           Option+E, o\nCircumflex  (ô Ô)   Option+I, o\nGrave   (ò Ò)   Option+`, o\nTilde   (õ Õ)   Option+N, o     Only works with \"n,o,a\"\nUmlaut  (ö Ö)   Option+U, o      \nExample 1: To input the letter ó, hold down the Option key, then the E key.

I don't want to or need to share files across platforms and require the following structure:\nPartition 1 - Mac OSX Journaled case-sensitive Encrypted\nPartition 2 - Windows FAT 32 (not encrypted)\nEach method I have tried doesn't work as it appears that to allow encryption on the Mac partition, the root partition scheme needs to be GUID.  Doing this means my windows machine can't see the (FAT32) windows partition.\nIf I set the partition scheme to MBR, disk utility doesn't show the option to format the Mac partition as encrypted. \nIt may be that there's just not a solution to this and I'll need to carry 2 USB sticks or get into sparse disk images, but confirmation of this would be useful. I've read similar posts on the stack exchange & elsewhere but none seem to cover the exact same set-up.\nMany thanks for any help\n\nA: If you don't actually require case-sensitivity, Truecrypt is a free and open-source encryption system that will allow you to do either encrypt an entire volume using the Mac OS Extended filesystem or make a encrypted file container (basically an encrypted folder) that can be used to save files as if it were a separate volume.\nYou will need to download the program from the link above and install it. The Truecrypt program itself will allow you to create encrypted volumes/file containers and mount the encrypted volumes or file containers to your system to use them.\n\nA: You should be able to create a hybrid GPT+MBR partition table to let both OSes see their volumes. Hybrid partition table aren't standard (they try to comply with the important bits of two different -- conflicting -- standards), so there are some potential gotchas. This page from Rod Smith has a good explanation, and covers how to use his gdisk tool to create them. You might also be able to use the (simpler but less flexible) gptsync tool, which simply clones the GPT table into an MBR -- but I'm not sure if it's smart enough to deal with an encrypted partition.\nBTW, I'm not clear on why a GPT-only setup isn't working. According to Microsoft, Windows 7 should be able to use a GPT-formatted disk:\n\nQ.    Can Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 read, write, and boot from GPT disks?\nA.    Yes, all versions can use GPT partitioned disks for data. Booting is only supported for 64-bit editions on UEFI-based systems.\n\n...so there may be something else going on.\n", "Q: On Mavericks, in the Finder in List view, column widths keep changing I'm on OS X Mavericks. In Finder, I use the \"List\" view. In this view, since upgrading to Mavericks, the column widths keep changing. Basically, the Name column expands to fill the window up, when you resize a Finder window. But worse of all, they are then fixed at that new width. So for instance, I open a folder, such as ~/Downloads, then increase the width horizontally to the right. I close this, then open ~/, which is the original width size. I then open the ~/Downloads folder, and now the columns are wider than the window. \nIs there any way to stop this from happening? Does this only happen to me? I already tried resetting my com.apple.finder.plist file, but since Mavericks now caches plist files, the file just gets re-created instantly after deleting it, so that doesn't work anymore.\n\nA: I was so sick of this, so I decided to write a fix once and for all. \nYou can use the following AppleScript to resize the column widths when you notice the column is too wide. It works by resizing the Finder window really large, then back to it's original size, triggering a fluid layout resize.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n  tell the front Finder window\n    -- get the current bounds of the finder window\n    set b to the bounds\n    -- create a really wide window\n    set the bounds to {item 1 of b, item 2 of b, 3000, item 4 of b}\n    -- set window back to its original size\n    set the bounds to b\n  end tell\nend tell\n\nThis will probably be most useful if bound to a keyboard shortcut, I personally bound it to CMD + E using BetterTouch Tool. \nIf you're after more detailed information regarding this, you can head over to my blog post about it here: https://christianvarga.com/fix-finder-name-column-width-bug-osx-mavericks/\n\nA: He means the column width in list view \"name\" \"date modified\" \"size\" etc\nI have the same problem, and it is a major pain when i can't see the size of files because the default width of the column is too small even if i stretch, it will reset as soon as i change folders\n\nA: I found a solution that seems to fix this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a new Finder window.\n\n*If not all of the columns are visible, drag the lower right corner of the window to the right until they are.\n\n*Resize the first column to be narrower.\n\n*Close the window immediately.\n\n*Open another new Finder window. Is this Finder window too wide?\n\n\n*\n\n*If yes:\n\n\n*\n\n*drag the lower right corner to the left to make the window the width you want.\n\n*close the window immediately.\n\n*open a new Finder window again.\n\n\n*If no:\n\n\n\n*you don’t need to do anything else.\n\n\n\n\nThis seems to have permanently fixed the problem for me.\n\nA: ... or you could use xtrafinder (http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/)\n", "Q: I want to use an iPhone5 S bought in the US in India I bought an iPhone 5S from the US. It is unlocked. In India I am unable to use it with the local (Indian) service provider. When I insert a nano sim card, I am getting an error msg: \"activation required\".\nPlease explain how I could use it with local GSM service provider.\n\nA: If I remember correctly, the \"unlocked\" iPhone 5S sold in the US is really unlocked for use on TMO or AT&T.  This means you need to activate it with one of those two carriers before it can be used with another carrier's SIM card.  I'd contact Apple to verify and see if they can do anything to help out since you're no longer in the US.\n", "Q: How to update or downgrade my iPad 3 that has a jailbreak?

I'm considering buying a external monitor for better gaming (might be a BenQ, has to be 120Hz). My questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does a 2nd monitor affect CPU performance?\n\n*If I buy a good monitor, is there only the latency from the monitor, or is there also other latency? (Some monitors have latency of 1ms, 5ms, which is quite good, and not a problem, but if there's more latency because it isn't my primary screen or something, I need to reconsider).\n\n\nThank you \nEDIT:\nAnd, I've also heard people say that it's useless to connect a 120Hz monitor to a MacBook because the videocard is only able to handle 60Hz. Any confirmation? (Hopefully not)\n\nA: The GPU on your MacBook Pro will be driving two displays, which is a lot of pixels — gaming performance will definitely be affected by the addition of the second display. You'll probably have to drop the resolution of your games to get an adequate framerate.\nAs for the latency question, a wired second display won't have additional latency just because it's a second display.\n\nA: If you are worried about performance you could just close the lid for the duration of gaming :) (That's what I do)\nOtherwise as already stated Eric, yes it does have an impact on performance, but unless someone with your exact setup shows up and tells you how much of an impact it has we're all just guessing.\n", "Q: iTunes insists on erasing my iPhone I have an iPhone that was synced to an iTunes library. Then I upgraded my Mac, and forgot to backup the iTunes library and transfer it to the new Mac. Ever since, I have been manually managing my music by dragging and dropping it from the filesystem onto iTunes, and not \"syncing\".\nAnd things have been working fine for the past few years. But now, after yet another Mac upgrade, and upgrading to iTunes 11, I can no longer manually manage my music on my iPhone. When I try to turn on \"manually manage music and videos\", iTunes says:\nThe iPhone “kPhone” is synced with another iTunes library on “kart's macbook”. Do you want to erase this iPhone and sync with this iTunes library?\nI don't want to erase the whole phone -- apps, app data, app settings, synced data in apps, videos, books, etc. I just want to copy music onto the iPhone. I have already deleted the music that's already on the iPhone. How do I copy music?\n\nA: I just ran into the same problem. Here's the solution:\nThere are \"iPhone Managers\" that Apple does not promote using but it works 100%. These \"iPhone Managers\" (the names I'll give you in a second) allow you to transfer your CONTACTS, MUSIC, APPS, APP DATA, APP SETTINGS, PHOTOS & VIDEOS and a LOT more to your Mac or Windows computer. \nAfter you transfer whatever it is you want to keep a backup of to your Mac in a nicely labeled folder on your desktop (just in case the iTunes Manual Backup doesn't keep some of your settings or pictures, contacts, etc.), you can then ERASE AND SYNC and transfer everything from the folder you made on your desktop with all of your files and transfer it back.\nThis is the only way I know and am doing it as we speak.\nI tried posting links but since I'm new it won't let me. You can try these names:\n\n\n*\n\n*CopyTrans\n\n*iFunBox for Mac\n\n*FileApp\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: How can I increase text size in single-user mode? I spend a lot of time in single-user mode on our company Macs as part of my maintenance and OS mass-deployment work.  We recently made our first foray into Retina display territory by purchasing some of the new MBPs: MacBook Pro Core i7 2.6Ghz 15-Inch (Dual Graphics - Late 2013 Retina Display), a.k.a. MacBookPro11,3.\nWhen booting into single-user mode (Command-S) on these Retina display Macs, the text is ultra tiny -- I'm guessing because of the high pixel density of the display.  My eyes are pretty decent, but I still find myself having to use a magnifying glass just to see what I'm typing.  The font size used for the text is just ridiculously small.\nIs there a command I can run to increase the text size, decrease the resolution, adjust the DPI, or otherwise \"blow up\" the text to a legible size in any way?\n\nA: \nThis is going to be your experience with Single User mode until Apple rewrites the underlying code to allow it to understand what retina is.\nPhoto courtesy of Bev Sykes\n\nA: I know this is really old but I thought I might share the answer with y'all. The way Apple implements characters in the boot video mode is in pixels. There is an array of 0s and 1s that correspond to white and black respectively. Now since the Retina display has such high resolution, the density of those pixels will have a direct coincide with the size of the characters. For example, this is the implementation of capital A:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nI hope this answers your question, and as joshfindit said, Apple would need to redesign the boot video mode if they were to fix this.\n\nA: Do you really need single-user mode? If so, why?\nYou should be able to use the Recovery partition to do much of the same, and possibly also dump the contents of that partition to make it PXE bootable for other Macs on your local LAN...\nI tried some tricks by setting NVRAM boot-args instead of booting into single-user mode the usual way. There is the known kernel boot option:\n\"Graphics Mode\"=\"<width>x<height>x<depth>@<frequency>\"\n\nbut it doesn't seem to effect console mode. See http://www.tonymacx86.com/wiki/index.php/Org.chameleon.Boot.plist#System_Boot_Options for more info on boot-args\nI couldn't find any command-line tools to set the resolution either, or even how to magnify the text (though this might be possible). There is virtually no information online about how to set Darwin's framebuffer resolution. You might find some related code on http://opensource.apple.com if you poked around enough. You could also try to patch the console mode display driver in OS X (probably XNU?) to handle this, or look at alternative boot loaders like Chameleon.\nYou may also be able to rewrite the EDID presented from your monitor to the Mac to make console mode use a lower resolution. This would require flashing the firmware of your display.\n", "Q: Mail on OS X: Choose which X.509 certificate to use for signing mails I've got multiple X.509 certificates from different CA's for different purposes -- for example, one from CAcert.org, and another one from my university. Both have different advantages and disadvantages, and I want to decide which one to use in a by-case manner.\nSadly, I cannot find any preferences, not even for selecting a default. In the account settings there is an option for a TLS certificate, but this is only for authentication against the mail servers. How to either\n\n\n*\n\n*select a key/certificate when composing an email (preferred) or\n\n*select a default certificate per mail address or give some certificate ranking?\n\n\nCurrently my only option is removing the one I don't want to use which is rather frustrating.\n\nA: Apple Mail will detect the signing certificate stored in your login keychain and associate it with the account in Apple Mail that is using the same email address specified in the certificate's RFC 822 Name field. Unfortunately, this is an automatic process and you will not be able to select between different signing certificates in Apple Mail.\nOutlook 2011 does allow you to select which signing certificate you want to use. Here's how to access this functionality:\nA. Open Outlook 2011.\nB. Go into the Outlook preferences\nC. In the Outlook preferences, select Accounts.\n\nD. In your email account settings, select Advanced...\n\nE. In the Advanced settings, select the Security tab. If your signing certificate is stored in your login keychain, you can select your certificate here.\n\n\nA: You can exactly specify the certificate to be used for sining outgoing emails by following these steps:\nOpen your keychain. Then right click on the list of certificates and pick the first item on the context menu (In English it is labeled New Identity Preference):\n\nThen type in your email address and select the certificate from the drop down box to use for that address:\n\nThe next email you send from the email address typed in above will be signed with the selected certificate.\n", "Q: How is font metadata stored?

It allows you to search all the visible GUI element and select it from your keyboard input.\nAnother tool you can use to simulate mouse event (such as right click) is Keyboard Maestro. It’s an app to create macro for all kind of events in Mac (from simulating keystrokes, mouse position, and even manipulating clipboard history).

A mailbox with hundreds of messages in it suddenly has only the latest added message. Then it will show only messages added since that message. \nI have tried mailbox Rebuild, re-checking mail, close Mail and open it again. Nothing seems to help. The messages in the Mail mailbox don't match what's in the filter by label on the web interface.\nIs there a way to force Mail to re-synchronize a single Mail mailbox (to a GMail label) without deleting the entire account and spending another day or two rebuilding the whole database?\nA related question asks about messages in Mail (inbox) that are not in GMail (inbox). This question is the reverse, messages in GMail (archived label) that are not in Mail (mailbox). The answer may or may not be the same!\nNOTE: After 5 days of daily use, the mailbox has just restored itself. That's a long time to wait! Unfortunately, for the time being (until I detect a recurrence of the problem) it will be difficult for me to evaluate the effectiveness of solutions offered.\n\nA: If it happens again, try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click any Gmail folder that is missing messages and select \"Get Account Info\". \n\n\nThis forces Mail to search through the entire Gmail account for messages and will restore missing messages in all folders for that account.\nThe missing mail problem occurred for me when I upgraded from Mountain Lion to Mavericks 10.9.1 with Mail 7.1 (1827). I had unsuccessfully tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*clicking \"Get new messages in all accounts\"\n\n*synchronising the mailbox\n\n*taking the account offline and then back online\n\n*rebuilding the mailboxes\n\n*un-enabling the account, restarting Mail and then re-enabling the account.\n\n\nOnly getting the account info solved the problem for me.\n\nA: *\n\n*In Gmail, go to your Labels settings and on the \"All Mail\" line, uncheck \"Show in IMAP\".\n\n*Relaunch Mail, missing messages will repopulate.\n\n\nNote on mail archiving:\n\n\n*\n\n*When \"All Mail\" is shown in IMAP, the Archive for that account is the \"All Mail\" which includes non-archived content, which is part of the problem.\n\n*With \"All Mail\" not shown in IMAP, using the Archive feature in Apple Mail will move messages to a gmail label, \"[IMAP]/Archive\"\n\n*If you want all previous archived messages to be moved into this new Archive folder you need to search in Gmail for has:nouserlabels -label:inbox and move old conversations to the \"[IMAP]/Archive\" label. However this search will include conversations that have some of the messages still in the inbox or some other label. So be careful.\n\nA: Go to Mail's menu bar and choose Mailbox > Synchronize > [The mailbox you want to synchronize].\nThis will sync the chosen mailbox with the server to get folders and emails to match those on the server.\nIf you still don't see emails you're able to see in Gmail's web interface then Mail 7 still has some troubles syncing correctly.

However, this may not be supported or available on all packages (depending on how the package was built). From the installer man page:\nThe customLocation attribute can be set for a choice only if that choice\nexplicitly allows a user-defined path. That is, if the choice would have a\nLocation popup when viewed in the Customize pane of the Installer application, it \ncan be set via customLocation.  (Otherwise, installation paths cannot be \narbitrarily modified, since the package author must account for custom install \nlocations for the installation to work properly.)\n\nFrom what I can see, the iPhoneSimulatorSDK6_1.pkg that you're referencing does not support this option. However, it is still possible to perform the relocation of the installer package payload after installation:\nsudo installer -pkg /Volumes/Bittersweet6M149.iPhoneSimulatorSDK6_1/iPhoneSimulatorSDK6_1.pkg -tgt /\nsudo mv /Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator6.1.sdk /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator/Developer/SDKs\n\nAlternately, you can use pkgutil to expand the package, cpio to extract the payload, and mvto put the SDK into place:\npkgutil --expand /Volumes/Bittersweet6M149.iPhoneSimulatorSDK6_1/iPhoneSimulatorSDK6_1.pkg ~/iPhoneSimulator6_1\ncd ~/iPhoneSimulator6_1\ncpio -i -I ~/iPhoneSimulator6_1/Payload\nsudo mv Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator6.1.sdk /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator/Developer/SDKs\n\nI'm not sure exactly how Xcode places the simulators/SDKs into the correct location.

Is there any way to know ahead of time which paid apps are going free, or does Apples RSS feed actually contain data for apps that have just gone free \"today\" ?\n\nA: There are a lot of Apps which provide a daily list of free Apps. These kind of companies base their business in agreements with the developers, who pay for their Apps to be featured on these App-of-the-Day lists.\nSo, the Company makes it's business, the Developer's App get notoriety and publicity, which means that on the long shot more people will download the App once it's paid again and the user gets to get free Apps daily.

What are the risks of buying a Mac whose serial number has been shared on the Internet?\n\nA: If you have AppleCare phone support, one could, in theory, use your serial number to contact AppleCare for free support.  Otherwise, there's no risk to sharing a serial number when selling your Mac.\n\nA: I'm unaware of any risks to the owner directly, but of course the serial number is a unique number that identifies that particular Mac.\nFraudsters are very creative, and it's possible that they could find ways to use the serial, either by pretending to be the owner (e.g. selling a Mac they don't have); or by pretending to be Apple. \"Are you the owner of xxxxxx?

I'm kinda interested in using the Dvorak layout (if nothing else, people won't want to steal my machine as much), but it drives me insane that tapping a key types a different character than is written on the key. Is there a way to remove & rearrange the keycaps on an 09 MacBook Pro? What do I need to watch out for?\n\nA: Rather than explaining it myself through text and possibly sounding confusing, I'll just link this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh88cn_rtLo\nI've popped off keys before in the same way he did, and it works just fine. Obviously for rearranging your keys in a Dvorak layout, you'll want to pull up a reference image on screen of what a Dvorak keyboard looks like, in case you haven't memorized it. And then just pop all the keys off, put the mechanism parts that go under the keys back on, and then put the actual keys on in the proper arrangement.\nAnd it sounds like you've already switched your system input layout to Dvorak, but in case you haven't, it's really simple. Just go into System Preferences, then to Language & Text, then the Input Sources tab, and check Dvorak. Then check \"Show Input menu in menu bar\" and in the menubar you should see a new icon, and it should be the flag of your country keyboard layout if you haven't changed it before. Click that and you should be able to select Dvorak.\n\nA: I did this a few years ago. There's a helpful post with instructions on https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2030850?tstart=0\nI didn't have any issues getting the keys back on after they popped out, but it can be finicky and definitely requires some patience.\nThe only thing to watch out for, which particularly annoyed me, was that you can choose to move 'f' and 'j' to their new positions, but then the detents marking the \"home row\" will be incorrectly placed. On a newer laptop, I left those two keys and their counterparts in the  incorrect positions. On my older MBP, I actually taped small fragments of pencil lead to the new home rows keys 'u' and 'h' to provide some tactile feedback.\n\nA: I've done a similar procedure for a family member's MBP, and it was surprisingly easy to remove and replace the keys. A few guidance points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take the key off from the top/bottom, not the sides.\nIt's much easier to remove the key by prying it from the top/bottom than the sides. Start at the bottom-left or top-left corner, lifting the key cap slightly, then push the mechanism inwards, freeing the key. Then simply pry the mechanism out of the key cap and clip it back into the keyboard. Repeat until you end up with a bunch of key caps, which you can place anywhere.\n\n*Be careful not to damage the silicon membrane.\nDon't go too far under the key - doing so could damage the membrane, making the key non-functional!\n\n*Use a plastic tool over a metal one if possible.\nA metal tool could scratch the key cap, making more backlight shine through the side of the key, which could end up being slightly annoying!\n\nA: I'd suggest not doing it. I have tried rearranging the keycaps on two different laptops, and I damaged some of the keys both times. The replacement parts cost something like 50-100 USD. If you sell the laptop, you'll have to swap the keys again, and some of them might be damaged again.\nThe QWERTY labels might be useful if you actually forget the QWERTY layout at some point.\nIf you decide to swap the keys, see http://www.thebookyard.com/images/manuals/keyreplace.pdf. Most of it applies to newer keyboards as well.\n\n", "Q: Hidden login script I have a bash shell script that runs on login.

I've found others seem to be having trouble elsewhere on the interwebs. You can see their adventures here. \nNow, I've since contacted Apple Support and chatted with a rep there and so far things seem to be working better. However, I'm not going to call this one case closed and will not add an answer just yet. \nHere's what's happened: \nChatted with rep and he had me delete the SystemConfiguration folder from /Library/Preferences and reboot my machine. \nThen he said I was on my own and to keep an eye on it, essentially. He was very nice and had the same first name as mine so when he emailed me the chat log it looks like I'm talking to myself. \nNot wanting to wait for resolution, I decided to try some testing myself. \nFirst I set my hibernation time to a very low number: \nsudo pmset -b standbydelay 15\n\nThen I slept the machine and let it sit for a while. Typically it would have started the waking thing after 15 seconds when it tried to hibernate. This did not happen. I've actually gotten this to work many times in a row. \nI will point out, and I'm not sure if it means anything, but when I first changed my standbydelay I got warnings from pmset that said: Display sleep should be lower than system sleep. \nI looks at pmset -g and it says that displaysleep was set to 2 while sleep was set to 1. Moreover, after sleep 1 it said (sleep prevented by apsd, apsd). I changed my system sleep and display sleep to make pmset happy and afterward ran pmset -g again and found that the (sleep prevented by apsd, apsd) note was gone from the sleep line. I'm not sure that this is relevant, but I want it known is it's not something I can simply explain. \nI will update this after I've used the machine for a while and can say with any confidence that the problem is resolved so that anyone stumbling over this in the future will have more tools at their disposal.\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue with my MacBook Pro, with XQuartz installed too (to use Wireshark).\nThe issue never happened until I started Wireshark the first time with XQuartz. Maybe it could be the cause of the issue.\nI removed XQuartz but the issue continues to remain. It happen not all the time but sometimes the issues appears again. Apple support have absolutely no idea why it happens and they proposed me to format disk and reinstall OS X. This would be a solution for a Windows operating system... for now they don't really want to investigate this issue as I can see (even if there are more people having it with different types of MAC products...). It looks clearly like a bug in OS X\nI try to analyse which processes are running when issue happens in order to determine which one could be involved\nWait and see...\n\nA: Uninstalling Avast solved the issue. It's not a good solution but for now it works. I don't think Avast is the cause of the problem but coupled with XQuartz it could have triggered something nasty in OS X.\nApple technical support told me to wait on next system updates, maybe they have found something. I hope so :)\n", "Q: On OS X Mavericks, why does it always say my memory used is like 99% of my total memory?

(If you don't see the Groups panel, which starts with \"All Contacts,\" on the left side of the window, choose View > Show Groups from the menu.)\n\n*Click the first contact on the contacts list.\n\n*Choose Edit > Select All from the menu. Ensure that the card detail area on the right shows how many cards have been selected (e.g., \"612 Cards Selected\").\n\n*Choose File > Export > Export vCard...\n\n*Enter the desired export filename and location, and click Save.\n\n\nYou will now have a single .vcf file with all of your contacts. This is a text file which you can open with TextEdit. You may also find tools that convert .vcf to other formats, such as .csv, if you need it.\nThis .vcf file can be used to restore your contacts or migrate them to other devices.\n\nA: If you have iWorks/Numbers installed, check the tutorial:\n\nHow to Convert an Address Book ABBU File to CSV\nABBU is the native file type for the Mac OS X Address Book, which means that you can only open ABBU files using the Mac Address Book application. However, you can use the iWork Numbers application to import the ABBU file, and then export the data file to a Comma Separated Value, or CSV, file format, which is a generic text file format that you can import into any address book or database application, regardless of operating system.\n\nAlso you could try the tool:\n\nAB2CSV\nAlso known as Address Book to CSV Exporter, this Mac OS X utility allows the user to export his own Address Book in a CSV or VCF file.\n\nYou did mention \"vs just importing them\", but if you can use the first method to export them to Numbers, you can then save as .CSV.\n\nA: I finally found a rather easy way to read my .abbu directory without importing it into my exising address book: create a new user, open its address book and import the .abbu.\nThis way I could select a couple of strangely lost contacts, export this selection and import it into my exising contacts.\n\nA: I FOUND A SOLUTION to some of the problems laid out here.  \nI had the exact same problem as fish923, I had a .abbu file and every time I tried to import my contacts the Contacts app synced with iCloud and erased all contacts.  \nTo restore your backup successfully you need to do this:  \n1.- Disconnect from the internet.\n2.- go to your user AddressBook folder inside your Library folder:   Users/(your user)/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/…\n3.- Delete contents inside AddressBook folder (or move them to the Desktop just in case)\n4.- Right click on your .abbu file and select “Show Package Contents”.\n5.- Copy contents from your .abbu file to the AddressBook Folder.\n6.- Open Contacts app and export all contacts as vCard (make sure you select all contacts for export).\n7.- Now you can connect to the internet, the Contacts app will sync with iCloud and again remove all your contacts but don't worry, you can now import the form de vCard file.  \nThis worked for me. Hope it helps somebody.\n\nA: There is a way to access directly to the data saved within a .abbu (Address Book Backup) directory.\nLet's say you saved your address book as proposed by default with the name\nContacts - DD-MM-YYYY.abbu.\nYou will have to use the command line for this with:\ncd 'Contacts - DD-MM-YYYY.abbu/Metadata'\nplutil -convert xml1 *\n\nIf you want to work directly on these plist files,\nand later use them within your addess book,\nI advise to first test this on a test account, let's say Bob.\nWithin Bob test account, you will have to bring the .abbu in place\nof the Library/Application Support/AddressBook:\n/usr/bin/sudo cp -r 'Contacts - DD-MM-YYYY.abbu/' '/Users/bob/Library/Application Support/AddressBook'\n\n# the / after .abbu directory name is mandatory to copy the contents\n# in the destination directory, this will overwrite the address book\n# of Bob\n\n/usr/bin/sudo rm '/Users/Bob/Library/Application Support/AdressBook/AddressBook-v22.abcddb'\n\n# the removal of this `.db` will force `Contacts` to rebuild it from\n# the contents of the `Metadata` directory.\n\n/usr/bin/sudo chown -R bob '/Users/bob/Library/Application Support/AddressBook'\n\n\nWarning: don't copy and paste the above commands if you don't fully\n  understand what they do.

I have noticed that a very large chunk of the space is taken up by the Messages app. I believe this is due to the tons of MMS messages I've sent and received over the years. I would like to easily delete all MMS messages (pictures/videos) without deleting any conversations and without having to manually find and delete each one. Is this possible?\n\nA: On iOS 7, in the conversation window, if you hold on a message balloon you get the context menu with two options: Copy and More.\nWhen you tap More, you will get into the edit screen where you can select and delete individual messages.\n\nA: go to settings, then messages, then scroll down to mms messaging and turn off.\n", "Q: Xcode and iOS SDK in iPad Air I am a web developer looking to get started with apps for iPhone and iPad.\nI have only an iPad Air 16GB. Can I install Xcode 5 and iOS SDK in the iPad for testing, while I code using a Windows PC?\n\nA: You cannot install Xcode on iPad Air. You need to have a Mac to develop for iOS devices using Xcode and iOS SDK.\n\nA: You can, but you'll need an OS X machine running and connected to the Internet in order to compile the builds for your iPad.\nThis is exactly how the Dringend app works.  It runs on your iPad as a slimmed-down 3rd-party Xcode replacement (it even understands .xcodeproj files!), and uses Xcode via a remote OS X host to do the dirty-work.\nI thought I read something somewhere about another start-up working towards a product with the same premise, but provides the OS X build-machines as a paid service— I'll update this if I find their name.  Until then, there's always OS X hosting.\n", "Q: Is it impossible to listen to podcasts on iOS 6 now? I'm on iOS 6 on my iPhone, and I don't like iOS 7.  When I try to listen to a podcast on the iTunes app, it tells me to download the Podcasts app.  When I try to download the Podcasts app, it tells me iOS 7 is required to download the app.  So how can I listen to podcasts, short of upgrading to iOS 7?\n\nA: If you had downloaded the podcasts app while iOS6 was the most recent, then you would have a version of the podcasts app that was compatible with it.  Unfortunately the current version of the podcasts app is written using iOS7 APIs, including ones to automatically download content for  you without you having to manually open the app etc, which are not backwards compatible.\nAs such, you will have to use a 3rd party app to listen to podcasts, or upgrade to iOS7.\n\nA: You can listen to podcasts with the Music app, if you do not want to conform by running iOS7 or run a third party app.\n\nA: I had the same issue. I have an iPhone 3Gs which cannot upgrade beyond iOS 6.1.6. So I cannot download any version of Podcasts.\nAs others already noted, one solution is downloading a third party app. After reading various reviews, I chose Downcast which works very well.\nPersonally, I think it is very strange that Apple themselves are actively preventing using their own app.\n\nA: Maybe this wasn't operational right away, but I just now (December 9, 2014) downloaded the Apple Podcast app on my ios 6 iPhone 3gs from the App Store. I was prompted that it requires iOS 7 or later, BUT if I clicked Download, it would download the \"latest compatible version\" to my iOS. I clicked download, and voila! And yes, it works.\n\nA: I have an iPod Touch 4 with IOS 6.1.6.  I followed the instructions on the link https://sites.google.com/site/appleclubfhs/support/advice-and-articles/app-store-downloading-older-versions-of-apps-ios and now have a fully functional version of 'Podcasts'.\nIn my case when I initially tried to download Podcasts from the App Store with iPod Touch, it advised that I needed IOS 7 and there was no option to install an older version. However as outlined in link above, I downloaded the Podcasts app in iTunes and then synced my iPod with iTunes. Then I went back into the iPod App Store and tried to download it. This time it still advised that I needed IOS 7, however it also gave me an option to download a version compatible with IOS 6.\nSo, the bottom line here is that Podcasts has a compatible version for IOS 6 in App Store, but Apple does not advert this to users (unless you already have it installed on your iPod) and make it very hard to get. In my case it’s taken me 2 hours of time to solve this problem.\nPodcasts are my main use of this perfectly functional device and so getting support for this App was personally very important to me. I hope this helps other users.\n\nA: Assuming you do not have access to a newer device (Andrea's Answer), here's a free workaround.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the podcast episodes on your desktop computer using itunes.\n\n*Add them to a playlist. (Optional, this preserves the order of the episodes and makes it easy to sync)\n\n*Select the episodes and right click > Get Info > Options > Media Kind > Music.\n\n*Now you may sync the playlist / \"Songs\" normally.\n\n\nWarning: Doing this will remove the episodes from the podcast list. You can switch them back to the podcast media kind, but in my experience the episodes won't necessarily reappear in the podcast list and their order may not be preserved.\n", "Q: Yet Another Custom Sidebar Icon Question (System Info.plist Question) I have perused just about every Google search I could think of and have gotten what I think seems to be close to an answer on how to set custom icons in the sidebar WITHOUT having to resort to Dropbox's mach_inject hackery, but I have a few questions and I'm stumped.  My main question is: Can you set a 'type' to a folder?  The reason is ask is because when going into /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents there is an Info.plist file.  This file shows icon associations for system folders.  Before delving into sidebar icons though, firstly, I'd like to know how the 'regular' icons are associated to the system folders.  I'll use the 'Documents' folder as an example.  I can see under Document Types in this Info.plist file, Item 155 is for the Documents folder, and it explains that the icon that should be associated to the Documents folder should be DocumentsFolderIcon.icns.  It also indicates that the 'Document OS Type' is a 4-character type, named 'docs'.\n\nIs it safe to assume that if I created a New Folder, I could somehow edit either an extended attribute or some sort of metadata that declares my new folder to be of type 'docs' which will cause Finder to display the DocumentsFolderIcon.icns for it?  How can I modify my folder 'type' like that?\nFurthermore, in the same Info.plist file, it explains the sidebar icons.  The dictionary for Item 10 (the Documents sidebar icon) explains that the Document OS Type of 'sbDc' will display the SidebarDocumentsFolder.icns.  Again, with my newly created folder, can I somehow edit an attribute or metadata to indicate that the sidebar type should be 'sbDc' instead of the default 'sbFd' (which is for the Generic Folder icon).\n\nBeing able to modify those attributes on my new folder in that way can provide me with a proof of concept to get custom sidebar icons without requiring mach_inject tricks, and allow me to be able to create new folders that act as if they were system generated folders with their own custom sidebar icons and everything.\n(I know there is ANOTHER file in /Library/Preferences named com.apple.sidebarlists.plist, but I'm confused, because for the Documents folder definition, it indicates a decimal number for com.apple.LSSharedFileList.TemplateSystemSelector which, when converted to hex, then to ASCII, spell out 'sbDt' and NOT 'sbDc' which is listed in the system Info.plist file as Documents sidebar type ) --EDIT-- Actually, I modified that in an attempt to make a change to see what happens; the decimal number that's originally set for Documents by default is in fact 1,935,819,875, which translates to 'sbDc' in ASCII.  (The following screenshot has my change in it.)\n\nSo just to recap, how can I modify the attributes, metadata, or whatever it's called, on a newly created folder to declare it of type 'docs' instead of type 'fldr, fold, utif, or aexf' so that instead of the generic folder icon, it displays the Documents folder icon?\nAgain, I know this has been beaten to death, I just feel like I am so close to being able to set custom icons and sidebar icons without having to resort to code injections...\nThanks in advance!\n--Just one extra note about 'regular' custom icons (not sidebar icons):  I know how to set a custom icon for a folder using conventional methods, but when you select an image using preview and then 'Get Info' on your folder and paste your image in the upper left corner to set the icon, the size on disk for your folder changes...which is not how system folders have their icons set.  System folders must be associating their icons by that 4-character type somehow and I'm trying to do the same with my own custom folder.--\nUPDATE\nTobias' answer (see his answer below) seems to be on the right path, but I can't for the life of me find what file connects a path to an icon.  I've tried searching every file on my computer for the string '/Sites' using Terminal.  If you create a 'Sites' folder in your 'home' folder, it will get a special icon with a Safari logo on it, but if you create a 'Sites' folder on say, your Desktop, it will get a generic folder icon.  So path discrimination is definitely going on, thanks Tobias!  For some reason 'Sites' is special and leftover from older versions of OS X I believe or intended for web developers (although, curiously, it does not get a special Sidebar icon, it still gets a generic folder icon on the Sidebar).  Could anyone explain how and why the Sites folder is so special?  Emphasis on the how, lol.\n\nA: If you are simply trying to change the default icon to something else, here is an answer I provided for a previous post. I have used this to customize several icons in the Finder's sidebar.\n\nA: You assume, that there has to be a property on the file/folder for it's special icon treatment.\nUsing the Terminal and ls -l@e shows all extended attribute keys and the Access Control List (ACL) associated with the file/folder. The only thing special about the special folders is, that the ACL states 0: group:everyone deny delete. A copy with cp -a, which retains everything including extended attribute keys and the ACL, does not retain the special icon.\nSo there is no property on the file/folder.\nInstead, Finder treats these folders differently all on it's own.\nIt does this simply by path discrimination. Use sudo mv to verify this. \n\nAdditional notes\n\n\n*\n\n*Name localization is done by a .localized file inside the folder.\n\n*Custom icons result in an attribute\ncom.apple.FinderInfo      32\n\nin the folder and the special file\n-rw-r--r--@  1 <user> <group> 0 <dd> <mmm> <yyyy> Icon?\n    com.apple.FinderInfo         32 \n    com.apple.ResourceFork   202364 \n\ninside the folder.\n\nNext step: Search for something which connects paths to their Document OS Type. Hopefully it is an easily accessible .plist or something.\n", "Q: Serious Boot / Sleep Problems Two days ays ago I closed the lid of my macbook pre for the night as I have done for the last 2.5 years but when I opened the lid in the morning the screen didn't show. It seemed to be 'alive' (ish) i.e. the volume buttons made a clicking sound but when I tried to do a restart with keyboard shortcut there was no response so I had to shut down with the power button. \nWhen I tried to start up again it got stuck on a grey screen with the laptop running hot. I powered off again and tried to boot recovery partition but got a scrambled blue screen with that. Tried to boot bootcamp and got a dead screen like the laptop was off. Tried to boot from a usb blue scrambled screen again.\nI reset smc, pram etc. but nothing made a difference.\nAfter trying the various boot options a few times of these I plugged in the power cable and all of a sudden I was able to boot into OS. Problem was that if the laptop went asleep the same thing would happen again and only after numerous restart attempts would it boot but once up and running no issues.\nPossibly unrelated but maybe not, today all of a sudden the laptop got really hot so I loaded activity monitor to see what was going on but I couldn't open it as it kept hanging. Two restarts later and the problem disappeared.\nUnfortunately the boot issue and the dead OS after sleep remains an issue, any ideas whats going on?\nA few details on my setup - I'm running an early 2011 MBP with OS 10.9, I have 16GB RAM, a Crucial M4 SSD and the original HD in an optibay in place of the superdrive.\n\nA: That is a tough one and some of the symptoms seem to indicate hardware issues but the fact that it came back to life may put the lie to that conjecture. Since you already reset the SMC that is also out. More troubleshooting steps around power issues (including resetting the SMC) in the Apple KB here:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\nSome of (all?) of these steps may be redundant depending on what all you have done.\nIt sounds like there may be a software issue as well. I use Onyx for general system maintenance and have found it works well and causes no problems. That may be worth a shot.\nHowever once you have gone through that and the issue still remains you may have an intermittent hardware issue.\nIf you have upgraded the RAM yourself, you can try removing the DIMM you installed. Same for any HD/SSD upgrades you may have done yourself.\nFailing that it may be time for a visit to your local Genius bar...\n", "Q: Jaibroken iPhone sms.db file not updating right away (sms.db-wal) I am developing my own \"back up sms system\", so my sms.db is backed up few times in a day (whenever I use SBStoggle button to make a backup).\nI've encountered a problem with sms.db-wal not passing data to sms.db right away, it stores newest SMS/iMessages for how long (? - assumed once per day or once in 30hrs) and after while it passes data to the sms.db file.\nIs there any way to force this process?\nI've found threads about this on MacForums but no answer there, I've looked in iphonewikipedia there is nothing to use either.\n(I am looking for a command)\nthanks for any comments or suggestions\n\nA: Whenever connection to sms.db closes all data from sms.db-wal are synced to sms.db.\nEasiest workaround is to copy all 3files\nsms.db, sms.db-wal and sms.db-sch into \"desired folder\" an run any kind of action with sqlite3 command (output it into /dev/null) after this session closes data are synced into sms.db\n", "Q: Encrypting using FileVault on an Apple original SSD - any likely problems? There are plenty of FileVault 2 and SSD (Solid State Disk) questions on many forums, and a few already on this site, but this is more specific and I cannot find it even asked - let alone answered:\nIf the disk is a factory fitted, original Apple SSD (in a Macbook in my case) is there any possible down-side to encrypting the disk with FileVault (on Mavericks so I'm assuming version 2!)?\nSure there may be a fractional (unnoticeable) performance overhead but apart from that, are there any disk wear-levelling issues (due to problems with TRIM perhaps)?\nIdeally some documentation from Apple would be the best confirmation... if they have published any that I haven't found.\n\nA: I recently did some research on this topic because I want to install an SSD in my Macbook as well.\nIn my case it would not be a factory fitted one but I doubt that there are big technical differences between original Apple SSDs and custom ones, apart from TRIM being available by default vs. enabling TRIM on my own with a custom SSD.\nThe most satisfying answer I could find was this discussion in the Apple Support Community.\nThe interesting posting basically says that a user tested random sectors on a FileVault2 encrypted SSD and found some that were indeed empty (all zero). In a similar scenario on a classic magnetic HDD no empty sectors were found.\nThe user concludes that this means that unused sectors remain empty on SSDs and that TRIM will correctly work with FileVault2.\nThe conclusion seems reasonable to my understanding and after installing my SSD I personally will use FileVault2 in good conscience.\nHowever, this is not an official answer from Apple and therefore should be treated with care.\n\nA: In my experience I've noticed a drop of SSD speed, about 10mb/sec witch is measurable however not noticeable, except during boot up. a encrypted drive takes longer too boot. however the speeds of an SSD is so fast that its still considerably faster than a HDD!\nI don't know if the following is true however I've read that sense FireVoult 2 encrypts the whole drive as apposed to the home directory it encrypts and decrypts everything as you use it, therefore it uses the disk more. and since a SSD gets slower and shows ware over time, this can have an impact on the long run.\nI have myself not noticed any issues except those mentioned\n", "Q: MacBook booting with wrong keyboard layout I've got a 15-inch MacBook Pro with the latest OS X. Every time I reboot, it resets the keyboard layout to American English even though I set it to Swiss German.

Strangely, a lot of people just seem to want to programmatically select rows, instead of getting selected rows.\nI am certainly close though. I have reached thus far:\nset selectedRows to value of attribute \"AXSelectedRows\" of outline1\n\nwhere outline1 is set to an AXOutline. Next:\nset selectedRow to item 1 of selectedRows\n\nThis is where it becomes a little murky (after already failing to set it to row 1 instead of item 1). I would expect selectedRow to be of type AXRow (or row), but instead Automator output displays:\napplication \"System Events\"\n\nThat is, the item appears to be an instance of 'application \"System Events\"' - which leads me to believe that I'm overlooking something important. Having said that, I feel that I've tried every combination of value's, attribute's and row's - including some type-casting.\nThe frustrating part is that I can actually see the contents of AXSelectedRows in the Accessibility Inspector! And so I know that it exists. As a workaround, I am using:\nset selectedRows to selected of rows of outline1\n\nHowever, this is certainly not preferable as I still have to loop through the entire array in order to find the 'true' values, which could have performance issues for very large lists. \nAny help would be hugely appreciated!\n\nA: I guess getting the value of AXSelectedRows is just something that has not been implemented.

The way that the virtual memory system of Unix works, you'd expect about 10% to show up as \"Free\" in the way Activity Monitor displays memory on a normally running system. (You need a little headroom in order to actually do the tasks of managing memory, so the operating system squirrels that away for this purpose.)\nThe \"Inactive\" number would be a better thing to look at, as it would tell you how much memory is currently unallocated to any process.\n", "Q: iOS Reboot when open .exe file in iDownloader I recently opened my PC Graphic Driver file (.exe) using iDownloader to download that file.\nWhen I tap the \"agreed and Download\" button on Nvidia's website to download, my iPad Air is automatically reboot.\nNow I am afraid this kind of reboots may dammage my iPad Air .\nCan reboot like these cause iPad Air CPU, memory or something damages ?\n\nA: When you say that it automatically rebooted, are you referring to an actual reboot or simply the app crashing back to the home screen?\nThe latter shouldn't cause any problem to your device, however if data was being written in the app, that data could be corrupt. If the device performed a full reboot, and data was being written by the OS, that data could become corrupt, however it is extremely unlikely that this will cause any problems.\niOS, like OS X, can stand being terminated mostly, with circumstances to prevent corrupt files from breaking things.

I know this has been asked many times (Is there a similarly fast alternative to Crtl + Shift + Eject for new Macbook that lack eject keys?) but the hotkey combination does not work on my MacBook Air that has no eject button running 10.7.\nSo, what hotkey combination can I use to lock the screen?\n\nA: Here's something for anyone who, like me, scoured the web for a simple Mac equivalent to \"Windows-L\" to lock the screen, and found that all the solutions either required third-party software you don't want or a special key that doesn't exist on your (generic external) keyboard.  The following worked for me in Mavericks (10.9.3)\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the \"Automator\" application and create a new document of type \"Service\"\n\n*Specify that the service receives \"no input\" in \"any application\"\n\n*Add the \"Run Shell Script\" action to the service\n\n*Paste the following into the \"Run Shell Script\" action's text area: /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine \n\n*Save the service as \"Start ScreenSaver\" and quit Automator\n\n*Launch the \"System Preferences\" application and go to the \"Security\" preference pane\n\n*Under the \"General\" tab, enable \"Require password [immediately] after sleep or screen saver begins\"\n\n*Now go to the \"Keyboard\" preference pane, \"Shortcuts\" tab, \"Services\" list item, and find your \"Start ScreenSaver\" service under \"General\" near the bottom of the list on the right, and double-click it.\n\n*Press your chosen keyboard shortcut (I like control + option + command + L, so I can just mash all three modifier keys together and hit L for lock)\n\n\nEDIT: I had trouble after an upgrade to OSX El Capitan.  I was using the more-succinct AppleScript content:\nactivate application \"ScreenSaverEngine\"\n\nwhich I thought should have been more future-proof than the shell-script incantation of step 4, but the first time I used it, it claimed to be unable to find ScreenSaverEngine.  This was fixed after I started ScreenSaverEngine.app once explicitly from the command-line:\nopen /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app\n\n\nA: Edit: pressing the power key on a MacBook Air while holding control and shift does not work in 10.7. The power key can only be substituted for eject in 10.8 and later versions of OS X.\nPutting displays to sleep only locks the screen if this setting is enabled:\n\nYou can also put displays to sleep in 10.9 by running pmset displaysleepnow.\nAnother way to lock the screen is to enable the Keychain menu extra from the preferences of Keychain Access and then select Lock Screen from the menu extra:\n\nAn alternative way to lock the screen is to log out to the fast user switching screen. You can do it by running\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\n\nor by using the lock action in Alfred:\n\n\nA: MacBook Air replaces eject button with power button. Use this instead:\nUpdate 2013-11-23: I apologize for not reading the question carefully. I missed the part where you want to actually lock the screen. The combination key below only turn off the screen without actually locking it.\nControl+Shift+Power/Eject Button\nIf you want to enter sleep mode (where you also lock the screen), the answer provided above is correct. The combination key to enter sleep mode is:\nOption+Command+Power/Eject Button\n\nA: I set up my screen saver with a \"hot corner\" in System Preferences (so that the screen saver starts when I move my mouse into the corner).  This in combination with setting the security for password to be \"immediately\" required, means that you have a simple way to lock the screen.\n\nA: I simply set security to ask for password immediately on sleep, and use the power/sleep button to lock my MBA (OS X Yosemite).\n\nA: Go to settings, Security & Privacy, General then set password \"immediately\"\nAfter setting that, you may now use the shift+control+power button for mac book air. \nIt will be put to sleep mode or lock screen then when you need to use it again, it will ask for password. \n", "Q: Sync mail account settings in Mavericks I have several IMAP email accounts that I use in Mac Mail. I want to sync those \"account settings\" across to my iDevices (all on iOS 7). I don't want to enter these accounts manually on each device.  There use to be a panel in iTunes called 'info' that allowed this but is missing in iTunes 11.3.1. What is the new methodology?  \nI notice in Mac Mail that there is an option under the Mail menu to \"Synchronize all accounts\" which seems hopeful but even if it is pushing account settings to the iCloud then I am still not knowing how to get them to come down to my iDevices.\n\nA: To sync accounts between devices and workstations, you should investigate iCloud Keychain Sync. In addition to syncing keychains (as expected) it will also sync any \"Internet Accounts\" across devices bound to the same iCloud account. This includes (in my case) two Macs, one Hac, an iPhone 5 and iPad 3rd Generation (WiFi).\nThe command to \"Synchronize all accounts\" actually is performing an IMAP folder sync operation across all active accounts, not synchronizing account settings.\nAdditionally, if you use MFA (multi-factor authentication) via an \"application password\" generated by your service provider, iCloud Keychain Sync will sync the same password credential between your devices. May be best to revoke them all and issue a new one, or pick one from the device you are starting with, and revoke the rest upon completion. \n\nSidebar: I recommend doing this one device at a time because you may end up with duplicate accounts on some devices while it propagates. You cannot selectively sync account information to only some devices without also losing Keychain Sync, but you can enable/disable \"Internet Accounts\" selectively on a device after it arrives there.\n  Bonus -- if you use MFA, you can use invalid passwords to help you identify which accounts are new and which accounts are old. e.g. once you expire test@test.com/iPad for your \"Test.com IMAP\" account, if you have two \"Test.com IMAP\" accounts, the one that isn't disabled from a failed login is the one that iCloud Keychain sync gave you.\n\n\nA: The change is not iTunes, it is Mavericks. As explained at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5847 older versions of MacOS have a subsystem called SyncServices that handles synchronization of many types of data including mail account settings between various consumers, including (via iTunes) iOS devices. Apple even includes it in iTunes 11 for Windows, but it is gone in Mavericks. It was replaced in parts by the Internet Accounts subsystem exposed in System Preferences, which will sync accounts via iCloud between Macs, but for some reason they have not extended that to iTunes and iOS. Perhaps because it is VERY buggy. \n\nA: There have been a lot of issues with Mail.app after ML came out. I found the best option is to use an alternative app (such as Mail Pilot; what I've been using). After installing it on all of my Apple devices (rMBP, iPhone, iPad, et cetera); my mail is properly synced across all of them. As for an actual solution; waiting for Apple to provide for a patch to the error is probably the most straightforward answer. I would implore you to check Mail Pilot, or any other third-party Mail application in the mean time. The problem will be solved the instance you import your mail accounts.\n", "Q: Google Calendar set up failed I was trying to set up Google Calendar on my new Mac. After following the steps from this Google support article, I ran into this absolutely useless error message:\n\nAny ideas how to fix it?\n\nA: While setting up the Calendar, when my wifi was disconnected I got the same message. Then I used my 3G modem for fast and continuous connection. It resolved the issue.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro froze and rebooted into Recovery HD My MacBook Pro was working fine this afternoon and after I came back from class in the evening, when I on the laptop, the white page just froze there for around 2 mins and I'm directed to a page asking me to select language. I chose English and it came to the OS X Utilities page where I'm given option to choose to restore, reinstall new OS X Lion, Disc Utility, and search for help online.\nI've tried to reinstall it but it showed that my hard drive is locked. Does anyone knows what happened? There's no nearby Apple Store for me to take my Mac to.\n\nA: In my experience a locked (read-only) disk in OS X means one of two things: An incompatible filesystem (Like Windows NTFS) or a dying drive. Yours is certainly not the former and likely the latter.\nFirst, see if it can be repaired because it's worth a shot. Open Disk Utility from within the Recovery partition that it boots you into. Highlight your drive on the left-side column (You should see two hard drive icons. The top one represents the physical device and the lower one, indented, represents the volume that the computer sees) and then click the \"Repair Disk\" button on the right-side panel. See what it spits out at you in the log. Basically red text bad, green text good.\nIf it tells you the disk was repaired (green text): Restart the Mac and see if it boots up correctly. If it doesn't try holding option on boot and selecting your hard drive as the boot device. If you get back into the system successfully, BACK UP YOUR FILES with Time Machine or your preferred method to another disk.\nIf it tells you the disk couldn't be repaired (red text): Your drive might be failing. If you plug an external drive into the computer, you can use Disk Utility's Restore tab to clone your hard drive to the external drive. Source = your drive and Destination = the external drive (You can drag and drop them from the left column. Note: Make sure the external drive is blank because restoring wipes the destination drive before copying.\nOnce you've restored you could try booting off the external drive (Option on startup, select external drive) and doing the restore process in reverse.\n\nA: Open Disk Utilities and do a Verify Disk. You can try a Repair Disk also. This will either confirm or eliminate that your hard drive is bad, and if you are lucky, may fix the problem. If you get things going and the disk did show problems, immediately run Time Machine to back everything up: you might be on borrowed time.\n", "Q: How to sync up a folder in amazon S3 with people in Austria My business is digital retouching here in the Pacific Northwest, and I have several photographers in Austria who I work with. Typically, both of us have macs running Maverick.\nI would like to have one folder for each client that both of us can put images in and  out. I would like to use my Amazon S3 account like dropbox. My file sizes are large, like 20 to 30 gb\nHow do I go about setting that up with my Amazon S3 account? My level of experience is newbie.\n\nA: I recommend either 3Hub or Forklift in the App Store. If that is not what you are looking for, I can also use https://github.com/timkay/aws. It is command line only though.\n", "Q: How to connect to a specific BSSID via Terminal? My internet provider has a service where I share part of my wifi connection with other subscribers and in return I can use their wifi connection when I'm close to a subscribers router. It's very similar to FON.\nHowever, I'm sometimes at a location where there are three subscribers (A,B and C) nearby. All of them have the service enabled. \nThe service shows up with the same SSID (let's name it ISP-Free), regardless of who the providing subscriber is.\nIn the above case only one SSID shows up in my airport menu, and then my Mac decides by itself to which router (A,B or C) it connects.\nThis decision is not always perfect and it often connects to a router that has a weak signal. Using the Wireless Diagnostics tool (option+click on the airport icon) I can find the BSSID of the strongest ISP-Free router, but I can't connect to it.\nThis answer does not help me as this permanently changes the BSSID to which the SSID ISP-Free will be associated. I don't want that as I connect to the ISP-Free network at other locations as well where the automatic router selection works fine.\nThis solution is not working for me either as it works based on the SSID, not the BSSID.\nSo how can I connect to a specific BSSID without a changing the behaviour of the SSID permanently without third-party software?\nI assumed Terminal would be the only solution, but maybe there's a hidden Apple tool somewhere.\n\nA: You can use\nairport -A=ssid -BSSID=bssidname -password=password \n\nTo find out the BSSID\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport -s\n\n\nA: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport -A \n\nno longer is a supported option, but the airport-bssid tool is good for seeing a list and connecting to a bssid manually.\nhttps://github.com/deekayw0n/airport-bssid\nsee the README.md for usage.\n", "Q: iOS 5 or iOS 4 upload to YouTube? I have iPhone4 running iOS 5.1. No, I will not upgrade to iOS6 because it will delete my beloved pre-installed Maps application, and the new one from Google is [snip...] ... not performing up to my expectations.\nI also have an iPhone3G running iOS 4.2. This cannot be upgraded at all.\nI had used the pre-installed YouTube app to upload videos in the past. Everything worked flawlessly. Now, this app no longer accepts my Google login. Yes, I've read about 2-step login process. I've tried that. Worked everywhere, but on the pre-installed YouTube app. Google is purposely blocking that app because [reasons].\nAn older version of Google's native YouTube app from Appstore (the latest one requires iOS6 that I cannot install) has no way to upload. It recommends to download YouTube Capture App. I try that... and it needs iOS6.\nSomeone please tell me how to upload to YouTube from iOS5 and iOS4.2 considering that pre-installed YouTube app cannot login anymore. \n\nA: I upload through the Safari browser. You have to be in desktop view, but it works every time for me. \n", "Q: Is it possible to update an iOS device to a version older than the current version? My question title probably sounds confusing, so allow me to explain...\nLet's say you have an iPhone 3GS that's still running iOS 5. Is it possible, today, to upgrade that device to iOS 6 (the latest supported version)? Or is it now stuck on iOS 5 because the latest version, iOS 7, doesn't support the 3GS?\nPut another way, if you were to go to Software Update on that device, would it offer you an update to iOS 6, or would it say nothing is available because iOS 7 isn't compatible?\n\nA: I was recently looking for the same thing.  We develop iOS apps and we wanted a way to test our app with older versions of iOS.  Here's what we found to work well:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the iOS ipsw you want.  We use http://www.getios.com/\n\n*Connect your device to a PC running iTunes and navigate to the device page.\n\n*Hold down the 'Shift' key on your keyboard and click the 'Update' button.  Select the ipsw file and iTunes will install this version.\n\n\nA: Normally you should be able to update via iTunes (in this case, further information on that below).\nIf that doesn't work you need to look what model Nr. the iPhone is (something like A1429, for example) and download the appropriate iOS software (about 1 GB). By alt-clicking on the update-button in iTunes you are able to select a specific package you want to update from. Select you downloaded package and wait until the software ist installed on the phone. You should be able to install the most recent version of iOS for your iPhone model this way. \nIf you're experiencing any problems with this, let me know.\n\nA: To give a clear answer to the question that was asked, which is whether a device can be updated to the latest version of iOS it supports, even if that version of iOS is no longer current.\nYes, it is possible. Software Update, either on the device or via iTunes, will offer the latest version that is supported by your device.\nI can't readily find an official reference for this but it is supported by numerous other answers to similar questions on this site.\n\nA: Apple discontinues signing old versions of iOS after a certain period (normally days to weeks for OS's only one or two minor versions out). When your iDevice updates to a new OS, it calls home to verify the OS installed is allowed.\nSince Apple no longer signs old OS's, sadly you can't downgrade very far.\nNote: there are 'hacky' ways of doing this involving 3rd party tools -- but I didn't believe that to be the intent of this question so I didn't delve into those topics.\n\nA: Check signed versions of iOS on ipsw.me for your device. If you see that older version of iOS is still signed by Apple, you can upgrade to it, but not through iTunes. Because iTunes always upgrades your device to the latest version. To upgrade my iPad from 11.4.1 to 12.1.1 ( which was signed at that time, the last version was 12.1.3 at that moment) I used iMazing app on my Mac. Working version you can download from here: https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5651755\nRequires registration.\nAlso you need to upgrade your iTunes on your Mac to the latest version. IPSW file of your desired version of iOS you can download from ipsw.me\n", "Q: How can I do text-to-columns in Numbers? I've got a column where each cell in the column contains two different pieces of data separated by a known delimiter \", \".

You can insert a tab by pressing option-tab.\n\n*Copy and paste the text back to Numbers.\n\n\nA: You can do this directly in Numbers.\nFirst, add two empty columns after the column with the data you want to split.\nIf the first piece of data you want to split is in cell B2 and is separated by a space, then use this formula in the empty cell C2: =LEFT(B2, FIND(\" \",B2))\nIf the data is separated by a comma, then replace \" \" with \",\".\nIn the empty cell D2, paste this formula: =RIGHT(B2, LEN(B2)−FIND(\" \", B2))\nIf your data is separated by a comma followed by a space, then use this: =RIGHT(B2, LEN(B2)−FIND(\",\", B2)-1)\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Under the option for \"format\" (should be on the top right) scroll to the bottom of the table option.  There you will see \"adjust import settings\" this option will allow you to set deliminators for the columns.\nIn my case, I needed to separate via a | (bar).  Worked perfectly.\n\nA: It's unfortunate that there is still no built-in split macro.\nBut these days you can use the textbefore and textafter functions to do the split.\n\"my:column:to:split\"\n=TEXTBEFORE(TEXTAFTER($A1,\":\",1),\":\",1)\n\"column\"\n\n\nA: Copy the data to a text editor and save it as mydoc.csv .

As a just-for-fun type of experiment, I was wanting to install Linux on an external drive that I own and boot it up on my 2007 iMac desktop.\nI know there are a plethora of guides out there on how to do this, but I have not encountered one yet about if it remains the same on 10.9. I have read, however, that the software that lets you dual-boot Mac OS X and Linux is broken on Mavericks, which is where my reluctance comes from.\nThe primary reference that I looked at for how to install Linux onto Mac OS X (on a separate partition) was written for Tiger (see here; MacLife magazine), so I assume there are some things to be updated in that respect.\nFurthermore, the boot menu that I have heard has broken on Mavericks is rEFIt. I noticed that it is no longer maintained, and there is the project known as rEFInd that is maintained.\nSo far, I have tried to use an install DVD to boot up Fedora on my machine, but I can't get my system to recognize the Fedora DVD in any way. I have tried holding down the 'C' key and the 'option' key to try to get it to recognize it, but I never see it outside of my desktop when I'm logged in on Mac OS X. All I have put on the disc is the ISO of Fedora.\n\nAdditionally, after this, I have tried putting the necessary files for installation on an external drive partition that I want to install Fedora on full-time; however, I am also having issues with that as well. Neither rEFInd nor the system recognizes the hard drive as a bootable partition. I was starting to wonder if it might be because the drive is formatted as an exFAT partition?\n\n\nI just need to know if that there is currently a safe way to install Linux on an external hard drive for use on my computer. Thanks!\n\nA: This is getting increasingly harder over time.  Instead of creating a bootable Linux partition, I find it much easier to simply install virtualBox and create a Linux virtual machine instead.     \n\nA: Sorry to hear that rEFIt it broken is Mavericks, I'm sure they'll fix it soon enough.\nIn either case you can still select an alternate boot drive by holding option on system startup. The Mac will show you any devices that are connected and bootable, and you can just pick one to start up on (Likewise from the Startup Disk preference pane in System Preferences). This should play nice with Linux.\nAs for installing, just boot up off the Linux installer with option and point it at whatever partition you want to install to. No stress!\n\nA: you can't simply place the fedora disk images (.iso) onto the dvd, you must burn it onto the dvd using a command such as \"dd\" or by using disk utility\n", "Q: mis-positioning of favicon dragged-and-dropped on desktop 10.8.5 Doing web research, I frequently collect .weblocs on my desktop, clicking on the favicon in a browser URL box,  dragging it to the spot I want, and dropping it there.  Until recently, the resulting .webloc file would always \"stick\" where I put it. (So, I could build up \"piles\" of .webloc icons -- not pretty but effective for quick-and-dirty searches.)  Now the .weblock files are ending up somewhere else, stacking up at center-right of my iMac's display.  (I guess that's the Finder's I-don't-know-where-to-put-it default for all items going on the desktop.)  This occurs for latest versions of FF, Safari, and Chrome.\nFiles and folders I drag and drop to the desktop still \"stick\" as before. Favicons dragged to open folders go where I put them, as before.\nI think this started happening when I reconfigured my external screen to \"be\" on the left of the built-in display from being on the right.  That's the only fallout of this reconfiguration. Everything else about the side-by-side displays operates as expected.\nHow can I restore the old --and, I argue, correct-- operation, so .webloc files go where I put them?\nTIA\n\nA: This problem disappeared when I installed MacOS 10.9.\n", "Q: Dictionaries and spell-checking My default language is English, but I also sometimes type in Czech. I have added a Czech keyboard to OS X, and can switch between the two easily. The trouble is that OS X has no native Czech dictionary.\nIf I download Czech .AFF and .DIC files, I can place them inside /Library/Spelling/, but OS X does not switch which dictionary it uses for continuous spell-checking. I have \"Automatic by Language\" selected in the Keyboard preference pane, but this seems to work very sporadically, if at all.\nIs there an easy solution here I am missing, or is this it? It seems odd that the keyboard and dictionary would not be linked, like they are in iOS. Any help would be appreciated!\n\nA: Only iOS links the keyboard and the spellcheck, OS X has never done that.  Most people find \"automatic\" unreliable.  To activate czech spellcheck, you should set the spell check to czech, either in system prefs/language & text/text/spelling or in Edit > Spelling and Grammar > Show Spelling and Grammar.  In Pages 4 and earlier and iBooks Author, you need to set Inspector > Text > More > Language.  MS Word and some other apps do their own thing.\nThe app Nisus Writer has preference settings that let you link keyboard and spellcheck dictionary.\n", "Q: How to disconnect iPhone from WIFI without 'forgetting' it? My internet connection died whilst my router still continued to work (so I could still pick up wifi but had no internet connection).

I didnt want to 'forget' my WIFI connection as I do not know the password.\nIs there anyway to simply disconnect from a WIFI signal?\n\nA: Turn off auto-join.  I’ve searched for this several times and always thought it was a stupid design by apple but I finally worked it out. \nIn your iPhone settings, turn WiFi off then back on again. If it connects to your home WiFi automatically, click on the i (information) symbol next to the connection. Turn off the ‘auto-join’ option. Then you can turn WiFi off then on again to drop the connection without forgetting it. \nAs the original post I’m replying to is five years old now maybe I’m the only one dumb enough to still be having this problem. But maybe not.  :)\n\nA: So I'm assuming you're tethering your laptop to your phone via wifi from some app? Can you just turn wifi off, then go to the tethering app and enable tethering? If wifi is off I imagine it should turn it on and switch to it's tethering mode.\nAlso, a note: The phone should stay connected to the cellular network while wifi is on.\n\nA: You could use Bluetooth or USB to tether your connection to the laptop. That would allow to deactivate wifi and let the iPhone connect to cellular.\n\nA: You don't actually have to turn off Wifi.  Here's what I do when my cable modem drops:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > Personal Hotspop -> turn to on\n\n*on my laptop, click the WIFI icon in the tray to open the \"Currently Connected to\" Dialog.  \n\n*Sometimes at this point I have to use the refresh Icon in the top right of that dialog a few times to get my iPhone's SSID to show up, sometimes turning the personal hotspot on/off on the phone is what works.  This is the tricky step but if you play with it, the phones SSID will show up in the laptop.\n\n*Connect to the SSID for the phone when it appears.  The phone will drop it's connection to the router and start tethering the laptop.  \n\n\nWhen your ready to return, just turn off the personal hotspot on the phone and the phone will re-join the routers network. \n\nA: Turn off \"Handoff\" in \"General\" and turn off \"Calls on other devices\" and try, it worked for me.\n", "Q: iTerm2 doesn't read com.googlecode.iterm2.plist I am iTerm2 (1.0.0) user.

It wasn’t difficult to duplicate the problem, on both her Mac and mine.  I’m wondering if someone may have seen this before, before I file a bug report.\nHere’s the process, which has been 100% repeatable in my tests.\nCreate a folder, either on the local hard drive or on a server.  Call this folder “Will Vanish” or similar, because this folder and its contents will soon vanish.\nIn that new folder, place a few files you don’t care about.  Also copy a Pages 4.3 file into that same folder, or create a new file from within Pages 4.3 (part of iWork ’09).\nClose the Pages file, if it is open.\nFrom the Finder, rename that Pages file so that it begins with a tilde (~) character.\nOpen the Pages file in Pages 4.3.  Move the Pages window so that you can also see the Will Vanish folder and its contents.\nSave the file (Command-S or File->Save).\nThe Will Vanish folder and its contents are now gone, and (at least by my testing) cannot be found.\nI’m aware the tilde is a special character in Unix-like OS’s, representing the home folder.  Most typical users aren’t aware of this, and it’s somewhat common to use that character as a filename prefix to force the file to the top of alphabetical lists in the Finder.  That’s a common use case in this particular workgroup.  Luckily only one user has yet upgraded to Mavericks, and she prefers the older iWork (which is preserved by the new iWork install within Mavericks).\nI’ve made a screen recording of this:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/s1plb55o08tcwbp/Screen%20Recording%20-%20file%20loss%202013-11-22b.mov\nI’m hoping that someone can confirm this experience, and/or comment on any workarounds.\n\nA: While the tilde is reserved in Unix to shortcut the users directory, it's also used by Pages, Numbers, and Keynote (as well as the Office apps) to prefix temp cache/version files.  They are invisible to the user via the Finder. I would try navigating to the folder with the command line and see if it shows up with an ls -larth.  Best advice is don't use \"~\" as a prefix for iWork or Office documents.\n", "Q: How to restart an iPhone with a broken Hold Button? I have an iPhone 4S (iOS 7) and my Hold Button is broken.

That's my reason for wanting to back up my OS X (image?).\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: Before you start, I would strongly recommend MacWorld's excellent series of articles on upgrading to Mavericks.\nFor taking a copy of your internal disk Carbon Copy Cloner is the best way to go. SuperDuper! is good too, but it's not compatible with Mavericks which might cause you problems if you want to back out.  You can use CCC to create a separate bootable external disk (or even an internal partition).  Try to use a USB 3 or FireWire disk as USB 2 is painfully slow to boot from.\nOnce you have taken your copy, upgrade your internal disk to Mavericks.  If you don't like Mavericks you can undo your work by booting off your external disk and from there overwrite your internal disk using CCC.\n", "Q: How to bypass country restrictions on App Store? I want to download an iPhone app which is not accessible from my country (India). How can I bypass the country restrictions?\n\nA: You need an iTunes account for the country-specific store in order to download apps restricted to certain countries. If the app is not free, you also will need either a credit card issued in that country or some iTunes gift cards (also from that country).\n\nA: How to bypass country restrictions on App Store?\nI want to download an iPhone app which is not accessible from my country (India). How can I bypass the country restrictions?\nHi Prasanth S here is two solutions involving VPN and DNS. These solutions can also be implemented on a router level but that is another topic. \nBy pass County Restrictions, block websites, run a vpn, select an open dns- all OPEN SOURCE:\nMethod 1 VPN:\nThe apps openvpn and open vpn spider work together. If these apps are blocked I encourage you to try the DNS soloution provided below. \nTIP: OpenVpn Spider will show an ad when you attempt to load a profile into Openvpn (your actully loading a certificate into a protocol)- so click a different server in less than 20-30 seconds (after the ad can be closed) or soemthing and you won't be tracked through that ad to the server. \n( Otherwise, the ad (likely google) will know which vpn your on. If you care- yes you can view this from either a non signed in account or another- in account info- you can also opt out of the tracking! )\nYou can select a country in OpenVPN Spider app at the top. \n\nMethod 2 ) Change your DNS\nNow search for your carriers DNS settings, write them down or copy them to a note. Now search for a subsitute- type \"OpenDNS servers   \" into google/duckduckgo/ whatever. If you were successful in turning on a VPN on your iphone or ipad so far, you can choose to match this county with the DNS server by searching specifically for it. \nGoogle's server- is not really DNS open but it does unblock sometimes- the VPN will automatically be connected to Google's service anyhow. You may attempt to block it as well if you want and divert traffic to a new DNS setting as well- but this will cause most google apps to error and logout- given how prelevant they are I hestiate to suggest that.\nGoogle servers for DNS are 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 \nNow go to settings--> General --> Restritions\nTurn it on- make a code\nNow enable Adult restrictions\nYou will now see a white list (allow) and a block list\nEnter the carrier DNS into the block list (the numbers- which by the way are called an octet- 8 groups of binary numbers showed in decimal form to make it easier on you :) . You can also block a port by entering a semicolon : after the digits. So DNS is port 53. Your entry would look like this-\nxxx.xx.xxx.xx: 53 \nwhere the ip address is represented prior to the semicolon.\nNow scroll up and enter several websites into the allow list- you can add entries in here- just add the DNS server you want to use. Keep in mind the OpenVPN servers do die after a while. You'll also want to add common websites you visit. Some sites are automatically blocked - such as porn- so if you want them you can allow it here. Only make each \"similar\" entry once.\nPutting VPN together with DNS blocking may not be completely necessary but it should unblock you and hide the activity. I'd also download a tor type app for browsing- using this after connecting to the VPN. It sounds like there's not much freedom there... \nMethod 3 ON WIFI\nYou may also want to block your home high speed internet's DNS as well. So when you connect to wifi you can bypass the app store block. \nSimply find the settings by either going on routers homepage (you can block them there as well sometimes) and noting them. \nIf you don't have access to the router- simply select the connection in your Wifi settings on your iphone- select manal and copy all the info but the DNS and replace it with what you would like. If you do this prior to selecting a connection agreement and change the last part of the IP address (just extorporlate from what the machine gave you) you can in fact bypass the connection agreement as well if it exists (such as at hotel) .\nEXTRA: \nOther hidden features of Restricted Websites besides Restricting Websites:\nA note on Google HangOuts- this app will also change the number its coming from depdnign on the server you choose. \nActually - in the opposite of this I usually choose to allow accounts.google.com to prevent the logout or problems with their services.\nYou can also block ( or allow- as in new lines for below) a range of ports such as 81-20000. \nAdditionally you can refer to the phones local host and block or allow a service on the phone- i.e. an app - for example Google HangOuts uses a specific port. There are also security features you can implement beyond what Apple has provided in restrictions- such as an entire firewall. To refer to the local host, type the IP address\n127.0.0.1 or I believe \"localhost\" (no quotes) works as well. Same thing with the semicolon and the range. [ This is incoming ports , where as an IP address will be treated as outgoing ]\nSo If we want to block internet entirely for HTTP (the web) we can enter\n127.0.0.1:80\nIf I want to block ports above 80 I can enter\nxxx.xx.xxx.xx: 81-20000\nNow your use is just governed by the law and there is less if any tracking if you combine this with the other methods listed here . Hopefully this works for you! Thanks for reading.\n-Mail\n", "Q: My available disk space does not make sense. Why? I have a 256 GB SSD installed in my Macbook Pro. Today I observed that Finder tells me that I have a free disk space of 247.51 GB, which is unquestionably wrong.\nAt the same time, in System → About this Mac, I can see I have 44.73 GB of available disk space. I think this number is more accurate, but it tells me that 202.78 GB of used space is backup, which is not right. I do not know the actual size of backup files, but my personal files take about 125 GB, so there cannot be 200+ GB of backup files.\nI'm confused. What's happening to my computer?\nEdit: This is the related snapshot, the size given by Mavericks are slightly different then yesterday, but it's still not making sense. I believe DaisyDisk's report is right.\nThe 256 GB SSD is the only hard drive that I have installed. I replaced the original HDD with it.\n\nEdit 2:\nToday the available disk space gone crazy. It shows that I have 265.06 GB available...\n\nA: you are on a laptop using time machine. time machine uses local snapshots on portable computers. they are stored at /.MobileBackups if you want to have a look and verify how much space it is consuming.\n\nA: First off, I do not think that your file system is corrupted or broke. But you can verify this by booting from Recovery HD (to do this start your laptop while holding the keys \"Command\" and \"r\" pressed)(I am assuming you are 10.7+), you should then come to a screen where you can start Disk Utility. There you can run Repair Disk Permissions and Repair Disk. If it runs without errors and/or fixes everything, you are good to go.\nFrom your screenshot I can gather a few things. In brackets which window I gathered the info from:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSD with 256GB (About This Mac)\n\n*210.9GB taken (Daisy Disk, this is the total amount used by your system)\n\n*Backups 149.32GB (About This Mac)\n\n*MobileBackups 95.2GB (DaisyDisk)(see answer by Brad Allred: local snapshots here link again, so the Backup can be bigger than the backuped files because there are several backups present)\n\n*193.59GB free (Macintosh)\n\n*44.3GB free (About This Mac)\n\n\nI think what is confusing you is points 5. and 6.\nThis can be explained if you look at the difference: 193.59GB-44.3GB=149.29GB which comes quite close to the third point: Backups 149.32GB (a small error comes from conversion and rounding). \nThe difference is that the Finder calculates the free space you can use (the backups would be deleted if necessary). But the About This Mac window and DaisyDisk show the SDD as is so with the Backups.\nThis link explains snapshots and your situation quite well. The different free space sizes and how to turn off snapshots. In terminal: sudo tmutil disablelocal (this will immediately delete local snapshots)\n", "Q: How to set multihoming for download from multiple Wi-Fi connections? My problem is I want to download from my university's wireless router but it has a speed limitation and I want to bypass this limitation with adding more Wi-Fi connections by different IP address.\nTherefore I need a virtual connection to receive my request and split them to multiple Wi-Fi connections and get their response and merge them. Is this possible to increase my download speed?\n\nA: No, it is not immediately possible.\nIf you had a server that you control in between you and the server you want to download from, it is theoretically possible.\nYou would install several wireless network cards (or USB WiFi dongles or whatever) in your computer. Setup these up with different IP-addresses.\nThe server you control (outside your wireless network - i.e. on the Internet somewhere) would download the file for you, edit the received packets to load-balance between your IP-addresses/ports for the wireless interface you have, and send them on to you.\nOn your computer you would need a special program to receive those packets and reassemble it as a single TCP stream and pass it on to the actual program doing the downloading.\nThis could more generally be achieved using some sort of VPN software.\nHowever I don't think anything readily available for Mac OS X exists that has this functionality, so you'll have to build it yourself.\nAll in all, unless you are very interested in networks and computers, it is not easily  achievable.\n", "Q: What are the best WBS and Gantt chart tool working cross platform?

I want to develop apps for Apple devices but I can't get them there as I do not have a credit card. So, can I use an iTunes gift card to sign up for the developer program or, do I really need to use credit card?\n\nA: No - or at least, I couldn't.\nI tried this today (2021-12-15) and the payment details page said \"Apple Store Gift Cards are not eligible with some items in your order\".\nThere was no other items in my order, other than the Apple Developer Program renewal.\nAnd I use the same Apple ID for ADP as I used for the gift card. So for me, I could not pay for my membership with a gift card.\nI'm in Australia - I guess it's possible that it might be different in other places.\nEDIT - I logged a question with Apple Developer Program Support and they said \"I understand your situation where you would like to pay for the program in partial gift card balance. However, we currently do not accept other payment methods other than credit card\".\nSo I think that's pretty definitive.\n\nA: No,  you can't use a gift card. You might want to try a prepaid credit card. You can get them at most places that sell gift cards. \n\nA: Renewals may be less strict than the initial payment before you have filled out all the banking forms, tax forms, legal agreements, etc…\nI always use iTunes gift cards to pay for the developer fees. Usually manage to get them with some rebate (20% often) which makes the developer account 20% cheaper.\nThe long version: Your developer account is connected to an AppleID, and the developer fees are charged to the iTunes account for your AppleID.

Connected through USB3, Thunderbolt and internally (S-ATA). \nUnfortunately I can only find benchmarks which concentrate on measuring read and write speeds. I am also (and mostly) interested in the latency. \nI tried Xbench and Blackmagic Disk Speed Test. \nIs there a tool which can benchmark storage devices including their latency?\n\nA: For the OP, look up fio, I think someone mentioned it somewhere on this. It's the best way to explore the limits of the SSD on your Mac. Just be sure to use the 'direct=0' argument, or you may bork your filesystem. \nThat said...\nSome of the answers here are just absurd! I know the replies are years old at this point, but you absolutely can, and SHOULD, measure IO Latency of an SSD. \ntl;dr: SSDs have IO latency like any other storage system, you can measure it. \nThere's a distinct difference between 'Seek Time', a mechanically-bound metric associated with spinning disk, and 'IO Service Time' which is an aggregate of the latency associated with each step of the I/O process. In environments with spinning disks (including home PCs and Macs), Seek Time is one such step, and can be quite significant in poorly designed/cached/maintained systems (which is probably the vast majority of business systems, and nearly every home system not run by someone skilled in the realm of storage performance tuning).\nGenerally, folks are referring to this IO Service Time when they say 'latency', and not 'Seek Time', as that metric has become increasingly irrelevant as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flash-based storage devices become the norm\n\n*Spinning disks inside and outside of the enterprise IT shop bump up against mechanical limitations which simply cannot be exceeded due to physics\n\n*Systems needing real performance rely on software optimizations (caching implementations, IO coalescing, maintenance of stripe sets and other tricks to ease the grip Newtonian physics has on the storage system's disks) or expectation management (\"If you want faster, don't be cheap, buy flash, otherwise hush.\") as most of the ultra-high-performance storage consumers have moved to Flash long ago, taking the pressure off of spinning disk manufacturers to push for that last quarter of a millisecond of seek time performance\n\n\nWhen we are evaluating a storage system, we are talking in terms of microseconds most of the time. These days, if a storage system cannot provide consistently sub-5ms performance under any load (for general workloads), it can't hang. For the high performance consumers, we expect consistent sub-1ms response times for the critical workload profiles. \nThe fastest spinning disks you can get have seek times of over 2ms alone, and that's the best case scenario. Add in the fact that if you're in a RAID array scenario, every disk needs to seek to the desired stripe and they may be all over the place as far as head position, so it can get pretty ugly. (In a pure hardware RAID scenario without caching strategies to lessen this, see above.) Add in to that the time it actually takes to move the desired data, compute parity if necessary, update stripes where applicable... You can see, the benefits of SSDs become obvious immediately, in terms that aren't very hard to articulate, once you know what's up. Hope this rant helps googlers out there in their quest for the knowledges.  \n\nA: A great tool for doing this type of benchmarking is fio\nFor Mac OS X it is available through homebrew. You install it with the simple command:\nbrew install fio\nThis command requires that you have homebrew installed in advance.\nIf you haven't, go to this web site and grab it:\nhttp://brew.sh/\n\nA: Those utilities you list likely do test drive latency, but only for HDD.\nYou really can't test the latency of an SSD, because there are no spinning parts to bring the required disk sector under the read-write head, and there is no read-write head for that matter. HDD metrics like rotational latency and seek times don't apply:\n\nFor SSDs, most of the attributes related to the movement of mechanical components are not applicable, but the device is actually affected by some other electrically based element that still causes a measurable delay when isolating and measuring that attribute\n\nThere is a latency metric for SSD, but you still can't test it, or it won't tell you anything of value if you could, unless you have a certain kind of enterprise design:\n\nToday low latency can only effectively be addressed by one particular type of storage architecture and that’s an enterprise SSD design. Latency in a technical environment is synonymous with delay. More succinctly latency in terms of a SSD is how long it will take for a request to complete its round trip cycle from the time the request enters the device to the time that it leaves the device with the “payload” in tow. \n\nThe latency will be exactly the same for all the examples you mention because it is a metric internal to the SSD (see above \"from the time the request enters the device to the time that it leaves the device with the “payload” in tow.\"). \nIf you want to know what that value is for your SSD, check with the manufacturer. \n", "Q: Reasons to Stay with Safari Browser I know many Mac OS X users would prefer to use Google Chrome, I so hope that I could do so but here are my reasons why I stick with Safari:\n\n\n*\n\n*I could play Facebook video using HTML5 player with a simple plugin, I found none of the same in Google Chrome\n\n*Safari browser can integrate with Mac OS X social network accounts for one-click share to Facebook, Twitter, Email etc...\n\n*It seems to me that Safari is more energy efficient especially on Mavericks compare to Google Chrome.\n\n\nIf you have better suggestions that I could resolve the above and switch to Google Chrome, please feedback.

Work MBP Retina 2013 13\" (with 60W magsafe 2)  \nSo can I use my 85\" magsafe for my 13\" retina using this converter without any power issues?\n\nA: Apple themselves states that it is safe and okay to use a higher power cord on a laptop even if it only requires a lower power one: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2346\nThe power requirement for your computer really is just a \"minimum\" power requirement. If you can even call it that. Because they'll actually charge even on lower powered cords, but it will be slower and it's not recommended. MacBooks can officially (meaning Apple supports it) use cords that supply more power than the standard provided by the default cord. The computer will actually only pull what it needs from the cord, it's not as if the cord will force as much power as it's rated for into your computer.\nAs far as the adapter, there shouldn't be any issues with it. Apple states that it's for using a MagSafe cord with a MagSafe 2 MacBook. Which at least implies that it supports all MagSafe cords, and all their different power outputs. And there's not really a reason I can think of why it shouldn't anyways. There is an 85W MagSafe 2 cord, and I doubt Apple would make an adapter that wouldn't work for those computers that require it.\n", "Q: Is Magsafe strain relief covered by warranty?

The USB device should be recognized by the Mac OS not as another Bluetooth device, but as an Audio Device.\nAlso it seems that some devices are only transmitting output stereo sound, I need both - high quality mono-or-stereo and high quality microphone.\nCan you please tell if such adapter exists?\n\nA: Technically, those adapters don't exist.\n\nThe USB device should be recognized by the Mac OS not as another Bluetooth device, but as an Audio Device.\n\nI agree with you on this one.  You definitely don't want to have a secondary Bluetooth adapter appearing in macOS.  So to clearly define what you're looking for is a USB audio interface with Bluetooth capability.\nWe have to make one.  Here's what you need:\n\n*\n\n*USB DAC Audio Interface.  I personally like and use the Behringer UCA202. I have mine attached to my iMac and plugged into a Bose Wave Radio.\n\n*Bluetooth Transmitter/Receiver.  I also like and use the TaoTronics Bluetooth Transmitter & Receiver.  I have mine hooked up as a transmitter to an LG TV in the bedroom so I can watch TV using my regular Bluetooth headset (I didn't want one of those proprietary things where I couldn't use the headset of my choice).\n\nNow, all you have to do is connect the USB DAC to the Bluetooth transmitter and then pair your headphones to it and not the Mac's Bluetooth.  (Here's the awesome part) Since it's attached to the Mac as a USB audio device, all you have to do is turn the volume up to the max on the BT transmitter and use the Mac to control the volume on the DAC.  You will maintain full volume control through the Mac.  However, the volume control on the headset will manipulate the volume on the transmitter, not the DAC, so you'll have to keep that in mind.\nAs far as stereo/mono, this setup will transmit whatever you send over.  For instance, the TV I have mine attached to does stereo and mono output and the BT transmitter handles each with no problem\n\nA: I do believe that what is needed here is a new USB Bluetooth adapter.\nMy guess is that the problem with the Mac Mini is that it has an older Bluetooth \"radio\" built into it which does not support the higher data rates and therefore higher quality audio.  Using some kind of Bluetooth \"transmitter\" connected to an audio output port might also work but I have not seen any such devices that support audio out to headset speakers and also audio in from a microphone.  That's not saying they don't exist, I simply have not seen one.\nEarly Bluetooth hardware could not support the new data rates required to support high fidelity stereo headsets.  Given that this question was asked when Bluetooth 4.0 and 4.1 were still new I suspect this might be the case.  A new USB Bluetooth adapter, and an OS update to support the new Bluetooth devices and protocols, might fix the audio quality issues on the Mac Mini.  It's also a pretty cheap and easy fix to try, with new Bluetooth 4.x adapters selling for about $20.\n", "Q: How can I log into an azure VM via my Mac? Recently switched to Macs.\nI have some Azure VMs. In Windows, I just need to boot up the remote connections dialog, put in the server and credentials and it should log me in.\nIs there a similar sort of thing for OSX as well?\n\nA: You just need a Remote Desktop Client.\nMicrosoft has an official one called Microsoft Remote Desktop, that is free.

I was greeted with a screen that would not wake up. \nAfter much rebooting (by holding down the power button and over SSH), I plugged it into an external monitor, logged in, and opened up System Information (formerly System Profiler). To my shock and horror, only the external monitor was detected and the internal \"Color LCD\" wasn't listed. \nDoes anyone know anything about the pathology of a problem like this? Does fixing something like this (probably) entail a logic board replacement? \nI'm inclined to believe that the problem lies somewhere in an LCD controller or power supply rather than the panel (because I'd assume that a broken panel would still show up). \nAgain, the general functions of the machine work just fine—just not the internal display.\n\nA: I had similar symptoms on my MBP 13 (mid-2010).

I'm using the Notes app that comes with my Mac, but I can't find where the notes are getting saved in the Finder.\nWhere can I find these files?\n\nA: In OS X 10.9 (“Mavericks”), at least, they’re not stored as individual text documents in a place where you can see them and manipulate them.\nEven the notes that you choose to save “On my Mac” end up sandboxed in places like ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/CoreData/ExternalRecords/AA97DB8E-73B4-4C75-B54F-B39E5BC7521F/Note/_records/0/p6.notesexternalrecord, where ~/Library means the (usually invisible) “Library” folder that sits alongside your “Documents”, “Music” and “Pictures” folders.\nYou can see them by choosing Go to Folder… from the Go menu in the Finder and pasting in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/CoreData/ExternalRecords.  You’ll find yourself looking at a folder with a 32-character hyphenated name, which you can open.  Then open the “Note” folder and then the “_records” folder.  All your notes are two levels further down.\nAlternatively, use the following Terminal command:\nopen ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/CoreData/*/*/Note/_records\n\nThere’s not much that you can do with them, however:  they are not text or .rtf files, and I suspect that moving any of these files around or changing their contents directly might very well render individual notes irrecoverable — or possibly even break the Notes.app altogether.\nIf you’re looking for a quick note-taking app where your files are easily findable in the Finder and stored in standard .rtf or text format (with or without Markdown), you might look at Brett Terpstra’s free nvALT or at any of the other derivatives of Notational Velocity.\n\nA: Try this free Mac app. Works for me...\nhttp://writeapp.net/notesexporter/\nExports all notes to a single directory in plain text format.\n\nA: The Notes are not saved in your folder, unless if you do it yourself through third party apps.\nAll the answers that were posted here seem really complicated, time-taking, not 100% guaranteed, and very risky for your system.\nI currently use a program called iMazing, which works really well, all you have to do is plug your iPhone to your computer, and drag the notes from the app's window to a folder on your computer. They will instantly turn to TXT files.\nThe sucky part is that iMazing is a program you have to pay for.\nThere is another one that works just like it called iExplorer, I used to use it before, and it works well as well. Can't remember if it's free or not.\nThere's also this, which I haven't tried, and this one too.\nAll these options seem to work well; but I would recommend avoiding:\n-Tampering with a iOS system folder;\n-Modifying SQL databases or sandboxed files;\n-Accessing the system folder of your computer, iCloud folder backups or iPhone backups.\nI am not endorsed by these apps, use them at your own risk! I hate having to pay to solve my tech-related problems, and will always rather tweak or tamper by hand whenever it's possible, free and fast (for example right-clicking and showing package contents, using a free app, etc). But in the case of Mac OS X / iOS Notes, it's just too risky and complicated for me to do it through terminal, SQL database import and what not.\nI've tried these solutions and they worked for me, so I'm sharing them here because I think they could help people save their notes without screwing up their system files.\nI know that iOS 9 now has Notes with images and sketches support, I have no idea what the best solution to save these \"new\" notes will be, but I will update this answer if I get a chance.\n\nA: For 10.11 (El Capitan), look in:\n~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/\n\n\nA: I just recovered my Notes on 10.9.2 installation, the file is SQLite 3.x database located in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/NotesV2.storedata\n\nA: I simply did a search for \"notesexternalrecord\".\nFrom there, when you click on a note, it's location is listed graphically just above the Status bar of the window displaying the documents (i.e. individual notes).\nCaution though, as mentioned previously, monkeying with them could cause irreversible damage to the app or the notes themselves. Always make sure you have a good backup before you mess with things like this.\n\nA: If you do want to have a copy of your Notes records, you can open the notes you want using the Notes application, and from the File menu, use Export as PDF... you can rename the PDF file if you want... at the same time, once exported, you can use the Preview app to see your exported Notes record... the PDF files can be easily copied to any portable media devices and can be viewed using PDF readers...\n\nA: For Stickies.app, the notes data goes to ~/Library/StickiesDatabase on Mac OS X 10.7.5.\n", "Q: Does software compilation continue even if I close the lid of my MacBook Pro (7,1)? My specific case is that I am installing something from MacPorts and it's taking a very long time. I just want to close the lid of my laptop.\nWill the compilation still continue?\nI do not want to install the NoSleep app.\n\nA: As mentioned before, closing the lid of a portable Mac causes it to sleep, and not to dream of compilations as-yet unfinished.\n\nWhat happens when I close the lid on my MacBook Pro running OS X?\n\nIf (and only if, apparently) your Mac is connected to: \n\n\n*\n\n*an external display,  \n\n*an external keyboard or mouse or trackpad\n\n*a power adapter,\n\n\nyour laptop will operate in \"clamshell mode\", as outlined here:  \n\nhttp://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201834\n\nand your compilation will continue.\n\nA: Generally, closing the lid will put your computer completely to sleep. Meaning any running processes will only continue once you wake the computer back up. There are very rare cases where this does not apply. \nHowever, why must you close the lid? The way that MacBooks are designed, they're the best ventilated when the lid is open. If you close it, you can block the air outputs. You can operate your computer, or allow it to continue operating to finish a task, with the lid closed. But it isn't a good idea to do so if the task will be intensive in any way. And compiling is certainly intensive. Meaning you shouldn't close the lid when anything's compiling or installing from MacPorts.\nSo in short, no, software compiling will most likely not continue if you close the lid. And in addition, why would you need to? It's better not to as your computer will run cooler and last longer.\n\nA: This may sound a little over-the top, but I found an ad-hoc way when I wanted to start a compile, walk to work from a coffee shop and have it proceed while on my way. There are several ssh apps for the iPhone. On your Mac, go to the \"sharing\" control panel and turn on \"Remote Login\" and \"Internet Sharing\". For \"Internet Sharing\", turn on iPhone USB. Now an iPhone that is tethered by USB to your Mac is on a LAN with your Mac. If the Mac is hosting an ssh login, it will not do \"clamshell\" behavior. The sharing control will tell you how to refer to you Mac when doing an ssh login. So on your iPhone, follow your App's instruction to connect to\nyour-account@whatever-the-sharing-panel-tells-you\nSo typically, it will look something like myaccount@ip-address, and you will have to give your account password. This will bring up a console and in my case, it was trivial to start a big make session in the background. I close the shell. Things keep moving. This is no walk in the park, if you forgive the pun. You have to make sure your iPhone doesn't sleep or it will close the ssh shell on its end. You also have to keep it tethered by USB (so in my case I had to throw it my backpack with the Mac.) There are ways to tether it via bluetooth or wifi, but my spirit of adventure ended with the one success. This may not solve your problem, but it did mine.\n", "Q: Mac Freezes when left IDLE I'm having a trouble with my Mac.

After that I want to use Mail interactively.\nI've been trying to find out how to do this from various AppleScript manuals, but it's all a bit uphill for a beginner, and I would appreciate some help. I tried looking through some AppleScript dictionaries for Mail.app, but I couldn't find appropriate commands, except for \"activate\". I saw various things in sample code like \"menu bar 1\", but didn't know how to find the menu items in menu bar 1.\nSorry to ask elementary questions, but I need to get a program working, and this should be only a couple of lines away.

When I plug in a USB audio device, if no sounds are playing then my output automatically switches to that device. However, if a program is currently playing any audio then it does not switch. If I enter Audio/MIDI Setup and change it manually, [EDIT: or change it in System Preferences -> Sound, or by alt clicking on the volume control in the menu bar] then the running program still does not switch.\n[EDIT: I most often encounter this situation with Chrome, VLC, and many video games.]\nIs there a way I can switch the output for audio that's already playing, without restarting the program in question?\n\nA: If you alt-click on the speaker icon in your toolbar you can select output and input devices.\n\n\nA: It depends on the program that is playing the sound. If I have a youtube video playing in Safari, I can switch between output devices in Audio MIDI Setup, and it works. VLC on the other hand handles the choice of output device for itself, so I have to change it in VLC. The advantage is that I can choose an output device that is not the default one.\n\nA: Under System Preferences → Sound → Output there should be a list of available output devices. From that list you should be able to choose your output device.\n\n\nA: Use output, it is a program that sits in the menu bar which can switch the audio device on the fly. \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/output/id435867551?mt=12\nI use it at work to switch between my built in output on my Macbook Pro and my logitech usb headset. \nExcept for one voip provider, and google chat, It is able to switch the audio on the fly in every program I have tried. \n", "Q: What MAC address should I use for my Thunderbolt Ethernet on a MBPR? I use MAC addresses to assign static IPs on my network and have recently added a new MacBook Pro Retina with Thunderbolt adapters in stead of Ethernet ports. On the box one MAC address is given for the \"Ethernet\" but when I plug in to the Thunderbolt ports using the Ethernet-Thunderbolt adapter, I see a different MAC address for this connection.\nWhich MAC address does the DCHP server see when assigning IP addresses?\n\nI should add that the Ethernet-Thunderbolt adapter doesn't seem to work at all for me. It either incorrectly reports that no cable is connected, or self-assigns an IP address. \n\nA: When an interface self-assigns an IP it generally means the interface isn't getting any response from your router or DHCP server. This is a feature of OS X to let the machines build an adhoc network when they cannot determine the actual network they're on -- you can put a bunch of Macs on a dumb hub and almost get them to self-organize and function with this feature.\nYour router and DHCP server are going to see the MAC address listed for the device in the Network Preferences pane. Go to System Preferences -> Network and click on your Thunderbolt interface. Click on the Advanced... button and then on the Hardware tab:\n\nThat's the MAC address that your interface is broadcasting on the network when it's trying to acquire an IP on your network from your DHCP server.\n", "Q: Incremental Backup of iPhoto Library I have an external hard drive, not always connected to my laptop. I don't use it for Time Machine, as it's not big enough, and most of my important documents are on DropBox... Plus I only connect it a few minutes per week when I need to copy something.\nFor iPhoto, I found the Library file and I manually copy it to my external drive once in a while. The problem I have with that, is the file is growing big (22GB last I checked), and I feel like it's a waste to wait so long for copying the entire file, while I'm really only adding the last GB for example.\nIs there a way to just add the increment?\nKeep in mind again I only connect my external drive when needed.\n\nA: Interesting question.\nThe first thing to realise is that the iPhoto Library is a folder, not a file. The Finder shows it as a file for end-user convenience, but it really is a folder.\nThere are many tools to quickly mirror a folder from a source to a destination. I would recommend using rsync.\n\nA: Pretty much any app that does incremental back ups will back up the iPhoto Library. Some suggestions:\nChronosync http://www.econtechnologies.com/pages/cs/chrono_overview.html\nDejaVu http://propagandaprod.com\nCarbon Copy Cloner - http://www.bombich.com\nI've used all of these at different times and changed for various reasons.

I mean other than what you can configure, like RAM and SSD capacity and CPU speed and the fact that the ME294 comes with NVDIA Graphics as well as the Iris is there anything else different? Like motherboard (logic board they call them?) features, or Chipsets on the board?    \nTo put it differently, I usually see similar laptops on Apple online store, with one model starting at lower price and if you choose more RAM/CPU/HDD on the lower end option it looks like you get to the higher end model, both price-wise and spec-wise is there anything else other that what meets the eyes to be considered?\nEDIT: So by the looks of it, it is not just a matter of difference in RAM, HDD, CPU speed, that separates the lower end models from higher end models, they are really different things, in some cases it may be just a small difference, but in some it may be significant, I think I got my answer. From the comments.\nAnd for the reference the models are like ME293LL and ME294LL \n\nA: A custom-built ME293 model with a 2.3 GHz CPU, 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of SSD, although costing the same as the stock ME294, is not the same hardware because it's missing the Nvidia GPU. I speak from experience as I have one of these (Intel GPU only), with the 2.6 GHz CPU upgrade. Other than that I'm fairly sure they're identical.\n", "Q: AppleScript Editor : comment line shortcut?

There are about 430 folders within the root one, and I'd estimate ≈20 images (with varying file types) within each subdirectory. Ideally I'd like to be able to browse through all the photos in order, but there doesn't seem to be a high-capacity image browser that can handle that.\nThe first solution that comes to mind would be to just merge all the folders into one, but the images have to remain in their respective folders.\nIs there any app that can do this, or am I just grasping at thin air here?\n\nA: Isn't this where you would want to utilize Smart Folders, and search for Images?\nThis tutorial gives an example, but I've outlined a basic overview below:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open New Smart Folder.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Select the type of search (in this case, type in images, and choose    Kind:Images from the selections.)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Locate the Save button and save the search.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Choose a meaningful name for the search.

It appears that the storage space on my iPhone4S is not adding up to 16GB. I know 16GB is just the theoretical storage space, but currently, the total space seems too far away. Here's a screenshot of the storage status of my phone:\n\nAs you can see, 1.8 + 11.6 = 13.4GB. Where did the other 2GB go? Is this normal? Or are there residual files left on my iPhone that can't be cleaned up properly? I'm running out of space and so this means a lot to me.\n\nA: Keep in mind that you don't start with 16GB, but 16 x (1,000 x 1,000 x 1,000) ÷ (1024 x 1024 x 1024), or roughly 14.9 GB.  So, the OS itself is only using up around 1.5GB.\n\nA: I'd say that's normal, my own 16GB iPhone 5 is adding up to 13.3 GB of available space. I would assume that the other space would be taken up by iOS itself, with system files, libraries etc. Also, as Kent mentions, the actual space is not 16GB to begin with.\n", "Q: Internal mic not detecting audio - 2011 Macbook Pro Mavericks 10.9 Hey so I feel really dumb asking this, but I cannot figure out why my internal mic on my 2011 MBP recently stopped working.\nHere's what I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Zapping the PRAM\n\n*Resetting the SMC by \"Using the built-in keyboard, press and hold\nthe Left Shift, Command, Option and Power Button at the same time.\"\n\n*Quadruple checked audio settings: built-in mic, audio up, not muted,\nvoiceover off, detected by plugins, and so on.\n\n*Everything's up to date\n\n*Disk permission and everything are good\nI feel like I've done more than that too.

I could of course buy Apple's thunderbolt display, but I'm looking for alternatives. Will every screen be good or do I need to look out for specific specifications because of the retina display? I guess when you are used to a high-res retina screen, the resolution of the external display should also be very high to match the Macbook retina screen?\n\nA: You can set the resolution of the external display independent from that of the retina display. \nI personally use a Full-HD display with a VGA->Thunderbold adapter at work and at home a Full-HD display with a DVI->Thunderbold adapter. \nI prefer the DVI variant, but this is also because of the generally better display at home.\n\nA: The external monitor is completely independent of the retina screen. Any monitor would work (via HDMI or Thunderbolt to DVI/VGA adapters). \nOS X more or less seamlessly transitions between the two monitors (retina vs. non-retina).\nYou will not be able to find an external display that matches the \"retina\" quality. Not even Apple makes a non-laptop display that is retina. Even if you bought a 4k display, it would still be 1x pixels as opposed to retina's 2x.\nIt won't be as nice as your retina display, but buy a high quality external monitor and you'll be happy with the quality. You generally sit a bit further back from an external display (verses a laptop) so it isn't as bad using a retina/non-retina combo as you'd imagine.\n", "Q: Defaults utility: how to get xcode project info I have found that utility defaults can get info from .plist file.\nBut how can I canonically pass as parameter to it path to .plist file ?\nI read about <domain> parameter but still don't have enough understanding of it.\nIf I go to project directory where .plist file of projects is placed and input command\n> defaults read ./Project.plist\nI will see error that this domain\nDomain ./Project.plist is not exists\n\nA: I didn't know that the domain parameter is a full path to a file with .plist extension\nSo, the correct way to pass parameter domain which points to specific project is this:\n> defaults read ~/FULLPATHTOPROJECT/Project.plist\nBut I will glad to see your answers of defaults-utility best practices\n\nA: You will find a lot of information about this in the man page for defaults (just run man defaults in Terminal):\n Specifying domains:\n\n domain    If no flag is specified, domain is a domain name of the form com.companyname.appname.

I want to check for one variable that is within the first column of the query set is the same as the first colum in the data set and that the value is the same as the query set's first header.\nI just don't know how to do that because using COUNTIF(\"Raw::January::1st:31st\", $A2) works for making sure that one query condition. I guess the question is how do I filter COUNTIF so that it uses the second query as a check as well? I kinda want to do something like this, want it to only COUNTIF(January::$A:$AE,$A2, January::$A:$AE,\"$January::$A:$AE = B$1\").\nYou can take a look at the spreadsheet here ...\nhttps://www.icloud.com/iw/#numbers/BALRr1zYI0yyan4pV9yBoRCulAUCthE6_niE/Ask_Different\n\nSo what I want to do is check that the value of the cell is equal to $A2, and that the header of that cell is the day of the week I'm looking for as well.\n\nA: It's probably easiest to add another column with:\nAND(A1=1,B1=1)\n\nand then use\nCOUNTIF(Table 1::C,\"=TRUE\")\n\nYou can hide the extra column if you want by selecting the column's drop-down arrow and clicking \"Hide Column\".\nMinimal example: https://www.icloud.com/iw/#numbers/BAJy4qiGzoTh1VSmyA-BZ16VCStKBAKb9pSE/TEST (link will be removed in 1 week)\nPARTIAL SOLUTIONS:\nExample using Fudge Tables: https://www.icloud.com/iw/#numbers/BAI89SfR5AMJFjId3zyBzaZuxCGzy9uGo5eE/Fudge_Tables.numbers\nExample using Subtables: https://www.icloud.com/iw/#numbers/BAJMsEi-8NDWoPbLaxeBsLTzYZ2Mqnmqo5eE/Subtables\nNote that Subtables has a problem with zeroes (0000 translates to a number in the subtable).

Since using Migration Assistant to move from an old iMac (2009) to a new MacBook Pro, I find that I'm repeatedly asked for access to my Keychain. Prior to moving to the new machine, once I unlocked my Keychain, I was never asked for access to it again, but now I find that I'm often asked to provide the Keychain password. Sometimes this seems associated with periods of system sleep, but not always.\n\nAt first, I thought this was the result of the Keychain locking during sleep, or perhaps for some other reason so I made sure to adjust the settings for the \"login\" Keychain (using \"Change Settings\" in the keychan's context menu) so that it would not lock when the screensaver is on or after inactivity:\n\n\nHowever this only seems to have been partially effective. In particular, there's no way to make the same adjustment to the \"Local Items\" Keychain  so that preventing it from locking automatically is beyond my control:\n\n\nHow do I ensure that my Keychains remain unlocked once I've unlocked them? Why has this behavior suddenly appeared on my MacBook, when it was not present on my iMac?\n\nA: The Local Items keychain was introduced on Mavericks and holds iCloud keys for offline use.\nHowever, sometimes OS X will repeatedly ask you for the password. This can be solved by deleting the folder named with an UUID like A8F5E7B8-CEC1-4479-A7DF-F23CB076C8B8 from ~/Library/Keychains/ and then reboot.

I've just invested a long time fixing sync problems with my disks because of different case sensitivity problems\n\nA: A case sensitive file system is guaranteed compatible to store data from another case sensitive and case insensitive file system. Apple chose case sensitivity for Time Machine, so that it can incorporate backups from both types of file systems.\nExample:\n- Suppose you have a case sensitive file system, which has FILE1 and file1. You cannot copy those files side by side to a case insensitive file system, as the latter would see those files as one and the same file.\n- Suppose you have a case insensitive file system: you cannot create FILE1 and file1 side by side. So you can copy all your files to a case sensitive file system.\nThat is a good choice unless you do not want third party applications to find their files as they might not find them if typed incorrectly (wrong case).\n\nA: Case-sensitive and -insensitive filesystems under OS X are a mess (to say the least), primarily because some well-known and big software companies require their software to be installed on an case-insensitive filesystem. Otherwise these applications wouldn't really work because accessing IMPORTANT-RESOURCE.jpg would never work with a file named important-resource.jpg on disk.\nOn the other hand, for Time Machine backups, this is not really important because you will never run an application directly from your Time Machine drive. Using a case sensitive filesystem, in that case, covers both possible options without negative impact.\n\nA: While this does not answer your question as to why this may solve your problem in the future.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4046544\n", "Q: Why am I asked for my Keychain password when the keychain is already unlocked? Why am I asked for my Keychain password when the keychain is already unlocked?\n \nThis behavior started suddenly after migrating to a new machine.\n\nA: This happened to me after changing my login password. I fixed it thanks to article on Apple support: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6724601\nSimply I had to change password for my \"login\" keychain.\nBut I was asked to input password to open \"Local items\" keychain. I solved that issue exactly according this post: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203897\nYou need to open folder ~/Library/Keychains/, find and delete folder with name similar to \"A8F5E7B8-CEC1-4479-A7DF-F23CB076C8B8\" and restart your Mac immediately.\nI had to fixed both \"login\" and \"Local items\" prompt to solve it.

Any advice or a solution to my promblem?\n\nA: Phones are a bit tricky. On one hand, the manufacturer (Apple) should make it clear how to use the device, but since you get a no-service error that part of the equation seems working well enough. \nIf the device shows no service with several known good SIM, you might need to check with Apple or the carrier that originally locked the device to verify it's unlocked + test with an active SIM from that carrier. \nIf you can use the phone on wifi, it's activated (in the technical sense - activation is a specific step needed before the phone software starts to operate) and now you can focus on establishing cellular service and troubleshooting that portion of iOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3780\n", "Q: Upgraded to Mavericks, mini-displayport vga no longer works So yesterday I decided to perform the free upgrade to Mavericks, but when I came back today to use my computer, my external projector no longer gets a signal from my iMac.

Just bought an iMac with Mavericks pre-installed and some of my software isn't working. After looking into it Mavericks is causing quite a few problems.\nIs there any way of reverting it back to Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Older OS X versions might not include all drivers/kernel extensions required on current hardware so the general answer is No. \nApple has a nice article elaborating why this is a bad idea in general, but if you want to learn and have a backup of all your data, you could always try and see how far you get.\nAlso, just because your Mac shipped with Mavericks, doesn't necessarily mean that model isn't fully supported on an earlier version. You could check your exact model and determine whether your intended OS + Hardware combination is an exception to the general rule.\nAssuming your iMac is the one marketed by Apple as Late 2013 - they yes, it will support installation of OS X 10.8.4 - Build 12E4022.\nHaving said that, an easy way out would be to run Mountain Lion in a VM (both VMware and Parallels will do).\n", "Q: How to download pkg files from iTunes?

I tried both the quick test and the long test, together taking around an hour. \nSecondly I reset the PRAM. I'm fairly sure this did nothing to help my cause, but I put it here for a more complete answer. Hold down Command / Control / P and R, all at the same time as the computer is booting. It will reboot, at which point you can pull your fingers out of that weird position. \nNext, and I believe this to be the most important step, load Single-User mode on boot (Command + S). Once the command prompt is ready you should see somewhere in the verbose type above it a drive (something like /dev/disk0s2). What I did now was to use \n/sbin/fsck_hfs -f -d /dev/disk0s2\nThis debugged and fixed the drive in question, and upon using the 'reboot' command in single-user mode, the computer started up fine, and has been as good as gold since!\nRegardless, this has taught me to back up my drives and also reinstall my OS on a new HD. \nHope this helps anyone in the same leaky boat!\nSte\n", "Q: How to mirror a window?

However, all of my media management is done on my Windows 8 PC that connects to the NTFS drive via an SMB share.\nThe problem is, when I upgraded from 10.7 to 10.8, Apple seemed to have buggered up the SMB plugins, forcing me to use SMBUP (which works, OK ...)\nMy question is, if I upgrade my Mac to 10.9, are there any known issues with hosting an SMB share for Windows 8?

Mavericks still hasn't solved the multi monitor issue to my great distress. \nRunning a MacBook Air 13″ and a Cinema Display 27″ at times I use all the default provided Mavericks tools to monitor my applications on both screen.\nMy assumption was that:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I use text editor on the 13″ Mac mini screen, in fullscreen, it would appear fullscreen also on the 27″ Cinema Display\n\n*That if I would resize a window to fullscreen on the 27″ Cinema Display that it would appear full-size on the 13″ screen also (but no, its waaay bigger so I have to downsize it again)\n\n*I want it to behave so that my windows always have the right size on the display they are shown on. So if I maximise a window on the 27″, it should be maximised on the 13″ also. If I make it halfscreen size it should be half screensize on both screens.\nDo I misunderstand the features of multi window? This is just frustrating and I'm not plugging my MacBook Air to my 27″ anymore because of this issue. I don't like resizing the windows every time again!\nAre there tools to fix this?\n\nA: When you say \"full screen\", I'm assuming you're referring to the full screen button on the top right of a window, as opposed to the \"expand\" green button on the top left of a window. \nMavericks has \"solved\" the multi-monitor issue by allowing multiple and independent spaces on each monitor. In pre-Mavericks, when you move to a different space on one monitor, all other monitors follow. In Mavericks, they are independent, meaning you can move each monitor to different spaces without affecting the others. \nIn relation to full screen apps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Pre-Mavericks, going full screen would move one monitor to full screen and all other displays to a black/empty/useless space.\n\n*In Mavericks, all other monitors remain independent and free to access any of their spaces (allowing those monitors to remain useful).\n\n\nSo in response to your question\n\n\n*\n\n*Full screening an application on one monitor has no affect on the others, and full screening it on your mac mini screen, should not make the app go full screen on your 27'' screen.\n\n*When you maximize a window on one screen, and then drag it to another monitor, TextEdit does not resize itself to fill the screen (whether it be to shrink when going from your 27\" to your 13\", or grow, going to your 13\" to 27\")\n\n*Overall I'm a little confused about your frustrations, but you cannot make it so a window grows proportionally based on the monitor. What I mean by this is that you cannot make it so if you have TextEdit open on your 13\", and it covers 60% of that monitor, when you drag it over to the 27\", TextEdit won't automatically appear as taking 60% of the 27\" monitor. It will appear as the same size it was on the monitor you're dragging it from.\nThere are multiple 3rd party apps that help you manage and arrange your windows in Mac OS X that may help you. But as far as I am understanding, none that will help your issue, if you're referring to the top right full screen button.\nYou can use apps to help magazine your windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cinch:  http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/\n\n*Divy:   http://mizage.com/divvy/\n\n*SizeUp: http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/\n\n*Moom:   http://manytricks.com/moom/\nYou may like Moom the best, and it is described: Do you spend a lot of time moving and zooming windows, so you can better see and work with all the content on your Mac? Instead of doing that work yourself, let Moom handle the task for you.\n\nA: you guys need to use the right nomenclature if you wanna get anywhere. \nFirst of all, George you are talking about maximized windows and not full screen windows which is a different mavericks screw up all together. \nAnd brandon while everything you are saying is true about full screen, the fact is that it still retarded that you are forced to have a menu bar on each multimonitor screen even when you allow for \"Displays have separate spaces\" in System prefs ever since mission control was added in Lion.\nThis was all working perfectly fine on snow leopard. Steve Jobs is gone, it seems this company is gonna repeat history and go downhill. \nThere is no fix except for hacking in third party software to fix the myriad of mavericks annoyances just like we used to do for windows before we all switched over.\nI'd suggest ShiftIt instead of the suggestion Brandon made though for managing windows.\nhttps://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt\nit has hot keys for resizing windows without using the mouse to every quadrant or half of the screen. It can also jump a maximized window from one monitor to another with a hotkey and it will smartly keep the thing maximized to the new monitors resolution as George was originally looking for. \nRegards...\n", "Q: Switch to MacPorts SSH by default 10.8/10.9 I've installed the MacPorts high-performance variant of SSH (sudo port install openssh +hpn) but now I would like to switch the default ssh command over.

Would it break any programs depending on my home path?\n\nA: Only if you are on a case sensitive filesystem (which OS X supports, but doesn't enable by default) and the program was coded poorly, would it capture the exact path to your home directory. The vast majority of programs use the proper manner to find files relative to your starting home folder and are immune to even more drastic name changes.\nI say, back up your files and have a stab at changing the short name to your liking.\n\nA: It should be safe to change your username from John to john from within Users & Groups setting without having to make any further changes via command line.\n\nA: OSX uses a full name and an account name.

I've used keyremap4macbook to change : and ;, and \" and ' and have no issues on it, but it looks like the app only allows to change on some specific keys like ;, ', ?, {, etc. and not on those alphabetical keys.\nAlso, I got some video tutorials to modify those keys, but it doesn't work on Mavericks since the system preferences look a bit different than in the prior versions.\nSo is it feasible to remap my keys in Mavericks? And how can I modify it?\nThanks.\n\nA: The easy way to do this would be to use Keyboard Maestro and just create two macros, one for 'q' which inserts '`' and one for '`' which inserts 'q'\nIt also does a ton of other awesome stuff and is one of my favorite OS X utilities, but it’s not free (there's a free trial 30 days it’s ~ $35 IIRC).\nHowever, my guess is that you could also do it using KeyRemap4MacBook using the private.xml feature under \"Misc & Uninstall\"\n\nI am not qualified to explain what needs to be in the private.xml file, however, I can point you to the documentation for\nA simple example of private.xml which shows some examples and explains the format of the file.\nThere is also a free Mac OS X app Key Codes which you will probably want to use to help you find the correct key code values.\n", "Q: Can I get the source code from an IPA?

If this is not the case, it will insist that the \"problem\" be fixed or that the host name be changed to one that meets both these criteria.\nIn many cases, the simplest way to make that happen is to also turn on the DNS service and populate it with the appropriate zones and host entries for your LAN. Of course, you also have to configure your server and your client machines to point to your new name server, and the DNS service to forward requests to your ISP's name servers, etc.\nThis sounds tricky and error-prone, but so long as you make all the client changes in a new Location in System Preferences > Network it's really not bad.\nAn alternative approach would be to set the Open Directory server's host name to whatever.local… (At least, I think that is allowed.) I don't really recommend this route, though, unless you only want machines to be able to bind to the directory when they're on your LAN.\n", "Q: Late-2013 rMBP able to install & boot Win8 using EFI? I've previously installed Win7 (and then upgraded to 8) via Bootcamp, but I've been looking around some forums recently regarding running Win8 natively.\nI now have the impression that the latest-gen rMBP will install and boot Win8 using EFI as if it were a native OS. In other words, off an EFI partition and without BIOS emulation.\nCan anyone verify this?\nI read on a forum (the post was made several weeks previous and the user didn't respond when I posted this question) where a user reported that Bootcamp had installed Win8 on an EFI partition and that the bootup was so much faster.\n\nA: I can confirm that if Win8 is installed from an ISO (rather than a Win7 upgrade) then it will be installed on a boot-using-EFI partition.\n", "Q: Is it possible to define template files for the context-menu?

I did turn up a few threads back from 2011 and the iOS 5 release that claim the SMS limit is 75,000 messages.

I like the anti-aliasing while not scrolling just fine.\nThe image below has two Cmd+Shift+3 screenshots from within Preview, the top half with two fingers still on the trackpad after scrolling, the bottom half after releasing them. The boxed snippets were manually enlarged in Photoshop.\n\nI have disabled two-finger zoom and two-finger rotation in System Preferences > Trackpad, and unchecked \"Use LCD font smoothing when available\" in System Preferences > General.\nI have also set various defaults values, to no avail (the values below are just one combination of many I've tried):\nfor domain in com.apple.CoreGraphics CoreGraphics -g\ndo\n  echo $domain\n  defaults read $domain | egrep -i 'scal|smooth|alias|scroll'\ndone\n> com.apple.CoreGraphics\n>     CGFontDisableAntialiasing = 1;\n> CoreGraphics\n>     CGFontDisableAntialiasing = 1;\n> -g\n>     AppleAntiAliasingThreshold = 128;\n>     AppleFontSmoothing = 0;\n>     AppleScrollAnimationEnabled = 0;\n>     AppleScrollerPagingBehavior = 1;\n>     AppleShowScrollBars = Always;\n>     NSScrollAnimationEnabled = 0;\n>     \"com.apple.mouse.scaling\" = \"1.5\";\n>     \"com.apple.trackpad.scaling\" = \"-1\";\n\nI would like for scrolling to always look like it does if I scroll slowly, and vertically. The ugly anti-aliasing (blurring) is most likely to happen if Preview registers any horizontal scroll (which is rarely intentional), and was more prevalent before I turned off the two-finder scroll.\n\nA: I suspect the blurring of text is caused by a low-memory proxy being used to ensure high FPS during scrolling, especially on Retina machines, probably when using integrated Intel graphics. \nTherefore I would suggest doing the following steps in the below sequence, in order to maximize available RAM and VRAM:\n\n\n*\n\n*close all windows in all apps\n\n*quit all apps\n\n*disconnect any external monitors \n\n*close extra desktops in Mission Control\n\n*for machines with NVIDIA GPU, make sure your computer is plugged into the charger, or that Automatic Graphics Switching is turned off in Energy Saver\n\n*if on a non-Retina machine, set \"Best for display\" in the Displays settings\n\n*if on a Retina machine, set \"Best (Retina)\" in the Displays setting\n\n*restart the machine or open Terminal and type \"sudo purge\", the hit enter, then quit Terminal \nNote: the purge command takes a minute or two to finish. I've found it can really help to clear up RAM. Restarting does the same thing. Sometimes RAM does not automatically get freed up like it's supposed to without these steps, at least on 10.8.5 and earlier. It may not apply to 10.9 and newer, but it can't hurt to try. \nIf you would please, both before and after completing the above steps, open Activity Monitor and take note of how much memory, CPU, and disk data per second is being used. Post your before/after figures for Physical Memory and Memory Used in the comments (or Free memory if it shows that). Also let us know if the steps resolved your issue.\n\nA: This isn't a complete answer, but I read before that you could fix this by going to System Preferences > General and changing Show Scrollbars to \"When Scrolling.\" It seemed to work when I did it, but since then I've noticed it again, so it might not actually solve the problem. It does seem to have to do with it, though.\n\nA: I think CommaToast has the right idea. OS X is probably using a lower quality rendition of the content when scrolling, to ensure that it can move quickly and smoothly, then refining the image once you are done scrolling. I have absolutely no proof of this, but this type of behavior was extremely evident in early versions of iOS.  Apple loves image quality, but they love providing flawless interaction even more.\n", "Q: iPhone Vibrate Level Does the current volume for one's iPhone have any implication on how \"loud\" it vibrates?

Looking at the server showed that the files were still there.\nI then changed my connection type to SMB. This has worked well for me: Git no longer encounters file permission errors, and Finder (OSX 10.10 Yosemite) doesn't \"loose\" files.\n\nA: The error indicates that it can't write to .git/index, which usually means that it can't write to .git either.\nMake sure that you have permission to .git and recursively apply such permissions to the contents of the folder and subfolders, and new files that are created.\n\nA: I get this intermittently, and typing git status on the remote host fixes it for me.\n\nA: Although this answer may not satisfy your needs, Mercurial works on AFP volume without any problem.\nI've run into the same issue.

I can't listen to songs I want, and I can't move around with ease, it does it all for me.\n\nA: The stop sign shows that the file can't be played. This is usually due to a corrupt song. When the music app attempts to play one of these corrupt songs, it fails and skips to the next song. This is why you can't go back a song, since when you go back it attempts to play the song, fails, and goes forward (back to the song you started at).\nMake sure that the songs play in iTunes, then delete the songs from your device and re-sync them from your iTunes library, making sure that the sync is complete before disconnecting the device.\n", "Q: What is the difference among the various event schedulers for OS X / Darwin? I'm confused about the differences among the three (that I know of) tools for scheduling running of code on OS X / Darwin:\n\n\n*\n\n*cron\n\n*launchcd\n\n*pmset\nI understand that cron is largely deprecated, but it is still used by some utilities (like Super Super!, for some reason), and that pmset has the ability to wake the computer to run specific jobs. But I'm not clear what would guide the selection of one over the other in general.\nHow do these three methods OS scheduling differ (especially on Mavericks, if things are different there), especially in the kids of tasks they are suited to, and how they behave during sleep or hibernation?\n\nA: Use launchd instead of cron, at, or other legacy UNIX tools for Mac OS X.\npmset\npmset is a built-in command line tool for getting and setting power related values on Mac OS X. One of pmset's abilities is to add and remove entries from the IOPMQueue; the IOPMQueue is the IOKit level queue that allows your Mac to power on and wake up at a specific time. IOPMQueue also supports scheduling of shut downs and restarts.\nArbitrary code can not be scheduled using pmset or through the IOPMQueue.\ncron\ncron is a stalwart of the task scheduling world. However on Mac OS X, using cron is not recommended. Use launchd.\ncron is implemented by checking each minute for tasks that are due. This allows for a powerful and expressive scheduling format but at the cost of needing to wake the processor up every minute.\ncron does not know about your Mac sleeping. If a task is due while your Mac is asleep or powered off, the task will not occur. When your Mac powers back on, the task will not be performed because the minute in which it should have run has passed.\nThere are other tools that build upon cron and can run missed tasks upon waking. None are included by default with Mac OS X.\nlaunchd\nlaunchd (launch daemon) is Apple's system starter, scheduling tool, and process watchdog. launchd is written for the needs of the operating system first and users second. It is a powerful and capable process used to manage or launch almost every other process on your Mac.\nlaunchd is an improvement on cron for scheduling because it does not need to poll to perform tasks. Instead launchd can remain inactive until the moment a task needs performing. In an era of energy aware and mobile computing, this is important.\nlaunchd will not wake a sleeping Mac to perform tasks.\nlaunchd job tickets are property list (plist) files. These files can be edited with a text editor or with a number of third party applications.\nlaunchd is recommended for, and is suitable for, most scheduling situations.\nThird Party\nThere are number of third party scheduling tools available on Mac OS X. They often provide a graphical interface or offer more features than are included in the standard Mac OS X command line tools. The tool I am associated with is Power Manager.\n\nA: pmset is low level stuff, and doesn't really control running of code specifically, at least not in any direct or intended way. It controls things like turning your Mac on or off at specific times, similar to the way that you can do in System Preferences »  Energy Saver. Generally speaking, you shouldn't ever need to use pmset for anything directly.\ncron is still there because… well, because Apple hasn't killed it off yet, despite having deprecated it ages ago. I suspect it’s because there are a few old-time Un*x folks still working at Apple who don't want to see it go. But, really, there's no real sense in using that if you can use launchd. IIRC cron jobs do not run if the computer was asleep when it was supposed to run.\nlaunchd is Apple's replacement for cron which adds a lot of flexibility to the scheduling of events on a Mac. This is the way that you should be scheduling events on a Mac. The best way to learn how to use launchd is LaunchControl, which is a US$10 app with no DRM, no license codes, and no restrictions. (The developers rely on the honesty of their users to pay the registration fee if they use the app.) Not only do you get drag-and-drop functionality of bringing in various elements of launchd plists, each one is documented so you can see exactly what it does. Highly recommended.\n", "Q: How can I make existing permissions apply to new files? I have an SSD that I have created two partitions on. The first is used for the OS X to install the OS (Mavericks) and the other to place all the source of code of my projects and data that I don't want to lose when I do a format. Both partitions are formatted as Mac OS X Extended.\nRight now everything is working fine. I have created a partition called Data and placed the files. I have edited Apache files to load my http://localhost from the right folder on the Data partition and do my development that way.\nMy only problem that when I create a new project and put the WordPress files there I cannot start using it if I don't go edit the permissions every time. I tried to use this command:\nsudo chmod -R 777 /Volumes/Data/\n\nand even though it works for the existing files it does not work for new projects, so every time I start a new one I have to do it again.\nDo you know if there is an adjustment I have to make somewhere in order to avoid having such permission problems? What am I doing wrong? Is this problem related to the format of the partition?\n\nA: That Terminal command only aplies to existing files as you might have guessed. And there is no modification to it so that it will set the permissions of future files right. It doesn't work like that.\nI think you might have a problem with your disk's ownership. Through your Mac's view, you don't owe that disk partition. You must set that right.\nAnd if you ask why the Terminal command works when I don't owe the disk, it's because of that sudo keyword in front of it. sudo initiates the most privileged user in a UNIX/Linux system, which is the root user, that it can pretty much do whatever it wants. Even if you're the admin user, you can't do everything on your OS; you must switch to the root user. It's basically a safety system in place.\nAnyway, in order to set your disk's ownership right,\n\n\n*\n\n*open a Finder window,\n\n*right-click to your external drive,\n\n*select Get Info\n\n*at the bottom, there must be a Sharing & Permissions section. Check to see if you are listed there. Otherwise add yourself to the list.\n\n\nAlso, besides your current problem, why did you partitioned the SSD into two? You said you did it not to lose your data when you format the OS but when a new Mac OS comes, it's exchanged with the old one when all your personal data stays intact. Besides a Time Machine backup would be much safer if you don't want to lose your data.\nFrankly, it's a personal choice and when you look at it as bits and bytes nothing really changes, but keeping the SSD as a whole would be much neater.\n", "Q: JBL Soundfly Air with multi-router AirPort Express WiFi I got my hands on a JBL Soundfly, but it shows some trouble when I connect it to my home WiFi, which consists of 2 first generation AirPort Express linked by a cable to create a shared network.\nThe AirPorts are set to 802.11n only (2.4 GHz).\nWhen I stream music from my iPhone via Airplay the connection gets disrupted a lot (noticeable audio gaps).\nWhen I attach another WiFi-Router to the network, and connect the Soundfly to that AP, it plays without problem.\nDoes anyone have the Soundfly running in a similar AirPort Express network and does not experience any problem?\n\nA: Turns out the JBL Soundfly officially only supports 802.11b/g according to this document (page 3).\nThis leaves me wondering why it apparently worked with the 802.11n network, or whether that was a problem with my test.

It was syncing for more than 9 hours with absolutely no progress until I cancelled it. There are around 500 pictures to import.\nThe cord is good. USB port works well. I have the most recent iTunes, iPhoto. Already tried to rebuild iPhoto library. Nothing helps.\nPlease advice.\n\nA: Deleting ~/Pictures/iPod Photo Cache and emptying the trash did the trick for me. \nJust to be clear,\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit itunes. \n\n*Go to your home folder in the Finder\n\n*Go to the pictures folder\n\n*Right mouse click on \"iPhoto Library.photolibrary\" and choose Show Package Contents\n\n*Move \"iPod Photo Cache\" to the trash.\n\n*Empty the trash.\n\n*Open itunes and run a sync\n\n\nA: executive summary: check to see if it's full\nI've been having this problem a lot lately, with OSX 10.9 and iTunes 11 on a 4th gen iPod Touch with iOS 6.  I think there are a few contributors in my case, that seem to combine to stall it, often at \"importing photos\" or \"preparing items\" in step 8 (will stall for hours until I kill it).\nOne issue is that when I plug it in, iPhoto opens to copy photos off.  I think the coordination between iPhoto 9.5 and iTunes may be buggy.  Sometimes there are no new photos, and iPhoto doesn't offer any particular path forward, so there's no way for me to tell it I'm done with the (non-)sync.  Meanwhile, iTunes seems to be waiting.\nAnother issue is that there are a couple photos and a couple music tracks that it has trouble moving over; these all work fine on one side or the other (ie Mac can play the audio, iPod can view the photo).  I've wondered if a wipe and restore might cure this, but haven't been willing to risk this yet (worried it might fail to restore the same way it fails to sync).\nThese combine to make sync'ing unreliable anyway, but I think my most recent troubles were triggered by a new issue:  the iPod was completely full, and iTunes didn't know this.  I was tipped off when it claimed insufficient space for a 21 MB app downloaded in iOS, and I checked the iOS settings/general/usage screen to see \"0 bytes\" listed free.  It had been filled up by me downloading podcasts to it that weren't being deleted -- I resolved this by manually deleting a bunch of them, and after a variety of sync attempts after that finally got it to complete.  Even after this, iTunes thinks there is 8 GB free but the device says 4 GB, so there's a disconnect there.  The way iTunes and iOS 6 handle podcasts seems clunky and is likely a factor.\n\nA: I would terminate the sync and use Image Capture to retrieve the photos.\nYou have a much faster import to get them to a folder and then you can also delete them and perhaps isolate one bad photo that hangs or just break up the transfer.\nOnce you have all the photos off, you could delete a problem photo or two or just clean up the camera roll and try syncing again in iTunes. You could also open iPhoto and do the import directly as it and Image Capture have a better interface for letting you know where the import process is hanging.\n\nA: I repaired privileges with Disk Utility while iTunes and iPhoto were NOT running.\nAfter this I could sync photos to my iPhone 5S with iOS 7.1 from my MacBook Pro with 10.9.2 with iTunes 11.1.5.\nTried all the other things like deleting the iPod cache folder in the Pictures folder, rebuild the iPhoto Database and all. These did not work and iTunes stranded on the \"Importing Photos\" step.\nHope this will help others!\n\nA: I had to change to the ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library directory and then use the following command to remove the cache:\nrm -r iPod\\ Photo\\ Cache/\nUse the tab expansion feature of the shell to get the above command line quickly by typing rm -r iP + [tab] to expand the command line.\n\nA: Using the Disk Utility app and selecting Repair Disk is what I tried first and that worked perfectly.\n\nA: Deleting iPod Photo Cache fixed the stuck sync for me.

Use at your own risk, etc.)\nYou probably can, but if there are conflicts between them, one of them will have to be the designated 'winner'.\nThe easiest way to do this is probably to run /Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant.app twice. Whichever one you run last will overwrite any of the existing settings from the other one.\nA more complicated way to do this would be to use rsync to move the files to the same destination, however it should be noted that rsync is one of the Un*x tools which is hugely powerful and very easy to misuse to disastrous effect. Be sure that you have a separate backup of these files before you try to use rsync on them.\nA third option would be to use Transmit which has the ability to move folders and merge them.

I am having trouble setting up a Time Machine backup to a shared network drive. I have an external drive plugged into a MacBook Pro (MBP), and I want to use Time Machine to remotely back up a MacBook Air (MBA) to it. I followed the instructions in “Can Time Machine back up to an external HD connected to another Mac?” but Time Machine will not present the remote drive as an option.\n\n\n*\n\n*The drive is formatted properly. I have an identical partition to which the MBP does a local Time Machine backup.\n\n*The drive is shared properly. In fact, the MBA can see and mount the remote drive.\n\n\n*However, the partition is not shown as a potential Time Machine drive.\n\nFinder can see and access the drive, so why can't Time Machine? Is there a bit somewhere I can flip to tell Time Machine to see it? \n\nA: I know its an old post, but hopefully this will help anyone looking into the issue. Disabling SMB will work, but isn't necessary.\nOS X now uses SMB as the default connection (see here: http://www.cnet.com/news/os-x-mavericks-switches-to-smb2-networking/), and SMB doesn't work with Time Machine.\nYou can either disable SMB, thus forcing the mac to connect with AFP, or you can use the Finder 'Connect to Server' button under the Go menu, and force AFP as the protocol. I.e. afp://myserver.domain\nTested under Yosemite 10.10.3\n\nA: This answer is from 2013. Recent versions of macOS prefer SMB for Time Machine. AFP isn't really used for anything anymore.\nFor Mac OS X 10.5-11 (before Sierra)\nWhen you click the \"Options...\" button in the File Sharing preferences, is \"Share files and folders using AFP\" enabled? Time Machine over the network requires AFP, so it won't work if only SMB is enabled.\nYou may also need to disable SMB. I am not exactly sure why this is the case, but sometimes the SMB share takes priority and Time Machine can't seem to see the AFP share. Note that this will prevent Windows clients from connecting to file shares.\n\n\nA: Our situation was that Time Machine could not see an SMB-attached drive even though the SMB drive contents could be otherwise accessed from that same MAC.\nToday I was able to have a Time Machine backup created but by using Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), not SMB.\nTo do this, I took the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off Time Machine using system preferences, Time Machine, unclick “Back Up Automatically”\n\n*Disconnect from the SMB-attached network drive\n\n*Clean out the keychain of all “Time Machine” references using Keychain Access.  Make sure you look in Category \"All Items\" and delete from Keychains under \"login\", \"System\" and \"Local Items\" all keychain entries related to:\n\n\n*\n\n*the IP address of the SMB-attached drive\n\n*the name of the SMB-attached drive\n\n*the words \"Time Machine\"\n\n*the word \"sparcebundle\"\n\n\n*Try to create a Time Machine backup using SMB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a Finder window: Go, Connect to Server\n\n*In the Server Address box, type in \"smb://aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd\" where aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd is the IP address of the network-attached storage.\n\n*Using Time Machine Preferences and hit the \"Select Disk\" button\n\n*If the SMB-attached drive is visible, then select that drive. \n\n*If applicable, select to encrypt the backup\n\n*If the backup is made, then you are done\n\n\n*But if Step 4 was not successful, try to create a Time Machine backup using AFP (Apple File Protocol):\n\n\n*\n\n*Redo steps 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n*Using a Finder window: Go, Connect to Server and in the Server Address box, type in \"afp://aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd\" where aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd is the IP address of the network-attached storage\n\n*Using Time Machine Preferences and hit the \"Select Disk\" button\n\n*If the AFP-attached drive is visible, then select that drive. \n\n*If applicable, select to encrypt the backup\n\n*If the backup is made, then you are done\n\n\n\nWe now have a backup created using AFP and although it is not a sparcebundle it seems to be running fine.  At some point in the future, I plan to disconnect from the network-attached storage and reconnect to it with SMB as it is my understanding that SMB is current Apple protocol choice for creating a Time Machine backup over a network.\nIf anyone knows what might be the root problem on why AFP was successful and SMB was not, I would appreciate some advice.\n\nA: Because your Shared drive is not a TimeMachine enabled shared volume.\nTimeMachine have special requirements using AFP as pointed out by gabedwrds thus thoses (eg. AFP Replay Cache) are not necessarily included with \"OSX Client\".\nYou should enable a \"TimeMachine Server\" in order to share an external disk accross the network.\nYou may try using the Terminal if you are not prepared to buy \"Server.app\". But you're talking about data backup therefore you want to be sure about consistency and recoverability ! Other backup solutions such as the excellent \"Carbon Copy Cloner can achieve this without the \"Server.app\" and you may get free of charges similar results by using the rsync command from the terminal or using Automator.app…\nIf you don't care about using an unsupported solution and you are willing to take the risk of being in the so called \"poo\" :\n• Either show unsupported network volumes :\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\n\nAnd then have a look in your TimeMachine system preferences…\n• Or inputing the shared volume name manually therefore in your case\n   type in the terminal :\nsudo tmutil setdestination /Volumes/MBA\\ TM\n\nThen start your first backup :\ntmutil startbackup\n\nHow to make Time Machine backups over network without OS X server?\n\nA: I've had this problem before. I was able to connect the drive directly and perform a backup. Once the backup was completed, I added the drive back to the network and mounted it remotely and my Mac could then start backing up to it.\nI'm not sure why this worked, only that it did work.\n\nA: I have just resolved my issue. My wireless has both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz.\nMy iMac that has shared drive Time Machine sits in 5.0Ghz. My MacBook Pro was at 2.4Ghz. That's why it couldn't find it.\n\nA: Make sure you are sharing with write access for the particular user you are logging into the remote  machine as.\n\nA: I had this exact issue with a Western Digital MyCloud drive. I had to log into the drive and go to the \"Settings\" tab. At the bottom there is an On/Off switch under \"Mac Backups\". I clicked the \"Configure\" button to the right and selected the folder I wanted to enable. Works fine now!\n\nA: I found most of the above solutions too complicated.  Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Went to Finder/Go/Connect to Server\n\n*In the Server Address box, typed in afp://xxx.xxx.x.xxx (where x was the address of my Synology DS1815 NAS) and hit the \"+\" button to add it as a Favorite Server\n\n*Returned to Time Machine Preferences and hit the \"Select Disk\" button\n\n*Chose the Synology NAS which was now visible\n\n\nA: Add your NAS disc manually.\nsudo tmutil setdestination -a smb://<backup-annount>:<password>@<ip address ot hostname>/<path>\n\nIf you provide correct account, password and path then a disk will appear in Time Machine settings.\nThis works in macOS Ventura 13.2.1.\nI run into this problem when purchase new Mac. Other two still see and makes backups. But new Mac didn't show shared disc in Time Machine settings even when I mounted it.\n\nA: I have had the same problem with my new Mac (Mavericks).

Unfortunately after i removed the drive, all my tracks in iTunes show the exclamation mark. Is there any way to tell iTunes \"Hey, now all the tracks are here again\"? Get info or play works for individual tracks, but for 20k+ tracks it's a hassle. I haven't tried iTunes track CPR because it needs a very ordered library folder (mine does not strictly follow the Artist/Album/Track file hierarchy) and I'm afraid it might damage something.\nI would gladly use another music app, but iTunes is the only way to sync songs to my iPhone.\n\nA: First, go to Preferences > Advanced, and uncheck \"Copy files to iTunes Media Folder.\" For whatever reason, that seems to be necessary to get it to search for missing files. You can re-check that option when you're done.\nYou have to get iTunes to recognize that tracks are missing. The only method that I know works is to select the first track, hold the down arrow on your keyboard, and scroll all the way through. This should check each track as it is highlighted and mark it with that exclamation icon.\nThere may be a better way to do that…\nOnce iTunes recognizes multiple tracks are missing, select one, and get info. It should notify you that the track is missing. Find the file for that one, and it should then ask if it should search for other missing tracks in the same location. It may take a long time, depending on how many tracks it has to go through. Just let it churn away and it should eventually come up with a message saying \"X items were found, X items could not be found,\" or something like that.\nI've done this many times, moving old items to a network storage drive.

Ctrl+← and Ctrl+→ will work if you have spaces. To make a new space bring up Mission Control and hover the mouse in the top right, a + button will appear.\n\nA: To display mission control, the trackpad shortcut is a four fingers swipe up (or three fingers according to the system preferences you set for your trackpad).\nYou can also hit the F3 key (without pressing 'fn' key) to display mission control.\nThen, you should see all your windows. If you bring your mouse curser in the upper right coin of your screen, you should see a small rectangle with + sign: clicking on it will create a space.\nIf you want to go from a space to another, you can use ctrl+left/right, but you can also use your trackpad with four fingers swipe left/right (or three fingers).\nYou can configure the way Mission Control is brought to front in your System Preferences > Mission Control or Trackpad sections.\nIf all of this does not work, then you may have another problem.\n\nA: Spaces is gone, so you will need to open the mission control app and get situated to the changes. \nIf you can't go into Mission Control, you can't create new screens since there is no longer a pre-defined grid of empty spaces waiting to be used as before.  Not being able to get into Mission Control seems to be the root of your problem.\nOnce you can enter the program, you can make additional desktops on demand and only then switch between them.  \nAlternately, you might test this further by taking an app full screen, as this should essentially create a new space for it.  Now try to switch between them using any other methods on this page.  If it won't go full screen, you have a problem.  If it will, but it won't switch, then this is an additional (or perhaps another symptom of the same) problem.\n", "Q: Export Wi-Fi passwords from keychain I want to export all my Wi-Fi passwords and import it to the keychain of my girlfriends Mac.\nIs this even possible?

It is still in the warranty, so what should I do?\nEDIT: after 5 months and a substituted logic board the problem remains. So this discards the temperature hypothesis.\n\nA: Your issue is in Macbook's powering.  \nIf you unplug the power adapter and then reinitiate connection to the monitor by either turning the monitor on/off or replugging the Display Port cable, you'll see signal restored.\nAfter that you can plug the Macbook's power adapter back again and it won't turn black for hours or even days (unless you use cheap \"Chinese\" power adapter -- that can blackout every 30 minutes or so). The only issue remaining is that if you use custom calibrated color profile after such reconnection the color profile resets and you have to open Monitor settings and just open the Color tab to reapply settings -- you probably can make an Automator script for that routine and bind a keyboard shortcut.\nI've noticed that monitor can go black when my fridge in the next room turns on, so it's definitely about power.

I currently use the Beamer app (MacBook) to stream them across however I was hoping that I could create a nice looking library of videos in iTunes and stream them that way instead. \nI do not need these videos to be able to play on any iOS devices, so is there any way that they can be converted to .M4V/.MP4 without loss of picture or sound quality?\nI've tried few apps such as Subler - I can seem to keep picture quality however the audio is definitely poorer. My videos tend to be 1080p HD with DTS. \nCould anyone prehaps offer any solutions for full quality video streaming in iTunes?\nMany thanks!\nDan. \n\nA: MKV and MP4 are not video format, they are containers. An MKV can contain any type of video/audio stream.\nMost of the time, MKV contains H264/AC3 DTS (video/audio; the most common format in blu-ray).\nThe official specification of MP4 do not allow the AC3 format for the audio channel, but the H264 format is possible for the video. Thus, you can convert losslessly an MKV to an MP4, for the video channel only. The audio channel will have to be re-encoded\nI recommend using ffmpeg (a command-line tool) to achieve this goal.\nNote: You can try and create an MP4 containing AC3, but I don't think it will work in iTunes or the Apple TV, even though players like MPlayerX or VLC will be able to play them.\n\nA: You can't Google this topic without coming across Handbrake, a terrific free tool for re-encoding into all sorts of containers/formats.  Frizlab's answer for ffmpeg is spot on for the lossless conversion, but I'm still a big fan of Handbrake (HB).  You can add several audio tracks easily (I'm sure ffmpeg can do this somehow too), include subtitles, etc.  Handbrake does include presets for just about ALL Apple devices, but the only problem I've had is trying to encode something that will work in ALL of our devices.\nHB's MP4 setting does support AC-3 passthru audio, or a 5.1 AAC channel, which will work terrfically with ATV.  However, I recently tried loading some of those AC-3 files on my iPhone 5 and iPad 1, and they didn't work.  Turns out that you need to include an AAC audio track in addition to the AC-3, and it needs to be the FIRST track.  Encode like this, and you'll get something that plays well on ATV (in 5.1) and on your portable iDevices too.\nExperiment around though, like with just encoding a few minutes, or a chapter if that's possible with the MKV files you have.  There's nothing like being able to play any of your movies on the big screen, or take them with you to the gym!\n\nA: I use this:\nhttp://www.emmgunn.com/mp4tools/mp4toolshome.html\nTo convert the audio without transcoding the video. It is trialware so you can't lose if you don't like it.\nFFMPEG from the command line is not for the faint of heart. And ffmpegx is just about as complicated. I have spent a lot of time with both of these and they are definitely geek tools. \nMost if these transcoders and the ones like Pavtube use FFMPEG to do the work and they are just a GUI for it. FFMPEG is open source but the GUI front ends for them are not (except Handbrake).\nAll that said, Handbrake is the easiest way to convert files to play on iTunes or AppleTV but it has no facility for video passthru. You can set the quality similar to what you start with but no matter what, Handbrake will re-encode the video.\n", "Q: How can I speed up rate at which dock appears on second screen? How do I speed up the time it takes for the dock to appear on a second screen in Mavericks?\nAt the moment it takes over a second when I've been using it on the first screen then go to use it on the second.\n\nA: Try something like this in your terminal. \n defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.3; killall Dock;\n\nWhere the number 0.3 is, you can insert the number of seconds you want the animation to take.

Can I use pmset or a utility like Power Manager to have a task (such as an arbitrary script or backup) run at a specific time while my Mavericks MacBook Pro's lid is closed? Are there perhaps pmset settings I need to change to make such a thing work?\n\nA: While the lid is closed, a pmset wake will only wake up your machine very briefly, after which it will go back to sleep again. To keep the machine awake long enough to preform a task, you can caffeinate the machine for the amount of time (in seconds) you expect the task to take. For example, to keep the machine awake for 2 minutes, simply add\ncaffeinate -t 120 &\n\nearly on in the script that runs your task.\nAlternatively, caffeinate has options for tying the duration of the forced wake period to the completion of the task, but this runs the risk of keeping the machine awake indefinitely, so a safer bet is this expected-time-based approach.\n", "Q: Screen sharing suddenly stopped working For years, I've used screen sharing to connect my MacBook to my iMac. It has always worked like a charm. About a month ago, it stopped working. I can still see my iMac in Finder when I'm on the laptop. But when I try to connect, I get the \"busy\" bar for a minute or two, then a message telling me I needed to enable screen sharing on the iMac.\nScreen sharing is enabled; I never changed the setting, and I've double checked that it is still clicked. I can screen share via my MacBook with my husband's iMac across our home network, so I think the problem rests with the iMac, not with my laptop. I have tried sharing via VNC. I have tried logging out of Mobile me on the laptop. I have tried a screen sharing app. Nothing works. Can anyone think of anything I haven't tried?\nI'm running OS X 10.7.5 on the iMac.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall -> Firewall Options and remove anything in the list box lower section that has to do with screen sharing. You can remove an item by highlighting it then clicking the minus button below the list. Click Ok.\nNext go to System Preferences -> Sharing and uncheck Screen Sharing.\nReboot. I don't know why this is needed and I hate that it is, but it didn't work for me to do this without a reboot.\nThen go back to System Preferences -> Sharing and recheck Screen Sharing.\n\nA: Check the settings for Remote Management under System Preferences -> Sharing -> Remote Management. For whatever reason, I had an update cause the same issue on my 10.7 machine, and Screen Sharing no longer worked anymore. Under Computer Settings, you can give it a password if you like. Checking Remote management should check the Screen Sharing box for you also.\n\nA: I've had Screen Sharing on the server side freeze up on me numerous times under Lion (10.7), leaving me unable to sign in to that machine for various reasons, including a login screen that I couldn't interact with and symptoms similar to yours.  Restarting the machine appeared to be the fastest way to get it working again.\nSince I moved my screen-shared machines to Mountain Lion and Mavericks, I've had no further problems.  I suspect Lion's implementation of Screen Sharing is simply buggy.\n", "Q: How to watch/run videos served by KA_Lite server on iPod touch?

I would like to have access to AFP Share from our clients possible as soon as the server's system is started, without one of the users needing to open a local session on it (on the server) first.\nI'm not sure but I think it was working this way with previous versions of OS X (10.6 or 10.7, we're running the latest 10.8) : as soon as you got the login screen on the server, AFP Share(s) were accessible on the network.\nTo be as clear as possible, I'm NOT trying to have the AFP Share automounted on the clients. I'm already using scripts and launchd for this, and it's working absolutely fine (with the obvious exception of the clients having to wait for a user session to be opened on the server for the Share to become available).\nThe server is a 2013 iMac and the disk being shared is a Promise Pegasus R6 (a Thunderbolt RAID drive).\n2014-04-09 : still the same with OS X 10.9.x, neither SMB nor AFP share are accessible before a user open a local session on the Mac computer acting as the file server.\n2015-09-08 : I gave up on this as it is no longer relevant for us, but ditto for OS X 10.10.x\n\nA: I would set up a user to automatically log in and lock the screen immediately with a password (or as close to immediately as you care.)

Why is this?? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. All advice for 10.8 does not seem to carry over to this new OS\n\nA: It worked for me in 10.9. You should be using -bool TRUE (not just TRUE), although it worked for me either way. Also, are you running it as two commands (killall Finder is a second command)? The only other thing I can think of is that cfprefsd might have the old setting (or lack therof) cached, so you may have to shut it down it first. If I understand the setup right, that shouldn't be necessary, but just in case:\nkillall cfprefsd\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE\nkillall Finder\n\n\nA: To answer your question, you can also use YES or NO as the boolean flags (See below). I have been using this setup for a few years now, and it does also work in Mavericks.\nI have my computer setup such that I created an Automator workflow that runs the following shell script:\nSTATUS=`defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles`\nif [ $STATUS == YES ]; \nthen\n    defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO\nelse\n    defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\nfi\nkillall Finder\n\nI then used the Keyboard shortcuts panel in System Preferences to map a keyboard shortcut to this automator workflow to make it even faster.\nThe only downside to this method is that if you have a Finder window already open, it doesn't always reopen the Finder windows, but it's a much quicker way of enabling/disabling the showing of hidden files.\n", "Q: How do I enable/disable push notifications for an app on iOS 7? Apps will often ask to enable push notifications the first time they are run. However how do I change this setting after answering this? There doesn't seem to be a single thing in Settings about Push Notifications. The closest I can find is \"Notification Center\", but this just appears to customize how notifications appear, not whether push notifications are enabled or disabled for the app. This is a really confusing UI.\n\nA: So far the only way I've found to do this is to manually choose the alert style for the app in Notification Center. The default is banner, so enabling push notifications requires setting the alert style to banner, turn on badging, sounds and enable in notification center, and similarly disabling all these (banner style to none) to disable.\nI really wish there were a single on/off setting for this but there doesn't appear to be.\nUpdate: I got my wish. As of iOS 8 I believe there is now a single on/off switch to enable notifications for an app. This resides in the Settings->Notifications area under the specific app.\n\nA: There is an \"include\" and a \"do not include\" section in Notification Center.\nTap \"edit\" at top right corner of the Notification Center. This allows you to drag apps around in the Notification Center.\nHold the app you want to stop push notifications from, by the lines on the right hand side to its name, and drag it into \"do not include\" section. It will automatically close all banner settings for the app, and voila! You are good to go.\n\nA: If you go into \"\"Settings\"\nThen \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\"\nThen \"Fetch New Data\"\nThere's an option to turn Push off and on there, I think that effects all apps since I have some that complain that push is turned off when that option is turned off and they don't when that option is on. I could be wrong though\n\nA: I had this problem when I wanted to enable push push notifications for my Amazon app in order to get alerts of when my package was delivered or when my package is being shipped. I selected them to be disabled when I first downloaded the app, and couldn't reenable them when I had the after.\nThe only way I was able to reenable the push notifications for my Amazon app was to delete The app and re-download it from the app store. \nHope that helps...it sucks we have to erase and redownload an app just to enable push notifications.\n", "Q: Where do I get a product key and ISO for Windows 8 Boot Camp?

I've started to get strange artifacts on my 2010 MacBook Pro after updating to Maverick's. I'm not sure if they occur systematically -- I am running a CPU intensive script this time, but have run the same script before without issue. Restarting seems to fix it.\nFrom other posts, it sounds like it most likely is a graphics card issue, but I was wondering if it is potentially an issue relating to the Maverick's update, rather than a graphics card problem.\n\n\nA: I am having precisely the same issues with the same MacBook Pro, a 2010 15\" 2.4GHz i5.

If i now clear my iphone 4 completely will I lose the new photo stream with the photos that im trying to save?\n\nA: As long as you don't remove the Photo Stream photos or albums from your iPhone 4, no it doesn't.\nSince your Photo Stream photos and albums show up on all of your devices, whatever changes that you do on the albums will be reflected everywhere else. In this case, if you delete the Photo Stream album from your iPhone 4, your iPhone 5c will lose access to said album, too.\nIf you still feel uncomfortable deleting your photos, backup your photos to your Mac or Windows PC using iTunes, then delete the photos.

Is Soundflower 1.6.6 compatible with Mavericks 10.9?\n\nA: I just fixed the latest code from cycling74's github (1.6.7) to build it and run it on Mavericks.\nYou can get it at https://github.com/crmne/Soundflower/releases\n\nA: at first I thought that no, doesn't work for me.\ndeeper investigation revealed that indeed it does work but somehow Mavericks install set the volume to 0, means all the streams were nullified. I spent at least 2h fighting this issue and finally found the setting in system Audio Devices (not system preferences)\n\nA: I just tried installing Soundflower 1.6.6 on 10.9 and it does still work. I don't know if there are some compatibility issues, but if there were some major issues they'd probably have released a new version already.\n\nA: If you check on RoaringApps you can see that Soundflower works fine on Mavericks. However, there's only one report stating that, so depending on your hardware configuration you might have a different experience.\n\nA: Sorry to be the first negative, but for me it does not work. Soundflower itself is working, but Soundflowerbed keeps crashing as soon as you want to change any settings.

Probably has to do with upgrading from SnowLeopard instead of using a fresh install. So if you want to upgrade the same way (SL > MAV directly) be warned: If you had a working Soundflower installation on SL do not try to upgrade to 1.6.6b, it's not going to work. Just stay with whatever you have, it's running fine.\nUninstalling and reinstalling didn't do anything to solve the problem. At least i recreated SOundflower 1.4.4 and the according .kext file from a TimeMachine Backup which works fine now.\n\nA: No - Soundflower has quit working for me in 10.9.5 using 1.6.7 version of Soundcloud.  Worked before in Mavericks but now has a lot of audio feedback.  When channeling clive, you can't understand what people are saying.  \nI use it sometimes to record a video that is on screen with Quicktime.\n\nA: The best answer is Yes and No, it works completely but it causes lag when changing the volume.  It can also send pretty cad digital to other apps so better to go without for that and use JackOSX.\n\nA: I finally found that Soundflower has to be selected as both input and output for it to work properly in Quicktime screen recordings.

This path has spaces in it which is why I used the quoted form of command to escape the string.  However, in doing so the path to the image changes to /~/PATH/TO/IMAGE and I'm very puzzled as to why it adds the extra \"/\" to the beginning of the string.  Because of this, the script does not run as expected.  How can I escape the path but keep it from adding the extra \"/\".

After installing Mavericks, I discovered snapshot.db (1.5 GB) file in:\n/var/db/systemstats/snapshots.db\n\nWhat is the use of that file? Is it safe to delete it?\n\nA: I filed a bug report with apple for the same issue. They responded that snapshots.db is intended to hold data for the last 3 days and reach 70-150 MB on most systems. However, on mine (OS X 10.9, iMac 27-inch 2.8 GHz i7, 8 GB RAM) the current snapshots.db file has now reached 2.12 GB and is still growing. No further help from apple so far - they apparently cannot reproduce the behavior.\nIt is possible to manually delete the file, which I did after my first one reached 1.76 GB. You can also replace it with an empty system immutable snapshots.db file, which prevents the system from writing to it, although you then get 'assertion failed' console messages every few minutes.\nI have no real use for this file; 70-150 MB would be fine, but the disk space it consumes on my system is unacceptable.\nI recommend you file a bug report with apple as well.\n\nA: Alternatively, you could disable the launchdaemon that spawns these snapshots and writes to that file. I did this on my  rMBP running Mavericks since the console was flooded with \"powerstats\" logs.  After I ran the following command, both the console log reports and the growth of the file you refer to ceased.\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.systemstats.daily.plist \n\n\nA: The systemstatsd daemon collect a selection of system statistics about system power usage and it usually runs unnoticed in the background. So generally, there’s nothing to concern.\nIf the database file gets too big (snapshots.db), it can be emptied when you stop/unload the service as per this post:\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.systemstatsd\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.systemstatsd.analysis\n\nthen flush the file by:\nsudo sh -c \">/private/var/db/systemstats/snapshots.db\"\n\n\nA: I can confirm that running\nsudo sqlite3 /private/var/db/systemstats/snapshots.db \"vacuum;\"\n\nwill compress the database down.  Mine went from 530MB to 74MB, conforming other postings here.  Thus, garbage collection or write damage on this database is probably a culprit.  I would venture that the more probable assumption is on a bad write, as my CCC could not write it over (nor could I copy it to another directory)\n\nA: At a high level, the file you listed is a binary database file used by the OS to track power usage, performance and sleep/wake data over time. Despite the general guidance to not delete anything from /var/db this appears to not cause undue harm if you were to delete that one file on occasion.\nThis feeds the new views of energy usage and perhaps might help with diagnostics if you have problems down the line and ask Apple to help diagnose the system.\nThe program that writes to that file (as well as associated files in /var/db/systemstats ) is systemstatsd.\nYou can use the systemstats --help command to get more details and read from that file if you are curious. The manual page I linked to is the shell of a manual page and the code is mostly undocumented by Apple other than the documentation that is build into the tool and accessible from calling it with the help option.\nIt's generally not safe to delete anything in /var/db since the system could depend on the files being coherent, but I've tested removing all contents of that directory by booting into Single User mode and the system seems to recreate things properly and handle any attempts to manually clean up these files.\nI wouldn't recommend deleting anything from sytemstats on a Mac you are not ready to erase and reinstall and you also might get odd information from Activity Monitor if you manage to get the database and log files in an inconsistent state. That being said, it looks like the system was programmed defensively to handle things going missing from that directory and not cause erratic operation in general if you do so anyhow.\n", "Q: Is it possible to copy text from image? Is there any tools to copy text from video's or images?\n\nA: You can upload the image to Google Drive and it will use OCR to get the text from it. Or you can use a specialized software like Abby Fine reader for more advanced work. \nThe quality of the text recognition will vary with image quality. I would use a screenshot to get texts from video. \nIn Google Drive, you need to set Upload settings below the cogwheel on the right top to „Convert text from uploaded PDF and images files“.  He will copy the recognized text in the document below the image. \n\nA: I often also want to quickly copy text from images and videos. However I wasn't able to find a good solution on OS X, as procedures like uploading to Google Drive are far too cumbersome.\nThis is why I developed Aristocrat, a simple app that performs OCR on a selected region of your screen. It's currently free on the App Store.\n\nA: You can use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for the job\n", "Q: Im trying to run a webserver in iMac but it doesn't work in port 800 Im trying to run a local web server Mongoose on mac, its default settings is listening on port 8080,I want to change it to 800 but it doesn't run mongoose once I changed it to 800. What seems to be the problem?\n\nA: You have to run as root to bind to the privileged ports (<1024). You can run Mongoose via sudo, but then you will have a web server running as root. Not a good idea!\nChanging user with run_as_user parameter also seems to be unsupported on Mac:\nMongoose[22361:507] The application with bundle ID (null) is running setugid(),\n    which is not allowed.\n\nWhy don't you pick a port above 1024 e.g. 8081? Then you can run as unprivileged user.\nFor troubleshooting you can run Mongoose in Terminal.app like this:\nsudo /Applications/Mongoose.app/Contents/MacOS/Mongoose\n\n\nA: The difference is that 800 < 1024, but 8080 ≥ 1024.\nPorts with numbers less than 1024 are privileged ports (google that) on Unix like systems, which means that only processes which run as root are allowed to listen to them.\n", "Q: Will the retina iPad Mini charge with non-certified cables? I just bought a retina iPad Mini. Tried 3 different cheap lightning cables, none will charge it. Tried with 12W and 5W USB chargers. It will only charge with the Apple cable that came with it. But these Chinese cables charge my iPhone 5 and old iPad Mini just fine. Did something change in the new iPad's lightning chip? I wonder if is is a widespread problem or just me.\n\nA: See this question for more info. In short, you're taking your device's life in your hands when you don't use legit products. You have a multi-hundred-dollar device, do not cheap out on the thing that's directing nontrivial amounts of electricity into it!\nAuthorized products aren't that expensive and you can be sure that you won't have strange things happen.\nNewer devices will straight up refuse to work without the authentication chip in the cable. Previous devices (and maybe iOS versions) would still charge, but display the error, or do so at a reduced rate.\n\nA: Yes, you have to use certified cables.\n", "Q: How do I request a read receipt when sending e-mail with Outlook for Mac 2011? I've been using MAC OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5. How do I request a read receipt when sending e-mail with Outlook for Mac 2011? \n\nA: Outlook:Mac doesn't have the read receipt feature.\nAnd, frankly, you shouldn't use read receipts.  Most mail clients can be set up to simply ignore read receipt requests.  If the mail client isn't ignoring read receipt requests, then it gives the reader a message asking if the reader wants to send a read receipt; many people select no.  The existence of a read receipt doesn't actually tell you whether your reader read your mail.\n\nA: To make Mac OS X Mail request a read receipt for every message you send:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal and run the following command:\ndefaults read com.apple.mail UserHeaders\n\n\n*If that command returns\n\nThe domain/default pair of (com.apple.mail, UserHeaders) does not exist\n\nrun the following replacing Name with your name and email@address with your email address\ndefaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{\"Disposition-Notification-To\" = \"Name <email@address>\"; }'\n\nFor example, the complete line could read\ndefaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{\"Disposition-Notification-To\" = \"Heinz Tschabitscher <sender@example.com>\"; }'\"\n\n\n*If the \"defaults read\" command above returns a line of values that starts with { and ends in }:\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight the entire line. It might read something like {Bcc = \"bcc@example.com\"; }, for example.\n\n*Press Command-C.\n\n*Type defaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '\n\n*Press Command-V.\n\n*Type '.\n\n*Insert \"Disposition-Notification-To\" = \"Name <email@address>\"; in front of the closing } character, replacing Name with your name and email@address with your email address.\nFor example, the line might now read\ndefaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{Bcc = \"bcc@example.com\"; \"Disposition-Notification-To\" = \"Heinz Tschabitscher <sender@example.com>\"; }'\n\n\n*Press Enter.\n\nA: Outlook for Mac does not support read-receipts\nPerhaps use your email provider's webmail application to request a read-receipt?\nFor Office 365, sign into https://portal.office.com, compose a message, click the ellipses to bring up message options, choose the \"Show message options...\" menu item, then click the \"Request a read receipt\".\nGmail might have a similar feature.\nI personally NEVER request read-receipts.  Furthermore, when requested to send read-receipts I always refuse :) \n\nA: There is a new app that let you integrate read receipts in apple mail, both incoming and outgoing ones. Check http://www.ireceiptmail.com ;) It does not work with Outlook though...\n", "Q: How to force OS X to give a different IP lease with DHCP? Is there a command line solution to get a different IP from a DHCP server? There are some solutions, like switching to BOOTP and back to DHCP, that will sometimes yield a new IP, but often the DHCP server will simply hand back the IP it just got back.\nWe're looking to create a log-out script that will change the IP of public computers at our school. We're using Websense filtering. Right now if a faculty member logs out of a computer, a student logging in right after wouldn't have to authenticate as they would get the elevated faculty member's access. Keeping the Websense timeout low minimizes this risk but is a pain for mobile users on the network.\n\nA: There is no way to do this from the client level, but you may be able to configure something in your router.\nIt's usually by design that a router will maintain a listing of the MAC addresses of the clients that it has handed out an IP address too, and when the timeout for the DHCP lease happens, it gives the same IP to the same MAC.  If there has been some lapse and the client isn't connected at the point the lease expires, they will very often \"reserve\" the IP address (or at least put it to the back of the lease queue) it did have just in case it requests another lease, and can therefore give it the same one again, on the proviso that it doesn't run out of IP addresses to give to active clients, in which case the IP will be recycled to a new client.\nRunning a manual DHCP refresh before your lease expires will likely pull the same details.\nOne potential solution, although this is at the server end, is to run 2 DHCP servers, each with half of the range available to them to assign out.  You can then write a simple client script that switches the DHCP server on the Mac, and then refreshes its lease.  You would need to ensure that each single DHCP server has a range large enough for all your clients, because there is the potential to have all your clients on 1 server in certain circumstances.\n", "Q: Time Capsule and Thomson modem/router Just got a new airport time capsule (2013 model). The time capsule is put in bridge mode and the modem/router from my ISP (thomson 585 v8) is doing the router stuff (dhcp, nat). Time capsule is connected to modem/router via ethernet cable (100mbit is the interface of the router). \nThe question is: if I put the modem/router to bridge mode (my isp's configuration gives the option to bridge the modem) and turn the routing stuff to time capsule will my network become faster? Does the 100mbit conncetion between tc and modem slow down things in the local network?\n\nA: If you connect to the TC (via whatever speed you can get with wireless, or gigabit cable) then your communication to it and any other device on teh same LAN that is also connected to the local LAN is unaffected, it is only when you wish to send traffic over the 100mbit modem connection that you will be limited to it's speed, so basically your internet will be limited to 100mbit, and so long as that is faster than your ADSL/Cable connection anyway, then you will never notice it.\n", "Q: Mac crashed after changing disk permission I'm facing a problem with my Mac Mini with Mountain Lion.\nWhen I changed my disk permission of Macintosh for everyone to no access my Mac crashed and and it's not restarting when I boot the Mac. It just stops after showing the Apple logo.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: If you just selected Macintosh HD and changed \"everyone\" to \"No Access\" and did not select \"Apply to enclosed items\", try to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start up in single user mode by holding command-S on startup.\n\n*Run mount -uw /. fsck -fy is not necessarily needed.\n\n*Run chmod 755 /.\n\n*Run reboot.\n\n\nIf that doesn't work, try to reinstall OS X from the recovery partition. It installs a new copy of OS X over the current installation while keeping user files and settings in place. It solved a problem I had where my Mac got stuck during the startup process. If nothing else works, try to erase and reinstall OS X, or erase the Macintosh HD partition (not the whole drive) from Disk Utility and then choose Reinstall OS X.\nIf you don't already have backups, try to save a disk image to an an external drive in Disk Utility on the recovery partition or copy files to an external drive in single user mode.\n\nA: Try booting with the ⎇ Alt (aka. ⌥ Opt) key down. You should see one or two disk(s) visible, one of them being the Recovery Partition. Select it, your computer should boot (but not on your usual desktop).\nFrom there, select Disk Utilities and try repairing permissions on your main disk. Try rebooting normally then, it should work.\nIf it's not enough, you should reboot on the recovery partition again and reinstall Mac OS X on your main disk (it won't erase your data; only the system).\n", "Q: How to update the program \"preview\"? Im Using Mac OS X 10.6.8 and I do regular updates via \"apple-symbol / Software Update ...\".\nFor Viewing an printing PDFs, I use a program called preview. The version installed on my computer is \"5.0.3 (504.1)\". On Wikipedia I found, that the current version is 7.0. How can I Update to this version?\n\nA: The version is linked to your OS level, you are using an older version of Preview because you are using an older OS.  The latest version is available as part of the latest OS.  Luckily, this update is now free, so long as your machine is compatible - looks for OS X Mavericks in the App Store\n", "Q: Advice on upgrading to iOS 6 from iOS 5 only I'm in need of updating the iOS on my device from 5 to 6 only (for test purposes). I already have iOS 7 on another device.\nDoes anyone know how this can be done?\nThe only option I can currently see is going to iOS 7 and then back down to 6. The problem I have is I don't want to find out it's not possible once iOS 7 is running.\n\nA: Nope, once you update to iOS 7, you can't go back to iOS 6, since Apple stop signing the old software when the new software is released.\nYou can only install versions of iOS that are currently being signed by Apple for that device.\nIf your device can't update to iOS 7, then it is still possible to update to iOS 6 since the latest viable version of iOS continues to be signed for those devices.\n\nA: Download the iOS 6.13 software (IPSW) from http://osxdaily.com/2013/03/19/ios-6-1-3-released-with-minor-fixes-improvements/ and use iTunes to install it. Then  don't update it to 7.0 when asked .\n", "Q: OSX 10.9 Mavericks VirtualBox unable to use Bridged Networking Since upgrading to OSX 10.9 Mavericks VirtualBox machines that have a Bridged Network have been unable to start.\nInstalling VirtualBox again solves the problem temporarily, but this does not survive a reboot (or in my case kicking the power supply cable out!).\nHas anyone come up with a permanent solution for this, or at least one that does not involve a fresh install?\n\nA: I've found a temporary solution.  It appears that on reboot not all the kernel extensions are loaded correctly.  However a restart of the VirtualBox startup item seems to resolve this and I can then start the machines.\nsudo  /Library/StartupItems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox restart\n\nIs the line that works for me, sometimes I have to run it twice.\n\nA: Unless I am mistaken regarding the issue here, simply enabling IP forwarding on the OS X host will resolve the issue:\nsudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu on iMac: graphics I have just got a new iMac 14.3 with 21.5″ display. It has Intel i7 processor and NVIDIA GeForce GT750M graphics card with GPU (Device ID: 0x00fe9). I have installed Ubuntu 13.10 on it (dual boot with refit). Everything works fine apart from graphics.

The weirdest thing is, that when I boot from a LiveCD, it picks up screen resolution and all the rest correctly, though when I install the system to my Hard Drive it clearly does not have proper drivers. I have checked it with lsmod and it seems that it pick up nouveau drivers in LiveCD mode — everything works fine then, but it does not in the install mode — get crap resolution. Also, I cannot load nouveau drivers manually. In case this is important, I have to boot with acpi=off option, as it does not boot otherwise. Does anyone have any suggestion how can I fix this graphics problem?\n\nA: The solution is actually very simple: just boot with nolapic instead of acpi=off.\n", "Q: How to run iOS app on device without attaching device to Mac? My client has an iPhone and iPad at his place and wants to check the app being created by us at our place.\nWe are able to check the iOS app on our registered iPhone by attaching it to our Mac and running Xcode with the proper certificate.\nThe client has provided the details for their device (the UDID and other details). Now my issue is that how can the client run the app on their devices?\n\nA: My team uses Test Flight for managing and deploying beta iOS applications. It's easy for both the developer and the tester to use, as it does all the provisioning and distribution for you. It also happens to be free to use.\n\nA: You need to add their UUID to your devices list on the developer web site, and then create an 'Ad-hoc' provisioning profile that contains your App ID and their Device ID (any any other device IDs you want). Now build and archive your app from Xcode, and choose 'Ad-Hoc' - if the option isn't available make sure you have a phone connected.\nYou'll end up with a .IPA file that can be emailed and dragged into iTunes for install. \nThis creates an app that is as about as similar to a Live app as you can get, so for example Push Notification will need to use the Live Certificate. If you're sending to a client, I would recommend you add one of your phones into the provisioning profile and try the iTunes install on a clean machine and on a phone with no development profiles installed, just to be sure it works.\nAs mentioned above, you can also use a 3rd party service to do this, but you don't need to and I never have, though it may well be easier.\nSee \nhttps://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/YourFirstAppStoreSubmission/TestYourApponManyDevicesandiOSVersions/TestYourApponManyDevicesandiOSVersions.html\nand\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/TestingYouriOSApp/TestingYouriOSApp.html for full instructions.\n", "Q: How can I restore my iPod touch using a different computer?

There was never any need to connect it after I first did to put my music on.\nHowever, I am locked out since typed my password in too many times incorrectly. I have access to my friends computer to restore it, but how do I do this?\n\nA: To restore your device…\n\n\n*\n\n*Put your device into Recovery mode\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn the device off\n\n*Holding the home button, connect it to your computer.\n\n\n*iTunes should prompt to restore the device.\n\n*Follow the instructions.\nIf you have Find my iPhone enabled, you will need to log in to iCloud and remove the device from your account before you can restore it.\n", "Q: Delete emails from server Mac Mail I have setup and email account on Mac mail.

One of the settings for the account is not to keep any messages on the server under the advanced tab in Mac Mail.\nHowever no emails are being deleted on the server once they are received on Mac mail client. \nAny clue on where I can check the problem?\n\nA: The only folders you can keep locally for IMAP are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drafts\n\n*Sent\n\n*Trash\n\n*Spam\n\n\nIf you want to empty other IMAP mailboxes, you will want to set up local folders on the Mac - use the built in help and search for \"Create Mailbox\" to get the steps to make a local folder so you can move all the messages there and then send a delete command to the IMAP server to actually remove them if they don't auto purge.\n", "Q: How to move data between iCloud accounts? For some reason when I first got my iPhone the iCloud was created under my mom's email. Now that she recently got an iPad all of my contacts, Photo Stream, internet favourites, etc are all on her iPad.\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is how to get rid of all my info off her iPad that doesn't involve anything getting erased from my phone. Eventually we need to create two separate iClouds, but how would you go about doing that when all the info is on \"her\" iCloud account?\n\nA: Here is a simple solution for getting your contacts at the very least. This is what I did from one iPhone to another iPhone.\nLogin to the iCloud account associated with the device you are trying to retrieve this data from.\nOnce you are logged in click on the contacts tab in iCloud. In the bottom left hand corner you will see a \"setting gear\". Click this and then click select all.\nOnce all have been selected, click the \"settings gear\" and click export vcard. Save as contacts somewhere you will be able to easily locate like your desktop.\nLog out of that account and log into the account you wish to transfer this data to. Once you are logged in to this account, click contacts and the \"settings gear\" in the left hand corner. Click import vcard, locate and select vcard imported from other account. You should now see your contacts transferred from one account to the next. \nYou will then need to click the \"setting gear\" again and click refresh contacts. Power off your device associated with the device you want contacts transferred and power back on. \nOnce everything is updated you should see your contacts on your new device.\nBest of luck!\n\nA: Long story short: you can't move everything from one iCloud account to the other.\nOh, you can do parts of it, but it will be slow and frustrating and aggravating, and even after all of that you still might not get everything, so save yourself the aggravation and take the easy way out instead.\nThe Easy Way\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new iCloud account for your mother.

Obviously something wen wrong long time ago.\nI am also missing files for a while and most probably they are in the oldest sparsebundle. \nHow do I access a specific sparsebundle and explore files in them?\n\nA: Might be easier to do it manually than try to persuade the Time Machine GUI to use a specific one (if that's even possible). Double-click the sparsebundle and it'll mount like any other disk image. You'll find the individually-dated backups under the /Backups.backupdb/(computer-name) folder.\n\nA: If you press the option key when selecting the Time Machine menubar icon, it should allow you to select a different backup disk (a different sparse bundle) to browse.\n", "Q: Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition (OS X) and Dropbox I was trying to share the saved games of Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition using Dropbox (on OS X). Configuration files are stored in\n~/Library/Containers/com.beamdog.baldursgateenhancededition/Data/Documents/Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition\n\nThe options file Baldur.ini should not be shared as it contains machine specific data but I tried to make the saves folder a symbolic link to a Dropbox folder but then data is not recognised.\nMy workaround is to manually copy the folder to and from Dropbox after and before playing but I would like to know if someone found a better alternative.\nEdit\nThe goal is to share the saved games between two machines using Dropbox (or another cloud storage server). Sharing the whole container is not an option as the settings file is machine specific.\nAs it seems that the question is not clear: How do I share Baldur's Gate saved games using Dropbox?\n\nA: It is because of the sandbox. If you will look in your console you will see errors like: ...kernel[0]: Sandbox: Baldur's Gate...deny file-write-data .../Dropbox/Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition/Baldur.ini\nlooking into how to allow this; I suspect that a hard link (instead of symbolic) would work. Best be sure you understand what that means before doing it.\nAnother way to do it would be to symlink the entire sandbox container for BGEE instead of linking a subpath. instead of a symbolic link for ~/Library/Containers/com.beamdog.baldursgateenhancededition/Data/Documents/Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition make one for `~/Library/Containers/com.beamdog.baldursgateenhancededition\nI haven't tested this with BG:EE, but I've done it with other sandboxes and it works.\n\nA: Can confirm that symlinking the whole container directory as Brad Allred suggested does work for BG2EE :-\nmv ~/Library/Containers/com.beamdog.baldursgateIIenhancededition ~/Dropbox/com.beamdog.baldursgateIIenhancededition\nln -s ~/Dropbox/com.beamdog.baldursgateIIenhancededition ~/Library/Containers/com.beamdog.baldursgateIIenhancededition\n\nJob done :)\n\nA: You can save files and folders in Dropbox even if they are outside the Dropbox folder. This is achieved with symbolic links in the Dropbox folder (you must use ln -s, for some reason Finder aliases don't work).\nYou could try something like this:\nln -s \"~/Library/Containers/com.beamdog.baldursgateenhancededition/Data/Documents/Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition/saves\" ~/Dropbox/baldur-saves\n\nMake sure to backup your game data before doing anything.\n\nA: I've tried the same think for BG2:EE on OS X (mavericks), but failed as well.\nFirst I moved the save folder to my dropbox folder:\nmv ~/Library/Containers/com.beamdog.baldursgateIIenhancededition/Data/Documents/Baldur\\'s\\ Gate\\ II\\ -\\ Enhanced\\ Edition/save ~/Dropbox/save\n\nThen created a symbolic link from the original save location to the new dropbox location:\nln -s ~/Dropbox/save ~/Library/Containers/com.beamdog.baldursgateIIenhancededition/Data/Documents/Baldur\\'s\\ Gate\\ II\\ -\\ Enhanced\\ Edition/save\n\nBut indeed the game does not find/recognize the saved games :(\n", "Q: How can I fix \"MTM fs Mount server failed to start because of error 15\"? For the last few weeks, I've been getting lots of recurrent MTM fs Mount server failed to start because of error 15 error messages in system.log. How can I diagnose and fix this?\nI don't know if it's causing any issues, but it's worrisome, and it's spamming the log file so I'm having trouble diagnosing other problems. Time Machine has also been wonky lately, failing to complete backups to external drives attached to my Time Capsule because it couldn't find the backup disk.

You do lose any backup intervals that are not on the actual destination, but you also get a working set. Lastly, I would run tmdiagnose to capture the failure before you clean up just in case it reappears and you can send both sets of diagnostic logs to Apple for analysis by engineering.\nsudo -s\ntmutil startbackup --rotation --block\ntmdiagnose\ntmutil disablelocal\nsleep 30\ntmutil enablelocal\nexit\n\nAt this point, you'll want to test a backup or two and repeat the tmdiagnose if you happen to reproduce the issue:\ntmutil snapshot\nsleep 15\ntmutil startbackup --rotation --block\nsleep 15\ntmutil snapshot\n\n", "Q: Automatic numbers superscripting in OS X Maverick and Pages 5 Is there any way to setup automatic superscripting in OS X Mavericks and Pages 5 (i.e 1st => 1st.\nIs there a 3th party plugin that implements that functionality?\n\nA: Not yet.

I have an early 2008 macbook that was running well until a week ago.  I noticed the battery was not charging anymore.  So I bought another battery for $20 on amazon.  I installed the new battery and turned on the laptop.  It was 69% charged on startup - so I waited until it fell to 0% and turned off on its own.  Then I plugged in the adapter to charge it, and although it is charging, I still see a sign that says \"Service Battery\".  \nDo I really need to worry about this \"Service Battery\" message even though it appears to be charging? \n\nA: \"Do I really need to worry about this\" is hard to answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you need to be able to use the MacBook for long periods of time when not plugged in, then yes, you probably do, because the battery that you have is probably not reliable.\n\n*If you mostly only use the MacBook when plugged into A/C power, then no, you probably don't need to worry about it at all. It will most likely work just fine for that purpose.\nDo keep an eye out to make sure that the battery doesn't start to bulge or anything like that. If it does, immediately remove it from the MacBook.\nAs an aside: MacBook batteries generally cost somewhere between $80-130, so I would be highly skeptical of the quality of whatever battery you bought for $20 off Amazon. Where by \"highly skeptical\" I mean \"I would not leave it plugged in and unattended when I was not at home.\" Which is probably me being overly protective, but as the saying goes, \"Better safe than accidentally burning down the apartment complex and/or neighborhood.\"\n", "Q: SSD upgrade for 15\" MacBookPro2,2? I'd like to upgrade my old MacBookPro2,2 with something like a 120 GB Samsung 840 Basic SSD. Does that make sense?\n\nA: I have a MacBookPro3,1 myself and have thought about doing this as well.  You will see a little bit of performance increase in boot time and overall usage by upgrading it.  In fact, ifixit.com may even sell kits for your computer's hard drive replacement.  It really boils down to do you want to shell out the cash, knowing that Apple will, if it hasn't already, cease to support your hardware.  Meaning that at some point, if it hasn't already, newer versions of OS X will not be able to be installed on your machine.\nI'm still on the fence about upgrading to a SSD on my MBP because I know that sometime in the next year or two I will probably get a new machine to replace it, along with my iMac.  If you have the cash, a better investment may be to sell your laptop and use those funds to buy a new one.

I have a late 2012 MacBook Pro 13\" non-retina display and I use Boot Camp to dual-boot windows and Mac. I recently came across an application called Parallels Desktop for Mac that promised faster and better performance to what I was experiencing when natively loading Windows using Boot Camp.\nI have used this software for a couple days and I love it, however I notice a big problem when it comes to gaming on it. What I am seeing is that when I play a Steam game (I.e. Skyrim or Fallout: New Vegas), when it tries to detect the default video settings it sets it to ultra high quality. This would be fine but the problem is, the game does not load at all unless I manually set it to low quality, yet, when I play the game natively, I can get away with using medium quality. My question is, what can I do to actually get the game to play at ultra high quality?\n\nA: Parallels will rarely be as fast as natively booting Windows via Bootcamp, especially when you're gaming. You're much better off ditching parallels and going back to bootcamp for gaming. By running the VM, you're limiting the amount of resources that are available to OS X and your VM environment; thereby, making each run slower. On some machines where a faster processor and large amounts of RAM are available, may speed it up, but it will never be as smooth as running it natively. \n", "Q: Stranger using my Apple ID for FaceTime/iMessage My iPad said someone is using my email to FaceTime and iMessage.

If you can no longer access your account, attempt to reset the password.\n", "Q: If I delete music from an iPad will it affect music stored on any other iCloud-connected device? Asking on behalf of my mother.\nThe music came on via iCloud syncing AFAIK so I wanted to make sure that removing it in one place wouldn't remove it somewhere else as we'll.\n\nA: It shouldn't effect other devices as iCloud does not automatically sync music between devices other than downloading newly purchased music to all devices if you have iOS configured that way. (Settings > iTunes & App Store > automatic downloads > music \"on\")\nThat automatic download is one way and one time only not perpetual. \n", "Q: Wine on Mac via Homebrew I installed a Windows application on my Mac after successfully installing Wine via Homebrew.

We have an old imac G3 DV 400 MHz (at the moment I do not have access to the machine and want to prepare for my visit.)\nMy goal is to save the data from the hard disk to an external drive and reset the machine.\nAccording to the user of the imac, it does not boot any more (screen stays black).\nAs it was not used for a long time, I assume that the PRAM battery is empty.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I necessarily need a working PRAM battery to boot the imac, or is there a way to save the data on the hard disk another way?\n\n*Could I access the internal hard disk in Firewire target disk mode? (maybe even with low battery)?\n\n\nA: Based on the link below, you will need to replace the PRAM battery to boot the iMac. You could always extract the HD, but then would have to find the correct interface to hook it up to your current computer.\nhttp://www.mercenary.ca/articles/fix_imac_g3_wont_start_problem.php\nThere are a few videos on youtube describing PRAM battery replacement.

The AirPlay button that one can use to switch where to send audio/video from an iOS device used to be found to the right of essentially all volume controls (In the Music app, Podcasts app, Safari QuickTime playback, etc). However, I recently noticed that this button is no longer appearing there.  \nPerhaps this change was implemented for iOS 7, but I had not really noticed it until very recently. Now it seems that Control Center is the only place with AirPlay controls. Is this the new and only way to access the AirPlay button?\n\nA: Yes.\nIt's the only place where the AirPlay Mirroring options can be accessed. Of course, AirPlay can also be accessed from the the player controls while playing a movie.\n", "Q: What does a .app file actually do? I'm brand new to Mac OS X (coming from Windows), and I'm trying to understand .app files. In Windows, we had executables (.exe files). If you opened one, your program would run, and any other files it needed were located elsewhere. In Mac OS X, as I understand it, these .app \"files\" are really more like folders that contain not only the executable itself but also other files that the app may need.\nMy question is, what exactly do these .app files do? How is it different from drilling into them and running the actual executable?\nRecently I was trying to get an app to run on OS X. I finally got it to work (seems like JAVA_HOME needed to be set). However, it only works when I drill into the .app folder and run the shell script that starts the app. If I double-click the .app file/folder, the app just bounces in the dock for a while, eventually stops, and nothing happens (other than the fans spinning like crazy). So clearly the OS is doing something different when it tries to run the app from the .app file vs. directly from the executable within.\nI'd like to understand what exactly the .app is doing that causes this app to not run so that I can work to fix the issue. FYI the app is Oracle's SQL Developer.\n\nA: \"apps\" are \"Package Bundles\" is Apple jargon, and are treated specially by the OS.\nAs mentioned above, these are actually Unix directories, in a special format. The actual Unix Executable File is in a subdirectory named MacOS, which you can see using the \"Show Package Contents\" menu in Finder.\nThe \"app\" is analogous to the directory created when you install a Windows program.\nYou can indeed navigate into the app, and run the Unix Executable File.\nFor more complete details see the Apple Bundle Programming Guide It is in the archive section but Apple's new documentation does not give the overview\nThis doesn't solve your problem, but without knowing more about the app it won't be solved by manipulating the package. You will need to contact the developer.\nYou could also look at the Console app, which will let you examine any error or warning messages.\n", "Q: I need a pdf reader for my 4th Gen iPod Touch iBooks will not download to it, as it requires OS7,which the iPod 4th Gen cannot accommodate... I downloaded Adobe Reader, but can't locate the file on my iPod for it to open (when it's attached iTunes tells me the file is in \"Books\", but I can't find \"Books\" on the iPod itself)\n\nA: As of version 4.4.1 (current latest version), Documents by Readdle only requires iOS 6, and therefore should work on your device.\nThe books in the iTunes books section will only sync with iBooks. Simply un-sync that section, since you don't have iBooks installed.

Numbers seems to have no problem with dates.\n\nA: After some searching and trial-and-error, I have identified that the issue relates to the absence of a key file: com.apple.HIToolbox.plist, which for some reason is not created when setting up a new User account (and may not be copied across if importing from another computer). Luckily this file is created when opening the Guest account, which can then be copied across to all required User accounts.\nHere is a detailed summary of the procedure I eventually used to fix this date format issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create and open a Guest Account (if not already enabled, go to Users\n& Group Preferences)\n\n*Go to the Library folder (it’s a hidden folder,\nso to find it, use Finder to go to the home folder, then select from\nthe menu ‘Go:Go to Folder’ and type in ‘Library’)\n\n*Go to the\nPreferences folder \n\n*Make a local copy of the file:\ncom.apple.HIToolbox.plist (e.g. onto an SD card, or external/cloud\ndrive) \n\n*Now open your desired User account \n\n*Go to your Library folder\n(again it will be hidden, so find it as above) \n\n*Go to the Preferences\nfolder \n\n*Copy the file: com.apple.HIToolbox.plist (from local storage)\ninto this folder \n\n*Quit Excel and then log out of your user account,\nand then log back in \n\n*Next time Excel starts, UK date format will be\ncorrect!\n\n\n(Source: \nhttp://www.yellowsbest.com/solved-uk...excelmac-2008/)\n", "Q: Remove header columns in Page 5.0 In the new iWork Pages, there is by default 3 cells or columns in the header and I cannot remove the column back to its original one column header just like the normal header in Pages 09'.\nIf you see that in the image, it is NOT a table, but the header when the cursor hover on it.\n\n\nA: In fact what Apple did here is better than before : \nIf you write in only one of these 3 columns it behaves as if there were only one column. \n\n\nA: When you go to print, \"truncated\" headers will appear in their entirety on the printed page. It's just a glitch in the editing environment.\n\nA: It helps to insert a text box in one of the cells. You can adjust its size, background, all styling and so on. The best thing is that this text box \"overlaps\" the header so it does not get truncated.\n\nA: If you have a header that spans more than one column, and choose to stage your headers  - i.e. a different header on different \"chapters\", then your headers are truncated only to the width of the \"cell\".\n\nA: The only \"fix\" I've seen that works is to copy an old '09 document and open it in v5.\n", "Q: how to stop downloading a game in itunes? i downloaded a car racing game and 23 other games in iTunes , but the download time for the car racing game is 3 hours!how do i stop downloading this game, but not stop download the other 23 games?I have already tried deleting it but i could not.\n\nA: Just click the downloads icon next to the searchbar.

My 2012 iMac was in a room with room temperature of about 39 C, and now the hard drive seems to be not working well, taking 5 minutes to launch an app.  If I boot up Win 7 using bootcamp, Win 7 reports that the hard drive might have problems.\nI wonder how high the cost of repairing it, and I might get a new iMac, so a plan is, to use the old iMac as an external display for my Macbook Air.\nBut is it true that I must turn on the iMac and boot up Mac OS X or Win 7 in order for it to act as an external monitor?  It will just be boot up the OS and I won't use it since it is not functioning, so I would like to find a way to somehow just use it as an external display but without having the processor and RAM all be consuming power.\n(a partial solution might be to turn on the iMac while pressing the Option key, so that it will let me choose the OS to boot up to, and the display might be able to be used, without any OS running.  But the processor and the RAM probably will still be consuming power).\n\nA: Based on the Apple Support Doc http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924 it doesn't look like it. But if it is the hard disk, it might be cheaper to replace the hard disk, then to buy a monitor.\n", "Q: How can I run a script when the room brightness has changed?

Once you have found it, redownload it (with the updated version). Then connect your iPad to your PC with the USB cable and sync it. That should do it.\n", "Q: What do I have to do on my iPhone or in iTunes if my number changed? I switched to a new provider yesterday, and I'm gonna receive an iPhone 5s from them later today. But as the cancellation of my plan with the previous provider isn't completed yet, the SIM card coming with the phone will use a temporary number. As soon as my old provider is ready, my current number will be transferred to the new SIM. This requires no action on my part; the SIM will simply be \"offline\" for a few hours and will then use my current number.\nI was wondering if the iPhone and also iTunes will display the changed number immediately or if there's anything I have to do. For example, restarting the phone, removing and re-inserting the SIM, or even restoring the phone?\nAre there any other consequences of a changed number I should be aware of? Because if it's a hassle, I'd rather wait until the number is transferred before I actually unbox the phone.\n\nA: I simply had to change the \"my phone number\" field in settings, everything else worked just fine. \n", "Q: How do I re enable a permanently disabled Notification Center in Mavericks? I disabled my notification center but i want to re enable it again i followed this link \"How do I permanently disable Notification Center in Mavericks?\" \n\nA: If you ran sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui KeepAlive -bool False, it actually disables Notification Center because it changes the permissions of the plist from 644 to 600. If you change KeepAlive to false some other way that doesn't change the permissions of the plist, the NotificationCenter process is still started at login but it is not relaunched if it terminates for some reason.

I purchased a Seagate ST4000DX001 4TB SATA Hybrid Drive (SSHD) and installed it into my Mac Pro (six core 3.33 GHZ MacPro5,1) in one of the internal SATA drive bays. However, the system didn't see it at all. Disk Utility didn't show the drive for me to format and the SATA Devices section under Apple System Profiler didn't show the drive listed at all.\nThe drive works because if I put it into a USB3 enclosure then it works, but since the Mac pro only has USB2 it's pointless for me to use it in a USB3 enclosure.\nWhy doesn't my Mac Pro see my Seagate 4TB SATA SSHD drive?\n\nA: You've done all that I usually do to troubleshoot this in that you already know to use System Profiler to check the SATA bus for devices.\nI would reboot the system and reset the NVRAM twice (keep holding the keys down and you'll hear the chime twice) and then re-check the profiler.\nSadly, if the controller doesn't make that device available - you'll need to use it connected to a non-optimal bus while you work with Seagate and/or Apple tech support to determine at a device driver level what settings need to be tweaked or updated to expose that particular drive to your Mac. Let's hope someone has the same drive and can either confirm or deny for their OS X level that the drive works for them.\n\nA: I recently installed a 3 TB drive in a drive bay of my 2008 Mac Pro. When I rebooted it was not recognised and required formatting. However Disk Utility formatted it as a “Logical Volume Group”. I could not set the partition and GUID option and it was not showing the full capacity of the drive.\nI Googled the issue and found that 10.8.4 and 10.8.5 have a bug which was causing this problem to occur with drives of 3 TB and greater capacity. The solution was to boot from an earlier version of OS X. I booted from a Snow Leopard boot drive which I keep on a USB Flash Drive and used Disk Utility to successfully re-format and partition the 3 TB drive. I am not sure whether the bug is still present in Mavericks.\nI was running 10.8.5 when I encountered the problem I described above - drive not recognised but Disk Utility did offer to format it. However the normal format options were not available with \"Logical Volume Group\" being the only option.\nI did not have a boot volume pre 10.8.4 but did have a Snow Leopard boot volume. When I restarted my Mac Pro with this Snow Leopard volume I was able to use Disk Utility to set the drive to one partition and GUID format. When I rebooted into 10.8.5 the drive was recognised as a normal volume and I have been using it for my Time Machine backup ever since.\nWhile you mention that your problem is that Disk Utility does not see your drive, if you are running 10.8.4 or later it may still be worth trying an earlier version of the OS.\n\nA: I was running 10.8.5 when I encountered the problem I described above - drive not recognised but Disk Utility did offer to format it.

Say I installed a malicious app on my iPhone that stole my iCloud password.\nCan the Keychain be compromised ? \nBasically, can the keychain passwords be accessed by solely having the iCloud password ? How safe is it ?\n\nA: It's pretty secure, since any new device attempting to read your iCloud Keychain requires one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*One of your existing devices verifies the connection through a push notification with manual acceptance.\n\nWhen you enable iCloud Keychain on an additional device, your other devices that use iCloud Keychain receive a notification requesting approval for the additional device. After you approve the additional device, your iCloud Keychain automatically begins updating on that device.\n\n\n*Your iCloud Security Code\n\nWhen you set up iCloud Keychain, you're asked to create an iCloud Security Code. It can be a 4-digit code similar to the passcode lock for your device, or you can have a more complex code automatically generated for you. The iCloud Security Code is used to authorize additional devices to use your iCloud Keychain. It's also used to verify your identify so that you can perform other iCloud Keychain actions, such as recovering your iCloud Keychain if you lose all your devices.\n\nEntering the code incorrectly multiple times causes manual verification method\n\n*SMS verification to your phone.\n\nThe device that is using the SMS-capable phone number you provided when you first set up iCloud Keychain. A verification code is sent via SMS to this phone number. If you don't have access to this number, contact Apple Support, who can verify your identity so that you can complete setup on your new device.\n\nFurthermore, you can also protect your iCloud account / Apple ID by enabling two factor authentication so that in many cases - the first use of your iCloud password on a new device triggers a push notification warning in addition to the automatic email that Apple sends when your password is used on a new device.\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*You get email notification when your password is used on a new device for iCloud - no opt-in steps needed.\n\n*Keychain syncing has enhanced protection / two factor authentication baked in, again no opt-in is needed.\n\n*You can opt-in to AppleID two factor authentication to further protect against password loss/skimming.\n\n\nA: For some interesting takes on what great lengths Apple went through to make this scheme secure, see the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Synopsis of features of new iOS 7 keychain\n\n*White paper from Apple (technical details)\nShort story: It's pretty secure, but understand how it works (nothing's completely secure).  It's designed so that not even Apple can read your keychain, but be sure you know how to recover from lost devices, codes, etc.\n", "Q: How to access a newly mounted DMG from VMWare Fusion (Windows 8.1)?

Then I go to MacOS and mount a DMG. Next moment, a new drive (or folder) appears in Windows... without needing to restart the virtual machine.\nIs this scenario possible?\n\nA: I don't think this is possible without some special software in the windows vm. The dmg  is analogous to the windows .exe.  In the same way a Mac can not run an .exe, a windows box can not open a dmg.  That being said a software solution like transmac installed in the vm may offer the functionality you seek. \nNo personal experience with transmac myself. \nhttp://www.acutesystems.com/scrtm.htm\nTrasmac features:\n-Open Mac format disk drives, flash drives, CD/DVD/Blu-ray media, high density diskettes, dmg and sparseimage files.\n-Copy files to Mac disks and dmg images.\n-Format for Mac and restore disks and flash drives.\n-Create, compress and expand (convert to iso) dmg files.\n-Built in burner functionality to burn ISO and dmg files directly to CD/DVD/Blu-Ray.\n-Read Mac multisession and hybrid CDs.\nGood luck. \n\nA: Can't you just share a folder on the mounted DMG through the Fusion folder sharing facility?

Now opening them with Cmd+Tab should work as expected for those apps. This is what you probably should be doing, if your workflow is to hide things out of sight, then open them again later, e.g. MS Teams, Outlook, Calendar, etc., things that you still want to get notifications from, but don't need in front of you.\nPersonally, I love my Cmd+Q, so it's a hard habit to break to remember to only hide my Calendar/Slack, etc rather than just killing them.\n\nA: My symptoms..\nCommandTab would toggle the heading bar for each application but only some windows for the application would show up.\nThe suggestion above:\nOn your Mac,\nNavigate to System Preferences\nGo to Mission Control\nUncheck \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\"\nTry using the CommandTab  now.\nWas already in place on my Mac.

But my mac cannot even recognize my external hard drive. It displays a folder with a question mark with grey background, which means it cannot find executable boot drive. I tried pressing option key during startup and nothing showed. Also, I tried resetting  parameter RAM but still no luck. Any help will be appreciated.\n\nA: *\n\n*Connect the external drive or device to the Mac\n\n*Reboot the Mac and after the startup chime hold down the OPTION key during boot until you see the boot selection menu\n\n*Click the external volume to boot from it\n\n\nAfter this steps, you will find that external drives typically are shown with an orange icon, with their interface printed on the icon itself. Similarly, CD’s and DVD’s are shown with a disc icon. In this screen shot example, the right-most orange boot drive is a USB flash disk.\nThis works for quite literally any boot volume, whether it’s an external USB drive of any sort, a Thunderbolt hard drive, boot DVD, CD, the Recovery partition, even in dual-boot environments with other versions of OS X, or a Linux or a Windows partition with Boot Camp, if it’s bootable and connected to the Mac it will be visible at this boot manager.\nThough boot DVD’s and CD’s will be visible through the aforementioned boot manager, you can also start the Mac directly to DVD or a connected disc by holding down the “D” key during restart after you hear the chime. This is fairly uncommon these days, but it was the primary method of accessing recovery partitions before OS X became a download from the App Store, and before USB installer drives became more common.\nAdditionally, Macs with recovery partitions can be start directly into Recovery HD by holding down Command+R during system start.\nThough recovery and discs can be booted with their own commands, it’s ultimately easier to just remember the Option key method since it is a single key and because it’s universal.

I have very little knowledge of shell scripting and need to find something to work with. This project was not my choice, but was dropped into my lap and I'm stuck doing it. The app could be a drag and drop affair but my manager wants an installer.pkg, no, if, ands, or buts.\nAnyway, I have no clue as to where to begin. I am most experienced in applescripting, not shell scripting. If someone could point me in the right direction I would appreciate it.\nEdit:\n• I need to import user saved \"info\" from any old versions.\n• If the app was never installed, I have to put the app icon in the Dock (using emmett).\n• How do I get the path to the installer at run-time so as to refer to path to emmett?\n\nA: What's the task you're trying to accomplish? If you can provide requirements, it should make it easier to point you towards relevant examples.\nFor example, if you want to remove an existing copy of your application before installing the new one, you could use a preinstall script like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Remove existing copy of YourApplication.app from /Applications\n\nif [[ -d \"$3/Applications/YourApplication.app\" ]]; then\n   rm -rf \"$3/Applications/YourApplication.app\"\nfi\n\nThe drive value is defined as \"$3\" because some information is passed along by the installer to its included scripts when those scripts are run by the installation process. (For more information, see the PackageMaker How-To available here and search on the page for $3)\n", "Q: Substitue Escape for Control U in Terminal I would like to change bash keybinding so that the Escape key has the same effect as Control U. For example, if I tap the Escape key, the current Terminal command will be cleared out (which is what Control U does). How can I specify both the Escape key and the Control modifier when writing a new key definition in my .bash_profile?\n\nA: bind '\"\\e\":\"\\C-u\"' doesn't have any effect, and escape can't be remapped from Terminal's preferences.\niTerm 2 does allow remapping escape:\n\n0x05 0x15 is C-e C-u. (E is 0x45 and U is 0x55.)\nYou could also use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <appdef>\n    <appname>TERMINAL</appname>\n    <equal>com.apple.Terminal</equal>\n  </appdef>\n  <item>\n    <name>test</name>\n    <identifier>test</identifier>\n    <only>TERMINAL</only>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::ESCAPE, ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::E, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L, KeyCode::U, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nThe last two options  would prevent using escape in for example vi though.\n", "Q: In Mavericks, is it possible to use Enhanced Dictation from the command line?

Is there any software on PC/Mac which just 'serves' the files of system to iPad (instead of converting them on the fly) and any app which is able to play such content?\nI tried Plex, though it streams most of the videos, but quality isn't great. And I have even enabled Direct Play  which as per description :\n\nAllows the player to play compatible media without any conversion. In\n  most browsers, direct play supports MP4 videos with h264 video and AAC\n  audio. Videos with subtitles cannot be played directly.\n\nHowever the quality isn't same when I compare the same file in AvPlayerHD. I tried a 12GB MKV 1080p video, I felt quality was far superior in AvPlayerHD as compared to streaming. \nBasically I don't want to convert and use CPU of my PC, when my iPad is perfectly capable of playing such quality content, why convert at all? \nSo is there any app which does that? And also I heard Air Video does this, but I couldn't find any info.\n\nA: I use Air Video HD (US$3) and the free server for OS X.\n\nA: Have you tried nPlayer? That's what I use right now, allows streaming and great quality of the videos I watch.\n", "Q: List all tags in Terminal in Mavericks? Is it feasible to list all tags already defined in OS X in Terminal?\nI know there are some third-party applications that list all tags, but I just want to use Terminal to find all tags, since I use this tool to work with tags in Terminal (but unfortunately the tool doesn't provide to list tags for an entire system - it just lists for a single or multiple files selected arbitrarily).\nThanks.\n\nA: You can also use tag:\ntag -tgf \\*|grep '^    '|cut -c5-|sort -u\n\ntag -f \\* finds all files with tags, -t includes tag names in the output, and -g prints each tag on a separate line.\n\nA: The tags name are in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.list. \nYou can read it with \ndefaults read com.apple.finder.plist ViewSettingsDictionary\n\nIt will need some parsing to be a bit clearer : \ndefaults read com.apple.finder.plist ViewSettingsDictionary | \n    awk 'NR%12==2'| grep -o '\".*\"' |  sed 's/^.\\(.*\\).\\{18\\}$/\\1/'\n\nOther possibility is parsing the plist as xml. To do that you'll need to first convert the plist from binary to xml using. \nplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\nA: That list isn't comprehensive. It's only tags added through Finder. There's an additional file ~/Library/SyncedPreferences/com.apple.finder.plist, that also lists the tags that have been manipulated in Finder.\nIf you tagged a file in Terminal or using another tool and never manipulated the tags in Finder, then the tags won't be in either list.\n\nA: You can also use mdfind in combination with mdls to get the same result:\n/usr/bin/mdfind -0 \"(kMDItemUserTags == '*')\" |xargs -0 mdls -name kMDItemUserTags |grep '^    ' |cut -c5- |cut -d , -f 1 |sort -u\n\nWould be interesting to benchmark, which one is faster.\n\nA: Colour followed by path:\n/usr/bin/mdfind -0 \"(kMDItemUserTags == '*')\" | xargs -I % sh -c 'echo $(mdls -name kMDItemUserTags % | grep \"^    \" |cut -c5-) %'\n", "Q: iPad battery drain after update to iOS 7 After update to iOS 7.0.4 from version 5.x, my iPad's battery has only fraction of full charge as fast as in 24 hours.

I was hoping that this would allow me to see the file somehow on my Mac but alas that did not work. I'm assuming this video is now using space on my iCloud account, so I'd like to \"unshare\" and delete it. How is this done?\nFollow-up question, the video in question was added twice. I'm able to delete the videos as suggested in in the selected answer, however I'm now left with an empty stream that says \"shared by (null)(null)\". How do I get rid of that?\n\n\nA: It appears that you've added a video to an iCloud Shared Photo Stream. Since you are the one that added it to the stream, you can delete it.\n\nCan I delete photos, videos and comments from a shared stream?\nYes. If you are the owner of a shared stream, you can delete any photos, videos or comments that you or your contributors have added.\n\nSource: Apple KB article: iCloud Photo Sharing FAQ\nTo delete a video from a shared stream:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Photos → Shared.\n\n\n*Select the stream that you added the video to, then select the video.\n\n*Tap the Trash  icon to delete it.\nTo delete the entire shared stream:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Photos → Shared.\n\n*Select the stream that you wish to delete.\n\n*Go to People → Delete Photo Stream.\nWith regard to your statement about using up iCloud storage…\n\nDo Shared Photo Streams use my iCloud storage?\nNo. Photos uploaded to Shared Photo Streams do not count against your iCloud storage.\n\nSource: Apple KB article: iCloud Photo Sharing FAQ\n", "Q: In Activity Monitor, is the percentage out of each core or out of each virtual core?

Can I make more available memory by deleting pictures? Do I delete them from Photo Stream or Camera Roll? I want them saved but can I remove from one of those areas.\n\nA: If you haven't enabled Photo Stream syncing on your Mac/PC, you should keep the copy that is in your camera roll until you've copied it to your PC. That is the original copy, and it won't be deleted until you do it yourself.\nIf you have enabled it, and made sure the \"automatic import\" setting is enabled1, you can safely delete the photo from your Camera Roll after syncing with iCloud. Deleting a photo manually from the Photo Stream will remove it from the photo stream on all of your devices, but a Mac/PC (with the above-mentioned \"automatic import\" setting) will have copied the photo into its library when it synced with the Photo Stream.\nThe Photo Stream photos are transient copies of the photos in your Camera Roll; photos older than 30 days will be deleted, and if you have more than 1000 photos the oldest will be removed to make space for new ones. If you are using Photo Stream and syncing to a PC, I would just let iCloud manage the Photo Stream, and manually delete photos from the Camera Roll.\nSource\n1) To quote this Apple support article:\n\nYou can choose to download all of your photos from My Photo Stream to your Mac and PC automatically.\n  Photos 1.0 or later: Open Photos and go to Preferences > General. Select Copy items to the Photos library.\n  iPhoto or Aperture: Go to Preferences > Photos (or Photo Stream) > My Photo Stream > Automatic Import. All of your photo stream photos will import into your Events, Projects, Photos, Faces, and Places folders in iPhoto or Aperture.\n\nRegarding iCloud on Windows: When I last used it 2 years ago, the photo stream folder would save photos in perpetuity, ignoring any size limit. I'm not sure if this is still the case with the latest version of iCloud. \n\nA: Photos in either of the two places will consume storage space on your device, since they are stored on your device regardless of location. To free the most amount of space, remove photos from both Photo Stream and your Camera Roll.\n", "Q: How to create a meta-playlist? I'd like to create a meta-playlist that plays various playlists I created in order, with the added functionality to set limits on how many songs will play from each playlist.  Can this be done, either in iTunes or other software?\nMy example is the following:\nI grew up listening to The Beatles albums and I'm accustomed to hearing their songs in a specific order.  For example, the album \"Revolver\" has 14 songs and it starts with Taxman, followed by Eleanor Rigby, followed by I'm Only Sleeping, etc.\nOver the years, I've collected cover versions of Beatles songs.  Let's say I now have five cover versions of each song on Revolver.\nI'd like to hear new versions of Revolver: that is, to hear a randomly selected cover version of the song Taxman, followed by a cover of Eleanor Rigby, followed by I'm Only Sleeping, etc.\nDoable?  \n\nA: You could do a whole gas factory for that in AppleScript.\nYou could also achieve that with folders and playlists .m3u. \nLet’s say :\n\n\n*\n\n*One folder = one album. Inside the folder, 14 .m3u files.\n\n*One .m3u file = one playlist = one title of the album = 5 versions of the song.\n\n\nAnd you could play the folder with VLC.

I didn't see an option in Handbrake (it seems to be ripping only), or in iTunes.  Can iMovie help me here?  Is there a cheaper/easier way?\nIt doesn't have to be exact, or terribly easy to use.  I'm perfectly willing to just provide a list of MM:SS points (there's only 4 or 5).\n\nA: I haven't used it personally, but it looks like Subler will do what you want. \nHere is the proper format you need to use for the chapter file: https://code.google.com/p/subler/wiki/ChapterTextFormat\n\nSubler will allow you to add chapters. You just need to drag and drop a\n  text file in the right format into Subler. You don't write them in in\n  the Subler GUI.\nThe Subler site explains the format. It took a lot of trial and error\n  for me to get it right and it is time consuming so I haven't done it\n  in a while.

I have a Haswell retina MBP, but following the installation process with Bootcamp Assistant v.5.1.1 results in an error when Windows attempts to install. Are there any guides available that walks one through this process?\n\nA: This is how to fix the bootcamp windows install error:\n\"Windows could not update the computer's boot configuration.\"\nDo not try to fix with a workaround - you'll find solutions of people manually selecting their Windows partition during reboot by holding down the OPTION key. This will work, but you are circumventing the way that apple wanted you to install it (via EFI).\nThe solution to this error is simple: it's a PRAM problem. I've seen a lot of different ways of people claiming to fix this problem. I've experienced it multiple times on my Haswell 15\" retina Macbook Pro, but it seems to be affecting a lot of the other Haswells as well.\nHere are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a USB install like normal using Boot Camp Assistant\n(include the Apple support software)\n\n*Partition your drive for OSX and the new BOOTCAMP partition\n\n*Let it automatically reboot, follow the normal procedures to format the new BOOTCAMP partition, and get to the \"finishing\" step during the Windows installation. You will get the error\n\n*At this point, when you press OK it will automatically restart after 10+ seconds.  When that happens, quickly hold ALT+COMMAND+P+R. You will see\nyour screen flicker and you will hear the bootup sound twice, which means you reset the PRAM successfully\n\n*Your OSX install should now boot instead of the failed Windows install\n\n*Open Boot Camp Assistant again. Remove the Window partition that was created and restore OSX back to the partition size it had at the beginning of these steps\n\n*Go through the Boot Camp Assistant once more to create the BOOTCAMP partition. You do NOT have to recreate the USB, so just uncheck and skip those steps\n\n*Let it automatically reboot and follow the same Windows installation steps as before. You should not get the error the second time.\n\n\nI found that this is the only thing that consistently works for me.  I've installed Windows 8 and 8.1 on Mavericks 10.9.2 Haswell Macbook a bunch of times, so I'm pretty sure of it. This will result in you installing it as Apple meant it to be installed.\n\nA: This is what I found to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create USB stick using Apple Bootcamp Assistant (and keep it in your machine for the duration of the installation). Follow the entire process (including specifying the size of your Windows partition).\n\n*When Bootamp Assitant reboots your machine you need to interrupt the installation by holding option until you get a choice of what disk to boot from and select Macintosh HD.\n\n*Open Disk Utility, select the drive above Macintosh HD (it should be specifying the size of the disk as a whole [for me it is 1 TB APPLE SSD SM1024F Media) then choose the partitions tab. Note: If you merely select Macintosh HD you will not see the Partitions tab. Important: If you partition the drive any other way with the same partition type it will not work, I initially couldn't find the partitions tab so I did something similar, but the installation process merely failed later. So you must do it this way.\n\n*Once in the partitions drive, the BOOTCAMP partition should be at the bottom. Select this partition by clicking on it. Ensure it is the highlighted partition then press minus to remove it. Click apply on the bottom right to save the changes.\n\n*Now press plus to add a new partition. Select this new partition and rename it to BOOTCAMP and change the partition type to ExFAT. Click apply again to save the changes.\n\n*Reboot you Mac, press option again during the boot and this time select the Windows device with the USB logo on it. It's orange.\n\n*The install process will start. If you happen to have a Windows 8 key but are installing Windows 8.1, your key won't work, use a generic key from here to get by the installation (you can change your product key once you have Windows running from Settings).\n\n*When it gets to the list of partition you should see four of them. You want the last one. It will say it cannot install on the partition, so make sure the 4th partition is selected and format it. Once done, you should be able to continue the installation process.\n\n*During installation it will recommend default settings. Specify advanced configuration and turn off Auto Updates. It is recommend it remain off until the bootcamp drivers are installed. When it is finished prepping the install it will reboot.\n\n*It will reboot 2 or 3 times during installation. Each time it reboots you will need to intervene by pressing option but from now on select the silver Windows hard drive. Do not unplug your bootable USB until windows has been completely installed (BootCamp drivers are used from it).\n\n*At the end of the installation it will prompt you to install the Apple Bootcamp Drivers, do it.\n\n\nSources:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5490486?start=0&tstart=0\nhttp://www.askvg.com/fix-windows-8-genuine-product-key-doesnt-work-for-windows-8-1-clean-installation/\n", "Q: iOS undo text field clear (x) Seemingly fairly regularly, I find myself clicking on the X in a circle to the right of a text field in an iOS app on my iPad, instead of just placing the cursor next to the final character in the text field.

I have a really low capacity MacBook Air. Earlier this year, I discovered I could keep it usable without a bunch of \"running low on disk space\" warnings by limiting the caching performed by Safari and Mail. In Safari it was easy, it's in Preferences, but in Mail it was a bit buried - select the account, advanced tab, and then \"don't keep copies of any messages\".\nProblem is, it seems like in Mavericks this preference is gone. Is there an equivalent? I'm out of room on my Air once again.\n\nA: After looking through the updates to Mail in Mavericks, it looks like I have bad news.  There does not appear to be any way to disable Mail in Mavericks from storing local copies of messages (of course, you can save some space by preventing Mavericks from storing local copies of attachments).\nIf you are hard-pressed for space to the point where a few GB of local mail storage is of particular concern, then your best bet is likely either to use an email service which supports automatic message archiving (so that you can search through an archive which is stored on the server, thus freeing space on your machine that the archived messages would have taken) or routinely remove messages from your inbox and store them elsewhere (e.g., on a NAS).  As it seems your goal is to have your messages readily accessible for search and other purposes, the first option is probably more likely to suit your needs.\nOne possible way to set up the second option (i.e., routinely moving messages out of your inbox) might work well for you.  What you'll want to do is create a rule which automatically forwards your email to a second account (what email service you use for this account is entirely up to you) and then deletes the forwarded email from your inbox (you could have this done automatically once the messages is read/a certain numbers of days old or via a keyboard shortcut, whichever is preferable).  This way, your local storage will remain small (only unread messages or recent messages, depending upon how you configure your rule), but the external account will have a complete archive of your messages.  You can then access this archive in your browser without impacting available local free space.\n\nA: There is no way to stop Mail from caching everything in Mavericks. \n**The *only thing you can do is tell it to stop caching attachments only. Check under Preferences -> Accounts -> Advanced tab... the third checkbox from the top, uncheck \"Automatically download attachments\"\n\nA: With Gmail, you can slightly alleviate this problem with:\nSettings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP > Folder Size Limits > Limit IMAP folders to contain no more than this many messages = 1000\nAlso, in Mac Mail you can still disable Automatically download attachments.\nThis will leave you with the text of latest 1000 messages from each Gmail label.\n\nA: My impression is OS X Mail is undergoing a fundamental re-invention to make it more of a service and less of the app it was.\n\n\n*\n\n*It uses more database files to track things than in the past were simply files in the filesystem.\n\n*Search uses spotlight and there is lag on slower computers between when you launch the app and when mail messages get drawn causing many to feel that the whole architecture is rickety and more prone to error.\n\n*Turning on and off accounts often causes odd behavior where flagged message counts don't update.\n\n*It uses more helpers to parallelize internal message handling workflows and this also introduces more complexity, chance for things to break or get hung up when you want to quit mail or delete a message and the mail server is slow or unavailable.\n\n*It is being reworked to embrace Apple's new technologies like PowerNap / AppNap / etc... and some old behaviors that don't mix well with those changes are being eliminated.\n\n\nFor people used to Outlook, Apple's Mavericks Mail always works as if it's in Offline mode - caching all messages it can so you never find yourself missing old mails when working without a network connection.\nMail.app downloads each and every IMAP message it can get it's hand on in each and every folder that it know that exists. \nUnless you want to use another email client that has this functionality (and google maintains that most clients work the way you want), you'll have to keep your total IMAP message and attachment storage under the allocation that you want on OS X. \nThere have been server side changes on GMAIL to allow this sort of filtering of folders (a.k.a. labels) on the server side. (This filtering is really needed if you have multiple labels on a message since you can end up with five or more copies of one mail message in this case.) The people I have seen that choose to not deal with Mail's bumpy changes are moving either to MailMate or in some cases using mutt/pine/elm if they had used those mail clients back in the day and work mostly with mail as a text bucket.\nApple does have Exchange functionality on iOS to limit downloading to a time range, but that also needs server-side functionality to work. The benefit of iOS Mail is that downloaded content will auto-expunge if storage space on the flash hits warning and critical levels. Only if enough people send feedback or bug reports to Apple do I expect the OS X Mail to change.\n\nA: What else are you doing on the MacBook Air that has it burst it's GB seams? \nRecommendations\n\n\n*\n\n*Onyx: http://www.titanium.free.fr Have it run and clean and script your way to a fresher path.

I have a new SSD and my old hard drive installed in my optibay. My old hard drive currently has a Mac OS system on it, and I want to just wipe it so I can use it for storing my videos, and pictures. How can I do this?\n\nA: Can you boot into the laptop from the SSD OS while both drives are in your laptop?\nIf so, just open disk utility, select your old HDD drive, and select the erase tab.\nFrom there you can reformat your hard drive.\n\nA: Best would be to re-install a clean system on the SSD althought you could user \"Carbon Copy Cloner\" to do so simply unticking your user folder. Then to cross link the system on the SSD and your data on the PHD (plates) you can do so several ways :\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to access all your data from the old hard disk simply after a first login and a new user folder create automatically after the login you may go in \"System Preferences\" > \"Users and Groups\" right click your user and point the user \"Home directory\" towards your user folder inside the PHD.\n\n*Another way would be to create an alias or better symbolic link to the directory this could be achieve from the terminal from the recovery partition or via single user (cmd - S) while starting and then typing (QWERTY keyboard dash is 2 keys left from backspace and slash is the key next to right shift) :\nmount -uw /\nThen create the link :\nln -s /Volumes/*SSD*/Users /Volumes/*PHD*/Users\n\n\n\n*\n\n*One last way is simply to replace heavy folders by aliases or symlink pointing on the appropriate folder on your PHD. Eg ln -s ~/Music /Volumes/PHD/Music and put your iTunes folder and whatever stuff related to audio inside…\n\n\nI think the third solution is the best because you preserve configuration and commonly used files on the SSD…\nPS : I would discourage to use non-Apple stuff to manage Fusion drive, we are talking about datas. You don't want to make an update that would create problems… Thus manually managing what to put on the SSD is the most secure / viable / reasonnable solution.\nNB : The main difference between hardlinks and symbolic link is that you may delete the files pointed by a symbolic link (-s option of the link command) but not by a hardlink. Hardlink only works with files.\n\nA: Have you considered building your own Fusion drive using the SSD/HDD as a single combined drive to get the best of both worlds? Here is an example - http://jollyjinx.tumblr.com/post/34638496292/fusion-drive-on-older-macs-yes-since-apple-has. \n\nA: I have a point to add to this. As I understand you have left the HDD where it was, next to the battery and have replaced your optical drive with a SSD inside a carrier (similar to the one at hardwrk.com). This configuration is a waste because you have given your HDD the faster SATA connection on the MLB and your SSD the slower one.\nSwap these drives so that the SATAII(I) is going to the SSD and your HDD gets the P/SATA connection.\nWhat might be fun, if you are running 10.8.3 or newer is setting them up as a fusion drive so that you get the speed of flash both the capacity of both drives added together. Be aware though that you should always keep an active backup and I only set these up for people if they have a fully functioning Time Machine setup.

In guided access mode, can I restrict to Newsstand alone, so users can only view Newsstand and the subscribed newspapers and magazines?\nIt seems that the guided access mode can only restrict to a single magazine.\n\nA: It may sound counter intuitive, but each \"Magazine\" in Newsstand is actually an App, and the Newsstand \"App\" is actually just a standard folder that's been messed about with a bit at the OS level to make it appear and function a bit differently.\nAs such, with Guided Access being restricted to single app scenarios, you can't do what you wish, because when you are viewing the Newstand App you are actually just sat in a folder at your home screen - A double slick to bring up the multi-tasking bar shows that the left most screen which is normally associated with the Homescreen page/folder that you last launched an app from is showing Newsstand still.\n", "Q: How can I copy data from an external HDD that is about to fail? I have an external HDD that is about to fail. I want to copy as much as I can to a new external HDD before it completely dies. I've been able to start copying files for a few minutes before the drive starts turning off and on repeatedly and clicking.\nIs there a (preferably free) Mac application that can copy files off an about-to-fail hard drive, handle the drive suddenly disappearing, and continue where it left off when the drive is reconnected?\nOr do you have any other tips that might help? I've heard rumours about putting a drive in the freezer. Do you think that might help, or is it more likely to kill the drive?\n\nA: I would try using rsync from the command line. \nrsync -av --ignore-errors /Volumes/failingDrive/ /Volumes/brandNewDrive\n\nshould do the trick. Mind the trailing / at the end of the source. Rsync will not copy files it finds on the destination, so if you call it a second time it will continue where it left off.\n\nA: And oddly enough a possible solution that involves no software at all, just your freezer.\nDouble or triple bag your HD (to keep ALL moisture out) and put it in the freezer for a couple of hours.\nThen plug it into your Mac and see if you get a longer useful life (15 min instead of 5 or 10) out of it.\nOften times HD issues are exacerbated by heat. Keeping the drive as cold as possible will SOMETIMES delay the heat related failures and allow you to get the necessary data off the drive.\nJust be careful to keep the drive DRY as moisture will kill the drive faster than heat. And kill it permanently. So watch for condensation on the newly \"frozen\" HD. \n", "Q: Is there a way to force ssh tunneling to be required for Screen Sharing I have enabled Remote Management on a mac. Everything works fine when I connect from another mac using Apple's Remote Desktop app. However, I also want to have a client on a windows machine. In that case can I go to the computer settings under Settings > Sharing > Remote Management and there is an option \"VNC users may control screen with password\" where one can give a password for accessing them.\nFrom what I understand the initial transaction of exchanging the password is done securely. However, all subsequent transactions are not. This implies that when a user attempts to login to the machine and gives his/her actual password, then that password is out there without any encryption what so ever. So, what I would like to do is to allow VNC connections only when the client has already established an ssh tunnel with the server/machine. However, I do not see such an option anywhere.\nSo, what I really want is to force this ssh tunnel on the client side. On the other hand, just letting it to good will of the clients is not a good idea, especially if I rely on people running windows to have to remember constantly to tunnel say through putty and only then attempt to use vnc.\nMoreover, Apple's Remote Desktop app does allow full encryption for all interactions by selecting an option under preferences > security (on the client side). I can be OK with that in the sense that this option should be enabled once, and from that point and on all subsequent interactions will be encrypted. (By the way, is there a windows program out there with such a simple option so that one can use it under windows and connect to a mac?) However, the problem remains here as well, as I am not sure how the server would force all the transactions to be encrypted. There is again no option on the server side for such a thing. \nIs what I am trying to ask irrational?\nI am looking forward to your answers.\n\nA: I would advise you to create a permanent ssh tunnel so you can local forward the connection port from the Windows host to the connection port on the Mac host using Bitvise Tunnelier: https://www.bitvise.com/tunnelier, while not personally having used it, this question explains a similar problem: https://superuser.com/questions/235395/automatic-ssh-tunneling-from-windows\n\nA: I am not sure I understand your question fully (please rewrite/clarify it) but if you have VNC on a certain machine A and want to prevent B and C to connect to A without using an ssh tunnel, just block the VNC port (typically 5900) in A's firewall (and open port 22 for ssh).\n", "Q: Is there a \"Voice Recording\" application for IOS which can specify a moment while recording?

CaptureAudio does exactly this. It is a US$3 app for iPhone (also works on iPad, it’s a universal app, no separate purchase).\nJust to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, let me state that CaptureAudio is a past-sponsor of a podcast that I do. That being said, their sponsorship slot is over and has nothing to do with me posting this here. It just so happens to be an app that I know which does the exact thing requested.\nUsage is very simple, start recording and you get a big button on your iPhone. Tap it, and a marker/bookmark/notation is added to the recording. You can even create different kinds of bookmarks, and each one has different symbols attached to it. \n\nScreenshot from http://captureapps.com/\nWhen you are listening back later on, tapping one of those marker/bookmarks will jump right to the spot where you recorded it. (You can see screenshots of that on the website.)\nActually I think it’s even smart enough to jump back a little before the marker, which is good because you probably didn't realize you need to mark something until after it was said!\nThe app also backs up to Dropbox, which is nice, but I haven't actually used that feature, I've just done everything on the iPhone. \nWhen listening back to long recordings (over an hour), the app does tend to crash sometimes, but this is only on playback not while recording which would obviously be a deal-breaker. I assume that crash is probably related to the iPhone running out of memory, but IANADeveloper, so that's just a guess.\n", "Q: How to write AND condition in Numbers I have a dataset where I want to write a COUNTIFstatement in Numbers (Mavericks).

To anybody who came here with a 3rd party keyboard/Mac setup but was unable to download the software above. I had this same problem. It's not a solution for remapping the entire keyboard, but if you want to just be able to remap your command/flower button, follow the instructions at the following article: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-customize-third-party-keyboard-mac/\nSpecifically, the following instructions:\n\nYou can customize your external keyboard and remap certain keys by going to System Preferences > Keyboard on your Mac. It's especially important to do this if you're using a Windows keyboard to make sure the keys behave how you want them to.\n\n\nClick Change Keyboard Type to help your Mac detect what kind of keyboard you're using: Razer, Steelseries, Logitech, and so on. Follow the keyboard wizard that appears, asking you to press various keys. Based on these results, you Mac will set up the default settings for your keyboard layout.\n\n\n\nClick Modifier Keys to rearrange the keys that combine with others to perform certain actions. From left to right, the modifier keys on an Apple keyboard read Control, Option, Cmd whereas non-Apple keyboards usually read Control, Windows, Alt.\n\n\nBy default, macOS registers the Windows key as Cmd and the Alt key as Option. So you may want to remap the modifier keys for your external keyboard to match Apple's keyboard layout and keep the order of these modifier keys the same.

Is there a way to programmatically re-mount them in this case, or to prevent them from vanishing in the first place?\n\nOS X 10.9 (issue present since 10.7, on several machine); G-Technology drives (various models); \"put disks to sleep\" setting is disabled; pmset reports:\nCurrently in use:\n standbydelay         10800\n standby              1\n womp                 1\n halfdim              1\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n darkwakes            1\n networkoversleep     0\n disksleep            0\n sleep                1\n autopoweroffdelay    14400\n hibernatemode        3\n autopoweroff         1\n ttyskeepawake        1\n displaysleep         5\n acwake               0\n lidwake              1\n\nNote also that this is not a question about preventing spin-down. I've found ways to prevent this where possible, but when it's not (e.g., when the mac itself is asleep and the drives spin down because they ignore system settings to prevent spin-down), my drives frequently also unmount, thus vanishing completely from the system. The question is about how to prevent or recover from that.\n\nA: I can't see a way to change the OS directly, but here's how you would mitigate it:\n\n\n*\n\n*set up a script to parse diskutil list and possible diskutil cs list and have it mount any volumes that are connected and unmounted\n\n*use a tool like Launch Control or Lingon to wrap that script in a launchd trigger mechanism to call it periodically.\n\n", "Q: Why are certain games only available on iPad?

The thought behind having two different setups is you might want some things in your interactive shell (a fancy prompt, a message of the day, colourization of your command output, etc.) that you wouldn't want in a non-interactive session because it trips up programmatic access to input and output and what not.\nFor most users though you want both environments to be the same. Most of us aren't running complicated enough bash setups to warrant separating out interactive and non-interactive setups like this.\nThe .bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells.\nThere's a nice article by Josh Staiger that talks about why one over the other and how to remember where to put things. Allow me to quote some of it here:\n\nWhat is a login or non-login shell?\nWhen you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: .bash_profile is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.\n  But, if you’ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window (xterm) inside Gnome or KDE, then .bashrc is executed before the window command prompt. .bashrc is also run when you start a new bash instance by typing /bin/bash in a terminal.\nMac OS X — an exception\nAn exception to the terminal window guidelines is Mac OS X’s Terminal.app, which runs a login shell by default for each new terminal window, calling .bash_profile instead of .bashrc. Other GUI terminal emulators may do the same, but most tend not to.\nRecommendation\nMost of the time you don’t want to maintain two separate config files for login and non-login shells — when you set a PATH, you want it to apply to both. You can fix this by sourcing .bashrc from your .bash_profile file, then putting PATH and common settings in .bashrc.\nTo do this, add the following lines to .bash_profile:\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n    source ~/.bashrc\nfi\n\nNow when you login to your machine from a console .bashrc will be called.\n\n\nA: See Ian C's description of what the source line does\nThis is surrounded by an if statement\nif x; then\n  ....\nfi\n\nthis checks on x and then runs the code between the then and the fi (The idea of fi ending and if and other endins by reverseing the beggining keyword is use in sh and related shells.\nThe check that is made here is [ -f ~/.bashrc ] which is the same as test -f .bashrc the if tells test to return true iff what follows -f is a file and it exists.\nSo the code over says if there is a .bashrc run it into your cirrent shell.\n", "Q: Can't download OS X Mavericks I'm on OS X Lion (10.7.5) and still cannot download OS X Mavericks (10.9). There is no progress bar on the Mac App Store. Also, it is not resumable. Whenever I pause the download and shutdown/reboot my MBP, it restarts the whole download process.\nA random guy from the Power Mac Center (Apple Retailer) told me that it has something to do on the speed of the internet. I have a 3 Mbps plan and seems like there nothing inadequate about it.\nAny workaround on this issue?\n\nA: A few initial tips/suggestions/thoughts\n\n\n*\n\n*The random guy at ‘Power Mac Center’ was close. It’s not the speed of the internet that matters, it’s the combination of: A) the speed at which Apple sends the files, and B) the bandwidth capabilities of your connection. In my experience “A” never comes close to “B”.\n\n*Large downloads from the Mac App Store should be resumable, but for some reason they often aren’t. You can pause them for awhile, but if you pause it for too long, it always seems to start over.\n\n*Someone told me that their download speeds from the iTunes Store varied greatly depending on which DNS servers they were using. I don’t pretend to know why that would be the case, but he said that it made a great deal of difference in his experience. So if you are using your ISP’s DNS servers, you might try OpenDNS or Google DNS and see if that helps.\n\n\nThe excruciatingly long and nerdy answer that just might help. But no promises.\n\nGUI progress meters are often not very helpful. If you want the real scoop on what is happening, you’ll want to get down into the place where the actual files are being downloaded.\nIn this case, that’s (somewhere under) /var/folders/.[1] \nNow, you could try to do this in Finder, but really, you’d be much better off firing up Terminal.app from /Applications/Utilities/. Then you can copy/paste this command:\nfind /var/folders -ipath '*/com.apple.appstore/*' \\\n-name manifest.plist 2>/dev/null\n\nNote that you can copy that command as two lines as long as the first line ends with \\ or just remove the \\ and keep it as one long line.\nTranslated into English, that command says “Look in the folder /var/folders/ for any file called ”manifest.plist“ in a path (series of folders/directories) that has ”com.apple.appstore\" in it.\nFor example, on my computer right now (with no active Mac App Store downloads), I have only one of these, which is at:\n/var/folders/bk/cb9y7rbx30q_6n40wp096grc0000gn/C/com.apple.appstore/manifest.plist\n\nOnce you find that plist file, you need to look inside it for the name of the ‘package file’ which is being downloaded from the Mac App Store.\nUsually that file will end with “.pkg” so if you wanted to skip a step, you could try just looking for .pkg files:\nfind /var/folders \\\n-ipath '*/com.apple.appstore/*' \\\n-iname '*.pkg' \\\n-ls 2>/dev/null |\\\negrep '\\.pkg$'\n\nThis is a similar command as before, except that now we are asking find to look for any files which end with ‘.pkg’ and then show us the output of ls on any matching file or folder.\nIf you track the file size of any ‘.pkg’ files found in that directory, then you can see how much data has been downloaded. \nExample: Since I don’t have any downloads currently, I don’t have any .pkg files to show, so I’ll use a ‘.plist’ file for this example. Here’s what the output of that command would look like for me:\n4446464 8 -rw-r–r– 1 luomat staff 226 Dec 3 01:03 /var/folders/bk/cb9y7rbx30q_6n40wp096grc0000gn/C/com.apple.appstore/manifest.plist\nMost of the stuff on that line we don’t care about. You can probably pick out the date “Dec 3” and the time “01:03” but actually the only part we really care about is the size of the file, in bytes, which is the number just before the date: 226. \n(Just stay with me here.)\nIf you count the number of ‘columns’ in that line, you’ll find that the ‘226’ is the 7th column, and the filename is the last column. Using another Unix tool called awk we can run that command again and only see the fields that we want to see: the file size and the file name.\nfind /var/folders \\\n-ipath '*/com.apple.appstore/*' \\\n-iname '*.plist' \\\n-ls 2>/dev/null |\\\nawk '{print $7\" \"$NF}'  \n\nAgain, from top to bottom, that says: (1) look in /var/folders (2) for anything in a path of folders/directories which contains ‘/com.apple.appstore/’ (3) and files which end in ‘.plist’ (which you’d want to change to ‘.pkg’)\nand then (4) show us the file listing (ls) output for anything that matches, and filter (|) the results through (5) awk and print out only: the 7th column, a space (that’s the “ ”) and the last column ($NF means ‘last’ to awk).\nWhew! Ok, did you get all that? I hope so. If not, don’t give up yet. There’s a surprise at the end of this post. I’ll stop with the details there, but just imagine if you ran a loop which kept checking the size of that .pkg file every, oh, 15 seconds or so. Then you would be able to see how many bytes had been downloaded, and if you kept the old value and compared it to the new value, you could even tell how much of the file you had downloaded since the last time you checked.\nBut what! There’s more! In that manifest.plist file that I mentioned before, not only does it give us the name of the .pkg file that is being downloaded, it also tells us how many bytes it is supposed to be.\nSo, if you really wanted to, you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look for the manifest.plist file\n\n*Find the name of the .pkg file that the manifest.plist said we were currently downloading\n\n*Find the total size that .pkg file is supposed to be when it has completely downloaded\n\n*Run a loop as long as that .pkg file exists, checking its size, comparing that to the previous size, and the total size, and give you an idea of how much has been downloaded, how fast it is being downloaded, and how much more there is to go.\nWow. Doesn’t that sound fün?\nWell, I have some good news. These sorts of tedious tasks are just the sort of thing computers are really good at doing. All you need is someone who tells the computer what to do, and put it together in some kind of a ‘program’ or ‘script’.\nWhich is what I did. You can find it at https://github.com/tjluoma/maswatch. My script uses Growl, and, more specifically, growlnotify to send you a notification every time the script loops.[2] That notification will show you the total size, the downloaded size, and the difference between the current downloaded size and the previous download size (to give you an idea how fast it is downloading).\nTo use the script, you’ll need to: \n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install Growl and growlnotify.\n\n*Download the script \ncurl -L –remote-name https://github.com/tjluoma/maswatch/raw/master/maswatch.sh \n\n*Make it executable:\nchmod 755 maswatch.sh \n\n*Then start your download from the Mac App Store using the App Store app.\n\n*Once the download has started, run the script in Terminal:\n./maswatch.sh\nIt should find the .pkg file and then start reporting the download size. \n\n\n*\n\n\nIf you have stray ‘pkg’ files in /var/folders/ (inside the “/com.apple.appstore/” folder), it might be that a corrupted download is interfering with subsequent attempts. That seems unlikely, but is theoretically possible and it felt like I should at least mention it.  ↩\nSomeone with a basic understanding of Un*x could read the script and change it to use echo instead of growlnotify, but that, as my Comp Sci professor used to say, “has been left as an exercise for the reader.”  ↩\n", "Q: Apple Mail marks mail as read when searching Since a while back Apple Mail marks mail as read when searching.

I am attempting to access a PDF file on my network from my iPhone and I know how to access these files from Windows OS.\nHowever since I have an iPhone 5, I don't have the knowledge to make that device work with my existing network files. \nI have attempted several apps and none seem to work. I am not interested in changing my network to support iOS. My intent is to absolutely have something on the iPhone to access the same sort of files I can from my Windows laptop when connected via VPN. \n\nA: I recommend FileExplorer Free.  I just installed it to access files that I wrote on a SD card in my WiFi router.  I have an iPhone and iPad.  FileExplorer can use CIFS, SMB, FTP and others.  It can read many formats such as PDF, video, photos, music and Microsoft Office.\nThere is  priced version for five dollars.\n\nA: You're not specific enough by what \"on my network\" means, but since you mention Windows, I'll assume you want to access files via CIFS protocol.\nThere are several apps on the app store for iPhone that claim to offer the ability to access files shared via CIFS. Rather than enumerate them, or recommend any since I haven't tried any, I'll just suggest you search the app store for CIFS.

With the previous versions of iPhoto, I was used to add a location for an album or batch of pictures taken during the same outdoor trip (backcountry skiing or alpinism tour for instance). My camera is not equipped with a GPS chip so I did it manually by placing a tag on the the Google Map tool integrated in iPhoto. \nWith the latest version of iPhoto 9.5 ('11), the google map tool has been replaced by the not so well finished Apple Maps. Which is OK from my point of view to use when you are within the civilized world, not really usable outside a city…\nFor me this tool is not usable, because the location edition area is a small thumbnail picture representing a map, on the lower right corner of iPhoto. I can move the tag, no problem, but it is a nightmare to locate it precisely where I want it to be (e.g. on the top of a mountain I climbed) due to the size of the edition area. I tried to edit the tag in the Maps application included in Maverick, but is seems that the tags are not shared between Maps and iPhoto. I also tried to edit the tag in the \"Locations\" function of iPhoto (in the left side bar), but it appears that the tags cannot be edit / moved in this view. \nHere my question: how can I efficiently and manually edit the locations of a batch of pictures in iPhoto 9.5, within a window of the size of the app main window? \nAnd a subsidiary question, in case the first question has no solution now: does a plug-ing exists to ease the location of pictures in iPhoto 9.5?\n\nA: I also miss Google Maps in the newer iPhoto, so I use Picasa (which uses Google Maps) to add location data and keywords to the image files before importing them into iPhoto. Using Picasa for this is easier and has the added benefit that if I export them later as \"originals\" they have the location and keyword data embedded in the exif part of the file. When you add location and keywords to photos (or even change the name) in iPhoto, it stores the info in a database, not in the image file. I work only with JPEGs, so I don't know how Picasa handles RAW files.\nHere's my process using standard apps already on my Mac (Mavericks) and Picasa 3.9 (free download):\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Image Capture to import photos to a folder on my desktop\n\n*Use Automator to rename the images with the date and time, for example IMG-2014-01-02-143612. By including the time down to the second, every image has a unique name which will sort chronologically. This might also be a good time to add something descriptive to a group of photo titles, like IMG-2014-01-02-143612-Mount Everest :-)\n\n*Open folder in Picasa 3.9 to add location and keywords. Picasa will write this information to the exif part of the file and won't touch the actual image data.\n\n*Import images to iPhoto which will make use of the location data and keywords added in Picasa. If you export an \"original\" from iPhoto later, your location and keywords will be intact.\n\n\nA: I found a solution that solves my problem. In the menu \"Window\" go to the the function \"Manage my locations\" (translated from French, I do not have the exact name in English). \nThen a scalable window with a map and a list of the already used locations appears. The items in the list can be edited (name, precise location on the map and the area or interest for the location)! \nThis implies that the location which is edited already exists in the list: it is not possible to add a new location with this function, but just to edit it. \n", "Q: Unable to format pendrive, diskutil error When I insert my USB Pendrive in my iMac i see this message:\n\nI tried to format it both with DiskUtility and with diskutil command in terminal but I get this error:\niMac:~ User$ diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ PenDrive disk2\nStarted erase on disk2\nUnmounting disk\nErasing\nnewfs_hfs: WriteBuffer:  pwrite(3, 0x108551000, 131072, 0): Device not configured\nnewfs_hfs: write (sector 0): Invalid argument\nMounting disk\nCould not mount disk2 with name (null) after erase\nError: -69832: File system formatter failed\n\nHow can I solve it?\n\nA: Click on \"Initialize...\"\nor if the useer your login with can adminastrat the computer then try adding \"sudo \" and entering your password when prompted.\nSo:\nsudo diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ PenDrive disk2\n\n\nA: You could try booting into any free Linux livecd with Gparted on it, or this one called Parted Magic which is designed for disk maintenance tasks like this.

More importantly, is there a way to suppress these margins?\n\nA: Apologies if you've already tried this, but the only thing I can think to suggest is making sure that you use the \"Show Details\" button in the Print window:\n\nAnd then once you have expanded it, adjust the 'scale' settings under 'preview'\n\nYou will probably not be able to make it \"full bleed\" -- I believe that Preview will always require some type of margin, but as you can see from the image here, it does not have to be very large.\n(It also might matter which printer you have selected, as I believe the printer definition files tell Preview how much of a margin is required by each printer, but I could be wrong about that.)\n\nA: If you don't want any borders, create a custom paper size and change margin size to 0 as shown below:\n\n\nName your custom paper size, use it and create PDF.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open your PDF document in Preview\n\n*Go to View -> Thumbnails - you will see all the pages as thumbnails\n\n\n*Select all the Thumbnails in the tab opened in 2nd step\n\n*View > Show Markup Toolbar > select 'Rectangular selection' instrument on appeared Markup Toolbar\n\n*On 'Content' view (where the PDF pages are actually displaying) > select the area you want to leave (this selection should be applied to each page in the document, because they were all selected in the 3rd step)\n\n\n*After selection is done - Crop button should appear -> press it and you'll crop all the pages\n\n\nA: If you use Preview's \"Export As PDF...\" menu item, Preview will place the image on a page. All these attempts to match the page size to the image are futile.\nInstead, you need to use the \"Export...\" menu item, and select PDF as the image format. That will save the image in a PDF wrapper, without putting it on a page.\n\nA: Best way to convert multiple PDF's in mac is by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Keynote\n\n*Delete everything from the slide (lorem ipsum/dummy text)\n\n*Change the size of the slide to the size of your image.

In both closed clamshell mode and extension mode, a tiny bit of the screen on all four sides is cut off from the monitor -- the entire top menu bar is cut off, and a bit of the bottom dock is cut off. The settings in Display Preferences is 1080p. I've tried holding alt, and I do not see any listing for 1920x1080 -- I only see 1080i, and lower resolutions, none of which fix the problem of the menu bars being cut off. Could it be the HDMI -> MiniDisplayPort Cable? I've ordered a Male VGA -> MiniDisplayPort and will try that, but in the meantime, does anyone have any other ideas?\nThanks.\n\nA: In the display settings on your mac for the tv, is there a slider for \"Underscan\"? That's what allowed me to shrink the picture down a bit so the corners weren't cut off as much.\n\nA: As @xpereta indicated, you are suffering from overscan.  Unfortunately not all TV's let you disable overscan.  Sometimes they will, but they won't call it overscan - does your TV have a \"PC\" or \"Game\" mode?  If so, setting the input you have your Mac plugged into to one of those modes should turn off the Overscan and should thus eliminate the clipping you are seeing. \n", "Q: Why is it called MagSafe? I still get confused sometimes at the name MagSafe. Has it anything to do with the magnet in it? Why MagSafe? is it safer than other adapters? \n\nA: The magnet can save your computer. \nLet's suppose it's on a table connected to AC. If someone pull the cable with his foot by just walking by, the MacBook won't fall on the floor, the magsafe will just pop. \n\nA: This is well answered by Wikipedia’s article on MagSafe.\nSummary: to obviate expensive repairs to connectors and laptops when users tripped over their power cords, Apple designed a connector that would stay connected mag-netically under normal circumstances, but which would safe-ly disconnect when the power cords (or laptops) were suddenly pulled away.\n", "Q: What is the explorer.exe equivalent in OS X? I just started using Mac and would really like to get in depth detail about OS X. I tried disabling the desktop functionality — disabling the dock and other features as right click context menu on desktop etc.\nIn Windows, we can edit the Registry or can kill explorer.exe so as to kill the desktop environment.\nAlso, in Windows we have the Task Manager to manage all tasks.\nIs there any such thing in OS X by which we can disable these features of desktop environment and also interact with systems with something like Task Manager or just by command line?\n\nA: This is a very wide reaching question, but to answer the central theme, the rough equivalent of explorer.exe on Windows is the Finder application.  Finder is the only application you cannot remove from your dock, mainly because it is the finder that runs the dock etc, much like explorer.exe runs the taskbars etc in Windows (I think I got that right for windows)\nYou can kill the finder, and it will automatically re-spawn.  The equivalent of Task Manager would be Activity Monitor as a graphical app, and of course you have a fully featured Unix command line environment in Terminal, which allows you to interact with processes using all sorts of commands, for example:\nps -ef (lists active processes)\nkill -9 243 (send interupt request 9, or terminate with extreme prejudice to the process number 243)\nThere is no Registry in OS X, which is nice because that was a horrible idea (in my opinion), but settings and preferences etc are commonly stored in .plist files that reside in either the system or an individual users Library folder, which I suppose could be analogous to the windows\\system or user\\application data folders in Windows.\n\nA: I don't understand how this:\n\nHey I just started using Mac and would really like to get in depth detail about mac OS . \n\nconnects to this:\n\nI tried disabling the desktop functionality- disabling the dock and other features as right click context menu on desktop etc.\n\nIf you want to start learning how to use OS X, then why would you want to start by disabling the Finder?\n\nIs there any such thing in Mac by which we can disable these features of desktop environment and also interact with systems with something like Task Manager or just by command line?\n\nIf you want to use a Mac without using the GUI, you can do that. First you have to tell the login window that you want to use \"Name and Password\" instead of a list of users. To do this, go to System Preferences.app » Users & Groups. Once you see a window like this:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*click the lock on the bottom left and enter your password to unlock\n\n*click the 'Login Options' in the left column\n\n*click 'Name and password' \n\n\nThen you can log out. When the login window appears, it will show you a place to type a name and then a password. Instead of your regular username, type >console and you will bypass the GUI and be left at a login prompt.

How can I prevent Word from behaving this way?\n\nA: Note: This is a blind answer attempt: I don't have Microsoft Office on any of my computers.\nCould you try:\nSystem Preferences\n    Mission Control\n\nto deactivate:\n    ☐ Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\n    ☐ When switching to an application, switch to a space with open\n               windows for the application\n\nI deactivated both because they were always disturbing my working environment in a way I wasn't able to go ahead with what I was running in parallel on many spaces.\nSince I made this setting I'm able to work with an environment not running under my feet.\n\nA: One key issue I find with this is that in many cases, the spacing is actually not happening, you are getting the results of a justification issue. If you go into Microsoft Word, then click on the Word item, top left, and then open preferences (this would normally be \"options\" on a Windows machine) go to Display or View. This area will show you items you can list as visible in word when you work. Check the box for \"show spacing\" and you will then notice a tiny pip like mark between words in your word doc. \nIf you are in fact getting double spacing, it will show as two pips, and you will be able to identify if it is a keyboard issue, or if it is something else. If there is only ONE pip every time, then try left justifying the text, and it will compress that spacing down to be uniform instead of being spread out.\nSorry if I didn't get the names of the menu items above correct, my Macbook Pro happens to be in for repair, so couldn't double check on my machine.\n", "Q: How iPad Air gives almost same battery back up even with less battery pack? Sorry if it sounds like a noob question, earlier iPads have 42.5Wh battery pack and gives 10 hours of battery. But new iPad Air has only 32.5Wh battery, but it also gives same amount of battery backup that too with a more powerful processor and graphics. How so?\n\nA: A combination of more efficient backlighting with fewer elements, along with reduced silicon fabrication size combined with a switch to the new more efficient 64bit architecture means that the device simply runs on less power, allowing a smaller battery to be used while maintaining the customary 10 hours usage.\n\nA: I have heard several things on this. First, I believe it compares with the 3rd/4th Gen iPads in regards to battery life, so I'm not sure iOS 7 is all of it, but certainly a big part as I will explain later. I believe they have combined several things to, practically speaking, improve battery life (with using a smaller battery for the same usage).\nFirst, and primarily, I understand the iPad Air uses a different screen than the previous retina iPads. At the core of this issue is the fact that While previous retina iPad used 84 LEDs to backlight the display, the iPad Air uses only 36. While LEDs don't consume much electricity in general, this is a reduction of almost 50%, and when the screen is likely the biggest consumer of battery, this means a lot.\nSecond, I would be confident that the introduction of the M7 co-processor is not just about bringing the future closer. I would think that the M7 allows iOS 7 to customize many things in support of battery life (bringing iOS 7 into the equation). \nLastly, this is a difficult question to answer positively without talking to Apple engineers. Because they are always looking for ways to increase battery life it is entirely possible that there are other factors, such as perhaps the MIMO wifi antennas, that may actually be more power efficient than their predecessors. Small gains in some of these areas can be difficult for users to detect. \n", "Q: Setting custom bullet styles at different indent levels in Pages 5.0 I am trying to set my bullets so that they are different at each of three indent levels in Pages 5.0. An example is like this:\n\nI can accomplish this by manually changing the \"Bullet:\" tab on the format bar every time I indent:\n\nAs you can imagine, this is not an efficient way to work. I would like to create a setting/style where the bullets would automatically change when I hit \"tab\".

The following works for me in Pages version 5.2.2 (1877):\nIn case you've changed the style of any Bullet & List style, an asterisk (*) appears after the name of the style:\n\nIf you open the drop down list, you'll see an update button:\n\nYou can either press the update button, or click on the arrow next to it and select 'Update stlye' from the popup menu (featuring other options like clear, rename or delete):\n\n\nA: I hope you are saving these files to a windows compatible format.  Apple periodically torpedos it's own software to force users to upgrade in frustration.  It seems to be a five year cycle.  What that means is you have major issues with preserving your data files.   Please be cautious about what file formats you use.  most open source software supports Windows formats.

I've noticed from my DNS logs that domains associated with a small minority of my 3rd-party apps are accessed approximately every half hour or every hour, even when the relevant app is not active, and even when the phone is locked.\nMy understanding in the past was that 3rd-party apps do not execute unless they are the active app, and that notifications all come through a centralized Apple service.

You can also limit alerts to only notify you between certain times of the day.\nI just confirmed, however, that it doesn't have an exclusive \"Freeze Warning\" alert that can be turned off and on. It has \"Special Weather Statements\", and \"Winter Advisories\", which would probably function that way. However, the \"Winter Advisories\" indicates that it is for accumulation type wintry precipitation.\nIt is a free app and very easy to configure those notifications.

(For example Vine Server and TightVNC.)  Does anyone know of solutions do allow using VNC to control a 10.7.5 Mac remotely from a Windows 7 machine?  Is it question of configuring the Mac appropriately?\n\nA: I stumbled on Vine Server 4.01 by Eggplant, which solves this problem completely and is available at www2.tesplant.com (The earlier versions apparently cause trouble for 10.7+).  Note this is not the version available on sourceforge.\nVine Server 4.01 worked immediately on my Mac and automatically selected an port to use for VNC connections, something which had been baffling me before I found the Vine Server software.  I could then include this port with my Mac IP address when I used TightVNC on my Windows 7 laptop, and was able to connect remotely to the Mac with (almost) no trouble:  The only hitch was that first I needed to set a VNC password in Vine Server, which you have the option to do upon launching the server.

I am trying to create a .imscc file, a common cartridge file used for interoperability between different Course Management Systems. It is essentially just a bunch of folders and XML files zipped up and labeled .imscc. However simply unzipping and rezipping with the standard archiving utility is somehow breaking the file and Canvas, the system I'm trying to import to, does not accept the file. Using zipinfo I discovered that the files generated by Canvas were zipped with version 5.2 while the standard zip utility uses version 2.1 and I'm hoping this is the source of the issue. It's definitely something with the zipping since the file sizes are different once I've unzipped and rezipped. (No hidden resource fork files I could find, for the record) I've tried the Canvas forums to no avail so I'm hoping someone here might know a way to zip a folder with a specific zip version.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Years later, but in case someone else comes across this, Canvas has written a very useful guide to .imscc files. It discusses why they're problematic on OS X:\n\nIt won't work on a Mac, because the Mac adds junk hidden files to the zip file that cause the cartridge to not be recognized.  There might be a work-around for getting zip files without extra junk on the Mac, but I don't know it, so we just used Windows instead.\n\n", "Q: iPhone 4s running iOS 7 displays pictures taken with filter as white I have an iPhone 4s and am running iOS 7 on it. When I take a picture with the \"process\" filter, it then displays in place of the photo a blank screen. It doesn't happen when using the camera without a filter. Why is this happening, and what can I do about it?\n\nA: If you have tried all the above with resetting your camera settings and iPhone settings you might need to restore the whole iPhone. I used to see this a lot in iOS 3 and 4 where you could take pictures but they save as blank/white images. Fix was in those OSes and iDevices to DFU restore the sucker without restoring from a backup sorry to say.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my iPhone 4s. If all the iPhones are connected to the same iCloud account, you have to wipe out everything and start over (as the apple store told me). I had a warranty on mine, and went through about 4 different iPhones with the same problem, including the camera not even working at all and just showing a black screen. Then, the apple store told me they had done everything they could and the only thing to fix it would be to wipe out all information and set up a new iCloud. I can't tell you if it worked or not because I didn't want to lose everything so I never fixed it.\n\nA: Opening it and tapping \"edit\" brings it back but you have to apply another filter or magic touch for it to stick around. \n\nA: Here's a workaround: View the problem photo in your camera roll, click edit, click rotate twice to make the image upside down. Click save. Click edit again, rotate back to normal, and save. Now you have your image back!\nNot sure what causes this, but I have the problem also on my 4S.

These purchases are called In-App Purchases (IAP) and they are charged towards your card. \nIf you downloaded apps or games that have In App Purchases and you want to make sure that you don't make these purchases by mistake (kids make this mistake many times), then go to you iPhone's Settings --> General --> Restrictions --> Enable Restrictions and then under Allowed Content, turn off In-App Purchases.

Will tmutil's delete command run if I transfer tmutil from a Mountain Lion machine? I know it won't be able to trigger backups etc. since backupd won't support it, but can the delete command still work on Snow Leopard?\n\nA: After trying various techniques the only solution I've found is to connect the Time Machine volume to a machine with a newer version of OS X and run tmutil from the command line, I believe any version from Lion onwards should have this. The command to run is as follows:\ntmutil delete '/Volumes/<time_machine_volume>/Backups.backupdb/<computer_name>/<backup>'\n\nReplacing the parts in angle brackets with the correct values or, if you have the backup visible in the Finder, simply type the tmutil delete part in the Terminal then drag the folder onto the Terminal window to enter the path automatically.\nOnce this has completed, you can simply eject the volume and reconnect it to the Snow Leopard machine, which should just pick up where it left off (though it may re-index the drive during the next backup). This is okay to do so long as you don't do anything else with the drive that could introduce any incompatibilities with Snow Leopard (such as backing up with the Lion onwards machine onto that drive).\nI can't help but think that there should be a way to do this by taking advantage of in inodes to locate the parts of the backup that actually need to be removed (i.e - any folder or file where the inode number doesn't match the corresponding entry, if it exists, in the previous backup). I've used this before to quickly print a list of changes between two Time Machine backups, but there's still no way that I know of to delete the other (hard linked) directories.\n", "Q: What debug information is available on iOS Is there any logs that would give (for example) some indication of what caused Unable to connect to X errors when trying to connect to a Wifi hotspot, with iOS 7.x?\nThe seeming lack of information as to the cause of many failures + error messages on this OS doesn't help technical people like myself start the troubleshooting processes anywhere logical.\n\nA: I think there are two possibilites to get log information.\nFirst sync your device with your Laptop / PC via iTunes.

The company I work for is having an issue with users racking up huge data bills with iOS hotspot tethering. Is there a way we can push a profile that will disable this feature? I have looked through the iPhone Configuration Utility and cannot find any settings for this feature.\n\nA: As of iOS 9.2, there is no way to disable the Personal Hotspot feature through Configuration Profiles. \nThe best you can do at the moment is to use an MDM server to report on the status of the Personal Hotspot feature and manually instruct users to switch it off, or arrange to disable it through your carrier.\n\nA: Yes,you can.I just spoke with AT&T and they walk me through a process.I have IPHONE 6.\nYou go to Settings#General#Restrictions,select ON#Data# select \"Don't alow changes\" \n\nA: This is not quite what the OP is looking for because their question is coming from a business context, but for those who may be interested in this question for parental control related reasons: I think when Qustudio is set up using a VPN as instructed in the link below a side effect is that tethering is effectively disabled (you can still start tethering and connect devices but those connected devices will not have any internet access via the tethering).\nhttps://www.qustodio.com/pt/help/article/2076783/ (Note: I think the use of a Supervised phone setup in the link may not be necessary, probably any way of setting Qustudio up on ios would work. Though this is probably the most robust setup)\n\nA: If you can't find an option in iPCU, it seems that there probably isn't a way to disable the Personal Hotspot feature. Is there any way that you could cancel the tethering option with your carrier? (If you are unaware, carriers provide tethering as an option that can be disabled/enabled at carrier level at free will.)\n\nA: This is now possible (sort of). As of Apple Configurator 2.9 there is a new relevant configuration option (only for supervised devices).\nIf you open a recent version of Apple Configurator 2, create a new profile, go to the Restrictions section (click \"Configure\") and scroll down you will find \"Allow modifying Personal Hotspot settings (supervised only)\".\nThe problem is that, as highlighted in this article, you can't outright turn off Personal Hotspot in iOS 13.1 and later. So you can lock \"Allow Others to Join\" as off, but it's not that simple to prevent all possible Hotspot usage. The article says \"When [Allow Others To Join] is off, only iCloud-connected devices can connect and approved Family Sharing group members may use it, if any.\". So this means that in order to completely disable the usage of Personal Hotspot it would be necessary (as far as I'm aware) to ensure that:\n\n*\n\n*the Apple ID of the iPhone is not under the control of the iPhone user\n\n*the Apple ID is not part of an approved Family Sharing group of the iPhone user\n\n*that changing account settings is disabled on the iPhone\n\n*the iPhone is supervised and the \"Allow modifying Personal Hotpot settings\" policy has been properly set to disallowed.\n\nThen the iPhone user should not be able to use Personal Hotspot.\nThis should work, but I have not tested it out and it may not work in future if iOS changes in ways that cause flaws in this approach. Note that the Apple ID of the iPhone can be different from the iTunes & App Store account, so I can see this working in a situation such as parental controls and if absolutely necessary perhaps in business too like the OP's original question (from 6 years ago).\n\nA: usually you are able to produce/edit/setup/maintain/distribute profiles with the Profile Manager as part of Mac OS X Server\n", "Q: Does use of memory with timing CL=10 instead of Apple used CL=11 slow my Mac down?

She's  recently got an Android device but my iPhone keeps trying to iMessage her, needless to say  she's not getting my messages. I can obviously press and hold each message and \"send as SMS\" but I'd like a more permanent solution.\nHow can I make my phone always send messages to her by SMS?\n\nA: To disable iMessage on your phone (the one who has changed from iPhone to something else):\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ts5185\nSince it’s not your phone that needs changing, your friend is the one that needs to take action to Approve the request to de-register their iCloud/AppleID from their phone number here.\nAs long as their SMS number is associated with iMessage via their Apple ID, iMessage delivery will be preferred by iOS when sending. If you must send an SMS without them fixing their account, you can turn off iMessage entirely on your iPhone and then send a SMS via your cellular carrier to that contact before turning on iMessage again if you wish to have that for other conversations.\n\nA: It seems like there are one or two convoluted methods to manually reset a given contact's phone number to stop sending iMessages to them, involving switching the iMessages setting on and off and rebooting and resetting the phones while also deleting the contact and manually adding it again on one of the iPhones. That way seems pretty crazy, and I hope Apple figures out a better way to resolve this issue.\nMeanwhile, if you send a message to a non-iMessages user, and the message shows a red exclamation point (showing it didn't send), you can tap on the exclamation point and choose \"Send as Text Message\". Do this two more times to the same contact, and it seems the Messages app finally catches on that you only want to send text messages to this particular contact.\n\nA: Double click the text if you have already sent it. Then you will have an option as sending it as a text messages and hopefully it will go through. \n\nA: You might want to try heading over to your iMessage setting (located in Settings > Messages) and toggle the switch to turn iMessage off then back on again. That may possibly reset the affiliated contacts.\n", "Q: Restoring an 10.9 TM backup onto an iMac running 10.6.8 My original hard drive has failed.

My experience with Handbrake is limited. Can anyone recommendation what settings to use on Handbrake to convert HD source ( mostly 1280 x 720 ) to watch on the smaller 1024 x 768 screen without losing more quality than already lost from the smaller resolution, but also without making the files bigger than they have to be. I would also like the video to take up the whole screen without borders ( I don't mind if it stretches a bit ).\n\nA: As I've got an iPad mini myself I would definately recommend you the Apple TV preset.\nYour iPad mini does not have retina display, nor does mine (first gen.) and converting to Apple TV format is great (720p instead of 1080p) and results in a smaller size file than iPad preset does.\n\nA: As usual, the answer is “it depends” because viewing quality is subjective, space is less of an issue on a 64GB iPad than a 16GB iPad, and a desire to use Airplay means you need a higher resolution file.\nYour best bet is just to start with the iPad preset and start increasing the Constant Quality/RF factor until you don’t like the quality.\n", "Q: Install COBOL on OSX Lion Is there any way to install COBOL on OSX Lion? I tried installing OpenCobol 1.1 for Mac http://www.opencobol.org/ using fink using these command fink install open-cobol-1.0-1. Everything is installed well but when I enter the cobc --help to check OpenCobol status, terminal only returns -bash: cobc: command not found\nAny workaround on how to properly configure OpenCobol on OSX Lion? or is there any other way/s to install COBOL on Mac?\n\nA: Fink installs software in /sw/bin which isn't in your PATH by default. According to the manual you need to run\n/sw/bin/pathsetup.sh\n\nafter installation.\n\n[This] command runs a little script to help set up your Unix paths (and other things) for use with Fink. In most cases, it will run automatically, and prompt you for permission to make changes. If the script fails, you'll have to do things by hand (see below).\n(If you need to do things by hand, and you are using csh or tcsh, you need to make sure that the command source /sw/bin/init.csh is executed during startup of your shell, either by .login, .cshrc, .tcshrc, or something else appropriate. If you are using bash or similar shells, the command you need is . /sw/bin/init.sh, and places where it might get executed include .bashrc and .profile.)\nOnce you have set up the paths, open a new Terminal.app window, and close all other ones. That's it, you now have a base Fink system installed.\n\n\nA: Have you though of using MacPorts instead?  It has OpenCobol 1.1, which you can install with:\nport install open-cobol\n\nIt works on my mac (but I'm on Mountain Lion).\n", "Q: Selectively disable iCloud keychain syncing for WiFi passwords I have iCloud Keychain sync enabled, but I want to stop it syncing WiFi passwords.\nI have a portable WiFi hotspot which I use for my laptop and iPad, but I don't want my iPhone to connect to it since it has it's own 3G\nBecause iCloud is syncing the settings, within about 30 seconds of connecting my laptop to the 3G hotspot, my iPhone will connect itself. If I go into wifi settings on the iPhone and manually disconnect, about 30 seconds later my laptop will disconnect too. It seems with iCloud wifi sync on, I can’t connect my laptop to WiFi without my phone also connecting.\nThe only way to get around it seems to be disabling Keychain sync in iCloud. I’ve tried Googling, but got no real help on how to disable it without turning off Keychain, which is what I’ve done at the moment.\nI also don't want to enable 'Ask before joining networks' on my iPhone, since I'll be manually re-connecting it constantly.\n\nA: Unfortunately I can offer no perfect solution however I can confirm this shortcoming in the iCloud Keychain sync.  I've been able to reproduce this same behavior. Indeed a selective disabling ability in the keychain settings would do the trick.  Until Apple implements functionality like that I think your options are\n\n\n*\n\n*turning off wi-fi on your phone when your near that hotspot\n\n*turning off iCloud Keychain sync on your phone.  \n\n\nBecause iCloud Keychain was delayed from the original release of iOS 7 I'm guessing Apple just didn't have time to implement finer grain controls on what is and isn't synced.  \n\nA: I fixed this issue by entering a static IP address without specifying a router for the WiFi network of my portable WiFi HotSpot on my iPhone. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on the WiFi HotSpot,\n\n*Join the iPhone to the WiFi network,\n\n*Go to the settings of the WiFi network by clicking the (i),\n\n*Under IP ADDRESS, click 'Static',\n\n*Enter some IP Address, e.g. 192.168.0.10,\n\n*Enter a Subnet Mask, e.g. 255.255.255.0.\n\n\nThe iPhone will now stay connected to the WiFi network, but can not use it to connect to the Internet. It will keep using the cellular data connection.\n\nA: Not sure in which version of IOS this was added,...\n\n\n*\n\n*When connected to the unwanted network\n\n*On your device go to WiFi,.. Select the network\n\n*disable \"Auto-Join\"\n\n*switch off and on Wi-Fi\n\n\nNext time your phone finds the network, it will not join the network\n\nA: So I tried the steps using the Configurator, which almost worked.  My mac would keep connecting to the proper wifi, but after an hour or so it the keychain would pick it up. \nPlaying around, I unchecked the auto-join box on the configurator file reapplied it and it seems to have solved the problem.  My mac has been connecting to my work wifi every time I reboot and my phone hasn't been.  \nWhich is great, because I don't want my phone on my work's wifi behind my works firewalls.  \n\nA: I've just found a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new (temporary) administrator account in Mac OS \n\n*Log in as the above administrator \n\n*Connect to the wifi network (i.e. the one that you don't wish to share through Keychain) \n\n*Log out the temporary admin, and then log back into your regular account \n\n*Delete the\ntemporary admin account\n\n\nVoila, the wifi network is joined but isn't shared with any of your other devices.\n\nA: Look for files with the name 'lakitu' and either compress them or delete them entirely.  Keychain Sync will attempt to set up, but then will fail when it cannot phone home.  \n\nA: I'v also encountered similar problem. Some wifi network need me manually click \"confirm\" on its portal when reconnected, the mobile device just silently connected and i am not consciously aware of open browser to click confirm, so the mobile device stuck in such a useless connection.\nSo far, my solution is: change settings in Mac OS X: \n\n\n*\n\n*Delete unwanted WiFi settings from Network Settings, wait a minute to confirm mobile device can not connect to the unwanted WiFi without manually enter password.\n\n*open System Settings, iCloud, turn off \"KeyChain\" in iCloud settings\n\n\n*Add WiFi settings again, it will not be synchronized to mobile device.\n\n\nA: I was able to stop my MacBook from using a wifi password that should only be used on the iPhone by going into KeyChain Access -> System -> UNWANTED_WIFI_NETWORK -> Access Control and then removing airport and airportd from the list \"Always allow access by these applications\". Seems to be still connecting on the iPhone but not the MacBook.\n\nA: I too was facing this problem and came up with a slightly more elegant workaround.\nIn the end, I deleted all of the relevant Wi-Fi networks from iCloud Keychain and used configuration profiles to install the network credentials on the desired devices instead.\nI have written a step by step guide for those not familiar with creating and installing .mobileconfig files for OSX & iOS.\nWe're going to create a config profile for each SSID and password combination and install those selectively on our devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Apple Configurator (free) from the Mac App Store.\n\n*Launch Configurator, proceed past first run screens.\n\n*Select the Supervise tab from top toolbar of the main application window.\n\n*Under All Devices > Settings > Profiles, click the '+' icon to create a new profile.\n\n*Under the General tab, give the profile a name, I suggest the same as your first Wi-Fi SSID.\n\n*On the left select Wi-Fi, click Configure.\n\n*Enter the SSID in the SSID field. From Security Type, select Any (Personal). Enter the Wi-Fi password into the Password field.\n\n*Click Save.\n\n*Repeat steps 4-8 for your second and any other SSIDs.\n\n*Select each of your profiles one by one and click the share icon to export the profiles.\n\n\nNow that this is done, delete your SSID settings from iCloud keychain, e.g. on your Mac go to System Preferences > Network > Wi-Fi > Advanced and forget any of the SSIDs in question by selecting their names and clicking the '-' icon. Keychain sync should forget these networks across the board, but you may need to repeat this step on your iOS devices by selecting 'Forget this network' from the SSID settings if it auto-connects undesirably. YMMV.\nYou are now ready to install the profiles by double clicking, or by opening from an email attachment on any iOS devices, accepting all security warnings.\n\nA: Actually it's not that complicated after I have diven a bit into the matter. However I have a bit different problem, I have two Wifis, one I want for the phone, and one I want for the Mac.\nOn your Mac you have more than one keychain, as probably has your phone. However on the Mac you have to tools to manage them. In the application Keychain the Mac, you have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login\n\n*iCloud\n\n*System \n\n*... potentially some more keychains\n\n\nApply the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, put the one you want on the phone in the iCloud keychain, and remove all the references, if there are, from other keychains\n\n*Put the one for the Mac in the System keychain. (You will say, this doesn't fix my problem, my Mac still connects to the one of the phone.) \n\n*Go on your Mac to: System Preferences > Network > Wifi > Advanced...\n\n*In the list Preferred Networks make sure your Mac's network is above the other network\n\n\nNow your phone will know nothing about the Mac's network, and the Mac will prefer his network over the other one. Oh and give your Mac some time to find the correct network the first time, it may take more than a few seconds to apply the correct configuration. (Don't ask me why, just giving you the heads up.)\n", "Q: Automator service to print a relative path of selected files printing everything twice I have a service that copy the selected file's paths and put them on the clipboard.\nIt kinda works, except everything gets printed twice.\nThe service is like this:  Get selected files from Finder > run script (as arguments) > copy to clipboard.\nThe script is:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n   echo $f | cut -c 34-\ndone\n\nI cut some starting characters because I need the path relative to some specific folder, and the size is always the same.

Is there a way to fix it using the script or do I need applescript?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Okay, think I got it. This is what I initially set up:\n\nBut when I ran that service, I only got a single list of files (which is what you want, but not what you were getting).\nFootnote: when you’re having problems with an Automator workflow, a screenshot is really useful.\nSo then I decided to modify the \"Service receives selected\" field:\n\nand if you try to run that from within Automator, then you get an error message:\n\nWhen I go and run that service from outside Automator, I get the duplicated paths that you’re seeing.\nSo I think your list of selected items is getting picked up twice: once by \"Service receives selected\", and again by \"Get Selected Finder Items\".\nWhen Automator goes to copy to the clipboard, it gets the list twice.\nIf you remove one of them, then you should get what you want.\n", "Q: Two systems and SSD lifetime increase I bought a Late 2013 iMac with new generation PCIe Samsung XP941 M.2 based SSD 256Gb.\nReally powerful SSD. But of course, I was scared about SSD rewrite cycles and wanted to check it because I want to keep this computer for 5 years. Using an app called DriveDx, which can check SSD and HDD lifetime and other SMART attributes, I generated this log:\nSSD Lifetime Left Indicator : GOOD 95.0%\n=== SSD HEALTH INDICATORS ===\nID  NAME    RAW VALUE    STATUS\n 5 Retired Block Count     0    100% OK\n173 Wear Leveling Count    0x100990005  95.0% OK\n174 Unexpected Power Loss Count   0xA368E 99.0% OK\n192 Unsafe Shutdown Count    6    99.0% OK\n\nI used this Mac for 3 days. I just did clean install of OS X, installed 80 GB of software on it, and installed Windows in the second partition and 95% of wear leveling count?! \nMy SSD has 2 partitions: Mac OS X (133 GB) and second for Windows 8.1 (117 GB)\nI know that OS X is very optimized to SSD, but I have second Windows partition and don’t know how two systems will live together. Need Windows ONLY for gaming. I have two question.\n\n\n*\n\n*I heard that rewrite cycles depends on SSD size. Is it true that my drive turned into two 128 Gb SSD? When one of OS reach 128 Gb then it will rewrite cells again. Right? And lifetime will be a half of 256 Gb. And how about TRIM with two different systems. Is it working correctly?\n\n*I have an idea how to reduce read/write on Windows. Want to make 30Gb partition for Windows and install all games in my external HDD USB 3.0. Yeah, game loading will be slower, but less read/write gaming data. But this method is useless if external HDD use system SSD as temp storage between RAM and HDD.\nDoes Windows use system drive to store some temporary data between system drive and external HDD or it has direct route to RAM from HDD? If it does, using external HDD is useless, because all temp data will be passing through system SSD and make rewrite. \n\nA: Memory wear corresponds more to drive usage than to drive size. SSD controller employs wear leveling techniques to spread writes evenly over the whole SSD, so the wear level is approximately the same for all memory cells during drive’s lifetime. Assumption about wear–size relation comes from premise that larger drive will probably contain more unallocated space which could be used for wear leveling. Needless to say that this does not hold universally.\nTrim command on the other hand is issued by operating system, which notifies SSD which pages no longer contain valid data, and recent versions of both Windows and OS X supports it (although Apple does not enable it by default on 3ʳᵈ party SSD, so one has to use Trim enabler or similar application to get it working.\nTo answer your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*No, wear leveling does not care about partition scheme. Yes, Trim will work correctly.\n\n*Windows does memory caching of drive operations, yet it happens in RAM and does not involve other drives.\n", "Q: How do I move all recent photos from iPhone to PC, but keep my favourites on my iPhone? I regularly plug my iPhone into my Windows PC and 'Import photos and videos', and then delete them from the device, which is what I want.\nBut how can I select a few 'favourite' photos and keep those on the iPhone, without them getting removed when I do regular transfers to the PC of all my new photos?\n\nA: Assuming you are using iTunes for syncing your phone, take a look at this article:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4236?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nIt describes how you can sync photos from your PC to your iPhone.

I can't restore the Mac completely as it's someone elses and I don't want to remove any of their files but still want to have a \"restored account.\"\n\nA: You could make a new account, with Parental Controls setting.  Use the Parental Controls to only allow specific applications to run.  System-level programs (like anti-virus, or others) would still be running in the background; but, as far as normal applications go, you would know exactly what was being run and when.\n", "Q: how do I set my HD to be case-sensitive I am running on OSX Maverick. I just realized that my machine is case insensitive.  How do I reset my HD to be case-sensitive?\n\nA: This is the inverse of this solution on superuser.\nThe easiest way is to use a tool like Carbon Copy Cloner, clone the volume to an external drive, format your drive as case sensitive and restore it back. As this inverse question \"Can CCC backup a case sensitive volume and restore to a case insensitive volume?\" and answer on the CCC forums describes:\n\nYes, that should work fine. I just did a quick \"backup bouncer\" test with this scenario (10.6.2) and it worked great. The only potential issue is if you had some items with the same name, differing only in case, in the same directory. Only one of them would be copied over to the case-insensitive filesystem. For example:\n/Users/david/Desktop/Files\n  /Users/david/Desktop/files\nYou could have both those folders on a case sensitive filesystem, but the last item to be copied to a case insensitive filesystem would overwrite the previous item with the same name, different case. I really doubt that you've created such a scenario yourself, and the OS certainly doesn't do it for the standard installation, so I would be too concerned about this. Clone away, it should work great.\nMike\n\nThe other solution is to experiment with this older HFS Converter tool. Have a backup before you attempt this.\n\nA: Using disk utility you'll need to reformat your partition (= deleting everything) and select a case sensitive format.\nSo if you hoped to do it easily, that won't be the case. \n", "Q: Scheduled reminders question? Are scheduled reminders supposed to show up in Calendar.app if both are using icloud?  \nPS: iOS 7.0.4, OSX Mavericks\n\nA: Calendar.app and Reminders.app are distincts apps. They do not share their data even when stored on the cloud. \nSo no, Calendar won't show you reminders. \n", "Q: adb got stuck. not starting in terminal command When I start the adb deamon using the terminal, it got stuck somewhere. Any idea why ? \n\nPS: I am using OSX Mavericks. \n\nA: Try it with:\nsudo adb start-server\n\nUse your own password.\nOpening port 5037 doesn't require privileged access, but there are some other flaky things with adb such as file/device permissions, etc. to which your own user account might not have access.\n\nA: killall adb\nand voilà, no more frozen adb terminal commands.\nYou can now proceed with adb devices to test and see if you'd like.\n", "Q: Turning off keyboard popup When I connect a bluetooth keyboard to my computer, it pops up this icon:\n\nCan I get rid of that?\n\nA: DISCLAIMER:  I have never tried this - though it should not hurt your system.\nYou could remove /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin... but removing this package would take all the bezel style interface items with it.  (volume up/down, brightness, remote paring, etc.)\nRemoving this package could have undesired effects, beyond just removing the bezels, but I can't think of any specifically...   It should work...  However, keep a copy of it, make note of the permissions, and put it back if it dorks other stuff up.\nAlso, expect later updates of OS X to replace this package...\nSome may suggest viewing the contents of the package and removing just the bezels you don't want from /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources/BezelUI/HiDPI but I notice there is a _CodeSignature directory here: /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/_CodeSignature and that may invalidate the entire package.\nAfter making whatever changes you want to the BezelServices.loginPlugin you should probably restart your computer, or at the very least log out and back in - before you will see the desired effect.\nSorry for not providing a clearer answer.\n", "Q: Apple Care + Diagnostics Does anyone know what's involved with the diagnostic test for iPhone for the Apple Care+? I'm thinking about getting it, but I want to know what's involved. \n\nA: They just send a code in form of a text to your phone, you accept the code and send it back. That's all. \n", "Q: Logic board swap I have a T Mobile iPhone 4 that I'm having proximity sensor issues with. Can I take my logic board and install it in a AT&T iPhone 4 that I have laying around?\n\nA: I haven't personally attempted to (never dealt with a T-Mobile iPhone) however since both are GSM based I believe it should be possible and fairly straight forward.\niFixit has a great guide on replacing the iPhone 4 logic board.  I would follow that guide, tearing down both iPhones at the same time, looking for any differences.  If you come across a difference with the antenna connections, battery connection, etc then I would stop and use your best judgement on whether or not to continue.\nAn alternative option, if the logic boards are too different to swap, would be to remove and install the AT&T iPhone's display assembly onto your T-Mobile iPhone. This part is less likely to be different than the logic board.\nHope that helps, good luck!\n", "Q: Add Spotlight Comments without tags on OS X Mavericks I would like to add comments to files or folders. On previous OS X versions, there would be a text field to add comments that become searchable via Spotlight.\nNow, in OS X 10.9 Mavericks the text field now says 'Add Tags' instead of Comments. When I add text in there, it shows up system-wide. This is not ideal when I only want to tag a single folder with a unique phrase. Is there any way to get File Commenting back?\n\nA: Turns out, commenting is still there, just hidden a little. Commenting is now a collapsible pane beneath the Name & Extension text field.\n\n", "Q: Looking for a typing tutor app Years ago, I learned typing by a program named Typing Tutor, on DOS. XD\nNow, my son is using a MacBook and I am teaching him how to type. What software/website you recommend to learn typing on a MacBook?\n\nA: The Typing Cat\n\nI like it because:\n\n\n*\n\n*it's free\n\n*fast\n\n*gives nice progress\n\n*supports multiple layouts (qwerty, dvorak, colemak, workman)\n\n*looks good\n\n*You don't need to install anything - it's webapp\n\n*i'm creator and i'm proud of it and made it as sideeffect of teaching myself Colemak.

Rosetta disappeared with Lion, if I remember well (There were 2 OS between Mavericks and Snow Leopard).\nThe solution is either get a new version of Microsoft Office, or downgrade your Mac OS X.\n", "Q: Do either iPhoto or Aperture allow me to keep my photo files in a quite \"normal\" directory structure? I would like to switch from picasa to iphoto or aperture.  However, I have heard (and googled) that, to some degree, these programs don't keep your photos as normal photo files in your drive's directory structure, but, rather, store them in an odd, specific kind of bundle. And, so for instance, if that bundle gets corrupted, the whole pile gets lost. Also, if I want to just go and grab one JPG file as a regular file, it's perhaps hard to go get it.  So, \n(1) Am I wrong -- does either or both of those store photos in a way that is virtually the same as \"regular old directories\" I can dig into?\n(2) If your answer involves me making specific configurations in the program, are there downsides to choosing that \"non-standard\" configuration?\n(3) any quick word on the difference between iPhoto and Aperture with regards to the files directory question?\nHUGE THANKS for any thoughts --\n\nA: This exact thing stopped me from using Aperture and Lightroom for some time as that's all I could see it doing, but a bit of research showed that thankfully this was not the only way!\n\nAbove, you can see the options for where to store the photos you're importing. You can put them into the library (default), leave them alone, move them to the Pictures folder or one if it's sub folders. The final option lets you choose where they go. I actually put them into a Google Drive folder which syncs automatically.\n\nNow under that, there's the option to Move Files or Copy Files. Quite self explanatory, but it will either move the files to the location you've specified (so there's only one copy of the file) or copy them (there will be two copies of the file, one in the old location and one in the new).\n\nFinally, the last drop down allows you to choose how the files are then organised. Plenty of options as you can see.\n", "Q: How to install command line tools without error that is not currently available on Software Update server?

I am trying to create a button on my Finder toolbar powered by applescript to make a copy of a set folder (e.g. /Users/James/doc) and all files/subfolders within it to the current location in Finder.\nThe motivation for this is that I have a LaTeX documentation format with subfolders such as img that I normally add to every new coding project in a folder called doc, so having a button that adds this folder would save me time instead of manually copying it across each time.\nMy applescript skills are not very good, I have tried:\n1)\nset x to ((the target of the front window) as text) as alias\nset y to ((folder \"Users/James/doc\") as text) as alias\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    duplicate y to x\nend tell\n\nthe error I get from running this first attempt is: Can’t make target of window 1 of «script» into type text.\n2)\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    duplicate folder \"Users/James/doc\" to (the target of the front window)\nend tell\n\nwhich when run gives the error Finder got an error: Can’t set target of window 1 to folder \"Users/James/doc\".\n(PS: I already know how to turn the applescripts into Finder buttons)\n\nA: The following script should work:\nproperty y : POSIX file \"/Users/James/doc\" as alias\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set x to target of window 1 as alias\n    duplicate y to x\nend tell\n\nBy setting y as a property (and as an alias), the script should not break by simply renaming or moving the the folder to be copied.\n", "Q: Blue Box with White Question Mark On certain websites (minecraftforum.net) most images appear as a blue box with a white question mark in it on safari.

I just removed them all and everything was back to normal.\nYou can automate the process by typing the below into terminal when your pwd is the external drive. Please only do this if you are comfortable with the terminal - otherwise you could end up deleting important things.\nfind . -name \\.AppleDouble -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\n\nA: I had the same problem, but that was to due to the presence of @eaDir files.

(Preferably it'd be obfuscated in the script)\n\nA: This is what I came up with:\nIt also uses http://magervalp.github.io/CreateUserPkg/\n#!/bin/bash\n# This script will first check existing accounts for presence of USERNAME or admin    or administrator\n# If found, it will change the password to PASSWORD\n# If none are found, it will run the package create_USERNAME-1.0.pkg which creates an account with Full Name = Administrator, Account Name\n# (short name) USERNAME with the password.\n\nfunction checkusername () {\n\nlocal test1=$(dscl . -list /Users | grep -i USERNAME)\nlocal test2=$(dscl . -list /Users | grep -i admin)\nlocal test3=$(dscl . -list /Users | grep -i Administrator)\n\nif [ \"$test1\" = “username” ]; then\n  echo the username username already exists\n  echo setting password\n  dscl . passwd /Users/username PASSWORD\n  exit \nelse \n  echo\nfi\n\nif [ \"$test1\" = \"Username\" ]; then\n  echo the username Username already exists\n  echo setting password\n  dscl . passwd /Users/Username PASSWORD\n  exit \nelse\n  echo \nfi\n\nif [ \"$test1\" = “UserName” ]; then\n  echo the username UserName already exists\n  echo setting password\n  dscl . passwd /Users/UserName PASSWORD\n  exit\nelse \n  echo\nfi\n\nif [ \"$test2\" = \"admin\" ]; then\n  echo the username admin already exists\n  echo setting password\n  dscl . passwd /Users/admin PASSWORD\n  exit \nelse \n  echo\nfi\n\nif [ \"$test2\" = \"Admin\" ]; then\n  echo the username Admin already exists\n  echo setting password\n  dscl . passwd /Users/Admin PASSWORD\n  exit \nelse \n  echo\nfi\n\nif [ \"$test3\" = \"Administrator\" ]; then\n  echo the username Administrator already exists\n  echo setting password\n  dscl . passwd /Users/Administrator PASSWORD\n  exit \nelse \n  echo\nfi\n\nif [ \"$test3\" = \"administrator\" ]; then\n  echo the username administrator already exists\n  echo setting password\n  dscl . passwd /Users/administrator PASSWORD\n  exit \nelse \n  echo\nfi\n\n\n}\n\ncheckusername\n\n/usr/sbin/installer -pkg 'create_USERNAME-1.0.pkg' -target / \n\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for closing the color picker & other tool windows? Command + W won't work Many applications (e.g. Xcode, Pixelmator) can launch OS X's standard color picker tool window (seen below) and others (e.g. the font picker). These tool windows look almost like regular windows, but they have a shorter title bar and the three gumpdrop buttons at left are slightly smaller too.\n\nWhat I'd like to know is:  How can I close such a tool window, using only the keyboard?\nI've tried Cmd+W but it doesn't work for this kind of window. Rather, Cmd+W seems to cause the parent window to want to close instead. What am I missing?\n\nA: Often for these kind of 'popup'/'helper' windows, the keyboard setup to hide them is the same than to show them.\nI tested it in xcode for which the shortcut is :\nctrl+shift+cmd+C\nIt's comportement is as i expected it, it work as a toggle 'on/off' window/shortcut.\nEDIT: Forgot to add one thing, you can find that shortcut easily through the help menu of each app, i usually find myself taping 'show color' to actually see the shortcut and open the panel\n\nA: Check the menus of these apps they may display the keyboard shortcut. god knows I've neglected that enough times ;-)\nIf I recall the color picker is SHIFT-COMMAND-C to both open and close it. But that may vary from app to app.\n\nA: Once the parent app is focused, you can switch focus to the panel and close it as a window.\n\n*\n\n*Move the focus to the previous panel ⌃⇧F6, then\n\n*Close Window ⌘W\nBy default, you'll need to use FnF6 to type F6 on Apple keyboards instead of its corresponding media key, making the full key sequence Fn⌃⇧F6+⌘W.\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204434\n", "Q: Is there a way to set/unset the execute bit on a file in osx 10.6.8 without using terminal (or bypassing it)? I would like to do the following: \nchmod +x filename.txt\n\nwithout using the terminal.  Is there a way to bypass the terminal and invoke a kernel system call ? I'd rather not write a program to do this.  Instead I was wondering if I could somehow simulate a terminal with (perhaps) an application besides terminal to invoke system calls. \nI have already tried doing Command Key + i on the file to show the information GUI.  However there is no option for setting the execute bit. \nWould appreciate help from os x administrator experts in the community.\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro can do this using the following macro, which runs chmod +x on each item in the current Finder selection:\n\nDownload Macro\n\nA: You could use an SFTP client (like CyberDuck, Transmit etc) to give you a Finder-like view of your files with a GUI interface for permission control to include the x bit.\nWith Transmit you don't even need to make a SSH connection, you can just browse locally.  Not sure if any of the free clients offer this feature.\n\nA: Path Finder a Finder replacement has a Get Info that allows you to change the execution bit,\n", "Q: Does the video player truncate videos? The iPad screen has an aspect ratio of 4:3. 1080p video has an aspect ratio of 16:9.\nI tried playing a 1080p video on the built-in player and got this:\n|--------------|\n|   |      |   |\n|   | iPad |   |\n|   |      |   |\n|--------------|\n\nwhere the outer border is the movie resolution (meaning, the video is getting chopped). I am a bit surprised that I couldn't find a mention of this anywhere online. Does the iPad really truncate 1080p videos by dropping pixels on the left/right of the frame?\n\nA: This is simply an option to allow people to change between filling the screen or showing the black bars.\nIt can be switched by double-tapping the video, or tapping the two arrows button on the toolbar.\n\n\n", "Q: CTRL scroll zoom on Mavericks gone I used to be able to hold down CTRL and zoom by scrolling the mousewheel, but that is not longer possible on Mavericks.\nI've searched around and found many people saying it's in System Preferences → Accessibility, typically accompanied by an image like this:\n\nUnfortunately, that's not how my Accessibility window looks.

Where did it go? Why does it show up on some Mavericks installations, but not mine? I have the newest version of Maverick (10.9, 13A603) made from a clean installation. Can it be because other people have upgraded from a previous version of OS X that had the feature?\n\nA: OS X thinks that the mouse you are using doesn't have a scroll wheel.\n\nA: I'm here years later after returning to my MacBook Air and finding this zoom feature missing.  Type in \"zoom\" in System Preferences search and picked the \"zoom to enlarge screen\" option from the list and it took me right there!\n\nA: Press ⌘ command+⌥ option+F5, then select Enable zoom scroll gestures.\n\nA: I've just spent several hours on chat and phone to Apple support about this issue on a brand new iMac, with a clean Mavericks installation and a three year old Mac Mini with an upgraded Mavericks installation.\nThe common thread between the two machines (neither of which show this missing option) is that they both have, or used to have, the Microsoft Intellitype/Intellipoint drivers.\nMy iMac is having issues forgetting about these drivers on boot/wake from sleep/when the moon is half-full, and it seems like maybe they've interfered with the way Mavericks determined the scroll ability of the mouse.\nI started setting up the iMac with an Apple wireless magic mouse, but reverting to that doesn't make the option appear in Accessibility either.\nApple are escalating this to an engineering team: if I get any answers, I'll post back.\n\nA: You started on the correct screen but you have to go a step further and hit the OPTIONS button on the lower right of the preference panel.

On this step I selected that I wanted to encrypt it as I always did and put my usual password in it\n3) Exited Disc Utility and started the Installation process\nProblem: It froze on 18min left and I waited for about an hour. Following a post on the apple forums, I simply reseted it waiting for it to resume. However it did not come up. \nWhen I enter Recovery Mode, the Hard Drive is not there anymore.

I need to recursively extract a single JPG file from each directory root and copy them all to another location whilst maintaining the same tree structure and ignoring the other files. The JPG filenames that I need to extract all are tagged with \"RNav.jpg\". I experimented with the cp command and wild card but I could not get it to work. I'm running Mavericks and I'm a novice when it comes to UNIX command-lines.\nThe existing structure is as follows: (up to 500 directories)\n\n\n*\n\n*VNAME/PNAME1/PNAME1_RNav.jpg\n\n*VNAME/PNAME2/PNAME2_RNav.jpg\n\n*VNAME/PNAME3/PNAME3_RNav.jpg\n\n*VNAME/PNAME4/PNAME4_RNav.jpg\n\n\nA: You can easily use rsync to accomplish this:\nrsync --include \"*/\" --include \"*RNav.jpg\" --exclude \"*\" -am source destination\n\nBased off this page. This includes folders and *RNav.jpg files and then excludes everything else. I've used -a instead of -r to preserve more information (my personal preference) and added -m to prevent rsync from creating any parts of the directory tree that wouldn't contain any files.\n\nA: You can also use rsync -R (--relative) or --parents in GNU cp:\nrsync -R */*/*.RNav.jpg /path/to/target\ngcp --parents */*/*RNav.jpg /path/to/target\nfind . -name \\*RNav.jpg -exec rsync -R {} /path/to/target \\;\nfind . -name \\*RNav.jpg -exec gcp --parents {} /path/to/target \\;\n\n", "Q: How Do I Use 'cp' to Overwrite Files? Using a shell script or Terminal, how do I overwrite files that may or may not be present. I looked at man page for cp, it said use the -f argument to force overwrite. But, it does nothing.\n$ cp -f /path/to/source/file.txt /path/to/target\n\nOr is there another option to overwrite files using the common in-built command line tools in OS X? \n\nA: It might be caused by a command alias.\nTo call cp directly you can use /bin/cp src dest \n\nA: rm foo/bar/destination && cp source foo/bar/destination\n\nFirst you remove (rm) the destination, then if successful (&&) you do your copying. When removing a folder, please remember to add -r to rm (rm -r). \n\nA: It's more simple. If you use a backslash before your command it will overwrite files without prompting.\n$ \\cp /path/to/source/file.txt /path/to/target\n\n\nA: I'm stumped as to why cp is behaving this way if there's no alias involved. However, there is a quick-dirty-and-dangerous utility provided for this exact situation: yes. You can use it to pipe a continuous stream of affirmatives into any command that gives you confirmation prompts (you can use it to send any text, but the default is \"y\"). \nyes | cp foo bar will execute the cp command and bypass all confirmation prompts.\n\nA: I also had an alias messing up with -f, call cp directly from /bin and all is fine, having an alias that prevents accidental overwrites/removals by default is pretty good, so best not remove it.\n\n.# alias\nalias cp='cp -i'\n\nlike already stated, the -i flag superceedes -f, which wouldn't allow below command to perform as intended.\n\n.# /bin/cp -fauv src dst\n\n", "Q: How can I import ebooks using Configurator I have a small fleet of iPad Minis that I manage with Configurator.

I have purchased an ebook through VPP and wish to deploy them in a similar fashio to my iPads.  \nUsers do not have Apple IDs, but do have Google Apps for Education accounts.\n\nA: Due to DRM restrictions, Apple Configurator cannot send eBooks to any iOS device. The only way to do this is to either email the eBooks to the iPads and download them from there or to use iTunes (it won't require an Apple ID to do this).\n", "Q: iTunes version in AppStore download of Mountain Lion What version of iTunes comes with current AppStore download of Mountain Lion?  10.7?  11.0?\nUPDATE:\nAs of today (6-Dec-2013), AppStore has 10.8.5 with iTunes 11.0.1.\nWas hoping to avoid a whole VM install to find out the iTunes version, but it had to happen.  Will keep looking for a table view, and will post it here if I find one.\n\nA: I don't know about the versions of OS X currently available from App Store, but my 10.8.0 VM has iTunes 10.6.3 and my 10.9.0 VM has iTunes 11.1.

I'm getting ready to wipe and sell my old 4th-generation iPod touch, and I'd like to get a human-readable copy of all of my iMessages before I do so.\nSo far, I've found two solutions, but unfortunately they both cost money:\n\n\n*\n\n*imessage-backup.com - basically you upload a certain file from the backup and it does some processing on the backend to make it human-readable. $7.99 per backup file.\n\n*iExplorer can also grab iMessages. You can see them within the app, but it forces you to register ($34.99) to export them.\n\n\nObviously there is some way to extract the data. I opened up the backup file in a text editor, and I could see messages, but it wasn't really \"human-readable.\" I tried opening the backup file in SQLite Database Browser (the format in which the iMessages are supposedly backed up in), but it came up blank. \nIs there a free way (preferably on Windows or Linux) to export iMessages?\n\nA: Have you tried extracting them from your back up file? See this link.\n\nA: \nNOTE: This is not a particularly relevant answer for this question, but it seems that some new questions (new - as in June 2020) may be closed as duplicates to this one. But this question, and its accepted answer, are going on 7 years old now - things have changed. So while this answer may not be particularly relevant to this question, it may provide something useful for those seeking answers to related questions.\n\n\nSome caveats before reading further:\n\n*\n\n*This answer uses 3rd party software running on macOS 10.15.5. In my case, apparently my iPhone and my Macbook Pro keep my iMessage messages synchronized; i.e. messages I see on my phone are the same I see on my Mac.\n\n\n*This answer does not cover extraction of or access to the iMessage database file(s) from an iOS device. It may be possible to do do this, but that's not covered in this answer.\n\n\n*What this answer does do: Describe a method to extract all messages from the iMessage database (on a Macbook) as plaintext. Specifically:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The text of all messages from all \"conversations\" are extracted to a series of folders. There is one folder for each \"conversation\" - a conversation folder.\n\n\n*the textual content of all messages within each \"conversation\" are written to single file under its corresponding conversation folder. Depending upon the version of the database and/or macOS, the media content from all messages is extracted to a sub-folder.\nIn Summary: All iMessage messages may be extracted to plain text files. These plaintext files may be transferred to other machines for storage or further analysis.\n\nThe procedure:\nI have used an app called baskup for making backups of my iMessage data on my Macbook. I've found it to be useful, but IMHO it's \"not ready for prime time\". By that I mean the app looks like it was never quite finished. Version 2 of the app was available as a download, but has been removed for unspecified reasons. The author of baskup claims that he is working on version 3, but that claim has been standing since December, 2018 - over 18 months ago as I write this.\nThe author also has a GitHub repo for baskup. The app is no longer available from this location either, but there is a shell script that still works (at least partially) on macOS.\nThe author states the shell script does essentially the same thing as the app. This seems an accurate statement, except for the fact that the script does not extract the media files from \"conversations\". Whether this is due to changes Apple has made to the database, or due to a failing of the script I do not know at this time.\nTo run the script on macOS 10.15.5, I did the following:\n\n*\n\n*For reasons unclear to me, the folder location for the iMessage data is not visible from the terminal initially (ls -l failed) - even though it was visible in Finder: /Users/<username>/Library/Messages\n\n\n*In System Preferences, Security & Privacy, Privacy tab, Full Disk Access: give Terminal Full Disk Access.\n\n\n*In the script baskup.sh, make the following change:\nFROM:\nNEEDS_MODIFICATION=$(echo $OS_Version '>=' $LAST_VERSION | bc -l)\n\nTO:\nNEEDS_MODIFICATION=$(echo ${OS_Version:0:5} '>=' $LAST_VERSION | bc -l)\n\n\n\n*Place the modified baskup.sh script in a convenient location, mark it as executable via chmod, and run it. The results will appear under a folder named backup beneath the folder where you've located the script.\n\n\nA: It looks as if the open source IM client Adium can automate the process, if you've got access to a Mac that you can link (temporarily at least) to your iMessage account (you don't actually need to get the data off the iPod - Apple have done that implicitly).\nWith that in mind I'd take a look at this similar question: Export iMessages in human readable form for archival [my answer begins \"Archiving\" but there are several useful alternatives there].\nI don't know of a straightforward solution that doesn't require the Mac -- I presume Adium's import process takes advantage of native access to various Apple libraries -- but if you're inclined the Adium source and developers might also offer some clues to a cross-platform solution.\n", "Q: How to disable Command + Control + Arrow Key shortcut in Mavericks I use Sublime Text and this shortcut (Edit > Line > Swap Line Up/Swap Line Down) allows me to move lines of code up and down in the file while shifting everything around it. On my new computer this command moves the window currently in focus to the next space. \nI checked the keyboard shortcuts in Preferences but could not find it. Where else can I find the shortcut and disable it so that I can use it in Sublime?\n\nA: As an alternative solution for Sublime Text (if you want to keep the new OS key mappings) you can add the following lines to your user key bindings file (in menu Subline Text 2 > Preferences > Key Bindings - User):\n{ \"keys\": [\"super+shift+up\"], \"command\": \"swap_line_up\" },\n{ \"keys\": [\"super+shift+down\"], \"command\": \"swap_line_down\" }\n\nThis will map ⌘+Shift+↑ or ↓ to the Swap Line Up/Down commands.\nA similar issue exists with the batch selection commands usually mapped to Ctrl+Shift+↑ or ↓.\nThese can be remapped using the following settings:\n{ \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+shift+up\"], \"command\": \"select_lines\", \"args\": {\"forward\": false} },\n{ \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+shift+down\"], \"command\": \"select_lines\", \"args\": {\"forward\": true} } \n\nThis will map Ctrl+Alt+Shift+↑ or ↓ to the batch selection commands.\nObviously you can change the combinations to whatever you prefer, but these did not seem to be used for anything.\n\nA: Cmd+Ctrl with ↑ or ↑ is not actually mapped by Mac OS X, which is where the confusion is coming from.\nIt is likely a window manager like SizeUp that is overriding those shortcuts. You can disable the shortcut in the application's preferences.\n\nA: Try looking at System Preferences > Keyboard (It should be on the second row and third column of the window).\n\nYou can also go to search and type \"Keyboard\" in Spotlight.\n\nWhen you have found it, go to the \"Shortcuts\" tab (it's on the third one from the left) and look for the shortcut there.\n\nWhen you do, delete it from there and try using Siblime again.\n", "Q: Can I access an account that was created as a \"Network Account\"? I have a user account that I created on our network at work via Network Accounts. There are some files I want to retrieve from one of the users desktop.

Is it possible for me to access the files on the desktop of this user?\nI guess I could take this iMac back to work and hook back up to the network. I would like to avoid that if possible. I am running OSX 10.8.5.\n\nA: You can use Back to My Mac and access it there. There is a support question on Apple's website that explains how to set it up on both Macs. I should tell you that the requirements are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Macs need to be running at least 10.7 or higher (you said your iMac is running 10.8.5, so your iMac should be good; don't know about your other computer though),\n\n*an iCloud account,\n\n*and both Macs need to be connected to a router that supports router that supports either Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) or NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP) with either of those features enabled (you can check your manual of the routers to know how, but most modern routers should have either one or both turned on).\n\n\nI forgot to mention that you should also check off the \"Screen Sharing\" and \"File Sharing\" boxes from System Preferences > Sharing.\nBe sure that when you have enabled Back to My Mac in the iCloud settings in System Preferences, it should not have a yellow warning sign. If it does, click on it and follow the instructions there.\nWhen both Macs have been set up, go to the Mac that you want to use to access the other and go to Finder. You should see the name of the computer there. Click on it.\nYou should see a bar with two icons: \"Share Screen…\" and \"Connect As…\". Click on \"Connect As…\". You should now see a box with a username field and password field. Type in the account that you wish to access and click \"Connect.\" You should be able to access the files from there.\n", "Q: Insert date & time in latest version of Numbers I've looked around online and have found references to an \"Insert => Date & Time\" capability in Numbers for OSX. But it's not there in my version of Numbers (3.0.1 -- 1483). Has this capability been removed? \nI've pasted a screenshot of my Insert menu below.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple removed that option in the menu bar. However, you can still get the today's date by manually typing it (obviously) or by selecting the cell and typing \"=Today\", followed by the return key.\n\n\nYou can also type \"=Date\", followed by the return key. You can then manually select the date there.\n\n\n\n\nA: Just happened upon this thread looking for an answer to the same question. What I have discovered is to type \"= Now.\" This will give you the current date and time at that moment.\n\nA: According to Apple (http://help.apple.com/functions/mac/5.0/), you'll need to enter \"=NOW()\".  Not having used Numbers very much, I didn't know you had to enter the () after the word.\n\nA: Type the formula =NOW, copy it to the clipboard, and paste the formula results. It's not exactly a hotkey, but it is mouseless and works \"out of the box\".\n=NOW, Enter, Up, Command-C, Shift-Command-V\n\nA: When you \"double click on the cell\" in Numbers v.10.1 \"Insert date and time\" is no longer greyed out!\n\nA: As others have mentioned, the Insert > Date & Time command is back, but it's seriously flawed:\n\n*\n\n*If you have the cell Data Format set to 'Date & Time', it ignores\nthis completely, overwriting it with a long formatted string and\nresetting the cell format to 'Automatic'.\n\n*While the command is called Date and Time, it only inserts the\ncurrent date. The time is always reset to 12:00:00 am!\n\nThis is either a bug, or just very poor design. I reported this to Apple back in March 2018, but over four years later they still haven't fixed it.\nSo, what can you do? Using =TODAY or =NOW is not a drop-in replacement as @GeorgeC pointed out in the comments. But thankfully, Apple gives us apps like Automator and Shortcuts, which allow us to roll our own solutions. Let's do it in the newer Shortcuts app:\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Shortcuts app and click + in the toolbar to create a new shortcut.\n\n*Click Shortcut Name and type 'Insert Date and Time'.\n\n*From the Action Library tab in the right sidebar, find the Current Date action and add it by double-clicking or dragging it to the editor workspace.\n\n*Add the Stop and Output action after this. It should automatically add the Date variable from the previous action.\n\n*Select this Date variable, and in the pop-up, change the Type from Date to Text.\n\n*Switch to the Shortcut Details tab in the right sidebar, and select Use as Quick Action. (I also gave mine a keyboard shortcut, which works in TextEdit, but not Numbers for some reason.)\n\n*In Numbers, double-click a cell and use the right mouse button to bring up the contextual menu. With any luck, Insert Date and Time will now be an option at the bottom of this menu. I find it works great—the way Apple's command should (but doesn't) work!\n\nHere's a screenshot showing the basic setup in Shortcuts:\n\n", "Q: iPhone/iPad back up to different hard drive?

Is there a way to disable/lock the Wi-Fi network access on an iPhone 4S?  Crazy question, I know.  But I got my son an iPhone and do not want him to have an Internet access. I disabled his data through my account with Sprint.  But with Wi-Fi he can still get on the Internet when he is within reach of open hotspots (we do not have open Wi-Fi at home).\nI want to be able to disable the Wi-Fi capabilities of his iPhone so that he cannot access the Internet.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: There isn't a way to do this directly on iOS. What you can do that is the closest thing to what you want to achieve is to follow these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Restrictions > Enable Restrictions and create a passcode that only you will know (and it should be different from the passcode that has been set on your son's iPhone, if there is one).\n\n*Then deselect the following items: Safari, iTunes Store, iBookstore, Installing Apps, Deleting Apps, in-App Purchases, Siri, and FaceTime (of course, deselect whatever you see fit, but my example is an extreme example).\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*On the same Restrictions menu, go to Accounts and tap \"Don't Allow Changes\".\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Restrictions once again, and go to Cellular Data Use and tap \"Don't Allow Changes\".\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Finally, go back to Restrictions, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and tap the following switches under Game Center: \"Multiplayer Games\" and \"Adding Friends.\"\n\n\n\nI'm assuming that you don't want your son to use any form of Internet on the iPhone AT ALL. This will limit the iPhone to the most limited form as possible. I can't guarantee that your son will not be able to use the Internet in some way, shape, or form, but at least you have now severely limited the chances.\n", "Q: How can I compile and run C in Xcode? Our teacher is teaching use some Data Structures algorithms that are being implemented in C. He uses Visual Studio in class, but I want to be able to run simple programs that we write in Xcode.\nI've tried to run the code but in Xcode 5 the options to do so are greyed out. Besides just installing Xcode, what steps should I need to take so that I can run simple C programs on my Mac?\n\nA: The above answers are all great. I'll just add my $0.02. I like using Xcode where it is basically just a text editor (not the more complex Xcode...which I need to get used to!). \nSo, here's what you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Xcode\n\n*Ignore the pop-up window asking about a new project\n\n*At the top of your monitor, select \"File\"\n\n*Select \"New\" \n\n*Select \"File\"\n\n*You can then select a C file as your option. \n\n\nYou can skip steps 3-5 with command + N!\nYou'll get a basic editor you can write your code in (nice syntax coloring, basic display, etc.). \nThen, you can just compile and run your program in your terminal window (your standard gcc file and ./a.out stuff). \n\nA: *\n\n*Open Xcode\n\n*Select File->New->New Project\n\n*Select macOS (OS X in older versions) -> Command line tool\n\n*Choose C as type\n\n*Fill out the name and the other relevant wizards parts you need\n\n*click the main.c file to select it\n\nAnd you should be good to go\n\nA: In Xcode 6 & 7, you can do the following steps:\nCreating the File\n\n\n*\n\n*Select File > New > Project > OS X\n\n*Select Command Line Tool\n\n*Click Next\n\n*Input your Product Name and choose C as the language\n\n*Click Next\n\n*Choose where to save your project. \n\n*Click Create\n\n\nRunning the Code\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Product > Run\n\n*Check the console to check result.\n\n\nThat's it!\nCheck your the main.c file and you'll find a pre-filled 'Hello World' code in the editor. Good luck!\n\nA: Hope my experience will help, cause I've just went from confusion like you had to enjoying coding C on my MacBook in the past month.\nNeed to give all the credits to the online resource where I learnt everything about setup the environment. http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/index.html  It taught me to just use the shell command through the Terminal instead of a IDE.\nHere are the steps as I summarized:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Xcode, which you've already done\n\n*Install a text editor (optional): this is for you to edit your code, NOT for compiling or running.  I personally like Atom now, but there are Emacs and Vim etc.\n\n*Start Terminal from the Utilities folder in Applications.  I use iTerm2, same function as Terminal with more features.\n\n*Navigate to the folder containing the source code.  Like cd ~/Documents/C/, in which there is your main.c file for example.\n\n*Use your text editor to create a plain text file called Makefile, no extension.  It contains:\nCFLAGS=-Wall -g\nmain: main.c\nclean:\n   rm -f main\n\n\n*Then compile source code, from the Terminal, type and see\n$ make clean\nrm -f ex1\n$ make ex1\ncc -Wall -g    ex1.c   -o ex1\n\nmake clean delete the last compiled file if you want to re-compile.\n\n*Then run the compiled file, type\n./main\n\nThen you should see the results of the code like you saw from your class.  Keep in mind there very likely are some differences between C compilers in Visual C++ and GCC in Xcode.  But so far I like very much coding by shell commands.\n\nA: I ran into this issue myself following Learning C by Dan Gookin with exercise files. I learned that in order to be able to run the .c files, a project must be created then the files must be added specifying no target membership, otherwise Xcode will compile the entire files three as one executable and the errors encounter would prevent the program to run.\n", "Q: Ways to extend lap top battery life on Mavericks What are some ways to extend lap top battery life on Mavericks? I've heard that disabling notification center via the terminal can help. I've also had a friend tell me that disabling window animations can make a difference; however, the effect from this seems like it wouldn't be noticeable. Are there any other ways?\nDisable Notification Center\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist killall NotificationCenter\n\nDisable Window Animations\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool false\n\n\nA: Disabling Notification Center or disabling those animations won't have any real effect.\nThe best way to increase battery life is to turn down the brightness of the display. If for example a MacBook Air is idle and the display is set to maximum brightness, the display consumes about three times as much energy as all other components. You can see power consumption information from http://www.apple.com/environment/reports/:\n                     off    sleep  idle with display off  idle with display at maximum brightness\n13-inch MacBook Air  0.26W  0.69W  1.6W                   6.0W\n15-inch MacBook Pro  0.33W  1.09W  8.53W                  15.6W\n15-inch retina MBP   0.30W  0.87W  not mentioned          17.2W\n\nYou can use top to find processes with the highest accumulated (-ca) CPU use:\ntop -ca -o cpu\n\nYou can see the average CPU use of processes over a longer period by for example adding this line to crontab:\n* * * * * ps -eco '\\%cpu= comm='|sed $'s/^ *//;s/ /\\t/'>>~/Desktop/cpu\n\nThen run this later:\nawk -F$'\\t' '{a[$2]+=$1}END{for(i in a)print a[i],i}' ~/Desktop/cpu|sort -rn\n\n\nA: Know when process is running wild. You know that moment when the CPU suddenly run wild and your left palm feels the heat is increasing rapidly? That’s when you should open Activity Monitor, and see if there are any processes are consuming your battery life.\nSort by % CPU usage and you’ll always see the most consuming process on the top. Not all CPU consuming processes are bad, you might actually use some of them, like when you’re rendering videos, but usually browsers like Safari nor Chrome should be on the top of this list. The average CPU process rate should be around ±10% at most.\n\nAs mentioned in the answer by Lauri, disabling Notification Center won’t have any real effect on the battery life. It only take a few seconds to show notification which won’t consume as much battery than playing music or watching videos.\nSo here are few tips to ensure you get the maximum battery life on MacBook:\n\n\n*\n\n*Only run the apps you need. See if there are any background apps that run automatically without your permission. You can see the list of app in the Users & Groups and choose Login Items.\n\n*Brightness matters a lot. Keep it low unless you really it to view the screen.\n\n*Don’t bother to clear caches daily. They’re there to improve your Mac’s performance. Writing and reading from RAM, although not significant, exhausts battery life.\n\n*Use battery regularly. You can keep your MacBook plugged all day, but ensure to use it at least about 40% per day so the battery lifespan lasts longer.\n\n*It’s always nice to use MacBook in low temperature location. Heat hurts battery.\n\n", "Q: Exclude all .git or .svn folders from Spotlight index I would like to exclude all the .git and .svn folders on my hardrive from the Spotlight index. I know I can manually add them through the GUI but since they are many of them, and often new ones, it would be difficult.\nIs there any way to exclude a folder by name (rather than full path)? Or is there any way to exclude the folders using the command line (in which case, I could automatically find them and exclude them from time to time)?\n\nA: It is possible to exclude a folder using the command-line.\nFrom there try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal window\n\n*Type \nsudo defaults write /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array-add 'path/to/exclude'\nSo I guess you can try this using xargs' magic:\nsudo locate .git | xargs -I {} defaults write /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array-add  {}\nYou can check it worked using this:\nsudo defaults read /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions\nYou can remove all entries (there is no -array-remove option) using this:\nsudo defaults write /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array\nBe careful with these commands, I don't know if there are side effects.\nI could not really check this worked for my .git folders since none of them were displayed by spotlight search before nor after running these commands.\n", "Q: Some program windows in Windows 8 on macbook pro has small text size On Retina Macbook Pro I am running Windows 8.1 via Bootcamp on Macbook pro\nHere is my DPI options(default):\n\nBut some windows showing incorrectly or with a small text size or icons:\n\nAlso I am experiencing similar issues with some other programs\nIs there any way to fix hat?\n\nA: Basically it is happening when program is not adapted to run in high DPI screens.\nHigh DPI explained:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 8.1 - High DPI\n\n*Resolution explained (pixels, DPI, inches)\n\n*High DPI Settings in Windows\n", "Q: Should I use raid 0 with my optibay drive? I installed a 120gb SSD today. My optibay currently holds my MBP stock drive (5400 RPM HD 320GB). Since they have different memory sizes, should I put them in raid 0? The only reason why I want raid 0 for convenience. I want to store all my music and photos in the optibay drive, but it seems like there would be a ton of configuration nuances with iTunes and iPhoto. If one drive were to fail, however, then I would lose all my data. Could someone please correct me on this? Any help and instructions are appreciated. \n\nA: As the saying goes: \"The difference between RAID 1 and RAID 0 is that the zero stands for how many files you're going to have after a hard disk failure.\"\nPutting your 320 GB hard drive and your 120 GB SSD will allow you to share the space in between the two drives, but the risk in doing so is that you may have a failure at some point that makes your data unrecoverable. \nIf you want to set up your hard drives in a RAID 0, I would recommend also setting up a backup solution that regularly backs up your files to a location that is outside of your laptop. That makes sure that your data can be recovered in the event of a failure.\n", "Q: Microsoft Office for Mac 2011: add-on that can open Visio and Project files I've been using OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 and Office for Mac 2011.

It is however still on his iPhone. Is there any way to extract the video from there? I can't see an open in option or anything. The device can't be jail broken due to some MDM software on it.\nThanks all!\n\nA: Assuming iOS 7.\nIf the iPhone has been synced with the target Mac, it should be straightforward. Go to the home folder and then go into the folders in succession\nMusic -> iTunes -> iTunes Music -> Movies\nOnce in the Movies folder, all the movies that you see on your iPhone should be visible.

Is it unlocked so that I can just go to T-Mobile or AT&T prepaid, by just popping in the SIM card?\n\nA: If you bought the iPhone at full price ($549 or $649) then yes it is unlocked.\nIf you and bought it subsidised (where the price is $99 or $199), no it is not.\nThis restriction is required by the carrier, because they paid the remainder of the price, and will claim it back from you (with a tasty profit!) over the duration of your contract with them.\n\nA: First things first: if you have inserted a Verizon SIM card (or any other carrier's SIM card) within 20 minutes of turning on your iPhone, you are out of luck as it will ONLY work on that carrier. This is a very weird thing that happens with the iPhone, but I believe Apple added this on purpose to sidestep something within the carriers.\nAs for whether or not a prepaid plan will work, apparently it can. There is a webpage on WikiHow that explains how to do it (look at the iPhone 5 method in your case).\nI'm not too sure if it will work on a Verizon iPhone, but it never hurts to try.\n", "Q: How do I deactivate my microphone and iSight for security reasons? In OS X 10.8 it is possible to log in via SSH and get access to hardware input devices like microphone and iSight camera. Thus it is possible to remotely record audio and video of other users sitting in front of the machine. I consider this a severe security issue!\nHow to exploit this issue\nLuckily, I didn't have to face a microphone exploit yet, but this question on Stack Overflow shows a little python script which enables you to capture pictures using the iSight camera from the command line. I don't think it is much harder to capture video.\nQuestion\nOne can disable the microphone using\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext\n\n…unfortunately this also disables all audio output.\nThe same applies for the iSight camera by unloading IOUSB.kext, which most certainly might break all devices connected via USB, if not even causes a kernel panic.\nHow can I disable the microphone and iSight camera in an iMac (late-2012) under OS X 10.8.5 without breaking other system services?\n\nA: To disable iSight and other cameras, use:\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleCameraInterface.kext\n\n(tested on 10.9)\nI'm not aware of a way to disable audio input without affecting output. It's the same hardware so unloading/removing the kext probably won't work. One step you can take is to turn the input volume down to zero in your sound preferences, but of course anyone who's able to log in will be able to turn it back up.\n\nA: I think you can specifically target your iSight camera by (re)moving\n/System/Library/QuickTime/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer.component\nAccording to this: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20070323094959262\nThe link does mention that it is 10.4 specific and I haven't tried it under 10.8/10.9 but it's a good place to start.\n\nA: You want to check out isight-cli, which basically changes the permissions on the necessary drivers as suggested here and here.\nisight-cli is based on original applescript isight-disabler.\n\nA: An update for OSX 10.11.6\nEnable/disable the camera\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, you need to disable SIP by rebooting your mac in recovery mode (hold \"Alt\" key while rebooting then open the term.app and run csrutil disable and finally reboot).\n\n*I'm not a huge fan of file deletion in sytem folder. Use the power of Unix by changing changing the access rights of your selected files/folders/component. (secure if you have a decent admin password).\n\n*In a terminal, type the following commands for disabling the camera: \nsudo chmod a-r /System/Library/QuickTime/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer.component/Contents/MacOS/QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer\nsudo chmod a-r /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreMediaIOServicesPrivate.framework/Versions/A/Resources/VDC.plugin/Contents/MacOS/VDC\nsudo chmod a-r /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreMediaIOServices.framework/Versions/A/Resources/VDC.plugin/Contents/MacOS/VDC\nsudo chmod a-r /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreMediaIO.framework/Versions/A/Resources/VDC.plugin/Contents/MacOS/VDC\nsudo chmod a-r /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/AppleCamera.plugin/Contents/MacOS/AppleCamera\n\nchmod a-r removes the read right (-r) for all groups and users (a).\n\n\n*Launch Quicktime/PhotoBooth or any other app which uses the camera.

It just places the files in and doesn't ask questions, and then you reboot… Really, proceed with caution if you do that. It worked for me on the JDK, but I was in a slightly different situation.\n\nA: I could solve the problem in the meantime. Some days after posting this question, I tried to install a new version of the Adobe Suite and I noticed that I was unable to uninstall the old version with kind of the same behaviour as described for the Java installer.\nTherefore, I decided to make a fresh install of Mavericks. After that, not only the installing issues were gone, but additionally the Finder freezes don't appear any more.\nConcluding, it seems to me that making only an update when switching to Mavericks shouldn't probably be done if making a backup and fresh install isn't too much work.

The benefit of Apple making the hardware AND operating system is that they are able to control an manage power way more effectively than Windows is on any machine. It also depends on if you're using BootCamp or a virtual machine like Parallels or Virtual Box.

Maybe I could delete the 1.4GB data that was already downloaded so it starts from the beginning?\nA quick find didn't reveal where those files are:\n$ sudo find / -name \"*Logic Pro*\"\n\nUPDATE: directories that I try deleting:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Users/jviotti/Library/Caches/com.apple.logic10\n\nA: You can find the location of your downloaded content by running the following command:\nsudo find /private/var/folders -name \"com.apple.MusicApps\"\n\nYou can safely delete this entire folder and attempt to re-download.\nIf your Logic Pro X is not sandboxed, the content will be located in /Library/Application Support/Logic.\n\nA: I got it to re-download the files after deleting the temporary cache which is stored somewhere under /private/var/folders. This is what I ran to remove the files.\nFirst find out where they are by running:\nsudo find /private/ -name '*com.apple.MusicApps*'\nThen if you see results you can either delete them manually or with find once you are sure you have located what you want.\nsudo find /private/ -name '*com.apple.MusicApps*' -delete\n", "Q: Will Find my iPhone app still run when my iPhone restarts?

When I use sudo killall httpd, they stop and are restarted right away.  Activity Monitor shows that the parent process is launchd, but how do I determine which agent or daemon is starting it so I can disable it?\nlaunchctl list | grep httpd shows these results:\n302 -   0x7f94ea700dd0.anonymous.httpd  \n92  -   org.apache.httpd\n\nI look in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist and it shows the following.

Check the man page for launchctl, and the \"-w\" option under the \"load\" command. So, simply examining the file won't necessary tell you if its disabled or not. Clearly its not disabled :)\nTry \"launchctl unload -w org.apache.httpd.plist\". If that works for you, then you'll still be able to start it on demand with \"launchctl start org.apache.httpd.plist\"\nIf that doesn't work, try \"launchctl remove org.apache.httpd.plist\" which will not let you manually start.\n", "Q: Display weather information in the Mavericks notification center? The weather display in the notification center is a great feature in iOS, and I would love to have it on my mac as well. Is there a technique or app that allows this?\nGoogling for the answer to this question has not turned up much, although there are suggestions that one might be able to kludge something together using Growl.\n\nA: OS X Yosemite's Notification Center comes with a Weather widget preinstalled.\n\nAdditional locations can be added to the widget:\n\n\nA: You could try hooking up something using IFTTT for getting some alerts with Boxcar and then launch the notifications using a shell script to drive the notifications on OSX like this example does for monitoring services.\n\nA: As far as i know you can only get it on mavericks by jailbreaking it my be different for mavericks by now but last time i checked there was no way so i assume you would need to jailbreak.

I've heard about people being able to access your computer remotely. How can I tell if my computer has been compromised? \n\nA: Applications like Little Snitch can be very useful for figuring out if your computer has been compromised, as they can detect incoming and outgoing connection attempts.\nI would say that most likely the appearance of an unexpected person on Skype is just due to a spammer or scammer adding people at random from a list of names or email addresses. It's also possible that it's a case of mistaken identity, where the person on the other end is trying to contact someone with a similar name. Be wary of social engineering attempts, and do not open any links or attachments from this person! \nIf the person is bothering you or you're just weirded out, you can block the individual by right-clicking their contact portrait and choosing \"Block (name)...\".\n", "Q: Weather App in iOS 7 - can't get the top location to delete or move I can move or delete any of the locations on the list except the one at the top.

What the title says. If this is the case, even if you choose to delete everything OS X related and put entirely Linux in your box; you'd still be screwed. Hardware keyloggers sit between the keyboard and the motherboard, and record everything typed to memory (perhaps to be siphoned off to a remote server without your knowledge the first time the machine gets online) Also, macs are famously sealed-off black boxes that how it works under the hood is kept an intentional mystery by Apple.\nWell, your thoughts, fellow mac-folk?\n\nA: Any system can contain embedded an hardware keylogger or trapdoor. Most of them do contain the last one. But a keylogger isn't as easy a task to integrate in a completly undetectable way. A keylogger will have to log.\nHere is the weak point where you will be able to detect it.\nWhichever is the way to log a keylogger will use, you will see something grow inside (hidden disk space, hidden memory space) or escape one way or another (network, light, radio-wave, sound, infrared).\nWhen I look back at the way some bug in serious software aren't fixed, I can be nearly certain that a keylogger won't stay undetected for long.\nA keylogger will talk and bug.\nTaking into account the risk involved for any company trying to make such an evil minded choice, and a dangerous one (the keylogger once discovered will also be used by the enemies)\nI doubt any risk aware company will take this risk.\nFrom my point of view, this is clearly a vital and an unacceptable risk.\n\nA: Not the exact same thing, but by chance I've stumbled open this semi-related blog post from 2009: \n\nApple keyboard firmware hack demonstrated\n\n\nA: they would need to have some memory to store the keylogged data.. this is extremely unlikely.. but i guess there is no way to be 100% sure if you are 100% paranoid.

So press CTRL-C as written on your keyboard, not the C on Dvorak layout or any other layout. Matlab has hardcoded the interruption command to a key, not a letter.\nDebugging\nThe way I do it is to create breakpoint with the looping vars\nfor ii=1...10000\n     if isequal(ii,2000)  \n         %Add here a breakpoint\n     end\n     ...\nend\n\nwhere the breakpoints make it possible to stop the execution. Also force-quiting Matlab is the other way. I know no other way to them.\n\nA: It is CTRL-C, but Command-period works as well.

You can't interrupt a low-level function \ncall, such as a big matrix multiply or backslash or something like that.\n", "Q: How do I open Outlook .msg files on my iPad I work with a Document Management System that has my Outlook email archive stored as .msg files...  which is nice and all, but I can't get my iPad to actually open them up properly. \nA search through the App Store results in two apps that claim to support this:\n\n\n*\n\n*MSG File Viewer ($0.99) - doesn't seem to associate itself properly with .MSG files in Safari/SkyDrive/etc.\n\n*Klammer ($0.99 + $0.99 in-app purchase) - shows up in Open With... dialog, but shows up empty in the app.\n\n\nHowever, neither seems to associate itself with .MSG files in Safari/SkyDrive/etc . Also, support for inline images and formatting seems sketchy at best. \nI also noted that if I forward a .MSG file in an email, Mail will sometimes open it properly by converting it to .EML on the fly. I just can't figured out how to use that to open .MSG files on any other location, though. \nAre there any other solutions I'm not aware of? It would be really nice to be able to access these files on the road.\n\nA: You don't need an additional app. You can either sync your email messages to your iPad from your computer - instructions are in the user's guide as well as here:\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1386\n\nor you can set up your iPad to connect directly to your email provider - instructions also in the user's guide and here:\n\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/ipad/mail/\n\nIf your email service is an Exchange server, I'd recommending setting up your iPad to talk directly to the server. Then your mail, calendar and contacts, if you wish it so, will synchronize automatically without you having to sync with your computer.\n\nA: I have a solution for the challenge when you try and open an .msg file in OneNote on an iPad.  The solution was to install the $1.99 app called “msg Lense”.  When you click on the .msg file in OneNote on your iPad and it asks you to choose a viewer, just choose this app and it will open the email, AND it will allow you to open any word or other file attached to that email.\nFor only $2 a frustrating issue helped me avoid firing up my laptop just to view emails I have attached to my notes in OneNote\nInteresting that Microsoft has not solved this issue as it has been on many people’s list of issues for years and with OneNote being incredibly good at copy-past just about any content from any source.\nAnyway - buy this app “msg Lense” (yes, it is spelled LensE) if you just want to view emails .msg files on your iPad OneNote\n\nA: The best solution I have found for this problem other than trying the .msg viewers is to convert the .msg files to .pdf because they can be read.  I don't know if this is a possible solution for the user as his issue is that they are in a document management system.  If the DMS can convert to .pdf that could be a solution.\n", "Q: How can I install .ipa file to my iPhone simulator?

Apple initially made it hard for people to re-download the installer - presumably since many are equally confused as you are. However, lots of people were confused on how to re-download the app and a change was made a while back to show it as a download to anyone that \"purchased\" an upgrade.\n", "Q: Software not available from update server when installing Windows 8.1 on Mavericks I am trying to install Windows 8.1 on OS X Mavericks via Bootcamp.

I restarted and then clicked on Upgrade and the same result....screen never moves to another?\n\nA: Safari 4.1.3 is the last version of Safari for Mac OS X Tiger, so you're out of luck on that end. Furthermore, Chrome and Firefox (in their current versions) do not support Tiger either.\nYou can try looking for Mac OS X Leopard, since Safari 5.1.10 (the last version of Safari for Leopard) is available for download, but that's as far as your computer will possibly be able to go, since the latest version requires, at minimum, OS X Mountain Lion, which requires an Intel processor.\nThis Apple Discussions page suggests you could also try TenFourFox.\nIf you don't like any of these options, you'll have to purchase a new Mac.\n", "Q: How can I make Apple's keyboard shortcuts work in Chrome? Mavericks has a TextExpander-like feature that lets me create text shortcuts for long phrases. (When I type \"ttys,\" for example, it replaces it with \"talk to you soon.\")\nThe feature works beautifully -- except in Chrome, where it won't work at all.\nAny advice on how to make it work?\n\nA: This may not be a great solution if you have too many shortcuts to transfer, however it is nice, quick, and simple if your shortcut list is modest, or you don't mind having to manually enter and update them:\nAuto Text Expander for Google Chrome \nThe extension also can do backup and import/export via JSON for the future. \n\nA: Chrome doesn't call Apple's spell checking code and instead wrote their own keyboard handling routines. Since this is how the program was made, there's not much of a workaround except to do your typing in a program that calls Apple's text input libraries and paste the results into Chrome. (Similar to how Dictionary lookup using Control-Command-D didn't work for several years on Chrome either until the code was updated to call Apple's SDK for that function).\nYou can see this Chromium bug might apply and also, that Chrome is in the process of removing it's own spell checker / autocorrect mechanism and shifting to rely on Apple's implementation: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?q=label:Cr-UI-Browser-Spellcheck\n\nA: I don't think there is an actual option to enable this feature in Google Chrome. It seems like this feature is only enable for built-in software?! Correct me if I'm wrong with that assumption.\nMaybe you will have to take the painful route and set up a text expander add-on in Google Chrome. Looks like the \"easier\" option to me.\n\nA: This google chrome extension works for me perfect. \nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-text-expander-for-go/\n", "Q: How come Android finds lists Wi-Fi networks that OS X doesn't? I have a MacBook Air with OS X 10.8.5 and a Samsung cell phone with Android. I use the Wi-Fi heavily on both (I travel a lot, and only use Wi-Fi when I'm out of the US) — often in cafes — and I rarely ever have a problem. Wi-Fi is usually perfect and easy in any cafe.\nBut there are a couple of cafes I frequent where, my Samsung Android phone picks up the cafe's Wi-Fi signal — and picks it up very strongly — but on OS X, the network just doesn't list it at all. I know it's not a signal-strength issue, since on the Samsung Android, the signal is super strong in all 3 cafes. But OS X for some reason just doesn't find the network — not even when I go to \"Join other network\" and type in the network name.\nWhat could cause this? …and is there a solution to this that you would recommend?\n\nA: 1) Possible interferences :\nDo you have many Bluetooth peripherals connected to the Mac ?\nTry tuning off Bluetooth and connecting to Wi-Fi…\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1365 \n2) Possible mal-functionning hardware :\nCheck your machine is working with extra channels than 1 to 13 (802.11g) by going in the \"Apple\" menu, hold down the \"alt\" key and select \"System Information…\".\nThen in the \"System Report…\" window select in the sidebar \"Wi-Fi\" or \"Airport\" under \"Network\".\nYou should see next to :\n\"Supported PHY Modes\" : 802.11 a/b/g/n\n\"Supported Channels\" : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140\nIf this is not ok you might need to have your machine serviced as every MacBook Air are compatible with 802.11n. Beware that some channels are banned in some countried thus restricted on your machine : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels\n3) Possible problem with the configuration of the router :\nI have encountered sometimes connection drop / timeout with 300 Mbps optimisation (using wide channel configuration 2,4GHz and 5GHz : 20 MHz and 5GHz only : 40 MHz) and some computers. Best would be if the cafes you go to could make sure to have an optimised network for everyone.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the newtork requires a password : WPA / WPA2 encryption instead of WEP ;\n\n*Support for both channels (if using 40MHz with 2,4GHz channels can create performance and reliability issues) ;\n\n*For a cafe IP addresses should be cleaned regulary (leased time 1 hour) ;\n\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht4199\n", "Q: Disable iBeacon settings There has been a lot written in the last day or two about iBeacon. Are there settings I can tweak so that\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm not tracked in stores\n\n*I won't receive messages about products in my vicinity?\n\n\nA: The quick answer is that iBeacons use bluetooth low energy, so simply turning off bluetooth will opt you out of tracking as well as notifications.\nThe longer answer is that iBeacons don't track you or your iPhone/iPad in the same manner that WiFi scanning and cell towers actually can track your devices. You choose which beacons to pay attention to.\nThink of the difference between a red traffic light and a red light camera. The red light is a beacon that you could choose to track and pay attention to. The red light camera doesn't care whether you are paying it attention - you get captured if the device is recording. The license place on your vehicle is the same as your WiFi MAC address. It is trackable and traceable. Bluetooth low energy and iBeacons doesn't have any trackable item until you pair with a specific device so you are safer than with WiFi.\nFor this reason, most retailers have been tracking WiFi for years before iBeacon bluetooth were introduced. Even though bluetooth has the ability to work at shorter ranges and provide a more precise location, it has privacy built in to the way beacons are architected. You will want to disable WiFi and perhaps turn off your cell entirely if you want to have more meaningful privacy in store spaces where companies are monitoring traffic. With iOS 8, you can just forget all the WiFi networks you don't want to track and the device should be anonymizing your WiFi MAC address (the license plate) so that everyone has the same \"mask\" on until you actually join a specific named network.\nIn summary, to avoid seeing any iBeacon advertisements, don't install apps that will look for certain beacons and do things. If you do install those apps or passbook items, then disabling bluetooth will still opt you out of iBeacon activity on the device.\n", "Q: How does one install \"afloat\" on OS 10.8/Mountain Lion? On OS X, I want to show an always-foregrounded, transparent image while working on the application underneath it, for tracing purposes. As mentioned in this other stackexchange question, the solution is the application called afloat.\nGreat, so how do I get it to work? The old domain now just redirects to a github project page. There is no README, and there are no installation instructions. I found a closed/wontfix \"how to install\" ticket, and pieced together some probable instructions. This is what I have so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the SIMBL zip file\n\n*Unzip the file\n\n*Double-click/install SIMBL-0.9.9.pkg\n\n*Create SIMBL bundle dir: mkdir ~/Library/Application\\ Support/SIMBL/Plugins/\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Install from the git repo:\n\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/millenomi/afloat.git\n$ cd afloat\n$ xcodebuild -configuration Release install\n  # verbose output trimmed, except for last line:\n  ** INSTALL SUCCEEDED **\n$ mv /tmp/Afloat.dst/Users/`whoami`/Library/Bundles/Afloat.bundle/ ~/Library/Application\\ Support/SIMBL/Plugins/\n\nSo now what? Did I do this correctly? Am I supposed to see additional \"Window\" menu options?\n\nA: It appears that this did work. I did find that my X11 app had the extra Afloat options in the Window menu. Reading around, it seems it only works on Cocoa apps, so I guess X11 is Cocoa but nothing else is.\nI also found a downloadable dmg installer. I'll try this out too.\n\nA: I recently tried to install it on Mavericks and couldn't get any of the above instructions or downloads to work. I found a compiled download linked from this helpful article at http://www.chrisvanpatten.com/master-windows-afloat-mac which links to an installer (currently version 2.4) at http://mac.majorgeeks.com/files/details/afloat.html\nThe instructions and downloads worked great and all is well on Mavericks.\n", "Q: Is Apple TV intelligent enough to stream directly from a NAS? I'm considering purchasing an Apple TV. I understand that I need to include movies in iTunes in order to play them on the device. On my iMac, my movies are linked in iTunes over a shared drive to my NAS — when I play video, does the file stream from my NAS, to my iMac, and then to the Apple TV? Or is the Apple TV intelligent to understand the remotely linked file?\nI'd like to avoid the unnecessary bandwidth on my network.\n\nA: To answer the op's exact question, \"No, ATV is not intelligent enough to stream directly from a NAS\".  Others have pointed out some options, like using ATV2+Plex, or PlexConnect (which is VERY difficult to setup).\nLet me thrown my $0.02 in by saying that unless you're running your iMac over wi-fi, this will work fine.  Even with my older 802.11g network, my Mac mini (hooked up to Ethernet and thus hooked up \"closely\" to the NAS) could pull the files off the NAS and stream them (over wifi) to the ATV.  No issues at all.  I'm on 802.11n now, and it's handling 1080p streams no problem (don't remember if I tried that on the \"g\" wifi).  In fact, with the Mac on Ethernet, it can download new videos from the iTunes Store while serving up content from the NAS to the ATV.  It's really not a lot of bandwidth.  You can check in the Activity Monitor.  I'm always surprised by how little bandwidth it uses.\nHowever, if your Mac is on wifi too, I could see that there could be some problems, but a \"n\" (or \"ac\") grade wifi should be able to handle it.\n\nA: It may not suit you, but, if your NAS is capable of running Plex, you can add PlexConnect script to any Mac/Windows computer in your house, which will allow you to hijack the Trailers application in the AppleTV (2nd/3rd gen., no jailbreak required) and have it stream your movies/TV shows from Plex in your NAS box. Google Plex and PlexConnect to find more.\n\nA: If you're planning to go for a NAS, Plex and ATV then I suggest you use PlexConnect and follow the instructions found here. The best thing about this is that you don't have to jailbreak your ATV. Personally, I'm very satisfied with it!\n\nA: If you can get an AppleTV 2nd generation (which can be jailbroken unlike the 3rd generation, for which a jailbreak hasn't yet been found and probably never will be), you can jailbreak it and install FireCore's aTV Flash. With aTV Flash, you can stream directly from a NAS, which works very well. Otherwise, you're stuck with streaming through iTunes.\nAnother option (which may or may not be suitable for you) is to get a Roku instead of an AppleTV.\n\nA: I bought an Apple TV with the same goal, to bad it's not working. I tried Plex, but didn't satisfied my needs as my NAS isn't powerful enough for my needs.\nMy current setup exists of an iPad, connected to my TV/Video-projecter with an Lightning-VGA/DVI adaptor. The iPad is able to play video's directly from the NAS (or other media's), even AVI-formats. I'm using MoliPlayer HD (free) now, but there are other applications we can use.\n\nA: there are some NAS' out in the stores witch have the possibility to have an itunes on it so you can stream to your apple tv via this itunes.\ni use it like this old macbook pro with itunes and webserver, also i have enabled a samba share for the windoof pc's in my household and 2 external harddisks connected to it.\nmacbook acts like a nas.\n\nA: aTV Flash black lets you jailbreak your Apple TV and it has many additional features but one of the the best is it will steam from a NAS device directly to ATV.  No Computer/phone/iPad required.  However, details on which NAS devices needs some more research.\n\nA: Use Air Video HD app. I don't know enough about the tech side to explain, but it works. Installs on the Mac and iPad / iPhone, and operated from the iPad.\n\nA: What kind of NAS are you using? In stead of trying the Apple TV to play movies from a NAS, you can think the way around where the NAS can stream movies to the Apple TV over Airplay. Of course, you'll need a computer/browser/iPad to initiate the movie, but from on then, all computers can be off as the NAS will play and stream.\nSynology DSM 4.x can do this, pending on the hardware you can play more or less video formats.\nMyself, I'm using the free VLC for iPad which can play directly from a NAS and can Airplay it to an Apple TV.\nToo bad Apple isn't supporting this directly :(\n\nA: Install the NAStify Player app from the app store, not pretty but works fine.\n\nA: Works well for me using iPad/iPhone app PlayerXtreme\nThe App can access all network computers NAS devices etc (very smart at doing this) and AirPlay to Apple TV.\nIt also downloads music, photos, videos etc to your iOS device so you can play at another location or at your home base. \nPlaying from a local Downloaded file within the PlayerXterem App may help your wifi traffic. \nNo need to contemplate jail breaking. \nI have played a 4K video from a NAS to TV via this app and AppleTV where the TV cannot handle 4K direct (only 1080), but somehow Playerxtreme via AppleTV works. Normal stuff works smoothly but 4K file sizes will have your network working hard.\n\nA: Directly from a NAS?  No.  Not with the software that Apple provides.\nThe currently-sold ATV (4th gen and later) can, however, stream from a Mac via Home Sharing.  If your Mac's Music app (for example) is set up to play music from your NAS, then Home Sharing will in turn stream it to an ATV.\nYou don't need to leave the Music app running (as was the case with the old and now-defunct iTunes streaming), but the Mac needs to be on-line, since you're not streaming directly from the NAS, but instead from the Mac, which in turn reads content from the NAS.\n", "Q: Alias\\symbolic link icons I installed Mavericks on an external SSD drive and now want to point my music, pictures and video to ones on my previous drive.\nI created a link using ln command, a link was created.

I have noticed that GarageBand receives the \"note off\" signal, because when recording and a stuck note happens, the sound is not recorded onto the score or registered on the track. Furthermore, the \"stuck note\" stops if I press the \"play\" transport control, even if there is nothing in the song.\nThus, it appears to be a Core Audio issue of some kind.

The output encoding could be AAC or MP3, it wouldn't make any difference.\nWhich applications would be easiest to do this, and what steps should I take?\n\nA: To rip audio from a video file, you can use iTunes. It'll create an AAC file.\n\n*\n\n*Drag the video into iTunes\n\n\n\n*Select the file in Movies, and hit the menu commands File - Create New Version. Hit the Option key, and the command Convert To AAC will be enabled.\n\n\n\n*The AAC file will be created in the same directory that the mp4 video is located.\n\n\nA: I use Evom from The Little App Factory to achieve this. It works very well and it's free.\n\nOnce you download it, you will see this window:\n\nDrag and drop the video(s) onto the window and another window will pop up.\n\n\nFor the most amount of control, I recommend the \"Folder\" tab. Here, you can create a new name for the file, select where you would like it to go, a range of formats, and even the quality. After that, select \"Convert\".\nIn my case, I selected it to be converted to an MP3 file and move it to the desktop.

If you never need those video files again, select \"Delete source files after encoding\" in the action \"Import audio files\".\n\nA: Using QuickTime Player:\nFile / \n  Export / \n    Audio Only\n\n\nA: You can use -c copy with ffmpeg to extract audio without re-encoding:\nffmpeg -i input_file -c copy audio.m4a\n\nRun ffmpeg -i input_file to see what format the audio stream is. If it is MP3 instead of AAC, change the extension of the output file to mp3.\nThis would re-encode the audio as 256 kb/s AAC:\nffmpeg -i input_file -ab 256k audio.m4a\n\nIt is likely that ffmpeg is not on your system. You can install brew (brew.sh) and then do a brew install ffmpeg to install ffmpeg.\n\nA: I have used the Mac app, Music Converter, a number of times without any problems.

I had painstakingly gone through and created symlnks to a whole host of files in my system.

This of course means all my symlinks have broken.\nAliases deal with this just fine but as stated above, I have to stick with symlinks.  Is there any way to mass-edit these symlinks?  I just need to change the name of the drive in the path.  The old location was for example:\n/Volumes/Old Drive/path/to/file\nthe new one is:\n/Volumes/New Drive/path/to/file\nSeems like there should be a workable command line way to do this since they'll all require the same change.  I found at least one utility (Make Symlink) which claims to allow this, but it appears to be many years old and looks abandoned.  I couldn't even manage to decompress the .sit archive it was packed in.\nEDIT:  I found this page, which suggests that in unix anyway, proper us of ln should do the trick, but so far it doesn't appear to do anything - not even output any error message when pointed to a non-existent symlink.\n\nA: Got it!

This assumes that the expected name of the symlink, is identical to the original name of the linked item.\nThis is of course for fixing a single link, but from here I can imagine it wouldn't be overly difficult to script a solution that applied something like this recursively.\n", "Q: Where is Preview.app's .savedState?

I am running OS X Mavericks.\nIs there any way to enable mouse support in the terminal app, short of switching to iterm2 or something like that?\n\nA: Indeed, OS X Terminal can receive mouse input through ⌥-clicking:\n\nHowever, certain Terminal apps don't receive the passed mouse input.\n\nYou can install MouseTerm which will pass mouse events to the terminal.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Mouse button reporting.\n  \n*Mouse scroll wheel reporting.\n  \n*Simulated mouse wheel scrolling for programs like less (i.e. any fullscreen program that uses application cursor key mode).\n  \n*Terminal profile integration (with preferences dialog).\n  \n\nIt's a SIMBL plugin, so you'll need to install SIMBL to make it work. I recommend installing EasySIMBL instead though.\n\nA: iTerm 2 supports all mouse interactions out of the box.\n\nA: As of OS X El Capitan 10.11, Terminal supports Mouse Reporting. You configure application programs to enable it. For example, in Vim use set mouse=a.\nTerminal supports reporting three mouse buttons and a scroll-wheel, along with Shift, Meta, and Control modifiers. The Option ⌥ modifier key maps to Meta (regardless of the “Option is meta” keyboard preference). You can use ⌘-Right Click for mouse-button three on a two-button device (which also works for “middle-button paste”, which invokes Edit > Paste Selection ⇧⌘V when Mouse Reporting is not active).\nYou can use the Fn modifier key when clicking, dragging or scrolling to temporarily bypass Mouse Reporting and interact with the terminal view. You can also use the View > Allow Mouse Reporting menu item to bypass it for longer periods of time or when Fn isn't available.\n\nA: At least in Terminal.app 2.6 enable \"Allow Mouse Reporting\" in menu \"View\" gives mouse support in Midnight Commander.\n", "Q: Will Find my iPhone Lost Mode be useful if stolen phone as shows Offline? My phone was stolen last night. I made sure it was in Lost Mode in iCloud and it was immediately in Offline status when I open iCloud. I am positive the thief switched it off. Now I am 100% certain the Find my iPhone option was turned on on my iPhone, but will the \"Lost Mode\" be of any help if it was not turned on on the iPhone? Would it be showing \"Offline\" if I did not turn on the option?\n\nA: Lost mode combined with iOS 7 is extremely useful as long as th phone has cellular service or is connected to WiFi networks that it trusts. The device needs to connect to the Internet to be re activated after wiped, at which point it will enter lost mode and refuse to work again without your password for Apple ID. \nBe sure to not remove that device from your account since that makes the device far more risky and expensive to sell, pawn or try to use by the thief or even someone that ends up with the device. Someone could desolder the CPU and try to reserialize or cannibalize the parts, but the quick hit of cash for a stolen device is defeated by Activation Lock and Lost Mode features.  \nThe device shows as offline when it hasn't checked in recently to the Apple servers despite an attempt by the Apple Push Notification service attempting to send a check in request to the last active address of the device on the Internet. \nIf the device ever gets connected to Wifi or cellular data reconnects it, your Lock request will get sent, acknowledged and you'll get an email. If you are quick, you can log in to find my friends and see if the location data updates as well at that point. \n\nA: Apple states:\n\nIf your device is offline, the passcode lock and tracking (if applicable) take effect the next time it’s online.\n\nSo the Lost Mode should be activated. \nI am not sure why it would show \"offline\" though. Apple support says you should \n\nsee the device’s current location, as well as any changes in its location on the map.\n\n\nA: It seems the whole thing is of any use only when the device is online. I say this from personal experience.\nKeep you eyes glued to your email, and when you see the notification, immediately use the Find my iPhone app or https://www.icloud.com/#find to grab the location. If you aren't quick enough, and the device is already off or offline again by the time you get there, you'll get no location.\nMy stolen iPad went online briefly today, and I see I got an email, but it is offline again. I'm shocked that I have no access to the location data. In my opinion this is a glaring, unforgivable omission in the service. The thief can simply make sure it is offline or turned off and I have nothing in my hands. It should just send the location data to Apple's servers so that at least I have a last know location in my hands. But Apple thinks different.\nAt least the thief might be a bit afraid at the moment, as he may think I do have the location. I hope he doesn't sleep well.\n", "Q: Does archiving already archived messages means deleting them? I am using Mail.app using an imap-account (not Gmail).\nJust as it should, the app created an 'Archive' folder where it put all the messages in on which I used the archiving function.\nI was browsing this Archive folder when, out of habit, I used the archiving function again on one of the conversations. This caused the conversation to disappear and I cannot find it anywhere: Not in any folder, the trash, anywhere on the imap server or the Mail.app or its cache.\nHow can this be intended behavior? Is this a known bug (I could not find any mention of this online). Where are my messages?\nUpdate\nI contacted Apple support. This turns out to be a known bug. Look out.\n\nA: I just tried this in a non-Gmail account and the message has vanished! It is in none of my folders, including the trash. You can use Time Machine on Mail to get your messages back.

I recently updated my iPad and now if I go to You Tube (i.e., youtube.com) using Safari and try to make a video full screen the navigation bars etc... still take up about 1/5th of the screen at the top.\nIs there a way to get it to show the video on the entire screen?\n(Note I am not using the You Tube app and I would prefer a solution that doesn't require using it)\n\nA: Use the 'desktop' mode instead: it's found at the end of the YouTube menu (click on the logo at the upper left).\n\nA: The fullscreen YouTube uses of its website, is not a \"real fullscreen\" feature. It just maximize the size of the video to the size of the webcontent. \nSo unlike Vimeo (for example) you won't get a real fullscreen without YouTube updating it's webplayer (or you using the YouTube app) . \n\nA: I had the same problem until I started watching the videos through Google videos instead of browsing through youtube. That way even if the video you want to watch is on YouTube you can still make it full screen through Google videos.\n\nA: Use quietube.com. It embeds any YouTube video with the default player, so the native fullscreen feature works.\nYou can use their bookmarklet, or just paste the whole YouTube URL after http://quietube.com/ .\n\nA: Once in the “false” youtube fullscreen, try a two finger swipe, as if zooming in and you’ll get it. It works for my iPad on iOS 11.3.1. \nAfter years the solution came accidentally. I tried to zoom in while in fullscreen like in a video from “Photos”. Once in full screen yo get the 2 buttons for 15”rewind o fast forward. , It was so obvious, having already tapped the “fullscreen” button on youtube, that I hadn’t even thought about.

I keep receiving a message from Time Machine saying I don't have enough room to backup and to remove files. The Time Machine disk is 1 TB as well and I'm at a loss to see what to do.\n\nA: Time Machine stores multiple versions of file which change over time so if the backup drive has the same size as the source drive this situation does happen after some time (it also may happen if the backup drive is bigger but much more seldomly). At this point you have two options\n\n\n*\n\n*swap your backup drive for a bigger one and start a new backup on that\n\n*accept the fact that older versions of your backup will get deleted by Time Machine\n\n", "Q: Backing Up OS X Server to Local Time Machine Server Folder I've setup Time Machine Backup services on Mavericks Server. I want to backup the backup server itself using Time Machine, but to the folder that I setup \"Time Machine Backups\" where all the other backups are being stored, instead of backing up to the root drive.\nThe only option I have when I select a disk using the server's Time Machine configuration is the drive itself, and not the \"Time Machine Backups\" folder I see from remote machines.\nIs what I'm trying to do possible?\n\nA: No, you cannot. Backing up to a local volume (what you're having the server do) uses a slightly different backup format than a network backup (what your server is allowing clients to do). With a local volume backup, the backups are stored inside a folder named Backups.backupdb which is at the root of the backup volume (not in a subfolder). With a network backup, the backup is stored inside a disk image, and the Backups.backupdb folder is at the root of the volume inside that. Because the network backup is wrapped in a disk image, that image can be almost anywhere (volume root, folder, subfolder, whatever); but this flexibility does not exist for a local volume backup.\n\nA: Can't you point the OSX Server's Local time machine to its own share?\nLike point it to afp://osx server ip\nOr is it not possible to mount a local share locally?\n", "Q: Transferring photo libraries? I have two macs, one with Mountain Lion and one with Mavericks. Do I need to put Mavericks on the other computer to be able to properly transfer the photo libraries?\n\nA: The version of your operating system is not important here. You need to be careful of the version of your iPhoto. \nOld iPhoto library can be updated by newer iPhotos. But newer iPhoto library cannot be opened by old iPhotos. So if your target mac has an up-to-date iPhoto, you can copy it directly. \n\nA: As Matthieu says, the version of the OS is not important, but the version of iPhoto is. However, if the older version is on the target machine, all is not lost as you can \"revert\" an iPhoto Library to an earlier format with iPhoto Library Manager. See there for details:\nhttp://www.fatcatsoftware.com/iplm/Help/downgrading%20a%20library%20to%20an%20earlier%20version%20of%20iphoto.html\n", "Q: Maverick - OSX dock auto hides when connecting a display through hdmi? When I connect my TV to my laptop, the Dock starts to auto hide. Is there a way to keep the dock in its before I connect an external display? Also, when go to  > Dock, the auto hiding is off...\n\nA: It's due to the new multi-display handling in Mavericks where the Dock can be made to show on both displays. It's not actually 'auto-hiding' hence why the auto-hiding is still disabled.\nTo go back to the old multi-display method, go to System Preferences → Mission Control and uncheck Displays have separate Spaces.\n", "Q: Another device is using your IP address mac, what do I change my IP address too? Our internet router often stops working at home, but for the the second time only I have got a pop-up error saying:\n\n\"another device is using your ip address\".\n\nWe have an iPhone and a Macbook but as far as a remember this problem occurred for a brief time when we were without an iPhone. In any case, I had a look at this post which suggests the problem is a cause of the iPhone and Macbook trying to use the same address. \nI changed the IP address via System Preferences > Network > TCP/IP > configure IPv4 Using DHCP with manual address to 11.11.11.11. I then switched back to Using DHCP and clicked 'Renew DHCP Lease'. \nWhen I checked the IP address again it changed to 192.168.1.11. It works now but I wonder if this is a permanent fix or will this problem keep occurring?\nUpdate: The problem persists, but his time without the error message which would leads me to believe that there another problem in addition to the \"Another device is using your ip address\" problem.\n\nA: Often times these issues can be solved by rebooting ALL computers (iPhones, Macs, etc.) on your local LAN. A reboot causes DHCP to request a lease. And your router should only hand out ones that are unused. So every device should get a unique address\nHOWEVER it is possible that you have manually assigned an IP address to one or more devices, so check for that. Make sure all are different and all are on DHCP.\nALSO possible, someone unwanted is on your network. Change the WiFi password just in case.\nFailing all of that assign everything a static IP address like this\n192.168.1.x\nWhere x is as follows\nbetween 2 and 254\n  unique (only one device has any one number)\n  Your subnet mask is likely 255.255.255.0\n  Your Gateway is likely 192.168.1.1 (your cable modem or WiFi access point)\n  Your DNS will vary\nThe last three should be listed in your network System Preference and will be the same on all devices (only the IP address must be different). Select the connection (WiFi) and click Advanced, then the TCP/IP and DNS buttons. Record the subnet mask, gateway and DNS servers. Then fill that info in on all devices.\nIt would be a good idea, if you do this, to make a note of all the settings and which device gets which address. Keeping track can be a pain, which is why we have DHCP. It is supposed to hand out all that info automatically. So it is likely that there is a device on your network NOT set to DHCP.\n\nA: Check on your router which other computer or phone is using your IP address.\nNote your actual address, let's say it is 10.0.2.1.\nLook at your router ARP table and note the MAC address associated with\nyour IP address 10.0.2.1.\nIf this MAC address belongs to one of your equipment\nthen everything is OK. Just check that this equipment is actually within reach of your router\nand make it renew its DHCP lease. For example on an iPhone, if your home network is named home_Wi-Fi this is:\nSettings > Wi-Fi > home_Wi-Fi > DHCP > Renew lease\n\nIf the same IP address is regularly attributed to 2 different equipments connected through Wi-Fi, this may be caused by a poor quality wireless connectivity. Here is the scenario which might be\nat play:\n\n\n*\n\n*10:00 alice get address 10.0.2.1 from the router, with a lease time of 4 h\n\n*10:30 alice goes in the living which is on the border of the wireless network and loose her connexion, but she doesn't care because she is just wotking on a heavy presentation with Keynote\n\n*14:00 the router expires the lease attributed to alice\n\n*14:30 bob ask a new DHCP address to the router and get 10.0.2.1\n\n*15:00 alice goes in the kitchen which is inside of the wireless network and automatically use her actual IP address which is still 10.0.2.1\n⇒ duplicate IP address detected\nIf this MAC address doesn't belong to one of your equipment\nthen you have a neighboor who is hacking your network.\nIn such a case, I advise you to fire a new interesting question:\nHow to get rid of my wireless scroungers?\n", "Q: Which apps do these menu bar icons belong to?

For years, I've enjoyed the feature in OS X Font Book where you can type in custom text and scroll through all the fonts to preview it.  Now on Mavericks, when I try to do this, it only works for single-font families.  All font families containing multiple fonts (e.g. bold, italic, etc.) will only show the default sample text.  How can I change this behavior to be like older OS X versions, where you can see the custom text for all fonts?  I'm hoping there's a plist somewhere that can be edited.\n\nA: This works (at least in Yosemite Public Beta 2):\nOpen Font Book, select \"Custom\" from the View menu, double-click in the preview area and type what you want. Then, close Font Book. Then, re-open Font Book. Now, whatever you had previously typed should be the preview text for every font.\nAnnoying, yes, but it's a lot better than nothing!\n\nA: I think that you are talking about the font-families. Since Mavericks, font-families are grouped and. You can get a custom preview by clicking on the triangle next to the font name ane selecting the font you want.\n\nA: I had the same problem and wrote a script for an overview in a html-file. For me this solved the problem. So maybe this is a solution for you, too.\nI think it is not difficult, but you have to know how to open Terminal application.\nIf you're familiar with scripts and Terminal and so on, save the code below with a name of your choice at a place of your choice. Otherwise I'll recommend the following:\nOpen the TextEdit application. Open a new file (File -> New), click on Format and choose Make Plain Text. Then insert the code below and save the file as fonts.sh on your Desktop.\nThen open Terminal application and type\ncd ~/Desktop\n\nThen type the following, which will list all files on your Desktop - and also the just created fonts.sh\nls -l\n\nIn the line with the new \"fonts.sh\"-file you'll probably see something like\n-rw-r--r--@\n\nThe first four signs mean, that you can read (r) and write (w) on this file. But at the moment you don't have the right to execute it. Therefore type\nchmod u+x fonts.sh\n\nIf you now repeat the \"ls -l\" command, you should see that the rights of fonts.sh changed to\n-rwxr--r--@\n\nThe new x shows, that you can execute the file. Now you can generate the promised html-file :-)\nJust type\n./fonts.sh\n\nThe next time you want to use the script, you only have to start Terminal, and type\ncd ~/Desktop\n./fonts.sh\n\nI hope, this helped.\nAnd here is the code to save in a file:\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\necho \"\\n************************************\"\necho \"Welcome to an overview of your fonts\"\necho \"\"\necho \"Advice: This script generates two files: fonts.html and fonts-in-system.txt, second one will be deleted again.

You want to scroll quickly through all of your fonts waiting for the perfect choice to leap out at you. What was once a minute or 2 of tapping the down arrow is now an hour of tedious clicking.\nI have not gotten Font Book to do what it used to do. But I purchased an App from the App store called FontPreview (4.99) and it does what Font Book used to. Perhaps not as well, but it will do for me until Font Book fixes this \"bug\" which renders it useless for me.\nI am not endorsing the app. I have used it for 5 minutes. Just trying to help those as frustrated as I am. \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fontpreview/id537580561?mt=12\n\nA: Apple changed the way Maverick views fonts by grouping the fonts in families. You can only have a custom view in one family at a time, there doesn't seem to be a way to view multiple families. I'm just hoping when we can update to 10.9.3 that is is fixed. \n\nA: I have the same problem and desire to have Font Book behave the way it used to.  I work in advertising and write headlines and subheads and want to easily scroll through a custom sentence while seeing the fonts change until one \"leaps out at me\" as the right one to choose!  If you find a way to do this on Mavericks, I would greatly appreciate it.  \nIn the meantime, I have found a small workaround and that is if you click on the small grey triangle before each font name to bring up the options like Bold, Italic, etc. you can click on bold for example and your custom words will still be there.  I lose it when I click on the font family name.  So I opened up all the fonts by clicking on the triangle then I put in my custom sentence and be careful to click from Bold to Bold instead of from font name to font name.  This seems to work in a pinch, but it's very frustrating. \nWould love the Yosemite version of Font Book to work better than Mavericks. \n\nA: Use Text Edit: Paste your text, select it, then Format > Fonts > Show Fonts.

I own a PNY - StorEDGE 128GB and I remember that it was initially recognized as a fixed/permanent disk like a hard disk.\nI reformatted it to add encryption but now the disk is shown as a removable device. This keeps tools like SkyDrive from using it as a target.\nCan I set the volume type somehow?\n\nA: Yes! You can change the volume from a removable device to a fixed disk by flipping the removable bit. Lexar made an application for Windows called 'Lexar BootIt', a well known application for this task.\nI found a solution involving DD, but I have not tested it and I'd severely recommend backing up your card before doing anything with DD/Terminal. I created these instructions quickly. If you aren't comfortable with Terminal, use Windows! I am not responsible if your SD card is permenantly damaged in this operation. dd is exceedingly dangerous!\nUse diskutil list in a Terminal instance to list all volumes. I found my hard drive under /dev/disk1. Remember to substitute disk1 in the later commands with your own disk name.\nDon't forget to unmount the disk:\nhdiutil eject disk1\n\nAnd now the command:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk1 bs=1 count=1\n\nAgain, back up EVERYTHING before doing anything with dd!\n", "Q: How to get iTunes to stop trying to download purchases I purchased a TV series season last year to watch on my Apple TV. My Macbook still tries to download all the episodes every time I launch iTunes.\nI read online that you can delete everything in the itunes>media>downloads folder which I have, restarted, and still when I open iTunes a black download button pops up and when I click it, it tells me that I have all these pending downloads. When I click to see what they are, it automatically tries to download all the episodes.\nI have purchased movies, but it never tries to make me download any of them. I watch movies and tv shows purchases generally on my Apple TV. And I like that I can view my iCloud purchases in iTunes, and decide to download something if I want to. But I do not like that it keeps trying to make me download all these episodes that I have no reason to want to store on my HD.\nIs there a way to perminately tell iTunes to stop trying to download something?\n\nA: Go to iTunes > Preferences > Store and then untick the 'Always check for available downloads'.\nTick the 'Shows iTunes in the Cloud purchases' too, if you purchased on your Apple TV.\n\nA: I was having this same problem and I followed the advice from coliff (which I will paste below)\n\"Go to iTunes > Preferences > Store and then untick the 'Always check for available downloads'.\nTick the 'Shows iTunes in the Cloud purchases' too, if you purchased on your Apple TV.\"\nExcept when I got to that point the 'Always check for available downloads' was not checked. I am aware that this may have changed (probably many times) since March of 2014. I found my problem to be that the \"Store\" category has 3 separate sections (the middle of which is \"Automatic Downloads\"). I had only one box checked and un-checking that lone box seems to have fixed the problem.\nSo for anyone having trouble with this in the future I think having any of the boxes under the \"Automatic Downloads\" section will cause iTunes to start re-downloading whatever purchases fall under the checked box upon restarting the application. \nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Rename when copying from case-sensitive to case-insensitive I have a netatalk AFP share on a case-sensitive Linux system, which contains two files whose names differ only in case, test/a.txt and test/A.txt.

I'm coming from android which offers tons of keyboards and options. iOS seems like it has no customization to keyboards. Are there apps that offer a different layout or that edit the existing keyboard? I like being able to see the key I will get when I long press a key, etc.\n\nA: Sorry, but currently, no. Jailbreaking is your only bet (I'd advise against this, though). \nIn terms of what you want, it sounds like you are describing something that iOS already does. When holding down on the keys, it \"magnifies\" the key that you are holding so you can see what you are typing. I should mention though that holding down on certain keys will show you options of the same letter with the accents on top. Ex: Holding down the \"E\" key will give you options such as \"E\", \"È\", \"É\", and \"Ę\".\nHere is an example of the action described above, but with a different option\n\n", "Q: what does installd do in privacy setting? there is a installd icon in the setting->accessibility->privacy. it can be seen in the screenshot \nAny ideas what it is for?\n\nA: I've had this question as well and finally went digging.  This information is stored in the OS X Privacy database.  This db can be accessed with the command-line tool tccutil, but the only (\"supported\") option is reset.  That is of course not very useful here. I found someone at this page who wrote a short python utility to edit this database.  Examining the code, the db is located at /Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db (you will need sudo access for this).  It is a SQLite db.  There are entries in there for /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PackageKit.framework/Resources/installd which is almost certainly the installd referenced in the preference pane.  This is the daemon which occasionally checks for software updates. Since it is Apple code, I am inclined to trust it.\n", "Q: How to turn off click-to-rename feature in Finder There are two ways to rename a file in the Finder which is already selected - press return, or click on it again, then wait a second. I find that the second option leads to a lot of unintentionally renamed files. The problem is, I might click the file when it is already selected to get focus on that window, then hit spacebar to bring it up in quickview. Unbeknownst to me (since it is behind the quickview popup dialog), the Finder has switched to rename mode. When I hit the spacebar again (to close the quickview), nothing happens, because in the background the file is in the process of being renamed to \" \". Any action I  take from here to get rid of the quickview dialog will commit the rename. I probably will not know for some time until I wonder either what happened to that file or why I have a file with named \" .pdf\".\nSo, is there a way to turn off this troublesome \"feature\" and stick with just the return key to rename?\n\nA: I don't know how to turn this off, but one way to deal with this is by tweaking the speed (i.e., duration) for double click and making it slower (i.e., longer duration) than what you currently have so that a single click does not quickly result in a rename action. The faster the double click setting, the more the likelihood of the rename action being triggered quickly.\nYou would have to experiment a bit to find the optimal double click duration while trying to not make it too slow for your use. You can set the double click duration by going to System Preferences > Mouse and adjusting the Double-Click slider.\n\nOn 10.9 the Double-Click options for Mouse and a trackpad have moved to the System Preferences > Accessibility  > Mouse & Trackpad.\n\n", "Q: Impossibly low RAM I remember the times when I got my macbook pro with 4GB of RAM: I could launch Firefox, VirtualBox and Firefox inside a VirtualBox and it worked reasonably well.\nTwo years later, when I start the system and have no programs launched, 3.99 out of 4GB of RAM is used; and launching any tiny program, making ⌘ Cmd+Tab or a new tab in a browser is a huge pain for Mac OS X: I have to wait for dozens of seconds for any little action to complete.\nHowever, if I sum up the \"Memory\" column in Activity Monitor, it would barely come up to 700 MB; Swap is low, File Cache does not exceed 300 MB.\n\nSo I don't really understand what could have happened with my Mac and what can I do to take it back to the times when I could use Firefox and Skype together without any slowing down.\nScreenshot with all processes as suggessted in comments:\n\nA: The \"Memory Used\" number doesn't mean what most people think it does. Modern operating systems pre-fetch a lot of things from the disk to make things seem faster when you actually request them. For example, in your screenshot, 1.47 GB of the 4 GB \"used\" is the file cache, which OS X will delete if an app needs more memory. A better metric to look at is App Memory (1.57 GB) compared to your total memory (4 GB).\nIn the screenshots, it should not be slow because you have barely used any swap. Once the OS starts using swap (more rare with Mavericks), it will start feeling slow. Some people think there are bugs introduced in Lion in OS X's dynamic pager (manages the swapfiles) that cause the system to thrash before it needs to. (I assume) Apple engineers use fast computers with SSDs, which hides this problem.\nThe solution is to buy a crapton of RAM so the OS doesn't have to hit the swap or downgrade to the earliest OS supported by your computer.\n", "Q: Cisco IPSec forgets password (Mavericks) Cisco IPSec seems to have no way to store the password of the connection permanently. I have found on the web some solutions for the Mountain Lion release, but none for OS-X Mavericks.\nIs it impossible, or has someone found an answer and didn't post it?\n\nA: Per this question, it's not so much a problem with the OS as a problem with the configuration of the VPN on the server side.\nOne of the options your IT admins can do is force passwords to not be remembered for the VPN connection, and the OS X client will honor this setting. If you have the keychain open and are looking at the saved password when you connect, you can actually see the saved password disappear when you connect to the server.\nI've searched for a way around this going so far as trying to applescript the login window, but they've blocked that avenue is well.\n", "Q: iPhone iOS7 hangs and requires restart when Switching between apps Occasionally, the iPhone hangs and requires a restart when trying to switch between apps by double-clicking the home button.

It remembers a certain amount of clips. You can also blacklist apps from which it should not clip something, for instance password managers.\nIt does not use any kind of cloud. It is only local.\nTo verify that it does not use any cloud services. You can block the app from accessing the internet.

If it's under warranty, take it into the Apple Store and see if you can get it replaced. Otherwise, you may need to buy a new charger.\nIf you are good with electronics, you can cut open a USB cable, plug it into the charger, and see if the voltages between D+, D-, and Vbus match this pinout.\n", "Q: Do I need Apple TV to stream wirelessly to my TV? I recently bought a new TV. Now I want to mirror my MacBook Air on it.\nI don't need all the other fancy features of Apple TV (I don't have an iPhone/iPad, don't use iTunes etc.).\nRight now I'm using a VGA cable, but I want to do this wireless.\nIf I get Apple TV, can I still play the sound over my MacBook (to use USB-Headphones)? I live together with other people and want to watch movies late at night.\nAre there good alternatives to Apple TV that I could use or is Apple TV the only hardware that would allow for me to wirelessly send a mirrored display of my Mac to a television set?\nUpdate for people who stumble upon this now:\nBy now I'm using Chromecast. For my case it does the very same thing and it's cheaper, more handy, is hidden behind the TV (invisible so to say) etc. It streams YouToube or Google Music/Movies and I can control it with my Android phone/mac. If you have a movie file, you can stream it to it (1080p, no problem) with the 'Videostream for  Google Chromecast' extension for Google Chrome. The mirroring performance (enabled through the Google Chrome browser) is.. ok? A little worse than Apple TV I think, but it's ok for presentations, or showing pictures etc.\n\nA: There are two options which will suit what you want\n\n\n*\n\n*Any AirPlay video receiver will let you stream wirelessly. (You can stream the audio and video, or just the video and use headphones) AppleTV is one such receiver and by virtue of it being on the market the longest, it has the most users with experience as to how it works.\n\n*Buy a longer cable and link up physically.\n\n\nOn a personal note, I'd be in favour of the longer cable option, as it offers slightly more compatibility (a friends laptop, perhaps) and costs way less. That said, Apple TV's are awesome. I'd also recommend using either HDMI or Thunderbolt/displayport.\nIn short, yes, an Apple TV will do what you want.\n\nA: You can definitely do what you want using apple TV. There may be cheaper solutions, I'm not sure.\nIf you use an apple tv to mirror your air's display, you can choose to either send the sound to the tv or to use the internal speakers/headphones by going into System Preferences -> Sound -> Output, and selecting your desired output device in there.\n\nA: I have a MacBook Air and I use Chromecast. It's $35 and right now you get three months of Hulu Plus free. It's a lot cheaper than Apple TV but it only works on your Chrome browser, not your actual screen. \nI am currently looking for a way to cast my VLC player onto my Smart TV. VLC said they were working on an extension for Chromecast but I think that got squished by corporate.\n\nA: \nEdit: Are there good alternatives to Apple TV that I could use?\n\nThere certainly are alternatives to Apple TV.

Good thing I got started—I had no idea how difficult it was going to be to install Windows and create an auxiliary data partition. I've been a Mac user for years, and have kept my files separate from the system disk since the days of System 7, but I haven't upgraded to a new Mac since Snow Leopard and built-in optical drives.\nBoot Camp is Apple's solution for this, but it doesn't work on drives that have any non-standard partitions. Beyond whatever \"user experience\" logic Apple may have for this, there's a simple technical explanation: the MBR partitioning scheme used by Boot Camp supports a maximum of 4 partitions.\nOriginally, the Boot Camp engineers had no choice. They was forced into an ugly hack workaround involving the use of a hybrid GPT/MBR scheme (basically overlaying an MBR scheme on top of a GPT disk) since Windows used to be unable to boot from GPT disks.\nThat wasn't a problem on my old machine, where I had an optical drive and no OS X recovery partition. Partitioning the new one the way I want means 5 partitions. I find tons of guides and tutorials online that tell me how I can, with a bit of work, interrupt the Boot Camp process and repartition the drive, giving me almost what I want. Except every one that I've seen requires me to give up my recovery partition, since they remain hobbled by MBR's limitation of 4 partitions. I don't want to do that.\nI'm wondering if I really have to compromise. Modern 64-bit version of Windows no longer have this limitation—they boot fine from GPT disks on EFI-based computers. Which are the only versions that are officially supported by the current version of Boot Camp, and the only versions that I care to run. So:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is Boot Camp 5 (as provided with OS X Mavericks) still using the hybrid GPT/MBR scheme? Since it explicitly supports only 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and 8, it is possible that they've jettisoned this ugliness. That would be a good explanation for the lack of support for Windows XP and Vista as well as all 32-bit versions. I don't have a lot of confidence here, but maybe all the online tutorials are just old. Has anyone actually tried it?\n\n*If not, I don't want its grubby paws mucking up my disk. The obvious alternative is to just add a Windows partition manually in Disk Utility, install Windows, and then install the Boot Camp-provided drivers. If I do this, what do I stand to lose? What features/benefits does the Boot Camp Assistant and its associated setup process provide to me?\n\nA: I have installed Windows 8.1 Pro via Boot Camp on my MacBook Pro Retina 15-inch mid-2015, with OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 and Boot Camp Assistant version 5.1.4. I can prove that this version of Boot Camp is no longer creating hybrid GPT/MBR partition scheme to install Windows 8 x64 on Intel-based Macs, and Windows is directly booted in EFI mode. Here are what I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running Ubuntu on its installation flash drive, I ran sudo disk -l /dev/sda to check my local Mac SSD; results:\nMBR: protective, BSD: not present, APM: not present, GPT: present Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT Therefore Windows is not booting from and running on a disk with hybrid GPT/MBR scheme.\n\n*In Windows, C:\\Windows\\panther\\setupact.log has one entry: Callback_BootEnvironmentDetect: Detected boot environment: EFI How to tell if windows 7 installer boot in EFI or BIOS?\nTherefore theoretically Boot Camp is not needed to install Windows 7/8 x64, which support booting from GPT disks on UEFI(that is EFI 2.x)-based systems. But still it's better to use Boot Camp to create the Windows Installation flash drive and download drivers for Windows. The guide: How to install Windows 8.1 on Mac without Boot Camp To sum it up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition your disk as you wish in Disk Utility in OS X; just format your desired Windows OS and data partitions as FAT32.\n\n*Since Retina MacBook Pros do not come with a SuperDrive, you need to create a Windows Installation flash drive from the ISO file. Please do this in Boot Camp Assistant. I have tried run dd command on Mac's Terminal to copy the ISO, but the created flash drive is not bootable on UEFI Macs: the Apple boot manager simply does not recognize the flash disk.\n\n*Plug in the flash drive, restart the computer and hold option to open Apple boot manager. You will see a yellow drive called \"EFI Boot\", which is the Windows Installation. Continue the installation as normal, and format your Windows OS partition as NTFS when asked.\n\n*Whenever the computer restarts, you need to hold option key and select \"Windows\" drive on your local SSD to continue installation. Finally go into the system and drivers from Boot Camp will automatically install.\n\n\nYou should keep a Time Machine backup before these operations. Even if things really mess up, you can just create a OS X Yosemite installation flash drive, re-format the SSD to one partition and re-install OS X. How to make a bootable OS X 10.10 Yosemite install driveThe newest version of Recovery HD partition will automatically come back. This worked successfully when I wrongly operated the disk in Ubuntu.\nHope this works!\n\nA: *\n\n*I've tried Boot Camp only with x64, so I can't tell it.\n\n*Usually I install Windows using this procedure.\nBenefits: you can install also x86 OS.\nCons: nothing. You only have to manually install Boot Camp provided drivers for a best support, but you can skip this step, because OS like Windows 7/8.x they are able to automatically download the correct drivers with Windows Update.\n\n\nTested on MBP 13 Mid 2010 with OS X 10.9.1\n\nA: Try creating a hybrid MBR with gdisk.\n\nGPT is a very flexible partitioning scheme with many advantages over the older MBR system. GPT does have one glaring problem, though: compatibility. Some OSes, particularly older ones, have limited or no GPT support. When using such an OS, an ugly, flaky, and downright dangerous workaround can sometimes be useful: hybrid MBRs. Using a hybrid MBR, you can satisfy your legacy OS's need for up to three partitions defined via an MBR, while keeping additional partitions for more sophisticated OSes in GPT data structures.\n\n\nA: I can't help you with the first part of your question but the second matches how I do my windows (or Linux) installations. The only features from the Bootcamp assistant you really lose is the windows support software from Apple, but you can go through the Bootcamp setup assistant to download that software and then cancel out of the setup. Once you've got that software, you can install windows in a different fashion and still be able to use all of the drivers from Apple.\n", "Q: How to delete photos from iPhone 5 without removing already transferred photos from iMac?

If you were, no matter what happens to your photos on your iPhone, the transferred photos will always be on your Mac.\nBecause the Mac would most definetly have more storage space than an iOS device, Photo Stream photos are automatically downloaded and permanently saved to your Mac's iPhoto or Aperture library; the 1000 photo/30 day limit doesn't apply for OS X or Windows unless you clear the photos and start fresh.\nIf you moved or copied your photos from your Photo Stream to somewhere else on your Mac, they are still safe.\n", "Q: Google Calendar not syncing with iOS 7 (tried deleting account, creating Google or CalDAV, nothing worked) I restored my iPod-touch 4 data to my new iPod-touch 5, and the calendar was looking good, until I realize it was not syncing.\nI tried deleting my Google Account and creating again, twice, with no success (now the calendars and events are not even showing in the app).\nAlso, I tried both Google account and CalDAV account, but none of them are even downloading my calendars.\nI use two-step authentication, and I'm using app generated passwords each time I try to add a new account to sync.\nThe GMail sync is working properly, only the Calendar have some problem.\nIs there anything more I can try? Or should I restore and keep my iOS 6?\n(By the way, the Reminders are not syncing with iCloud, and Safari is crashing as soon as it opens, even after a few restarts of the iOS. But the calendar is the big problem right now)\n\nA: Go to https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect and make sure that you have all of the calendars enabled.\nSee https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/151674 for more information --- However!  Be sure to ignore the part about Google Apps unless you have a paid Google Apps account. Specifically do not use https://m.google.com/sync/settings/ unless you are using a paid Google Apps account.)\nhttp://productforums.google.com/d/msg/calendar/G4ClHD46kP4/LekDrZoyCo0J is also helpful to understand the changes that happened when Google switched from Exchange ActiveSync to CalDAV. The author of that posts suggests https://www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect and/or\nhttps://www.google.com/calendar/hosted/YOUR.DOMAIN.HERE/iphoneselect\n(the latter being for Google Apps hosted accounts). In my experience they all seem to lead to the same place, but YMMV.\nIf you have more than one Google Apps/Gmail account, but sure to log into the right one before you try any of this.\nLast but not least, you may need to 'force quit' the calendar app on the iOS device (in iOS7, double-press the 'Home' button, then 'flick' the app off the top of the screen). My suggestion would be to start by deleting the Google account from your iOS device, then go and enable the CalDAV settings, and then re-enable the Google Account. That should give everything enough time to re-sync and notice the changes.\n\nA: Looks like the problem was due to the iPod 5 having been restored from the iPod 4. That installed iOS 6, and later I updated to iOS 7, with a lot of bugs.\nNow I restored it to factory settings (iOS 7), and synchronized with iTunes without restoring from iPod 4, and everything is OK.\n\nA: I had the problem of Google calendar not synchronizing on a brand new iPhone 5s. The Gmail account was setup successfully (all contacts and email were downloaded to the device), but the calendar was not showing or syncing.\nI resolved the problem as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*in Settings → Mail, Contacts and Calendars, select Gmail account and uncheck the Calendars option, then agree to deleting from the iPhone\n\n*Add a new account: pick Other, then new CalDAV account\n\n\n*\n\n*Server is www.google.com\n\n*User is your Google account (including the @gmail.com bit)\n\n*Password\n\n*Description is whatever you like\n\n\n\nAfter that, my Google calendar showed up as expected in the calendar app, and appointments would synchronize successfully.\n", "Q: Can I configure my Macbook to unmount all external drives when I close the lid? I have a new 13\" Macbook Pro running Mavericks. This computer is connected to an external USB drive which I use for my Time Machine backups and for external storage Time Machine backups occur a few times per day and the drive is largely inactive for most of the day.\nWhen I am rushing to a meeting, to the server room or I'm heading home at the end of the day, I would like to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close the lid on my Macbook, quickly.\n\n*Have the Mac automatically unmount all external drives, as quickly as possible, and forcibly if required. I'm willing to wait a few seconds for the all of lights to turn off.\n\n\nIs there a way to get the computer to automatically unmount all external drives as soon as I close the lid on my Mac? \nCurrently if I forget to unmount the external drives, my Mac chastises me later with the error \"The disk was not ejected properly. If possible, always eject a disk before unplugging it or turning it off.\"\nI know it is best practice to always unmount a disk cleanly before removing the disk interface, but I'm looking for an automated solution. I am not very concerned if one Time Machine backup image is interrupted or corrupted, as one of the next subsequent backups will work and I very rarely ever need to restore from backup. Since the filesystem is a journaling filesystem, the journal transparently takes care of many other filesystem corruption errors.\n\nA: There are a number of apps that can run scripts on sleep:\n\n\n*\n\n*SleepWatcher — simple yet effective.\n\n*Scenario — can also run scripts at other times such as after wake.\n\n*ControlPlane — more customisable, lets you run scripts after many different events.\n\n\nA bash script such as the following will unmount all specified disks:\nVOLUMES=\"/Volumes/drive1 /Volumes/drive2 /Volumes/drive3\"\nfor volume in $VOLUMES ; do [ -d $volume ] && umount -f $volume done\n\nTo unmount all volumes except /:\numount -A\n\nor more cleanly…\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to eject (every disk whose ejectable is true)'\n\n\nA: Another option is Jettison (available through the App Store) - that's what I've been using for a couple of months now and haven't had any problems at all.  It recently gained the option of automatically remounting still-connected disks when you wake from sleep.\nThe newer v1.3.0 (direct download only - I assume it's on its way to the App Store) costs more and they explain why this is in their FAQ.\nIf I read that correctly, one could buy the App Store version for two dollars and then upgrade to the direct-download version for free, but I haven't confirmed or tried this.\nNot exactly expensive at either price, but not free like the SleepWatcher option seems to be.\n\nA: I'll elaborate on @grgarside's answer.\nI'm using SleepWatcher \n\n\n*\n\n*Install from ports:\nsudo port install sleepwatcher\n\n\n*Read the manual at /opt/local/share/doc/sleepwatcher/ReadMe.rtf and via man sleepwatcher.

I now have a list of over twenty serious flaws with iOS7. It is driving me nuts that this new iOS is so riddles with flaws it should never have been released in this state, and Steve Jobs wouldn't have permitted it so. And this site just helped me resolve the mystery of why all my contacts vanished this morning. (thank you!) when the iOS decided to suddenly and for no apparent reason turn off contact syncing sometime overnight.

It will allow you to resize partitions without deleting any data. It also works for Boot Camp volumes and other PC disks. It will automatically move partitions if necessary to allow resizing into free space that is located before the partition.\n\nWith iPartition, resizing a partition is as simple as selecting it, grabbing the resize handle and dragging. Not only that, but if you have several operations to perform, iPartition lets you queue them up and run them one after another, so you can have a cup of coffee while iPartition works. This feature, coupled with iPartition’s ability to automatically rearrange your existing partitions when necessary, makes iPartition the easiest partitioning tool that you’ll ever use.\n\n\n", "Q: How do I change mouse settings instantaneously from Terminal? My school has a bunch of Macs that are always logged in as Guest and have very annoying default settings (natural scrolling, no secondary mouse button, etc), so I am trying to write a terminal script that will change all the settings to my liking.

Presumably, any refurbished iPhone 5's at this point (December 2013) are all going to have iOS 7.  Since my phone has never had iOS 7 and all my backups are 6.1.2, is there going to be any way for me to restore my backup onto my new (replacement) phone EXACTLY as it was?

The framerate is too low and the sound is out of synch.\nIf I use the App Beamer, the image quality is great. Running Netflix natively on Apple TV works also great. My guess is, that Beamer streams the video file directly to Apple TV and that mirroring is slower, because the MacBook has to encode the image on the fly. Hence the low frame rate and delay (the video is also much smoother if I change the resolution down to 720p, but still not watchable for a movie). \nRight now the situation is ok, because I can watch Netflix natively and stream files via Beamer. But this is not what I expected from Apple TV.\nI didn't expect to play the newest action games like this, but stream videos to it in decent quality (YouTube, IMDb etc.) without using some native App on Apple TV.\nCan I somehow improve this? Am I right that the bottleneck is the encoding of the MacBook? Can I improve this by disabling the MacBooks monitor or something?\nEDIT:\nAn employee at an Apple certified store told me this is definitely my router. My housemate bought a TimeCapsule. This did not help a bit. I already guessed that the employee just didn't want to admit he sold me something I didn't want. I'll probably sell AppleTV now, but I'd still be interested in answers though.\n\nA: I'm having quite the same issue not with an apple tv but with another stuff provided by my Internet broadband which is doing air mirroring. \nI have a mid 2013 macbook air and mirroring my screen is lagy. \nSo I thought the issue was from the router too, but my brother with his latest MacBook Pro doesn't have any lag, it's really fluid. \nSo I thought the MBA wasn't power enough too handle the real time encoding, but one day while I was mirroring my screen I launched a slide show in iphoto and it was really fluid. Then I noticed when I turn air mirroring on it's always lagy until I launch a video from QuickTime.\nSo, to sum up - this likely is a software issue since under iPhoto and Quicktime, the MBA is fast enough to handle high performance mirroring of some content. (Or that it lags when it has to both assemble the image to draw on the screen and then mirror it - but when QuickTime or iPhoto take over the entire screen - mirroring can be quite snappy).\n\nA: How about streaming using the native capability of both products and stream Netflix and YouTube directly on the AppleTV.

HALP!\n\nA: I think you are mixing up two commands.\nTry to set Firefox to Socks5 at port 12345 and run:\nssh user@host -D 12345\n\n\nFrom the SSH manual, 'man ssh':\n-D [bind_address:]port\nSpecifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding. ... Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act as a SOCKS server.\n\nYour command user@host -L 12345:localhost:8080 -N forwards your local port 12345 to the remote host's port 8080. This would only work if there would actually be a proxy running on port 8080 on your remote host.\n", "Q: Is the iBooks app sandboxed on Mavericks?

The fix you described had a side-effect that ended up, for a time, solving the problem.\nI believe that the problem had to do with the security context in which your terminal's shell was attempting to launch programs that try to connect to the window system.\nMy solution to this problem, whenever it has occurred from my Terminal.app shells, has been to use reattach-to-user-namespace (https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard). For example, at a bash prompt:\ntk-mbp:~ tommy$ wstorm Projects/my-webapp\nTrace/BPT trap: 5\ntk-mbp:~ tommy$ exec reattach-to-user-namespace -l bash\n(reading ~/.bash_profile)\ntk-mbp:~ tommy$ wstorm Projects/my-webapp\ntk-mbp:~ tommy$ # that worked...\n\nWhen you rebooted as part of the fix you reported, it had the side-effect of creating a shell process whose connection to the security context of your windowed login session was not stale, as it had been before when the commands were failing with \"Trace/BPT trap: 5\". So although there might have been a real problem with the PATH setup, I believe it was the refreshing of the shell's process environment that was the true fix.\nFWIW, I've got reattach-to-user-namespace installed via Homebrew.\n\nA: It seems that the PATH variable was causing the problem.\nUsing iTerm, the PATH variable included unpredictable Unicode characters. I tracked it down to an entry which I added to the /etc/paths.d directory (the path $HOME/bin). It contained after the path a linefeed. By editing the fikle with nano, I did not manage to delete this Unicode(?) character, i.e. restarting did not solve the problem, but I used then Emacs and deleted all characters after the path (two characters shown as spaces which were not visible using nano) and added a RETURN.\nRebooted and it was working - and it still is.\nHope it stays like this.\nThanks for your input.\n\nA: I had the same problem. \nI had a hidden file in /etc/paths.d/ that was confusing my PATH variable. I deleted the file and everything works as normal now.\nFYI the file was an undo file generate by vim: .<original filename>.un~\n\nA: Based on @Rainer suggestion, I found that some env variable contains a -, and some security feature killed my command (reasonable thing to do). Once I change - to a , my command proceeds without being killed.\nNo restart needed.\n", "Q: Permissions issue when copying files over SMB to server on OS X 10.9 Mavericks First of all I'd like to say that I've spent most of the day trying to figure this problem out. I've already read quite some articles on this issue but can't seem to find the specific issue I'm experiencing.\nI'm running OS X 10.9 Mavericks on a Mac Mini.\nOur server is running Linux Gentoo. At this point I'm not exact sure which version.\nThe problem\nWhen I connect to a server on our company network with the SMB or CIFS protocol I can mount the volumes from that server. I can also access and read the files on all the volumes (so far as I know). I connect through the admin username and password for this server.\nHowever, when I try to copy files to one particularly volume I get prompted by Finder to enter my username and password. After I've entered my OSX user credentials I get an error stating the following:\n\nThe operation can’t be completed because you don’t have permission to access some of the items.\n\nI therefor cannot copy files to this specific volume on our server. I can however copy files to other volumes on our server.\nAttempted Solutions\nSolutions I've already attempted are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connecting through CIFS rather then SMB\n\n*Changing the permissions on said files to read/write by everyone\n\n*Attempting to install Samba to be used instead of OS X's SMB implementation\n\n\nNone of these attempts have managed to solve the problem I'm experiencing.\nSome more alternative attempts\nWhat I also tried to do was to give my files to a colleague which runs OS X Mountain Lion so he could attempt to copy the files to said volume. He got the same problem and was also prompted by Finder to provide his credentials on which afterwards failed to copy because of the above permissions error.\nHe can however copy his own files to said volume without any problem.\nWhen I provided my files to a colleague which is using Windows 8 he succeeded in copying my files to said volume.\nTL;DR\nCan't copy files over SMB to specific server volume from OSX Mavericks. Can read however.\nAny help is very much appreciated.\nUpdate #1\nSome people have suggested that I needed to enter the server credentials in the Finder prompt but it doesn't allow that. I can only enter my OSX account credentials.\nI also want to indicate that I connect to the server with the same user account and login as most of my colleagues. So I connect with the same account as colleagues which can copy files to the server. I, however, keep getting the no permissions error when I try to copy files to the server.\n\nA: Usually the authentication prompt is in relation to the destination for your copy. \nThus, from what you're describing, you should enter your Gentoo login credentials. However, I suspect the owner/write permission are too restrictive on that specific volume. Have you checked owner user/group on the problematic volume vs. the other \"problem-free\" volumes? Are the read/write permissions the same?\nTo change the permissions without resorting to Terminal, highlight the folder you want to put the user file in and select Get Info (Cmd+i). At the bottom are the permissions. Make sure that where it says \"everyone\" that it also says \"Read & Write.\" You may have to click the little gold lock at the bottom of the Get Info pane to adjust this. Once you do this, you will be able to copy your folder over.\n\nA: I had the same problem and I think I solved it:\nYou have to change the server address from smb to cifs, for example if your address is:\nsmb://ummsnas01/MarkLab$\n\n…change it to:\ncifs://ummsnas01/MarkLab$\n\nThat's it! Hopefully it works now for you too!\n\nA: The solution in our case was to make the user account \"mobile\" on the local mac (we were having problems with a domain user not being allowed access to an smb share on a domain member server).\nIt was a problem on any Mavericks version where the domain user was not mobile.\n\nA: For those who have come to this page in search of an answer to this problem, I've found the solution to my experience with this issue:\nThe HD that is connected to the network must be formatted in exFat. You can do this by physically connecting the drive to your computer and using Disk Utility to reformat in exFat. That solved my problem. I hope it solves yours! Cheers!\n\nA: Well at first glance I would say that your Linux Server should be in the future set up as a Active Directory with unique users and permissions set appropriately.\nWhen you copy a file over and then you enter your OS X account information that is probably the stumbling block for the transfer. Entering the admin credentials for the Linux admin should allow you the correct privilege to write to the share on the SMB/CIFS share you are working on.\nWhat is confusing that you say that your colleagues transfer files with their credentials.... so I am unclear if those are local system credentials or server credentials.\n\nA: This would have been a comment too but I haven't yet enough reputation.\nYou're trying to use a Windows file sharing protocol for communication between Mac OS and Linux computers.  Why not use file sharing protocols that are more native to the platforms you're using, i.e.:\n\n\n*\n\n*install and use AFP (Mac OS's file sharing protocol) on Linux, or\n\n*use NFS (Unix's file sharing protocol, spoken well by both Linux and Mac OS)\n\n\nA: The solution is simple. You must go to the SMB sharing settings and give proper permissions to the user with whose credentials you are logged from you mac. The default sharing permissions in windows is for everyone, but you must have the specific username permitted there.\n\nA: I solved this with:\nsudo chmod +orw\n\nNote, I am not a MacOS expert, so I may be making this too unsecure, but these are temp files for me and this worked.\n\nA: I met the similar issue and the root cause was the SELINUX enable. You can disable the SELINUX and try.\n", "Q: How to trigger lid close action programmatically? Is there a way to trigger the lid close action programmatically with a script or through terminal? \nI am testing this by placing a small magnet near the SD slot on my MacBook Pro. \n\nA: There is no Apple supported programming interface to simulate the lid being closed.\nYou can put your Mac to sleep using this command line:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to sleep'\n\n\nA: You may put your machine to sleep with a shell script:\npmset sleepnow\n\nP.S. If you intend to run this from a script, be prepared that machine won't sleep until script finishes, and if that's something like a daemon running in a loop, it won't ever work unless you run pmset in a subshell:\n(pmset sleepnow &)\n\n", "Q: Sharing an Apple ID on different iPads, but having different Contacts My daughter has my old iPad, and we share the same Apple ID, for convenience with purchasing. However at present we also have a shared Contacts list on the two iPads. It would be better to have separate Contact lists, to go with our separate email accounts.  Is this possible? And if so, how?\n\nA: Perfectly possible, you essentially both need a free iCloud account, that you log into for the purposes or mail/calendars/notes/contacts etc etc.\nYou each log into iCloud from within Settings > iCloud with your unique ID, and turn on any appropriate option within that page once you are signed in.\nThen, for the App Store, go to Settings > iTunes and App Store and log in again, only this time simply both use the the same ID that is associated with all your past purchases.\nYou can log into different ID's for different services like Facetime/Messages/App Store/Mail at the same time, it really doesn't mind.\n\nA: Both answers are correct. However, I would like to add some notes.\nFirst of all you could also use Gmail contacts for example instead of iCloud contacts. Depending on what email you and your daughter use (iCloud/Gmail/something else) this can be even more convenient. For example, I use gmail and have all my contact stored in Gmail. This way, I have direct access to my contacts in the (rare) case that I use gmail from within my web browser. You can simply enable gmail contacts sync in Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then enable it at the relevant account. \nSecondly, you should not forget to set the default address book accordingly. New contacts are automatically saved to that address book (in case you have multiple address books). This can be set at Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars -> (scroll down to header \"contacts\") Default Account (here you should also set default calendar and e-mail accounts btw). \nIn all cases, there will be one issue: you need to move (a part of) the contacts to another account. To my knowledge, you cannot easily move/copy contacts to another account in iOS (\"Groups\" in the upper left corner in the Contacts app in iOS). In Contacts on OSX you can drag and drop them. Also, some googling will probably give you enough sites explaining how to move contacts from icloud to icloud or icloud to gmail. It might be a good idea to make a backup (e.g. with the contacts app in osx) of your contacts as moving contacts could give some issues in some cases. \nAll in all it is a small investment to make in my opinion: I have moved all my contacts to gmail over 5 years ago and have used it without issues ever since. And I could easily switch to android, windows, windows phone, etc. as they all support syncing with gmail contacts.\n\nA: Only enter the Apple ID for purchasing into the Store section of the settings app. \nYou then each use separate AppleID for iCloud and / or Mail, Contacts, Calendars. One could use the same AppleID as for store, but at least one should be different and both could be different AppleID. \nWe have details here, here and here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to use different contacts on different iPhones with the same Apple ID\n\n*Is it a bad idea to have a shared Apple ID for purchases that also is used for iCloud?\n\n*How does a family with multiple idevices and multiple laptops share music and digital movie copies?\n\n*Do I need to set up individual Apple IDs for all my kids' iPads?\n\nA: The other answers here lay out good options for separating contacts and iCloud sync from purchasing, either by using two Apple IDs, or by using Google sync for your contacts... however... I strongly recommend that you and your daughter use two separate accounts for everything. I understand the desire to save money, but it can lead to pretty messy complications down the road, especially if that Apple ID is tied to the email address of an ISP (@comcast.net e.g.), and it ever has to change.\nBut yes, it is possible.\n", "Q: Time Machine is Frozen I am running Mac 10.8.5 on a 2008 MacBook Pro, I have my time machine save to an external hard drive. Recently I have been unable to back up my machine because it gets hung up on 'Preparing Back Up' I have seen it chug away for 5 hours preparing that thing, I'm begging to think that it might be broken.

After I have installed some programs I can't find them to open them. I have looked in…\n\n\n*\n\n*the Applications folder\n\n*the Utilities folder\n\n*About this Mac → More info → System report → Software → Installations as another user explained, and I can I see the program but I cannot open it from this window.\n\n\nThe program I am specifically looking for is called Google Voice and Video, if that matters?\nWhat am I doing wrong? How can I open a program after I have installed it?\n\nA: You've already looked in the standard spots for application installs (Applications folder, Utilities folder,etc...).\nHowever, if you've installed Google Voice and Video (aka Hangouts), you won't find an application to run (on OS X or Windows). This is a plugin for your web browser - not a standalone application. \nRead here for details - but in short, you should run the installer (you've likely already done this), then quit and restart your web browser (Safari, Firefox, or Chrome - whichever you use). The features of Google Voice and Video will then be functional, and you can then use video chat with other Google Video users.\n\nA: From this article on uninstalling Hangouts, we can deduce the install location is\n/Library/Application Support/Google/GoogleVoiceAndVideoUninstaller.app\n\nYou can uninstall it (which is why I found this article) by running\n/Library/Application Support/Google/GoogleVoiceAndVideoUninstaller.app/Contents/MacOS/GoogleVoiceAndVideoUninstaller\n\n\nA: If the program is on your hard disk you can search for it with the loupe/glasses symbol in the top right of the screen. Click on it and type the name of the program. It will start to populate a list below with suggestions. If you spelled the program correct it will appear in the category Programm. Just hit enter and you should be fine.\n\nNote that this is only one of many possibilities to start a program. But in mine opinion the best if you do not know where the program is on your hard drive.\n\nA: In chrome, the location of all chrome extensions (and Hangouts is extension) is like in the image:\n\nOr here:\n\nSo it opens new tab and you should be able to find it and make sure it is enabled, like in this image:\n\nIt should automatically start, but if it does not, restart Chrome, or delete and reinstall the extension from google site.\n\nA: Google Voice and Video is implemented as a plugin.  On Mac OS X, plugins go here:\n/Library/Internet Plug-Ins\n\nIf you look in that directory, you will see that there are two files added:\ngoogletalkbrowserplugin.plugin\no1dbrowserplugin.plugin\n\nAlso in the following directory there are two applications:\n/Library/Application Support/Google\n\nApplications:\nGoogleTalkPlugin.app\nGoogleVoiceAndVideoUninstaller.app\n\nRunning the uninstaller will remove the files.\n", "Q: What happens when I share an iTunes Radio station I've created? I just shared one of my custom iTunes Radio stations to a friend via email. What happens when they access it in iTunes?

The stations you share continue to change as you tweak the mix, so your friends can listen to music that adjusts with your evolving tastes. Show off your favorite stations, or tune in to your friends’ to hear what they’re into.\n\nSo, it appears to mean that they're getting a read-only instance of your station, that updates as you update it.\n", "Q: How can I ignore conversations in Outlook 2011 for Mac?

I really need to be able to access contact groups in the Contacts app on my iOS 7 device. How can I do this? In the side bar, all that is available is \"All GMail\", nothing else. However, under iCloud, there are several groups. Suggestions?\n\nA: As far as I know the (becoming deprecated) exchange-based sync that gmail used never did it.  And the newer carddav sync doesn't support it \"yet\". I believe the spec they wrote for the protocol does provide the means for contact groups, but google simply has not implemented everything yet. \nGoogle  does provide such features in their APIs which is a long way of saying you can find a few third-party solutions at the AppStore for the time-being that will sync your gmail groups bi-directionally.  Not sure if there are any free ones and haven't tried any to recommend, unfortunately. \n\nA: Here was my final solution. I used Contacts Sync for Google Gmail. Great little app, and you can try it free. The only issue I have with it is that it doesn't automatically sync. I have to manually sync it. If someone comes up with an automatic way of syncing, I will gladly accept that answer over mine.\n\n\n\nA: I use www.memotoo.com I love it as I can sync my contacts from linkedin, xing, fb etc. with my google account and my devices and groups are taken into my contacts on the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\nIf I open the address book, synching is done automatically.\nIt is not free but really worth the 1€ a month :-)\n", "Q: What do grayed-out app icons mean in iOS 7? Every couple days on my iPhone 4 running iOS 7, I notice an app icon is slightly grayed-out. Here is an example with the clock app:\n\nWhen I open the app the icon goes back to normal immediately:\n\nWhat does this mean? I can't find any documentation explaining it, and I can't determine a pattern for which apps exhibit it.\n\nA: It's a glitch, where the grey overlay that appears on top of an app when you tap it is retained when you exit the app.\nYou can remove it by interacting with the app icon in some way, whether that be swiping between pages starting with your finger on the app, or simply tapping the icon.\nIt appears to be fixed in the dev build of iOS 7.1 :)\n", "Q: Desktop notifications for phone calls on iOS 7 Is it possible to send notifications to my Mountain Lion desktop when my iPhone receives a phone call?\n\nA: Without a jailbreak what you ask is definitely not possible right now. \nWith a jailbreak there seems to be some apps that can send notifications like GrowlNotifier.\n\nA: Connect can show notifications on your Mac when you get a phone call. It connects to your device over Bluetooth and will 'ring' on your Mac. You can also make/receive calls on your Mac. No jailbreak required — works over public APIs for Bluetooth.\n\n\nA: With OS X Yosemite and iOS 8, you can use Continuity to be notified of incoming calls and answer them on the Mac.\n\n\nA: I use Phone Amego to do that very thing on both OS X 10.7.5 and OS X 10.9.4. No jailbreak required. Works like a charm over bluetooth, and also allows logging/sending SMS. \n", "Q: Screen Capture tool that allows me to use keyboard? There are many screen capture tools, but every tool I've tried expects from its user to click and then drag the area to capture.\nIs there a tool that allows me to use the keyboard for both operations, such that I can do precise captures in a relaxed manner - without holding anything? I do not want to capture just windows, but any rectangular region.\nExample of usage:\n\n\n*\n\n*press hotkey to enter capture mode\n\n*move cursor (cross, loupe, whatever) around using mouse/pad and keyboard.\n\n*when I find a good starting place (top-left corner), click or press some key to enter marking state\n\n*now, move cursor to other corner (bottom-right) of the area I want to capture, but without holding anything! Just move cursor with the mouse or using the keyboard, as before.\n\n*when I find a good spot, click again or press some key to finalize capturing.\n\n\nThere is one such tool on Windows that worked this way: FastStone Capture\nFor me this is an essential feature. I simply want to have precision, without holding any buttons or keys.\n\nA: The only one I know of is Snapz Pro, but there are a lot of screenshot utilities available for the Mac.\n\nA: You can press command-shift-4 and use space bar to select one of your open windows to capture.\nThere is a good tutorial on this page.\n\nA: Ive just found that new Snagit ($50) does what I need - you still need to drag a rectangle, but then you are allowed to modified it and being able to release a mouse ;)\n", "Q: How to get Mail files from Mountain Lion Time Machine backup in Mavericks? I have upgraded my MBP to Mavericks and got the system to how I like etc. Tt has since backed up using Time Machine onto an external HD. Now it slipped my mind that I would like to have my e-mails on my new system from Mountain Lion.\nI thought that a simple Enter Time Machine and then restoring the selected files that I need to make this happen would work, but upon entering time machine I cannot get into my ML backups on Mavericks.\nIs there any way that I can get to my Mail files?\n\nA: Sorted it after a long trawl through the internet. For any one else with a similar problem...\nThanks to this post by Alberto Ravasio here\n\nLast but not least, navigate the TM disk within the Finder, (do not enter TM).\n  When you are on the date you are looking for, navigate the directory structure until you reach the Users folder.\nOpen Terminal and type\ncd\n\nand a space, drag and drop your user name folder inside the Terminal window. That completes the cd command for you. Hit return.\nYou are now into your user folder inside the TM disk. Type\ncd Library\nopen .\n\nplease note the dot after open. Last command opens a Finder window of the Library folder inside TM disk.\nNow you are ready to get what you need.\n\n", "Q: Unable to redeem app codes with Configurator Configurator 1.4.2 (370). OS X 10.9 \nI have 20 iPads that I'm managing with Configurator.  I have purchased 20 licenses each for two apps through the Volume Purchase Program.  I have Prepared tablets with no trouble.  On the Supervise panel I assign the paid app to the devices and apply.  19/20 ipads complete successfully.  \nOne iPad completes with an error for both apps: Unable to redeem code for \"App Name\". There are no codes left to redeem.\nLooking at the licenses for each app it clearly says there is one remaining code available.\n\nA: Do not import the initial VPP spreadsheet into Configurator!\nAfter receiving the initial spreadsheet from VPP, you must redeem one of the codes from the spreadsheet in the iTunes App Store to 'purchase' the app you are distributing. Once you download the app and import it into Configurator, go back to the VPP site and re-download the spreadsheet. This spreadsheet will now have the word Redeemed in the cell where the download link used to be. Import only the second spreadsheet into Configurator.\nLastly, VPP Support is sometimes very forgiving with minor glitches like this and can get you back a license code, especially if the price of the app was substantial.\n", "Q: Flash drive not recognised - Unknown device: \"Voyager Mini 3.0\" I have a Retina Macbook Pro and have just received 6 x Voyager Mini USB 3.0 64GB drives (as gifts for colleagues).

Based on reading other questions and answers on your site it seems that this is possible.  When I plug in the Thunderbolt to the Dell XPS via the Dells thunderbolt sized female input i get no response and am not able to \"find\" the Thunderbolt in the Display controls area.  \n\nA: I don't believe your \"Thunderbolt\" port on your Dell XPS is a Thunderbolt port, it's more likely to be a DisplayPort connector. I'm not aware of Dell making any equipment that has a Thunderbolt port. Thunderbolt and DisplayPort do use an identical form factor, so it's easy to get them confused.\nYou cannot use a Thunderbolt display in a DisplayPort connector.\n\nSince this answer was originally written, Dell has indeed added Thunderbolt 2 or 3 ports to their XPS line of laptops. Double check it is a thunderbolt port in the specs of your exact model and year, but a Dell XPS works well with my Thunderbolt display since the addition of a Thunderbolt port.\n\nA: As far as I know you can only connect Apple Thunderbolt devices to the display for it to work. I haven't tried my display with anything else but I doubt it would work. When I run Windows 8.1 through Boot Camp on my rMBP it doesn't recognise the display at all so it seems it only works with Apple computers running OS X.\n", "Q: How can I take a screenshot from all monitors with screencapture or other tools?

I'm developing a plugin for Hubot (a scriptable chatbot) to take a URL, and display it on a Mac Mini connected to a TV in my office.\nHowever I'm not actually sure how feasible this is. Hubot is able to send messages to APIs using HTTP. Is there a known method of allowing a Mac to listen for requests over HTTP, and then run a command (an applescript or shell script perhaps)?\n\nA: Python is shipped with Macs, you can just use SimpleHTTPServer to respond to HTTP requests.\n\nA: Depends on what you want to do (and what Hubot can do, which I'm not familiar with) – but it seems it is possible through a combination of iChat/Messages and AppleScript to control a Mac through sending commands to a chat account which are then handled by a special script.\nThe original script that's provided by Apple can be found here (it should be preinstalled on any recent Mac), and a how-to for setting it up is here. I guess that would be a rather … convoluted solution ;)\nOf course, you can also enable \"Remote Login\" in the Sharing Panel in the System Preferences and then connect to the Mac through SSH – which gives you control over the Mac via the CLI. \n\nA: If you activate PHP on your mini and restart Apache, then you can send commands to the web server through http GET and POST commands. Although POST is more secure and the recommended method. I use this method to send commands from an Arduino to a mac and have it store data in a database. If you want to experiment without changing the Apache setup on your Mac then try MAMP, it is free and open source.\nPHP is the backend of the internet and can do just about anything you need, (or you can run javascript) to update a web page that will display whatever you want on your TV.\n", "Q: How can I change the default font size for composing in Sparrow? I use Sparrow as my email client.\nRecently, I sent an email with some wacky font sizes.  Now every time I compose a message, the default size is too small.

And it doesn't seem to be in Sparrow's online support.\nI expect to be embarrassed by the answer, but can anyone point me to the right place?\n\nA: I figured this out:  \nI had a problem that my font got changed size 11, and changing back to 13 didn't fix the default - the next email would go back to 11\nThe solution is this: Type some text and highlight it.  But instead of changing the font in the pulldown above the editing window (which won't change the default), so this instead:\nWith the text selected, in the top menu select Format > Font > Bigger or Smaller, till it get the size you want.

We have no apple desktop and no root access to these machines. these is an preconfigured pkg package, but if the user launch it in normal way, the pre configuration will be overwritten.\nOn windows I realize this with an selfexecutable archive which launches an msi with silent installation. On linux I build rpm/deb packages but on osx I didn't find any proper way :(\n\nA: I think you might be dancing very close to your own answer. You mention that you don't have Apple's Remote Desktop. I would recommend considering it for what you are trying to do. I use it as you are describing all of the time - I have a .pkg file that needs to be installed on multiple computers in my LAN, I highlight the computers I want it installed on, and tell Remote Desktop to install it. It does much more than this, but it WILL do these remote installs for you. It is $80 for a license with unlimited clients. \nIf the $80 is a sticking point - you could look at munki, which is \n\n\"a set of tools that, used together with a webserver-based repository\n  of packages and package metadata, can be used by OS X administrators\n  to manage software installs (and in many cases removals) on OS X\n  client machines.\"\n\nI have not used it myself, but have a lot of respect for the people coding it and using it in real life. It is a bit more set up and work than Remote Desktop - but has a lot more options as well. \nHopefully you can use one of these two programs to do what you are after.\n\nA: Finally, thanks to dr.nixon solution of my concrete question, I've got to handle the creation of an unattended installation as described in the question via Platypus.\nUser has to start the app, the rest will done automatically.\n\nA: Short Answer: yes.\nLong Answer: Yes, but…a full answer to this question includes a technical answer and a practical concern.\nFirst, the technical answer\nYou can install a .pkg or .mpkg using this syntax:\nsudo installer -verboseR -pkg \"/path/to/pkg/foo.mpkg\"\n\nIf the installer isn't 'signed' properly, you'll need to add -allowUntrusted\nsudo installer -allowUntrusted -verboseR -pkg \"/path/to/pkg/foo.mpkg\"\n\nYou may also need to specify where you want it installed, using -target / (I'm not 100% certain this is required, but it's a good idea):\nsudo installer -allowUntrusted -verboseR -pkg \"/path/to/pkg/foo.mpkg\" -target /\n\nNow, the problem is that sudo is going to ask you for your administrator password when you try to run installer. If you want to automate this, you need to tell your Mac not to require your sudo password when running the installer. To do that, you can add this line to your /etc/sudoers file:\n%admin ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/installer\n\nSee man visudo for instructions on editing that file.\nSecond, the practical concern\nIf you are the only person who uses your Mac, adding the above line to /etc/sudoers is not a big deal.\nHowever, if this is a shared Mac, then other people who are in the 'admin' group will be able to run /usr/sbin/installer without being prompted for their password.\nAlso, obviously if someone gets into your 'admin' account, they too could, theoretically, cause mischief with /usr/sbin/installer. Although I am at a loss to think of exactly what they would do, it's a trade-off of security versus convenience.\nThird, a github script\nI wrote pkginstall.sh to do some nice things like log the process, as well as tell you whether or not you are supposed to reboot after installing the package.\nLast but not least: Automate \"how?\"\nAs far as how you want to automate the installation, that depends on more specifics of what you are trying to do. You could, for example, make a folder such as ~/Action/AutoInstallPKG/ and tell launchd to install any .pkg or .mpkg files that are added to that folder, and then move it aside afterwards.\nI have been meaning to do something like this for a long time, and so I finally put it together.

Long story short, I'm likely going to have my iPhone 5 replaced today.  I want to ensure that my messages are transfered to the new phone (or at least saved in some way - it could even be a text file for all I care).\nFrom what I'm reading, if I do an iCloud backup, the new phone will be restored and I should have my messages.  However I would feel better if I could see them on my iPod touch ahead of time for a number of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I view the data in the iPhone backup (by going to Settings --> iCloud --> Storage & Backup --> Manage Storage --> iPhone), there is no \"Messages\" app in the list of Backup Options, so I'm suspicious that they aren't backed up at all.\n\n*It will likely take a long time to restore the 3GB backup, so I'm not sure if I can do it at the store while I'm there to verify, before I give them my old phone.\n\n\nSo now I'm trying to sync the messages from the phone to the iPod somehow.  I have the iPhone backup in iCloud, but I cannot see it or find any way to restore it on the iPod.  How can I do this?  Is it even possible, given that the phone is on iOS 7 but the iPod is on 5.1.1?  Note, I do not have access to a computer to do any kind of wired sync, if that's necessary.\nEDIT:  The iPod is 3rd Generation.  The iPhone is an iPhone 5.\n\nA: Nope, the iOS 7 backup can't be restored to the iOS 5 device through iCloud.\niCloud Backup will backup almost everything on the device including the contents of /var/mobile which therefore includes your messages as well as other data. There is never any 'Messages' option in iCloud Backup, but if the backup was successful then it has been backed up.\n", "Q: Can't delete .plist files from Trash I have a program which, when deleting any app, also deletes the extra files and junk as well; including .plist files.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks!\nOS X 10.9 (13A603)\n\nA: When you have problems to empty the trash, rm -rf ~/.Trash/* in the terminal does the job for you. \nEdit :\nYou have to keep in mind that there might be multiple .Trash directories. \nFor example on a USB stick or a external Drive, OSX will create another .Trash at the root of the drive. So you might need to use  rm -rf /Volumes/DriveName/.Trash.* \n\nA: If none of the other solutions work, you may have to turn off System Integrity Protection in Mac OS X.  This was a solution found suggested on Apple Stack Exchange as a method for editing the Keyboard-en.plist files for the Press-and-Hold Character Picker in OS X.  Their solution referenced MacWorld UK here.  To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your Mac into Recovery Mode (Restart, hold ⌘-R until the Apple logo appears)\n\n*When the OS X Utilities window appears, go to Utilities > Terminal\n\n*Type csrutil disable and hit Enter\n\n*Reboot your Mac\n\n*Empty your trash.  The .plist files should disappear\n\n*Reboot into Recovery Mode and this time enter csrutil enable into Terminal and then reboot again to resume System Integrity Protection on your Mac.\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if I will continue running into this issue or not and or if this was the \"correct\" way of doing it though, the following worked to delete the files:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/24122/33469\n\nA: I had this issue.

For the past 6 weeks, 2-3 times a week my two-year-old iPhone 4S (with no replacement parts) has crashed in the middle of use. I get a black screen with a spinner, and then it powers down. After switching back on manually it seems to be fine until the next crash.\nI've deliberately not upgraded to iOS 7 (running 6.1.1 since Feb 2013) as I want to try to get another 6 months or so out of this device, and don't want to worry about possible slowness / battery problems with an older device (although I'm not after advice about whether those problems are likely), as I'm already getting pretty poor battery life.\nA full restore via iTunes, home/lock button resets and all the usual voodoo haven't stopped the crashes. \nAs I've not changed anything major (the OS or my usage habits) I'm wondering:\n\n\n*\n\n*is battery age or the general age of the hardware (although I don't s'pose many other parts degrade over time) likely to be causing this?\n\n*could it be all the apps that've been upgraded for iOS 7 have introduced some instability on older versions of the OS?\n\n*or am I barking up the wrong tree altogether?\nIn case it helps, these are some examples of recent times when I've had crashes:\n\n\n*\n\n*36% battery, device locked and playing audio via Instacast\n\n*22% battery, copy/pasting in Safari\n\n*40% battery, switching apps after copying from Instapaper (log below)\n\n\nUpdate\nThanks Andrew Larsson for the helpful comment suggesting I post a crash log (duh!).

A helpful answer there explained that as a battery nears the end of its life, it can exhibit voltage drops (even before being empty) which result in this sort of behaviour. The logs indicate that this is what's happening.\nLooking at low battery logs from previous crashes, I've noticed they've sometimes happened while I've been using stock iOS 6.1.1 apps, which rules out my idea that some updated-for-iOS-7 apps aren't fully backwards compatible and are causing this.\n", "Q: How can I reset a device with broken lock button and touchscreen? I have an iPhone 4s on iOS 7. My lock (sleep/wake) button has been broken for months now and I've been using the assisted touch service to lock my phone screen ever since.\nHowever, just over an hour ago my touch screen has decided to pack in also. I can bring up the menus from swiping up and down but anything else will not work, at all. So obviously I can't restart my phone by holding the power button and home button at the same time since the lock button doesn't work and I also can't turn it off as you must swipe the screen to select \"power off\". Has anyone got any ideas on how I can try to fix this?\n\nA: You can go into your settings and turn on Assistive touch to turn your phone off.. The only way to turn it back on though is by using your charger.. If your phone decides it doesn't want to turn on anymore or charge like mine does then your stuck with a phone that wont turn on..\n\nA: take out the battery you guys really go around this the hard way lol.\n\nA: Take out the battery and then wait ten seconds then put the battery back in and plug it in for one second to turn it on then it should work.\nTaking out the battery can be hard. A speciall tool is needed to remove the back. Once that is complete use a small screw driver to remove the cable to the battery. \n\nA: I haven't tried this, but theoretically it should work.\nThe jailbreak tool redsn0w has functionality which allows you to boot your device into DFU mode (Device Firmware Upgrade), which allows you to restore the device's firmware. Usually, one would use the Home and Power buttons to do such a thing. However, these instructions should help you enter DFU mode without using the Home and Power buttons.\nIf you wanted to try a restart, you could try restoring to a backup. Not only would this fix any problems that may have developed, but it also requires rebooting the device, which may even fix the Power button.\n\nA: you have to go into iTunes and restore it. plus she/he probably has a insurance plan and made a claim to get a new phone. \n", "Q: Securely delete guest accounts in OSX I need a way to securely wipe guest accounts accounts off of my machine. On OSX, guests are automatically deleted on logout, with this deletion being done using the \"RM\" command. I need a way to alter this to either the secure form of \"RM\" (RM -p I believe?) or to use \"SRM\" instead.\nAlternatively, workarounds would be highly helpful. Currently, I believe it may be possible to replace \"RM\" with \"SRM\" on a system level, albeit I am unsure if it is plausible or possible. Other workarounds I have considered is manually deleting the files (it should be possible to run a script on logout that does this?) or, on startup, find a way to potentially write over the HDD sectors with 0's and 1's.\nIn summation....\nIs it possible (and if so, how) to delete guest account data securely?\nNote I am tagging this under OSX, UNIX, and LINUX because I feel that an answer would be valid for all platforms of this type. This was also Xposted on Stack Overflow\n\nA: It's kinda possible. You can use a logout hook to run a script when a user logs out. This will also be run when the guest user is logged out, too. All you would need to do is create a script that SRMs the guest home folder when the Mac is logged out of or shut down.\nThis command will initiate a login hook (presuming that /usr/local/bin/logoutscript exists and is chmodded correctly so that the script is executable) \nsudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook /usr/local/bin/logoutscript\n\nYou can easily write a shell script that would SRM the Guest account home folder.\n", "Q: iPad screen is black and won't turn on after charging and resetting Yesterday I dropped my iPad 3 but luckily the screen did not crack.

If that doesn't work, you may wish to take it into the nearest Apple Store, or finding a place that'll repair your iPad, because if none of the above worked, then I'm afraid your iPad is dead.\n\nA: I've run into this same problem, as has a friend of mine, since we updated our iPhones to OS7. However, I don't recall whether either of us dropped our device or subjected it to shock.\nAs I recall, I was able to resolve it by powering down and rebooting, but it sounds like you tried that already. You might also try reseating the SIM chip if you've got a model with a cellular connection, and you should probably do so when it's powered down. (I'm not certain whether that matters.) You could also try hooking it up to your computer and doing a reset-and-restore-style operation.\n", "Q: How can I create an iCal realtime backup? I'd like to create an event in iCal and either 1) save it to multiple calendars, such as create an iCloud event and have it save simultaneously to another calendar, or 2) upon creating an iCloud calendar event, have it automatically copied to a different calendar.  This is more or less the same thing, but makes one think about it in different ways.\nBasically, I want a realtime backup for my iCloud calendar.  I don't know applescript but I could probably learn it - I've done a lot of php, javascript and actionscript coding - I'm just not sure applescript would be the way to go.  Any advice appreciated. Maybe I'm looking at this in the wrong way.\nThanks, Klaus\n\nA: Maybe merging iCloud, local, and Gmail all together and then having Time Machine? \nYour thoughts (dare I say paranoia) are interesting and the goal, unique. You could also create a script that runs at a set time interval and fetches your calendars and archives them in a method of your choosing.\nMaybe the simplest would be to create an Automator script that will fetch your iCloud calendars and then save it to your ideal location and archive it automatically. The file of your calendar can be pulled when you go into iCal.app and then obtain the URL for sharing the calendar. Copy that URL and change \"webcal://p20-calendarws.icloud.com/ca/subscribe/...\" to \"http://p20-calendarws.icloud.com/ca/subscribe/...\"\nThat should fit the bill and keep system and effort to a minimum.\n", "Q: Mavericks entering accents into Chrome?

Is there any way I can resolve the issue? I've tried switching stores and had no luck.\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple no longer sells OS X Lion in the Mac App Store. It's not even available in the US Mac App Store and there is no way that you can get OS X Lion from Apple.

I realized that it doesn't work when I tried using Skype.\nCould you please help me figure this out?\n\nA: I assume your microphone works fine under OSX?\nDid you download and install the bootcamp drivers for Windows 7?\nWindows needs the driver installed to \"see\" the microphone and access it.\nCan you see the microphone in the device manager?\nDid you check the input levels for the microphone in Windows audio setup control panel? The gain may need to be adjusted.\n", "Q: Mail in Mavericks does not correctly text wrap / no option to view in plain text This problem has been brought up in the Apple discussion forum, but with no success. It is two related problems that have cropped up in the Mail application in Mavericks (OS X v10.9):\nFirst, there is no longer a \"view in plain text\" option for viewing mail messages:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/23526803#23526803\nSecond, the Mail app does not correctly word wrap messages:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/23566666#23566666\nSpecifically, if a message has an HTML  environment (i.e., pre-formatted) with a very long line with no carriage returns, then that line runs way, way off the edge of the window. This longest line effectively defines the length of the text wrap so all other lines also run off the right edge of the window, forcing the user to tediously scroll horizontally far, far to the right to read each line. This seems to happen in, e.g., a multi-part mime message; even if it has a plain-text alternative, Mail is using that HTML formatting of that  formatted text to define the width of the window for wrapping all other text in the message, and Mail no longer offers the option to view the message as plain text.\nOne workaround is that the user can select to \"forward\" the message, and while the message is in the editing window, the text wraps correctly and can be read without horizontal scrolling. This is a hassle and not an acceptable solution. \nSo, after that long preamble, my question is: How can I make Mail always wrap text of viewed messages to the window width in ALL cases?\n\nA: There is an application called SmartWrap that, until the latest update (10.9.1) worked flawlessly to wrap text within the Mail.app viewing window. However, despite several email discussions with the developer, it may be broken (temporarily, I hope, since I've used the application for more than a decade without a hitch).\n\nA: There is also a free option available:\nhttps://github.com/arachsys/mailwrap\nIt requires some work to install due to an underlying bug in OS-X (you have to disable SIP during the install), but after that, it should continue to \"just work\".\n", "Q: How to get to know OS X/Unix better? Not sure how to ask this but this problem has troubled me for so long.\nI'd long been a DOS/Windows user until about 12 years ago when Mac OS X first came out I turned to the Mac, and stayed here ever since. I'm 32 so I basically grew up using text-based/command-line UI, starting from DOS 3.1 when 3.5\" floppy disks weren't even supported. So I'm pretty comfortable using command line UI no problem. But the thing is, since I came to OS X, I've never really understood how this OS works.\nLike say on DOS or early Windows OSes. I know there's autoexec.bat and config.sys where I can make changes to so to make the computer do what I want it do to at startup. And I know all the basic functions are stored in some directory called \"Command\" where I can find most of what I need to move around the OS. The file system is pretty straight forward. Each disk has a name, A, B, C, D, E and so on and so forth which appear to be at the top level of the file system, which makes sense to me as everything basically stored in these hardwares. And I also know if say I'm at certain directory but I need to use some function that's not in this directory, I can put the directory of that function into \"PATH\" so that I can use it wherever I want.\nBut on the Mac (and same on Linux. I've tried it quite a few times but sort of got stuck in the same place), I don't how to do any of these. Not that I need to do something like this everyday, since we have the all might GUI, but when I need it it's really a big problem for me. For example sometimes I need to install something that requires some command line knowledge, like Octave. After some research I know I need to use something called package manager like Fink, Macport or Homebrew. If they can just work out of the box I wouldn't be here asking this. The problem is very often they don't. They almost always get stuck in somewhere during the install. And there is also always some essential knowledge I don't know, like I can choose among the three but I can't use any two of them at the same time as my package manager or something might go wrong. OK, something might go wrong...how would I know that before something really goes wrong? Why is this case? Why can't I use both at the same time? When I install them, where do they put the binaries? Will Homebrew put the directory into the default path so I can use it whenever I want by itself? During install when there's warning or error, should I just ignore it?\nThe first time I tried to install Octave on my mac I actually tried all three without knowing I can't use all three at the same time. But what else could I do after seeing both Fink and Macport failed the job. And the last time I tried to install Octave it literately took me three days. Because at that I've already learned I couldn't use all three and also I should use Homebrew because it's the one that worked before. So it took me 3 days to do some ad-hoc research on the internet with no success, and then I thought I might just give Fink a try again, and it worked! I just don't understand any of this... And I should consider myself lucky that I even got it to work, because so far I still haven't found a way to install numpy to my Python 3. And don't know how long it had taken me now...\nIt's the same as when I used to want to try using Linux. I know a little bit of coding. Although I mainly use Python, I still have a bit of knowledge of languages like C/C#. So I know what compiling means. The problem with Linux (and mac too), is when I want to install something, often times I need to compile the binaries from the source code first. And a lot of things can go wrong during the process of compiling (to which I don't know why). And this is not something searching on the internet can help me cuz most of the answers provided on the internet are ad-hoc based. They tell you you should try this command or that command and see if that works. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. But the problem is even if it works and solves the problem, I still don't know why it works. At this point I still don't know, say when I've finally finished compiling the source code, where is the binary? Is the binary I get the actually application or it's just an installer? If it's an installer, how do I install it? Where do I install it to? And things might go wrong during the installation as well. As I said earlier, resorting to the internet doesn't really help in this case cuz even if I've got it to work this time, next time when something similar happens, I still have to go through the whole internet-research thing again. It's really time-consuming and frustrating, cuz you don't know what you're doing and you feel like you're Sisyphus trying to get the rock to the top of the mountain over and over again just to see it rolls down once again...\nSo my question is this:\nIs there any book or online course that can help me get to the bottom of this? Compared with spending another 100 hours on searching on the internet and still get stuck in the same place I rather spend that 100 hours (and I would assume it'd be far less than this) to build some firm foundation for my understanding of any Unix like system.\nIt's a long article so thank you so much for reading it!\n\nA: Apple offers a free shell script primer which you can access here:\n\n*\n\n*HTML\n\n\n*PDF\nThose are both free.\nThere's also Learning Unix for OS X ($12 ebook)\nI definitely recommend Homebrew as it seems to be the most actively maintained of the 3 variants.\n\nA: This is the book I used to get comfortable with Unix: http://www.amazon.com/Mac-OS-Tiger-Unix-Geeks-ebook/dp/B0043EWTXK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1386847146&sr=8-2&keywords=mac+os+unix+geek\nIt is really well written but has a lot of 10.4 things that have changed or been modified slightly. I am sure you could find cheap copies of it though. TJ's points are also fantastic and highly recommend them as well. Lots of great online resources for getting familiar with Unix. \n\nA: UNIX filesystem hierarchy doesn't use MS-DOS/Windows type \"Drive Letters\", rather all filesystems fall under / (the very top level).\nA UNIX machine can have multiple disks and/or partitions, but only one if them is mounted as /. The rest are mounted somewhere under / (either at that level or some lower level).\nFor example, say I have 4 hard disks and want to use them all:\nDisk 1: mounted at /\nDisk 2: mounted at /extra-disks (must create empty directory /extra-disks first)\nDisk 3: mounted at /extra-disks/music (must create empty directory /extra-disks/music first)\nDisk 4: mounted at /extra-disks/database (again, must create it first)\nOr, I could split the operating system installation itself like this:\nDisk 1: /\nDisk 2: /usr\nDisk 3: /usr/local\nDisk 4: /var\nTo temporarily put a directory in the search path of a user, open a terminal and type:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/extra-disks/database\n\nThere are also ways to do this permanently, depending on the shell you are using. If your shell is bash, then you can edit your .bash_profile and add / edit the export command mentioned above. This will make the change permanent, starting with the next login.\n\nA: Considering you have previous knowledge and not afraid of command line. I would suggest start installing archlinux in a virtualbox, and play with it. The installation process will tell you a lot about Linux/Unix basic knowledge. The pacman and AUR will tell you about a nice package manager and community. Compared to the complexity of OS X, archlinux is easier for understanding linux/unix. I personally also find OS X package managers such as homebrew quite confusing and annoying and prefer the Arch Way.\nI think the knowledge you gained playing with it will help you resolve OS X issues in the future.\n", "Q: Unable to enable AVB under Mavericks on MacBook Pro I have a MacBook Pro that has the Thunderbolt hardware which means it should be able to support EthernetAVB.

To filter the entries one uses grep:\n\nThe grep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that\n  match one or more patterns.

Patterns may consist of one or more lines, allowing any of the pattern lines to match a portion of the input.\n\nand the option -E does the following:\n\n-E, --extended-regexp\nInterpret pattern as an extended regular expression (i.e. force grep to behave as \n  egrep).\n\nThe regex in this case is \"(LISTEN|ESTABLISHED)\" which means just print the lines with listen or established.\nConclusion\n\n\n*\n\n*lsof builds a list with all Internet connections. \n\n*To be useful it needs to be filtered with grep\n\n*So it gets filtered with the regular expression which is looking for either LISTEN or ESTABLISHED\n", "Q: Settings app broken I use an iPad Air with iOS 7.0.3.

Has anyone an idea what to do?\n\nA: These are only suggestions, not definitive answers, but try the following:\n1) Double tap home to enter the multitasking screen, and dismiss the settings app (flick it off the screen) - this app uses fast app switching to save state so next time it restarts, it restarts in the same area.  This can be persistent over a reboot.  Force quitting the app in this way should require it to restart from scratch and drop the saved state\n2) Remove the Gmail app, it's possible that corrupt settings are making the settings app crash, and removal of the app may also result in removal of those settings\nIf none of these work, you are looking at a restore.\n", "Q: Must I reformat my hard drive to reclaim space from unused 2nd partition?

If you have an Apple Wireless keyboard or another wireless keyboard, start holding the keys after the screen turns on and the startup sound is played. If that doesn't work, and you also tried holding option during startup but the recovery partition was not shown on the list of startup options, you could try using Recovery Disk Assistant to create a recovery partition on an external drive.\nSimply reinstalling OS X won't probably get rid of the virus though.

What's happen?\n\nA: sudo requires a password by default on Mac OS X.\nApple's knowledge base article explains more, Mac OS X: sudo command requires a non-blank admin password:\n\nIn Mac OS X v10.5 through 10.5.8, if you press the Return key at the\n  password prompt without entering a password (even if the user has no\n  password, which is not recommended), the command entered will not\n  execute and you will be returned to a command prompt.\nIn Mac OS X v10.6 or later, if you press the Return key at the\n  password prompt without entering a password, the message \"Sorry, try\n  again.\" will be displayed and you will be prompted for a password\n  again.\nIf your administrator account has no password (a blank password),\n  you must give that user a password before using the sudo command.\n\nIf you must remove the need for a password to use sudo, you can edit the /etc/sudoers file using visudo command. A thread on macoshints discusses how:\n\nUse the visudo command as root.\nLook for the line:\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\nChange it to:\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nRequiring a password is highly recommended. Removing this check reduces the security of your Mac and exposes your computer to attack or abuse.\n\nA: Based off of what you have written so far, I am assuming you are running 10.7 or newer on your computer. When you have Mac OS Lion or newer then sudo actually requires a password either from an Admin account or with a password set up for root user.\nIf you are no admin then sudo is out of your hands. If you are then your password must be something. Leaving your password empty is not possible of you have to sudo. Temporarily add a password to the account and then proceed.

I'm getting a bit confused on how to handle spaces in path names when returned in a for loop.\nRationale: I'm cleaning up the permissions on folders and files that I copy over from Windows. Most of the files end up with -rwx------ or -rwxr-xr-x permissions so I like to do \"chmod -x *\" and then \"chmod u+x <folders>\" so I'm trying the following:\n$ alias getdirs='find . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d | cut -c 3-'\n$ for i in $(getdirs); do chmod u+x $i; done\n\nwhich works fine, as long as the directories don't have a space in the name.\nI've tried different permutations of chmod u+x \"$i\", chmod u+x '$i' and similar to get the behavior I wanted, but to no avail.\nHow to improve my bash code, that works with folder names containing space?\nThe purpose of this is to be able to remove the \"exec\" bit from plain files (hence the chmod -x * part) but then to restore it to the directories to allow getting into them (chmod u+x <dirname>). From the comments and answers so far I'm thinking that it probably will be easier to do with the proper \"find\" incantation\n\nA: In general, the 'proper' way to parse the output of find into a bash loop is to use a while read loop, rather than a for loop. In bash, for loops split using any whitespace (space, tab, newline) by default -- this can be changed, but it's easier and (in my opinion) cleaner to use read, which reads one line at a time by default.\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d | while read i; do chmod u+x \"$i\"; done\n\nNote that I quoted the \"$i\" there -- that's just as important, because quoting variables prevents the shell from splitting their contents (it's the same problem that for has, but on the other end). Also note that you can't use single quotes: '$i' would return a literal $i, rather than the contents of the variable.\nThis will still break on directories with newlines in their names. There is a workaround involving find's -print0, but I've only ever seen newlines in filenames specifically made to test scripts. I don't know if this works with the version of bash in OSX (taken from greg's wiki):\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' i; do chmod u+x \"$i\"; done\n\nHowever, in this case it's easier to use globs: a glob ending in a / will expand to directories only, so you could just\nchmod u+x */\n\n(this will work perfectly well with spaces, newlines, anything). More generally, to loop through all directories:\nfor f in */; do stuff with \"$f\"; done\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way to select files only with globs in any version of bash (this is one of the reasons I prefer zsh, where the globs are powerful enough that you never have to bother with find).\n\nA: I have two suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use sed to put quotes around all the directory names.\n\n*Pipe to xargs with argument -L 1. This will execute a command on each line of stdin, obviating the for loop.\n\n\nTry this pipeline:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d | cut -c 3- | sed 's/.*/\"&\"/' | xargs -L 1 chmod u+x\n\nA: The crux of the issue is that word-splitting happens for command substitution, so that names with spaces in them are indistinguishable from separate names entirely. Globbing does not suffer from this difficulty, so if there's a way to identify directories with a glob and avoid the command substitution entirely, you're home free. And there is:\nchmod -x *\nchmod u+x */\n\nBut even this is too much work, because chmod has the X (capital X) symbolic flag, which applies the executable bit only to directories and files that are already executable. So you can really just do:\nchmod -x *\nchmod u+X *\n\n\nA: These kind of things can be tricky in all Unix shells due to the way space is acting as a separator, running aliases as part of shell scripts just makes things even more interesting. I would probably run two passes of find to set first the directories in order, and then next the files:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d -exec chmod u+x '{}' \\;\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type f -exec chmod u-x '{}' \\;\n\n\nA: Either your alias is only pulling the first bit before the space, or your for loop is only reading the first bit\nYou can test this by adding some test commentary into your commands, I've limited the alias to only pull the last found directory to isolate the iterations to 1, printed out what the alias thinks it's receiving, and then echoed the variable contents to ensure they match:\njaravj$ alias getdirs='find . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d | tail -1|  cut -c 3-'\njaravj$ getdirs\njaravj$ for i in $(getdirs); do echo \"Filename is \"$i; chmod u+x $i; done\n\nEDIT: changed do; echo ... to do echo ... as it was preventing the line from executing\n", "Q: How to kill the popup in OS X when a disk can't be ejected With ZFS-OSX, sometimes when I try to force eject my HDD and it's failing, the following popup appears on my screen – floating on the top with all the buttons grayed out – and no possibility to close it no matter what I do:\n\nThe disk \"WD_1TB\" wasn't ejected because one or more programs may be using it. \nTo eject the disk immediately, click the Force Eject button.\n    Cancel    Force Eject…\n\n\nIt's quite annoying.

It happens a few times per day, and it's annoying and dilutes the value of notifications that actually ARE relevant (i.e. I start ignoring them because there are low-value notifications popping up all the time).\nSo, my question is this: How can I turn notifications off for the App Store, and leave the automatic update feature and notification center turned on?\n\nA: I don't have any apps installed to try this with, but this looked like it might work. The solution is for Mountain Lion, not Mavericks, so it may have changed.\nHow do I turn off App Store notifications in Mountain Lion\n\nI just discovered the missing solution here:\n  http://osxdaily.com/2012/11/15/stop-software-update-mac-os-x/\nYou can selectively disable notifications about specific software\n  updates you don't care about (like useless App updates) by\n  control-clicking the update inside the App Store to reveal a hidden\n  \"Hide Update\" option.\nThis is best for those who want to keep Notification Center active for\n  all its other uses (calendar alarms, etc.) and who also want to be\n  notified about critical software updates. It should permanently mute\n  notifications about certain software updates (until that software\n  comes out with a new update).\n\n", "Q: New MBP 13\" can't connect to external monitor I am trying to connect my oldish LG monitor with DVI port (adapter hdmi to dvi is in monitors end) to my macbook pro 13\" (late 2013 haswell model)\nand it is pretty weird, macbook recognizes monitors model, I can change resolution, even hertz rate is correct- 59hz, but monitor just says to check cable.

I just installed a new font, and I'd like to be able to type in it, system-wide, and not just within the confines of some application (e.g. MS Word.)  I already type in other languages using the Language & Text preference pane.  Is there any way to use the TTF as a keyboard?\nThanks\n\nA: You can not simply \"type in another font\" system-wide, since it is each application's responsibility to include support for fonts on its own. Installing a new font merely gives you the possibility to use it in applications, for example a plain-text application will never be able to handle fonts at all.\nIf what you want is to change the system font itself, then the answer is here: Can I change the font systemwide (10.8.3)\n\nA: In order to be able to type in another language you will need not only a font but also a keyboard layout.\nFor some languages you might want to create your own, and for that you can use the Ukelele software.\n\nA: A source for Unicode Paleo Hebrew and related fonts is at\nhttp://culmus.sourceforge.net/ancient/index.html\nInput for most can be via Character Viewer or the OS X Hebrew keyboard layout or a Phoenician layout available at\nhttp://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46870715/k/Phoenician.keylayout\n", "Q: AppleScript and Finder - How to detect an \"empty\" selection when copying paths to the clipboard (Expanded Question) I'm trying to build a Service that does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If some folder/files are selected in Finder, copy (all) the paths to the clipboard\n\n*If nothing is selected, copy the \"Path\" of the window.\n\n\nDigging around and getting inspiration from posts such as Copying the current directory's path to the clipboard and MacYourself's Copy file or folder path to the clipboard in Mac OS X Lion I've got to the point where I can get the paths of the selection, but I seem to be stuck when trying to get the path of the current window if selection empty.\nUPDATE 13-Dec-2013. I've got some useful feedback (see https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/113612/7488; thanks @Flavin) so I have updated the code to the one below:\n    on run {input, parameters}\n\n        set l to {}\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            set sel to (get selection)\n            if not sel = {} then -- there are some file/folders selected\n\n                repeat with f in (get selection)\n                    set end of l to POSIX path of (f as alias)\n                end repeat\n\n            else --no stuff is selected, get the current location path\n\n                set end of l to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias)\n\n            end if\n        end tell\n        set text item delimiters to linefeed\n        set the clipboard to (l as text)\n\n    end run\n\nThe logic seems solid, and it works as long as I have \"something\" selected in Finder.\nI suspect that the Service might not be \"Active\" when there is nothing selected, (that is, when the desired result would be to copy the current path to the clipboard).\nIn this situation, the Finder window appears thusly:\n\nBut trying to active the Service shows an \"empty\" service list:\n\nWhen I have something selected, the Services list is populated:\n\nThe \"Copy File Path\" that I've defined is associated with \"Files and Folders\" in the Services Preferences -- what might be the issue?\n\nA: I think = is what you're looking for.\nset sel to (get selection)\nif not sel = {} then\n    --stuff is selected\nelse\n    --no stuff is selected\nend if\n\nOr remove the not and flip the cases\nset sel to (get selection)\nif sel = {} then\n    --no stuff is selected\nelse\n    --stuff is selected\nend if\n\n\nA: It now works. The key is on how the \"Automator\" service is defined.\nWhen initially configured, the Automator Service was defined as \"Files or Folder\" in \"Finder\":\n\nSo in the Preferences the Service is associated with Files and Folders:\n\nAnd the result is that the service is not \"active\" when there is no selection (we get the same image than in the question):\n\nChanging the definition of the service to \"No Input\":\n\nMeans that the Service is available when there is no selection in Finder:\n\nChecking in the Services Preferences, now the Service is associated with the \"General\" category:\n\nAnd the behavior is as expected.\n", "Q: unplug externally plugged HDMI display from MacBook Pro I usually add an external monitor to my MacBook Pro as a second monitor. The only way I've found to unplug it without switching off the MacBook (or putting it to sleep) is by simply unplugging the HDMI cable.\nThe screen goes dark for a second as the system brings all the open windows over to the one screen (since I'm using the additional display as a second monitor instead of mirroring).\nI feel this may result in some problem some day. \nIs there a better way of doing this, say from the System Preferences interface?\n\nA: This shouldn't result in a problem (and well-written apps will go back to their original monitor when it is plugged back in). System Preferences has no utility to disconnect monitors that are still physically connected. \nOne alternative may be to turn the monitor off: many monitors stop identifying themselves when they're off, so your Mac will think it's been unplugged without it physically being unplugged.\n\nA: Locking you Macbook before closing it will disconnect the HDMI connection.\n", "Q: Calendar entries do not display Recently all of the entries in my iphone (4s) calendar appeared to disappear, both on the phone and on the icloud.

The default resolution tends to be pretty high, usually around 2500 X 1900. \nLately some of my photos have come out with a very low resolution, 640x480, rendering them useless for my purpose.  I have not been using HD, nor have I changed any settings. I don't even see an option to change the resolution. \nWhy would this be happening?\n\nA: Have you shot any of those images with the \"other\" camera? The \"face time\" camera will only shoot a resolution of 640x480 and the \"regular\" camera shoots the higher resolution (5MP). Apple specs of the iPhone 4 states the face time camera shoots VGA (see http://support.apple.com/kb/sp587).\nThe high res camera shoots frontward. The face time camera shoots backwards (it is located near the ear speaker in the top of the phone above the screen). When using the camera app, if you press the icon that has the circular arrows, the camera changes to the one facing you (you will see yourself in the screen). That is the \"face time\" camera and shoots low res.\n\nA: I have just had exactly the same thing happen... All my todays photos were worthless... I found that I must have accidentally turned the flash back to auto. When I changed it back from \"auto\" to \"off\" the resolution went back up.\n", "Q: Is it safe to delete dSYM files on Mac OS X? I've got a few large dSYM files on my machine, installed by the Qt Framework. As I understand they are used for debugging, however I don't actually need to debug the library itself. Is it safe to delete these files?\n\nA: Yes, you can delete these debug symbol files safely. These files provide human readable names for code within the framework or application.\nRemoving the dSYM files will not affect the framework or associated application's ability to run.\nPurpose of a dSYM\nShould the calling application or framework crash, the dSYM file is used to provide more readable insight into where the crash occurred in the code.\nApple's Technical Note 2151 shows how dSYM files are used – the same approach applies to iOS and Mac OS X.\ndSYM for Developers\nIdeally, the developer keeps a copy of the dSYM files and does not distribute these files with their application or frameworks.\nWhen crashes occur, the customer sees a technically obtuse crash report which they can report. The developer can then combine their local dSYM files with the crash report and produce a more readable crash report that should help track down the problem.\n", "Q: Capturing text with a bookmarklet in IOS7 Is it possible to capture text from Safari using a bookmarklet on an iPod Touch/iPhone when running iOS7? \nIn iOS6 I could select text, and then open a bookmarklet (like this one for example) which grabbed the text using window.getSelection().\nHowever, it seems in iOS7, any action to invoke a bookmarklet deselects the text. Am I just missing something, or is this broken? \n\nA: AFAIK it's no longer possible.\nTried looking at the contents of window.getSelection() by remote debugging my iPhone through Safari. Text is indeed deselected. But even visually, I'm able to see that text is deselected when you tap a link or open the bookmarks menu.\nIn regards to describing this as \"broken\", I suppose it's a matter of how you look at it. It could be argued that deselecting is the correct behavior and therefore I doubt it's something that'll get \"fixed\". \n", "Q: Screen captures of windows larger than screen Is there a way to capture a screenshot of a browser window / webpage which is larger than the MacBook Air (1366x768) screen it's displayed on?\nI need to have captures of how a site displays in a 1280x1024 window.

I force quit it, but it comes back in a few minutes again.\n\n\n\nA: Given ouc is not a process that ships with Mac OS X it appears a third party product is causing the problem.\nSearching the web suggests ouc is embedded within an application called \"Mobile Partner.app\".\nIf you have this application, please report the problem to the developers.\nManual Removal\nIt is always better to use the removal process provided by the developer; however, if Mobile Partner does not provide a removal tool, you might like to disable the ouc process manually.\nYou mention force quitting results in an immediate relaunching. This suggests the ouc process is managed by a launchd job ticket. launchd is a watchdog process that will monitor processes and relaunch any that run into trouble - such as crashing or being force quit.\nTake a look in the following folders for a launchd job ticket associated with ouc:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/LaunchAgents\n\n*~/Library/LaunchDaemons\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons\n\n\nThe files in these folders are text files and can be read using TextEdit or a dedicated text editing tool, such as TextWrangler.\nIf you find a file mentioning ouc, move it out of the parent folder and restart.\nAs @oma mentions, if you can not find a launchd job ticket, look inside /Library/StartupItems for a folder or file containing ouc.

Some iPhone users (especially those with devices that've been in use for a while) encounter a problem where the device crashes once the battery gets low. For example:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*\"After updating to iOS 7 my iPhone 5 has been doing something strange.\n  When the battery gets low (usually around 20-30%), iOS will shut down\n  completely, and when you try to power the phone back on it flashes on\n  the screen telling you to plug the phone in to charge it (saying that\n  the battery is almost completely dead).   The phone refuses to power\n  on until you plug it in, but once I plug the phone in and power it\n  back on, the battery life shows the last percentage it was at before\n  it crashed (20-30%). This has happened to me more than once, so I know\n  it's not just some crazy fluke.\"\n  https://discussions.apple.com/message/23587500#23587500\n  \n*\"I have a 3GS that is almost 2 years old now and had a hard life. It\n  has now developed a tendency to crash when the battery gets below 25%.\n  it will restart using the top button ok but as soon as you put any\n  strain on the battery it crashes when at this low level. When the\n  phone is charged it seems to work fine.\"\n  http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1139488\n  \n*\"I have a weird problem with my iPhone 5. My phone switches off when\n  the battery is low. I was at 23% charge and just browsing facebook\n  when my battery died. The other day I was at 13% charge and it\n  switched off. Last week 17%.. It refuses to switch back on until it\n  was plugged into the wall. I have tried restoring the phone and set up\n  as new but I still have the same problem. It just seems to switch off\n  when the battery is low at different percentages.\"\n  https://discussions.apple.com/message/22284705#22284705\n\nIt seems to happen on various model iPhones and versions of the OS; it's currently happening to me on a heavily used two year old 4S running iOS 6.1.1.\nTidBITS suggests that:\n\n\"The common element in these crashes is low battery life, usually under 20 percent, although one crash occurred at almost 30 percent. When I give the iPhone power, it restarts immediately and shows the expected amount of battery life remaining. So it’s not that the battery is actually running out; instead, [iOS's] power management code is freaking out once the battery level falls to around 20 percent. I do see a number of LowBatteryLog files in Settings > General > About > Diagnostics & Usage > Diagnostic & Usage Data, though their contents don’t reveal a smoking gun. Letting the battery run down completely and then recharging entirely to recalibrate it made no difference.\"\n\n(NB. TidBITS writes about this as it pertains to iOS 7 only.)\nSo, my question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do we know, technically, what is causing these crashes beyond simply \"the power management code is freaking out\"?\n\n*Are there any software hacks, fixes or usage habits (beyond usual battery saving/care techniques and \"just get a new battery/don't let the battery get low!\") that might help avoid these crashes?\n\n\n(I'm interested in general answers, but in case it's of use here are the low battery logs from my two most recent crashes.)\n\nA: If your phone shuts down with more than 10% charge remaining on the estimate, then you have a voltage / capacity issue in the battery and should have the device tested with Apple diagnostics to check the health of the battery. Think of a small town with a medium sized reservoir and a small water tower. The reservoir level can have water, but if it’s not pressurized (voltage) in the tower, the system can ask for more water (current) than the tower can supply. For a shower, the water just stops, but for an iPhone, it shuts off when the voltage drops too quickly.\nThe diagnostics read the low battery logs and compare them with thousands of other logs and Apple engineering standards to tell if your battery needs to be replaced.\nTechnically, those log files are total benefit with no downside. Your phone is out of juice and will shut down anyway. The OS is logging the data so you can take action on it if you choose. They don't cause anything other than logging what led up to the low power condition. \nI watch my LowBatteryLog-YYYY-MM-DD-hhmmss.plist log files quite regularly to know when to seek service for my battery.\nTechnically, the lithium polymer cells can exhibit voltage drops when they are out of specification but not yet failing or in a state where they should be shut off and not used again.\nLooking more deeply into your two posted logs, I would focus on these lines primarily:\nAwake Time: 03:45:27 (13526)\nStandby Time: 04:55:29 (17729)\nPartial Charge: 0\nCapacity: 0\nVoltage: 3469 mV\n\nWhen Partial Charge is 1 - that means that you plugged it in and the device received a charge between when it was full and first removed from power and it eventually shut itself off due to low power detection. In those cases, I really only focus on the Voltage - knowing when the device decided to preserve the remaining voltage for standby and battery protection. \nThe log above shows a very short awake time and indicates a likelihood that the battery isn't providing the correct duration and amount of power. Even if the CPU is full use, all radios are on, speaker cranking, brightness max - I expect 4 to 5 hours on most devices.\nUnless that 3h45m run was a rare occurrence, my estimate is you need a hardware repair as sleeping more often will allow the sleep time to increase, but never increase the active time.\nFor newer iOS hardware (think iPhone 5 to 10) the voltage to available current to available capacity can also be due to aging, power management software or hardware issues. \n\n\n*\n\n*Why does my iPhone power off when the battery is down to 30%?\n\nA: This is the so-called \"BatteryGate\" and it happens when a battery gets old and cannot provide enough power to the iPhone under \"peak load\" (ie. when there is a sudden draw on the battery for a large amount of power). The battery freaks out and the phone suddenly dies.\nIn iOS 10.2.1 Apple introduced a controversial software \"fix\" for this, which was to limit the performance of the phone after such a crash had been detected, without informing the user. \nAfter a large amount of backlash for what was perceived as a secret throttling of their devices, Apple addressed this issue publically, and in more recent versions of iOS have allowed users to see if their device has been throttled and to disable this feature.\nThe only solution to an iPhone exhibiting this issue is to replace the battery.\nScreenshot of the new Battery Health feature:\n\n", "Q: File selector list not starting at the top When I go to attach a document in mail, I press the attach button, and the file selector dialog opens.

I have a mid 2013 MBA running OSX 10.9.\nThe process that starts on every start up is mysqld. I believe it was from an old version of MySQL I had installed (via AMPPS). I then installed MAMP Pro and I often have conflicts between these two processes. Everytime I shut down and restart my mac, I have to find the process of mysqld that is running (on activity monitor), quit it, and then start MAMP (via the terminal command: /Application/MAMP/bin/startMysql.sh won't work from anywhere else).\nSo I'm wondering how I can disable this mysqld from running on every startup.\n\nA: The following worked for me with mysql 8.0.12 installed using Homebrew in macOS Mojave 10.14.1:\nrm -rf ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist\n\n\nA: If the version of MySQL that was previously installed originated from the MySQL Community Downloads page on the SUN/Oracle site, it's likely that launchd is not involved with startup of the mysqld process. For some reason, the startup script that is distributed with MySQL uses the deprecated \"Startup items\" technology to start processes at boot. In fact, even the current binary distribution (5.6.15) of mysqld uses StartupItems to start the server on OS X(?!)\nThe startup script that's launching the conflicting version of MySQL is most likely located at /Library/StartupItems/MYSQLCOM/MYSQLCOM. At boot time, that startup item will examine the file at /etc/hostconfig to determine if the setting for the \"MYSQLCOM\" variable is set to \"-YES-\". If so, the startup script will launch mysqld.\nIt should be possible to disable the startup of MySQL by modifying the line in /etc/hostconfig that specifies MYSQLCOM=-YES- to say MYSQLCOM=-NO- (which should disable the startup process on the next boot).\nYou can terminate the currently running instance of mysqld by performing the command:\nsudo /Library/StartupItems/MYSQLCOM/MYSQLCOM stop\n\nTo permanently disable the startup of the wrong mysqld process, it should be possible to first stop the daemon using the command above, and then to remove the MySQL startup item using the following command:\nsudo rm -rf /Library/StartupItems/MYSQLCOM\n\nNote: you may also have the MySQL Preference Pane installed at /Library/PreferencePanes/MySQL.prefpane or ~/Library/PreferencePanes/MySQL.prefpane...That preference pane can also be removed to 'cleanup' pieces of the old MySQL installation.\n\nA: Open terminal, then:\nsudo launchctl list | grep -i mysql\n\nlaunchctl remove xxx.xxx.mysql\n\nWhere \"xxx.xxx\" is included in the output of the first command, for example \"org.macports.mysql\". The password for the \"sudo\" command is your own user account's password.\nTrue, sudo isn't needed to \"list\" but because you already gave a sudo password for the first command, it is stored for a short while in session memory and isn't required for the second command (which is privileged). Otherwise, just skip sudo on the first command and use it on the second. There are more ways than one to skin a cat.\n\nA: It might be easier to rename the mysqld (or move / back up / delete it) and then restart and look for the error message for the launch item that was trying to start the program that is no longer available.\nThe other answers seem to cover the tack of looking for Launch Agents and Launch Daemons as well as tracing the PID which generally doesn't work for daemons since they usually have a parent PID of 1.\nAlso, since mysql isn't shipped with Mavericks, you should be able to track the install package you selected or use mdfind mysqld to locate the package that brought that database to your Mac and then locate the uninstall / disable instructions for that package of mysql. You'll also want to look in system preferences in case you have installed a control there to start the software.\n\nA: Start off by finding out what the parent process is that started your mysql. From the Terminal run a ps command to find out what the process is; you can use -j or -l to list out the parent id ppid. So this will show you:\n$ ps -axjc | grep mysql\n\nThe first column is your userid, the second is the process id, the third is the parent id.\nIf the parent id is 1 then it will have been launched by the root launch daemon, which probably means it's coming from one of the LaunchDaemons or StartupItems. If it comes from a process that isn't 1 but that is a launchd process then that's probably the LaunchAgents or is in your system login items.\nroot                1     0     1      0    0 Ss     ??    4:49.10 launchd\nalblue            257     1   257      0    0 Ss     ??    0:16.29 launchd\n_spotlight        415     1   415      0    0 Ss     ??    0:00.94 launchd\n\nSo process 1 is launched by system startup, and anything with the parent process of 1 comes from the system daemons. Anything (in this case) with a parent process of 257 is being launched from one of the LaunchAgents or LoginItems.\nBear in mind that the name of the launch daemon or startup item doesn't necessarily have 'mysql' in the title - it could have been run by a different program or login item (so simply searching for it by name might not find it). Once you've found what has launched it, you may be able to find out where it came from.\n", "Q: Open-Xchange internet bookmark appeared on Homescreen After I had installed iOS 7 in September, an icon appeared on my home screen for \"Open-Xchange\".

I'm behind a rather terrible proxy with no such thing as FTP proxying. Unfortunately the formula for Alpine requires I retrieve a package from an FTP server.\nI can grab the file by other means and get it on my local system, but I need to know how to tell Homebrew to use the specified package instead of trying to download it on its own.\nIs this possible?\nMy usual workaround of running brew install inside of tsocks fails for some inadequately defined reason (just fails to connect exactly as if I hadn't tried it.. yet I can wget the file with tsocks just fine.\n\nA: After some digging, I stumbled upon the fact that you can find the exact filename that Homebrew is looking for, download the file, and place it file into /Library/Caches/Homebrew, and try the install again. brew will then notice that the file has already been downloaded and continue following the recipe.\n\nA: It is my understanding the whole idea behind Homebrew is the \"recipe\" or script that tells it how to install the program you are downloading and all its dependencies. \nSo, with that concept you would have to edit the install script (and maybe make file?) to tell Alpine to look locally for this dependent file instead of trying to download it by FTP.\n", "Q: TimeMachine inconsistant with backed up data.

All of it. backup folders back to Nov 22 2012 with the most recent being just 5 minutes old … \nAnd still, when I launch TimeMachine all I can access is the latest backup.\n\nA: I think you can actually go in and get the files you are looking for without using Time Machine per se. Just open the .dmg file and navigate to the files you want and copy them elsewhere. \n\nA: If you press the option key when clicking the time machine icon in the menu bar, you should have the chance to browse \"other\" backup disks.  Check if your older backups are on one of them. \n", "Q: Bookmarks syncing between 2 machines in Google Chrome after Time Machine Migration I migrated from one Mac to another via Time Machine. So, I get a full copy of my system. \nNow I'm using both of this Mac's. In Chrome logged-in by Google account and set up bookmarks synchronisation.\nBut in bookmarks bar I see all devices except my second mac. Probably Chrome somehow not recognise, that it the other Mac. \nI tried delete app, but it doesn't help.\nWho knows how to get around this problem?\n\nUPD:\nAt first time both computers have the same name. \nBut after renaming problems remained.\n\nA: Then my only thought remaining is that by doing a direct transfer of all files that there is a special chrome ID/profile that gets created when the app opens the first time. If that file gets copied then both computer have the same profile. You might have to export the bookmarks in chrome on one computer an then delete the ~/Library/Application Support/Chrome folder and then ~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist file in Preferences. Relaunch Chrome and that should force an ID/profile creation and then you could sync again.\n\nA: In a nutshell it caused by Chrome don't do any checks \"is it new computer or not\".\nSo, you should do 2 steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename new mac to unique name. (Preferences -> Sharing -> Computer Name)\n\n*Delete Chrome data file on new computer.\nFor me (on 10.9.2) this command works well:\nrm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Google/Chrome\nBe careful if your important data (history, passwords, bookmarks) not stored in google account.\nSince all my user-sensentive data stored in google account it's safety.\n", "Q: Weird spam message overlay appears on my iPhone's screen (FLASH SMS) This weird message keeps appearing every few days and it's very irritating. It always contains spam messages that asks me to accept or cancel invitations to random services (weekly jokes, pics etc). From googling, I believe this is some sort of Flash SMS:\n\nCan someone explain if this is caused by an app or forced through the service provider as I would like to know how to disable these permanently.\n\nA: Chances are your phone number was used by someone (else, or had belonged to someone before it got cycled to you) and they had subscribed to those services. If your phone bill is clean meaning there are no odd fees showing up out of the blue then I doubt it is an app.\nMy personal experience. I once installed an App on my iPhone and like a dumb idiot in a rush to get to work I loaded and accepted the usage terms (why would I read 45 pages).... well shortly there after I was getting billed an extra 20 Euros a month. Had to change my contract with my provider.\nAnother story, I was recently overseas and needed a prepaid SIM for my phone. I put it in and everything seemed fine until I was getting random SMS with jokes, weather, and sports that I didn't need nor had personally subscribed too. But the person who had my phone number before me had subscribed.\nBest thing to do is contact your provider in any case and see if they can block the attempts on their side so that you don't get harassed anymore. Sorry to hear of your woes.\n", "Q: How to open Google Drive links directly in Google Drive app Is there a way to do this?\nCurrently, the GDrive links I click in my emails open in Safari.\nIs this currently a limitation of the app (or iOS 7)? Is there a configuration I can change?\n\nA: Apparently you can prepend the url with the respective Google app to which it belongs. So if it is a Google Sheet, prepend the url with Googlesheets://. If it is a doc, I'm guessing you would use Googledocs://\nSo if the url is http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/Google-document/, amend it with the appropriate app prefix (in this case Googlesheets:// like so: Googlesheets://http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/Google-document.\nPS: The issue is discussed at length here.\n\nA: If you open the links in the Gmail app for iOS, and you have the necessary Google Drive app installed (Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and/or Google Slides), Gmail will by default open the links in a Google Drive app. You can enable or disable that feature in Gmail through Menu > Settings > Google Apps.\nAlternatively (though it's less direct), you can paste the link into Chrome for iOS, and there will be a bar at the top of the page to open the link in a GDrive app.\n", "Q: How can I set a link to my gym so that siri can find it I want to set a reminder like \"remember me to change dress when I am at the gym\".\nSiri answers \"I do not know your gym.

Using a custom label did not work, nor when I used the label \"others\".\nSiri works fine when i say \"remember me to ... when i am at Jane Doe\". \n\nA: Create a contact entry for your gym with phone number, website, and address. You can put the name of the gym in the company field and then you can create a nickname that just says \"Gym\"... problem is that Gym and Jim sound alike. \nWhat I now tried was setting up a new address to my person vCard with a custom tag. I have gym now as a customer address on my card and why I say \"Get to directions to gym\" it worked. \n\nWith having the gym as a separate contact entry, does it work when you say the Gym's name?\n", "Q: iMovie tutorial or video? Can you recommend a good site with some online training for the latest iMovie on OS X? I have tried to play with iMovie over the years and I never seem to 'get' how it is meant to be used.\nRight now I have about 1.5 hours of raw video taken with my iPhone 5s of a set of student presentation and I (naively) wanted to make a short 'highlight real' of it. But once I import the video into iMovie I am not sure how to use its features.\n(Note that I am very proficient on my mac in every other respect, software development, html, photoshop, illustrator, all those I manage just fine, but iMovie is so confusing.

(Source (under \"Graphics and Video Support\")).\nIf you are talking about the Retina version, then it can also go up to 2560 x 1600 pixels, but up to two displays. (Source (under \"Graphics and Video Support\"))\nConclusion: you should still be able to use the display in question, but your Mac will only let your monitor go up to 2560 x 1600.\n\nA: This program allows to list all supported resolutions and switch to highest one http://specialmeaning.blogspot.com/2016/07/yes-apple-i-did-it.html\n", "Q: Mission Control behaving differently with monitor plugged in On OSX 10.9 (maybe other versions, too), I've noticed that the icons for the different spaces in Mission Control behave differently whether or not I have a monitor plugged in.\nWith a monitor plugged in, the label is always there and there is no magnification effect on hover.\nWithout a monitor, the labels are only there on hover and there's a magnification effect reminiscent of the dock.\nDo you know if there's a way to make it always act like it does when there's a monitor plugged in?\n\nA: This is due to the differing amount of spaces shown in Mission Control, and both situations can be re-created with independently of the quantity of displays.\n\nWhen you have a small number of spaces, it shows like this:\n\nWhen you have lots of spaces, it shows like this:\n\nThis is not due to the number of displays you have connected but rather simply the number of spaces you have open.\nTo recreate…\n\n\n*\n\n*You can make it act like the first example by having a small number of spaces, and it will use the default size and show the name of the space.\n\n*You can make it act like the second example by having a lot of open spaces, and it will reduce the size of the space thumbnails to fit them on, and hide the space name if necessary.\n\n", "Q: Can I design web graphics with Pages more easily? I need to assemble a couple of individual pictures together, plus some nice text, and the result has to be a PNG of a certain pixel size.\nI'm not a web-designer, so, I don't have any specialised software, and since I need to do this like once or twice a year, it probably won't be worthwhile to buy and learn how to use Photoshop or some such.\nI've been (mis)using Apple Pages for these kinds of tasks, which generally works great, except for this pixel requirement for this specific task of a web-graphic.\n\nWhat I found that works is:\n\n\n*\n\n*design the document in Pages, with cm as the measurement system, and using a calculator to ensure proportions\n\n*use the Fit Width zoom option, and resize the window next to a pixel screen ruler\n\n*use ⇧⌘4 to take a screenshot of a portion of the screen (usually of the whole window, e.g. with a space and a button click)\n\n*use Preview to cut an exact PNG of needed size from the above screenshot\n\n*if size is off, repeat the last three steps\n\n\nIs there a way to reduce the above steps, and make the process somewhat less ad-hoc?  I've originally started with exporting from Pages into PDF, and then doing the resize magic with PDF, where I still had to take the screenshot of it before going further, but then realised it was an extra step that was not necessary.\n\nA: As Pages was not really developed with producing pixel-based graphics in mind, I think you workflow is already quite the best way to handle such a task in Pages (+Preview).\nHowever, if you have Pages, you may also have Keynote? Your task could be accomplished with this app much easier.\n\n\n*\n\n*Slideshows are set up in pixels, not cm.\n\n*After creating a new slideshow by selecting one of the predefined sizes, these can also be completely changed to custom sizes (info window, first tab).\n\n*After finishing your artwork, you can directly export into several image formats like JPG and PNG. You can even resize the image during this step (again).\n\n\n(Tested right now with Keynote 5.3)\n", "Q: iOS (iPad / iPhone) \"screen burn\" My device isn't broken. I confirmed this on many iPad 2 and iPad 3 I have access to, both with iOS 6 and 7. But I can't reproduce it at will.\nThere is something that triggers it. And then it becomes easy to reproduce. Just leave the home screen on for long enough (make it 10 minutes) and lock the phone (so you'll be sure to notice the effect). You'll see the dock bar icons are still slightly \"burned\" in the screen. Here's the best photo I could take so far (since I decided to pursue this):\n\nSee the safari icon slightly burned there, in the center? It can get much worse. I've added a reference as what the icon originally looks like, rotated 90 degrees in that image.\nSo, question here is: Can anyone else reproduce this? Is this really an apple issue? Did this happened in previous iOS versions? I never seem it in any android device.\nObviously it isn't the same hardware issue as the original screen burns, but it's so weird that if it wasn't stand still in the same screen place even after rotating the screen, I would suspect it could be some odd software / firmware bug.\n\nA: I can't reproduce it, I can however tell you that it's a pretty common problem.\nI've had the same thing happen on my Retina MacBook Pro. Rumor has it that it's especially common on displays manufactured by LG.\n", "Q: Does factory reset notify me of device removal on Find My iPhone? I have just got my iPhone stolen today. I live in fairly safe neighborhood but I got unlucky. Now, I have searched this question on internet for a fair amount of time now. Making a rookie mistake, I have not put a passcode on the device.\nMy question is, if the device is reset from the Settings, do I get notified that a device has been removed?\nThe device is running iOS 7.0.4. Lost mode was activated and the device is now offline.\n\nA: The device can't be removed from Find my iPhone by resetting it. Furthermore, you can and probably should set the device to lost mode if you want to put a PIN on it and lock the device with a helpful message to contact you for the eventual return of the device. If you really just want the device wiped, then you can erase it, knowing that still it will show your lost message:\n\nWith iOS 7, Find My iPhone can continue to display your custom message, even after your device has been erased. \n\nWhen you press the Reset button in Settings, it asks for your Apple ID, and will only reset the device when it's been entered.\nAttempting to turn off Find my iPhone through iCloud settings will prompt for your Apple ID.\nIf the device is factory reset when powered off through iTunes, it will still require activation using your Apple ID.\nPutting the device in lost mode is probably better since eventually the thief will decide to return it once they realize whomever they sell or give it to will keep getting reminded that the device was lost and should be returned to you.\n\nA: The find my iPhone app will let you know when the device has been removed from your device list. However, if your phone has been stolen and reset without a password by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the iPhone by holding the sleep/wake button at the top right of the device and the home button at the bottom center of the face at the same time.\n\n*Hold them both until you see the screen go black.\n\n*Wait until the white Apple logo appears.\nYou are most likely not going to find your phone. So the thief is thus not entitled to returning the phone to its owner. This is a flaw for the device.\n", "Q: Dual Monitor support without external video card I'm thinking about buying a MBP Retina 13\".\nNow I want to work at home on 2 Monitors, so the MBP will be somewhere under the table.\nIs it possible to connect first Monitor via HDMI and the other one via Thunderbolt/MiniDP Adapter to DVI.\n\nA: I believe so.\nSee this MacRumors forum post for a user with a similar need.\nSadly, I don't have a 13\" Retina MacBook to test with.\n", "Q: Will upgrading to Mavericks break my Macports? I have a late 2010 Macbook Pro 15\", running 10.7.5, with a configured dev environment, containing tons of installed ports (specifically Apache/PHP5.4/MySQL/Mongo/Node etc).\nApparently, the only way to update XCode further is to upgrade to Mavericks. Can anyone tell me how painful would the upgrade be in terms of needing to reinstall/reconfigure all the ports? Would I have to start from scratch, or will my current configuration be preserved?\n\nA: Macports provides a guide to migration to a new OS.\nBasically you need to uninstall all the ports, install a new Macports and Xcode (although only the command line tools are needed for most ports), then reinstall the ports. If you don;t do this then you might well have issues which Macports community can't help you with.\nIf you put your configurations in new files rather than directly edit files installed by macports these files will not be overwritten. If you directly edited the config files then you will need to copy them from a backup after the reinstall.\nNote on the upgrade. Xcode does not provide a gcc compiler for OSX 10.9 and Macports is now using the corresponding C++ standard library. This means that any C++ based port could well have problems if you just kept your old Macports and did not go through the migration. I suspect that other code is likely to carry on running but when you upgrade a port or add a new one things will get confused.\n\nA: I'm not sure about moving from 10.7 to 10.9 but my usage of MacPorts weren't \"disrupted\" by an upgrade from 10.8 to 10.9 (Same from 10.7 to 10.8).\nThough, I imagine that it might depend on which ports specifically you've got installed.\nIf you want to be extra, extra safe (which you should), simply use Time Machine before doing the upgrade and if all else fails, simply do a restore to 10.7.  \n", "Q: Adding an airport extreme base station so I can connect an aftermarket backup disk to the network to be used by Time Machine. We have our home network connected through an ATT uverse router.  I want to add an airport extreme base station so I can connect an aftermarket backup disk to the network to be used by Time Machine. What is the best way to hook up the airport extreme so it is always available to Time Machine?\n\nA: From what I understand uverse needs their router used instead of any other. So I think you will have to put the AEBS into bridge mode and not have it working as a router. It should still serve up the hard drive as a time capsule, it just won't be doing the DHCP or DNS work for your network. The uverse router will be fulfilling that role. \n", "Q: Can I install Mavericks if I upgrade my RAM? I have an early 2008 MacBook with 2GB of RAM and I would like to install OS X Mavericks onto it. However, I am not able to install the OS due to the age of my computer. If I upgrade my computer's RAM (to at least 4GB), will I then be able to upgrade to Mavericks?\n\nA: Short answer....No\nIf your system is unsupported then you cannot install Mavericks no matter how much memory you have. The problem is with the EFI not the memory.  \n", "Q: Remote Desktop Client perpetual update in App Store The App Store icon in my Dock always has a little \"1\" badge on it indicating that 1 app is available for update. That 1 app is \"Remote Desktop Client Update 3.7.1\" via \"Software Update.\"\nHowever, when I click either \"Update\" or \"Update All,\" it seems to update, but the \"1\" badge doesn't go away and the App Store perpetually shows that the Remote Desktop Client is always available for update. FYI: I have two Macs and this problem happens on only one of them.\nWhy is this the case?

After re-running the App Store app, it now no longer shows ARDC needing to be updated.\n", "Q: Stuck on finishing import (from external hard drive to computer hard drive) I started the process of importing my iPhoto library from an external hard drive to my Mac with a newly replaced hard drive.  I have roughly 180,000 photos and it looked like it was uploading all day.  Now it seems to be stuck on \"finishing import\".  Do I just wait?  Is this a lengthily process, too, or is it really just stuck?\n\nA: If you are not sure if the process is actually doing something or just stuck, you can get an idea from the following\nActivity Monitor\n/Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app \n\n\n*\n\n*See if the process is frozen. In that case activity monitor should\nshow the process/App (iPhoto in your case) in red color. If it is\nred, there is a high probability that the app is \"hung\".  \n\n*See if the process is actually doing something on the CPU or Hard Drive.\n\n\nIf you see something going on there, it is highly possible that it is still doing something. \nIf you don't see anything, you may want to check Console:  \nConsole.app\n/Applications/Utilities/Console.app\nConsole shows error messages that the app may have generated to give some idea on what is happening.\nNote that both these are indicative and may not be 100% accurate. In the worst case you may have to import again (I would search Google for any issues with importing large iPhoto libraries before trying again)\nThis is a snapshot of my activity monitor, I have selected QuickSilver and it shows 59.0 MB Bytes Read and 27.6 MB under Bytes Written. This data is dynamically refreshed so you can get a fair idea of the disk usage of an app. The same for CPU. Memory may not be a very good indicator though, even if an app has frozen it may still use memory.\n\n\nA: I found this post because my large Photos import appeared to be stalled too. The Activity Monitor is a good way to at least see that Photos was doing something. But it's a bit frustrating not being able to see why it's stopped at one specific file and that there's no telling how much time it will take - there's just no basic way of seeing the problem.\nI closed all other apps and processes and let my iMac chew through it for about two hours. When I came back there was an error window that said it couldn't import 16 specific files, which all turned out to be .pdf file types.\nSo I think the lesson here is to verify the only file types that are being imported are acceptable formats.\n", "Q: No sound on videos I dropped my iphone3 in the water I turned the power off, and dried it in rice for 3 days slowly almost everything became functional again except I have no sound when I watch videos.\n\nA: It's entirely likely the water has permanently damaged the circuitry, but you might power it off and set it on a shelf for a week to ensure it has dried completely. \nAlso, you can test sound with headphones to see if it is just the speaker. \n", "Q: nfs and nfsd are not available in Mavericks I find that there is no nfs and nfsd available on Mavericks.

I tried to change my password, but when I did, and tried the new password, it still doesn't work. \nWhat should I do? \nI obviously can't even use my phone to make a call.\n\nA: Try connecting via https://appleid.apple.com/ probably something wrong with your password.\nConsider once you have access to the page to check your contact information, add a secondary e-mail etc…\nIf you still experience problems you should contact an Apple adviser via http://support.apple.com/\n", "Q: How many files in a folder is too many? Many years ago I vaguely recall that the Finder in Mac OS X would start having problems if a folder contained 2,000 - 3,000 items or more.\nApple doc says that the HFS Plus file system has a theoretical limit of a 2 billion files per folder all Mac OS X versions.\nWhat is the practical limit?\nWill having 10,000 photos in a folder be a problem?\n\nA: You can easily try this yourself by running the following in Terminal\nmkdir ~/t\ncd ~/t\ndd if=/dev/random of=test bs=1024 count=16\nfor i in {1..10000}; do cp test test.$i; done\n\nto create a folder containing 10'000 files with 16kB each (replace the 16 in the third line with another number for differently sized files).\n\nA: Seems that around 10,000 is safe.  However, I've found that if you go a lot higher like 50,000 Finder will never even list the files in the directory when you try to browse it.  I suspect this is why a lot of data recovery software will create a new folder every 10,000 files if you're doing file carving in RAW.\n\nA: Answering considering a practical example: I have now 326.000 files in a folder, created by an application that download bits from a server. The files are zipped XML files, and my application extracts XML data from it and store it on a local database. \nThe application runs from the command line. Everything works fine without any issue but rm * or ls * does not work due to the expansion of the wildcard (error message Argument list too long). Since the files are stored in a temporary folder I can just remove the folder after processing the files.\nI didn't try to open the folder with Finder, though. I suspect that could be very slow if possible at all.\n\nA: There are several limits to consider that have been touched upon by some of the comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*argument length and shell expansion - a simple echo * will bail if the concatenated length of filenames the asterisk expands to hits upon that limit. If running into this snare, often find will be your friend. \nfind . -depth 1 -type f | exec echo {} \\;\nwould be a working replacement for the innocent echo * mentioned above, limited to listing files only. (echo to be replaced with the action of your choice)\n\n*per-program limits to the size of internal data structures used to hold directory contents (finder, all kinds of tools trying to read directory listings).\n\n*directory lookup cache size. While the filesystem may be able to hold 2.1 billion files within the on-disk structure of a directory, it won't be pleasant to work with that number, and you'd be well advised to introduce some strategy of sorting files into subdirectories if you're dealing in structures of that size. (Hint: those people designing web caching structures did have to deal with that - see Maltzahn/Richardson, Reducing the Disk I/O of Web Proxy Server Caches, Usenix 1999.\nTo speed up access to frequently used disk structures, file systems are using (memory) cache, and the size of these caches is limited. This is where the sudden penalty for large and less-than-optimal structured directorie starts to hit. Depending on the frequency and intensity of access to these directories, the penalty can be significant.\nThe 2015 article by Tsai et al., How to get more value from your file system directory cache would probably be one of the easier introductions to the subject.\n\nA: Apple has a support document related to that:\n\nMaximum number of files (or files and folders) in a folder (all Mac OS X versions)\nUp to 2.1 billion (2)\n\n", "Q: Gray Bar in fullscreen mode multidisplay OSX mavericks added support for having the menu bar available in multidisplay mode, which is nice, but now whenever I try to watch a movie in fullscreen on the other display it seemingly leaves a solid grey bar at the top of the screen which is very annoying. Has anyone had this experience and does anyone know how to get rid of it.\n\nA: There's a solution that I've found which should solve this issue with any application that you encounter this with. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download the free application Nocturne\n\n*Install, launch, and click the icon in the menubar\n\n*Select Preferences > then check Dim when inactive \n\n*Adjust the slider all the way down when desired \n\n*Enjoy! :)\n\n\n\n\nI've been using this application for ages, and without a doubt it's\n  one of my favorites.\n\n\nA: Yes, I have experience with this. Mostly in non-Apple browsers (Chrome). The comments help with stand-alone video players but if you're using a browser in combination with a plugin like Flash or Silverlight, it seems that the browser doesn't take multi-menu bars into account and thus a menu bar size grey/black bar is left at the top.\nIf you on the other hand use Safari with these same plugins, you'll get \"full\" fullscreen.\nCurrently I only watch fullscreen Netflix via Safari.\nI believe it's up to the developers of the specific application to fix this issue. Until then, you'll have to use specific applications, or, as the comments suggest, change the fullscreen mode in VLC.\n", "Q: A screen protector or not for the retina screen? Recently, I bought my very first MacBook Pro with Retina Display.\nI am hesitating between having a screen protector or not.\nSome claim that a protector can prevent the retina display from scratch, while others say that one can only get the best out of the retina display without any extra protection.\nIs such a protector worthwhile?\nWill the screen get scratched when I use a cloth to clean it, if I do not have the protector?\n\nA: The points raised are both correct. While having the protector will prevent scratches on the screen, it will also reduce the quality of the display quite significantly. When I bought my Mac, I was also met with this dilemma. After having tried the best screen protector that the Apple Store had, I decided not to go with one. The display doesn't really scratch all that much, and I have not been able to induce a scratch even after using a cheap cloth. \nI would suggest you to use a screen cleaning liquid every time you use a cloth, as that is how I have been able to prevent the scratches.\n\nA: Don't! I have a screen protector on that's impossible to get off. Tried suction with vacuum and screen was coming off. I saw videos where adhesive was so strong that it pulled off polarizer along with the screen protector. I have to live with this protector now and won't be able to see the actual screen's beauty. Sad! Never apply screen protector on a laptop. They are really not required.\n\nA: Screens of the current models and nearly all modern MacBooks / MBPs are covered with a sheet of glass.  Your not going to scratch it while wiping it with a clean cloth.  Where previous models, primarily the ones that came with the anti-glare displays where much more susceptible to scratching.  If this were an iPhone or an iPad I would consider a screen protector, but on a Macbook the only time the screen is vulnerable to damage is while your working on it, I don't expect you will store it in a bag etc, while open.\n\nA: I always think your better off with a screen protector. I have a screen protector on mine and I'm not dying over the difference. Do your research, invest the money and get quality stuff. If you get a cheap one then you'll dramatically reduce the display. Spend some good money and you won't have to give up performance for protection. Or scratch your display and replace it vs replacing a 40$ screen protector. Doesn't matter how easy or hard it is to scratch the display. Bottom line is... it can be done so prevent it.\n\nA: One year after buying a brand new MacBook Pro pro I got a small scratch in the centre of the screen - it was like scratching sunglasses right in the centre - was super annoying - luckily the Apple Store agreed to replace the Retina display at no cost - I then got a cheap screen guard since then - you cannot tell the difference.\nBut I have just bought a 2018 MacBook Pro and I've installed 2x screen guards and both give some sort of vertical strobing effect - not sure why it's happening - it's annoying - I'll keep it on till I find one that doesn't strobe.\n\nA: I think that there has to be some degradation of the retina display when you use any screen protector. That did not prevent me from using one on my iPad 4 with the retina display - because I do use one. I prefer having the protection for my screen to the very slight loss of quality that the screen protector may cause. But Providing its of a good quality i would leave it on. The amount of people I've come across both with phones and tablets how have put a small scratch on the screen and to my surprise they have done it using a good quality cleaning cloth that has had a small speck of grit or something like that have left them with a small scratch.\n\nA: WARNING!! I used to usually clean with liquid but after 2 years my display got staingate problem and later I found out apple actually suggest to use only their cloth to clean \n\nA: The Moshi protector: don't buy!\nI removed the Moshi after 5 years and screen got irrepairable damaged. Staingate all over the screen.\n\nA: No .Macbooks or even ipad when protected in a case do not require screen protectors. I have my ipad with retina naked for 2 yrs straight without developing a single scratch.But it also depends on how much care u take of your device.\n\nA: Why not? I think it's better to be safe than sorry a screen protector of good quality is a safeguard and believe me the moshI protector is awesome expensive but awesome do not get a cheap one that leaves tonnes of bubbles moshI is the only protector I'd use or nothing at all ,but if you care for your Mac retina than you shouldn't have an issue for scratches in the first place ,never wip before blowing the dust 2, liquid screen cleaner and 3 a very soft screen cloth that's used for camera lenses then I'd say you don't need a screen protector if you follow those steps .cheers.pick your poison and you don't lose quality of the retina that's noticeable that's well over exaggerated trust me the quality is the same.\n", "Q: How can I download iCloud app data to PC? I have app data in iCloud. I would like to download it to a PC laptop. Specifically this is the Audio Memos app, and I would like to save the recordings to computer and delete them from iCloud.

There is no Apple's own repair service where I live, and I'm fairly savvy with electronics to do my own repairs. \nHow can I identify batteries for sale that are either genuine Apple parts or determine if alternative replacement batteries they are at least equal, but preferably better than, the original MacBook Air battery I have. \nBy \"equal or better\" I mean that it lasts at least as many cycles. I.e. after equal number of charges, it keeps Macbook running roughly as long as the genuine battery on a single charge, given the equal load.\n\nA: (this answer was written for the previous edition of the question)\n\nI didn't find any \"most robust and lasting\" choice yet, but I contacted iFixit re their replacement battery, and this is what I found out.\n\n\n*\n\n*They claim that they sell the battery:\n\n\n*\n\n*manufactured by the same company that manufactures Apple's battery\n\n*its initial power-on time on a single charge is better compared to the original battery: \"buying a brand new battery will get you back to where your computer was [in same time between charges] when you first bought it\"\n\n*there's 6-month warranty for a case if it performs poorly at customer's computer\n\n\n*However:\n\n\n*\n\n*I failed to get any comment on how it can be possible that Apple allows its manufacturer to sell parts that Apple itself doesn't normally sell (which is the case for MBA-2011 batteries)\n\n*the sales rep couldn't provide any tests proving the \"with better life\" statement, nor even confirm that such tests were ever performed: \"Unfortunately I do not have any tests to show [better life / better time between charges] as we have found those to not be needed\"\n\n*could not confirm that any part of these statements are true:\n\n\n*\n\n*the replacement will last comparable number of recharge cycles as the battery installed by an official Apple service\n\n*the replacement's poweron time on a single charge will be the same (or ideally better) than how could original battery installed by Apple service perform, at (most) every point in the battery life\n\n\n\n\nThe above data doesn't exclude what I experienced with low-quality third-party batteries for non-Apple products: initially they start with unprecedented time on a single charge, but after few months time on a charge deteriorates to less than an hour.\nBut let's see what answers a question on performance of iFixit batteries will bring.\n\nA: I purchased a replacement battery on Amazon for my MacbookPro8,2 (A1286) for $70 two years ago (this was not the cheapest, but had a 1 year warranty). It is now down to 50% duty cycle and shows \"replace battery\" in the status. \nThe original Apple battery was down to 20% after about 250 pretty full cycles, in less than 2 years. \nSo for less than 1/2 the Apple battery price I ended up with a battery lasting somewhat longer. I have noticed that there are sellers on Amazon claiming use of A-grade Sony cells, and an 18 month \"hassle free\" warranty for approx. $50. \nMy experience is that the no-name, mid-priced batteries on Amazon are perhaps at least as good as the Apple battery. FYI I have a 2012 13\" that is still going strong and has the Apple battery, 200 cycles.\n\nA: I am currently recommending batteries from OWC (One World Computing)\n\nhttp://eshop.macsales.com/shop/powerbook/batteries/\n\nand from FastMac\n\nhttp://fastmac.com\n\n\nA: Yea, I had to replace mine and, after some extensive research, I also ended up going with the other world computing folks. So far, I've had no troubles at all w/ the replacement. I had bought external storage from them in the past so that swayed me a bit to them, however so far my experience with them has been great at the battery is working solid in my laptop.\n", "Q: Is it possible to restore songs from an iPod to iTunes? I have a 160 GB iPod Classic and a Windows 7 desktop with iTunes containing roughly about 13,000 songs. My external hard drive containing all the songs crashed but I managed as long as all the songs' file names were in iTunes and when the iPod syncronised with iTunes, the songs remained on the iPod. Recently I had my computer reinstalled and iTunes was formatted and wiped clean, now if I sync my iPod I know my iPod will be wiped clean as well.\nSo is it possible to recover songs which are there — on the iPod — but not in iTunes or the desktop?\n\nA: There is no end to the people that will offer to sell you some software to do this.\nHere is a long list:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3991\nThere should be several free ways to do this including this one:\nhttp://download.cnet.com/PhoneTrans/3000-18553_4-75736709.html\nMany advertising free downloads but are crippled and will only allow a few songs at a time.\nI don't use windows so I cannot recommend one or the other but I would not pay for something you can find for free if you just look a little bit.\nGood Luck\n\nA: Yes it is possible to transfer you audio/video files from your iPod to your Desktop. If you follow this guide you should be fine.\n\nStep 1: Download and install  iPod to computer transfer. Your iPod should be detected automatically.\nStep 2: Choose the list and files you want to transfer, click the Start Transfer button.\nStep 3: After clicking the Start Transfer button, a window will pop up. You can choose, whether you want to transfer your audio/video files directly to iTunes or to a folder on your disk. (If you want the files transferred to a folder, make sure you set it in Settings before starting the transfer)\n\nHope this helps...Good luck!\n", "Q: Apple Mail Client without “All Mail” folder For a long time I had Apple Mail connected to my gmail account without without the \"All Mail\" folder.\nAfter adding a second account I noticed that mails sent to myself skip the inbox because I had an \"All Mail\" folder. So now the question rises:\nWill I break something by disabling the \"All Mail\" IMAP folder (within Gmail settings)?\nOn my iOS devices I noticed that my mail had \"Delete\", but after an update it had \"Archive\", and after updating again \"Delete\". I though the pattern was that odd minor releases delete mail, and even minor releases archive mail... but now I am getting concerned and want to get my settings right.\nNow more seriously. I thought that mail clients did not need to know how Gmail deletes mail since any IMAP delete request just deleted mail from one folder, but never from the server. So in theory, I expected to be OK without the \"All Mail\" folder.\n\nA: In the GMAIL settings, it says show or not the All Mail folder in IMAP:\n\nSo, it is your choice to show the All Mail folder on your computer or not.\nThere is nothing to break by choosing which folders will show on your computer from mama google's web email.\nThe All Mail folder is a feature of the Gmail, not your email program. So if you do not want to see it locally then disable it. Also All mail is just a bucket where a duplicate from all other folders reside for easy search. It is not real folder, just a collection of emails from other folders.\n", "Q: Podcast ep on iphone 5s will not delete I've moved to the UK and just got a new 5s phone and restored it from my old settings on my US iphone 5. One glitch I've noticed seems to be w/ iTunes music or podcasts showing up on the phone in songs when I didn't move them to the phone. I had 3 on there I didn't want. 2 deleted fine, just like any of the individual songs can delete. 1 podcast ep will not. I hold my finger down on it and slide to the left and no red delete option will show, but it will on any other song. I go to the ep, click the red lines in the top right corner to get me to the individual song again and while other songs will delete that way as well, this again will not. The red delete rectangle won't show. I hook it up to my mac and verify no podcasts are synced. The category is greyed out. The artist is not checked under artists, the individual ep is not checked, it's not in a playlist I've synced nor is it in genre I've synced. This is a complete mystery how this is still on the phone at all. It plays no problem, but I want it deleted off the phone entirely. I've turned the damn thing off/on a few times. How do I remove this? What's going on?\n\nA: Go to the settings app on iOS. Check podcasts and be sure to disable sync there. At that point a local delete should work properly. \n", "Q: YouTube videos don't work despite installing Flash Player I just bought a new MacBook Pro with Retina display and I went to youtube.com in Safari to play a video, but the videos required Adobe Flash.\nI downloaded Flash Player and installed it, but the videos still don't work. What can I do?\n\nA: You need to remove Youtube's HTML5 trial in order for the flash player to work and remember your preferences.\nFirst join the trial, and then leave it. Leaving the trial is the only way to force YouTube to remember you want the videos played in Flash, but of course to do that you have to join the trial first. It fixed the issue for me.\nHere's the link:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/html5\n\nIf all else fails, try using other browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox etc.)\n", "Q: How to resize the widgets in the dashboard? I wish to enlarge the widgets in my dashboard, because I find it quite uncomfortable to see the contents of the dictionary widget in that small box.\nIs it possible to do that?\n\nA: It is currently not possible to resize Dashboard widgets yourself.\nHowever, the developer of the widget can make their widget resizable. This Apple Developer Documentation page describes the process by which developers can make their widget resizable, however it is uncommon for a widget to be made resizable:\n\nTry to limit using live-resizing to cases where it is absolutely necessary. If your content can be shown in a fixed, simple user interface, do so.\n\n\nA: no unfortunately thats not possible, they are bounded to whatever size or shape they came in!\n\nA: No that's not true you can do it easily you just click on the background of the dashboard (the bit to the left of the trash bin works & it's often a double finger tap depending on how you set your trackpad up) then you choose dock preferences from the pop up box & move the magnification slider up :) \n", "Q: What are 'com.apple.access_ssh' and 'com.apple.access_screensharing'; can I delete them?

means your video card or motherboard is failing -- if your Mac is still under Apple Care warranty, you're set. If not, it'll cost you $$ to fix. Take it to an Apple store or Apple certified repair shop, as it's nothing you can fix yourself. Yes reboots will help temporarily but it will get progressively worse over time, in my experience. The good news is that your data is fine.\n", "Q: Numbers: How to change cell text conditionally? I am trying to change the text of a cell in Numbers 3 according to a condition.\nE.g. if A1-A2 is a negative value, the text shall be 'Negative'. If the value is positive the text shall be 'Positive'. Is there something like a function to accomplish this?\n\nA: You can do this with the IF function.

After a bit of investigation, I found it was due to the folder /Library/Server/Wiki/Database.xpg. It was created December 11 (4 days ago), and since then its disk usage has increased to 313GB.I think it may have been caused by me starting OS X Server for the first time, but I haven't used any of the functionality from it, and didn't even realize it had a wiki. In the Server services section the Wiki is turned off anyway.  \nThis is a huge problem, as it is still growing very fast. Based on the time machine backup (which unfortunately backed up the directory, wiping all of my backups older than August to fit it in), one day ago it was only 147GB in size. Next, my partition is \"only\" 1TB in size, and I'm down to 267GB spare. \nWhat actually created the folder, what is the correct way of deleting it, and how can I stop it from happening in the future?\nI'm running Mac OSX Mavericks 10.9.

I used AppCleaner as it automatically gets rids of all the server files for you. A standard \"drag to trash\" uninstall would probably also work but I wanted to be thorough.\nNot a very satisfactory solution to this, but it is better than nothing. If anyone else runs across this issue in the future, good luck with finding a better solution!\n\nA: I had same problem - several wiki backup files a minute. I found an article here (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4597188?start=45&tstart=0), that solved the problem to me. The third party software GoodSync (GoodSync connect) caused the problem. I had to GoodSync > GodSync > edit gs-server install (without really installing) and delete /Library/LaunchDaemons/theGoodSyncOne.\nAlmost no more wiki which I don't use backups anymore!\n\nA: I'm running OSX Mavericks:\nThis issues is caused because the archiving feature in postgres is turned on - I believe so the wiki can keep revision history of the pages.  However, I tried disabling it and this seems to avoid this issue of continuous backups.\nThe continual backup is caused by the malfunctioning of the apple python script.  Here's what worked for me until they fix their script - it allows the wiki to keep being used but stops the continual backups that fill up the disk.\nEdit /Library/Server/Wiki/Database.xpg/Cluster.pg/postgresql.conf\nand turn archive off:\narchive_mode = off              # allows archiving to be done\n                                # (change requires restart)\n\nOr you can figure out why the archive command is failing:\narchive_command = 'python /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/bin/xpostgres archive %p ../backup/%f'               # command to use to archive a logfile segment\n                                # placeholders: %p = path of file to archive\n\nSee: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/continuous-archiving.html for documentation on this \"feature\".\nAfter I made these changes, I stopped and restarted the server, then it seems it stopped adding new files to that directory.\n\nA: Possible workaround: turn the Wiki service on?\n\n\n*\n\n*I turned the Wiki service on.\n\n*I set it to \"only some users\".\n\n*I disabled WebDav.\n\n*I left it overnight.\n\n*I turned the service off.\n\n\nSo far no further backup files have been created.\n\nA: I hit upon this thread because I am investigating a related problem: user _teamsserver keeps spawning a shortlived python process that uses a lot of CPU resources. A month ago or so, I \"fixed\" this by deleting all server files and doing a clean install of the server. Tonight I noticed that watching something on bbci player caused the fan in macmini to become very loud. I checked and yes, the dreaded python process was back. \nHaving read David's experiences above, I decided to find the folder /Library/Server/Wiki/Database.xpg and delete it entirely. Within seconds my CPU usage dropped to normal levels (from around 10% to about 0.70 %) and my macmini is quiet again. I have no idea what is going on: like David, I am not using the wiki service at all.\n", "Q: Tiered list paragraph in Pages 5 I have a document converted from pages 09 and I am trying to achieve with Pages 5 something that I was able to do easily with older version.\nBasically I want a series of paragraphs structured like this, with no indentation, all aligned to left:\n1.Title (h1)\ntext following...\n1.1 title (h2)\ntext following...\n1.1.1 title (h3)\ntext following...\n1.1.2 title (h3)\ntext following...\n\nI have three main header style header 1, header 2 and header 3, represented above as h1,2,3.

I have managed to set up the sound from the native speakers, however, there is still no sound from the headphones. I have disabled automute in alsamixer, but this didn't help.

The data won't go through the Freebox unless an internet connection is required for this data to be sent.\n", "Q: Prevent Image Capture from opening when a memory card is inserted Every time I plug in a SD memory card, Image Capture launches, is there a way to disable this? I am running OS X Mavericks.\n\nA: Your Mac doesn't really know the difference between a Camera and the SD card. It treats them all pretty much the same. So, in the iPhoto Preferences you can select 'Do Nothing' when a camera is connected, and that will stop Image Capture launching.\niPhoto Menu -> Preferences -> General\n", "Q: How can I use aliases in the Go to Folder dialog?

In general I have incoming connections disabled by my security software (Little Snitch). But even when I do this, on public wifi, I see numerous incoming connections for netbios and mDNSResponder allowed automatically.\nFor example, at a recent hotel stay, I was confronted with a long list as soon as a logged on to the wifi there (listed as automatically allowed by Little Snitch)\n\nwhich quickly grew to the thousands\n\nWhat are these incoming connections for? Why are they being automatically allowed? Are they a security threat?\n\nNote that if I explicitly block all of these connections using Little Snitch, my network access fails, but the network still seems to function when I alternatively block incoming connections using Apple's (OS X 10.9) firewall\n\nand enable stealth mode\n\n\nA: netbios\nYou could block the netbios connections with Little Snitch. These connections are connections attempt most usually coming from Windows sharing the same Wi-Fi network and testing which share and printers are available on your computer. This protocol behaves like a guy entering a new building and testing all door knobs, when the door opens he asks: What's your name? What do you share? Do you print?\nThis protocol is stupid, and dangerous, but most notably for Windows.\nThis protocol is the leading vector of malware broadcast inside LAN of companies using Windows since more than 20 years (toward the floppies era). This protocol is responsible of the largest security damages within big companies.\nnetbios is a security threat.\nOn all my Mac I tear off this service (netbiosd), during the post installation procedure (see: …to disable WINS in Network settings, working on 10.7, 10.8, 10.9).\nmDNSResponder\nYou couldn't and shouldn't block the mDNSResponder because you would break the normal working of the DNS on your Mac. I.e. you won't be able to find the IP address of www.microsoft.com.\nmDNSREsponder isn't a security threat (today).\nFirewall setting\nYour method to block connection through the MacOS X firewall is the correct and safe one within any aggresive environment.\n\nA: I'm not sure how comfortable you are with the command line, but here goes.  netstat is a command which shows (among other things) the ports that are open.  So first I open Terminal (in Applications/Utilities) and then netstat to can see a list of established connections (22 in my case).  It tries to resolve the local and foreign addresses, so here I can see the browser connections to stackoverflow.com:\nvger.local:~(14)+>- /usr/sbin/netstat -a | fgrep stackoverflow\ntcp4       0      0  10.1.1.80.57905        stackoverflow.co.http  ESTABLISHED\ntcp4       0      0  10.1.1.80.57891        stackoverflow.co.http  ESTABLISHED\ntcp4       0      0  10.1.1.80.52015        stackoverflow.co.http  ESTABLISHED\nvger.local:~(15)+>- \n\n(fgrep is used here to filter the output to just those lines containing the string I am searching for.)  The 10.1.1.80 is the IP of my desktop and the number after it is the TCP port.  So now I can use lsof to see what program has that port open:\nvger.local:~(15)+>- /usr/sbin/lsof -i TCP:52015\nCOMMAND PID    USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nfirefox 631 pkearns   64u  IPv4 0x552e1c664da13fcb      0t0  TCP 10.1.1.80:52015->stackoverflow.com:http (ESTABLISHED)\nvger.local:~(16)+>-\n\nFirefox, no surprises there.  If you have the numbers of the ports (connections) being held open then you can use lsof to see what process/programme is holding them open.\n", "Q: I deleted iMovie by accident, how can I get it back? I accidentally deleted iMove from my MacBook Air. How can I get it back?\n\nA: If you've registered your iLife with the Mac App Store, you can find it in the Purchased tab.\n\nAlternatively, if you have a Time Machine backup or other backup of /Applications, you can restore the file through that.\n\nA: If you have Time Machine running you can retrieve it from a back up.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Time Machine icon in the menu bar and select Enter Time Machine from the menu\n\n*Once Time Machine loads press Cmd-Shift-G to open the Go to the folder: dialog box and enter /Applications in the dialog and press the Go button\n\n*While viewing the contents of the /Applications folder in Time Machine, Scroll backwards in time until a point before you deleted iMovie. You'll see it appear in the Finder window.\n\n*Right click on iMovie and select Restore \"iMovie.app\" to....\n\n*You'll be exited from Time Machine and OS X will ask you where you want to restore iMovie at on your machine. Select the /Applications folder and you'll have iMovie back.\n\n\nIf you don't have Time Machine running you can purchase iMove from the App Store for $15.00. The App Store may recognize that your account and machine already had iMovie and let you download it again without paying for it if you've registered your Mac and iLife suite of apps with the App Store. Check the Purchased tab in the App Store to see if it's available for re-installation.\n", "Q: Cycling backups with multiple Time Capsules? I am using Time Capsule for backing up my Mac at home and like this solution for its convenience (automatic hourly backups in the background, etc.). \nI would now like to add an off-site backup to the mix, with the intention of cycling backup media between on-site (used for backup) and off-site (sitting at a safe location) every week or so. (An online backup service is not an option.)\nCould I accomplish this by buying a second Time Capsule and just switching between the two (with Open Time Machine Preferences | Select Disk) to effect the cycling. Would this work and/or are there perhaps better (also cheaper) ways to do this?\n(I understand that Time Capsule has been designed to be kept running, so the device could perhaps suffer from being turned off/on relatively frequently, i.e. every other week. I also understand that some NAS support hot swapping, which sounds promising, but isn't really meant to support this scenario either. Creating a RAID 1 between the Time Capsule -- now to be kept on-site and one from a set of USB drives -- now to be cycled -- sounds elegant but is perhaps more complex than a backup solution ought to be?)\n\nA: Time Machine supports multiple drives since Mountain Lion: that should be sufficient to support the desired backup scenario (1 Time Capsule + 2 cycled USB drives).\n(Re answering own question: What can I say ... writing down a question often helps in finding the answer, and I've only recently upgraded from OS X 10.7.)\n", "Q: Is it possible to take a screenshot in vector format? Is it possible to make screenshots in vector format (SVG or PDF) instead of only in raster formats on OS X?\n\nA: Solution 1: Using a vector GUI widget API with PDF backend:\nActually, it is possible. Consider the fact that on screen objects are created by a widget API, and if this widget API is based on vector elements and have appropriate vector output backend, then it can output to vector formats like PDF.\nPlease look at the similar question, which also contains some working samples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I take a screenshot as vector graphics or at a higher resolution\nthan native?\nThis needs Gtk+ widget library and Cairo as its GUI display and PDF generation backend, which both are available for Mac OS X. But as few applications in Mac OS X use Gtk+, this is not a general solution. I wanted to show the possibility of creating vector screenshots. If you are a developer, this may be useful for you.\n\nSolution 2: Creating vector mockups:\nFor general applications, you can create mockups. Here you can find \"Free Yosemite Vector GUI for Illustrator\", which can be used to create mockups of your GUI. It includes all main UI Components:\nhttp://codemotionapps.com/yosemite-gui/\n\n\nA: No, since the screenshots are simply taken from the pixels shown on-screen or off-screen.\nHowever, the screenshots can be turned into vectors using software such as Adobe Illustrator, but the result won't be exact.\n\nA: If you're talking about webpages, you can use the Print to PDF feature of Safari and then open the PDF in a vector program. \nThis should make it easy to grab some SVG resources or to make a tutorial in a video editing program where you want to zoom in on some webpages without losing quality - for example.\n", "Q: Linking my mac to a monitor but my backlight has gone The back light on my mac screen has failed and I have the correct cables/connections to link to a monitor.

I have a 128GB SSD drive that was running out of space with only 10 GBs free. The largest single file on the filesysem was my 30+ GB Windows 7 virtual machine that I run in Parallels Desktop 7. I moved the file to an external USB drive (the virtual machine was not running during the move), and deleted the source file on my Mac's internal SSD. However, I did not reclaim the 30+ GBs of space. I reclaimed just a little over 1GB.\nI then ran df -h which shows the following:\nfilesystem                          Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk0s2                       112Gi  101Gi   11Gi    91% 26612595 2799773   90%   /\ndevfs                              190Ki  190Ki    0Bi   100%      656       0  100%   /dev\nmap -hosts                           0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /net\nmap auto_home                        0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /home\nlocalhost:/gLd8Xi-KfPSbPCbN1RG-Js  112Gi  112Gi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /Volumes/MobileBackups\n\nI then ran sudo lsof | grep -i deleted which shows the following:\nMicrosoft 1101         wesley  txt       REG                1,2      27324            15737160 /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Microsoft Outlook.app/Contents/Resources/navigation.DeletedItems@2x.tif\nMicrosoft 1101         wesley  txt       REG                1,2       4444              768068 /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Microsoft Outlook.app/Contents/Resources/navigation.DeletedItems.tif\n\n...okay so I've got some files marked for deletion, but they're certainly not tens of GBs and that still doesn't explain why after deleting a 30+ GB virtual machine image the space was not released.\nsudo du -sh /* shows the following:\n7.4G    /Applications\n 22G    /Library\n  0B    /Network\n4.7G    /System\n4.0K    /User Information\n 23G    /Users\n9.2G    /Volumes\n3.1M    /bin\n  0B    /cores\n4.5K    /dev\n4.0K    /etc\n1.0K    /home\n7.9M    /mach_kernel\n1.0K    /net\n286M    /opt\n9.6G    /private\n1.6M    /sbin\n4.0K    /tmp\n472M    /usr\n4.0K    /var\n\nAdded up, that's 76GB used, not the 101GB used that df shows.

It was a thin provisioned drive, but it was a real 30GBs of space. The drive was presented to Windows as an 70 GB drive, and after OS installation, application installation, and files it was 38GBs on the Mac's disk. In fact, I still have the file, just moved to my external hard drive, and can confirm that it is 38.61GB of actual storage on the host Mac, and inside of Windows it shows a roughly 70GB drive with a bit over 30GB's used.\nOld Time Machine Backups\nI was told that the file was still in /Volumes/MobileBackups as a local backup. I navigated to /Volumes/MobileBackups but the directory did not exist. No amount of sudoing and searching could find such a mount. This was done minutes after I first posted this question with no reboots or logouts in between.\nConcerning Time Machine's preference on this Mac, I have an External USB drive that I use for Time Machine backups. I looked within Time Machine where the Parallels VM had been located on the internal SSD weeks ago. I did see the VM in the Time Machine history. I clicked on the old VM file and chose to delete all of the instances of that file from Time Machine. Oddly, I checked some other days and the file was still in that directory. I ended up having to manually seek through each day and remove that file. A grand total of seven instances of that file were removed from Time machine before no day had any record of it on the SSD. I rebooted and there was no reclamation of space.\nLocal Time Machine Storage\nI then disabled local Time Machine storage with sudo tmutil disablelocal and rebooted. There was no reclamation of space.\nSo I'm still at square one. Somehow I managed to have 10 GBs of free space, delete a ~38GB file, and only have 11GB of free space afterward. I guess I'm special? =)\nEDIT 3\nI booted into recovery mode (Reboot and hold command + r), then entered disk utility. I checked the volume that was in my Mac and it reported some errors. I chose to \"Repair Disk\" and immediately after the repair, within Disk Utility, I saw that I had gained 36GBs of space! I rebooted into my system volume and the space remained reclaimed. Yay!\n\nA: It's likely in /Volumes/MobileBackups and you can easily delete it by entering Time Machine and navigating to the folder where the file existed. Select the file then command-click (right-click) and delete all backups of that file. \n\nNormally, the system information window shows the backup space, but I have seen this window get hung up and not properly report storage space when Spotlight and/or the disk catalog are wonky.\nYou can also wipe all local backups by disabling the local store:\n sudo tmutil disablelocal\n\nIf the above steps doesn't work, you'll want to boot into recovery mode and run Disk Utility to check that the directory structure and file system catalog are correct. A fsck -fy / in single user mode is also equivalent if you are so inclined to fix things from terminal or want to perform a safe boot and have the system clean things up systematically.\n\nA: On a MacBook, Time Machine actually takes 2 snapshots each hour.  The first one is stored locally, the second is what gets stored on your TM backup drive.  TM is designed to be independent of the Finder, and TM \"files\" are not at all Finder-friendly; between that and the peculiarities of flash drives (newly freed space is not immediately made available), it's not surprising that the Finder loses track of what TM has been up to.  My guess is that you deleted the virtual machine file between the two snapshots, or perhaps while a snapshot was in progress.  The temporary snapshot of your VM is going to be huge, because even the slightest change results in a \"new\" 30+ GB file.  (This is why you have to exclude VMs from Time Machine backups.)\nDoing a Disk Utility repair every month month or two is good housekeeping - especially with a flash drive.  You can catch and repair minor glitches before they have a chance to compound themselves into major problems.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and my sudo du -sh /* showed similar results. \nBut the trash folder, which exists under /user, doesn't show up in this list! All my old VMs were still in Trash, and I just had to empty the trash to reclaim the space. (though it took a long time to figure that out)\n\nA: Omg, just stop and restart time machine and it'll work just fine and you'll see your recovered space.\n\nA: You need to create empty virtual machine with same name in same folder where you had deleted VM.\nThen you need to right click on that file and select Show package content.\nAfter this procedure you need to Show package content on your copy virtual machine (on external USB) and copy content from usb package to your local package. Everything but hdd(big) file. After this you can add and delete this virtual machine from parallels and this will clean your space =)\n", "Q: Poor battery performance on MacBook Pro I have recently bought a very expensive new MacBook Pro with 8 GB memory and now I am frustrated by its very fast battery drainage.

In the afternoon I have closed all applications - and miraculously I saw whopping 8 hours! Then launched Komodo and Chrome and back to 4 hours. Really puzzling...\n\nA: Your first step towards a solution should be to run Activity Monitor which can be found by searching in Spotlight or Applications > Utilities. Set the tab to CPU and watch for applications that are using a lot of CPU. Investigate the programs or processes that display high usage.\nI recently encountered high CPU usage with Google Chrome. Web searches reveal many opinions as to the reason but the best solution is to disable Chrome plugins unless you really need them. When I disabled my plugins, the CPU usage dropped considerably.\n\nA: Komodo has long been known to eat a lot of CPU time (and therefore battery life) on the Mac. I'm not sure if it's because of the cross-platform toolkits they use or if the program is just inefficient. Combine this with running Chrome and you have the potential for short battery life.\nHave you considered another text editor?

How can I upgrade my iOS version to the latest version of iOS that I can have on my 3GS? I'm new to jailbreaking and to iPhones. I want to upgrade it to 6.1, but I really don't know how. My phone is already jailbroken.\n\nA: Your best bet is to use iTunes to update it:\n(WARNING: this will factory reset your phone. You will need to ensure all your data is appropriately backed up - you'll also have to re-jailbreak afterwards.)  \nPut the phone in recovery mode and plug it into the computer.\nNext, open iTunes. It will tell you it has detected an iPhone in recovery mode and give you the option to update and restore it. Do this. (It will download about 700 MB of data and then factory reset the phone.)\nBoot your phone up and it will be running iOS 6.1.6! You'll need to re-jailbreak.\nAn iOS 6.1.{3+} jailbreak needs a tool called p0sixspwn to be untethered - be sure not to forget that!

I broke my iPhone last weekend and the screen remains blank/black even if I connect it to a computer running iTunes. Is there a way I can still access my contacts?\n\nA: If you synced them through iCloud, then the easiest way is to go to  iCloud. From there you can go to Contacts, select them all using the gear menu on the bottom left and export the vCards. You also can open iTunes and see if it has already been set to sync contacts to an app on the computer or if iTunes has a backup that you could restore onto any iPod, iPhone or iPad to access them / cloud sync them.\nOtherwise if you were backing up the device on your computer you can recover the data with iPhone Backup Extractor.\nOr, if the phone still boots up (e.g. you just broke the screen or something like that), you can also try using some utilities like PhoneView (I'm pretty sure there are others, but I've used only PhoneView so I don't know if/how they works).\n\nA: Not a direct answer to accessing your contacts, but if this works you have you iPhone and contacts back.\nI had a similar problem last week. After a night my iPhone was turned off. The battery was not empty.\nPress and keep the power and home button for about 10 seconds.

It does have iOS5 currently installed.\nI do want to install (with friend's permission) few free apps from App Store. However, even installing free app require entering password to my friend Apple ID. Since obviously friend does not want to share it, he allowed me to log out of his Apple ID and log in to my own. However I am afraid that switching accounts on iPad might result in loosing data like photos or application data.\n\n\n*\n\n*Will switching Apple IDs on iPad cause any data loss? If so, will that data be restored automatically when friend log in back to his Apple ID?\n\n*Will I have access to apps installed with other Apple ID?\n\n*Will updating system from iOS5 to iOS7 cause any data loss?\n\n*Can I log in to multiple Apple IDs on one iPad? If so, will it cause any data loss?\n\n\nA: I believe this depends on they way the App is set up. If an app backs up its data on iCloud then it will not be able to retrieve it as each Apple ID has separate iCloud storage space. On the other hand if the app uses its own server for syncing (and you use the same login details) I would imagine it will restore data appropriately. \nHowever purchases made with one Apple ID are not available to another Apple ID. I am not sure if Apple offer transferring purchases but I guess you could contact them to see it they could do so for you.\n1) I don't think changing Apple ID will cause any data loss. I switch between two and never had any issues (I would however check with Apple)\n2) Yes, but you might have to download them first if not already on the iPad.\n3) This could happen as the apps will have to be updated and since iOS5 most apps have heavily changed both visually and the way they work with say iCloud.\n4) As stated in (1) I don't believe you should loose any data but you can only have one Apple ID active at a time.\nMake sure you take a full backup on your computer before making any big updates like moving to iOS7 from iOS5. \n", "Q: Recoverability with HFS Plus following removal of a disk from RAID 0 hardware or software A theoretical question (I do not have spare hardware to test for this). \nScenarios\nIf RAID 0 is used (no redundancy of data) with HFS Plus, and if a disk within the array is disconnected for a while whilst the file system is mounted by OS X, then I assume that: \n\n\n*\n\n*the OS will at least present a red alert for an improper eject\n\n*worse behaviours may occur. \n\n\nI'm not particularly interested in the behaviours of the Mac around the time of disconnection. Most interested in the aftermath …\n\nLogically, I guess: switch off all hardware, replace the missing part of the RAID 0 array (reintroduce the missing disk) then restart the Mac. \nThe question\nHow likely is it that the end user – the person who found or made the disconnection of the disk – might recover data in the following situations?\n\n\n*\n\n*Where the RAID 0 is software-controlled (for example, created by Apple Disk Utility)\n\n*where the RAID 0 is hardware-controlled. \n\n\nI imagine that the end user would find recovery difficult or impossible; that the RAID-specific expert services of a company might be required. \n\nWhilst the question is theoretical, I will greatly appreciate any experience-based answers. \n\nA: In a RAID 0 set established by Disk Utility you, of course, have zero redundancy. The moment one of the drives is lost from the set the entire set becomes useless and you have a volume failure. If (and only if) no attempt was made by anything to write to the volume while the physical drive wasn't there you might be lucky and it will be OK but otherwise you will have a problem.\nAt that point any recovery is going to be difficult. Any attached Mac will just see the volume disappear. I've seen this happen a number of times and getting the data off was only ever partially successful (and a small part at that) and extremely expensive. My advice to a couple of customers who've had it happen is just give it up as a joke and go to the backups. Chances of good data recovery are so close to zero as makes no difference.\nIf you are extremely lucky and there was no attempt to write to the volume and the heavens smile upon you then it is conceivable that a volume repair might work. I've actually seen it happen - once.\nFor a hardware RAID 0 it's pretty much the same.\nThe only place I like to use RAID 0 is in a separate hardware drive array such as the Promise boxes for a user who really needs the speed for something like video editing.\nIf you really need the speed of RAID 0 then make sure you have really good backup policies.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s irregularly asks for Apple ID after a night at airplane mode My girlfriend uses her iPhone to wake her up, and during night, she puts it in flightmode (because she doesn't like radiation).\n1 out of approx. 3 mornings the phone doesn't wake her, instead it asks her (silently) for her Apple ID.\nThe screen shows (in Dutch, so probably not 100% right translated)\n\nactivation required\n\nafter clicking at it, it tells \n\nActivation required.\n  On your iPhone flight mode is active.

I made a playlist for my brother, using tracks (.mp3) that I have on my Macbook and usually listen to with iTunes. I want to put these tracks onto a USB stick to give to him. I don't have the USB stick yet but I thought I'd get the tracks ready to put onto the stick, by copying them all into a separate folder on Finder and editing the ID3 tags so that their \"album\" field contains the name of the playlist and their track numbers match their positions within the playlist. I thought this would be simple enough (I grew up with Windows), so just made a new folder (under \"Documents\") and copied them out of iTunes into here. I then realized that it's impossible to edit ID3 tags through Finder. After overcoming my initial frustration with this, I thought that instead of downloading some third-party software I'd just copy these files into iTunes and edit their ID3 tags there. I made a new playlist within iTunes, dragged the files from the folder in Documents into this playlist and edited all the ID3 tags appropriately. When I was done I deleted the mp3s out of the folder in Documents and dragged the edited tracks from iTunes into this folder to replace them. This meant that I had exactly what I wanted (the tracks with the new ID3 tags) in the folder in Documents. \nHowever, I then realized that something hadn't worked as I'd expected. I thought I'd duplicated the files that had initially been in my iTunes when I'd copied them into the folder in Documents, and then had added these new (but identical) files into iTunes, which I'd then edited (meaning that their ID3 tags were no longer identical to the originals). However, it turns out that somehow iTunes, presumably recognising the files to be identical, had somehow merged them? Either that or it had never actually duplicated them in the first place? I'm really not sure how it works. Either way, the end result is that the original files have disappeared from my iTunes and from my computer; now I only have the ones with the new ID3 tags. I tried to \"undo\" what I'd done in iTunes, but it was impossible (the editing of the ID3 tags didn't appear in the list of actions that could be undone, for some reason). \nMy questions are thus: firstly, is there a way to revert the files' ID3 tags to what they were before, other than manually? (It will be really annoying to have to go and look up the album titles and track numbers for each track and edit them manually.) And secondly, what did I do wrong? How do I achieve my simple goal of copying (i.e. duplicating) a group of mp3s and editing the ID3 tags of the copies without changing the originals?\n\nA: As to your second question, I would try Tagscanner (https://www.xdlab.ru/en/). You can tell it the location of the files you want to edit tags for. So there is no danger of editing the set wrong files. It also has a batch mode. Read the documentation, as with many powerful tools, it has a lot of features that can seem overwhelming to new users. It also has a preview mode for changes that allows to to see the changes you are making before committing them.\n\nA: To revert your files, hopefully you can just restore from your Time Machine backup.\niTunes stores all of its media files in one library which is by default, in your home folder under Music > iTunes. If you change a file, then you change the library. One possible workaround is to export the library to another location, then set that new location as the iTunes library. Then edit the files in the new library.\nA better solution would be to manually find the file in the default library, then duplicate it (File > Duplicate). Work on the duplicate file with something other than iTunes.\nThere are many programs out there that will edit id3 tags. I personally like Audacity because of its solid reputation.\n\nA: I had just this problem myself, i loaded an compilation and it dumped the songs outside of the album. It is really easy in itunes. Select the song you want, click file in the top bar of itune and scroll down to \"get info\". Form here you can easily edit the tags, and album artwork. If you click the album alome you can alter its tags but not touch the songs in it.\n", "Q: Image annotations that remain changeable I want to edit images with annotations (text, arrows, ...). Preview does offer a nice set of tools but after saving they get embedded in the image and are not clickable/modifiable anymore. Using Time Machine to reset changes is much too cumbersome.\nDo you know of any similar tools where i can easily alter annotations after saving (like Skim for PDFs).\n\nA: Skitch\n\nSkitch is a very useful app for making annotations on images, and whilst by default it saves the files using the format that they are imported as, it can save it as a Skitch PNG which keeps the ability to modify the annotations, or the files can be kept inside its own library.\n", "Q: Reformat and then use Time Machine? I want to reformat my MacBook late-2008 unibody aluminium with HDD.\nCan I do that and then after I have reinstalled OS X go to Time Machine and recover everything? Is this possible?\n\nA: Yes, this is possible. Make sure that you've completed a backup through Time Machine, and that the backup is working and accessible, then erase and install OS X.\nOnce OS X is installed, you can use Migration Assistant to restore your data, or set up as a new Mac and use Time Machine to restore individual files/folders.\n", "Q: 1Tb PCIe SSD in 2012 Retina MacBook Pro? Now that the late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro can be configured with Samsung based 1TB PCIe based SSD storage, would those fit into the late 2012 Retina MacBook Pro?\nOWC describes about the 1TB configuration, but not about the specs.\n\nA: No, the 2012 and early-2013 Retina MBP SSD's are not PCIe-based, so you could not install an SSD from a late-2013 Retina MBP.\n", "Q: Lots of weird stuff happening today So I'll just list the symptoms I've experienced in the last few hours, so far I can't seem to find a pattern, suffice to say the macbook is virtually unusable for my purposes.

You need to quit and open Messages again.\n\n\nCan I just copy Library files from another one of my computers running OS X? Or is this the sort of thing that I need to reinstall the OS for?\n\nA: Yes, copying the files from another computer should be fine, providing both computers have the same version of Messages.\nThere is a certain amount of leniency with this though, depending on where the files are that you deleted. For example, files in your home folder are expected to be backward-compatible since if you've upgraded your OS then it must know how to update the files.\nAlso, once you've copied the files, make sure you set the permissions correctly…\n\n\n*\n\n*If you've copied files to /Library, use Disk Utility to repair permissions.\n\n*If you've copied files to ~/Library, use the ACL tool on the Recovery HD.\n\n", "Q: Chrome slow when loading local virtual host I'm developing a local website with MAMP.

I want to upgrade from ML to Mavericks but I want to erase and format my HD to a single partition along the way. Is this possible? \n\nA: Yes you can use disk utility to reformat the Macintosh HD partition during the installation of Mavericks, however if you want to create a new partition using disk utility the you will have to create a Mavericks install USB so you can boot from there. \nYou can't create a Partition when booted from the same drive hence the need to boot from a USB installer. \nCreating a USB installer is as follows, Format the USB thumb drive as a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and name the USB thumb drive Untitled\nDownload Mavericks from the Mac App Store,\nCopy and paste this command into terminal,\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app —nointeraction\n\nA: If time (and bandwidth) is not an issue, you could upgrade your current drive to 10.9 first, which would also create the 10.9 recovery partition.  Then, after booting into the 10.9 recovery partition, you could partition the drive via disk utility and then cleanly (re)install 10.9.\n", "Q: What is the default folder structure for an iTunes library?

You might be referencing files from those folders in your iTunes library. Check those folders for music, and only if there's no files you need in there, then delete them.\n", "Q: To get extended views in XCode?

Normally I launch the Terminal, press the up arrow until I reach the command I want, and then hit enter.\nI've decided that a more sustainable solution might be to create a file I can just double-click to run the Terminal command. In my searches, I discovered that I could create a text file with the .command extension which contains the command that I want to run.\nHowever, when I double-click on this file, the Terminal opens and I get the following error:\n\nThe file “Sign Code.command” could not be executed because you do not\nhave appropriate access privileges.\nTo view or change access\nprivileges, select the file in the Finder and choose File > Get Info.\n\nThe problem is that when I go to the Get Info wind as directed and look at my Permissions, it says that my user has read-write access (the only other option is read). So in other words, I have the highest permissions, but still can't open this file.\nWhat can I do to solve this?\n\nA: You need to set 'execute' on the file for it to allow you to run it:\nchmod u+x /path/to/file.command\n\nu is the owner of the file, +x adds 'execute', so u+x gives the owner of the file the ability to execute it\n…then you can run it in the future by double-clicking it.\n", "Q: How can I colorize Finder icons in Mavericks? I don't like the new \"tags\".\nI'd like to be able to colorize some Finder icons.\nPreview allows me to \"adjust the color\" of icons, but only between Purple and Green.\nIs there a simple way to add other colors?\nThanks.\n\nA: If you mean to change the actual icon that represents the folders (i.e. double-click on it to open the folder), then there's a good, short article at http://www.visualpharm.com/articles/change_mac_icons.html that explains how to do this if you have icons you would already like to use.\n\nIn a nutshell, you right-click (control-click) on the Documents folder and choose \"Get Info\" from the menu that pops up. Then, choose an icon you'd like to replace it with.* Double-click it to open it in Preview, select all by pressing command-a, and then copy it by pressing command-c. Click on the icon of the Documents folder at the top of the Info window and paste the copied icon into its place using command-v. To remove the custom icon, select the icon you pasted in the Info window and press the delete key to restore it to its original icon. \nAs for colorizing icons, there are numerous applications that allow you to edit images. Pixelmator is a good one, relatively inexpensive as far as image editors go, and has a colorize option, as well as Adobe's Photoshop. There are also free alternatives that can be found with a bit of web searching.\n*You can create the icon from the one already there by selecting it in the Info window, pressing command-c to copy it, and opening up a blank document in your favorite image editor and pasting it into it. From there, you can edit it any way you like, then save it as a .png to use it as an icon.\n\nIf you mean the color-coded bars that would highlight the text, called labels, those have unfortunately been retired in Mavericks in replace of tags. Hope this helps solve your problem.\n", "Q: Can I download 3rd party songs on the iPad and add them to iTunes Match? I wonder if i can buy and download songs e.g. via Bandcamp in Safari, and then add them to my iTunes match right on my iPad?\nI know how to do that with iTunes on the Mac, but it would be neat to have this also on the iPad.\n\nA: Nope.

I'm having trouble sending email to a group from my iPad (with the email app that came with the iPad).\nThe groups are there under my contact groups.

Pressing Groups lets you narrow down this list to that specific group, but you still need to select the people that you want to send the email to. Tap them in the list (and select their email if necessary) to add them to the To field.\n", "Q: Error installing unixodbc I am trying to install php55 using brew, but when you start installing the dependency 'unixODBC' stops at the last line\nthis is the message that shows\n➜  ~  brew install -vu php55\n\n==> Installing dependencies for php55: unixodbc, homebrew/dupes/zlib\n==> Installing php55 dependency: unixodbc\n==> Downloading http://www.unixodbc.org/unixODBC-2.3.2.tar.gz\nAlready downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/unixodbc-2.3.2.tar.gz\n==> Verifying unixodbc-2.3.2.tar.gz checksum\ntar xf /Library/Caches/Homebrew/unixodbc-2.3.2.tar.gz\n==> ./configure --disable-debug --disable-dependency-tracking --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.2 --enable-gui=no\nchecking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c\nchecking whether build environment is sane... yes\nchecking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... ./install-sh -c -d\nchecking for gawk... no\nchecking for mawk... no\n\n .......MORE......\n .......MORE......\n .......MORE......\n .......MORE......\n\n -g -O2 -pthread -c -o _iniScanUntilObject.lo _iniScanUntilObject.c\nlibtool: compile:  clang -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -I../include -g -O2 -pthread -c _iniPropertyRead.c  -fno-common -DPIC -o .libs/_iniPropertyRead.o\nlibtool: compile:  clang -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -I../include -g -O2 -pthread -c _iniDump.c  -fno-common -DPIC -o .libs/_iniDump.o\nlibtool: compile:  clang -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -I../include -g -O2 -pthread -c _iniScanUntilObject.c  -fno-common -DPIC -o .libs/_iniScanUntilObject.o\n/bin/sh ../libtool --tag=CC   --mode=link clang  -g -O2 -pthread -no-undefined   -o libinilc.la  iniAllTrim.lo iniAppend.lo iniDelete.lo iniClose.lo iniCommit.lo iniObject.lo iniObjectFirst.lo iniObjectLast.lo iniObjectNext.lo iniObjectSeek.lo iniObjectSeekSure.lo iniObjectUpdate.lo iniObjectInsert.lo iniObjectDelete.lo iniObjectEOL.lo iniOpen.lo iniProperty.lo iniPropertyFirst.lo iniPropertyLast.lo iniPropertyNext.lo iniPropertySeek.lo iniPropertySeekSure.lo iniPropertyUpdate.lo iniPropertyInsert.lo iniPropertyDelete.lo iniPropertyEOL.lo iniPropertyValue.lo iniValue.lo iniToUpper.lo iniElement.lo iniElementCount.lo iniGetBookmark.lo iniGotoBookmark.lo iniCursor.lo _iniObjectRead.lo _iniPropertyRead.lo _iniDump.lo _iniScanUntilObject.lo ../extras/libodbcextraslc.la \n\n[stops here]\n\n\nA: I solved the problem by updating Xcode to the latest version.\n", "Q: How to make a message appear on the screen?

In Lion if I used QuickLook to display an image, and then clicked the double arrows to make it full screen, it would scale the image to the size of my monitor (up too, not just down). Then when I used the arrow keys to navigate in the Finder, all subsequent small images would also display scaled up. That no longer happens. In Mavericks, small images are now displayed at 100% with a black border around all four sides. You can scale individual images up by tapping the Option key, but that only applies one image at a time, not the whole series.\nIs there any way to get that setting back? I used that feature a lot, and it's rather disconcerting that it's gone.\n\nA: I finally figured out how to do this (sort of).\nAgain, easier to do with more than one monitor - I don't know how it would work on a single monitor.\nIn the Finder, sort the images as you like then right click (ctrl-click) on the first image in a Finder window you wish to see. A pop-up menu will appear with an item about half way down called Quick Look \"name-of-image.xtn\" (where \"name-of-image.xtn\" is the name of the image you clicked on). Now, before doing anything else, hold down the Option key. The menu item will change to Slideshow \"name-of-image.xtn\".\nNOTE: You must do it in that order - if you hold down Option before you right click on the image, you get a completely different menu pop up.\nWhen you release the mouse, the image will open up full screen but not full size. When you release the Option key, the image will go full size. However, the image will have focus and arrow navigation won't work, so you have to bring focus back to the Finder window, easiest done by clicking on the Finder window (which is why I don't know how to do this with only one monitor).\nNow: if you hold down the Option key while tapping the right arrow key, each image will open up fullscreen and full height/width, regardless of whether it is smaller than your monitor resolution or not.\nProblems: \n\n\n*\n\n*Navigation doesn't work in List view.\n\n*In Columns view only Opt-RightArrow is of any use. If you type Opt-UpArrow or Opt-DownArrow you will go to the first or last image in the Finder window. If you type Opt-LeftArrow you will exit out of the folder you're in. Additionally, if you have your window sorted by tags, the cursor gets stuck on the virtual folders separating different tag groups. \n\n*Opt-Navigation works fine in Icons view. No problems there, but having to remember to hold down the Option key becomes annoying pretty quickly.\n\n\nAll things considered, this is pretty awkward. It's a real kludge for something that \"just worked\" in Lion. I hope it's something they fix for Yosemite, or at least give us a preference somewhere to toggle fullscreen behaviour.\n\nA: imazik, thanks for the question.\nNo. If I have an image that is larger than my screen, when I quicklook it it is scaled down to have a clear border around the outside that reveals the desktop/windows behind it, like a normal window zoomed to not-quite-fullscreen. If I then click the double zoom arrow that makes it full screen it then fills the screen. In the case of a screen grab it fits exactly, but most images are not 16:10 (I have 30\" monitors, 2560x1600px) so it will scale the image so one dimension fits the monitor, and the other dimension has black borders (think letterboxing).\nIf I then use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate through a folder of images* and they are all larger than my screen (say a folder of JPGs from my Nikon) they will fit to screen whether they are landscape or portrait. No problem.\nBut if I navigate through a folder of say, web assets that are all smaller than my monitor they now only display at 100%. So if an image is 400x600px and I fullscreen it, it displays with large black borders on all four sides.\nThis is different behaviour than what happened in Lion (I never ran Mountain Lion so I don't know what it did).\nIn Lion, when using quick look all images were scaled to fit the screen, up or down. This is the behaviour I'm trying to restore in Mavericks.\nI was hoping there was a terminal setting or something like that that would restore it.\nAny ideas?\nThanks.\n\n\n*\n\n*This is easier to do with double monitors - fullscreen images on one monitor, navigate through a folder on the other monitor. It can be done on a single monitor too, it's just awkward. When you fullscreen zoom an image, it then has focus and the arrow keys do nothing. You have to fullscreen the image, then Cmd-~ to switch focus to the folder hidden behind the image, and now arrow keys will navigate through the folder.\n\n", "Q: What is causing my application crashes?

Has anyone else been having this problem?\n\n*** update\nHere is another snapshot 7 minutes later. I've only been using chrome to do light browsing. notice that the battery life has gone down by 34 minutes...\n\n\nA: The picture you post might not indicate any problem whatsoever with the hardware. However, the tools and steps to determine if this is hardware or software are quite easy and powerful.\nSince the Mac is new, you would be free to use internet or in-person support to ask Apple to help determine if the battery is sound and the software installed properly. You can also check System Information (spotlight will locate it) and check the power settings. If the health isn't Normal initiate hardware service with Apple as software alone won't remedy the low battery life.\nTo determine if software is the cause, I would do this as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your files or the entire drive. It could be hardware and why risk losing anything - whether during troubleshooting or if the Mac fails completely.\n\n*Make a new user account as administrator\n\n*Disable automatic log in\n\n*Shut down your Mac\n\n*Plug in power and wait for the LED to turn green and disconnect from power\n\n*Start the Mac and log into your newly created empty admin account\n\n\nIt won't have any saved state, nothing extra running except perhaps any software you have that starts at boot (instead of when your normal account logs in).

Also, document the power in System Information -> Power:\nYou care about documenting the overall settings and these settings over time as the Mac runs:\n  Charge Information:\n    Charge Remaining (mAh):     5975\n    Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 6432\n  Amperage (mA):               -1101\n  Voltage (mV):                12096\n\nOpen Activity Monitor and go to the Energy tab. Not all the programs listed are running as things from the last 8 hours of non-sleep time are displayed, but you can sort on Energy Impact to show running processes.\nIn the next 20 minutes where you don't do anything on the Mac except wait for the battery to go down a bit, watch for apps that are using non-zero energy. In general, apps that support App nap and sudden termination will let the OS be most frugal with power when the app isn't busy with work.\nAfter 20 minutes, you should have a good reading on the estimated run time with no load as well as a baseline for what apps are using power before you start loading your menu bar extras, chrome. You can use the Activity Monitor to watch and determine whether your battery can run for 8+ hours idle (it should) and if programs you don't want are causing the CPU and GPU to drain that 8 hour allotment in half the time. Since all shipping MacBook are capable of draining their batteries in 3 hours if the CPU and GPU are loaded 100% - you'll have to determine your energy usage by using Activity Monitor or getting Apple to assist you in testing the battery.\nThey do have diagnostic tools that can read the power logs and battery information and summarize things more rapidly, so if none of this makes sense you can always get a new Mac checked during the warranty period for proper battery function for free.\n\nThis turned out to be longer than I hoped, but my guess is you will find a good battery and that the \"light browsing\" in chrome is actually one or two tabs that take continual CPU time as well as a few other background tasks that run constantly and prevent the energy savings that depend on App Nap and CPU sleeping for un-noticed to us, but significant portions of the time.\n\nA: Chrome is a power hog on macs.

With a bit of luck this solves your problem.\n\n*If none of the above have worked, you may have a nasty program running in the background that is making the kernel_task going off the charts thus draining your battery. This might be caused by dodgy software you might have installed. Use Activity Monitor to spot the problem.\n\n*Most important of all, do not use Google Chrome, it literally drains your battery dead, and if you got at the same time a Flash complement running, well it makes it even worse. This is a well known issue too, but Google just doesn't care, nor does Apple.\n\n\nIf you have tried all these steps and the battery life has not improved, I would take my machine to the Genius Bar, letting the \"genius\" know that you have tried all of these things. If you don't let him know, he will simply get rid of you by saying \"oh yeah well you know just try not to use Google Chrome\".\n", "Q: Which animations will work on Keynote export to PowerPoint?

What components does it have and how do they work? What protocols are supported? What I only know of is it is compatible with VNC (as a client and as a host).\nI'm interested in knowing more technical details and play around with them.\n\nA: If we are speaking only about Screen Sharing (SS) (forgetting ARD), it is working as follows:\nFirst, there is a daemon configuration file (/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist). It contains a record that tells launchd to start SS Server (and then SS Agent) every time when someone connects to port 5900. The server is located at /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/screensharingd.bundle, the agent is at /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ScreensharingAgent.bundle.\nThe SS Server is the main part of SS Service. It performs network interacting, implements used protocols, performs image encoding, authentication and so on. In turn, SS Agent impersonates current user and handles things like providing image of user screen, “pressing” keys, “moving” mouse.\n(AFAIR, this separation began with Mac OS X 10.7. Formerly the service was monolithic, was named AppleVNCServer and has been always running while the “Screen Sharing” switch in System Preferences was on).\nSS Service also can start the following helpers as needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSPasteboardHelper (located in SS Agent bundle) — pastes pasteboard data to system pasteboard as it arrives from the client,\n\n*SSAssistanceCursor — appeared just recently, I’m wondering what it is for,\n\n*SSFileCopyReceiver / SSFileCopySender (in SS Server bundle) — is used for transmitting/receiving files.\n\n\nAs for protocols, SS Service uses the same RFB protocol as all VNC clients, but with some specific extensions.\nThe server reports that it supports protocol version 3.889 (most other servers report versions 3.3 to 3.8).\nIt also supports most common codecs — raw, ZLib, ZRLE — as well as Apple’s custom ones (black-and-white and grayscale ZLib, and “adaptive” codec that uses JPEG-like compression algorithm).\nAlso there are many Apple-specific protocol extensions, implementing drag-and-drop, files transmission, automatic pasteboard synchronization, transmission of gesture events, and so on.\nThis is a very general explanation, but if you ask a more specific question, I’ll be glad to help.\n", "Q: Magic Mouse Gesture not working OS X Mavericks I am using Magic Mouse with my iMac having OS X Mavericks 10.9. \nEverything was working fine since today morning, I realized that my Magic Mouse is only responding to scrolling and primary, secondary click.

Attached to it are an Airport Express (802.11n 1st Gen Single Band) which is connected by and extends WiFi over it's wired ethernet, and also an Airport Extreme (802.11n 2nd Gen Single Band) which extends wirelessly.  I run a dual band network, the 2.4GHz network which is extended over the 2 slave devices (for want of a better description), and the main router also has a 5GHz network as it is a dual band router, and the guest network (which is an open network, no security).\nIn Airport Utility on iOS devices (I don't currently have access to a Mac to test the OS X application) I can select a device, select Wireless Clients, and list any clients that are connected to that particular device (from an access point perspective).\nOne problem with this is not seeing how can I identify which device is being shown in the list?  Most attached devices will happily have a real description, namely iOS devices, Macs and some PCs etc, but I have a whole load of devices for which I cannot easily identify what is being connected.  For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*I sometimes just get the DHCP lease IP address shown as the client\n\n*I sometimes get a name that I don't recognise, i.e. Sue's iPhone or android-653246a714bc41f\n\n*I sometimes get the MAC address only\n\n*Sometimes (today, after I added a new access restriction) all the proper DHCP Client ID names are replaced with the MAC address for periods of time, and sometimes MAC addresses are shown when the client (example, Apple TV and Playstation 3) is in a WOL enabled sleep mode - still connected on the \"physical\" layer, but with no IP address assigned.\nMy reasons for wanting to do this are varied:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Airport Express has a limit of the number of connections that can be made to it, so it might be nice to move some devices to another access point to relieve strain on it\n\n*Being a bit fussy, I like to be able to identify what is what generally\n\n*I have reasons for leaving the guest network open in terms of security (some old devices that only support WEP, some devices are such a pain to type passwords into like my TV receiver box that I simply don't wish to spend 20 minutes faffing entering a very lengthy password via a TV remote control unit...).  I know some people (Sue, and her iPhone) use my guest network without my permission, and I wanted to use access control to block these people as and when I see them use the network.\nSo, the problem for which I am asking this question is as follows:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I make the router set or remember a descriptive name for all devices, not just those that response to DHCP Client ID requests?\n\n*\n\n*Sub question: How can I see all current DHCP leases, not just currently connected clients?\n\n\n\n\nI have tried to use DHCP reservations against a PC that only ever shows up with the MAC address, to see if it wil then pick up the description, and it doesn't seem to.\nI have set a year long lease on my DHCP, so should be able to identify individual devices with some accuracy etc to stop devices sharing an IP address\nEverything uses DHCP, the only hardcoded IPs are the routers themselves.\n\nA: It seems there is no way to force a client ID at the router end, so you have to make do with setting it right on the client.  I discovered that my Apple TV and Playstation has spaces in the names that prevented them from setting the ID properly.  Taking the spaces out made them show up properly.  However, some clients manage to register names correctly with spaces, so I guess it's down to the implementation of the IP stack on the client device rather than a server issue.\nIt's also worth noting that after updating settings or resetting the routers, it appears to show just MACs until it has time at some point doing a lookup against it to set the ID.  I found no way of working out how long this is, seems to be random.\nIt's also worth noting that some devices that are able to use Wake On LAN over wifi and that are currently in a sleep state will register at a Physical layer, so the router is able to send the relevant command to wake it, and as such the MAC is shown, but no IP (and hence no active DHCP use to pull the ID) until the device wakes and pulls it's IP/registers it's client ID.\nFinally, using an old version (5.6.1) of Airport Utility it is possible to view a DHCP lease list of all clients, not just active wireless connections.  Sadly it doesn't work on Mavericks, but you can bodge it to make it work.  Unfortunately, either it does not track the DHCP leases for the guest network, or the lease length (not configurable) is short so pretty much only actively connected guests are shown in this list.\n\n", "Q: Syncing someone else's iphone to my itunes Can I sync someone else's iphone to my iTunes and put my songs on their phone without losing their imformation such as contacts\n\nA: Store the contacts in iCloud?

How to prevent it? I just recently bought a MacBook Air 2013 (i7 with 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD drive). I am a programmer, and my daily jobs would involve a lot of testing on that machine, including setting up databases, indexing Solr-based indices, etc. I stopped on the Air primarily because it is lightweight, and the SSD drive gives it a performance boost. Yet after what I learned about the limited write cycles of SSD drives, it gets me concerned if I should really do heavy-duty systems testing on it, or I should outsource it to say, an external hard drive or something. If I set up my projects to run from an external HDD, would that save me from expiring the life of the SSD? And how much is it really?\nI'd love to find out some tools to be able to observe the life of the SSD over time. \nAny other programmers with MacBook Air out there? What is your experience?\n\nA: No. SSD that Apple ships are so much more reliable than the hard drives Apple ships (used to ship) that this is basically a non-issue. You still need a backup, failures still happen, but SSD have spare capacity and degrade gracefully, losing a little storage incrementally as they start to “fail”.\nI've not heard of any early failures attributed to over use on 2010 and later SSD. I've also not even heard of documented cases of severe slow downs as explained here:\n\n\n*\n\n*What happens at the user/OS level when an SSD finally wears out?\nThe controllers are apparently good enough and TRIM is recycling blocks in real-world situations to make SSD last as long as the computers. You might look at AppleCare to have Apple amortize the risk that you will wear your drive out in a 3 year period, but even with database writes, I'm not seeing developer machines fail prematurely. I also have no bad experience with SSD on servers and was surprised how well the Apple SSD are aging in general.\n", "Q: What methods can be used to find hidden options in OSX softwares? I was wondering what methods can be used to find hidden options in OSX software. \nI regularly stumble upon hidden options that can be added in the .plist preferences files (using defaults write), but do other methods exist to identify options?  Perhaps there is a way to get an App to display it's options other than manual digging around?\n\nA: It involves a lot of trial and a lot of error, but you can be helped along in the process by running the strings command against the binary for application, directing the results to a file, and then reading that output looking for hyphenated or InnerCapitalizedWords that might suggest a  candidate for a hidden preference.\nRob Griffeths wrote an article at MacWorld that gives some helpful suggestions for finding hidden preferences.\n\nA: I often use GDB to attempt to find hidden preferences.\nPut simply, you run the app using GDB which logs the app's request/setting of preferences as you use it, then you use the app's specific features as you usually would that you hope there's a hidden preference for. Once done, you can use a command on the log file which sorts and filters the log to find the references to preferences, which you can then go through and see if there's any that look 'hidden' — it takes some time but you can find some really interesting things.\nThere's a full guide as to how to do this available here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://home.comcast.net/~arcticmac/tutorials/gdbFindingPrefs.html\n", "Q: How to have my MacBook Pro safely hibernate when out of juice?

This is very nice.

This means that any applications that were open when you lost power, shut down the machine or rebooted would open back up to where they were previously.\nUsing this mechanism, there is no need to write the 'hibernation state' to the disk, which (a) uses a big lump of hard disk space, (b) takes time and (c) is risky - if there's not enough power to complete writing the data, you lose all of the state.\nYou can use the following Terminal command to configure this if you prefer:\nsudo pmset hibernatemode 25\nper the help at man pmset:\n\nhibernatemode = 25 (binary 0001 1001) is only settable via pmset.

Can iBeacons work directly with remote servers? in other words can you store notifications or information you want pushed out to users on a server and have that information retrieved from a server when the user gets within range of an iBeacon? \nI am almost done with building my app but need to store information I want pushed out to users on a remote server rather than locally in my app. For some reason I cannot find a direct answer to this or anywhere online that talks about iBeacons working with servers to populate information to users.\n\nA: An iBeacon can't communicate directly with a remote server. iBeacons are low-energy bluetooth devices that only performs a broadcast of it's UUID (unique user identifier), a major and minor numbers. \nOn your iOS app using CoreLocation framework you can intercept this broadcasted signal and use it as you please. An example of this is GeoHopper app that has easy integration with web hooks of your choice. You will also be able to get the proximity of the iBeacon device within your app, the proximity is given in four values: Unknown, Far, Near and Immediate.\nThe video What is new in Core Location (Apple developer account required) has a good introduction to the iBeacon technology.\n\nA: https://github.com/javadj111/ibeacon-server\nhere i created a simple server to store beacon's detail in database(derby) and show them to user in a web-panel. using restful API to send data from client-side to server. \n\nA: The term iBeacon is a marketing term for the idea that iOS (and Mac) location services can be driven by bluetooth signals. So, the bluetooth component can be a USB device, software running on the Mac or iOS device (and other vendors too) or custom hardware that can run from battery power. \nRather than having your app use GPS or WiFi proximity, it can register for updates to be triggered when a beacon is close by. Whether you \"app\" is simply an iBeacon activated passbook pass or something more full feature, it can register to have the OS wake it up rather than need to run in the background continually. \nThe device and/or app then can communicate with the server (assuming a data connection) rather than the beacon communicating directly with the server. \nApple describes this at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6048\n\nA: Beacons are 'dumb' and only output an ID that the app detects and goes off to the server to load appropriate content.\nI'm not 100% sure I'm understanding your question fully (so I apologise if I have it wrong) but here are some thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Design your App to load web content (i.e. it becomes a browser of\nsorts)\n\n*Combine an beacon CMS system that sits behind your your app and\nassists you to control / manage the content URL's the beacons load\nincluding the URL's for the various proximity distance settings.\n\n\nA: Yes, the app can do that based on beacon region, have a look at this answer:\nCan iBeacon range/region monitoring trigger \"dynamic\"/data-based notification?\n", "Q: How can I prevent \"Open With...\" from accessing external drives? Frequently, when I try to open the (10.9) Finder's \"Open With...\" menu, I experience a delay that appears to be due to connected FireWire drives. This delay is very long when the drives need to spin up, but is also perceptible when the drives have not spun down. For me, this delay makes no sense: I have no applications that I use stored on my external drives, and I have disabled Spotlight searches of these drives (using Spotlight's \"Privacy\" setting).\nIs there some way to prevent the \"Open With...\" menu examining external drives?\n\nNote that this is not a question about speeding up the OW menu in general (e.g., by pruning apps and file type associations), nor about keeping duplicate apps on external drives from appearing in the OW menu (I have none as my Spotlight settings noted above exclude them).\n\nA: The apps that are displayed in \"Open With...\" are taken from the Launch Services database which keeps track of what apps can open which file types. In your case it would seem that Launch Services thinks you may have an appropriate app on your Firewire disks (even though you there aren't any - it is wanting to look).\nOlder versions of macOS seem to be particularly susceptible to this database becoming somewhat tangle/messy.\nThe solution is to rebuild the Launch Services database.  You can do that at the terminal with this command:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -f -v -domain local -domain user -domain system\nIt is running the lsregister app to reset the database.  It may take sometime to complete. And you should check that the location for lsregister is correct for your version of macOS.\nIf using the Terminal is a challenge you can use the highly regarded Onyx to rebuild the database. It is on the Maintenance pane.  Make sure you disable all the other choices before running the rebuild task.  Note there is a different version of Onyx for each macOS version.\nThis has been covered before. For example: Finder \"Open With\" very slow.\nFor a more in depth discussion of Launch Services, read these:\nRecent Items, Launch Services, and SharedFileLists and Launch Services database problems\n", "Q: Where are all of the command line tools installed? I was playing around to set up a prober working/development environment.\nI installed command line tools such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*NodeJS\n\n*NPM\n\n*Grunt\n\n*Bower\n\n\nWhere can I find those tools and how can I delete them? Is there any routine?\n\nA: The whereis command only looks in the standard executable paths. Try which bower instead. Here's an example from my machine. I used \"git\" because I don't have \"bower\" installed.\n~ 506 whereis git\n/usr/bin/git\n~ 507 which git\n/opt/local/bin/git\n\nwhereis returned the path of the system-installed version of \"git\". which returned the path of the version that actually runs when I type \"git\" at the command line.\n\nA: Since they're all command line tools, you can find them using whereis <tool> or where <tool>. Many command line tools can be removed simply by deleting the file found at this location, however they may leave configuration files at various locations about your system. You can usually find a full guide on uninstalling a command line tool and its associated files by searching the website of the tool that you wish to uninstall.\n", "Q: If the iPad 2 is not HD, why does Apple advertise them as able to watch HD movies? If the iPad 2 and iPad mini do not have native HD resolution, then why does Apple market them to be able to watch HD movies? Isn't '720p' 1280 x 720, yet the iPad 2 or mini is 1024x768?\n\nA: I imagine this is a wording thing, there is a difference between benig able to \"watch HD movies\" and \"watch movies in HD\".  The iPad can take a HD source, and scale it to display.  Commonly (although not officially) HD modes can be denoted by their number of scan lines (720p = 720 progressive, or non-interlaced, horizontal rows of pixels), and in this case the iPad 2 has 768 rows.\n", "Q: Make OS X Mail show the most recent message in conversation I like how Mail groups related messages together in a \"conversation\", but I hate how it always by default shows the oldest unread message in a thread--even if it is months old! This has gotten me on a couple of occasions where I will see a new email come in, click it, and see a message from months ago, but not realize that I'm not seeing the one that just came in.\nAnyone know how to make Mail always scroll to the top/newest message in a conversation when clicking a message?\n\nA: In Mail preferences, at the bottom of the Viewing pane, under Viewing Conversations, there is a checkbox to Show Most Recent Message At The Top. I think that's what you want.\n\nA: You can also use defaults, the command-line interface for user preferences.

I just got my first proper AirPrint printer (the Canon PIXMA 7120).\nLike all printers, it has a ton of different settings for print quality, etc, and when you print from OSX, you get a print dialogue that lets you select things like \n\n\n*\n\n*Quality\n\n*Media type\n\n*Paper source\n\n*Etc.\n\n\nBut when printing from iOS native apps (I was using \"Photos\") the only choice I got was to select the AirPrint printer to print to.\nWhen I printed, either iOS or the printer seems to have decided to use the tray that's dedicated to (4x6 or 5x7) photos, and to print in (high) photo quality, and spat out a beautiful print.\nIt seems possible that it makes assumptions based on the app you start from (\"Photos\" is probably sending a picture, while \"Pages\" more likely has a doc.\nSo, my questions is:\nHow does it decide what settings to use, and can I change them?\nI might want it to print an 8X10 photo, or a pages doc on photo paper, etc.\n\nA: The app (\"Photos\" in this case) makes those decisions based on your content and on what your printer supports.\nIf you are uncomfortable with this I have developed an app for printing photos that lets you control paper size, job type, sizes (inches or cm), crop, layout and ppi: http://www.clafou.com/print\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to delete row in Numbers I can add rows conveniently using Option+Shift+Up Arrow (insert above) or Option+Shift+Down Arrow(insert below).\nIs there a keyboard shortcut to delete the current row?\n\nA: With Numbers 11 and earlier, by default, no, there's no shortcut.\nYou can create one yourself though:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts.\n\n\n*Click the + button to add a new shortcut.\n\n\n*Set the Application to Numbers.app, and the Menu Title to Delete Row.\n\n\n\n*Set your keyboard shortcut and press Add.\n\nA: As of at least Numbers 4.3.1, there is a menu item in the Table menu for deleting the current row (as well as one for deleting the current column), with keyboard shortcuts:\nDelete Row: Shift+Command+X\nDelete Column: Shift+Command+Y\n\nA: I still had this question (as keycommands are not given in context menu), so the previous answer pointed me to look in the regular menu.\nIn Numbers 12 it is opt+cmd+del/bs\n\nA: Apple has added the ability to delete a row with a keyboard shortcut.\nSee the attached image.\nDelete Rows ALT+CMD+DELETE\n\n", "Q: Switching the desktop enviroment Would it be possible to change the default environment to something like Cinnamon?

OSX does not use X11 as its main desktop. It uses is called Aqua to manage the desktop (I can't find the Apple doc that describes this - a newer one is here which describes the Cocoa application layer.\n\nThe term Aqua refers to the overall appearance and behavior of OS X. The Aqua look and feel is characterized by consistent, user-friendly behaviors combined with a masterful use of layout, color, and texture. Although much of the Aqua look and feel comes for free when you use Cocoa technologies to develop your app, there are still many steps you should take to distinguish your app from the competition. To create a beautiful, compelling app that users will love, be sure to follow the guidance provided in OS X Human Interface Guidelines.\n\nYou can run X11 applications on OSX using the normal OSX desktop but it will do the window management. I think you can run X11 on a background and so can use an X11 window manage to manage X11 windows but not anyones written to Apple's GUI APIs. (I think you can also boot OSX to a console (you are then just running Darwin) and then run X11 as the only graphics the you can use the environment you mentioned but again no  apps using Apple's GUI APIs)\n", "Q: How to keep multiple desktops static? I am using multiple desktops on my Mac. Depending on how I use them, the desktops seem to switch around. For instance the place where 'Terminal' is (second from the left) moves one to the right.

I'm still getting all my emails but the red alert in the dock icon and the number in the side bar like the images below aren't showing up, apart for one account.\nWhat's really strange is that I still get the emails showing up as notifications in the top corner of my screen and showing up in the email folders, but I'm just not getting the alerts.  \nHas any one else experienced this?\n\n\n\nA: Mail.app in 10.9 has had (and still have, for some) massive problems with Gmail-based accounts.\nIn the first couple of Developer Previews Mail.app was completely unusable for me. When the Golden Master (final release) of 10.9 came out it was better but still horrible compared to earlier versions of OS X. In my case, Mail did actually show the unread badge, it just showed a number was way off!\nTry to update OS X to 10.9.1 which makes Gmail-based accounts work better. Also, there was a stand-alone Mail Update for Mavericks which fixed the badge problem for my.\nYou probably know but it's through the App Store or Apple menu () > Software Update.\n\nA: By just switched to OS X 10.9, and by your familiarity with the environment, I assume you mean updated from a former cat (OS X) utilizing something akin to Apple's Migration Assistant app, found in the Utilities folder, or you moved/copied everything to the new user account during the Mavericks installation, selecting something like restore from Time Machine, transfer information from another Mac, or some variant of the Migration Assistant.\nWith that assumption in place, I've found that the migration process is less than 100% foolproof.\nFor instance, the Mail app deals with protocols and security issues that change, and rightly so.  With that said, the Mail app has had issues with using the right mail servers for the right mail messages, and quite frequently, Mail's outbox historically has had items in it that weren't going anywhere.  Anyway, the migration of the mail accounts could be suspect.\nFor your case, you should assume that the mail accounts weren't migrated properly.  A quick way to check this out before completely clearing out your current Mail settings, including accounts, and then re-adding the Mail accounts back in is to create a new user account.  When you login to that new user for the first time, don't bother setting up any iCloud tools/apps, including the Mail app.  Just cancel out of all setup and start using your new account.  Once logged in completely into the new account, start the Mail app, then add in the accounts that are problematic.  See if the new account's Mail performs as expected.  If all is well with the new OS X account's view of your extern Google mail accounts, then it's time to go back to the problematic account, remove the mail accounts, and then add them back in.  You may even want to backup your ~/Library/Preferences to somewhere Mavericks cannot access them (a tar or zip archive file, for instance), and then delete the Mail related .plist files in that folder - the ones specific to you as specified with this command:\nls ~/Library/Preferences/*mail*\n\nWhen you are working with these .plist files, make sure you exit out of the Mail app first, or else Mail will recreate some or all of those files with the same contents soon after you archive and delete them.\nPlease update this question with a comment so we know how things go, and if this is the right approach to fix the badge issue.\n", "Q: Why does a iPhone better than Galaxy?

The setting you refer to above only applies when you sync your phone from iTunes, either via USB or Wi-Fi.

I have a SSD (Boot Partition) and a HDD (Data) for my Mac.\nI only bought a 128GB SSD thinking the boot partition wouldn't need a large drive, however I was mistaken.\nI find that Mail and MobileSync folders in my Library directory take the majority of the storage on my SSD sometimes even bringing 'Low Disk Space' prompt if I don't watch it for a while and let it loose.\nI wanted to know if I use symlinks to create the following directories in another location would they work correctly or cause problems?\n~/Library/Mail\n~/Library/MobileSync\n\nA: I would recommend using mountpoints instead of symbolic links, but symbolic links will work.\nFor example, I have a small SSD as a boot drive and a PCIe SSD for my /Users partition on my Mac Pro.\nI copied over the data and added the following to my /etc/fstab file.\nLABEL=Users /Users  hfs rw,auto\n\n\"Users\" is the name of the partition known to Disk Utility and \"/Users\" is the mount point.\nThis is a lot cleaner than symbolic links, as many tools will not follow symbolic links without being told explicitly to do so, to avoid cyclic links.\nIn your case, you might want to create a separate partition for ~/Library and move everything over.  You may also want to create separate partitions for Mail and for MobileSync.\nAll of that said, symlinks will very likely work in these two cases.  However, keep in mind that you're moving directories that have both a high rate of change and a lot of data, which is the worst case for a spindle.  Expect iOS backups to be slower and for Mail operations such as \"search\" and opening attachments to take a little longer.\n\nA: I realize this is a few-months-old question now, but I thought I might add how I handle this exact problem.  \nI have a self-installed SSD for my system drive on my mbp and the 750GB HDD that came with the system is used as a data drive.  Basically I just changed the locations of the entire User directories to the HDD using system preferences (go to Users & Groups, unlock it, right-click the account name, and select advanced options) then moved the files over manually.  This is simpler to maintain and I've had none of the potential  issues with symlinks that Art Taylor described in his answer.\nThis does leave the root /Library directory on the SSD (as opposed to ~/Library) -- I've also had the need with a few apps like MainStage that can add gigs of content to their libs to create symlinks exactly as you describe.  In this case it certainly feels safer to do this on a case-by-case basis.\n", "Q: How do I fix my iPhone 4? I am currently having problems with my iPhone. So it froze last night and went completely black. so I left it for a while, hoping it would un-freeze. then all of a sudden it turned off and I tried to turn it back on and no luck. So, I took the battery out (as the back was already coming off) and put it back in. And the only thing its doing now is the apple is coming up every time I put in on charge. I left it on charge over night and all day today but nothing has happened. What is the reason for this and how can I fix this?\n\nA: Plug the device onto a PC and try restoring it with iTunes. If that doesn't work I suggest taking it to an offical Apple(the damaged back and the battery coming off most probably is causing issues).\n", "Q: Checkered pattern on itunes? my friend and I who live in different states wanted to watch a movie. We both rented out a movie on iTunes together. We used Skype to screen share, but on my friend's end she sees a checkered pattern. Why is that? Is there any way around it?\n\nA: I'd assume that's some kind of DRM (Digital Rights Management) protection. I recall from the early days, when Macs still had optical drives and a DVD player app, that if you tried to take a screenshot while the DVD player was visible, even as you saw a frame of the movie there, it came out black in the screenshot. So I guess these kinds of countermeasures go a long way and Apple has no intention of removing them.\nAs for a way around it, I suppose site policy frowns upon discussing what is effectively piracy (even if you try to argue this might be fair use, which I might actually concede).\n", "Q: Can I create a Mavericks installation in VMWare Fusion and migrate that to the native disk? My current installation has become kind of cluttered and I want to create a fresh one in VMWare. When the one in VMWare has everything I need, I'd like to migrate it to the native disk, so it become my main (normal) OS.\nIs that possible?\n\nA: Make a Time Machine backup from within the VM and use this to restore the native machine once you've re-installed OS X there..\nI do not know if all drivers are installed at all times (doesn't happen for Windows) so I would be a bit wary of using cloned disks to do this.  Much rather let Time Machine do what it is designed for.\n", "Q: Open an Application after minimized to dock with shortcut? Is it possible to open a minimized Application in dock with a shortcut? Or maybe something like: Open last minimized Application in dock with shortcut?\n\nA: This should do the trick:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to the minimized Application by doing\nCommand+Tab\n\n*While still holding Command press Option\n\n*Release both keys. Or just Command for that matter. \n\n", "Q: How to remove old identities from Mail? I previously had four e-mail accounts (and thus four identities) set up in the Mail app. I have now removed two of these accounts but when I compose a new e-mail the \"From\" drop-down box still lists four identities.\nHow do I remove the identities from the removed accounts?\n\nA: Apparently removing the file\n~/Saved Application State/com.apple.mail.savedState\nresolved Daniel's problem without resorting to a factory reset.\nMac OS X is great for saving your progress but once in a while that savedState file causes these types of problems.\nHappy Day!\n\nA: That is interesting because I currently have 8 email accounts with only 4 of them \"enabled\" in the Mail preferences.\nWhen I go to the new mail>from drop-down box I only see the four accounts that I have enabled.\nSo, you may have a damaged preferences file.\n1) Double check that you have deleted the old accounts in the Preferences>Accounts.\n2) Make sure you have deleted the old accounts' outgoing mail servers from your servers list in Preferences>Accounts>Outgoing Mail Server>Edit SMTP Server List\n3) Try using disk utility to repair the drive and repair permissions on the off chance that a file is damaged and can be repaired. Shut down all other applications first.\n4) If these fail then you could delete the preferences plist file from your preferences folder. But this may require you to re-enter some of your information in Mail. (Try just moving the plist to the trash first though with Mail not running, then re-open Mail. That way you can move it back if it does not have the desired result.)\n", "Q: Installing OS X 10.7 on new HDD from DVD I have a macbook A1181 model core2 duo3.1.3gb RAM. I lost my old HDD so I bought a new harddrive. Since I lost my old HDD I do not have the option to clone the old drive to the new drive. Mac OS X 10.7 DVD is available.\nI tried installing Mac OS X onto the new 320GB HDD by pressing the \"option\" key. It only showed Mac OS X DVD drive in the startup screen. It did not show the HDD. So I clicked Mac OS X DVD icon. After loading I got the error:\n\"There was a problem installing Mac OS X. Reinstall again\"\n\nThen I selected Disk Utility and formatted my new HDD as OS X Journaled. Afterwards I tried again. I inserted Mac OS X 10.7 DVD into an external DVD drive (Inbuilt DVD drive is faulty). I pressed the power button then held the option(Alt) key. It was the same as before. There was no HDD listed in startup.\nHow can I install Mac OSX onto my new HDD?\n\nA: Hard drives or DVDs that do not have a filesystem on them will not show up on startup with the option key held down. So, the HDD won't show up on startup because you don't have Mac OS X installed on it yet.\n1) Restart with the the option key held down. If there is a system disk connected to the Mac it will show up on the screen. In this case, the install DVD should show up.\n2) Select the install DVD and push the return key.\n3) Try to install Mac OS X from the DVD to the HDD by following the installer instructions.\n4) If the install fails, your install disk may be damaged.

I think this happens because your version of macports was not built for mavericks, and therefore doesn't know where the tools (such as gnutar) actually are. There are different versions of macports 2.2.1, depending on your version of OS X.\nYou should reinstall macports (for mavericks) from the binary here: https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.2.1-10.9-Mavericks.pkg\nyou should probably also run xcode-select --install\n\nA: I had a similar problem, but the log file indicated my C compiler was not working.  xcodebuild -license solved the problem, though I had previously agreed to the license. \n\nA: Just solved for me opening XCode and agree.\n", "Q: Dates format in Message's chat.db I'm working on improving my iMessages backup-script. /Users/Kyro/Library/Messages/chat.db has a table message with all the messages an some dates. \nAny idea what's the date format ? I first thought of a timestamp (I have for example 408978598) but date -r 408978598 return a date in 1982.\n\nA: To add on to @Matthieu's helpful answer, here's how to convert it within SQLLite:\ndatetime(date + strftime('%s','2001-01-01'), 'unixepoch')\n\nFor example:\nselect\n  is_from_me,\n  datetime(date + strftime('%s','2001-01-01'), 'unixepoch') as date_utc,\n  text\nfrom message;\n\n\nA: I found that as of High Sierra, I needed to use a different date transformation. The 8 extra 0's on the date field versus the date_read field was the clue:\ndatetime(message.date/1000000000 + strftime(\"%s\", \"2001-01-01\") ,\"unixepoch\",\"localtime\") \n\n\nA: well using coreUtils date : \nI found what I was looking for : \n$gdate -ud \"2001-01-01 + 408978598 seconds\" \nTue Dec 17 13:09:58 UTC 2013\n\nIt's a timestamp with base date January 1st, 2001. \n\nA: In the script you are referring to, you can achieve timestamping like so: datetime(date + strftime('%s', '2001-01-01 00:00:00'), 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as date from message--to get in in local time if that's what you are looking for. \n", "Q: Single-user mode, data recovery, mount usb I have a crashed hard drive. I had no luck with a USB to SATA using MacDrive Pro. I can get the drive to drop into shell with single user mode when I boot the drive. \nCan I mount a USB drive or something to copy data off?\nI tried /usr/sbin/diskutil mount but I got a framework not being available due to single-user mode.\nHow can I back the data up?\n\nA: You may also want to consider the Recovery partition if it's accessible.  Use CMD+R at boot to launch into Recovery mode.  This would let you mount a USB stick or even a network connection to transfer files.  \nIf you do have another computer available, you could boot this Mac into Target Disk Mode by holding the \"T\" key down at boot when you see the Apple logo.  This would allow you to then use the FireWire or Thunderbolt connection to plug your computer into another as a disk drive.\n\nA: Yes you can manually mount drives while in single user mode.  This guy has a pretty good write up.  Note that you may have to call some bins via absolute paths (for example /usr/bin/rsync)\nhttp://alvinalexander.com/mac-os-x/mac-osx-single-user-mode-usb-drive\n\nA: Forgive me if I don't fully understand but the drive that has died is the boot drive which contains the data and is what you are using to access single user mode correct?\nIf that is the case, see if you can get another computer to create a USB boot drive and connect that to your Mac and boot from it by holding the \"Option\" key ⌥ when the apple logo appears and selecting the drive (on new systems select \"UEFI\").\nFrom there you can try some terminal commands to try and recover your data, or if you have an external drive handy you can install Mac onto it and boot from that. From there you have the entire Mac operating system to recover your data from the drive with a fully functioning disk utility with GUI obviously.\nHope this helps and good luck!\n", "Q: Can I use the Lightning to Micro USB Adapter and connect a keyboard? Can I use Apple's Lightning to Micro USB Adapter with the iPod touch 5th generation to connect a Micro USB keyboard?\n\nA: No, the Lightning to Micro USB adapter will only allow you to use micro USB cables to charge and sync your device.\n", "Q: iterm - what's the key-combo to switch panes? I've learned how to split my terminal windows with apple-d and apple-shift-d.  Its very useful.\nHow do I then switch between the two panes (see below) using the keyboard?\nI know I can use the mouse but would like to know if there's a key combo to do it.\n\nA: ⌘+⌥+←/↑/→/↓ will let you navigate split panes in the direction of the arrow, i.e. when using ⌘+D to split panes vertically, ⌘+⌥+← and ⌘+⌥+→ will let you switch between the panes.\nNote: ⌥ is the [alt] key\n\nA: Here are some useful keyboard shortcuts for iTerm navigation:\n\n*\n\n*⌘+← and ⌘+→ navigates among tabs.\n\n*⌘+[number] navigates directly to a tab.\n\n*⌘+⌥+[number] navigates directly to a window.\n\n*⌘+⌥+←/↑/→/↓ navigates among split panes.\n\n*⌘+] and ⌘+[ navigates among split panes in order of use.\n\n\nA: I often find it easier to map Cmd+\"number\" to one of the panes. You can do this by pressing Cmd+, to navigate the iTerm Preferences, then go to Keys > Navigation shortcuts. In \"Shortcut to choose a split pane\", choose Cmd+\"number\". Then if you have three panes, you can navigate to each of them with Cmd+1, Cmd+2, and Cmd+3 respectively.\n", "Q: How to redirect MacBook Pro audio to my TV? I just connected my MacBook Pro 2013 to my TV using HDMI. The visuals are working, but the TV does not get the audio from my MacBook. How can I redirect the audio from my MacBook to my TV?\n\nA: Hold the Option key and click on the Volume/Sound icon on your Menu Bar.  When you're connected via HDMI, you should have an option show in the local menu to select that connection to feed the audio through rather than the standard audio output.\n\nA: If you've removed the Sound menu bar item, you can also change the output device through System Preferences → Sound → Output. There, you can change it by selecting it from the list.\n", "Q: How to disable the MacBook screen when connected to TV via HDMI How can I disable the MacBook screen when it is connected to my TV via HDMI?B\n\nA: You can use your MacBook in clamshell mode, which disables the internal display, by closing the lid when your Mac is connected to the display (and AC power is connected). You can then use an external keyboard and mouse to use the computer.\nOpening the lid restores the internal display, however you can set it so that the display stays disabled after opening using the following boot argument, then reboot once to enable the new setting:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"iog=0x0\"\n\nReset using sudo nvram -d boot-args or by resetting NVRAM by booting with ⌘⌥PR.\n\nA: This is an old question, but I would like to add another solution for it.\nInstead of disabling the screen with a software setting (and having to disable the newly introduced csrutil through recovery mode) and maybe having it not work, you can simply place a very weak magnet (like a fridge magnet) between the keyboard and the headphone jack. \nCredit to reddit user raif_, who also posted a youtube vid showing the exact procedure.\n", "Q: How can I rename an ordered list of files with an ordered list of file names?

The files will always be in the correct numbered order, but not always the same names (the first series will be 001.jpg-292.jpg, then 293.jpg-584.jpg, etc.). The supplied names will be the same for the files in all 16 folders.\nI see that this is possible (and quite easy!) with apps like A Better Finder Rename, but I'm not keen on spending the $20 on all those features just to do one thing which I don't expect I'll ever have to do again :D\nSo, is there some kind of free option, like Automator, an Applescript, or a shell script?\nI've found several shell scripts that repeat the same action for all files, but I don't know enough to edit them and supply a new name for each rename operation. :(\nEven if I have to make a script that's 292+ lines long, hard-coding the name list into it, that would be easier than manually renaming them all in finder one-by-one!\n\nA: For example save this file as filenames.txt:\napple\nbanana\norange\n\nThen open Terminal and run:\na=($(<filenames.txt));for d in *;do i=0;for f in $d/*;do echo mv $f $d/${a[i++]}.jpg;done;done\n\nRemove echo if the output looks right.\nIf the file names contain spaces, add IFS=$'\\n'; to the start and add double quotes around the variables.\n\nA: What I have done:\n\n*\n\n*Paste the list of old names into the second column of a spreadsheet.\n\n*Paste the list of new names into the third column\n\n*verify the pair matching is correct\n\n*put mv into every cell of the first column\n\n*if any file name contains spaces, escape them with \\\n\n*paste the entire contents of the spreadsheet into a script\n\n*if not using zsh, change all the tabs to space\n\n*chmod o+x on the script\n\n*run the script\n\n", "Q: How do I stop file types from launching automatically Is there a way to remove the 'open with' default that is on certain file types?

The lsregister command can be used to manipulate that database. As far as I've been able to gather, you can only unregister an entire application, not an association for a specific file type. You can do that with this command:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -u /Applications/<appname>.app\n\nBut note that there is an automatic process in OS X that searches the /Applications folder and registers the applications it finds there. So if you have an application that wants to open a certain file type, the association might get recreated even if you have unregistered the application.\nSomeone may have a better answer than this but hopefully this will be at least a little helpful.\n\nA: I see what you are asking, but I think your solution is actually somewhere different.

Sor far I could not find a way the this location to the dropdown menu or add a launcher to the panel.\n\nA: To answer your first question:\nIf you control-click (right-click) on an SVG file, select \"Get Info\" from the menu.  A window will open, with several sections.  One is \"Open with:\".  You may need to click the triangle next to it, but you should see a selector where you can choose the program which should open the file when it is double-clicked.\n\nSince you want the same behavior for all .SVG files, press the \"Change All...\" button, and it should work.\n", "Q: How can I force Mac OS X 10.9 to see the ethernet port of my hub (Asix AX88179)? I already downloaded (and installed !) the latest file from ASIX.com, which is the latest to this day, but System Information does not list the port as being available when I connect the USB 3 Hub directly to the USB 3 port of my MBP.\nMike Ohlsen wrote here that when plugging the hub into another USB Hub, and not directly into his Mac, then OS X does detect the ethernet interface and displays the device in the System Information.\nI can confirm this.

(video corruption, unstable) I have a 24\" Early 2009 iMac.\nDuring \"intensive\" use (such as Photoshop, WebGL, etc.), the system starts to become very unstable, resulting in bizarre graphics corruption and other weird behaviour. Ultimately, the machine freezes or crashes.\nSomehow I managed to take a screenshot just before it went down, and I was surprised that it captured the carnage. I've censored (blurred out) some names to protect the innocent, but all the other glitches are part of the corruption.\nI ran a temperature monitor in the background during use, and although it increased (as expected), it didn't seem to show unusually high readings for any components. \nAnyone have any idea what could be wrong? Should I try reinstalling OS X from scratch, or is this definitely a hardware issue? \n\nSetup:\n\n\n*\n\n*2.93 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo\n\n*4GB RAM\n\n*GeForce GT 120 256 MB\n\n*OS X 10.8 (upgraded from Leopard, then Snow Leopard)\n\n\nEDIT:\nHaving said that the components' temperatures seemed well behaved, I have started to notice that the problem occurs more readily when my room is warmer. Wondering if it is a heat-related problem... \nEDIT 2:\nReinstalled OS X from scratch, but problem persists. I think this indicates a hardware problem. Sadface. Will open it carefully, hoping I'll find a busted fan or something silly like that. Otherwise, will take it to the shop - not keen to mess about with hardware even though it's out of warranty as the machine is still worth a fair bit I'd say.\n\nA: Backup first! Copy all your essential files, and make a Time Machine backup if possible.\nIt can be about software or hardware, it's hard to say.\nI would first recommend creating a new user account and try there.\nThen, reset NVRAM and SMC and try if that help.\nThe last good solution is Safe Mode and cleaning cache with apps like CCleaner or CleanMyMac.\nThe bad solution is just installing Mountain Lion on the same partition without cleaning your old system. If that doesn't work, upgrade to Mavericks and try. If that still doesn't work, you might need to do a clean install.\n[EDIT: You can also just install to an external drive.]\nPlease remember to backup your Mountain Lion installation app if possible, or you might need to find is somewhere else later.\nIf all those above doesn't work, you might have to send it in for repair.\nEDIT: Try BootCamp and run a benchmarking tool which pushes your CPU and/or GPU to the limit. That will show if it's a hardware problem.\nUPDATE: Check out this Apple Discussion Thread, there's apparently people having problem like yours.\nThere's also a guide to testing your memory, something you can do if you want to.\n\nA: It's quite likely that this issue is caused by hardware (a failing GPU, most likely) but there's a possibility that it's caused by software.\nTo figure out where the problem lies, boot your computer into a clean install (either Mac OSX/Linux/Windows on a bootable drive, or use your \"install Mac OS\" install disk/partition). If you experience any kind of problems while using a clean install of any OS, you know the problem is hardware.\nYou should run a backup as soon as possible, then replace your GPU (Guide) (or take it for a repair). Only attempt to repair it yourself if you completely understand the instructions, if you're unsure, a self-repair may cause more damage\nIf there are no problems while using a clean OS, the easiest way to fix the problem would be to reinstall Mac OSX; remember to backup your files first so you don't lose anything. \n\nA: Installing the system from scratch isn't the best case. What I would recommend is if you have a spare external drive. Give it a partition of 25 GB or so and install an OS on it. Do not transfer any files into the new OS on the external. Instead you can open several applications (Grapher.app) and try to stress out the GPU and CPU through an external system. If the issue reoccurs then you are looking at most likely a GPU/video card issue some rare cases MLB. \nIf the issues don't come up then you most likely have a software issue or corrupted HD. If you have the DVDs that came with your mac then inserting the disk that has the Apple Hardware Test (it is printed on the disc) and boot the computer holding D. This will boot the iMac into Apple Hardware Tests and you can perform an extended test sequence.\nWorse case you try an external system or AHT and the computer freezes or corrupts the video. Any AASP or Apple Store has more diagnostics tools to help troubleshoot. Be warned/advised There is a limit to how long a unit is eligible for service and how long parts are available so if the iMac is worth a few hundred bucks take it in to get checked and fixed. Before going in though, please have a backup all the files you need. I have over 6 years experience as Apple Certified Mac Technician so if you need any further clarification please let me know. I am being brief but as accurate as possible to make sure you waste as little time as possible.\n\nA: Speculated diagnosis: \nI have seen this happen in quite a few macs since the switch to Intel architecture. Like what some others have suggested, I believe this is 90% most likely the initial stages of hardware failure (your GPU), and is directly related to cooling issues. In my experience, no amount of fresh-installing or hard drive replacing is going to fix this. \nIt is interesting to note that this is occurring on your NVIDIA hardware, as I have usually only seen the ATI chips fail. The cause behind this could be a flawed/abnormal manufacturing process or could be due to improper heat sink seating or inadequate thermal paste. \nUnfortunately, it looks like you are going to be due for a repair soon. Your options there are either to replace the entire logic board (as others have stated, the GPU is soldered on), or have it repaired or \"reflowed\", a process where the logic board is removed and heated so all the solder melts and re-flows in an attempt to fix any shoddy contacts.\nPossible fixes:\nThere are a couple band-aid type solutions you can try that I have had luck with in the past. Firstly, download a fan control app such as SMCFanControl, and set your fans to run at 100% all the time. It makes the machine noisier, but helps keep your mac cooler and more often under that magic threshold of it going berserk (on my old MBP it was 160F). \nThe second solution is to take the machine apart and re-apply the thermal paste and re-seat the heatsinks. It can be difficult if you haven't done that type of thing before but it is rewarding when it all comes back together. Obviously if you can afford it, it's best to take it to a repair shop (apple-approved only please!) and have them do it. They should only charge you about an hours' worth of labor and maybe a dollar or so for the drop of thermal paste they use. \n\nA: I have this problem with my very similar iMac, which is why I'm trying this. I can't offer good news, I'm fairly certain it is a hardware problem and the fix is to replace or repair the card. For me that didn't seem worth the effort, given what I do with it so I'm making it an ssh server and have purchased a souped up mini to be my GUI workstation.\nI tried most of the workarounds suggested here. Booting in safe mode, problem still there. Running the fan at high speed, no change. Fresh OS install, still there.\nThe only thing that ever seemed to make any difference, and not enough to be any real difference was that if I pulled the power cord and let it sit for a while, the next time I booted the amount of time before the troubles seemed a bit longer.\nEverything I've read suggests that the problem is with solder somewhere in the system. It was poorly applied in the first place and wear and tear of heating and cooling has made it flaky.\nDo you get errors in your console logs about problems with GL?\n\nA: Backup is needed obviously. First backup, then sending it to Apple is recommended but if you do not wish to, you can disassemble it yourself. Clean it, and most importantly, you need to take out the ram and put it back in, the same with the heat sink covering your processors. The problem should lie with overheat and unstable ram.\n\nA: The problem is your GFX/GFC Graphics Card. For many 2009 iMac's or macbook's this problem has occured. If you want to replace the part yourself, check out this thread right here : http://www.pcworld.com/article/225823/how_to_upgrade_your_graphics_card.html\nAlso make sure you want to buy the correct Graphics Card : https://www.google.com/#q=Graphics+Card+Mac&safe=active&tbm=shop\n\nA: It was happening also on my old MacBook Pro.\nI have solved upgrading my RAM from 4GB to 8GB, because I've noticed that it was happening more often when I'd opened a lot of applications, and my free RAM was near to zero.\n(It can happen due to shared memory with GPU)\n\nA: I have similar problem with my iMac. Took it to Apple Store and was advised to stop using Google Chrome as it is the cause.\n\nA: It's your graphic cards. Try updating them. http://www.apple.com/mac/\nOS X 10.9 is only seen with this glitch. Also, download Adobe Player 11 or 12 beta. There might be a option at http://www.adobe.com\nAlso, use Safari or install Firefox, they are known as the fastest.\n", "Q: OS X Mavericks Guest Mode with Filevault → Safari flickers + crashes Did anyone tried out the Guest Account feature in Mac OS X Mavericks with Filevault2 = on?\nI did and\n- Safari flickers (like with wrong graphic driver) → https://discussions.apple.com/message/23784151#23784151\n- Safari / the complete system crashs and freezes on several websites.\nSummary it's not usable! :(\nDoes anyone have similar issues?\nWho does know a solution or has an idea to get the bug?\nThank you!\n\nA: The Guest account only appears on the FileVault 2 pre-boot login screen if iCloud's Find My Mac is enabled.

Also, you cannot gift a free app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a better way to do all this?\n\n\nNot really, you should just advise the purchaser to \"buy\" (It's free, so no cost) a copy of Mavericks against his own ID, such that it can be used for restores etc in future and to ensure that he owns a copy legitimately.  He should be able to purchase it on a machine that is already running it, simply by logging into the App store with an ID that has not already purchased it.  It may kick off a pointless download which can be cancelled, but it will get him square from a licensing terms perspective, and from a safety/recoverability perspective.\n\nA: I would say first restore it and then sell it. You dont need to give you apple id. Also for updates, you don't need Apple id. If nobody buy it, I know a website that buy these MacBooks. I sold mine with damaged logic board for $220.

Presently is is extremely hard to find audio files in large libraries.  Previously you could search the entire library and subfolders handily via the filtering search methodology.  Now this is entirely obliterated and I struggle finding things handily as before.  I have complained to Apple several times now both on Radar and standard feedback, but it seems that they have no interest in listening to user feedback now.\nNow with that rant out of the way, I have been searching for quite some time for an option to replace iTunes, but nothing has proven satisfactory.  I had quite hoped for Vox to fill the space, but its iTunes library search function is broken and seems to not be able to recuperate over the last few updates.  I have tried every other piece of software that I've seen on MacUpdate so far as well, but again nothing has filled the void.\nWhat software are you finding fills the feature problems that the recent iTunes updates have created, if any?  If everyone else is like me I believe I'm going to write an iTunes-like app that puts the functionality back whilst reading iTunes libraries.\n\nA: I know this is not very pro-Apple of me, but I would definitely recommend Google Play.  Unless you happen to have more than 20,000 songs, you can upload all your music to your own Google Play library, and then access it on any device.  I had used iTunes previously because I wanted a service that allowed me to easily access my music on any device, but since Google released an iOS app that problem was solved.\nSpeaking of which the usability of the UI on the web front end and on the iOS app in my opinion is great and very intuitive.  Searching is done almost instantly, and it also returns results from the google play store, which is super nice for me since I now have their streaming service. ($10 a month, otherwise Google Play is free)\nAnyway, Google Play is a great replacement if you don't mind having your music pushed to the Google Cloud.  It also serves as its own backup...\nThe only issue I had when switching was with some of Apple's old DRM from a very early version of iTunes... I can't remember how far back, but the issue was only with a very few amount of songs.\n", "Q: Apps using the camera API crash after taking a picture on an iPhone 4S running iOS 7 Ever since I updated to iOS 7 in June, I have been having issues using the camera on my phone in apps other than the default Camera app. Regardless of settings, using my camera in any non-Apple app (such as Instagram or Tumblr) will result in that particular app crashing immediately. I have tried everything to remedy the issue short of a full restore on my phone. I'm convinced it's some sort of low memory or high CPU utilization issue, since iOS 7 seems to be much more taxing on my phone's resources than iOS 6 was. Is there some way to fix this issue without simply buying a newer, faster iPhone?\n\nA: Rebooting always fixes the problem for me.\nAs for permanent solutions, haven't tried this myself but this comment has a possible solution (pre-iOS 7 however iOS users have reported success):  http://www.iphoneincanada.ca/how-to/how-to-fix-iphone-camera-roll-crash-and-photos-turned-to-other-in-itunes/#comment-347059180\n\nA: A full restore of your phone might be needed if you aren't keen to clear out the camera roll of all photos.\nThese crashes are not unheard of, but they also are not affecting most of the devices in the wild.\nYou could probably reset your camera roll following this thread and avoid having to start over with a full wipe of the device:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I reset the camera roll to photo IMG_0001.jpg on iOS?\n", "Q: Is there a music app that lets me start/pause playback by tapping anywhere on screen?

I'm watching now as Memory Pressure increases after copying the data from Safari. If I try and paste the data into Excel, Excel won't take it. After several minutes and a very sluggish iMac, memory is freed up (subtracting memory used from Physical memory) and I can paste the data without a problem.\nIt looks as though the iMac is trying to shuffle memory around (the compression, I believe?) and until it shuffles it I can't do anything with the data I copied.\nThe iMac only has 4gb RAM, as the geniuses said that was more than enough. It always has been until Mavericks.\niMac is 27-inch, Mid 2011.\nI was going to purchase more memory until coming across posts detailing sluggishness after installing Mavericks.\nNow I'm not sure if the problem lies with Mavericks or memory. If I installed 16GB, would the same thing happen? Would the OS still use as much RAM as possible and need to \"shuffle\" memory around in order to free enough up to finish my copy and paste?\n\nA: My recommendation would be install mavericks again. I upgraded both my Mac's and had problems with sluggish performance and app's not responding. \n\nA: I would be more concerned with Excel and the version of Microsoft Office you're running. Ensure you have the latest version of Office 2011, currently at least 14.3.9 (English version) to be compatible with Mavericks.\nAlso, depending on what you are copying/pasting, you can try \"Paste Special...\" in Excel and select \"Text\" so you only get clean text and not any extra formatting from Safari.\n\nA: \nYou can try one out of two.. first, try with a different browser...\n  Safari isnt the only  way out and Seconed, I agree with @Mark Anderson \n  double check with the excel version..\n\nHave you installed all the updates apple requires on the app store after upgrading to mavericks?\n\nI have a macbook air with a 4gb RAM & works fine with mavericks, \n  increasing ur RAMS  could still be a possibility give it a try,\n  but leave it as a last option...\n\n\nA: As bizarre as it seems i just installed Mav and then had all the probs listed here- so i ran a repair permissions on utility and now it seems fine- 1GB out of 4 is spare on average use- Memory Clean is a big help in spring cleaning RAM of any unnecessary use :-)  \n", "Q: What's the cause of GPU panics on macbook pro mid 2010? I've had quite a lot of GPU panics lately, and after asking about it here and in other places, people told me that it is a problem with many macbooks from mid 2010. I've also heard that this happens when the mac switches from the internal GPU to the external, so I unchecked the 'automatic graphics switching\" box in my energy settings. Still, the problem remains.\nWhat I find so annoying is that the crashes are so unpredictable. I'm often using my mac for hours at a time, doing quite a bit of GPU intensive stuff like watching HD video. Because of my visual impairment, I'm also using the zoom feature, which I imagine also uses the GPU. But I can't see any pattern in it. What exactly triggers these problems, and are there ways to avoid crashes?\n\nA: Suggested problem tracing /and repair) steps (after each test the performances).\nSome applications will force use the Nvidia card (without automatic switching).\nYes the ZOOM feature adds stress to the GPU.\n\n\n*\n\n*Vacuum clean the inside of your Mac to improve cooling.\n\n*Google and Install gfxCardStatus, Leave on Dynamic Switching. From there it will Monitor and Alert you to what apps switch you to the Nvidia Graphic Card.\n\n*Also open the Activity monitor - Energy tab, where you can see when the Nvida card kicks in, and does it switch on/off irregularly.\n\n*Monitor your Console log for irregular (fast)GPU switching.\n\n*Do some hardware testing: \n\nGpuTest is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux and Max OS X) GPU stress\n  test and OpenGL benchmark. GpuTest comes with several GPU tests\n  including some popular ones from Windows'world (FurMark or TessMark).\n\n\n\n*\n\n*worst case remove the Nvidia card, and go without it.\n\n\nA: Only way to fix Mac Book Pro 15 Mid 2010 by software is older\ngfxCardStatus 1.8.1(download site: https://software.com/mac/apps/gfxcardstatus/1.8.1 or whenever you find it)\ndon't try newer versions !!!! it will no work.

Now the question is, Is it also the same when you restore/wiped the iPhone? Will it automatically enable the Location Services after being restored (as long as they will connect it online)? \n\nA: The only thing that matters on iOS 7 is whether you have fine my phone enabled. Also, you can't turn off location services when you have find my phone active. \nIf so, you can't get iTunes or the device to erase itself unless you enter the password for iCloud account that is enrolled.\nIf you do factory erase it, it still won't re-activate unless the iCloud password is entered. So, to answer your question - location services is likely not re-enabled since the device lock prevents activation of the OS and opting in to location services before the wipe. It would either require access to the source code or servers from Apple to know if location is tracked in is case, but my intuition is no. \nIf you enable lost mode, that locks the device, but it still is traceable and can be located. Just as if you didn't enter lost mode. \nIf you erase the device, that removes the data and tracking ability once it connects to the Internet and receives the self-destruct message. It still displays the lost message, but you can't track it. \n\nA: If the phone is wiped and a new iCloud account is used it is not possible to track a phone. In that kind of scenario it's best to report your IMEI to the police (along with your old iCloud account) and they will be able to track it down.

Safari version 6.1, MacOS 10.8.5\n\nA: Ok, I found it - it does not let me save page until it is fully loaded! \nWhich is painfully slow sometimes, comparing to Chrome.\nAs far as I can see, Chrome still lets me save page even if it is not complete and even when I just started loading it still works with previous page!\nSo I can still save the previous page after mistakenly clicking on a link.\n\nA: I'm not sure on the why but if you use Cmd+S, the Export dialog pops up as expected (After that, Save As... is once again available.

The iMac is also thunderbolted to my Mac mini.\nWhen I press meta-(fn-)F2, the following happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iMac screen goes dark.\n\n*The Thunderbolt display shows the Mac mini's (locked) screen.\n\n*I can move the mouse on the Thunderbolt display but not click at anything.\n\n*The keyboard doesn't work (except meta-F2).\n\n\nWhen I press meta-F2 again, this happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both screens go back to being screens of the iMac.\n\n*The screens switch places and the Thunderbolt display becomes the primary display with the Dock.\n\n\nI am at a loss as to how I am supposed to use this feature.\nAre mouse and keyboard supposed to travel with the screen?\nWhy does the Mac mini screen appear on the secondary display?\nWhy do the screens switch places when I switch back from TDM?\nUpdate: The iMac is a late 2013 iMac running 10.9 (no updates). The Mac mini was new a few months ago and came with (and still runs) 10.8(.6 I think).\n\nA: This Apple KB article will help answer some of your questions:\nTarget Display Mode: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nFrom what you're describing, I think what is happening is that the Thunderbolt Display is acting like a regular display for the iMac, while the iMac is acting as a TDM for mini. Thus, the signal for the mini ends up on the Thunderbolt Display (since it's considered \"part of\" the iMac).\nAt first glance, I'd say that TDM isn't intended for multiple screens, though I'm not sure...\nTo specifically answer 1. and 2. (from list item 14 in the link above): \n\n[...]Other keyboard and mouse input is disabled on the iMac while it is in TDM[...]\n\nThis means that the keyboard and mouse need to be connected to the mini in order to work beyond presssing Cmd+F2 to exit TDM.\nIn regards to what happens when you exit TDM, that's probably just a side effect of the Thunderbolt Display being the last active display (Remember, 10.9 moves the dock to the display on which you're interacting. Makes the menu bar opaque, too).\n", "Q: Can you still track it's location after it has been wiped/erased? Can anyone clarify the process when a phone is wiped?\nLet's assume that my phone gets stolen, and the thief being unable to unlock it chooses to wipe the device via a system restore in iTunes.  Since the phone is (was) logged into my iCloud account, the thief will be unable to activate it, which should make it worthless to sell, right?\nSo, assuming a stolen phone gets restored, during subsequent setup it requires a WIFI connection prior to then logging in to the iCloud account it is locked to, so it should be contactable.  At this point, will the phone be still trackable by my icloud account using find my iphone service after being restored, even though it is not technically logged into any iCloud account? Will the custom message still be displayed to whoever has the phone?\n\nA: No, an iOS device is no longer associated with an iCloud account after it has been restored. \nIn iOS7, there is a new feature called Activation Lock[1] which prevents devices from being restored once they are associated with an account unless the correct password is used to disable the lock.\n[1]http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5818\nAfter being erased, either by you via find my phone, or buy the 'new owner' via a DFU forced restore, tracking is no longer available.\nIf the phone is put into DFU mode then iTunes will restore the phone.  However during activation, it will still require the original apple ID to activate, so the phone is useless, apart from selling for spare parts.\n", "Q: Upgrading from iPad 1 to iPad Air - restoring individual app data? I'm hoping that a jolly fat bearded mythical character will deliver me an iPad Air in a weeks time :) I currently have an original iPad 1, stuck back on iOS 5. \nIt's been jailbroken, but I don't honestly think I'll miss any of the jailbroken apps.

I'd like to keep the Air as \"clean\" as possible, and avoid dragging over a ton of legacy crap that I don't need.\nIdeally, I'd like to just restore selective apps and their data to the new iPad - of course, apps can be re-downloaded, but is there any way (with 3rd party software) to selectively restore individual app data to an iOS 7 device?\n\nA: You can backup data from apps with a program such as PhoneView (Mac) or iFunBox (Mac & Windows), and restore the data individually per app.\n\nBrowse, manage and download most any data saved by App Store apps from your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. If you're looking for a quick way to download saved recordings, videos or images from your apps, this is it.

Or if someone knows some type of workaround that can be done mac side, either from terminal or perhaps an objective-c native app I will develop them if necessary and post for all.\n\nA: I'm afraid that's not possible.\nSince all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari) all use the native Fullscreen API, you're stuck with the slow animation...\nI researched wether there were any work arounds or tricks but there doesn't seem to be. You're not alone in being annoyed.\nOnly thing you can do is to use Flash when available, or, upgrade to Mavericks where the animation is minimal and quite a bit faster. 10.9 happens to be free so the entry barrier isn't that high.\n\nA: I agree, the HTML5 videos (mainy YouTube) are horrible: eats CPU like crazy and going to fullscreen stutters.

(We both use iPhones & share an iPad.) Our new hardware setup is 27\" iMac (1TB HDD) for wife's home office, 15\" retina MacBook Pro (256GB SSD) for me, and 2TB AirPort Time Capsule. \nWhat is the best configuration for sharing photo and music libraries?\nThe photos and music are mostly (but not exclusively) mine, and I will mainly use the rMBP for any photo editing, but I would like access to the data across both machines, and my wife would also like access. I am thinking of shared libraries in public folders on the iMac as it has the larger drive, the rMBP accessing the libraries over AirPort Wi-fi, with the Time Capsule used exclusively for back-up for both Macs, or would it be worth using part of the Time Capsule as data storage for the libraries rather than solely for machine back-up?\nAll thoughts welcome!\n\nA: These two libraries will grow larger each year until your 256GB SSD will start to feel a big tight. I would recommend the following strategy:\nMusic\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't mind spending a little bit of money, you could pay for iTunes Match. We have found this an excellent way to share 120gb of music between machines which do not have enough space to store it all. You can keep the original library on the iMac (it has the room) and sync 'via the cloud' using iTunes Match to your rMBP. It caches the files you play, so any of the music that you're not that bothered about won't take up space on your SSD. This also allows you to get access to your music anywhere you have WiFi - not just at home. As you have iPhones and an iPad (or Apple TV if you get one) they can all share the same library with this mechanism at no additional cost and no synching. If you're in the US, this also gets you ad-free iTunes Radio.\n\n*If you'd rather not pay, and never play music outside of the house, you can use the iTunes Home Sharing feature as suggested by NEO.\n\n*If you'd rather not pay, but you want music outside of the house, then I suggest breaking up your libraries into music that you like, music that your wife likes and music you both like. You can keep the physical files split across the machines by having it mostly on a shared folder from your wife's iMac, but you must take great care to disable the 'Copy files to iTunes Media Folder when adding to library' option in iTunes preferences, otherwise you'll end up with duplicates. This option means you can only play the music that you both like when you are at home as it needs your home WiFi and the iMac to be on. Also, be sure to Sync your iPhones and iPad regularly.\nPhotos\n(I'm assuming you use iPhoto)\n\n\n*\n\n*Break up your photo libraries into year-by-year. It's unlikely you want to have multiple years of photos on your rMBP, so this will make editing easier too.\n\n*Store the by-year iPhoto libraries on the iMac in a shared folder.\n\n*Keep the latest library on your rMBP as you're editing it.\n\n*Use iCloud Photo Stream to keep your wife's iMac up-to-date with any new photos before you edit/take/red-eye/reject them.\n\n\nIf your iPhoto library is already a 500GB monster (like ours), you'll need to investigate tools to split it up or invest in some external hard drives to back up before you start splicing it.\n\nA: For sharing music you can use iTunes. In iTunes you can use \"Sharing Library\" for sharing your library in your local network and iTunes will do the rest. ;)\n", "Q: Discrepancy between availble space and capacity on external HD Disk Utility report (Consistent with Finder)\nMount Point :   /Volumes/partition2\nFormat :    Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\nOwners Enabled :    No  \n** Number of Folders :  10\n\nCapacity :  1.9 TB (1,900,231,068,160 Bytes)    \nAvailable : 1.9 TB (1,899,390,058,496 Bytes)\n** Used :   841 MB (841,007,104 Bytes)**\n** Number of Files :    55\n\nsudo zsh;\ndu -hs *(D)\n744K    .Spotlight-V100\n0B  .Trashes\n4.0K    .fseventsd\n\nI am unable to recover those 841 MB.

Then tried Exfat - 9MB Used. HFS+ again - 850 MB.\nMaybe it's just the case that HSF+ needs 0.05% of the drive to work as @IconDaemon pointed out. Alternatively Disk Utility is using some inefficient process to do the formatting.\n\nA: Try using Repair Disk in Disk Utility to fix any disk anomalies, or run fsck -fy / in single user mode.\n\nA: If you use the Security Options in Disk Utility and write at least one pass with zeros, that should truly delete whatever real files that are there. A disk must always use a small portion of its capacity for indexes and directory structures, but 861MB seems a bit large for that. Perhaps the drive controller has mapped out a slew of bad blocks, reducing the capacity, which could be an indication of a bum drive.\n", "Q: What happens if I upload an incomplete app on the App Store? I am in the process of creating an iPhone app. Someone, very recently, stole all my app files and I'm afraid if that person will submit my app before I do.\nCan I upload my app, without the major features and, maybe, a little unstable, to the App Store?

The problem is that one of those macs couldn't be upgraded do Mavericks (it's running Lion).\nIs there any app that I could install on a non-Mavericks mac to use it's tag system?\nIn another way: Is it possible to \"read\" Mavericks tags from a lion mac using any kind of software?\nUPDATE: Originally I mentioned Mountain Lion, but in fact, my older Mac is running 10.7.5 (Lion).\nUPDATE(2): Support at Iconic software did mentioned that their tagging software (Leap - the paid version - not Taggit, the free one) is now compatible with Mavericks and that it will try to convert native tags to their format of tagging. Since this software (Iconic Leap) is compatible with OS 10.7+ and above, it would be a tool for sharing tags between OSes versions. Will try this out and post back the result for future reference.\n\nA: Tags in Mavericks are actually partially backward compatible with labels in Mountain Lion, because they're implemented as sort of an extension (and renaming) of labels. The main issues are:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you assign multiple tags to a file in Mavericks, Mountain Lion will only see the most recent tag (label)\n\n*Tag colors aren't preserved; e.g., if a red tag in Mavericks shares the same name as a blue label in Mountain Lion (say \"Important\"), it'll appear in blue on Mountain Lion\n\n\nAll that said, why can't you upgrade your Mountain Lion system to Mavericks? The system requirements didn't change, so any machine that can run Mountain Lion can be upgraded to Mavericks.\n\nA: No, Mavericks introduced the new tagging system. http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#tags \nYou can still use tags in Mountain Lion but the features are not the same. When I upgraded my tags were still intact but I had to add titles to them.\nI found one app that you can use but they didnt list Mavericks as supported.\nhttp://www.caseapps.com/tags/\n\nA: After all, the best option that I found to achieve that (share files/folders tags between Mavericks and pre-Mavericks Macs) was to use the third-part software called \"Leap\" (Iconic Software).\nIt's far from perfect (specially when you consider the user interface and the performance of the app - which are too much complicated and \"heavy\" when compared to the Mavericks lightweight tagging system), but at least it runs on the last 3 or 4 versions of the OS.\nAs for the Mavericks labels, Leap seamed to recognize them and to convert the to it's own format (preserving the Mavericks format as well). So if something is already tagged on Mavericks it should work on Leap as soon as you run it on a Mavericks computer linked to the drive.\n", "Q: Wiping old iPhone without touch or me.com?

It allows you to set the volume up to 1000%, so if you are trying to view an unusually quiet video, you can increase the volume in IINA without having to crank up your computer's volume too much.\nIn IINA: You can set maximum volume (100-1000%) in Preference, and use ↑ to set volume larger than 100%.\n", "Q: Spilt water on Macbook keyboard Yesterday I spilt a lot of water on my Macbook pro keyboard.\nThe laptop seems to work fine but a few keys don't work well.\nLeft control and left shift don't work,\nLeft alt and right alt are not tested. \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I test if left and right Alt key work well?\n\n*This macbook pro is late 2011 version. I don't have Apple care.\nWhat is the most recommended action I can take in this situation?\n\n\nPS. Right after the spilt, I pushed a lot of keys to wipe out water with paper towel,\nthen flipped it upside down. (I didn't turn it off)\n\nA: Firstly, you want to hope that was clean water, no sugars, no coffee or tea or juice etc!\nIt's a large area to dry properly but even though you might think it's dry, it's probably not yet, you may want to consider trying the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Place the laptop near a dehumidifier (preferably near the intake) to try to draw out water for several hours\n\n*Place the laptop in a highly air conditioned room, aircon removes moisture from the air, you may need to place a fan blowing air over the unit to encourage the water to become airborn\n\n*Place the unit in a sealed bin bag with a lot of salt or dry rice in it (be really careful not to get this on or in your unit, salt water will corrode your laptop like thing else, put the laptop on a cardboard shelf over the salt/rice)\n\n*If you have a load of silica gel bags (they come with loads of things, I got a particularly big one with an iMac once leave them on the keyboard and seal it in a bag to try to draw moisture out.  (Top Tip, keep a bag with silica gel bags in it, whenever you get one in something, save it!)\nAll of the above may take several attempts to work, or may simply not work.\nFinally, you can disassemble the keyboard unit, this may be to try to dry it further, or to replace if it turns out to be broken, it's not too difficult a job, lookup your model on iFixIT.\n", "Q: How to access /dev/mem in OSX? How I can access /dev/mem (or /dev/kmem, /dev/pmap) equivalent device in OSX?\nAs far as I know it was removed in some point.\nCan I create this node manually somehow or any other way of dumping the physical memory?\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*Visualization in testing a volatile memory forensic tool\n\n*Kernel Debug Kit OS X\n\nA: I think I got it to work on macOS Sierra! I downloaded comex's project:\nKmem Project\nI compiled the kext, fixed the permissions and then loaded it!\nUsing terminal I went into /dev and ls showed both mem and kmem...\nEdit: If you download the project you will just need to change the compiler in Xcode to use the latest ( for example... I don't know if other versions work though... )  For quick access to results I have already made a fork of comex's project which compiles on macOS Sierra! Kmem for Sierra Fork\nAgain, this is comex's work, not mine, I just changed the compiler setting and uploaded it! :)\n\nA: According to Accessing Kernel Memory on the x86 Version of Mac OS X, /dev/mem and /dev/kmem were removed when Apple released OS X for Intel processors.\nThe (excellent) article also explains how to reenable the memory devices, namely using the kmem=1 kernel boot argument. \nNote that, as commented below by neal, in macOS 10.15 Catalina (and probably since macOS 10.12 Sierra), NVRAM settings can only be changed when your Mac is booted into recovery mode. To enter Recovery mode, power on your Mac and immediately hold ⌘-R until the logo appears, launch Terminal from the Utilities menu in the menu bar, run:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"kmem=1\"\n\nand reboot. You should see these two devices:\n$ ls -l /dev/*mem\ncrw-r----- 1 root kmem 3, 1 2014-02-28 22:09 /dev/kmem\ncrw-r----- 1 root kmem 3, 0 2014-02-28 22:09 /dev/mem\n\n(In previous versions of macOS like OS X Mavericks 10.9.2, you can reenable the memory devices within the operating system, so simply launch Terminal, type the command above and reboot.)\nIf your Mac won't boot or you have any issues, reset the NVRAM by pressing ⌘optionPR and holding the keys down until you hear the startup sound for the second time, as explained in \"Resetting NVRAM / PRAM\" in KB HT1379 About NVRAM and PRAM.\nIf you wish to reset the argument, type sudo nvram -d boot-args and check that nvram -p | grep boot-args does not print any results.\n", "Q: Is there anything missing in an encrypted iPhone backup? As far as I understand iOS Security, Oct. 12, an encrypted backup via iTunes also backs up the keychain of the device. While I recognize that some elements might not be restorable onto a different device (non-migatory), I was wondering if anything substantial is actually missing in an encrypted backup.\nI am asking this because I heard that after wiping an iPhone, the private key of the app Threema is lost and cannot be restored via backup, even on the same device.\n\nA: Got answer from Threema support. The keys actually are included in an encrypt iTunes backup but can only be restored to the same device. That is why they advise a separate backup.\n\nHello,\nYes, encrypted iOS backups include the iOS keychain and therefore also\n  the Threema private key; however as it is stored with\n  kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly, it will additionally be\n  encrypted with the device-specific UID key. Therefore, it will only be\n  usable if restored to the same device that the backup was created on.\nBest Regards,\nThreema Support\n\n\nA: I would post this question to the support guys at Threema.\nHowever from my understanding the only way to get your private key off the iPhone is to jailbreak your device.\nHaving said that there may be a way to get it off the backup.\n\nA: From Apple Developer:\n\nThe iOS gives an application access to only its own keychain items.\nIn iOS, an application always has access to its own keychain items and does not have access to any other application’s items. The system generates its own password for the keychain, and stores the key on the device in such a way that it is not accessible to any application. When a user backs up iPhone data, the keychain data is backed up but the secrets in the keychain remain encrypted in the backup. The keychain password is not included in the backup. Therefore, passwords and other secrets stored in the keychain on the iPhone cannot be used by someone who gains access to an iPhone backup. For this reason, it is important to use the keychain on iPhone to store passwords and other data (such as cookies) that can be used to log into secure web sites.\n\nHowever it is still up to the application developer to allow the keychain to be backed up.\n", "Q: What personal finance apps work between iPhone, iPad and Mac? One of my resolutions for 2014 is to keep better track of my finances. I'd like to use an iPhone app to do this. I've used a few personal finance apps in the past, but none of them do precisely what I'm looking for. I don't need anything particularly sophisticated, just the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ability to add a new transaction with as little effort as possible. I\nwant to capture every single payment I make, so if the UI isn't up to\nscratch it will get really annoying.  I want to be able to enter how\nmuch the transaction is for, what account it's coming out of, and\nwhat category it should be filed under: i.e., \"Car\", \"Electric\", etc.\n\n*Those categories should be hierarchical, so the \"Car\" category should\ninclude subcategories called \"Gas\" and \"Servicing\"\n\n*Ability to create recurring payments\n\n*Synchronisation with iPad and Mac. Mac synchronisation is less\nimportant and I suppose I'd be satisfied with a detailed spreadsheet \ndownload, but synchronisation with iPad is a must.\nCan anyone recommend an app or two that would fit the bill?\n\nA: I used Mint.com for quite awhile and liked it. It easily pairs with most bank accounts (except ones with 2-step authentication, like I have enabled which caused me to move away from it), so most transactions are populated automatically, and even categorized automatically.\nManually adding transactions is quick, and very simple. As you can see in one of the screenshots, all one has to do is open the app, and then top the \"Compose\" icon in the lower right corner. This opens an interface which is very intuitive.\nI don't remember right off whether it allows hierarchical categories, and recurring payments, as those are not areas I specifically used, but I do know it has excellent customization of categories, and handles bills well. \nThey have a Mac app which is functional, but the online interface is probably better overall. Mint has native iPhone and iPad apps, which have the ability to lock with a passcode if so desired.\n\nA: If you prefer native and non web-based solution try Money app by Jumsoft\nhttp://www.jumsoft.com/money/\nThree client apps for Mac, iPhone, iPad.\nFeatured: subcategories, simple scheduler, sync. Should be enough for personal finances. \n\nA: PocketMoney would be perfect -- it's probably the quickest app in the App Store with regards to posting a new transaction, it has iOS and Mac OS X versions, and supports the hierarchical categories which you ask for (I use this hierarchical arrangement myself). I've been using it for 3 years, give or take a couple of weeks, to keep track of every aspect of my financial life and it has served me fairly well, even though the developer and I didn't see eye-to-eye when reporting bugs and feature requests.\nSo why do I say it would be perfect? Well, the developer responsible for the app since the beginning of time (it even had a Newton version way back when) has recently passed away, and a family member took over the company. Even though he had some experience with the codebase, he was quite clearly struggling with it, especially since there are so many ports to maintain. As a result, no one has heard from the new owner in a while, and quite a few bugs are still open and affecting many users (myself, I'm affected by this one, which often means a slowdown in posting new transactions). All of this is well documented in their forums.\nSo right now I can't, in good conscience, recommend that you start using it. Trying to migrate all your financial data later to a new app will certainly be a source of headaches, so I suggest you start with one with a less complicated history.\nSorry if this wasn't very helpful, but at least it may steer you away from an app with many bugs and very little hope of getting them fixed -- never mind what's going to happen once Apple releases a new major iOS version.\n\nA: Love Mint.... It's very useful...\nIn addition, I use 'SquareOff Now' to keep\nA running tab of expenses between friends and family....built in PayPal ....Free :-)\n", "Q: Is it possible to code a “reply” to Facebook Messages in Notification Centre in Maverick OS X? Is it possible to edit some code in Notification Center to allow Facebook messenger notifications to have a \"Reply\" or \"Close\" similar to iMessage?\n\nA: No. As of 10.9.1, Apple has not added the ability to do so, and unfortunately, you're going to need to wait on Apple to do this natively.\nI can, however, suggest an app that you can try. It's called Chat Heads and it works really well. It's available in the Mac App Store for free.\nHere's the link: https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/chat-heads/id670724330?mt=12\n", "Q: How can I check to see if my Mac is running in dual channel mode? I've just upgraded my iMac's memory with a new 2x8GB kit:\n\nAlthough I know this \"should\" be dual channel (as both banks have the same amount of RAM), I'd like to know for sure. How can I check?\n\nA: Pretty simple.  Sorry if I go through stuff that you know but... you never know.\nDual Channel\nDual channel RAM is a chipset thing. DDRx is a RAM type.  DDR2 and 3 are NOT Dual nor Tri Channel RAM...  Your motherboard/chipset determines your Dual Channel ability.\nSo look up your motherboard's specs or use Crucial's System Scanner which is good stuff.  So if you are not sure if your system supports DC you can verify that there.\nDual Channel RAM\n\"If you have a dual-channel platform and you want to take advantage of the performance gain it offers, our advice is to simply purchase your DDR or DDR2 memory in pairs. However, be very careful to order two modules with the exact same specifications; the modules must be identical to each other to perform correctly. \"\nso Dual channel only works with two SO-DIMMS with the EXACT SAME specs \nHere is more from macrumors.com/guides:\n\"All Intel Core Macs support dual channel memory access if matching modules are installed. The customary estimate is that this gives a 6% - 8% real world performance benefit. The modules do not have to be the same brand. That means it is quite possible but not 100% guaranteed, that adding a 3rd party SODIMM to an Apple supplied SODIMM of the same size will make a matched pair.\"\nVerification\nyou can click the Apple Menu at the top left, About This Mac then More Info then click System Report... click Memory on the left hand side.\nIf you want to get nuts you can use TechTool Pro (not verified on Lion) and get a very detailed report which I've attached images of below of my RAM.  This is just running a terminal command I'm sure - I just don't know it.\nPoint being is, there is not an indicator because ... if your system supports it, and the RAM is bought in identical pairs... its running Dual Channel.\nBest of luck.  \nIn the pics, all I'm doing is looking at the numbers besides the S/N and for peace of mind making sure they match.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Window Position Makes Applications Open Off-Screen | Mavericks I am having trouble with applications reopening halfway off-screen on my second display in Mavericks.\nIs this a bug? or a preferences/settings issue?\nI like many apps to launch on the second display. \nI set this by: Dock > Options > Assign to Desktop on Display 2\nThis works, but apps always remember their maximized position a few inches from the left side of the display, effectively hiding half of the window off-screen.\nIf I drag the window back to the 0,0 position and then close it, Mavericks does not remember the position the next time a new window opens.\nI've seen a few people discuss this issue, and most recommendations say to turn off 'Displays Have Separate Spaces' in Sys Pref > Mission Control.\nWhile this works, it basically brings settings back to pre-Mavericks conditions and breaks full-screen support.\nFrom what I understand, now that each display has its own spaces, Mavericks is only acknowledging the dimensions of the largest display. If one display is smaller than other, it will cut windows off when you open them on the smaller display, because it remembers a window position as if it were opening on the largest display.\nI can clarify if that doesn't make sense.\nMainly, I just want to know, is this a bug Apple has not fixed yet with Mavericks, or is there something I'm missing here? I am surprised more people are not talking about this if it is a bug.\n\nA: I have found that you can move the app window if you position the mouse over the edge to get the horizontal or vertical resize arrows.  The trick is to move the mouse horizontally if you have the vertical resize arrows or vertically if you have the horizontal resize arrows.  It is a bit tricky, but it works on Mavericks 10.9.x  This trick does not work with the diagonal resize arrows.  The trick works better if you get the resize arrows the furthest away from the window without turning back into a normal pointer.  You can practice this trick on any window, off screen or not.\n", "Q: BootChamp equivalent to go from Windows to Mac I use BootChamp to restart into Windows directly from OS X. I was wondering if there is an equivalent piece of software to restart from Windows into Mac. This will be especially useful when using remote access.\n\nA: BootChamp only sets the next boot, so to get from Windows to OS X just reboot normally!\nIt will boot into OS X by itself, since the default boot disk is still OS X.\n", "Q: Is the /Developer directory still needed for Xcode in OS X Mavericks? The new Xcode is .app and all the package contents are with it, inside the applications folder. Can I just delete /Developer?\n\nA: As of Xcode 4.3, the /Developer directory is no longer needed.\nSee: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_4_3.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/1006-SW1\n\nA: You can delete this folder. The new /Developer is located in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer, so /Developer can be deleted.\n\nA: Xcode prior to 4.3, which is when Apple transitioned to a single repackaged .app for their developer tools, also shipped with an uninstall-devtools command line utility. It takes a look at any receipts of Xcode installs on your system and reports that it's removing things like caches, as well.
