["Q: Cannot complete resetting MacBook with Sierra - HD locked. How can I unlock it? MacBook with Sierra -\nDisk utility erase completed OK - \nReinstall Sierra not possible HD is locked. \nHow can I unlock it?\n\nA: Hold down Command, Option and R when startup chime sounds, choose Mac HDD then Reinstall OSX.\n", "Q: Unable to open some games in Sierra I'm unable to open a couple of games on macOS Sierra. I recently downloaded them, and have never been able to successfully run them. Gatekeeper is already disabled. \n\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how to play these games?\nThanks\n\nA: Those look like they're Steam games. Try downloading the steam client for macos (Some games can be run without it, but most require the client)\n", "Q: Every time my three-year-old bashes the keyboard randomly my hot corners stop working. What key combo is she pressing? Whenever I make the mistake and leave my MBP unattended and unlocked for more than a minute, my three-year-old rushes in and starts randomly mashing keys on the keyboard, pretending to type.  Every time, without fail, afterward, things seem OK but the hot corners no longer work and the Dock (which I normally have set to auto-hide) will not rise up from the bottom of the screen when hovering there; I must click the mouse at the bottom of the screen, where the Dock is hiding, in order to make it rise.  Merely hovering, like usual, does not make the Dock rise.\nWhat key combination is she pressing to trigger this behavior?  And how can I turn it off without having to completely restart the computer?\n\nA: You can search through the keyboard shortcuts with System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts.\nFor me, \"Turn Dock Hiding On/Off\" is Option ⌥ Command ⌘ D\nI don't see a keyboard shortcut for enabling/disabling Hot Corners (in High Sierra), though maybe your list is different?\n", "Q: \"Allow Payments on Mac\" missing from my iPad I'm trying to set up my Macbook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) to use Apple Pay.  All of the tutorials online say you need to go into your iPhone or Apple Watch under Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay and enable the \"Allow Payments on Mac\" setting.  I have an iPad with Touch ID running iOS 12.0.1 (latest version to date), but I do not see this option under Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay.  Also, I have my Mac and iPad successfully paired together with Bluetooth.\nIs it possible to set up Apple Pay on my Mac with my iPad?\n\nA: It appears that it is not possible to use Apple Pay on a non-touch ID Macbook with an iPad.  Per this post linked below as well as Apple who specifies \"iPhone or Apple Watch\" and does not specify iPad at all in relation to older Macbooks being compatible with Apple Pay.\n", "Q: What does the layered HDR icon mean in my photos? I have the iPhone Xs and I’m interested in the Smart HDR feature. I note that it is enabled by default. However, only a handful of the photos that I have taken over the past week or two have the HDR icon. If I disable Smart HDR and take a photo before and after manually activating HDR I don’t get the icon overplayed on the resulting photo. It definitely looks like the HDR is working but I just don’t understand what the icon means.\n\nA: Older iPhones would put the 'HDR' overlay only on pictures that used HDR.\nThe iPhone XS/XS Max has some form of Smart HDR on at all times (when turned on in Settings).  You will only see the HDR overlay for times when the system had to use extreme or excessive HDR to the photo.\nIf you have Auto HDR turned on then be assured that it's apply Smart HDR to your pictures.\n", "Q: Why do I have a calendar called weather? And has nothing to do with anything I have a calendar called \"Weather: Auckland, NZ\" \nThe Weather calendar on the sidebar is checked and it's called \"Weather: Springfield, MO\" And the \"calendar\" shows three days for my zip code. Of course I can share, add, use, save, import, export, make into orgami, but can't delete. WHy does it exist? Where did it come from? I haven't been to any of the places associated with the calendar. I live in the zip code. OH, and it's it's own calendar. Not associated with any other emails or calendars. A color all it's own. Which, of course, I can also change. Any idea?\n\nA: It is a app from MetService (MetService NZ Weather) on App Store, that you must have downloaded.\n\n\n", "Q: External display not recognized after waking from sleep until restarted I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015, macOS High Sierra 10.13.6) which fails to detect an external display after is has woken up from sleep. (Update: Now running macOS Mojave 10.14.5 on a 13-inch 2018 model, and this is still a very annoying issue).\nHere's my situation: I have an external monitor hooked up to to the MacBook's display port, I walk away from my computer for a few minutes and it goes to sleep. I come back, and no matter what I try, the only way for the MacBook to detect the external display again is to restart the computer!\nI'm using a Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable. I use the MacBook at home as well as at work; I've tried different ports on my computer, different cables, and different monitors; the issue is with the MacBook itself.\nIt used to be that when this happens, I manually put the MacBook to sleep and wake it up again, and voila, it would detect the external display again. But now the only way to consistently fix the issue is to restart the MacBook.\nI've also tried opening the display settings, holding down the alt key, and clicking \"Detect Displays\". This does nothing.\nAny ideas on how to remedy this problem? \n\nA: I still have the same issue on a macbook pro 15' 2018.\nUnplugging and plugging again the screens helps without having to restart the whole thing... except that all open windows jump to the main screen.\n.\n///// EDIT solved the issue through an external thunderbolt dock\nI am using the Thunderbolt 3 Dock of Glyph now. My external screen is connected to its Display Port port. After waking up the screens behave normally. When I take a break, I power off the external screen and power it on before waking up the computer. In the tips I got from Glyph, they do ask you to turn off Energy Saving options when connected to the dock, but it all seem to work fine,\n\nA: I've found the system knows the other monitor is there, it just can't rouse it. Fastest work-around I've devised so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Go to 'Displays'\n\n*Click 'Gather Windows'\n\n*On the panel for the external display, choose one of the rotation options. (Seems that forces the system to give itself a kick and the external display will wake up, albeit upside down.)\n\n*Helpfully, there's a 'Revert' button already focussed. Just press Enter on your keyboard and it'll spin back around.\n\n\nDone.\n\nA: I experience similar problem and Google brought me here. Though as long as I don't unplug the cable it would always work fine. If I unplug it to take away the laptop and come back again one of my two monitors (the one converted from Thunderbolt to HDMI) won't work. However the other one with Thunderbolt to DisplayPort always works.\nMy solution is to connect it to a different port and most of time it would just work again.\n\nA: I FINALLY found a method that works every time -- it's half voodoo, half witch's brew.\nmy setup\nI'm running a 2019 MB Pro, one monitor connected via dock and display port, one monitor connected via usb-c adapter and HDMI.  In my case, the display port monitor was one that never would wake from sleep.  After much fiddling around with trying different methods, I found a way to reliably start using both monitors again without restarting.\nsteps to get all external monitors working again without rebooting\n\n*\n\n*Power OFF the display port monitor\n\n*Wake computer from sleep\n\n*Wait until I see a stable display on the HDMI monitor\n\n*Power ON the display port monitor -- flickering on all screens ensues as the computer attempts to wake the displayport monitor up\n\n*Unplug the dock (the display port monitor) from the Macbook\n\n*After a moment, plug the dock back in.\n\nDon't know why this works.  Until I figured this out, the only way I could get it working again was to restart the MB Pro.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Change default fullscreen new window behavior I keep many apps open full-screen to maximize screen real estate on my laptop. If I have some full-screen app open and create a new window, I more often than not want that window to not go fullscreen. Yet the current behavior is that a new window will open as a tab of the current window.\nIs it possible to make new windows actually create new windows on an existing Desktop, not fullscreen spaces, or new tabs of existing windows? If this is not possible in general, this mostly applies, in my case, to Terminal, so I would appreciate specific fixes as well.\n\nA: I have a similar use case. The workaround that I follow is to swipe back to any of the Desktop, right click on the Dock icon of the app in question and select New Window command. It involves taking a bit of a trouble to switch Space and not being able to use keyboard shortcut but serves the purpose.\nThe new, standalone window is created on the Desktop and it doesn't automatically go full-screen. The Space switching is required as the Dock doesn't appear in full-screen mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to any of the open Desktop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Right click on Dock icon to select New window command.\n\n\n\n", "Q: How can I migrate my data from my Macbook Pro 2010 to a Macbook 12-inch 2016? How can I connect a Macbook 12-inch 2016 to a Macbook Pro 2010 in target disk mode to migrate my data with Migration Assitant? The Macbook has a USB-C port and the Macbook Pro 2010 has Firewire 800 and USB 2.0.\nI couldn't find an adapter or cable for this.\n\nA: Your best bet is to use an ethernet (network) cable. At gigabit speeds it should be pretty fast.\nThe 2010 Macbook Pro has an ethernet port, and since the 2016 Macbook has nothing but USB-C you will have to go with an adapter.\nThis one was the first result in my search engine of choice. There are many others. And I would imagine that if you buy the adapter from a store with a good return policy and use care in unboxing and using the adapter, it might be easily returnable, if you only use it that one time.\nAlso, it has been a while since I have had to do this but Migration Assistant may work over WiFi if both are connected to the same WiFi network. That would be kinda slow but should do the trick if Migration Assistant works with WiFi\n", "Q: Menu title in Keyboard Shortcuts? I recently started using the Mac mail app. I like to keep the inbox clean and so I want to move every message that I read to a Backup folder ( not Archive for some very silly reason! ).\nSo, I decided to create a shortcut using System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts.\n\nWhen I try to add a shortcut, I have to fill a field named Menu Title where I have to write exact name of the menu command but how would I know which commands the Mail app knows about?\n\nSo, my question is How to know about menu commands that an app accepts on Mac?\n\nA: Mac Mail is highly customisable to individual needs.\nI like to keep it organized by using Mail Rules.\nI created folders in Mail (on my Mac) named Bank, Utility, Phone, and many others.\nThen in Mail > Preferences > Rules I set up so that if a mail arrives from one of those, it will be moved to the appropriate folder, and I will not miss it. (It shows in particular folder as unread as long I did not read it.\nI also have rules set up to Delete some emails from specific sources. The combinations are almost endless what you can do to keep your Mail organized. \nMail Rules is the way to go, no need to create new keyboard shortcuts.\nExample..for Sprint Phone emails..\n\nYou do not have to type they email address, just select it in Mail before creating the rule and it will show up.\nOne more trick. For some of us we want the mail to remain as Unread  till we say so (and do not want the automated mail feature marking them as read as soon we touch it).\nTo do so just drag the mail \"Preview window\" down till it disperses and mails will remain Unread till we tell it otherwise.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2018 (Mojave) - No WiFi hardware installed My wifi stop working and it display \"No hardware installed\" message on my Macbook Pro 2018.

Also i've tried to remove NetworkInterfaces.plist.\n\nPs: i have an MINIX NEO C adapter and since i've used that i had this problem. First time it started to work bi itself, but second time don't want to start anymore.\n\nA: Looks like wasn't a software problem, was a hardware one. Apple replaced my motherboard and touch-id. Now the WiFi is working. A little bit disappointed for my first Apple product.\n", "Q: Removed Atom from Applications. How to remove `atom` command from terminal? Recently I started using Microsoft Visual Studio Code instead of Atom. So I deleted Atom from the Applications folder. However, I can still autocomplete the atom command in terminal. And searching for it with where atom doesn't give any results (command not found).\nI tried looking for it in ~/.zshrc but nothing there points to atom either.\nAny idea where I can remove that command?\nUsing iTerm2 and om-my-zsh.\nUpdate\n\n\n*\n\n*The output of type -a atom is atom not found.\n\n*This is after a reboot of my machine; the terminal has been refreshed.\n\n*The output of alias does not contain atom.\n\n*I misremembered the which command and used where instead. That was my issue. Accepted the answer stating this.\n\n\nA: where atomwill result in command not found, true, but because the where command is not found; when using bash. A zsh error would have issued \"atom not found\"\nTry which atom to get the result of /usr/local/bin/atom in bash.\nThat means you just need to rm /usr/local/bin/atom to get rid of that command.\n(Atom.app install also apm, so be sure to remove that as well.)\n", "Q: How does iPhone know I'm travelling with location services switched off Recently acquired an iPhone SE (after a factory refresh), and I have location services turned off.\nTwice recently I've taken a train, and had the pop-up/splash screen offering to turn on do no disturb when I'm driving.\nHow does the phone know I'm \"driving\"? It would be easy to tell via GPS from my speed, but I'm sceptical it would be possible using an accelerometer (trains are pretty smooth). Is my phone still recording/tracking my location even with location services switched off?\n\nA: It's not geolocation. It's detection of specific motion. See Settings > Do Not Disturb.\nSee How to Use Do Not Disturb While Driving\n\nA: Since thousands people died in car accidents while using they Phone, Apple has introduced new technology  to help preventing that.\nIt uses not your location, but your WiFi signal to know how fast are you moving from or to Fixed location WiFi hotspot.\nWi-Fi signals are electromagnetic waves, and the signals coming from, say, a Starbucks emanate from a router that’s not moving. If you’re in a moving car, your phone’s Wi-Fi chip could detect the frequency change of the radio waves coming from the router.\nSo if you turn of the WiFi it will not know.\nHere is a nice article about that. \nThe do-not-disturb option will keep an iPhone's screen dark instead of displaying distracting notifications, but has noting to do with Motion sensing.\n", "Q: Turn off automatic download of attachments on iOS Mail I have \"Load Remote Images\" turned off on my phone and \"Load remote content in messages\" turned off on my mac.\nI got a suspicious message on my phone, but wanted to check it out because not many make it through my filter these days. I noticed that there was a .pdf attachment and that it was immediately downloaded (not ideal). The message was sent to a gmail account I was accessing through IMAP.\nThen when I went to my mac to mark the message as junk (I can't remember why I didn't mark it on my phone) the .pdf showed up inline and it was definitely spam. At this point I was irritated and then remembered that my phone had downloaded the .pdf when I opened the message before.* \nWhat setting keeps my phone from downloading attachments automatically? I know it would be better to not open messages that might be spam, but sometimes I can't tell from just the subject. \n*I'm assuming because it was downloaded on my phone, the mac Mail decided it was ok to download, or possibly accessed a version that the phone downloaded. Otherwise I need to ask a separate question about how to keep macOS Mail from downloading attachments.\n\nA: Currently there isn't  such a setting on iOS Mail app (as of iOS 12.0.1, Oct 2018).\nA workaround that may help with detecting some unfiltered spam messages would be trying to preview the message before opening it. It could help increasing the preview size: go to Settings > Mail > Preview and increase it to 5 lines. \n\n* image from https://www.imore.com/how-to-manage-mail-settings-iphone-ipad\n", "Q: Expanding compressed file on macOS places expanded files on top of compressed file I'm sure others have noticed this behavior, and I cannot - for the life of me - find a solution to stop it.\nIf you have a compressed file (such as a .zip or .tar.gz) on your desktop (or any folder that you're displaying as icons (rather than details or list), when you expand the compressed file, the files from within are placed on top of the compressed file (the files/aliases/etc. overlap each-other).  How do you get this behavior to stop, and have the expand process place the files either into a folder named after the compressed file or have the files listed in a column on the desktop, rather than overlapping like they were a stack of cards?\nNot that it matters, as this has been the way it is since forever, but I'm running macOS Mojave.\n\nA: It will drop the expanded file about a 'quarter icon' to the lower right unless you have some kind of 'Sort by' set in Finder; then it will move everything to a new position to make room, as appropriate.\n\nThe Archive Utility itself does have settable prefs, but none of them includes what the Finder will do with the positions afterwards...\n\nPersonally, I just have it set to always Trash the archive after expansion, which at least moves them out of each other's way.\nArchive Utility is in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/\nIf you launch it from there it will stay open so you can set prefs.\n", "Q: Spotlight Repeatedly Silently Crashing I have two Macs (10.12.6) on which spotlight is repeatedly silently crashing. What I mean by this is as I'm typing into spotlight, the search bar goes away, the search icon disappears from the menu bar, and then reappears a split second later. There is no specific phrase I'm entering that causes this, and it occurs almost every time I use spotlight for these computers. Restarts did not solve the issue. The second computer started exhibiting this behavior after a software update last night (security update beta), but the primary computer has been doing this for a while (I'm not sure when it started).

It doesn't block calls I get spam calls on my iPhone SE. I have caller ID.\nI have a contact called \"do not answer\". The contact is blocked\nInside the \"do not answer\" contact I keep a list of all the spam numbers that call me.\nIn iOS 12.0.1 I get calls saying Incoming call from \"do not answer\". How is this possible? Doesn't the phone app see its showing the \"do not answer\" contact that should be blocked?\nThe only workaround I have found is to set my \"do not answer\" contact to have a silent ringtone without vibration but it still interrupts use of my phone\nThis has been ongoing since my iPhone 4s days\n\nA: If a contact has more than one phone number, you have to block each number separately. Have you blocked every individual phone number that’s assigned to your “Do not contact” contact?\n\nA: Write down each number you want to block and block each one separately. I had a iPhone SE and started to block numbers I did not want as they came in. \nThat worked for me. \n\nA: What you are trying to do is actually not possible with the Phone app on your iPhone.\nLike the commenters suggest you can't block a contact by the name that shows up on your iPhone's screen. I understand why you did that but the underlying logic of the phone doesn't work that way, for whatever reason.\nThe \"Do Not Call\" list is mostly a joke that few companies respect. \nI have found some success with the \"Call protect\" app from AT&T which marks calls as \"Telemarketer.\" \"Potential Fraud,\" and the like, though they still ring. There is a free tier (which I use) and a paid tier that supposedly offers more protection. Of course that only works if you have AT&T. If you don't have AT&T call your carrier and see if they offer something similar.\nThe only real solution to this issue is in the hands of our government, making penalties for phone spamming much more severe might cut down on this. Until then we have to rely on imperfect technological solutions, much like those that filter email spam.\n", "Q: How do you type a character with its ASCII code? I need to type the form feed character 0x0C in ASCII on my Mac. Is there any way to do this? I've tried using \"Emoji and Symbols\" from the Edit menu, but it's not in there.\n\nA: If you like to use the terminal, you can do this:\nprintf \"\\x0c\" | pbcopy\n\nThis pipes a single formfeed character to the pbcopy, which stores it in the system clipboard.  You may then paste it into whatever app you need.\n\nA: Add Unicode Hex Input as your Keyboard.  Hold the option key while typing.\n\n\nA: It's there for me in Character Viewer (Emoji & Symbols, expanded version).  It doesn't have a glyph, but if you double click it should be inserted. (Sometimes you may need to drag and drop to add.)\nNote that you may have to go to the gear wheel at top left and select Customize to add the Unicode category. The Unicode category is under Code Tables.\n\n", "Q: Activate Emoji & Symbols and Character Viewer independently Sometimes when editing text, I want to use the Emoji & Symbols viewer to quickly type a symbol. Other times, I want to open the full Character Viewer window. Unfortunately, there only seems to be one keyboard shortcut to open them (Edit > Emoji & Symbols, ⌃⌘space), and it simply remembers which you used last. Changing which interface is displayed seems to require the use of a mouse to click the toggle button in the top-right of the window.\nHow can I easily select which of them to bring up? Ideally, I would like to end up with two keyboard shortcuts, one for each interface. Third-party solutions are acceptable, but a native solution would be ideal.\nPossibly useful starting point: \"Show Emoji & Symbols\" in the Input menu (enabled via System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard > Show keyboard and emoji viewers in menu bar) seems to always bring up the full Character Viewer, regardless of the last state. Activating this with a keyboard shortcut would be perfect, though I would much prefer doing so programmatically rather than via the menu GUI.\n\nA: If I were in a similar situation, I would do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the default keyboard shortcut for Emoji & Symbols from ⌃⌘Space to ⌃⌥⌘Space so that the default ⌃⌘Space can be used as a shortcut with one of the scripts, the primary one.\n\n*Create two AppleScript scripts, one for showing Emoji & Symbols, (the primary one for me), and the other for showing Character Viewer. (This could be done in one script however, for coding simplicity two will be used.)\n\n*Use FastScripts to assign a keyboard shortcut to each. The first for My Emoji & Symbols to ⌃⌘Space and for My Character Viewer, use ⌃⇧⌘Space as shown in the image further below.\nNote that I have no affiliation with Red Sweater Software, the developer of FastScripts, and am just a satisfied user.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that in place of using FastScripts, an Automator Service can be used. However, I prefer the former because it has worked better for me then the latter.\n\n\n\n\nThe following was tested and worked under macOS High Sierra...\nFirst, change the global keyboard shortcut for the Emoji & Symbols menu item:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the [+] to add a new shortcut with the following settings:\n\n*Applications: All Applications\n\n*Menu Title: Emoji & Symbols\n\n*Keyboard Shortcut: ⌃⌥⌘Space\n        See image further below.\n\nNext, create two AppleScript scripts (.scpt) files in ~/Library/Scripts/, one named My Emoji & Symbols and the other named My Character Viewer, adding the following to each:\nFor My Emoji & Symbols:\ndo shell script \"defaults write com.apple.CharacterPaletteIM CVStartAsLargeWindow -bool false\"\ndelay 0.5\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke space using {control down, option down, command down}\n\nFor My Character Viewer:\ndo shell script \"defaults write com.apple.CharacterPaletteIM CVStartAsLargeWindow -bool true\"\ndelay 0.5\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke space using {control down, option down, command down}\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note the only difference between the two is the value of -bool, being true or false for the CVStartAsLargeWindow key. Also, the value of the delay command is to allow time for the defaults command to make the write before System Events triggers the new global keyboard shortcut for the Emoji & Symbols menu item. The value of the delay command may need be adjusted, so do so as needed.\n\n\n\nThen in FastScripts > Preferences... > Script Shortcuts, assign ⌃⌘Space (or ⌃⌘␣) to My Emoji & Symbols, and assign ⌃⇧⌘Space (or ⌃⇧⌘␣) to My Character Viewer.   See image below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that FastScripts will need to be added to: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility   See image below.\n\nIf using Automator Services, use a Run Apple Script action with the example AppleScript code, show above, replacing the default code in each and assign keyboard shortcuts via: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that the mentioned naming conventions and or paths, et cetera, have changed for some items in macOS Mojave and will need to be adjusted accordingly. I am not yet running macOS Mojave however, have seen posts on some of the differences. You'll need to adjust as necessary if running macOS Mojave.\n\nKey Symbol Legend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shift: ⇧\n\n*Control: ⌃\n\n*Option: ⌥\n\n*Command: ⌘\n\n*Space: Space\n\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\n\n\nFastScripts > Preferences... > Script Shortcuts\n     • Note that the ␣ character, shown in the shortcut below, is for the space character.\n\n\nSystem Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility\n\n", "Q: Running MTGArena on MacBook Pro using Wine and DXVK I have recently installed wine for the first time on my MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2011 running OSX 10.13.6 with OpenGL 16.7.4 and OpenCL 2.8.24) in order to play MTGArena... unfortunately it doesn't work. I know that there are plenty of discussions around the web about this game, but none of what I've found solved my problem.\nHere is what I've done:\n1) Installed XQuartz 2.7.11 downloading the .pkg installer directly from the homepage and temporary disabled Gatekeeper.\n2) Installed Wine-devel 3.18 downloading the executable directly from the homepage.\n3) Opened Wine Devel.app and run wine MTGAInstaller.exe. The installation went fine except that text inside the installation window was replaced by black rectangles (this is a common and uninfluential issue according to many posts around the web).\n4)

DirectX and graphic libraries in general, so I really can't imagine where to start trying solve this issue (for example, do I have to install DirectX inside a WINEPREFIX before installing MTGArena? How? I suppose DirectX are not installed by default on my Mac since it's a proprietary Microsoft piece of software - if ever it is possible to installed them on Mac).\nGoogling around I've found some people talking about Vulkan libraries and DXVK but I'm unsure how to procede: should I install them on my Mac or inside Wine? Does Vulkan libraries replace some core piece of MacOS? How to make Wine aware of Vulkan?\nAny help? Thank you!\nP.S.: \n\n\n*\n\n*Which Wine version (devel or staging) is preferable for MTGArena?\n\n*Is it better to install XQuartz and Wine from .pkg installer or use MacPort to install them? (I'm not a brew guy, so that's not an option).\n\n*Does XQuartz replace some native part of MacOS or it's a software that only gets executed by Wine when needed?\n\n\nI hope this is the proper place to ask this question.\nUPDATE\nI've found that installing winetricks and running\n./winetricks d3dx11_43 dxvk vulkanrt\n\nthe command wine MTGA.exe manage to launch the game\n\nbut then I get

So I want to change Python 2.7 to 3.5, so that the version can match with my book. So I am trying to use the way above, but it didn't work.\n\n\nA: You can't change python 2.7 to 3.5 or anything like that. It sounds like you want to use a certain version and you have two versions loaded. You should set up virtual environments and define one for each version of python you have installed. Then you can activate whichever version you want to use. There are instructions all over the internet on how to define and build virtual environments. A few are here and here. Find one you like. If you're using the Anaconda distribution of python this is all made easy and is well documeted on the Anaconda web page.

And then I upgraded to High Sierra and now I can't print because of the \"Hold for Authentication\" message.\n\n\n*\n\n*I searched for a solution many times but nothing I've found has worked thus far.\n\n*I went into keychain and searched for the printer but it wasn't there.\n\n*In keychain I selected all items (logins, certificates) for that server and deleted them.\n\n*After deleting items from keychain, I tried printing again and got to the Hold for Authentication again and so I opened the print job and it prompted me for authentication. Nothing I tried worked. I tried my normal windows password. I tried the server administrator password. I tried no password. None of this works.\n\n*I deleted the printer and tried to set it up again. In the \"Add\" screen I browser the workgroup (called \"workgroup\") and selected the server (named \"server\") and it threw up a box \"There was a problem connecting ... may not exist or it is unavailble at this time\" type error.\n\n\n\n\n\n*I used RDP client and connected to the server using its name \"server\" and that worked fine (after accepting the certificate again - so I know the keychain thing was deleted properly)\n\n*I used the Go > Connect to server and entered smb://server and this prompted me for my details (which worked) and connected me to a regular share (which worked). So my mac CAN talk to the server under regular smb, just not printing (I deleted my keychain passwords for this site before this step to ensure they authenticated again).\n\n\n\n\n\n*I tried installing support for Internet Printing Protocol on the server and tried connecting to that, but that also didn't work.\n\n*Other Windows 7, 10 and Ubuntu clients on the same network can all print to the same printer.\n\n*I waited till I went home, and printed to the printer there just fine. It's the same model printer, but it's connected off my home router rather than a windows server. So as usual there's some kink between Mac and Windows.\n\n\n/edit\n\n\n*I installed LPD on the server and tried connecting to it from the Mac and printing. This appears to connect to the printer (the dot turns green) and seems to print, but the page pauses and doesn't appear on the server queue at all.\n\n\n\n\nA: I'm not sure how helpful this will be but I offer it in the hopes it will generate an idea that might work.\nOn a Macbook Air with Mojave I usually map directly to the printer via IP Address which is the second icon from the left in the \"Add\" (printer) dialog box. I find this to be more reliable than printing via our print server which is one of our Active Directory domain controllers.\nHowever, once you select the print server (in my case it is [DOMAIN NAME] > [Print Server]) it pops up an authentication dialog box \"You are attempting to connect to the server \"[SERVERNAME]\" Click connect to continue\"\nOnce you click connect you get a standard login dialog box with your username already filled in.\nDon't use that username or your local password there\nInstead you need to enter the name of the print server, sometimes referred to as the NETBIOS name, followed by a backslash \" \\ \" and then a username of an account on that particular server. In my case it would be something like this:\ndomain\\stevec\n[password]\nIn your case as you are not in an AD domain:\nservername\\username\n[password]\nWindows expects authorization from outside the domain to be fully qualified. EG where the credentials are, a backslash and then the account/user name.\nIt could be that when you try and print there are cached credentials somewhere (possibly on the server?) that are messing you up.\nI would delete the printer queue from the Mac and re-add it via the Printers & Scanners preference and choose the Windows printer option and logging in as a user on that PC.\nEither that or select the \"Default\" or \"IP\" methods and completely bypass printing via your Windows server, if that is possible.\n\nA: I found this post via Google. I have an HP Officejet 4510 g510n-z and strangely enough, resetting (https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Inkjet-Printing/OfficeJet-4500/m-p/585875/highlight/false#M548340) the printer solved the issue I had with continual 'Hold for Authentication' messages I was yielded when sharing a Windows printer (via built in Windows 10 x64 printer sharing) and attempting to print with OS X Mojave. \nThe symptom was that even after authenticating with the local admin account (which is a Microsoft.com account, with my e-mail address/password) I would continually be prompted for the login/the local print status in Mojave would yield 'Hold for Authentication'. Attempting to use the 'Guest' login would yield the same outcome - continual 'Hold for Authentication' / no successful print.\nResetting the Printer solved the issue - I re-added the printer in Mojave, and clicked 'Guest' and can print successfully. \nBizarre, I would have never thought that resetting the printer would solve a network/domain authentication problem.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Here is what made printing from Mac (high sierra, macbook pro) to a Windows 10 shared printer come back to life for me. This Canon mx920 printer has been on the same PC, hooked up by USB cable for a couple of years, but after various upgrades we lost remote(shared) and wireless printing. It's been troublesome from time to time but lately became impossible.\nI went through the steps from lots of troubleshooter and forum answers, always got the \"Authentication\" error in the print queue on the mac.\nThen I got the notion that my microsoft account on the pc, the only account, was the admin role, and maybe remote printing as admin is too much to expect, with software upgrades and higher security standards evolving. For instance, Windows 10 has done away with the good old \"guest\" account. So I created a simple basic local account on Windows to use just for printing and gave it a small password. Worked right away.\nAvoid using the admin account for remote printing.\n", "Q: Monitor your Wi-Fi connection not found on High Sierra Your Mac can monitor your Wi-Fi connection for intermittent issues, such as dropped connections.\nWell I know that and used it before, but can not find it on High Sierra.\nThe output looked like this \n\nIf Wireless Diagnostics finds an issue, it stops monitoring and shows a brief description of the issue. \n\nSo where is this wonderful tool on High Sierra.\nJust to make it clear..I am not looking for this 160MB WirelessDiagnostics_C02W92Z5J1WL_...tar report.

As with any other iPhone service, I was asked to backup everything. I did the backup in iCloud which includes everything that the backup allows.\nI usually type in my native language using the English QWERTY keyboard, so I use tons of custom words in my every day conversation. 3 years worth of custom words were stored, and upon restoring the device from the backup after the service, POOFFF my words are gone!

But the issue with 3rd party keyboards is that they might very well be transmitting whatever you type back to their servers. You never know. That's the reason I still haven't installed it on my iPhone. I had it installed on my Android because I controlled it using a firewall. iOS doesn't have any, unfortunately.\n", "Q: Safari complains about SSL certificate on redirect page I have gotten reports from people navigating to our site without entering the www. part of the URL that our SSL certificate does not match and so generates a warning. This is technically correct I suppose since our SSL certificate is for the www. domain and two other subdomains. \nBut I have a redirect function so that anyone who enters the non-www url gets instantly redirected to the www URL. I have tested this on several browsers and on android phones. It seems only on Safari have any problems been found. Anyone have any suggestions on why this is happening with Safari and how to avoid it? The server is a windows server running IIS.\n\nA: There is nothing you can do except get a new certificate which covers both www and non-www.\nAny redirects will only be done after a successful SSL handshake. But since your certificate does not match the name in the URL used by the client there will be no successful SSL handshake and thus no redirect.\n", "Q: 2018 MacBook Pro + LG 4k display = no 60hz I've got 2018 MacBook Pro 15\" (Radeon Pro 560X), which I'm connecting to external LG 4K display (27UD69P-W) via Satechi Type-C to HDMI Adapter (says 4K/60hz on the box), but the display is running 30hz.\n\nHow do I make it do 60hz?\nThank you!\n\nA: So I've tried a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*IOKit/CoreDisplay patch described in this article.

I had to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable DisplayPort version 1.2 in the monitor's menu.\n\n*Choose \"Resolution: Default for display\" in my Mac's System Preferences/Displays.\n\n\nThe first point is pretty obvious, given that DisplayPort 1.1 only supports 30Hz for 4k.\nThe second point, however, is a bit weird. The original setting was:\n\nAnd this setting delivered 4k@30Hz. Choosing \"Default for display\" changed it to 60Hz. After that, even re-selecting \"Scaled\" keeps my monitor at 4k60Hz.\nWhat I believe might have happened is, that when I had first connected the display, it was still set to DisplayPort 1.1, and I assume my Mac remembered this. Resetting SMC/PRAM didn't seem to help. Switching the Resolution selector in the System Preferences probably made macOS rescan the connection and remember the updated DisplayPort 1.2 capability.\n\nA: For me it was an HDMI cable issue as Bunches answered. I used the one that came with my gaming monitor and it started working. So her answer is indeed helpful, nobody else mentioned trying another HDMI cable. Unfortunately i dont have points to give you an upvote yet.\nI would love to know which exact spec was a mis-match but both cables have similar labelling: - \nPremium Hight Speed HDMI cable with ethernet AWM style 20276 80C 30V VW-1\nThe only difference is the model number:\nE358026 - not working.\nE474198-C - working.\n\nA: I had the same issue on my MacBook Pro 16\".

Something with HDMI 2.0 was a bit of a tweak to that standard. Even using Win10 I had to specifically go into the NVidia settings and tell it to use the UHD profile to achieve 60hz over HDMI 2.0. \nI imagine SwitchResX is giving you that capability.  \n\nA: I simply swapped out my cable with a thicker HDMI cable and it did the trick.\n\nA: I have had this problem.\nMine is : MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\nBear in mind that MBP 2016-2018 models do not support 4k 60Hz in the right usb-c ports.\nYou should definitely check with the left ports (usually people use right ports)\nAnd also you need to check the cables.\n\nA: Hardware:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro 15\" 2018\n\n*Monitor 4k 28\" Samsung U28E590\n\n*Cable usb-c to HDMI (Supports @60 HZ)\n\n** I have also a dock hub dual usb-c port with outputs ports one of them HDMI and also 2 usb-c output ports.\nThis issue happen to me on any combination, using my dock hub or directly connecting the cable to one of the MacBook ports, I use 2 monitors this samsung 4k and the other 22\" DELL FHD, also it doesn't matters if I use just the samsung monitor or both, but by default connecting the usb-c/HDMI cable to the monitor doesn't recognize the @60hz and sometimes neither all the capable resolutions it's really annoying struggle on this on a recent Macbook Pro, so when this happens I used to disconnect the cable from the usb-c on my MacBook then connect it again and finally switch the HDMI ports on the monitor and backing it up again to the correct HDMI port with the 60hz capability, THEN the resolutions are selectable and also the 60hz option to all the resolutions.\n\nA: LG HDMI ULTRA HD Deep Color > ON\nIf your LG display has this setting and you're using an HDMI cable...\nthis setting must be ON to get 60Hz at 4K!\nLG displays have this setting off by default.

There is a problem with those active adapters & cables on the MacBook Pro 2017 & 2018 models. Please check your \"USB\" category on System Profiler, does it state that the cable is connected as \"BILLBOARD 2.0\" under the USB 3.0 category? For me it seems that we can't activate the \"DP Alt Mode\" on these thunderbolt ports (for no apparent reason). And that's why you are getting 30hz.\n\nA: On Hisense, I had to open the TV settings and Select Enhanced HDMI output, and then disconnect reconnect my HDMI cable. I also had to switch from extended displays, back to mirror, and then back to extend.\n\nA: In my case, one day \"Default for display\" workaround stopped working.\nAfter reseting NVRAM, workaround started working as usual.\n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro 15'' Mid 2015. I had a simple HDMI cable first, and MacOS only supported a 30Hz refresh rate. It was painful to use. I bought several different cables, but it was still stuck at 30Hz. I hacked a custom 60Hz crappy resolution with SwitchRes4x but that's all I could get. No 4K for me.\nThen, suddenly, after resetting SMC and NVRAM AND reinstalling MacOS from scratch, 4K is working fine with a DisplayPort to ThunderBolt 2 cable (my monitor doesn't have a USB-C port)!\n\nA: It may seems dumb but did you try to restart your macbook after buying and connecting this 4k sreen ?\nFor me it seems like the right settings for my LG CX 4k tv were not visible until I restarted my macbook.\nAfter that I went to display preferences, then use Tom Ross answer:\n\nI had the same issue on my MacBook Pro 16\".

After switching to the Apple branded HDMI adapter, 60Hz was available.\n\nA: My USB hub's HDMI port doesn't support 4K @ 60hz, while my laptop does. Upgrading to a better hub fixed it for me. Just leaving this comment here, hoping it might help someone. 2021 Macbook Pro M1.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my LG Ultrafine 27UP600-W connected to my Mac Mini. It started after I swapped cables while testing a different issue. But after swapping back to the cable that came with the monitor, I still wasn't seeing 60hz as an option. Restarting didn't help either.\nFor me, the fix was selecting this on the monitor: Settings > Picture > Game Adjust > FreeSync > Basic.\nYou can safely reset FreeSync back to the factory default of Off afterward. I think switching FreeSync is what it takes for the Mac to rescan the connection to the monitor on a Mac Mini. (Chris Lercher's answer of selecting Default for Display didn't work for me.)\n\nEdit:\nIt looks like turning on HDMI ULTRA HD Deep Color also works: Settings > General > HDMI ULTRA HD Deep Color.\n\nA: For anyone reading through this post, my solution came from this answer. I needed to switch DisplayPort version on LG monitor settings from 1.4 to 1.2, and then set refresh rate to 60Hz in MacOS Display settings.

https://pastebin.com/U5DWYDrb\nThanks for your help!\nedit: updated EtreChcek report after doing what LangLangC suggested: https://pastebin.com/A6eu7m5g\n\nA: All those boot modes you tried and reported seem to indicate one thing:\nThis machine has a hosed system installation. The problems inherent are now so numerous that a clean install will likely be the best and fastest approach to rectify the situation.\ncom.ab.klpro.plist should not be on any system, as bad as com.ab.klpro.plist \"jump connect\", com.ab.kl.observer.plist \nThen:\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/net.exirion.ssdfanctrl.plist  and\ncom.tunabellysoftware.TGFanHelper.plistare both fan controllers. They are in conflict by definition.\nYour \nDiskWarrior version is outdated: 5.0 is installed, 5.2 available\nViscosity is apparently version 1.2 when 1.7 is available\nIn /Library/Extensions you have the\n- HoRNDIS.kext from an USB Tethering software that seems questionable\n- engine.kext is also present without need?\nMacAppBlocker.app is from 2015 and likely outdated as well.\nEcammAudioLoader: 1.0.4 (installed 2017-01-05)    and\nCallRecorder: v2.5.22 (installed 2017-01-05)\nAre also indicative of cruft accumulated.\nThe file     /Library/.A_o_b_o_p_r_o/AbkPro.app may be related to malware but is evidently in any case from PUPA software. The high network traffic is also a warning sign.\nThese are just those problems found by EtreCheck. MalwareBytes and similar programmes will likely yield even more now. \nYou have two options now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all the cruft from the last years by hand. Perhaps possible, and I would try that to learn something. But that will at least cost you time, and may not be successful.\n\n*Make a backup, (make a bootable backup), wipe the drive, make a clean install of High Sierra. Do not use Migration Assistant. Install the software you need one by one.\n", "Q: Make the default location for all save and open actions Google Drive File Stream Using macOS Mojave or High Sierra, is there a way to change the default file location for all save and open actions to Google Drive File Stream?\nOn Windows I would change it in the registry to g:\\users\\%username%. What is the equivalent on macOS? We are working with HIPAA data and I need to redirect all file activity away from the local computer onto the encrypted, shared platform. \n\nA: By default, there is no way to do this in Mac OS.\nHowever, you can do it with Default Folder X, an app which is specifically designed to set default open and save folders. (Hence the name.)\nIt is a great app from a long, long, long-time Mac developer. Highly recommended. Comes with a free 30-day trial.\n", "Q: Editing an outlook message on the iPhone It appears that when I edit a message on the iPhone send it out to someone to read in the Outlook client, they don't see my edits?  How do I fix this? We tested this a few times and seems to be occurring with all of us.\n\nA: To track edits to a document, save it in OneDrive and then edit it it in Word or OneNote or Excel or Powerpoint. Outlook doesn't do revision tracking on iOS or macOS in any current 2016 or 2019 version of the suite. I don't even thing outlook web app even tracks versions, and that's where they roll out most features first now.\nThen send a link to the document or just share it. We also use box and iCloud for collaborative editing to track changes and you might also consider Google if that's open for your group.\n", "Q: Location of the root's home directory in macOS All Unix-like operating systems I've seen use /root as the home directory for the root account. What's the reason it was moved to /var/root in macOS? Can I change it to the usual /root?\nI need to run some scripts on macOS which hardcode /root as the root's home directory. Also, I thought that /var was for variable data (spool, log files, etc.).\n\nA: I think the problem is that you haven't really seen that many Unix-like operating systems. Traditionally with Unix-like operating systems, you would actually have the root user's home directory at /.\nIf you have worked with Linux or perhaps FreeBSD, you would expect the root user's home directory to be at /root - but it's not really \"God-given\".\nThere's plenty examples of Unix-like operating systems that use varying locations. For example on HP-UX systems you wouldn't blink an eye to find the home directory at /homeroot. Similarly on macOS it is at /var/root.\nRegarding your assumption on the use of the /var folder: Traditionally there hasn't been any kind of hard consensus on what each of the traditional system folders are used for (for example /etc, /usr, /usr/local, /lib, /etc.). This might vary from operating system to operating system.\nUsually you would say that the /var folder is for variable data - however that doesn't mean that it is limited to spool or log files, like you write. It means that the contents of the folder might change while using your system - in contrast to for example /bin, where traditionally you could assume that this folder could just be reinstalled from the original installation medium. In this sense the root user's home folders fits the description. You usually don't want it in /home or /Users as that could be a networked file system, and you traditionally wanted the root user to be able to always be able to login for system recovery.\nOn macOS you can change the location of the root user's home directory. For recovery purposes, change the location in /etc/passwd. For ordinary usage, change it in the Open Directory.\nYou can see the current settings with:\ndscl . -read Users/root | grep NFSHomeDirectory\n\nAnd change them with:\ndscl . -change Users/root NFSHomeDirectory <old> <new>\n\nwhere  and  are replaced with the relevant paths.\n\nA: A simple solution would use tilde expansion in the scripts instead of a hard coded location.\nExample:\nls -ld ~root\n\n\nA: I think this a better question than it seems because it gets at some system-level facts that are bit opaque and historical.\nFirstly, the reason GNU/Linux, BSD systems and some other Unix variants tend to put the root user's home directory in /root/ is to keep it out of /home/, which is often a separate mount -- potentially mounted over a network. If the /home/ mount fails, you'd want root to retain access to their home directory.\nSecond, although it's Linux specific, the File Hierarchy Standard (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard) is a fairly good explanation of what goes where and why. In GNU/Linux, BSDs as well as commercial Unix variants, /var/ is for \"variable\" files that are changing often. Stuff like databases, logs, sockets, etc. This, again, is to provide the ability for a separate /var/ mount, which could be configured or optimized for more volatile files.\nThird, my guess about my Apple moved root's home directory to /var/ is that it coincided with a move toward more \"rootless\" system (SIP; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection). With a rootless system, root's home directory is significantly less important. Moving may be an indirect way of signalling a change in the use of root in macOS. And perhaps in an ideal rootless system, root's home directory is purely vestigial -- used to accommodate legacy applications that, for whatever reason, needed root to have some home directory. That Apple put in /var/ can only suggest that they though rootless uses of root's home directory were more at home in /var/ than elsewhere.\n", "Q: Mojave - Some Apps Lose Internet Connectivity Scenario\nI recently installed Mojave and I've noticed that after an undetermined amount of time that many apps complain of not having a connection to the internet eg Mac Mail and Spotify. Meanwhile chrome works the entire time.\nTested Solutions\nTurn off WiFi, reconnect WiFi\nCurrent Solution\nRestart Computer\nQuestion\nWhy is this happening? Is there any way around it other that completely restarting my computer?\n\nA: I had same issue like that, my solution  was restart the mac. Maybe, it will be solved by apple on the next updates.\n", "Q: Can I use IDLE to write python programs instead of the terminal on Mac? The Mac terminal uses Python 2, and I don't know how to change the Python version.\n\n\n\nA: Macs come with Python2 and this should not be removed. Installing a new version is fine as long as you use virtual environments. You should use the Anaconda distribution of Python, then setup and use virtual environments.\nThere are several sites, like this one which will walk you through the process. It's very easy using Anaconda. Another site is here. Once you get virtual environments set up, activate the one for the version of Python you want to run. You can then use IDLE or Atom to write and run your scripts. \nUsing virtual environments also allows you to change which Python version is used at the terminal.\nIf this is unclear just leave a comment and I will write a message explaining this better.\n", "Q: How to Restore backup from external drive to itunes or iphone in Windows 8? I back my iPhone up to My Windows 8. Since I don't have much space on my C: Drive, I moved my iTunes backup folder to an external drive (mklink/J \"%APPDATA%\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\" \"J:\\Backup\"), and then created a symlink from the normal backup folder to the location on the external drive where that particular backup folder is located.\nNow, there are two problems I've noticed with this. Firstly, when I connect my device and look in iTunes, it says \"Latest Backup: Your iPhone has never been backed up to this computer\" – even though it has been backed up (although to an external drive). The worse part is that the \"Restore Backup...\" button is grayed out, not allowing me to restore my iPhone from the backup.\nAnother thing I should mention is that when I go to iTunes > Preferences > Devices, I don't see my iPhone backup in the list. \nSo, how do I restore my iPhone from my backup external drive in my windows 8.. Please help \n\nA: iTunes doesn't work with symlinks very well. Try to copy the backup of your device back to \"~\\MobileSync\\Backup\" folder. Your backup is a folder in \"Backup\" folder with 40 random chars in name (device UDID).\nAfter copying the backup, restart iTunes. It should now see the backup and allow you to restore it.\n", "Q: Annotate/Highlight Safari webpages, and preserve highlights forever I am looking for a Safari extension or a built-in tool to highlight or annotate webpages.

I have an AppleScript script (to launch MySQL) that I run from the AppleScript toolbar menu. It does the job (launches MySQL), however the script doesn't seem to be quitting. And the gearwheel in the toolbar keeps rotating.\n\nWhen clicking the gearwheel I can click the 'x' close button for that script, but it does nothing. There are no frozen processes in Activity Monitor.\nHow can I \"force quit\" that script?\nP.S. Someone asked what's the script, here it is:\ndo shell script \"sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start\" with administrator privileges\n\n\nA: Ok, first off, when you are using AppleScript’s “with administrator privileges” you should not use sudo\nSecond, you need to send the job into the background if you want the AppleScript to finish.\nThe easiest way of doing that is to put the command in a shell script, like so:\n#!/bin/zsh -f\n\n/usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start &|\n\nexit 0\n\n(Note the &| at the end of the line. That tells the process to go into the 'background')\nSave those 3 lines to a file named something like /usr/local/bin/start-mysql-server.sh and then do\nchmod 755 /usr/local/bin/start-mysql-server.sh\n\nto make it executable.\nFinally, change your AppleScript to\ndo shell script \"/usr/local/bin/start-mysql-server.sh\" with administrator privileges\n\nand it should launch and then the gear should disappear.\n\nA: I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*Type ps aux|grep mysql\n\n*get the PID of the script\n\n*Type kill -s 9 #### where #### is the PID of the script\n\n\nI would check to make sure that you don't kill the wrong process such as another mysql server.\n", "Q: Weird spotlight issue For whatever reason, when I launch spotlight, type in \"1\", \"1\", \"2\", spotlight closes automatically.

The highest resolution being of the 4K variety, so some good sized monitors, but only two of them. And as you have only two ports kinda hard to use a third adapter to connect a third monitor, even if the Mac supported three monitors, which it does not.\nGranted you can daisy chain USB-C/Thunderbolt monitors and theoretically dasiychain three monitors that way but you still run into the spec that says it only supports two.\nSo no you can't use that adapter and you can't connect more than two monitors, according to the Apple specs.\n\nA: As you mentioned you need USB display adapter not DisplayPort adapter.\nThis Mac GPU supports up to two external monitors, but USB display adapter has its own simple GPU.\nThe main con is very limited resolution and refresh rate of such adapters.\n", "Q: Prevent macOS from bringing all windows to front when switching to an app? I have 2 windows of Google Chrome open, one on each display. Switching to Google Chrome puts both the windows on top of the rest of the apps on both the displays.\nThis is annoying as I write using one display, and use the other to view reference material. Switching apps often causes the windows on other display to get inadvertently covered.\nI have set displays to have separate Spaces.\nIs there any way to prevent macOS from bringing all the app windows to front, or, to prevent the app windows shown on the other display from  switching too?\n\nA: An alternative is to install a third party app that uses option tab to switch between windows not apps, in the way Windows does.\nApps include Witch and Hyperswitch from this question Best app to switch between all open windows\nAlso look at Apple's own Mission Control which is part of macOS.\n\nA: Check out AltTab app. It does really bring one window, not all windows from a selected app, to foreground. Plus, it's free and open source!\n\nA: \nIs there any way to prevent macOS from bringing all the app windows to front, or, to prevent the app windows shown on the other display from  switching too?\n\nNo. This isn't the way app switching works. Irrespective of the number of connected displays, only app is the frontmost app at a time (is in focus and the Menu Bar shows the app's menu).\nHowever, the approach mentioned below addresses exactly the issue that you face (I face it too) and in my experience is an easy approach to take too :)\nI am assuming you use the Command + Tab keyboard shortcut to switch to Google Chrome app (and to switch to an app in general).\n\nWhen using the Command + Tab keyboard shortcut to switch to an app, all the open windows are brought to front. This is the default macOS behaviour.\nThis may be sometimes annoying (as in your particular case), when you have a barrage of windows of an app open and you have meticulously set them up so that some of them are hidden behind window(s) of other apps.\nTo circumvent this behaviour, the easiest approach to follow is to use Mission Control instead of Command + Tab to pick up preciously the desired window.\nFirst, invoke Mission Control. Now hover your mouse cursor over the Chrome window that you wish to bring to front. The window border is highlighted to indicate that it is under mouse focus.\n\n\n\nNow if you are unsure if the window is the desired one (as it is hidden behind other chrome windows or if it too small to be legible), simply press Space key to sort of Quick Look it by enlarging it.\n\n\n\nOnce you are sure that you have correct window, simply click on it to bring only that window to front.\n\nNote: I have enabled a setting called Group windows by application under System Preferences → Mission Control which makes the Mission Control display less cluttered by grouping app windows together.\n\nThis may restrict easily visualizing all open windows of an app if a lot them are open. It could be disabled, so as to view all open windows across all the app separately under Mission Control at the cost of having a cluttered view.\n\n\n\nAnother useful side-effect of this configuration is that hovering over a window shows the relevant title in the centre of the window, which further helps in easily identifying its contents.\n\nA: I'm a little sad there isn't more love for Keyboard Maestro. It, is by far the most powerful app on my mac.\nIn addition to having built in window and application switchers, you can also set a keyboard shortcut to focus (or launch, if it's not open), and app, and you can decide if you wish for it to pull up all windows, or just the top most.\nThe way I set mine up was to do the following when I press cmd+ctrl+shift+C: 1. If Chrome isn't running, launch it and bring it to the front. 2. If it is open, but it's not at the front, just bring up the top most window. 3. If it's already at the front, and I press the shortcut again, it brings all of the windows up, not just the last one I used.\nI'll paste a screenshot below to see what is needed to do that. If there's a task or set of tasks, including chains of tasks, that frustrate or annoy you, there's a more than likely task that KM can automate it. (Seriously, I shortcuts to automatically open and close sets of apps depending on if I'm connecting to my work wifi or home, I have one that I press a shortcut and it launches it as a URL, so you can easily navigate to unlinked URLs, and the list really is endless).\nHere's a screenshot of how I have it setup.\n\n\nA: This behavior is app-specific. Chrome is not moving to the front. Instead, the other app is moving to the back.\nCertain apps move to the background when you click away from them, but only if you click to certain other apps. For example, if you have Firefox in the foreground and you click an XQuartz window, this will happen.\nHowever, if you have a Firefox window in the foreground and you click a MacVim window, it doesn't happen. Nor does it happen if you have Brave in the foreground and you click XQuartz.\nUsing a different browser might avoid the problem, and if that doesn't work, using a different app to write might help.\n", "Q: Can a friend see how many times I have looked them up using Find My Friends I am sharing my location with some friends using Apple's Find My Friend service.\nI am curious to know if they get to know how many times and when I have looked them up using Find My Friend?\n\nA: No.\nWhen sharing location with friends using Find My Friends, the other person doesn’t know how many times their friends have looked them up. They don't get any notification or there isn't any log of lookup incidents made available to them.\nThe location is sent from the friends device only when you request to see it. The location isn't transmitted on a regular interval.\nFor more information on setting up and using Find My Friends, it is advised to go through the Apple support article, Set up and use Find My Friends.\nDo note that your friend(s) can choose to stop sharing their location at any time and can also choose to share their location using the device of their choice (e.g. if they are also using an iPad along with an iPhone and signed-into it using the same Apple ID, they may choose to share their location via the iPad. This may differ from their current physical location).\n\n \n\nA couple more important points to note from the article:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can follow up to 100 friends.\n\n*Your location is sent from your device only when someone requests to see it. Your location isn't transmitted on a regular interval.\n\nA: As per @ Nimesh Neema answer https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/339887/46541\nYour location is sent from your device only when someone requests to see it.\nIt means, if you request your friends location, your phone knows his number (you shared it) and will send a \"Ping signal\" to find it.\nOnce your friends phone receives the Ping request it will reply to you with the location data.\nSo theoretically YES, your friend could know you looked him up (Ping), if he has the tools and knowhow.\nSome more technical stuff about it..\nOfficially, in an IP network, a ping is a network took that allows you to determine if a host is available on the network or not. It uses ICMP echo packets (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc792) to do the deed.\nWhen somebody says ping a mobile on the network, what he really implies is to determine if where (what cell it is connected to) that mobile is in the network. So, this can mean the mobile is trigger to do a forced location update (LU). The mobile then reports itself into the network with its latest information.\n", "Q: macbook shuts down immediately after startup My retina MacBook Pro, running 10.12.6, has an annoying habit.\nIf I close the lid on 50% battery, the next time I open it, it wakes, I log in, and then a few seconds later the screen goes black and it shuts down.  \nPressing the power button enough brings up the 'flat battery' logo.\nMy assumption was that the battery is reporting 50%, but is in fact flat.\nIf I plug it in to charge, it then resumes where it left off, but if I unplug the power, it will continue to work for another couple of hours.  So it's not actually drained, it just temporarily thinks it is.\nWhat can I do, other than replace the battery?\n\nA: To verify your problem I need you to post the Battery status in detail.\nClick About this Mack (top left) > Syst report > Power \nthen copy the battery information in your original post.\nTo preserve some power consumption, open syst pref > Energy and disable the Power nap in Battery mode.\nTo verify is some process is keeping your Mac awake (dark mode) and consuming power open Terminal and paste following \npmset g  and post the info here\nalso run pmset -g assertions and post it here\nUnder normal (perfect) condition the battery should last 1,000 cycles, but that is not always the case, so your are getting close with your 700 cycles\n\nA: The condition of the battery on my 2014 Macbook Pro is poor and it shuts down regularly  when turned on if I'm not connected to power. However if I'm running Windows on Bootcamp I have no problems. Windows 10 carries on and tweaks it's own power settings at around 20%.\nThis suggests that the problem is software related.  \n", "Q: How can I make application update sleamless by avoiding the administrator password prompts?

If I go to About This Mac and click on the Storage tab, it tells me that I have 500 GB of Flash Storage and that 15.49 GB of 399.57 GB is free. \nIt will also tell me that 226 GB is for System, 130 GB is for Documents, and 25.8 GB is for Apps.\nIf I do: sudo du -hx -d 0 /*\n 19G    Applications\n2.5M    bin\n 15K    dev\n4.0K    etc\n1.0K    home\n1.9G    Library\n1.0K    net\n1.0K    Network\n 16G    private\n1.1M    sbin\n6.6G    System\n4.0K    tmp\n157G    Users\n848M    usr\n4.0K    var\n 36K    Volumes\n\nTools like OmniDiskSweeper or Disk Inventory X will report the same basic information.

I could do that again, but I would like to be able to track down what these files are. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: My problem is related to the question What is the correct way to eject a APFS dmg from the command line?\nWhat was going on is I was mounting APFS DMGs via hdiutil attach and only ejecting one of the disks. The disk left behind was taking up hard drive space. After I fully ejected the volume, my hard drive space came back.\nThe way I was able to spot this easily was by using Apple's Disk Utility application and saw a bunch of grayed out Disk Images.\n\nA: Well, I remember I have faced this problem before. This had to do with Spotlight indexing. Try this and tell me if there's a difference.\nGo to System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy\nClick the plus sign and add your whole hard drive!\n\n\nThen simply remove it and spotlight will start indexing your whole system. It will take some time and then see your usage.

Not the one you show thats on the same level as Applications and Users. In that Library folder there was a folder named Mobile Documents. That folder contained around 90 GB. I was using iCloud drive as a backup for my main drive and those files were also showing up in my /Library/Mobile Documents.

I have a late '10 MacBook Air with 64gb ssd, it was getting very slow and very full so I decided to wipe and start afresh. \nI followed some online instructions, signed out of everything then erased the drive. The MacBook did its thing and updated via Wi-fi then I came to the point of installing Lion OS X. \nMy problem started when I was asked to select a disk to install the os, there wasn’t one to choose. When I look on the Disk Utility, left hand pane shows 60.67gb Apple ssd TS064C Media with a sub heading of disk0s2. \nIf I click on this it states Not mounted, verify disk states Verify volume failed:Unrecognised file system. \nUnder this in the left pane I have disk1 with a sub heading of Mac OS X Base System. This amounts to 1.39gb. \nMy question is how do I get the Mac to recognise the drive to reinstall Lion?\nAny help would be massively appreciated. \nThanks\n\nA: I fought with an early Air that had been fully wiped by a well-meaning (but clueless!) IT person - he wiped not just the user partition (which I had already erased!) but also erased the reinstall partition. The only thing that worked to fix it was to find an original install image for the computer, place that on a bootable USB drive, and run from there, reformatting the internal drive as HFS+ in the process. If you can see the drive in Disk Utility, you should be able to reformat it.\nIf the drive WAS converted to apfs, you may need a newer version of Disk Utility to fix the format before you can drop to the Lion installer and start over. Use a bootable drive with macOS High Sierra or Mojave diskutil, dropping to command line to convert back to HFS+.\ndiskutil list to locate the APFS container\ndiskutil apfs deleteContainer /dev/disk#s# to kill the APFS container (replace disk#s# with the appropriate disk and partition)\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ \"Disk_Title\" /dev/disk# to reformat the now-destroyed APFS container\nSee here for more detailed info.\nAfter that's done, you should be able to use the Lion installer to see and select the newly-recreated HFS+ partition as the install target.\n", "Q: Sort by least played song I have a playlist with ~200 songs, I use this playlist during my (1-2hr) workout, it seems that when I start the playlist I hear a few songs I heard the day before.

I have a copy of the memz virus, and have parallels windows vm. What I'm wondering, is if I run memz.exe/bin (not memz-clean.exe/bin), will I screw up the mac that I'm running the vm on?\nThanks\n\nA: If your Parallels virtual machine is using a disk file for the guest operating system, and you haven't mapped your real hard drive into the vm - then no, in theory the Mac will not be screwed up. \nThe reason I write \"in theory\" is that there are a few practical concerns. Mainly, if you happen to have your hands on something that is not the original memz virus, but something else, it might do something unexpected. If the virus contains an exploit for Parallels usable from within the guest, it could break the isolation and tamper with your macOS installation. It is not very probably though.\n", "Q: How to record audio from terminal in macOS Mojave? Since macOS Mojave apps now need to ask for permission to record audio. I want to record it from the built-in microphone of my Macbook.\nThis means that a lot of old tools are broken. For example, sox and ffmpeg don't work anymore.\nWith ffmpeg I tried ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i \":1\" -t 10 output.mp3, which results in no file being even created.\nWith sox I tried sox -d output.wav, which produces a file but with no sound in it.\nSo does anyone have a workaround or other CLI utility that can do this?\n\nA: They have restricted access to the microphone from the terminal by default after the update. \nYou need to go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Microphone and tick the box for the terminal and it should all work again. \n\nA: If Terminal isn't showing up in the System Preferences list for microphone permissions and it hasn't requested permission (a problem on Mojave/Catalina), open it by:\nopen /System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal\n\nThen run a program that uses the mic e.g.\nsox -d -d \n\n(Note: You will need to install SoX. This specific command will let you hear your mic input. You could also use pyaudio, FFmpeg, ecasound etc.)\nThat should trigger it to request. If that didn't work try running the command on a different command line e.g. iTerm2. This is a problem and solution very similar to the one for Audacity on Catalina. I'm not sure what the exact cause is though.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make a folder look and behave like a file? I'm developing a desktop application which saves its projects to disk.

Example:\nfilename.project            <- folder, but it gets treated like a file\n  manifest.json             <- uncompressed contents\n  file1.jpg\n\nDefinition of \"Treated as a single file\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder shows a custom icon\n\n*Double-clicking opens the file association\n\n*\"Open\" dialogs can select this file\n\n\nOther examples\nOn my Mac, there are 2 examples where I see this happening:\n - All apps appear as .app files, but internally are folders that I can explore via Terminal\n - 1Password stores its password store in a .agilekeychain folder, which syncs to Dropbox as a folder, but appears in Finder as a single file.\n\nA: Apple Developer info says yes, you can definitely make your own package or bundle. Seems as if you want a package.\nPackage vs. bundle is discussed here.\nBasically - register your package with the system, so that folders with the extension are displayed as a package rather than as a folder (application info.plist must appropriately set key LSTypeIsPackage for each of the package filetypes you need to create). Then set your app to automatically (using NSFileWrapper) or manually create the package itself on save.\n", "Q: System notification message in message center I think this is a virus but I'm not sure. I cannot seem to find an answer online on how to make it stop. I have checked under safari and preferences and under system preferences.\n\nA: \"NOTIFICATION SYSTEM\" is not a system notification, or not one I've ever seen.  \nThe header is the 'app' generating the notification. In this case, as the icon looks like Safari then it could be some site you allowed to send you notifications.\n(As I tend to have most of these switched off, I'm not certain if the wording they use in that header is Safari's or the remote site's responsibility.)\nSafari > Preferences > Websites > Notifications\n\nCheck which sites you wish to allow to be able to do that - mostly you can switch them off, allow only the ones you really need, otherwise it's a spam-fest\n", "Q: Shared Apple ID- want to create new one I share an Apple ID with my mother...I know it’s not ideal but at the time it was easiest until she learned how to use the phone, plus we live in different states so I can manage the account. \nAnyway we now want to get her a separate Apple ID but I need to know if when we do this if it will make her lose all the stuff on her phone.  \nHow do I get to her current back up if I change and then use her new Apple ID.\n\nA: Create a new Apple ID then add her to your account as a family member with the Family Sharing option. Any apps purchased under the original account will remain available (and paid for) in the new account. She would lose some things (account backups, for example, but her device would start backing up to iCloud on its own storage rather than using your free allotment). If you set the account up for her, you can still manage it as you'd know the login info.\n", "Q: How to check which process took a desktop screenshot on macOS? I heard a shutter sound when pressing the ▼ (down arrow) key on (lock screen) login page. I heard it again 10min after login, when using the same key again. And then heard it no more, even when using the same key.\nI found 2 full screenshots on my desktop, both identifying the time and the respective screen I heard the sound. First of the login page, 2nd of my desktop (icons opened apps, etc).\nHow can I find which app / process took the screenshots?\n\nobs: I'm running macOS Sierra and I'm using a bluetooth Logitech keyboard.\nMy Chrome has the Adblock Plus and Privacy Badger extensions enabled only; I'm running Sophos AV.\n\nA: Using the log utility in Terminal you should be able to identify what exactly happened. \nIf you don't know the exact second that this happened go into Language and Region System Prefences settings and click the \"Advanced Settings\" button then go to \"Times\" tab and drag the blue box next to \"Second:\" in the \"Time Elements\" section up into the first line labeled \"Short\" so you can see seconds now along with dates in Finder's Date Created column. \nIn the Terminal app enter the following, substituting the correct time in 24h format and correct date (YYYY-MM-DD) for a couple seconds prior to the timestamp of the file and however many seconds after:\n\nsudo log show --start \"2018-10-23 23:45:17\" --end \"2018-10-23 23:45:47\" --info --debug --signpost | grep -i screencapture\n\nThis will likely detail what prompted the screencapture process to take a screenshot. If it's all labeled < private > you will have do another additional step to get this info but it's very simple. \nVery appropriate joke(?) about the NSA too. It actually really demonstrates the notion that malware or any sort of compromise is so far fetched that only someone like the NSA would understand it. The reality is that it's extremely unlikely that your computer hasn't been compromised. Considering most users think they have a magical stealth firewall and are protected by top secret Apple security features only makes the problem worse. Apple is at the end of the day just another for-profit company and admitting they've been perpetuating this lie for a long time past its expiration date would be very bad for its bottom line and stock price. \nConsidering you have an AV product installed and are suspicous enough to ask this question it's very likely there's some sort of keylogger/remote access/spyware installed. Confirming this is possible but typically made more difficult thanks to Apple's own security features being altered to actually protect and hide the malware ensuring persistence. \nTo date there are 6,275 enteries for Apple products in the National Vunerability Database. Many are critical flaws that are only patched by Apple after being documented and reported via this official process which also to some extent broadcasts the flaw to the world. Even more concerning is that Apple only addresses vunerabilites that are properly flagged via this official process and only for the version of macOS, iOS, etc. that is required. So new and old version often can be vunerable to an issue that was at one time addressed. It is, after all, easier to say you've built a magical computer than to actually make one. \nThanks to dedicated malware developers most people would never notice these little additions. Maybe you can learn to live with it..maybe imagine its a little fairy who watches over you and remembers all your passwords or checks to see you're getting to bed on time.

However, in Signal, when I type Serbia, I just get Serbia and Serbian as suggestions.  I have another friend using the Signal app on iOS who does get emoji recommendations from his keyboard, so I have seen that it is possible, but all my recommended auto-replacements are textual.  I don't understand why this is different on my iPhone X and his iPhone 7.\nIt's very annoying to have to scroll through all the emojis and pick one rather than just type a word and get it.\nWhat is happening and how do I fix it?\n\nA: Bafflingly, this was the answer:\nhttps://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/11/15/how-to-fix-predictive-emoji-not-working-iphone-ipad/\nApparently, the algorithm for recommendation for emoji replacement is per-app, which makes sense in that you speak differently in email than you do on twitter, but apparently, if you've never spun a random string of emojis together in a new app, the keyboard has to learn it from 0.  \nSo to fix this problem is: open your regular keyboard in the app of interest and type some words, then open your emoji keyboard and type a ton of random emojis (not even necessarily the one you want!). After you do, the recommendations will recognize that you mix English and Emoji and recommend them together, even from your English keyboard.  They will appear on the right hand side recommendation just where they do in iMessage.\n(The link used Angola, not Serbia.)\n\nA: Try using the Text Replacment feature. \nSettings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement.\nPhrase =  & \nShortcut = #serbia\n\n", "Q: Compress contacts onto iPhone (without iCloud) I have contacts from several google accounts I would like to merge onto my iPhone local contact list, and eventually completely remove the Google dependency.

Is it on my account, as I was the one who bought it, or is it on the other person's account?\n\nA: According to Apple:\n\nWhen you set up purchase sharing, one adult in the family—the family organizer—agrees to pay for any purchases that family members make while they're part of the family group. \nAfter it's paid for, a purchased item is added to the account of the family member who made the purchase. If you turn off purchase sharing, each member keeps their purchases, even though they were paid for by the family organizer.\n\nSo while the Organizer is the one who agrees to pay for the app, the 'owner' of the app is the Apple ID who made the purchase.\n", "Q: Will my 2014 Mac Mini boot an SSD that already has Linux on it? I have an SSD from another computer that has Ubuntu Linux installed on it and fully working. It's a standard UEFI Ubuntu install using the GRUB bootloader, and the entire SSD is used (i.e. there are no additional partitions).\nIf I put this SSD into my 2014 Mac Mini, will it successfully boot?\nI can put the SSD in most other semi-modern computers and it boots fine. For example I have done this in a Lenovo Thinkpad, Windows gaming PC, etc.\nJust to clarify I'm not talking about installing Linux or reinstalling macOS - I'm talking about booting the Linux OS that's already installed on the SSD.\nIf the SSD will not boot, what do I need to do to make it boot?\n\nA: There is no way to know in advance if you can boot the operating system on this SDD. The the only way to know for sure would be to try booting. The Mac Startup Manger is employed to either manually or automatically determine what code needs to be loaded in to RAM memory and executed in order to boot the computer. This Startup Manager does not recognize all the possible valid boot configurations and therefore may ignore the Grub and/or Ubuntu startup files stored on the SSD. One way to avoid this problem would be to first boot the a rEFInd USB flash drive image file. A link to download this file can be found at the Getting rEFInd from Sourceforge website. If rEFInd is necessary to boot Ubuntu, then you can either modify the name and location of the startup files on the SSD to avoid using rEFInd or install rEFInd on to the SSD.\n", "Q: Geektools Shell Problem In order to monitor the filesystem activity on my computer, I found command \"sudo fs_usage\", which works very well in Terminal.

Apple offers several methods to transfer settings from an old phone to a new one. A particularly promising sounding one is the \"Quick Start\" approach, which begins promisingly enough with some cool automatic recognition of the new device. But things pretty much end there. Nothing about actually transferring seems to be any different than any other method: one still has to restore from either an iTunes or and iCloud backup as far as I can tell.\nWhat does the \"Quick Start\" method actually transfer? Is restoring from a separate backup still necessary to complete the process of transferring settings, apps, and keychain info from the old iOS device?\n\nA: Despite the description on Apple's website, Quick Start is not a distinct method for transferring content from an old to a new iOS device. It's simply a way of skipping a couple of the more laborious screens in the setup assistant on the new device. It is still necessary to perform the usual steps to ensure that the backup from which you choose to restore is fully up to date. (In particular, the instructions to first unpair any Watch because this \"automatically backs up\" the Watch, are incomplete at best.)\nUsing Quick Start, you will skip the following setup assistant screens on the new device:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choosing a Wi-Fi network\n\n*Entering your Wi-Fi network password\n\n*Entering your Apple ID for iCloud\n\n*Entering your Apple ID for iTunes and App Stores, if you use a different one\n\n\nUsing Quick Start, you will need to complete the following additional screen on the new device:\n\n\n*\n\n*Entering your old device passcode (which you may have to do anyway depending on your setup, regardless of whether you use Quick Start or not)\n\n\nQuick Start has no effect on how data is restored. You must still have first created an up to date backup, and select that as the source from which to restore.\n\nA: The guide you link to - step 6 explains how \"Quick Start\" automates away many of the taps to set up the new device using an iCloud backup. This does rely on bluetooth and wifi to enable a continuity connection to share the status of a backup and initiate the backups / restores. \n\nYour new device offers the choice of restoring apps, data, and settings from your most recent iCloud backup, or updating your current device's backup and then restoring\n\nWifi is still required to back up to iCloud and download the larger apps once the iCloud data and list of apps needed is downloaded from iCloud. Continuity ad hoc network is just used to signal the status and share wifi credentials, not transfer all the data.\n\nYou didn't ask, but in case you wonder how to speed things up, we set up caching servers which lets your iCloud backup be stored locally as well as caching app instals. This speeds the backup and setup process sometimes 4 to 8 times as fast as if you had a very good internet connection and no caching server. If you have a caching server at home and backup for several nights, you might see 10x or even higher speedups based on your internet speed and the cache being fully primed with the data and apps you need.\n", "Q: How to make iPhone charge over USB cable when locked? iPhone 6s, running iOS 12.0.1\nPlugging the phone into a computer to charge produces an \"Unlock iPhone to use accessories\" message and the phone refuses to charge.\nHow do I fix this nonsensical behavior? I know Apple added a privacy feature where the phone disables the data connection on lock to thwart hacktools that plug into the phone and brute-force the access code, but there's no reason to disable charging-only while it's locked. In this particular case, I only need to charge the phone over a computer; it doesn't need data access.\nI'd like to avoid having to buy additional hardware such as a separate power-only limited USB cable.\n\nA: Fixed.\nGo into the security settings (Settings -> Touch ID and Passcode), and enable the \"USB Accessories\" switch (it should be green with the virtual switch-button to the right). This enables charging off any connection while locked.\nUnfortunately this also disables the privacy/security feature that thwarts hacktools with physical access, so if you enable the USB Accessories option you will want to take extra precautions to prevent unauthorized physical device access and refrain from plugging into dodgy machines.\n\nA: Newer iOS and hardware have a way to relax the security and allow charging / negotiation of fast charge even while locked. I'll let the OP answer cover that detail and keep the older details here.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/351469/5472\nThe iPhone will charge at lower rates from a pure charging port, so you just want to put a data blocker on the USB so that the phone won't reject a computer and see a charge only device.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.amazon.com/PortaPow-3rd-Data-Blocker-Pack/dp/B00T0DW3F8\nThere are many of these and you generally get what you pay for in low cost USB accessories. I'd expect to pay $10 for either one good blocker or a pair in the US. I know you didn't want to buy hardware, but unless you can get your computer to stop signaling it's a USB data connection, iOS is going to shut down the port since that's \"what it do\".\n\nA: If you have an extra usb cable for your iPhone you may make a charge only cable by cutting the data wires. In an iPhone Charge&Sync cable, you will find 4 wires (because usb uses 4 wires to communicate, you have the data +/- and the +5v and ground) of various colors. I found a tutorial on how to clip the data lines on a usb cable on inscrutables. The general idea is the same, except it's an ios cord, and not a microusb.

There is a website called Sensor Tower which lets you see up to 365 days but it requires a subscription. \nAlternatively, for some stories, you can tap on the Share Story button shown at bottom, copy the link and send it to yourself. However, this approach is highly manual, would have required following it since the day App Store redesign was publicly launched. Also, it is not possible to do so if you want to start out today as the older feed entries can no longer be accessed\n\nA: Seeing as that iirc that part of iOS's app store is a WebKit based thing, probably not. Though you may look under top charts under free as it may be on the top charts list. (Your mileage may vary this is based on my iPhone 4s which is running 7.1.2)\n\nA: I tried asking a few reps from Apple tech support if they had a way to provide me a share link from a recent date and/or if they had a \"Today\" story history or archive they could search.  They all told me no, it's not accessible to them, and not available to the public from what they are able to gather.  It seems very odd considering these are all are available within some parent folder as shown from the links below, and it's a waste of promotional resources by not allowing customers to search previous dates for curated apps.\nIf you know part of the title it should show up in the search results as a story.  For ex, these showed up for me when I searched for them using the Search tab:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1410000361\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1348055525\n", "Q: Does iPhone XR have true 1080p? Since iPhone XR has 1792 x 828 resolution, does it actually have 1080p?\nOne thing is that, it actually might have lower resolution than iPhone 6 Plus, because iPhone 6 Plus has 1920 x 1080 Retina.\nBut if you consider that iPhones have been using Retina, you can say that iPhone XR's 1792 x 828 resolution is really 3584 x 1656 and is therefore way beyond 1080p. But can you really say that?\n(If you can really say that, then iPhone 6 Plus actually have 3840 x 2160 and therefore really is 4k resolution?)\n\nA: When Apple states the resolution, such as 1920 x 1080 Retina, it turns out it is 1920 x 1080 tiny pixels. So it does not have 3840 x 2160 tiny pixels.\nI am not sure if Apple at one point stated their Retina resolution for the Mac or iPhone / iPad without multiplying the width and height by 2. But right now, when the resolution is stated, such as 1920 x 1080, it doesn't mean it is 1920 x 1080 big pixels and that they use 4 tiny pixels to display 1 big pixel. It actually means it is 1920 x 1080 tiny pixels.\nSo as a result, for the iPhone XR, it is 1792 x 828 tiny pixels, and so it does not reach the 1080p resolution.  Personally, if I watch a movie on the iPhone XR, versus if it is on iPhone 7 Plus or iPhone X, I do sense that the iPhone XR picture quality is slightly less, although you can still say it is very good.\n", "Q: With AppleScript how can you check if spctl is enabled?

Introduced in OS X version 10.5 (Leopard), the Scripting Bridge framework dynamically implements an Objective-C bridge to OSA-compliant applications—that is, applications having a scripting interface (usually defined in a sdef file). As part of this implementation, it generates Objective-C class implementations of the classes it finds in the scripting interface, including objects and methods representing properties, elements, commands, and so on. The objects are derived from classes defined in the Scripting Bridge framework.\n\nAppleScript Approach\nA discussion on MacScripter suggests this approach:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set myPID to unix id of process \"TextEdit\"\n    -- ...for every matching process\n    -- set myPIDs to the unix id of processes whose name is \"TextEdit\"\n\n    set myProcess to first process whose unix id is myPID\n    set the frontmost of myProcess to true\nend tell\n\nSee also: How to activate Mac OS X application with a given process ID?\n\n", "Q: macOS not allowing me to restore media files from one external drive to another \nI am trying to restore media from an external drive to another\n  external drive now both the partitions have been formatted with the\n  same partition map GUID partition map (I am also getting an APFS\n  partition message on clicking the partition map option available under\n  disk utility)).

If not, detach will attempt\n            to unmount any filesystems and detach the image directly\n            (using the `eject' ioctl).  If Disk Arbitration is not run-\n            ning, it may be necessary to unmount the filesystems with\n            umount(8) before detaching the image.  eject is a synonym for\n            detach.

I am booting from an M2 SSD (PCI) on my Mac Pro 2012.\nRunning Mojave. I tried to run the Boot Camp Assistant but it doesn't run and I've seen solutions saying that you have to have Journaling enabled. If I'm using APFS, can I even enable Journaling in order to make Boot Camp work? Or if not, does that mean if you are using APFS you can't use boot camp assistant? There doesnt seem to be an option to enable Journaling on the drive so I dont want to try to force it in Terminal if its not even possible. Source of the pic: https://www.howtogeek.com/331042/whats-the-difference-between-apfs-macos-extended-hfs-and-exfat/\n\n\nA: There’s basically zero downside for journaling the filesystem metadata and huge, huge upsides so even though you don’t need to do it, I recommend everyone does it as if they needed to. The only reason not to enable journaling is if you have some desire to test failure modes of a less robust filesystem. \nAs to the larger question, the boot camp info you read likely is wrong (please link to the exact article or advice if we can help be precise if it is outdated or correct). \nWhat’s true is you can’t have APFS and boot camp. Pick either / or\n\n\n*\n\n*HFS with journal and the possibility to use boot camp\n\n*APFS which journals always and no possibility to use boot camp that shares space with APFS\n\n\nNow you can partition your drive to be part APFS and part HFS / bootcamp, so here is the boot camp FAQ for Mojave if you want to go ahead with that plan:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468\n\nA: Yes, I think you are right, the journaling thing was for a similar but different error. My error is this, my Mac does not support Boot Camp. Instead I switched to a different drive with Sierra installed and it let me into Boot Camp Assistant - it didnt work but it let me in. I explain the steps below.\n\nI've close to given up, but so far I've managed to get the Bootcamp partition installed. \nMy setup has some \"unsupported things\" which has complicated things\n\n\n*\n\n*cMP 2012 5,1 (12 core) with RX580 which just replaced my HD5870 stock GPU.\n\n*M2 SSD connected via PCI (with Mojave)\n\n*1TB SSD (with Sierra)\n\n*2TB HD  (also Sierra - I dont use this)\n\n\nInstalling Boot Camp\nMy goal: to install Bootcamp onto the 2TB drive.\nThings I've done so far\n\n\n*\n\n*I followed this video to which was helpful but I wasn't able to finish all the steps.\n\n*I switched to my Sierra install on a regular SSD which let me load Boot Camp assistant (without the error above). It had problems however because Mac Pro 2012 can't boot to USB. So I saw some tips on how to edit the PLIST file (removed MacPro5,1 from the PreUSB something). That got me 1 step further but only Win7 could install. So I went back into the PLIST and removed my MacPro5,1 from a couple more lines and finally it would allow \"Win7 or later\" Yay!\n\n*WIN10 ISO: Now I needed the Win10 ISO on a bootable USB (or so I thought). So I fought with the Win10 bootable disk maker which kept giving errors until I found a 3rd party tool to make the bootable USB with the ISO. It worked. Then I discovered that the Bootcamp assistant is going to erase the USB and install it's own. Boot Camp assistant errored out a couple times, I tried one last time, it worked! Yay.\n\n*Partition: Bootcamp assistant allowed me to make a Win10 Partition on my 2tb HD. The computer restarted itself and then I got this fun error \"No bootable device -- insert boot disk\", below is a not my screen shot but a similar one found on google. I guess this is because the MacPro5,1 cannot boot to USB which is why they restrict it (which I hacked above to remove that restriction)\n\n\n*Boot Camp Partition Now I have an RX580 GPU so I can't see the boot screen selector. So I put in my stock video card so I can see and hold down the option menu and select the BootCamp partition, but... there IS NO BOOT CAMP Partition. I reboot to OSX and see the BootCamp partition but can't get to it. If I was able to manually select it as the boot drive, according to that video I linked above, I should be able to insert the USB and install Win10.\n\n*STUCK: So here I am, I can't install Win10 on the Bootcamp partition because I can't manually select the BootCamp partition during the boot process. I just put my rX580 back in and gave up. I've only spent a good 15 hours troubleshooting all this over the course of a week. Complete waste of time but I know others have done it so I knew it was possible. So close I can smell it but I don't know how to proceed.\n", "Q: APFS partition inaccessible, container missing I'm running macOS Mojave on a late-2015 4k 21.5\" iMac.\nI have lost access to my internal hard drive, but I can use my iMac by running macOS from an external drive or through recovery mode.\nWhen I hold down the option key on boot, the only available drive shown is my external one. Last time I tried booting without holding option, I was greeted by the folder icon with the question mark in it.\nI have not deleted my data, not even accidentally, it is all still there and I can see it using iBoysoft APFS data recovery.\nThis problem started when I tried to install Ubuntu on a partition using this guide https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-dual-boot-ubuntu-mac/ (I tried to follow all the steps carefully, but I may have made a mistake) and afterwards in Disk Utility my drive was called FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF. My Mac was still running fine, but when I restarted it, it would no longer boot into macOS. I searched the internet for this problem and any solutions and I found a few. I went through these guides and did as they said, and I'm pretty confident I changed the numbers for sizes etc. correctly for my own situation, but even after following these guides I still cannot boot into macOS on my internal HD.\nMy HD is 1TB, my mac partition is 960GB, my Ubuntu one was 40GB but I deleted that and installed macOS Sierra on it, but that disappeared at some point too.\nI managed to get my Mac to recognise that the data is in APFS format and that it's actually there, it just wont interact with it outside of terminal.\nMy APFS partition doesn't seem to have a container, as far as I understand APFS (not very far), it needs a container. I did not delete the container but I think it has been lost. Maybe it need to be rebuilt or the APFS partition needs to be put in one somehow, but I don't know how to do either of those things.\nAnother note is that the partition was 960GB but now shows as 883GB - I don't know what this means, that may have been the amount of data on the partition, but that seems maybe a little high.\nI'm not nearly good enough with macOS or terminal to be messing around with it without help and I probably shouldn't have tried to install Ubuntu on my main hard drive without a recent backup, but I could really do with some help and I'd appreciate it a lot.\nhere are the results of some terminal commands, they will be more reliable than my guesses and explanations:\ndiskutil list\n(disk0 is my internal HD, disk1 & disk2 are just the external USB drive I installed macOS on so that I can still use my iMac)\n\nsudo gpt -r show disk0\n\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk0 bs=512 count=1 skip=409640 | hexdump -Cv\n\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk0 bs=512 count=1 skip=228482040 | hexdump -Cv\n\nEdit 20/10 22:30: After trying to mount or repair the volumes of disk0 in any way I could on my USB drive macOS install, I gave booting into recovery mode another try. I tried repairing in Disk Utility, but it told me I needed to do that in recovery mode (I was in recovery mode) and told me to press continue and nothing happened, so I used diskutil repairvolume in the recovery terminal and it said something about how I couldn't because my APFS volume doesn't have a container (other diskutil commands told me that it wasn't an APFS volume or didn't even use APFS, so I think its lack of container was giving my computer a hard time). I looked around some more, searching the error messages I got, and came up pretty empty (it doesn't help that APFS is relatively new and so is Mojave). So now I'm currently running some APFS data recovery software (Disk Drill) so I can do a fresh install of macOS on my iMac internal HD and just import my recovered old data onto it. Before I wipe my internal HD I'll try fixing it in single user mode with '/sbin/fsck -fy', but I'm not hopeful. This will presumably take at least a day though, and may not work out as planned, so if anyone can provide me with a way of creating an APFS container and putting my APFS volume into it so that my system can read it, that would be great. If you need the results of terminal used in recovery mode, I can do that, but unless there's a way of capturing screenshots in recovery mode, they'll be photos of a screen.\nCurrent 'diskutil list disk0' and 'sudo gpt -r show disk0' results\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_Boot                         650.0 MB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_APFS                         883.2 GB   disk0s3\n\n\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         PMBR\n           1           1         Pri GPT header\n           2          32         Pri GPT table\n          34           6         \n          40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n      409640   226802864         \n   227212504     1269536      2  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n   228482040  1725043095      3  GPT part - 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  1953525135          32         Sec GPT table\n  1953525167           1         Sec GPT header\n\nThank you for any help or suggestions\n\nA: \nNote: Posting images of the output from the Terminal application can often lead to users not posting an answer to a question.

Below are three reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*The magic number stored in the header is incorrect. Also, the header defines the block size to be 2,385,839,421 bytes and the APFS container to be 2,777,634,813,198,357 TB in size. The magic number should be BSXN. The block size should be 4096 bytes and the container should be less than or equal to 883,222,061,056 bytes in size.\n\n*The APFS partition size of 1,725,043,095 logical sectors is not divisible by 8.\n\n*The APFS partition should appear either immediately and soon after the EFI partition (disk0s1). Here, the partition starts 116,773,068,800 bytes after the end of the EFI partition.\n\n\nIt appears that an APFS partition of 960,018,657,280 bytes in size did occur immediately after the EFI partition (disk0s1). The problem is the data stored in the APFS partition was partially overwritten by the data now stored in disk0s3. The type and location of disk0s3 would indicate that macOS Sierra may have been installed close or immediately before disk0s3. If this is true, then additional data stored in the APFS partition may have been overwritten.\n\nNote: The partition entries stored in the GPT are not in ascending order. While this does not create problems for Ubuntu, this condition oftend leads to an incorrectly functioning macOS.  \n\nTo correct the GPT, you need to remove the second and third entries. The commands are given below.\n\nNote: You must unmount all volumes from disk0 before entering the commands given below.\n\nsudo gpt remove -i 2 /dev/disk0\nsudo gpt remove -i 3 /dev/disk0\n\nThe command below will add the APFS container to the GPT.\nsudo gpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 1875036440 -t apfs /dev/disk0\n\nThere is no guarantee fixing the GPT will automatically lead to a correctly functioning APFS partition.\nWhen finished, the output from sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 should appear as shown below.\n     start        size  index  contents\n         0           1         PMBR\n         1           1         Pri GPT header\n         2          32         Pri GPT table\n        34           6         \n        40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n    409640  1875036440      2  GPT part - 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n1875446080    78079055         \n1953525135          32         Sec GPT table\n1953525167           1         Sec GPT header\n\n\nA: David Anderson's answer above is gold. Do bear in mind, that the values used in the command below (1875036440 blocks(512)) used here is as per the situation given by OP.\nsudo gpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 1875036440 -t apfs /dev/disk0 \nChange those values according to the output of your  sudo gpt -r show disk0. Replace them with the size of your messed up partition.\nFor example, I had the exact same prob as OP. I had 3 partitions for my SDD. The first parition (APFS) got messed up. The rest of the partitions (partition2, partition3) were HFS. \nIn the gpt add command I entered the size of my partition , and voila, on restarting my computer, MacOS came back.\n\nA: Hint for Recovery: Data might still be accessible using linux and apfs-fuse\nUnfortunately I've ran into the same problem on my Bootcamp setup while attempting to extend my MacOS partition using Disk Utility after shrinking my Windows partition using diskmgmt. It displayed an error but remained usable until the next reboot. Afterwards MacOS wasn't shown among the startup options and Windows would't boot as well. Even when running Internet Recovery, the disk couldn't be erased neither using Disk Utility nor diskutil. Reinstalling MacOS obviously failed. This is where I've come to read this highly informative thread.\nLuckily I'm \"triple booting\" with Debian on a USB disk and decided on attempting to mount the MacOS partition before doing further modifications to it. Therefore I've checked lsblk and found the partition to be correctly registered there:\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1: Macintosh Boot\n\n*/dev/sda2: Macintosh System & Data (FileVault)\n\n*/dev/sda3: Windows Boot\n\n*/dev/sda4: Windows System & Data (Bitlocker)\n\nThe respective labels can be retrieved using blkid.\nNext I've downloaded the apfs-fuse source and followed the installation instructions, whereby the package cmake-curses-gui was additionally required. Upon completion, the compiled apfs-fuse application can be used to mount the MacOS partition - preferably read only.\nAs the partition seems to be accessible, I don't understand why Disk Utility is incapable to fix the present error. But given this option to backup even recent changes, the consequences remain mild.\n", "Q: OS will not mount the VM partition.

But I'm not able to write that or other characters, which the system allowed me to include when I configured the password.\n\nA: Finally and with the help of my friend Víctor I have managed to solve the problem. An important detail is that I use a Spanish keyboard layout. When you configure the firmware password from the recovery mode of the operative, your local keyboard configuration is loaded. However, when you try to enter the firmware password the distribution that is loaded is the American.\nSo, to enter the special characters of your password you will need to know how they're transcribed using your keyboard as an American keyboard. E.g.: in a Spanish keyboard, the # is written using ⌥ option + 3 and in an American, ⇧ shift + 3. In the login password screen of the firmware you'll have to use ⇧ shift + 3 to input it.\nIn honor of the truth, when you configure your firmware password a comment urges you only to use letters, numbers and punctuation symbols. I must admit that I didn't notice that warning. And being an advanced and very careful user, I established a potentially dangerous password for the integrity of my system without perceive it. I consider it's an important error in the system.\nI can only reiterate the gratitude to my friend Víctor for his help this morning. We use his Mac to transcribe my password with an American keyboard layout.\n", "Q: When is Apple Watch backed up to a paired iPhone? I'm unsure about exactly when an Apple Watch gets backed up to an iPhone with which it is paired. Online sources are a bit vague and say a variety of things (some are perhaps outdated). Is it\n\n\n*\n\n*only when Watch is unpaired,\n\n*whenever the paired iPhone is backed up (and the Apple Watch is connected via Bluetooth), or\n\n*periodically?\nOr is it something else?\n\nA: You can be sure the watch backs up only when you unpair it. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204518\nApple says it backs up automatically but since you can’t check on that by tapping anywhere or logging into iCloud or looking in preferences, you don’t know when it happens or the date of the last backup. \nThe only way to check your available backups is when you pair any watch (e.g. you have a second watch or a friend that’s willing to unpair theirs or has a spare) and step through the pairing process and have your iPhone list the available backups and date ranges of backups. iCloud keeps multiple backups in time, sort of like time machine so you may have a choice of when to restore from your backups. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro Certificate - no value specified - Business Category : Private Organization Today after I signed into my computer and opened Safari this window popped up: \n\nI am looking for help to know what this is, and what I need to do.

Since the warranty was already voided, I opened it up myself, took pretty much everything out, wiped the components with some rubbing alcohol, then assembled everything back. At this point, the fans were very loud and the battery was alternating between 0% and 50%. None of this was happening BEFORE I disassembled the Macbook.\nA few days ago I tried submerging the logicboard in rubbing alcohol (70% isopropylic alcohol, 30% distilled water + blue colouring) for about 48 hours, occasionally brushing it with a clean tootbrush to help lodge some of the orange bits that got stuck. I reassembled it, and now it won't power on at all! I'm not 100% sure I assembled it back correctly. I most likely did, but not being an Apple/Macbook expert...\nDoes anyone have any idea at all about what might be causing it not to power up? Did the rubbing alcohol damaged the logicboard more than it was already damaged?\nWould it help if I wiped/submerged the logicboard in 99% isopropylic alcohol in an ultrasonic bath? I think buying an ultrasonic cleaner will be cheaper than paying $1.200 at Apple.\nAny insight would be helpful. Btw, this is my very first (and last) Macbook.\nThanks!\nBest regards!\n\nA: From my experience, your Mac is done.\nOnly in very rare cases some survive a liquid spill, but that depends on many factors like the amount of liquid.\nAs far as I know cleaning will not bring it back the damage is already done.

I checked the backup size on my Mac and it says 7 GB, so is it safe to assume that it was a full backup?\n\nA: It is \"full\" in the sense that everything that is ACTUALLY on your device is backed up (minus payment and password/security settings for obvious security reasons), but it is NOT full in the sense that not everything you see on your device is truly \"on\" your device. Some stuff is merely just a shortcut (for the sake of a longer explanation) to items stored in iCloud.

In High Sierra or Mojave, is it possible to harden our login password so that the hash is more difficult to crack? I'm not a crypto person, but can we increase the iterations, transforms, hashing algo strenth or something... to make the CPU work harder when using sudo and such? I know Debian/Ubuntu distros are capable of such hardening and keepass has a similar feature. Is it possible in macOS?\n\nA: On MacOS you can use PBKD2 (Password Based Key Derivation 2) to create secure password verifiers. This is an accepted method by NIST. Supply a random salt (you can save it with the hashed password) and an iteration count such the the derivation takes around 100ms.\nWhen saving a password verifier just using a hash function is not sufficient and just adding a salt does little to improve the security. Instead iterate over an HMAC with a random salt for about a 100ms duration and save the salt with the hash. Better yet use a function such as PBKDF2, Rfc2898DeriveBytes, Argon2, password_hash, Bcrypt or similar functions. The point is to make the attacker spend substantial time finding passwords by brute force.\nSee NIST Digital Identity Guidelines\nSee this How to use CommonCrypto for PBKDF2 in Swift 2 & 3\n or example code.\n", "Q: 'alt vs option': Is the 'option' key still used somewhere?

My second Apple computer too.\nI haven't seen a single Apple computer or a single Apple keyboard with an \"Option\" key though. I know \"Alt\" and \"Option\" is the same from any practical point of view. I've been working as an iOS developer for years. I learned about the \"Option\" key only a few years ago. I heard it in a Youtube video, I think. It is often used in contexts like this:\n\nIf you are a Windows user, press Alt P, if you are a Mac user press Option P\n\nObviously, I'm a Windows user then..\nThis is probably a history question..\nWhen was the last time Apple did produce keyboards with a key that is labelled \"Option\"? Do they still produce these keyboards? (Notebooks count as well.)\nWere they sold everywhere, or just in particular countries? For example, I'm from Europe, so maybe the \"Option\" key is a US thing and it was never sold in Europe, which would explain why I never saw it, and which would also explain why we still hear about \"Option\" keys from time to time.\nInterestingly, the \"Alt\"-key is sometimes called \"Wahl-Taste\" in German. It sounds really strange, and I didn't ever hear a Mac user call that key \"Wahl-Taste\" in real life. It seems like if Windows users are trying to be nice to Mac users without realizing that they just messed up.\n\nA: Images from Apple KB - How to identify keyboard localizations\nUS Keyboards say  alt\nOption  \n\nOther keyboards say   alt\n⌥  \n\nBasically, it's one & the same key.  \nBest guess is there are so many people who know Alt is but don't know Option that the terms have just merged over the years.\nI haven't had a keyboard in at least a decade that actually said Option, though I remember they all did back in the 90s.\nI found this 'keyboard history' article from 2007 - though it's not the main topic, it is mentioned - How Apple Keyboards Lost a Logo and Windows PCs Gained One\n\nMac Integration with Windows.\n  As it became increasingly useful for Mac users to emulate Windows or work in shared environments, the Option key on Macs became equated with the Alt key on PCs, and the Command key was associated with the ineffectual Windows Start button.\n\n** After comments & other answers\nIt appears that the Apple have changed the keyboards over the years since they made the keyboard layout page, but not updated the page to cover every current keyboard.\nThe answer is still really it depends - some do, some don't, in every conceivable combination ;)\n", "Q: What is the process „Tornit“?

I've never had any issue on my 2013 MBP or my 2009 MBP trackpad.  The 2018 MBP's trackpad is impractically huge, and the heel or base of my thumb would register a false click while I'm typing or changing in between typing and trackpad use. \nI had to enable dragging (without drag lock) since I'm so used to tap-to-click and that exacerbate the issue bad enough that I can't even complete typing any email without repositioning the cursor, or worst, undo-ing jobs manually because the trackpad falsely double-register a tab selection and insert/delete lines as I type, especially while I'm typing or coding fast. \nWhat makes it worst is also the trackpad is slightly off centered to the right making the right thumb base more prone to false registering as a finger.\nI tried a few suggestions found on google and played with the sensitivity but none really helps. I resort to cover the side of trackpad (plastic-foil-plastic layer) to block it off. It's not a perfect solution but at least it takes care of most (~90%) of false registering. But that also means I cannot swipe from edge to bring up notification center. Plus it looks clumsy after spending that much money on a MBP.\nHaving been using MBP most of my life I'm sure I'm not the only person having this issues with 2018 MBP - is there a better or preferred (software) solution to improve the palm rejection?\n\n\nA: Unfortunately palm rejection has never worked properly with the larger trackpad, and there is no fix for it. Just search for \"macbook pro palm rejection\" and you will discover many tales of woe but no actual fixes that work properly. Turning off tap to click doesn't help - besides tape or using an external pointing device, it seems there is little we can do until Apple fixes this hideous defect.\n\nA: Having looked for a solution, including here, and not finding anything, here's what I created: a 3D-printed \"palm guard\" that slides on and off.\n\nMore info is available at 3D-printing service Shapeways.\n", "Q: Can Mid 2010 Apple Macbook Pro 15\" NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M graphics processor be Upgraded?

Made FaceTime audio call, but then switched to video.  Top of screen claimed \"call failed\" but we were still talking.  Then the iPad began begging me to answer the call!  It gave up and we were still on.  iPad was not a call from someone else.\nSomething else disconnected us, and when I called again, this time the iPad did not interfere.\nIs the first just a fluke, or must I do something to prevent the iPad from trying to hijack a call on the Macbook?  (Hopefully something other than shutting it down!)\n\nA: No - there's no cross talk possible since Apple uses different encryption keys for each device. All of them receive a notification / offer to start the call and continuity would allow you to hand off a call from one device to the other.\nIf you're distracted or worried, you can sign out of FaceTime / Messages on the device you want to be sure isn't bugging you, but architecturally - there's no downside / benefit to having more than one device signed in other than if your network can't handle the signaling items or can't NAT the traffic correctly.\n", "Q: Set iOS device into Kiosk mode and get the screen not to \"sleep\" I've got an iPad Mini 4 running iOS 12 in a in-wall dock that I want to leave locked to one app and always on. The wall dock provides power to the iPad.\nTo have the iPad locked to one app I put it into Kiosk Mode.\nI have set the settings for auto-lock as per the screenshot below, but I can't seem to get it to stay constantly on i.e. not to go into sleep mode.\nI've had this working fine on other iPads using the same spec wall docks in the past, but I can't get it to work the latest time I've tried to deploy this. I think its got something to do with iOS 12 as my previous installs have been running iOS 10 and 11, and because they are locked into Kiosk app mode the OS never gets updated. I have also tested on my personal iPad mini 4 (iOS12) by plugging it into the power, setting sleep settings as per the screenshot above, and putting the iPad in kiosk mode locked to one app, but after about 30 mins it locks / dims the screen, it does seem to \"wake\" again if I get an alert on that device, but it only lasts for another 30 or so minutes. \nAny ideas how I can get this to work so that the iPad will be locked to one app and the screen will stay on constantly? \nIdeally I don't want to do this, but if necessary I would be willing to lock the device down in some sort of enterprise management mode where I can have more control over the device instead of using the Kiosk mode \"hack\" approach above if it resolved the issue.\n(People may say that iPads are not designed to be always on/always charged, but I've had a few installs like this running for 2+ years with no issues).\n\n\nA: You can set the iPad display to never turn-off automatically. Go to Settings app → Display & Brightness → Auto-Lock and select Never.\n\n\n\nA: Ive been doing some testing on the issue and reading up on the further reading below. \nIt seems that the issue is related to iOS12. \nIve done some testing and it seems that if you lock the iOS device (in this case an iPad mini 4) into \"single app mode\" using the guided access workflow and set sleep > never via settings, the screen lock doesn't work. \nBut if you put the iOS device into sleep > never and dont put the device into \"single app mode\" but rather just leave one app running, the iPad dosnt go to sleep. Its not an ideal solution as someone can still switch apps, but its an Ok work around. You should also disable notifications so they dont show up to the screen. \nIf i have time i may try adopting this iPad into MDM mode via Apple device manager, which i understand has another way to lock a device into \"single app mode\"\nFurther reading : \nreddit.com\ndiscussions.apple.com\ndiscussions.apple.com\n\nA: I had the same problem with iPad and Guided Access, and the bug has been corrected with iOS 12.1.1 December 5 2018.\nIn the guided access config menu they added a switch \"Mirror Display Auto-Lock\" you have to switch on.

It is impossible for there to be a one size fits all instructions for installing Windows on Mac computers. Second, the article is more than 2 years old. A lot has changed in two years. Any Macs capable of running High Sierra have had a firmware upgrade making many of the articles steps either obsolete or unnecessary.\nHere a few comments with regard to the linked article.\n\n\n*\n\n*I assume you used your iMac Pro to download the Windows Support Software. Using a different Mac can lead to the wrong download.\n\n*You do not need to use unetbootin. If fact, you do not even need a USB flash drive.\n\n*Starting with with High Sierra, macOS no longer creates Hybrid partitioned drives. So, you should not have to use gdisk.\n\n*The article does not mention System Integrity Protection (SIP). You should not have to disable SIP to install Windows.\n\n*I assume your installation did not include a Window Recovery Environment partition. I assume this because the article did not provide the necessary steps to create one.\n\n*The article included a step where the Windows Support Software (the legacy name is Boot Camp Support Software) is installed. Below is image taken from the article.\n\nNote, there is a folder named WindowsSupport. This is a monumental error. If you have this folder on your flash drive, then I will assume this folder contains the folder named $WinPEDriver$. If so, then none of the Windows Support Software drivers needed properly install Windows were provided to the Windows installation software. If the WindowsSupport folder contains an AutoUnattend.xml file, then the Windows installation software did not receive any addition instructions provided by Apple to correctly install the Windows operating system.\nAn example of how the files should appear in the root folder of the Windows installation media is shown below. This image was taken from this Apple website. \n\nYou may want to refer the the question: How to install Windows 10 into a 2013 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, USB flash drive or third party tools?

I can hear my mac if I plug something into the 3.5 mm port but otherwise the speakers won't play anything and my wifi isnt working either.

I saw someone use Atheros 938x and that driver installed and didn't give a message about the controller unable to be turned on. So I'll work with that.\nFor ethernet, maybe try some Atheros ethernet drivers. Don't use the folder, go in device manager and select ethernet controller and right click it to update the driver. Then manually select drivers (don't use windows update or the driver search) and scroll for the ethernet controller drivers and try Atheros folder and Broadcom Connections Inc. or whatever it's called.\n", "Q: Received an email saying someone has hacked my email account I received an email saying that someone has hacked my email over 6 months ago and they say that through it they have infected my operating system with a virus.

Change your password. *\nMost of the email addresses that are receiving these, are from leaked databases that may have contained your actual password. They are mass mailing and mail merging people from this database, looking for money, or even a response. Chances are high that they indeed DO have the correct password, it's why they include it in the email. if the password supplied in the email is your actual password for any site or service, change your password on those sites, but not via any links in this scam email\n2. Do NOT respond. Delete the email.\nAny response at all, singles you out from the literal millions of people in the same situation, is going to single you out from background noise. Whether you are saying \"Get lost, that's not my password\" or \"Please don't hack me, here is $$$\" or \"Come at me, I have nothing important\" You have still engaged them, told them it's a live email address, and that you are prone to reading and responding. This increases value in your email address and you will either be sold on as a 'lead' to someone else, or actively exploited by the spammer.\n\nNever Ever consider paying them\nIf you pay them, they realize they had leverage, why would they stop when they just got a positive hit and payment? They will use this to pivot, blackmailing you further, actually hacking your accounts, grabbing nudes and distributing them on facebook etc, unless you pay them a monthly fee, or help them launder money, send parcels in the mail etc.\n\nA: Yes, it is a scam. There are two clever things that it does to make itself appear real (at least, more real than most scams), but those can be relatively easily debunked.\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly, it uses your own e-mail address as the \"From\" address. However, just like you can write any address on the back of an envelope before slipping it in the box and no one is going to check whether it is really your address, you can in principle write any address in the \"From\" header of an e-mail. (Some e-mail services may not allow you to do this, but it is a limitation of those particular services, and not of the e-mail medium itself.) Therefore, just because your e-mail address appears is no proof that your account was compromised.\n\n*Secondly, it shows you a string that it claims is the password for your e-mail, and this claim actually has a non-negligible chance of being correct. Remember those \"Big Website compromised; user data leaked!\" headlines you see in the news from time to time? Well, you probably had an account on one of those websites using your e-mail address and that password; the scammer obtained that information from the leaked data and is betting that you use the same password for your e-mail account. Have I Been Pwned? is a useful service that aggregates all the leaked data from known breaches so you can check whether your e-mail or password appears in any of them.\nFinally, you can search for the given bitcoin address on a bitcoin lookup service such as this one; it has almost certainly been reported as a scam already (and you can see from the address's activity that these scams do work).\n\nA: Many years ago, during college, I received a similar email, but the fun part was, it was from my own email address\nIt turned out to be a prank from friends\nIf you used an edu mail server, gmail used to trust any sender address as valid, even if it's your own email address\nSo to extend the asked question a bit, even if you receive such an email from your own email address (you should check the original email data and) ignore it\n", "Q: Is it possible to block macOS Mojave installation?

Is there no way to know other than checking all my apps in store one by one?\nHave you experienced losing other specific data (app data, iOS settings, etc) when restoring via iTunes?\nI can't stand that after clearing gigabytes of data, the system still warns me about \"not enough space\". Or when it downloads 2gb of iOS 12 without asking and then warns about not enough space. Or when I remove that update, and it says that I have only 1gb available (wut).\nBut I want to be prepared for what comes, cause I really hate having reinstalling OS'es and losing data in the process, just cause I wanted everything to work properly.\n\nA: What is not included in the iTunes backup itself:\n\n\n*\n\n*Media (synced with iTunes but not in the backup). Videos, music, podcasts, etc.\n\n*Books (can be synced with iCloud or exported with third-party iTunes replacer if stored locally). Includes both ePub and PDF stored in iBooks app.\n\n*Apps that are no longer on the AppStore and not accessible via Purchased > Not on this phone (as you've already mentioned). But app\ndata is still saved in the backup and can be accessed with\nthird-party apps.\n\n*App data of some apps. App developers decide what to include in the backup, so be careful with messengers like Viber or Signal (they\ncan have a separate backup way, check google), or with important\ndocs.

When I am working on something and get a notification about a new mail I click it and the mail opens for me to read it in front of whatever application I was using as expected.\nThen, when I am done reading it and close it Mail.app becomes active and blocks my view of whatever I was doing before getting the mail. I then have to alt-tab to get back to what I was doing before.\nIt's a tiny thing but having done it for years I've had enough..\nIs it possible to disable this behaviour somehow?\n\nA: When I click on the mail notification, it opens the email in a viewing window, but it's also switching you to the Mail application. When you close that window, the main viewer probably comes up because its the only other window that's open in Mail. You can't have a mail viewer window open and be on top of Safari windows, while still being in Safari. (Safari for example)\nBut that said, if you keep your regular mail viewer window closed when you're not directly using it, it won't pop up in front of your work when you close the viewer window. You'll still be in Mail.app at this point, but your work should still be right on your screen so the first click you do will bring that app back to the front, whatever app it is.\n", "Q: MacBook Air's Mini Display vs Thunderbolt I can't find the right info on this, everything that I'm reading is mostly about monitors and HDMI about this topic.\nSo my questions is... can I run an ethernet adapter for internet access through a 2010 MBA model that has the Mini Display Port or is this only a capability with the Thunderbolt replacement port for the 2011 MBA models? \n\nA: It is only possible with the Thunderbolt port. You cannot run an ethernet adapter on a Mini Display Port.\nHowever, you can use a USB Ethernet Adapter and connect to your network with that.\n", "Q: Safari tabs rarely restoring to their respective desktops after restarting When I restart my laptop (or log off and back on again), I expect apps like Safari to open up and restore all of the tabs and windows that I previously had. I also expect that the Safari tabs will restore to their respective desktops—so, for example, if I have Safari windows in Desktops 1, 3, and 5, I expect them to open up with their corresponding tabs in Desktops 1, 3, and 5 again after I log in.\nHowever, that seems to happen only about 25% percent of the time. The rest of the time, Safari dumps all of the windows on Desktop 1. This seems to be the behavior which I am experiencing as far as I can remember, since High Sierra at least, all the way now to Mojave.\nIn contrast, apps like Pages and Finder always assign their windows to the correct desktops. \nOther apps have this problem, like Sublime Text and Skim, but since they are third-party apps I'll give them some leeway and won't hold anything on the developers. However, this is not the type of behavior I would expect from stock macOS apps. \nOne thing to note is that any minimized Safari windows that I have always stay minimized, as they should. The behavior I am describing only affects visible windows. \nIs there any sort of way to make the restoring behavior more consistent during log in, or is that some sort of the bug that Apple hasn't fixed?\n\nA: Apps cannot be assigned to multiple Spaces.\nIf you split multiple windows of any single app to to separate desktops with no other pre-assignment, they will all open on the desktop that just happens to be frontmost when they launch. This can feel more random at boot time, when the screen is rapidly changing Spaces to place each already-assigned app on its correct Space.\nYou can fix any app to any Space by right clicking its icon in the Dock, then Options > \n\n\n\n*\n\n*All Desktops - the app will follow you wherever you go  \n\n*This Desktop - will change to show the Space number once assigned, then will always open in that Space.  \n\n*None - will open in whatever Space you're in at the time.\n\n\nIf you have Mission Control set to 'Displays have separate Spaces' & 2 monitors, you will need a minimum of 3 Spaces before these options will become available to you.\n", "Q: It's possible to use a Mac invited account with firmware password enabled? I have the firmware protection enabled on my Mac, but whit this property I can't use the guest account of the computer without ingress the firmware password. I'd like to avoid this password request for guests (and obviously, for the primary boot) and maintain the firmware password for boot on others partitions, such as the recuperation mode.\n\nA: Firmware password prevents the startup of any disk other than the designated startup disk, so it should not prevent startup of guest or other accounts.As long as the account is using your startup disk, it should not ask for the firmware password.\nHowever, if you have file vault enabled, guest accounts can only access Safari, and the network connection. File vault encrypts the hard drive (SSD), preventing the guest from accessing it. If file vault is off, guest accounts function like a normal account with limited permissions.\n", "Q: Tell macOS to only use swap and compressed memory when really needed (macOS 10.14 Mojave) As disabling swap and/or compressing memory is not recommended and also not a stable option after 10.9 Mavericks (despite the vm setting exists), I'm doomed after few days of running my Mac with my memory writing to the far-from-optimal pages of memory. As everything gets to swap or compressed memory so easily, I need to reboot my system relatively often (despite my 16GB RAM).\nI'm searching for a solution which saves me from these slowdowns.\nFor example in Linux zramswap is optional. Also Linux has its swappiness value between 0 and 100 variable like\nvm.swappiness=5\n\nAlso I may consider a solution about file cache (which usually randomly eats up tons of memory for no valid reason and fails to drop it before RAM turns to the less optimal purgatories of compressed memory and swap). For example here ZFS has an option on FreeBSD to maximize the size of file cache in memory:\nvfs.zfs.arc_max=\"1536M\"\n\nIn macOS the best known workaround for the file cache issue is running\n# /usr/sbin/purge\n\nWhich is even \"cronnable\". So this flushes file cache, but unlikely to be optimal. It flushes too many things. Also if something is already in swap and/or compressed memory, despite the purge it stays there, so those softwares using them stay slow (and I feel that slowness, trust me).\nIs there any solution to make macOS less likely to use file cache, compressed memory or swap (but still keep the first for performance and the latter two for emergency)?\n\nA: I have the same issue and completely sympathise. Unnecessary swapping in the face of other options (e.g. shrinking the cached files area) has been a problem for years. It's made even worse under Mojave, where free memory - not even disk cache, but completely free - is present, but the system decides to use swap anyway. On an SSD, every write causes wear & tear to the hardware, so this is actually (albeit in a small way) physically damaging behaviour. Since the SSDs in modern Macs are soldered onto the main board, the situation is dire.\nI've been told many times by very confident posters on sites such as this that free memory is a bad idea, because it's sitting there consuming power and being of no other use. Disc cache (at least) should consume it. I agree with this; Mojave does not, compressing data and swapping it to disc even when gigabytes of free memory are present. On my home laptop, sleep cycles make it even worse. Right now, after a wake-up the machine has 11GB free, 5GB in use and 6GB swapped. The gibberish \"memory pressure\" colour is green, whatever that means. It's utterly absurd and indefensibly broken.\nI used to think there must be something I was installing or doing wrong, but on brand new Macs at work with nothing extra installed, consuming RAM via opening lots of tabs in Safari will soon enough show use of swap space despite lots of free RAM.\nAnd yes, it lags - badly at times. This definitely has a performance impact.\nI know of no solution. Apple Engineering claim it 'works as designed'.\n\nA: First and best line of defence would be to kill processes or services not needed.\nThen you might control the vm compression:\n$ sysctl -a vm.compressor_mode\nvm.compressor_mode: 4 \n\nSet these variables via an nvram command:\n\nMode 0x1, VM_PAGER_DEFAULT, turns off memory compressor and swapping, which is proved to be harmful to the system stability. Modes 0x8, 0x10 and 0x20 are the so-called “freezer” modes, which “freeze” the OS instantly when memory is under pressure. You don’t want to try them.\nMode 0x2, VM_PAGER_COMPRESSOR_NO_SWAP, is the best choice here. It provides memory compressor with swapping disabled. In other words, when memory is under pressure, macOS will try to compress the active but non-wired memory, thus freeing part of the memory back to the system. macOS uses WKdm algorithm to compress and decompress the memory, which is fast and battery-efficient. Yet, kernel panic is still possible if there is no more compressible memory.\n  To change from mode 0x4 to 0x2, use this command and reboot:\n$ sudo nvram boot-args=\"vm_compressor=2\"\nWhen using mode 0x2, memory pressure must be monitored closely to avoid kernel panic. Once the compressed memory grows close to 50% of total memory capacity, you would either like to close some of the running applications, or simply reboot the system.\nAvoid memory being compressed\n  Although memory compression is fast and is designed to relieve memory pressure, the best performance can only be achieved when none of the memory is being compressed. Use Activity Monitor or the following command to keep an eye on memory usage:\n$ top -o CMPRS\nFrom my experience, macOS starts to compress memory when the memory utilization is close to 80%. Try limiting the number of running apps to a low number, and restart or kill apps that consume excessive memory. Then your Mac should run as fast as it should. Use Activity Monitor or the following command to see which apps are using most of the memory:\n$ top -o MEM\nvia medium\n\nThere are more settings to play with and accessible in similar ways but they all seem not really worth it\n\nA: I say this with kindness, but no, no, no.\nDon’t change the fundamental design and process of virtual memory management of macOS because you have a system or workload that leaks so badly that you have accumulating swap piling up and the algorithm breaks down. Any change you make to the algorithm will still break if you have software that’s not allocating memory correctly, so this problem probably needs to return to isolate and identify what is causing the memory pressure so that compression and swap become a symptom of the underlying issue.\nNow - you might have a super good reason why you’re asking to alter the virtual memory, but macOS micro kernel isn’t designed for the level of tweaking that Linux is and if you truly need to manage VM that tightly, I would encourage you to either locate that code on a separate server via putting it in the cloud, on a second local device or even virtualizing Linux guest OS on top of macOS.\nThen you’ll have the best memory turning for the actual OS and the virtual software (VMWare Fusion is my general first recommendation, but check out Parallels or even some free options if you have time and inclination) so you can put the code that needs an iron fist governing virtual memory on Linux and let the mac apps be mac apps.\nAnd just to go out on a limb, in the seventeen years since OS X shipped, I’ve worked with dozens of people that went down the path you propose - find a case where virtual memory signals a problem and then change VM to overcome those software needs, in every case, we ended up fixing the applications or fixing where we run things instead of finding a magic setting or mortification that didn’t cause more harm than good.\nI do encourage everyone to try these things - especially if you have desire to know the internals of an operating system, but the premise here that VM needs to change doesn’t seem to ring true based on the details provided or the long experience of attempting this in the past. Please let us know if you find a setting that works for you and don’t down vote other people if they suggest things - this is how we all learn by hashing out engineering and software challenges - even against odds of it not working in the end.\n", "Q: Batch Renaming Folders Is there a way to batch replace current folder names with increasing numbers?

For example I have a list of numbers in a column. I would like to have another column that takes whatever is in that list and reverses the order the list appears. Is there a way of doing this with a function in Apple Numbers?\n\nA: One way to do this is to use the INDIRECT function. If you give that the string \"A1\", it'll give you the value currently in the cell A1.\nLet's say the list of numbers is in column A, and we want the reversed list in column B. Let's say there are 10 rows.\nSo: we need to make these formulae:\nB1 = INDIRECT(\"A10\")\nB2 = INDIRECT(\"A9\")\nB3 = INDIRECT(\"A8\")\n...\nB10 = INDIRECT(\"A1\")\n\nOk. The first character of the string we are giving to INDIRECT here is always \"A\", so we can just hard code that.\nNow we need the reversed row number. See the formulae above: if there are 10 rows, the reverse of row 1 is 10. The reverse of 2 is 9, and so on. So: the reverse of row R is total number of rows - R + 1.\nThe function ROWS(column name) will give us the total number of rows currently in column name. The function ROW() will give us the row number R (if we used ROW() in a formula in cell B5, it would return the number 5).\nSo... putting the formula INDIRECT(\"A\" & ROWS(A) - ROW() + 1) into each cell in column B works for me, using Numbers 3.6.1 on a Mac.\n\n", "Q: Graphical bug viewing PDF in Safari So, I'm looking at a PDF in Safari 12.0 off JSTOR.

SSDs work a little different than the usual HDDs. A program that overwrites the memory multiple times does more harm than good on SSDs. You kinda have to trust apple that their ERASE function actually securely removes any information. There are also certain SSD erasing tools, but it comes to trusting them once again. If you don't want to trust them I suggest you to encrypt your SSD and then erase it. You can use FileVault (or third party encryption software) and after setting it up simply use erase. This method is very safe and as long as you don't try to hide secrets from the government you should be fine thehe.\nIn SSDs you first have to erase the target area before you can write to it compared to HDDs. The Flash memory is divided into blocks, those are again devided into pages. You can directly write into an empty page. However if you want to delete, it can only be a whole block. SSDs tend to wear out after extensive use, so it's generally a bad idea to write unnecessary ammount of times. When writing a sentence the SSD's controller will read the page, then write a new page (with the sentence mentioned earlier) to another location. Old page will be marked as empty. The old page number will be assigned to the new page. If you overwrite the SSD multiple times, the reserve space is not gonna be touched, hence leftover information could be investigated by an attacker.

My iTunes on my Wintel laptop has all my songs on it, but when I click on a song, iTunes can't find it.  So, I'm wondering if I can take my iPod, copy it to OneDrive and then direct iTunes to that location for playing.  Has anyone done such a thing?\n\nA: There is really no reason why this would not work. Directing the iTunes music library to another location.\nOn macOS in iTunes Preferences under advanced there is a button to select the iTunes library (music and related files) location, which can be, pretty much, anywhere. I believe that it works the same way in Windows.\nYou'll want to copy the iTunes folder that held your music to your OneDrive folder and place the music from the iPod in the appropriate folder within. Depending on how careful you are and/or how lost iTunes is you may have to find a number of the missing songs manually. But iTunes should recognize at least some of the missing music and ask you if you want to re-add it to the library automatically.\n", "Q: Should I use all my storage on bootcamp?

It's possible that an older powered hub wouldn't work. Fortunately, current models are quite cheap.\nThis is arguably a duplicate of this question, where the problem is the same. But it's an old question, a bit of a mess, and the best solution offered (use a special cable to feed extra power) is not practical for most people. \n", "Q: 12\" MacBook battery is dead after 386 cycles I have an early 2015 12\" MacBook 512 GB SSD with 8 GB RAM.\nI have used my it nearly daily since I bought it brand new. I have never exposed it to high temperature, always working in AC room with a temperature around 24 degrees Celsius. Never worked in bed, but always on the table. I always care of my computer in the best possible way.\nThe Battery has major issues, the battery is sometimes charging till 100%, sometimes it drops to 20% and charging only till this number. Sometimes I can run my MacBook without charger plugged and sometimes it won't even start if it's not plugged.\nThe battery side is probably a little bit inflated so the case doesn't fit together as on another side. Looks like the battery somehow got bigger.\nAny ideas why is this happening? And if Apple will care it like some hardware issues from their side so they will change it? The battery is only 386 of 1000 cycles they told me so it is absolutely outrageous on the machine for $2000 at that time.\n\nA: An inflated/bulging battery is a safety risk and you should get it repaired ASAP. The reason for this could be anything from manufacturing defects to improper care.\nIf you got AppleCare when you bought your Mac, you may still be able to replace the battery for free. Otherwise, Apple won't change the battery for free, as warranties only last one year.(see here)\nIf you schedule a repair without AppleCare or warranty, it can cost anywhere from $129-199, depending on your Mac's model. You can schedule a repair here.\nOr, if you are willing to take the risk, you can replace the battery on your own using an iFixit guide.\n\nA: Bulging batteries mean only one thing- buildup of gas inside. The gases are produced due to electrochemical oxidation of the electrolyte.\nThere's also no single cause for a swollen battery. Some are due to manufacturing defects, others are caused by the age of the battery, and still other cases can be caused by misuse, such as not properly exercising the battery over time, or by using the wrong power charger.\nIf Apple will care, I do not know, they must not when it is outside the warranty but it depends, in your case it is clearly a manufacturing defect and a Safety risk that should not have happened.\nDo not wait to have it fixed.\n", "Q: HDMI Audio doesn't work on AMD RX580 Mac Pro 5,1 I have a Mac Pro 5,1 2012 and just installed an AMD RX580 GPU.

How can I add it to my iPhone as an alert tone?\n\nA: Step by step\n\n*\n\n*New project\n\nTo save a song as a ringtone, you must first import it into Garageband. First you create a new project, the easiest way to do this is with the \"Audio Recorder\". But you don't have to sing yourself, don't worry. First press the brick symbol in the upper left corner of the screen to select the track view. In the current garage band version, this is no longer so intuitive with a piano or guitar project. Because in these cases you would first have to create a track using a short recording that you will later delete in order to access the track browser. The icon of the track browser can be found in the top left.\n\n\n*Sample browser\n\nTo be able to select a song, tap on the loop browser - symbol at the top right, the loop.\n\n\n*Music on iPhone\n\nThen the file overview opens, we select \"Music\" on the far right. This shows our albums stored in the iPhone's music app.\n\n\n*New track\n\nOnce we have selected a song, we drag it to a new track. To do this, hold down a song with your finger and then drag the file upwards. Attention: Protected songs and songs that are only in iCloud and not on the device cannot be used. This is especially true for songs from Apple Music, Garageband refuses to import them here.\n\n\n*Crop\n\nWe let the song \"fall\" into a new track. Then we can cut the song to the spot that we want to use as a ringtone. A maximum of 40 seconds is allowed as a ringtone.\n\n\n*Select the ringtone\n\nFinally, we close the project, select it in the project view and call the context menu by pressing the file a little longer. Here we select the item \"Share\" and select \"Ringtone\" there. The file is now automatically added to the iOS tones.\nImporting music from the music app in particular is a bit cumbersome, as the picture gallery shows. However, if you are one of the many users who do not synchronize their iPhone with their Mac or PC, but use it completely independently from a computer, this is the way to go. Because the Garageband app for iOS can export projects directly as ringtone, these appear automatically in the \"Tones\" selection in the system settings.\n\nA: To make a custom ringtone or text-tone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open clip/song/sound using iTunes. Use the Song Info options panel to trim the start and stop time if you would like. \n\n*Select the song in iTunes and go to File -> Convert -> Create AAC Version\n\n*Right click on the new version and select Show in Finder\n\n*Change the extension from .m4a to .m4r\n\n*Delete the song from your library. Make sure to not let iTunes move the original version to the trash.\n\n*Double click on the .m4r version of the song. It will appear in your ringtone section.\n\n*Change your song's start and stop times if you need to reset them to normal.\n\n\nSince you already have an .m4a, you should be able to make a new copy and change the extension to .m4r and open it in iTunes.\nedit It's important to note that to find the Tones section your phone should be connected to iTunes, then go to the overview of your phone, and select the Tones section from the left panel. The Tones section will generally not show up in your normal library.\n\nA: I agree, converting is necessary to complete this. I also recommend using mp3 to aac to create aac extension.\n", "Q: In macOS Photos app, can you export all pictures of a person?

It makes no difference, whether I replace the existing file or create a new one.\nOnce I also had the case where first milliseconds weren't cut, but the next few ones where?!\nI just need to remove a very short portion at the beginning of the clip, maybe that's too short? I really don't know. Maybe it has something to do with file versions and different applications using differenct versions of the file? I should add the files are all stored on an external HDD in a NAS.\n\nA: Expanding from comments I left earlier this morning. While I don't know Apple's exact process, here is what I surmise is going on:\nApple does not want to have to re-encode (recompress) your video. Doing so would take a considerable amount of time, use a considerable amount of CPU, and decrease the overall video quality of your file.\nSo how can you cut out part of a video without re-encoding it? If videos were a series of discrete frames, this would be easy—just delete the frames you don't want, and don't touch the frames you do want.\nHowever, modern video codecs are more complex than this. Individual frames are not discrete—they use information from previous frames in order to save space. To put it another way, in most cases, only the difference between each frame is stored.\nThis isn't a problem if you need to cut off the end of a video, and in fact, you'll notice that in this scenario, macOS will do as you expect—create a shorter video that ends at the exact time you specified, in all video players. But what happens if you cut off the beginning? The start frame you selected can't stand on its own; it requires the information from previous frames in order to work. You'll be left with a garbled mess, if anything displays at all.\nSo instead, Apple cheats. They cut out as much of the video as they can, leave however many frames are necessary for the first frame you selected to display correctly, and then tell Apple players (eg QuickTime, iMovie) to jump ahead to your desired starting frame. While this appears to work correctly in Apple programs, VLC will skip only the parts that are truly gone.\n", "Q: MacBook doesn't remember Screen Orientation I've got at work two external displays + a MBP 13\" 2017. (OS: Mojave 10.14.1 Beta)\nThe monitors are both BenQ (GL2450), connected via HDMI to a Thunderbolt 3 port. (one through hub, one through plain adapter)\nNow I have rotated the left screen by 90 degrees and set up the Internal Display on the right, it all works fine. Until I come back to work after disconnecting everything for > 1h. Then all my screens rotation are messed up, the normally pivoted display is back to default, and the default display is now rotated by 90 degrees, though I did NOT switch Ports on the MBP or Adapters. \nOnly way to fix this is to manoeuvre the mouse through messed up displays and go to the system settings and change everything back to normal.\nProblem there is, if I rotate the most left monitor (default -> 90), it asks for confirmation, and most of the times I can't reach it fast enough through the messed up displays. Interestingly enough, if I rotate the middle monitor first (90 -> default), it doesn't ask for permission.\nIt's annoying to do this every morning I arrive to work, though I started to see it as kind of a challenge. No the OS is not the problem ... I'm in this situation way longer than Mojave was announced.\nEDIT:\ntried to narrow down the problem by plugging in cables at different times, rebooting, other monitors etc. nothing of that worked. I'm out of ideas.\n\nA: There are (at least) two different problems here. I'm \"lucky\" enough to have experienced both :-(\nIf you use two identical models, be aware that macOS doesn't care about their serial numbers. So when you connect both at the same time (e.g.: through a dock) then they are racing against each other. Some people are lucky because the same monitor always loses the race (longer cable? slower microcontroller?). Others are less lucky and see more random results. See complete details including log files, reproduction steps and workarounds at https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/377836/236162\nI've been using a single external monitor for a long time now and obviously stopped experiencing the previous issue. Everything was fine until 10.15.7, then macOS stopped remembering my 90° orientation, now reverts to \"standard\" every single time I reconnect it. Never happened with 10.15.6. @Charanjeet_Singh 's answer gave me a lot of hope because I immediately found a ColorSync profile mess: 5 files for that same monitor, all with almost the same info except for some extra vcgp field, just different GUIDs. I deleted them all except for the Factory one however this made no difference. BTW macOS keeps recreating a DELL U2713HM-FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF.icc copy of the factory profile.\n10.15.7 seems to have broken rotation in more than one way: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252025348\nUPDATE: I now use an AppleScript as workaround, see below.\nUPDATE2: on the 19th of January 2020 the rotation bug has magically disappeared. There's been no software update I've been aware of. EDIT: because I... rebooted.\nUPDATE3: following a security update (without any version number bump!), the issue came back on the 3rd of February 2020 EDIT: the problem happens like clockwork every time there is an OS update.

So the solution is:\n\n*\n\n*The external monitor should be connected.\n\n*From App drawer open ColorSync Utility.\n\n*In Devices column, select display and Under Displays select your external monitor.\n\n*Check if \"Factory profile\" path and \"Current profile\" path both are same.\n\n*If not select drop down arrow next to \"Current Profile\" and select \"Other\".\n\n*Select the same file name which is mentioned under Factory path.\n\nNow your monitor will remember the screen orientation.

I recently purchased an 85W off Amazon that's similar to yours. It came in all the Apple packaging trappings and I think it's genuine because my guess is Apple changed the location of the serial number to that harder-to-print location specifically to make the game harder for fakers. (Why would a faker bother to move the serial number into such an awkward location? It's quite possible that printing in that confined space requires special equipment, which would force fakers to either forego the serial number, use a sticker, or use two pieces of plastic instead of one solid piece.)\n", "Q: Can't send outgoing messages using Gmail via the Mail app Using Sierra OS.

This works fine in OS Sierra (with a Mojave Time Machine disk); but I just found out that OS Mojave can not be 'tricked' and gives the error message again ('improved' safety settings'???).\n• As soon as cloning has been completed (after a couple of hours or even days) you can add the new disk name in the same Time Machine Preferences pane (or add both disks, if you want to generate a simultaneous backup).\n\n\n*Though, probably the easiest way for migrating a Time Machine disk is simply to clone it from another Mac computer. 'Foreign' Time Machine disks from other Macs appear to be treated automatically as standard HDs (also in Mojave? Or may this only have worked-out for me because of different OS-versions on both computers??? I just completed another clone successfully)!  \n\n*Addition: Last night, SuperDuper! did an excellent job under Mojave to clone a Time Machine Disk (though file by file, and not byte-by-byte as Disk Utility does).\nSuccess!\n\nA: It should work if you boot into recovery mode. Hold cmd+r when booting, then use Disk Utility to recover. If your drive is encrypted, you will have to mount it and unlock it first.\n\nA: I have had the same problems as others here. (In my case when I try to copy a 17 TB backup on a RAID disk to a 48 TB disk, it fails when the destination disk fills up.) I have only tried this under Mojave. I just got off the phone from Apple Support and they said that there isn't a solution right now. If this recipe doesn't work, then they don't have a solution. \n\nA: I have been eagerly watching this thread, since I am having trouble using Apple's instructions for moving the TM backup to a different external HD, too.\nMy 2TB TM backup won't fit on an 8TB external HD!\nEven after two sessions with an Apple Sr. Advisor.\nIt appears that SuperDuper! might be a way to go. Did the \"file by file\" way take longer than \"byte by byte\"?\n", "Q: How to allow mouse pointer to move to smaller display? I have two monitors connected to my Mac (running Mojave). \n\n\n*\n\n*A sits \"left\" and has resolution 1680x1050\n\n*B sits \"right\" and has resolution 2560x1440\n\n\nSo, when I put my mouse in the \"top\" of B, and move it left ... it just slides \"nicely\" onto A. But: when I put the mouse on the bottom of B and move it left ... the mouse pointer will be stuck at the left border of B.\nOf course: B's height is 1440, and A's height is 1050 ... so when the mouse pointer is at y=1300, well A only doesn't have that.\nBut for me, it would be perfectly fine if the mouse just showed up on the bottom of A. \nMy current workaround is to remember to first move the mouse up when I get stuck. \nIs there a (built-in) setting that allows me to change this behavior?\n\nA: Don't think possible for the reasons Tetsujin noted above. In past my workaround for different sized monitors was to position them corner to corner - e.g. top left or top right. It was easier to remember (for me) that the mouse would only slide to the other screen if I put the pointer in the corner of the current screen. Also meant windows I slid to the edge of current monitor would not accidentally slide partway onto the other screen.\n", "Q: Does any Mac app actually block Safari ads? Up until yesterday, I used AdBlock Plus to get rid of ads on Safari, in particular these annoying Gmail ones:\n\nBut yesterday, I installed MacOS Mojave and I guess it upgraded my Safari so that traditional extensions don't work. However, when I go to the Mac App Store, there don't seem to be any adblocking apps that users claim actually work. Do I just have to get used to seeing junk at the top of my inbox again?\n\nA: I recently installed the Brave browser on my Macs - it is way faster than Safari and blocks most adds.\nBrave\n\nA: Yes, you can block ads on Safari using Adblock for Safari; it's available on the App Store and compatible with macOS 10.12 or later, 64-bit processor.\n\nA: I believe you can go to (in Safari) preferences, extensions, and re-enable ABP after the update. Let me know if this works for you.\n\nA: 1Blocker works well for me and is very configurable.\n", "Q: getElementById not working with AppleScript I'm trying to automate a click on a radio button by id.

But I would like to create clickable text \"hyperlinks\" to use in things like Excel spreadsheets, TextEdit, to do lists, etc. \nClicking one of those links would open the corresponding file/folder in Finder.

I also went on reinstall macos but does not show my Mac HD in there ... Any solutions ? \n\nA: You really need to put this Mac in target disk mode and connect it to another Mac - or you can accomplish the same things buy installing a fresh copy of Mac OS on a USB external drive and booting that.\nOnce you're running normal Mac OS on another drive, you can run SMART Utility to see if your drive is having a hardware failure. If it is, time to replace it. If it's not, you should run a good drive repair utility like DiskWarrior. Unfortunately, while Apple's Disk Utility technically performs these functions, it's fairly useless at both. \n", "Q: Messages and soagent making CPU spike - any solutions?

Or replicate data on the backup drive? When I use Time Machine to backup my MBP hard drive: Does it create a disk image? Or replication data on the backup drive?\nAm asking because I wonder whether erasing the hard drive, reinstalling OS, and then restoring from a Time Machine backup ...  would help free up space (occupied by dropped databases) or get rid of conflicting bits left by package managers like NVM, NPM etc. \n\nA: Time Machine does not create a disk image, and it instead copies over files to a folder on the target destination. It copies over almost all the files, except for a few system files and trash files. When backing up to remote drives like a Time Capsule, it uses Sparse bundles.\nErasing the hard drive and restoring the backup might free up some storage, but it'll be very, very little and probably not worth the effort.\nSource\n", "Q: Is it possible to create files directly in Folders? I have just bought a MacBook and recently switched from Windows OS. Let's take the example of Microsoft Word documents. In Windows OS, I have a habit of making my MS Word files in the destination directory itself, so all I have to do is save my work later. \nHowever with my limited knowledge of MacOS, I realise there seems to be no way to achieve this, I always make a new MS Word file and only at the saving stage then I require to go through the whole motion of entering my nested folders. If I have to work on multiple files that would be stored in the same destination folder, this process will become quite irritating if the destination is quite deep into other folders. \nIs there a way to overcome this dilemma in MacOS in general for any application?\n\nA: AFAIK, you can't do it directly through the macOS GUI like in Windows, w/o any customizations. \nYou can use the Terminal* app (Cmd+Space to open Spotlight, then type terminal), by typing cd, then drag and drop the folder to it to get the whole file path; finally type touch my newfile.docx.\ne.g.\ncd /path/to/file\ntouch newfile.docx\n\n\nmany other alternative solutions here\n* coming from the Windows world, terminal it's like the cmd.exe (Command Prompt)\n\nA: Since macOS does not have this type of context menu to simply add a New File of a certain type which is pre-filled with the required information, the closest you can do is an approach similar to what GNOME under Linux has:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Templates folder (it does not need to be called “Templates” though) which is easily accessible to you (maybe add it to the side panel of Finder afterwards)\n\n*then open Word and without starting to type or change anything, save that empty file to your templates folder as a regular document (e.g. as “.docx”, not “.dotx” as this would be Word’s own way of storing templates and is not what you wanted)\n\n\nNow, whenever you need to place multiple files of the same type, visit your templates folder, copy that file, navigate where you like to place them and paste them in the number of times you need them. Then rename the new files to the names of choice.\nOther applications behaving in a similar manner (meaning being able to store files at custom locations) can be done in the same fashion.\nNo programming (adding services) or command line knowledge (using bash) is required with this solution.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 13 2017 suddenly shutdown then stuck at apple logo I have a Macbook Pro 13-inch, 2017 model, and an original OS.

After upgrading from High Sierra to Mojave I've noticed a bunch of new files with prefixes in /etc/:\n\n\n*\n\n*~previous, e.g. syslog.conf~previous\n\n*-previous, e.g. php.ini.default-previous\n\n*~orig, e.g.sudoers~orig\nWhat are these? Is it safe to delete them (e.g. in case they are identical to the original files)?\n\nA: The ~orig and similarly suffixed files are previous and likely corrupted versions of the settings/plist file where the \"current\" one is pretty much a duplicate of the \"bad\"one, not helping most situations (like when your ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist is corrupted). \nIn my experience though it usually ends up that the current file still has part or most of the corruption the previous one had. Depending on the location, it should be safe to delete the ~orig and similarly named files. \nThe current ones in /Library/Preferences should be safe to delete, I've never had negative results from that. \nIn the previous iTunes example, the freshest plist still may cause wonkiness like slow start and quit of iTunes. I had this happen to me about ten years ago, took 5 minutes to open iTunes, 10 to quit when I had this issue. When I checked the plists I must have had 200+ bad copied (in this case they would be com.apple.iTunes.plist. ). Removed them all and reopened iTunes, it created a new plist without trying to inherit any issues from the previous ones and it was smooth sailing since. \nBut like I said earlier, the ones in non-user and non-/Library/Preferences I would leave alone or be careful with, especially in /etc and /private. \n", "Q: Is my keyboard compatible with MacBook Pro I have ordered a Hyperx alloy elite RGB, but I was wondering whether it would be compatible with my MacBook Pro [Mojave 10.14.] In some forums I read it might not be compatible.

The manufacturing month written on the box was Aug/2018. The phone came with pre-installed iOS 11.4.1 and on the same day I updated it to iOS 12.0.1. \nI am facing some major issues with touch and battery backup. I also do not know how the iPhone was performing in iOS 11.4.1, since as soon as I opened the box and set all things up, I updated it. \nThe issues are: \n1) Touch Screen Problem: The upper left corner (where the back arrow of most of the iOS apps is situated) fails to register the correct position of a touch. Tapping the arrow right on it does nothing. I need to tap little bit to the right of the arrow. This is also same for the upper right corner. In this case I tap a little bit to the left instead of touching the exact location of the target. This is extremely annoying. \nTap targets which are minute in size require several taps to activate. Surprisingly, this is not true for all the small-sized targets. Some small-sized target can very easily be activated without any false tapping. \nFor example, in the Weather app, the \"Add city\" option (plus sign inscribed within a circle) requires 10-15 taps to activate, and still, I am searching for the right spot for it. This is same for a small \"More\" target which appears on the right side when an app is being updated in App store. However, a very small cross arrow which comes on the right side while typing in the search bar of Safari is extremely fast in recognizing a touch. I do not know whether this is a software issue or a hardware one.\nThis is also happening for third party apps. In Messenger, if I tap the account info button (the very small circle on the top left corner, which contains the profile picture), nothing happens. But if I tap slightly to the right of it, the phone recognizes the tap. In the Twitter app, the account info button (placed exactly at the same location as in Messenger) easily recognizes the touch. (However, the size of the info button is slightly bigger in Twitter than that of in Messenger.)\nDeleting the first row apps in any of the home pages is also troublesome. Tapping the cross mark on the app icon does nothing. I need to tap little bit below the cross mark. This is true for any app which I place in the first row. Deleting apps in other rows is, however, normal.  \nThere are a number of examples can be provided regarding this calibration problem of touch.  \n2) Battery life: In short, really bad battery life. Today (24/10/2018) I got a \"Screen on time\" of 6 hr 20 min, during which the battery percentage went to 5% from 100%. The total time including the \"stand by time\" is 15 hr 40 min. At 08:00 hours battery percentage was 84% and at 16:40 hours it came to 5%. For this entire discharge cycle (100%-5%) I kept the phone in low power mode.\nIs everybody with an iPhone SE on iOS 12.0.1 facing the same problem with touch?\nIs battery draining more in ios 12.0.1 compared to ios 10.3.3?\n\nA: iOS 12 should bring better performance and battery life, not make it worse.\nSince you have just recently bought the device, you should tell whoever sold you the device that it has these defects and request to exchange/return the device for a new one. You should probably hurry before you run out of time to return it.\n", "Q: Show hidden files on macOS Sierra & newer To see my /etc folder I've tried this command in Terminal:\nsudo chflags nohidden /etc\n\nfollowed by:\nsudo defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles true; killall Finder\n\nalso tried:\nsudo defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall Finder\n\nNeither of them seemed to work.\n\nA: Session\nThis keystroke toggles between show & hide the hidden files: \n Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   .  (that’s a FULL STOP, period character)\nPress again to toggle back and forth.\nWhen you reboot your Mac, the hidden files will be hidden. Press the keystroke again to show.\nPersistent\nIn Terminal.app, paste:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean true; killall Finder \n\nThis changes the default setting to show hidden files. And this causes the Finder to restart, so you can see the effect. This new setting persists even after rebooting your Mac.\nTo revert to hiding again the hidden files, change that true to a false and run again in Terminal.\n\nA: I would go about this a little differently. This assumes you want hidden files to always be shown everywhere (in the Finder and also in application's open and save panels).\nFirst, I usually try to avoid killing apps and prefer to tell them to quit. While that is possible using AppleScript in Script Editor, this one-liner will help to solve this problem by adding a Quit menu item to the Finder:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem 1; killall Finder\n\nTo undo that you can use either:\ndefaults delete com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem\n\nor:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem 0\n\nThis will now allow you to quit the Finder like any other app.\nSecond, to show hidden files for all apps (including the Finder), you set the AppleShowAllFiles setting in the global domain.\ndefaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles 1\n\nTo have those settings take effect, quit and relaunch the application you were using (including the Finder).\nIf you'd like to undo that, run either of the following:\ndefaults delete -g AppleShowAllFiles\n\nor:\ndefaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles 0\n\n", "Q: Fn key not being recognized on macOS Mojave I have Logitech K330 unifying keyboard with Fn key on it.

Or is this just a bug that needs fixing?\n\nA: WORKAROUND:\nRead somewhere that to get (temporarily) the resizing bar, you drag one of the split windows by the title to the other side of the monitor. The bar will remain for a while. Resize, and if needed, switch back the windows. It has been working for me on an external LG monitor in Mojave.\n\nA: I found that if you simply click the title bar you'll be able to drag the windows after, for a few seconds. \nI believe that this is intentional to prevent changes to the screen split by mistake. \nSo it's possible that this is by design. \n\nA: I have the same issue… I’m working around it by resizing the windows in split view on the MacBook screen and only then dragging them to the external monitor, but this \"solution\" is obviously far from perfect :/ Hope they fix this soon.\n\nA: Workaround: When putting things into full screen, don't put anything full screen instead hold the green expand button on the top left, wait until a side turns blue, than select side, select your second app, now you have a bar in the middle you can drag left/right.\n\nA: \n\n\n*\n\n*split the window in your computer screen (desktop 1)\n\n*resize them as you want\n\n*Zoom out (using your 4 fingers on the pad) to see all the desktops (windows).\n\n*pick, drag your window from your computer and drop it to the external monitor\n\n\nA: This just happened to me....   \nI got out of it by doing a three finger swipe up the mousepad\nThis takes you to a view where you can see all spaces at once\nThen hover over the space with the expanded app - it will give you an option to minimize it. Click that.\n\n\nA: This is an annoying bug that I have reported to apple numerous times.\nThe best workaround I have found is to move your mouse to the top of the screen to bring down the title bar, and then click on the title bar. \nYou have to play around and try the title bar for each window. One of them will bring up the resizing indicator temporarily.\n\nA: Confirmed broken in Mojave 10.14.6.  Confirmed mostly-fixed in Catalina 10.15.3.   I say mostly-fixed, because the slider is only adjustable if the right side has focus.  If the left side has focus, then you still can't resize the slider.  But it's a very easy workaround, which was not possible until Catalina.\n\nA: In my experience, it only works when the right window is active. no idea why that is the case, but I always have to select the right one, ever since High Sierra or at least Catalina.\n", "Q: Meaning of \"FD\" in /dev/cu.usbmodemFD211? Normally when I plug a CDC serial USB device, I get a device like /dev/cu.usbmodem1411. A remote user I'm supporting who's having difficulty with a serial device is reporting a device with FD in the name: /dev/cu.usbmodemFD211 (on a Macbook Air of unknown vintage running 10.13.4)?\nWhat's the meaning of the FD? I've done a websearch but turned up nothing, though some people mention a lower-case fd instead. I know the digits just signify the controller, port, etc.\n\nA: There's no technical consequences due to the device having \"FD\" in its name. It is \"just a name\", so the operating system doesn't treat it any differently because it says \"FD\".\nThe reason for the different namings is that the driver for the USB serial device decides the name of the device file. You will see different names depending on which driver the user has installed.\nFor these reasons, it is not possible to generally say what the \"FD\" stands for - as it depends entirely on which driver, the user has installed. Typically \"FD\" stands for \"file descriptor\" or \"full duplex\" in this context. \n", "Q: 'Unable to verify account name or password.' when connecting Office 365 account on MacOS Mojave I am struggling with the same issue raised here - \"Unable to verify account name or password\" on outlook.com Exchange server (browser works).

What happens is, after quitting every app, the system is left idling at the empty desktop — no icons, no menu bar, just the wallpaper. The mouse pointer is movable, Dock and Spotlight are still operating, but Finder is «Not Responding» and unable to relaunch in any way. So all I'm left with is a hard Power button reset or sudo shutdown -h now (another workaround is to click Restart with admin rights on the login window, I presume it's the same as the terminal command).\nThis problem is accompanied (and may or may not be caused) by many others:\n\n\n*\n\n*Certain apps may refuse to quit against all measures as well, thereby hanging out in the Dock and halting the shutdown\n\n*Quick Preview (handy Spacebar thing) is showing nothing but empty white rectangles\n\n*Preview itself opening all files as empty windows or practicing other weird behaviours like not showing the pixel selection frame\n\n*Finder throwing up a self-conscious «The application “Finder.app” is not open anymore» in response to launching apps or opening windows through Spotlight (even though ⌘-Enter to show file location still works)\n\n*Folders appear to be empty until Finder is relaunched (manually or by itself)\n\n*Unable to launch some apps, notably Photos\n\n*Minor rare cases of graphics corruptions, like garbled windows in Mission Control\n\n\nAll of these get fixed by a Mac restart, but keep steadily accumulating again.

(My drive is partitioned into two, with Windows 7 installed through Boot Camp, if that has significance.) I know that Yosemite is quite old, but I'm honestly scared of upgrading lest it becomes worse (performance loss, new glitches, feel free to reassure me).\nSo, could anyone provide tips on what the root of this problem may be and how to fix it? Logs I should check, tests I can do, files to wipe or redact? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you, and safe travels!\n\nUpdate 1:\nI have tried booting into Safe Mode once again, acting out some generic work and having a look at the Activity Monitor. Here is what it looks like:\n\nInterestingly, the computer seems to shut down properly from Safe Mode. Once again though, some window animations are extremely slow to render here, producing beautiful scrolling lines.\nThen, I booted normally and did roughly the same manipulations. The Monitor from here:\n\nI also tried shutting down in normal mode immediately after landing on the desktop after a restart, which works. So one can assume there is a software gimmick that is causing this problem shortly after startup.\nUpdate 2:\nI created a new Standard (non-Admin) account as was suggested, and I think that helped to uncover the exact criminal in disguise — Finder. It seems like everything works nicely (while launching and switching apps), until the first Finder window is open (any folder), which somehow makes Finder unresponsive on shutdown, thereby freezing the latter. This happens on both user accounts. Interestingly, switching to another user and doing a «proper» shutdown (from Apple menu) before using Finder is working (although I guess the «blocked» user's session is still halted abruptly and incorrectly then).\nNow, the question is: what exactly is wrong with Finder, and how can I help the little guy?\nUpdate 3:\nAs suggested, I tried moving Finder cache and preference files to desktop through the Terminal while logged in as a different user, but this doesn't seem to affect the problem.\nI could find no crash logs for Finder apart from some short diagnostic reports, and noticed nothing unusual displayed by the Console while the faulty shutdown is in process, but here is an example of some fishy Finder-related events which may be happening during uptime:\n\n(I do not know how significant these are; the Console spits out things like that from various processes regularly).\n\nA: Here's what I would try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login as your 'other' user.\n\n*Launch Terminal.app\n\n*Type login shortname (where shortname is the username that is having problems with Finder) and enter your password when prompted.

In principal I'd rather not have .DS_Store altogether, but if the computer wants to have them, I don't mind.  \nHowever, is there a way to permanently stop them from being created in a particular dir and subdirs?  \nI'm aware you can configure no .DS_Store files across the board on network shares, but I need to be more selective than an all or none solution. Ideally I can suppress these both on local filesystems as well as remote, but if anyone can help with preventing some of these and allowing others, I would be grateful.\nThis question is to address Mojave and newer OS only and to address a more fine grained control or to confirm that this is impossible.\n\nA: There's no built-in functionality in macOS to stop the creation of .DS_Store files in a specific folder and its subfolders. There's a setting to stop the creation on networked volumes (i.e. folders that really are network shares).\nYou can download a third party utility called \"DeathToDSStore\" from here:\nhttps://github.com/snielsen/DeathToDSStore\nThis will stop the generation of .DS_Store files in general, but still not for a specific directory.\nYou mention that you are a developer - thus it might be possible for you to modify that utility to do exactly what you want. The utility is open source. You can find the specific place to override in the file source/FinderOverride.m.\nIn the comments you've mentioned needing to run on Mojave, which DeathToDSStore doesn't support yet.

I tried to turn it on twice, it kept shutting down after 2-3 seconds after the system boot. After plugging in power it works without any problems.\nI doubt if I can reproduce the problem, it means I should work from the battery in the moment of shutdown (and lose work results)\nDoes anyone met the problem? How to detect the reason, is it hardware or software, or just system settings (I believe, it should be warning and regular shut down, never drained the battery before)?\n\nA: Judging from the symptoms I highly suspect it's an issue with the battery. I recently had my late 2013 Macbook Retina serviced because it experienced exactly the same issue: Immediate shutdown when the battery was drained to 60%. It would instantly turn back on if connected to power. My battery was 5 years old and had about 240 cycles. The apple engineer told me that the battery needs to be replaced because it was so old and coulndn't hold a charge.\nWhat does the System Information (Click on Apple Logo while holding down option to access it) report about your battery?\n\nCan you check what coconut battery reports about the remaining actual charge? It would be really interesting to see what the actual fully charged capacity of your battery is and the designed capacity. If it's less than 80% of the designed capacity when the battery is fully charged then I would recommend replacing the battery regardless of its cycle count. \n\n\nA: Only 70 cycles in 4 Years.\nI bet you leave your system plugged in most of the time.\nWhat is happening here is SMC thinks the power level is below the set threshold so it needs to power down the system into deep sleep mode. So how to fix? \nIt's quite simple you need to do a SMC reset and cycle the battery a few times by fully discharging it and recharging it. That way the setpoint is memorized correctly.\nSome examples .. this is old battery ... needs replacement. Notice the Fully Charged Capacity has dropped from new at ~8000 to old at ~2600.\n\n\nA: I tried to calibrate the battery in my MacBook along with the help of battery status apps like Coconut Battery Mac app. The tip is reset SMC and to charge your MacBook fully to 100% and leave it for a few hours at that state.  If you don't then the battery won't calibrate correctly. This guide mentions this. Also you have to do this a few times for the battery to calibrate properly.\n", "Q: App has photo access, but I never allowed it to access photos I have a to do list app installed that allows you to add a profile photo.

This works for me with both sh and ./ styles of running.\n\nA: A simple fix if you just want to be able to write \"sh\" and have it run the new bash is to create a link like this:\nln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/sh\n\nThis won't help you if you have for example scripts that start with #!/bin/sh or similar.\nIn order to change that sh, you'll need to either copy over the /usr/local/bin/bash file to overwrite /bin/sh, like this:\n  cp /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/sh\n\nor create a link between the two:\n  ln -sf /usr/local/bin/Bash /bin/sh\n\nPlease take a backup copy of the sh binary before doing so.\nHowever, I would advice to leave \"sh\" alone as it is the system shell used during bootup, shutdown, and by the system in general. Even though the newer bash version is largely compatible, it would be tiresome if booting fails now or after an OS upgrade because you have substituted the shell.\n\nA: By running man sh in a terminal on macOS, we can learn the sh command determines the shell first by evaluating a symbolic link:\nDESCRIPTION\n     sh is a POSIX-compliant command interpreter (shell).  It is implemented by re-execing as either bash(1), dash(1), or zsh(1) as determined by the sym-\n     bolic link located at /private/var/select/sh.  If /private/var/select/sh does not exist or does not point to a valid shell, sh will use one of the\n     supported shells.\n\nVerifying this as follows:\n$ l /private/var/select\n\ndrwxr-xr-x - root 13 Oct  2019  .\ndrwxr-xr-x - root 26 May 21:25  ..\nlrwxr-xr-x 9 root 13 Oct  2019  sh -> /bin/bash\n\nIf you wish to alter the default shell, you can update this symbolic link accordingly.\nIn addition, I would verify that whichever shell you use is sanctioned in your /etc/shells file:\n$ cat /etc/shells\n\n# List of acceptable shells for chpass(1).\n# Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using\n# one of these shells.\n\n/bin/bash\n/bin/csh\n/bin/ksh\n/bin/sh\n/bin/tcsh\n/bin/zsh\n/usr/local/bin/zsh\n\nVerifying man page\nTo verify what the man page indicates is true, we can do a simple test.\nIn one session start watching file system activity for any access to the /private/var/select/sh link:\n$ sudo fs_usage sh | grep -E '/private/var/select/sh'\n\nIn a second terminal run the following:\n$ /bin/sh -c ls\n\nAnd note the output similar to the following in the fs_usage session:\n10:55:26  readlink          /private/var/select/sh                                                           0.000030   sh\n\n", "Q: How to create a bootable disk for an older Mac?

In the US, we have the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act which allows you to open/service your product without fear of invalidating the warranty.  Specific to your situation,\nThey cannot \"tie in\" genuine Apple Parts (i.e. hard drives or memory) to keep the warranty in tact:\n\n(c) Prohibition on conditions for written or implied warranty; waiver by Commission; No warrantor of a consumer product may condition his\nwritten or implied warranty of such product on the consumer’s using,\nin connection with such product, any article or service (other than\narticle or service provided without charge under the terms of the\nwarranty) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name;\n\nHowever, you need to check your local laws governing repairs to see if you're covered.  Generally speaking however, it's very difficult to impossible to tell if you've opened an iMac (there's no tamper seal).  So technically, they wouldn't know.\n\n\nIs it possible to do it myself or I need a professional technician?\n\nIt depends on your technical skill.  You have to remove the LCD which means literally cutting the adhesive that bonds the LCD to the frame of the iMac.  If this is not something you're comfortable doing, take it in for service.\n\nCould you evaluate the cost of internal upgrade compared to external solution with SSD drive (without RAM)?\n\nIt's a moot point.  Plugging in an external SSD is easier and will be cheaper if you need to hire a tech to install the drive internally, but the internal drive will always be faster are more reliable.  Bottom line is the external drive doesn't require special skills to install, so you won't have to pay for it.\n", "Q: Home/End keys to simulate Windows behavior in different contexts Going to Mac from Windows is mostly a nice experience for me, but one thing I struggle with massively is keyboard shortcuts. I am a programmer and I use them a lot. I have mapped most of them to my liking using Karabiner, but I can't seem to figure out how to simulate Home/End behavior.\nThe basic behavior, going to the beginning/end of a line is easy, I just mapped Home/End to Command+Left/Right.\nHowever, the issue is with non-text fields. For example, if I am on a webpage and I don't have a text field focused (just clicked anywhere on the page), I would expect the Home/End keys to scroll all the way to the top/bottom of the page. The problem is that pressing those keys effectively means pressing Cmd+Left/Right and that (in the context of a browser) means \"go to the previous/next page\". So I need to press Cmd+Up/Down to go up and down the page. \nBut I want to basically have Home behave as \"go to the start/top of the current element, whatever that means - if text field, to the beginning. If long page, dialog, something - to the top\". Just like on Windows. How do I achieve that?\n\nA: If you use Google Chrome, you can add an Extension called Shortkeys (Custom Keyboard Shortcuts) and set all the custom shortcuts you want. \nPS: Just FYI you can press Space to go down one screen at a time and Shift+Space to go up from default.\n\n\n", "Q: Visual bug in Dock after macOS Mojave installation After installing the macOS Mojave update, I get a strange visual bug in the Dock from time to time.

For some reason the keyboard strokes are not correctly registered by the OS. On the login screen typing either triggers the “can’t type here” sound or wrong letters / erratic movement occur. For example pressing the louder button usually first turns the sound down twice and then mutes the Mac. Also a trackpad click only triggers the secondary click. A normal click or tap is not possible. The same stays true after login.\nThis is already weird but I also checked the virtual keyboard and there the right buttons are highlighted on stroke meaning that at least there I see full function. Also the Option + keys correctly types each special symbol. Also weird is that on the virtual key the acute is always lid in orange. Sometimes the keyboard completely works for some time just to revert to the no-function a little later. What i also noticed is that I can trigger the failure the following way: \nif the keyboard works the acute on the virtual keyboard is always lid. If I press the left shift key, the acute is not lid anymore and the keyboard strokes are not recognised by the system anymore. However, the virtual keyboard is still recognising everything just fine.\nThe error is also present when booting from an USB stick. P+R+Option+Alt does not work and neither does triggering the recovery mode.\nWhat did I try to fix it:\nWarranty has run out, therefore I thougt: go for it!\nI already exchanged the cable that connects the trackpad to the logic board, I reinstalled the OS, exchanged the trackpad itself and cleared the nvram. I do not know where to look for error reports or such. Thus any pointer would be highly appreciated.\nI'd be super happy and grateful if someone could help me!\n\nA: The keyboard was broken.

I closed out of it before it could send the person, but is it possible that it went through without me knowing?\nIs it possible that I could send something but not have it show up in the text thread on my phone?\n\nA: iOS will always tell you if a message is sent or not.

The relevant Apache config is:\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteRule ^/key-(.+)$ /index.html [P]\nProxyPassReverse \"/\" \"http://localhost/\"\n\nHow can I make my iOS home screen shortcut URL = http://www.host.com/key-foo (which, for the record, is the URL that is saved if I create a regular Safari bookmark).\n\nA: Answering my own question.\nThere's a property in my ReactJS app's manifest.json that is read by my home screen shortcut:\n\"start_url\": \"./index.html\"\n\nRemoving this property solves the issue and the home screen shortcut now has the correct (unaltered) URL of http://www.host.com/key-foo.\n", "Q: Windows File Sharing for Local Network Directory accounts in macOS Mojave I'm struggling with how directory services and local Mac accounts interact. I'm hoping to not have to specifically assign the 'Windows File Sharing' option to each user individually or Network Directory group access.\nIs it possible to share files to Windows clients who have a Local Network Directory (Open Directory) account in macOS Mojave?\n\nA: Think of macOS like a unix server. It runs it's own directory service and unless / until you bind it to another directory (like LDAP or NIS or AD) - you get any local account / password only when a SMB share tries to authenticate. It typically allocates user id number 501 to the first user so when a lot of Macs share files, the file server will see all the initial Mac accounts as the \"same 501 account\"\nIf you're OK setting up one Mac server - then I would go with Server.app to set up your small number of accounts but this gets unwieldy after a dozen to a few hundred accounts and you'll want to set the Mac to join an external domain. Then you could have people sign in to the shares using that scheme to issue unique ID numbers and accounts to each person to keep things straight. \nFor the Mac running LDAP/OpenDirectory there are several posts here that apply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Authenticate Mac users by LDAP\nSo - to address the two main points:\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't need to do anything specific to allow SMB sharing permissions - if the account exists on the Mac due to being a local account or part of a directory it subscribes to - shares that allow all users will just work when a correct user/pass is presented from windows SMB clients (or any SMB client for that matter)\n\n*You can have multiple directories of accounts - the Mac will order them in most preferred to last checked - as long as one user is found in one directory - that user can potentially log in.\n\n\nStart small with this - you can set up two or three users and test easily. Once you figure out if you want server app or just normal sharing (you might not need server.app) you can find the log files that log errors and quickly suss out when there's a problem in most cases.\n\nA: It is indeed possible to enable Windows File Sharing for a network directory account. You'll need to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo pwpolicy -u <shortname> -sethashtypes SMB-NT on in a Terminal; authenticate for sudo.\n\n*Have the user you just modified in step 1 set their password. This does not mean they have to change it; if you run passwd <shortname>, they can enter the same password in both the Old Password and New Password prompts. This is enough to get the Mac to re-hash the password for the SMB-NT type required for Windows file sharing.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there does not seem to be a way for the admin to do this for someone, without the admin needing to reset their password to something else. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: “SIMBLAgent.app“ wants access to control I updated to Mojave yesterday and since then I get so many windows prompting up with the message “SIMBLAgent.app“ wants access to control... and I can get rid of all those windows comming. \nSomeone knows how to stop that?, any help is appreciated\n\nA: These messages are part of the new security measures in Mojave. You are giving up control of your system to apps you may not intend, so you should deny those requests until you’re sure it is not malware or something you don’t want typing / interacting on your behalf. \nConsider, an app could copy text like passwords or just watch for you typing / save screen captures using these permissions. Not all do, but you might use caution before disabling security. \nYou can try giving the app full disk access in the System Preferences.app > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access. Add the application by using the [+] icon or by dragging to the list.\n\n\nA: As per Gummibando's answer, you'll need to give permissions to SIMBLAgent.app in Security & Privacy in preferences:\nThe full path to the app should be:\n/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/SIMBLAgent.app\n\nHowever, it appears Automation is the correct category:\n\n", "Q: AppStore Review: Is there any way to get to another reviewer? Is there a way to resubmit an iOS app for review so that it will be verified by another Apple employee? \nApple rejects our app for the third time because of spam (point 4.3 of AppStore Review Guidelines), but we don't agree with that. Our app has a lot of features that similar apps don't have. We want to get some additional information about the reason, but Apple always sends us a sample answer without any details.\n\nA: There is no way to guarantee a different reviewer.\nIt is highly likely that each review is documented internally, with future reviewers examining the application's past before starting a new review. Thus problems or concerns raised before, will be raised again.\nContact Apple Developer\nOnly Apple can help you. Contact Apple Developer and ask them for more information about the rejection. Phoning Apple may result in a more detailed answer and start a conversation about eventually being accepted.\nRegrettably Apple's reviews can feel capricious; this is a cost of being in Apple's App Store.\n", "Q: Can't navigate dialog using keyboard only I checked this other question and I have a problem navigating through dialog boxes that is not answered there.\nI'm copying + pasting folders and when the dialog \"Stop/Replace/Merge\" appears I can't navigate with the TAB because the dialog box never gets focus.\nIf I click on the dialog box then I can tab between the buttons, but that defeats the point of using the keyboard and slows me down (I have several folders to paste in different locations).\nIs this a bug? I do have \"Full Keyboard Access\" turned on. I also checked this question and nothing there helps me. I already updated to Mojave.\n\nA: It’s annoying, macOS is generally pretty good with keyboard shortcuts but there are one or two places where it doesn’t work!\nI think the dialog does have focus (it’s technically a window and appears ticked in the Window menu, and you can press ⌘M to minimise it) but it just doesn’t allow you to use the keyboard to activate the buttons.

My iPad (2.5yo) has a device passcode that I seem to have forgotten, and only way around seems to be to \"erase\" the device (by pressing Home and top power button together to hard-reset), but that always simply restarts the device and does nothing else, i.e. it doesn't go into the so-called \"Recovery mode\" but instead boot into regular iOS where I can login to use various iOS apps. I was following procedure mentioned here: https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204306#recovery\nThe device passcode is needed to \"pair\" the device with iTunes (on my Windows PC), as it is not paired yet, and nor is the device sync'd with iTunes.\nPlease note that I've already tried all passwords I could recollect and am at the 8th attempt, where device gets disabled for 15minutes, and for next wrong attempt, I think it'd get disabled for 1 hour.\nAlso, I am able to login to the iPad using touch-id, and launch applications etc. Only the \"device passcode\" is what I think I have a problem with.\n\nA: To put your iPad in restore mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPad to your computer (iPad and Computer turned on, iTunes opened on computer)\n\n*Press and hold Sleep/Wake + Home button until the screen goes black\n\n*Release the Sleep/Wake-Button but KEEP PRESSING THE HOME BUTTON until the iTunes logo appears on the iPad.

I should point out I have admin rights on the machine.\nNothing special about these accounts as far as I'm aware.\nHowever when my user logs onto the machine, to do their work and then reboots, at logon they are only prompted for the password for the IT admin account. They don't see the username and password fields.\nI'm trying to go through the console logs but unsure what I'm even looking for.\nI should have mentioned, I have admin rights but some features are locked down via JAMF security profiles.\nAnyone else seen this issue?\n\nA: go to setting > security and privacy > FileVault. There should be a notice saying that some users are not allowed to unlock the Vault, with an option to change the setting. You have to have admin privileges to change the setting.\n\nA: FileVault is the clear case where the system will boot to a pre-OS screen and show you only the file vault enabled accounts. When you sign in and authenticate as one of these accounts, that unlocks a decryption key that allows the OS to be readable and starts the actual OS boot process.\nYou can determine which accounts have been enabled in FileVault by examining that system preference once you’re logged in to the running OS.\nSince you managed MDM and JAMF - here is an article with great technical data on the need for a secure token to be provisioned for each FileVault enabled account:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/secure-token-and-filevault-on-apple-file-system/\nYour IT team should investigate JAMF Connect which extends the typical log in screen to let any AD allowed account log in. It also can be provisioned so that membership in an AD group maps to an admin local account or a non-admin local account.

The last screenshot was taken at 1:09 PM, but it is neither at the top nor at the beginning of the list. This is frustrating, because this forces me to visually search when I want to send a screenshot I just took to a friend. \nIs there any way to change my settings so Finder sorts by date?\n\nA: The toolbar specifies how to group the files and clicking the column name is for sorting the files. If you want to reorder the files, just click the column name directly.\nBased on your screenshot, you're grouping by \"Date Created\" and then sorting by \"Name\". You can see the group names are \"September\", \"August\", etc.\nYou can fix this: set the grouping (using the toolbar) to \"None\" and then click on the \"Date Created\" column name, that should fix your issue.\nEDIT: If you're not using the List view, you can press ⌘J to open \"View options\", then click the drop-down there to Sort by \"Date Created\".

The \"bring the new phone close to an old one\" and sync by bluetooth doesn't cut it cuz it requires iOS version 11+, and the 5c is on version 10.3 (and can't update to 11).\nSo I wanted to make a backup of the 5c through iTunes and then load the new phone from the backup. But when I plug in the 5c, iTunes prompts me with \"do you wanna set this phone as new?\" message:\n\n(the backups are from my personal iPhone, which is irrelevant to this issue).\nSo, then I click \"cancel\" and I am into the regular iTunes interface, but the phone button is not there:\n\nI tried to go to System Information -> USB and the phone was there, recognized.

Setup this phone as new sounds like it's going to do something like wipe the phone, but it really just means the phone hasn't been plugged in and used with iTunes, so add it as a new phone into iTunes.\nYou definitely do not want to restore from backup (overwriting what you have on the phone now), so choose setup as new.\nA couple of references, since I know \"setup as new\" sounds scary:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4094634\n\n*https://deciphertools.com/support/knowledge-base/how-do-i-backup-my-iphone-or-ipad-w-itunes/ (from my blog - very bottom of the article)\n", "Q: What is \"Two system dialogs displayed\" message?

I go to Audio.MIDI Set up, click the little + and see a new Aggregate Device. I see only four check boxes, Built in Mic and output and my two airpods. Where is the internal mic? and what do I do after I select it?\n\nA: I think the solution is to open Sound when they aren't connected, select proper input (Macbook Pro), then close Sound.\nSimilar to Finder or other windows where that's how you set default sizing, I think this actually sets the default.\n\nA: You can use this program: http://milgra.com/airpods-sound-quality-fixer.html\nIt's open-source project: https://github.com/milgra/airpodssoundqualityfixer\nAnd it allows you to automatically switch to a built-in MacBook microphone, then you don't have to do anything, after connecting your AirPods to your mac.\nAnyway, it should be fixed by Apple, it's ridiculous, to automatically decrease audio quality to such a bad level. And it's not so obvious, to go to settings and change the source of the microphone. In the begging, I was struggling to just recognize why this sounds like a ... so bad\n\nA: This is because you opened some app in the background that consistently uses your microphone while you are playing audio in other apps. Check what app or tab is using the input and shut it down. Then, the quality will be excellent even if the input is still your Airpods, which is the default setting.\n\nA: My working solution is:\nOpen the standard “Audio MIDI Setup.app” utility, and click the \"+\" at the bottom to create an Aggregate Device. Then select the Internal Microphone as the only component in this aggregate device and select it as the default input. For some reason this prevents Mac OS X from selecting the Bluetooth Microphone from now on and it will stay on the internal one when you reconnect.\nAfter creating that aggregate input, go to your usual System Preferences -> Sound -> Input (tab)\nTaken from: How to Force Bluetooth Headphones to Use Internal Microphone in macOS\n", "Q: Trying to understand display specs of macbook pro I want to buy a monitor to connect to my macbook pro.

I have installed a fan control app but the fan refuses to slow down.\nAny ideas?\nThanks.\n\nA: There are few reason why the Fan run at high speed.\n1- is when something is actually running hot and Mac needs to cool it\n2- a Fan controller SMC is misbehaving and needs rest\n3- a hardware failure from a Thermal sensor\n---------------Fixing\nA 3D party Fan speed software will not fix anything \n1- to check that look in the Activity Monitor to see who is consuming CPU and shut it down.\n2 - Reset your SMC, it is your model dependent so look it up. Since it can be tricky to do, watch the magsafe light briefly changing the color as you do the reset.\n3 - if none of the above worked you might have a faulty temperature sensor. see Apple service for that.\n", "Q: My iPhone SE has ceased booting up upon power-on My iPhone SE had difficulty in upgrading to IOS 12.0.1. A visit to my local Apple store solved this problem.  Four days later, after turning off the phone for the evening, I turned power on, the Apple symbol appeared, but the software would not complete loading.  I tried the hard reset (Power on and home button held simultaneously,) the phone rebooted, and the Apple symbol appeared, but the iPhone hung and would not complete the reboot.  I believe I need an appointment again at my local Apple store. I would like your opinion before I call and make an appointment.\nThanks so much.\n\nA: Get your hardware in the hands of a trained technician is the best plan.

I have seen this question several times but no clear answer. I changed the password on the admin user account and It saved it as a standard user. I just bought the Mac so I’m a newbie.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have tried booting into single user mode so I can creat another admin user but my wireless keyboard driver isn’t loading quick enough before it boots up. \n\n*I have also tried changing the password using command+R and when I get to sign in with Apple ID it says not connected to internet and won’t let me do that either. \n\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I was able to do this in Recovery mode, not single-user. In Recovery mode, you are not started up from your normal system volume, so files are not at their usual paths. \nI had to go into terminal and type \nrm /Volumes/\"Macintosh HD\"/var/db/.AppleSetupDone \n\nNote: that if your main volume is named something other than \"Macintosh HD\", you need to substitute that at the appropriate place; also, there must be a space after \"rm\" and cannot be one before \".AppleSetupDone\".\nAlso, standard dscl commands will not work as expected in Recovery mode. Once done exit terminal and restart. Upon restart I was able to select a new user with admin privilege. \nWhat a beating !!\n", "Q: Are there ad blocker that filters YouTube advertisements on Mojave Safari Version 12.0?

In Keynote, I would like to show some text and then have it replaced by an image. It would be awesome if I could do that by using the cube effect, having the text and image on different faces of the cube and then rotating the cube so the photo replaces the text, but I cannot find a way to do this. I cannot even find a way to get multiple build effects to run simultaneously. \nIs it possible to combine a build in and a build out animation in one step? If so, how do I do it?\nIf that is not possible, what are my options for creating a presentation where a text item is replaced with an image while the rest of the slide stays the same? Magic Move does not seem to handle replacing things, only moving them around. \n\nA: It is possible to have objects run their animations at the same time. This is done in the Build Order window, which is available from the Animation palette (button at the bottom labeled \"Build Order\") or via the View > Show Build Order menu item. Set one of the 2 animations to fire normally, either \"On Click\" or \"After Transition\". \nSet the second animation to go immediately after the first one, either by setting its build order number to 1 more than the other, or by dragging and dropping in the Build Order window so that it is immediately below the other. Select the second animation, and now you have the option in the Start menu to start \"With Build x\" where \"x\" is the build number of the animation directly above it. \nSo, by setting one item to have a build in of Cube and another item to have a build out of Cube and setting them to go at the same time, I can get the effect I want of having the one replaced by the other. \n", "Q: How to turn off menu bar autohide in split view mode?

I recently upgraded to mojave and everything was fine and dandy in terms of speed and everything. However, my hard drive failed. Luckily I had just done a time machine backup a few hours prior to HDD failing. After getting a new SSD and starting to recover I hit some issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*it took several days to do the time machine recovery of 500GB \n\n*now my machine runs really really slow. As in it takes 30s to register one keyboard press etc. \n\n\nany pointers/help would be much appreciated. \n\n\n\n\nA: It may be a bad drive. Having this exact same problem, system extremely slow after Time Machine restore, all vitals check out fine, but I'm using a late 2015 iMac. Seems to be a pretty specific problem. It's important to note this is an APFS volume, as this seems to be somewhat common. I upgraded to Mojave about 3 months ago.\nOpened console, and saw invalid btree errors constantly happening as files were trying to be accessed, I'm assuming that's the cause of the slowness. Disk Utility found errors but couldn't repair, booting in single user mode using fsck couldn't repair.\nDecided to wipe the volume, and re-install the OS. 2 minutes before finishing the first step of the install, an error appeared saying there was a problem with the install, and to \"try again.\" This was enough evidence to tell me this physical disk is bad.\nOne more thing to note about this, my Time Machine drive (external 3TB WD drive) went bad at the same time, cannot be repaired, doesn't show up when doing a recovery from a backup. Not sure what to make of that, as that's obviously too coincidental.\n", "Q: How to download OpenGL versions later than 2.1 on MacBook Pro Sierra? I am trying to run a game called Space Engine using WineSkin on Sierra.  However, the game gives an error saying that the OpenGL version is 2.1, which is below the requirements to run the game.  The minimum to run the game is 3.3.  How can I download OpenGL 3.3 onto my MacBook Pro? \n\nA: The Mac's native OpenGL version will depend on its age; but Apple stopped supporting native OpenGL years ago & many games can only use legacy OGL, which is 2.1.\nUnless the game developers themselves support Apple's native OGL, then 2.1 is all you can have, Running a Windows game through an interpreter is unlikely to be able to do that.\n", "Q: why wont my macbook pro mount my disc I have been using my macbook pro since 2013.

I want to debug mobile version of my website on my iphone/android. But cannot open it on mobile. I've read some related questions and all they suggest is to add localname to /etc/hosts but I already have it, but still cannot access it from mobile. \nYes - I'm on the same WiFi. \nYes - I can access web server by IP, but not localname.\nWhat did I miss?\n\nA: If you can get to your web server via IP address but not by hostname that means that you do not have DNS configured. DNS is designed to translate between so-called \"friendly names\" and IP addresses via a DNS server.\nYou can't edit the /etc/hosts file on iOS without jailbreaking your iPhone.\nWhat you need to do is be able to manually configure your router (assuming you have a common home router provided by your ISP) to point local addresses to specific local host names. Unfortunately most home routers don't let you modify DNS settings, instead they pass DNS through to the ISP's DNS servers or use a public DNS server.\nSo what you would need to do is set up a DNS server on your local network to point local IP addresses to specific host names and then set up your iPhone to use that DNS server in Settings > WiFi > [your Wifi network] > Configure DNS > Manual.\nBut honestly that is a lot of trouble, I'd just use the IP address.\n", "Q: Why can't I access File Sharing when Open Directory is enabled in macOS Mojave?

If you know you have 50 GB amount to free, change the 5 below to 50 and then the system will iterate across all the local snapshots and prune them in the order defined by the system.\ntmutil thinlocalsnapshots / $(echo \"5 * 1000000000\" | bc) 2\n\nThe only iteration I would do is to see how many APFS volumes you have and then perhaps thin any that are mounted.\nHere’s a nice thread explaining the urgency - 2 works well for my needs, but the manual page explains there are 4 levels of urgency, so if you have specific needs, watch the IO and performance during thinning and experiment with smaller snapshots to thin.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to thin your local Time Machine Snapshots on macOS High Sierra\n\nA: I found by accident that opening the \"Storage administration\" windows (Cmd-U) in \"System Information\" released the local time machine snapshots making the space available.\nI do not know if this is an officially supported way.\n\nA: In Terminal, execute this small script:\nfor d in $(tmutil listlocalsnapshotdates | grep \"-\"); do sudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots $d; done\n\nThe script lists all snaphosts and deletes all of them in a loop.\n\nA: Step 1:\nIn Terminal, enter the following command to list all backup snapshots:\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\nYou will get a list of all the snapshots in the root directory (/).\nStep 2:\nDelete each snapshot by entering the following command + date of the corresponding snapshot:\nsudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots <snapshot_date>\nExample:\nsudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2020-09-26-143409\nBonus Tip:\nRemember you can always get help with a command in terminal by entering the root command -h or -help.\nEnter tmutil -help to see all the Time Machine Utility commands, and usage instructions.\n\nA: The even more elegant way to delete all snapshots:\nfor x in $(tmutil listlocalsnapshots /);do\nsudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots $(cut -d '.' -f 4 <<<\"$x\")\ndone\n\n", "Q: My iPhoto library takes way too much space on my Mac Air. Can I upload it to the iCloud? So, the iPhoto library (not to be confused with the \"Photos library\") takes almost 30 gigs on my 250 gb macbook air. I am curious, I've managed to upload the Photos library to the iCloud reducing it's size to mere 3 GB. Is there any way I can do the same trick with the iPhoto library? As far as I can understand, it's the location for my older photos, taken and uploaded before apple rolled the new photos library in?\n\nA: No, you can’t. In order to do this, you have to migrate from iPhoto to Photos.\nPhotos contains the integration with iCloud storage that can offload to your iCloud account on demand to free up local space.\n\nA: iPhoto is basically dead, isn’t it? How about exporting your pictures from iPhoto into iCloud Photos? Do it as a batch, a few at time, verifying upload before deleting the originals. You will likely lose any organization (albums, etc) unless you manually create albums and import into those, or just live with the automatically created events and albums iCloud Photos creates for you.\n", "Q: Battery draining fast and Haptic feedback not working I have a 13\" MacBook Pro Retina early 2015. A few days ago I was working on a spreadsheet and then it suddenly crashed (black screen for several minutes). Once it finally started up again, the Haptic feedback had stopped working. After more use I have found that the battery is draining faster and when I close the lid from 100% charge over night, I come to it in the morning and it's well below 50% charge.\nI believe I have reset the SMC, with no change. Updated the software to Mojave V10.14.\nHas anyone else had this issue, or any ideas of a fix?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The simple solution to a battery draining is that it's a faulty battery (which can even happen with a new part - it's less likely, but it does happen) or a faulty logic board.\nThe simple solution to haptic feedback is a bad logic board, a bad cable (connection reseat possibly) or a bad part.\nSo, right now you have two strikes against the logic board and can probably open and reconnect all cables before you start to replace parts to isolate this to one failure or two failures.\nAs far as software triage, you can test by downloading and installing a fresh, new OS onto an external USB drive. Even a slow drive will work for testing that the CPU is low in activity monitor and do a run time test to see how fast the battery discharges in idle and sleep. It also lets you test the haptic feedback on a fresh system. I'd hate for you to go in for more hardware repairs if there's a software cause.\n", "Q: Chrome loading inconsistently after Mojave upgrade After the Mojave upgrade my Google Chrome has consistently loaded slow and often will spin and not to connect to a website.

I was using speech recognition to send a message in WhatsApp, and when I said “multiplied by” this sign appeared:\n\nI can’t remember seeing this symbol on the default iOS keyboards, so I wonder if there are other ways to input this character (and maybe other characters?) into the phone without using speech recognition.\n\nA: There is a paid app, called unichar that allows for searching (and input) all of the Unicode characters\nIf you just need to search (and copy) some Unicode chars, you can use their web app at:\nhttps://unichar.app/web/\n\nA: For such characters you use an app like Unicode Pad.  Or just copy/paste one from here × into a text replacement on your phone.\n\nA: If you use the Emoji keyboard you will find a bold \"x\" in with all the symbols near the end of the list in iOS.\nI have never found one with a long press on any letter or character so perhaps that is the only one available to iPhone users.\n\nA: You can also use Simbol, which is a small free app. \n\nA: Unless/until Apple deigns to provide a built-in unicode keyboard (as it does for macOS), you'll need to use a keyboard provided by a 3rd party app.\nThe free app CharMap provides a minimal version of this, where you may have a hard time finding the symbol you're looking for.\n×, for example, is about halfway through the LATIN-1 SUPPLEMENT section, near the end of a group of accented capital letters, not grouped with other mathematical symbols.\n", "Q: Cloud storage encryption Is it recommended to encrypt files stored via cloud. For example, although certain cloud repositories encrypt data in transit - should I still use a secondary encryption tool for cloud storage?\nthanks :)\n\nA: Depends on what your needs are.\nDo you trust the cloud storage provider to have implemented encryption in transit and in rest correctly?\nDo you trust that the cloud storage provider won't access the files themselves, or allow others to access them (on purpose or through hacking) - if that is possible with the security model chosen by the cloud storage provider?\nIf not, you could consider encrypting the files themselves before you place them in the cloud. Is it worth it for a copy of last year's birthday greetings card for Aunt Betty? Is it worth it for a copy of the book keepings of your company?\nIt really depends on what you need to store (how sensitive it is) and how much hassle you can live with to mitigate the risk of having the cloud storage provider's security (or lack of) broken.\nIf you do choose to encrypt, it will give you more hassle as you'll need to manually encrypt and decrypt files in order to access them - or rig some kind of automated system for doing the same, without sacrificing security.\n", "Q: How to change the Shift+Click hotkey in Safari?

If the measurements start off wrong - they won't get back to accurate in my experience and one watch I had didn't have my phone nearby when I set it up, and ended up with my step length 10% off.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204516\nI'd run through all the items from the top and see if you can get the step length accurate for the terrain you're most likely to want the numbers to be accurate. I've set up about a watch about a dozen times, and I only had one time it was off enough to need a recalibration, so it's hard to guess how common this is from anecdotal reports like yours and mine.\n", "Q: Computer playing sound from a TV commercial. How does this happen This just started happening tonight on my iMac running High Sierra. About every 15 or 20 minutes my computer plays the sound track, or part of the soundtrack, from a common TV commercial. This Capitol One commercial is probably used on many websites but I don't know that for sure. I don't know how or why this is happening but I'd like to turn it off or stop it some way. I've had this happen when I have a web page open and a commercial is played but I have closed all browser windows and quit all browsers. But that didn't stop it. I don't see anything happening on my computer when the sound starts playing. I ran Malwarebytes but it said my computer is clean. How does a sound play without an application? Can someone tell me how to find what is going on?\n\nA: I opened activity monitor and checked it whenever the sound started playing. Dashboard started using a lot of computer resources when this occurred. I inadvertently copied something to the dashboard that would play these soundtracks. I deleted 2 files there that I knew nothing about and that solved my problem.\n", "Q: How to skip 'Cancel' 'Continue' when running shell script with automator?

She has maxed out her iCloud storage, so we need to clean some up (deleting from Photos, maybe archiving to an external hard drive).\nUnfortunately, some of them are included in dozens of iOS iMovie videos that she would like to keep. If I just delete the original footage, the iMovie videos will break. (Exporting the iMovies would preserve the final product, but she wants the iMovies to remain editable.)\nWhat's the best way to identify the videos that are safe to delete, or otherwise preserve the iMovie videos? Transferring the footage directly to iMovie would be ideal, but doesn't seem to be possible (videos are linked, not embedded).\nMy best answer at the moment is a tedious process of manually identifying the videos to keep, one clip at a time. For each clip, we have to watch it and, by trial and error, figure out which item in the Photos library matches. Being able to directly apply a \"Favorite\" to a clip from iMovie, or even being able see the file name, would be a huge improvement.\n\nA: The feature I'm looking for exists but was hard for me to find initially.\nThe Share menu will, for some destinations, allow you to choose between an iMovie Project and a Video File. The iMovie Project option, as a side effect, embeds all referenced video clips.\nThe ideal for me is to share to iTunes. This is a poorly-labeled choice, but what it actually does is make an archived copy of the project on local iPad storage. That archived copy can be restored later (no use of iTunes necessary).\nSo, my workflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*For each iMovie project, Share to iTunes as an iMovie Project\n\n*Delete the unwanted older videos from iCloud Photos\n\n*If an iMovie is now broken, delete it and restore from the archived copy in the iTunes tab of the Project Import menu\n\n\nThe ideal would be a one-click embed videos command, but as a workaround, this isn't too bad.\n", "Q: How to stop gatekeeper always asking for app verification in standard account?

The only app I use which switched to a dark theme with LightsOff is Things.\n\nA: I have come up with a (hacky) way to change themes in JetBrains editors using bash and AppleScript. An example for PyCharm would be something like:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Switch macOS dark mode on and off\nosascript -e '\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell appearance preferences\n            set dark mode to not dark mode\n        end tell\n    end tell\n'\n\n# Change PyCharm theme\n\n# Assumes default key mappings\n# Switch to dark theme if macOS dark mode is on\n# 2>/dev/null to suppress error if macOS dark mode is off\nif defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle 2>/dev/null | grep -q \"Dark\"; then\n    osascript -e '\n        if application \"PyCharm\" is running then\n            -- switch focus to PyCharm\n            tell application \"PyCharm\" to activate\n            tell application \"System Events\"\n                -- open Quick Switch Theme menu\n                keystroke \"`\" using {control down}\n                -- Select Look and Feel\n                keystroke \"5\"\n                delay 0.4\n                -- Select Darcula\n                keystroke \"2\"\n            end tell\n        end if\n        '\n# Switch to light theme if macOS dark mode is off\nelse\n    osascript -e '\n        if application \"PyCharm\" is running then\n          tell application \"PyCharm\" to activate\n            tell application \"System Events\"\n                keystroke \"`\" using {control down}\n                keystroke \"5\"\n                delay 0.4\n                keystroke \"1\"\n            end tell\n        end if\n        '\nfi\n\nI actually use it as a part of a larger script but the code above should work fine for PyCharm only (or any other JetBrains IDE, just replace application name). If you experience issues, I would suggest increasing/introducing delays between keystrokes like the delay 0.4 in the code above.\n\nA: Update: Chrome now fully supports dark mode in Chrome 73 and JetBrains IDEs support dark mode in 2020.3.\n\nSince PyCharm and other JetBrains IDE's are made in Java, they will not be able to use the native macOS Dark mode. Any system settings you apply also most likely won't affect Java applications, unless the developer specifically adds support for it, which probably won't happen due to the complexities of using system features with Java.(I've made some apps in Java, and it's currently impossible to use the macOS Dark Mode)\nMany native apps will support Dark Mode without the developer having to do anything, but some that use custom UI views and controls, like Chrome, will need to add support for it manually. Dark mode support for Chrome is in progress(see here). SourceTree also uses custom controls and therefore doesn't support Dark Mode yet.\n", "Q: Disable the internal keyboard of a MacBook Pro I'm looking for a solution to completely disable the internal keyboard of my MacBook Pro 13\" Model A1278 (MacBookPro8,1).\nI have no idea how it happened but when it is on, randomly, some letters are pressed without interruption for several minutes.

Even though it is already corrupted, it is possible to further corrupt it by trying to fix it. Make sure you have a copy before this.\nThen I would suggest simply trying multiple times to check and fix the file system in single-user mode. It sounds counterintuitive, but really you sometimes need to do this multiple times to clear all errors.\nYou would run a check like this:\nfsck -fy\n\nNote that even though you're \"repairing\" the file system, it is really just fixing data structures to be internally consistent. You might (and probably will) loose data and files in the process.\nAs you have a RAID-0 drive, there's no redundancy in the RAID that can help you rebuild the drives while keeping all your data intact. If the data on the drive is important enough for you that you won't be happy if you loose it, then you shouldn't run RAID-0 - but rather a RAID-level with redundancy. And always create backups!\n", "Q: What are stored on the “KG” drive? Last time my Mac had some startup problems and I went to the Genius Bar for a clean OS installation. The technician took out a hard drive called “KG” and booted my Mac from a recovery partition on it.\nJust for curiosity, I want to know what are included on the “KG” drive. During booting, I saw a lot of normal and recovery partitions of different macOS versions. It would be interesting to know what other partitions/special tools are on the drive (and perhaps it would be handy for me to have a similar drive if I encountered similar problems again).\nThe only thing I know is the appearance. It should be a LaCie 2TB Rugged Thunderbolt + USB-C, with the “LACIE” trademark replaced by an Apple logo and the two uppercase characters “KG”. I think the words “Genius Bar” are also printed on it, if I recall correctly.\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: There's no way anyone here can know what exactly was stored on a specific hard drive handled by an unspecified technician in an unspecified location. You should ask the technician if you can instead.\nThe contents on that hard drive has most possible changed numerous times between then and now. There's no guarantee in any form that any \"KG\" drive has the same contents as any other \"KG\" drive across countries, stores, technicians, etc.\nIn practical reality, there's really no chance for you to get an exact copy of that technicians hard drive at the time of your repair.\nModerne Macs have recovery partitions on their hard drives or SSD by standard. They also contain internet recovery within the flash portion of their main board - so even if you replace the hard drive or SSD, you'll be able to boot from that and reinstall macOS or alternatively fix problems with the drive.\n", "Q: How to see if MacBook Air is \"talking to\" USB to Ethernet adaptor (without an Ethernet device at the other end)? I've been using an Apple USB to Ethernet adaptor plus a short Ethernet cable to connect to an Ether net device (Raspberry Pi in thins case).\nNormally when I connect the lights blink on the device and everything works nicely using VNC Viewer.\nToday no blinking lights or connection.\nIs there a way I can check to see if I at least have a USB connection from my MacBook Air to the Apple USB/Ethernet converting dongle? Something I can do on my laptop that shows the dongle is there and connected by itself?\nI'd like to check that part if possible as the first step in debugging my connect problem.\n\nA: You can check if the Mac sees the Ethernet adapter by doing [Apple menu] / About this Mac, clicking System Report, and then looking at USB in the Hardware section. \n", "Q: Macbook pro keyboard stuck issue I have 15 inch macbook pro , i am facing issue with keys , option key is automatically pressed and becoming active all the time when i press any key in marked red zone in image . the Left Option is not working and Right Option key is working , when i press twice option key , than it is inactive (i tested after enabling hot key from preferences ) .\nHere is the keyboard image\n\nfor ex. if i press Space key or right shift or enter then Option key is becoming active .\nWhat is the possible fix for this ??\n\nA: I had similar issues.

I have this pesky file \"qmasterd\" that has been moved to the \"Incompatible Software\" folder by the macOS Installer. It must have been lying around on my Mac from years ago when I had Final Cut Pro v6 installed. Anyway, I cannot delete it, and I've tried a lot...\nThe file has these permissions:\n-r-sr-sr-x  1 root  daemon  280688 27 Apr  2007 qmasterd\nWhen I try to chmod, chgrp, or chown all I get is:\nbash-3.2# chmod g-s qmasterd\nchmod: Unable to change file mode on qmasterd: Operation not permitted\nIdeas please?\n\nA: Right, a solution that worked for me...\nRestart in Recovery mode, launch Terminal from the Tools menu, move to the directory with the offending file, rm filename and \"Bob's your Uncle!\"  :-)\n\nA: The problem in this case is that the file gets protected by SIP at some point and then gets moved while retaining that protection. A SIP-protected file cannot be altered or deleted, not even as root (hence the alternate name ‘rootless’ for SIP). \nTemporarily turning off SIP or deleting it while the main system is not running (i.e. from recovery mode as suggested or from Target Disk Mode) is the only option that remains.\n", "Q: Can you run the latest MySQL security update on macOS 10.12 Sierra? We're still running MySQL (community server) on macOS 10.12 Sierra (because Apple has gutted later versions of macOS and macOS Server and we don't want to go there just yet). It appears the latest MySQL security updates (October 2018) no longer support macOS with the 5.6.x track. The 5.7.x and 8.x tracks now only list installers for 10.13 High Sierra and 10.14 Mojave.\nSo, the question is: can you install the latest MySQL 5.7.24 on macOS 10.12 Sierra and will it run without problems?\nI'm okay if it's simply \"unsupported\" and will install but if it specifically won't install/will cause problems I would like to know before upgrading. I've searched the MySQL web site for information on this but there is nothing.\nI asked this question on the MySQL forums and got no response. I asked the question on StackOverflow but they recommended to post it here. Hope someone here can help.\n\nA: No one bothered to reply (except for the idiot that suggested \"why not just try it out?\" for an in service, online, production server) but for those of you who may come across my original post I can now confirm, after extensive in-house testing, that MySQL 5.7.24 does NOT work on macOS 10.12 Sierra. It will spawn too many files for its process and eventually die requiring a full restart of the whole computer - you can't just kill and restart MySQL. With no security updates available for older versions of MySQL, this now makes MySQL useless on anything but macOS 10.13 High Sierra or later. Thus, given the awful state of macOS Server, your days of running a decent macOS Server with MySQL are now numbered. Time to start testing alternate operating systems and switch…\n", "Q: iPhone - Whats the matter with the Passcode? I'm just thinking about the passcode to unlock the iPhone. You have to retype the passcode regularly. Winter is coming - so wearing touch-gloves are fine for using the iPhone. To unlock the iPhone, Touch ID doesn't work with gloves, so you have to type the passcode again. Some other situations e.g. you got sweaty fingers, Touch ID doesn't work, passcode again.\nI guess the passcode is part of the encryption. So I believe you should use a strong passcode instead of 4 easy digits. Besides the fact that passcode can always be used to unlock the phone, it's obvious you should use a strong passcode.\nI couldn't find a lot of information about the passcode on the Internet. So I'd like to ask here. Does anyone know more about it? Are my guesses correct, or does it simply make no change to use a less strong passcode?\nUpdate: My passcode is probably pretty strong. So typing the passcode is hardscrable for me.\n\nA: A strong passcode is harder to brute-force. The code itself it not used directly as an encryption key but rather used as an input to derive a real key from. So regarding the crypto behind the scenes, it doesn’t make much of a difference, but mostly works against attacks from the interface.\n", "Q: Watch Mac's iSight (webcam) on another Mac over LAN I have two Macs (A MacBook Air, and a MacBook Pro).\nNow, I'd like to view the live picture of the webcam of one MacBook on the other.

In AppleScript, this can be done like so:\nPOSIX path of (path to home folder)\n\n\n*However, as that was all going to be plugged in to a do shell script command, none of that is necessary, as you can use ~ to denote your home folder, and the shell will automatically expand this for you (provided it's not inside any quotes):\ndo shell script \"cd ~/.nvm/\"\n\n\n*There's no need to set result to.  result will automatically contain the result of the previous AppleScript command.  return result will work fine without needing to set result to.\n\nA: As a general rule, if you're having trouble with a set of code, try to create the simplest possible test case so you can be sure where the bug is.\nI created a one line applescript:\nset nodeVersion to do shell script \"node --version\"\n\nThis does indeed fail to work. Applescript says: error \"sh: node: command not found\" number 127\nSo the problem is that for some reason, sh can't find the node binary when run via Applescript. So I decided to try specifying the full path:\nset nodeVersion to do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/node --version\"\n\nIt worked! Not sure why this is necessary, but it should fix the problem. \n(Your path will likely be the same as mine, but if the above still doesn't work, try running which node in a terminal window to find what path you need.)\n", "Q: Install OS again without mouse I have to install my OS again from scratch but the mouse/trackpad doesn't work in Recovery mode (I can't access a session to edit anything as the computer has no OS at all right now).\nI managed to moved through the MacOS Utilities windows using cmd + F5 (voice control) and using Control + Cmd + arrows.

I was experimenting with the new desktop stack feature. Long story short, I ended up creating a folder on the dock and putting all the files from my desktop into it. When I did this all the files stayed on the desktop, so I deleted them (moved them to trash). When I saw that the files were no longer on my desktop, but were still in the folder in the dock, I emptied my trash. That's when I found out that the files in the folder on the dock must have just been symlinks because once the trash was emptied, so was the folder on my dock.\nUh oh, I just mistakenly deleted all the files that I had on my desktop.\nI searched google and see that there are programs (not produced by Apple) I can install to recover these files. I'm wondering if there is a simple (command line) way I can recover these files or if there is an official application produced by Apple that I can install to recover them.\nHow can I recover files that were emptied from the trash?\n\nA: There is not an official Apple product or command-line tool to undelete / recover in place these files short of Time Machine having made a copy to another volume or to a snapshot.\nI have used Data Rescue in the past and would recommend it. There are many questions here covering how that works and their free support is amazing.\nThe most important thing is to stop using that computer as soon as possible once you verify if Time Machine has you covered, because all disk activity risks over-writing deleted files, reducing your chance to recover intact data from the free space.\n\nThis doesn't help your situation now because the data is already lost, but in the future you can use Time Machine.\nTime Machine will backup files, even when the drive is not connected, so be sure to check in case you have a local snapshot you can recover.\n", "Q: Mojave: Pasting text with control characters I use git from within Terminal.app, and will occasionally end up (particularly after a merge resolution) with something like:\n$ git status\n  ...\n  Untracked files:\n      foo/bar/baz.orig\n\nWhere the whitespace before foo is a tab character.\nSince Mojave, copying and pasting that line (which I want to do to rm the file) results in an alert (complete with loud bonk) asking me to confirm whether I want to paste the nasty control characters.\nAnyone know if either:\n\n\n*\n\n*there's a way to disable the alert and just paste with the control\ncharacters, or \n\n*there's a keyboard shortcut to paste without the control\ncharacters?\n\n\nFWIW, I understand that there are other ways to remove the file (e.g. git status|grep orig$|xargs rm) and I understand why, in the general case, you'd want to limit pasting of control characters.\n\nA: Update your OS to 10.14.1 or later\nIt seems that Terminal in 10.14 would present this dialog when pasting a tab character, but the updated Terminal in 10.14.1 and 10.14.2 does not.\nI was scratching my head as to why I was only able to reproduce this issue on one install but not another. Unable to find any settings that had any impact, I eventually tried updating the machine that showed the dialog, and it was gone.\n\nA: So, keep in mind, the tab  character, Unicode U+0009 \"CHARACTER TABULATION\" (UTF-8/ASCII hex 09) is simply a regular character. One that is very annoying to deal with, yes. But it is not a 'control character'.\nThis is different what happens when you press the key on your keyboard labeled tab, which might be mapped to an escape sequence/control character like '\\t', which is different. \nThe specific issue you encountered is indeed \"fixed\" in 10.4.1+. However, this still doesn't mean you're not going to encounter this or similar errors.\n\nFor example, take the sequence:\nprintf '\\033[34mEscape!\\033[00m\\n'\n\nAnd try copy/pasting it (or its output) into different shells. Also try setting the Terminal.app setting 'Escape Non-ASCII input with Control-V', or using control-command-V, \"Paste Escaped Text\". Kinda weird stuff, eh?\n\n\n*\n\n*Within a terminal, your best bet for most things is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Generally, never use the ⌘C and ⌘V shortcuts to access the clipboard.\n\n*Instead, pipe to the pbcopy command, and then use pbpaste as needed.\n\n\n\nSo, this would be git status | pbcopy, and for some this you might want to copy, you might need to combine stderr and stdout: git error 2>&1 | pbcopy will result in an empty clipboard without 2>&1.\nThis still may strip out proper control characters (anything that isn't valid UTF-8). But as you mentioned, you're already aware of why you might not want to copy and paste these. If you're set on capturing \"control characters\" as well as text, what we're really talking about is just capturing a byte stream, so it is probably best to avoid the clipboard altogether, which has never had the functionality of reproducing arbitrary byte sequences.\n\nP.S. Have you considered switching to iTerm2?\n\nA: I would try granting Terminal full disk access in system preferences.\nYou can do this as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences...\n\n*Click on Security & Privacy\n\n*Select the Privacy tab\n\n*In the left hand pane, select the Full Disk Access option\n\n*Now click on the padlock at bottom-left of the window\n\n*Enter your Admin password and click on the Unlock button\n\n*Now click on the + button at the bottom of the right-hand side list\n\n*Navigate to the Terminal app (usually located inside the Utilities folder within your Applications folder) and open it (Note: If Terminal was already running you'll be prompted to quit it first)\n\n*Remember to lock the padlock again\n\n\nNow try pasting text with control characters into Terminal and see how you go.\n", "Q: Hard-Drive Storage size issues after partition Disk Utility I wanted to create a partition on my iMac for Windows to be able to play Windows games.

I like to add the hotkey window functionality of iTerm to any app. I have heard this is possible with BetterTouchTool, but I don't know how. I have seen opensource solutions like tdrop for linux, but none for macOS.\n\nA: It has been a couple of years, but hopefully this will be helpful to someone.\nThis is the way you would do it using BTT.\nPossible Solution\nThis is the way you would do it using BTT.\nSimply go to Keyboard Shortcuts, add a new Trigger under All Apps and assign the action \"Show / Hide Specific Application to it\". All that's left is to set the desired application in the configuration pane that will show up.\n\nCaveat\nThe one app that has this built-in, that I know of, is also iTerm. There's one big difference with this implementation and the native iTerm implementation.\niTerm is more of a \"drop-down\", in that it functions as an overlay. The BTT implementation will literally show and hide the application. This means that whenever you are working with multiple desktops, and you trigger this shortcut, BTT will move you to the desktop where the application is.\nI find this quite annoying TBH and would love to know if anyone knows how to do the same thing, but in a \"drop-down\" or \"overlay\" fashion\n", "Q: Macbook pro 13\" mid-2012 not turning on, no battery leds (battery ok) My MacBook pro 13\" 2012 won't boot up.

Apparently it had shifted somehow and got damaged by the outside screw of the battery. After I disconnected the cable (and eventually snipped off the damaged part of the indicator to prevent it hanging loose), the MacBook booted and is running and charging it's battery just  fine. So, if the cable in the picture is damaged and shortcircuits to the case, your Mac may not boot or do anything at all.\n\n", "Q: QuickTime Player 10.5 (928.50) Mojave - Controls Stuck, Always Visible Latest version Mojave 10.14.1 (18B75) did not fix it.\n\nCan't get the controls out of the way.\nMouse pointer is also always present.\n\nA: Disabling Accessability Keyboard fixed the problem.\n", "Q: System spiking CPU usage (causing 6000+ rpm on fans) Im running a mid-2012 macbook pro on 10.9.5.\nI've been having massive lag spikes over the last few weeks which have gotten more consistent and prevalent the last day. I have been wearing this macbook out for a while but these lag spikes are like nothing I have seen before. \n\nThese are the spikes that have happened during the writing of this post. The system seems to take up to 80% of my cpu for differing lengths of time with no clear intervals. \nAny tips on solving this or limiting the damage?\nI have been thinking of updating this machine to 10.11.1 for a while to make it compatible with my Wacom pad, but now I'm questioning if my old friend could still handle this...\nEDIT1:\nThe spikes have just started again and I have managed to capture the entire screen this time. Interesting to note is that as you can see I am running the steelseries engine for my mouse. During spikes my mouse completely ticks off as well and gets super sensitive until the end of the spike. \n\nI hope this shines a bit more light onto the situation.

Got another spike with these results:\n\nEDIT4(Still going): I've closed spotify and decided to see what happens then, still kept spiking. Was working with only pages open on a paper, first time with syscallbypid.d showed only pages taking up some space, but second time and third with some spikes later other stuff started to show up. Any idea what this could be?\n\n\nEDIT5: I've captured another screenshot of the entire screen from activity monitor to show what has been eating up most of the CPU, which is the Kernal_task. This spike happened with no other programs open, only stuff running in the background. \n\n\nA: The chart representing the CPU usage in the Activity Monitor can be misleading.\nThe scale on the Y -axis is not 100% but changes according to the CPU usage.\nYou could see what it looks like spikes even if they are of extermly low magnitude.\nSee my example. It looks like spikes while the actual CPU consumption is low. In this case the User- CPU load is 0% to 5.93% and the chart Y-axis is set to 6% so it just looks like huge spikes.\n\n", "Q: node wants to use the \"Local Items\" keychain Every so often when I open my computer, that message appears.

Powerpoint allows to stream a video directly as part of a presentation:\n\nIn PowerPoint, you can insert or link to an online video, and then play it during your presentation.\nThe video plays directly from the website, and it has the site's controls for playing, pausing, volume, and so on. The PowerPoint playback features (Fade, Bookmark, Trim, and so on) don't apply to online videos.\nBecause the video is stored on a web site, rather than in your presentation, you must be connected to the internet in order for the video to play successfully.\n\nI was wondering whether it is possible to stream a Youtube video from a Keynote slide directly, (using the video URL?), without having to download the .mp4 file on the computer.\nSo how can I include an online video directly into a Keynote presentation?\n\nA: No, keynote is cross platform (web, iOS and macos) and designed to not live-link to YouTube. \nUse another app. One to try us LiveSlides. \nConsider that you will still need internet connection to play the video because it is still linking to the website where the video is, if you do not download it, means that you might be in a situation where the presentation will not work.\n\nA: Keynote 8.2 still does not support embedding Videos from a URL. \nHowever, there are plenty of websites and apps that can download a YouTube video. \nAlso, if you open a YouTube video in VLC, then click on that tiny playlist icon, there should be the option \"Properties\" (or something like that) if you right-click on the video.\nThe original source should be shown in the up coming window.\n\nA: This is a terrible idea. Embedding just the URL just adds another point of failure. \nIf your goal is to hold a presentation then you download the video and embed the whole video. \nOther options, hacks and workarounds are not conducive to reliable presentations.\nMake the keynote file self-contained. \nThat means functional even if the URL changes, you are offline, the source changes the availability, the owner deletes it, you have to hold your presentation where censorship is a bit more prevalent than where you compose it [buffering…] \n", "Q: Multi-color Safari Pinned Tab Favicon How do I make my Safari Pinned Tab Favicon multi-colored like Pandora has? \nMy logo and favicon are three colors.\nI followed this tutorial to get the red svg I currently have, but it's a few years old.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/pinnedTabs/pinnedTabs.html\nThanks!\nJason\n\n\n\nA: Today I rebooted my iMac and when I opened Safari, the pinned tab icons are now multi-colored. It looks like Safari is now pulling the .ico file that the other browsers are pulling. Problem solved.\n\n\nA: If you provide an svg file linked in the header, Safari will use that for the pinned tab icon, and at least on my version (13.1.2), also for the regular tab icon.\nIf you don't provide one, Safari uses favicon.ico instead, so there you can have multiple colors.  My favicon.ico has 16, 24, 32, 48, and 64 px; it's using one of the first three, not sure which.  I would have to make a favicon.ico where those sizes have distinct graphics to tell.\nAnd getting rid of the svg is one less file and header line to deal with.  I don't know what the point of it is.\n", "Q: Auto Downloaded Emails Marked As Read in Inbox I open up my mac mail and I have a ton of emails downloaded which are marked as read even though I have not clicked on them or viewed them.

The tech specs of the Mac mini 2018 is unclear if the RAM or SSD can be upgraded by the user. \n\nA: You can find a guide on iFixIt, summarized on MacRumors.com: 2018 Mac mini Teardown: User-Upgradeable RAM, But Soldered Down CPU and Storage\nMemory: Yes*\nApple specifically mentions on the Apple Website that the Memory are SO-DIMM sockets (2666MHz DDR4 SO-DIMM).\n\nMac mini features high-performance 2666MHz DDR4 SO-DIMM memory\n\n*However, the warranty is voided if upgraded by the user as the modules are no longer directly accessible from the bottom but instead involve removing the antenna plate, fan and mainboard.\nStorage: No\nStorage is (like on the MacBooks) soldered onto the logic board and therefor non-replaceable (you would need to replace the entire logic board).\n\nA: You’ll need to wait for someone like iFixit to get one and do a teardown to be sure, but since they made a big deal in the presentation of it using SO-DIMMs it is very likely that the memory is user-upgradable. The SSD is probably not officially upgradable, but we’ll have to wait and see if it actually can be removed and replaced or if it’s part of the motherboard. \nEdited to add: This review from Tom’s guide confirms that the RAM is upgradable with difficulty (it’s only intended to be upgraded by Apple, not by the user) but the SSD is soldered to the motherboard and can’t be upgraded. https://www.tomsguide.com/us/mac-mini,review-5908.html\n\nA: Apple says: RAM is not user-installable on Mac mini (2018)\nWhile I do not know what this means in terms of voiding the warranty…\nApple does not consider the RAM in a Mac mini (2018) to be user-installable.\nThe Apple Support page Upgrade or install memory in your Mac mini says:\n\n2018\nMac mini (2018) does not have user-installable RAM. You can configure the memory in your Mac mini (2018) when you purchase it.

Or is there an app that I can use to accomplish this?\n\nA: You may try your luck with Pacifist. This application will take just the installer packages and extract them to where you want them as a destination.\nHowever, the application falls short in a few areas for a really complete installation, as some things were not designed in: pre- and post-install scripts, blessing (making it bootable), ownership and permission will likely be off.\nFor these problems there is a nice writeup available at How to install a very small version of OS X on an external drive (2007):\n\nSTEP 1: Format your drive (HFS+, journaled)\n  STEP 2: Enable owners    \n sudo /usr/sbin/vsdbutil -a /Volumes/CRUZER\n\nSTEP 3: Install OS X\n     Insert disc 1 of your OS X install media (you can close the Finder window that pops up; you don't need it), then open Pacifist and click the \"Open Apple Install Packages\" button at the bottom.

I'm using a Time Capsule to do Backups, I've been doing this for a while now. The problem is that the backup begins small and with time it becomes huge. So restricting its size would make Time Machine use it's own space saving operations (I guess).\nMy idea would be to change the sparsebundle's size limit to a size much smaller than the hard drive's size. Since the sparsebundle is where the backups are done it should restrict available space and cause pruning when that limit is reached.\nWould resizing the Sparsebundle cause any problem for the reliability or function of Time Machine?\n\nA: You could try using the Disk Utility to make a partition of a given size, and then having Time Machine backup to that partition. \n\nA: From https://dongknows.com/this-trick-will-keep-time-machine-backup-storage-use-under-control/:\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine the storage limit: Generally, 150% of the capacity of the Mac’s internal drive is a generous limit. Now convert that number in megabytes (MB).\n\n*sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine MaxSize CALCULATEDMAXSIZE\nOnce the backup file exceeds limited storage, old data will be deleted, so make sure you have a good choice of the limitation.\nNote: according to the article, this only works up to Sierra (macOS 10.12) or earlier.\n\nA: There aren’s viable ways to do this. Moreover, other controls are equally effective and less hassle/risk to implement. By watching what’s actually changing week to week and skipping less needed items if you can’t afford a storage to have a time interval of data you prefer (18 months of snapshots, for example). Also, the command line tools for deleting a specific file or folder lets you surgically reclaim space and manage things other than forcing a brute force prune.\n\n\n*\n\n*get a physical drive or two\n\n*avoid network backups as your only destination, especially if they are RAID or don’t have a backup. \n\n\n\nI much prefer to let the backup grow to take all available space if needed and just look at things when I set it up - maybe once every three days for a week or two then once a week or once a month till you are comfortable about the growth.\nWhen I find there's something taking a lot of space and I don't want it backed up - say the iPhotos library on a portable when the master library is in iCloud and synced to a Mac mini at home - I don't need to back up the optimized version on the MacBook. Set Time Machine to exclude the library and then I go into Time Machine interface and select that library and use the gear control to delete all backups of that library file. (folder / package to be correct in the case of Photos).\nThis way, I have just the files I need backed up and no hassle guessing sizes before hand and restricting things. I always can get notified when the oldest backup gets cleaned and can see the space grow.\nLastly - I use a very slick tool that could help you analyze and alert you to large backup intervals.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/\nYou can do much of what it does manually with tmutil compare but I love the ease and graphs it provides.\n", "Q: Secure delete removed in OSX 10.11 In OSX 10.10 there was an option to go to Finder > Empty Trash or Finder > Secure Empty Trash\nIn OSX 10.11 there now only seems to be an option for Finder > Empty Trash\nAny ideas way i can get it back ?\n\nA: It was deliberately removed by Apple, so can't be renabled.

The max resolution of the external monitor is 1920 x 1080.\nThe external display is not as crisp as my retina display, is this due to how I am connecting the monitor, or is it simply because I don't have enough pixels on my external monitor to display it with the same level of sharpness?\nIf I was to purchase a 4k monitor would this solve the problem?\nThank you for your help!\n\nA: The \"sharpness\" of a display is defined by its pixel density and measured in ppi (pixels per inch). So it is the combination of size and resolution that makes a display appear sharp.\nUnless the 4K monitor is extremely large the pixel density will be higher then on your 1920 x 1080 pixel display.\nYou can check compatibility on Using 4K displays, 5K displays, and Ultra HD TVs with your Mac.\nIn your case, your Late 2013 MacBook Pro 15\" supports 4K displays. However you also have to use a cable that supports the resolution accordingly.

Is there a simple way to paste these files into multiple destinations at once? It could also be an Automator flow or Terminal command.\n\nA: 1 - Open Automator and create a new Service:\n\n\n2 - Set the Service to receive Files and Folder in Finder:\n\n\n3 - Drag an \"Ask for Finder Items\" action:\n\n\n4 - Drag a \"Run AppleScript\" action:\n\n\n5 - Paste this code:\n\n\non run {input}\n    set numItems to count input\n    set theFile to item (numItems) of input as text\n    set numItems to numItems - 1\n    repeat while numItems is not 0\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            duplicate file theFile to folder (item (numItems) of input as text) with replacing\n            set numItems to numItems - 1\n            delay 0.1\n        end tell\n    end repeat\n    display dialog \"File copied to all folders\" buttons {\"Thanks\"} giving up after 5\nend run\n\n\n\n6 - Save your workflow and name it as you want:\n\n\n7 - USAGE:\nSelect as many folders as you want, right click, services, find your workflow:\n\nSelect the file you want to copy (beware the window can be hidden behind the main one):\n\nClick \"Choose\" and wait for the copy.\n\nPS: the file will replace existing ones with the same name.\n\nA: As requested, here's a workable solution as we've discussed in the comments thread.  Currently, the situation is that you have multiple files on the clipboard that need to be pasted into multiple destination folders.  These destination folders are all called \"CSS\" and reside inside a set of parents folders (names ending \"_11\") that you are able to select en masse.\nAfter doing that, you can run the following Automator service, either from the right-click context menu and selecting it under Services (or the Mojave equivalent); or by assigning it a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences, and triggering the service with the press of a hotkey.\nThe Automator service in question looks like this:\n\nThe AppleScript code used in the Run AppleScript action is below.  The AppleScript reads the list of files contained on the clipboard; isolates the \"CSS\" subfolders in each of the selected parent folders that were passed into the service (the \"CSS\" folder is created if it doesn't already exist); and then duplicates the files from the clipboard into the \"CSS\" directories.\nIf the clipboard does not contain any files, you'll hear a beep and no further action is taken.\nuse framework \"AppKit\"\n\nproperty this : a reference to current application\nproperty NSPasteboard : a reference to NSPasteboard of this\nproperty NSURL : a reference to NSURL of this\n\n\non run {input, parameters}\n    set pb to NSPasteboard's generalPasteboard()\n    set fs to (pb's readObjectsForClasses:[NSURL] options:[]) as list\n\n    using terms from scripting additions\n        -- No files on clipboard, nothing to do\n        if fs = {} then return beep\n    end using terms from\n\n    tell application \"Finder\" to repeat with f in the input\n        set css to (a reference to the folder named \"CSS\" in folder f)\n        if not (exists css) then make new folder at f with properties ¬\n            {name:\"CSS\"}\n\n        duplicate fs to css with replacing\n    end repeat\nend run\n\n", "Q: Are there any steps I can take to make macOS use more of my RAM? Last weekend, I upgraded my machine to have 32 GB of RAM. I knew I didn't really need this much memory, but I figured macOS would use it for file caching or some such.\n\nAccording to Activity Monitor, around 13 GB of memory are being used by applications, around 6 GB are being used for caching, and a whopping 13 GB are just being left idle. These numbers vary a bit depending on time and current workload, but in general, macOS consistently fails to use more than around 20 GB of memory.\nAre there any steps I can take to make macOS utilize my additional memory? For example, it would be great if I could make macOS cache files more aggressively, to offset my computer's relatively slow SSD.\n\nA: macOS will by default aggressively cache files, etc. in memory. In your case, it seems your programs simply aren't loading in that much data - and then there's really nothing more to cache.\nIf you keep the system running longer and look at the values again, you'll most probably see that the numbers have changed so that less memory is left idle.\nYou can selectively use more memory by adding a RAM disk to the system. I.e. a virtual \"disk\" that is really in RAM. You could then copy files to that disk to ensure that they stay in RAM. It is hugely impractical for ordinary desktop usage.\n", "Q: Music app on iphone resets track to start after a while I'm listening to some audio lectures on my iPhone. I've noticed that after leaving a track paused for a while it will reset to the start of the track. For instance, I'll listen on the way in to work in the morning and when I go home in the evening the track is back to the start. I haven't listened to anything in between. It's annoying since these lectures are 30 - 40 minutes long and I have to note where I paused it to resume.\nIs there a setting I need to change or an alternative app that maintains position when left paused?\n\nA: According to this:\n\nI contacted Apple about this bug. It is not a bug. It is a deliberate\n  UX decision of a fascist UX designer. Restarting songs should be the\n  user's decision. Clearly somebody at Apple does not understand that UX\n  is all about the behavior of the end user. This makes me very angry.\n  Anger is the result of failed UX design. Clearly I could always\n  restart songs of I wanted to with the back button. I now have\n  absolutely no way to continue listening to music where I left off.\n  This decision fixed nothing. Sadly its only one of many many decisions\n  since 2008 that flies in the face of well thought out UX design in the\n  pursuit of \"features\".\n\n", "Q: Why does correctly logging in take less time than an incorrect try? I entered a wrong password on my lockscreen today, and saw it took around 1-2 seconds for it to shake and prompt for a retry. However, if I enter the password correct, it takes fractions of a second to verify. Is there a reason for this? Shouldn't an equality check take the same time regardless of what was entered?\n\nA: It is not the actual password check that takes the time. An equality check (which is not what is done here) takes <1 millisecond on a modern computer, so it's not something you can experience.\nThe delay is actually introduced by purpose by Apple programmers, so that an incorrect attempts results in this slight delay. It is an intentional delay which is purposefully inserted.\nThe reason for having the delay could be to alert the user that the password entered is incorrect, and to \"pause for second\" and try again with more precision. This way the user cannot quickly type lots of differents things, but will have to wait a bit between each attempt.\n", "Q: How can I uncompress a tar.xz thats been compressed on ubuntu and uncompress it on mac with the archive utility?

When I originally downloaded the Install macOS Mojave.app for the original release 14.0.22, I got a 6.03 gig file.\nToday I replaced that file by downloading the installer fresh from the App Store for 14.1.0. The app is only 22 megs! So obviously this is just a shell that I imagine downloads the needed content over the internet at runtime.\nBut I need an offline installer, for clean-installs on various Macs and for creating virtual machines. \n➥ How to obtain fully-loaded offline installer app for Mojave 14.1.x?\nWhat about just using the original installer, then updating immediately the newly installed OS to .1? That .1 update was a whopper, over 3 gigs! I really want to avoid repeating that updater download. I really need a fully-loaded offline installer. \n\n\nA: The 22 MB \"stub\" installer is downloaded when your Mac is having trouble getting the correct data from Apple's software update catalogs. This is quote common during the first 24 hours or so, as it takes a little while for the updates to propagate across the CDNs. The solution in this case is to delete the stub, wait a couple of hours, and then try again.\nThere is also a useful script by Greg Neagle that lets you inspect which installers are available in your update catalogs, and can download them for you: installinstallmacos.py\nPS: If you have a Mac managed by an organization, you may also get the stub installer if your administrator hasn't approved the new update, e.g. with Reposado.\n\nA: You can easily download the full 14.1.0 installer using this tool: macOS Mojave Patcher Tool.\nStart the tool, and then go to Tools > Download macOS Mojave... and select a download location.\n\nAfter the download is complete, it will ask you if you want to create a patched usb installer, simply click Not Now as you don't need a patch (except if you want to install on a very old mac).\nYou can safely quit and remove the tool, as you no longer need it.\nHere you are:\n\n", "Q: How can I make my iOS app \"Sold Out\"? I have an app available on the App Store and regardless of the reason, I want it to be \"Sold out\" for the next month while still having the ability to release updates.\nIs this possible and if yes, what’s the best way to go about this?\nI am considering changing the price of the app to the max tier and writing \"Sold out, restocking on xx.xx.xxxx\" in the promotional text.\n\nA: \nI want it to be \"Sold out\" for the next month while still having the ability to release updates.\n\nThere is no such provision available on the App Store, hosting the app while users can’t purchase/install it. Most likely explanation would be that it interferes with the overall UX and has the potential of causing confusion.\n\nI am considering changing the price of the app to the max tier and writing \"Sold out, restocking on xx.xx.xxxx\" in the promotional text.\n\nHiking the price temporarily would not be an advisable approach. It will likely bring negative publicity to the app. This approach (especially with regard to the promotional text) could also cause the app update to get rejected.\nIf you would like to control when the app update gets released on the App Store, you can choose to manually release instead of automatically release when approved when submitting the app update.\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually release a version - App Store Connect Help\n\nA: Since you won't say why you want to do this, I must assume you are running a cloud service that has reached its capacity. Congratulations on your newfound popularity!\nWhile you work on improving your backend, I recommend that you write some logic into your app that will show the user a friendly specialized screen whenever your servers are at- or over-capacity, letting them know that they did nothing wrong and your service will be back soon. This way, they already have the app installed and can instantly start using it when you eventually get the problem solved.\nThis is better than saying \"Sold Out\" or \"Out of Stock\" on the App Store page. What does that imply? Does it mean that there was only ever a limited number, so no one else will ever get any? Does it mean the potential user should check back later? What if they forget to check back once you're back up and running?\n\nA: Apple doesn't support having an app appear in the app store unless it's available for download. \"Sold out\" or other terms meaning \"it's listed but you can't get it right now\" are not possible.\nYou could remove the app from sale but still release updates. In the \"territories\" section of App Store Connect, un-check every territory. That will remove it from sale and prevent it from appearing in the app store. However you can still update the app, and current users can still get updates.\nBut what it comes down to is, if you don't want people to download the app, you can't also have it appear in the store.\n\nA: You probably don't have enough control over your app once it's in the AppStore.  Compare with, say,  Disney, which can simply turn off access to their streaming & download servers if they want to stop selling digital copies of a movie.  \nSince I doubt you want to pull your app off the AppStore and then re-submit it later on, you are pretty much stuck with Nimesh's suggestion. \n", "Q: USB boot on mid 2010 Intel Mac mini I have a mid 2010 Mac mini.

Their support document speaks only to the latter.\nThat said, I have never seen the compressed memory for an individual process be more than the process, but I have seen it be exactly equal to the memory of a process. This suggests to me that compressed memory is telling you how much of the total memory of an app is compressed. Otherwise I'd expect there to be at least some cases where a process that was mostly dormant might have more total compressed memory than uncompressed.\nHowever the amount of total compressed memory is considered an addition to the total app memory when calculating the total memory used categories on the Memory tab. \n", "Q: macOS High Sierra: still usable as a development environment? I have a late 2011 MacBook Pro and I am about to invest in some hardware for this lovely piece. With the new macOS release this year, my MacBook won't get an update to Mojave.\nMy question is: How fatal is this for me as a user/developer? Can I expect to work with high sierra? Or will future tools and SDK only be released for the latest macOS (in this case Mojave)? \nI don't know the policy of Apple. So if some experienced users could give me some information about how Apple treats \"old\" MacBook, this would be nice. \n\nA: This is not a critical problem. You should be able to continue developing on your MacBook Pro for a year or two yet.\niOS Development\nFor iOS development, so long as Xcode supports your operating system, there is no problem. Do check the iOS SDKs supported by Xcode in case you need to work with specific features.\nmacOS Testing\nYou will be able to continue developing applications that target macOS 10.13 and below. Building for macOS 10.14+ is possible but testing will be a problem.\nSome features, such as Dark Mode/Appearance support, will be difficult to implement correctly. Implementing support does not require the developer run macOS 10.14, but they should be able to borrow or test on a Mac running macOS 10.14.\nApp Store Submissions\nYou will continue to be able to submit applications to Apple's App Stores. Historically, Apple have not restricted what tools or versions are used to build applications they accept.\nFuture\nBe aware that Apple previewed an iOS on macOS framework at WWDC 2018. This suggests significant changes are coming to at least the Mac platform. You may want to wait until more is known, before investing too much in a new Mac.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt 3 to Ethernet adapter I have just ordered one of the new Nov 2018 MacBook Airs that only come with Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports. Just looking for a simple clean solution for a high performance adapter using the USB-C physical connector.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am aware of the many USB-C to gigabit ethernet adapters that exist -- but I am looking for an adapter that takes advantage of Thunderbolt 3, the lower latency, and lower overheads. For example, on my old MacBook Air (2014), I use a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter ---> NOT a USB to Ethernet adapter.\n\n*I am aware I can buy a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt adapter, and then plug in my Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter ... but I don't want a double dongle. Who does?\nDoes there exist a Thunderbolt 3 to Gigabit ethernet adapter?\n(n.b. the rest of this should be made into an answer and edited out including this editor's note...)\nNote on the USB-C to Ethernet that Apple sells (Belkin)\nIf you read the reviews on the USB-C to Ethernet adapter that Apple officially sells (made by Belkin), there are a number of reviews that suggest that speed is throttled by using the USB-C adapter (compared to Thunderbolt).\nA review by Elias A states:\n\n\"Compared the old macbook dongel that has thunderbolt with this one. Got close to 1000Mbits. With this Belkin USB-C dongel I get around 200-300 Mbits\" \n\nA review by William S states:\n\nNot really gigabit\n  This adapter is only recognized as a 100BaseTX, even if you try to set it manually. Returned it and bought a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 adapter since I already had an old Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter from Apple. This combo may not be elegant, but it gives me full gigabit speed\n\nIt is these reviews that prompted my question. There are other reviews that note that Thunderbolt also involves lower system resources than USB-C.\nUpdate after buying Belkin USB-C to gigabit Ethernet adaptor\nBased on one of the answers below, I unfortunately purchased the Belkin USB-C to gigabit ethernet adaptor ... and report below some comparison timings which reflect very poorly on the product.\nIn the following tests, I compare the speed to transfer, on the same Cat6 ethernet network, over the same cables, through the same routers:\n\n\n*\n\n*2014 Macbook Air:  using Apple Thunderbolt to Ethernet adaptor\n\n*2018 Macbook Air Retina:  using Belkin USB-C (plugged into Thunderbolt 3 port) to Ethernet adaptor \n\n\nTest 1:  3.8GB file\n\n\n*\n\n*2014 Mac - Apple Thunderbolt adaptor:  35 seconds\n\n*2018 Mac - Belkin USB-C:  110 seconds. (Repeat tests returned 35 secs)\n\n\nTest 2:  9.6 GB folder (with many files)\n\n\n*\n\n*2014 Mac - Apple Thunderbolt adaptor:  5 min 50 seconds\n\n*2018 Mac - Belkin USB-C:  6 min 45 seconds\n\n\nTest 3:  4 GB movie\n\n\n*\n\n*2014 Mac - Apple Thunderbolt adaptor:  63 seconds\n\n*2018 Mac - Belkin USB-C:  87 seconds\n\n\nThe Belkin adaptor also got very very hot, and smelled burnt. I cannot explain the wildly variable results from the Belkin product either. An adaptor that returns worse results on a much faster 2018 Macbook Air (using USB-C) than Apple's own Thunderbolt adaptor on the 2014 Macbook Air frankly beggars belief. Whether the fault is the Belkin unit (of which there are many complaints on the Apple store site) or some inferior aspect of using USB-C compared to Thunderbolt ... I cannot say. \nI will be returning the Belkin unit to the Apple store for a full refund: the product or technology is plainly inferior to what was available 4 years ago.\n\nA: The ridiculous answer to your question is: buy the Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Ethernet adapter AND the Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter and daisy chain them.\nAs far as I can tell, that is currently the only way to get your ethernet to show up as Thunderbolt on the newer MacBook Pros.\n\nA: We use the Belkin USB-C on all our thunderbolt 3 Macs and get speeds far in excess of the review people. I would expect they either got a bad adapter (it happens - even the best hardware companies can't ship every product perfect - that's what warranty support and service are for - to fix that).\nWe've never had a case where we needed to get a more expensive 10 GB adapter in our experience. We also get 500 to 700 MBps from the MacBook which only does USB with the Belkin adapter. \nI would get those until you have a specific case you can't fix with networking checks and quality switches rather than spend more on an exotic combination of 10 GB adapters that run $200+ from the good vendors:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.sonnetstore.com/collections/thunderbolt-10gbe-adapters/products/solo-10g\n\n*https://www.sonnetstore.com/collections/thunderbolt-10gbe-adapters/products/twin-10g-thunderbolt3-edition\nSonnet's Thunderbolt 2 adapters do very well in our high bandwidth use cases - MacPro serving files or accessing a SAN as do their thunderbolt to SFP adapters. They are pro supported and designed gear for always on use. We rarely if ever need to put them in a design studio or for ProSumer use, but if you have the funds, these are fun adapters that really work well.\nFor 95% of our use cases - the Belkin is the adapter to choose.\n\nA: The only Thunderbolt 3 Ethernet adapters I'm aware of are either part of TB3 docks or really bulky 10GigE Ethernet adapters.\nA USB-C GigE adapter will do just fine. I got one by Aukey for about 10€ which works pretty much just like the TB2 Ethernet adapter from Apple (it even looks the same). Same speed (100+ MB/sek realworld speed to my NAS), no latency or overhead issues.\n\nA: Thunderbolt 1 supports 10GB symmetric (10GB each way), Thunderbolt 2 is 20GB symmetric, and Thunderbolt 3 is 40GB symmetric.  USB-C on Macs support USB3.1, which supports 10GB symmetric. \nFor Ethernet, nearly all  devices now support Gigabit Ethernet at most, which is 1GB. 10GB Ethernet is, as expected, 10GB, though few devices support this, and even fewer homes or even businesses have it. \nEven the fastest Ethernet, 10GB, is easily supported by USB-C, so offering a Thunderbolt 3 to Ethernet adapter serves no benefit. For this reason, most such adapters are USB-C, which does support the full speed of Ethernet. Note that if you were to extend Thunderbolt using a Thunderbolt cable in order to reach say, your router, Thunderbolt is limited to cable lengths of half a meter, after which speed slows. (Thunderbolt cables are probably too expensive to even consider this option.)\nSimply purchase the Belkin USB-C to Ethernet adapter and enjoy your highspeed Ethernet. \n", "Q: OS 10.14 stop console from scrolling It seems that since the new update, console will not stop scrolling.

Not all programs and not even all command line utilities respect the same common environment space.\nOn OS X - the launch daemon has been around and it spins up a sandboxed / isolated state for each app and each process, so you would edit into the preference / database entry for each process the variables it needs.\nThe current implementation would be to make a defaults write to write whatever values you want to your \"global environment\" and than have each program read those preferences as part of their startup or refresh script.\nI would encourage you to ask a follow on question since no one really wants to sign variables, they want to write variables so some programs can do something with them. Let's dive into what one or three programs would read what specific variable to do some thing and explore if you are stuck with making a modification to each one or could set up some sort of shared database or call to make those changes effective.\n", "Q: script works in Script Editor but not as app (MacOS Mojave) The following Script works as expected in Script Editor:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set nord to menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of application process \"NordVPN IKE\"\n    ignoring application responses\n        click nord\n    end ignoring\nend tell\ndo shell script \"killall System\\\\ Events\"\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set nord to menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of application process \"NordVPN IKE\"\n    tell menu 1 of nord\n        if exists menu item \"Disconnect\" then\n            click menu item \"Disconnect\"\n        else\n            click menu item \"Connect\"\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nWhen I export it to a .app and double click on it to execute, I get the following error:\n\nCan’t get «class menE» 1 of «class mbri» 1 of «class mbar» 2 of «class pcap» \"NordVPN IKE\" of application \"System Events\".

I am looking to change a file association on the Mac using some sort of script. I know that I can do something like that in Windows using the assoc command.\nIs there something scriptable on macOS which will do a similar job? I don’t mind whether it’s in Bash (my preference), AppleScript or something in Automator.\nI am aware of the dutil command but I want to be able to do it without additional software.\n\nA: Changing the file association for a single file or a set of files (AppleScript)\nThis script demonstrates first that the default application for some text file on my system was set to TextEdit.  Then it changes the file association for that particular file so it now opens with Atom.  Finally, it associates all text files on the desktop with the Atom application.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    get the default application of the file \"/path/to/some file.txt\"\n        --> alias \"Macintosh HD:Applications:TextEdit.app:\" of application \"System Events\"\n\n    # Individual file:\n    set the default application of the file \"/path/to/some file.txt\" to ¬\n        the path to the application named \"Atom\"\n\n    # A set of files:\n    set the default application of every file of the desktop folder whose ¬\n        name extension = \"txt\" to the path to the application \"Atom\"\nend tell\n\nChanging the file associations for all files of a given type (JXA)\nUsing JavaScript for Automation, you can implement Core Foundation functions in a way you cannot do with AppleScriptObjC, so as to interact with Launch Services at the system level and change the file association for a given file type.\nHere, I've targetted plain text files (these have extension .txt by default), and switched the default application that responds to them to Atom:\nObjC.import('CoreServices');\n\nvar contentType = 'public.plain-text';\nvar bundleID = Application('Atom').id();\n\n$.LSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType(\n            contentType, \n            $.kLSRolesAll, \n            bundleID\n        );\n\nThe file type must be targeted by way of a Uniform Type Identifier.  These are special text strings that uniquely identify a given class or type of item.  The link will take you to a page that lists Apple's system-declared UTIs for all the likely file types that you'll be interested in.  Be careful not to simply choose the one that appears to match your needs at first glance, as UTIs are structured in a kind of inheritance tree.  Therefore, I could have lazily picked out public.text, which I saw first in the list, until on further reading, we learn that this UTI is a base type for all text, which would include HTML and RTF files.\n\nA: No direct equivalent to assoc exists. Apple file mapping is implemented very differently than Windows. The file metadata has many variables that affect launch services and mapping a particular file to a particular app can involve several factors.\nThe macOS system uses a Launch Services database to map file types and secondarily, file extensions to applications that open them, the closest analog to assoc would be lsregister - a utility that exposes the database and API to the command line.\nIt's buried away inside the system folder, Core Services, framework that contains the LaunchServices.\nThere are tons of good questions and answers here once you know the utility to search for as are there tons of excellent blog posts, developer guides and official documentation.\nSince I have /usr/local/bin in my path, I usually sym link it there so I can host type it:\nmac:~ me$ ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister  /usr/local/bin\nmac:~ me$ lsregister\nlsregister: [OPTIONS] [ <path>... ]\n                      [ -apps <domain>[,domain]... ]\n                      [ -libs <domain>[,domain]... ]\n                      [ -all  <domain>[,domain]... ]\n\nPaths are searched for applications to register with the Launch Service database.\nValid domains are \"system\", \"local\", \"network\" and \"user\".

Rebooting still produces a prohibitory symbol.  I’m still able to boot into recovery mode (command-R at startup), however running disk repair on my MacBook HD does NOT solve the problem.  I have also tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*specifying the startup disk (problem still persists); \n\n*attempting to start in safe mode (problem persists); \n\n*doing the NVRAM reset (problem persists).  \n\n\nIn the past, the only way I was able to get around the problem, is by re-formatting my HD, installing latest version of Mojave OS, and then migrating all my data from my Time Machine backup.  \nThis happened again the other day with the recent Mojave 10.14.2 update.\nMy computer automatically installed the update overnight, and in the morning, my screen was showing circle slash.  This time I did some more research, and discovered that the issue may be caused by unsigned kernel extension (KEXT) files existing on my HD.\nKernel Extensions are pieces of code that extends the capability of the base kernel of an operating system. The kernel typically manages Input / Output (I/O) requests, and in macOS the file ends in .kext.\nStarting with Yosemite, kernel extensions must be code-signed by the developer with Apple authorization or macOS won’t load them. Sometimes these un-signed kernel extensions cause this headache after a macOS update.\nUsing terminal command in Recovery Mode, you should be able to resolve this problem by removing unsigned kext extensions from location:/Volumes/<your system's drive name>/Library/Extensions/ [not to be confused with /System/Library/Extensions/].\nAfter I removed the following KEXT files from the /Volumes/<your system's drive name>/Library/Extensions/ directory, my MacBook booted up properly, and finished installing the Mojave update:\n\n\n*\n\n*BJUSBLoad.kext (Creator: Canon)\n\n*CIJUSBLoad.kext (Creator: Canon)\n\n*ParagonSnapshot.kext (Creator: Paragon)\n\n*ufsd_NTFS.kext (Creator: Paragon)\n\n*VDMounter.kext (Creator: Paragon)\n\n*LittleSnitch.kext (Creator: LittleSnitch)\n\n\nFURTHER DETAILS: \nThis article (MacBook Will Not Start Up After macOS Update, How-To Fix)\nprovides some helpful information regarding: \nIn that article, the section titled “Un-Assigned Kernel Misfiring” explains how to boot into Recovery Mode and launch Terminal utility.  However, one problem with that article is that the kextstat command is not available in Terminal utility running in Recovery Mode.\nAs a work-around, these are the steps I took to solve the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Recovery (with command-R or command-shift-R if you don't have recovery partition)\n\n*First, pick Disk Utility, select your main disk and Mount it; this is required if your disk is encrypted and requires a password to be mounted\n\n*Now select Disk Utility -> Quit; then Utilities -> Terminal\n\n*Begin typing in Terminal following commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /Volumes/\n\n*cd <your system's drive name>\n(Note: If your system drive has any spaces in it’s name, then put the name in single quotes.  For example, my MacBook boot drive is called “MacBook HD”, so the command I would type is: cd ‘MacBook HD’\n\n*cd library\n\n*cd extensions\n\n*cd ls (Note: first letter is a lower case L)\n\n\n\nAfter you type ‘ls’, you should see a list of KEXT extensions like this:\nACS6x.kext                CIJUSBLoad.kext\nATTOCelerityFC8.kext      CalDigitHDProDrv.kext\nATTOExpressSASHBA2.kext   HighPointIOP.kext\nATTOExpressSASRAID2.kext  HighPointRR.kext\nArcMSR.kext               PromiseSTEX.kext\nBJUSBLoad.kext            SoftRAID.kext\n\nThe KEXT extensions listed above are all ones properly signed by Apple.\nThese KEXT extensions can remain, but if you have other KEXT extensions listed, chances are that some or all of those others are causing the issue.\nIf you see any of these extensions (listed below), you should be able to safely delete them in order to fix your problem.  I’d recommend removing each extension, one at a time, then rebooting to see if it worked, and if not, repeat steps above and delete next one.  Based on my limited research, the ones I’d recommend deleting first are:\n\n\n*\n\n*ParagonSnapshot.kext (Creator: Paragon)\n\n*VDMounter.kext (Creator: Paragon)\n\n*LittleSnitch.kext (Creator: LittleSnitch)\n\n*ufsd_NTFS.kext (Creator: Paragon)\n\n\nWhile in Terminal (in Recovery mode), to delete (or remove) a desired KEXT extension (eg., LittleSnitch.kext) type:\nrm -r <full name of extension>\n\n(eg, rm -r LittleSnitch.kext)\nOnce complete, quit Terminal and restart your Mac.\n", "Q: Is Apple ID still considered as linked with my MacBook if I totally reinstall my Mackbook but use another Apple ID?

Authentication can be done with certificates, EAP (for username/passsword authentication, but includes EAP-TLS, which uses certificates) or preshared keys (PSK). The actual traffic is transported via IPsec in tunnel mode, UDP encapsulated if there is a NAT between client and server. It's the most modern, stable and flexible of these options (among other reasons due to traffic selector narrowing, split-tunnling/DNS, MOBIKE and better rekeying behavior).\n\n*IPsec: Basically the same as above but uses the old version of the IKE protocol (IKEv1). It offers similar authentication options (certificates, username/password via XAuth, hybrid XAuth, PSK) including the unsafe XAuth/PSK in aggressive mode. Traffic is also transported via IPsec in tunnel mode.\n\n*L2TP: This is similar to IPsec in that it also uses IKEv1 to establish an IPsec connection, which is then used to create an L2TP tunnel. Traffic is encapsulated in L2TP and then IPsec, which is usually negotiated in transport mode to avoid additional overhead. For more on the difference between L2TP and plain IPsec see my response to a question on superuser.com.\n\n", "Q: VMware Fusion: Command + Tab window switching not focusing *inside* virtual machine I'm a \"keyboard-oriented\" user. I normally switches between applications via Command+Tab combo. I noticed the following issue when working with a Linux guest (steps to reproduce):\n\n\n*\n\n*Run a Linux VM in Single Window mode.\n\n*Switch focus to another Mac application window such as Chrome browser.\n\n*Switch focus back to the VM via Command+Tab.\nAt the point, it looks like the VM has been focused, but it seems actually only the VM window is focused, but not the running VM itself. I'm saying this because at this point:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command+H combo still hides the VM window. It's not sent inside the VM itself. Note I have unchecked the shortcut in \"Keyboard & Mouse > some_profile > Edit Profile > Keyboard & Mouse > Fusion Shortcuts > Hide Application\".\n\n*Command+M combo still minimizes the VM window, having unchecked the relevant shortcut as above.\n\n*Typing \"Space\" key is not sent in the VM.\n\n*Not until typing some \"normal\" keys, such like alphanumeric keys, does the focus actually move inside the VM itself.\nThis focusing issue does not happen when the VM window body is focused by mouse pointer. Actually it does happen if the window is focused by explicitly clicking VM window title bar, but not the window body.\nIs this a bug or what config change is needed (e.g., keyboard settings)? Essentially, what I want is Command+Tab able to switch right inside the VM, but not at the VM window.\n\nA: While I work from a Windows host to a Linux VM, I found the same issue.\nThe solution that VMWare offers is the key Ctrl + G.\nOn a Mac I'm assuming that would be Option + G.\nOnce my VMWare window has focus, pressing Ctrl + G will allow me to start using keyboard commands in the VM.\nYour procedure would become pressing Command + Tab, then Option + G\nSource:\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/howto/vmware/keyboard-shortcuts-for-vmware-workstation/\nHope it helps!\n\nA: I'm a keyboard user as well and I had this same exact problem. I don't have a perfect fix, e.g. a setting you can change. However, I do have a pretty good workaround.\nAfter switching to the desktop with your Windows VM by using your keyboard shortcut, just hit an extra arrow key. For me, I type \"command-control-right\" to get to the space to the right, then I let up the \"command-control\" and just type \"right\". From there, I can type \"command\" to bring up the Windows start menu.\nThis seems to work regardless of what application is in the foreground on the Windows VM. The main problem with this technique (other than the extra keypress) is that it does send an \"arrow\" event to the foreground application. For me, that's usually pretty harmless. Like I said, it's not perfect.\nHTH.\n", "Q: How can I make iPod 30-Pin cables last longer? I am still using an iPod that has a 30-pin connector. \nI find the cables only last for 2-3 years before they start to fray and stop working.\nI am buying a new cable and would like to know if there any tips to make it last longer.\nI've never had any problems with any other type of cable. Some of my micro USB cables get used way more and are nearly 10 years old. It only seems to be the iPod cables that fray. \n \n\nA: The answer to the question comes down to how the cables are treated over their life time.  This applies to pretty much all cables regardless of the manufacturer or type (USB, network, charging/power, etc.).  It's also important to note that Apple used a higher quality, more flexible cable (it feels softer and thusly, more premium in the hand).  The downside, it's not as durable the cheaper, more \"plastic-y\" cables.\nCoil your cables\nThe cable will have a natural \"loop\" to it and if you coil it following that loop you will preserve it for years to come.\n\n*\n\n*Follow the natural loop and coil your cables so that there's no strain on the adapter ends\n\n\n*Do not bunch them up in a tightly wound loop and don't \"fold\" them over.\n\n\n*Most importantly, never knot your cable into itself - it's not rope.\n\nThe photos above are of my actual genuine Apple 30 pin cable that must be pushing at least 10 years of age.  The top photo is the exact way that I store my cables even when traveling.\nFor reference, this is the exact same way I coil my cable on my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet that I keep in my briefcase.\n\nUse strain relief where possible\n\n*\n\n*Tie-wrap your cables in a bunch to prevent excessive strain being applied to the connector ends\n\n\n*Use cable management gadgets to prevent the cables from going over sharp edges\n\n\n*Use \"service loops\" judicially when routing cables behind a desk or furniture.  Loosely coiling the wire and loosely wrapping them with Velcro or plastic will allow for movement without binding on the connectors.\n\nI've followed these practices for the better part of 20+ years (obviously not with just Apple cables) and can honestly say that I have a significantly greater likelihood of replacing a cable because I lost it versus it becoming damaged.\n", "Q: Launch AppleScript when bluetooth device is disconnected Spotify continues playing on my Mac when my bluetooth headphones are disconnected (when they go out of range or lose battery for example).

So, what you can do:\n\n*\n\n*Use DisplayPort cable and USB-C to DisplayPort adapter instead of HDMI (if your display has a DisplayPort socket)\n\n*Plug you USB-C to HDMI adapter into a USB-C socket at the other side of your MacBook (if your MacBook has such a socket on the other side)\n\n*Wrap your USB-C to HDMI adapter with tin foil, and then with isolation tape (in case there is a cable segment between the adapter and the USB-C plug)\n\nI personally used the third option and if works fine for me.\n", "Q: Unfamiliar prompt when inserting new prepaid SIM card into iPhone in China While visiting Shenzhen, China yesterday as a tourist I acquired a prepaid +86 SIM card from China Unicom. Everything seemed to work out fine, but I am wondering about one observation:\nWhen the sales clerk inserted the new SIM card for the first time the iPhone brought up a full-screen prompt with (if memory serves) a two-line text in Chinese on dark background and apparent \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons. He pressed \"OK\" before I could take the phone back and that was it. This was at an official China Unicom store and the transaction seemed professional and legitimate.\nWhat could that prompt have been? I don't remember this exact behavior from my iPhone on previous occasions of inserting various SIM cards, but then how could a specific SIM card insert a proprietary user interface? I would normally have taken a screen shot at this point for further inquiry, but the process went to fast.\nSo my question is this: what might the prompt have been and is there reason to be concerned from a security perspective?\n\nA: I just have the sim card of China Unicom.\nThe text is \"尊敬的客户，欢迎您使用中国联通业务！\"\nWhich means \"Dear customers, welcome to use China Unicom business!\"\nI don't think there will be any security issues.\nIt is a sim application that can handle business（e.g. order data plan) with cellular data off.\nGo Setting-Moblie Data-SIM Application you can find more.\nI don’t know more technical aspects.You can see the wikiSIM Application Toolkit\n\n", "Q: MacOS Mojave Install - About 2 minutes remaining, for 2 hours I'm currently a new Mac user, I was given a newer iMac to test with High Sierra installed on it, I needed to install Mojave to use the app I need.\nIt seems to be stuck at 2 minutes remaining for the last 2 hours. When I look at the activity monitor, it has already received 97 gigabytes of data on the network tab, should I be worried?\n\n\n\nA: Turns out, something on our network, who knows why, was blocking some aspect of the OS update.

So proceed at your own risk. But honestly you don't have much choice. The system is likely hung on something that could never time-out.

My company doesn't want to dish out money to fix it, so I took it and installed Mac OS High Sierra on an external hard drive and booted from it. Everything works well even though there is some lag due to the USB connection.\nI'm unable to install Mojave update due to \"you may not install to this volume because it is missing a firmware partition\" error.

The EFI partition is only 200MB+, so in theory you could get away with installing a very small hard-drive internally and just stick the EFI partition there. Once Mojave's installed, you can move the EFI partition to a USB (probably needs to be placed before any other partitions).\nI use Linux/Gparted to change partitions for this purpose. You can do that entirely from e.g. the Ubuntu install USB without having to install Linux at all. You probably have an EFI partition somewhere on your USB drive, so simply copy it to an internal hard-drive. Since it's probably only 250MB, you can get such drives for extremely cheap off eBay if you don't have a drive lying around somewhere from an archaic machine.\n", "Q: MBP boots into recovery mode/Installation log showing error logs after restarting Yesterday I updated something through the MacBook Appstore. I really do not know what I was updating exactly. I only know it was in the AppStore. It could've been an update from High Sierra to Mojave.

So, assuming your ethernet connection is, indeed, called \"Ethernet 1\", then the command to turn your ethernet off looks like this:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    do shell script \"networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled \\\"Ethernet 1\\\" off\"\n\nreturn input end run\n\nIf you want to toggle it on/off depending on its current state, then you can do this:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    do shell script ¬\n        \"[[ \\\"$(networksetup -getnetworkserviceenabled 'Ethernet 1')\\\" = \\\"Enabled\\\" ]] \\\n         && networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled 'Ethernet 1' off \\\n         || networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled 'Ethernet 1' on\"\n\nend run\n\nBut, since your entire AppleScript is, in fact, a shell command wrapped inside a do shell script command, then I'd recommend using an Execute Shell Script action in your Automator workflow instead of an AppleScript one.  Then you can simply write the command out in its naked form, which is much more sensible:\n[[ \"$(networksetup -getnetworkserviceenabled 'Ethernet 1')\" = \"Enabled\" ]] \\\n&& networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled 'Ethernet 1' off \\\n|| networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled 'Ethernet 1' on\n\n", "Q: Increase the quality of the screen recorder in iOS I like the screen recorder in iOS 12, but I was hoping that it would get more frames per second.\nI don't see any settings screen.

I have 2 5th Gen Airport Extreme's and a 4th Gen Time Capsule. The 1st is connected directly to the modem. It is set to emit 2.4GHz, and a 5GHz connection. I have an ethernet cable running from the 1st to the 2nd in another room. The ethernet is connected to one of the router ports on the 1st and to the WAN port on the 2nd. Now, I have the Time Capsule, and 2 computers connected to the 2nd Airport's router ports.\nThe 2nd Airport ( Airport Link ) is set to bridge mode, but also set to extend a wireless network. It extends the 1st Airport's 2.4GHz connection and the 5GHz connection. I am having issues with the computers connected to the 2nd Airport ( Airport Link ).\nMy goal is to have the 2nd Airport act as essentially a switch, use the ethernet connection of the 1st Airport for computers connected to the 2nd Airport ( Airport Link ), via ethernet. Also have the 2nd Airport extend or amplify the WiFi connections for the 2nd half of the house where the 2nd Airport ( Airport Link ) is located, BUT I need to make sure that it's not extending the WiFi by connecting to the Wifi connection of the 1st Airport, but rather still using that original ethernet connection.\nDo I need to set the wireless on the 2nd Airport ( Airport Link ) in the options to \"Extend Wireless Network\", or to \"Create Wireless Network\" and name the WiFi the same names as what they have on the first Airport with the same passwords?\nI have Back To Mac enabled on the 1st Airport. Do I need to sign in and enable it on the 2nd Airport ( Airport Link ) since the computers are connected to this Airport base station via ethernet?\n\n\nA: SInce your second Airport is connected to the 1st one through an Ethernet cable, and if it isn't out of the normal length for an Ethernet cable I suggest you to choose this link only between your 2 access points (here Airport Extreme).\nI advise you to configure the second Airport as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*suppress the option \"Extend Wireless Network\",\n\n*configure it in \"bridge\" mode,\n\n*configure it to create a wireless network with the same name and password as the one on your 1st Airport, but with a 2.4 GHz channel chosen so as to be separated from the 1st one channel by 3 empty channels, for example:\n1st airport on channel 5, 2nd airport on channel 9 (this is a good practical example I am using to avoid the channels of my neighbours.\nFor 5 GHz channels just choose 2 differents ones (5 GHz channels don't overlap on each others as 2.4 GHz do).\nWith such a configuration you avoid to have 2 physical paths between your 2 AP which may cause flapping (packet 1 going path 1, packet 2 going path 2…) and loops (packet 1 going path 1, returned back on path 2…).\n", "Q: View contents of a ICO container file on macOS ICO file extension is a container file format that may include several icon images of different sizes.

Anyone has idea how to resolve this issue?\n\nA: The following observation indicates to a problem specifically for iPhones in contrast to e.g. iPad and maybe related to your problem.\nI had problems to convince my iPhone 6s to use the 5GHz band. iPad and iMac did it at once after I switched off the 2.4 GHz in the router. The iPhone would not connect, even after resetting the network settings. The trick I used (not my own idea) was to use two different SSIDs for 5GHz and 2.4Ghz. Even then it took two or three attempts, but now the iPhone connects to the 5GHz.\n\nA: The problem looks so strange as you say that phone got around 17Mbps at company. The best way I think would be to contact wifi provider. Also make sure that the wifi you are using is not set as something like metered connection in win 10.\n\nA: Most likely, your Internet connection is not related to any of this. Try doing a local speed test (between wifi device and, if possible wired device). A classical way to do that is to use iPerf (seems there's a $1 app for iOS), but you could try FTP, HTTP or any other, and see if you get more that 2.7 MBps. My bet: you won't. If you do, then try sharing wired connection from a wired computer over wifi, just to see if you have an issue with your router.\nOh, and just make sure you're connected on the 5 Ghz network.\n", "Q: How can I view a list of system and application keyboard shortcuts?

It also doesn't help for applications without a window (background apps).  This doesn't help my use case as the keybinding I am debugging doesn't launch an application window.  Think about how Spotlight or Alfred renders a search component for a given key combination.\n\nA: Try the utility CheatSheet. \nIt appears that after downloading the utility, press the Command key a little longer than usual and you are then presented with the currently active keyboard shortcuts. Check out the software below\n\nhttps://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/\n\nA: You can’t practically. Each potential app can change keybindings on demand and based on time, content, whimsy. So what you ask is for every arbitrary app developer to all agree to pre-document what functions they will code to change at runtime and ship and then have that documentation centralized in a machine datbase at the OS level (or at least collectively).\nThe best you can do is hope they don’t change and start cataloging items for the apps you care about most.

There are around a thousand photos there. It's currently in the cloud and not on my iPhone.\nI would like to create Vacation 2018 album on my iPhone's Photos app with the same pictures.\nWhat is the quickest way to do that? I looked through the Google Photos iPhone app and didn't see anything obvious.\n\nA: This is the quickest way that I know of to save photos from an album in Google Photos to an album in Photos app on iPhone. It involves a bit of grunt work, but I'll try to make the overall procedure quick and easy to follow.\nListing the steps one-by-one, so buckle up:\n\n\n*\n\n*As the first step, it is advisable to turn off Auto-Lock if enabled. This will prevent your iPhone from going into sleep mode automatically after a set time, thereby unintentionally suspending the Google Photos app.\nTo turn off Auto-Lock, go to Settings app → Display & Brightness → Auto-Lock and select Never.\n\n\n\n*Launch Google Photos app on your iPhone and tap to select the Albums tab in the bottom Tab bar. Locate the desired album under the Albums section. I am using an album named IKEA HYD for demonstration purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Tap on the album to reveal its contents. Now tap on the options button (three dots) shown towards the top right corner to reveal the context menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Tap on the Select item to switch to selection mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Once you are into selection mode, select the desired photos.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Selecting a large number of images could be quite cumbersome. But fret not, as you can greatly speed up the process by employing a neat trick built into iOS.\nOnce you are into selection mode, tap down to select an image. Now without lifting your finger, simply drag your finger in the direction of unselected images (i.e. towards the bottom of the grid of images). As your finger moves, the grid of images will automatically start scrolling, selecting the images encountered on the way. The further away you move your finger from the starting point, faster the selection will be. Motion picture linked below demonstrates the same.\n\n\n\n*Now, you have the desired images selected. Tap on the share button to reveal the share sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n*In the presented share sheet, tap on the Save \"count\" images button. This will start saving the selected images in the Photos app.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Note that it is important to keep the app running until all the images are saved in the device photo library (Photos app). Do not suspend the app by tapping on the Home button (or equivalent on iPhone X/XS/XR), thereby potentially stopping the image save process. We also turned off Auto-Lock in step #1 to ensure that the iPhone doesn't go into sleep mode unintentionally while Google Photos app is saving the images in the device photo library.\nWait till the save progress is complete.\n \n\n\n*Once all the images are successfully saved in the photo library, a confirmation message is shown by the Google Photos app towards the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now, head over to the iOS Photos app, tap on the Camera Roll button and select all the saved images. To select images, you'll first need to tap on the Select button shown towards the top right to switch into selection mode. You can use the same trick as discussed in step #6 to speed up the selection process as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Once all the desired images are selected, tap on the share button shown towards the bottom left.\n\n\n\n\n\n*In the presented share sheet, tap on Add to Album button.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Tap on New Album... button to create a new album.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Provide the desired name for the album and tap on Save.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Voila! your album is now ready on your iPhone. Tap on the album to view its contents as you normally would.\n\n\n \n\nNote: This album is created by manually saving the images from the Google Photos cloud storage using the Google Photos app. The content of the album will not automatically sync to and fro between album in the Photos app on iPhone and the album in Google Photos cloud library.\nAlso, don't forget to re-enable Auto-Lock (if you use it).\n", "Q: One key is not working anymore The 0 (zero) key on my Mac keyboard does not work anymore. Is there some kind of ascii code to type this character?\n\nA: You may need to connect a USB keyboard if you need to make a change or enter 0 as part of a password, but once you're logged in you can copy / paste the 0 and also enable the keyboard viewer in system preferences.\nThat lets you get a 0 from the pointer / mouse / trackpad\nAdditionally, you could shift your keyboard mapping to Dvorak (left or right) and use a different physical key until you decide to get it repaired or see if you're ok using unicode hex input method.\nWith the unicode hex keyboard, you hold down option and type hex (0030 for zero) instead of ascii code.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I type unicode characters without using the mouse?\nThe main problem with unicode entry is the 0 is used quite a lot, so you'll probably want to set up a shortcut to convert another character to 0 or get a bluetooth keyboard.\nTo make a shortcut, go to system preferences/keyboard/text/replace with.  To create a custom layout where 0 is on a working key, try Ukelele.\n", "Q: How do I stay logged in on Safari 12? Since upgrading to Safari 12, many sites that I could remain logged into for extended periods of time now aggressively log me out, often several times a day.

It's the same for every song on the album.\nEven when volume is lowish/medium, it sounds staticky as HELL on louder parts of the songs, and maybe sounds a bit like the signal is getting clipped, not sure.\nI have already reimported the album at a higher bit rate (320kbps VBR), to no avail.

Essentially, if you include the colon, whatever's after it (up to the \"@\") will be taken the password. But you have nothing after the colon, so you're explicitly specifying a blank password.\nAlso, the man page says you should never run mount_smbfs directly, but instead use mount -t smbfs.\nYou need to either include the password explicitly, like this:\nmount -t smbfs '//share;user:password@server.domain/share' /Volumes/share\n\nOr leave off both colon and password:\nmount -t smbfs '//share;user@server.domain/share' /Volumes/share\n\n...in which case it'll look for a password in ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf, and if it isn't there it'll prompt for one. I had thought that it could look in the keychain, but apparently it doesn't know how to do that. This means that there is no non-interactive, secure way to supply a password to mount_smbfs.\nDepending on the context this is running in, you might be able to use the open command instead:\nopen 'smb://share;user@server.domain/share'\n\nI think this'll need to be running in a user session, and doesn't give you control of the mount point (it'll be auto-created in /Volumes).\nOh, one other thing: the \"share;\" part of the URL specifies an authentication domain to find the user in. Is that part actually correct? If it is, the open command should work interactively.\n", "Q: Xcode 10 Broke Autocomplete When Inserting Include Names for C++, Any Workarounds?

The eventual goal is to run a more complex script under launchd to identify if a better networks is present and automate the change over.\nI've tried experimenting with networksetup -listnetworkserviceorder and networksetup -listallhardwareports but have had no luck.\nIn AppleScript or any other scripting language a way to measure two router's strength similar to what's visible on the menu bar's wifi signal? \n\nA: If your main priority is to have your Mac automatically switch to next strongest access point.....\nYour Mac can do that for you already.\nOf course you have to have set up both routers as Automatically Join and at the top of your list.\nThen tell it to roam and it will automatically connect to next stronger signal network.\nEven better is if your SSID and WPA are the same for both.\nTo turn the roaming on in case it was off do this in Terminal:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airport.opproam enabled -bool true\n\nThen set it up to automatically join next strongest access point\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport prefs joinMode=Strongest\n\nYou are done, now you can move around and your Mac will keep you connected to the strongest signal.\nMore reading material here \nAnd Apple explains it how it works \nIf you still prefer scripting this process here is the list of Airport commands /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport\n\nA: Here's a JavaScript for Automation (JXA) script that will scan for WiFi networks and retrieve the SSIDs and RSSI values:\nObjC.import('CoreWLAN');\nnil = $();\n\n(() => {\n\n    const defaultInterface = $.CWWiFiClient.sharedWiFiClient.interface;\n\n    if (!defaultInterface.powerOn) return false;\n\n    const networks = defaultInterface\n                    .scanForNetworksWithNameError(nil,nil)\n                    .allObjects;\n\n    const SSIDs = ObjC.deepUnwrap(networks.valueForKey('ssid'));\n    const RSSIValues = ObjC.deepUnwrap(networks.valueForKey('rssiValue'));\n\n    const WiFi = SSIDs.reduce((ξ, item, i)=>{ \n                    ξ[item] = RSSIValues[i];\n                    return ξ;\n               }, {})\n\n    var WiFiByStrength = {};\n    Object.keys(WiFi).sort((i,j)=>{ return WiFi[j] - WiFi[i]; })\n                     .map(key=>WiFiByStrength[key] = WiFi[key]);\n\n    return WiFiByStrength;\n\n})();\n\nIt presents the output of key-value pairs sorted by signal strength (RSSI) in order, starting with the strongest WiFi network signal first:\n{\"CK.net\":-38, \"NCC-1701-D\":-59, \"Peter's Wi-Fi Network\":-67, \n\"BTWifi-X\":-68, \"BTWifi-with-FON\":-68, \"BTHub4-WMJM\":-68}\n\nHere, the RSSI values are negative numbers, with a number closer to 0 (more positive) indicative of a stronger WiFi signal.\n\nA: Yes - both the current network and potential networks can be scripted from unix command line / shell so that extends to most automation languages - including AppleScript. I'd make your final program in python or swift, but here's how to start your process with signal strength.\nGetting the current connected network is easy and quick. The relevant entries for signal and noise are the raw radio values on the channel negotiated but it would be better to key off Transmit Rate since as long as you have faster than X network, it doesn't really matter what noise / signal since the transmit rate drops down when the signal drops or the noise raises.\nsystem_profiler SPAirPortDataType:\n       AC88U_5G:\n          PHY Mode: 802.11ac\n          BSSID: 54:36:9b:2d:78:e2\n          Channel: 149\n          Country Code: CN\n          Network Type: Infrastructure\n          Security: WPA2 Personal\n          Signal / Noise: -26 dBm / -81 dBm\n          Transmit Rate: 867\n          MCS Index: 9\n      Other Local Wi-Fi Networks:\n        AC88U:\n          PHY Mode: 802.11n\n          BSSID: 54:36:9b:2d:78:e1\n          Channel: 7\n          Country Code: CN\n          Network Type: Infrastructure\n          Security: WPA2 Personal\n          Signal / Noise: -18 dBm / 0 dBm\n\nScanning all possible radios and channels is quite slower (5 to 10 seconds instead of a fraction of a second to run) than the simple dump above, so you'd need a program to handle that or a script that's a lot more savvy. I'd start with airport --scan and filter for your preferred SSID or known MAC address on your base stations:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport --scan\n\nOnce you've scanned, the system_profiler should report more results as the scan results seem to be cached locally for a while.\nWiFi engineers perform this optimization all the time by controlling the MCS / Transmit rate. Simply choose all transmit rates you wish to evict all clients for your main radio and once they lose connection at the preferred high speeds, all OS will drop and then pick up the next radio that's available. Much easier than rolling out custom scripts to all the devices that connect to your two radios.\nAlso, it goes without saying - if you could make both radios broadcast on the same SSID - then your Apple products would just roam but maybe you have a good reason to not have the same network name and simplify your work.\nAnd to answer @nohillside question \"how to decide which Wi-Fi is stronger\" here are some guidelines.\n\n", "Q: Dual booting Mid 2012 Macbook Pro multiple SSDs Errors I have an old Mid-2012 Macbook Pro.

Another way you could do it is to enumerate the files in AppleScript instead:\nosascript<<EOF\n  use sys : application \"System Events\"\n  use Preview : application \"Preview\"\n\n  script\n    property list : displayed name of every file ¬\n                    in sys's folder \"$somedir\"\n  end script\n\n  repeat with f in result's list\n    tell Preview's document named f to if exists ¬\n    then close\n  end repeat\nEOF\n\nThis is almost instantaneous, and the displayed name property specifically uses the name as it's displayed in Finder, with or without its extension.  Therefore, it matches the name property of the Preview document.\n", "Q: Stop my Apple devices and PC desktop syncing Mozilla bookmarks I have a MacBook Air and iPhone 7. I have a Dell desktop at work, and for some reason my Firefox bookmarks from my work PC are showing up on my Apple devices and I would like to remove them. At work I use Firefox, IE, and Chrome. On my Apple devices I use Safari and Chrome. I assume iCloud might be the problem here. I am wondering if (since I use it on all three devices, it is somehow syncing them. The shortcuts from my Firefox toolbar show up in my favorites on my Apple devices, and the bookmarks from my Firefox bookmark menu show up in my Safari bookmarks folder.\n\nA: I assume you're talking about your Firefox bookmarks. If your bookmarks from work are showing up on your personal devices, then it's most likely because you're signed into your Firefox account on all your devices. \nIf you don't want to sync these devices with the same Firefox account, you should either create a different Firefox account for your personal devices, or not use a Firefox account at all for your personal devices.\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*on your MacBook Air launch Firefox and go to Firefox > Preferences > Firefox Account to view your account settings.\n\n*on your iPhone launch Firefox and go to Settings. At the very top you'll see your Firefox Account details.\n\n", "Q: Disable boot chime on late 2009 MacBook without macOS installed I would like to disable the boot/power-on chime on a late 2009 MacBook.

I am trying to connect the following to my 2018 MacBook Pro (15 inch):\n\n\n*\n\n*2 monitors (Dell U2715H, 2560 x 1440)\n\n*2 USB-3 peripherals (mouse, keyboard)\n\n\n... but I would like to connect only one cable to my MacBook so that I may effortlessly dock / undock the laptop from my workstation without having to unplug a bunch of wires. Or, some sort of physical dock the laptop slides in (ala the the Henge Dock, however I don't think it support 2 monitors / the 2018 MBP?)\nCan anyone give me some hardware tips/advice to connect the above peripherals to my MacBook with a single dock or cable?\n\nA: My employer just provided me with a 2017 MacBook Pro with the touchbar. I have a ThinkPad with 3 external monitors attached to it via a program called Ultramon. I also had a Logitech Keyboard and Mouse attached using the Logitech unifying receiver (wireless USB plug). \nI requested the 15\" MacBook Pro specifically because I wanted to be able to support up to 4 external monitors. I purchased a new Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse that will connect either Smart Bluetooth 4.0 or using the Logitech Unifying Receiver (USB 2.0). I purchased the new keyboard and mouse because they will support up to 3 separate devices simultaneously. \nAs I'm moving applications and files from the Windows ThinkPad to my MacBook I'm running both and just push the 1 or 2 button on the keyboard and mouse depending on which system I want to use the keyboard and mouse on. \nI've moved the ACER S200HQL 19.5 (1600 x 900) Radeon Pro 560 x 4096 MQ graphics display the external monitors over using an Apple USB-C to VGA Multiport Adapter USB-C dongle which has USB-C, VGA and USB-3 connectors on it. I plugged the USB-C connector into the MacBook and the USB-C connector of the power cord in the the USB-C outlet on the adapter. I plugged the ACER S200HQL VGA plug in the the VGA connector on the adapter.  \nIt was all very easy to do. I still have an available USB 3.0 port to plug in a USB HUB or other USB 2.0 or 3.0 device. The part number for the Apple USB-C to VGA Multiport Adapter is Model A1620. \nI still have to move the 2 DELL 24\" monitors but I have 1 very large application on the Windows ThinkPad that has a lot of corrupt files in it so I'm moving that app's files manually. Once that is done I'll move the other Monitors. It was extremely simple to do. \nLike you I want to be able to detach one cable and take the MacBook with me. I was looking at the Henge dock and may still purchase one. Here is a link I found when I decided to move the first monitor:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-multiple-displays-with-your-mac-mchl7c7ebe08/10.13/mac/10.13.5\nAdditional Comments: I already have a dock I purchased at Best Buy. It's not Henge. I plan to install it this weekend. Then I can answer your question completely.

I used to avoid this by enabling the \"Reduce Transparency\" option in System Preferences > Accessibility > Display.\nIn Mojave (on non-Retina systems) this has nasty side effects and generally makes everything look like garbage.\nI found a hidden setting that apparently used to work, but has no effect in Mojave:\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleEnableMenuBarTransparency -bool false\nMy current poor-man's workaround was to create a 1920x1080 PNG with my preferred background picture, and add a 22px high 100% white bar at the top. This simulates the effect of having an opaque menu bar.\nDoes anyone know of a better way?\nedit: to help illustrate the difference, check out the side-by-side comparison below. The image on the left is with my \"hack\" of placing a 22px high 100% white strip across the top of an otherwise solid gray background.

Note the reduction in readability/contrast:\n\n\nA: On my MacBook Air (Early 2014) checking the box \"Reduce Transparency\" does the trick:\nSystem Preferences > Accessibility > Display\n\nIt being an older Mac (non-retina) I'm wondering if it works the same on newer Macs with/without retina display.\n", "Q: Can't update Developer Tools on Mojave Hello,\n\nThis question is about the Command Line Developer Tools that are usually installed with xcode-select --install and updated via a software update from the Mac App Store (at least until macOS 10.13). I use the developer toolchain on a daily basis and it has always worked and updated without issues.\n\nToday I've updated my mac from High Sierra 10.13.6 to Mojave 10.14.1, and I've lost the ability to update the Developer Tools.\n\nAfter the update I've executed a terminal command that relies on the developer tools being installed. It was a command to update Homebrew, although I don't think that the specifics matter, as I believe that any task that tried to access the developer tools would have triggered the same error message.\n\nThe error was:\n\nxcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun\n\n\n\nThe phrasing was new (maybe), but I thought that it was caused by the usual need to re-install the Developer Tools after some macOS updates.\n\nLater I tried to dig a bit deeper into the failure, and found out that:\n$ ls -l /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/total 0drwxr-xr-x  3 root  admin  96  4 Nov 19:32 share$ which xcrun/usr/bin/xcrun$ xcode-select -p/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools\n\nStill, as I normally do, I entered the command to install and update the Developer Tools in the terminal:\nxcode-select --install\n\nThis started the usual procedure: modal window to confirm, then request to accept the license agreement, followed by a progress bar. Except that it failed very quickly with an unexpected error:\n\n\nCan’t install the software because it is not currently available from the Software Update server.\n\n\nI've tried several times, to no avail. It gets always stuck.\n\nSometimes, however, the failure causes the System Preferences to report a pending update:\n\n\nIf I open that preference panel it starts searching for updates, and it always finds nothing except the first time that it happened. The first time, it found this:\n\n\n\n\nIt literally suggested me to install the updates for macOS 10.11 and 10.13. I have no idea why.\nI closed the preference without installing, and as I said it hasn't shown them again. There is also no update available in new Mac App Store.\n\nIs this a known issue? Is there any way to resolve the problem?\n\n\nUpdate\nOf course I can download the Dev Tools for macOS 10.14 installer from https://developer.apple.com/download/more/.\nBefore installing them manually, though, I'm wondering if there is anything that's broken with the system.\n\n\nA: I faced the same problem. The way I have solve the issue is given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*I got the new xcode 10.1 from App Store. Though the problem existed. \n\n*Then I run xcode-select --install which didn’t work. \n\n*I update my homebrew by brew update. Than I run sudo xcode-select --reset.\n\n\nNow it works fine.\n\nA: I'm the original poster. In the end I resolved the problem by installing the tools manually, with the installer I downloaded from https://developer.apple.com/download/more/.\n\nA: I had the same problem. It started to work without doing nothing special.\nI only run the following commands:\nxcode-select -print-path\nthen \ncd /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/man\nfinally \nwhatis xcode-select\nafter that I was able again to run commands like git etc.\n\nA: FWIW here's what helped me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall Homebrew completely (see FAQ).\n\n*sudo xcode-select --reset (thanks for the idea @Boka!).\n\n*Install Homebrew again (see brew.sh).\n\n", "Q: This application requires iOS XX.x or later Ages ago, if I tried to install an app on an older version of iOS, it would alert you and allow you to install the last release of the app for the iOS you are on.\nBut when I tried again today at work to install Excel on a iOS 10 device I got, \"This application requires iOS 11.x or later\". \nI know for a fact that Excel for iOS was available on iOS 10.

If not I'll have to tell management to get new iPad which they will not be happy about.\nPS: I am familiar with the hacky way to force installation of older versions.\n\nA: After doing a bit more googling and a suggestion here I found a work around. \nIt appears the AppStore will not offer you the older version of the application if you have not downloaded it in the past (ie own it already). So the solution is,\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in to the appstore from an up to date device (borrow one if you must).\n\n*Download the app you need.\n\n*Go back to your older device and locate the app in the appstore.\n\n*The icon to download the app should now be a cloud with the down arrow.\n\n*Press the cloud button and it will advise you that it will download the older version.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Is there a default confidentiality url I can link to?

One can easily imagine scenarios where the current installation contains some form of malicious programs (e.g., a key logger sending all your passwords somewhere). This may either be due to malicious intent of the previous owner (they installed it on purpose before trading the laptop) or the previous owner may have unintentionally had some virus, malware, etc.\nTherefore, wiping the system and reinstalling it is very much recommended.\n\nA: You can try sudo \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Language Chooser.app/Contents/MacOS/Language Chooser\"\nthen choose the system language you want.\nUpdate: I tested it myself.\nThe above command is only valid for \"macOS\", it will change the login screen and shutdown message etc.\nAnd the language of \"recovery mode\" is not associated with \"macOS\".  \nIf you want to change the language of \"recovery mode\".\nJust follow the picture,first click File(Dosya) then choose 'Change Language'.\n \n", "Q: Preview application is not showing search results when I do Cmd + F to search a string Actually this error occurred after I updated my os to Mojave.

As far I know, the actual charging power is selected by iPad. If the charger supports Apple 2.4A, iPad charges at 2.4A. Otherwise, a lower option will be chosen. \nAs long as you bought a proper charger, bad ones are unpredictable. \n\nA: All modern electronic is protected and self regulating and it will not suffer if you use bigger charger, AS LONG THE VOLTAGE IS CORRECT. (5 Volt)\nThus you will not damage it nor overcharge.\nOn the opposite end, if you use a smaller charger it wil just take much longer to charge.\n", "Q: Middle click with trackpad in MBP and Mojave I want to setup the middle click with a MBP using the trackpad.\nThe middle click is very useful to me since I can open/close tabs, can use 2 clipboards like linux (select and middle click to paste, besides regular copy/paste).

It sure works, I try a bit hard to press, but it doesn't move inward like it used to on iPhone 5s. Instead I feel a different kind of buzz/vibration in my iPhone.\nIs there anything wrong with my iPhone 8? There is no visible physical damage on the device, the iPhone is working absolutely fine, but I am concerned that something may be wrong with my iPhone 8 and the button isn't pressing fully, possibly due to some manufacturing defect.\nI bought the iPhone around a month and a half ago and have original warranty, so I can ask Apple to replace the unit.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: You need not worry. Since your iPhone is functioning fine, most likely there’s nothing wrong with your iPhone 8.\nWith the iPhone 7/7 Plus announced in September 2016, Apple introduced a new style of Home button which no longer physically clicks. Similar Home button is built into iPhone 8/8 Plus.\nThe click that you experience is a form of tactile feedback to let you know that the button press is successfully registered by the iPhone. You need not press it too hard under the assumption that it is damaged and requires a harder press.\nYou can read more about the new Home button in the Apple support article, How to use the Home button on iPhone 7 and iPhone 8.\n\nThe Home button on your iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, or iPhone 8 Plus is unlike the Home button on other iOS devices. Instead of moving inward when you press it, the Home button detects the presence and pressure of your finger. When you press the Home button, you feel a slight click.\n\nWhat you are experiencing is called Haptic Feedback produced by the built-in Taptic Engine. You can read more about the new Home button in iPhone 7/7 Plus/8/8 Plus in the linked articles:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iPhone 7's new home button isn't a real button\n\nAs well as killing off the headphone jack, Apple has dropped the mechanical home button from the new iPhone 7, replacing it with a static version that's force sensitive. Instead of a button that physically moves, the new home button will use Apple's \"taptic engine\" to click back at users. Vibrations delivered through the home button will be used as notifications, with unique buzzes for things like text messages and calls.\nThe new home button, which uses a \"taptic engine\" to give you physical feedback when you press it — it's pressure sensitive, too, so it can tell if you really mean to press it or just tap it.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Daring Fireball: The iPhones 7\n\nThe home button on both iPhones 7 no longer physically clicks. Instead, it’s a force touch sensor, and it uses the improved Taptic Engine to provide simulated click feedback.\n\nNote: The linked articles are mostly talking about iPhone 7 as it was with this iPhone that the new Home button was introduced for the first time. As far as the Home button is concerned, the contents are equally applicable to iPhone 8.\nAdditionally, this style of Home button is exclusive to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. It hasn't appeared in any of the iPod touch and iPad models so far.

However, yesterday my iMac (2014, I think?) didn't even boot, nor does it today.\nThe verbose mode shows this (I know I should post text, but I can't, for obvious reasons):\n\nI found only one question about the same error message on Apple forums, but it doesn't have any answers...\nThe boot drive check (from recovery mode and via fsck from Single user mode) didn't find any errors.\nHow can this be solved?\n\nA: I run fsck -fy three or four times, as suggested in the comments, but it didn't reveal any issues and kept telling me  \"The volume /dev/rdisk1s1 appears to be OK\".\nI was lucky to have Windows installed alongside macOS with Bootcamp, so I booted into Windows to see whether the data on the macOS partition were fine. It turned out that one can't just view APFS drives in Windows, so I had to install a trial version of APFS by Paragon, which allows you to mount such drives from Windows.\nThe partition mounted successfully, and I was able to see all my data, so, apparently, nothing was lost or corrupted. I was even luckier to have a spare hard drive lying around and a device to connect it to a computer through USB, so I did that and copied the vast majority of my files from the (faulty?) macOS partition to this drive.\nAfter the data were safe, I rebooted into Recovery mode, checked the partition from Disk Utility once again, which showed \"...appears to be OK\" again, and tried to reinstall the OS.\nI know the installation process is supposed to be kinda long, but this one was insanely long. Everything seemed to have installed (no errors whatsoever), and it attempted to boot itself. It was doing that and showing me the usual apple logo on the white background and a full progress bar for literally fifteen hours because I was told to \"let it work\" and that it might repair the drive in the comments, and was hoping not to lose any data. Well, that went nowhere, so finally I just shut the Mac down. (BTW, after booting from Windows again I found out that all the data on the macOS partition were still intact)\nI ended up wiping the macOS partition from the Disk Utility in the Recovery mode and installing macOS once again. This worked fine, and I got a fresh macOS Mojave installation, from which I'm writing this (semi-)answer. I can access all the data I copied to the external drive, nothing is corrupted.\n\nTL;DR - did a backup (the partition was not corrupted), nuked the partition from orbit and did a clean installation; still no idea why this happened.\n\nA: If it helps, i have 4 macs that all do this randomly. black screen or just the logo on boot. the only boot option that works is recovery (and that is on another partiation). On my iMac i can do an install (last time tried a complete new with migration) and first reboot after running a few hours back to the Apple.  I did try booting from a USB drive when it would not boot from the Apple internal SSD (imac) and that worked. I cam cloning the boot disk over to an external usb SSD drive to see how long that works. I don't know if this is an hardware thing (odd that 4 different macs have the issue) or a Mojave thing. I have sent in several feedbacks with no luck. if I can prove it works using USB reliably I guess I will drive the 40 mils to an apple store. \n", "Q: Numbers - Perform arithmetic on a section of cells I have a column of cells and I want to do 41 - (value of cell) for each individual cell without having to go through doing it manually.\nI know this seems simple but I can't think of an easy and quick way to do this.

The format did not complete though and ended with an error but the damage was done and the partition is just greyed out in the Disk Utility and is not visible in the Finder. The disk in question is a GPT 1TB drive which has a Windows 10 partition of ~225GB, one that Windows makes itself during installation, while the rest was the data partition which got wiped.

I don't have linux installed on this system although I had 2 images of backed up Ubuntu on this partition. \nCan you guys please help me in figuring out what the safest way to recover this partition is?\n\nA: The best software for this problem in my opinion has been EaseUS Data Recovery. It almost even maintained the folder and file structure as before. I think this was because macOS did not successfully complete the reformatting of the partition and gave an error, anybody looking at this in the future, your mileage may vary.

I don't know for sure if one can or can't remove them.\n\nA: It is not possible to delete/remove the unneeded built-in, Apple provided iOS apps from a device running iOS 9 or earlier.\nIn iOS 10, it became possible to remove a selection of Apple's built-in apps, but only from the Springboard (Home screen). The apps weren't really removed from the device, but simply hidden from view (thereby reducing clutter). They continue to persist on device, thereby consuming storage space. (Technically, this was due to the reason iOS 10 was built. Apple's built-in apps were part of the iOS itself, rather than installable from the App Store).\nStarting with iOS 11, Apple changed the way it built iOS and shipped first party apps such that it finally became possible to fully delete a selection of built-in apps and reclaim the storage space occupied by them. The same can be installed later from the App Store if need be.\nFor more information, refer to the helpful support article from Apple, Remove built-in Apple apps from the Home screen on your iOS 10 device or Apple Watch\n", "Q: How can I isolate what is causing the temporary \"stall\" during startup? As I see the progress bar on my MacBook Pro mid-2015 move from left to right, soon after it gets past the halfway point, it starts to slow down and eventually stops temporarily, at about the time the cursor appears. Then the spinning system cursor appears for about 3-5 seconds, and the boot sequence continues normally (and finishes).\nHow can I troubleshoot this? My wish would be to avoid a clean install and restore from scratch.\nI previously reported the same problem under High Sierra.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure it's disk encryption (FileVault2) that is causing the delay. I had to erase my internal flash drive and restore from backup. In so doing, I reformatted the flash drive as normal APFS and not APFS encrypted. There was no delay in booting.

I have users in my lab that run sound via their speakers.  I would like to disable the ability to do so on all machines in the lab to prevent this, whilst still allowing them to use their headphones.\nI have read articles about how to disable all audio (not a totally desirable outcome, but better than the alternative) by deleting the IOAudioFamily.kext file, however, this doesn't seem to work on High Sierra.\nHas anyone aware of a solution to this issue?\nThank you for your help.\n\nA: I found this for you...\nHow to set the volume level to the secret minimum\nSo here's the deal, normally when you set the volume to 0 the speakers are automatically muted. On the keyboard you can hit the mute button while the volume is at 0 and it will unmute to the secret lowest volume setting.\nLikewise, you can instruct AppleScript to not automatically mute the volume:\nosascript -e \"set volume without output muted output volume 1 --100%\"\n\nHow to set the volume without unmuting\nSometimes you want the volume to stay muted, but to come on at a particular level when you unmute.\nThis is how you prevent the audio from unmuting when you adjust the volume level:\nosascript -e \"set volume with output muted output volume 42 --100%\"\n\n\nA: There are a handful of software-based solutions, but most of them do not support multi-device control, which is what you're looking for. So, whether you disable computer audio completely, or limit the volume on all devices, it sounds like it's not entirely what you're looking for.\n\nI would like to disable the ability to do so on all machines in the lab to prevent this, whilst still allowing them to use their headphones.\n\nOne simple approach to this would be to purchase a short headphone extension cable for each computer. With this extension cable plugged in, all audio will be routed to the headphones even though there may not be any headphones plugged in to the built-in jack. I think that would be simplest, provided no one removes it from the back of the computer.\nAmong the other software-based approaches, such as Earsafe, Whisper, or Volimeter (CLI), and Volume Limiter only Volume Limiter gives the ability to do this on a per-device basis.\n", "Q: How to find MAC Adress of second system? I'm on Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan, but have a second OS on my hard drive: Mac OS 10.6.8 Snow Leopard. I'm resetting my router and am therefore looking for the MAC hardware addresses of my two systems.\nThe MAC address from the system I'm currently on (10.11) I've found within the system report and in the internet preferences within the system preferences (menu \"Hardware\").\nIs there a way to find the MAC address (somewhere in the depth of my hard drive) of my second system without rebooting into said system or is it even the same on both systems? Yes, I'm lazy.\nMany thanks in advance!\n\nA: A media access control address (MAC address) of a device is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communications at the data link layer of a network segment. In other words, the MAC is independent of the operating system.\nWith certain hardware (such as routers), it is possible to assign your own Mac address. This is often referred to as cloning. I do not believe this is possible with macOS. Although, you can assign a your own MAC address to any virtual machines running in VirtualBox. \n", "Q: Long Press on Notifications on iPhone XR Not Working I have a new iPhone XR running iOS 12.1.\nWhen I get a new notification (such as an iMessage, a Reminder, etc.) on the lock screen, I should be able to long-press on the notification (instead of force/3D touch) and see shortcut options (or quick reply, in the case of iMessage).\nThese options are all enabled in Settings and I have tried rebooting my device and it still doesn't work. FaceID has unlocked the device and I know additional options are available because I can still swipe notifications to the right and select \"View\" which shows what I would expect to see when long-pressing the notification.\nI submitted a radar to Apple, so hopefully they address it. But I just wanted to see if anyone else has run into this and found a solution.\n\nA: It isn't that it is malfunctioning, Apple has not added support for long press on lock screen notifications.

I realise it's possible that the keyboard is faulty and want to know is there any way to \"reset\" the keyboard or any additional troubleshooting step that can be taken to be sure that the keyboard is due for replacement?\n\nA: I think what you have is a worn out keyboard. I've had a keyboard do this to me. More than one actually. I'm a writer by the way. And since 2011 if you used it daily, that's a lot of keystrokes.\nNot only wearing out, but the key pads - the contacts inside - can develop corrosion.

I cannot play any sound out loud or through my headphones. I don't really know what to do and need my laptop for school. It's been like this for a week now. \n\nA: Have you tried using an app called smcFanControl. It's a nifty little program that can directly control the speed of your fan.\nYou can also check the CPU temperatures to see what's making it hot - if indeed something is. Even when it gets hot it can take a while to cool down again.\nIt's usually something in the background that causes this.\nOpen Activity Monitor in Utilities, and click on the CPU tab, so that the programs that are running show up with the heaviest users first. That will show you what's using most resources, and thus causing your fan to run.\nThings like iCloud, Dropbox, Photos updates as they synchronise with the cloud services can also cause a lot of activity, thus overheating the system and causing the fan to overrun.\n\nA: First look if something is really heating it up or is it a fake.\nOpen Activity Monitor and look for highest CPU user and then for highest Energy Consumption to find out.\nHere is a sample from my Mac (not running hot)\n\n\nIf CPU is <100 % and Energy consumption is normal, then it is a Fake (no heat).\nThere is a device (a chip) in your Mac called System Management Controller (SMC) that controls the power (battery) and Temperature sensors (Fans).\nThe SMC needs sometimes to be RESET so to operate normally.\nImportant is to actually see the confirmation that SMC was reset properly.\nWhen you are doing the SMC reset procedure, carefully monitor the MagSafe (plug) light, it has to briefly change color. \nHow to reset SMC depends on your Mac model, and here are Apple instructions.\nPlease do not install any 3D party software like \"smcFanControl\" it does not do any good to your Mac.\n", "Q: How do I get the English United States international keyboard layout on my MacBook?

I noticed that when I migrated from backing up over USB to SMB that Time Machine started using sparse bundles for backup. I was unsuccessful in using this bundle as a backup drive when connecting to the hard drive directly via USB. \nI tried mounting the bundle, but macOS complained about insufficient permissions. I then took ownership of the bundle and successfully mounted it manually — still not listed in the Time Machine settings.\nIs it possible to back up to a local sparsebundle? I would like to default to SMB backups, but have the choice to use USB3 for speed.\n\nA: Time Machine should automatically mount the .sparsebundle if you set the drive that contains it as the backup location.\nFailing that, you can double click the .sparsebundle to mount it, then tell Time Machine to backup to the mounted volume (something like /Volumes/Time Machine Backup). This might be an acceptable workaround if you only infrequently use it over USB3.\nIf you don't see the mounted .sparsebundle as an option in time machine you can set it manually via the terminal like so:\nsudo tmutil setdestination /Volumes/Time\\ Machine\\ Backup\n\nJust change the Time\\ Machine\\ Backup part to whatever your drive is called. Include -a after setdestination to add another backup disk, keep it left out to replace your current backup disks with the new one.\n", "Q: 135GB of Hidden Space + Snapshot Metadata Tree Invalid error in Disk First Aid I have a serious problem with \"Hidden Space\" eating up my hard drive.\nI'm running High Sierra on a mid-2013 MacBook Air \"Core i7\" with a 500gb ssd. \nThe last few weeks, something has to been continually filling my hard drive, as free space has plummeted from 200gb to less than 10gb. No matter how much I delete, my free drive space still hovers around 10gb-15gb. Even when I delete a large amount of files, the size of deleted files doesn't correlate with the amount of free space cleared after I empty my trash. \nDaisyDisk found that I've got 135gb of \"Hidden Space\", 127gb of which is \"Still Hidden\" and DaisyDisk is \"Unable to locate\"\n\nI've tried all of the listed items on their support page for this and none of them have solved my problem.

From here you are able to watch a smaller version of the video while going about your routine on a fully functional phone. You can also drag the smaller video screen around the phone’s screen to move it to a more convenient area (without stopping play).\nAdditionally, due to one of the more recent updates to the device, you can now do the same thing while watching a YouTube video - i.e. make the viewing screen small, move it around, and watch it while you do whatever you like on your phone.\nI recently got an iPhone X, and it is my first iPhone. Does iPhone have any such feature? If so, how do I employ it?\n\nA: Picture in Picture on iOS is only available on iPad currently.\n\nYou can use Picture in Picture with iPad Pro, iPad (5th generation and later), iPad Air and later, or iPad mini 2 and later.\n\n\nA: This feature is called Picture-in-Picture mode in iOS. Currently it is only available in certain iPad models which also run the same version of the software just like your iPhone X.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Multitasking on your iPad\n\n\n\n\nAs of this writing, this feature is not available in iOS running on iPhone X (or any other iPhone), some 3rd party apps such as WhatsApp and YouTube provide similar feature in a somewhat restricted manner. Major restriction being that the app should continue running in the foreground while you playback the video.\n\n\n*\n\n*WhatsApp for iPhone updated with Picture-in-Picture mode, other improvements\n\nThe new Picture-in-Picture mode supports two services for the moment, Instagram and Facebook, which means that whenever you receive a link to a video hosted by one of these services, you'll be able to play it right within WhatsApp.\nMoreover, you'll be able to continue to watch the video while navigating to another chat and share your impressions with your friends. But that's not all that WhatsApp included in the latest update.\n\n \n\nYouTube's iOS app also support picture-in-picture video playback mode while you continue browsing the app. It has the limitation that the shrunk video playback window isn't floating and can't be moved around to a new location on screen.\n\n", "Q: `brew install openvpn` vs. Tunnelblick for OpenVPN client I recently switched to Macbook pro (Mojave) and would like to have an OpenVPN client installed. In Linux systems I've been always using openvpn from within command line. I just want to know if it would work flawlessly as in macOS.\nI see that everyone recommend Tunnelblick, or paid options such as Viscosity but i prefer free and open source solutions.\n\nA: According to it's official website:\n\nTunnelblick is a free, open source graphic user interface\n\nWhen I used Tunnelblick, it worked flawlessly with macOS. So I would recommend to go forward to run:\nbrew install --cask tunnelblick\n\nWhen you choose a software for Mac, if it's included in home brew or home brew cask package list or not is one point to consider. See if it's useful enough or popular enough to be a brew package.\n\nA: I find the feature comparison from the OpenVPN website quite helpful:\n\nAlternative: OpenVPN open source Tunnelblick program\nThe open source project has a client for the macOS operating system as well. It is called Tunnelblick and it is less limited in functionality than the OpenVPN Connect Client because it does support the option to connect to multiple OpenVPN servers at the same time.\n  On the other hand, it does miss some features that Connect Client does have as well like Python support for post-auth scripting and other functions that integrate Connect Client with Access Server, like the ability to import connection profiles directly from an Access Server, or the ability to authenticate any valid user on your Access Server and have them connect without having to install a connection profile for each separate user account. This is accomplished on the Connect Client with a universal server-locked profile which is not supported by the OpenVPN GUI program.\nThis program supports drag and drop to place OpenVPN connection profiles into Tunnelblick. These can be of .conf or .ovpn file extension. You can for example download a user-locked or an auto-login profile from the OpenVPN Access Server web interface, and drag and drop it on the Tunnelblick icon. The tray menu in the system tray will then show you options to use this connection profile – to start or stop the connection. Server-locked profiles are not supported, as mentioned earlier.\nThis program does support connecting to multiple OpenVPN servers at the same time, but there is a catch. You have to be careful not to implement conflicting routes and subnets when connecting to multiple OpenVPN servers at the same time. Unlike on Windows platform however, you do not need to worry about adding multiple virtual network adapters. These are provisioned automatically.\n\n", "Q: External monitor connected via usb-c causes mac to not show low battery notification I have a macbook pro 15 inch (2017) that I connect to a 32\" external monitor via usb-c. Usb-c is also 'partially' charging the mac but not enough to fully charge battery since voltage from monitor to mac is low. In turn, this causes the battery to discharge while power source is set to power adapter.\nTherefore the mac battery is discharging while connected to power. In this case when the battery gets really low no 'low battery' notification is displayed since it is technically 'charging'. Is this an issue apple should fix or do they expect us to check the battery percentage every minute in this kind of scenario.\nI was previously very reliant on the low battery notification so now the mac  is powering off just because I am not alerted to connect the proper charger.\n\nA: Whether or not this is something Apple ought to fix is entirely a matter of opinion. You can report the case to Apple as a bug and hope that they will change the way it currently works.\nIn the mean time you can install a third party app to monitor your battery that can alert you when the battery charge is low. For example you can install SlimBatteryMonitor, which you can get for free here:\nhttp://www.orange-carb.org/SBM/\n", "Q: Safari stops playing audio after user login This was happening since Sierra for me and it's still here now on Mojave. Every time, when closing my macbook over night (just switch user to login screen, no logout or shutdown), if I don't quit Safari, the next day when I login the audio is completely silent in Safari. The system audio is still working and songs in Finder/iTunes play normally, but not Safari.\nBut the really annoying part is that the only way (I found to work) to get the sound back was to restart the whole system. Restarting just Safari did nothing, logout/login did nothing, killall Safari nothing, etc.\nDoes this happen to anyone else too? Do you know of any way to fix the sound, other than rebooting the computer? Thanks!\n\nA: Nevermind, found out what the issue was. I have Loopback installed for capturing system audio for screen recordings and it is set to start automatically on login, muting the audio from Safari but it then doesn't pass the audio through to the system output.\n", "Q: How does macOS implement symbolic link in Mojave on FAT32 filesystems? I remember in the past, not all types of aliases (as in the macOS feature) can be created on all filesystems. This is because symbolic link (as in the type of file) is a special Unix file type, whereas aliases (as in the kind of file with resource fork) utilizes resource forks (which on some filesystems creates the ugly \"._*\" files). \nBut today, I just created a symbolic link on my FAT32 USB pointing to a folder in my removable harddrive. \nMy question is: \n1) How does macOS Mojave creates symbolic link on FAT32 filesystem? \n2) Is it portable with other Unix/BSD/Linux systems? \n3) Is it compatible with Cygwin? \n\nA: The Minshall+French format is what macOS uses to store Unix symlinks on FAT and CIFS volumes. More details on the Minshall+French format can be found here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/UNIX_Extensions\nThe Linux CIFS implementation provides a 'mfsymlinks' mount option (which is off by default) that supports the Minshall+French format.\nI believe Docker for Windows also supports the Minshall+French format.\n\nA: They've implemented using regular files - This feature is specific to macOS with FAT32, and is not portable or compatible with other systems or environments. \nHere's a screen shot of directory listing in Explorer and \"ls -l\"\n\nAnd here's the content and hexdump of the file: \n//64-bit Cygwin @CGEMA/\n$ cat /cygdrive/j/MiniSync/Upload/ref\nXSym\n0019\n086ccc9c5c27f3907e47a03c3423b91e\n/Volumes/ProNJF/ref\n\n...\n\n//64-bit Cygwin @CGEMA/\n$ od -a -t x1 /cygdrive/j/MiniSync/Upload/ref\n0000000   X   S   y   m  nl   0   0   1   9  nl   0   8   6   c   c   c\n         58  53  79  6d  0a  30  30  31  39  0a  30  38  36  63  63  63\n0000020   9   c   5   c   2   7   f   3   9   0   7   e   4   7   a   0\n         39  63  35  63  32  37  66  33  39  30  37  65  34  37  61  30\n0000040   3   c   3   4   2   3   b   9   1   e  nl   /   V   o   l   u\n         33  63  33  34  32  33  62  39  31  65  0a  2f  56  6f  6c  75\n0000060   m   e   s   /   P   r   o   N   J   F   /   r   e   f  nl  sp\n         6d  65  73  2f  50  72  6f  4e  4a  46  2f  72  65  66  0a  20\n0000100  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp\n         20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20\n*\n0002040  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp  sp\n         20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20  20\n0002053\n\n//64-bit Cygwin @CGEMA/\n$\n\n", "Q: What does model name means for MacBook Pro?

Fake MacBook?\nHow to read that model name?\nDoes Apple have some search engine (some special page or application) where I can type MacBook's model name and get full info about the device?\nOne:\n\nTwo:\n\nThree:\n\n\nA: The MR942 designator is most likely a partial Apple Manufacture Part Number, e.g.: MR942LL/A\nFrom CDW, an Apple Authorized Reseller, in the image below see the yellow highlighted section.\n\n\nAccording to Mactracker, a MacBook Pro with MR942 which they call it an Order Number, and which by the way is an incomplete Order Number, e.g. MR942LL/A, is a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) 2.6 GHz Space Gray, as shown in the yellow highlighted section of the image below. \nMactracker is probably mistakenly calling an Apple Manufacture Part Number an Order Number.\n\n\nLooking on the box my MacBook Pro came in, this convention corresponds to what's labeled as \"(1P) Part No.\", albeit a different sequence nonetheless, it matches the pattern of ?????LL/A and as such MR942 is in all likelihood a partial Apple Manufacture Part Number.\n\nA: Part numbers for MacBooks (and Apple products in general) take a number of forms:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Early 2016\n\n*Macbook Pro 11,4\n\n*MJLQ2xx/A\n\n\nBy common convention the first one is how they are often referred to online. The second one is, for all intents and purposes, the version of the Mac. In the above example that would be the eleventh major version of MacBook Pro and the fourth minor revision of that particular model. The last one is the Apple Part number.\nNote that these are for desktop/laptop Macs. iPhones and iPads are a bit different.\nYour part number does not confirm to any of these conventions so it is likely something used locally. Possibly the in-store SKU (or stock/part number) which has no relevance outside the specific store or chain of stores.\nIf you need to reference a particular model of Mac you will need one of those designations. If you re-visit the store and are allowed to handle the Mac you want, go to the Apple Menu and select the first item in that menu: \"About This Mac\" you will get something like this\n\nNote that the model designation is just below the information about the Operating System and describes this Mac as  a MacBook Air (Early 2014).\nOnce you have that information you can then go to other stores to compare or online to look up specs and prices.\n", "Q: Access iCloud emails on an Android without Mac or iPhone I want to access my iCloud emails on my Android phone.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a browser doesn't work; iCloud.com just says: Your browser is not currently supported.

But I don't have a compatible device (iPhone, Mac, etc.) for enabling Two-Factor authentication.\nHow can I access my iCloud email (and calendar, if possible)?\n\nA: You can try to request the desktop site of icloud.com within your Android browser (don‘t know too much about Android, but there should be an option for that). If this doesn‘t work, visit a friend with a PC/Mac/Linux machine, an Internet cafe, etc to log in to iCloud.com once and generate the password needed. Don‘t forget to do this in private mode so any login details get deleted afterwards. \n\nA: You should be able to get iCloud website to work fine by accessing the Desktop site in any of the modern mobile browsers.\nI tried it using the current latest version of Google Chrome for Android (70.0.3538.80). It is preferred as it is pre-installed on most Android devices and is regularly updated.\nOnce you load the iCloud website, a message is shown stating Your browser is not currently supported.\n\nSimply tap on the options button shown towards the top right and tap on Desktop Site item to request the Desktop version of the website.\n \niCloud website now loads and you can login just like you do on a Desktop browser.\n\nWhen logging-in for the first time on your Android device, you'll need to get the six-digit, Two-Factor Authentication code from any one of your trusted device.

In that account, they enabled iCloud and other typical options.\nSince then, that person's iOS devices (iPhone, iPad) will periodically connect to the Mac using Bluetooth. It will appear in the Bluetooth menu in the Menu Bar. It will be bold, indicating it's connected.\nWhen the device is connected, especially if the device is not close by but is for example in another room, it interferes with the Bluetooth devices I'm actively using, a mouse, keyboard, and Air Pods. Interference with the airpods is particularly annoying because it will garble the audio and sometimes cause the air pods to drop off. I suspect it may also be causing unnecessary battery drain on the devices.\nBecause the unauthorized device is connected, I can use the Bluetooth menu to Disconnect the device, at which point the interference stops, but then the device reconnects again, sometimes right away, sometimes minutes later.\nThe issue doesn't happen reliably. I can't recreate it. It seems the right confluence of factors needs to be happening for the device to connect and interfere with the communication. Because the issue only started after the update to Mojave and the enrollment of my friend's account, I suspect one of those factors is key, most likely the latter.\nI've worked with Apple Support on this issue and we've first confirmed a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*the device is not present in the bluetooth devices (nor vice versa)\n\n*the device is not listed in the wifi settings\n\n*the device is not present in iTunes\n\n\nWe've also started a couple of troubleshooting steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Paired then unpaired the device\n\n*Run NVRAM reset\n\n\nI've also confirmed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Neither of the devices are listed in the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist except for in the DeviceCache section.\n\n\nInterestingly, both devices appear by name many times in the DeviceCache, all with different Bluetooth addresses (93 times and 170 times).\nI'm going to continue investigating, but if anyone has a clue how to proceed with troubleshooting this issue - how to prevent those devices from interfering with basic usage on the mac, I'm open to suggestions.\nFollow up: Pairing and unpairing and NVRAM reset had no impact. It continues and pair silently.\nEdit: My next troubleshooting step is to delete the Bluetooth preferences file (/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist) and reboot. Doing so did unpair all devices, but did not correct the issue.\nEdit: I did some other troubleshooting steps with Apple. They had me log in to the friend's account and delete the devices from Bluetooth. I forget exactly what we did, but it did not solve the issue.\nI've since deleted the friend's account and rebooted the machine, but that also hasn't remedied the issue.\n\nA: This is happening with my new (2017) MacBook Air + wife's iPhone 8. She had a local account on the Air, signed into iCloud.\nSigning her out of iCloud on the Air did not fix anything.\nWe removed the Air from her iCloud account via her phone, and all seems well now.\nThis was very annoying because my AirPods would start to have a \"stadium\" stereo effect every time her phone paired to the laptop.\n\nA: Ultimately, we ended up deleting my friend’s account from the laptop. The problem persisted for a short time after that and then went away days or weeks later.\n", "Q: Are Macs vulnerable to the recent SSD encryption vulnerability? It was recently discovered that the hardware encryption of many SSDs is completely broken and cannot be trusted at all.\nCan this affect Macs? Does MacOS trust the hardware encryption of the SSD drives, or does it always use software encryption? Is there a way to check whether SSD-based or software encryption is being used?\n\nA: This does not affect Mac because Apple doesn't use the SSD's built in hardware encryption algorithm. Apple's FileVault uses  an XTS-AES 128 cipher that's  \"tied\" to a password and protects the boot partition of your drive (the EFI is not).\nThe SSDs mentioned in the article can have the master password \"reset\" by simply writing a single bit to the SSD's firmware.\nOperating Systems like macOS and FreeBSD boot an un-encrypted partition first, then it boots the encrypted one based on a password/phrase/credential supplied by the user. \n\nDoes MacOS trust the hardware encryption of the SSD drives, or does it always use software encryption?\n\nIt doesn't trust it nor distrust it.  It uses it's own encryption rather than what's included with the drive.\n\nIs there a way to check whether SSD-based or software encryption is being used?\n\nFor macOS through Sierra (10.12.x):\ndiskutil info diskX | grep -i encrypted\n\nFor macOS High Sierra and (10.13.x):\ndiskutil apfs list | grep -B6 FileVault\n\n\nA: Source:\n\nMost modern operating systems provide software encryption that allows a user to perform whole disk encryption. While software decryption offered by Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS offer strong software encryption, BitLocker on Windows falls prey to the SSD flaw by defaulting to hardware encryption when available.\n\nThis following source indicates that macOS seems to not be affected by the vulnerability.  The story states in other places that Windows defaults to hardware encryption and uses software as the fallback; unlike macOS which defaults to software first.\nSource:\n\n\"BitLocker, the encryption software built into Microsoft Windows, can make this kind of switch to hardware encryption but offers the affected disks no effective protection in these cases. Software encryption built into other operating systems (such as macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux) seems to be unaffected if it does not perform this switch,\" the researchers say.\n\n", "Q: Upgrade to Mojave messed up Guest account Prior to upgrading to Mojave, I had the Guest account enabled, so that if my laptop went missing, the person could at least access Wifi, and I would know the location through Find My Mac.\nI have the firmware password on, and I had verified this worked as expected.\nHowever, when I upgraded this week, I found the Guest account was now turned off.

One of the problems I have with Apple Watch series 1 is the connection speed. Sometimes it takes a while for the weather, events near me or apple map to appear. I assume this is because of the wireless connection speed. My iPhone can load these data almost instantly when sharing the same wifi network. I wouldn't mind upgrading my Apple Watch series 1 to 3 if the wireless speed is much faster.\n\nA: In terms of specification, the Apple Watch series 1 and 3 support the same wireless networking protocols (80.2.11 b/g/n on 2.4 Ghz) and their associated theoretical maximum speeds.\nHowever, effective wireless networking speed is affected by many other factors than the wireless protocol used - for example the interface speed between the wireless module and the main CPU, and the processing power of the CPU itself.\nIn reality, I don't think your problems with slowness in weather data, event data, etc. coming in is really related to wireless networking speed. It makes more sense that they are slow because the main CPU is busy doing other stuff, and background tasks such as retrieving weather information is intentionally underprioritized.\nSo in practice I would expect an Apple Watch 3 to perform these tasks much faster than the Apple Watch 1 - simply because the Apple Watch 3 has a much faster CPU and is in general a much speedier watch.\n", "Q: MacOS - can I disable F12, Ctrl-Left Arrow, Ctrl-Right Arrow?

Is it the tiny slice on the pie chart next to the Bootcamp slice? Cuz I do have the option to \"minus\" Bootcamp, but the tiny slice next to it has \"minus\" greyed out. Thanks for your help. Larry\n\nA: You no long have a OXReserved partition. The partition shown in you question is the Windows Recovery partition. This partition is created when Windows is installed using the Boot Camp Assistant. (Although, the partition can also be created when someone installs Windows without using the Boot Camp Assistant.) A correct installation of Windows should include a BOOTCAMP partition and a Windows Recovery partition. \nTo remove the Windows Recovery partition using the Disk Utility, you would first have to remove the BOOTCAMP partition.\n\nNote: Normally, the Boot Camp Assistant is used to remove Windows.\n\n", "Q: How to open macOS news article in browser?

I had a lot of parts (battery, display, logic board) of my MBP mid-2015 replaced at the local Apple Store. When it was returned to me, it had a big new problem: it would keep booting into internet recovery mode (although it eventually did boot), but eventually ended up freezing while I was using it. Trying to reboot into recovery mode put me in the same internet recovery cycle\nHowever, it turns out that my MBP runs fine from a bootable external backup SSD over USB. Since running Disk First Aid at that point found no errors on the internal SSD, I thought I would try to reinstall Mojave from the SSD, but when I did so, the installer refused, informing me that my Mac had an incompatible firmware version and suggesting that I try to install Mojave on a HFS+ disk! (alas, my MBP's flash drive is formatted as APFS encrypted). It was then that I realized that what must have happened is that the replacement motherboard has an earlier firmware version that is incompatible with OS X 10.14.1 installed on the MBP's internal flash drive, and the so-called \"geniuses\" at the Apple Store didn't think about this.\nThe problem is this: how can I update the logic board firmware so that it is compatible with Mojave? I just tried an internet recovery install of Mojave, but the installer refused for the same reasons as before (incompatible firmware). I can't even see a way to downgrade the internal flash drive to HFS+ …\nIs my MBP able to run from the external SSD because it happens over USB, or because that SSD happens not to be encrypted?\n\nA: Let me outline the solution here in case any one else encounters the same problem.\nThe installer wouldn’t allow me to select the internal flash drive of my MacBook Pro, and the precise installer error message was “This Mac needs a firmware update in order to install to this volume. Please select a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) volume instead.”\nSo there were 2 solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the internal flash drive, erase, reformat as HFS+, and run the installer again.\n\n*Install Mojave on an external HFS+-formatted drive.\n\n\nExplanation: with the “stock” firmware of a replacement logic board, the installer expects an HFS+-formatted drive, and won’t update the firmware until it can install the OS on an HFS+-formatted drive.\n", "Q: iCloud: Untrust a saved Web browser I recently accessed iCloud Website using a device that I don't personally own and generally use.\nAfter successfully logging-in by entering my Apple ID/Password and the Two Factor Authentication code, I was asked if I would like to trust the browser, so as to skip entering Two Factor Authentication code every time I login, I complied. (It isn't a public device and there is no possibility of unauthorized access)\n\nThis gave me the of flexibility to easily login in with just my Apple ID and password when I don't have any of my trusted Apple device around to get the Two Factor Authentication code.\nNow, I am done using the device and will be returning it to the original owner. How do I untrust the Web browser?, i.e. require it to ask for Two Factor Authentication code next time a login is performed using my Apple ID? Also, is there a way to see a list of all similar trusted browsers and untrust them?\n\nA: It appears that a cookie (probably X-APPLE-WEBAUTH-HSA-TRUST) is stored when you choose to trust the browser. Clearing cookies should essentially disable this functionality and require a 2FA code to log in again.\nWhen you sign out of iCloud using the browser (Click your name in the top right corner and Sign Out), you are also presented with this dialog:\n\nIf you uncheck Remember me on this browser so I don't have to verify my identity next time. and sign out successfully, the browser will require a 2FA code the next time you log in.\n\nA: 1- First sign out\n\n2- next time yo will be asked again to trust the browser\n\n\nA: If you no longer has the device, you may choose to sign out of all browsers.

I want to play a slideshow of my pics from the Photos App on my Mac by exporting them on a USB stick which I can plug into my TV.

This renames the files like 1.jpeg, 2.jpeg, 3.jpeg, and so on. The problem is that my Sony tv sorts files in Alphabetical order, so the file 10.jpeg comes immediately after 1.jpeg, and not 9.jpeg as expected.

What is the maximum weight of \"stuff\" that I can place on top of a 2018 Mac Mini without damaging it?\nThis is not the weight of the unit itself — but the maximum weight of other units that can be placed on top of it to save desk space. I'm thinking to put a monitor on it (literally).\n\nA: Apple officially stacks 4 on 1. So at least 4*1.3kg=5.2kg I thought.\n\n\nA: If you could support the bottom of the Mini around the metal periphery of the bottom vice the plastic disk it would well support a 22\" monitor.\nThe problem with being supported by the plastic disk with a heavy weight is that if the weight is not evenly distributed, the plastic may cold flow unevenly over time resulting in unequal pressure on the bottom and tilting of what is on top and even it falling off but I doubt it would go that far that fast. The Mini/plastic getting hot would accelerate the cold flow.\nThe metal part of the 2012 Mini (the one I have) should easily support even a Thunderbolt monitor.\nAnother problem with putting something on top is that it may attenuate wifi and BT reception. \nSOURCE\n", "Q: How can I use Logitech Options to lock my screen with my MX Ergo?

I updated my nov 2016 iMac to Mojave last week & everything ran super slow. Then I bumped the power cable out and it wouldn’t restart, no matter what I tried.\n24 hrs later I tried again & it finally powered up & seemed back to normal. I shut down, but it didn’t completely shut down... Just a black screen with the mouse cursor still visible & working, so I held down the power button to shut it down.\nNow it won’t power up again!\nWhat is going on? Anyone had anything like this? \nIt’s under extended warranty so I can send it off for repairs but I’d like it working sooner if I can :-(\n\nA: I strongly advise to never update when a new OS comes out. They always take at least one year to fix all the bugs. Here is a check list from Apple Support:\nCheck for display issues\nIf your Mac doesn't appear to turn on, it's possible that the computer is turning on but the display isn't working. To see if it's a display issue, press your computer's power button. Then check for these signs that your Mac is turning on, even if the display remains dark:\nYou might hear a startup chime.\nYou might hear fan or drive noise.\nIf your Mac has an LED sleep indicator, it might turn on.\nIf your Mac notebook has a backlit keyboard, it might turn on.\nWhen you press the Caps Lock key, the key's light turns on.\nIf any of these things happens and your Mac is connected to an external display, get help with video issues on external displays connected to your Mac. Otherwise, continue to the next section.\nCheck for power issues\nIf your Mac won't turn on and you've ruled out display issues, try these steps:\nMake sure that the power cord and adapter are securely connected to your Mac and plugged in to a working electrical outlet. Plug in a lamp or other device to make sure the outlet works.\nTry another power cord or adapter if the outlet works but your Mac still has no power. \nIf you're using a Mac notebook, make sure that you're using the right power adapter and cable and learn about troubleshooting MagSafe adapters. Leave the power adapter connected long enough to provide an adequate charge to the battery.\nCheck for other issues\nTry these steps if you've ruled out power and display issues:\nDisconnect all accessories that are plugged in to your Mac. This includes things like printers, USB hubs, and mobile devices.\nHold down the power button for ten seconds. Then press the power button again to see if the Mac turns on.\nReset the System Management Controller (SMC).\nIf you recently installed memory or a drive in your Mac, make sure that it's compatible and installed correctly. If possible, reinstall the original memory or drive to see if the issue persists.\nIf your Mac still won't start up after you've tried these steps, contact Apple Support. You can also visit an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider for help.\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204267\n", "Q: Randomize MAC Address Using Platypus I am running the following script in Platypus but the MAC address does not change:\n#!/bin/zsh\n\nIF=en7\n\nmac=`ifconfig $IF | awk '/ether/{print $2}'`\necho \"$IF mac before change=$mac\"\nrandmac=`openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\\(..\\)/\\1:/g; s/.$//'`\nsudo ifconfig $IF ether $randmac\nmac=`ifconfig $IF | awk '/ether/{print $2}'`\necho \"$IF mac after change=$mac\"\n\nNot receiving errors anymore.

Sometimes I want to use the Menu bar of my MacBook, and I often move my mouse too quickly and it goes to the secondary monitor.\nIs there a button I can press to prevent my mouse from going to my secondary monitor, but instead trigger the menu bar to pop up in fullscreen mode?\n\n\nA: May I suggest simply changing the arrangement of the screens (in the dialog seen in your screenshot, not physically).\nYou can either place the screen to the side, or even just place it at an offset. Say you place it as far to the right as possible (while remaining above the main screen). In that case, you could move the mouse from one screen to the other by going all the way to the right edge of the screen and up.\n\nA: A convenient approach in this case could be to invoke the Menu Bar using the keyboard shortcut, Control + F2.\n\nYou can also customize the shortcut to your linking by going to System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts, select Keyboard in the left pane. Look for Move focus to the menu bar entry in the right pane.\n\nA: To keep your mouse cursor from jumping to the above external screen when trying to access the menu-bar on the screen below you could employ a 'sticky-cursor', or 'cursor bounce' feature so there is a pause, or bounce before your cursor moves to the screen above. Your idea of a button you can press to achieve this is also doable using a feature on Edgecase—an app created for your type of situation. \nEdgeCase is available at the Mac Store for about 5 dollars.\nI set up a cursor pause between screens on a Ubuntu desktop connected to my Macbook Pro desktop by using a Ubuntu feature that was practically built-in, which is how I knew there had to be a solution.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Will macOS Mojave 10.14 slow down an early 2011 13\" MacBook Pro? I am currently running OS X El Capitan on my early 2011 13\" MacBook Pro. I am thinking of upgrading to macOS Mojave, but would like to know if it would slow my MacBook Pro because of my specs?\nPlease see more info on the specs below:\n \nI'm not using an SSD and my current available space is 140GB (total is 320GB), though I always make sure I don't go below 100GB available space.\n\nA: As Nimesh already noted in his answer, that MacBook Pro is no longer supported.\nBut as chriszanf commented: \"Machines outside of those spec can be upgraded using dosdude's app: dosdude1.com/mojave\" \nBut apart from being unsupported that brings another caveat. Just installing that will work, but is no fine experience at all. For once, the installer will convert your magnetic drive HDD from HFSplus to APFS, and the new filesystem is a terrible performer in general and even much worse on rotational disks. That will slow you down.\nUsing APFS on hdds and why you might not want to\nYou also have to keep in mind that your graphics card is not exchangeable and does not supported Metal. That will slow you down.\nThe problems do not end there. And the list of hacks and workarounds you might have to hunt down is also long. \nIt is possible to install it. But probably not really worth it. \nIf you have some time on your hand, the following thread lists some experiences in attempting this:\nmacOS 10.14 Mojave on Unsupported Macs Thread and it is very conveniently just 471 pages long by now.\nPersonal commentary: on that hardware 10.12 Sierra is the last \"known good\" performer for me. That is currently at least also updated with security patches.\n\nA: The highest version of macOS supported on your MacBook Pro is macOS High Sierra 10.13. macOS Mojave requires a Mac with support for Metal (2012 and later Macs).\n\n*\n\n*macOS High Sierra - Technical Specifications\n\n\n*macOS Mojave - Technical Specifications.\nAs per the General Requires mentioned in the linked technical specifications page, you should be fine running macOS High Sierra. Overall performance will depend on the kind and number of apps running simultaneously on your Mac.\n\nmacOS High Sierra - Technical Specifications\nGeneral Requirements\n\n*\n\n*OS X 10.8 or later\n\n*2GB of memory\n\n*14.3GB of available storage to perform upgrade*\n\n*Some features require an Apple ID; terms apply.\n\n*Some features require a compatible Internet service provider; fees may apply.\n\n\n\nA: If you're worried about the specs of your MacBook Pro affecting performance, then change the specs! You can very easily open the bottom case and add more memory, which will help enormously. Swapping the hard drive for an SSD in a Unibody is also fairly straightforward. (I'd recommend getting a USB to SATA connector, so you can connect and clone/copy one drive to another before or after the swap.)\nRAM and an SSD will cost comparatively little, and breathe much new life into your old Mac. Then you can worry about upgrading.\n", "Q: Macbook pro 2018 with Mojave overheating when connected to external monitor I'm on a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) with Mojave 10.14.1. When I connect MBP to a external displays (either via HDMI or via Thunderbolt 2 adapters), the temperature raises sensibly (i.e., CPU temperature lies constantly over 90°) and fans start running fast (i.e., more than 50%) frequently, even if I am doing very simple tasks (e.g., writing in Word with a couple of Chrome tabs open with stackoverflow).\nI'm not sure that the problem started with Mojave or if it isn't actually related to the OS version.\nI'm wondering if there is a way to limit this annoying overheating as well as fans activity, while using external monitors.\n\nA: The higher power GPU in some MacBooks Pro puts out a lot more wattage than the low power GPU. \nThe reason it gets so hot when hooked up to a monitor, even when you’re just running Word or Safari, is because the display outputs are hardwired to the dedicated GPU - if you’re using an external monitor, the dedicated GPU (graphic card) is in use regardless of how demanding the workload is. This puts more stress on the cooling system, resulting in higher-than-average temperatures ;)\nThats the reason. I tried all my 6 Macbook Pro's and all does the same behavior. Switching to the dedicated graphic card and you can't just use the integrated iris.\n\nA: The 2018 15\" MacBook Pros all have dual-GPUs. The AMD GPU is required to be active when an external screen is connected. There is no way to use the internal (Intel) GPU for external screens. \nFan noise is one of the main nuisances of the MacBook Pros in my opinion. When I get too frustrated, I sometimes use Turbo Boost Switcher, which helps a bit. Volta is a similar App, but does not seem to work with 2018 MacBooks. Both Apps deactivate the CPU's turbo mode, which means less speed, but also less power consumption and less noise.\n\nA: I broke my head for 3 months and finally only one solution worked. Install Fan control app and then increase the fan speed to 5000 RPM. All heating issues gone.. Now whether its external display or heavy applications, Mac is always cool.\n\nA: use gfxCardStatus to switch to the internal gpu! It is free and should improve the performance. If you are then using final cut or heavy graphics program you can use the dedicated gpu again because in that case will get very ho and noisy as well\n", "Q: What is the life expectancy of a Magic Mouse 2 battery? I would like to know what is the battery life cycle of a Magic Mouse 2. Or the approximate number of charge/recharge cycles before its battery's performances will start to reduce visibly?\n\nA: Lithium ion battery life is specified by manufacturers in number of CYCLES, that translates in 3-5 Years. \nThe 3 to 5 Yr a very large gap. WHY?\nThe reason for it is because the life span depends on USAGE.\nDegradation\n\nOver their lifespan, batteries degrade progressively with reduced\n  capacity, cycle life, and safety due to chemical changes to the\n  electrodes. Capacity loss/fade is expressed as a percentage of initial\n  capacity after a number of cycles (e.g., 30% loss after 1,000 cycles).\n  Fade can be separated into calendar loss and cycling loss. Calendar\n  loss results from the passage of time and is measured from the maximum\n  state of charge. Cycling loss is due to usage and depends on both the\n  maximum state of charge and the depth of discharge.[95] Increased rate\n  of self-discharge can be an indicator of internal short-circuit.[165]\nDegradation is strongly temperature-dependent, with a minimal\n  degradation around 25°C, i.e., increasing if stored or used at above\n  or below 25 °C.[166] High charge levels and elevated temperatures\n  (whether from charging or ambient air) hasten capacity loss.[167]\n  Carbon anodes generate heat when in use. Batteries may be refrigerated\n  to reduce temperature effects.\n\n\nA: The Magic Mouse 2 uses a lithium ion battery and generally speaking those have a useful life of 3 to 5 years1.\nThat said, it's important to note that:\n\n*\n\n*Apple products (including accessories) have a 1 year warranty\n\n*Only accessories included with a Mac computer are covered under AppleCare.  In other words, if you buy AppleCare for your iMac that includes the Magic Mouse, it's covered.  It won't cover it if you bought the mouse separately (like with a MacBook)\n\nFrom personal experience, I've had rechargeable batteries in a Logitech Mouse last the better part of a decade and brand new batteries (genuine OEM) from Dell and Apple fail after a year. YMMV. (your mileage may vary)\n\n\n1Manufacturers' information typically specify lifespan in terms of the number of cycles (e.g., capacity dropping linearly to 80% over 500 cycles), with no mention of chronological age.[162] On average, lifetimes consist of 1000 cycles,[163] although battery performance is rarely specified for more than 500 cycles. This means that batteries of mobile phones, or other hand-held devices in daily use, are not expected to last longer than three years. Some batteries based on carbon anodes offer more than 10,000 cycles.[164]\n\n", "Q: How can I find out which 21:9 Monitors will charge my MacBook Pro 15\"? I know the LG UltraFine 5K monitor has the  ability to supply enough power to charge a 15\" MacBook Pro (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207448) but is there a way to tell if a different monitor supports this function? \n\nA: Your Mac has a power charge requirement (i.e. 85W or 67W).  To properly charge your Mac, you need a monitor that supplies at least this amount of power.\nFor example, looking at the support page you referenced, they state that\n\nWhen you connect the display using a single Thunderbolt 3 cable\n(included), it provides up to 85W of charging power to your MacBook\nPro with Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports.\n\n87W (watts) is the highest power rating that Apple power supplies will deliver (at the time of this post).  Those power supplies come with the 2015 through 2018 15\" MacBook Pros.  Everything else uses a smaller wattage adapter (i.e. MacBook Air uses 30W).\nWhat this means is the LG supplies more than enough power to charge and use pretty much any MacBook notebook with the only exception that it's just 2W shy of providing full power to the 15\" model.  In other words, those will charge and work just fine; it just won't charge as fast as the native charger.\nWhat to Look For\n\n...but is there a way to tell if a different monitor supports this function?\n\nIf the monitor can deliver approximately 85W of power (or greater) then it will support this function.\nIf it cannot deliver enough power to both charge and run the MacBook, it will draw power from the battery and discharge it.\n", "Q: Mac randomly crashes, main boot volume disappears Retina Macbook from 2017 running Mojave here.\nEvery few days, my mac suddenly and randomly freezes (sometimes at times without user input) and crashes.

Without repair or rescue.\nHere is a photo from Single User Mode diskutil list at a time when it just happened, when the boot volume disappeared:\n\nI don't know at all what this is about. Of course I never created these images by myself. \nWhen my Mac boots up again, everything is back to normal. The boot volume is back and those strange ones disappeared.

I’ll send the device in for repair, praying that they find something.\n\nA: To answer your question, is it hardware or software.\nSuggested course of action would be\n1- Back up you data\n2- Do a \"Clean Install\"\nThat should eliminate an formatting issues your SSD had.\nIf problem occurs again, your SSD needs Replacement/Repair.\n", "Q: Disabling hardware acceleration for Night Shift I'm noticing some artifacts when I watch full-screen videos on macOS with Night Shift enabled, and I suspect they are caused by hardware, because they disappear whenever an overlay appears over a full-screen video.\nSo, I was wondering, is there any way to disable hardware acceleration for Night Shift? And, if not, then is there any other application I can use that would perform the same function, but without taking advantage of hardware acceleration? (maybe an old version of f.lux or something else?)\n\nA: Since the artifacts disappear whenever an overlay appears, I solved the issue by creating an app that displays a persistent, invisible overlay:\n\n*\n\n*Created a new macOS Cocoa App in Xcode.\n\n*Edited the window properties in MainMenu.xib, in the attributes inspector, and unchecked \"Title Bar\", \"Shadow\", \"Close\", \"Minimize\" and \"Resize\", then in the size inspector I set content size width and height to 1, and initial position x and y to 0.\n\n*Edited Info.plist and added a new property \"Application is agent (UIElement)\" set to YES.\n\n*Edited AppDelegate.swift and changed applicationDidFinishLaunching to:\n\nwindow.isOpaque = false\nwindow.alphaValue = 0\nwindow.ignoresMouseEvents = true\nwindow.level = .floating\nwindow.collectionBehavior = [.canJoinAllSpaces, .transient]\n\n\n\n*Compiled the app for production with Product > Archive > Distribute App > Copy App.\n\nNow, whenever I want to watch full-screen videos with Night Shift turned on, I can start the application and there won't be any further artifacts. I can then close it from Activity Monitor. Another option would be to have it run at startup (System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items).\n", "Q: MacOS Mojave remote access login screen stuck on infinite loading spinner My company has a Mac Mini that we use for iOS builds. Occasionally, one of us needs to log in to it via remote access (from a Windows PC) to update the build tools.\nHowever, ever since updating the OS to the latest MacOS Mojave, most of the time we cannot log in remotely. On any VNC client (I use VNC Viewer but have tested this with UltraVNC as well). As soon as one of us establishes a connection to the Mac, it just shows the login screen with the username and account picture, no password prompt or buttons of any kind, and a loading spinner that just spins forever:\n\nI've found that I can \"fix\" this by physically accessing the machine and logging out of the account, but of course this is painful and impractical.\nIs this just a mojave bug? Are there any ways to break out of this loop? I should mention that this didn't seem to be an issue before the mojave update.\n\nA: My workaround was to run this command in order to completely prevent the login screen from appearing for VNC connections.\n(Depending on your security needs, you may want to avoid this approach.)\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement VNCAlwaysStartOnConsole -bool true\n\n\nA: Remote login should be allowed (System Preferences -> Sharing -> Remote login).\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect via ssh: ssh user@host\n\n*Run sudo pkill loginwindow\n\n*Connect using VNC as usual\n\n\nA: So apparently this is strictly a VNC issue. I usually use Tight VNC to connect to my Mac at home from work and I was getting the same spinning login. This time I tried to use the Screen Sharing feature built into OSX (by going to Command+K and entering vnc://ipaddress:port) and it prompted for my laptop's credentials and boom I was in with no problems while my VNC window was still spinning. You may need to reboot the Mac OR see if you can restart the VNC service (good luck, so far the normal commands haven't worked for me) on the Mac.\nHope that helps!\nGerry\n\nA: This appears to be a bug in MacOS Mojave's VNC implementation. Thankfully, I have found a workaround.\nIn the settings app, select Sharing. Then select \"Screen Sharing\" on the left and click on the \"Computer Settings...\" button.\n\nIn the dialog that pops up, check \"Anyone may request permission to control screen\" and un-check \"VNC viewers may control screen with password: _____\".\n\nIt removes 1 layer of security, so I would not recommend this if your mac has any public ports configured. It still uses MacOS's authentication for accounts, so as long as you have good passwords on all your user accounts it still may be reasonably secure. Hope this helps anyone looking for a workaround for this.\n\nA: My solution or workaround for this is using TigerVNC and going to Lockscreen when you're done managing Mac remotely. \nUsing this method above, haven't registered \"spinning circle\" issue.\n\nA: I have a slight modification to this issue. On using VNC I hit the login screen and cannot type the password. It’s like View Only.\nI thought I had it fixed by disabling vnc access and just enabling screen sharing for certain users. Then I used Real VNC configured for Apple Remote Control using machine username and password.\nIt was working great but just quit again.\nI even tried killing the login screen with ssh but that did not help. I really don’t understand why I keep hitting the login screen but cannot type a password.\n\nA: \nBy unchecking this options, I solved the issue.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro constant artifacts in the screen I'm Currently using MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013, OSX Mojave).

I'm writing some software that can ideally mount and unmount multiple Network File System (NFS) locations dynamically.\nTo avoid clashing with local names I plan on generating a new temporary dir under /private/var/folders such as /private/var/folders/6l/jbv4dn11301f7t2wm1r3mqlr0000gp/T/temp_mount.RXArBC for each time I introduce a NFS share - in the hope that the OS can tidy up these folders on shutdown.\nThe worry I have is that for example, if I were to try to remove the folder before it was unmounted with something like rm -r /private/var/folders/6l/jbv4dn11301f7t2wm1r3mqlr0000gp/T/temp_mount.RXArBC - if the mount was not read-only, this would result in deleting the contents from the share (despite failing to delete the top-level folder as the mount service is presumably still holding a lock to it)!  \nI'm concerned the OS isn't expecting /private/var/folders to contain any mounts and thus pose a similar problem.\nCan someone confirm how it is the OS will behave in this scenario? So far with my testing this hasn't happened, but I'm not sure this is indicative across the board for macOS users.\nAnother option I've considered is creating folders under somewhere like ~/Library/Application Support/MyAppDomain/MountDirs/ and performing tidy ups in my software as I go along, but I'm unsure how the OS will behave.\n\nA: No.\nThis is a system directory that contains things like logs, databases, your sleep image, etc.  It's not a directory that you should be mounting file shares to.  The purpose of the /private directory has already be discussed in the following posts:\n\n\n*\n\n*What's the \"Private\" directory in OS X for?\n\n*Snow Leopard *private* folder?\nEven the automount service doesn't mount shares to that directory, it's mounted in /Volumes.  \nYour best bet would be to either mount the share in a shared user space (i.e. /Users/shared) or within the users own home directory.  \n", "Q: Magic keyboard and trackpad via wired connection but internal transmitter is always on and a question I would like to use Magic keyboard and trackpad via wired connection.\nBut I've checked in the Apple store that those device's bluetooth transmitter is still on even when they are wired into mac.\nI wonder if the bluetooth transmitter in those devices make high level of EMF when it is not connected to mac via wireless connection.. I have little knowledge about bluetooth . I watched some videos on youtube and found bluetooth devices emit quite high level of EMF when they are transmitting data with computer.\nSo anyone has ever checked the level of EMF on Magic Keyboard and Trackpad  emitting EMF alone? \n\nA: The new Apple \"Magic\" peripherals (mouse, keyboard, track pad) are Bluetooth 4.2 or LE (low energy) devices which, unlike regular Bluetooth devices, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) doesn't broadcast all the time.\nBasically, the device will only listen for connection requests and respond accordingly.  So, when they say it's always on, it only means it's on and listening; not broadcasting.\n", "Q: How to reset iTerm2 Window/Tab Title when disconnecting from remote host? I have my bash_profile on my Mac and the remote computers I connect to setup to automatically put the hostname in the window's (or tab's) title area.\nA bash shell on my local machine\n\nA remote host name \"Socrates\"; also a bash shell.\n\nThe problem is, when I exit (and disconnect) from the remote host, the window title stays with the host name of the remote.  So, in effect, I'm on the local Apple bash shell with the remote name.  To fix it, I do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*close the window and open a new one\n\n*re-source the .bash_profile (. ~/.bash_profile)\n\n*create a new sub shell by issuing the command bash (not desirable at all)\n\n\nHow can I have this done automatically so that when I exit a remote shell, the title goes back to the original host name so I know what host I'm actually connected to?\nNote, the previously asked question, Terminal displays directory of previous SSH location even when not running SSH didn't adequately address the issue because the solution was to modify .bash_logoff which only worked for login shells.\n\nA: The solution to this problem is solved by using Terminal Control Codes (Esc 22 and 23) and  placing four simple lines in .bashrc of the remote host:\n# ~/.bashrc\n#\n# Set the Terminal Title\n\necho -ne \"\\033[22;0t\"                     #Save Title on Stack\necho -ne \"\\033]0;${HOSTNAME}\\007\"         #Set New Title\n\ntrap 'echo -ne \"\\033[23;0t\"'  EXIT        #Reset Title Window\n\nHow This Works\nBy using the Terminal Escape Sequence Codes 22 and 23, we can save and retrieve the original title.  The trap function (man bash) will execute a command when a signal is received; in this case upon exit.\nNow, when I exit (terminate) the remote host, the title reverts back to the proper host name.\nWhy .bashrc?\nI want to have this available to me whether I log into the host from a remote machine (most common) or when I am local to it.  .bash_profile is read for an interactive login shell and .bashrc is read for an interactive, non-login shell (local) is started.\nTo ensure that this is the same for both conditions, I include the following in my .bash_profile:\n# run a .bashrc file if it exists.\n\ntest -f ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc\n\n", "Q: Is there any program that can add titlebar functionality to the menubar panel?

I'm trying to do screen tty.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port 9600 on my mac, but I'm not sure about my baud rate. How can I determine this? It's just giving me a \"Cannot open line\" error.\nI'm trying to view output from an Xbox controller.\n\nA: \nWhat baud rate should I set when using screen tty for Bluetooth?\n\nBaud rate isn't dependent on how you connect to a serial console whether it be via bluetooth or hardwire.  It has to do with how fast the host (in this case the XBox controller) is sending bits through the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Trasmitter)\nWhat matters here is that you match the two UART settings with the XBox controller.  Those settings are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Baud (bit rate)\n\n*Serial Port Parameters\n\n\n*\n\n*Data bits\n\n*Parity bits\n\n*Stop bits\n\n\n\nBaud is the speed at which you're going to transfer data.  Common values are 9,600, 28.8K, 56K, or 115.2K (or more commonly as known 115,200).  Your XBox console will likely be either 9600 or 115200.\nThe Serial Port Parameters (or \"Configuration\") defines how each block of data is to be send/received.  This must match or you will get garbled info.  Common values are:\n\n\n*\n\n*8-N-1 or \"eight-none-and-one\" for 8 data bits, no parity bits, and 1 stop bit\n\n*7-E-1 or \"seven-even-and-one\" for 7 data bits, an even number of logical ones, and 1 stop bit  \n\n\nTL;DR\nTo launch screen and set your communication parameters, use the following syntax:\n$ screen <device> [speed],[config]\n\n(You can get the device name by listing the contents of /dev/cu.* after you plug in the Bluetooth serial adapter)\nSo, in your case, assuming 9600 baud and 8N1 configuration, use the command:\n$ screen /dev/cu.usbserialdevice 9600,cs8 \n\n\nA: I suggest you download Bluetooth Explorer as part of the 'Additional Tools for Xcode' package that's available (registration required) at \nhttps://developer.apple.com/download/more/\nGo to that link, then search for 'Additional', and find the Additional Tools package for the latest version of Xcode (you don't actually need Xcode installed to use the Bluetooth Explorer app!).\nThat will allow you more in depth BT analysis and information.\n", "Q: My SMC keeps corrupting, even after I reset it The SMC on my 2012-MPB keeps corrupting, causing the computer to not wake up or restart. I've tried resetting it multiple times, but the issue still occurs.\nThe only solution I've found is disconnecting and then reconnecting the internal battery, which is quite problematic. Is there anything I can do to solve this issue?\n\nA: SMC problems could be related to the battery itself.  That age of laptop doesn't have a separate battery - as in the average non-Apple motherboard which has a CMOS battery on the motherboard, so SMC would be using battery power to store settings.\nIf the battery's shot, SMC loses it's settings at whatever point the battery drains itself. \nSee if you can borrow another of the same model with a healthy-ish battery to test with for a bit...\n", "Q: How do I zip a folder using the command line while maintaining its file structure? For example, if I want to zip /Users/admin/Downloads/Backup, and I am at /Users/admin/, I could:\nzip -r downloads.zip /Users/admin/Downloads/Backup\nand if I unzip downloads.zip I would get a Users folder and have a Users => admin => Downloads => Backup structure.\nThis is particularly undesirable behavior if I want to create an installation zip file for TWRP.\nSo instead I will have to:\ncd /Users/admin/Downloads/Backup; zip -r /Users/admin/downloads.zip .; cd /Users/admin/\nThis doesn’t feel like what a pro would do.\nWhat can I do to zip a folder while maintaining its file structure?\n\nA: Not sure if this is really what you want, as you may use the command line or a script but there are options.\nFirst, don't supply the entire path for the archive\n cd folder; zip -r ../zipped_dir.zip *\n\nOr for a script you might use cd or pushd and popd to move into the directory that will be the root of the archive before issuing the zip command. How you do this exactly will depend on how the script knows what to zip up. But, if for example you want admin/Downloads/Backup/folder zipped with internal paths of just ./folder, you'd need to do this:\npushd /Users/admin/Downloads/Backup\nzip -r /path/to/out.zip ./folder/\npopd\n\nThat will result in your out.zip containing the relative paths you want.\n\nA: A \"pro\" would first read the manual. Now, the zip manual is full of cruft but long into the read you'll find- \" zip will store the full path (relative to the current directory).\". Further into the read you will find an option to remove all paths in your zip archive but that is not a great idea, since you can create a \"bomb\" archive that will pollute the directory in which it is extracted.

The name for this database is the Launch Serices Database and it's quite large and unwieldy if you dump it all.\n lsregister -dump | wc -l\n\nI have 533,000 lines of text in my database, so you might need to narrow down what you're seeking rather than just consuming the entire fire hose of data about every possible file type and every possible application.

Say you have a movie file on your desktop. You would use the metadata listing tool to dump all the attributes of that file (61 entries for one movie I have) and then you have to parse out the content type to match that up with the database dump from launch services.\nmdls ~/Desktop/video.mov | wc -l\n\nAnd to pick out just the one most specific content type (since a file has a tree of potential content types - you may have to consider them as well in your search - but since we're keeping this simple - let's assume the final type is what's matched for your case)\nmdls ~/Desktop/video.mov | grep -w kMDItemContentType\n\nSo for me, that movie is categorized by spotlight indexing as a com.apple.quicktime-movie type file and in the launch services dump - one of the apps that claims to open that file is /Applications/QuickTime Player.app\nScripting this is going to be quite an exercise, but the data is there for you to examine and play with.

The frequency the WiFi is on nor the network the HomePod is on has nothing to do with operation/functionality of the HomePod.\nFor a simple setup:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208241\nYour phone and your HomePod should be on the same network.  WiFi has nothing to do with it.  WiFi is just the transport. Following the simple setup process will end up with your HomePod and your phone being on the same network and the same Wifi SSID.\nFor an advanced setup:\nThere is no link for advanced setup since Apple only recommends the simple method.\nRequirements: I use the below method in my home. It allows for securing your IOT network without putting your users on the same network as your IOT. Your user devices will talk to the hubs on your IOT network and your hubs will talk to your IOT devices.\n\n*\n\n*Allow mDNS UDP port 5353 destination 224.0.0.251 between the IOT network and the user network\n\n*Put your phone on the WiFi SSID(IOT) that will connect you to the network you want your HomePod to be on.\n\n*Perform the simple setup steps from this link https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208241\n\n*On the WiFi SSID(User) network you must put a MAC address block of the HomePod. This will prevent the HomePod from jumping to the WiFi SSID(User) network.\n\n*Attach your phone to the WiFi SSID(User)\n\nIf you are using HomeKit and are adding accessories you will need to remember to place your phone on the WiFi SSID(IOT) network to add the accessory.  Once added you can switch back to the WiFi SSID(User) network.\nI would also suggest that you set the WiFi SSID(IOT) network to not auto-join on your phone so that you stay on the WiFi(User) network until needed.\nI have all IOT devices, HomePods, Apple TVs and Airplay amplifiers on the IOT network. With the above setup, you can still remote control your Apple TV with your iPhones Apple remote app or HomeKit remote function Airplaying music and video will also work.\n\nA: I believe that there is a much simple solution for that. Just switch from “Everybody can use it from the same WiFi network” to “Only who is sharing the house” from the Home app. It worked for me.\n", "Q: system takes up 50 GB of storage I'm working on a mac and since I've updated to High Sierra, the system takes up more and more space for no reason.

I do not see notifications for me to update to macOS Mojave. What os is best for my MacBook Pro Retina 13-inch, Mid 2014?\n\nA: \"Best\" is subjective, but given that your Mac supports macOS Mojave, that would be recommended as it's the most current version (unless you have a specific reason not to install it, like a mission-critical app that you know isn't compatible with it, though that's unlikely).\nAdditionally, Apple generally only releases security updates for the current version of macOS and the preceding major version. So, when the successor to macOS Mojave is released, presumably around a year from now, High Sierra will likely stop receiving security updates and you'll want to move to Mojave at that point anyway.\n", "Q: Prevent mobile data being turned off Does anyone know how to prevent mobile data being turned off on an iPhone 6 and iPhone 7.

From the output you posted, here's what we know.\n\n\n*\n\n*81 cycles and FCC of 3918 mAh is way out of specification\n\n*The Voltage and charge measurement that you have 234 mAh (mili-amp hours) remaining\n\n*It's showing a draw of approximately 2.5A (battery is being drained)\n\n\nThe SMC can only accumulate how much battery capacity is left by measuring the current power against the current draw and known full capacity.  In this case, it's measuring that you're out of power and indicating your battery needs to be serviced.\nThere's no \"dipstick\" that can give you the actual charge, the SMC must calculate it and from the data it's getting from the battery, it thinks it's failing even though it continues to work.\nYour best bet is to replace the battery (it's probably still under warranty) and still more likely to be the cause if you were careful with the cables and reseated them. \n\nA: Reviewing your Battery report: \nConsidering you installed it as \"new\" 3 months ago, unfortunately it behaves as 3- 5 Years old.\nThe Full Charge Capacity (mAh) value is down to 3918 (<50%) !! which is the absolute indicator of battery life, not so the cycle count. \n(new battery comes with ~8200 mAh that gradually over 5 Years goes down), once it reaches below 50% you will get the Service Battery.\nReplace it.\nYou current consumption Amperage (mA): -2579 has nothing to do with anything, it is a variable that changes depending on the load.\nIf you plug in the Charger that number will go positive. (= Charging)\nAlso the remaining charge has nothing to do with battery life.\n\nSMC can not read the battery values directly. There is a chip (IC) integrated with Battery called a SMBus chip or Gas Gauge or even Dipstick. It reads the analog values from the batter, coverts to digital and sends that to the SMC.\nThat is how it is possible for SMC to know the cycle count (and other values) even when you move the battery from one Mac to another.\n\nAn SMBus battery contains permanent and temporary data. The battery manufacturer program the permanent data into the battery, which includes battery ID, battery type, manufacturer’s name, serial number and date of manufacture. The temporary data is added during use and contains cycle count, usage pattern and maintenance requirements.\nTo your second question ...How to see if SMC reset worked.\nWhile doing it, watch the MagSafe plug light, it will briefly flickers if the reset was successful.\n", "Q: can't see timeline in final cut pro \nI was clicking lots of buttons in the toolbar to try to hide things I didn't need (browser, inspector, etc.: I wanted the preview window as large as possible to get more detail in a crop) but the timeline disappeared too.\nI thought \"great that means the preview window can be even bigger\".\nBut now I can't get the timeline back.\nIn fact, both the browser and the timeline toolbar buttons are greyed-out:\n\nHow do I show the timeline again?\n\nA: Nevermind, luckily I figured it out almost immediately after asking.\nI pressed Command-Control-1 (⌘ctrl1) to show the browser, and for some reason that un-greyed the timeline button, so I clicked the timeline button to show it again.\nThen I could even hide the browser again but the timeline stayed visible.\n", "Q: Set Microsoft Remote Desktop 10 to view another users session Is it possible to use Microsoft Remote Desktop 10, to remotly view another users session, so i can talk them through an issue (Teamviewer style) instead of making the host computers screen go blank, which is what MRD is currently doing to the host machine ?\n\nA: Unfortunately no.\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop is designed for the remote user to have their own desktop working environment and as such is not designed for screen sharing like LogMeIn or Teamviewer.\nIf you are looking for a free screen sharing solution or one that does not count on someone else's network infrastructure you might look into using VNC. It is common on Linux machines but as it is open source also available on Windows, Mac and a bunch of OSs you have possibly not even heard of.

It has an ATI Radeon HD 5770.\nI bought a Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 560 to upgrade. \nHow can I use RX 560 on OS X El Capitan and Mojave?\n\nA: According to various reports around the internet, to get to Mojave there are a couple of precautions to take so you don't lock yourself out of the machine.\nI would always be certain to have not only an up to date Time Machine backup, but I would also have a full clone of the working system before starting out... you never know when something might go wrong.\nI'm assuming the card you have is not specifically Mac-flashed.\nMy card is flashed, so some of these precautions are learned from others' experience, not my own.\nFirst of all, to be safe - it you have File Vault enabled, disable it & wait for it to finish decrypting before moving on.\nAnother thing to check is whether your new card is 6-pin or 8-pin. If it's 8-pin you'll need to get adaptors. From memory, the HD5770 takes a single 6-pin, but there should be a second cable already in situ. The new card will need both.\nYou could then test by just swapping in the card & booting up.  If you can see the boot screen, it's flashed. If you see nothing until you get to login, it's not.\nIf it's not flashed you cannot use File Vault once it's installed.[1]\nOther than that, on El Capitan it should 'just work', no drivers or firmware update is required.\nAssuming all went well so far, then you will need to update to High Sierra 10.13.6 before you can go to Mojave. I don't know why this is, & I was already at 10.13.6 anyway before Mojave, but general consensus is that this is a necessary step.\nI vaguely remember having to do a firmware update to get to High Sierra, though I don't remember the details. I think it was a simple 'Click OK & wait' type of structure.\nThe firmware update to load Mojave is different.\nIt will tell you to hold the power button until the light flashes or you hear a beep. Having done this many times now (all the way through the beta phase you had to do it every time, so once a week for 2 months ;) I can say with certainty that you need to wait until you hear the beep before letting go of the button. The Mac will immediately reboot at that point.\nOnce that's done, it's just a case of waiting until the install is complete & you can use your new card on Mojave.\n[1] Not being able to see the boot screen will limit anything you ever need to do before login; change boot drive, dis/enable SIP, use Recovery etc - so it's best to always keep your old card for just in case.\nHowever, as Mojave may not even boot with the old card in [I haven't tested this] you ought to hang onto the clone you made at the start. Belt & braces. Better safe than sorry.\n", "Q: iPhone Apple ID reset Can I reset or use a new Apple ID in my existing iPhone?

I completely understand the value of putting a hard disk (specifically) to sleep in some cases especially in the pre-SSD days of the past. It can save power, lower noise and such. But in the case of modern systems that are increasingly SSD-based, does this option have any value at all?\nMy MacBook Air (2018) running Mojave (10.14.1) has “Put hard disks to sleep when possible.” checked off by default (in System Preferences > Energy Saver), but this system uses an SSD.\nIs this option only focused on hard disk drives and ignored by SSD drives?\nI can’t imagine the internal SSD would ever “sleep” but correct me if I am wrong.\nIn short, does the “Put hard disks to sleep when possible” option have any affect on SSD drives in macOS?\n\nA: Solid-state drives (SSD) do not use a motorized mechanism to read or write data. For Mac computers that only include a built-in solid-state drive, this setting does not affect the built-in drive. It only applies to externally connected, mechanical drives.\n\nA: According to Apple:\n\nPut hard disks to sleep when possible\nThis setting powers down the hard drive motor when you aren't reading\n  or writing files from the drive. Solid-state drives (SSDs) don’t have\n  moving parts, so this setting doesn’t affect Mac computers that use\n  only SSDs to store data. \nConsider deselecting this option if you have\n  an internal or external non-SSD drive and you use apps—for example,\n  pro audio or video editing software—that work better with continued\n  read and write access to the hard disk.\n\nSource: Apple: Use the Energy Saver settings on your Mac [Bold emphasis mine]\n\nA: SSD vs HDD uses about 50% less of energy, so having the option turned on will help reduce overall power consumption.\nie - my MBP 15\" 2011 has 95 Wh battery in it (when new, down to about 60-70 now), so in a hour with the option you will save some 1-2% of battery life with the option on, depending on use.\nhttps://therevisionist.org/reviews/ssd-vs-hdd-power-consumption/\nhttps://linustechtips.com/main/topic/950687-hdd-vs-ssd-temps-power-consumption/\n", "Q: Unable to backup my iPhone using iTunes.

I could borrow a USB 2.0 to FireWire cable but first I would like to know if the connection from a MacBook with USB 2.0 port to my broken MacBook Pro with FireWire port is even possible. Do you know if this would work?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I can't find a specific Apple KB reference, but the consensus seems to be that you need Firewire, Thunderbolt or USB-C; USB 2 doesn't appear to be supported.\nFrom the MacSales blog - Mac OS 101: How to Boot and Use a Mac in Target Disk Mode\n\nWhat You Need\n  The list is short, but essential.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Two Macs. That may seem obvious, but it makes sense to point out that Target Disk Mode only works between two Macs; you can’t chain multiple Macs together. All of the connection types (FireWire, Thunderbolt, and USB-C) support hot connecting, meaning you can connect a cable between the two Macs while they are powered on. We recommend shutting down both Macs before proceeding, however.\n  \n*An appropriate cable to make the connection. Ideally, you should connect similar ports; that is FireWire to FireWire, Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt, or USB-C to USB-C. There are, however, exceptions.

Also, this can be saved per document so you can clean things up to encode and save any existing files into plain text.\nFormat Menu...\n\nSince plain text discards data, there is a change to review and undo this change before you save your file.

But this opens a new tab (not a new window) and requires specifying a URL. \nAutomator also has an \"Internet > Display Webpages\" action that has the same problems. \n\nIs there a way to get Safari to open a new, blank window? \n\nA: In Automator, create a Service workflow (pre macOS Mojave), or a Quick Action workflow in macOS Mojave.\nAdd a Run AppleScript action, replacing the default code, with:\ntell application \"Safari\" to make new document\n\nThe above piece of AppleScript code by itself will open a new window in Safari however, it will not have focus. If you want the new window to have focus then use a tell block, e.g.:\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    make new document\n    activate\nend tell\n\nYou can then assign a keyboard shortcut in the usual manner per information in the link within your question.\n\nA: Assumptions\nThis assumes that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari is configured not to open new pages in tabs\n\n*Safari is the default browser.\n\n\nHowto\nPress Cmd-Space then search and run Automator, create a Quick Action workflow (macOS Mojave and later, earlier that item was called \nService).\nChange the input method in the top right sidebar to no input.\nChoose Library -> Utilities -> Run AppleScript action.

Then I formatted the MBP mid 2012, made a fresh install and then upgraded it to Mojave. I have booted the MBP mid 2012 from the external SSD (restarting and pressing alt/option) and worked with it without problems. I have booted again the MBP Mid 2012 fro the external SSD (the external SSD has OS Sierra) even after having formatted the laptop and having installed Mojave in it.\nFew days later I have finally received my \"new\" MBP 13'' Retina (beginning of 2015, 3.1 Ghz Intel core i7). It comes with OS 10.11.6 EL Capitán.\nI tried to boot from the external SSD (which has Sierra) in which I have copied the HD of my old MBP mid 2012 and... I does not boot. I just get the Mac sound at the beginning, but then the screen stays black. No symbol of \"prohibited\", nothing. Just black screen.\nI presume that the system which is installed in the SSD does not recognize the hardware and wants to boot with the hardware it was installed previously (the hardware of the MBP Mid 2012...)\nAny idea about how I can solve this? I have an entire series of applications in the SSD that I need to use.\nSomething: I am not a Mac expert, therefore I am possibly not able to understand too technical explanations.\nThank you very much in advance.\nEmiliano\n\nA: First perhaps boot in verbose mode to see what is causing it not to boot. If it is hardware incompatibility like missing driver (which can happen if the install has continuously been upgraded and so not managed to get the drivers for other Macs) then the following non-destructive steps (assuming you don't care about what is currently on the 2015's internal SSD) should fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the 2012 Mac download Sierra and make a bootable installer\non at least an 8GB USB drive.\n\n*Boot the 2015 using the installer USB\nand use Disk Utility (from the menu bar) to clone the external SSD on to the internal\nSSD (be very careful to get this direction correct).\n\n*Disconnect the external SSD to keep it safe.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility and run the Sierra installer over the top of the current un-bootable installation.\n\n\nThat should add in all the necessary drivers for the new Macs and it should work again.

Either the colours are off, the image is shifted, the image is briefly simply noise, etc. but it seems to settle down OK after a few seconds on the displays I have and so far has not recurred once the image has \"settled in\".\nI do have one screen (Acer XR341CK, 3440x1440 75Hz) which is detected but shows no image at all when connected via HDMI 2.0 and native resolution is selected (lower refresh rate or resolution works). (It is not detected at all by the 2018 Mac Mini when connected via a USB-C to DisplayPort cable, suggesting the GPU in this Mac somehow doesn't like this display. Update: At some point during the 10.14.x OS update cycle, the display started working without any troubles when connected via a USB-C to DisplayPort adapter.) The same display works as expected on other Macs and indeed when connected to an eGPU on this Mac Mini.\nI believe the reason for this is that the Mac Mini 2018 uses an active HDMI 2.0 converter chip to produce an HDMI 2.0 signal from the GPU's native DisplayPort 1.2 output signal. Without this, the GPU would only be able to output HDMI 1.4 natively, which maxes out at 2560x1600 @ 60Hz or 4K @ 30Hz. Intel's GPUs are woefully out of date in this regard. (HDMI 2.0 supports 4K @ 60Hz)\nThe USB-C to HDMI cable is a fine solution if the above mode restrictions are OK for your display; otherwise, if your display has a DisplayPort input, I recommend trying a USB-C to DisplayPort cable. Apart from that Acer display, this is working fine on all other displays I've tried too, including those that have shown the brief image corruption I mentioned via HDMI.\n\nA: Actually you may have run into something I have run into from time to time with Apple hardware: seemingly good hardware fails or fails intermittently on Apple hardware.\nI have chalked it up variously to \"Apple's high standards,\" \"not completely compatible,\" \"why, Apple, just why?!\"\nIt is most likely just what you have found out, a completely good HDMI cable. And another \"completely good HDMI cable\" may have similar results, fail completely, or work perfectly.\nMe, I'd buy another cable (different brand, with a good return policy) and give that one a try.\nIt could be a problem with the cable or the port on the Mac. But unless it's a really cheap HDMI cable that you can blame on crappy manufacturing in (insert country of choice here) it is merely an inexplicable incompatibility that you may never know the cause of.\n", "Q: Is there a way to encrypt a folder and then only allow certain processes to have access to that folder? I'm aware of technique for creating encrypted folders using disk utility.\nBut I believe once it is unlocked and mounted, any process owned as you or root could read that folder.\nI'm looking for a way to encrypt a folder and then only allow certain procs access.\nHere's a scenario:   Google chrome keeps a directory for cache data, bookmarks, history and the like.\nI'd like to create an encrypted folder for this that is only unlocked for chrome.   And keep it encrypted for any backup software or scanners... things that could potentially be running as root that could override an filesystem perms.\n\nA: As far as I know, there is no such software available on the net. You can turn on EFS encryption for your private folder, but Windows doesn't give you options to grant access rights for different processes, and EFS only works on NTFS partitions.\nThere is a third-party software called Lock My Folders, which works the similar way like EFS, and it lets you create a secure folder to transparently encrypt/decrypt the files inside. But it also lacks the feature of restricting process access to the encrypted folder.\n", "Q: Removing Messages from iCloud (but not locally) How do I remove my Messages from iCloud only?\nI want to keep them on my local devices (where I have plenty of space), but remove them from iCloud (where I'm low on space).\n\nA: First I would turn off Messages in iCloud.\nYou can turn off Messages in iCloud just for this Mac or for all devices where you use it. \nChoose Messages > Preferences, click Accounts, then select iMessage in the Accounts list. \nDeselect “Enable Messages in iCloud.” \nChoose one of the following: \nDisable All: Turns off Messages in iCloud for all your devices.

For setup, we've been dealing with spotlight issues for 4 years on two MacBooks with my wife's files.  We've done all the usual tricks (for example spotlight privacy tab, sudo mdutil -E / ) and they work for a day or a few days but then the problem returns.  I've searched a lot and compiled a ton of links on spotlight (and tricks).\nSpotlight eventually forgets the docx files it indexed. One day a keyword yields 100s of docx results and the next day it yields a couple to none.  The MacOS version is 10.13.6.\nMy current fix is to find all the docx files and force each one to be re-indexed.\nfind /Users/username -name '*.docx' -print0 | xargs -0 mdimport -d1\n\nThis command has it re-index them using the Rich Text importer. Again this works for the day and by the next day searches produce little to no results.\nHas anyone encountered this problem? And found a solution?\n\nA: I was having a similar issue with Numbers files, with them being remembered by Spotlight for varying lengths of time and then being forgotten. Often I had to open files from the 'Open Recent' menu because Spotlight didn't return them. Usually that got them back into the spotlight index, but only temporarily. Perhaps it wasn't only Numbers files, just that those were the ones I'd been searching for.\nIn my case, it turns out that I had very little free disk space. Enough for what I thought of as my storage needs, but apparently not enough for the system to operate correctly.\nI moved 30GB of files to an external drive, emptied the trash, rebooted, ran sudo mdutil -E /, waited for indexing to complete, rebooted again.\nThat was yesterday, and so far so good. Spotlight has returned everything that I've thought to search for. Also, my machine had been getting quite sluggish but now feels quite responsive. I hope this helps you, or others who find this thread.\n[Update: things are better but not solved. There's still some mysterious gaps in my spotlight search results.

Mac computers can not BIOS boot from flash drives. \nIf you have a working optical (DVD) drive, then you should use the drive to install Windows. If your optical drive is broken or missing, the you can still install Windows, but the procedure is fairly complicated. See Installing Windows 7 or 10 Pro 64 bit without DVD or Flash Drive for the procedure.\nSome really old 64 bit Macs can not install 64 bit Windows without first modifying the Windows ISO file to remove the EFI boot method. This only applies when using the optical drive.\nOfficially, your Mac can only run 32 bit version of Windows. This is also true for my 2007 iMac, but I was able to run 64 bit Windows 7 anyway.

For upgrading to Mojave, I had to change my old Nvidia cheap card to a new AMD Radeon Metal 2 support card. I have an IPS monitor and did not change it, but from when I did change the card I feel picture quality is much better and colors are very clear and natural! I an an Elec. Engineer and I know colors are sent using numbers to the monitor (Display Port is a digital interface). So the picture quality AFAIK must not relate to Graphic Card, but just to monitor which has not changed.\nAm I right? Or there is something like color scheme or so that changes my imagination about this topic?\n\nA: DisplayPort is a digital interface, yes. The actual display signal is sent essentially as 0's and 1's in a packetized protocol that ensures that either (1) what is sent by the computer is what is received by the monitor, or (2) the monitors knows that the something is wrong with the signal and will usually just show blank (black) screen.\nIn practice there are some other factors playing into it. DisplayPort comes in various versions supporting various sets of features. In addition DisplayPort supports several transfer speeds, so a \"low quality\" cable might only support slower speeds (i.e. lower resolution, color depth and/or frames per second) compared to a \"high quality\" cable. Beyond this some transfer modes employ a lossy compression, which is commonly referred to as \"visually lossless\" - i.e. in the digital sense you're not getting the exact same data before and after compression/decompression, but to the viewer it looks (almost) the same.\nThat being said, it is not so that the graphics card has no influence on picture quality at all. Nothing could be further from the truth. The programs on the computer are not spitting out DisplayPort packets that the graphics is simply responsible for transferring from the PC to the monitor. The graphics card performs a lot of duties in between the input from the operating system and running applications, and the output to the monitor.\nEssentially an old, low-quality graphics card might for example only offer low resolution, low color depth, few color spaces and color formats, etc. when compared to a newer and/or higher-quality graphics card. When you look at 3D (for games or very graphical applications) there's tonnes of other features that the graphics card might or might not support in various degrees of quality and speeds. These can affect the image quality hugely.\nBesides the above mentioned, you might also experience better quality simply because you had a non-optimal setup/configuration of your old graphics card. Or it might be because the new operating system install contains better drivers.\n", "Q: Keyboard viewer in macOS Mojave dark mode I upgraded to macOS Mojave and switched to dark mode.\nI use Accessibility Keyboard.

If a private key has been world-readable on a multi-user system at any given time, it should be considered as already compromised.\n\nA: it looks like you copied your private key from Windows or from other computer where you used PuTTY. Unfortunately, the ssh command-line tool does not support this key format and therefore you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install PuTTY again (it should exist also on your mac)\n\n*Convert the private key from PuTTY file format to the OpenSSH format (again using PuTTYGen from PuTTY as already described in my previous answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open PuttyGen\n\n*Click Load\n\n*Load your private key\n\n*Go to Conversions->Export OpenSSH and export your private key\n\n*Copy your private key to ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nIf you still see the issues using the new exported key (~/.ssh/id_rsa, make sure that the key is not readable by anyone else but you (it is your private key) by removing all the privileges of all the others by running chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.\n\nA: The error message is displayed because the file permission are set such that it is readable by other users apart from the logged-in user. To overcome the error message, you will need to change the file permissions for the private key such that it is readable only by you.\nTo do that, run the following command in Terminal:\ncd ~/.ssh ; chmod 400 myKey.ppk\nThis will allow only your user to read (and not write and execute) the private key file and prevent everyone else from reading, writing and executing the file.\nThis will take care of the error message shown to you and you should be able to add the private key file all right.\n", "Q: OneDrive for Mac crashes I have a Macbook pro with the Mojave OS 10.14.1  I have installed Onedrive (two accounts, 1 academic and 1 personal) and they used to work fine for more than a year.

As far as I found there is no universal way to get a one-key shortcut. It should be possible to do with Applescript and Alfred 3. Anybody well-versed in this to set it up? Or did I forget a simpler method?\n\nA: System Preferences lets you change builtin menu shortcuts to almost anything you like.  This screen shot is from macOS 10.13 (High Sierra):\n\nHere, you can see that I've created a shortcut under the All Applications heading, so any application that contains the particular menu item that takes its window to full screen will adopt the new shortcut.\nThe name of the menu item—which must be entered exactly, including capitalisation—is Enter Full Screen.  As you know, its default shortcut is ⌃⌘F, but here I've changed it to just the equals sign key, =.\nIf you try to establish a new shortcut to be a single key, you'll often be denied by Finder's beep, alerting you to an invalid command or value.  The trick to circumvent this when creating these shortcuts in System Preferences is to hold down Fn and press the desired key, which will then be accepted.\nYou'll want to create a second shortcut to take your application out of fullscreen and into normal mode again.  This menu item is called Exit Full Screen, and by default, shares the same shortcut as its cousin, therefore it makes sense that your new shortcut should be the same as the one you set to Enter Full Screen also.\nWith the setup in place as depicted by my screenshot, a single tap of my = key takes me fullscreen; and another tap takes me back out into normal view.  Cleverly, testing this in Safari, it doesn't respond to this shortcut whilst I'm typing in this text box, which is how I am still able to print an equals sign, =.  Once I leave the text box and the focus returns to a non-input element of the Safari window, the shortcut becomes active again.  I haven't tested to see whether this neat feature applies to other applications.  I suspect it will work for some, and won't for others.\n", "Q: Is my hard drive missing if a iMac 2011 purchased at a garage sale boots up with a flashing grey question mark?

I have a two-disk NAS in RAID 1 that's not cooperating. I tried taking one of the disks out and plugging it into my iMac via a USB enclosure to copy the files off of it, but MacOS can't read the disk. I assume it's probably Ext3 or Ext4, some kind of Linux format. How can I get the files off of the disk?\n\nA: Linux is very flexible when it comes to filesystem formats and disk setups.\nThe most common problem you will encounter is the most popular filesystem for Linux: ext4, which is of course not supported by Apple under macOS.\nTo gain access to these filesystems, you need either \nOSXFuse and a slow implementation of read-only access (eg ext4fuse, eg via macports or homebrew) or the commercial Paragon ExtFS.\nA great many more exotic filesystem setups cannnot be dealt with from within macOS. \nA more convoluted but more flexible solution method might involve either booting your Mac into Linux and copy the files or using a Virtual Machine that runs Linux to extcrat the files.\nVirtual Box usually can handle USB (provided the settings are right) and most Linux installations from within there as well (again: settings). The Linux installation needs support for the actual filesystem (mainstream distributions usually do.) As the RAID was 1 aka mirroring, one of the disks should then be readable.\n", "Q: Is there a way to resize Dock in macOS using keyboard shortcuts? I would like to be able to resize the Dock in macOS strictly using  keybindings. Ideally, this would be incrementally and work similar to the way that volume/brightness increase/decrease keys work.\nI use BetterTouchTool for most of my gesture/shortcut customizations, and I have been able to achieve just about everything I've needed with it, but this is one thing I've yet to figure out.\nHas anyone ever successfully achieved this? If so, what was your approach (software, tools, etc.)?\n\nA: The approach I ended up taking was a variation of @Paolo's solution, and is simple to implement using a tool like BetterTouchTool (as @blizzrdof77 mentions in his original question). \nInstead of preparing two AppleScripts, this single script takes one argument - a numeric value between -1.5 and 1.5 - which determines whether the dock will increase or decrease in size. \nThe AppleScript:\nCreate a new file called \"change-dock-size.applescript\" with the following content:\n\non run argv\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        -- Get dock size\n        set docksize to dock size of dock preferences\n        -- Increase or decrease based on argument version\n        set docksize to docksize + (item 1 of argv)\n        -- Constrain value to 0.1 -- 1.5\n        if docksize > 1.5 then docksize = 1.5\n        if docksize < 0.1 then docksize = 0.1\n        -- Set dock to the new size\n        set dock size of dock preferences to docksize\n    end tell\nend run\n\n\nRunning It From The Command Line:\nYou can run this from the command line using osascript - like this: \n\n# Increase Dock Size\nosascript /path/to/script/change-dock-size.applescript 0.01\n# Decrease Dock Size\nosascript /path/to/script/change-dock-size.applescript -0.01\n\nAdding Keybindings to BetterTouchTool:\nTo use this in BTT, add two new shortcuts with the \"Execute Terminal Command\" action, and use the above examples as the commands (I've provided a screenshot of my setup below). I hope this helps!\n\n\n\nA: First you have to prepare two AppleScripts, one to increase the size of the Dock and one to decrease.\nYou may run AppleScript Editor, write and test them.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    -- get dock size (decimal in range 0 -- 1)\n    set docksize to dock size of dock preferences\n\n    -- increase version\n    set docksize to docksize + 0.05\n\n    -- decrease version (commented)\n    -- set docksize to docksize - 0.05\n\n    -- constrain value to 0.1 -- 1.0\n\n    if docksize > 1 then docksize = 1\n    if docksize < 0.1 then docksize = 0.1\n\n    -- set dock size\n    set dock size of dock preferences to docksize\nend tell\n\nThe dock size is a value ranging from 0 to 1.\nThe above script increases / decreases the size by 0.05 steps.\nYou may choose a different formula according to your needs.\n\nThe next steps are\n\n\n*\n\n*Create and save a new service with Automator that run an AppleScript\n\n*Assign a keyboard shortcut to the service created via System Preferences\nDo it twice: for the increase and decrease shortcut.\n\nWhen you create the services with Automator the AppleScripts run are the ones you prepared for increase/decrease the Dock size.\n\nInstructions on how to create the service and assign an AppleScript to run are here:\nHow do I assign a keyboard shortcut to an AppleScript I wrote?\n\nBottom note:\nSome suggested in the comments to resize the dock by issuing the following terminal commands\ndefaults write com.apple.dock tilesize -int 32; killall Dock\nso I did in the first version of this answer.\nHowever this approach involves restarting the Dock application with several drawbacks.\nAs user3439894 suggested the Dock may be resized via AppleScript using System Events. This way the action takes place faster and more gracefully, so I updated my answer.\n", "Q: Mac Excel won't recognize Spanish/Portuguese accents (UTF8 or ANSI) I'm working with Excel to open a delimited (tabbed) txt file that contains Portuguese and Spanish accents.

As an example in the image, the sheet has two columns with URLs. What I need to do is find the rows that have the same URL in the two adjacent cells and then change the background color of that row so I can identify the rows and delete them; or write the word \"dupe\" to column C. In the example, row 4 has the same URL the two cells. How would I flag or mark rows like that in the entire sheet? With a calculation? Or an Applescript/Automator?\n\n\nA: Here is an AppleScript method, which demonstrates three different types of action taken upon the rows with duplicate cell entries in columns \"A\" and \"B\" (equivalent to cells 1 and 2):\nuse N : application \"Numbers\"\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# PROPERTY VALUES & GLOBAL VARIABLES\nproperty document : a reference to document 1 of N\nproperty sheet : a reference to active sheet of my document\nproperty table : a reference to table 1 of my sheet\n\nglobal them\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# IMPLEMENTATION:\non run\n    if not (exists my table) then return false\n\n    set them to a reference to (every row of my table ¬\n        where the value of cell 1 = the value of cell 2 ¬\n        and the value of cell 1 ≠ missing value)\n\n    highlight()\n    ---OR:\n    -- comment()\n    --OR:\n    -- delete -- WARNING: permanent!\nend run\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# HANDLERS:\nto highlight()\n    set the background color of them to ¬\n        {65535, 65535 / 4, 65535 / 2}\nend highlight\n\nto delete\n    delete them\nend delete\n\nto comment()\n    set the value of cell 3 of them to \"SNAP!\"\nend comment\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------❮END❯\n\nI've defined three handlers, highlight(), comment(), and delete, each of which, if called, will perform a particular action upon the rows of interest.  Currently, you can see in the script a few lines within the section labelled IMPLEMENTATION: that I've set it currently to perform the highlight() action, which will change the particular rows' background colour to a shade of pink I like.\nBelow that line are commands that I have commented out using --, so currently they remain inert.  When uncommented, the comment() handler will enter the word \"SNAP!\" into the third column of each row of interest; and the delete command (note the lack of parentheses for this one) will simply delete the rows completely.

My macbook pro early 2011 says its drive is failing its S.M.A.R.T. test. It said to repair disk in recovery mode. I've attempted it twice. It doesn't seem to change the situation. \n      Could the recent installation of MacPilot  and making changes to settings be causing a problem or causing the appearance of a mock problem? \n\nA: If a SMART test indicates the drive is failing [& that test is accurate - you could use two independent tools to make sure they agree] then the drive is toast & needs to be backed up if possible & replaced immediately.\nSMART is meant to warn you of imminent, potentially catastrophic, drive failure.\nIt is not a \"fixable\" problem.\n\nA: SMART tests are tests that are done at the hard disk level. The hard disk firmware (which is on the board of the disk itself) runs a set of diagnostics on the disk regularly, and if any failures are detected, the results are signalled to the computer using SMART.\nThe usual recommendation is to back up the disk's contents as soon as possible (if you care about the contents of the disk) and replace the disk before it fails completely.

So you should upgrade to the latest macOS version available i.e. macOS Mojave.\n\nA: I have been using APFS on an external HDD for both High Sierra and Mojave for quite a while now. However, I have never converted a filesystem with macOS installed to APFS. In other words, I have always formatted a partition to APFS before installing macOS. Although, I do not foresee any problems with converting to APFS after macOS is installed.\nYou do not mention in your question if you are using Core Storage, encryption or a Fusion drive. \nDo do not think there ever was a requirement that APFS was restricted to SSD.

A Decent piece of hardware, but alas, one thing really sucks: \n\n\n*\n\n*When I come back from a break, and screen lock kicked in\n\n*I press a key on my keyboard: my older lenovo monitor immediately goes from black blank to my background image, but the AOC just sits there blank, black. For 10 seconds, 20 seconds. \n\n*Most of the time, the Lenovo monitor turned black already again. When I press keys on the keyboard again, then finally the AOC tells about HDMI signal, and then shows my background image and I enter my password and log in.\n\n\nIn other words: there is a terrible lag before the monitor goes \"alive\" (10 to 20 seconds at least). Any idea anybody what I could do to change this behavior?\n( for the record: both monitors are connected to my Mac Book Pro 2017 using a Lenovo ThinkPad TB3 dock, and this is not a duplicate of my own question, that one was about an external monitor never going alive )\n\nA: That Lenovo TB3 box has 2 DP (display port) and one HDMI port:\n\n( picture from here )\nI simply switched ports, from DP2 to DP1, and using the first port, there is (almost) no more lag any more!\nAnd as reference for future readers: if you intend to connect two monitors to this Lenovo TB3 dock: the second monitor has to be connected using the USB-C port on the front of the box. When you plug two monitors on the \"back\" of the dock, they will show the same content (like only \"mirroring\" is possible). \nUpdate: \nI figured a bit later that yes, switching the port did help, but only to a certain degree bit. A slightly better \"solution\" boils down to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*when I come back, and both displays are black, I click my mouse once\n\n*I count to five, I hit ESC on the keyboard\n\n*I count to five again, and click my mouse again\n\n\nWhat that does is: (almost) reliably get met to \"both displays awake at the same time\". \n( I basically noticed that clicking the mouse will wake up display 1 quickly, and when putting it back to sleep with ESC, the next mouse click will wake up both displays ) \nAnother update:\nSince upgrading to Catalina, no more workarounds required. display 2 still has a lag, but I simply enter my password, display 1 turns on, display 2 follows 2, 3 seconds later. Reliably. At least for now.\n", "Q: Add a button in the Finder toolbar How can I add a button in the Finder toolbar? I don't use the dropdown menu.

I am looking for an app locker. I tried searching on the App Store, found various app locker apps but none of them works.\nIs there any method to lock my apps?\n\nA: The said functionality is neither built into iOS natively (unlike some Android phones), nor is it available via any 3rd party apps.\nHowever, certain apps which deal with sensitive content give you the ability to restrict access partially or totally via Touch ID/Face ID authentication. Common examples include banking, financial data management, password manager apps etc.\nPartial restriction entails requiring successful authentication when accessing sensitive parts of an app (such as when authorizing a purchase on the App Store). Total restriction entail requiring successful authentication every time when accessing the app (accessing a password manager app).\nTotal restriction is very similar functionally to app locker feature offered in some Android devices either natively or via a 3rd party app.\nTo learn more about Touch ID and Face ID, refer to these links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Touch ID on iPhone and iPad\n\n*Use Face ID on your iPhone or iPad Pro\nA good number of built-in and 3rd party app support Touch ID/Face ID authentication. You can also search for apps catering to specific required feature (hiding sensitive photos, videos, notes) with support for Touch ID/Face ID authentication to access content.\nLook for Touch ID/Face ID support in an app when going through its description or settings. Apple's Notes app for example lets your lock certain notes with Touch ID. 1Password - Password Manager for iOS offers total restriction and asks for authentication every time you try to access the app (very similar to app locker functionality).\n", "Q: iPhone 6s battery issues My iPhone 6s sometimes suddenly goes to 1 - 10% and sometimes 70 - 80% after restarting.

Should I go to some repairing shop or sell it?\nI have seen so many question like this but non of them are giving a correct answer for my problem. I've never experienced this type of issue in my any phone but iPhone 6s is not working fine for me.\nHere are few problems that I am facing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Battery automatically goes down in few minutes.\n\n*Auto-Restart.\n\n*Freeze sometimes.\n\nA: A reasonable explanation would be that the battery of your iPhone has come of age. Try to access the battery health (completed charge cycles, charge holding capacity etc.) using a popular battery assessment tool called coconutBattery.\nBatteries has a fixed number of charge cycles and post consuming them, the charge holding capacity deteriorates.\nIt is also advisable to keep the iOS software up-to-date. Having it up-to-date alleviates any software related glitches that may be causing trouble with the hardware/battery.\nPost analysis, if you feel that the battery is showing signs of going kaput, you can choose to go for a replacement.\n", "Q: Downloading issue with safari While downloading any file from safari on Macbook Air, If downloading is paused due to any reason like internet access lost..etc, I am imposed to restart the downloading process rather than resuming.\nis there any solution?\n\nA: It is sometimes possible to resume downloads in Safari. Click the download icon in the toolbar, and check the color of the \"↻\" icon. If the icon is gray, just click it to resume the download. However, if the icon is orange, do not click it, as Safari will delete the partially downloaded data and restart the download from scratch.\nWhen Safari cannot resume a download, it is usually possible to resume it with curl instead. I do this so often, I actually made an Automator workflow to expedite the process.\nhttps://github.com/Wowfunhappy/Automator-Quick-Actions/blob/master/Resume%20Download.workflow.zip?raw=true\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract the zip file\n\n*Double click the .workflow and install it.\n\n\nThe next time a Safari download fails in the middle:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the recent download list in Safari. If applicable, click the \"x\" to fully cancel the download, and then click the magnifying glass to reveal it in Finder. DO NOT click the orange retry (\"↻\") button; doing so will delete all partially downloaded data.\n\n*In Finder, right click on the partially downloaded file and select either Resume Download or Services → Resume Download.\n\n*Wait for the percentage in the terminal window to reach 100%. Note that this percentage does not include the part of the file that was downloaded previously, so it will always start at 0. If the download fails again, resume it again by focusing on the terminal window, hitting the up arrow key, and then the enter key.\n\n\nNot all downloads can be resumed this way—some servers make it technically impossible—but in my experience it usually works.\n\nA: Hifsa, it is always best to indicate what versions of macOS you have and also what specific model of Mac you have when asking a question here. It is often necessary to have that information to provide a (potential) solution. Both are available under the Apple Menu by selecting \"About this Mac.\"\nThat said if a download does not complete you can click on the download icon in the Safari Toolbar and get a list of recent downloads. If the download failed for whatever reason there will be a light gray circular icon to the right of the file name that you can click on to resume the download.\nIt will depend on why the download failed as to whether or not the download will resume or start over. I have seen both behaviors on Macs in a variety of macOS versions with little or no understanding of why some you can pick up where you left off and some require you to start over from scratch.\n", "Q: iPad Pro 11\" keyboard case stops working when screen is laid flat against the back sleeve i just spent an hour troubleshooting and rebooting my new iPad and then time with support online only to realize it will only work in stand up mode ? \ni don't like to stand it up because the angle is way too steep for a tall person. \nis there a reason why it stops working as soon the screen is flat against the back of the case ? \n\ni tried to post this on discussions.apple.com but it kept giving me the super descriptive \"You are not allowed to create or update this content\" error.\n\nA: The previous generation 10.5\" has this same limitation.

In the popup menu, I see another calendar listed under \"On My Mac\" that is a (seemingly) random 10-digit number. \nI would like to know how to delete this mystery calendar.\nI can add events to this calendar, but it never shows up in the lefthand sidebar. I've checked the accounts that pipe into my Calendar.app (Exchange, Google) and don't see this mystery calendar anywhere.\n\nThanks!\n\nA: This is bit complicated but the only way I know it.\nOpen ~/Library/Calendars\nLeave it open.\nOpen Calendar > Preferences and set your weird numbers calendar as default.\nNow add New event to it.\nGo back to the ~/Library/Calendars and look which files (by date/time has changed. That is the one to delete.\nDo not forget to change the Default back to your choosing.\n\nA: @Buscar웃 pointed me in the right direction. I have upvoted that answer.\nDisclaimer: I'm no Calendar.app expert. Please don't follow these directions if you're uncertain of how your calendar events are stored and you don't want to accidentally delete something that's unrecoverable.\nOpen ~/Library/Calendars in Finder and keep it open.\nLook at the list of folders that it contains. There will be a folder for each calendar. These folders are named with a random string at the beginning followed by a dot and an abbreviation that represents the type of service used for that calendar. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*.caldav\n\n*.calendar\n\n*.exchange\n\n\nIn my case, I knew that the mystery calendar would be one of the folders that contains \".calendar\" in the directory name. Go in to each one of those folders and look at the contents of its Events directory. You will see a list of .ics files. Selecting one of those .ics files will show you a Finder preview of the file, which actually allowed me to see the name of the event that it represented.\nSo, go to your calendar, and add an event to the mystery calendar. Name the new event something silly that you know is a unique name for an event. I used \"Fizzle\".\nNow open Terminal (or other) and go to the same directory you have open in Finder:\n$ cd ~/Library/Calendar\n\nUse grep to search for the name of the new event.\n$ grep -r \"Fizzle\" ./*\n\nHopefully you'll get only one result that will show you the full path to the .ics that contains an event named \"Fizzle\".\nUse Finder to locate the top-level directory for that calendar. Delete that directory. You'll also need to delete Calendar's cache files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Calendar Cache\n\n*Calendar Cache-shm\n\n*Calendar Cache-wal\n\n\nQuit and reopen Calendar. The mystery calendar should no longer be available.\n", "Q: Time Machine: first backup keeps growing while backing up, never completes I'm trying to use Time Machine for backups on an AirPort Time Capsule.

On the iPhone you might have to erase the account in the case of Mail or Thunderbird application.\n\n*Connect with this culprit equipment and make an explicit connection with the culprit application, and make sure you enter your correct password.

This display is always connected to my mac.\nOccasionally I will also connect a thunderbolt 3 external touch display for work. Up until today, that display was always considered display #3 and wouldn't affect the icon or window placement of either of my other two displays.\nHowever, today I booted up my system with the external thunderbolt 3 display connected, and now macOS considers it to be display #2 as long as it's connected. All of my carefully arranged desktop icons that used to be on my DisplayPort external display now get kicked over to this thunderbolt 3 display. If I disconnect it, the DisplayPort display becomes display #2 again and the icons reset. It's very annoying!\nI haven't found anything I can do to reset this behavior. How can I get my displays back to working the way they were before, with the thunderbolt 3 display always being display #3?\n\nA: I've found one solution to this: reseting my mac's NVRAM. This seems to reset the order of my monitors to how it was before. However, if I leave my Thunderbolt 3 display connected while booting my mac, the problem will come back again.\nI'll wait a while before marking my own answer as the accepted solution to this question since a) it's not a particularly good solution, and b) I'd like to give other people a chance to post a better one.\n", "Q: How to use new Facebook Portal to call iPhone X How do I connect my iPhone X to the new Facebook Portal so that Portal can call my iPhone and for that matter my iPad.

It has 4 USB A sockets on one side and 2 on the other. Its point is to share the 4 things plugged in on one side with 2 computers. I've been using it with a 2014 Macbook Pro and a 2017 Razer Blade sharing a keyboard, mouse, and USB ethernet adaptor for the last 3 months.\nToday I got a late 2018 Macbook Air. I tried connecting it to the same switch but it's not working and so I'm wondering where the issue is. It could be\n\n\n*\n\n*Bad cables. I'm using USB C to USB A cables. I've used these cables for other things in the past. I tried 2 3 different cables. An Anker Cable, a TacMad cable, and a Elecom USB3-AC15 USB 3.1 cable. All 3 cables work fine for other USB devices\n\n*Wrong cables? Maybe there is more than one kind of USB-C to USB-A cable?\n\n*Bad Switch. The switch works but maybe something is incompatible?\n\n*This isn't supposed to work. I have no idea but maybe there is something about USB-C that makes it just not suppose to work\n\n*???\nTo add to that I have a VANMASS 9-in-1 USB HUB. If I plug that between the switch and the macbook air everything works. In other words\n[2014 MBP]<---------USB-A-USB-A-cable--------->[USB Switch]<->[Mouse] works\n\n[2018 MBA]<---------USB-C-USB-A-cable--------->[USB Switch]<->[Mouse] doesn't work\n\n[2018 MBA]<->[USB Hub]<---USB-A-USB-A-cable--->[USB Switch]<->[Mouse] works\n\nNote that this is both without and with external power to the switch. Without power the switch doesn't light up (it does with the MBP and Razer). With power it does light up and pressing the button on the switch switches the LED indicator on top of the switch but the MacBook Air still doesn't see the mouse and keyboard without the hub in between\nI'd like to not need the hub. It seems like I should be able to connect the Macbook Air directly to the switch just like I was doing with the Macbook Pro\nAny idea what the issue is?\n\nA: In my investigations, I have found that for a switch to work successfully, it needs to be connected to a USB hub. Even the Apple USB/HDMI to USB-C adapter will do.\nAlso, plugging a USB switch after the KVM switch helps to deal with some devices (My USB mic) that seem to cause trouble when directly plugged into the KVM switch.\nThe two switches I have experimented with are the USB3.0 4 port 2 way KVM from UGreen and a similar one from Belkin. (No HDMI, only USB switching)\nIt is a little finicky, and I am not sure why. The same switch works flawlessly between by Thinkpad and Desktop (Windows)\nHope this helps.\nThis is what my ioreg -p IOUSB currently looks like:\n+-o Root  <class IORegistryEntry, id 0x100000100, retain 23>\n  +-o AppleUSBXHCI Root Hub Simulation@00000000  <class AppleUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x100000405, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 13>\n  | +-o USB 10/100/1000 LAN@00200000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000407, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 14>\n  | +-o USB3.1 Hub@00100000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x1000019d1, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 12>\n  +-o AppleUSBXHCI Root Hub Simulation@01000000  <class AppleUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x100000418, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 8>\n  +-o AppleUSBVHCIBCE Root Hub Simulation@80000000  <class AppleUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x100000433, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 15>\n  | +-o FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in)@80200000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000435, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 14>\n  | +-o Apple T2 Controller@80100000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000439, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 13>\n  | +-o Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad@80500000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000440, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (1 ms), retain 20>\n  | +-o Headset@80400000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000446, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 11>\n  | +-o Touch Bar Display@80600000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x10000044a, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 13>\n  | +-o Ambient Light Sensor@80300000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x10000044e, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 11>\n  | +-o Touch Bar Backlight@80700000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000456, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 11>\n  +-o AppleUSBXHCI Root Hub Simulation@14000000  <class AppleUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x10000046a, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 9>\n    +-o USB2.0 Hub@14100000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x1000019be, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (0 ms), retain 14>\n      +-o USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter@14120000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x1000019e2, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (3 ms), retain 12>\n      +-o USB2.0 Hub@14110000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100002349, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (1 ms), retain 14>\n        +-o IOUSBHostDevice@14114000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100002364, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (1 ms), retain 14>\n        | +-o HHKB Professional@14114100  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100002378, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (3 ms), retain 12>\n        | +-o USB Receiver@14114300  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x10000238b, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (6 ms), retain 16>\n        +-o USB2.0 Hub@14111000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x1000023ed, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (1 ms), retain 15>\n          +-o Samson GoMic@14111100  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100002405, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (11 ms), retain 18>\n          +-o HD Pro Webcam C920@14111200  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100002454, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (13 ms), retain 19>\n          +-o Flash Drive@14111300  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100002f5a, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (4 ms), retain 12>\n\nThe USB-C Digital AV Multiport (at address 0x1000019e2) was necessary for the switch to function.

Even so I think I found all I need to know about it from this.\n\nIt has 4 USB A sockets on one side and 2 on the other.\n\nNo wonder it doesn't work, it's using USB-A ports as inputs.\nThe USB-A port is not to be used as an input, doing so can damage USB hardware that complies with the USB specification.  The switch, and any cables that came with it, are non-compliant with the USB spec and continued use is running the risk of damaging something far more valuable than the USB switch.  I know you don't want to hear this but that USB switch is junk, throw it away.  It will not work with any USB compliant cables you will find.  Looking for non-compliant cables to work with this switch means buying cables that can damage anything that complies with the spec.  I'll take this point by point.\n\nBad cables.\n\nYour new cables sound fine, the cables that came with the switch are \"bad\", they were built in a way that violates the USB spec.  They had to in order to use USB-A as an input on the switch.\n\nWrong cables? Maybe there is more than one kind of USB-C to USB-A\ncable?\n\nThere is more than one kind of USB-C to USB-A cable.  The kind you want have the USB trident icon on them.  It's not illegal to make a cable that does not comply withe the USB spec.  It is illegal to not comply with the spec and use the trademark on the cable without permission.\nThere is no \"right\" cable for this switch because a compliant cable will not work and the cable that will work is non-compliant.  Once this switch is gone then that means looking for the right cables for what replaces it, and that's not known until you find a replacement.\n\nBad Switch. The switch works but maybe something is incompatible?\n\nThe switch is incompatible with the USB spec.  That makes it \"bad\" in my mind.\n\nThis isn't supposed to work.\n\nIt's not likely to work, whether it is supposed to or not.\n\n???\n\nIndeed.  It's a big question on how this got passed any QC checks.  Get rid of the USB switch and all cables it came with, they do not comply with the USB spec and can damage hardware that does comply.\nIf you are using this USB switch to share a keyboard, mouse, and ethernet then it sounds like you need a KVM switch, not a USB switch.  KVM means \"keyboard, video, mouse\" and are common for when people want to use two computers on one desk.  If you are switching USB and video separately then a KVM switch will save on that.  If you must share the Ethernet adapter then look for a KVM switch with USB accessory ports.

The apps are listed in order of purchase with most recent purchase shown on top (just like older design of the Mac App Store).\n\nDownload progress is also shown on the specific app page in Mac App Store.\n\nHowever, Mac App Store has adopted iOS style of circular progress bar to show the installation progress which doesn't show the app data downloaded and the total size.\nAs an alternative measure, you can launch Launchpad.app (by clicking on its icon in Dock, searching in Spotlight or from Applications folder) and still see the progress in terms of data downloaded and total size just below the app icon.\n\n\nA: The details of downloads is available in the console app as well as if you use a shell to tail he contents of the install log file. The level of detail is excellent, progress and time estimates are given quite regularly.\n tail -f /var/log/install.log\n\nThe other answers to use the graphical interface all match the text based data from this source and logging process.\nIn the Console app, search for 'storedownload' to filter by progress messages. This is where progress status is logged fairly verbosely by default. The last 10% appears to be reserved for the local installation process.\n\nA: I was similarly unable to find active download progress. The unlabeled circular progress bar was not cutting it.\nI finally found that the download progress is shown if you hover on the Launchpad dock icon:\n\n", "Q: How to get calendar invites to come in as iCal and not as Google Calendar invites? I use my Gmail email-address as my Apple ID. When people send me calendar invites, I only receive them on Google Calendar. And since I deactivated the calendar on my Macs for Gmail account, I don't get notified at all (besides an email).\nIs there a way to receive the invitations on iCal instead? Or do I have to use a non-Google address as my Apple ID?\n\nA: \nOr do I have to use a non-Google address as my Apple ID?\n\nNo, you need not change or create a new Apple ID. A calendar invite sent to an email address registered with Gmail will automatically get added to Google Calendar.

I thought this would be straightfoward since I'm not a pf newbie, but perhaps there is something to be learned about pf, or if not, about the combination under MacOS.\nEssentially, I'm trying to add a pf rule that allows (TCP) traffic to a specific port (say 9999), from a specific subnet (say 192.168.5.0/24).  Eventually on the Mac, the applciation in question will be a java process listening, hence my desire to limit the exposure over just allowing the Application Firewall to accept traffic from anywhere destined for java.    In it's place, for experimentation, I'm using netcat (nc).  \nIn System Preferences, I've of course enabled the application firewall, turned on (\"Enable Stealth Mode\"), and ensured that pf is enabled.   I then loaded additional rules into pf, but I when the application is blocked (/usr/bin/nc in this case), it appears as if my pf rules are never used.   A sample transcript to show my current state:\nmac $ alias apf=/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw\nmac $ apf --getglobalstate\nFirewall is enabled. (State = 1)\nmac $ apf --getstealthmode\nStealth mode enabled\nmac $ apf --getappblocked /usr/bin/nc\nIncoming connection to /usr/bin/nc is blocked\nmac $ sudo pfctl -s info |& grep ^Status\nStatus: Enabled for 0 days 21:52:31           Debug: Urgent\nmac $ sudo pfctl -s rules\npass in quick proto tcp from any to any port = 9999 flags S/SA keep state\nscrub-anchor \"com.apple/*\" all fragment reassemble\nanchor \"com.apple/*\" all\nmac $\n\nAt this point it looks like I should be able to start nc listening and connect from another machine, as in:\nmac $ nc -l 9999\n\nlinux $ nc -v -w 1 mac 9999\nnc: connect to mac port 9999 (tcp) failed: Operation timed out\n\nSo, hypotheses and questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*apf takes precedence over pf, in which case, (Q) how do I change or work around that?\n\n*I can't block the application in apf and allow some ports in via pf; see (Q) above.\n\n*pf rules are not really interpreted the same way on MacOS as, say, FreeBSD; then: (Q) why not?\n\n*I don't understand enough and I'm really just a newbie, hence, (Q) what don't I know?\n\n\nA: \napf takes precedence over pf, in which case, (Q) how do I change or work around that?\n\nIt's not about precedence; it's logical AND — those firewalls are independent to each other and you're invoking both of them. Even if Pf won't block connections you have specifically verified that socketfilterfw won't pass it.\n", "Q: How to properly use scaling on an external display (from MacBook Pro 2016)? I have a MacBook Pro 2016 (with Thunderbolt 3 ports on macOS 10.13.6) and I need an external display. \nI bought an ASUS VP28U (4K), connected it with an HDMI to USB-C adapter and, generally, it works. The problem is that everything is super-small, I guess because of the 4K. \nWhy doesn’t this display have any scaling option? \nor...\nHow can I adjust the scaling of an external display while still using the full 4K resolution quality? \nThe only options given to me were to reduce it to 1080p, with obvious results...\nAm I making something wrong? Using the wrong cables? Missing some options?\nOr is the display a bad one?\nAnyone with experience with my same configuration may help in sharing his setup?\nThank you\n\nA: I tried RDM and SwitchResX but wasn't able to get a non-blurry scaled resolution for my display (1440p, HDMI).\nBut, now there is a new tool available: Github - BetterDummy. It handles all this much better by simulating a display with a certain aspect ratio that can then be duplicated on the actual display in the system settings (something some people achieved by buying actual 4k HDMI adapters in the past). This enables scaled \"retina\" resolutions for any display as far as I know.\nAlso, both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs are supported as well as macOS Monterey.\n\nSee the README on Github for a more detailed explanation and any updates.\n\nA: You want something like this, right?!\n\nMain ways to get this result:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a Mini Display Port (i.e. thunderbolt) to DisplayPort connector, not an HDMI to HDMI connector - you will likely see a lot more available resolutions (i.e. everything above 1920x1080 aka 1080p) if you have a hi-res (e.g. 4k) monitor\n\n*Use SwitchResX. It is quite fiddly to use, but it opens up a bunch of resolutions which your monitor supports but which Mac OS hides by default\n\n\n*\n\n*You can also use it to add additional Scaled resolutions (same as scaling on your retina display, i.e. they don't change the available underlying screen resolutions, but they do change the apparent space on the screen)\n\n*And you can even add Custom screen resolutions, but these are super-advanced and probably not what you need!\n\n\n*A simpler rough equivalent to SwitchResX, but it won't give you as many options, is RDM which can be installed via a download linked from the GitHub page, or via Brew (brew install avibrazil-rdm).\n\n\nThe above lets you have a LOT more control over the real estate on your external monitor, and then - as you no doubt already know - you can also scale the internal MacBook LCD display:\n\nCombine these. Try dragging some medium size window back and forth between the external monitor and the laptop screen - using all the above, you should be able to find scaling settings which make the sizes match while still giving you a lot of space for your app windows, so no cursor jumps!\nPS This repeats this answer, since I believe the same info applies to both open questions.\n\nA: I needed to option-click (⌥ on keyboard) Scaled to make 1920 x 1080[sic] available and select it to get the a different size scaling.\nNote:\nI cannot recommend 1080p which rendered unsharp, nor any setting with 'low resolution' except for the small but crispy clear 3860x2160 (low resolution)\nActually very counter-intuitive, indeed.\n\nA: You need to set it to 1080p in order to get the scaling. A bit counter-intuitive this actually means that the display is using the full 4k resolution, but font sizes, window decorations, etc. is scaled to have the same size as with a 1080p display. This is what Apple calls \"Retina Mode\": Video, photos, etc. will display in their full resolution.\nSo try setting it to 1080p and then check on your monitor's on screen display that the incoming signal is actually 4k!\nNote that the list of resolution in System Preferences > Display will also contain resolutions such as \"1920 x 1080 (low resolution)\". The added \"(low resolution)\" means that these are actual 1920x1080 resolutions, and not scaled like in Retina Mode.\nIf you do not see the list of resolutions, then hold down the Option-key and click the \"Scaled\" radio-button besides \"Resolution:\".\n\nA: I had the same problem, so I used a new ANKER USB-C-to-HDMI adapter and it worked.\n", "Q: How to set the file order (arrangement) permanently in Finder?

I installed sleepwatcher to run ~/.sleep before my computer goes to sleep.\nI need to unmount /Volumes/Backup before my computer falls asleep. If I forget to do it, I get a message telling me that I unsafely unmounted the drive, etc. when the computer resumes. It's a rare external Seagate drive glitch. Lucky me. \nSo I am trying to remedy the problem with Sleepwatcher by unmounting the drive before the system sleeps. Obviously sudo and the password it requires is standing in my way. \nAny ideas?\nI can't use the echo \"password\" | sudo -S xx xx method because my password contains a dollar ($) sign,  So I need another form of injection.\nIf I remove the password requirement from /etc/sudoers, the system becomes very insecure. \nSo any creative ideas? \n\nA: You don't need sudo to unmount a drive.\nUse diskutil\nThe following command ejects the volume Backup:\ndiskutil eject /Volumes/Backup\n\nThis should do it, although (IIRC) you might want…\ndiskutil unmount /Volumes/Backup\n\n…to make it easier to re-mount without having to physically disconnect/reconnect the drive.\nEjecting All Disks\nIf you want to make sure you have ejected all of your disks, you can try this:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to eject (every disk whose ejectable is true)'\n\nThird Party Tool: Mountain\nThere is also Mountain which will automate this for you.\nThird Party Tool: Keyboard Maestro\nAbove all other ideas, I would recommend Keyboard Maestro which can do all of these things on sleep, and remount your drive on wake, plus 1,000 other things. \n\nA: You can have a \"$\" in your echo statement, you just have to escape it.\n$ echo \"$abc123\"\n                         <-----Results in a blank line\n\nHowever\n$ echo \"\\$abc123\"\n$abc123                  <-----Works\n\nAlso, instead of using double quotes, use single quotes to encapsulate your string:\n$echo '$abc123'\n$abc123                  <-----Works\n\nBasically, what's happening is that within double quotes (\"), it preserves the literal values of the characters with the exception of the dollar sign (\"$\"), the tilde (\"~\"), and the back slash (\"\\\").    When you enclose your text within a single quote ('), it preserves all characters, period.\nModify Your sudoers file.\nWith that cleared up, don't save/use passwords in clear text in your script as it's equally insecure!\nInstead, what you should do is modify your sudoers file so that you grant \"no password\" access to that command only.\nusername ALL = (ALL) ALL\nusername ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /path/to/foo/bar/command\n\nWith this method, you leave your system security intact and allow for the use of sudo with no password for this one particular command.\n", "Q: Is there a way to re-enable \"old-style\" quit in Chrome?

You can for example just wave your hand about to get a \"stand hour\" and I've noticed move data increasing while in the car. \nThis is not a problem specific to Apple Watch though, all other fitness trackers I have had given similar issues. I think generally it will get better over subsequent OS releases as the AI is further trained and improved.

I was just wondering if you can somehow know that and if you can give me an example of such \"tool\" that can record/spy on the host actions. \nIs it possible to detect that some text was copied/moved to a file/e-mail/website in host OS (macOS)?\n\nA: No, it is not in general possible to detect whether a file or a text message has been copied from a virtual machine to a Windows or Mac computer.\nAn adversary could do this undetected even through such means as OCR'ing (optical character recognition) the text on the virtual display. The virtual machine cannot in any way detect whether it is a normal human being looking at the display, or it is a program that is silently recognising and copying text.\nFiles can also be copied by the host machine accessing the underlying disk storage directly without giving the guest virtual machine any way of detecting that the file system has been accessed, and file contents copied.\n", "Q: Can I rename the \"Pictures\" folder without \"Full Disk Access\"? Our application needs write access to the user's Home directory, specifically to Pictures, Movies, Music, etc., so it can redirect them to our cloud support. But, on Mojave, renaming Pictures (to some back-up folder) fails with EPERM without the Full Disk Access right, which seems too much and too hard to acquire (cf \"Unfortunately, Apple has intentionally designed the process of granting Full Disk Access to be difficult, so that users are discouraged from granting Full Disk Access unless absolutely necessary.\" seen here). Is there another way ?\n\nA: If you want to do this as a regular user running in standard mode, then no - you have to ask the user to grant permission via Full Disk Access.\nYou can do it through other means by booting the Mac in Recovery mode for example, but I assume this is not something you want to do as part of a standard process. Granting the correct permissions is way easier.\nNote that it is possible to grant the permission, make the change, and then remove the permissions again.

Rather just adds them to the end of your photo library.\nUsually I would plug their phone into my Mac and import using Photos, but this isn’t possible.\nIs there a way of doing this importing of photos directly from one iPhone to another?\n\nA: AirDrop will transfer the meta data - showing the date of the photo, location, etc. \nIf you go to the Photos app, select Albums, and then All Photos, it will naturally show at the bottom of the list as it is the most recent photo to be added to the phone. However if you select Photos, instead of Albums, it will be sorted chronologically by date. \n\nA: You can use SHAREIt app which allows you to transfer photos from one device to another. I use it quite often and would recommend it. This keeps all the MetaData intact.\n", "Q: Shift–Command–Left/Right Arrow started switching tabs in macOS Mojave Finder, clashes with text movement? I often need to rename longer filenames in Finder. I used to do Shift + Command + ←/→ to select text from cursor to the start/end of the field.\nBut in macOS Mojave, suddenly this combination started to switch to previous/next Finder tab - so when I use the shortcut, file name editing is cancelled and I get switched to a new tab.\nThis doesn't happen in macOS High Sierra, and it's described in Apple's support document, Mac keyboard shortcuts as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shift–Command–Left Arrow: Select the text between the insertion point and the beginning of the current line.\n\n*Shift–Command–Right Arrow: Select the text between the insertion point and the end of the current line.\nIs this a bug? Is there a known workaround?\n\nA: The vast majority of textboxes on macOS (including those in third-party apps) support Emacs keybindings for moving around text. These use the Ctrl key instead of Command and are thus less likely to be remapped randomly by OS changes.\nIn your specific case, you can use Ctrl+Shift+A and Ctrl+Shift+E to select text from the cursor to the start or end of the line respectively. These shortcuts can be entered entirely with your left hand, which might even speed you up a little.\nOther useful shortcuts: Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E move the cursor to the start or end of the line respectively, while Ctrl+K deletes the text from the cursor to the end of the line. Full lists of shortcuts are posted in various spots on the web; you can check this site for example.\n\nAlso, if you're finding yourself renaming files often in Finder, consider using the multi-file renaming tool built into the Finder. Simply select multiple files, right-click (or ctrl-click/two-finger click) on them and select \"Rename N Items...\". This pops up a dialog box that lets you do some simple rename transformations (adding text, replacing text, or formatting names sequentially).\n\nA: If you set your own shortcut for moving between tabs of a window, the Shift-Command-Arrow combinations will work as before. \nTo set your own shortcut: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts\n\n*Select App Shortcuts at the bottom. \n\n*Click the + button to add a shortcut.\n\n*Make sure that \"All Applications\" is selected\n\n*Type in the exact names of the commands, on an English system they would be 'Show Previous Tab' and 'Show Next Tab'. Check this in the Window Menu in Finder if you're not sure.\n\n*Add your preferred shortcut to switch between tabs in either direction\n\n\n\n\nA: Changing the shortcut in system prefs did the trick for me.\nJust changed the command to: command + shift  + ↑ or ↓, which I never use in finder so I made the choice specific to finder. \nMight need to open it up to all apps depending how in app save windows behave\n", "Q: Activation Lock on iPhone 4S randomly appeared (not my username, I am the only owner) While listening to Spotify on my old iPhone 4S, the screen changed and showed the Activation Lock screen.

I would possibly like to chain the exclusion for multiple file types.\n\nA: Try this :\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theFiles to files in folder (choose folder) whose name does not end with \".bat\"\n    reveal theFiles\nend tell\n\n\nA: Finder\nHere are a few different ways to filter by file extension, with a brief description of their benefits.  For the purposes of illustration, I've had Finder operations performed upon an open Finder window (my Pictures folder), which has many jpegs in it that serve as a good sample against which to test exclusion filters.\ntell application \"Finder\" to select (every file in the ¬\n    front Finder window whose name does not end with \".jpg\")\n\nThis took 14 seconds on its second run, to provide a baseline for rough comparisons.\nThe one simple act of coercing the result to an alias list consistently sped up the performance time to 8 seconds (almost twice as fast):\ntell application \"Finder\" to select ((every file in the ¬\n    front Finder window whose name does not end with \".jpg\") as alias list)\n\nSurprisingly to me, filtering by name extension didn't seem to affect performance times compared to using the name property, possibly suggesting both are performing equivalent string comparisons under the hood:\ntell application \"Finder\" to select ((every file in the ¬\n    front Finder window whose name extension is not \"jpg\") as alias list)\n\nNonetheless, I would preferentially choose to filter by name extension as a matter of personal choice, because it's cleaner syntax.\nOne benefit of Finder is that we can condense multiple filters into one, inclusive expression that essentially forms a list of predicates:\ntell application \"Finder\" to select ((every file in the ¬\n    front Finder window whose name extension is not in ¬\n    [\"jpg\", \"png\"]) as alias list)\n\nand this was just as fast for two extensions than it was for one, and then again for four:\ntell application \"Finder\" to select ((every file in the ¬\n    front Finder window whose name extension is not in ¬\n    [\"jpg\", \"png\", \"mov\", \"mp4\"]) as alias list)\n\nFiltering by the name property can't be done with multiple extensions in this manner, so must be done with separate clauses for each extension you wish to exclude:\ntell application \"Finder\" to select ((every file in the front Finder window whose ¬\n    name does not end with \"jpg\" and ¬\n    name does not end with \"png\" and ¬\n    name does not end with \"mp4\" and ¬\n    name does not end with \"mov\") as alias list)\n\n\nSystem Events\nSystem Events is much more equipped to handle file processing and filtering than Finder, which is somewhat counterintuitive.  It also prevents Finder being blocked during the operation.\nYou cannot use a list of predicates as you can with Finder, so we have to make do with the longer expressions:\ntell application \"System Events\" to get path of every file in the ¬\n    pictures folder whose visible = true and ¬\n    name extension is not \"jpg\" and ¬\n    name extension is not \"png\" and ¬\n    name extension is not \"mp4\" and ¬\n    name extension is not \"mov\"\n\ntell application \"Finder\" to select the result\n\nBut the fact that this operation takes approximately zero seconds makes it worthwhile.  Note here that I asked System Events to return the path to these items, simply so I could then pass the result to Finder and have it select them as before (this is also how you can use reveal after a System Events call).\n\nObjective-C\nIf you need to search huge folders or a nested list of folders, don't be tempted to use Finder's entire contents property, or it will make you cry.  Use AppleScriptObjC, which performs deep searches of folder trees with performance times that are faster than System Events and shell.  It comes at a cost of slightly more overhead compared to System Events/Finder, but probably comparable to that of calling a shell script.\nFirst, it's best to define some handlers to take care of the file searching and filtering:\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nuse scripting additions\n\nproperty this : a reference to current application\nproperty NSDirectoryEnumerationSkipsHiddenFiles : a reference to 4\nproperty NSDirectoryEnumerationSkipsPackageDescendants : a reference to 2\nproperty NSFileManager : a reference to NSFileManager of this\nproperty NSMutableSet : a reference to NSMutableSet of this\nproperty NSPredicate : a reference to NSPredicate of this\nproperty NSSet : a reference to NSSet of this\nproperty NSString : a reference to NSString of this\nproperty NSURL : a reference to NSURL of this\n\n\non filesInDirectory:fp excludingExtensions:exts\n    local fp, exts\n    \n    set all to contentsOfDirectory at fp\n    set |*fs| to all's filteredArrayUsingPredicate:(NSPredicate's ¬\n        predicateWithFormat:(\"pathExtension IN %@\") ¬\n            argumentArray:[exts])\n    \n    set fs to NSMutableSet's setWithArray:all\n    fs's minusSet:(NSSet's setWithArray:|*fs|)\n    fs's allObjects() as list\nend filesInDirectory:excludingExtensions:\n\non contentsOfDirectory at fp\n    local fp\n    \n    set FileManager to NSFileManager's defaultManager()\n    \n    set fs to FileManager's enumeratorAtURL:(NSURL's ¬\n        fileURLWithPath:((NSString's stringWithString:fp)'s ¬\n            stringByStandardizingPath())) ¬\n        includingPropertiesForKeys:[] ¬\n        options:(NSDirectoryEnumerationSkipsHiddenFiles + ¬\n        NSDirectoryEnumerationSkipsPackageDescendants) ¬\n        errorHandler:(missing value)\n    \n    fs's allObjects()\nend contentsOfDirectory\n\nThen, you can perform a call like this:\nget my filesInDirectory:\"~/Pictures\" excludingExtensions:[\"jpg\", \"JPG\", \"\"]\n-- tell application \"Finder\" to reveal the result\n\nNote that Objective-C will perform case-sensitive searches, so it's prudent to include file extensions to be excluded in both upper- and lowercase formats.  The empty string excludes folders (except when the folder name contains a period).\nObjective-C performed a deep enumeration of my Pictures folder filtering out all jpegs to return a list of 643 files nested within that directory, and it did this in approximately zero seconds.  Neither Finder nor System Events can match this time (Finder won't respond after a while, and doing a deep search with System Events requires manually iterating through child folders, and deciding how to handle the nested list it returns, but it does it in an impressive 4 seconds).  The shell is just as fast for this number of files, but I am fairly confident from what I've read that Objective-C will out perform the shell's find command for large volumes of files.\nYou'll see I commented out the Finder's reveal command: asking Finder to reveal 643 files in different folders was...um...unpleasant.  I don't recommend it.\n\nConclusion\n① Utilise System Events to perform file searches and optionally retrieve file paths, which can be utilised for any operations you wish Finder to subsequently perform upon them.\n② If you do, for some reason, need to use Finder to perform the file search, always coerce to alias list for performance benefits and a class of item that's universally much easier to handle later.\n③ For large or nested folder structures, use Objective-C.\n", "Q: Is it possible to upgrade original iMac (1998) memory (RAM) to above 256 MB?

It happens every couple minutes and it's incredibly frustrating because I'm constantly trying to figure out where my cursor is.\nI'm running High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G3025) on a 15 inch 2015 Macbook pro with two external monitors.\nSome additional details:\nThe cursor stays invisible until I right click or press cmd-tab. It seems to happen with several apps including Chrome and Atom, but I've noticed it happens quite a bit more frequently when I mouse over a kitty terminal window.\n\nA: If your mouse cursor has mysteriously disappeared in OS X, try the following tricks in descending order to bring it back:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Command+Tab to switch back to the Finder or to another app, then switch back to the active app\n\n*Summon the Force Quit menu by hitting Command+Option+Escape, there is often no need to actually force quit anything as just summoning the menu is often enough to make the cursor return\n\n*Quit and relaunch the app, or quit all apps if the cursor is gone everywhere\n\n*Adjust the size of the cursor, found in System Preferences > Accessibility > Display to make it reappear\nReboot\nLet me know if problem remains.\n", "Q: Force Finder to use only a single window? I constantly find myself closing down Finder windows. It seems that every \"reveal in finder\" command pops open a new finder window. This creates unwanted window clutter since I almost never need more than one finder window open at the same time. Is there any way to force Finder to reuse the same window, or to open separate tabs instead of separate windows?\n\nA: I figured it out. Oddly, the Finder setting \"Open folders in tabs instead of new windows\" seems to do nothing unless the following setting is also in effect: Settings > Dock > Prefer tabs when opening documents set to Always. \nNow commands to open folders, whether from Spotlight or \"Reveal in Finder\" open in new tabs instead of windows.\n\nA: Just a 2022 update on this, because macOS changed a bit. Take these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Finder > Preferences > General > Check: Open folders in tabs instead of new windows\n\n\n*System Preferences > General > Prefer tabs: always\n\nA: That can be done\nGo to Finder Preferences and set it like this..\nOpen Folders in Tabs ...\n\nIf you still want to see more Finder windows (Tabs) click on the + on the right and it will open new Tab in same window.\n\n", "Q: Having this weird issue where it's like my APFS container that I'm booted into is not mounted? (hackintosh) I had this partition setup (I only have one SSD) that was something like this. This is not a direct copy of what it looked like, I am doing it from memory:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   0:    GUID_partition_scheme\n   1:         Windows Recovery\n   2:                      EFI\n   3:     Microsoft Basic Data\n   4:               Apple_APFS Container 1\n\nBasically I ended up creating free space between 3 and 4 here, but I couldnt find a way to expand my APFS Container because Disk Utility could not detect the free space at all. If I remember correctly it was about 275GB of free space. I basically created an unformatted partition in the free space (using GParted) and then it appeared in Disk Utility next time I booted.\nI started messing around with different strategies, trying to turn it back into free space so I could expand my APFS, but nothing was working. I ended up in this state:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   0:    GUID_partition_scheme\n   1:         Windows Recovery\n   2:                      EFI\n   3:     Microsoft Basic Data\n   4:                Apple_HFS\n\nwith the typical /dev/disk1 (synthesized): block below, outlining the APFS container that I am booted into.\nI am almost 100% certain that this Apple_HFS partition is empty, but I am confused because I am also pretty sure it is the exact same disk label as my APFS container (disk0s4). So much so, that when I use iBoysoft Data Recovery, it gives me the option to recover TWO separate disks after selecting the disk0s4 partition.\n\nI guess I am mainly curious\nIs it possible for there to be two partitions with the same diskXsY type of identifier? Or does anyone know how to resolve my issue?\nI think my computer should still boot, but I am sort of afraid to shut down just in case I can't. There is no way I could have accidentally deleted my main partition, right? Since I am actively using it right now?\nEDIT: If I run first aid on the container it even refers to itself as disk0s4. Could the HFS thing literally BE my Container but it is mislabeled?? It is approximately the same size as well. The only weird thing is my disk is missing like 275GB of space if you run diskutil list\n\nA: First question, what version/build of OS X are you on? Is FileVaut enabled? Also you say you are booted into /dev/disk1 which is actually the container at disk0s4. If you are making partition changes, it is best you do not do it from the disk you are modifying, especially with a table like this.\nAPFS from my findings is really unstable still, and while it has some advantages, there are a lot of problems, and when they happen, they are hard to recover from. \nPaste the output of diskutil apfs list. Make sure you do a direct copy and paste, not just from memory.\nAlso, make yourself a recovery drive to boot from when you make any changes, if you can even install a clean copy of Mac onto a USB3 and run it from there so you also can see how things appear in Finder, otherwise just a simple drive using createinstallmedia is fine.

I'm researching a memory upgrade for a 2018 Mac Mini (in advance of purchase). I thinking to buy it configured with the base 8GB and upgrade it to 32GB with aftermarket memory modules, at a savings of about 50% ($300) from the $600 extra of ordering it with 32GB.\nThe spec as far as DDR4 2666 MHz 260-pin SODIMM seems quite clear, but I haven't been able to find a CAS latency value for the RAM I'll find installed in the Mac mini. I wanted to get memory with a matching latency or perhaps something below. I'm not looking for extra performance; I just want to make sure it's as compatible as possible and not slow it down.\nHere's the conundrum:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Kingston and Crucial memory selectors both lead to CL=19 modules for Mac Mini 2018.\n\n*An offhand mention in an Amazon review stated that CAS latency for memory on iMac 2017 was CL=17.\n\n*Kingston offers HyperX modules (targeted toward PC gaming) that have CL=14 at a comparable price to the CL=19 modules.\n\n\nSo I was hoping to find an authoritative source for what the original-equipment CAS latency was for the Mac Mini. If it's CL=19 I'll go with the Kingston-recommended modules, but if it were CL=17 I'd probably go for the HyperX modules. Unfortunately, an hour of Googling around has met with no joy on that count.\nIs there some place I can find that spec online or does someone just happen to know and could share that?\n\nA: Based on iFixit teardown which says these RAM pcs are Hynix model \"HMA851S6CJR6N-VK\" I'm assuming that they're the same as the ones you can find by browsing this model name (i.e. here) - and they're described as CL 19. \nHowever, there's a video of this guy that switches his Mac Mini's RAM to CORSAIR \"CMSX32GX4M2A2666C18\" that has CL 18 and it seems to work fine.\n", "Q: Chrome on Mac: Annoying floating window Recently I see a floating window when using Google Chrome on Mac. I can't close it. It appears on top of any web page. When I right click on the Window, there's a menu shown as below:\n\nWould you please tell me how to hide this window? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Closing and reopening Chrome eliminated a un-clickable floating window on my mac.\nThe window was floating over most other windows on a 2nd monitor and was quite large.  I was able to create a third desktop with the \"show desktop\" function, then drag my working windows to the new desktop (including the windows hidden behind the unclickable image) then I destroyed the crippled desktop by clicking on the X in the 'show desktop' header.  However, a small unclickable image (with the same graphic as the problem window) remained hovering on the newly populated desktop.\nI closed Chrome, and the image went away.  It did not return when I reopened chrome and recovered my history.\nThis was Chrome Version 79.0.3945.130 (Official Build) (64-bit) on macOS Mojave 10.14.6 on 2020-02-12.\n", "Q: Cannot launch gitk on Mojave: mapped file has no cdhash?

In other words I want to plug the hub into my Macbook Air and the power into the Hub\n[Power]-->[Hub]-->[2018 Macbook Air]\n\nI bought 2 hubs and neither seems to be able to do this. I tried a VANMASS 9-in-1 USB HUB and a Sicotool 8 in 1 Type C Combo USB C Hub Adapter\nIn either case the Macbook Air shows\nAC Charger Information:\n\n  Connected:    Yes\n  Wattage (W):  5\n  Charging:     No\n\nupdate\nOkay so I tried a bunch of things. First off I'm using an Anker 60W Powerport 6 as power. I made the assumption, I guess wrong, that given the power adaptor that comes with the Macbook Air is 30W that this Anker 60W would deliver enough power. But apparently that's wrong. If I connect it directly to the Macbook Air it just says\nAC Charger Information:\n\n  Connected:    Yes\n  Wattage (W):  12\n  Charging:     No\n\nSo, apparently the hub is taking 7W?\nI plugged the Apple 30W USB-C Power Adaptor into the hub and I get\nAC Charger Information:\n\n  Connected:    Yes\n  Wattage (W):  19\n  Charging:     No\n\nSo now the question is, if I go out and buy say the Apple 87W USB-C Power Adaptor and plug it in to the hub will in finally start charging through the hub? \n\nA: \nif I go out and buy say the Apple 87W USB-C Power Adaptor and plug it in to the hub will in finally start charging through the hub? \n\nAnswer: Yes, I went to the Apple store, plugged on the Apple 60W USB-C Power Adaptor and System Info shows the Macbook Air was charging.\nSo I guess the 60W Anker is not 60W for a single port\n\nA: Actually many hubs can have this features. \nI purchased a type c hub last days, and it can charge mt laptop\nBut i don't know if it's limited to the computer model.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/CZHOON-Charging-Chromebook-Nintendo-Laptop-Gray/dp/B07C1R8KFC\n\nA: Here's one important detail that will answer a lot of your questions, Apple iDevices will draw no more than 12 watts from a USB-A port.  Another important point, Apple iDevices use USB-PD (power delivery) to get more than 12 watts from any USB-C power brick or dock.  Quick Charge and PowerIQ power bricks will not work unless they explicitly state they are USB-PD compatible.\nIt doesn't matter what the power rating of the power supply is, an Apple iDevice will draw no more than 12 watts from a USB-A port.  If there is a USB-A connection anywhere in the chain from the wall outlet to the Apple device then the power will be limited to 12 watts.  That Anker 60 watt USB power brick?  That's 60 watts because it's 5 ports times 12 watts per USB-A port.\nSome non-Apple devices will allow more than 12 watts per USB-A port, such as Quick Charge and PowerIQ.  They do this by putting a protocol other than USB-PD over the USB port.  Apple iDevices will not \"talk\" anything other than USB-PD to negotiate power draw and so will fall back to a kind of \"safe mode\" of 5 watts maximum that dates back to the days of USB 1.1.\nI want to hammer this point home because it seems people here are missing this important point and it's causing them to waste a lot of time (and possibly money) on trying to get more than 12 watts through USB-A.  It won't happen.  Or it should not because if it does happen then something is on fire or is about to be.\nTo get more than a 12 watt trickle into your Apple iDevice (laptop, tablet, or phone) it needs to connect to a hub, dock, or power brick by USB-C or Lightning.  If there is a USB-A connector at any point between the wall outlet and the Apple device then charging will be limited to 12 watts, possibly 5 watts.  If there is a hub, dock, or other device between the wall outlet and the power input port on your Apple device then it needs to get power from something other than USB-A.  Most often this will be a USB-C power brick but some docks will use something like a barrel connector or 4-pin DC input, something capable of handling enough power for the dock with enough left over to charge the Apple device, then the connection to the iDevice will be USB-C or Lightning.\nSeeing a dock consume 7 or 11 watts sounds a bit high but if there's other devices plugged in other than the iDevice then that would explain the power draw.  I have used a 27 watt USB-C power supply to keep my MacBook Pro powered before.  My dock will consume 2 watts of that for the dock itself and the keyboard and mouse attached to it.\nIf the power supply is not powerful enough to power the dock and meet the power draw of the iDevice at the time then there will be nothing left over to charge the battery.  In which case you should get a more powerful power supply that uses USB-C and USB-PD.\nTo complicate things further the cables can be the weak link.  There are 3 amp USB-C/USB-PD cables and 5 amp USB-C/USB-PD cables.  You need not be concerned about that unless you need or want more than 60 watts.\n", "Q: Magsafe problem: only works in certain positions I recently bought a brand-new, genuine Magsafe 60W charger for my mid-2010 MBP (my previous charger died suddenly after months of extreme fraying). Within a few hours of using it, strange and bad things started to happen. First, the battery intermittently stopped charging despite an amber light. Then the light started dimming and flickering, and the connector started heating up a lot. Finally, it started completely failing to charge, with no light.\nHowever, I then discovered that if I very carefully hold the cord in certain positions and apply tiny amounts of force in various directions, it charges completely fine. I thought this might be a Magsafe port problem, so I replaced the Magsafe port, but the problem persists. I also tried resetting SMC many times to no avail.\nWhat could be the problem here? Is it more likely to be a charger problem or a logic board problem?\nOne thing I did notice is that the pins don't quite seem to line up exactly with the connections in the port: they're offset sideways by 0.3mm or thereabouts. It's a long shot, but it might explain why the charger only works when pulled in a certain direction. Is this a known issue?\n\nA: I can confirm that I have had the same thing start happening on a genuine Apple adapter.  After asking the same question, here is what the cause was in my case.\n\n*\n\n*The battery started being more aged, and the computer pulling more power (mine is mid-2011).\n\n\n*The adapter is working at its limit.\n\n\n*Removing the adapter at the computer while it's charging causes invisible micro-arcs to happen.\n\n\n*These micro-arcs burn the connectors on the adapter (again, not visibly obvious), and then there is no longer a good mesh between the adapter and the computer.\nThis issue was getting worse (i.e. the amount of positions which worked were getting smaller and smaller) -- but when I realized this was what was happening, I started unplugging at the outlet (rather than at the computer), and then it definitively stopped getting worse.\nSo, a lesson for future electronics -- always unplug at the outlet first.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Early 2015 13 inch Retina Cycle count reset Apparently, the max cycle count for my MacBook (type is on the title) is 1000. Currently, my cycle count is 990 and I'm wondering if I can reset it without changing my battery? Probably impossible but just in case...\n\nA: The cycle count of a battery is like an odometer on a car, if you reset it (which you can't do though conventional means), you will have a reading of \"zero\" but the car will still have all the \"mileage\" on it.\nThe cycle count on a battery is just a gauge.  Just because it's at or near 1000 cycles doesn't mean it's going to fail instantly. 1000 cycles is not the max.  It could, conceivably continue to function for many, many more cycles.\nIt's a good idea to start budgeting for a new battery now knowing that in the near future it will (begin to) fail and you'll need to replace it.\n\nA: Since the cycle count of MacBooks is logged inside the battery, it is impossible to reset or reduce the count. \nThe cycle count is a one-way trip. It keeps increasing but can't go back. Just like the TIME. \nHowever, you can replace the battery to bring the cycle count to 0. \nYou can read more about MacBook Cycle Count at this blog post.\n\n", "Q: Change text message forwarding from a device other than iPhone? I have an iPad mini that I'm using right now for most things, as my iPhone broke yesterday. I won't be getting a new one for a while.\nIs there any other device I can change text message forwarding option from to make SMS go to my iPad mini?\n\nA: \nIs there any other device I can change text message forwarding option from to make SMS go to my iPad mini?\n\nNo.\nYou need a working iPhone, connected to cellular network and Wi-Fi to enable text message forwarding to your other iOS devices (iPad, iPod touch) or your Mac.\nIn your current scenario, there is no way to configure SMS forwarding to your iPad mini as your iPhone is not active. Even if SMS forwarding were configured previously on your iPhone, with it not being active, you won't be able to receive the SMS messages on your iPad mini.\nHowever, you can continue to receive and send iMessages with your iPad mini as long as it is connected to Wi-Fi (active Internet connection).\n(In case you are not aware, SMS messages can be distinguished from iMessages, by looking at the colour of the message bubble. SMS are shown in green while iMessage are shown in Blue. SMS are sent over your carriers cellular connection and iMessages are sent over the Internet using Apple's servers)\nMore details can be found in the Apple support article, How to forward SMS/MMS texts on your iPhone.\n\nA: As the other answer already says, no, not from a none iPhone device.\nYou can however use any iPhone that you can login to (so one that is not linked to someone else) to enable this option, as long as you have your sim that is.\nSo if anybody has an old one lying around, you could use that one, even if it is a older and slower one.

No, I will not tolerate automatic updates, and it doesn't matter why.  Maybe I need a stable setup for development, video rendering, or I just don't like to be bothered with notifications about something that may require a restart, shutdown of critical apps, or any interruption to my work flow. \n\nA: If you want to disable updates for specific apps, you can use softwareupdate --ignore.\nDo all the following in Terminal\nStart with\nsoftwareupdate -l\n\nto list all available updates,\ndefaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist\n\nto find the Identifier of the app you want to ignore, and then\nsoftwareupdate --ignore 'Identifier'\n\nto ignore the update.

How can I fix this?\nEDIT: I am connected to WIFI and it works\n\nA: You have apps installed as \"enterprise apps\" - i.e. it is not apps installed via the App Store, via TestFlight or directly from Xcode as a developer. Enterprise app installation is supposed to be used only by enterprises installing their own custom apps on their own devices - it is not intended for public distribution.\nIn order to verify these apps, you'll need to have a working internet connection, and especially you must have unhindered access to https://ppq.apple.com Apple Support\nHowever, it is not enough to have a working internet connection. The enterprise distribution account with Apple that was used to sign these apps must still be valid (i.e. subscription paid) - and the enterprise must not have revoked these specific apps.\n", "Q: \"bash\" command runs scripts in version 3.2, not 4.4 Currently, in terminal, my default interactive shell is bash version 4.4. The OS ships with 3.2.\nIf I want to run a script (e.g., my_script.sh) using bash version 4.4, I can source it (source my_script.sh) or type it into my terminal directly. Though, in each case the script runs in my current shell.  I can also give a script execute permissions and run it as a command, allowing the shebang to control which version of bash to use.\nHowever, the command bash continues to use version 3.2. For example, if I run bash my_script.sh, the script will be executed in a new shell (which I want), but the older version of bash will be used (3.2). Similarly, if I just run bash with no argument, a new shell opens up using version 3.2 (recall, if I open a new window or tab in terminal, it uses my default shell, bash v. 4.4. The problem here is what happens when I use the command bash).\nI've added the path to bash 4.4 on my machine (/usr/local/bin/bash) to my PATH variable in .bash_profile, and it's not being overwritten somewhere else (echo $PATH gives the expected result: the very first path is usr/local/bin/bash). I expected this to change the behavior of the command bash\nI can use a workaround, by setting an alias (alias bash4='/usr/local/bin/bash'), but I don't have to use an alias for bash 3.2, or for upgraded versions of, e.g., python or R.\nIs there something I'm missing?

That takes about 15 minutes plus however long it takes to re-download the installer. It's often much harder to determine what went wrong and if you have a new machine, a fresh start will let you know right away if it was just some things that didn't get set up, a poor image of the OS or a very rare case of something not right.

The device that then uses this drive doesn't like dot-directories like /.Spotlight-V100/.\nInside that Workflow is an AppleScript step, which includes a do shell script command, which uses an /bin/rm command which fails with the message:\nThe action “Run AppleScript” encountered an error: “rm: /Volumes/MERCEDES/.Spotlight-V100: Operation not permitted”\n\nIf I launch the workflow in Automator, I get the same error.\nBUT, if I add Automator.app in System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Full Disk Access, I no longer get that error when I run the Workflow from Automator, but I still get it when I run from Finder.\nSo, naturally, I presume that when the script is run by the Services menu, it's different process running it, and I've been trying to figure out (by watching Activity Monitor) what process is so I can whitelist. Processes I've tried unsuccessfully:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.automator.runner.xpc\n\n*ScriptMonitor.app\n\n*rm\n\n\nDoes anyone know which process needs to be whitelisted for this use case?\n\nA: The problem is that the automator service inherits the permissions of the application it's running from.\nAutomator has Full Disk Access. So, if you run it from Automator, it works!\nBut let's say you're running Chess.app, and from the top menu, you select Chess → Services → My Automator Workflow. Chess.app does not have full disk access, so the workflow fails. I expect that if you grant Chess.app Full Disk Access in System Preferences, the Workflow will work when run from Chess.app—but not when run from DVD Player.app.\nYes, I recognize that this is incredibly frustrating. \n", "Q: Does anybody know what the ARP cache timeout is for macOS Sierra? Does anyone know deafult ARP cache timeout for macOS Sierra?\n\nA: There's no standard time out value for routes stored in an arp table.  For instance, on Cisco gear, it's 4 hours.\nThe arp utility that macOS uses is the one from BSD and it's time out is 20 minutes if the host has been validated. Static entries don't time out, but can be over written by network traffic.  Permanent entries also do not time out and cannot be over written.\n", "Q: Prevent calls to iPhone launching FaceTime on MacBook in Mojave?

Drives were formatted Mac OS Extended journaled and GUID and connected directly to usb on specced-out Mac Mini 2012 running Mavericks. In all cases install was smooth and ended with booting to fully operational Mojave installs on external drives. All good so far.\nRestart as-is ie back to fresh-installed Mojave on external USB drive and all good, boots to external Mojave with Mac Mini on-board OS and files also visible as expected in Finder.\nReboot to the original on-board OS (Mavericks) either by selecting in prefs>startup disk or by shutdown and disconnect/reconnect external drive and the new Mojave partition doesn't show as an OS or on the desktop or anywhere. In Disk Utility it's now greyed out and renamed to disk1s2. A 2nd non-OS partition on the same external drive shows up as normal, just the Mojave partition has gone AWOL and doesn't appear in prefs>startup disc either.\nI tried using Disk Utility to check/repair after this all happened.

This will invoke the Startup Manager. Select the Mojave startup disk. Next, click on the arrow below the icon to boot Mojave. If you wish to make Mojave the default, then hold down the control key before clicking on the arrow.\nApple a recently added new instructions for using the Startup Manager. These instructions can be found on the Apple website: How to select a different startup disk. \nWhile it is technically possible to select Mojave directly from Mavericks, this would involve installing a third party boot manager such as rEFInd.

I just learned that I can split the screen vertically using Command + D (and un-split it via Command + Shift + D).\nHowever, I do not understand how to use the two views differently. In fact whenever I type a command in the lower screen, say ls, the same happens in the upper screen.\nAlso, I do not understand how to use the upper screen. I read somewhere that Command + Alt + ↑ should do the job, but that doesn't seem to work.\n\nA: From this answer:\n\nYou're misinterpreting the feature. It's not meant for two separate terminals. It's intended to allow a user to see two different view points in the same terminal. For instance, if you have 3000 files in a directory, and you perform an ls command, that output is going to be very long.\nIf you use the split pane, you can scroll through that long output without having to flip back and forth, possibly losing your place along the way.\nIf you want two terminals, use tabs, or separate windows.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can also install and use a widely used 3rd party Terminal emulator called iTerm2. iTerm2 has various features including the ability to create Split Panes, with support for keyboard shortcuts.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Air Hard drive crashed (2013 Model) Is it possible to replace the hard drive for a 2013 MacBook Air?

I went to my iCloud account and it show that I have no photos as well. Is there any way I can get at least my photos back? I’ve tried restoring older backups but no photos or contacts are on any of the backups. And yes my I set my settings to upload my pictures and contacts to my iCloud during backups.\n\nA: iCloud is primarily a syncing mechanism and not a backup solution.  What this means is iCloud gives you access to all your files, pictures, contacts, etc. on any device that's logged-in with the same Apple ID.  \nThe pictures and contacts are stored in iCloud and your other devices access it from there.  When you deleted the info from iCloud directly, you deleted the source files and not copies of the files.  \nHowever, there is something you can try. iCloud provides a 40-day grace period in which you can recover deleted photos and 30-day grace period for other types of files.

Alright so today, my chrome decided to just simply not load anything. No matter what url you visited, it just wouldn't load. However, when I browsed as a guest, chrome worked perfectly fine. So from there I found out that the issue was with my account. I tried removing my account from chrome then adding it back on, and then I realized I lost all my new bookmarks. Google was able to sync my old bookmarks, but my more important and new bookmarks were unable to get synced.\nThat being said, where does chrome store bookmarks so I can recover them? \n\nA: Step 1. Open up \"Finder\" and go to Macintosh HD ->Users ->Your user name ->Library ->Application Support ->Google ->Chrome ->Default; in the Default folder, you will see two files (Bookmarks & Bookmarks.bak).\nStep 2. Now, you need to copy, rename and save Bookmarks file to another location. Then, go back and delete the original file.\nStep 3. Next (very important step!), go down to Bookmarks.bak and rename it to simply \"Bookmarks\"(leave out the .bak extension, and this will make your backup copy of the bookmarks as the original bookmarks folder).\nStep 4. At last, close Finder. Restart Chrome window, you shall see all bookmarks you've collected coming back.  \n", "Q: Missing text highlighting Color when selecting it in Preview When I select text in PDF file in Preview it doesn't highlight properly.\nThis issue is reproducible after a restart.

Any ideas? \n\nA: If I understand your question..\nThe text highlight (select) color for Preview is set in your \nSystem Preferences > General\n\nYou can customize it by selecting Other then choose the color and how dark you want it by moving the slider.\n\n\nA: This bug also affects Microsoft PowerPoint running under Mojave. If the highlight color is set to \"Graphite\" you may not be able to see the text highlight and the text selection cursor will disappear. Any other highlight color seems to work.\nTo change the highlight color, go to System Preferences > General > Highlight Color.\n\nA: Issue is still in Mojave 10.14.3, not technically a bug. It's taking the color you select and then lightening it by a fixed amount so that it's not so dark that you can't see your text. When graphite is selected the amount it lightens the selection nearly completely offsets the color. (It's very slightly visible if you have sharp vision.) If you want a darker gray selection highlight, choose Other, then move the sliders to black and you'll get the Graphite gray you wanted.\n\n\nA: None of the answers worked for me.

Then, no more snapshots are added. I just migrated to Mojave on my MacBook Air, in case that adds anything useful. Thanks.\n\n\nA: In my case, I discovered that Dataless Snapshots might appear when TimeMachine is set off/on (automatic unticked/ticked), as it appears that after a few “new” Snapshots are taken, the oldest Snapshots prior to turning off/on TM become dataless.\n\nA: They become Dateless when the backup hasn't fully backed up to Time Machine.

If not - be sure to copy out any data or log into the cloud version of numbers to be sure you have a cloud version you can live with.\nThen clear the saved application state for Numbers by moving this file to your desktop or placing it in the trash can:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iWork.Numbers/Data/Library\n\nIf you don't have a good backup, I'd get one before deleting anything from your Saved State folders in ~/Library and if the Autosave Information and Saved Application State folders are empty you may need to delete the entire container.\nIf you're not sure about navigating to ~/Library which is hidden or restoring these files from a backup - Apple Support might be a good place to reach out to, but if you're familiar with moving things from the Library - I've seen clearing these help with oddball errors that you know aren't correct anymore.\n", "Q: How to do a clean installation of a software in Mac I bought a software as a dmg file. It came with a license which was expired on 31st October 2018 \nSo, I bought a newer version of that of that software with a license for the next 12 months. \nWhen I installed that new software and open it. It says that your license is expired. \nWhen I clicked on the license tab. It shows the expiry date which is 31st October 2018 \nI wanted to know how I can completely remove that software from my system so, that I can re-install the newer version of it and get the upgraded license. \nNote: I know how to do it in a Windows machine by removing the registry of that software or using 3rd party software such as uninstaller pro. \n\nA: There is no registry on macOS so the developer can choose from many ways to license the software. Some store files and licenses in your user keychain, others in your user library. If the software is licensed per computer (say three people have user accounts on your mac but all can use the software) then the license key would be stored in the system area.\nI would start with the vendor to get the uninstall / unlicense steps needed for however they choose to implement their licensing scheme. It could be a preference that is cryptographically signed or something as trivial as writing a hidden (or obscurely located) file on the filesystem.\nThings like this are why App Store and buying apps through Apple is so compelling - all this confusion on licensing is cut through with a simple to understand model. Unfortunately - many vendors still try the old ways or think they can save money by not supporting their customers. This vendor is doubly unfair since the new install should clean up after the old if the old uninstall process left behind detritus or they don't have a clear path to get support.\nI'm glad to see they did support you and resolve this issue. Feel free to add an answer if you learned where this vendor stores their licenses or if it was just re-running their license tool that fixed it.\n", "Q: Mac Sierra - Not able to start in safe mode I am trying boot my macbook pro in safe mode with following instructions however, once it boots up and I login.

I created the shiftcommandn shortcut for Firefox in Syst Prefs to match other browsers' behavior. \n\nIt registers in the Firefox Menubar. \n\nBut pressing the shortcut opens a new non-private window, and it loads there the first item in my \"Top Sites\". \nI imagine I could create another shortcut to override this behavior, but what is this behavior? I don't see anything highlighted in the Firefox Menubar when I hit the shortcut. Or might there be another solution (other than using a different shortcut to open new private windows)? \nProblem exists on both Mojave and High Sierra. Default Firefox shortcut (shiftcommandp) still opens a new private window.  \n\nA: This has been a known Mac Firefox bug for years and years.  Because Firefox is not truly a native macOS app, it carries over odd behaviors, one of which being that you cannot fully override its pre-defined keyboard shortcuts.\nFirefox 55 addressed this partially as Mozilla bug #429824, which allowed new keyboard shortcuts to be created via System Preferences.  Overriding existing shortcuts like \"New Private Window\" or \"Paste\" or whatever is still not completely possible, but progress (or lack thereof) is being tracked by Mozilla bug #1333781.  In any case, you get all sorts of weird, undefined behavior if you try to override those shortcuts anyway.\nBefore the great extension purge in Firefox 57, Firefox extensions like keyconfig let you work around the problem by remapping those shortcuts within Firefox itself.  After Firefox retired all legacy extensions, this once again became impossible.\nSince Firefox 57 (being so annoyed by some of its default, un-Mac-like shortcuts) I've compiled Firefox from source code just so I could patch its keyboard shortcut configurations.  Not something I'd recommend to most people, but it is one potential workaround until the bug is fixed upstream.\n", "Q: Password confirmation on app launch I recently changed the email address and the password for my apple ID.

I don’t even know what the 21GB of “others\" contains.\nI tried finding the folders with the largest usage and this is what I got:\n\nThe contradiction is, as you can see, the disk takes 41GB of space, but if you sum up the sizes of its folders you’ll only get 29GB. The space gap is around 10GB, the same size as the photos and videos combined, which are nowhere to be found.\nI’m confused, if you have any idea how to solve this issue please let me know. \n\nA: There are two issues here. The first is that the Storage indicator is not particularly reliable. You may want to try re-indexing Spotlight, which is used to identify the categories.\nSecondly, the visible folders are not everything on your disk. MacOS can store 'local backups' on the system disk - normally these would be listed as \"Backups\", but if the identification process fails, then they might be listed as \"Other\". Normally, you don't need to worry about these filling up the disk, as the OS will manange it.\nThere are special utilities such as DaisyDisk and OmniDiskSweeper, which list all file hierarchies by size, allowing you to drill down and discover which files are taking the most space, and then delete them.\n\nA: Try checking System Storage in Safe Mode, then restart.\n", "Q: Different scales (or resolutions) for different apps in the same screen?

There are too many things that could go wrong.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you erase the old system, you’ll need to be very careful to erase the old volume, not the entire drive. Exactly how you’d do that depends on how you’re doing the reinstallation.\n\n*If something goes wrong during the reinstall, it might get wiped out anyway.\n\n\nSo, if you don’t want to lose those files, you really should have them backed up (and verified) somewhere else. Actually, that’s true anyway, but it’s especially important when you’re doing something dangerous like a reinstallation.\n\nA: There is a fundamental problem with backing up to a partition on the same drive as the source data: \"What happens if the drive fails?\" You lose everything.\nBackups are about extra copies: if you delete a file, you still have a copy on your backup.\nIf your system drive dies, you still have data on another device.\nIf your computer is stolen, you still have data somewhere else.\nIf your house burns down, you still have data on your off-site backup or cloud storage.\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra use almost all the hard drive space each time it's upgraded I have a 1T drive, and it normally uses 400 GB space.

Now, the thing is that all the pics that I deleted from iCloud were infact stored as low resolution on my iPhone. So, the device shows all the pics, but they are all low resolution. Ofcourse the high resolution that was stored on iCloud is deleted directly from iCloud and even the Recently Deleted items.\nSo, what is the solution now? I am happy with the low resolution pics as well. Ofcourse, if I could retrieve the high resolution pics, that would be the best solution.\nLooking for help.\nEDIT to clarify the question -\nI can see the low resolution pictures on my phone, because I restored the low resolution pics from a iTunes Backup and as soon as the restore was successful, I disconnected the internet to avoid syncing with iCloud. Now, I can see all the low resolution pics on the iPhone, and the question is how to bring them on to the computer. A definite solution is to use commercial tools such as EaseUS Recovery tool to extract the iTunes Backup, but that just costs money. So, I am here to ask for other solutions that doesnt cost money. \nIn other words, the low resolution pics ( I really dont care about the high resolution pics anymore ) on my phone has to be transferred somewhere - maybe using AirDrop or Bluetooth..without connecting to internet to avoid syncing with icloud.  Is that possible?\n\nA: If you deleted the photos from iCloud directly more than 30 days ago, and it appears you did if they're not in the Recently Deleted folder, then they're probably gone for good.\niCloud is a syncing solution and not a backup solution.  It doesn't store a copy of the pictures, in the way that using something like Dropbox does, it give you access to the pictures on all your devices.  At some point, you selected Optimize iPhone Storage in your iCloud settings.  Doing this only stores low-res versions of the photos on your device while the full, high-res photos are stored in iCloud.\nIf you saved any of those photos from iCloud directly to a computer, that would be your only remaining option to get the high-res versions.\n", "Q: Macbook screen bottom half black \nThe display shows up fine if I connect to an external display.\nIs this a hardware problem that can only be fixed by replacing the entire screen? It's no longer on warranty (1.5 years, no AppleCare), and the customer support told me it'd cost $128 for a diagnose and $600-800 for replacement of screen, which I thought it'd be more worth just buying a new one.\n\nA: Just to put this in as an answer...\nYou can see the broken bit, bottom right on the picture; the scratch might be a red herring, but the dark blob is a broken LCD.\n\n\nA: If you have no external damage to the case -  you’re hearing the worst case estimates. Internal screen damage like you have get repaired flat rate, mail in for less than $400 US as long as the external glass is OK and the case isn't damaged / bent showing a hard fall.\nIf you do have external damage due to a fall - they are preparing you for maybe paying more. If they can do the repair for less - Apple always charges less so even if they quote $800 it will charge $400 if that's all you need when you send it.\nI would call back and get an understanding on the flat rate repair options and have them quote you that. This is almost certainly hardware failure. The reason it would go to 600 or 800 would be due to additional damage to the case (400 + 200) or case and screen and logic board (600 + 200).\nIf you like this mac, consider that any of the above repairs is cheaper than a new one. Hopefully it’s just an internal screen failure and yours qualifies for flat rate. I’ve never heard of Apple charging a diagnostic fee if you legitimately think you qualify for flat rate, send it in and then decline the more costly repair. \nDon’t pay to diagnose it, just pay to repair once you’re sure it’s worth at least 400 to you once made as good as new. Same for the $800 - you get what's a totally rebuilt - new case, new computer tested and warranted by Apple for 90 days for $800 - way better than buying that model used on the internet. The only reason not to repair is you're looking for a different model.

Apple will repair - if i pay $$$ to have screen fixed too. Help! iPhone 7 has a known bug that causes cellular service to sometimes fail - so the phone no longer works as a phone. \nTook phone with this bug into Genius bar, and was told they'd repair it for free - if I also agreed to have them repair a teeny crack in the screen for $150. They would not fix the cellular issue without the screen repair. \nAny ways around this?  Any way to get Apple to fix their bug for free?\n\nA: As alluded to in the comments, many hardware repairs require removing the screen. If the screen is damaged (no matter how minor) there's a very high risk of it shattering during the repair process, and that is why Apple (and many others) won't do a repair unless you're also getting the screen replaced at the same time.\nAs for your question on how to get around this, the only other option is to get the screen replaced somewhere else, or to try replacing it yourself. Then, once the screen is okay, Apple will perform the other repair as per normal.\nHowever, please note that not all screens are created equally and that the money you save on a non-genuine screen may not be worth it in the long run. I've seen many cases of iPhones and iPads with non-genuine screens work just fine for a couple of months and then start to glitch like crazy.\n", "Q: Prevent page reload in safari due to excessive power usage How can I prevent Safari from refreshing the page showing the message \"This web page has been reloaded because it was using significant energy\"?\nI would like to leave the coinhive miner running when my machine is idle but it always gets stopped by the Safari refreshes.\nThanks\n\nA: I found this apple support discussion on the matter:\n\nWell, my \"solution\" so far has been to run that process in Chrome\n  instead of Safari.

This happened twice more after a reboot. I fear this is the dreaded GPU Failure (the repair program for which it is no longer eligible).\nBeing that I have a sentimental attachment to the lil guy, I thought I might take the opportunity to upgrade the motherboard to one compatible with MacOS Mojave. My guess is that anything that’s not a unibody MacBook will have a similar motherboard layout, but I haven’t found an authoritative source. Anyone have a list of compatible part numbers between chassis and motherboards?\n\nA: I found this for you :\n\nI have an early 2011 model 15\" MBP with a matte screen. I purchased a\n  mid 2012 non-retina logic board (without the heat sink → reused my\n  original one) and installed it successfully, upgrading my USB ports,\n  Thunderbolt port, CPU, and GPU. It's like having a new computer!\nThe display cable was a tight fit, but working carefully and with a\n  gentle yet firm hand, I was able to fit it into the logic board port.\n  The only other difference is that the new boards do not have the small\n  heat sinks over the USB controller and one other controller (not sure\n  what they are). I've read that one guy butchered his old board and\n  superglued the screw mounts onto the new board. Another person\n  reported superglueing the heat sink directly to the controller. Both\n  of these ways seemed a bit barbaric and unclean to me, so I just left\n  the two controllers be; figured they would have the screw mounts if\n  they needed the brackets, but they don't.\nSo over a week later, my laptop has been running completely fine.\n  Actually super, because of all the upgrades! I have installed iStat\n  Menus and have been monitoring my temperatures. Everything is within\n  normal ranges during various workloads! I have also swapped out my DVD\n  Superdrive with my original 750GB 5200RPM HDD, replacing the main\n  drive with a 1TB Samsung 850 Pro. Oh, and my bluetooth module has been\n  changed a long time ago, to allow AirDrop and Handover to work... as\n  you see, just about everything in my laptop has been changed. I just\n  really like my matte screen, and cannot believe they don't make them\n  any more. These new \"anti-glare\" displays have nothing on the matte!\nSo the answer to whether an early 2011 logic board (15\" MBP) is\n  swappable for a mid 2012 non-retina one is: It absolutely is, and\n  don't let anyone else tell you otherwise!\n\nSOURCE:\n", "Q: How can I fix a Macbook pro MGXA2 draining battery on shutdown?

I am trying to remove a configuration profile that I previously installed on a device, using MDM. I am able to get the list of the installed profiles using the ProfileList command. I have no issues when trying to remove an old .mobileconfig file on a supervised device, but when I attempt to remove the same .mobileconfig file on a non-supervised device, I get the following error: The profile “xxxx” is not managed by MDM.\nDespite this, Apple's documentation states that removing profiles using MDM is only possible if the profile has been installed through MDM (which is not the case for supervised devices).\nMy Question is: Is there a way to remove an old configuration profile that I previously installed on a non-supervised device that also hasn't been installed through MDM, using MDM? (to me, it makes sense that I should be able to, because at the end of the day, I distributed that profile on other people's devices and I am the owner of that .mobileconfig file...)\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Distribute the same profile with identifier say 'apple.mdm.MyProfile1' through MDM and remove the same identifier using RequestType RemoveProfile.\n", "Q: Cannot reinstall MacOS I have erased my Mac Mini and now I am presented with the Recovery screen where I can use Disk Utility, Reinstall, etc.\nNothing works!\nDisk Utility claims it cannot unmount the primary HDD, despite the \"mount\" option being greyed out, which suggests it's not mounted.

Everything was preloaded. Apple website suggests downloading the MacOS to create a bootable USB... But you need a Mac to do so!!!\nDon't know what else to do and would be really grateful if anyone could share what I can do.\n\nA: You need to create a new partition using Disk Utility that you can use for installing macOS. \nYou'll need somewhere to store your system, and without a partition (besides the recovery partition), you'll have no such place. That's why you have no choices when you run the installer.\n\nA: I found this useful article on the matter:\n\nIt is possible to restore a Mac without a recovery partition, but it\n  can be tricky (especially on older Macs). You have a few approaches\n  available:\nUse Internet Recovery to reinstall OS X  on Mac with a missing\n  recovery partition.\nCreate a bootdrive to install a copy of  macOS from.\nUse your Time Machine backup as your  start-up drive.\nYou may also be able to create a  Recovery partition.\n\n\nA: Follow this guide: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204904\nUse Option-Command-R, as this will boot both to Internet recovery mode, and will install the latest OS compatible with your system.\nYou will need to ensure you have a partition configured on your HDD before you can perform the installation.  Use this guide to help you: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208496\nWhen formatting the internal HDD, you will most likely need to use macOS extended journaled formatting with the GUID partition map scheme.\nBe very careful not to interfere with the recovery partition, or it will make it MUCH harder to get your system running without an installation DVD.\nWhen you have your HDD partitioning issues sorted out, you should be able to more easily either restore a time machine backup, or to reinstall the macOS from the main recovery screen.\n", "Q: Setting up a web server with a domain name on an iPhone Is it possible to set up a proper web server with a domain name on an iPhone or on iOS? \n\nA: Yes, it is indeed possible. You can use any web server software on the iPhone - and from there the configuration is exactly like having a web server with a domain name on any other computer/server:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to buy the domain name\n\n*You need to set up DNS service for the domain name\n\n*You need to set up an A-record in DNS for the static IP of the iphone, or alternatively setup DynDNS if your iPhone has a dynamic IP\nHowever, in practice it is not worth while having a web server on an iPhone. You'll run into problems with the web server app being put in the background, the iPhone sleeping/turned off, the battery being worn out too quickly, possible connectivity problems with WiFi, too low throughput, etc. Some of these can be mitigated by using for example a cabled ethernet connection and having a charger permanently connected, but it is not going to be practical.\nIn addition to those problems, you'll find that the webserving software is limited in what kind of extensions/plugins you can install (usually none), and you'll usually only be able to host static content (i.e. no ASP/PHP scripts, etc.).\nTake a look at for example DraftCode, if you want to run PHP scripts on the phone:\nhttps://solesignal.com/draftcode/\nIf you just want to run a simple web server without dynamic content, you could take a look at for example \"Easy File Sharing Web Server App\":\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/easy-file-sharing-web-server-app/id554620332?mt=8\nIf you are a developer, you can make your own web server app using frameworks/libraries such as Criollo or GCDWebServer:\nhttps://criollo.io\nhttps://github.com/swisspol/GCDWebServer\n", "Q: iCloud backups from a very old iPhone are not seen during the restore My sister used to have an iPhone 4 that I used before (she replaced the battery); she's used it until 2013 or 2014 when the battery was not usable anymore.

I am looking for a direct download link on Apple’s website rather than downloading it from Microsoft Store. When I visit Apple Support - Downloads page, and click on the download link, It redirect me to this page:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/\nThere it says I need to get iTunes from the Microsoft store.\nI cannot use Microsoft Store at work as it is disabled by IT, but I am allowed to install and use iTunes.\nIs there a direct download link for iTunes for Microsoft Windows 10 hosted somewhere on the official Apple website?\n\nA: You can download iTunes 12.9.1.4 for Microsoft Windows using the following direct link(s) on Apple's website:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes for Microsoft Windows (64-bit)\n\n*iTunes for Microsoft Windows (32-bit)\nThe links should work for the time being, however the same may change with subsequent updates to the software.\n\nA: These are direct download links and are versionless:\nhttps://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64\nhttps://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win32\n\nA: There is a legacy version for PC here (64-bit). I used to run this on Windows 7. The version is 12.1.3 but current version on high Sierra is 12.8.150.\n\nA: The answer for this is typically a moving target.\nThis is an extensive list which may be useful for many but the current version as of 2020-04-11 is 12.10.5.12, so the list (12.9.1.4 is the last one linked) is outdated.\n", "Q: Mojave spell check keeps flagging correct words and tries to change them to grammatically incorrect words So this has been driving me crazy - it feels like I have a grammar troll living in my computer.  MacOS's spell checker keeps flagging words as misspelled that aren't. I notice it mostly in Mail, because that's what I use most.  However it's also happened in Messages and other Apple apps.  It does not happen in MS Word.  Usually it's trying to get me to use another similar word that is grammatically incorrect.  I've attached some screenshots as well.  \nHardware is a 2017 iMac 5K running 10.14.1 (non-beta), and I don't remember seeing this before Mojave.

I would suspect some rogue app doing this, but I am careful with what I install, and only have trusted apps on the machine. \n\n\n\n\n\nA: According to this apple support discussion many are experiencing the same issue.\nOne way to get rid of is to install Grammarly for Mac and turn off apple spell check.\n\nA: Lets  first check your personal Spelling Dictionary for words you put in.\nIn Finder use Go-To\nGo to ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary\nOpen it to see your words and remove incorrect ones (if any).\nSpell check Flags\n, if it Flags a word and you know it is correct just add your correct word to your Spell check \"Add to Dictionary\" and ti will leave you alone on that.\nAutomatic Spell correction.\nOn High Sierra go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Text and uncheck Correct Spelling Automatically.

I'm currently in the process of developing some shell scripts but have run into a problem: whilst I am able to execute numerous commands on my Mac, when I try to run it on other people's computers I get Command not found errors indicating that they do not have the specific command line tools installed.\nIt is my belief that many of these tools come as a result of installing Xcode and other package managers like Homebrew. My question is: is there a list or another way of finding out if a specific command (tool) is pre-installed on a standard Mac computer (without Xcode installed) without having to manually test it on someone else's computer?\nFor example, this post hints that git is pre-installed which is only the case if you have installed Xcode, otherwise, git is unavailable. \nP.S.

Can you figure if your friend is sharing their location from their iPhone or  MacBook ?\n\nA: No. Apple lets people choose which device feeds the location for them. Apple lets them choose to share that location with you but not the name or type of system that feeds the geo location.\nYou get to see that location and not which device they chose to feed the location data. I'm not aware of any Mac client to input from iCloud find my friends, so you can be pretty sure they're not sharing from their Mac due to system design and not due to Apple letting you know what your friend chose.

I am trying to boot from a Windows 10 DVD, but it says something about installing it.\nI don't want to replace my existing OS with Windows 10. I just want to use some software with it. How do I do that?\n\nA: In order to use Windows you must first install it, you can't just boot from a CD and expect it to work. While that may be possible with some varieties of Linux, it is not with Windows (or macOS).\nIn order for us to help you you absolutely must provide the model of Mac you have and what version of macOS is installed on it. Edit your question and put that info there.\n\nA: Unlike some Linux distributions which come on a live CD/DVD (one you can boot off of without installing it on a disk), Windows 10 doesn't come with a live bootable CD/DVD. In order to run and use any software on it, one first needs to be install it.\nAs you do not wish to replace your existing OS, you can take either of the following two approaches:\n\n*\n\n*Installing alongside existing OS: You can create a multi boot system by installing Windows 10 alongside your current OS. Generally, it is possible to install Windows 10 alongside a macOS, Linux or other Windows installation.\nHowever, it involved complications such as hard disk partitioning, allocation space for the new OS and reclaiming the space once you are done. It may also involve risk of losing access to data or the existing OS installation. This approach is best left for power users and those seeking adventures :)\n\n\n*Installing as guest in a virtual machine: You can install Windows 10 as a guest OS using a OS virtualization software such as VMWare or Virtual Box. This is a very safe and easy approach to take. However, the prerequisite is to have a decently fast computer with adequate processor and RAM that can handle the load of running two OSes (Host + Guest) comfortably at the same time.\nI'd recommend the latter over former. It also gives you a safe way to try things out without the risk of breaking anything.\n", "Q: How to disable App Nap in 10.13.6?

(I am new to using ssh.)\n\nA: You are prompted for a file name, not a folder name (Enter **file** in which to save the key). So if you just reply with a file name the keys will be stored (with that name) in the current directory. You can just move them to .ssh/ manually if necessary. You probably also need to tell ssh to use your keys instead of the default ones (or you rename your keys to the default name). \n", "Q: How to extract photos from iPhone backup files I used iTunes to back up an iPhone. Now I want to get all the photos that were on the phone when it was backed up. Is there a way to do this without restoring the backup to a phone?\n\nA: Yes, there is, but all solutions are specific software products, which we are not allowed to recommend according to the rules of this site. Thus, I recommend that you Google “How to extract files from an iTunes backup” and you will find what you want. Some caveats, though, you should be aware of:\n1. Apple has protected a lot of personal data folders in Mojave, preventing many applications from accessing certain folders. Thus, you should pay attention to what macOS you are using and the compatibility of the software you want to use.\n2. You need also to check whether the software can extract a backup from iCloud if you need that. Some of them cannot do that, including the most used free option.\n", "Q: iOS video player app with short skip forward/backward feature I like the feature that YouTube has in their mobile app where you can double-tap the left and right edges of the player and it'll skip ahead slightly in that direction.

In-fact, the desktop app/Web app requires the mobile counterpart to be online in order to work.\nTo remove traces of any cached chat history from your desktop computer, simply log-out from WhatsApp macOS app or the Web App. You may also choose to uninstall the WhatsApp desktop client and clear Web browser history to ensure all the traces are removed.\nThe logout can also be performed from the within the WhatsApp mobile app if you don't have physical access to the desktop computer.\n", "Q: Create local backup of notes in Notes.app on macOS I'm using a company-issued MacBook where we cannot use iCloud to backup notes.

It was the only way.\nYou also need a good wifi connection and internet plan for this if you have tons of gigs of notes with photos, videos etc, I have 82GB: Notes replaced the rest for me. \n\nA: You may have copied the wrong directory, depending on your operating system.\nNewer operating systems (I believe El Capitan and above, but certainly Sierra and above) use this folder:\n~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/\n\nWithout iCloud there should be no issue with disappearing notes, which you would have to work around, if you were signed into iCloud Notes.\n\nA: Apple's official recommendation to backup notes is to save them in a text/document file or export as PDF.

My mother has a Samsung printer that works perfectly fine... except that it's not network enabled (it doesn't have WiFi). She wants to print to it using her iPad. Is there any way to do this?\n(The most obvious way would be to look for a AirPrint enabled print server, but as odd as it sounds, I haven't been able to find one anywhere. Does such a thing exist?)\n\nA: The retired Apple Airport Express is an AirPrint server and they can be found for around $50 used on eBay. Add the Airport Express to your home network as a wifi extender or second access point and it'll broadcast the printer availability on iOS devices connected to the network.\n\nA: Surprised that no one gave specifics.  If the printer is hosted on a Mac, use software such as Printopia (https://www.decisivetactics.com/products/printopia/) or HandyPrint (http://www.netputing.com/applications/handyprint-v5/) to share it out as an AirPrint device.\nObviously the hosting Mac and the iOS device(s) must be on the same wireless network.\nI use Printopia myself.\n\nA: Raspberry Pi (or any other system running Linux) + a few minutes of installing = homebrew AirPrint server. I use the same setup at home to share an older HP printer on the network for macOS and iOS devices. Works fine. CUPS+Avahi daemon does the trick. No issues printing from iOS. http://linuxwin.com/cups-airprint-on-raspberry-pi/\n\nA: According to this:\n\nAny AirPrint enabled wireless printer you need to be connected to a\n  WiFi network, the same to which your iDevice (iPhone or iPad) is\n  connected. The AirPrint is a protocol that make the iOS device NOT to\n  need a driver to print over WiFi.\n\nAs mentioned you can connect your printer to a computer alternatively. \n", "Q: Copy/Paste from documents (PDF, docx) - weird behaviour of diacritics When I copy text from PDF (Preview) or Docx (Pages) with Czech characters, some of the Czech characters get copied with their accent \"stuck\" to them. \nTo make this even weirder, this behaviour is pretty inconsistent: Sometimes \"ř\" is copied well, sometimes it isn't. Also, it doesn't seem to be connected to specific font. But I think this happens more often with fonts, that are not native for OSX (such as Cambria, which happens to be MS Office default).\n\nResult of CMD+C for \"í\": \"í́\"\nWhy is this happening?\nEdit\n\n\n*\n\n*OSX: 10.13.6 (although it happened to me on older OS and even other machines)\n\n*apps, I've copied the text from: Preview (PDF), Pages (doc, docx)\n\n*apps, where I've pasted the text to: anything (from Sublime text to text editor in StackExchange, see above)\n\n\nAlso, I've noticed that this happens often at the ends of words (possibly ends of lines). I will confirm this once it happens again, as the behaviour is frustratingly hard to reproduce.\n\nA: Regarding copy/paste from pdf, treatment of non-ascii characters can be botched by the particular pdf creation process.  Without info on how your pdf files were generated, such as the encoding and the fonts used, it's hard to determine why the results are not correct. \n\nA: What you are dealing with is one of the many symptoms of what I consider the bane of every modern programmer's existence: Unicode Normalization and interchanging character encodings.\nOne could literally write a 1000 page book just on the history of this chaos (and I wouldn't be surprised if someone has already), so I'll boil it down to the basics of what you're encountering here (and I'll be oversimplifying a bit), but then I'll give you some links for \"further reading\".\nFirst, lets make sure you've got your Input Menu in your menu bar: In System Preferences, open the Keyboard Preference Pane and tick the box under \"Input Sources\". Then from that menu item, open what is now called \"Show Emoji and Symbols\". at the top left of the window, select \"Customize List\", go to \"Code Tables\" and check \"Unicode\" and \"ISO-8859-1\". We'll do a brief lecture and then a demo.\nSo again, there are two interrelated but separate issues here:\n1. Character Encodings\nI consider this the root cause of this particular issue. The problem is that Microsoft has for years been notorious for not handling Unicode well because its platforms have more or less stuck with using an older implementation of multilingual character sets, known variously as \"wide characters\", UCS-2, or UTF-16. This system was implemented years ago, at a time when it was thought that 16 bits (to represent ~65,000 characters) would be sufficient to encode every symbol we'd ever need. Today, there are 1,114,112 standardized Unicode symbols.\nSo today, most systems (and everything Apple) use an encoding called UTF-8, a variable-width character encoding, where there's no set number of bits to encode any given character. This allows it to be backwards compatible with ASCII, and can also accommodate adding as new symbols and characters as we like.\nSo when copying text in and out of programs that use a different character set (like Microsoft's), the character set needs to be completely re-encoded, and converted, a process traditionally known as iconv, though there are literally dozens of implementations of how this is done.\n2. Unicode Combining Characters\nCompounding the issue of encodings is the fact that the Unicode standard has evolved over the years, and realized that in order to keep the number of unique characters limited to \"only\" in the millions, rather than billions, it might be best to have some characters be \"combining characters\", characters that modify the previous one in a regular way. By doing so, you don't need a separate entry for every letter with every accent variant, you just add a \"shared\" accent character to the original character. But it wasn't always done that way, so there are multiple ways of producing the same symbol. Yours is the perfect example.\n\nWe start with the symbol LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069):\ni\nNow, when you want to add the acute accent, Microsoft replaces it with\nLATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH ACUTE (U+00ED):\ní\nBut Apple, instead, adds a second character, COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301):\ń\nYou can do this yourself (here's where the Character Viewer comes in). Just type an i, then search combining acute in the Character Viewer, double-click the symbol, and voila:\ní\nWhich is, in fact  completely different than the first symbol, above. It is LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069) followed by  COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301). Copy and paste each into the Character Viewer, and you'll see what I mean.\nYes, both visually represent the same symbol. But if somehow along the line (usually around the same time as character set conversion), a UTF-8 process adds the combining character, but the original pre-combined character is retained? That is, what happens when the \"combined symbols\" approach is somehow added to the legacy version, rather than replacing it? Well, the \"combining character\" accent will still want to do its job.\nSo, when one combines  LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH ACUTE (U+00ED) with COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (U+0301):\ní́\nAnd there you have it.\nThere's a very famous Stack Overflow answer that demonstrates how far this can go.\n\nSome light reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)\n\n*Unicode in Microsoft Windows\n\n*Unicode fonts for Macintosh OS X\n\n*Apple Developer: Reading and Writing Strings\n\n*Apple Advanced Typography\n\n*Wikipedia: Character Encoding\n\n*Wikipedia: Combining Character\n\n*International Components for Unicode\n", "Q: Intermittently cant connect to VPN from Laptop, but always works from iPhone Ive got a few VPNs setup to different LANs, these are all IPSEC over LT2P connections and i manage them by OSX's built in VPN client inside system preferences > network. \nSometimes the VPNs will work fine, but sometimes i notice that i can not connect to any of my VPNs, and i get an error as per the below screenshot.

When clicking on Details, it says:\nThe digital signature is incorrect. The message may have been tampered with or corrupted since signed by (sender's name).\nWe are using S/MIME certificates signed by a self-signed root CA, but I doubt that this is the problem. When checking the certificates in the Keychain app, they are reported to be valid and good. However, if in Apple Mail, I get the above message and click on Show Certificate, the root certificate is reported to be valid and trusted, but the S/MIME certificate is nonetheless invalid for no obvious reason.\nNote that some report similar problems for emails with attachments only.\n\nA: This seems to be due to a bug in Apple Mail, at least in macOS 10.14.1, but possibly introduced in macOS 10.13.5 as an attempt to mitigate the EFAIL security hole. \nWhen Mail is set to not automatically load remote content (Preferences > Viewing > Load remote content in messages is not checked), then the warning message Unable to verify message signature is displayed for every S/MIME signed message. \nYou can get rid of the warning by either\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting Mail to automatically load remote content (set Preferences > Viewing > Load remote content in messages to checked) not recommended\n\n*Clicking on the \"Load Remote Content\" button displayed on the right of the warning message\n\n\nHowever, for security reasons, it is not recommended to load remote content unless it is from a trusted source.\nI consider this a major bug for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It makes no sense that the verification of signatures is dependent on loading remote content, because the signature file is an inline attachment\n\n*There was no such dependency before\n\n*The warning is strongly misleading\n\n\nI even consider this a severe security problem because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Loading remote content is considered a security problem that can even lead to the leakage of encrypted content as described by EFAIL\n\n*The user won't be able to have the message signature verified without loading potentially dangerous remote content\n\n\nThe fix was originally intended to stop the Mail app from loading HTML content without the user's consent. However, the way it is implemented now, this leads to also not loading the signature attachment. \n\nA: I had the same issue (Seeing unable to verify message signature).\nI recently set up an OCSP server for my email certs, and since then emails are properly showing up as verified in Apple Mail without loading remote contents.\n\n", "Q: How to deploy Automator workflow to clients? For a specific use case, I've developed a Folder Action workflow with Automator. When a file gets created in a folder 'abc', the workflow kicks of and executes a shell script.\nThis workflow needs to be installed / deployed to many client machines in corporate environments. While end users could be provided the setup instructions, this approach is prone to errors so I'm looking for a better approach.\nI'm aware that the actual workflow definition gets stored in:\n/Users/[user]/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions/*\n\nWhile the *.workflow/Contents/document.wflow does includes the folderActionFolderPath, copying the workflow from one client to another does not work as the Folder Action does not get enabled. It still needs to be enabled in Finder (Home folder --> right click on the folder --> Selecting 'Folder Action Setup...' from the drop down menu). I haven't found a way to automate this configuration step from the command line.\nHow can a system administrator install a Folder Action workflow on several client machines?\n\nA: If you really want to “idiot proof” the process, here is  option. In Script Editor.app, create a new blank document then immediately go and save it as an application (I saved mine as “JIMZ Attach Folder Action.app”)\nThe purpose of this application would be to copy the Automator workflow file (which will be included within the “Resources” folder of this new application you just created in Script Editor ) that you want attached to the “ABC” folder on any user’s computer, to the necessary “Folder Actions” folder on that computer.  If the “ABC” folder does not exist on the target computer, it will be created.  For purposes of this project, the “ABC” folder location would be on the target computer’s desktop.\nPaste this following code into your new blank AppleScript app that you just created.\nproperty nameOfTriggerFolder : \"ABC\"\nproperty pathToFolderActions : ((path to workflows folder as text) & \"Applications:Folder Actions:\")\nproperty attachFolderActionTo : (path to desktop as text) & nameOfTriggerFolder\n\nset resourceName to \"ABC Folder Action.scpt\"\nset folderActionScript to ((path to me as string) & \"Contents:Resources:\" & resourceName) as string\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if not (exists of folder attachFolderActionTo) then\n        make new folder at (path to desktop) with properties {name:nameOfTriggerFolder}\n    end if\n    duplicate file folderActionScript to folder pathToFolderActions with replacing\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Folder Actions Setup\"\n    activate\n    try\n        set addedFolderAction to make new folder action with properties {name:nameOfTriggerFolder, path:attachFolderActionTo}\n    end try\n    try\n        delay 0.5\n        tell addedFolderAction to make new script with properties {name:resourceName, path:(pathToFolderActions & resourceName)}\n    end try\n    if not folder actions enabled then\n        set folder actions enabled to true\n    end if\nend tell\n\nThen go ahead and drag your Automator workflow file from Finder app directly to the resources folder in Script Editor (as shown in the animation below)\n\nCompile and save the app in Script Editor.  Now you can distribute this app to whoever you want.  When this app is now launched on any target computer, it will copy the Automator workflow file directly to the folder where it needs to be located.  It will also add the “ABC” folder to the list of enabled folders in the Folder Actions Setup.app and attach the script or workflow file to that folder\n\nA: Similar in ilk to @wch1zpink's suggestion, I would consider formulating the Folder Action as a script rather than an Automator workflow, which would look something like this:\non adding folder items to directory after receiving fs\n\n    do shell script \"...\"\n\nend adding folder items to\n\nSaving this as either a .scpt or .applescript file, and moving it to ~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts, you can then script the creation of folder actions and attach them to folders like this:\nuse sys : application \"System Events\"\n\nproperty name : \"abc\"\nproperty path : \"/path/to/abc\"\nproperty folder action : a reference to folder action named (my name)\nproperty script : \"my folder action script.applescript\"\nproperty folder : a reference to Folder Action scripts folder\nproperty file : a reference to the file named (my script) in my folder\n\nset folder actions enabled to true\n\nif not (my file exists) then return open my folder\nif my folder action exists then return my folder action's scripts\n\nmake new folder action with properties {name:my name, path:my path}\ntell my folder action to make new script with properties ¬\n    {name:my file's name, POSIX path:my file's POSIX path}\n\nset my folder action's enabled to true\nset my folder action's scripts's enabled to true\n\nwhere \"my folder action script.applescript\" is the name of your saved folder action script; and the properties name and path represent the name and path to your monitored folder.\n", "Q: Show all button on finder On Finder, using the View as Icons grouped by document type, is it possible to visualize all the elements instead of to have to click every time on \"Show All\" button? \n\n\nA: Depending how many Folders/Files you have it is sometimes not possible to show all to fit in the screen.\nYou could try to reduce the Icon size (the slider at bottom right of the Finder widow), that helps to see more (or sometimes all) while loosing Icon clarity.\n", "Q: Group FaceTime link I would like to create a link for a FaceTime video call with multiple people.

Run the following command line:\nman ssh | col -b > ssh.txt\n\nA: The best reading experience for these tasks is achieved when using a dedicated application for that.\nTwo candidates:\nAquaLess\n\nAquaLess is a text pager for Mac OS X. It allows you to browse plain text files and -- more importantly -- text output from Unix command line tools. AquaLess is a Cocoa replacement for the less command, which is constrained to the terminal window. AquaLess opens a separate window for each text, so you can keep working in the terminal while you read.\n\nOr ManOpen\n\nManOpen is a MacOS X GUI application for viewing Unix manual pages, which are the standard documentation for Unix command line programs, programmer libraries, and other system information. It can open files directly or be given titles, in which case it will display the output from the `man' command-line program. An apropos interface is also provided, which is basically a quick-and-dirty search of the man page databases. Services are provided to other applications to open selected files/titles or do apropos searches using the selected text.\n  ManOpen can be useful for opening a man page without dropping down to the command line, browsing and searching through long and complex man pages, or simply for printing them out.\nAlso included is an `openman' command line tool, which is similar to man except it will display the man pages in ManOpen.app instead of directly to the terminal.\n\nOr read those pages in Safari? Then go bwana\n\nDownload Bwana and drop it into your applications folder. Then, without even running it, you can start viewing Unix manual pages using your browser. Just type \"man:\" followed by the man page you're looking for into your browser's URL field. Hit enter and let Bwana do the rest.\nThe man pages generated by Bwana are simple and to the point. We just threw in some color, some bold headers and cleaned it up a bit, so they go easy on the eye. In fact, Bwana is so simple - there's not much else we can say about it. So just download Bwana now to see how easy it integrates with your browser and what a difference it makes in viewing man pages.\n\nYou can then build a shell function for it like this:\n\nfunction sman\n    open -a Bwana man:$1\nend\n\n\nFor completeness sake: if you have X11 installed, then you also have xman. \nOther candidates might be Man Reader ($), Manpager, Manpower ($), Man Viewer.\n\nA: You can push plain text to the clipboard by piping to pbcopy, to paste anywhere as usual.\nman ssh | col -b | pbcopy\n\nor equivalent\nman -P \"col -b | pbcopy\" ssh\n\nthe latter of which is nicer if you want to use it as an alias, like mancp ssh, given:\nalias mancp='man -P \"col -b | pbcopy\"'\n\nThere are methods to go to HTML/PDF: Can man pages be converted to html and/or pdf format?\n\nIf it's just the nicer reading experience you're after, you can right-click on a selection of a command and open its man page as a separate window/tab, with normal scrolling and ⌘F find.\n\nYou can customise what this looks like in Terminal Preferences → Profiles, under the Man Page profile which is one of the default profiles to exist.\nThis includes font family and size (also see View menu) and background/foreground colours.\n\n\nA: If you like you have PDF copies of your manual pages, here is a function I added to my .bash_profile file to create a PDF of each BSD command I'd check the manual page for:\nmanp () \n{ \n    docDir=\"$HOME/Documents/BSD Commands\"\n    [[ ! -d $docDir ]] && mkdir -p \"$docDir\"\n    if [[ ! -f $docDir/$1.pdf ]]; then\n        man -t \"$1\" | pstopdf -i -o \"$docDir/$1.pdf\"\n        open \"$docDir/$1.pdf\"\n    else\n        open \"$docDir/$1.pdf\"\n    fi\n}\n\nSo, in Terminal, typing e.g. manp bash instead of man bash a PDF gets created, if it hasn't already been, and then opened by the app registered to handle PDF documents. The default is Preview, however on my system it's set to use Skim, as its search functionality is better then Preview and as a matter of fact will find the search string when Preview just will not.\nNote that the first time the function is used it will enumerate some fonts in the output in Terminal, however this is a one time enumeration of the fonts.\nThe nice thing about PDF copies is it maintains formatting, i.e. bold font and italics, etc.\n\nAs a side note, typing just the command name in Terminal and then right-click on it and select Open man Page, displays it in a fully scrollable and searchable Terminal window, which is much better then typing e.g. man bash.\n\nA: If you want to read the man page in Preview, nicely formatted as a PDF, you can run\nman -t ssh | open -f -a Preview\n\nOr\nman ssh | col -b | open -f -e\n\nto open the text version in TextEdit.\n\nA: Why make things more complicated than they are?\nhttps://man.openbsd.org/ssh\nSince you can post here, you obviously have access to the internet.\nIf you google around a bit you can probably find versions formatted in different ways, e.g., pdf or so.\n", "Q: Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard becomes unresponsive intermittently on mac I have a macbook pro running OS X v10.13.6 and am using the microsoft sculpt keyboard with it.

I would like to add non-SMS, non-Apple multi-factor authentication to my Apple ID.\n\nI'm most interested in using a \"code generator\"-type Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) based on RFC 6238 implemented by client apps such as:\n\n*\n\n*Google Authenticator\n\n*Microsoft Authenticator\n\n*Yubico Authenticator\n\n*Authy\n\n*1Password\n\n*LastPass\n\n*etc.\n\nI do not see any such option. Is this type of authentication available for Apple ID?\nI would also be interested in adding YubiKey or other similar hardware \"security keys\". Or any other non-SMS, non-Apple multi-factor solutions.\n\nNote: I am able to add Apple's proprietary \"two-factor authentication for Apple ID\" integrated within iOS and macOS as an alternative to SMS-based \"two-step verification\". This question is asking instead for a 3rd-party-compatible two-factor mechanism that does not involve using an Apple device signed in to iCloud.\n\nRelated:\n\n*\n\n*Does TOTP in 1Password work with Apple ID?\n\n\n*Developer Apple ID’s to Require Two-Factor Authentication\n\nA: Apple has announced that starting in \"early 2023,\" security keys will be available for iCloud.\nHowever, there is no indication this will support non-physical security keys. The screenshots Apple has provided clearly show a requirement to insert/tap your key, rather than to setup a code-generating app.\nIt is likely that the SMS requirements could be waived if one of these were to be set up, but that is not known at this time.\n\nSecurity Keys\nApple introduced two-factor authentication for Apple ID in 2015. Today, with more than 95 percent of active iCloud accounts using this protection, it is the most widely used two-factor account security system in the world that we’re aware of. Now with Security Keys, users will have the choice to make use of third-party hardware security keys to enhance this protection. This feature is designed for users who, often due to their public profile, face concerted threats to their online accounts, such as celebrities, journalists, and members of government. For users who opt in, Security Keys strengthens Apple’s two-factor authentication by requiring a hardware security key as one of the two factors. This takes our two-factor authentication even further, preventing even an advanced attacker from obtaining a user’s second factor in a phishing scam.\n\n\nA: No, you cannot use TOTP-authentication as implemented by for example Google Authenticator (i.e. RFC6238) with Apple-ID. The only supported system is Apple's own system, which works very similarly to TOTP.\nThis hasn't got anything to do with the SMS-requirement at all.\nAs a collary to the above, hardware-based OATH-TOTP solutions such as a YubiKey won't work with Apple-IDs either.\nStarting next year, Apple is going to start supporting hardware Security Keys. The supported keys are physical, and they communicate with an iPhone or iPad over Lightning, USB-C or NFC.\nThose keys are not TOTP-based, and so you will still not be able to use the listed third party app authenticators, such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator.\nIt is currently unclear whether Apple will allow using Security Keys only on Apple devices (such as iPhone and iPads) - or it will be generally available on desktop computers as well. Your request for a third party solution that does not require an iPhone or iPad means that it is still unclear whether a third party hardware solution could be used at all - even if the requirement of it being TOTP-based was removed.\n", "Q: drive file stream has encountered a problem and has stopped I had installed Google Drive File Streaming and it was working fine until I upgraded to Mojave.

Normally one would first hex dump the beginning of disk0s2 to see if the content matches what is expected for a APFS container. Apparently, the is difficult from Recovery mode. A last resort would be to see if the APFS magic number would be the characters NXSB. This can done by entering the commands given below.\ndd if=/dev/disk0s2 count=4 skip=32 bs=1 2>/dev/null; echo\n\nIf the partition is a APFS container, then the following be output.\nNXSB\n\n\nNote: Any error messages produced by dd command will not be shown.

I am selling away my iPhone 5s as I wish to upgrade to a new one. The IMEI number mentioned on the back side of the device is scratched.\nHow do I determine the IMEI and Serial Number of the device.\nIs there anything else that needs to be taken care of before giving away the iPhone?\n\nA: You can easily determine the IMEI and the serial number by going to Settings app → General → About and looking for fields named IMEI and Serial Number (along with host of other information).\n\nThere's also an Apple support document titled Find the serial number or IMEI on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch which is worth going through.\nThe other crucial step to take before giving away your iPhone is to make sure you have synced all your important data (Contacts, Photos, Notes etc.) to iCloud. Also, make sure to create a backup of your iPhone if you wish to restore it to a new iPhone. The backup can be created either on iCloud or an Mac or a Windows computer using iTunes.\nOnce you have backuped up all the important user data, make sure you sign out of iCloud. To sign out of iCloud, go to Settings app, tap on your name shown with profile picture (this should be the first item just below the Search bar), scroll down and tap on Sign Out (last item shown in red).\n \nYou may also be asked to turn off Find My iPhone. Do so by tapping on iCloud on the same screen and than tap on Find My iPhone. Toggle to turn off the switch shown in front of Find My iPhone.\n \nWhen signing out, iPhone prompts you to choose between deleting or keeping data (Contacts, Notes, Reminders etc.) locally on device. It is recommended to delete the data from device as you are giving it away. As an extra security measure, it's recommended to factory reset the device. Do so by going to Settings app → General → Reset and tap on Erase All Content and Settings. You may be prompted to provide the device passcode.\n\nOnce the device is erased, do not set it up again before giving away. It is possible to see the IMEI number even on an iPhone that isn't setup.\nIt's recommended to go through the Apple support document What to do before you sell, give away, or trade in your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch and make sure to follow all the official guidelines.\n\nA: Just type *#06# from you iphone to get your IMEI no.\n", "Q: How do I install FFserver on macOS?

Every time I reboot it, for some reason it detects that the name windowlick is already in use on the network and renames itself with a random suffix, e.g. windowlick (3829) or the like, and it gets a zeroconf/bonjour hostname of windowlick-2.local instead of the usual windowlick.local.\nI can manually fix this by going to the Sharing preferences panel, but I'd rather not have to do this, especially since I often do remote access from an external network (via ssh to another machine that gets the incoming port assignment) and if my machine rebooted due to a power failure or a system update I don't like having to guess at the hostname.\nMy computer gets its IP address via DHCP assignment from the router (a recent Netgear); it also behaved this way on my previous router (an Apple Time Capsule). It has a reserved IP address for its wired Ethernet port, but it connects via both Ethernet and Wi-Fi (which does not have an address reservation). I suspect that something to do with name assignment is doing something weird with the order of operations on the Wi-Fi vs. Ethernet interfaces.\nUnfortunately, I cannot simply disable Wi-Fi, as I make use of OS features that require that my Wi-Fi be active (for example, Unlock with Apple Watch).\nIs there any way to tell macOS to not be \"polite\" and rename itself if it sees \"another\" machine by the same name?\nThis seems similar to My Mac mini's computer name keeps changing when it resumes from sleep but I don't have the problem when resuming from sleep, it's only after a reboot, and I already have the static IP assignment per the accepted answer on that question. Also, this doesn't happen on my MacBook (which does not have a static assignment).\n\nA: For what it's worth, I had this exact same problem and also need to have both wifi and ethernet enabled on my iMac. It started after upgrading to Mojave, my router is an Asus RT-AC88U and had until Mojave been fine. After the update I started getting the message in macOS about a duplicate computer name on my network and my computer changed it's name from \"iMac\" to \"iMac (2)\" - but within a few days is was up to \"iMac (2000)\" and kept rising.\nSpoke to Apple, they suggested deleting the wifi adapter and re-adding it in Mojave which didn't fix it. The only other thing they suggested was a rebuild of macOS from scratch. \nI tried all the other fixes suggested everywhere, disabling wifi (not good as I also want to be able to unlock my mac with my apple watch) - but the problem does go away, renaming network locations, rebooting router, delete and re-add ethernet and everything else I came across. I also had the smart wifi option enabled on the router to combine the 2.4G and 5G SSID in to a single name broadcast (the router then assigns devices to the correct band) - it was suggested this might also be a problem so I put the router back to 2 different SSID's for the different bands. Nothing fixed the issue. \nThen I realised that my ethernet adapter had a fixed IP address that I gave it but the wifi adapter was on DHCP. I had also reserved the fixed IP address on the router for ethernet but not wifi. So I reserved the 2 addresses I wanted for both adapters on the router and then set them to DHCP on the iMac. I also made sure that the Advanced settings for the IP address had a different DHCP Client ID name specified just to be sure. \nSo far so good, the iMac hasn't changed it's name in a few days now.\n\nA: Recommend you try following in Terminal to make your windowlick static\nsudo scutil –-set HostName new_hostname\n\nsudo scutil –-set LocalHostName new_hostname\n\nsudo scutil –-set ComputerName new_hostname\n\n\nA: The problem is you have a multi-homed host on the same network; two simultaneous network connections. \n\nIt has a reserved IP address for its wired Ethernet port, but it\n  connects via both Ethernet and Wi-Fi (which does not have an address\n  reservation).\n\nThere's no reason to do this.\nDisconnect your WiFi (IMO) wired is better.  Reboot and your host name should stick.\nYou can't have the same host name for different adapters on the same network.  If windowlick.local had two IP addresses on the same network, which IP would it go to if you issued a ping windowlick command?  This is why it automatically renamed the hostname.\nHowever, you can have the same hostname on different subnets.  For example, WiFi was on the 192.168.1.0 network and Ethernet was on 192.168.2.0 network..\n\nA: I’ve had that same renaming issue for a while when keeping both my ethernet and WiFi interfaces active. I just found out that the aliases I had created in my ISP router to easily keep track of all my devices (mac addresses) connecting to it was triggering this. I was using the same alias name for both mac addresses. I now added -ETH and -WiFi to the alias name in my router to uniquely identify the ethernet and WiFi connections from my computer.\nDid the trick for me. Both interfaces on same network with hostname of my computer no longer changing.\n", "Q: How to change Open/Save dialog speed Open/Save dialogs on my Mac (macOS 10.14.1) delay about 0.5 to 1 seconds.\nHow do I change this delay to zero seconds?\n\nA: You can change the speed of the Save/Open dialogs with Terminal.

I'm wondering if there is a way to turn off the Physical sim and use only the eSim on my iPhone XS Max. I travel a lot and I'm loving the use of eSIM. \nI understand that I can turn off the eSIM if its required, but I wanted to know if there was any way to turn the Physical Sim off and leave only the eSim ON.\nNote - I have an unlocked iPhone XS Max.\n\nA: I found the option buried under Mobile Data Settings. There is an option which states \"Turn On this line\". Toggle this ON/OFF to turn off the network.\nThis works for both Physical SIM and eSim.\nAt any given time, You could -\n\n\n*\n\n*Have Physical Sim ON and eSim OFF.\n\n*Have eSim ON and Physical Sim OFF.\n\n*Have both the Sim turned OFF.\n\n\n\n\nA: You cannot as such turn off the physical SIM card only.\nYou can however take out the physical SIM-card from the holder. The phone will still work, and you'll be able to use the eSIM to access carrier services.\nIf you haven't got an eSIM already, and you want the same carrier for the eSIM - please check your carrier's web site or support contact. Some times it is possible to transfer your subscription free of charge to an eSIM instead of a physical SIM - leaving the SIM-slot free to use for other carriers when travelling.\nNot all carriers support eSIM yet though, so your mileage might vary!\nIf you really want to just turn off the physical SIM card without removing it from the phone, you could turn off and on the phone without entering the SIM PIN-code. The SIM card will not be active then (even though it is physically powered on). However, it will be annoying as the phone prompts you to enter the PIN-code when trying to make calls, etc.\n", "Q: How to split CSV file by Column values into multiple files on a Mac? awk?

The description for the last one reads: \"Enter the password you use to unlock the Mac ...\". \nWhat password does this refer to? I hesitate to type in lots of passwords without better information on what's going on here. I do own both an iPhone and a MacBook and use the same Apple ID account on both.\n\nA: You should ignore this and click cancel. This screen is an undocumented part of Apple's security practices (i.e. they don't mention it in their own documentation anywhere) and it exposes you to the risk that Apple will store, or could compromise (possibly resulting from a warrant/writ) your password for your local device.\nThis is documented further here https://privacylog.blogspot.com/2019/05/security-flaws-with-apples-two-factor.html\n\nA: So the mystery is now apparently solved. The 3rd password required (apparently) was the macOS user password of the account where I use the same Apple ID on my Mac. \nThis password was not accepted in the third verification step in my case (apparently) because I had used the same Apple ID (partly for testing purposes in relation to this very issue) with different user accounts on that Mac. This is clearly a corner case, because most Macs presumably only have single accounts installed.\nThe issue went away by choosing \"Forgot Mac Password?\" and then \"Reset Encrypted Data\" when iOS prompted for the 3rd password. The detailed description of the last steps reads as follows:\n\nEnd-to-end encrypted data stored in iCloud will be permanently\n  deleted. This may include Messages in iCloud, saved passwords and home\n  data. Are you sure you want to continue?\n\nI've been told that despite of this description what would be deleted is only credentials, and the fact that I can still see e.g. calendar items shared via iCloud on both my iPhone and Mac after performing this procedure seems to confirm this.\nAfter this intervention, iOS no longer reminds me that I should \"Update Apple ID Settings\" and everything seems back to normal.\n", "Q: Flash firmware without CH341A programmer In this Answer, user @y-h-wong commented that he flashed the bootrom without using a programmer. I'm guessing this was done from terminal somehow. Not sure if this is done from within OSX or from recovery terminal. Does anyone have the steps to do this?\nIs the extraction process the same as if you were using the programmer?\nI would like to install the full NVME bootrom drivers on my macbook air 2014 to enable hibernation properly.\nA guide on MacRumors provided the step-by-step instructions to upgrade your SSD.\n\nA: I guess the flashing itself should not be that much of a problem (see https://gist.github.com/elvisizer/2dfa119e959ae6f35389d4d56054f067 for further description)\nThe main point AFAIK is to inject a newer NVME driver into the (pre 2015) SCAP EFIPayload file that needs to be flashed.\nIf I understand correctly, @y-h-wong raw-edited the SCAP file (with hex editor e.g.) and copied the NVME driver from a newer Bootrom into the update for your pre 2015 MBA/MBP. The SCAP files can be extracted from the latest Mojave InstallESD (Packages/FirmwareUpdate.pkg/Scripts/Tools/EFIPayloads).\nEdit:\nOk I just learnt that you can replace the NVME part using UEFI-Tool. This means, a new SCAP file can be built like that.\nI'm just not yet confident enough on this to flash it using the mentioned commands, as I don't have any flashing hardware available right now and don't want to kill my system in case something goes wrong.\nEdit2:\nOk, I now understand the UEFITool will only provide cap files, not scap files - meaning the file is not signed. I guess that's the reason why simple injection of the NVME section of the scap does not work like this.\n", "Q: GPU memory is overloaded I'm using iStats Menu to monitor the loading of my MBP.\nAnd when my external 4k monitor LG 27UK850-W is connected via USB type C I can see that my GPU Memory is overloaded (currently 744%), though Processor seems fine.\nIs it a bug or it should be this way?\nAnd of course, Fans are almost always on.

On iOS, in my case the iPad Air 2, games typically run in fullscreen, i.e. the status bar at the top is hidden. If I want to view the time, I have to pull down the Notification Center, which requires two swipes near the center of the upper edge of the screen, which in turn typically requires changing the grip on the device.\nIs there any more convenient way to view the time during gameplay? Maybe even continously displaying the clock?\n\nA: Most fullscreen apps, (majority of games and video player/streaming apps), are programmed to hide the Status Bar. So, it is not possible by any means to have the clock continuously displayed while playing the game/video.\nSince you are concerned about losing the grip of the device and do not want to move your hand much (to perform the swipe down gesture), there's an alternate approach you can take. Without moving your hands and pausing the game, simply press the power button of the device to put it in sleep mode. The game/video will be paused automatically.\nNow, quickly press the Home button (without unlocking the device) to show the lock screen which will also display the time. Now, use Touch ID to unlock the iPad and un-pause to resume playing the game/video. (This approach is assuming that you have enabled Touch ID to unlock your iPad. The goal here is to wake the device without unlocking it. Act accordingly if you do not use Touch ID to unlock your iPad.)\nThe aforementioned can be performed (in most cases) without losing the grip of the device. Works best in landscape orientation (and with large hands ). I too take this approach when playing games on iPad.\n\nA: Unless you've jailbroken your iPad, no.\nIf you have a jailbroken device however, there is a tweak that does this.\n", "Q: Copy and paste image in Safari I have issues copying an image from website into clipboard and then pasting it on another website in Safari (e.g. Messenger or Facebook).

It just copies the link. What you have to do is right click on the image you wish to copy and select download image. You can then open the image in preview and copy it or you can upload an image to the web page.\n", "Q: How can I set dark mode for Word documents Microsoft recently released the Dark Mode for MS Office for Mac. While the Dark Mode sets the interface to dark color palette, the page area itself still remains white and the text is black.\nHow can I set the page to dark mode, i.e. dark page area and light font color? \nOr does keeping the page area white follow some kind of Apple design guidelines? But again, in BBEdit you can select a theme with dark background and light text. \n\n\nA: The easiest way is to create a new template file:\nFile -> New Document\n\nclick on Design tab then click on Page Color icon and select More Colors.\nThere, you can use a color picker to sample you favorite color (I picked #282a36 in the Dracula theme in BBEdit) and set this color as your page color. \nAnd after that, select\nFile -> Save as Template\n\nand then Save. \nFrom now on, when you open Word, select\nFile -> New from Template\n\nand select your template. \n\n", "Q: How to resolve \"No 3D support is available from the host\" error in VMware Fusion 11 Immediately after I upgraded from VMware Fusion 10.x to 11.0.1, I got the following error when trying to start the VM of any \"advanced\" OS like Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04, which worked perfectly fine in VMware Fusion 10:\nNo 3D support is available from the host.\nThe 3D features of the virtual machine will be disabled.\n\nAfter several hours of digging around and experimentation, I sorted out the answer which I'll post below.\n\nA: *\n\n*Revert to VMware Fusion 10.x, and open that app.  It may prompt you to allow something in System Preferences and such; do so.\n\n*Start up every VM that is not in a fully shut-down state (anything you can \"Resume\").  Shut each down entirely.\n\n*Upgrade again to VMware Fusion 11.\n\n*For each VM in which you need 3D stuff, go into its Settings and pick the Compatibility tab, then Advanced Options drop-down, then select Use Hardware Version: 16.\n\n*Then in the Display tab, turn on Accelerate 3D Graphics (if it's not on already), and set the Shared Graphics Memory you need.\n\n*Shut down VMware Fusion.\n\n*Edit your main VMware Fusion preferences file. This should be \"~/Library/Preferences/VMware Fusion/preferences\". Add the following lines (or edit any that are present to make them conform), then save the file:\nmks.enableMTLRenderer = \"0\"\nmks.enableGLRenderer = \"1\"\nmks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = \"TRUE\"\n\n\n*If you have a 2013 or later Mac, and a recent version of macOS, and are running the Metal 2 3D graphics library, you can try setting the first of those (the MTL one) to \"1\", and could try setting the one below it (GL) to \"0\", but I have not tested this personally.\n\n*If it still doesn't work, shut down the VM, and VMware Fusion, then go find your VM in the macOS filesystem, right-click or ctrl-click it, and pick \"Show package contents\". Open its [whatever].vmx file, and add the mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = \"TRUE\" line to that file as well. Save the file.\n\n*Under no circumstances should you fire up the VM entirely (i.e., past the point where you get a login screen and can pick the option to shut the VM down) until this \"No 3D support\" problem is fixed. That is apt to really booger something up.\n\n*If you just cannot get it to work at all, set the VM's Hardware Level back to 14, and its VRAM (Display > Shared Graphics Memory) back to no more than 2048 (the max in VMware 10), then downgrade the VMware app back to VMware Fusion 10.x.  In that, see if there's an option to go to Hardware Level 15; if not, leave it at 14.  Your VMs should now work properly again. If not, undo the two changes made to the config files (preferences and *.vmx).\n\n*If it did work in VMware Fusion 11, then after restarting your VM fully, re-install VMware Tools from within the VM. This will upgrade the video drivers, etc., to VMware Fusion 11 versions.\n\n\nWhat seems to have happened was that either Hardware Version 14 did support DirectX and this support was removed, or there was a Version 15 that did and that entire version was removed. Either way, any VMs under VMware Fusion 10.x that supported DirectX, under the highest Hardware Version then available, suddenly lost that ability in VMware Fusion 11.x, until upgraded to Hardware Version 16.  And on top of this, VMware silently assumed everyone was using Metal 2 and had abandoned OpenGL, which of course isn't true.\nOn the up side, you now get up to 3GB shared VRAM instead of 2GB, so you'll be able to play some less-ancient games and use slightly more modern 3D-rendering apps. However, VMware is still lagging badly on 3D support (DirectX 10 has been obsolete since 2008, so VMware's a decade behind user needs – it's still stuck at DirectX 10.1).\nCredits:\n\n\n*\n\n*Charles Green and Amandeep Dhindsa in this Ubuntu VMware Workstation thread at Stack Exchange: https://askubuntu.com/questions/537787/enable-3d-hw-acceleration-on-vmware-workstation-10-on-ubuntu-14-04/1095171#1095171\n\n*Mikero in this Macs and VMware Fusion thread at VMTN: https://communities.vmware.com/thread/597366\n\nA: By experiment, I found out with Prefer External GPU checked on Catalina:\nIf you enable on Fusion 11.5 High Performance Graphic support on Windows 10 guest with above lines added to preferences, it will use Open GL framework from dGPU. If you, however, disable High Performance Graphic support for the guest entirely, it will use eGPU, probably via Metal. Open GL with subjectively similar performance to host, perhaps bogged down by number of vCores assigned. \n\nI ran a few WebGL demos and I can see eGPU (Vega 64 FE) utilized to 30% before hitting limits on CPU allocation (2C in my case). Performance with eGPU is significantly better than performance with 5500M dGPU where I see GPU maxed out before CPU.\n", "Q: Renaming Files in Finder using Keyboard When renaming files in Finder I end the renaming with \"Enter\" which irritatingly opens the file. Websearch tells me that the \"Enter\"-key should start (and end) renaming while Cmd+O opens a file. \nHow do I restore that behaviour or by which keycommand has it been replaced? Did I change this myself (inadvertently, like, a while ago), or has Apple changed it??\nEDIT:\nAfter getting the answer that this behaviour has NOT changed, I looked into what could have changed it again and found that I activated this behaviour in Karabiner-Elements.

Max light is needed apparently. \n\nA: When you select the camera on the Preview.app, It should open the camera up. You need keep some distance between the FaceTime camera and the white paper only then Preview.app will pick it up.\n\n*\n\n*If it's kept too close, the signature will not be picked up.\n\n*keep the paper stable as the camera will not detect if the paper wobbles around.\n\n*Place a light behind the camera shining towards the paper if needed. Strong contrast helps the signature detection.\n\n\n\nA: As other have mentioned in the comments, it really seems to need a lot of light on the paper (probably so it can see the contrast). Much more than you would normally need for doing FaceTime call for example.\nPlace a strong light source behind your MacBook/webcam (e.g. room light, window, or flashlight) so that its light falls strongly on the paper with the signature. Then slowly move the paper towards the camera.\n\nA: Another option that you can try is to take a colored paper and use a different kind of pencil.\nFor me it was very easy using a beige one, which got recognized immediately\n", "Q: how to open password protected 7zip archive on OSX As the title says, I'm looking for a way to open password protected 7zip archive.

I've tried deleting the entire contents of the user's home folder in the Terminal while running as another user (rm -rf /users/testuser/*), but Spotify would start anyway.\nWonder how they do that? It's pretty easy to check by downloading and running the app, there's no need to even create an account.\nThe point of the question is to understand the mechanism rather than actually stop it from opening (there's a switch in the app).\n\nA: A lot of functionality, like login items, extensions/kexts, LaunchAgents or other Helpers can be packed into the application bundle these days.\nIf you look closely at the content of the Spotify.app, by right- or control clicking it and selecting \"Show Package Contents\", you'll find a \"Library\" folder enclosed in the Content's folder.  Within it there is a LoginItems folder, containing the login item.\n    /Applications/Spotify.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems/StartUpHelper.app/Contents/MacOS/StartUpHelper\nThis \"StartUpHelper\" will launch Spotify at login.  This seems to be the application's default behaviour.\nYou wrote:\n\nOtherwise it would start for every new user added to the system.\n\nI certainly have seen Spotify auto-launch on a user created after it had been installed, logging out of the user that created the new account and setting up the new user account from the login screen (alternatively two restarts were needed for Spotify to launch at login in the new user account). Only when Spotify got installed after the user was created, did it not launch at login.\nA test in an attempt to explain, why some users will not see the auto-launch of Spotify at login:\nI created and set up a new user before Spotify was installed on a different user account and, after Spotify was installed (again in a different user account), tried several logouts/logins and restarts to make sure it didn’t auto-launch at login for this new user. I also noted the user’s DARWIN USER DIRECTORY running the following command...\ngetconf DARWIN_USER_DIR\nI also had a user for whom Spotify auto-launched at login every single time.  Again I noted the user’s DARWIN USER DIRECTORY.\nLogged into this last mentioned user I quit Spotify and deleted...com.apple.LaunchServices-231-v2.csstore ...from the Darwin User Directory. Then I copied the same file from the other user’s Darwin User Directory (for whom Spotify didn’t auto-launch at login) over to this user’s directory (in Finder, to make sure the file’s owner would also change).\nThen I logged out and rebooted several times into the user, for whom Spotify did auto-launch, but the behaviour stopped and Spotify refrained from launching.\nPS. For further in depth information on login items within an application bundle, I’d suggest signing up for a free Developer account and getting acquainted with (some of) the documentation on application design (you don't have to sign up though, just to read the documentation).\n", "Q: How can I reduce timeout for ssh when network is down?

I have created a couple of quartz filters to reduce the size of PDFs. For this I use Image Compression - which is pretty straight forward (just use JPEG and the a suitable quality level) - but there is also a filter called Image Sampling that also offers a quality level (low, medium, high).\nI have tried it but I don't notice any significant difference. On what quality of the PDF is this option supposed to apply?\nThe other alternatives (size, resolution, scaling) in the Image Sampling filter are straightforward but I don't understand why there is a quality option in both Image Sampling and Image Compression.\n\nA: As Apple's documentation on Quartz Filters is almost non-existent, it's hard to be certain. However, given the nature of the component, the \"Quality\" of the re-sampling is likely to relate to what algorithm is used to re-resolve the image.\nIf you've ever re-sampled an image in Photoshop, different algorithms are used to perform the mathematical transformation, such as Bicubic, Bilinear, and Nearest Neighbour. The differences may be subtle, or not, depending on the nature of the image and the change in size.\nQuality in Image Compression relates to how lossy the compression will be, i.e. how much data is thrown away to reduce file size.\n(If the images in the PDF are already low-res and also JPEG, then you may not see much further reduction in file size or image quality.)\n", "Q: MacOS default folders missing I noticed, I am missing some of my default folders in the finder (Public, Sites, Movies, Library).\nHowever I can list them in the terminal and enter them with the cd command.\nI tried to use chflags nohidden, to make them visible in the finder again, but nothing happened.\nIs there any other way, to make them visible again in the finder?\nEdit:\n\nA: I think that it's a permissions problem.\ndiskutil resetUserPermissions / `id -u`\n\nAfter entering the diskutil command, if Terminal says that permissions reset on user home directory failed (error -69841), enter chflags -R nouchg ~ and enter the diskutil command again.\nYou can also double-check whether your user Library folder is set properly.

It is highly unlikely the contents of the files are being read and filtered to decide if they can be selected. Doing this would be both a security risk and a performance nightmare.\nGiven that, assume there is a file extension or pattern the open dialog is looking for. Being a Java process it is possible the comparison is case sensitive or looking for Window's style extensions rather than UNIX, .TXT vs .txt, or .text vs .txt.\nJava Security\nAlternatively, it is possible that security restrictions are stopping the Java applet from allowing you to select files on your computer.\nUse the /Applications/Utilities/Console.app to look for error and warning messages reported by any java processes. If a security restriction is in force, a log message is likely.\nJava Control Panel\nSystem Preferences > Java > Java Control Panel\nWithin the Java Control Panel on macOS are numerous security and advanced settings that can limit the actions of a Java process.\nCheck you have the latest version of Java installed. Also check the security settings. Ensure warnings are shown for Mixed code verification and maybe enable the Java console to Show console.\n\nReport the Bug\nIf none of this works, be sure to report the problem to the bank. They may know about this problem and be able to supply a solution.\n\nA: The application may be looking for a file with the extension .txt. For example; yourfilename.txt. TextEdit will add this extension automatically to text files that it opens. You should try opening your file in TextEdit and see if it adds the extension. If it opens the file but doesn't save it with .txt at the end, do a Save As and add the extension manually.\n", "Q: Is Java UDP communication broken on macOS? I've been trying to figure out why a Java program that uses UDP communication on Windows works 100% fine but seems to regularly drop packets on a macOS build of the JVM (8.x).\nI saw another thread on StackExchange that was never really answered, but it appears that one of the people noticed a similar issue on OSX there as well.\nI don't have the standard firewall enabled in preferences nor do I believe I have any special network settings which would interrupt UDP datagrams. As well, if I run the same program on a Windows 7 VM via VirtualBox on the same hardware, the program works just fine.\nAny ideas of what to look for or if this is a known issue?\nUPDATE 2018-11-24: More details. I'm running Java 1.8.0_92-b14 from Oracle on a MacPro3,1 and macOS 10.13.6. The program I'm running is ADTPro 2.0.2 as an ethernet server trying to communicate with an old Apple //e that has an Uthernet II running the other side of ADTPro. It is software to transfer disk images to/from the machines.\nThe problem is that transfers often timeout and abort and it appears that packets are getting lost and the code isn't sophisticated enough to error correct and resend/retry. Looking at the source code, it appears everything is in UDP which definitely raises suspicions. According to the maintainer on GitHub, the fact that it is using UDP is historical and nobody has done the work to convert it to TCP. Given that the software works just fine talking to a Windows machine with the same software and Java versions, I'm guessing it is something with macOS or the OSX Java build and asking if anyone knows how to determine for sure or otherwise. Does that help?\n\nA: No - UDP isn't fundamentally broken on macOS (or any of the other AppleOS)\nThe definition of UDP is unicast data packets and due to the send and forget nature of the casting, delivery of these is sometimes jokingly called unreliable data packets. \nAs a troubleshooting step, my first triage step would be to establish that the switch and router are actually delivering the packets to the macOS interface. Wireshark or a management tool on your network would be excellent tools to record these packets to see if they are being delivered.\nI wouldn't worry about people saying TCP is more or less reliable than UDP since UDP has many technical advantages for streaming performance and you are on the correct path focusing on a specific java application that consumes data on a specific Mac in your network. Lots of your details are good, but it's kind of like detailing the pressure in the tires and the color of the paint when you actually need to know if the driver took a right down your street.\nAre you able to run Wireshark and verify the packets or get access to the network logs to verify the sender and also you might need to do a little research on UDP and ask a follow on question if this actually is more about networking.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5970383/difference-between-tcp-and-udp\n\nA: Had a basic problem even with binding a datagram socket using Java 8. Game changing was to reduce send/receive buffer size to 8K by socket options.\n", "Q: I created a new folder on the terminal and is not shown in the finder I came across this issue in my new mac book pro. I created a folder using iterm and I have some content on it (I cloned a git repo). When I go to finder I don't see it.\nSo maybe I'm not in the right folder... but I tried to create the folder in the finder and I get the \"folder already exists\" error but still I don't see it.\nIm using mojave 10.14.1\n\nA: One of the most probable cause for this to happen is that you inadvertently entered a name which the Finder isn't able to display correctly (or doesn't display to protect us from the complexity of the underlying Unix filesystem).\nTo check this hypothesis, please from iTerm go into the parent directory of the one you created let's say its name is foo bar and enter:\nls -aBdl 'foo bar'\n\nThe -B option will display any non printable character as a \\xxx where xxx is the octal value of the non printable character.\nThis option is very helpful to deal with filenames which cause problems to shells and graphical interfaces like the Finder.\n\nA: Unless you gave it a very common name you can use locate filename from the terminal. This will list all occurrences of the character string 'filename'. It lists the complete path of all the matches it finds. I would go to the directory above the one you thought you created file in and run the locate command from there.\n", "Q: ssh from my mac hangs after authenticating anywhere, regardless of app. It's definitely the mac. Ideas? I have a MacBook Pro running Mojave 10.14.1.  When I try to ssh anywhere, after entering my password, the ssh session hangs immediately after authentication.  Regardless of ssh app!  And I'm baffled.\nThe facts:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is just straight up ssh from the command line - no X forwarding or anything.\n\n*All other network on the Mac is fine (Safari, Outlook, Screen Sharing, etc.)\n\n*ssh does this regardless of destination.  I did quite a lot of diagnosis, but just to completely eliminate the server side, I did this: (1) gen'd a new ssh key, (2) spun up a new Deb 9 VM at Digital Ocean with that key, (3) tried ssh with that key.  Hung in the exact same spot with the exact same error.  Used the key on another system and it worked fine, as expected.\n\n*It does this regardless of application.  By that I mean I see the same behavior in macOS native Terminal, iTerm2, and RoyalTS.  Weird!  I assume they're all using some common library underneath but...what?\n\n*FileZilla using SFTP and the same credentials (and port) works just fine.\n\n*If I sudo to root on the Macbook and try the same ssh, I get the same result.\n\n*There is no VPN running on the mac (or the servers).\n\n*Below is a session example from a server on  my LAN.  I know I was able to ssh to this server on Monday morning.  Still works coming from other systems.  In this case I'm going over wifi to a server that is on Ethernet on the same subnet.\n\n*This is not a DNS timeout (i.e., fixed by UseDNS).\n\n*Exact same behavior regardless if password or key.  Ends at the same \"open confirm rwindow\" spot with the same error.\n\n\nJust to sex up the story:\n\n\n*\n\n*I sent this system in to Apple via the Genius Bar for a screen replacement (the delaminating problem recall) on Monday.  Got it back from their Houston, TX repair facility this morning (round trip: about 88 hours).\n\n*Same serial number but the lid's been completely replaced (missing a scratch), which is fine.

It is however readable in macOS (10.14) and I am able to copy individual files from it.\nThe goal however is to copy the entire disk if possible to a readable image and then work with that image (repair partition table, recover remaining files) rather than with the failing disk that I am afraid can quit at any moment.\nHere is the command I've been using to image a 500GB Windows disk that came from a Dell computer and that has a number of bad blocks and apparently a corrupted partition table:\nsudo dd if=/dev/rdisk3 of=/Volumes/exFAT_Vol/rdiskX.dmg bs=4M conv=noerror,sync\n\nCopies fast (40MB/s via USB 2.0) but doesn't seem to create a correct (mountable) image: \"no mountable file systems\" when trying to mount it in Finder.\nSome sources (e.g. Recover a dead hard drive using dd from 2005) suggest using bs=512 and it's in progress now - yet copies at around 4MB/s which will take more than a day to complete - and I am not even sure it'll work.\nSome of the relevant info on the disk and its partitions:\nVolume type : Physical Device\nBSD device node : disk3\nConnection : USB\nDevice tree path : IODeviceTree:/PCI0@0/XHC1@14\nWritable : No\nIs case-sensitive : No\nVolume capacity : 500,107,862,016\nAvailable space (Purgeable + Free) : 0\nPurgeable space : 0\nFree space : 0\nUsed space : 500,107,862,016\nOwners enabled : No\nIs encrypted : No\nCan be verified : No\nCan be repaired : No\nBootable : No\nJournaled : No\nDisk number : 3\nMedia name : Generic External Media\nMedia type : Generic\nEjectable : Yes\nSolid state : No\nS.M.A.R.T. status : Not Supported\n\nVolume type : Physical Volume\nBSD device node : disk3s2\nMount point : /Volumes/Untitled\nFile system : Windows NT File System (NTFS)\nConnection : USB\nDevice tree path : IODeviceTree:/PCI0@0/XHC1@14\nWritable : No\nIs case-sensitive : No\nFile system UUID : AC8CB496-EAD2-47A2-BB36-2A981976BC2B\nVolume capacity : 500,064,122,880\nAvailable space (Purgeable + Free) : 373,903,597,568\nPurgeable space : 0\nFree space : 373,903,597,568\nUsed space : 126,160,525,312\nFile count : 176,730\nOwners enabled : No\nIs encrypted : No\nSystem Integrity Protection supported : No\nCan be verified : No\nCan be repaired : No\nBootable : No\nJournaled : No\nDisk number : 3\nPartition number : 2\nMedia name : \nMedia type : Generic\nEjectable : Yes\nSolid state : No\nS.M.A.R.T. status : Not Supported\nParent disks : disk3\n\n\nA: Based on what I've done so far and the comments I've read on \"Recover a dead hard drive using dd\":\n\n\n*\n\n*dd fails to image or clone damaged media to make the result equally mountable or readable, in multiple instances including mine;\n\n*there isn't an alternate tool in stock macOS that can do that.\n\n\nIn more detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*The command I've been using in the question is the \"proper\" way - yet in many instances of working with damaged media, it does not create an image that like the original one, can be mounted and read. Basically, it fails at its task.\n\n*There isn't an alternative within stock macOS (such as ASR) that can clone or image damaged yet readable media. ASR (or its GUI sibling, Disk Utility) will bail out once there is an I/O error such as bad blocks on the media.\n\n*Haven't tried other tools that aren't part of macOS (such as ddrescue or dd_rescue mentioned in the linked article) - my answer is only about tools that are part of stock macOS.\n\n\nThe answer is based on multiple comments in \"Recover a dead hard drive using dd\" that mirror my experience: dd completes yet the image can't be mounted. I.e. dd does not appear to have created a close enough image of the media.\nHere is what I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use sudo dd if=/dev/rdiskX of=/Volumes/exFAT_Vol/image.dmg bs=4M conv=noerror,sync and sudo dd if=/dev/rdiskXsY of=/Volumes/exFAT_Vol/image.dmg bs=4M conv=noerror,sync to image the media. Neither image can be mounted, with errors such as \"the following disks couldn't be opened: no mountable file systems\".\n\n*Use the resultant image to restore to a (healthy) physical media via sudo dd if=/Volumes/exFAT_Vol/image.dmg of=/dev/rdiskZ bs=4M conv=noerror,sync - with a similar result: the physical media can't be mounted, and unlike the original damaged one, doesn't display the partition information such as \"File system : Windows NT File System (NTFS)\".\n\n*Attempt to use \"First Aid\" in \"Disk Utility\" to repair the images or the clones. None worked, with error messages such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fixing damaged partition map. The operation couldn’t be completed. (com.apple.DiskManagement error -69874.) Operation failed….\n\n\n\nWhat I haven't yet tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use dd with a different bs= value such as 512, instead of 4m. Takes too long.\n\n*Use dd without the conv=sync option, i.e. just use conv=noerror one. (Just didn't have a chance to try it yet - each attempt takes 4-5 hours.)\n\n*use dd with conventional rather than raw devices - e.g. /dev/disk4 rather than /dev/rdisk4.\n\n*Cloning directly from the damaged media to a healthy physical one, bypassing the imaging stage.\n\n*Any other tools besides dd, Disk Utility, asr.\n\n\nHope this helps someone else in the same situation and really hope my answer is wrong: i.e. hope that there is a way to make dd work in this situation, to make mountable images off damaged yet readable / mountable media.\n", "Q: Unable to configure to native resolution on LCD of retina macbook pro I have late 2015 issue macbook Pro with 2880x1800 native resolution.

(Or at least know what the hell it is!!) Is it possible?\nRelated!  How do I correctly set strictly ONLY ONE desktop?\n\nA: Not seeing this behavior. I have several desktops enabled, yes macOS will happily slide to the next available if I drag a file/window to the extreme right of the screen, but it won't create NEW desktops. Once I hit #4 (the last desktop I have enabled) holding a file against the right side of the screen doesn't trigger any action. Perhaps you have more than 1 screen enabled in Mission Control? Remove them, it should not auto-create more. (added as answer per request!)\n\nA: Your problems are related to some settings and an habit. Lat's take them separately:\n1) Settings:\nTo have on and only one desktop, proceed as follows:\na) Open System Preferences and select Mission Control tab. Please see in the lower left corner the button labeled Hot Corners and click on it. You will get something similar to this picture below:\n\nFor hot corners configured as active, you will get some labels as seen for the upper right corner in my picture. \nClick on blue control marked with arrows, and a scrolling list will open, like in the picture below:\n\nNow select the minus sign (-), the last on that list and click OK button. You will have one and only one desktop if all hot corners are marked with minus sign.\n2) About habit\nSeems to me that when you drag to the right, you accidentally touch the + button which add a new desktop. See the picture below:\nSo, try to avoid the regions declared as \"hot corners\" when dragging. \nHowever, if you still need another desktop, add \"Mission Control\" for the right hot corner. Moving the mouse to the upper right you can add a new desktop. But moving a window to the right will not open a new desktop. \n\n\nA: In the Dock you can also assign your apps to \"All Desktops\".\n\nA: Refering to http://osxdaily.com/2010/02/10/change-the-delay-when-dragging-windows-within-spaces/ ,\ninstead of using a smaller delay, you could try to use a very large delay.\nI haven't tested it. Please report the result.\nPS: I tried that if there is only one Desktop, it won't 'slide to next'.\n\nA: It turns out for some reason I had\nabout 400 desktops\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/344432/19991\nIt seems that when you have more than \"a hundred\" or so the interface becomes so confusing, I didn't even know I had 2 desktops.\n\n*\n\n*This seems to entirely explain the problem, but\n\n\n*It remains a mystery why I had 400 desktops.\n\n\n*I still don't get how to completely turn off this desktops feature, but, that's life\nWhen you do have only 1x desktop, then as Dr.Nixon reports the problem I describe indeed does not happen.\nPhew\n", "Q: Why is Wine separately bundled with Winebottler for Mac OSX?

I know I can point Photos and iTunes to libraries on the external drive, but I'm more interested in transparently locating the entire home folder on the external drive. Thru trial and error, might have landed on a winner: setting the external drive's mount point to /Users/ . Is this a feasible approach? I couldn't find any stories of others attempting this, which could suggest that it's a terrible idea; or maybe it's just not a common solution. Laying out my process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Formatted external drive to match Mac mini SSD, with APFS and permissions enabled\n\n*Started by moving bulk documents from iMac to external drive, to reduce size of folders for migration\n\n*Created new Administrator account on Mac mini before migrating existing users\n\n*Migrated user accounts from iMac to Mac mini (internal SSD, no option to select other location in Migration Assistant)\n\n*First, just copied home folder to external drive and pointed user account to it; this resulted in major permissions errors and iCloud connection issues\n\n*Tried manually resetting home folder permissions via finder, via recovery mode, via diskutil ResetUserPermissions; seemed to resolve some but not all errors\n\n*Re-migrated and used finder's “exact copy” to maintain permissions; again, not a full fix\n\n*Ultimately, left migrated user folder in place on internal SSD; no issues with migrated user accounts when left in place\n\n*Re-migrated all users from iMac and left in place on internal SSD; delete failed migration home folders\n\n*Ensure external drive always auto-mounts at boot, test across logouts, reboots, cold boots and different users:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://superuser.com/questions/360276/automount-external-hard-drive-on-mac\n\n*How does Mac OS X decide which volumes to mount?

It's best to use the standard /Volumes mount and change the home directory as described in TJ Luoma's comment above. Also, I used Carbon Copy Cloner to copy my home directory and I didn't have any permissions issues.

The hotspot is working fine and other devices can connect to it and use the internet, but although the MacBook connects to the hotspot OK, browsers don't work. \nThe MacBook can ping the DNS server set by the phone's DHCP, and other servers, but lookup fails (dig, nslookup or the network utility tool), and all browsers report that there is no internet connection. \nI've tried going through the answers to this question but nothing seems to have made any difference.\nBoth devices have been restarted multiple times, and I've reset the phone's network settings.\n\nA: I got the same issue and solved it differently.\nIn my MacBook, I had the DNS server setup to point to Google's public DNS IP (8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4), I simply deleted those registers and left the default. It worked for me, hope it works for you.\n\nA: After hours of experimenting, and a long and pointless call to my network operator, I finally managed to fix it... by deleting the phone from the list of known wifi networks on the MacBook, and reconnecting. Same SSID, same password, now working fine.\nI recently switched SIM, moving to a new carrier. With the old carrier, the MacBook could use the phone's hotspot with no problem. I don't know what info gets stored for a wifi connection (I'd assumed just SSID and credentials) but presumably there's more to it...\n\nA: Hi Personally i fixed this problem by deactivating my second sim card on my phone.

I use a Pihole on my network to provide local DNS service to block ads and various websites. I've noticed recently (maybe since Mojave) that Safari seems to bypass this. The Pihole device also functions as my DHCP server, and is configured to broadcast to clients that they should use its IP as the DNS server.\n\n\n*\n\n*Running nslookup from the console indicates that the OS knows that the Pihole's IP is its DNS server.\n\n*Looking up known advertising domains via nslookup properly returns the Pihole's IP address (indicating that an ad coming from there would be blocked).\n\n*In the Network preferences pane, under DNS for the network interface, the Pihole's IP address is shown under DNS Servers.\n\n*Other web browsers (Chrome & Firefox) on the same MacBook Pro do not display the ads that Safari displays.\n\n*I have outbound port 53 blocked at my router for any device but the Pihole - switching nslookup's server to 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) results in a connection timeout (which I'd expect with the outbound port blocked).\n\n*No other device on my network exhibits this behavior - including iOS devices.\n\n\nnetworksetup -getdnsservers Wi-Fi reports \"There aren't any DNS Servers set on Wi-Fi.\" If I manually set it via networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 192.168.1.22 the situation gets better but Safari's behavior still doesn't match Chrome's. And that's not really a viable solution long-term as I'll have to unset it every time I leave my home network.\nDoes Safari have some other means of doing DNS lookups that's hidden? How could it be bypassing DNS settings?\n\nA: It sounds like you've done a pretty good job of covering all of your bases... as far as IPv4 is concerned. Maybe it's IPv6 that's causing you headaches? I believe that disabling IPv6 on the connection will fix the problem.  IIRC IPv6 can autoconfigure itself without DHCP.  If the rest of your network works with IPv6 then the queries could still be working over IPv6.\n\nA: You should try setting up a \"Location\" from System Preferences--> Network. \nThen, for that location, go to Advanced...DNS Servers for your network device (eth0, Wi-Fi, etc) and point it at your Pihole device.\nYou need to specify both an IPv4 and an IPv6 DNS server.\nFrom the same panel, if you click TCP/IP, you can confirm which DHCP information you're using and disable IPv6 (change it to link local only or manual with a bogus address).\n", "Q: How can I edit the /etc/ssh/ssh_config file?

Afterwards the drive worked just fine on both Mac and Windows for reading and writing.\nNote that it is important to \"safely eject\" the drive whenever you want to disconnect the drive from the Mac or PC. On the Mac, you'll need to press the small up-arrow besides the drive name in Finder (called unmounting). On the PC you'll need to look in the dock for the icon for safe ejecting hardware, select your drive and eject it.

Doing remote tech support over the phone is getting tedious.\nIs there anything available for iPad that's comparable to the Mac-to-Mac screen sharing options? Searching Google only turned up apps that let you administer a Mac from an iPad.\n\nA: I would probably recommend the Teamviewer app for iOS.\nFull instructions found here. \nIt is Free and you can download it from App Store\nFor your specific case read this\nHow to Get Started with Mobile to Mobile Connections!\nThat will allow you screen sharing but not Control since iOS does not allow remote control at this time. \nBut there is an exception.\nYou can connect to any iOS based devices with TeamViewer for Remote Control for iOS. This feature, however, is limited to connections to apps that have the TeamViewer Screen sharing SDK for iOS integrated.\nTherefore, only screen sharing is possible for connections from a mobile device to an iOS app.\nOn the Supported iOS App\nThis functionality is based on the implementation of the Screen sharing SDK by the app developer and meant for them to support their app on an iOS device.\nTherefore, it is only necessary to initiate a support request from within the supported app.\n", "Q: Applescript to change desktop background positioning (e.g., Fill to screen I have the script \ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell every desktop\n        set picture to \"/Users/jackson/Pictures/Backgrounds/backpic.jpg\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThat changes my desktop background to a specific image.

It's singular command is a call to the handler scaleDesktopImage, which is the line you'll be most wanting to play with to suit your needs.\nIt takes two forms, which I'll illustrate by example:\nscaleDesktopImage to fill over blue\n\nor:\nscaleDesktopImage to fill\n\nIn other words, specifying the colour over which the desktop image is laid (i.e. the background colour), is optional.  If omitted, the background colour defaults to 50% grey.  Of course, you needn't use a pre-declared property to specify the background colour; you can supply directly a list of RGB values:\nscaleDesktopImage to best over {100, 25, 50}\n\nThe remaining parameter is mandatory, and there are four possible named values:\n\n\n*\n\n*fit: Stretches the image to fit the desktop's width and height;\n\n*centre: Centres the image without enlarging, however it will reduce the size of an image that would otherwise spill outside the boundary of the desktop;\n\n*best: Enlarges or reduces the size of the image to occupy the maximum possible area of the desktop without going outside the desktop boundary and preserving the aspect ratio of the image, i.e. a proportional size adjustment;\n\n*fill: Sizes the image to cover the full area of the desktop, preserving the aspect ratio, but extending beyond the boundary of the desktop along one of its axes if necessary in order to cover the background.\n\n", "Q: macOS shows missed call notification when answering from iPhone When someone calls me, both my iPhone and MacBook ring.\nI always end up answering from my iPhone because people can't hear me when using the Mac.\nThe problem is, when I get back to the Mac, it shows a missed call notification for that call in Notification Center, from the FaceTime app:\n\n\nMissed call - from your iPhone\n\nThat's not what I expect to happen.

I have a DBAN CD )used with an external optical drive) which I have used in the past on multiple old Macs. I tried to use it on a 2018 Macbook Pro and DBAN could not be booted. Specifically, I tried holding down the \"c\" key and I could hear the CD spin a lot but then the normal OS booted. I tried booting while holding down \"Option\" but DBAN wasn't in the list of bootable options. I tried booting into Recovery and selecting the DBAN CD as the startup disk but I can't choose it (I see the DBAN CD but when I choose it I receive a message that the startup disk can't be used because \"the bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk\"). Again, if I open Terminal in Recovery Mode and try to bless the CD then it fails.\nI wanted to know if this was a problem unique to one Mac so I tested the same CD in an old Macbook Pro (I think 2014 or 2015) and a different 2018 Macbook Pro. The CD is bootable normally in the old one and not in that second new one I tested.\nDid Apple make a firmware change in newer systems that could have this effect? \n\nA: T2 chip in newer Macs needs to recognize the boot media to allow it to start from that disk. You might be able to tell the system to use the drive as a startup volume if you can log in first with sufficient privileges (Preferences --> Startup Disk). Workaround? Boot to recovery partition, open Disk Utility, and do a secure wipe of the drive, using highest stringency options. Accomplishes the same thing (7 pass U.S. Department of Defense 5220-22-M compliant wipe) without the need to run DBAN. Also leaves the machine in a recoverable state so that the next user can install from the recovery partition, which is far faster than Internet Recovery (and in some cases, DBAN wipes the recovery partition, which makes reinstalling incredibly painful depending on the machine - I spent several days repairing an old Air after our IT folks used a DBAN equivalent to wipe it - even worse, this happened AFTER I had already run a full wipe from disk utility - the DBAN wipe wasn't even needed at that point!)\n\nA: It should be possible to boot the Mac with the same disk as used previously. However, on the 2018 MacBook Pro you'll need to first disable Secure Boot using the Startup Security Utility. You'll need to set Secure Boot to \"No Security\".\nPlease note that the internal SSD will not be available to DBAN to use. You'll only be able to wipe external drives.\nThis is really not a problem in this specific use case. The other answers to your question here that recommends that you use for example Disk Utility to do a 7 pass wipe - they are actually incorrect. In the modern day of SSDs (which all T2 equipped Macs have), you will actually not be sufficiently protected by simply doing a 7 pass wipe. This is due to the nature of SSDs.\nIn order to really secure wipe the drive, you'll also need to let the T2 chip \"forget\" the encryption keys for the drive, and set new keys. You can manage encryption keys from the File Vault part of System Preferences.\n\nA: You can get a bless tool from here, which happens to be made by the same person who makes macOS cracks. Try blessing the cd with that tool, it should work (I think)\n", "Q: Have the MacBooks Pro in 2011 and 2012 still shipped with installation disks? I'm looking into acquiring some older Apple hardware and am wondering how long Apple still shipped hardware with installation disks. So when did Apple stop shipping installation disks (or more specifically: did the 2011 and 2012 MacBookPros still ship with disks)?\n\nA: Mac OS X 10.7 Lion was released to manufacturing on July 1, 2011 and was the first Mac OS that was not made available on optical media. I believe that the last MBP to ship with optical media were the Early 2011 models which were introduced in February 2011 shipping with Mac OS X 10.6.6 meaning that the Late 2011 MBP introduced October 2011 and shipping with Mac OS X 10.7.2 would have been the first to ship without optical media.\n", "Q: Irreversible way to block Internet access on Mac for certain periods of time I am looking for a way to restrict Internet access for specified periods of time that I decide on so that I, the admin, cannot access the internet during the restricted time period, and that I also cannot override this in any way even though I am the admin, except by formatting my hard disk and reinstalling my OS.\nI am not looking for reversible methods like a browser add-on or parental controls (I'm the admin) or router changes (I do not own the router). I want something at the level of the OS, something that requires administrator privileges (of course something like this cannot be done other than by an admin), and something irreversible.\nI would be grateful and very happy to adopt any way of reaching my goal.\n\nA: No, there’s no irreversible way. At the extreme, an admin could always just reinstall macOS from scratch, or change the system clock so that the blackout period expires early. You’d need a firmware option to disable the network hardware for a specific period of time, and an unchangeable firmware clock, and such things do not exist. \n\nA: First, let's clear up a misconception....\n\nI am looking for a way to restrict ... that I decide on so that I, the\nadmin, cannot access ... and that I also cannot override this in any\nway even though I am the admin...that requires administrator\nprivileges (of course something like this cannot be done other than by\nan admin), and something irreversible.\n\nIn other words, can you (as an admin) modify the OS to prevent an activity that another admin cannot circumvent?\nNo.  Anything one admin can do, another can undo.\nThat's not to say that you can't make it very difficult to do the \"undoing.\"  So, here's a short recipe using the built-in firewall, pf to achieve a relatively good bit of what you're trying to accomplish.\nUse pf to \"disable\" your Internet\n\n*\n\n*create your own pf.conf firewall ruleset that blocks all Internet traffic\n\n*Create a launchd plist that enables/disables pf at certain times of the day.\n\n*Block your sudo access to pfctl by modifying your sudoers file.\n\nThe meat and potatoes to blocking your Internet access is pf so, we'll look at that here.\nBlock Internet Access\nYou can block all of your Internet access with a really simple rule set.  So, assuming the pf rule are set in the file ~/pf/pf_block_all.conf, just set the following two lines:\nblock in all\nblock out all\n\nYou can then \"break\" your Internet with the simple command by enabling pf and specifying the custom rule set.\n$ sudo pfctl -e -f ~/pf/pf_block_all.conf\n\nWhen you're ready to have Internet again, just disable pf\n$ sudo pfctl -d\n\n(Go ahead, try this out to see how it blocks the Internet).\nRunning the launchd plist\nYou would want to run this as a LaunchDaemon because then, it will execute as root and you wouldn't need the sudo function to execute.  You would need two plists run at certain intervals; one to enable and another to disable pf.  This post goes into detail on how to achieve this.\nBlocking access to pfctl\nTo remove the ability of you just typing in sudo pfctl .... you will need to remove (well, at least make it difficult) permission to execute.  In the /etc/sudoers file you can exclude a program with the following entry:\nTim ALL = ALL, !/sbin/pfctl\n\nThat will prevent you from executing pfctl, but there are workarounds to this.

Basically this volume needs to be setup to appear as a legacy OS X boot volume.\n\nNote: Normally the Ubuntu volume would not appear in the Finder. In other words. the /etc/fstab file was edited so the Ubuntu volume would not auto-mount. I used the diskutil command to manually mount the volume. Also, the Finder windows does not normally show the hidden files.\n\n\nSome installations actually store the operating system boot files in volume. In this example, I instead chose to install rEFInd to silently boot Ubuntu. In other words, I added the following lines to the bottom of the default refind.conf file.\n#\n# Added to make rEFInd silent. \n#\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu\" {\n    icon \\System\\Library\\CoreServices\\icons\\os_ubuntu.png\n    volume \"EFI\"\n    loader \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n    ostype Linux\n    graphics on\n}\ntimeout -1\nhideui all\nscanfor manual\n\nThe actually Ubuntu boot files are stored in the hidden EFI partition, as shown in the image below.\n\nNote: The hidden EFI partition does not normally appear in the Finder and the Finder does not normally show hidden files.\n\n\n\nNote: There is no /EFI/BOOT folder containing an Bootx64.efi file. This was done so a default icon labeled EFI Boot would not appear in the Startup Menu.\n\nWhat I do not understand is why you want to know how to do this with respect to Windows? Normally, the Startup Manager automatically inserts a Windows label for a properly installed Windows. There should be no need to apply the above procedure.\n", "Q: Applescript : count Length I created a code which count the length of a variable and take action regarding the length.\nIt's work well except when I have a variable in this format :\n\n\"00108030-00045C9E2638502E\"\n\n1: the count is returning 8 and not 25\n2: I have the error :\n\n\"Can’t make 8 into type boolean.\" number -1700 from 8 to boolean\"\n\nHere is a preview of my code :\n\"\nset theGUIDLength to (get length of (GUID as text))\nif theGUIDLength is equal to 25 or 8 then\n--\nend if\n\n\"\n\nA: I believe what you're looking for is:\nif theGUIDLength = 25 or theGUIDLength = 8 then\n## do code\nend if\n\n\nA: Perhaps a cleaner way to do this:\nif theGUIDLength is in {25, 8} then\n## do code\nend if\n\n", "Q: How to map the 'Mission Control' key to F3 via Karabiner? \nI am using an external mechanical keyboard. I find that whenever I hit the F3 key, it is mapped to mission_control. \nIs it possible to remap mission_control to something else? In the karabiner Element I cannot find any option of mission_control \n\n\nA: Although the proposed solution works, there are better alternatives IMO. To remap mission_control to right_command for example, you can also:\n\n*\n\n*Add a rule to Karabiner-Elements such as:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"basic\",\n  \"from\": {\n    \"key_code\": \"mission_control\",\n    \"modifiers\": {\n      \"optional\": [\n        \"any\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"to\": [\n    {\n      \"key_code\": \"right_command\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nor\n\n*\n\n*Go to System preferences -> Mission Control -> Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts -> Mission Control and select Right Command\n\nA: I think what you need is currently available in the Function Keys section of the Karabiner settings! Here you can remap all the keys to anything you want. In my case I just wanted f3 and f4 to be vanilla function keys so I can map them in specific apps/system prefs, and it works!\nPerfect way to keep all the other f keys intact while reclaiming 3 and 4 for customization.\n\n", "Q: Using Console utility to get the full logs with admin perms but as a non admin user I maintain at least 2 logins:\nnormal  is non admin permissions\nadmin - to do those sometimes tasks but increase my security.\n[10.11.6 EL Cap, not new logger system.

However, I connect to a remote Linux server where the names have hundreds of characters. The Finder cannot handle it and shortens the names into something unintelligible. Is it possible to make Finder display the original long names?\n\nA: If it's actually the filename that is too long you need to increase the column width for the filename. Shown below is a finder window, in list view, that is too narrow to show the filenames.\nBy moving your cursor slowly over the line indicated, your cursor will change and you can click on the line and move it to the right to expand column views. \nThe image below shows the window after expanding the column.  Notice that some file names are quite long. \nTo my knowledge, Mac has no limit on the length of file name.

Then I tried another 300 MB app, with no warnings whatsoever, and the download completed successfully. Final I tried a 1.2 GB download which failed with the popup warning message.\nI understand that App Slicing has appeared since iOS 9. The actual download size is different from the indicated size. But after downloading, I checked in Setting app → General → → iPhone Storage, and the two apps are over 150 MB(198 MB and 211 MB). And they are new download not updates.\nIs the size displayed incorrectly or has the upper cap for downloading new apps over Cellular data changed?\nPS:I downloaded that two app before but uninstalled it.\nAnother assumption is that the downloaded content is actually less than 150 MB but there is a process of decompression?\n\nA: No. The upper cap for downloading new apps over mobile data connection is unchanged from Apple. It's still at 150 MB. There is no official word from Apple after last revising the upper cap to 150 MB. This is the warning that I get (Indian App Store, accessing over 3G data connection in India) when attempting to download an app of size 2 GB.\n\nHowever, the related Apple support document, If you can’t download or update apps, or if apps get stuck mentions the following in fine print.\n\nConnect to Wi-Fi\nIf you’re using cellular data or Wi-Fi and have issues with an app, try to connect to another Wi-Fi network.

I am able to sign other apps and distribute them using the codesign tool but as soon as I try to sign the app with entitlements I run into issues.\nSending the app to other people results in it exiting with a Killed 9 or a SIGTERM which I assume is indicating that there is something going wrong in the signing.\nThis is the error I am getting when selecting the provisioning profile that I created in the developer portal\n\nIn Xcode I have it enabled though\n\nAnd it is also enabled in the developer portal \n\nEven with that I am getting this issue when attempting to sign it with that provisioning profile\n\nSo I am very confused. I am using the correct bundle ID, I have set everything up correctly as far as I can tell and I am still unable to sign and distribute this application. I am sure that there is something simple that I am missing here but I have no idea what that might be.\n\nA: For anyone wanting to use Network Extensions in their macOS app:\nDeveloper ID provisioning profiles actually don't support the Network Extensions entitlement. Development and App Store provisioning profiles on the other hand do support it. It's not well described in Xcode or the developer site (which show it as enabled).

The basic steps:\n\n*\n\n*Make a slide\n\n*Duplicate it\n\n*Set the Transition of the First slide to \"Magic Move\"\n\n*Transform the objects on the second slide.\n\nWhen you play it, objects will perform their various transformation when you click to go to the new slide.\nNote that it seems the magic move effects stack with the animations, you may be surprised if you have animations which do similar things to what happens in your Magic Move.\nPlease refer to the builtin Help for details.\n", "Q: How to quickly stitch a ton of albums back together into compilations? I trusted Google Music Manager to download my music collection onto a new computer, importing the lot into iTunes.

So Mr. Robot OST is about twenty different \"albums\", and it's become a pain to try to play a whole album in iTunes. How can I fix my songs?\nI read some blurbs online about manually fixing an album, by checking the compilation box for each individual song.

You CAN select multiple files at once and change them in one click; if I recall correctly iTunes may prompt you to confirm that you really want to mass-edit files it thinks should not be treated as a single album.\nBe careful you don't overwrite anything except the field you intend to change, as you can easily accidentally rename or assign the same artist for all of them at once.

If you don't see the Apple symbol or it reverts to the blank screen with vertical lines on it, then the next step would be to complete a recovery mode restore.  \nRecovery mode restore involves connecting the device to a computer with the latest version of iTunes on it and completing the same restart with the device connected via USB and iTunes open.  The steps can be found here:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263\nIf the issue continues after restoring the device to factory settings then you would want to look into hardware service for the device.\n", "Q: Connect to a remote windows command line from mac terminal? When I need to run a command on a remote windows machine, I use Microsoft Remote Desktop software. I was wondering if there is a way to connect to a remote windows command line (cmd.exe) directly from macOS terminal?\n\nA: An extremely popular option of connecting to remote computers' command lines is the SSH system (secure shell).\nIn order to use SSH, you'll need a server and a client. \nWindows 10 comes with OpenSSH Server as an optional install from Microsoft. You can also use third party servers such as for example the Moba SSH server. You'll need to install and run the server taking care that firewalls, etc. are not blocking anything.\nmacOS comes with the client (and server) built-in. You'll want to open Terminal.app and run the following command:\nssh -l<username> <IP>\n\nwhere  should be replaced with your Windows user name, and  with the hostname or IP-address of your Windows PC.\n", "Q: What are dos and don'ts when charging an iPhone / Apple device? Can I charge the phone all day long? I usually charge my phone all day and night long. All day long, because at work I connect my phone with my laptop, and all night long because when I go sleep, the phone will be charged overnight too.\nBut I got worried this may reduce battery life. So I went searching online, and the best article I can come up for best practice for charging Apple device is this. In the article, it just says that the device is smart, and can automatically stop the charge once it's almost full, to prevent overcharging. Does that mean it's actually completely okay for me to charge the phone all day long? I still can't find any article that can give me the straight answer to this question.\n\nA: This questions risks inviting a lot of opinion, which also explains why it seems you can't find an article that can gives you a straight answer.\nHowever, to try and keep this to the facts, I refer you firstly to what Apple has to say about their batteries. You should also read this.\nIn a nutshell, the key indisputable points are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Charge your iPhone whenever you want. Many people believe you need to let them discharge 100% before recharging. This is not true.\n\n*Apple lithium-ion batteries use fast charging to reach 80% of their capacity and then switch to slower trickle charging to complete the charge.\n\n*Ambient temperature is one of the biggest factors in battery health/life. iPhones are designed to work at their best when ambient temperatures are between 0° to 35° C (32° to 95° F).\n\n*Store your iPhone where the temperature is between -20º and 45º C (-4º to 113º F). Don’t leave it in your car, because temperatures in parked cars can exceed 45º C (113º F).\n\n\nAlso, the latest research confirms one of the most important determinants of what ruins a battery is time. (You could purchase a brand new iPhone battery and leave it unused in its original packaging for five years and then find its capacity is nowhere near what it should be when you start using it) \nBasically, you can continue to do as you have been without fear of causing damage to your iPhone battery.\n\nA: The battery life is mostly impacted by deep (Complete) discharging. \nThat is why the Cycle count is monitored as indicator of battery life.\nYou probably noticed that battery gets hot when been completely discharged. That is because the internal current is increasing to maintain the Voltage. That leads to edit currents and growth of Whisker. Whisker are build up between the positive and negative poles. Those whisker eventually lead to end of life of the battery.\nThe second factor limiting life is the ambient temperature. High temperature is not good.\nIf you do not let the battery discharge all the way is the best practice.\nIt is a \"Smart\" battery (it has a circuit build in) and it will newer overcharge.\nIf you like to learn more visit Battery University.\n\nA: You better not charge it all day. Keeping it at high voltage increases stress for the battery.\n\nLithium-ion suffers from stress when exposed to heat, so does keeping a cell at a high charge voltage. A battery dwelling above 30°C (86°F) is considered elevated temperature and for most Li-ion a voltage above 4.10V/cell is deemed as high voltage. Exposing the battery to high temperature and dwelling in a full state-of-charge for an extended time can be more stressful than cycling. Table 3 demonstrates capacity loss as a function of temperature and SoC. \n  https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries\n\nThe mentioned table notes that at room temperature a battery at 100% charge loses 20% capacity after a year, while a battery kept at 40% loses only 4%. This is why new batteries will always have a 40-50% charge. \nI know that this 40% rule is only mentioned in instructions when storing a battery long term, but it is also valid for batteries in use. This is why Dell has something like Desktop Mode (When desktop mode is enabled, the battery charges between 50 percent and 100 percent while the power adapter is connected.) and Asus has Maximum Lifespan Mode (If your ZenBook operates almost exclusively on your desktop and is nearly always plugged in, the most conservative power profile limits the maximum charge to 60% and starts charging at 58%. This will ensure your battery has the longest possible lifecycle while still keeping a sufficient charge for light usage while unplugged.)\nIt could be that Apple caps the charge at 80% capacity, but I can't find any reference to that. On the Apple battery page they also recommend storing at 40%.\n", "Q: Everything is noticably slow, restored to new 1tb ssd Everything on my computer is noticeably slow. Before I thought that my hdd was dying (which it may have been) and (regrettably) bought a 1tb ssd to restore all of my data to. Before, my computer was so slow that I couldn't back it up, with no other apps open. Now, on the ssd (after re-installing macOS Sierra from the recovery partition), my computer is noticeably slow. It can't even run Grand Theft Auto on low settings, which it should be able to do with ease.\nBefore I re-installed Sierra, my computer (running on the ssd) began to gradually slow down, until all of the apps stopped responding, and disk utility said that there were problems with the ssd.\n From there, I rebooted into the recovery partition, ran first aid on all volumes (which said that there was no problems), and re-installed Sierra.\nIs there any way to make my computer running from an ssd fast, like it was for a while when running on an hdd, or even faster?\nThis is a '15 mid-2012 MacBook Pro (the model with a superdrive), with the ssd running from an adapter in the superdrive's place (the hdd flex cord died).\n\nA: Mac computers will cut down the CPU power down to 50% if the battery is not supporting it.\nIn your case  been without working battery, is the reason for slow down.\nPS, you do not need iStat to see CPU usage.

I was wondering, have anyone thought of connecting apple pencil (1st or 2nd) generation to the surface line in windows 10? \nIf so, how was it done? any ideas?\n\nA: There's no official support for connecting the Apple Pencil (1st or 2nd gen) with the Microsoft Surface line.\nIn addition, there's currently no unofficial projects either.\nThis means that your only option for connecting the two is to develop your own driver. This will require very significant amounts of skill and knowledge as an engineer. You'll need to reverse engineer the software protocols needed, and you'll most probably need to develop extra hardware in order to make the two compatible.\nIn short: In practice, this is not possible. It requires so significant investments in time and resources that you could just as well buy a compatible pen or a different tablet.\n", "Q: Automator: Is it possible to resize an image to a maximum file size? I have been looking around for an Automator method, whereby an image file is to be resized (reduced height and width) to a specific file size (in bytes), or a near lower-bound proximity of that file size.\nIt would be a great use for MacOS Mojave's Quick Actions, as many website uploads do not accept full-size iPhone images, for instance.\nMy intuition is that this is a quite difficult problem for Automator to solve even with the help of bash scripting, etc. Usually, even applications like Adobe Photoshop are not great at predicting the final file size after a file is compressed to JPG or PNG, etc. Perhaps it could incrementally lower the image dimensions until it's lower than the max file size. Easiest would be if was a scriptable utility for this.\nI therefore thought to ask if: \n\n\n*\n\n*a) Is this doable, and\n\n*b) How would it be done?\n\n\nA: I'm a little confused with the approach on how to properly compress the images you want to work with. As mentioned, there is sips, a working example based on pulling a directory of images and stepping through the list with a resize if the width isn't 800px:\nproperty theWidth : 800\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    try\n        ## Choose directory\n        set imageDir to choose folder with prompt \"Please select directory.\"\n\n        ## Get list of items in diretory\n        set the imageList to list folder imageDir without invisibles\n\n        ## Step through images\n        repeat with theImage in imageList\n\n            ## Turn path to posix path\n            set imagePos to quoted form of POSIX path of ((imageDir as text) & contents of theImage)\n\n            ## Get image width\n            set imgWidth to (do shell script \"sips -g pixelWidth \" & \" \" & imagePos & \" \" & \"| tail -n1 | cut -d' ' -f4\") as integer\n\n            ## if not equal to set variable width resize\n            if imgWidth ≠ theWidth then do shell script \"sips --resampleWidth \" & theWidth & \" \" & imagePos\n\n        end repeat\n    on error error_message\n        display dialog error_message\n    end try\n\nThat is just an example of what you can do with the width. As mentioned in the comment you could check to see which is longer the width or height and resize from there. If you do man sips in the Terminal you can pull all types of info. The above code uses tail and cut to trim the return. Resizing is done with --resampleWidth. You could resample based on height with --resampleHeight. \nRegarding the compression aspect, if these are PNGs you can use Optipng. If you want something you can run with PNGs and JPGs you could use Trimage. AppleScript/Automater could also be scripted into using a compression utility. You would just need to call from bin a check if a compression exists:\ntry\n    set checkBin to \"(ls usr/local/bin/optipng >> /dev/null 2>&1 && echo yes) || echo no\"\n    return do shell script checkBin\non error error_message\n    return error_message\nend try\n\nThe above is checking for OptiPNG. If you wanted to check wether something was installed with HomeBrew you could use a similar command on /usr/local/Cellar.\nAll the above mentioned could be completely done in a Shell Script. It just depends on what you want and how you want to execute the code.\n\nA: Yes, with a shell script\nYou could write a shell script to do what you want and wrap that within an Automator workflow.\nIn Automator only, this is not possible. Automator lacks the branching logic required to determine when to stop.\nI am not aware of any shortcuts, other than to resize and compress differing size images until they meet your goal.\nThis can be done with built-in tools included with macOS, such as sips for resizing the image and bash for the scripting the logic.\nSee Reduce image file size to certain size for a closely related question.\n", "Q: How can I empty the trash with old backups in it? Since my backup disk is full, I wanted to delete old backups to free space. Since I didn't figure out how to do it on TimeMachine itself properly, I selected all the folders with backups on the TimeMachine disk and put them in the trash.\nNow, however, I can't empty the trash/ delete those items. Whenever I try, it shows that \"Library is in Use\", even when I close all tabs and applications.\nHow can I empty the trash and really delete those old backups so the space on my backup disk is free?\n\nA: Okay, before I get into more detail, let me quickly tell you this:\nYou should not delete TimeMachine backups yourself like this!\nThe filesystem on a HD formatted for TimeMachine works differently from what you're normally used to. Without going into too much detail, the main difference is that it uses hard links. That means that files that look like they're a simple copy, are actually just links, pretty much like an Alias that you can create in the Finder. That's how you can see each backup folder as a full mirror of your system (or all files that are backed up) without really having x copies of them (where x is the number of backups taken). This saves disk space (by a lot).\nInstead, you should simply let TimeMachine sort this out on its own. Once it runs out of disk space, it automatically starts removing older backups.\nBtw, for the same reason you probably don't want to store anything else on the TimeMachine partition. It's simply not a \"normal\" disk, from the perspective of the average user.\nTo actually answer: There are several ways to force delete from/clear the trash bin. The first one I'd try is to open it, right-click the problematic file(s) and chose \"Delete immediately...\" Other methods usually involve Terminal and require some shell knowledge. A quick google search revealed this, which also covers your system version it seems. In short: running \nsudo rm -rf /Volumes/YOURTMDRIVE/.Trashes/*\nin Terminal should work, but again, I think you shouldn't go down that path anyways. (YOURTMDRIVE would be the name of your TimeMachine volume, watch out for spaces, those must be escaped with a preceding \\)\n(That being said I don't think you're running risk of ruining anything fatally, but TimeMachine will now probably take a while to fix the backups when it runs the next time).\nLast note: You can read up a bit about how TimeMachine works here\n", "Q: Stop mouse pointer from sticking to the edge of display in dual monitor setup I am using macOS Mojave on a MacBook Pro.\nI don't know if it's just me, but I feel like the mouse pointer, from time to time, seems to stick to the edge of the monitor when I try to move it from secondary monitor to the primary monitor (the secondary monitor is to the right, primary (laptop built in monitor) to the left).\nIf I try to make it happen on purpose it never happens, which makes me feel like I was mistaken in the beginning, but after playing around for a while I feel like it definitely is happening, but only sometimes and I'm not sure why.\nDoes this annoying snap-to-monitor-edge feature have a name, and more importantly how do I disable it?\n\nA: I have just accidentally also come across the problem of snap-to-monitor-edge. And the root cause was not related to any macOS feature but to the fact that when I was arranging my displays in System Preferences > Displays I have set it up with a very tiny gap between the screens.\nAt this time I have not even realised the slit. But the problem of the mouse pointer sticking to the edge was so annoying to me that after digging a while I realised that dropping this gap away equaled in the ability to change the display areas smoothly (without waiting at the edge).\n\nA: There is no snap-to-monitor-edge feature or anything similar built-in into macOS Mojave (or any earlier release of macOS). You are using an external monitor with extended display mode. As described, your setup is something like this:\n\nThe display on the left is your built-in display, while the one on your right is the external, extended display.\nNow, notice the horizontal alignment of the displays. When moving the mouse from external to built-in display, if you are moving the mouse along the bottom edge, the pointer will have no path to move into the built-in display shown on left, as it hits the edge of the external display.\n\nIf you move the mouse pointer vertically to appropriate height, the mouse pointer will find a way to move into built-in display as soon as it reaches the corner of the built-in display. You can try this by dragging the mouse pointer along the edge of external display vertically, while attempting to move the mouse pointer towards left.\nIf you find this behaviour interfering with your workflow, you can easily adjust the relative placement of the displays by dragging them. There are a number of variations you can try as long as the two rectangles are not totally isolated (as separate islands). Even an alignment where just the angles of the two displays is touching is possible too :)\nRefer to the Apple Support document, Use external monitors with your Mac for more details.\n\nA: This is actually the main cause of a sticking mouse at the edge with external monitors, because most people who setup external monitors know to align the edges as they see fit. however this situation (Pic) is more elusive due to the fact you can transition through the boundary above the mac but it is just sticky.\nthis can only really occur with 2 external monitors in the cornered configuration similar to the picture.\nThe answer is to move the mac position around until the grey bar or screen corner is no longer rounded.\nThis picture depicts a bad situation\n\nThis picture show the setup for a smooth transition between monitors:\n\n", "Q: Dual external monitors: Blink on wake I have two HP 24es monitors connected to my MacBook Pro. The input to the monitors are via HDMI. One connects directly to the MacBook Pro via a HDMI cable. The other connects via a HDMI to DVI, DVI to DVI, DVI to DisplayPort, DisplayPort to Henge Docks to MacBook Pro.\nNow in general the monitors work fine. The problem is after I've locked the laptop and the monitors have gone to sleep when I come back and the monitors wake up, they blink three times before settling down.\nI am hoping to avoid this. I previously had different external monitors hooked up via DVI and those didn't have this issue.\nMy guess is that the HDMI talk through is more involved and is causing the blinking.\nAny suggestions on how to avoid this? Different cables? Would I loose quality if I used the VGA port on the back of the monitors instead of HDMI?\n\nA: I finally decided to give HP Support a call to see if they had a solution.  After an ungodly wait on an antiquated support call system with reminders every minute that all their agents were busy and with no indication of an expected wait time I managed to get through to them.\nThey recommended unplugging one of the two monitors to see if the problem would still occur.  It didn't.  Swapping it and trying the other monitor as the primary also didn't show the blinking.  Connecting them both back up to the macbook pro also then didn't show the problem !\nSeems like the issue only happens when the monitor activates sleep mode.  I didn't realize that I had to wait for not only the screen to blank out but the monitor to say it is going to sleep.  The issue still occurs.  The HP monitor has a power control option and an auto-sleep mode.  Setting the auto-sleep mode to off prevents the problem from occurring.  I likely didn't have this issue with the old monitors as they didn't have a power saving sleep mode.  Unfortunately there is no auto-sleep mode delay.  My typical use case is locking the computer and going to grab a coffee which is typically a one minute away period but is quick enough for the monitors to auto sleep.  The blinking is annoying enough that I'll just keep the monitors setup with auto sleep set to off.  Ideally I'd be able to power save and have them auto sleep unfortunately it is just too annoying.\nDo other people have auto sleeping monitors that when waking take 3 blinks and around 10 seconds for the monitors to settle back down?  \nBe interested to know if 2 external monitors on a macbook pro that have auto sleep will always have this issue, if the issue is HDMI related, or HP monitor limited.  I'll play around with this some more and see if having it only using a single monitor changes things, maybe try out the old vga cable (these monitors are at 1920x1080 so maybe I wouldn't see any difference not sure on the analog vs digital signal difference with the different cables).  \n", "Q: Keyboard preferences are lost after each restart I had this strange behaviour on my Mac running OS X my Mac running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.\nWhen logging in, I have the following keyboard shortcut conflict between Spotlight and keyboard layout switcher:\n\nAfter disabling it, conflict disappears:\n\nBut if I restart my Mac, the configuration was reset back to first step.\nSame problem if I changed the keyboard shortcut: It was reset to default configuration after any restart, whatever the shortcut.\nWhat is happening and why OS X isn't able to keep my keyboard preferences?\n\nA: I indicate here two solutions because the problem may be caused by either :\n\n*\n\n*ownership\n\n*plist file\n\nOwnership problem\nTo troubleshoot my problem, I opened a Terminal and tried to find which configuration file had a problem:\ncd Library/Preferences\nls -l com.apple.*\n\nAnd in the middle of all my com.apple.* files I found one owned by root:\n-rw-------   1 myuser  staff      485 19 jan  2018 com.apple.speech.voice.prefs.plist\n-rw-------   1 myuser  staff      107 22 jan  2018 com.apple.suggestions.plist\n-rw-------   1 root    wheel     2644 11 apr  2018 com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n-rw-------   1 myuser  staff      110 12 oct 10:00 com.apple.syncserver.plist\n-rw-------   1 myuser  staff     1862 26 nov 14:04 com.apple.systempreferences.plist\n\nSo I thought is was not normal.

I have a Windows PC, and will get a new blank internal SATA drive to put into the MacBook Pro. I also have a 1TB external USB drive, if that helps.\nHow do I purchase and install the latest compatible OS on this new-old MacBook?\n\nA: \nHow do I purchase and install the latest compatible OS on this new-old MacBook?\n\nThe recent versions of macOS are available for free of cost to install and download from Apple (starting with OS X Mavericks 10.9).\nThe easiest way to install macOS onto a blank hard disk in your MacBook Pro would be via Internet recovery.\nRefer to the Apple Support article, About macOS Recovery to get instructions on how to install macOS over the Internet.\nThe availability of Internet recovery and the latest supported OS will depend on the make and model of your MacBook Pro.\n\nA: If your mac is 3 years old, then it likely has special storage on the machine containing the last version of the operating system that it used. It exists specifically for instances where you need to reinstall the OS, and it cannot be wiped. It replaces the old method where you had to have a CD or some other copy present. (I'm pretty sure it is stored independently of the HD, but I could be wrong.)\nTo reinstall the OS from the special storage inside your machine, boot to Recovery Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the mac\n\n*While it is booting up, hold Command+R until the Apple logo shows up\n\n*You will see a loading bar under the Apple logo\n\n*Once the screen loads, you will see a window with four options\n\n*Click the second one down – \"Reinstall macOS\"\n\n*That will wipe the hard drive (whatever may exist on yours), installing a fresh version of whatever the latest OS was.\n\n\nIf that fails, you can install the OS from over the internet:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the mac\n\n*While it is booting up, hold Command+SHIFT+R until the Apple logo shows up\n\n*You will see a spinning globe for a while\n\n*Once the screen loads, you will see a window with four options\n\n*Click the second one down – \"Reinstall macOS\"\n\n*That will wipe the hard drive (whatever may exist on yours), installing whatever version of macOS your computer shipped with from the factory (it will be a 3 year old version) You need internet access for this to work.\n\n\nFinal Step:\nOnce any OS is installed, you can open the app store, and search for \"Mojave OS\" to download what is currently the latest macOS.\nLike I said I don't think any of that requires a HD but please ignore me if I'm wrong.

YouTube starts spinning, any open sites just stop reacting, everything is offline even though Wi-Fi is still connected. \nTo fix it, I \"turn off Wi-Fi\" and turn it on again. And I repeat this 50 times per day.\n\nI'm not even sure if this is a problem with the MacBook.\nI currently have a 2017 MBP 13\", basic model.

(How to avoid the error from gatekeeper without using xattr -c)\n\nA: You cannot modify the DMG and have it still pass trough GateKeeper without re-signing it. This is basically the entire reason for having the code signature!\nBasically you have three options:\n1) Remove the old code signature and re-sign the DMG with your own signature. This requires you to be enrolled in Apple's Developer Program.\n2) Distribute the original, unmodified DMG - and accompany it with your own modifications. This could be done as instructions for the user on what to copy over, or it could be in the form of an automatic script.\n3) Remove the signatures completely (both from the DMG and the app). The user then needs to have GateKeeper set to allow opening unsigned applications (i.e. the user will be prompted on the first open).\n\nA: Apple DMG Code Signing :\nSigning apple application require paying apple's developer program (99$), it can be done freely but for a limited purpose.\nSigning dmg can be done in two ways :\n\n\n*\n\n*Signing the dmg file itself \n\n*Signing the Application.app directory inside the dmg image \nEditing signed DMG files :\nHere is 3 possibles ways to edit signed applications : \n\n\n*\n\n*Resign the application after edition \n\n*Remove the signature completely and edit the application (the application will still be installable the user will be warned) \n\n*Removing com.apple.quarantine attribute with the command xattr -c after editing the application\nSignature verification :\nDepending on the situation one or both commands are required \ncodesign -v Application.app\ncodesign -v Application.dmg\n\nRemoving application signature\nAfter extracting the dmg etc. Depending on the situation one or both commands are required \ncodesign --remove-signature Application.app\ncodesign --remove-signature Application.dmg\n\nExplaining the failure :\nThe Application is damaged and can't be opened, you should move it to trash is the result of a partial signature removal, because removing _CodeSignature directories is not enough to get rid of the signature; codesign --remove-signature needs to also be run against the package/application/binary  \nRelated lecture : \nCreate dmg - Create dmg from directory - Add signature to dmg - Remove signature - Damaged application - How to code sign - Free developer - Free signature\n", "Q: Problem with Google Drive I have Google Drive installed on my iMac running High Sierra. I have a folder on my machine named Google Drive. I haven't used it in a while. I seem to recall that I once had a menu item for Google Drive. Well, I no longer have a menu item for Google Drive and if I open the Google Drive folder there is only a few MB's used. \nIf I go to Safari and go to Google Drive it says I'm using over 10 GB of my allotted 15 GB and it lists the files which I remember copying to the drive about 2 years ago. Have things changed for Google Drive? Why does the Google Drive folder not reflect what is actually on my Google Drive? At some time in the past, I copied close to 10 GB of data to Google Drive. I have no idea how to do that now.\n\nA: Google Drive is a Online storage, not storing on your Mac.\nJust like iCloud, one-drive and others.\nWhat you have installed on you Mac is just the Google Drive app to manage online drive, not to store information on your Mac.\nGo to your Google drive online (Log in) to see it directly. It will also show you how much storage you use and how much you have left.\nKnow that Google Drive also serves as storage for your Gmail.\nIf need be download and install the Google Drive app again.\nI have 2 Google drives (one comes with each Gmail). I do not use the Google Drive app on my Mac (find it not nesessary). I go online log in to Google and can see and manage my drives there.\n\nA: FWIW, the \"new\" Google Drive Sync is only for enterprise gSuite users. Us lowly civilians (even if you pay for storage) still have to use Google's seemingly-inefficient Backup-and-Sync which is a bit of a dog's breakfast in how it has multiple sync paradigms with Drive Mode, Backup Mode, and Photo Sync mode. If you don't fully understand how these work together it is easy make the mistake of making copies of copies of copies of your photos which is really painful if, say, you're a Google Photos user. Anyway, if you are looking for something a bit more specific to your needs where you Google Drive is a literal drive, there are other ways (and in my opinion, better ways) of making use of your Google Drive storage as true file-level storage that behaves as you would expect a local file system.\nFirst off, I will mention odrive which is a multcloud consolidator that works really well, has Linux support, and a CLI-only version. I doesn't support Posix info (yet) but it allows you to pick and choose which folders you want fully synced and which you want synced on demand. Also, they have a massive update around the corner with odrive2 which does some other really cool stuff with aggregating cloud storage more invisibly which is great for people who like patching together free cloud storage plans to create one coherent drive. The preservation of Posix info (ownership and file mode, for instance) may continue to be an issue because so few cloud providers actually support that and I am not sure if this is being addressed, so caveat emptor in that respect.\nIf you are looking for a clean way to create a virtual file system on your computer rather than an synced folder (which honestly sounds like more your cup of tea) AND preserve things like Posix info (file ownership and mode, for instance), there are two open source projects that make use of Fuse called GCSF and google-drive-ocamlfuse. They both seem to offer the same function but the developer of GCSF explains on Reddit why GCSF is supposed to be faster. I cannot support or deny these claims.\nIn case you don't know, OSX Fuse is a well-established kernel extension not just for MacOS but also for Windows and Linux as well. It provides access to APIs so your OS has driver emulation for all kinds of file system drivers that are otherwise not natively supported on your OS. In the early days, it was to allow Linux users the ability to mount NTFS volumes, but the project has evolved quite a bit since then to the point of being downright indispensable and the standard way of mounting everything from a non-native file system, to cloud storage, to even an SSH or FTP connection. You can install osxfuse either from their site or use homebrew to perform a cask install.\nThere are commercial products out there that appear to do the same thing like ExpandDrive and Mountain Duck which add some really nice features like Cryptomator support as a drive so you can mount portable encrypted volumes more seamlessly than the Cryptomater app does itself.\nIn other words, you have a LOT of options depending on what you need, how much you're willing to hand-roll things, and whether you're open to spending money. Sorry for the lengthly description but I figured it would be helpful to know what else is out there that will probably do what you want more explicitly.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Change the sleep icon in login window (loginwindow.app) I would like to change the sleep icon in the login window.

I know this is not natively supported in macOS, but I think it could be easily solved by an app that does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the sound volume on the external monitor to a desired maximum level.\n\n*The app is a global volume slider for all the sounds generated by the MacBook.\n\n*You can use the app to easily control the sound volume of the external monitor.\nIs there an app that does exactly this?\nEDIT:\nI tried SoundFlower but it was buggy and caused problems with other sound extensions. I discovered Sound Control which exactly does what I want. Even the built in macOS sound control works.\n\nA: A popular 3rd party software that lets you control the volume of a connected external display is Soundflower. It is a kernel extension.\nThe installer for the latest signed version with support for macOS Mojave can be downloaded here. If you use Homebrew, you can also install install it by running the command:\nbrew cask install soundflower\nSince it is a kernel extension, you'll need to enable it by going to System Preferences app → Security & Privacy → General and click on Allow.\n\n\nNext, you'll need to download and install the SoundflowerBed utility. It is the user facing macOS app that will let you control the audio. To install using Homebrew, run the following command:\nbrew cask install soundflowerbed\nYou are all set up now. Simply launch the SoundflowerBed app from Launchpad. It is a Menu bar app. Click on the app icon in the Menu bar and select DisplayPort, Thunderbolt or HDMI as the output in the (2ch) list.\n\nNow, click the volume icon in the Menu bar and choose Soundflower(2ch).

I use macOS 10.14 and came across a problem when I tried to install an open source plugin for Vim that I found on Github. I downloaded the source code and compiled it myself, which worked well, but when I ran it, the execution was interrupted because the \"Code signature [of executable] not valid for use in process\".\nThis has given me a lot of questions that I can't wrap my head around:\nI could either sign it myself, but wouldn't that kind of ruin the purpose of code signing? Is there any qualitative difference in signing code from the internet and allowing apps from unidentified developers in the \"This app was downloaded from the internet\" dialog box?\nIf I don't do it, whose \"responsibility\" is it to sign? The repository maintainer? The contributors? Is Apple expecting open source developers to always have an Apple Developer ID? Or have I misunderstood the purpose of code signing?\nEdit:\nTo clearify, my question is how I should handle unsigned source code that I compile myself, since I don't expect contributers to always be able to, or remember to, sign their code, especially when it comes to tiny contributions to open source projects with many contributers.\n\nA: Signing the program yourself isn't ruining the purpose of code signing. The general purpose of code signing is to make it possible to verify that the program is an unmodified copy that was originally created by a specific entity (person or company). When you sign a program yourself only to run on your computer, you make it possible for the system to check that it is indeed you that created the binary, and that it hasn't been modified by others.\nThe qualitative difference between signing the application binary yourself, and just allowing apps from unidentified developers in GateKeeper is that in the former case you allow a single, specific app to run - whereas the latter, you open for the possibility that you can open lots of different apps just by right-clicking on them and choosing Open. I.e. it is more restrictive and thus somewhat more \"secure\" by signing the specific program yourself.\nThe responsibility of signing is entirely yours. The open source developer cannot sign the source code - it is only possible to sign the compiled binaries. As you're producing the compiled binaries yourself, it falls upon you to sign them.\nYou can sign up for a developer account on Apple's web site that will allow you to create a certificate that can be used for signing. If you're a developer and regularly compiling binaries to run on Macs this is the preferred way of doing things. If this is a one-off thing that you probably won't ever do again, it is probably overkill to go through this process. YMMV.\nOther answers for your question here recommends that you use ad-hoc signing for your binary. That will not work. You will need to generate a valid signature in order to have the binary run with GateKeeper on its most secure setting.\n\nA: Ad-Hoc Code Signing\nFor third party applications and binaries that you compile yourself, and that require code signing, use an ad hoc code signature.\n\n\n*\n\n*I am assuming the application will not run without a signature;\n\n*I am assuming the application will not be distributed;\n\n*I am assuming you do not care about the identity of the signature being valid.\n\n\nAn ad-hoc signature does not provide reliable security benefits. It can be used to determine if the application has been changed and it can be used to apply security restrictions, such as entitlements, to an application.\nAn ad-hoc signature will validate against codesign but not spctl. This may or may not matter depending on the binary being signed. For applications and executables, this is unlikely to matter because spctl is not run on locally created binaries.\nWhy Code Sign?\nRegarding the refined question:\n\nHow I should handle unsigned source code that I compile myself, since I don't expect contributers to always be able to, or remember to, sign their code, especially when it comes to tiny contributions to open source projects with many contributers.\n\nFor most self compiled applications, there is no need for code signing. This assumes you trust the application's code. On macOS, you can open untrusted applications from the Finder, see Apple's Open an app from an unidentified developer.\nIf you do not trust the code or the developers, do not compile or run the application.\nYour Responsibility\nThe provider of the source code has no responsibility or obligation to provide pre-built code signed binaries. Being self compiled, all code signing is your choice and responsibility.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple require submissions to their App Stores to be code signed.\n\n*Apple request developers outside their App Stores sign their code, but it is not yet required.\nIn both cases, only the final binaries are signed. The original source code and resources are not signed.\nSource Code is Not Signed\nSource code itself can not be code signed in a meaningful way for macOS. Source files and code can be digitally signed, as any other file can be, but this makes no impact on how the resulting application or binary is treated by macOS.\nHow to Ad-Hoc Code Sign a Mac Application\nTo codesign an application on macOS with an ad-hoc signature, set the identity -s flag to -:\ncodesign --force -s - </path/to/application>\n\nAll the other rules, requirements, and permutations of the codesign command remain the same.\nThe flag --force is used here to overwrite any existing signature.\nYou might need to add the --deep flag to the codesign command to sign sub-resources such as frameworks and embedded services.\n\nA: \nShould I sign open source code myself?\n\nIf you're not the developer, then no.\nCode signing, in a nutshell, is a method to say you (the developer) are who you say you are and the code hasn't changed since you last signed it.\n\nIs there any qualitative difference in signing code from the internet\n  and allowing apps from unidentified developers in the \"This app was\n  downloaded from the internet\" dialog box?\n\nIt sounds like your confusing Code Signing (what's required by Developers to publish Apps on the App Store) and Gatekeeper (what protects your Mac from installing software from unidentified developers).\nIf you allow your Mac to install software from both the App Store and identified developers, you will still get the popup alerting you to the fact software will be installed\n\nAnd if it's from an unidentified developer, you will get the same popup with a \"warning icon\"\n\nYou can still install the software.  This is just a mechanism that forces user interaction to actually install the software providing you a layer of security against self-installed malware.\n", "Q: How do I connect my Bose QC35 with my MacBook Pro under iOS?

It seems the information is saved as raw data (except one general plist file, maybe that can at least give you some hints), but perhaps you can simply replace that from a TimeMachine backup.

The year of production or the year that model was introduced at an Apple Event?\n\nI want to buy MacBook Pro that would display Early 2019. If I buy a brand new MacBook Pro from Apple Store (or order from Apple Online Store) let's say in February 2019, will it show Early 2019?\nWhat does that year label actually display?\n\nA: The label indicates the time of the year and the year the particular Mac was announced and released for sale by Apple. The label is commonly used to identify the generation of the Mac model (just like various iPhones are commonly differentiated by their marketing name such as iPhone 7, iPhone 8, iPhone XS etc.)\nIt does not represent the date of production. Since it is a model identifier, the label remains the same for all the Macs produced till an update/upgrade to the model is announced. The nomenclature generally used is Early, Mid or Late depending on the time of the year the model was released appended with the year of release.\nFor e.g. the last model of Mac mini released by Apple is labelled Late 2018 as it was released in November 2018. The model it superseded is Late 2014 as it was originally released in October 2014. All Mac minis produced during the four year period were labelled Late 2014 and saw no updates/upgrades from Apple whatsoever.\n\nI want to buy MacBook Pro that would display Early 2019. If I buy a brand new MacBook Pro from Apple Store (or order it online from Apple website) let's say in February 2019, will it show Early 2019?\nWhat does that year label actually display?\n\nThe last release of MacBook Pro was in July 2018 and they are labelled Mid 2018. The one you'll buy in January will be labelled Mid 2018 irrespective of the place you buy it from (unless you end up purchasing an older model, or unless Apple releases a new one in January which will be dubbed Early 2019). Month is never shown as part of the label, so there's will be no February 2019 MacBook Pro.\nNow, if you are interested in determining the actual date of manufacturing of your unit, there are numerous ways. The easiest one being using a popular 3rd party utility called coconutBattery.

I tend to close the lid to  put it in sleep mode before putting it in the backpack. How do I make sure that it is indeed asleep before putting it in?\nI did google this topic a lot. Many people agree that you can close the lid and put it to backpack and travel without any problems. Also, many people disagree that because sometimes MacBook get overheated and some hardware failed because of this. \nFrom what I understand, the only problem against closing lid and travelling is because the MacBook may not fully-sleep properly somehow when closing the lid. So my question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the best practice to make sure my MacBook is fully asleep and safe to be carried around and travel?\n\n\nI am very confused how to make sure my MacBook is fully asleep. Whenever I put my MacBook Pro in sleep mode by clicking  → Sleep or closing the lid, the built-in apple logo on the back of screen just turns off directly.\nSome people mention to make sure sleep light begins to pulse. I have no idea what this means. I don't know what is the sleep light and I don't see any lights pulsing.\nPS: Some tips I found may be useful to you:\nHow to ensure there is no apps preventing your MacBook to sleep?\nlaunch Activity Monitor.app --> Energy tab --> look at the column Preventing Sleep. If there is no Yes. Then there should be no apps stopping the system to sleep. \nI wrote a simple script to make beep noise to test sleep status\nI wrote a simple script to make beep noise. Run the script before closing the lid. If there is no beep noise, it kinda means the app is not running properly, thus it's in a sleep mode. I run this script everytime from terminal.app before closing the lid. \n$ cat sleep-detector.sh\nwhile true;\ndo\n    echo `date` \" -------- not sleep yet\"\n    tput bel\n    sleep 2s\ndone\n\nFrom the output of the program (I am not pasting the output here. You can try it yourself.), even if there is no beep noise, you can see that the script is actually running for about 20 seconds (or less) after the lid is closed. \nIf anyone have any better scripts/ideas, please let me know.\nJust close the lid. Do not use  → Sleep button\nIn some of my tests, if I use  → Sleep button and close the lid immediately without waiting for the system fully asleep, the system actually wakes up by closing the lid. (because my simple beep noise script makes sound in this situation when the lid is closed). So, it's much safer to close the lid directly if you intend to close the lid. \nTurn off Power Nap\nTurn off Bluetooth before closing the lid\nTurn off Wifi (if possible) before closing the lid\nYou can not stop mDNSResponder MaintenanceWake so far in High Sierra\nSo You can just live with it and let MacBook wake periodically. \nYou can find this wake message from the output of pmset -g log | grep -i MaintenanceWake from terminal.\n\nA: \nSome people mention to make sure sleep light begins to pulse. I have no idea what this means. I don't know what is the sleep light and I don't see any lights pulsing.\n\nThe pulsing sleep indicator reference that you appear to be encountering in Web searches is a feature present in non-retina unibody MacBook Pro's (last released in Mid 2012) and looks like this:\n\nImage credit: https://www.nix.ru/art/pic/web_news/2010/jul/pb1279346977.jpg\nThis indicator is not present in retina MacBook Pro, MacBook Air and retina MacBook.\nClosing the lid indeed puts your MacBook Pro (and any other MacBook) to sleep mode. This is the default behaviour. The only cases when a MacBook Pro doesn't enter sleep mode when shutting the lid are:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is connected to an external display. In this case, it works in so called clamshell mode.\n\n*You are using a 3rd party utility program to force MacBook to remain in awake state despite closing the lid.\n\n*When connected to a power source, the MacBook technically remains in sleep mode but can perform certain activities if Power Nap is enabled.\nEven if you are not putting your MacBook Pro to sleep mode explicitly by using  → Sleep command, closing the lid puts it in sleep mode by default. It is quite common practise among MacBook users and some folks (including yours truly) seldom shut down their MacBook Pro.\nThere should generally be no risk in carrying it in your backpack. However, it would be advisable to watch (hear) for any fan noises and look (feel) for any heat to die down before tucking it in.\n\nA: It’s super easy to ensure sleep if you first log out. That shows if any programs are blocking sleep and then you can sleep the Mac trusting it’s ready to sleep.\nMost App Store apps are well behaved in practice, so you don’t need to do this unless you have a lot of apps that are side loaded and run with lots of threads and  windows like third party browsers and such...\n", "Q: Enable restrictions on Guest user Our employees are logging into our shared computer using Guest user.\nAt some point somebody will click on an email address and Mail.app will open.

(for desktop) I am looking for a solution primarily for macbook and desktop use and in a web browser - possibly an extension or plug in.\nI have an inner ear condition and scrolling makes me dizzy. \nIt is a long shot but is there anything at all I can do to not have to look at the scrolling page? Is there any browser extension or similar that would revert the scrolling experience back to a page by page view? Or any other way you can think of which would allow me to do page-by-page scrolling?\n\nA: I think what you're most likely interested in is disabling a certain animation. \nI'm on Mojave, but the following command supposedly works since Mountain Lion (I tested it with Numbers and Safari):\ndefaults write -g NSScrollAnimationEnabled -bool NO\n\nIn case you don't know how to enter this: Open the Terminal application (it's in Applications - Utilities, or you just open it using Spotlight) and enter the command there. You will need to restart an application for it to have an effect (e.g. Safari won't only change behavior after you do that).\nThis should affect all applications unless the developers did some weird custom stuff to move around a scroll view.\nWhat it does is, I think, exactly what you want: It disables the scrolling animation when you press the \"PageUp\" and \"PageDown\" buttons. \nActually I guess it disables animations during scrolling in general, but when using the scroll wheel or the regular arrow keys the jumped distance is so small that subsequent jumps result in a \"manual animation\" anyways (animations are after all just a row of still images with small differences shown quickly one after another).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro keyboard replacement: Refurbished or new components? I'm about to send my 2016 MacBook Pro for a top case replacement due to a failing keyboard. Since the battery will also be replaced as a part of the top case, I'm wondering if Apple installs a refurbished battery or a brand new one? And for that matter, is there any way to really tell?\n\nA: Batteries are never refurbished and installed brand new. The usage status of a battery can be determined by looking at the consumed charge cycles (1 full charge and discharge constitute 1 charge cycle).\nYou can easily determine the battery charge cycles consumed by going to  → About This Mac → System Report... → Hardware → Power → Battery Information → Health Information → Cycle Count. It should look something like this:\n\nThere's also an excellent 3rd party tool called coconutBattery which is very easy to use.\n", "Q: Xcode completion menu not completing on enter, I have to use mouse/touchpad cursor and click there... Xcode completion menu not completing on enter, I have to use mouse/touchpad cursor and click there, so its quite annoying. How can I just autocomplete by keyboard ? Is this some miss-configuration of keybindings ? I never used Xcode editor so I am not sure if this is not standard behavior... Coming from App-code so I am used to do everything by keyboard but most of keybindings I had to re-configure...\n\nA: This is weird and seems to be a bug in your installation somehow, i.e. it's certainly not how Xcode is supposed to work. \nThe standard shortcut to open the code completion menu (which seems to work for you, I'm just being thorough here) is Alt+Esc. For some reason simply pressing Esc also works (at least for me, has always been that way and I always used the default settings in Xcode). \nStepping through the suggestions has, according to the settings, the shortcuts Ctrl+. (that's a full stop) and Ctrl+→, but using the arrow keys also works for me (and always has), in spite of not being defined in the settings. \nSelecting/confirming an entry doesn't even have a shortcut per se, because it's less an Xcode and more of a standard selection mechanism for any similar kind of list under macOS I guess. It doesn't even show up in the settings as far as I can see it. For me (and everybody else I have ever worked with) it's done as you expect as well: Pressing Return or Enter (both work).\nThis unfortunately only answers half of your question: As said, the behavior you see is not the standard (or to be expected at all).\nI'd suggest to take a look at the \"Key Bindings\" section of the Preferences (\"Xcode - Preferences...\" menu), though I assume you already did that. It can list conflicts for you. Other than that you also might want to take a look at the general input settings (\" - System Preferences... - Keyboard\"). You can also define various keyboard shortcuts there, maybe that's causing some kind of conflict.\n\nA: I had the same problem, turns out I somehow messed with my key bindings.\nTo fix this, I removed the following entry from ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/KeyBindings/Default.idekeybindings, and then restarted Xcode:\n-           <key>\n-</key>\n-           <string>insertNewline:</string>\n\n", "Q: Fix apple macbook pro 10.6.8 I have a Mac Book Pro 10.6.8 and I cant operate safari, and chrome is outdated? Is there anythingI can do, or do I just need a new computer? I was told my lap top was ancient.  \n\nA: On the assumption that your laptop is as old as the last Snow Leopard OS (10.6.8) that makes it 7 years old, and well into the age where it can be expected to stop working without warning. Browsers that ran on Snow Leopard are no longer supported by many websites so if you want to keep using it, you will be limited to mail, documents and basic internet usage.\nSo yes, whoever said your laptop was ancient was correct. Time for new hardware. \nGood news is performance is way up, and prices are down. For example, My Air boots in 8 seconds and runs for 12 hours on the battery.\nDo you have a backup of your laptop? My guess is No. Go buy an external drive and run Time Machine before your 7 year old internal drive decides to quit on you.\n", "Q: No audio in Safe Mode MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) Mojave.  I have been using Safe Mode to see if I can find out information about my trackpad. Then I quickly realized that I do not have any audio.

It's like the opposite of PaintCode, which turns drawings into code. (I'm a mathematician, not an artist, so I want/need to describe images with formulas and equations.)\nSadly, macOS Mojave broke OSAX functionality, making Smile completely unusable.[*] Besides, the oh-so-rudimentary Smile UI can be pretty frustrating. It's time to seek an alternative.\nThe \"code\" doesn't have to be AppleScript. I've seen a couple of open-source (usually Qt) apps for editing TikZ, a programmatic graphics language. However, these are geared towards tweaking TikZ code for import into a LaTeX documents and whatnot; I'm looking for something more of a stand-alone document editor, capable of exporting to PDF or EPS directly. (But if there's a really good Mac-like TikZ editor, I'd consider it.)\n\n[*] There's apparently an AppleScript workaround using an an auxiliary SatimageOSAX app, but I haven't gotten it to work with Smile. Besides, it's only a patch, doomed to break eventually.\n\nA: MetaPost\nAn open source and complete picture drawing language, with plenty of support and documentation, is MetaPost.\n\nThe MetaPost system (by John Hobby) implements a picture-drawing language very much like that of MetaFont; the difference is that MetaPost outputs vector graphic files instead of run-length-encoded bitmaps; output formats available are PostScript and SVG.\n\nMetaPost is capable of creating complex images and shapes:\n\nbeginfig(11)\n    pair A, B, C;\n    A:=(0,0); B:=(1cm,0); C:=(0,1cm);\n    draw A--B;\n    draw B--C dashed evenly;\n    draw C--A dashed withdots;\n\nendfig;\n\n\nbeginfig(117)\n  u:=2cm;\n  pair A, B, C, D, E;\n  path p, q, r;\n\n  A = u*up;\n  p := (-.2)[ A, A rotated 72 ] -- (1.2)[ A, A rotated 72 ];\n  for i=0 upto 5:\n    draw p rotated 72i;\n  endfor;\n  B := 1/2[ A, A rotated 72 ];\n  C := .8*B;\n\n  p := B --- C ..

One purpose of Sketch was to demonstrate how to incorporate AppleScript into an application.\n\nA: Open Source - Computer Aided Design\nAnother possibility for your laser-cutting projects is a full Computer Aided Design (CAD) application. There are a few open source (free and community maintained) choices, as well as plenty of commercial options.\n\n\n*\n\n*\nLibreCAD\nLibreCAD is a free Open Source CAD application for Windows, Apple and Linux.

Parametric modeling allows you to easily modify your design by going back into your model history and changing its parameters.\n\n\nA: Don't forget that PostScript itself is a programming language, with clear commands for creating vector objects.\nThere are many resources for programming in PostScript, not least on Adobe's website.\n", "Q: Will the 2018 Mac mini be able to use my 2011 iMac in Target Display Mode? I'm currently using a 2015 MacBook Pro and using a Thunderbolt cable to my 2010 27 inch iMac as the screen in Target Display Mode. I want to upgrade the MacBook Pro to a Mac mini, which has Thunderbolt 3, not Thunderbolt 2. \nWill the Mac mini do that, and will I need an adaptor or something?\n\nA: I think I found the answer, buried deep in Apples support doc for the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adaptor. \n\nThis adapter is not compatible with displays that use DisplayPort or\n  Mini DisplayPort, such as the Apple LED Cinema Display. Thunderbolt\n  and Thunderbolt 2 are not the same as Mini DisplayPort , though the\n  ports have the same shape.\n\nApparently Thunderbolt 3 does not pass mini display port signals, so target display mode will not work if you have an older iMac or monitor that uses mini display port.\nThis makes a big difference to me, as I will have to buy a new monitor if I go ahead with a mac mini. At least thats what it looks like from the doc. I'd welcome anyone who has actually done this.\n\nA: I think I have a definite answer to my question, so I'm putting this up for anyone else in a similar situation.\nI bought a 2018 Mac mini, and set it up today and I can confirm that Target Display Mode works using a non-Apple USB-C to mini DisplayPort adaptor, plugged into the mini's Thunderbolt3 (USB-C) port. Target display is an iMac mid 2010 27\".  I also bought an Apple Thunderbolt3 to Thunderbolt2 adaptor and tried using it for Target Display Mode, but it doesn't work.\nThe Mac mini setup went pretty well actually, so I'm pretty happy about that.\n\nA: It should work with a Thunderbolt 3/USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 adaptor, either from Apple (expensive) or a third party. It might well also work with a cheaper USB-C to Mini DisplayPort adaptor or cable, since Thunderbolt 2 should be compatible with Mini DisplayPort, which would have to be third-party, because Apple don’t make one. \n", "Q: Is it possible to show subtitles in an embedded movie in Keynote? I have an embedded movie in a Keynote presentation that I’ll be giving to a set of people who don’t have english as a first language. I looked for the option to turn on subtitles but with no luck. Is this functionality missing?\nI’m using Keynote 8.3 (the current version at time of writing) if that makes any difference.\n\nA: The easiest solution for you would probably to burn-in the subtitles (e.g. render the subtitle into the video). This can be done with a multitude of applications like Handbrake, FFmpeg, FCP X etc.\nWhile it is generally possible to show embedded movie subtitles (e.g. subtitle tracks in the movie file) in Keynote, this is not usable for presentations. While the subtitles are shown in the editing view, they are hidden in the presentation view.\nAnyway, to show embedded subtitle tracks in editing view:\nOpen any movie w/ subtitles in QT Player (e.g. your movie added to Keynote), enable the wanted subtitle track in QT Player.\nThe subtitle setting from QT player carries over to Keynote (for some reason only Apple knows).\nMojave 10.14.4, Keynote 9.0.1\n\nEDIT:\nFixed in Keynote 9.0.2!\nUpdate notes from Keynote in the Mac App Store:\n\nThis update addresses an issue that caused closed captions for videos\n  to fail to play during a slideshow.\n\nTested, works, subs show in the slideshow now.\nSame technique as before (enable subs track in QT player).\n", "Q: Recover iCloud data from lost device My friend had an iPhone 6 that was lost recently. The phone is offline now so we couldn't locate it using Find My Phone\nShe wants to recover the data from the iCloud account connected to the lost device. When she tried to login to the Online portal for iCloud, we were asked to enter a verification code that was being sent to the lost device. So she got a new sim card under the same number, put it in a new phone and tried the SMS option for the verification code. But it seems any sms that is being sent to the number is sent as an to the lost device and not as a normal sms. So we cannot get the verification code now.\nAny other way to get the verification code or possibly change the phone number of the iCloud account without access to the device ?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: It sounds like the account is protected with two-factor authentication.\nAccording to the FAQ on Apple's information about two-factor authentication\n\nWhat if I don’t have access to a trusted device or didn't receive a verification code?\nIf you're signing in and don’t have a trusted device handy that can display verification codes, you can have a code sent to your trusted phone number via text message or an automated phone call instead. Click Didn't Get a Code on the sign in screen and choose to send a code to your trusted phone number.\n\nYou mentioned that the phone number is still the same, however, the normal SMS option is not working, so I would try the phone call method instead.\nThere is more information about how to get a verification code and sign in with two-factor authentication available at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204974.\nShould these options still not work, you can request account recovery to regain access to your account.\n", "Q: Delete all data from MacBook except a certain folder?

I contacted Apple and they told me to contact IUGO Mobile. Unfortunately, IUGO Mobile hasn't replied to my e-mails. I was hoping there was a way to backup and restore (local game mode) unlocks to avoid this situation when replacing my iPad.\n\nA: Normally apps that sell in-app-unlocks (as apposed to like packs of currency or the like) will have a button to restore purchases. This will give you the unlock again after it checks your account. \nIt is dependant on the app though. IF the game has login system with a username and password etc, then it may keep track of the purchase from your login information. \n", "Q: External drive APFS encryption secure? I just erased a newly purchased external USB disk using the Disk Utility program and set it to use the file system APFS Encrypted. I entered a strong password and the whole process took about a minute, then the device was supposedly encrypted and ready for use.\nI noted that APFS encryption uses AES-128 which seems good, but the fact that the formatting only took a minute seems weird. Using encryption software like TrueCrypt, to safely prepare a new device takes hours, even days, just to fill the disk with random data before any valuable data is saved onto the device. For this reason, I am concerned that my APFS encrypted device is not secure enough. \nAre my concerns legitimate or have I misunderstood something here? \n\nA: Did you click click Security Options, and use the slider to set how any times the data should be erased? \nWriting over the disk is to stop old files from being accessible. \nThe time to encrypt a disk depends mostly on how many files need to be encrypted and it they old files should be overwritten. \nAs it is a new drive there won't be a lot of files to convert. \n", "Q: Decrypt files recovered from encrypted external hard drive I am trying to recover the data from one of the external hard drives of my company.

I would look for ones with Displayport (mini or otherwise) and/or HDMI as you will have smaller connectors and an all digital path for the video signal.\nMonitors often come with cables already, select your adapters to connect to the cables your monitor comes with or recommends.\n", "Q: Mail cannot connect to google account, won't open once quit Pretty simple - mail showed as unable to check for new message (tilde by the inbox, etc.). The activity doctor confirmed it could connect to the internet but not the mail servers. Quitting mail and trying to re-open it resulted in the error \"Mail cannot save information about your mailboxes because of a network problem.\" \n\nA: I had this problem yesterday and restarting seemed to fix the issue. When it came back today I looked online but couldn't find any answers. A look in the console showed that the issue was not network related, but actually caused by low disk space. Sure enough, making some space on my drive ( . . .was down to the bytes) immediately fixed the issue.\nMoral of the story: Keep your disk clean!\n", "Q: Running macOS Sierra (10.12) or macOS High Sierra (10.13) on a 21.5\" mid 2017 iMac I'm looking at buying a new 21.5\" mid 2017 iMac which will ship with macOS Mojave 10.14.\nI have some software that will only run on macOS Sierra 10.12.\nIs it possible to downgrade to macOS Sierra 10.12 on this iMac by wiping the hard disk and reinstalling the OS from a USB installer? Does the mid 2017 iMac have the drivers to run macOS Sierra? If not do they have the drivers to run macOS High Sierra?\n\nA: The mid 2017 21.5\" iMac (both Retina 4K and non-retina models) originally shipped with macOS Sierra 10.12.4. Thus, both macOS Sierra and macOS High Sierra have the drivers to run on either one of the iMac's.\nIt would be possible to run the last (publicly available) release of both macOS Sierra 10.12.6 and macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 on either one of the iMac's by installing via USB installer or via Internet recovery.\nThe installer can use downloaded from the Mac App Store:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS Sierra 10.12.6 - Mac App Store\n\n*macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 - Mac App Store\n", "Q: Macbook wakes up unexpectedly when the lid remains closed (power unplugged) My Environment\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) and OS: 10.13.6.\n\n*pmset:\n\n    $ pmset -g\n    System-wide power settings:\n    Currently in use:\n     standbydelay         10800\n     standby              1\n     halfdim              1\n     hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n     powernap             0\n     gpuswitch            2\n     disksleep            10\n     sleep                1\n     autopoweroffdelay    28800\n     hibernatemode        3\n     autopoweroff         1\n     ttyskeepawake        1\n     displaysleep         2\n     acwake               0\n     lidwake              0\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Power unplugged.

I tried writing the following files:\n# /etc/hosts.allow\nsshd: 192.168.1.32\nsshd: 192.168.1.33\n\n# /etc/hosts.deny\nsshd: ALL\n\nThen restarting with:\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist\nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist\n\nUnloading ssh.plist successfully disabled ssh, but after reloading I can still connect from any IP.\nHow can I configure an IP whitelist?\n\nA: hosts.allow and hosts.deny are only used when you run the service (sshd) through TCP wrappers. The default macOS install does not do that, so they will not have any effect.\nAs recommended by other answers, you could use a firewall to restrict access to SSH. This could be a hardware (i.e. \"external\") firewall or a software firewall such as the built-in pf firewall.\nHowever, I wouldn't recommend using a firewall only. The best is to limit the sshd service itself - and if you want, you can add the firewall protection to that. The reasoning behind that is that if for some reason your firewall gets disabled, outside users would suddenly be allowed access to communicate with sshd - you really do not want that.\nIn order to configure sshd to limit access, you will need to edit the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config, and add the following:\nAllowUsers username@192.168.1.32 username@192.168.1.33\n\nwhere you replace \"username\" with your actual username.\nIf you want you can replace parts with * to denote a wildcard, such as for example username@192.168.1.* or *@192.168.1.32. You can read more about the options in the man page for sshd_config.\n\nA: hosts.allow and hosts.deny has been deprecated and you should be using a firewall (pf) instead.\nThe default rule for pf can be found in /etc/pf.conf.  You could edit this file directory or create your own custom rule set, but be sure to copy the contents of the default file to it.  Add the following two lines:\n# The name of the network interface as shown in ifconfig\next_if=\"en0\"\n\ntcp_services = \"{ssh}\"\nicmp_types = \"{echoreq, unreach}\"\ntrusted = \"{192.168.1.32, 192.168.1.33}\"\n\n# Exempt the loopback interface to prevent services that use if from being blocked\nset skip on lo0\n\n# This is a desktop so we have to be permissive in allowing outgoing  connections\npass out quick modulate state\n\n\n# Block all incoming SSH Traffic by default \n  block in on $ext_if inet proto tcp from any to any port $tcp_services\n\n# Allow SSH traffic from trusted IPs\npass in on $ext_if inet proto tcp from $trusted to any port $tcp_services\n\nNext, enable pf with the command\n$ sudo pfctl -e                                 #if using the default /etc/pf.conf\n$ sudo pfctl -e -f /path/to/custom_pf.conf      #if using a custom pf.conf\n\nThis ruleset will by default, block SSH to all but the trusted IPs that are defined.  All other services will not be impacted.  \n", "Q: move pdf through clipboard $ cat scaswd.pdf| pbcopy\n$ pbpaste > astasd.pdf\n$ open astasd.pdf\n\nastasd.pdf cannot be opened, but scaswd.pdf is a valid pdf file.\nIs there a way I can stick a pdf onto my clipboard and paste it somewhere else?\n\nI want to copy a file from my local computer to a remote one I can only access with ssh, without using intermediary file-hosting servers.\n(I can't scp)\nFor text files copy and pasting between terminals works.\nFor binary files, like a pdf, I need another solution.\n\nA: From the man page of pbcopy \n\npbcopy  takes the standard input and places it in the specified\n  pasteboard. If no pasteboard is specified, the general pasteboard will\n  be used by\n         default.  The input is placed in the pasteboard as plain text data unless it begins with the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)  file\nheader  or  the\nRich Text Format (RTF) file header, in which case it is placed in the pasteboard as one of those data types.\n\nSo from this it would seem that only documents with RTF format or EPS format can be copied and pasted from these commands. \nFinder does support copy and pasting files however, so cmd c, and cmd v, will copy and paste files in finder. \n\nA: You can cat the pdf file and redirect the output to a file without using the clipboard.\ncat scaswd.pdf > astasd.pdf; open astasd.pdf\n\n\nA: Partial or preliminary answer, needs work on the exact syntax, scripting experts, please help:\nThe clipboard can do a bit more than the manpage for pbcopy and pbpaste reveals. Obviously, most of us have copied and pasted something else then pure text. Pictures for example.\nYou might try something like this:\nosascript -e 'set the clipboard to (read POSIX file (\"/Users/YOU/test.pdf\") as PDF file)'\n\nThe above is not the correct syntax near às PDF file` and will throw an error. But it works for JPEG files, PNGs etc.\nLeaving out the latter part with the slightly incorrect input-syntax copies 'something' to the clipboard.\nChecking the content with `osascript -e 'clipboard info' gives then not something like \n\nUnicode text, 92, string, 46, styled Clipboard text, 22, «class utf8», 46, «class ut16», 94\n\n\nbut\n\nastasd.pdf: PDF document, version 1.4\n\n\nOnly that this is then not copied out correctly.\n`\n", "Q: Prevent admin/Jamf Pro from accessing/deleting 2nd partition The company I work for wants to install Jamf Pro on my \"work\" Macbook.\nI want to create a 2nd partition on my Macintosh HD (with its own Mac OS version) for personal use.\nIf Jamf Pro is installed on the 1st partition, will/can it have access to the 2nd partition?\nI guess if Jamf Pro is given admin rights, it can do whatever it wants, even delete the 2nd partition from within the 1st one, so my question is can I protect my 2nd partition in some way, before Jamf Pro is installed on the 1st one, so that it has no way of deleting/acccessing the 2nd partition ?\nThanks\n\nA: Having 2 different \"OSes\" on 2 partitions should allow you to encrypt them indivually. \nIf you create a new partition, install mac there, and enable Filevault there, it should not be readible from the other boot partition. \nI don't think you can stop it from being deleted though.

I’m purchasing a 2017 MacBook Pro and plan to use my old Mid-2011 iMac as a monitor in Target Display Mode. \nI’ve discovered I need a USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 connection to make this work, but I’m having some difficulty finding a cable that works. I tried a USB-C to Mini-Display Port (using my work laptop, same as I’m ordering) without success. \nDoes such a cable exist? \nI’ve seen male USB-C to female Thunderbolt 2 adapters that would require a male to male Thunderbolt cable, but they’re pricey and I’d like some confirmation that they work before I purchase one. \nCan anyone confirm that this setup would work please?\n\nA: You're not going to find a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 cable as an adapter is required to connect to legacy devices.\nOne of the (major) differentiators between Thunderbolt 1/2 and Thunderbolt 3 is that Thunderbolt 1/2 required the cable to be active (it required power to operate) whereas Thunderbolt 3 can use standard USB Type C cables (it's passive)1.\n\nWith these older Thunderbolt standards, the cable was active, meaning\n  the cable itself is a device that requires power to operate (which is\n  why most Thunderbolt 1 or 2 devices would require an external power\n  source in order to function.)\n\nThunderbolt 3 is backward compatible, but will require an adapter.2\nFrom the FAQ:\n\nIs Thunderbolt 3 backwards compatible with Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2?\nYes, solutions and products built to Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2 specifications will work with Thunderbolt 3 via an adapter.\n\n(emphasis mine)\nTo make your setup work, something like the StarTech TBT3TBTADAP TB 3 to Legacy TB adapter.\n\nI've personally used this adapter to connect a 2018 MacBook Pro to a legacy (Thunderbolt 1) WD MyBook Duo and it worked with no issues.\n\nNote\nThis kind of adapter is only compatible with Thunderbolt devices, not Mini DisplayPort.\n\n1 C|Net:  USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3: One port to connect them all\n2 Thunderbolt Technology Frequently Asked Questions\n\nA: I don't think a straight-up cable exists, no. However, you can get an adapter/dongle that works perfectly well for your scenario. You'll need to Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 adapter:\nhttps://www.apple.com/us_smb_83039/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter\nYou can read more about the adapter here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207266\nNote that Target Display Mode is not using the same kind of signal as mini-DisplayPort - therefore a USB-C to mini-DisplayPort cable will not work! It needs to be an actual Thunderbolt 2 source.\n", "Q: Mac 10.13, 10.14 where are the hash passwords located? I ran to view the contents of a shadow file for a user:\nsudo plutil -p /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/<username>.plist\n\nbut when I get to Default it says permission denied, either as a user or root, any ideas?\n\nA: 10.14 protects these files with SIP, so even root cannot access the files without using the directory services command.  If you need to get this information deactivate SIP.  Remember to reactivate SIP after you are finished.  If you attempt to access using the directory services call shown above then you do not need to deactivate SIP.\n\nA: Disabling SIP, or trying to read the files directly, is not the thing to do here if you want to read a user record. You should use dscl to read things from Directory Services.\ndscl . read Users/<username>\nsudo dscl . read Users/<username> ShadowHashData\n\nYou can choose different formats for the output as well like -plist.\n\nA: You need to deactivate the SIP, which protects these files.\nIn terminal, you need to write this to disable it, and you should get this message:\ncsrutil disable\n\nSuccessfully disabled System Integrity Protection. Please restart the machine for the changes to take effect.\n\nrestart your computer once the command is successful. Then, you type your code into terminal:\nsudo plutil -p /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/<username>.plist\n\nand extract the files accordingly.\nOnce you are finished, remember to re-enable the SIP.\ncsrutil enable\n\n\nA: Using sudo plutil -p to access these plists still works in 10.13+, even with SIP enabled.

Is there a way to move to the front or back of a long sentence you type in the URL area on a iPhone with out having to get close as possible and then having to delete then retype? \n\nA: Yes, just checked it on my iPhone, and have been using it on my iPad for awhile.\nOn an iPhone you have to do a long press(or 3D press) on the keyboard (Trackpad mode, thanks @fsb for its official name), this turns the whole keyboard into a trackpad bound to the text cursor. \nThe keyboard will turn grey and the letters will disapear. You can now move your finger and it will move the text cursor.\nDemonstration on Youtube.\nOn the iPad it works with 2 fingers together as well.\nThe other method is holding your finger down when trying to select a spot in text till a magnifier pops up, but that is not as easy with URLs.\n", "Q: How do I know when my HD is under maintenance? I work with several large movie files, almost all with 150+ GB. And sometimes I experience a harsh slow down on my iMac's speed which is accompanied by a writing/reading HD noise. So I'm pretty sure the disc is defragging or doing some kind of maintenance. According to this article:\nhttps://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/how-defrag-mac-why-you-dont-need-3600241/\n\"That's not to say that a manual defrag is never needed; it's just rare. People (usually creatives) that have hundreds of films/audio/multimedia files larger than 1GB may need to defrag a Mac.\"\nSo I wonder if:\nis there a method to find out if my HD is under maintenance?\nCan I took control over this process? Like changing the schedule of the task, maybe using one of the listed tps of the article?\n\nFurther info\n\n\n\nA: The problems you're experiencing are not due to this \"automatic defragmention\".\nYou question seem to indicate that you think of this defragmentation similar to for example the Windows defragmentation program, where you start a lengthy process and wait for minutes or hours where the disk is fully utilized, and then finally your disk is defragmented. This is simply not how it works here, so your questions do not make sense in that regard.\n\"Automatic defragmentation\" on HFS+ happens in two ways: On-the-fly and Hot File Clustering.\n\n\n*\n\n*On-the-fly means that whenever the system opens a file, it checks if the file is sufficiently small (<20 MB), is not busy, is not read-only, it has not been changed in the past minute and is sufficiently fragmented (>8 extents). If all those conditions are true, and the computer has been running for more than 3 minutes, then the file (and only that file) is defragmented on-the-fly.\n\n*Hot File Clustering means that the operating system keeps track of the most used files on your system - up to 5000 files. When such a new file is added to the top list, and the file is sufficiently small (<10 MB), then the file is moved to a specific hot zone on the disk. This implicitly defragments the file. \nTherefore:\n\n\n*\n\n*The hard drive is never \"under maintenance\". Automatic defragmentation is not something that is done for a full drive, and it is not something that hinders other accesses to the disk. Thus it doesn't make sense to try to figure out if your disk is \"under maintenance\".\n\n*You cannot take control of the processs. There's no lengthy process happening that is defragmentation your entire disk at once. Thus there's really not much to control in the process. The actual automatic defragmentation occurs over the course of a single second or less.\n\n*You cannot change the schedule of the process - because there isn't a schedule. This is not like for example Windows Defragmentation where some in the Windows 95-era would set up a scheduled task to defragment their hard disk every Monday evening. Automatic defragmentation here does not happen on a time based schedule. Instead it is simply based on which files you open - which cannot be predicted in advance.\n\n*Both types of \"automatic defragmentation\" only works on small files (<20 MB or <10 MB) - so they could never have been invoked for your 150+ GB large files.\nThe macOS system does not by default perform any other type of automatic, periodic \"maintenance\" of a hard drive without being requested specifically by the user.\nTherefore you'll need to look for something \"out of the ordinary\", such as a hardware error, software bug or configuration issue. You can do this for example by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Examining system Console logs and dmesg outputs for indications of I/O errors from the RAID-drive.\n\n*Examining administrative software for your OWC RAID-system to see if it has logs or indicators of errors or problems.\n\n*Use disk latency testing tools (such as for example fio) to check if your RAID-drive has latency issues in general, for example with high number of IOPS.\n\n*Use system monitoring tools such as Activity Monitor, top, filesys, etc. to check for resource exhaustion and/or programs hogging the disk bandwidth.\n\nA: There is no maintenance - there is just how the IO subsystem chooses to write new blocks. \n* (Sorry to refute the whole premise of your question, but based on the comments - I wanted to reinforce this answer plainly and clearly for everyone.)\nAn abnormally slow HD is the #1 sign that it's about to fail, so please make a backup before anything else. Put another way, thinking your hard drive is doing extra clean up work actually is the failure mode where it re-maps bad blocks and takes a lot of reads / writes to verify data was saved correctly. It's potentially dealing with reliability and accuracy that has nothing to do with the OS.\n\nTo solve the slowness, you'll have to look into the performance or run hardware tests to see why you're not getting the bandwidth or iOPS you expect from your hardware. (as the excellent answer here already details)\nBefore you do that, I'd probably make a full backup and wipe the Mac and erase / install a clean OS.\nYou'll know right away if the performance is back or if you have hardware issues. From there, you can restore your accounts and apps and data and then see if it was user level corruption. The work above requires pretty technical skills and lots of time. An erase can happen while you're out for a hike or eating and the testing takes just a short time. If you need to restore from a backup, do that before bed and it usually is done before you wake.\n", "Q: Can my iPad and iPhone share iTunes, but have different game centers? Trying to merge I have an iPad tied to my work email for everything. I have an iPhone tied to my personal email. My work email is about to go away, but I'm keeping the iPad. I have a number of games in use on the iPad and don't want to, for example, reset Candy Crush from level 2057 back to 1. \nIs it possible to keep the iPad Game Center, even if I switch the overall device to use the personal email? Is there a password tied to Game Center that I better reset so I remember it before I change the device email? I don't think the iPhone has any worthwhile Game Center content, so if I have to abandon it I don't care.\nCan you give me a precise sequence of steps to follow to ensure that the Game Center on the iPad survives, while changing all other identities on the iPad to the iPhone ID? Note that I don't think either device has any paid content in iTunes if that simplifies anything (iPad maybe one app, but nothing expensive).  \n\nA: Yes! Just go to Settings - GameCenter and you can sign in using the applicable Apple ID you want to use for that service.\nYou can use a different Apple ID for each individual Apple service (iTunes/App Store, iCloud, iMessage, FaceTime, GameCenter)–you just need to go to their settings page and sign in with the one you want.\nDo keep in mind that some games use iCloud to store their game data, which may affect your plan.\n", "Q: iPhone 7 won't charge consistently from MacBookAir 2015 I've had my MacBook 11' 2015 Air since July 2016 and my iPhone 7 since April 2017, and my phone never had any issues charging on my Mac. I'm not sure when it started, but at some point both USB ports in my MacBook won't charge my iPhone 7, it just keeps going from charging to not charging very rapidly which only makes it even more annoying and frustrating. \nI've tried multiple different cords, reset my iPhone, shut down and reset the NVRAM on my Mac, force quit USBD, deleted (and later reinstalled) the Thunderbridge network. \nI'm far from a computer person, so I am very frustrated and currently want to smash both devices :-). I've googled it plenty, but hopefully I can get some new results that actually work.\nIf you have any solutions, please help me out here and explain it clearly to someone who knows how to operate a computer, but has little knowledge of coding or most of the inner workings of a computer.\n\nA: \nI'm not sure when it started, but at some point both USB ports in my\n  MacBook won't charge my iPhone 7, it just keeps going from charging to\n  not charging really rapidly\n\nGiven that you've tried different cables, you've ruled out the possibility of the cable failing.  However, there are a few more things to try to isolate the problem\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the SMC (this manages the power in your MacBook)\n\n*Try a different computer with the same cable and iPhone.  If the problem goes away, you've narrowed it to your MacBook.  If not, the problem is with your device.\n\n*Try a different device with your MacBook.  Same concept as the previous point; if the symptoms remain, it's probably your MacBook.\n\n\nNow, given that it's happening on both ports, it's entirely possible that there is an issue with the power rail that supplies the 5V to the USB port, the USB controller itself (unlikely unless your keyboard, Bluetooth, camera also stopped working) or any of the related components.  If this is the case, you will need to take it in for repair.\nThis YouTube video from Louis Rossman on repairing the USB port is a good resource for what the problem might actually be (I've started the video at the point where he discusses the 5V power).\n", "Q: iPads stuck in Guided Access Mode We have multiple kiosks running iOS 12 that have just become paper weights. Triple tapping the home button will not break guided Access mode. Force rebooting will return the iPad directly back into the kiosk app, where it still can't end guided access mode. They are bricked. This has happened to multiple devices starting two weeks ago. Any ideas?\n\nA: Looks like your devices are in Single App Mode- different from Guided Access. This is enabled through Apple Configurator or an MDM solution. To exit, connect the device to a Mac with Apple Configurator 2 installed. Then, select the device and the Actions menu (in the menu bar) select Advanced - Stop Single App Mode. \nTo re-enable kiosk mode, simply follow the same process, instead selecting Start Single App Mode.\nNote: If Single App Mode was started using a configuration profile or MDM, you'll need to remove the profile, which can be done by selecting Actions - Remove - Profiles...\n", "Q: Caps to Shift Lock It would be awesome if the caps key could change the numbers to symbols as well.  For instance, with caps on, it would be nice if pressing \"4\" would produce \"$\".  Is there an easy way to do this on mac?\nThanks!\nEDIT:  Is there a way to do it with this command \"setxkbmap\"?  Or from the command line somehow?\n\nA: Karabiner app should do that.\nYou can change the caps lock key to another key.

I have tried the following:\n\n$ sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\n\n$ sudo killall -9 mDNSResponderHelper mDNSResponder\n\n\n$ sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\n\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist: Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged\n\nNone of them stop mDNSResponder from running. \nWhy do I want to do this? I just want to stop it before closing the lid. Because this stupid app is waking up my system when my lid remains closed. I tried many ways to avoid it running when system is at sleep. But none of them works. So the best option is just to force kill it and re-run it later. Thanks a lot. \nBtw, this is not a XY question. I mean I want to stop it. The above explanation is just to clarify the reason why I want to do it, otherwise, people may ask why I want to do it and ask me not to do. Well, I really want to stop it and this is the question. The app is 100% useless to me when my system is at sleep and my lid is closed. Thanks.\n\nA: You cannot unload mDNSResponder on a standard setup with SIP enabled. You will have to disable SIP from Recovery mode in order to be able to do so. \nI would not recommend running with SIP permanently disabled, which would be necessary if you want to periodically unload/load mDNSResponder with launchctl. So if you really want to do this (relatively obscure) thing, then I suggest permanently unloading the launch daemon, and then manually starting/stopping mDNSResponder as needed. The latter can be done with SIP enabled.\nA different way to approach the issue, assuming that network traffic is the cause of the wakes, could be to let mDNSResponder run all the time, and use the built-in firewall pf to block all traffic from mDNSResponder before going to sleep, and removing the block after it wakes. \nYet another could be to take a look at the IOPlatformFeatureDefaults and check if TCPKeepAliveDuringSleep is enabled, and try disabling that. It could fix your problem potentially.

But they act like Banners. Is there something that I can do to achieve that behavior?\n\nA: Chrome uses its own type of notifications that aren't necessarily system native - my apologies for the extreme vagueness, I don't know how else to put it. This can depend on whether its a website notification that you can get from an update or one related to chrome itself.\nWhat I believe you are trying to do is force chrome to use native notifications throughout. Try this:\nIn your search bar input this: chrome://flags/#enable-native-notifications. Set this to enable. \nThen, under Setting > Notifications set both the Google Chrome apps to Alerts.\nI hope this works.\n", "Q: Terminal name changed to 'Name@dhcp-xx-x' I have no idea what dhcp means, so I don't know why instead of just showing 'Name ~' as the beginning of each terminal line, it started showing 'Name@dhcp-xx-x' as the format of my username. Is this a virus or did I just accidentally change this? How do I undo it?\n\nA: It is not a virus, nor did you actually change it yourself.\nThe prompt by default begins with the hostname of your computer. The host name is found by doing a so called \"reverse lookup\" in DNS of the IP address of your computer.\nEvery time you connect to a network, you'll get an IP address. The provider of that IP usually determines what the reverse lookup will say. Usually it is your internet provider.\nYour ISP has thus chosen \"dhcp-xx-x\" as the hostname. It probably has some internal meaning to them.\nDHCP is the name of a protocol used on networks to automatically deliver IP-addresses (and other configurations) to computers. Seeing this in your hostname typically means that your ISP used DHCP to deliver the IP and accompanying configuration to your computer.\n", "Q: Safari 12 Mac: does IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1 still work?

I am developing an app and I am highly in need of location services and without that my app is not working. Can I block users from using my app (showing a page to them) until they go to settings and give me needed permission?\n\nA: Technically it is no problem to \"block\" the user by for example showing a page with instructions to give permissions for location services to proceed.\nLegally, it is not so simple. You should read through Apple's App Store Review Guidelines for detailed instructions.\nEspecially they point out that the developer must not arbitrarily block the user from using the app, if they haven't given permissions for locations for example. If at all possible, the app should allow the user to use the app without giving the permission - for example by entering an address or position manually. However, if the entire purpose of the app is defeated by not having access to location services, then it is okay to tell the user that the app is not usable until permission is given.\nNote however that it is not permitted to restrict access to the app based on the actual location. I.e. you cannot make an app that works in Washington, but automatically shuts down when in Houston.\n", "Q: Is Safari on iPad and iPhone identical?

Just check out the user interface - they are definitely not identical.\nBesides, there's obvious differences in for example screen size, resolution, CPU speed and RAM.\nIf you haven't got an iPhone to test with you could download Xcode from Apple and use the iPhone simulator to test your web sites with.\n\nA: It does change rendering.

Google calendar event notification can cause Apple Mail app open.  \n\nA: I found this answer on Apple Community website useful. It also works to my situation. I think the reason is the Mail app does not support 2-step authentication well. So don't use the Gmail portal to connect your Gmail, but generate an app password from Google website and manually set up your Gmail using the normal email portal in the Mail app. \n\nA: I deal with this is by \"quitting\" Mail with ⌘-H.\nThat hides mail, but keeps it active in the background. If you reopen mail, it starts up exactly the way you hid it before.\n\nA: I have the same issue: \nThe google calendar stuff is nonsense. The notification settings suggestion doesn't work.\nI've narrowed it down to the following:\nI normally hit the red cross button on the viewer window once I have finished looking at my mail, this closes open viewer windows but leaves the mail app active in the dock:\nSo if I have mail running, but no viewer windows open, then I get a viewer window randomly popping up to the foreground a few times an hour. \nIf instead of hitting the red cross button, I minimise mail using the minus button, then I don't get any viewer windows randomly opening. In this scenario, the mail viewer window is minimised either on the right hand side of the dock or into the application icon itself, depending on your settings (System Preferences > Dock > \"Minimize windows into application icon\").\nSo I have changed my habits to work around this annoying bug...\n\nA: I have solved this problem by removing my Google account in Mail and making my Google Gmail address a normal (IMAP) account. Since then no more pop-ups.\n\nA: My experience with Mail has been that it activates itself and windows in the background every time it has a problem connecting to one of its mail services. You can tell this by seeing the \"lightning bolt\" connectivity icon show up in the Mailboxes sidebar.\nThis user-hostile behavior seems to have no option to disable it and it doesn't seem to matter if the app is hidden or minimized. Apparently someone at Apple thinks it is so important that you know that one of your mail servers was temporarily unreachable that it requires interrupting whatever else you were working on to tell you. There may be some hidden settings in the prefs plist for Mail, but I've never taken the time to poke through it.\n\nA: *\n\n*Mail > Preferences > General, uncheck:\n\"Prefer opening messages in split view when in full screen.\"\n\n\n*If you need real time notifications, best is to give the Mail app its own desktop in one corner. I've been doing it for several weeks and got no issues. You can also put some more background apps there: music ?\n\n\n*⌘-W and ⌘-Q are your friends.\nMaybe try to get in the habit of closing Mail when watching a movie? It'll save you this hassle, a little battery life, and I promise, your mail will still be there when your movie is over. :)\n\n\n*Maybe try a different mail app? The thing is, Mail.app has been a really wonky program since time immemorial. Its one of a handful of apps that has never once got a full rewrite (along with the likes of Grapher and Activity Monitor). So I wouldn't hold your breath for a fix for these mysterious stirrings. So, if you're someone who really prefers a good desktop email client, you might want to look at a program like Unibox (super slick, ~$15, and/or available through Setapp). Outlook 2019 isn't too bad either, although it is still Microsoft Outlook, so there's \"a lot there\".\n\nA: This issue is resolved in macOS Big Sur to the best of my knowledge. Updating is the best way to resolve the issue, as most of the other options listed here are just workarounds.\n\nA: I was hoping that with Catalina the problem would be solved, instead here I am.\nLooking for a solution I tried to activate the logging of the connection status (from Mail menu: Windows -> Connection Status).\nExamining the log when the Mail app is popping up, I found out these error messages at the exactly same time and on every occurrence of the problem (when the app doesn't pop up the error messages don't show up):\nREAD Oct 10 20:41:21.323 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_2] -- host:imap.gmail.com -- port:993 -- socket:0x6000003b7de0 -- thread:0x60000322d080\n5.659 NO [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Invalid credentials (Failure)\n--\nREAD Oct 10 20:41:21.427 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_2] -- host:imap.gmail.com -- port:993 -- socket:0x6000003b7de0 -- thread:0x60000322d080\n6.659 BAD Invalid SASL argument. z66mb54202756wmc\n--\nREAD Oct 10 20:41:21.732 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_2] -- host:imap.gmail.com -- port:993 -- socket:0x6000003b7de0 -- thread:0x60000322d080\n7.659 NO [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Invalid credentials (Failure)\n\n(Just posting the lines containing the errors)\nThe error messages are present only on the log file of my Gmail account, every other mail account doesn't show any error message. \nSo as many of you, I also think that the problem is due to the Gmail accounts.\nHope this can help to solve the problem in any meaningful way. \n\nA: *\n\n*Reason\n\n\nthe reason seems to be this link\n\n\n*Solution\n\n\nI tried everything out.

Rather, I want DNS resolution to happen between me and my ISP (or between me and 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8) and then if resolution fails, to consult with the VPN.\nHow do I update the resolver to use Cloudflare/Google first for DNS, using the command line on Mac?\n\nA: I have a similar situation where I have to use a very heavy-handed captive portal Wi-Fi connection with a very heavy-handed, very creepy virtual firewall. Not only does snoop on secure connections, it impersonates DNS server IPs, using DPI (when it detects the request).\nThe only thing that works for me is to go over the top of the VPN/firewall rather than try to sneak under it, using dnscrypt-proxy using only DNS-over-HTTPS, as it can detect the dnscrypt protocol. Right now, its not aware of DNS-over-HTTPS at all.\nI implement it using a LaunchAgent that watches /etc/resolve.conf for changes, and when it detects a change, it restarts dnscrypt-proxy, then runs networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 127.0.0.1.\nAside: I've been using Quad9 for a while now, and much prefer it to Google and CloudFlare.\nEdit: After playing a bit more with this, I'm noticing that (somehow, I haven't even figured out where the traffic is to/from), IPv6 addresses are somehow resolved with ::1 as a DNS server, even if there are no other DNS servers set. So probably better to just disable IPv6 if you can.\n\nEdit 2:\nYeah, I think being able to split out that route might be just too much to do with the newer system-level VPN implementation; I think DNS proxying is probably your best bet. It might be possible to remove ipsec0 as the default route and then add it back for a restricted IP range... but every time I try this (with IKEv2, not AnyConnect, but I'm assuming they're using the same API) it just... stops.\nAs for the residual traffic, maybe its Rendezvous? sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder; sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist?\nAlso, perhaps you might be able to use an app like Shimo? It's available with Setapp! I don't know exactly how AnyConnect works, but it says it supports it, and it has configuration options available that are exactly what you are looking for for other protocols, including IKE, so... maybe?\n\n\nA: The short answer is you likely cannot make this change.\nThis is a very typical situation where the managed settings disallow a split VPN tunnel situation. Literally, when you connect to the VPN gateway - it ensures you can no longer reach any network destination except for the DNS and settings that are on the other end network of where the VPN terminates.\nTo fix this, you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*change your VPN configuration to allow a split tunnel - possibly needing the network administrators to bless this change / make it effective.\n\n*Not engage the VPN at all\n\n*Set up a virtual machine so that you can maintain control of your OS and only allow the guest OS to connect to the VPN\n\n*convince the network admin to change the DNS at the other end to meet your needs (secondary a DNS setting you have before you connect to VPN, change the forwarders, etc..)\n\n*use a different client or client setting to avoid the profile you run in Cisco (assuming the cisco won't let you change the configuration) - Force DNS server ip while connected to VPN\n(this is a common question that never gets an answer other than - don't use VPN, but I hope there is a way for you)\n\n\n*\n\n*How to override DNS resolver ordering while connected to L2TP VPN\n\n*yosemite DNS resolution woes over IPSec tunnels / VPN\n\n*Force DNS server ip while connected to VPN\n\n*Mac OS X Mountain Lion - DNS resolving uses wrong order on VPN via dial-up connection\n\nA: Your VPN client is registering its DNS state with scutil, and you can use the same tool to change the DNS to what you want.\nTo list the currently registered DNS states:\nscutil <<< list | awk '{ print $4 }' | egrep '^State:/.+/DNS$'\n\nI don't know how to register your own state and make it override the others, but you can modify all of the registered states to reflect your preferred DNS server, easily:\nmydns=1.1.1.1\nstates=$(scutil <<< list | awk '{ print $4 }' | egrep '^State:.+/DNS$')\nfor state in $states ; do\n  printf \"d.init\\nd.add ServerAddresses * ${mydns}\\nset ${state}\\nquit\\n\" | scutil\ndone\n\nThis code runs through the list of registered states, and for each one, overwrites it with a new one that just contains your DNS server of choice.

Apple Developer Program Information says:\n\nA Development Provisioning Profile must be installed on each device on\nwhich you wish to run your application code.\nEach Development\nProvisioning Profile will contain a set of iPhone Development\nCertificates, Unique Device Identifiers and an App ID.\n\nSo where are provisioning profiles in my iPhone XS?\nCan I see them?\nCan I download them?\nCan I beam them to any other device via bluetooth? airdrop? email?\n\nA: The link you've included in your question doesn't in fact contain that quote.\nThe easiest way to manage the provisioning profiles on the iPhone is to open Xcode and select the menu item \"Devices and Simulators\" in the Window menu. Right-click on your iPhone XS and select \"Show provisioning profiles\".\nYou'll then be able to see the installed profiles, add new ones and delete existing profiles.\nYou cannot download a provisioning profile from the device, nor can you \"beam\" an installed provisioning profile. However, you can just copy the provisioning profile to the device (or store it on iCloud Drive) as an ordinary file (i.e. without actually installing it) - that file can then easily be transferred using AirDrop, email or whatever.\nOn the actual device you will in some instances also have a menu in Settings - General - Device Management that will list the installed profiles.\n", "Q: Help me crash my Mac -- beyond stress tests My MacBook Pro has been crashing for months, at least once a day most days.\nI blame it on overheating seeing as it reached 100°C on several occasions when it shut down.\nLast time I took it to a repair shop, they were not able to reproduce the issue. They showed me some tests they ran that showed the laptop ran successfully for hours, despite the heavy number-crunching.\nIt seems to crash at random, e.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*With only four tabs open in Firefox… I close one of them and the laptop shuts down! (Happens very often when I would close a tab.)\n\n*While, on the contrary, with 10 YouTube videos open playing at the same time, and prime95 (a number-crunching program) running, the ventilation would be loud for sure, but the laptop would not crash.\n\n\nHence the question:\nHow can I cause the laptop to overheat on demand?\nAny ideas of things to run?\nI'd like to stress the different components. This would help me or a repair shop diagnose the issue.\n\nOptional. More details for those interested.\n\n\n*\n\n*The laptop is a MacBook Pro 15\" from 2014.\n\n*I had a battery issue: macOS said the battery needed to be replaced. So I went to a shop (in Hungary) and got the battery replaced. In passing, I asked them to clean it up (dust + new thermal paste.)\n\n*…the overheating problems started then. I took it back to the shop, but they could not get it to crash. They said it might be a software issue, which left me a bit dubious.\n\n*Cmd-Option-P-R did not help.\n\n*I finally reinstalled macOS (clean reinstall, formatted the drive, installed Mojave), and no difference.\n\n*Running Apple Diagnostic (holding D on reboot) did not help (zero issue detected.)  \n\n*It usually crashes in the evening… (I don't think it ever crashed in the morning), as if the heat sort of accumulated.\n\n*I have dual boot with Windows (thanks to Bootcamp.) I can play GTA V or Fallout 3 in it and it will NOT crash.\n\n\nThanks a bunch for the help.\nI help \n\nEDIT 1:\nI brought it to another repair shop. They did not manage to make it crash either and were unable to find any issue with the laptop. They tested the RAM with some gear and it's fine. They ran a lot of tests and didn't find anything, so they're at a bit of a loss to help.\nThey suggested recording my next crash with a video camera to help them see what I was doing and spot the issue.\n(They have a rating of 4.8 with over a thousand votes, and the previous shop had a rating of 4.9 with over a hundred votes.)\nI've just spent 55 min running a lot of things on the laptop… Downloading huge files, running simultaneous connection tests, running RAM tests, CPU crunching programs, lots of YouTube videos open in two browsers… Copying files over the local wifi network… Running a graphics test… Running browser stress tests… All at once! And the temperature reached 97-99° a couple of times before going back down…\nYet I know it's gonna crash again at some point.\nHow am I supposed to diagnose an issue when I cannot trigger it on demand? Ideas/links welcome.\n\nEDIT 2:\nThis is not an exact duplicate.\nI tried stressing my Mac… (and the other thread, How to stress a MacBook Pro Retina did prove informative), but the issue is apparently not due to the load on the machine alone.\ne.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stress load type 1: running Heaven + Prime95 + dozens of videos open in two browsers.\n\n*Stress load type 2: converting many videos at the same time with ffmpeg, for 50 min.\n\n\n…and no crash.\nWhile the Mac did crash (freeze for a few seconds then shutdown) during some basic operations. e.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*Browsing the Web with just 4 tabs open;\n\n*Editing a small text file in Sublime;\n\n*Watching two episodes of a sitcom in VLC just fine, but then the laptop crashed when I quit VLC.\n\n\nSo stressing is not enough to make it crash.\nIt seems random, though it seems to crash more often when the system is \"unloading\" stuff. e.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*Crashed once while I was closing a tab in the Terminal during an ffmpeg stress test;\n\n*Crashed not during the ffmpeg stress test, but once I quit the Terminal;\n\n*Crashed while I was closing a tab in Firefox (many, many times.)\n\n\n…but this is just what happened at times, I cannot repeat the crash on demand and most stress tests turned out fine.\nThis is turning into a bit of a long-winded post. I'll update if/once I get more clarity.\n\nEDIT 3:\nI finally figured the issue.\nThis is the so called \"macbook random shutdown syndrome\", there's even a petition about it.\nDisabling the Thunderbolt driver clearly fixed it for me, as per this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/310048/93837\nA brief timeline:\nAfter 5 months of daily crashes…\n\n\n*\n\n*2018-12-12: the shop replaced the battery, but it still crashes randomly.\n\n*2018-12-13: I disabled the Thunderbolt driver.\n\n*2018-12-27: crashed again, for the first time in 14 days, which is a huge improvement. Turns out the latest macOS update re-enabled the Thunderbolt driver. Re-disabled it.\n\n\nA: I don't suggest this but you could use macs fan control to slow down select fans to cause overheating of certain components. I'd recommend using TG-Pro from Tunabelly Software. It allows you to control various fans speed and monitor the temperature while you do it.\n\nA: They make cooling bases to set these things on.\nThat is a bad sign.\nI'd buy a 16X16\" chunk of aluminum, as fat as you can find, to give your mac a proper heat sink.\nOpening the mac up and blowing out dust that's accumulated in there can also help. If it's got one of those centrifugal cooling fans, blow in it to make it spin both ways. Stuff like cat-hair gets stuck on the fan blades. It comes off easily if you spin the fan in reverse of the normal direction.\n", "Q: What's the MacOS equivalent for Ctrl+Shift+V?

If I have it run from \n/users/'my name'/desktop/etc.\nthen it won't work when I use it on a different computer, because the user name will be different. Is there any way to run it directly without going through the user directory?\n\nA: The AppleScript command I think you're looking for is:\n(path to Desktop Folder) as text\n\nor\n(path to Desktop Folder)\n\nBut that would return an HFS path and the code you posted is a POSIX Path so you could change it to:\nset homePath to POSIX path of (path to Desktop Folder) as text\n\nAs stated in the comment there is $USER for the terminal and per memory you can still call it in AppleScript with something like: \ndo shell script \"$USER\"\n\nIf path to desktop folder doesn't work you can try just path to desktop.\n\nEdit\nAddressing the comment. I was taught HFS path and alias path were the same, will make it another question for clarity. \nBuilding the path as text is a habit when concat strings or if I was going to take the path and call it later in a do shell. For example:\n(path to desktop folder)\n\nin Script Debugger returns an HFS path. When you combine a directory as it was shown in the OP's question a compiling error occurs with:\n(path to desktop folder & \"foobar:\")\n\nand a\n(path to desktop folder) & \"foobar:\"\n\nwhen I've called paths using path to I've had to write them as:\n(path to desktop folder as text) & \"foobar:\"\n\nI was unfamiliar to short user name of (system info) and path to home folder but that's good to know. One issue with the question is the OP marks it with terminal and AppleScript so the solution is somewhat complicated.\n\nA: This will detect what is the username with which you/script have/has logged in and changes to that directory. you can pre-pend it to your script:\n     user=`whoami`        \n     cd \"/Users/$user\"\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Tor Browser on iPad?

The only place to download/install/buy applications for iOS devices is the App Store which is itself an app on your iPad.\nIf you want a good Tor Browser on your iPad I use one called \"Onion Browser\" that seems to do the trick.

I connected to my employer's Exchange server in order to receive email, calendar, etc...  In the small print of the instructions, it was mentioned that by doing that, the administrators gain the right to remotely wipe my phone.  Note that I own the phone - not the employer.\nThere are several documents on the internet that provide instructions (while not mentioning iPhone specifically, but rather generic \"phone\").\nIs remote wipe actually possible with an iPhone just by connecting to an employer's Exchange server?\n\nA: Yes, depending on how things are configured, your employer may be able to wipe your device. The ability to wipe only the Exchange account data was added later as an optional wipe mode.\nFrom another TechNet article:\n\nYour users carry sensitive corporate information in their pockets every day. If one of them loses their mobile phone, your data can end up in the hands of another person. If one of your users loses their mobile phone, you can use the Exchange admin center (EAC) or the Exchange Management Shell to wipe their phone clean of all corporate and user information. (emphasis added)\n\nIn other words, the phone is not \"completely erased\" -- but all user data is destroyed. I believe this is accomplished on iOS by throwing away the encryption key. The operating system remains, but all user data is gone.\nFor example:\n\nIn June of 2016 Microsoft announced an update to the Exchange ActiveSync protocol which they called EAS 16.1. Among the improvements in EAS 16.1 was the addition of account-only remote wipes, which allows an administrator to issue a remote wipe for only the Exchange mailbox data on a mobile device. Previously, a remote wipe for an ActiveSync device would wipe the entire device if the user was using a native mail application to connect from the device.\n\n\nA: In most cases, the answer is yes. The iOS device running iOS 10+ can be completely erased if a corporate exchange account resides on the device.\nIn the latest version of 2016 Exchange Server on-premises, by default, there are 2 versions of remote wipe that can take place. The first only removes the exchange account, and the second is a complete wipe; meaning complete wipe functions exactly like using the built in iOS settings, general, \"erase all content and settings\" function. \nThere is no prompt on the exchange admin end to enter any Apple ID password, nor passcode... \nIf you're allowing your personal iOS device to connect to your company's Exchange Services, please read the use agreement careful before you sign.\nIf you keep local backups in iTunes, you will be able to restore your iOS from a backup.\nI just initiated a test of remote wipe as of this writing, so this info is timely. \n", "Q: Cannot restore iTunes backup - not enough space! I am trying to restore an iTunes backup of my daughter's iPhone SE that was made via iTunes on a Mac. \nThe Mac runs macOS 10.14.1 and iPhone is running iOS 12.1\nWhen I click \"Restore Backup\" it starts a progress bar, counts down for about five minutes and then says \"Not enough space on iPhone\".\nThis seems bizarre to me - surely the backup is some sort of snapshot of the contents of the exact same phone, so how can it now be too large to fit back into the phone?\nApple Support simply suggest Restore iPhone (i.e. erase everything) and hope that the backup works then - obviously since the backup has already failed, I am reluctant to double down on it.\nIs there any way to find out how much extra space is actually needed?\n\nA: You could back the device up to iCloud or another Mac if you suspect the current backup isn’t good. If you’re willing to forego that extra safety, net then the first thing is to erase all content and settings to see how much space is free. \nTry the restore again and then optionally restore the device.  I’ve seen this happen on rare occasion - especially on iOS devices with the smaller flags storage if they’ve been updated over the air a few times. It also could be a sign the storage on the device has started to fail. When SSD fail, they just mark blocks as bad and you get less free space than normal. \nYou could also make an iCloud backup, omitting some of the apps you don’t need to back up so that the payload is less size. Tap through the settings app and iCloud and manage storage and the device in question. Then turn off the largest items you don’t need (not shown below the content is the apps in CHOOSE DATA TO BACKUP)\n\nJust turn off some and make a second backup in case you need a smaller iCloud backup to restore as a last resort.\n", "Q: How to start homebrew Apache on boot?

I currently own the same printer that I have been printing from my MacBook Pro. The older printer is going to be donated. \nDo I have to uninstall the original printer's software and install software for the new printer? \nThe new printer is the same model. \n\nA: The short answer to this question is no, there is no need to reinstall the software. If its the same printer and the same model, the existing software will work perfectly well. \nThe longer answer is maybe. I am not familiar with the Epson software itself but if there is an autoupdate feature you should be perfectly fine . Should there not be, I would, personally, reinstall the new software to include the latest updates.\nIf you have any doubt, reinstall the software just to be sure. \n", "Q: Books automatically deletes my books when offline, and when there is enough space on device There is something strange going on with Books on iPad and iPhone. It keeps deleting some books locally, keeping them in the cloud.\nIt's frustrating because it happens when I'm offline and I simply lose the access to them.\nWhy is this happening at all? And how can I stop it?\nI enabled syncing things over iCloud Drive and everything, but I can't see an option to disable such optimizations.\n\nPS: the same thing happens with Photos, Numbers and Pages. The Photos app has an optimize storage option. But there doesn’t seem to be such an option for Books, Numbers and Pages. \nA clear example: just a few hours I was reading a book on Books, I took a nap, and when I opened the Books app, the book was not available offline anymore. Since I don’t have internet right now, it’s simply impossible to access the document.\n\nA: I feel you. I've never been able to figure this out, and it is so frustrating. This might not be the answer you're looking for, however, I've migrated away from using iBooks and using iCloud for syncing anything besides things like the keychain and settings.\nSince you mentioned you were reading a pdf ebook, I recommend an app called Bluefire Reader. It does ePub, PDF, and Adobe DRM. Of course, if you have a bunch of ebooks you've bought from Apple, well, that's another thing; DeDRM does exist, but that's really all I can say on that.\n\nA: Try disabling iCloud for Books. \nNote: Make sure you have your books saved so they do not get deleted.\nHere's how:\nGo to settings.\nTap on your Apple ID at the top:\n\nThen click on iCloud:\n\nThen turn off the switch for books:\n\nFor your photos you can turn optimise iPhone storage off in photo settings:\n\n\nA: I second trying to disable iCloud for Books and see what the result is.  \nAs for the photos on your iPad, sounds like you have 'Optimize iPad Storage' turned on for Photos under iCloud settings.  If you go into settings>Apple ID>iCloud>Photos then select download and keep originals it should fix the issue with your photos.  If you have the 'Optimize iPad Storage' option selected your device will keep a smaller resolution copy of the picture and attempt to download the full resolution picture when you access it through the Photos App or elsewhere.  Here is Apple's article with the steps I described: Manage your photo and video storage\n\nA: To answer your question: seems to be intended as is expressed in iPad/iPhone Users Guide, iOS version 11.4. An excerpt in the picture below (yellow highlighting is mine):\n\nThis good description is now almost vanished in the recent version (not as explicit as this one).\nAs for storing locally, on the iPad, you may watch/compute/verify as follows:\n1) Verify a book download: Go to Settings -> General -> iPad Storage -> Books and click to the right and see two items, there, Documents & Data and dully note the size of these.\n2) Add a new book: (download a new one) and check/verify/note the new size as in previous point.\nNote the size should be >0; if equal zero could be something else wrong.\n3) Turn off the wifi from Settings -> Wifi\n4) Verify again the size as in 2) Should be the same.\n5) Open the Books and manage your download. See the picture below:\n\nNow, please observe three dots to the right and under the book icon. Click on them and choose what to do with the book: add to Collections.\n6) Also in Books: Click on Library icon on the lowest row of the display. This will open the Collections page. Click/tap on Collections word and choose from the pop-down listing. You should have a menu item Downloaded where all downloaded books should take place. \n7) Verify the iCloud storage occupied by your books: in Settings -> [your name] -> iCloud -> Manage Storage -> Apple Books -> Documents & Data. You may have more than a single item Apple Books. \nIf the size here is smaller or equal than the size found in 4) for sure you have booked stored locally.\nNote the size may vary, after some time some books will be reloaded to iCloud if no activity on them.\n\nA: Solution is simple: just turn off the automatic apps offload. I don't know the reason for this, but before I did this books which I was currently reading got deleted EVERY morning. Sometimes even couple of times a day. It's been 3 days since I had disabled \"Offload Unused Apps\" and my books weren't deleted even once.\nGo to Setting > iTunes & App Stores > disable \"Offload Unused Apps\" > Reboot device just in case\n\nA: I have the exact same issue with my ipad, os version 12.4.4 very frustrating.\nTried everything suggested above and some more, nothing helps. Even worse, I just experienced the same issue with the Kindle app so it might be a more general problem related to how the os manages/optimizes local content storage (I have 5gb+ storage left so it’s a bug, not a feature if this is the issue)\n\n\n*\n\n*Solution: if you turn off syncing in Books it keeps the local copy for me but it won’t sync of course :)\n\n*Solution (what I settled on for the long run): Dropbox to sync + Acrobat for pdfs / Marvin3 for epub, etc. to read. \n\n\n*\n\n*Have to export/import a copy between the apps to keep and sync notes, highlights, etc once I finished reading or if I want to continue on another device (acrobat can do this automatically I think if you give them access to your dropbox, but a) that’s just another potential source of frustrating bugs and I need a robust solution and b) i don’t want to give them access). \n\n*I keep a large offline library on my device in dropbox and store what I am reading at the moment locally in the reader apps also (they do this automatically). Don’t think you need to store content offline in dropbox for this to work (and thus pay for that feature), but I do it anyway as I want access to all my library everywhere without internet. But you could just use the readers’ local storage to have at hand a few dozen books.\n\n*I don’t turn on cloud sync in either of the reading apps as it’s error prone and I need a robust solution to not end up without books on a flight/train and to make sure my annotations sync also.\n\n\n\nSolution 2 seems very robust, and probably won’t ever have issues as these apps do one thing but they do that well. I tried other sync solutions and like a dozen different readers, but all have issues (e.g. export/import pdfs between Apple Books and dropbox: Books adds every time a few MB to the book size.. And other issues)\nGood luck!\n\nA: Turn off 'Reading now'. Settings > Books and then under the syncing sub-head turn off 'Reading now'. This definitely works for me now.\n\nA: Find the book that you don't want to be removed from your device and tap on the three dots to the lower right of the image. Then select 'Save to files'. Works for me.\n\nA: sorry that this will be a bit lengthy, but I want to point out the things I also have tried, and I may have a solution! Turning off iCloud syncing in the IOS settings or in the desktop OS settings both stop me from getting access to the Books on my iPad or iPhone. I also have my books required to be uploaded every time I restart my iPad, or even if I turn off Books  or just come back a couple of hours later:  note that it neither works if I turn off the sinking in the iCloud settings or in the Books settings. This is definitely a programming flaw, but someone’s comment above reminded me of the “Optimize Mac storage “button that is on your OS iCloud settings page (System Preferences/Apple ID).\n as it claims that it will download documents to your desktop to save space in iCloud, I decided to see if it also downloaded to my iOS devices to save space, which it does! So this is without turning off syncing, either on your desktop OS or your IOS device, and as long as you have space on your IOS device it will download the documents to that device. The trick is obviously to make sure you have space! \nI hope this alleviates your problem, and thanks to all the above responses which guided me to this solution.\nCarey\n\nA: user310476's answer worked for me, but with extra steps.\nI have most of my books in iCloud and I read them in the Books app. Steps to prevent books from offloading:\n\n*\n\n*Disable access to iCloud for the Books app in the Settings. This will delete all the books in Books, so save them elsewhere.\n\n\n*Open every book you want to read in Books. .epub files will open there automatically, but for PDFs you need to\n\n*\n\n*open context menu for the file, Share -> ... More -> Books. This will open the file in the Books, but if you exit now, it won't be saved.\n\n*To save it, press the share button in the Books with your PDF open. Share -> Copy to Books. This will save your PDF inside the Books app.\n\n\n\n\nA: I am trying another PDF reader called “Xodo”.\nI just copied my PDF from eBooks to Xodo.\nI guess eBooks, being the “official app”, respects digital rights much stricter than other apps.\nI think digital rights is a good thing, but I still have too many PDFs that are of dubious origin…\nHope this helps other readers, and personally I am striving to be a more responsible reader.\nPS: Xodo has even better annotation functions than eBooks!\n\nA: Guys I think I might have found the solution without turning off Icloud sync.\nFirst; Go to \"settings > books\" and turn off \"background app refresh\".\nThen ; Download all the books on wifi. You should download them one by one clicking each. A little bit frustrating but worths it.\nNow, even if I close the app, turn off the mobile or so on, my books are ready for me on Books app, even without the internet.\nHope it helps.\n..\nAnd one final note: Still, Apple should have a look on the issue why Books app can not download on LTE/cellular internet.\n", "Q: How to remove shared devices from my iMac? My Sidebar is showing that there is a shared device on my network. I am not on any network whatsoever, this is my home computer used by me only. It says \"not connected\" but makes me nervous. \nIs this a hack of some kind? How do I get rid of it? I tried dragging it to the trash and it didn't work.\n\n\nA: Firstly, shared devices that appear in the Sidebar are:\n\n\n*\n\n*other devices you have at home that are connected to the same network as your Mac.\n\n*other computers signed into your iCloud account. \n\n\nAnd a network doesn't mean you have to have multiple computers or that you're somewhere other than home. \nFor example, most times users come across an unknown shared device in their Sidebar it's because it belongs to a printer that is also connected to the same Wi-Fi network as their Mac is. That is, if you have a single Mac at home connected to Wi-Fi, then that Mac is connected to a network. \nWithout knowing your setup at home I can't comment on what the shared device is, but it could be any device that's connected to the same Wi-Fi network (assuming you're using Wi-Fi), or any device connected to the same internet connection at home. So it could be a printer, a smart TV, a weather station, etc.\nSo, if you're concerned that there's some sort of dodgy device trying to connect to your Mac, that's almost certainly not the case.\nIf your main concern is that you just don't want to see Shared items, then you can hid these as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Go to Finder > Preferences...\n\n*Select the Sidebar icon in the toolbar \n\n*Modify your settings under the Shared section\n\n*Exit Preferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing 'shared' section in Finder programmatically\n", "Q: How can I disable the red Software Update notification bubble on the System Preferences app in MacOS Mojave (not App Store)? I keep the \"System Preferences\" app icon in my dock in Mojave. I recently checked for updates, and found one, but I'm not ready to install it just yet and the red notification dot over the settings app is really bothering my obsessive-compulsive self.\nTo make things worse, there's no way to disable the notification for the settings app, from the settings app.\nHow can I banish the notification icon until I'm ready to deal with doing updates?\n(Note: this a the red notification badge/dot over the System Preferences app, not the App Store one. It is also not the big textual one that will appear in the upper right corner of the screen. And, unlike all the other questions I found while searching for this, I am in Mac OS rather than iOS.)\nThe closest thing I found was Why is the System Preferences Dock icon showing a Badge?, which was about iCloud security problems rather than software updates. My question isn't why, but how to ignore a software update for a while.\n\n\nA: It's not the red dot itself that bugs me, it's that I'm still on Mojave, not yet ready to go to Big Sur, and don't want that reminder in my face all the time. I want syspref in the dock and running. Similarly, I always have a Terminal window open. I put the command in a file where I wanted it, named it, and updated my path. When I get the occasional red dot, I can hit the terminal window, enter \"badge\" and that is that. Elegant?...maybe not so much, but works for me.\n#!/bin/bash  \ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences AttentionPrefBundleIDs 0  \nkillall Dock\n\n\nA: Here is what worked for me to get rid of the red notification ballon and still have access to System Preferences from the dock.\nReplace the Systems Preferences icon on the dock with its Alias:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove System Preferences icon from dock (either drag icon off dock or right-click on it and choose \"Options\" and then \"Remove from Dock\").\n\n*In a Finder window navigate to the Applications folder, right-click on the Systems Preferences app and choose \"Make Alias\".\n\n*Add the alias file to the dock by dragging it to the desired location on the dock.\nThe alias icon does not include the red notification bubble.   The Systems Preference panel will still show the red notification on the Software Update icon (as shown in the partial screen shot image).\n\n\nA: I found that the killall Dock solution didn't work (anytime I restarted my computer I had to run the code in Terminal again), and the Alias solution left me wanting to really figure out how to do this!\nSo, with some searching, here is how I've permanently handled this issue (without the need to run code in Terminal): \n\n\n*\n\n*Open system preferences\n\n*Open software update\n\n*Click \"advanced...\" (bottom right)\n\n*Unclick \"check for updates\"\n\n*Command + Q system preferences.\n\n*Turn off internet.\n\n*Reopen system preferences.\n\n*Reopen software update.\n\n\nTa da!

Running:\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences AttentionPrefBundleIDs 0\n\nfixed my issue for now on 10.14.1 (Apparently, you may also have to restart the dock with killall Dock, but I don't remember having to do so).\nIt seems to work up through at least Monterey (12), too.\nIf you have automatic checking for updates turned on, this might not work for you. Not for long, anyway. In my case, on a fresh install, I went to the settings page to turn off checking for updates, at which time it checked for an update before I could close the page. After running that command again it went away once more, though. Basically, turn off automatic update checks, or it'll come right back and you'll have to run the command again.\nRe-running the update checker should undo this. One might be able to find that .plist (I believe it was in /Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist) and set the immutable bit on it/give it read only permissions to prevent it getting modified, but I have no idea what the fallout from that could be. You'd probably not be able to change any other per-user settings anymore.\n\nEdit: Some have suggested setting it like:\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences AttentionPrefBundleIDs '{ \"com.apple.preferences.softwareupdate\" = 0; }'\n\ninstead. This seems to work, and is the default value on a fresh install, at least for some newer versions - but it is also more difficult to type and ultimately has the same impact, so I still just use the top version and have noticed no ill effects.\n", "Q: Is the only way to update password stored in Keychain, to delete the old/existing stored password & re-add its new \"update\"? If the only way to update a password stored in Keychain, is to delete its old/existing stored password & re-add its new update, then steps like this show how.\nBut I'm curious if there is a way to update without first deleting the old stored password first?  That is the case for most website/webapp passwords for example.  The extra step of deleting first in Keychain isn't a big deal, but it would be useful to know if that's truly the only way, or if instead I am missing something?\n*Note:  I am NOT asking how to update the password to Keychain itself, but instead rather I'm asking about passwords stored IN Keychain.\n\nA: I can’t test as I’m on my phone & don’t think I’ve ever tried on a network password, but for a web password you can simply open the item, reveal the existing pass, type a new one & save. \n", "Q: trouble installing cmake I need to install cmake for school.  I have tried using the source code but don't really understand where I should unpack it and how to add it to my path.  I also tried the .dmg file but the command cmake is not recognized after I dragged it to the applications folder. I have mac osx version 10.14.  I am a novice at this, any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: For cmake the easiest way is to install the GUI from the .dmg - which you already have done.\nFor other users. To install the GUI mount the .dmg and then copy Cmake.app to /Applications (a link to that  is in the disk)\nYou can run the build from the GUI which asks for the source and target paths and the type of build system to be generated.\nOr you can install the command line tools. Choose from the menu in the GUI  Tools->How to install for command line use. This provides instructions on what to do. These are basically telling you where the cmake executable is so that you can add that directory to your PATH\nI do use the GUI as it allows easier control of where things are and which build system to generate.\n\nA: An easy way to install cmake is to use a tool like https://brew.sh\nOnce you have homebrew set up, getting the cmake tool installed on Mojave (and all other recent versions of macos) is as simple as one command:\n brew install cmake\n\nEven for expert command line software installs, this tool is super useful.

I noticed that the WiFi noise level jumps from -95 dBm to -75 dBm after I plug in the DisplayPort cable. I tried several different WiFi channels (1, 6, 11) and there is no significant difference between them, so it's some sort of broadband noise. Since the SNR is so low, the MCS index is set at 0.\nThe other annoying thing is, once MCS is set to 0, even after I unplug the DisplayPort cable and the noise level drops back to -95 dBm, the MCS is still stuck at 0 and my WiFi speed will not recover. Even turning WiFi off and on again won't help. But this is a secondary issue. My main problem is why display port will introduce such strong noise which kills my WiFi speed in the first place. \nThe cable I use is a Monoprice mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable. \n\n\nUPDATE\nI got a new mini-DP to DP cable and this time the noise level dropped to the normal level of -95 dBm. However, the MCS is still at 0?? The WiFi speed increased to 20+ Mbps but still not where it should be. \n\n\nA: Turn off the Wi-Fi Direct function on your LG 4K monitor if it does have one (check the LG documentation) and you will be able to recover a Wi-Fi network working.\nIf your cable isn't a shielded one (this should be written explicitly on its packaging) or doesn't have a ferrite core , just replace it. Sooner than later you will have interferences on your image displayed and on all use of radio frequency within a few meters.\nAnother way to workaround this huge noise level could be to switch your MacBook Pro on a 5 GHz network = channel above or equal 40. This configuration has to be done on your equipment building your Wi-Fi network. This is your Belkin wireless router. But this won't fix the origin of the problem.\n", "Q: The account does not exist in bugreport.apple.com I am about to file a bug, but I can not login...\nWhen I open the url https://bugreport.apple.com, It asks me to login.

Does Thunderbolt 1 provide USB (3.0) functionality? Or in other words: Is Thunderbolt 1 compatible with USB (3.0)?\nI have a MacBook Pro 13'', Early 2011 (MacBookPro8,1) and a Laptop Docking Station (Sabrent DS-RICA), which only has a USB 3.0 B input. I would like to connect the two, but not directly via USB since said MPB has only USB 2.0 and I'm getting hard delays on the external screen via such a USB 2.0 connection.\nSo I'm thinking about connecting said docking station to the Thunderbolt 1 port of my MBP via an Thunderbolt 1 to USB 3.0 adapter (e.g. this pricy thing). But I'm not sure if this will do the job, because I've heard that Thunderbolt 1 does not transmit data in a way for a USB device to understand, even with this adapter... Now I'd like to check that info with the knowledge of this great community, thanks!\n\nA: \nDoes Thunderbolt 1 provide USB (3.0) functionality?\n\nNo.  Thunderbolt 1 does not provide any USB functionality.\nThunderbolt 1 and 2 provide only two protocols:  PCIe 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.1a and 2.0 respectively.  Thunderbolt 3 is (currently) the only one that supports PCIe 3.0, DisplayPort 1.2 (two streams), USB 3.1 gen 2, and power delivery. \n\nA: No, there is no USB functionality at all in Thunderbolt 1. However, it is not necessary to have USB functionality inside Thunderbolt for this to work!\nThe USB functionality is actually inside the Kanex adapter, you've linked. It contains a real USB controller, such as one you would find inside a laptop or PC. These controllers usually attach to a PCI(e) bus - which is exactly what a Thunderbolt port provides (i.e. a kind of extended PCIe bus).\nThis means that using this adapter, it is indeed possible to connect your MacBook Pro and the Sabrent docking station. It will work just as if your computer had a USB 3.0 port originally.\nSimilarly there's no gigabit ethernet protocol inside Thunderbolt 1 as such. Instead a real gigabit ethernet controller is inside the Kanex adapter, and this is what \"translates\" between the PCIe (provided by Thunderbolt 1) and ethernet (where you can connect to a network).\n", "Q: update rsync in high sierra I want to update rsync in high sierra.\nAfter I installed it using homebrew, it is installed in \n/usr/local/Cellar/rsync/3.1.3_1\nrsync --version still shows 2.6.9. how can I fix that?\n\nA: Try closing terminal window and opening it again.

Model: MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) OS: 10.13.6 \nI connect an external monitor to the macbook, set the Arrangement to be Mirror Displays and then use the keyboard F1 to dim the built-in display to black. It seems it's off and even the back apple log is black (since it's using the same light as the monitor). \nSo, can I consider the built-in display it's off? (means it will not use any hardware/software resources such as CPU/RAM etc..). Thanks.\n\nA: No, the display can still be running and taking power even if the backlight is off.\nThe display has three major hardware components: a backlight, an array of colour filters, and an array of LCDs.\nThe backlight takes a lot of power, but is conceptually very simple: it just emits white light evenly across its area.  The colour filters are complex (with red, green, and blue areas for each pixel) but fixed and don't take any power.  The LCD array is equally complex, but also takes power: it has to filter the light differently for each pixel, letting all the light through for white pixels, blocking it for black pixels, and in between for other colours and shades.\nSo when the display is running, the LCD cells are working and taking power, even if the backlight is providing little or no light.  (This also means that the graphics card and all the associated circuitry is running too.)\nI can verify this from personal experience: I had the backlight die on a 2015 MacBook Pro.  At first, I thought the entire machine had died.  But after a while I thought of shining a torch through the apple-shaped translucent panel: and sure enough, it revealed a small patch of desktop background and the edge of a window — I could even see the pointer when I moved it across that area.  That indicated it was just the backlight that had died.\nSo no, the LCD array, graphics card, and all the other display-related hardware and software &c can still be running and taking power even without the backlight.\nThis probably applies across most or all types of LCD display.  (It's possible that some combinations of hardware and software may automatically shut down those things when you turn the brightness down to zero.  But they don't in my case.)\n\nA: The display is still using resources. You can prove this by opening the Digital Colour Meter. Just hover your mouse to the built-in display which is currently dark. You will still see the content in the Digital Colour Meter on your second screen.\n\nA: Even the physical LCD is still active with the backlight off. On older laptops, you can shine a light (i.e. phone flashlight) through the apple on the back of the display and see a spot of the display, but the new ones are lame and don't have a glowing apple*.\n* Sarcasm... I think\n\nA: The display itself still takes power (see gidde's answer). \nSince you are mirroring, your Mac does relatively little extra work. It has to generate images anyway for the second monitor, and that's the biggest chunk of work the computer does, and is not duplicated. \nThe Mac then needs to send the contents of its video memory to two connectors - normally it would be one, but since you are mirroring, the same video memory is sent to two connectors. So some extra work is done, but not very much. \nAll in all, it will use few resources, but not none at all. \n", "Q: Apple iPad Air - No screen rotation control I'm running iOS 12.1 on an iPad Air.\nRegardless of the switch setting (mute or rotatation) the side switch does not control screen rotation.

While you are using Terminal, any action taken in the Terminal.app will have the same root user level access.\nHowever, once you leave the Terminal.app, such as when you use the open command, that opened app does not inherit the special permissions from root. It sends you back to normal land where your user account is limited.\nTo workaround this, you can use a text editor available in root. A short list includes vi, vim, nano, emacs, pico.

This was brought up in a comment from another question/answer and I was curious what is the difference between an HFS path and an alias path. My understanding they were the same.\n\nA: I believe that there's been some confusion, both in the current understanding of the OP, and reinforced by the answer given by oa-, which has offered an opinion, but not one that is supported by any of the links provided (the answer has since been deleted).\nIt's clear we all understand what an HFS path is in the broad sense, that is a path that separates its folders using a colon delimiter,  e.g.Macintosh HD:Users:CK:Desktop:.  Similarly, we all understand that there is another format, called a posix path, that uses a slash as directory delimiters, e.g. /Users/CK/Desktop/.\nHowever, the confusion I'm seeing is in the use of the term alias (in an AppleScript context), and how this does or does not relate to HFS paths.\n\nObject Specifiers in AppleScript\nAppleScript uses object specifiers to distinguish different object types from one another.  For example, the folder object specifier tells Finder that \"Macintosh HD:Users:CK:Desktop:\" denotes a folder object on the filesystem, and not simply a string that has no context by itself:\ntell application \"Finder\" to reveal the folder \"Macintosh HD:Users:CK:Desktop:\"\n\nversus\ntell application \"Finder\" to reveal \"Macintosh HD:Users:CK:Desktop:\"\n\nthe former illustrating the use of the folder object specifier to correctly form a reference to an AppleScript object, while the latter asking Finder to take a string object and reveal it (which, of course, throws an error, because the command makes no sense).\nAn alias is a type of object specifier just like folder, and it is used to construct an AppleScript object that references a file or folder on the filesystem by supplying it with a name specifier, which evaluates to the path of the item on the filesystem:\n\n\"You can create alias objects and file objects by supplying a name specifier, where the name is the path to an item in the file system.\" \nAppleScript Language Guide - Specifying Paths\n\n\"Alias path\"\nNote that the term \"alias path\" does not officially exist in an AppleScript context, and it is one that has arisen out of convenience, but actually refers to an alias object rather than a path.\nWhat is true is that the path supplied as a name specifier for an alias object must be an HFS path, and for this reason, AppleScripters often refer an \"alias path\" as shorthand for the alias object's name specifier.  It is a colloquial term that works in one direction only, which is when referring to an HFS path whilst wrapped inside an alias construct.  It does not, however, infer that any HFS path must also be a so-called \"alias path\", which makes no sense without the accompanying alias specifier, in exactly the same way it makes no sense to Finder without a folder specifier.\nPaths\nIn a general computing context, a path is defined by Wikipedia as:\n\n\"A path, the general form of the name of a file or directory, specifies a unique location in a file system. A path points to a file system location by following the directory tree hierarchy expressed in a string of characters in which path components, separated by a delimiting character, represent each directory.\" \nWikipedia - Path (computing)\n\nA computer-science definition for path usually generalises this slightly to specify a path as any sequence or list of symbols and names that tell an operating system how to locate a file, to which the path leads.ref: 1 2 3\nIn either case, the nature of a path is, as Wikipedia states, expressed almost always as a string of characters.\nSimply put, a path is a string, and in the AppleScript context, this is always the case.\nMore Than Semantics\nThis can all be dismissed as mere semantics to a casual reader, until situations arise, such as the one that originally spurred the OP to post this question.  Quoting from an answer to another question here:\n\npath to desktop folder\nwould return an HFS path\n\nwhich, of course, it doesn't, because it returns an alias object, not a path.\nThis, however:\n\n(path to desktop folder) as text\n\ndoes return a path, because the alias object has been coerced to text, and the type of path it returns is an HFS path.\nTherefore, whilst the alias object returned by the first example is sometimes referred to as an \"alias path\", taking into account its nature as an alias object; to infer that the second example must also be an \"alias path\" is incorrect, as it now lacks the alias object specifier.\nalias Objects\nSimply, an AppleScript alias object is:\n\n\"An alias object dynamically points to an existing item in the file system.\" \nMac Automation Scripting Guide - Referencing Files and Folders - Alias Objects\n\nAnd, notably:\n\n\"An alias object is displayed as a colon-delimited path preceded by an alias specifier.\" \nMac Automation Scripting Guide - Referencing Files and Folders - Alias Objects\n\nwhich explicitly defines the two components that make up an alias object's definition, being the colon-delimited (HFS) path (i.e. the name specifier, which is a string), paired with the alias object specifier.\nWhat this does is construct an AppleScript object that is much more than just a simple path, and serves as a construct to house lots of different properties of the filesystem item it references, one of which, of course, includes the path to the item.\nThese properties can be enumerated by both Finder and System Events like so:\ntell application \"System Events\" to get the properties of (path to desktop folder)\n\nand, in System Events, we can see the alias object has two properties of note, one being the path property, which returns the HFS path in text format; and the other being POSIX path property, which returns the posix path in text format.\n\nConclusion (or TL;DR)\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Alias path\" is a vernacular that, in an AppleScript  context, can refer to the path of a filesystem item to which an alias object references, but can also refer to the alias object itself.  Therefore, despite what the name implies, an \"alias path\" is not necessarily, itself, a path;\n\n*A path is a string that contains directions through a directory structure to a file item on the filesystem;\n\n*An alias object is, itself, not a path, but does contain path information, and it stores and displays this in HFS format;\n\n*An \"alias path\" will, indeed, be an HFS path (or contain path information as such); an HFS path, however, is not an \"alias path\".\n\n*It's best to avoid using confusing/conflicting terminology, especially in answers on Stack Overflow that are to be read by newcomers to AppleScript or scripting in general.  \"Alias path\" is one of these, as it is not an officially recognised AppleScript term, and clearly has proven to cause confusion.  Therefore, refer instead to \"alias objects\" and \"paths\" as distinct entities, the latter of which can be an \"HFS path\" or a \"posix path\" in string format that pairs with an object specifier to create an AppleScript file reference object.\n", "Q: Apple TV Remote option in iPhone Control Center doesn't work I have an Apple TV which works perfectly. On my iPhone 6s I've been using the Apple TV Remote app for quite some time and that too works perfectly. \nA week ago I activated the Apple TV Remote option for the Control Center (in Settings > Control Centre > Customise Controls) and for the past week I've been trying to get it to work, but for some unknown reason it never ever finds my Apple TV. It just keeps searching and searching!\n\nHow do I get this to work? It would be fantastic to use this from the Control Center! \n\nA: My guess is that you’re using either a 2nd or 3rd generation Apple TV. \nThe iTunes Remote and Apple TV Remote apps available from the iOS App Store will work with all Apple TV units going back to the Apple TV 2.

However, it has Windows 7 installed on it (why, I don't know).  I'd like to use the mini as a work computer at home to sync with what I'm doing at the office.  I've looked at the boot menus, and it doesn't look like there's any remnants of the Mac OS left - it was wiped clean and has Windows installed.  \nThere might be a super-easy answer to this (I've done searches here that don't seem to match my general situation, but I could have missed it), and I apologize for my lack of Mac knowledge here, but I want to install a Mac OS back onto the Mac mini.

In this case, do a search using either Spotlight or Finder's commandF option for the filename you saved it as. \nAlternatively, if you don't recall the filename, you can search by the date (or date range) you last saved/opened/modified the file, the contents of the file (assuming you remember some of it), and even by the kind of file (by default Stickies will save as a plain text file).\n", "Q: Apple Mail won't login after Migration Assistant transfer I recently used Migration Assistant to bring data to a new Mac Mini from a Time Machine backup on my old Mac.

The setup is great, but there is one flaw. 4k is too small! This is a common complaint and while Apple lets you scale them to a more usable size, there must be a lot of graphical interpolation going on as the scaling is not 1:1. So when I scale my monitors, everything is much more readable, but when I type, the characters are delayed when being written on the screen. It’s as if it is lagging behind and can’t keep up drawing the letters as I type them.\nSo my question is, if I got an eGPU, and connected all my monitors to that, would it solve this problem?\nBonus points, does anyone have an eGPU set up they recommend or have had success with? My guess is I don’t need much power as I am an Android developer (but still use iPhone because it’s just better…), and all I want it to be able to type smoothly again.\n\nA: If you had a larger monitor, the problem would go away. I also have a 2018 Mac Mini. I am using a 49\" 4K TV as a monitor. There's no scaling going on, and it looks great. The TV is a TCL brand. Maybe the 49\" size is a bit extreme -- I guess the 43\" model might be better for most people. But, text is large enough without any scaling, and typing is responsive. The display is 3840x2160, and the Mac thinks it is driving a 36-inch display. \nI'm driving the TV using HDMI. The MacMini only has one HDMI port, so if you want three of them, you'll need some adapters. \nFiguring out where to put three 40-something inch monitors where you can see them all is another problem, I guess. \n", "Q: How can I make use of info from a `file-bookmark` entry in a plist?

The first line of output will tell you the \"cwd\", which is the current working directory of the process. It is probably not going to tell you much.\nThe second line of output is usually a \"txt\" file descriptor that will tell you the name of the executable (i.e. the program) that is running in the program.\nThis should tell you which program is running as \"-i\".\n", "Q: Why can't I use this monitor full resolution at 60hz on my 2013 Mac Pro with OS X Mojave? https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/uhd-and-wqhd/32-uj590-uhd-monitor-lu32j590uqnxza/#specs\nSays 60hz on the site, tried HDMI1, HDMI2, FreeSync, tried various HDMI cables, even bought an HDMI to Thunderbolt cable to try instead of HDMI out of the mac.\nWhat gives? \nMy old mac mini can drive my 60\" TV properly, but my Mac pro can't drive an UHD display? Seems like I should be able to do this....\nThis is the only resolution I can get 60hz at:\n\nEDIT Answer marked below. For anyone wondering:\n\n\nA: In order to drive a 4k display at 60 Hz over HDMI, you'll need a GPU supporting HDMI 2.0. The 2013 Mac Pro supports HDMI 1.4 by default.\nTo get this working, you'll want to use a cable plugged into the DisplayPort connector on the monitor, and into the Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro.\n\nA: Got Samsung LU32H850UMUXEN 32 and oh dear 30Hz only with MacbookPro 2018. The solution was that HDMI 1 port on this monitor only supports 30Hz and switching to HDMI 2 did the job. Like the owners manual state.\n", "Q: Is it possible to control the CPU core clocks on macOS? I would like to have any direct control of CPU core clocks. Is this possible on new MacBooks and macOS ?\nI use Intel Power Gadget and Macs Fan Control tools for monitoring the CPU and fans speeds on MacBook Pro 2018 with i9.\nUnderclocking in Mathematica\nWhile running some specific calculations in Mathematica it happens that the CPU gets underclocked from 2.9G to 2.3G in serial and even to 1.5G during parallel computations. This might be Mathematica related, but so far I see no reason for underclocking so heavily. At the start of computation the Turbo Boost is acting, the clock speed is higher and then after about a minute it abruptly reduces, simultaneously after the CPU temperature touches 100C. The average temperature is probably 80C, but with Turbo Boost adjusting the clock, at some point temperature touches 100C and the CPU gets underclocked. The temperature reduces to ~60C, but until the end of computation this process never gets higher CPU nor Turbo Boost. After some more time (5-10 minutes) it will underclock for the second time, although the temperature is stable.\nHowever, if I run another application on the side, the Intel Power Gadget can read higher core frequency (it shows just the average or the maximum, not per core/thread). Also the total core power increases, but only while this second process is running, as if the Mathematica process is forbidden to use CPU on higher clock. It's like the OS does not allow higher CPU frequency for the \"dangerous\" thread, although the temperature can decrease eventually to <50C.\nMathematica task is long but does not change in nature, it multiplies big matrices over and over again just with different numbers.\nAll of this is followed with fans running on higher than default speeds, because I increase them with the Control tool. I am absolutely sure the system could support higher CPU frequency during this, but it does not go for it. My suspicion is on OS, since CPU does not even reach to throttle and there is a clear process preference. Increasing the process' priority did not make a change.\nI am not sure about what is happening here, which is the reason I give longer description of the problem. Also because there might be a different solution to it other than changing the frequency manually, especially if this is impossible to do.\n\nA: There are a few variables of unknown quality and quantity. \nThe i9 MacBook Pros were known to provide strange behaviour due to potentially high power consumption, temperature but not performance output, throttling. Not only the machines are new, so is the OS Mojave. All this can then be amplified by a bug in the software to run. Even Mathematica is not perfect. In this case it seems that the task is single-threaded and pretty taxing for the one core that has to handle this. Internal management of the Intel chip may then take over what is not in Apple's control, given the hardware conditions and designs chosen.\nWhile there might be some reason to hope for further updates to the MacBook Pro's firmware, the macOS Mojave's handling of this or Mathematica to squish bugs or provide workarounds, that is unsatisfying as it does not provide you to try something on your own. \nSome fixes are said to have been delivered for this as of 10.3.6 supplemental update and presumably also rolled into 10.14. As it is unclear whether these are installed or not, make sure you have the latest versions of all software. Although presently these fixes are known to improve things generally and considerably, they fail to deliver improvements for exactly Mathematica.\nEven if mentioning disasterous thermal design will attract downvotes, this is just another case. Case, cooling system and an i9 just are not he perfect mix.\nThe generally known ways to tinker with these settings –– although in no way a guaranteed fix for the current problem at hand –– are the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling TurboBoost with TurboBoost Switcher\n\n*Volta: Ultimate Power Control for Mac**$**\n\n*VoltageShift (explanation)\n\n\nBackground:\n\nApple MacBook Pro 2018: Much more performance with a few clicks\n  The new MacBook Pros have problems with the performance utilization of the Coffee Lake processors. We show why Apple's power management fails and how you can fix it with just a few clicks. \n2018 macbook pro runs faster if you limit the cpu via software \n  Further fueling the dumpster fire that the 2018 Macbook Pro is turning out to be, notebookcheck.net has discovered that by manually limiting power consumption you can actually get better performance.\nApparently, Apple elected to ONLY use temperature as a parameter for ramping up clock speeds, which results in the cpu not having enough time to cool down before trying to boost again. This leads to fluctuations that severely harm performance.\n2018 i9 MacBook Pro throttling discussion [merged]\n  Reviews are finally rolling in on YouTube. Finally a review compared exporting a video on a maxed out 15” 2018 vs 2017. The 2017 finished exporting it 2 minutes faster because the i9 throttled so bad causing worse performance when compared to the maxed i7 CPU in the 2017 model.\nTested: Thermal conditions in the 2018 i9 MacBook Pro dramatically hampering performance\n  So, Apple can also change the fan speed thresholds to accommodate a CPU load better, by setting them to kick in sooner, and faster than it does at present. This probably won't completely eliminate the thermal situation, but it will lengthen the time it will take to get there at the cost of a louder device when under heavy load. Users can do this with Macs Fan Control, or similar utility.\nWe didn't expect a fix from Apple any time soon. But, at least the first steps were taken with a patch on July 24. Time will tell how much of a difference that patch makes, and how well it holds up over time.\nTests Confirm Apple's Throttling Fix Improves Performance for 2018 MacBook Pro Models [Updated]\n  The bug fix came in the form of a supplemental update to macOS High Sierra 10.13.6, which many new MacBook Pro owners have now installed on their machines. Multiple MacBook Pro owners and media sites have been testing the new patch, and the results appear to be largely positive -- the throttling issue has been resolved for the most part and the machines are performing better. \n\nUnfortunately, Mathematica is the exception:\n\nIn all other published practice benchmarks with the exception of Mathematica, the results with and without patch fluctuated within the measurement accuracy range. These tests are either completed too quickly, do not require full CPU power throughout, or test the SSD speed.\nMacBook Pro 2018 im Test: Auswirkungen des Throttling-Updates\n\n\nA: I have resolved the issue of system dynamical underclocking during computations.\nMy code was optimised to save results of certain calculations and avoid redoing these in future. Soon after the start, this table of saved results becomes so huge that operations of search/read/write require many memory access calls. Each CPU core is fast in calculation, but slowed down by waiting for memory access. \nAfter optimising the management of memory, the code is able to run calculations on all cores at full (multi-core) speed for several hours without any overheating and underclocking problems.\n", "Q: How to programatically set Terminal theme/profile Context for this question: \nI'm writing a bash script to automatically setup any Mac with my tools/preferences, ideally with one command if possible.\nThe question:\nI have a .terminal theme file that i use and i'd like for the script to be able to set it as the default terminal profile without having to do it through the GUI after running my script, is there a command for this?\n\nA: Alright i've figured out a solution:\nTo set the terminal theme programmatically you need to write to your systems preferences. So the easiest way that i found to do this was to extract the user preferences from an existing mac first. This assumes that you've already imported your .terminal file into the profiles of the Terminal on your existing machine. So first on the existing mac you need to run the following (My theme is called Material-Theme, replace that part with your own):\nplutil -extract Window\\ Settings.Material-Theme xml1 -o - ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist > theme.xml\n\nThis will create a theme.xml file for you to use in your script. The next thing is just to edit the file a little. This could be automated, but if you're like me you only need to do this part once, so i did this manually. Open the file and remove the surrounding xml at the top and bottom so that all you have is the dict, mine looked like this for reference: https://pastebin.com/zfXFRY2e.\nNow in your script on the new machine you can just run the following to insert this theme into your user preferences:\ntheme=$(<theme.xml)\nplutil -replace Window\\ Settings.Material-Theme -xml \"$theme\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal \"Default Window Settings\" -string \"Material-Theme\"\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal \"Startup Window Settings\" -string \"Material-Theme\"\n\nNow after running the above when you fully close the Terminal app and restart it, your theme should be the default. This process can probably be improved but this worked for me!\nNote you might also want to run defaults read com.apple.Terminal and check if there are any other keys that are relevant to your theme. In my case i found \"NSWindow Frame TTWindow Material-Theme\" = \"0 327 640 450 0 0 1280 777 \"; so my script includes this as well defaults write com.apple.Terminal \"NSWindow Frame TTWindow Material-Theme\" -string \"0 327 640 450 0 0 1280 777 \"\n", "Q: Midi keyboard sustains note after key is depressed I have been using a midi keyboard with the third party app Playground Sessions, and it worked fine.

In fact, I suspect there are several.\nOne of the most obvious is that when you delete a file in your Home directory, the cp command won’t know to delete it from the other drives.\nAlso, cp isn’t smart enough to know if a file has changed or not, so it’s going to copy all of your files each time you run it, which is going to be a huge waste of time for the majority of your data.\nThen there are permissions, and special files, and so forth.\nSo, in short, don’t use cp for this.\nrsync would be a much better choice than cp … but, having said that, I should add that I firmly believe there are only 2 kinds of people in the world: \n\n\n*\n\n*people who have accidentally deleted data with rsync, and \n\n*people who have never used rsync. \n\n\nWhich is to say, be careful with rsync, especially when using it to delete files. Start with a small set of files/folders which are either duplicated/backed up somewhere safe or unimportant, and don’t forget to use --dry-run before you run a new rsync command.\nPersonally, I think CCC or SuperDuper are well worth the money (in fact, I own them both), and would much rather use them than any other method of making a backup.\n", "Q: Cancelling an Apple subscription I no longer own any Apple devices.

I usually ask for the serial number and good pictures before buying, but I want to know what to do when I physically meet the person I decide to buy from. What should I do when with the buyer to test the system to know what defects it may have? The system would either be running Mac OS 8 or 9 (classic), or OS X. If there is a set of things I should do, or a program I should run what would that be?\n\n\nA: \nI am going to buy an old iMac G3 Over the next couple of days/weeks,\nand I want to make sure that I am buying a system with no problems.\n\nAssuming you're getting the Bondi-Blue iMac G3, you're looking at a machine with 20 years on it.  Getting one with \"no problems\" is a tall order and akin to buying a \"reliable classic car.\"\nSome of the issues you can expect:\n\n*\n\n*brittle plastic\n\n*malfunctioning CD-ROM\n\n*leaking capacitors\n\n*failing IDE/PATA Hard Drive\n\nIf you get a machine that boots and runs, you're well on your way.  That said, this will run OS 8, 9 and OS X through 10.3 Panther.\nWhat to look out for...\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have original install disks.  If you do, the second disk will have your diagnostic tools.  Boot that and run them\n\n\n*Run First Aid using Disk Utility.  If the drive is actively failing, this will tell you.\n\n\n*Bring an audio CD  with you to test out the drive and how well the speakers work\n\n\n*Determine whether you're getting the Rev A. or B model.  The B version had the ability to support more memory (512M versus 384M) and better graphics (6MB VRAM on ATI Rage Pro versus 2M RAM on ATI Rage)\n\nA: I do agree with @Allan largely.\nBut to answer/elaborate the specific question: what you'd ideally want to do is run AHT. These used to be included on a partition of the install disks a machine would ship with, but the AHT (Apple Hardware Test) disk images are still available online. And though the AHT support page index is gone, you can find it preserved at the Internet Archive. So I wouldn't consider the lack of original install disks \"the end of the world\".\n\n\n*\n\n*I actually wouldn't necessarily consider a bad HD a deal-breaker myself, either, depending on the model. They still make IDE/PATA hard drives. And one should be able to find disk images of old OS X and even Mac OS 9 versions pretty easily. With a paid Developer account, I believe Apple still hosts a Jaguar image (which includes an OS 9 image). Moreover, there were a lot of revisions of \"G3\" iMacs and assuming it isn't the original Bondi Blue, you might find one that can FireWire 400 option-boot to an external drive.\n\n*However, I can't re-emphasize enough the point about brittle plastic, and, in general, the difficulty in teardown and reassembly with a machine like this. I used to be an ACMT at a AASP back in the day, and these guys were a pain to repair back when they were still covered by AppleCare, and that was with service manuals and genuine replacement parts. And:\nMost importantly, it can be quite dangerous to disassemble. Unless you're  quite comfortable with your knowledge of how to properly discharge a CRT safely, its yourself I would be worrying about first, before cracking one of these open. You would also need to be properly grounded for the rest of any surgery you attempt, because those boards will fry with even the slightest amount of static. And if you needed to Google \"discharge a CRT\"—don't even think about it.\nOn the other hand, if the CD drive is working and you've burned the right version of AHT onto a blank disc, and it runs, I'd say you're good to go. I don't know about you, but an original, first-gen iMac, with all discs, etc., and with everything in fully working order, would almost certainly be well above my price-point.\n\nA: The main uses of the system should dictate a list of end-to-end tests. A couple examples:\nNetwork/\"Internet\" access\nI wouldn't get on the public network (none of your browsers will be secure), but you might want to at least have some transfer to your other home systems.\n\n*\n\n*AirPort - it uses the older, original airport, it probably only talk to the old flying-saucer Airports.\n\n*Ethernet - your best bet. Everything is supposed to be 10mb compatible, but I'd bring the hub you will actually use, and at least get a green link-light on both sides.\n\n*Modem - This probably still works, but it depends on what you think of the words \"hobby\" vs. \"fun\".\n\nAging CD-drive\nThe HD drive concerns are valid, but also remember that your CD-drive is going to be getting old too. I had the CD-drive on a iMac G4 (lamp-style) fail, and soon after, the HD stopped spinning up, so for systems this old, you should think about both concerns.\nReal mouse vs. \"best\" mouse\nSome people loved the look of the \"hocky-puck\" mouse, others really disliked the feel. (I was neutral on that ), but I did find that a wired Mighty-mouse was my favorite mouse for this (it has \"pill\" shape that Apple stuck with when they upgraded).\nIf you will really use this system (for word processing of old games, etc.) you might want to get another mouse. You can even have two mice, if you need to compromise.\nPrinters\nIf you have legacy printer, of the right era, it will still work. With MacOS 10 you get a lot of language support out of the box, they make excellent non-internet \"typewriters\" for kids.\n", "Q: The startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition.

Will it backup Box? I've ben religiously backing up my Macs using Time Machine, onto a NAS. Everything runs, I get no errors. However today I was looking for a file that I had accidentally deleted and couldn't find it.\nWhich led me to want to find a final answer to the questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*for files stored on the iCloud drive that I access on a daily basis directly from my Mac, will those be backed up to Time Machine?\n\n*for files stored, similarly, on Box.com, that I also access on a daily basis... Will those be backed up to Time Machine?\n\n\nA: By default, iCloud Drive files are backed up with Time Machine. You can find them in this folder:\n/Users/username/Library/Mobile Documents/\n\nwhere username is the username of your account.\nNote that if you have excluded the the Mobile Documents folder, Library folder, etc. from Time Machine - then the files will ofcourse not be backed up.\nAlso note that Time Machine can only backup the files that are actually on your computer. If you have set iCloud Drive to optimize storage usage, some files could be stored only in the cloud and not on your own computer. You can see that in the Finder when opening the iCloud Drive - a cloud icon will appear to the right of those files that are not stored on your computer. They will then not be included in your Time Machine backup.\nThe same applies for files on Box.com and other cloud storage service. If the files have indeed been stored on your computer, and you haven't manually excluded them from the backup, then they're included in your Time Machine backups.\n", "Q: How to disable default Mission Control shortcuts in terminal?

If you are interested in that, shoot me an email via the support tab on the homepage listed below through an email or twitter DM. But also, Apple should just go ahead and support named Desktops natively, they're inevitably going to do so eventually - as all other OS platforms do, and it should be sooner rather than later. Thanks!]\nThere's a free app in the Mac App Store that (disclaimer) I made and launched in May of this year called CurrentKey that lets you give Spaces a persistent name via the menubar. It also lets you give each Space a unique icon, and tells you how you spend time across your Spaces (and the apps within them). Because macOS API's are limited, the names stay in the app and don't show up in Mission Control. But they are persistent.\nThe app also lets you jump directly to another named Space (it calls them \"Rooms\") via its dropdown menu or by a globally assigned hotkey.

Both filesystems are natively not supported in macOS (hence the \"not readable\" dialog). If the NAS HDs are formatted in EXT3/4 you can try the EXT filesystem package for macOS by Paragon software (trial is available).\nhttps://www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-mac/\nIf the filesystem on the NAS HDs is Btrfs, no luck with macOS. There is no Btrfs filesystem \"driver\" for macOS available. You can then only try to mount the drives on a system capable of reading Btrfs (another Syno NAS/Linux box etc.).\n\nA: \nI want to be able to retrieve our data as it has family pictures etc. and a lot of other valuable data stored on it.\n\nYou won't be able to mount the individual drives because Synology employed (as a default) a technology called SHR (Synology Hybrid RAID).  So, to recover anything, you will need another Synology unit.  Short of having a second Synology unit, your data should have been backed up.\n\nSHR is an automated RAID management system that makes storage volume\ndeployment easier than traditional RAID systems. SHR will allow users\nto handle RAID management, expand storage, and maximize storage\ncapability even if they do not have a fine grasp of various RAID\nlevels. SHR allows for 1-disk or 2-disk worth of redundancy - meaning\nthe SHR volume can suffer up to two disks lost, and the data volume\nwill still be available for use. Note that a RAID volume (either\nClassic RAID or SHR) is not a backup system.\n\nEven if using \"classic\" RAID, you still woudln't be able to mount the individual drives; they would be need to be mounted as the entire array (and this is before you get to the filesystem).\nIt can't be said enough that RAID is not a backup.  It's a fault tolerant device, not a disaster recovery device.\nMy suggestion is to obtain a similar Synology unit (secondhand via eBay is fine), rebuild the array then archive them to a USB drive.\n\nA: Do you know anyone with a Synology NAS you can drop the drives into to recover the files? Synology claims you can add drives from another NAS setup and it should be able to recognize them. That would be the easiest way, if the drives themselves are fine. Pull the data onto another backup system, then reformat the drives for macOS and keep using them as a static backup or Time Machine.\nFair warning though, if you do this, you need an enclosure that has a fan... I've had drives in fanless enclosures die after long usage for backups.\n\nA: I downloaded the UFS Explorer RAID Recovery software, connected both disks and exported the data. \n", "Q: Mac mini 2018 HDMI surround sound output I have a new Mac mini 2018.

AUTO, which\n\nPresets the sound as it was recorded/ encoded without adding any\n  surround effects.\n\naccording to the manual.\n", "Q: iMac 4,1 does not have Boot Camp update I have found in Apple support that iMac 4,1 does not have Boot Camp drivers update.\nI have installed Windows 7 Home Basic 32bit. So I will have to find an alternate solution for driver updating because it it necessary for good functioning.\nDoes anyone knows any solution?\n\nA: What you have run into is a fairly common problem with any computer. Once they reach a certain age there stops being updates.\nThe problem is likely not just Apple. Consider that this Mac was released in 2006, going on thirteen years ago. I do PC/Windows support for a living and we have 5 year old computers with no driver updates available.\nIt is possible that if you find the make and model of the various components in your iMac (video, sound, network, bluetooth, WiFi, etc.) via Windows Device manager you may find some updates for drivers.\nFor example if you find that your iMac has a Broadcom L5105 (I made this number up for illustration purposes) chipset, then you would search for Windows 7 drivers for that particular chipset.\nBut I am betting that you are unlikely to find many (if any) driver updates for 13 year old hardware. Heck Windows 7 itself is end of life in just over a year and Microsoft won't provide any more updates to Windows itself after that.\n\nA: According to the instructions Apple posted at the website Install Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp, the Windows 7 installation media must include Service Pack 1 (SP1). If your media does not include SP1, then you should get a newer ISO file from the Microsoft website Download Windows 7 Disc Images (ISO Files). The download is free, but you will need to enter your Windows 7 product activation key to enable the download.\nYou can verify if SP1 has been included by selecting System from the Control Panel. Below is an example of what to look for.\n\nYour iMac is a early 2006 model with 32 bit processors. So far you have not given a reason for needing a update for the Boot Camp drivers. The last released Boot Camp Support Software for your model Mac is on the Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) installation DVD. Snow Leopard is still available for purchase from Apple. (See this website) Based on release dates, you might be able to use the Boot Camp Support Software on the Leopard (OS X 10.5) installation DVD. \n\nNote: The Boot Camp Support Software will not appear on the Snow Leopard DVD if viewed from OS X (macOS). You must open the DVD on a machine running Windows. You will also probably need a DVD drive that can read dual layer DVDs (DVD+R DL).\n\nHere is what is displayed when opening the Snow Leopard installation DVD on my Mac running High Sierra:\n\nAnd, here is what is displayed when opening the same Snow Leopard installation DVD on my Mac running Windows 10:\n\n\nNote The newer releases of the Boot Camp Support Software, which are available for download from Apple, are for the newer Macs. These releases are not updates that can be used on older Macs.\n\nNormally, any updates to the Boot Camp Support Software are provided by Apple by running Apple Software Update while booted to Windows. I believe the Apple Software Update provided with the older Boot Camp Support Software no long works. You can get a newer version of Apple Software Update by installing Apple products such as iTunes, but these versions of Apple Software Update with not provide updates to the Boot Camp Support Software for your older model Mac.\nOften Microsoft will provide updates for drivers for older Macs. With Window 10 this is done automatically once Windows is installed. Also, the Windows 10 iso will already contain most of the drivers needed to run the operating system.\nOnce windows is installed, you can open the Device Manager to see if there are any driver problems. Just because the Device Manager shows a problem does not mean there is actually a problem. Many Macs contain redundant or unneeded hardware. When the Boot Camp Support Software is run after you finish installing Windows, Null drivers are installed that pacify this hardware. This also causes the Device Manager to not show errors for this redundant or unneeded hardware. Often, when you install a version of Windows that is not officially supported by Apple for your Mac, the Device Manager will show errors. If your Mac appears to be functioning normally, then you can ignore these errors.\n\nFYI: It is possible you could run 32 bit Windows 10 on your model Mac by using the drivers on the Snow Leopard DVD. Windows is designed to use older drivers when newer ones are not available.  \n\nI also should mention that to run Windows you should make sure you have the latest firmware installed. For your model Mac, you have to manually install these updates. The latest update for your Mac can be found at the Apple Website: About EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers.\n", "Q: Apple planning to release new Mac Pro? With the Mac Mini getting a new release, what is happening with the Mac Pro (aka the \"Trash Can\")? It has not had any design changes since 2013, and 5 years later it would seem that Apple would plan to give it a new look. I read some articles that claim how Apple will change the Mac Pro, but are these statements true or can they be backed up by official Apple releases?\nA quick search online brings you to either pages that stay on-the-surface of the topic, not going into much detail, or just fan concept drawings. Some places give info that they claim was released by Apple. \nWhat has Apple officially released about there being a new Mac Pro, if they have released anything?\n\nA: A new modular Mac Pro will ship sometime in 2019, along with a new Apple display.\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2018/04/06/2019-mac-pro/\n", "Q: How can I remove the Mojave download without installing it? I accidentally clicked the upgrade message, thinking I was upgrading something else, which downloaded Mojave. \nI was then presented with a window to install Mojave.  I don't want to install Mojave. It appeared I could not close the window, only minimize it.  But once I did minimize it I was able to right-click and select Quit.  \nI would like to completely remove whatever was downloaded because I'm afraid it will install without my consent. Any solutions to remove the download?\n\nA: It should be in Applications, as \"Install macOS Mojave\" - just in case you were looking for it under \"M\".\nThe installer is simply an app, so like any app, just put it in the trash and empty the trash.\n\nA: Thank you so much.  I couldn't delete from the Application icon in my dock, but I was able to go to the Application folder in Finder.  I did not right-click, but I used the \"trash can\" icon I had added to the Finder toolbar.  That sent it to Trash (it made me enter the administrator password first), and I then emptied Trash and I was fine.\n\nA: I’ve had this problem repeatedly (including today) with the Mojave installer where it leaves behind the DMG file (5GB+) in the trash an nothing will delete it. The only way I have found to delete it is to\n\n*\n\n*boot to recovery\n\n*mount the boot (data) partition\n\n*open Terminal\n\n*manually CD into the .Trash folder (or Users/user/.Trashes)\n\n*then rm -rf \"Install macOS Mojave”\n", "Q: How I can set a dot to center of MacBook monitor?

I have a USB type A to type C adapter. The iPad powers up the headphones.\nSometimes the sound is perfectly fine (rarely), other time the sound is distorted. Also, some time I can't control the volume.\nAny idea how can I connect them?

Got an SMS from a new contact I know, saying simply \"hi it's Jane and peter\"\nI don't have any address book entry existing for this person but the phone suggested \"maybe:Jane\" - ok, I can see that conclusion\nHowever, tapping the banner at the top of the message it said \"contact info for Jane.. blah blah cellphone number 123 456 789.. found in Mail\"\nAnd then it showed a mail from my account manager at my insurance broker confirming a policy detail - entirely unrelated to this person, the trailing phone number digits are different, all names are different, they'll never have met or interacted etc.  I can't find anything they have in common - just wondered if it's reliable, how it matches, what data big brother is linking up to offer this assist etc? \n\nA: Reliability is not a binary, black/white property. You'll find cases where this feature doesn't work at all, suggesting the wrong thing - and you'll find cases where it does work, suggesting the right thing.\nI don't have any statistics on exactly what the hit/miss frequency is. I doubt if anyone does - perhaps Apple has some statistics. However, in my own experience it works fairly well. It can be a convenience that a phone call from an unknown number is instantly matched with the contact details from an email, you've received yesterday for example.\nThe matching is done by the Spotlight functionality on the phone. Basically an index is created of for example your emails inside Mail.app. When for example a call comes in, and the number is unknown, then iOS will automatically search your Spotlight index for emails to find e-mails mentioning that phone number. The contact information will then be derived from the mail using proprietary heuristics.\nThe implementation of this feature is entirely on the phone. It does not require a cloud service, nor does it send your data off for processing somewhere on the internet. So your question about \"big brother\" is that no \"big brother\" is involved.\nIf you want, you can disable this feature from Settings > Contacts > Siri & Search > Find Contacts in Other Apps.\n", "Q: Bluetooth headphones disconnect a few seconds after connecting on macOS When I pair my bluetooth headphones (Bose QC 35) to my MBP running macOS Mojave, they sometimes disconnect a few seconds later. I try turning them off and on again, turning off bluetooth on my phone (in case it's competing for a connection or something), but none of that helps. The only solution I've found is to restart my computer which is really not ideal.\nIdeally I'd like to find the cause of this, but it would also be really helpful to find a workaround. For example, is there some kind of driver I could try restarting without having restart my whole computer?\n\nA: None of the above mentioned worked for me, and then I tried this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Network > From the side pane, Delete Bluetooth PAN using the minus sign (-) at the bottom. \n\n*Then use the Plus Sign (+) to create a new one using the drop-down menu. \n\n\nThe system will re-apply profile settings and you should be good to go after that. \n\nA: I had the same problem after upgrading to Mac OSX Catalina with my Sennheiser HD 4.0 BT. I followed this guide and it worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist\n\n*Clear PRAM according to Apple's instructions by rebooting and holding down Command + Option + P + R for roughly 20 seconds until either the second startup sound plays or Apple logo appears and disappears for a second time.\n\n\nA: I tried all these things, but they didn't work. Eventually switched my wifi to 5GHz and the problem went away. Ref: Bluetooth and WiFi interfering with one another since Yosemite\n\nA: Had same issue while using Bowers&Wilkins PX7, couple of days everything was fine, then connected/disconnected hell started. \nNone of the provided solutions would solve issue for Bowers. \nTurned out that a solution was from the other side: forgetting all devices from the headset itself restored the sound, hooray! \n\nA: Try resetting the Bluetooth module.\nShift-Option click the BT menu bar item > Debug > Reset the Bluetooth module.\n\nA: I found that Bluetooth actually works for all devices but for the audio ones.\nRebooting the Bluetooth module didn't do anything, but killing coreaudiod solved my problem for good.\nsudo kill -9 `ps ax | grep 'coreaudiod' | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1}'`\n\n\nA: The Bose Connect app on iPhone is my go-to for this situation. Typically the issue is that my QC 35's are connecting to other devices (Apple TV, iPad, etc.) instead of my Mac and the app allows me to disconnect the headphones from that device and then connect them to my Mac (all from within the app!).\n\n\nA: What worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold Option + Shift\n\n*Click the Bluetooth menu bar icon\n\n*Go to Debug\n\n*Click Remove all devices\nReconnect your Bluetooth devices.\n\n\nA: I know this is an old thread but this might be an answer to those that have already tried resetting the BT module, disconnecting and reconnecting all devices, factory resetting the devices, resetting the SMC.\nTo start with, I was completely outraged that all the bluetooth headsets that I own weren't disconnecting at all from the Windows machines that I own but ALWAYS were disconnecting from my Macs and when I was near my Mac with my iOS devices (3 iphones (1 x SE, 2 x 11 Pro) which are connected to 2 iWatches which I use for testing software I was a little inspired and moved all of my apple devices from my workspace area and had a pair of cheap BT headsets paired and connected with my Mac and they haven't disconnected at all in more than 24 hrs.\nTL;DR: If you have keyboards or watches or other wireless BT devices connected to iOS devices (phones, tables, other) keep them away from the MacOS device you have connected with your headsets or headphones and I guarantee that they won't get disconnected.\n\nA: I have the same problem with momentum 3. There is no luck after resetting the BT module, disconnecting and reconnecting all devices. Then I power off it and power on, then the problem gone.\n\nA: I also had no success with the other answers mentioned here. Found this suggestion on Reddit to kill the coreaudiod process and it finally solved the problem without having to restart my computer.\n\nA: In my case I had my headphones connected to charge via the keyboard despite the lack of power.  I think this may have confused the blutooth as once I connected back to the keyboard and disconnected after the low power warning went away then it could connect as normal?\nI hope this helps someone else.\n\nA: Tried all of the options described here but none of them helped. My problem was that I tried to improve sound quality by modifying bluetooth audio options using Bluetooth explorer from additional tools for Xcode. Suddenly it stopped working after some update to Mac OS and the tool itself was crashing when I was trying to access it. Solution was to download additional tools for Xcode with lower version then 11.4 (version 9 worked for me) and then resetting it from there. Some more details here\n\nA: In Activity Monitor double click the bluetoothaudiod process and Force Quit it\n\nA: I restarted my computer and it worked.\n\nA: My problem resolved after:\n\n*\n\n*Fully quit itunes/spotify both mac and iphone (quit and swipe up)\n\n*Remove device from bluetooth prefs on mac\n\n*Reset bluetooth module (from the answer above, \"Shift-Option click the BT menu bar item > Debug > Reset the Bluetooth module\")\n\n*On other devices (iPhone, iPad), go to Settings > Bluetooth > Tap the \"i\" next to 1 or 2 connections for the same device and tap forget the device. In my case it was \"Bose NC 700\" and \"LE-Bose NC 700\"\n\n*Hold the pairing button to reset bluetooth on my headphones (in my case they had to be charging and hold for 30 seconds)\n\n*Re-pair them to iphone, re-pair them to mac\n\n*Success\n\n", "Q: How can I make reminders show on the lock screen on iOS 12.01?

The system disk is actually mounted read/write in Mojave Recovery, so the trick is that you have to refer to the drive by starting at /Volumes/yourdrivenamehere.  So in this case the command to remove the file would be:\nrm -rf /Volumes/yourdrivenamehere/Library/SystemMigration/History/Migration-1C2FCFF8-A394-409D-8DB3-E7885C0D5E81/QuarantineRoot/Library/StagedExtensions/Library/Extensions/Soundflower.kext\n\n\nA: You will need to disable System Integrity Protection and remove /Library/SystemMigration/History/Migration-1C2FCFF8-A394-409D-8DB3-E7885C0D5E81/QuarantineRoot/Library/Extensions/Soundflower.kext (and then re-enable System Integrity Protection).\nTo enable or disable System Integrity Protection, you must boot to Recovery OS and run the csrutil(1) command from the Terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Recovery OS by restarting your machine and holding down the Command and R keys at startup.\n\n*Launch Terminal from the Utilities menu.\n\n*Enter the following command\ncsrutil disable \n\n(or crsutil enable)\n", "Q: Can't set different Java version in Mojave with jenv I want to have different Java versions on my machine.\nI installed jenv for that reason.

Then I uninstalled McAfee VirusScan. I still don't know what cause -20 refers to but it hasn't happened since I uninstalled McAfee VirusScan. If you have any software that installs a kernel extension as many virus scanners do, try uninstalling that software or booting in safe mode (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262) and see if the problem goes away.\n\nA: I to experience the same random restart problem.  I agree is seems like some app requested a system restart with no error associated with it.  It seemed to be only associated with my account, the guest account did not exhibit the same problem but deleting my old account and starting a new one did not fix it.  The only thing that worked for me was to erase the disk and reinstall the OS, like the previous person.\nBTW, I installed iStat Menu after I started experiencing the problem so I don't think it was that app.\nBefore I found this post, a work around for this that I used when I had to leave the computer working on something unattended was to open an editor and make a change to a file but don't save it.  The OS will stop the restart until the editor can be shut down.  I used emacs but I'm sure any non-cloud based editing SW would work. \n", "Q: How can I select the arrow on image capture on mojave?

How can I select it?\nAlso is there a tool to obscure sensitive areas in the screenshot?\nfinally what is this tool called? Once launched it doens't show an application name on the toolbar, and so I cannot find much references for it.\n\n\nA: Those arrow \"formats\" are tied to actual forms to be uses, not free-form lines created by the pen and marker tools.\nIf you add a form from the menu behind the square/circle icon and have it selected the arrow menu items become active (as a matter of fact the form menu already offers an arrow as a template).\n\nThe yellow annotations are my \"comments\" here, the red ones are the results I added in a previous round of annotating. :)\n\nHere I added a line first, now the arrow menu items are selectable. I chose one and the red line to the right turned into the arrow you see. You can also add an arrow directly from the form menu (not shown).\nOh, and btw, the added lines/arrows don't just have end points but also a middle \"curving\" point already, so it's easy to curve them.\n", "Q: Why would an app constantly monitor /etc/passwd? I noticed today that Adobe Desktop Services is constantly monitoring /etc/passwd.\n\nWould would be the point? Passwords are not stored in /etc/passwd so why would an app monitor /etc/passwd? What info might they be trying to monitor?\n\nA: Adobe Desktop Service wasn’t looking at your /etc/passwd. Apple’s system library was.\nApple’s system library wanted to know your username so it can find your home directory. It then decided the best way to figure out your username was to look it up in /etc/passwd. Adobe Desktop Service just wanted to know the path to your home directory, and (correctly) used the CoreFoundation framework for that. That’s why the call appears under Adobe’s process.\nDetails\nIn your screenshot, the Caller entry says something like _fsi_get_user. This is the symbol of a private subroutine in one of macOS’s system libraries, libsystem_info.dylib, located in /usr/lib/system.\nThe public source code of the _fsi_get_user function reveals the following logic:\nif (geteuid() == 0)\n{\n  // […]\n}\nelse\n{\n  f = fopen(_PATH_PASSWD, \"r\");\n  _fsi_get_validation(si, VALIDATION_PASSWD, _PATH_PASSWD, f, &va, &vb);\n  fmt = 1;\n}\n\nLooking at the decompiled code in libsystem_info.dylib (for example, using Hopper Disassembler) confirms that _PATH_PASSWD is indeed the file name /etc/passwd. (The source code further down in file_module.c also explains why there’s a call to fstat immediately after the fopen: the implementation of _fsi_get_validation does that to figure out the last modification time of your /etc/passwd.)\nIn other words: Adobe wasn’t looking at your passwd file; Apple’s system library was.\nConnecting the dots\nThere are many possible call stacks that may connect Adobe Desktop Service’s code to the _fsi_get_user function. A bit of static analysis suggests the most plausible candidate would be NSHomeDirectory, a utility class in Foundation.framework.\nLooking at Adobe Desktop Service’s binary reveals that it indeed calls [NSHomeDirectory UTF8String]:\n*100032ac4   call   imp___stubs__NSHomeDirectory\n*100032ac9   mov    rsi, qword [0x10008a178]  ; \"UTF8String\"\n*100032ad0   mov    rdi, rax\n*100032ad3   call   qword [_objc_msgSend_100088350]\n\nApple’s implementation of NSHomeDirectory will then lead us to /etc/passwd fairly quickly. My educated guess on the most likely chain of function calls would be:\nAdobe Desktop Service → [NSHomeDirectory UTF8String] (in Foundation.framework) → NSHomeDirectoryForUser → CFCopyHomeDirectoryURLForUser (in CoreFoundation.framework) → _CFCopyHomeDirURLForUser → getpwuid (in libsystem_info.dylib, re-exported via libSystem.B.dylib) → si_user_byuid (this is where Apple decides at runtime which source it’s going to use. For example, if your user ID is between 1 and 499, your /etc/passwd will be consulted instead of Directory Services.) → file_user_byuid → _fsi_get_user.\nTo be extra sure, I further analyzed the binary Adobe Desktop Service and as expected, it contains no single reference to /etc/passwd. (I haven’t checked whether or not Adobe Desktop Service does other shady things, though.)\nThe whole analysis would have been a little easier if you had actually clicked on one of the entries before you created the screenshot. Your app would then have shown the relevant stack trace in the bottom right corner (it’s the lines where it says Stack Trace). But hey, I had a lot of fun figuring it out, and I’ve learned a lot that way!\nVerification\nTo confirm that my analysis is correct, you may want to click on one of the /etc/passwd entries in your Instruments app and find the terms NSHomeDirectory and file_user_byuid somewhere in the stack trace.\n\nA: From the information in your screenshot, the program is not trying to \"monitor\" the contents of the file. It is instead repeatedly asking for the metadata about the file (i.e. does the file exists, how large is it, when was it created, etc).\nOnly Adobe can tell you why they have coded their program the way they did.\nHowever note that there are multiple logical explanations of why they did what they did - that does not involve any \"spying\" or \"nefarious\" activities.\nFor example this particular daemon program (i.e. background service) might constantly check for the existence of /etc/password in order to determine that it is (a) not sandboxed, and (b) not stripped of its permissions so that it is forbidden to examine that file.\n", "Q: Determining unknown filesystems from OSX Years ago I set up a Linux-based multimedia PC for my parents to store all their music and movies on, as that's the OS I use on my home computers and so if/when things went pear-shaped I'd be able to guide them through fixing it over the phone, as they live overseas. Recently that computer died of a hardware failure, and they'd like to access their library of multimedia from their MacBook. \nThe problem is that the filesystem on the multimedia drive was set up as a Linux one (probably BTRFS or ext4), and I don't remember what I formatted it as. They have a SATA-to-USB bay that they can plug the multimedia drive into, but OS X doesn't recognise the filesystem and we don't want it to attempt to \"repair\" or reformat the drive and risk losing everything (the backup drive also used a Linux filesystem). I'm unable to visit them and fix it myself, and at any rate I'm not sure what tools there are to use, being totally unfamiliar with what's available for OS X.\nHow would they go about determining the filesystem on the drive, and/or mounting it from their MacBook?\n\nA: The simplest solution that would not require altering the software on the MacBook would be to create a USB live flash drive of a linux operating system such as Ubuntu. You could then boot from the flash drive and then access the multimedia drive through the SATA-to-USB bay.\n", "Q: Can I change the default size of a new table in macOS Pages? In Pages, I frequently have to make documents (for school) with a two by five table.  Each time I click the table button, I then have to resize the table.  Can I change the default table size, so each new table is automatically two by five?\n\nA: You have a number of options available to you, such as creating a template, using AppleScript or Automator to create applications, scripts, or services, and so on.\nBelow is a sample script I've created based on the details in your question:\ntell application \"Pages\"\nset myDoc to make new document\ntell page 1 of myDoc to set myTable to make new table with properties {column count:5, row count:2}\ntell cell range of myTable\n    set width of columns to 80\n    set text wrap to true\n    set alignment to left\n\nend tell\nend tell\n\nAssuming you're not familiar with how to use this, below is one way you could use the above script:\nCreate a service using Automator\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator (usually found within your Applications folder)\n\n*Go to File > New\n\n*Select Service and click the Choose button (Note: If the 'Service' option is not available, select Quick Action instead)\n\n*In the top right hand of the window that appears, ensure that \"No input\" is selected from the Service receives drop-down list\n\n*Ensure the In drop-down list is showing \"Any application\"\n\n*In the second column containing the long list, find \"Run AppleScript\" and double-click on it\n\n*This will add the Run AppleScript window on the right\n\n*Now, replace the (* Your script goes here *) with the the sample script above \n\n*Save the service using a meaningful name (e.g. Create Pages Table).\n\n\nNow you should be able to run the service from any application by going to the Services list within any Application menu (e.g. Pages > Services, Finder > Services, etc) and select the service you just created. \nNOTES: \n\n\n*\n\n*The set width, set text wrap and set alignment lines within the script are not required. I have included these so you know how to customise these table characteristics if you need to.\n\n*I have assumed from your question that your two by five table referred to five columns by two rows. However, you can safely change the column count and row count values in the script to suit your requirements. \n\n", "Q: Customise voicemail message based on caller Is it possible to programme a specific voicemail message to be used when an individual telephone number calls me?

Any editor I use treats empty space as a word and does not skip it. By empty space I mean newlines, tabs, spaces, etc.\nNow what was for me always just a press of one shortcut option/backspace or option/Fn/backspace is complex operation, because I want to delete just space or newline forward and it deletes also the next word there.\nExample:\nadadada\ndada\nd\nadadad  ad\n\nWhen I place the cursor, (in text wrangler editor, but also other editors such as android studio etc, for example) every other then Xcode actually, so when I place it at end of first line and press fn/option/backspace , then remove just new line and I press it again and then the next word is deleted.

Now Xcode won't let me export apps I was pissed about having 20 different versions of Python on my Mac, so in an effort to clean it up I deleted every single instance of it.

The error logs show nothing of importance.\nThank you.\n\nA: The reason that version is protected by Sip is because it is essential for your system to work. Out of all the python you can remove, that one is not on the list.\nNormally python is relatively local, as in, everything lives in a single directory, but just replacing a couple files from the brew install to the OS install are not very likely to give you a working version of Python.\nThe rest you must have installed yourself.\nI'd say restore your MacOS and then use brew to install the additional versions you need. Even 2.7, as the OS one is not very good for anything but the OS itself. \nSame as you shouldn't pip install stuff globally but always in a virtual environment so that you don't get dependency crap with OS required items, or worse, OS items that fail to function due to broken dependencies.\nSorry, not the answer your looking for I'm sure, but the best I can give. \n", "Q: Unable to re-purchase an app after reporting and getting refunded by Apple How do you buy an app on the Mac App Store that you purchased but asked for a refund from Apple? I purchased an app that I reported and got refunded for due to an issue, but the developer eventually fixed the problem in question.  I would like to purchase the app again.\nI just have an Update button when I go to the app listing and I get the following error when I click on it.\nThis update is not available for this Apple ID either because it was bought by a different user or the item was refunded or cancelled.\n\nI don't see any option to purchase the app again.\n\nA: It appears that this is by design. This is likely to avoid potential gaming of the App Store where users purchase an app, ask Apple for a refund and continue using the app.\nApple disallowed to update or re-download refunded apps on both App Store for iOS and Mac App Store. While this may hurt genuine use cases like yours where an app update has potentially fixed the problem.\nBoth pros and cons of the approach has been discussed. A few articles are linked below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple makes it impossible to get updates for refunded apps\n\n*Apple now makes it clear you’re not allowed to update or redownload refunded apps\nIn case like yours, the recommended approach to take would be to file a bug report with Apple.

I tried both HFS+ and APFS format on the sparsebundle. And once it is mounted on the desktop on the Mac I can put files into the sparse bundle, so it is writable.\nWondering if anyone has any experience with this?\n===\nI tried the suggestion, \"sudo tmutil setdestination smb://username@server/share -p instead, and allow tmutil to create it's own sparsebundle on the server.\" which returned an error. See comment below.\n\nA: It turns out that when you create a sparse bundle disk image that resides on an APFS volume that it is ALWAYS formatted as APFS even if you specify the the format as HFS+ like this:\n \nI created a few of these (just to be sure) and each one failed as a Time machine Destination. \nAs @user128998 pointed out in his comment Time Machine relies on a feature of HFS+ to do it's job and will not work on one formatted as APFS.\nI had assumed that disk utility was creating an HFS+ formatted sparsebundle because I had selected that option when creating the image, as shown in the screencap above.\nIn frustration I did a Get Info on the mounted sparseimage bundle and it showed as an APFS volume. Grr... So I deleted it and created another one and was very careful to NOT select APFS.\nWhen I mounted that sparseimage it too showed as an APFS volume.\nOpening Disk Utility I selected the mounted sparseimage volume and reformatted it as HFS+. The operation took longer than I expected (3 - 4 minutes) but it was successful. And this time when I ran the command\n\nsudo tmutil setdestination /Volumes/MBAir\n\nIt worked!\nSo maybe I found a bug in Mojave (14.2) with disk images and/or sparsebundles. Or maybe it is expected behavior and I didn't know it, either way this can be marked as solved.\n\nA: It may work if you set the backup via sudo tmutil setdestination -p smb://username@server/share instead, and allow tmutil to create it's own sparsebundle on the server. That way it will also know where to go to mount the sparsebundle in the future for backups when it is not already mounted\n", "Q: Is it normal for bluetooth devices to stop responding when CPU is too busy? I have MacBook Pro 13\" mid 2012 with 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD, Mojave 10.14.1. my Magic Trackpad 1 and AirPods get slow when CPU is too busy, especially when cpu percentage is above 70%.

I have an appointment at Genius Bar to check for my Airport card this Friday. I am worried they refused to fix it just because my mac is too slow.\nEDIT: When executing Java programs from IntelliJ IDEA, sometimes Bluetooth devices get slow but sometimes work well. Maybe some other factors makes them slow. I had the same problem when I worked on Sierra.\n\nI've checked out from event logs from Bluetooth Explorer. I think it tells me a lot. I am not sure exactly what they indicate, though. \nWhat I found out from Bluetooth Explorer\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac drops the connection to the AirPods from some reasons. logs says the reason is 0x08.

The benefit of doing this is that these are easy to move around, as compared to the traditional Backups.backupdb folder.  \nSo here is what I did.  On Mac X I created a sparsebundle (call it TM.sparsebundle) on an external disk.  Then I set it as my target for Time Machine (to do this see How can I make my computer believe a disk image is a hardware disk?) and backed up to it.  Then I disconnected the external disk and connected it to Mac Y.  What I want to do is to use Mac X to backup to TM.sparsebundle which is now connected to Mac Y.  I can get it to do this by mounting the TM.sparsebundle on Mac X and then setting it as a TM target (using the same method as before).  \nBut here is the problem - I can't get Mac X's TM to automatically connect to Mac Y and mount the TM.sparsebundle.  Everything works if I do the connecting/mounting manually.\nOf course if I had initially created the sparsebundle from Mac X while being connect to Mac Y then it would have worked.  So the issue is how to get the TM running on Mac X to treat an existing sparsebundle on Mac Y as a legitimate, fully supported TM target and auto-mount it.\nIf you are thinking this is answered by the Great Pondini, it is not - at least not exactly.  He has many variations on this theme (http://www.baligu.com/pondini/TM/18.html) but does not address this particular situation.  I am going to try to adapt one of these methods but it is very slow to even test this so I am hoping someone here will have a definitive solution.\n\nA: I was able to solve this by following Pondini (http://www.baligu.com/pondini/TM/18.html#id18) with a slight modification.  Instead of copying the Backups.backupdb folder from the top level of my source partition I copied it from within the original sparsebundle (what I called TM.sparsebundle above). This worked flawlessly.  \nIt would be nice if there was a faster way to accomplish this - essentially some way to tell TM that a particular sparsebundle was to be used by TM.  But at least this heavy-handed method works. \n", "Q: Adjust font size Safari sidebar Mojave does anyone know how to adjust the Safari sidebar font size?

Select Thunderbolt Ethernet and \"make service inactive\" (click sprocket icon at the bottom)\nThis improved my WiFi connection speed.  My thought being that Thunderbolt is a multipurpose port also used for ethernet and may be taking priority when it is plugged into any device.  If you are using WiFi Thunderbolt ethernet is obviously not needed.\n", "Q: Mac stuck on \"The wine configuration in /user/... is being updated\" \nThat's what we're looking at right now. I've tried to download Wine Bottler but when i tried to run an MSI file with wine bottler for the first time this is what i get\nhow do i fix this?\n\nA: Found this question on Super User:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/1318059/wineboot-hangs-and-does-not-complete\nAccording to the answer it is a known bug with the Homebrew version:\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/26384\nThe workaround is to use the official version:\nhttps://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/macosx/download.html\n", "Q: screen saver and lock not in the same time i want my mac-book (Mojave 10.14.1) to enter screen saver after a certain time but enter lock after longer time. \nis it possible? \ni tried looking for it in screensaver setting and in energy setting without luck. i could only set the screen saver time. \n10x\n\nA: The setting you want is in preferences -> security and privacy -> general -> require password (some time) after screen sleep or screen saver.\nNote that the lock is will happen (some time) after either the screen saver starts or the screen sleeping.\n", "Q: Unable to add Visual Studio Code app's icon to macOS Dock I had Visual Studio Code app's icon in my Mac's Dock before, but I can't put it there again.\nI tried dragging and dropping the app bundle from the /Applications folder, but the icon doesn't land in the Dock. Have I accidentally banned Visual Studio Code.app from the macOS Dock?\nIf yes, how can I revoke the ban? I can add icons for other apps just fine. Even when I have Visual Studio Code.app running, the app's icon doesn't appear in the Dock.\nHow do I resolve the issue and get the app icon to show in the Dock?\n\nA: \nHave I accidentally banned Visual Studio Code.app from the macOS Dock?\n\nNo.\n\nHow do I resolve the issue and get the app icon to show in the Dock?\n\nYou can try resolving the issue by killing the Dock process and re-launching it afresh. To do that, launch Terminal.app and execute the following command-line:\nkillall Dock\nThe command-line is case sensitive. Once executed, the Dock would momentarily disappear and then reappear.  Now you should be able to add the Visual Studio Code.app icon normally by dragging in the app bundle. You should also be able to see the icon normally when the app is running.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro shuts down while in \"Login Window\" I have run into this issue a couple of days ago and it keeps happening. MacBookPro in question is a 13\" 2016 model with Touch Bar running macOS Mojave 10.14.1 (18B75).\nIf I lock my MacBook with Login window and leave it for some time (it looks like it has to be more than 1 hour but I am not certain) then it shuts down.

Pushing respawn out by 30 seconds.\n\nWhich usually occurs around the time the MacBook \"starts sleeping\" that leads to shutdown (but also scattered in smaller quantities in logs.)\nI have already tried resetting the SMC but to no avail.\nDoes anyone have any ideas?\n\nA: I would probably start with testing to see if this behaviour is replicated when booted into Safe Mode and if the issue persists then running Apple Diagnostics.\nBoot into Safe Mode \nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode: \n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP \n\n*Restart your MBP \n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice). \n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. does your MBP still end up going to sleep, etc) \n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your MBP as normal \n\n*Test again when booted normally \n\n\nIf the problem doesn't occur while booted into Safe Mode, let me know and we'll go from there. \nIf the problem persists, proceed with running Apple Diagnostics.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n[UPDATE]\nSince we've established the problem is not occurring when booted into Safe Mode then it's time to investigate login items, fonts, and kernel extensions. \nInvestigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions\nLet's start with Login Items:\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup normally\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Select the Login Items tab\n\n*Take a note of your Login Items \n\n*Now remove all of them by highlighting them and clicking on the - button below\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n\nNow your Mac will boot up without those login items loading. Test to see if you can use your Mac without it going to sleep, etc:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you can, you know one (or more) of the Login items were causing the problem. You can then add them back in one by one until you've identified the culprit. Problem solved.\n\n*If the problem does persist, it's either a problem with fonts you've installed yourself or with a 3rd party kernel extension. A little more info below:\n\n\nFonts:- You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference. For more info, read the following Apple resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to install and remove fonts on your Mac\n\n*Mac OS X: Font locations and their purposes\nKernel Extensions:- You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\nThe above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\n", "Q: My external boot volume won't startup all my Macs when it should Because of the mobility of my work I decided to create a boot volume on an external USB-C SSD so that I can run my user environment on a number of Macs (on an iMac Pro (2017) while at work, on a 15\" MacBook Pro (Retina, mid-2015) while on the road, and on a 27\" iMac (2017) when at home). Unfortunately, while the 27\" iMac and 15\" MacBook Pro boot up fine from the external drive, the iMac Pro doesn’t. \nI’ve tried resetting the NVRAM and even the SMC for good measure. The external boot volume contains macOS Mojave 10.14.1, and this should be fully compatible with the iMac Pro.\nWhat am I missing here?\n\nA: From what you’ve said, I agree it should work fine.\nMy first guess would be to check the Startup Security Utility on the iMac Pro, a feature of the iMac Pro (and other T2 Security Chip enabled Macs) that allows Admin users the ability to enable/disable Secure Boot and also the option of allowing/disallowing External Boot. It’s the External Boot configuration I think is causing your problem.\nTo access the Startup Security Utility, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch on the iMac Pro and as soon as the Apple logo appears, press and hold Command (⌘)+R \n\n*The iMac Pro will boot into the macOS Utilities window\n\n*Go to Utilities > Startup Security Utility from the menu bar\n\n*When prompted, click Enter macOS Password to choose an administrator account and enter its password\n\n*The Startup Security Window will appear and the bottom section provides two options in relation to External Boot. You will need to select the Allow booting from external media option\n\n*Exit the Startup Security Utility \n\n*Restart your iMac Pro and try booting up from your external boot drive\n\n\nNOTE: The above steps require you to enter an Administrator password. If your workplace has not set you up with an Admin account you will need to ask them to follow the above steps.\nFurther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple: About Startup Security Utility\n\n*Apple: About Secure Boot\n\n*Apple: Mac computers that have the Apple T2 Security Chip\n", "Q: How do I uninstall wine when I don't know how it was installed? It was not installed with Homebrew, nor does a .wine file exist in my home directory. I don't remember when or how I installed it, but it's running and using up large amounts of CPU on my machine, and I'd like to remove it for good.\n\nA: The wine project has an excellent Wiki article specific to macOS.  It includes how to remove wine from your macOS system, but basically there are a few ways to uninstall wine\nMacPorts:\nsudo port uninstall --follow-dependencies wine\n\nHomebrew:\nbrew rm wine && brew rm $(join <(brew leaves) <(brew deps wine))\n\nSource:\nsudo make uninstall\nrm -rf /src/wine              #Remove the source\nrm -rf $HOME/.wine            #Remove pseudo C: and registry entries\nrm -rf $HOME/.local           #Remove desktop menu entries and icons\n\nYou can attempt any of these methods without fear that if you didn't install using that method, there won't be adverse affects to your system.\n", "Q: Unable to download an app in iOS 12 I am unable to download an app that I wish to use on an iPhone running iOS 12. Tapping the download button shows the download progress indicator, but the app download doesn't start.\n\nThe app store page of the app shows the following message:\n\nThe developer of this app needs to update it to work with iOS 11.\n\nI am not using iOS 11, but iOS 12, running on an iPhone 8. So shouldn't the app download fine?\nWhat can I do to install this app?\n\nA: There is no way to download and install this app (unless the developer of the app updates it to work).\n\nThe developer of this app needs to update it to work with iOS 11.\n\nThe above message is a bit misleading and is applicable for devices running iOS 11 and later.\nThe app in question is built in 32-bit mode only. An iOS app could be programmed by the developer in either 32-bit mode, 64-bit mode or both. (Note that only one single app is hosted on the App Store, no separate 32-bit and 64-bit version).\nApple started supporting 64-bit apps first with iPhone 5s which featured a 64-bit processor. All the subsequently released models of iPhone feature 64-bit processor.\nApple has stopped supporting 32-bit only apps starting with iOS 11. To run such apps on iOS 11 and later, the developer need to re-program it with support for 64-bit mode.\nIf you wish to use the app, your only resort would be to find an iOS device running iOS 10 or earlier (which supports the app), or contact the developer of the app and request them to update it with 64-bit support. You can find the contact information for the app developer on the App Store page of the app.\nThis is the official explanation by Apple as mentioned on the Apple Support page, About iOS 11 Updates:\n\niOS 11 is performance optimized for 64-bit apps. 32-bit apps will need to be updated by the app developer to work with this version of iOS.\n\nAgain, the same is applicable for iOS 11 and later.\n", "Q: Identify \"CAPS\" style icon in menu bar I've got the following icon in my menu bar:\n\nAnd I'm unsure of its origin.

I have an old iPad my son is using (iOS 9). He plays Clash of Clans. We changed the Apple ID to his own but the Game Center ID is still mine. If I sign out of Game Center and sign in with his ID will I lose all his progress in Clash of Clans?\n\nA: Well it depends on how you want to play the game. If you just want to play the game locally on one device it shouldn't make a difference if the progress and data is stored on-device.\nWhereas if your progress is stored using game centre then the progress will be reset.\n", "Q: How come terminal processes are paused when display sleeps? I'm running some long-running CPU intensive scripts, but I've noticed that the CPU utilisation becomes 0 when the display sleeps. I've already kept the machine awake using caffeine.

Enable Prevent computer from sleeping....or/and set Display sleep to Never.\n\n", "Q: How do I get my iPhone to type the word \"Period\" instead of the punctuation while dictating? I love using my iPhone to dictate long emails, first drafts of documents, and such.  It does such an amazing job and I can capture my thoughts quickly.\nUnfortunately, a lot of the work I do is associated with accounting periods but however I say \"period\", it always puts the full-stop punctuation.\nIs there a way to get it to actually spell out \"period\"?  I end up having to use a word that will not be in the final text (penguin) and then do a search and replace at the end.\n\nA: I have the perfect solution, and it goes as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new contact with the first name of what you want to be dictated, as you want it dictated exactly. (e.g. Contact first name \"period\" without the quotes.)\n\n*Down at the bottom select add new field and add the phonetic first name field.\n\n*Go back up and type out the phrase you'd like associated with the word. I like to use the word \"literal\" space then the word. (e.g. \"literal period\")\n\n*Force quit all apps. and reopen the one you are using to dictate to.\n\n*make a new sentence and say the phrase \"literal period\" and you should now get the word \"period\" in the sentence instead of \".\"\nTo conclude, this works for EVERYTHING. Proper Names, fantasy/sci-fi content, technical terminology, etc. \n\nA: You are so correct. Dictation around this is really bad and the algorithm seems highly skewed to always prefer punctuation.\n\n\n*\n\n*That movie was a very nice period piece.\n\n*Even the period penguin trick is problematic. (although the idea of an accounting penguin makes me surprisingly happy)\n\n*The periodic table of elements is often punctuated.\n\n\nReading any of these will get you lots of dots. Anecdotally, I feel my iPad Pro (the new one with the A12X) and the iPhoneX and newer have better dictation than any Mac or older iOS device, but reading the three sentences above - several times, slowly, in a low noise environment makes me think most people aren't going to be getting the word period when they want it while dictating in 2019.\n", "Q: Can a child's device be controlled by multiple family members? Surprisingly, not all children live solely with one guardian. Is there any way that a child's device can be controlled by more than one adult?\nThe situation: My ex-wife and I have 50/50 custody of our kids, and our 13-year-old has an iPhone SE. He has an Apple ID linked to my own and Family Sharing is set up for the two of us. To help reinforce healthy phone habits, I have all extraneous apps (Instagram, Youtube, etc.) restricted by default, and only turn them on when he is specifically allowed to be using them. However, he's at his mother's place half the time, so if he wants to use his phone she has to contact me to allow them, then again when time's up. Fortunately, we are co-parenting fairly well and have very open communication when it comes to the kids, so it's not a big deal in that regard, but it's extremely inconvenient, and I'm not always able to stop what I'm doing and turn on his apps immediately.\nIs it possible to associate his Apple ID with hers and add him to her Family Sharing group as well? Alternatively, if I add her as a family member to my group, can I give her the same full parental control access as me?\n\nA: Your child's account can only be associated with one Family Sharing group at a time. The best solution would be to add your ex-wife to your Family Sharing. There's an option to mark an account as a Parent/Guardian, which gives that person authority to approve requests from a Child account in the Family.\n", "Q: Can you stop marketing messages on an iPhone X (e-sim) On Android, to avoid the marketing popup messages from the SIM Toolkit, I need to force stop it, and everytime I reboot, I need to force stop it again.\nOn iPhone X, with the e-sim, what happens to the popup marketing messages?

the normal volume and its structure which the script has made presumptions to use.\nYour root file system in recovery mode is a different volume and not the normal one used in normal use.  \nYou will likely be better off in normal mode, or booting to single user mode and then running the script.\nF.\n\nA: Are these two scripts?  Did you run both?  I've lost context.  If you typed these commands in at the terminal should see the commands in the output, but I haven't been able to find the commands.\nYou should place your usb stick in your machine before booting. \nI think the problem is that the commands you are attempting to use don't run in the bare single user mode.  \nLet's assume you are booted in single user mode. You need to do next:\nfsck –fy\nmount –uw /\n\n# diskutil mountDisk both usb stick and internal HD\nIn single user mode, your startup disk is now in read/write mode.  You should place your usb stick in your machine before booting. In 10.4.11, when booting in single user mode, the flash drive was automatically mounted. Let's assume it still is. Things may have changed.

Would an external GPU allow a late 2014 mac mini run a 4k display at 60Hz? \nOr would the CPU in the mac mini prevent this.\n\nA: In theory, yes - an eGPU could allow you to run a 4k display at 60 Hz. It depends on the specific eGPU (i.e. which graphics card is actually plugged into the breakout box).\nThe CPU in your Mac Mini is not going to be the limiting factor for running 4k at 60 Hz in itself. However, it might be that some games/applications that you would like to run do not run with optimal performance on that Mac Mini. You'll have to test and judge yourself.\nThe reason I say \"in theory\" is because Apple has made it so that eGPU support on the latest macOS requires Thunderbolt 3. Your Late 2014 Mac Mini only has Thunderbolt 2, so it is not officially supported.\nSome community scripts exists to allow eGPU on Thunderbolt 2, but obviously the performance is not going to be the same.\n", "Q: Battery Not Charging, remains at 0% I have an Early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina, which I hard-restarted earlier (holding the power button) due to a software crash. It turned off just fine but refused to turn back on again (no backlight, no drive noise, nothing). I thought I remembered a fairly high battery percentage, but to be sure I connected it to power and tried again, unsuccessfully. I left it for a while, then tried an SMC reset with the adapter connected. \nThis seemed to work, since the power indicator light turned green for a few seconds (which makes sense). This somewhat fixed the issue in that the machine actually showed signs of life when I tried turning it back on, but it would just display a black screen with the red/white low battery symbol and the lightning bolt underneath it. \nI left it charging for a while and then had to disconnect it for about an hour to take it with me. When I plugged it back in, it actually powered on and booted up successfully. However, the battery indicator is now perpetually at 0%, and the battery info is rather disturbing:\nBattery Information:\nModel Information:\n\n  Manufacturer: SMP\n  Pack Lot Code:    0\n  PCB Lot Code: 0\n  Firmware Version: 702\n  Hardware Revision:    1\n  Cell Revision:    3217\n\nCharge Information:\n\n  Charge Remaining (mAh):   0\n  Fully Charged:    No\n  Charging: No\n  Full Charge Capacity (mAh):   1708\n  Health Information:\n  Cycle Count:  564\n  Condition:    Replace Now\n  Battery Installed:    Yes\n  Amperage (mA):    0\n  Voltage (mV): 8421\n\nI've also tried an NVRAM reset, with no change.

It came in a refurbished box, but they insist it was 'new' How do I know if this really is new or used? When I received the MacBook, it was in a 2016 refurbished apple MacBook Pro box even though the MacBook I received is a 2017 version. Are there any options that I have, to confirm whether this is a new or refurbished Mac?\nI saw online that I can ask Apple to check the serial number and see if its ever been registered with someone else other than me. Will that work? Can I go to the Apple store and ask them to verify it for me? \nOther than that, I received the MacBook exactly as I bought it; exact specs. I just thought that maybe they took the MacBook out of the original boxing and put it in a older box, but why would they do that, and why would they use an older box? \nPlease help me out. \nEdit: I checked the battery cycle, and its at 4. Is that substantial? (Do new Macs come with a battery cycle like that?)\nJust for reference, I bought this from Other World Computing. \n\nA: If the cycle count was 4, that means the battery on the laptop has gone through the equivalent of 4 complete discharges and recharges. Certainly only very lightly used, but not brand new.\n\nA: The following answer is based on my interpretation of US law relevant to this question as the reseller identified is a US based vendor and those laws would be applicable to them.  Check the laws applicable to your country.\n\nWhen I received the MacBook, it was in a 2016 refurbished Apple MacBook Pro box. (Even though the MacBook I received is a 2017 version).\n\nTo me, this sounds like it should be classified as either \"open box\" or \"refurbished.\"  The question is, how did they advertise it?\nIf they represented it as \"new\" and it showed up as you describe, that would be considered deceptive (15 USC § 45)1.  If however, they stated it was \"new OEM purchase\" (new but not in retail packaging) or \"new, open box\" and clearly said so, more than likely it would pass as legit.\nCompanies can, in fact, take opened products and repackage them as new so long as there is a conspicuous process to validate that it is actually unused.2\nOn OWC's website (MacSales.com) they have a \"new\" listing for a Mac Pro in which they state \"factory sealed.\"\n\nHypothetically speaking, if you purchased this computer and it showed up in a \"refurbished box\" as you describe, it could be considered deceptive.  It boils down to how was it advertised and what you actually received.\n\nI can ask Apple to check the serial number and see if its ever been registered with someone else other than me. Will that work?\n\nIt's a good step, but not conclusive.\nIn other words, it can be proof positive that it was used if there was a registration but alternatively, give you a false negative if it was used but never registered.\n\nI checked the battery cycle, and its at 4. Is that substantial? (Do new Macs come with a battery cycle like that?)\n\nNo, that is not substantial at all.\nIt's not uncommon for vendors to charge their devices so that the \"unboxing\" experience\" is a positive one which would include getting a device with a charge substantial enough for you to immediately use it.  Remember, you're purchasing a 2017 model at the end of 2018 so, theoretically, it could have been sitting around for a year.\n\nTL;DR\nCaveat Emptor.\nBuy from a trusted source, not the cheapest.  If you are not comfortable with the deal you got and there's a lingering voice in your head questioning whether or not you were deceived, return it.  The few extra dollars you're going to spend on that peace of mind will be well worth it.\nTo put this into perspective, I have the technical ability to tear down a Mac and actually replace components at the board level.  I still wouldn't buy something advertised as \"new\" from a source I wasn't sure about.  To me, it's not worth the time, money or hassle.\nNone of the above should be construed as legal advice.  I am not a lawyer nor do I play one on TV.\n\n1 15 U.S. Code § 45 - Unfair methods of competition unlawful; prevention by Commission\n2 FTC Staff Advisory Opinion Offers Guidance on New Products\n\nA: Your case is quite suspicious. The fact that it is at 4 battery cycles is to much. It should be 1 or 2. \nAnd yes you can check the serial number but taking it to an Apple store is not necessary.\nJust find the serial number and go to:\nhttps://checkcoverage.apple.com\nYou will be asked to enter it here:\n\nThen you can see if it has been activated.\nThe box is also quite suspicious.

Therefore I thought of moving windows 10 to one disk and leave os x on the \"main drive\" might be a good idea (just in case of possible future drive problems to fix them more easily). Although, Mac lists them both as internal drives, I firstly wasn't able to install it via Bootcamp on the second drive, so I installed windwos without Bootcamp directly on the drive using efi boot. Unfortunately efi boot isn't completely supported on this MBP model, (soundcard and TB2 for external displays don't work) but at least everything else worked that way!\nThis is why I turned the efi boot into a bios boot.\nIt worked perfectly, when only the drive with windows was inserted but when I added the second drive with os x, suddenly booting into Windows wasn't possible anymore! I did a little research and found out, that windows obviously needs to be on the \"first\" drive (disk0) to start. So, I shuffled the SSDs and was immediately able to boot windows again. Happy that I finally reached my goal I switched to os x. \nBut when I tried to boot back into windows it didn't work again. \nI tried to recreate the boot files for windows with \"bcdboot\" and also created a startup partition on the os x drive of 200MB with the windows boot files but it's still not working.\nSo now I don't know what to do anymore! I don't want to shuffle (or unmount) the disks every time I want to use windows!\nIs there a possibility to do a work around for that problem? (A virtual machine is no possible solution as I'm in need of full RAM capacity).\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Below is a excerpt From page 6 of the Boot Camp Installation & Setup Guide (Copyright 2011). These instructions do change significantly with the next release of the Boot Camp Installation & Setup Guide (Copyright 2013).\n\nIf you have a Mac Pro with more than one internal disk and you want to install Boot Camp on a disk that isn’t in the first hard drive bay, remove the drives in the lower numbered bays. You can reinstall the drives after you install Boot Camp.\n\nBack in 2011, all Macs were still BIOS booting Windows. Although the excerpt does not explicitly say Mac Pro's where the only models that could BIOS boot from a second internal drive, this was already generally known to be true. So, the answer to your question is your 2012 MBP can not natively BIOS boot from the second internal drive.\nrEFInd is a Boot Manager. This means rEFInd does not actually boot operating systems. Instead, rEFInd saves information in the nvram. The Mac firmware reads this information to determine which operating system to load. The means rEFInd can to be directly used to BIOS boot windows from a second internal drive.\nOn the other hand, GRUB 2 is a boot loader. You may be able to BIOS boot GRUB on the primary drive and configure GRUB to boot Windows on the second internal drive.\n", "Q: Anyway to find out what program is asking for admin credentials?

Just don't know where to begin.\n\nA: I don't think it has a public, catchy \"name\" as such. Apple seems to refer to it is as an \"optical label\", but that is a very generic term.\nThe technology can be thought of very much like an animated QR-code. The main principle of data encoding is very much like QR-codes, but obviously with the difference that as time goes forward, the displayed data changes as an animation.\nIn addition there seems to be the use of a neat trick with two different colors shown in quick alternation, which makes it possible for Apple to \"hide\" or make less obvious the clues that are used for the receiver of the data to synchronize with the signal (i.e. figure out where the boundaries of the encoded data is).\nWith a traditional QR code these sync markers are much more evident as they are big black square boxes with white borders that are set different places in the code to make it easy for the receiver to figure out what's encoded data, and what's not part of the code.\nYou can learn more from Apple's patent applications:\nUS Patent 9,022,291\nUS Patent 9,022,292\n\nA: Apple Watch 'particle cloud' pairing method is a patented method by Apple for pairing Apple Watch and Home Pod.

I've personally had it happen that the iCloud authentication servers just could not be reached for a while, so I was scratching my head for quite a bit until it all of a sudden worked...\nAssuming that's not the case for you here, the first step to do would be to ensure that the phone is no longer associated with the apple id of your friend. For this your friend should go here, log in and ensure the device is not listed anymore (if it is, remove it). Something that I noticed is that this doesn't necessarily remove the device from \"Find my iPhone\" in iCloud, so your friend should probably also go to iCloud and verify (and possibly remove) it's gone there as well. Make sure to have them do so under \"Find my iPhone\" (or whatever it's called in English, I'm on the German equivalent atm) and in the \"Settings\".\nUnfortunately I can't guarantee this does the trick, as said I've had weird sign in problems in the past as well, so this is just a hunch.

I want to have to enter a password to rename, delete, move the dmg file without it having opened.\n\nA: To keep the .dmg file from being deleted without explicit permission, you need to set the ACL permissions for the file to not be deleted. In Terminal use, e.g.:\nsudo chmod +a \"everyone deny delete\" foobar.dmg\n\nOnce set, if you try to rename, delete, or move the .dmg file, e.g. in Finder, you'll have to enter Administrator credentials, or in Terminal use sudo, which requires the same level of credentials too, to do the same.\n\nIn Terminal, have a look at the manual page for chmod, e.g., type man chmod and press Enter, or just type chmod and right-click on it selecting, Open man Page.\n\n\n*\n\n*In general, I'd read then entire man page however, the section titled ACL MANIPULATION OPTIONS is the relevant one to focus on.\n\n\nTo see what ACL permissions are set on a file/folder,  use, e.g.:\n$ ls -le foobar.dmg\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 me  staff  100020736 Dec  7 09:21 foobar.dmg\n0: group:everyone deny delete\n$\n\n", "Q: iMac 2017 - Apple Wireless Keyboard 2 and Magic Mouse 2 Bluetooth random disconnects After having the first iMac 2017 Retina replaced for display issues, my second one seems to be acting up.\nI use an apple wireless keyboard and magic mouse 2 via Bluetooth.

Hopefully this will finally resove the issue.\n\nA: Try searching for potential sources for Bluetooth interference\nAccording to this Apple Support article a reason for this could be Bluetooth interference.\nThese can interfere with the signal:\nMicrowave Ovens\nWireless Speakers\nDirect Satellite Service\nCertain external monitors and LCD displays\nPower sources\nPoorly shielded cabling\n2.4 GHz or 5 GHz phones\nWireless RF video\nAccording to another Support Article, several materials can interfere with connections:\nWood    Low\nSynthetic material  Low\nGlass   Low\nWater   Medium\nBricks  Medium\nMarble  Medium\nPlaster High\nConcrete    High\nBulletproof glass   High\nMetal   Very high\nAlso try:\nKeep wireless devices within 10 meters (approximately 30 feet) of your Mac.\nAvoid putting metal objects between your wireless device and your Mac.\n\nA: I had this same problem and seem to have resolved it. This is my anecdote, which someone might find helpful.\nTL;DR In my case it seems to have been caused by a gaming framework, either Steam or NVidia GeForce Now. Removing those caused the problem to go away.\nI have a 2017 iMac running Mojave 10.14.4. The initial problem was that sometimes the bluetooth keyboard and mouse would disconnect all of the sudden. They always disconnected together. Sometimes they'd reconnect right away. Sometimes I'd have to fiddle around--turn the bluetooth off/on, turn the devices off/on, or occasionally reboot the computer.\nI also noticed that when this happened and I tried to turn the bluetooth off/on through the menu bar, the bluetooth icon would sometimes hang in a reverse-video state. My impression was that the computer's motherboard might be having trouble communicating with the bluetooth module.\nThe computer is still under warranty, so I took it to the Apple Store. They ran a diagnostic and couldn't find a problem. But based on my description, the genius took the computer in to replace the bluetooth module. I got it back a few days later, and the problem kept occurring.\nBack to the Apple Store a week later. A different genius suggested wiping and reinstalling the OS, saying that's what they should have done the first time before replacing any hardware. So we did that. After reinstalling the OS, he told me to take it home and reinstall all of my files from my Time Machine backup. I took the computer home, reinstalled from Time Machine, and used it over the next week. The problem was still present.\nBack to the Apple Store again. The third genius wanted to wipe and reinstall the OS, and then not restore from time machine. This would rule out the chance that the time machine restore was installing something which was causing the problem.\nI was getting annoyed by this time, as I was pretty sure the computer had a hardware problem. We discussed replacing the motherboard, but he didn't want to do that without a lot more troubleshooting.\nIn the end, we wiped and reinstalled the OS again. After getting the computer home, I just reinstalled a couple of apps that I couldn't do without, then used the computer for a week. The bluetooth worked perfectly the entire time. After that, I wiped and reinstalled the OS again and restored from Time Machine. The problem came back.\nSo, the bluetooth problem was due to something I had installed, which was being reinstated by restoring from Time Machine.

I want to set Time machine interval to 15 minutes, instead of Apple default 1hr.\nWhat I want is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time machine Interval of 15 minutes.\n\n*Time machine backup should respect battery/power status, meaning backup should not occur while not connected to power.\n\n\nI tried sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 1800 but it doesn't work.\nI also tried disabling csrutil and modified /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-helper.plist's Interval, Delay, GracePeriod but it also does not work.\nHow can I configure that in Mojave? (Currently running 10.14.2)\n\nA: NVM I figured it out.\nThis is a great timing to finish the answer, right? ...No? Okay I'll show you what was the problem then...\nWhat is required to do that in Mojave is:\n\n\n*\n\n*disable csrutil.\n\n*sudo vi /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-helper.plist, and then edit Interval, Delay, GracePeriod.

You were going to re-enable csrutil anyway, right?\n\n\nAfter that, time machine prefpane will still say it's going to backup 1hr after last backup, but automatic backup happens 15 mins later in my case.\n\nA: Try the free utility TimeMachineEditor.  It allows you to set just about any kind of schedule you want.  Way easier and way more versatile than manually editing files.\n\nA: If you're sure this is something that you want to do, I think the best way to try it is to use the tmutil (Time Machine utility).\nQuoting man tmutil\n\nstartbackup\nBegin a backup if one is not already running.\nOptions:\n   --auto           Run the backup in a mode similar to system-scheduled backups.\n   --block          Wait (block) until the backup is finished before exiting.\n   --rotation       Allow automatic destination rotation during the backup.\n   --destination    Perform the backup to the destination corresponding to the specified ID.\nThe --auto option provides a supported mechanism with which to trigger \"automatic-like\" backups, similar to automatic backups that are scheduled by the system. While this is not identical to true system-scheduled backups, it provides custom schedulers the ability to achieve some (but not all) behavior normally exhibited when operating in automatic mode.\n\nCombine that with launchd and you can have tmutil run every 15 minutes, take this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.tjluoma.time-machine-intervals</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/bin/tmutil</string>\n        <string>startbackup</string>\n        <string>--auto</string>\n        <string>--rotation</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/com.tjluoma.time-machine-intervals.stderr.log</string>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/com.tjluoma.time-machine-intervals.stdout.log</string>\n    <key>StartInterval</key>\n    <integer>900</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nand save it as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tjluoma.time-machine-intervals.plist and then load it into launchd with this command in Terminal:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tjluoma.time-machine-intervals.plist\nHere's how it looks in LaunchControl which is my favorite app for working with launchd plists:\n\n\nA: Just spent quite a bit of time researching how to perform this stuff via Terminal one-liners, and, this is what I came up with.\n\n\n*\n\n*You still need to disable SIP (boot into Recovery Mode by pressing CMD+R at boot, opening Terminal there (from the Utilities Tab at the top) and running csrutil disable and then reboot)\n\n*Back in the main os, the file of interest is at /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-helper.plist \n\n*To modify, for example, the Interval value (from default of 1h=3600 to 2h=7200), you would run\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :LaunchEvents:com.apple.xpc.activity:com.apple.backupd-auto:Interval 7200\" /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-helper.plist\n", "Q: applescript : add clipboard content to list Can I create a list from the clipboard?\nLet's say my clipboard is `name email phone and any random number of text\nCan the words be separated and added in a list?\nAlso the item can be either text and numbers, but I guess the best way would be to do a text delimiter by space?\n\nA: \nLet's say my clipboard is \"name email phone\" and any random text and numbers.\nCan the words be separated and added in a list?\n\nYou don't realise it, but you've answered your own question.\nTL;DR\nSay your clipboard contains the string \"Kevin stackexchange.com 124098\".  Separate this into a list of words like so:\nwords of (the clipboard) --> {\"Kevin\", \"stackexchange.com\", \"124098\"}\n\nYou can read more about this builtin AppleScript feature below, where I've given a detailed explanation, including why, sadly, this won't be quite as effective if an email address is involved:\nwords of \"Kevin@example.com\" --> {\"Kevin\", \"example.com\"}\n\nSo you'll either need to remember to restore the obliterated \"@\" symbol later; or, as you suggested, use text item delimiters set to a space character.\nDetailed Information: text item delimiters vs words\nAppleScript text objects are comprised of word and character elements that subdivide one another into the component building blocks of any string: text subdivides into words and/or characters; a word subdivides into characters.\nMoreover, the words subdivide text at intervals marked by whitespace of any length, which is much more convenient than text item delimiters, which will split a string at each individual occurrence of a specified delimiter.\nFor example, setting text item delimiters to the space character, and applying it to a two-word phrase with three spaces between them, you'll end up with this:\ntext items of \"foo   bar\" --> {\"foo\", \"\", \"\", \"bar\"}\n\nHowever, obtaining instead the words that make up the string avoids having to deal with empty-string list items:\nwords of \"foo   bar\" --> {\"foo\", \"bar\"}\n\nMoreover, like text items, words of a text object will subdivide the string naturally into a list of individual items.\nFor completeness, I'll quickly demonstrate how characters will decompose a string:\ncharacters of \"foo\"       --> {\"f\", \"o\", \"o\"}\ncharacters of \"foo   bar\" --> {\"f\", \"o\", \"o\", \" \", \" \", \" \", \"b\", \"a\", \"r\"}\n\nA bit of caution is warranted when decomposing a string into words, believing it operates identically (or near enough) to a space delimiter.  It doesn't.  There are a defined set of characters that are considered \"word characters\", and a set of characters that are not.  \"Word characters\" are any character that, when grouped together, are considered word-forming.  If any non-word character appears, the word is considered split into two distinct words at that character.\nWord characters basically include the letters A-Z and a-z (and any accented variants), numbers 0-9, the period (.) and the underscore (_).  So \"tH1s\" is a word, and \"this_is_a_single_word.123\".  However, \"this#is%four words\", and, counterintuitively to me, \"over-achieving\" is considered two words (the hyphen is a non-word character).\nOther non-word characters obviously include the space; or any whitespace for that matter.  Plus any symbol you can type with your keyboard that wasn't included in the list of word characters, except the dollar sign ($), which I annoyingly left to now to mention just to reflect how annoying it is that it's randomly considered a word character:\nwords of \"hello#$&world\" --> {\"hello\", \"$\", \"world\"}\n\n", "Q: Is Windows 10 32 bit good for iMac 4,1 running Bootcamp? I have an iMac 4,1, 2Gb RAM and installed Bootcamp. \nIs Windows 10 Home Premium 32 bit good for that machine? Or is it too heavy, better install Windows 7 Home Basic 32 bit?\n\nA: The latest supported Windows version for that machine is Windows 7, 32-bit.\nThere will be no drivers available for Windows 10.\nRef: Everymac\n\nA: Your Mac meets the minimum requirements to run Windows 7 and 10. Generally, Windows 7 (SP1) requires a product key to download and install. Windows 10 does not. In either case, if you wish to keep Windows after a trial period, you will need to purchase a license. OS X does not have to be installed on the Mac before installing or using Windows, provided you have the Snow Leopard DVD. You could also install both versions of Windows as a dual boot. This way you could boot each and compare speed and features. With dual boot, you first install Windows 7 in one partition, then Windows 10 in a different partition. The Windows 10 installer will automatically setup the dual boot software.\nSince Windows 10 did not exist when Snow Leopard was released, you will probably need to run the Boot Camp Support Software installer in Windows 7 compatibility mode. If this still does not work, then consider first installing Windows 7, then the Boot Camp Support Software, and finally upgrading to Windows 10.\nWhen running a newer version of Windows that is not officially supported by Apple, you will often find the Device Manager will show errors. Usually, these errors are generated by redundant hardware that is not used anyway. One solution is to provide a null driver which effectively just removes the errors from being displayed in the Device Manager. If your Mac appears to work properly, then the simplest solution is just to ignore the displayed errors. This problem is not unique to Macs, the same is true for all other of machines capable of running Windows. \n", "Q: Strange .userchain file on my Mojave desktop \n*\n\n*Mac Pro (early 2009) 4,1 -> 5,1\n\n*macOS 10.14.2 via DosDude1\n\n\nI have a strange hidden text file on my Desktop called .userchain.

Each block is separated by a tab character and there is a final solitary \\ character at the end. \nThe file is being used by something because the modified date is yesterday afternoon, though I cannot remember what I was doing at the time!\nRunning file on the file path indicates that it was created on Sun Sep  2 02:02:05 2018.

If in the future you launch it again, it'll just recreate the .userchain text file.\nLikewise, if you've totally removed the software, it's also safe to remove.\n", "Q: Bootcamp Error: The startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition Earlier today, I tried to install a Boot Camp installation of Windows 10, but there was an error and was removing the partitions it made, but I accidentally closed the window and now I'm stuck with an extra partition. \nWhen I run diskutil list, this is what I get:\n\nFYI, this is a MacBook Pro 13 inch (base model) with Mojave 10.14.1.\nWhat can I do to get my drive back to normal (with just the Macos installation)?\n\nA: Here is the commands you need to enter in a Terminal application window.\nsudo diskutil eraseVolume free none disk0s4\nsudo diskutil eraseVolume free none disk0s3\nsudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\nThese commands will have removed the Windows partitions and expanded the macOS partition to recover the free space.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: Your going to have to get into your machine to set up screen sharing. The only way that I can figure is to take the drive out and place it in some other machine.  I suggest placing the drive in an external drive enclosure.

It prevents most people from doing things to their computer that would make it unusable or disable built-in functionality.\nPretty much any app that comes with macOS can't be deleted, unless you disable SIP. Even then if you do disable SIP (It's not hard a quick search will turn up lots of instructions to do so) the next time Apple updates macOS it is likely to return.\nGenerally disabling SIP is not a great idea as, among other things, it can protect against certain types of malware that try to modify core system files and resources.\nSo, if you want to, that app can be deleted. But you will have to disable SIP first, and me, I wouldn't do it.

I have a ~500GB Time Machine partition I'd like to shrink slightly. My internal source partition is around 400GB.\nResizing the partition would be extremely slow, since Disk Utility has to check all the hard links Time Machine is using behind the scenes. On the other hand, simply wiping it and backing up again from scratch would also be extremely slow.\nIs one or the other generally going to be faster? Is there some disk size tipping point at which it becomes more economical to switch strategies?\n(I'm using an SSD internally and a spinning hard drive externally, connected over USB 3. Both the source and the destination are encrypted. Also, I have a second backup disk, so if I wipe and back up again I won't be temporarily unprotected.)\n\nA: Unfortunately, I cannot give a catch-all answer. So my suggestion is to resize the partition, and, chances are that that may be faster. But if I'm being truthful, there are too many variables to determine which method would be objectively better at which sizes and such. Sometimes, these things will just take their time and no matter how you do it, you will be spending a significant amount of time waiting, so yes.

Supposedly this console command will add my private SSH key to the Apple Keychain, as discussed in this Answer on the Question, How to use Mac OS X Keychain with SSH keys?:\nssh-add -K path-to-my-private-key-for-SSH\n\nIf that succeeds…\n➥ What is the type and name of the entry to be found in the Keychain Access.app?\nI would like to be able to manually verify and possibly delete that entry.\n\nA: If you key is not passphrase protected, it looks like macOS won't add it to the Keychain. Presumably this is because the only thing the keychain stores is the passphrase. Everything else seems to require messing with the ~/.ssh/config file.\nIf your ssh key is passphrase protected, running ssh-add -K path/to/key adds your passphrase to your keychain as a generic password prepended with \"SSH:\". Also, as for remembering keys, starting with macOS Sierra, Apple chose to stop remembering keys by default.

I've seen multiple questions were people are told you can't really use one port but it depends on your adapter and how you use it. I have a startech USB-C to 3 HDMI adapter:\n\nAnd I've been using this adapter for my Dell XPS 13 9630 to connect to 2 external monitors and it works perfectly fine. Doesn't support 3rd monitor of course. \nSo I connected my Macbook Pro 15 2018 to the same adapter and the two monitors are mirrored. Been looking a bit online and it seems like people say you have to use different ports on the macbook. And I'm really surprised to see that a 3 times cheaper Dell XPS can handle two monitors through one port, but the macbook only sees it as one external monitor. \nIdeally I'd want to have 3 FullHD monitors connected to this adapter, but I has to support at least 2 simultaneous monitors. \nSo does anyone know how do I get them to work through one adapter? \n\nA: The Startech adapter you've got works as a MST (Multi-Stream Transport) hub. MST is a part of the DisplayPort 1.2 standard, which makes it possible for monitors and computers to support \"daisy-chaining\".\nDaisy-chaining is most often seen where the monitor has both an input and output DisplayPort adapter, allowing you to connect the first monitor to the computer, and the second monitor to the first monitor. If both monitor and computer support MST daisy-chaining the two displays will act as seperate displays, exactly like if they had been plugged in directly to the computer. Note however that the monitors share bandwidth, so you wouldn't be able to have them at the same resolutions and refresh rates as possible when using seperate cables connected to the computer.\nThe problem for you is that macOS does not support MST daisy-chaining. I believe this is a software limitation and not a hardware limitation. Instead macOS supports daisy-chaining Thunderbolt monitors (such as with the Apple Thunderbolt Monitor).\nTherefore it is not possible to get your StarTech adapter working with macOS. Indeed StarTech also lists that it is only compatible with (some) Windows PCs.\nHowever it is certainly possible to connect two Full-HD displays to a single of the Type-C ports on the 2018 MacBook Pro. These ports are really Thunderbolt 3 ports, so you have a lot of options here. You can buy both adapters as well as full-fledged Thundebolt 3 docks that allows connecting multiple displays over DisplayPort/HDMI as well as adding extra USB-A, USB-C, Firewire, Ethernet, Audio, eSATA or other connections as well as SD-card readers, etc. Some of these even supply power to the MacBook Pro so that you can charge your MacBook Pro over the same, single cable.\nAn example of such a product is the OWC Thunderbolt 3 14-port dock:\nhttps://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt-3-dock-14-port\nThey also have other variants such as a 12-ports dock and a dock with FireWire 800.\nYou can also get similar products from Belkin, Elgato, Caldigit, Iogear, etc. Even StarTech produces one (same make as your adapter):\nhttps://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-TB3DKM2DP-Thunderbolt-Dock-DisplayPort/dp/B07BJJX47G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=reality&linkId=b1418a14da750a87c5d7c2a099401212\nThat is a $123.99 dock/adapter with 2 DisplayPort, 1 USB-A and 1 ethernet connectors.\n", "Q: Crash/restore renamed SSD system disk and emptied I had what I think was a \"system crash\" of my 500 GB SSD that was my system disk. I now think it was because a keyboard malfunction was preventing proper boot operations. I have a 2008 MacPro running 10.11(El-Cap). I needed to boot in Recovery Mode and restore from Time Machine. Then the Applications folder was completely empty, leaving me with a rather useless machine. I found the Time Machine files (in the Backups.backupdb folder of an external drive) and one by one have partially repopulated the Applications folder with Finder and a few other apps (including Chrome with which I am doing this) from a older TM section of the backups, since the recent backups appeared empty in /Applicatiosn and /Library/Frameworks. The system disk used to be named SSD_1 and that's how it appears on my backup displayed in Time Machine, but it currently appears as \"Macintosh HD2\" in Finder. This which used to be the location of my Time Machine image before installing the SSD. There's also the old Macintosh HD displayed in the Devices side panel, which when you look at it with Get Info appears as \"Macintosh HD 1\". I'm a bit worried that a clean system install will trash all my applications. I'm also concerned that my \"past end of life\" machine won't get the right OS files from the Apple servers.\nIdeas: 1) Use Get Info on the SSD to rename the startup SSD as \"SSD_1\" so that it matches the entry in the Time Machine backup files. Then <somehow> \"bless\" that drive to use archaic Mac terminology.\n2) Or should I clean reinstall. Not even sure I can. Would need to do it over the network and this box is past Apple's end of life rules. This was originally a Lion machine IIRC. I'm not sure what the latest physical medium that holds a DVD image and my DVD door is stuck in the closed position anyway.\nUpdate: As I use Time Machine more to see what's missing, I'm now seeing my old applications and contents of the Frameworks folder at least in the TimeMachine folders (but not on the \"real\" disk) . So apparently I was not waiting long enough to see the folder display get updated? Can I now use Finder and right-click/GetInfo to rename the SSD to it's old name and then restore from Time Machine? And how does MacOS determine the boot drive?\nEventually, I ended up buying a new Apple-branded keyboard and the system all came back as it used to be, except for renaming the SSD device. The answer below is correct in suggesting I make a recovery disk.\n\nA: Both the directories you lost indicate you should pretty much immediately boot to recovery and re-apply the OS version you had.\nYou can't trust any tools if frameworks are damaged and you can't trust the apps to fix things if they're compromised.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to recovery and verify you have a good recovery (internet or otherwise) and have internet while in recovery.\n\n*Run Disk Utility (from recovery) to repair the drive until there are no errors.\n\n*Confirm your backup mounts while in recovery so you know you have a good backup before proceeding. Back anything up that's not good before proceeding.\n\n*Run the OS installer to write known good new /Applications and /Library - that will run migration after the blank /Application is run to copy over all the apps / users / settings you have.\n\n*Consider checking the install.log for errors and then test the machine to be sure you don't need to recover things from the backup.\n\n\nPretty clear case where you'll have to do this eventually - so I wouldn't waste time on not verifying your backup and not reinstalling a known good system. Trying to figure what happened will just delay getting a known good set of apps and frameworks re-installed - then you can look over what failed if you care to.\nYou can also make your Recovery HD on another computer if needed. 2008 MacPro likely can't internet recovery and any recovery will let you reinstall 10.11 but you may have to choose that if you can't just install the latest OS your hardware supports.\n", "Q: Macbook's Arabic keyboard layout mistakes and missing characters!

I don't have any uploads running neither system updates so I cannot understand what is causing this issue.\nI have checked on the router if I can limit the bandwidth but this cannot be done. I have also tried to reset network settings without success.\nThe iPhone was bought in the states (I think) and I am using it with a wifi for th Italian market. Could this cause the problem?\nAny suggestions appreciated.\n\nA: You'll want to check the diagnostics offered by the router.\nIn some cases your router could be \"beam forming\" to maximise bandwidth to a single device (such as a laptop). If you have relatively bad conditions, this could be necessary to get good speeds. By bad conditions I mean for example neighbouring WiFis networks interfering, noise from other equipment, big distances between router and device or objects blocking the signal (walls for example).\nIf you add another device to the network, such as the iPhone, the router could be forced to stop \"beam forming\" because you have too many units connected or similar. That could give you worse performance on the existing units, even though the iPhone is not transmitting/receiving any actual data.\n", "Q: Safe to use USB-C Charger (adapter) for Macbook Air 2013? Ok I have a company MacBook Pro that has a USB-C charger and a personal MacBook Air 2013. I have an adapter that I use to connect all things on Pro: \nMy Air charger stop to respond. Can I use the USB-C charger with this adapter to charge the Air?\n\nA: No, it's not possible to do that. The adapter you have pictured is the Nonda USB-C to USB-A adapter. It is commonly used for connecting older USB-A hardware (such as USB pen drives) to newer USB-C computers.\nOne of the big differences between USB-A and USB-C is that USB-A does not allow for transferring enough power to charge a laptop (i.e. it is limited to only few watts compared to USB-C). In addition USB-A is used to charge devices from the computer - not the other way around.\nI have seen multiple adapters for using old MagSafe chargers with new USB-C computers. Unfortunately, I haven't seen any for charging old MagSafe 2 computers with a USB-C charger.\n\nA: That will not work on MBA 2013,\nIt has only one port where you can charge it (the magsafe plug).\nYou will need new power charger for your MB Air 2013.\nAbout USB...\ntill the USB/C came out the USB were only data ports (with 5 Volt) and could not handle the power needed to charge a Mac.\nTo charge your 2013 MacBook Air you need 16-18 Volts input and correct 5 pins plug.\n", "Q: Browsers Keep popping phishing websites (I think) I have a 2017 MBP, Recently a friend of mine installed Logic Pro X via a torrent.

How can I get rid of it?\n\nA: Macperfomance is malware advertising mackeeper, so first of all keep yourself out of this soft, never install mackeeper.\nIn order to clean this shit your should first delete file mackeeper.plist and all other files you can't recognize as your desired software from folders /library/LaunchAgents,  /library/LaunchDaemons,  /users/%yourusername%/library/LaunchAgents\nAfter that close all your apps and reboot your Mac\n", "Q: Disk Utility hangs after adding a partition with gpt; diskutil still works just fine I'm trying to shrink my Time Machine partition to make more space for Windows games. The shrink went perfectly, but I was left with a chunk of free space Disk Utility wouldn't let me make a partition in. I would have to delete the free space and make a new partition.\nI couldn't figure out how to get it to not resize my Time Machine partition again, and diskutil doesn't seem to be able to create new partitions from scratch, only split and merge them. So I turned to gpt using this answer.\nAfter running gpt add -b 1739919576 -s 88606504 -t hfs disk2, Disk Utility could see the new empty partition just fine.

(The iPad Wi-Fi + Cellular model has GPS built-in and can use it even without a SIM card plugged-in).\nGoogle Maps downloads and caches the maps from the area you are in when you search something.

I'll suggest looking at alternative options, such as buying a dual-layer disk, or simply using a different storage medium such as a USB pen-drive or an external USB hard drive.\nThe reasons this type of DMG don't compress are for example:\n1) Apple has already used compression on most relevant parts of the installer image - so there's not really much left to compress.\n2) The disk image size is really irrelevant - the important is how much space it takes up on the DVD, and I'm afraid compressing the DMG won't change that. What you write onto the DVD is not a bit-for-bit copy of the DMG, but rather it would be uncompressed before writing onto the DMG. If not, it wouldn't be bootable nor useable for installing macOS.\n", "Q: Move SoftRAID to a new home We have 3x4TB 3.5\" HD's in RAID 5 (SoftRAID) in a 2012 MacPro tower.\nIs it possible to physically remove them and insert them into a larger enclosure and it will continue operating?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to move a SoftRAID array of disks from the internal drive bays of a MacPro and into an external enclosure connected to the same computer. You might have to do a small reconfiguration to ensure that it \"finds\" the array, but if you have used proper disk labelling it should be pretty much automatic.\nNote that it is important that the external enclosure supports JBOD - i.e. it must be able to present the drives to macOS as seperate, single drives. If the enclosure only supports its own form of RAID, it is still possible to use the old disks - but the data on them will be overwritten.\nAnother thing to observe is that the 2012 MacPro tower by default hasn't got Thunderbolt or any of the newer, faster external busses. You might find an external enclosure too slow if it is connected via USB 2.0 for example.\nBefore you embark on anything, remember to take backups!\n", "Q: Time Machine is backing up itself? I have a MacBook Pro 13 inch 2017, 2 USB-C ports, MacOS 10.13.6, with about 90 GB content, 120 GB total HD. It gets its first backup onto a pristine, just reformatted, 500 GB external drive, via USB. The drive is connected via a USB to USB-C connector (in case this could be an issue).\nThe backup starts fine, then it goes past 90 GB and it keeps ballooning until it \"runs out of space\". I made a small clip of the window  that displays this process which I can't show here but here is the display on the first frame: \"Backing up 325.82 GB of 358.40 GB\" and on the last: \"Backing up 326.00 GB of 358.60 GB\". I can see, looking at the screen, as both numbers just keep climbing up and up. \nThere is nothing else connected to the computer. \nWhat's going on? It seems the backup goes into an infinite loop.\n\nA: It would be very strange to have TM back itself up... That said, we can check! Go to System Preferences > Time Machine > [Options...]. The drop down pane that appears has \"Exclude these items from backups:\" If your external drive is not listed there, it might actually be backing itself up. Click the plus under the list box and try to select your external drive. If it now appears in the list box, click [Save] and try to backup.\n", "Q: I am unable to to project my screen from a Windows laptop to iMac using HDMI to Thunderbolt 2 I am unable to project my screen as an extended screen to my Late 2012 21 inch iMac from my Dell XPS L502X. \nPlease guide me through steps which I can follow. I am using an HDMI to Thunderbolt 2 converter.\n\nA: \nI am unable to project my screen from a windows laptop to iMac using HDMI to Thunderbolt 2\n\nThis is impossible.\nFirst off, there's no such thing as HDMI to Thunderbolt (1, 2 or 3).  Thunderbolt is a multiplexing of several signals:\n\n\n*\n\n*DisplayPort\n\n*PCIe Bus\n\n*USB\n\n*Power (Thunderbolt 3 only)\n\n\nHDMI is a video signal and there's no way to convert a video signal to to anything but a video signal.\nSecondly,  the requirement to use Target Display Mode (assuming you have a supported iMac) is that it must originate from a  DisplayPort or Thunderbolt port.  It can't originate from HDMI.  \nFinally, the late 2012 iMac will only support a Thunderbolt connection; DisplayPort is unsupported. So, unless you have a Thunderbolt port on your laptop (your Dell L502X does not), you can't do this.\n", "Q: How can I use iPhoto in lieu of Photos in macOS Sierra? I really dislike macOS's Photos.app (thought I could get use to it), but would like to use iPhoto again. It's in my apps, but was replaced with a more current version when my stuff was installed onto the new Mac. When I click on iPhoto, it says it needs to update the photo library before I can use it. \nI'm running macOS Sierra 10.12.6 and worry about compatibility since I'm reading some scary things. Don't want to end up in a jam or a pile of lost photos. Has anyone done this upgrade with Sierra in order to use the latest iPhoto? And has everything worked like clockwork?\n\nA: I don't think the update will work. I've seen an update for iPhoto in the App store before and it usually gives you an error message that the item is no longer available (tho it has been a long time since I last saw that update). If you ever delete iPhoto, the update will disappear from the App Store.\nI didn't think there was a way to continue to use iPhoto, but there appears to be a work around I found in Apple's Discussions forum. The basic idea is to delete then replace the iPhoto app by using the purchased list in the App Store. Theoretically, that version will be an updated version that will work. If it doesn't, work: No harm cuz it hasn't worked anyway. Check if your purchased list includes iPhoto and which version it downloads before attempting to remove the iPhoto app. Once iPhoto is the Trash, don't empty the Trash. You can put iPhoto back if this plan doesn't work and maybe someone will come up with a different plan later. And don't worry about losing the old library. Deleting the older version of iPhoto, or just moving it to Trash, will not remove the iPhoto library which usually resides in the Pictures folder of the home folder.\nIf that plan does work, the question then becomes how do you get pics from the Photos app to iPhoto that you added since you switched to Photos? Drag and drop will likely work even if you have to drag to desktop then drag to iPhoto. Try dragging pics directly from Photos to iPhoto first.\n", "Q: Stop information syncing between iPad and iPhone How do I stop my iPhone and iPad from syncing? They currently sync website history, texts, and calls. My iPhone is company owned and iPad is personal.\n\nA: Apparently, you have signed into iCloud on both your devices using the same Apple ID. Devices setup with the same Apple ID sync a lot of user data between them for built-in apps by default.\nIf you concerned about keeping company and personal data segregated, it is recommended to use different Apple ID for your iPad and iPhone (personal Apple ID for iPad and a separate one for iPhone).\nAlternatively, if you have reasons to use the same Apple ID, you can selectively choose which data to sync. On your iPad/iPhone, go to Settings app → Tap on your name and picture shown on the top (Apple ID, iCloud, iTunes & App Store) → iCloud and under Apps Using iCloud section, turn-off the switch in front of all the apps for which you do not wish to sync data.\n\n\nSpecifically, to disable syncing website history, turn-off iCloud for Safari (it will also stop syncing bookmarks and open tabs from one device to the other), for text messages, turn off iCloud for Messages. If the SMS from your iPhone are also showing up on your iPad, you will additionally need to disable Text Message Forwarding on your iPhone. For that, go to Settings app → Messages → Text Message Forwarding and turn off the switch shown in front of your iPad.\n\n", "Q: How do I disable volume/brightness popup? \nThis is the volume pop up. How do I remove it? It's highly annoying when it appears when playing a movie\n\nA: Like many things interface-y, there's a Terminal command for that. Excellent explanation already exists.\n", "Q: MacBook doesn't find any Bluetooth device After running sudo nvram bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior=always because I wanted macOS to use only external Bluetooth dongles instead of the internal one I cannot find any Bluetooth devices anymore when the external dongle is not connected. I already ran \nsudo nvram -d bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior\n to reset the setting, restarted macOS several times, reset the NVRAM, reset the Bluetooth module, etc..\nIs there anything I missed after using these Bluetooth devices with my external dongle? When now plugging in the external dongle again, it finds all the devices properly.\nI tried to search for the devices with my iPad (Magic Keyboard 2), and it instantly recognizes it.\nEdit: I just erased my macOS installation and reinstalled High Sierra, but the problem persists.\nEdit2:\nThe system report is showing me that seemingly there are devices connected (when the internal device is active) although I removed all devices via the menu bar option.

I have a MacBook that requires a MagSafe charger, but my charger broke in mid 2016. My MacBook was holding 40%+ charge and no longer being charged. I am wondering if I can still charge it today? If yes, I am going to order a charger online.\n\nA: There's no other way to find out than to try it.\nIn general there's nothing that says that a battery must stop working because it hasn't been charged in two years - batteries like those really age more due to heavy use rather than lying around on a shelf. So unless something bad happened to the computer or the battery over those two years, it is probably going to work just fine.\n", "Q: Mid 2013 MacBook Pro displaying multi color My MacBook Pro was displaying normally until recently. Now when I boot it up it  displays different colors, sometimes white on the screen, but when I hook it up to a TV screen it displays normally.\nI need help as to what could be causing this problem and how to fix it?\nSo far I've tried resetting NVRAM and reseating the RAM, but this didn't help. I also haven't upgraded any software nor added any new items of hardware, so this change in behaviour cannot be attributed to any known actions on my behalf.\n\n\n\n\nA: This could be one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*a bad LCD\n\n*a failure of a logic board component, possibly the video mux chip.\n\n\nA bad LCD is quite easy to diagnose; simply plug that LCD into a known working MacBook. If it continues to fail, it's the LCD.\nAlternatively, you can plug in a known working LCD into your Mac and if it continues to fail, you've narrowed it down to your logic board.\nIf it so happens that your LCD tests good, the likely cause is the circuitry that sends display signals to the LCD itself.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Cable\n\n*Video Mux chip\n\n*related circuitry (capacitors, resistors, traces, connectors, etc.)\n\n\nWhat's a video mux?  It's a fancy switch.  It takes multiple inputs, in this case video,  and sends them to the appropriate output; the internal LCD and/or external TV/monitor.\nThat chip could be faulty given that it's only sending video to one display while sending garbage to another.  \nBottom line:  Take it in for service.\nSwapping out LCD's is not too difficult, but you have to have either a spare LCD or a spare Mac with the same display connector.  I don't imagine you have spare Mac parts just casually laying around.\nDoing a board level diagnostic isn't something you'll be able to do without the proper tools.\nIt can be fixed, but it needs to be done by a pro.\n", "Q: App icon switches to low resolution upon launching an app Recently I started getting this really weird but annoying bug. While the app is in the Dock but not working, its icon is in good resolution. But once I open it, the icon switches to low resolution. Same thing with its icon in the app switcher (Command + Tab) view.\nIt only affects the Wolfram Mathematica app. I tried reinstalling the program as well as the whole Mac OS X, but it's still there, anyone know how to fix it?\nI am running Mac OS X Mojave.\n\nBefore launching the app:\n\n\nAfter launching the app:\n\n\nVersion of Mathematica:\n\n\nA: This appears to be a bug in the app itself. It's also affecting the Wolfram app and affects not only the icon in the dock, but also the app switcher icon. I tried creating a new WolframDesktop.icns file, but the application still reverts back to the lower resolution icon on my 13\" MacBook Pro. The icon renders fine on a 15\" MacBook Pro. Both are running Mojave.\n\nA: Probably the first two things to check are that you've only got the one version of Wolfram Mathematica installed and that it's also the latest version.\nIf the problem still persists after you've double-checked the above, you can also choose to reset and restart the Dock. Note you will need to re-add any non-default icons (i.e. apps) that you've added to the Dock - so you may want to take a screenshot of your Dock as a reminder of what you had there. (Or start afresh and only add things as you actually use them).\nTo reset and restart the Dock, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Finder\n\n*Press and hold the option key down\n\n*Now go to the Go menu\n\n*Select the Library option to open the User's Library folder. You can let go of the option key now.\n\n*Go to the Preferences folder (i.e. within the Library folder)\n\n*Find and move the com.apple.dock.plist file to the Trash\n\n*Now open Terminal (usually located in Applications > Utilities)\n\n*Enter this command killall -KILL Dock\n\n*Press enter\nAs mentioned previously, you will need to re-add non-default apps back to the Dock.\nIf this doesn't resolve the issue, it's almost certainly an isolated issue with this app and you'd be best to contact their support to raise the issue with them.\n\nA: Usually the icon of an app is part of the application bundle (the directory with the „.app“ file extension). It is available in multiple sizes, e.g. 512x512, to minimize rescaling effort and to maximize display quality.\nAt runtime, an app can programmatically override the icon of the running process. If the app is not aware you are using a hi-dpi display, the effect you described will occur. \nThis problem probably will be resolved with a future update - I‘m afraid there is nothing you can do about that right now. \n", "Q: Can't delete file even when using sudo Trying to delete the following file: ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist, but MacOS won't let me do it even when using sudo.\nI just switched to Mac (was using Ubuntu before) and I'm probably missing something obvious. I'm using MacOS Mojave 10.14.1.\nWhat could be wrong?\nsudo rm -f ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist\nrm: /Users/dima/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist: Operation not permitted\n\nI can't run ls on the folder files:\nls -la ~/Library/Cookies/\nls: : Operation not permitted\n\nOutput of ls -lde@ ~/Library/Cookies:\ndrwx------@ 11 dima  staff  352 Dec 11 23:03 /Users/dima/Library/Cookies\n    com.apple.quarantine     -1\n\nI found out I can delete the file using Finder, but not using command line. Why is that?\n\nA: I've had this problem before, too.  I believe this is because of System Integrity Protection.  macOS protects some parts of the filesystem starting with El Capitan.\nI think there are two ways to work around this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable System Integrity Protection\n\n*Grant Full Disk Access to Terminal\n\n\nFor the first, restart your Mac, but hold down Command-R until you boot into Recovery Mode.  Then on the menu, select Utilities then type csrutil disable and press Enter.  Reboot your Mac and try your rm command again.  When you're done, I suggest you go back into Recovery Mode and re-enable it (csrutil enable).\nFor the second, open Security & Privacy in System Preferences.  Click the Privacy tab, select Full Disk Access and add Terminal to the list of applications.  You'll likely have to unlock that screen first by clicking the padlock at the lower left corner.\nWhen I had this problem, I didn't know about the Full Disk Access trick and used the first option.  I know it works.  I just learned about the second option earlier today and I'm betting it does the trick, too.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: In AppleScript, how to open a URL location that contains a hash (#)?

How can this be achieved?\n\nA: This is because Alfred is encoding (UTF8) the URL.\n\nDisable it and it will work.\n", "Q: Why do I see \"Cannot Use Thunderbolt Accessory\"? I purchased a brand new MBP and a cable was included in the box, it has USB-C type connectors on each end and works for charging the computer.\nWhen, instead of charging with the brick, I plug it into my new iMac, I get this error message:\n\nWhy do I see this? How do I fix the problem?\nThis message implies that I have connected the \"accessory\" (iMac) using a non-Thunderbolt port on the MacBook Pro. However, the marketing materials on apple.com tell me that all the ports are Thunderbolt ports:\n\n\nA: To slow charge your Mac Book Pro from your iMac, you can connect the USB-C Cable. Unfortunately It seems with recent updates is shows this error on both the MBP and iMac screen. However despite this happening, charging is still occurring.\n\nA: \nWhy do I see this?\n\nYou see this because the computer recognizes a Thunderbolt device was connected but the cable you used doesn't have the \"superspeed\" wires to support Thunderbolt.  The cables that come with Apple laptops are cables with the USB-PD power lines, USB 2.0 lines, but no \"superspeed\" lines for USB 3.x, Thunderbolt, or other USB-C alternate modes.  USB-C uses a USB 2.0 \"billboard device\" protocol to help with alternate mode negotiation.  The computer will see that a Thunderbolt device is connected but is unable to establish a any Thunderbolt communications as the needed wires are not there.\n\nHow do I fix the problem?\n\nUse a Thunderbolt cable, not the USB 2.0 \"charging\" cable that came with your computer.\nThe error is worded poorly.  It may have made sense in the days of Thunderbolt 2 where people might plug in a drive or display using USB for power and Thunderbolt for data.  It's saying that it sees something that is advertising itself as a Thunderbolt device on USB, and it's assuming that there's a separate cable for Thunderbolt.  With Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C there's only one port needed for power, USB, and Thunderbolt.\nBefore you go out to buy a new cable see if you have a USB 3.0 USB-C cable in a drawer somewhere, or you can \"borrow\" from a hard drive or something.  A USB 3.0 cable with USB-C connectors on both ends should work as a Thunderbolt cable, but perhaps at lower speeds.  If that gets you a Thunderbolt connection then maybe you can save yourself from buying a new cable.\nPassive Thunderbolt cables will be short, under 1 meter long, but they can be inexpensive.  You might be able to find a Thunderbolt 3 cable for less than $10.  A very short cable.  If you need a 2 meter cable like the USB-C charging cable that came with your Mac then expect to pay in the $40 to $80 range.\n", "Q: Applescript: Help with idle and hiding from finder?

Ideas?\ntell application \"Finder\"\n\n    set visible of process \"killQuickLook\" to false\n\nend tell\n\n\nA: I stumbled across this link that provides a step-by-step guide to implementing the solution to this problem using launchd.\nFor convenience, I've copied and formatted the relevant contents of the linked page below.\n\nHow to fix QuickLookUIService memory/CPU issues in High Sierra\nIf you're having issues with high memory (or CPU) usage on High Sierra, this is the result of a bug with the QuickLookUIService which appears to have been introduced in that version and which unfortunately has not yet been fixed. The only workaround right now is to repeatedly force quit the quicklookuiservice. \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Create a new file in your favourite text editor (if you use Apple's Text Edit, make sure the file is in plain text format)\n  \n*Paste the xml at the end of these steps into the file\n  \n*Rename the file to the same as what's within the <string> tags with a .plist extension (in my example, com.zerowidth.launched.killquicklook.plist) \n  \n*Copy the file to your library in the LaunchAgents folder (in Finder you can use Go > Go to folder > /Users/[yourusername]/Library/LaunchAgents. You may need to type an administrator password to authorize this action\n  \n*After your next login/restart, you should find the memory issues caused by this to be back to normal. If you ever want to remove the service, just delete the plist file\nSome explanation of what this does\nA launch agent is a service that helps manage applications in Mac OS. In this case, we've written our own small launch agent program that kills the quicklook service repeatedly at an interval (the killall -9 -v QuickLookUIService part). The name of the service is within the  tags (you can call it what you like) and the interval is within the <integer> tags (in my case, 5600 seconds). Feel free to change the interval to whatever works best for you (if you set it higher, it will interfere less with your normal use of preview, but also allow the service to use more memory). As a final note, bear in mind that if you are previewing a document when the service restarts, the preview will fail (you can just preview again immediately). \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.zerowidth.launched.killquicklook</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>sh</string>\n            <string>-c</string>\n            <string>killall -9 -v QuickLookUIService</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>StartInterval</key>\n        <integer>5600</integer>\n    </dict>\n</plist>\n\n\n\nNote: Expanded to answer from comment dated Dec 10 '18 at 20:29\n\nA: Thanks @CJK for the solution I ended up using... creating a launch agent: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8506070\nSuper helpful step-by-step even if you don't know anything about launch agents.\nusing the launch agent version of this fix keeps from taxing additional system resources.
