["Q: Unable to find System preference options I have recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 but I am unable to find system preference options. Where are these options and how can I find them?\n\nA: Are you following a guide from years ago?  I believe you may be looking for Additional Drivers.  You can find this by running \"software & updates\", then going to the \"Additional Drivers\" tab.  Or you can try searching for \"Additional Drivers\" directly from the launcher.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on Dell Inspiron 8600: no operating system found when trying to boot from USB We have an old Dell Inspiron 8600 laptop that had an OS/hard drive crash a year or so ago. Destroyed the hard drive and was going to send the laptop off for recycling but never did. 2 weeks ago I had the idea to buy a new/refurb'd hard drive and install Ubuntu so we could use the device for basic tasks. Bought/installed a refurbished 60 GB hard drive.\nSystem specs: Dell Inspiron 8600 laptop w/ a Pentium M 1.60 GB/600 MHz processor, 1024 Level 2 cache, 1024 MB @ 333 MHz Memory, NVIDIA GeForceFX5200 Video Controller w/64 MB Video Memory. (OK, I know this is old stuff!)\nDownloaded the lubuntu-16.04-desktop-i386.iso file and put that on a USB stick.  Went into the boot menu and selected the USB drive for the new (blank) hard drive to boot from.\nWhen I try to boot, I am getting the message:\n\nAn operating system wasn't found, Try disconnecting any drives that don't contain an operating system.\nPress any key to restart.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n*\n\n*Did I select the the appropriate \"flavor\" of Ubuntu for this (older) machine, and if not - which version would work best?\n\n\n*Please tell me what I'm doing wrong - and hopefully you can provide some (detailed) instructions on how to make this happen.\n\nA: I would try using a bootable cd instead of the usb. Often times the bootable usb won't get made correctly (usually due to incorrect settings by the software you used to make the bootable usb) and because of that you will not be able to boot from it. This would make a lot of sense because 16.04 is still new. \nSo if you can, try using a bootable cd. Then, try Ubuntu before you install it. Make sure all your devices work with it using the live cd. If they do, then you know your hardware is compatible and it should be safe to install it. \n\nA: If your USB was made bootable and this is still occurring, check your BIOS settings to make sure the USB is set as a bootable device.\n", "Q: How shred very large folder and subfolder and files I want to shred or secure delete big folder that have about 100 GB information and many files\nWhat command or tool can I use for this?\n\nA: The chattr command can be used to change a folder or files attributes.\nSo if you use \nchattr -R +s the_big_folder\nIt will recursively add the secure delete attribute to all sub directorys and files. Which means that when you delete them they will be zero filled. Then, you just have to delete them using\nrm -rf the_big_folder\n", "Q: Is there a multi-threaded download manager with no thread limit? I use dispatch-proxy to club multiple IPs and on windows IDM uses that to get me great speeds. About 2-3 MB/s. My college limits speed per local IP so I assigned multiple IPs to the same adapter and got a boost. I prefer ubuntu over windows, but I need a download manager which can ideally let me decide the number of segments per download so I can utilize all possible bandwidth I can get. Even aria2c limits me at 16 connections per download and others have generally just 10.\nI really need this fix as nothing is worse than slow internet.\n\nA: axel apparently does.

I'd like the URIs (which point to documents) to be imported as click-able links, but the Fields > Column-Type drop-down on the import dialogue doesn't give that option.  Otherwise, I'd like to be able to change the full imported column into hyperlinks, rather than being forced to do it one cell at a time, as with Insert > Hyperlink.\nThe URI could either look like file:///document-path or just the path/filename.

You need to just find and replace (under Edit):\nhttp:.*|file:.*\n\nwith:\n=HYPERLINK(\"&\",\"Some text here\")\n\nThen check the box for: \"regular expression\" and finally, \"replace all\".\n\"Some text here\" could be another \"&\" if you just want to keep the visible text the same, but turn it into a link.\n(Thanks to pierre-yves samyn)\n", "Q: Is 10 GB/day of writes to my SSD typical for a workstation? In this article in Linux Journal, the author states that his workstation sustains 6.3 GB/day of writes to his SSD.\nUsing tune2fs -l, I see that my SSD filesystem was created on \nFilesystem created:       Sat Jun 28 09:20:03 2014\n\nand lifetime writes are:\nLifetime writes:          6737 GB\n\nThat turns out to be 10 GB/day, which seems outrageous.  I don't do any audio or video editing on the SSD.  My /usr and /home dirs are on the SSD, everything else is on a HDD.   I rarely edit images.  I have Thunderbird, Firefox (with 20 tabs usually) and Skype open all the time, so you can tell what I mostly do with the machine.\nDoes anybody have similar data they can share?  I'll do the calcs if you include your data from tune2fs in a comment.\n\nA: Probably 10GB/day is not typical but it mostly depends on what you are doing. \nThis is quite easy to know what is causing such writes. Install iotop - I/O monitor and run  \nsudo iotop -ao\n\nthen navigate with < to disk write and check which process is causing writes.  \nFor sure Firefox is writing data (caching) all the time and this writing could be huge. Imho the best way is to move firefox profile to tmpfs (ramdisk) and syncing on boot and shutdown or make tweaks in about:config. It will decrease your ssd writes.\nYou can see the total writes since the drive was mounted by looking in session_write_kbytes file:\necho \"Session wrote: $(echo \"scale=2;$(cat /sys/fs/ext4/sda3/session_write_kbytes)/1024\" | bc) MB\"\n\nChange sda3 with your proper partition.\n", "Q: Windows Ubuntu Bash GUI I have just installed bash in windows 10 insider preview.

Is it the fact that no program like gedit can be opened through bash I mean wont that support any GUI ? \n\nA: Ubuntu on Windows does not support the X11 window system, which is needed for graphical applications in Linux. People have managed to use Xming to get things to work (with Cygwin's X suggested as an alternative), but it's not very stable. YMMV. It's not official, and if anything breaks, don't ask here.\n\nA: Although WSL does not include X-Windows, you can run a X-Windows in the Windows Operating System and display the linux applications in the same desktop. There are many tutorials and blog entries you may check.\nRunning Applications\n\n\n*\n\n*I use VcSrv Windows X Server, but you can use the old Xming or the Cygwin X Server. For VcXrv, you only need to download and install the software.\n\n*After starting the X-Windows, you must instruct Linux to use the desktop\n$ export DISPLAY=:0\n\n\n*Then, you can install and run linux applications that use a graphical user interface. For instance, to run xeyes you may run\n$ sudo apt-get install x11-apps\n$ xeyes\n\nRunning a Unix Desktop\nUbuntu uses Unity or GNOME as a desktop.

Since I upgraded to Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 a week ago, firefox upgraded with it, and it now uses a dark theme as well. That's okay with me, except for the fact that a fair number of web forms now have become unreadable: the text is white, but the form fields are white as well, so you can't see what you're typing.\nWorkaround: select the text after you've typed it, then it becomes visible and you can inspect it.\nOther workaround: type everything in gedit and copy-paste it from there.\nSure, there are workarounds, but this is very annoying. I like the dark theme so I prefer to keep using it, but for web forms it's just not a good idea.\nIs it possible to keep the dark theme but fix its behavior in web forms such that they are always readable?\n\nA: This is a known issue.

I was surprised that my bluetooth speaker stopped working in a stable way, like it was working with 14.04. Now I wave to go through all these steps to make it work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the speaker (doesn't auto-connect like it did in 14.04)\n\n*Turn on the speaker in the Bluetooth settings (doesn't play music, it just doesn't start playing at all)\n\n*In sound settings for the speaker change mode from A2DP to HSP/HFP (it starts playing music, but in very low quality)\n\n*Change the mode back to A2DP (it automatically switches to built in speakers each time I choose the Bluetooth speaker and try to change the mode back to A2DP)\n\n*Turn of the speaker and turn it on again\n\n*Only now it lets you switch the mode for the Bluetooth speaker back to A2DP and plays music\n\n\nBy \"plays music\" I literally mean it - it doesn't start the playback.\nDoes anyone have any advice how to deal with this problem?\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem you are describing, when I choose A2DP mode while my bluetooth speaker is selected I automatically get switched to the built in audio while in the sound menu. \nSometimes If I switch to A2DP during playback whatever I am playing freezes and does not start to play until I select something else.\nI often get it working after some tinkering with restarting my bluetooth speaker and disconnecting/connecting the bluetooth.\n", "Q: Configure virtual directory in sftp server I've recently shifted from Windows to Xubuntu. I'm trying to implement an sftp server for my home. In Windows, I used Bitvise. WHen searching for sftp servers for linux, I came accross vsftpd. So, I installed it. But, I'm unable to setup virtual directories (i.e. directories that refer to different physical folders). Does this application support virtual directories? If yes, how to set them up? If not, can anyone please refer me another server that does?\n\nA: Since no one else answered, and I managed to solve it, I'm posting the answer myself.\nWell, it was pretty straightforward. Instead of configuring it inside an sftp server, I did it the general way. I created a new directory under /var/www (or anywhere else). Then, I used the bind command to mount the desired directories there.  \n#As an example\nsudo mount --bind /some/where /else/where\n #mounts /some/where under /else/where\nThen, I just selected that directory as the home of the user.

I have recently upgraded from 15.10 to 16.04LTS. Since the upgrade, I have still been prompted occasionally to update by 'Software Updater' which had been present in 15.10. Quite a few updates to Ubuntu core have been done this way.\nIn the last couple of days, when returning from suspend a popup has appeared in the same place as the wifi connected/disconnected information appears. This new popup told me that 'Important OS and application updates are ready...\" before disappearing. Yet when I checked with the 'Software Updater' it told me that the software was up to date.\nChecking with the new 'Ubuntu Software' (update tab) told me that there were updates, so I clicked 'Install'. It didn't tell me what was being installed.\nWhy is there this different method of checking and why are the two giving different results?\nHow can I find out what the new Ubuntu Software did install ?\nEdit 9th May\nAgain today the pop-up appeared. The 'Software Updater' showed the machine was up to date. The 'Ubuntu Software' app showed 1 update. On clicking the '1' icon it showed 1 update, namely: ubuntu-drivers-common 1:0.4.17.1. I clicked the 'Install' button and installed it.\nI'm none the wiser as to why it is only shown as necessary by 1 app and not the other.\n\nA: They're two different programs that do similar things.\nSoftware Updater is the update-manager package (Gnome apt) and uses the apt database.\nThe Software Center (Titled \"Ubuntu Software\") is the gnome-software application and doesn't seem to use the apt database.  But if you see \"OS updates\" under the \"Updates\" tab, you can click on it (the text) and it will show you what will be installed.\nWhy the two show different things is probably in the way they pull their package metadata.\nAlso, you can view the history of installs and updates here /var/log/apt/history.log\n", "Q: Temperature sensors broken?

Here's a guide to install it and here another solution for my problem (tested) that use Linux kernel 4.3.5.\nThe second solution slow down system start, so I have used the first one\n\nA: Just for the record, since I have no interest in using the intel gpu, I never have. As an experiment, I used the nvidia gui to change to intel, logged out, and, after login the same fan issue occurred in 15.10,  \nuname -a\nLinux deblap2 4.2.0-36-generic #41-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 18 15:49:10 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nthus, as far as I can tell, it is not ubuntu 16.04 specific, and, in the various distros I attempted to install on the laptop, including debian, manjaro, mandriva, it has universally occurred, except that only ubuntu 15.10 installed correctly.\nAlso more interesting, I could not then revert by using the nvidia gui, as after logout touchpad froze, and I need to hard shutdown.\nthis is interesting as the problem with the power switch was the main reason i ended up with ubuntu,  as ever other distro I tried had the issue that the power switch and the commands reboot and shutdown did not work as expected.\nI thought it was a kernel version issue, or my laptop, same as OP's, or elan or evdev, or coretemp,  but even though arch recommended adding lmsensors and coretemp, coretemp is loaded. thus, the post and answers bring us one step closer, as the issues are somehow gpu related.\nbest\nM\n\nA: I have experienced the exact same fan issue upon installing 16.04 ubuntu version on a ux501vw laptop. I have followed both proposed solutions and actually none have worked (both 4.3.5 and 4.6 kernels). The fan would still run at around 2500 rpm and furthermore the shutdown command would not work. The monitor would blank out and fans would keep spinning but it would not go into full reboot. Finally I have found this post and it worked. \nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/811260/587844.\nIt is definitely the X.ORG video driver which is buggy. Once I reverted to the NVIDIA one, I could use 16.04 with the 4.6 kernel with no problem. To enable the NVIDIA driver simply open the Software & Updates and navigate to the Additional Drivers tab. Then simply select NVIDIA. Hopefully this will help anyone who stumbles upon this page and has faced the same frustrations in finding a solution.\n\nA: Had some nvidia/ubuntu 16.04 problems (after update) with my old quadra 1500 gpu. After many attempts i managed to use nvidia driver on a new ubuntu install with some instability.\nnvidia monitor indicating high gpu temperature >90º and fan still at 30% pwm, sometimes 40% on some lower temperatures. This is odd!\nI've writen this script to monitor temp and control fan as i wait for a fix and to avoid burning the gpu.\nhttps://github.com/neu-rah/nvfan\nDont know if it helps, use at you own risk.\nbut at least my GPU never reached the red level again.\n\nA: I had same issue, \nWhat I did, is to install ubuntu 16.10, and the problem with the fan was gone; I still had a login issue, which I was able to solve with this:\nUbuntu gets stuck in a login loop\nBesides that, everything else works perfect with 16.10\n", "Q: alsamixer cannot open mixer: Invalid argument No sound in Ubuntu 14.04 seems after upgrading kernel...\nI googled solutions, but cannot solve my problem. And I enter the command alsamixer in terminal. The output is this: cannot open mixer: Invalid argument. Cannot fix it either.\nThe weird thing is that after I use sudo apt-get install pavucontrol and start it by using pavucontrol. And when I play audio, the control panel has recognized it.\nScreenshot in below:\n\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem. Sound worked perfect in Windows 7 but not in Kubuntu 14.04. After many days of searching the Internet and trying all possible advices I have come up with a solution that finally helped me. No need to reinstall Ubuntu.\nFirst I tried to uninstall all ALSA packages and stuff using\nsudo apt-get remove --purge alsa-base pulseaudio\n\nand install them again using\nsudo apt-get install alsa-base pulseaudio\n\nStill didn't work even after numerous attempts of\nsudo alsa force-reload\n\nI read that ALSA has master audio channel muted by defaut after install. So I tried to unmute it using alsamixer command. Unfortunately it didn't work due to Invalid argument error.\nThe search continued and I stumbled upon a website that has always been in search results but I paid no attention to it. It mentioned some file called .asoundrc. I looked for it and didn't find it on my system. Another website said that you should manually create it (/home/username/.asoundrc for current user only, or /etc/asound.conf if you want to keep these settings for all users) and paste the following content in there:\npcm.!default {\n    type hw\n    card 0\n}\n\nctl.!default {\n    type hw           \n    card 0\n}\n\nAfter that I was able to open alsamixer. However, the screen was empty and didn't show any volume settings as expected.\n\nThen I opened list of my sound cards with\ncat /proc/asound/cards\n\nIt turned out that my laptop has two sound cards:\n0 [Generic        ]: HDA-Intel - HD-Audio Generic\n                     HD-Audio Generic at 0xf0344000 irq 28\n1 [Generic_1      ]: HDA-Intel - HD-Audio Generic\n                     HD-Audio Generic at 0xf0340000 irq 16\n\nCard 0 was set by default in the beforementioned .asoundrc file. I experimented and changed 0 to 1. Afterwards alsamixer showed the volume settings I needed.\n\nMaster channel was muted by default, as ALSA documentation warned. It was indicated by the letters MM above the Master label. I used the ↑ arrow key to increase the volume to 100%. But this wasn't enough. I also had to press the M key to unmute Master channel since increasing the volume does not unmute it automatically (taken from here). After pressing M the MM letters became OO which meant the channel was unmuted.\n\nAnd the sound has FINALLY appeared! Press Esc to exit alsamixer and enjoy the variety of sounds and music on your Ubuntu, Kubuntu or whatever distro it is that you are using.\nImportant note: do NOT use sudo alsa force-reload command at all (as some websites suggest) because it mutes the Master channel again and you will have to repeat the unmuting procedure!\nP.S.: These were a hard couple of days trying all possible things to be able to hear again. Of course I could give up and switch back to Windows 7 but my advice to you is do not look for easy ways. The Linux way is not for everyone but after completing that challenge it really feels like a hero.\n", "Q: davfs2: /sbin/mount.davfs: different URL in /etc/fstab I am trying to mount a webdav server in /etc/fstab with davfs, but when i try open this in my file manager (Thunar) i will get the error:\nFailed to mount \"My Folder\"\n\n/sbin/mount.davfs: different URL in /etc/fstab\n\nThe entry in /etc/fstab looks like this:\nhttp://<server_url>/my/path/Doe\\054\\040John/  /home/john/My\\040Folder       davfs   user,noauto     0       0\n\nBut i am still able to mount it successfully with:\nsudo mount -t davfs http://<server-url>/my/path/Doe,\\ John/ /home/john/My\\ Folder\n\nAny ideas what am i doing wrong in /etc/fstab?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: TL;DR aka the fun part:\nIn the /etc/fstab file, you should NOT escape the comma character while spaces and tabs must be escaped using zero-padded octal numbers preceded by backslash \\ as it stated in fstab's man page. In your case, the URL string should look like this:\nhttp://<server_url>/my/path/Doe,\\040John/\n\nThe boring part:\nFirst of all, you should take a look at this one:\nhttps://superuser.com/a/527503/938480\nI'll cite the last sentence of the post above here which is essential for the answer in my opinion:\n\nNote that, while code points are supported for other characters as\nwell, the support is rather flaky. On my machine, you can write \\127\ninstead of W, but not \\070 instead of 8...\n\nAnd the davfs2 man states:\n\nURLS AND MOUNT POINTS WITH SPACES Special characters like spaces in\npathnames are a mess. They are interpreted differently by different\nprograms and protocols, and there are different rules for escaping. In\nfstab spaces must be replaced by a three digit octal escape sequence.\nWrite http://foo.bar/path\\040with\\040spaces instead of\nhttp://foo.bar/path with spaces. For the davfs2.conf and the secrets\nfiles please see the escape and quotation rules described in the\ndavfs2.conf(5) man page. On command line you must obey the escaping\nrules of the shell.\n\nAnd finally let's look at the fstab manual itself:\n\nThe second field (fs_file).\nThis field describes the mount point for the filesystem.\nFor swap partitions, this field should be specified as 'none'.\nIf the name of the mount point contains spaces these can be escaped as '\\040'\n\nAs we can see above, there is actually no mentioning of anything but spaces and tabs.\nI've tested the issue with one of the free online Nextcloud instances (Nextcloud natively comes with a built-in WevDAV support) and I got the same error using the same folder name as in your example Doe, John and the same escaping sequence \\054\\040. Then I removed escaping of the comma and it mounted ok.\n\nA: Too few information to give a hint on whats going wrong here but after installing davfs2 my fstab entry:\nhttps://my-owncloud-url/remote.php/webdav  /media/owncloud/ davfs user,noauto,rw,_netdev 0 0\n\nworks very well...\njust after changing the content of the fstab you can check if it is working by entering\nsudo mount -a\n\nor by entering\nsudo mount mountpoint-here\n\nbut keep in mind - the fodler has to exist before mount can be initilaized...\n", "Q: How to update xubuntu 14.04 LTS to xubuntu 16.04 LTS How to upgrade xubuntu 14.04 LTS to xubuntu 16.04?

If you'd like to change that, go to System Settings > Appearance pane and choose where you want your app menus to appear (on mouse over).\n", "Q: Bootable pen drive 16.04 is not able to recognize by my laptop(UEFI) I am using ubuntu 14.04 in my desktop and now i want to upgrade it to 16.04 so i downloaded ubuntu 16.04 image file and i make my pen drive to bootable by using Startup Disk Creator available in ubuntu and then i tried to boot from pen drive but it is not being recognized by the computer, by this i compared the files of 14.04 and 16.04 files and then i found that 'autorun.ini' and 'wubi' files are missing. so can anyone tell me \n1.What to do to be recognized? and \n2.Can we create those missing files manually?\nThank you\n\nA: Please don't upgrade to 16.04 right now, as there is a bug issue, regarding installation of third party softwares.wait until they debug the said issue.Till then keep enjoying 14.04.\n", "Q: Not able to Install Android Studio on ubuntu running the studio.sh file is giving me the following error\nroot@ezio-HP-Pavilion-g6-Notebook-PC:/usr/local/android-studio/bin#./studio.sh\nJava HotSpot(TM) Server VM warning: ignoring option MaxPermSize=350m; support was removed in 8.0\n\nStart Failed: Internal Error.

System identifies my graphic card, no problem but when I select a proprietary driver and apply changes. After a few seconds, change bar stops and nouveau selected by default again.\nI tried from terminal;\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-361\n\nbut output says \"you have held broken packages\"\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nSome packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\nor been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n nvidia-361 : Depends: lib32gcc1 but it is not going to be installed\n              Depends: libc6-i386 but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nThen issue is not about nvidia-361, all drivers are same. \n\nA: In ubuntu 16.04, if Software & Updates -> Additional Drivers, is started from menu or Unity launcher, choosing a proprietary driver doesn't work. Upon selecting a new driver and clicking apply changes, progress bar moves forward for sometime, then goes back and the previous driver is selected again.\nIt looks like the issue is that Software & Updates is initialized without super user privileges. The solution is, open a terminal and type:\n$ sudo software-properties-gtk\n\nAnd type password if required.\nThen select the proprietary driver and click apply changes.\nThis method solved me the problem.\nPS : Edited after seeing the comments.\n\nA: 16.04 is new and all packages are not ready to use in all servers.

I had a Dell laptop some years ago and I upgraded its firmware because they improved the power management and it showed.\nTherefore, you should check out the Dell website for the changelog and then decide for yourself. Upgrading firmware and other \"low-level\" software is usually a good idea, but the final decision is yours.\n\nWhat is a decent way to update the BIOS on this system to a more recent one?\n\nThe Ubuntu community help contains a good explanation of the process. In particular, the Dell Bios page explains how to perform the upgrade using FreeDOS. Here are the relevant steps:\n\nFollow the directions here to create a FreeDOS USB drive: http://chtaube.eu/computers/freedos/bootable-usb/\nAfter you've done that:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Eject the USB drive, then re-insert it so you can see the new FreeDOS file system.\n  \n*Copy your BIOS update file to the drive.\n  \n*Reboot, press F12 for the one-time boot menu, and boot from the USB Storage Device.\n  \n*Choose \"fdos\".\n  \n*Choose \"4 - Load FreeDOS without drivers.\"\n  \n*Execute the BIOS update.\n  \n\nRegarding the last step, executing the .exe file is similar to what you would do in the terminal. Assuming the file is called upgrade.exe, you will run this at the FreeDOS prompt:\nupgrade.exe\n\n", "Q: /usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no fan-capable sensor modules installed I know that there are some threads to deal about this topic but neither has helped me.

I don't have the 'Boot from EFI file' option listed in my BIOS boot order menu. It only has 'OS Boot Manager' that defaults to the Windows bootloader.\n2. The Secure Boot is disabled.\n3. I had formatted and re-installed my Ubuntu over an earlier installation (same version) owing to me screwing up the OS by installing too many packages.

Then a screen will appear showing the various bootloaders available. \nIf this screen does not appear try Fn+F9, else press escape and you will see a sceen with options to boot from EFI file or choose bootloader.\nIf the Ubuntu options are not available, boot from a live ISO and check your EFI partition to see if it has a folder named Ubuntu in it.\nIf the F9 option does work, there will be two options for Ubuntu. You can select any one.

If I want to view it I cannot click on the icon and choose Show TeamViewer or it will just open and close again. I have to stop gDevilspie to open / view the program .. just keep that in mind \n\nA: Expanding on what @JohnOrion posted, I have a solution which is more reliable. Instead of always killing TeamViewer's windows, it just closes the two windows at program startup and then stops closing them in the future.

During this process, it displayed a screen with the following message:\n\nYour system has UEFI Secure Boot enabled. UEFI Secure Boot is not compatible with the use of third-party drivers.\n(...) Ubuntu will still be able to boot on your system but these third-party drivers will not be available for your hardware.\nDisable UEFI Secure Boot? (yes | no)\n\nSince the only third-party drivers that I am using are the NVIDIA graphics drivers, and since they have been working fine with Ubuntu 15.10 and Secure Boot enabled, I chose the \"no\" option here. I don't see why I should disable this for no good reason, and I assumed I can just reinstall the third-party driver via the system settings GUI after the update.\nAlas, no. Upon reboot, my login screen appeared in very low resolution. When trying to log in it immediately throws me back to the login screen.\nI have tried the following to fix the situation:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\nsudo reboot\n\nThis leads to a purple screen and no reaction to Ctrl-Alt-F1. Logging in via SSH, I then did:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\nsudo reboot\n\nwhich again brings me the former scenario, with a very low-res login screen, and no way to log on.\nThis is a pretty bad upgrade experience. Did anyone else have this, and what can I do to fix this? (while keeping UEFI Secure Boot enabled) Thanks.\n\nA: Through Ubuntu 15.10, Ubuntu's handling of Secure Boot stopped at GRUB -- that is, Ubuntu's version of Shim would launch Ubuntu's version of GRUB, which would launch any Linux kernel, whether or not it was signed. This was a very low bar of support for Secure Boot. For comparison, Fedora's GRUB would launch only signed Linux kernels, and Fedora's kernels, when they detected that Secure Boot was active, would load only signed kernel binaries. The intent of Fedora's more-robust Secure Boot support was to protect the system against \"rogue\" kernel modules, which could, in theory, take over the computer at a very low level. Ubuntu 15.10 and earlier lacked such protection.\nStarting with 16.04, Ubuntu follows a stricter Secure Boot module, more like what Fedora's been doing for quite a while. This has security benefits, but as you've seen, it also has problems. If a third-party driver is not signed with a cryptographic key that the Ubuntu version of the Linux kernel recognizes as valid, it won't be loaded. This mostly impacts the closed-source Nvidia and AMD/ATI video drivers, but there are other drivers that can be affected, too.\nThere are (or might be) several workarounds to this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Secure Boot -- This is the easiest solution. You can do it by mucking with your firmware settings or (I think) by adjusting the Shim settings. (I'm not sure how to do it by tweaking Shim's settings, but I'm pretty sure that's possible.)\n\n*Don't use third-party kernel modules -- If you restrict yourself to open source drivers included in Ubuntu's standard Linux kernel, you should be fine, since Canonical signs all such drivers (AFAIK). Note that there should be pretty good Nvidia support using such drivers; your system probably fell back to sub-optimal drivers because it thought that the closed-source drivers were available. I don't know offhand how to switch from one to the other, but this question is about doing so with AMD/ATI drivers, so it may be a helpful starting point.\n\n*Sign the relevant modules -- In theory, signing the commercial modules yourself should get them working. Unfortunately, I don't have a pointer for instructions on how to do this, and in fact I'm not even entirely sure that it's possible to do this with a stock Ubuntu kernel; such a kernel might honor only modules that are signed with Canonical's key, which of course you don't possess.\n\n*Compile your own kernel -- If you compile your own kernel, you can set its options as you see fit, including loosening the restrictions on loading unsigned modules. You'd then need to sign the kernel with your own EFI key and add the public version of that key to your MOK list. Here's a question and answers about compiling your own kernel.\n\n*Switch to an older GRUB -- Because an older GRUB will launch unsigned kernels, you could install such a GRUB (from Ubuntu 15.10 or before) and have it launch an unsigned kernel. Note that maintaining that older GRUB would be likely to be a pain.\n\n*Switch to a boot loader that doesn't honor Secure Boot -- If you were to sign a boot loader like SYSLINUX or ELILO with your own key and add the public version of that key to your MOK list, that boot loader would ignore the Secure Boot settings, just like an older version of GRUB. You could then launch an unsigned kernel.\n\n\nNote that the only two of these options that I'm 100% certain would work are to disable Secure Boot or to avoid third-party kernel modules. I avoid third-party kernel modules like the plague, so I have no personal experience with using them in a Secure Boot environment. Aside from disabling Secure Boot, building your own kernel might be the next-most-likely to work, followed by using an older GRUB or using a boot loader that doesn't honor Secure Boot. Building your own kernel was once common, but few people do that any more, and with modern kernels, the time investment to learn how to configure a kernel, not to mention actually doing so, can be significant. Using an older GRUB or another boot loader might be easier, but you'll need to know enough to be able to set that up. The easier way is likely to be to dual-boot with an older Ubuntu that you install second -- but be aware that Ubuntu 16.04 is likely to restore its GRUB at some point, whereupon you'll need to re-install the older Ubuntu's GRUB.\n", "Q: 14.04 Gave up waiting for root device I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Asus PC.

This can be done by using\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIt will probably be /dev/sda1 but look at the descriptions to the right when it lists the devices. Next, you need to unmount the device.

I have both configured in /etc/network/interfaces since it's a server and has no graphical interface which could make problems if I do this. When I start the server I'm not able to find it on the network with nmap 10.0.0.0/24 -p and can't ping my gateway from the server. If I put the interfaces down and only enp5s0f1 up suddenly the ping is working. So I thought that the config or the network cable of interface 0 has some problems. I Checked the config file and switched LAN cables. I found no mistake in the config file.

Some time ago I had Windows 10 pre-installed in the PC and I had no such problem. The device is designed to also support Linux Ubuntu. The problem that I see is that my computer transmits in mono instead of stereo mode. I also went into the Gnome settings but not change anything even if I change the profile A2DP Sink mode as I had read in various forums. I would like to know if you can do something to remedy this problem?\n\nA: I've had the same problem since Ubuntu Gnome 15.04.  I have a photive speaker that supports both A2DP and headset modes.  It works with my android phone, with the same computer in Windows 10, and with another computer running Fedora 23.  I believe it also worked with Linux Mint on the same hardware.  But it's never worked with Ubuntu Gnome; it connects as a headset, and the A2DP protocol is disabled.\nEdit: I just tried the instructions here, and they worked for me; my speaker is currently connected in A2DP and playing in high-quality stereo.  However, I have tried them before, and they did not work on previous Ubuntu versions, so your mileage may vary.\nThis is still less than ideal, because now I will not be able to switch to headset mode to use the microphone.\nEdit 2: I spoke too soon.  I just rebooted the machine to see if the changes would stick, and they did not - the headset would not even connect.  I started working through a few of the steps that I've found: I reloaded pulsaudio's bluetooth-discover module, and that didn't work; I then restarted the bluetooth service, and now it works.  So, try this, and see if you get the same results.\npactl unload-module module-bluetooth-discover\npactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\nsudo systemctl restart bluetooth\n\nI'm not sure which of these steps is actually solving the problem.  Also, note that I did not kill and restart pulse itself, since that seems to confuse already-running applications.\n", "Q: How to install gtk+2.0 When I enter the command\nsudo apt-get install gtk+2.0\n\nI get Output is like this:\n\nReading state information...

It will be shown the list of themes installed on your system and you can choose which is the best for you or you can install other from internet.\nNote: if you have installed a new theme, then you can't see with the first method.

I supposed that your vpn network is using the same subnet as the docker0 interface.\nThis will shutdown the docker0 interface:\n\nsudo ifdown docker0\n\nBut the problem will come back after a reboot.

Use that instead.\n\nA: Try Ctrl+Alt+F1, this opens a \"tty terminal\" or terminal with no GUI. Use Ctrl+Alt+F7 to return to the GUI.\n\nA: I had the same problem when I try to install Ubuntu 16.04 on my lenovo laptop. I couldn't open terminal from my live usb installer. I couldn't even be able to open installer to install in my laptop. It happened because Ubuntu image is not downloaded properly even though it shows download successfully. So I posted same problem on Ubuntu forums. You can check the thread here\nI downloaded fresh Ubuntu image from the official site. I then checked md5sum. After I made sure it is downloaded correctly, I made a live USB installer. And then I installed successfully in my laptop.\nTo check md5sum execute following commad.\nme@linux:$ md5sum ubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso\nc94d54942a2954cf852884d656224186\n\nThe result should match the md5sum hash value in this page for respective OS.

I've spent hours looking on the net, tried various things. One site said that this particular card is not supported by the b43 driver so I have to use wl. And make sure that b43 is blacklisted which I was unable to do (always I try to blacklist the b43 it says permission denied).\nSo, is it even possible to use this network controller with Ubuntu (16.04)\nI've had my new laptop a week now and still not up and running - Win 10 works though :(\n\nA: Although I have read some questions that suggest it is troublesome, I have not yet read any report that says it absolutely will not work. It is easy enough to find out. Install the driver and see!\nWith a working internet connection by ethernet, tethered or whatever means possible, open a terminal and do:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source\n\nThe installation of the driver does the required blacklisting for you. However, if you wanted to undertake it manually, I suggest:\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Add the following lines at the very end to the existing text:\nblacklist b43\nblacklist bcma\nblacklist ssb\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor. Reboot and tell us if the wireless is working.\n\nA: Mind that there's also a secure boot connection. If you have secure boot enabled in your BIOS, the wifi may not be properly detected in Ubuntu now.\nDisabling secure boot instantly resolves that and all will work fine.\nThis was the case on a HP 250 G4 with the BCM43142 wifi/bluetooth module.\nI've read about this elsewhere as well, that having secure boot turned on can cause grief for some drivers. Sigh.\n", "Q: Printer connectivity I have Ubuntu 15.10 and I am trying to connect my printer - an Epson stylus SX445W.\nThis printer has WiFi and usb connectivity.

I intend to set up an Intel NUC machine as a personal web server as well as a HTPC machine connected to my TV.\n\nA: Yes it is possible with LXD.\nI have my custom LXD Image server.

I can't install AMD driver on Ubuntu 16.04.\nI took a look at Install-amd-drivers-r9-280 \nand AMD-graphics-driver-installer-notes-for-linux but I don't seem to understand how to install.\n\nA: fglrx is no longer supported on 16.04. AMD discontinued support for its Linux driver, and it isn't compatible (you will break your installation if you attempt to install fglrx on 16.04).\nFor now, you have to stick with the open source drivers. AMD may be releasing a proprietary driver for Linux that works with 16.04, but it probably won't support very many cards.\nHere's a comparison of how the default drivers on 16.04 compare to fglrx on 14.04, if you want to take a look:\nhttp://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu-1604-amd&num=1\n", "Q: Headphones not working on Asus G751JT laptop When I plug in my headphones on Asus G751JT laptop with 16.04 LTS no sound is coming out of them while sound continues to play from laptop speakers.\nHere are my Alsa details:\nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=6d358e8b683771d1ac039b8b9a09075c2bb61b84\nHeadphones work fine in preinstalled Windows 10.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Dell Latitude E7450.\nIt's not my favourite solution, but here's what's working for me for now:\nInstall indicator-sound-switcher:\nhttp://yktoo.com/en/software/indicator-sound-switcher\nThen you can at least manually switch.

I modified my partition table so that I used sdb5 and sdb6 as my external and swap partitions (to avoid file system creation in partition sdb1 that always failed in the beginning of the installation). I almost finished the installation, but got error message:\n\"Unable to install GRUB in /dev/sdb. Executing 'grub-install /dev/sdb' failed.

I did the \"Recommended repair\" and finally encountered \"An error occured during the repair\" and got the following link:\nhttp://paste2.org/NwJFkc0Z\nIs there a way how I could install/fix GRUB so that it would work?

If you replace your broken hardware and continue to have problems, please post back. Likewise if you investigate further and discover that your disk is not broken.\nNote also that a broken hard disk is not something to be taken lightly. If your computer holds important data, you should not be entrusting that data to a suspect hard disk. A flaky video card? Fine; your data will be reasonably safe.

I read on the installation guide that all I had to do was put the Ubuntu DVD into the DVD drive and restart my computer, however when I did this the option to install Ubuntu did not come up. I'm not sure what I am doing wrong, and help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Did you burn the iso file as an image?  If you wrote it to the CD as a file, then when you insert the CD while in Windows you will see the ubuntu-stuff.iso as a file on the CD.  If that is the case, it was not burned as an image.\nIf it was burned as an image, then it may be your computer is not trying to boot off the CD.  If you hold down the shift key while selecting restart in Windows 10, you will reach the Windows EFI menu.  This is an all blue screen with some options on it.\nOne of these options will be to Use a Device such as your CD or a usb installer.  If you are not using EFI, you can enter the BIOS and make sure your CD drive is first in the list of boot options (how to do this is BIOS dependent).\n\nA: I think the image iso is bad.

In other words, I'm in shambles at this point.\nI also tried installing the default jre using apt-get and that didn't work either.\nDoes anyone know why this is happening and what I can do to fix it? Thank you.\nPS. If a clean wipe is what's necessary, I am open to that. I've barely had Ubuntu running for 2 weeks and it wouldn't be incredibly troublesome to do so.\nEDIT: I eventually relented. I reinstalled Ubuntu from scratch and followed the procedure in the first answer. Everything works properly now.\n\nA: Have you tried just doing it through the Ubuntu Software center? If that didn't work you should be able to run\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install default-jdk\n\n\nA: You could also try using the Oracle JDK instead of OpenJDK.\nThese instructions are great: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-ubuntu-16-04\nPersonally I would go with the Oracle version. \nI have messed up java installs myself and it's no fun to sort out :(  \n", "Q: The Unicode look of disapproval no longer displays correctly in 16.04 - how do I fix this?

It's probably not qualified to be called a hidpi/retina, but it still is very dense. The problem is that the minimum 2x scaling in Tweak Tools is too much. Ideally I wish I could set this to 1.2-1.3.\nScaling the fonts as someone suggests in these cases, from time to time, is not a viable answer since the interfaces will still be small. It produces a very quirky and ugly UI.\nFinally, I sometimes use this laptop with external displays. Those can be as well beyond HD but still, the ratio wouldn't be the same as this laptop. Additionally to the issues above, is there a way to achieve what I want, per monitor basis? I think on Ubuntu/Unity (non-Gnome) you can set the font scaling at least on each monitor separately. Not sure on Gnome.\nI think this could be achieved by Xrandr, but would be changes persistent? Has anyone written a GUI tool for that?\nThanks\n\nA: You can use the experimental feature 'fractional scaling' of gnome 3.26 (which is part of ubuntu 17.10) and set it to 125%.\nYou can set the scaling of each monitor separately.

I noticed that under Ubuntu 16.04 there was no \"share\" tab in Nemo for making a folder shareable on the local LAN.\nI also took a look at my other computer which is running Ubuntu 14.04. In that computer folders accessed with Nemo have a \"share\" tab.

Is there a way to add the \"share\" tab (enable sharing) in Nemo under Ubuntu 16.04 which should resolve the occasional concern of the computer not showing-up on the local LAN.

On initial installation of Ubuntu 16.04, I checked off \"Install third-party software\" and, underneath it, I was prompted to check off another option which would allow the OS package to automatically disable secure boot on its own, a prerequisite of which was creating a password that would somehow allow this whole process to occur.\nAfter continuing with the installation, I was never given any indication that this disabling of secure boot had occurred, nor was I ever prompted to enter the password that I had created.\nUpon successful installation of the OS, I restarted my computer and checked out the BIOS. In BIOS, secure boot was still enabled. However, back in Ubuntu, I am able to seamlessly play MP3 and Flash files, which I assume indicates that the installation of third-party software was successful.\nI haven't run into any problems as of yet (other than the fact that the UI has been a bit finicky and buggy at times), but I would like to know what on Earth I actually accomplished by creating that password.\nWhat happened to the password I created? Will I need to remember it for any reason? It's not the same as my login/sudo password.\nHas Ubuntu permanently edited my BIOS in order to make an exception for itself? If so, how can I view these changes and potentially undo them? Is that where the password would come in?\nWhy does Ubuntu need to disable/bypass secure boot to install the ubuntu-restricted-extras package anyway? Is my installation okay? Have I set myself up for future problems? Should I try reinstalling with secure boot manually disabled as not to receive that prompt in the first place?\nAdditional information:\nI am running a UEFI system, and I am dual-booting Ubuntu 16.04 alongside Windows 10.\nAnother user has asked a question about a similar problem here. Unlike this user, I do not receive a warning about \"booting in insecure mode,\" but I would also like to know whether Ubuntu has created an exception for itself and how I could manage such exceptions. Unlike myself, this user has not mentioned anything about having to create a password.\n\n\n\nA: UEFI Secure Boot protects your boot loader from being tampered with by using a combination of CA keys and signatures in boot files.  Microsoft for example has signed boot loaders for which CA keys are already present in UEFI firmware of most PC's already.  \nThis only protects the very early core of the loader and nothing afterwards.  For example initrd(initramfs) is not protected, or anything after (GRUB, kernel, Modules, Drivers, anything in userspace, etc). \n3rd party software that you installed MAY have included certain low-level PCI or RAID code required for the boot loader, which is why you need to create a password, which will create a key in the UEFI firmware's space.  After modifications, if the system notices something different at boot time, the BIOS will stop at POST and ask for the same password you entered during installation to prove that you are the one who installed the software.  This method insures that a user physically sitting at the computer is entering this password as confirmation since no software can be loaded at BIOS POST time to fake this.\nFor most user systems, secure boot does little to protect you.  It does not prevent viruses or malware, or installation of those.  All it does it prevent low-level bootloader tampering, which is usually prevented by basic antivirus or OS security anyways.  In my opinion, and according to most documentation out there, it can be safely disabled.\n", "Q: Codeblocks Crash I don't have a good experience with codeblocks on Ubuntu.

With Codeblocks 16.01 on Ubuntu 19.04, I see the same issues reported by others — editor freezing, and the application closing suddenly.\nIn a message on the Codeblocks forum, a developer responding to the issue says \"You've hit some of the nasty bugs I have no idea how to fix\", and he refers to an old discussion from the year 2008 on the wxWidgets developer forum about the problem.\nIt's a bit surprising that there's a long-standing unresolved bug in a cross-platform GUI library as popular as wxWidgets that causes problems like this, but that seems to be the situation. Unfortunate.\n\nA: You really don't need CodeBlocks. What you need is g++ compiler for compiling your code. You should have it installed, if not, then:\n$ sudo apt install g++\n\nFor convenience to write code, you can install any text editors such as VS Code (my personal favourite), Atom, Vim, Sublime etc. Just create a new file (say, start.cpp) in some location of your computer (say, /home/<username>/Codes ) and write some code. Then open your terminal in the same location (so in this case, /home//Codes ). Then type:\n$ g++ start.cpp -o start.out   # this compiles your code\n$ ./start.out                  # this is how you run it\n\nIf you have some inputs in a file (say, input.txt ) and want to write the output in some other file (say, output.txt), the command is:\n$ ./start.out < input.txt > output.txt\n\nThat is basically the terminal way of cpp. You will probably make mistakes, so I suggest you ask your teacher/someone experienced with terminal. \nI hope you will never bother to install CodeBlocks again in youe life :)\n", "Q: safe boot in linux, Ubuntu update I was about two thirds finished with updating Ubuntu when my computer, an older macbook pro, just shup itself off.  Now when I try to start it up it  tries to boot straight to Ubuntu instead of Linux and just freezes on the start up screen.  I had hoped to fix a problem I was having playing a game with flash player.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot in Recovery Mode, as explained here:\nHow do I boot into recovery mode?\n\n*Now in Recovery Mode, run touch /forcefsck in order to schedule a disk check for the next boot.\n\n*Run apt-get update in order to check if your Internet connection is up. If it is, just run:\napt-get clean && apt-get check && apt-get dist-upgrade -y && apt-get autoremove -y\n\n\n*If the apt-get commands were executed as expected, restart your system:\nsudo telinit 6\n\n\n*If your Internet connection isn't working, run this command in order to enable the network device:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your computer is connected by cable:\nifconfig eth0 up\n\n\n*If your computer is connected by a wireless network device (wifi):\nifconfig wlan0 up && rfkill unblock 0\n\n\n*\n*\n\n*The above commands won't give you any feedback unless some problem occurs. If you're attempting to connect via wifi, run the following command in order to make your computer scan for nearby wireless networks available:\niwlist wlan0 scan\n\n\n\n*\n*\n\n*See which wireless network you want to connect to, then run this command:\niwconfig wlan0 essid ID key s:PWD\n\n\n\n*\n*\n\n*Note: replace ID with the name (SSID) of the wireless network. Also, replace PWD with the password required to connect to such network.\n\n\n*\n*\n\n*After you establish an Internet connection, execute the item 3 and then the item 4, above.\n\n\n\n*If your computer boots correctly, your next step will be installing Adobe Flash.

I was given a 1tb hard drive and I want to place ubuntu since I would have to start using it for school and I have 16 GB ram. I want to allocate the entire drive for ubuntu since I don't need the extra space. Is there a reason I shouldn't, or should?\n\nA: If you are a fan of linux/ubuntu and you plan to stay on it for life - that means that you will not need to install other OS (operating system), you will play games only in ubuntu / wine - then use whole space for it. \nYou can always add another (smaller) HDD if you would need to install another OS, or you can install another OS into VirtualBox.\nOn the other hand if you will need some other OS for example Windows because of gaming, or use some specific graphic programs that do not run on Ubuntu then I would leave some space free (windows installation = at least 30gb, games = additional 50-70gb just to be sure). You can always mount this NTFS space into linux to have it visible in Ubuntu too.\n\nA: There shouldn't be any reason for not using the whole drive. If you don't plan on dual booting or anything like that .. then you might as well use the hole drive. \n", "Q: How can I delete encrypted files to recover HDD space? I tried to re-install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and I unknowingly checked on the option of Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security. Unfortunately I stopped the installation at midway, and then began to install Ubuntu without the  encryption option. Nonetheless I think some files managed to get encrypted because my hard drive partition is not reporting all the memory there is: this partition is 991 GB, but the system tells me its capacity is 975 GB and that 925.5 GB are free. This doesn't make sense! \nI used an external HDD to backup my important stuff and I (slow) formatted the partition. I am currently running Ubuntu with a live USB, so I don't  really care about my files. What I am trying to solve is to delete the suspected encrypted files, so I can recover about 65 GB of lost/encrypted space. I still remember the pass-phrase I created, but i have no clue of what to do next; I haven't really do any encryption/decryption before. I am also new to Ubuntu,  so there are some technical things which I'm not very familiar with. \nI am posting a picture about the properties of the hard drive (notice the suspicious gray area on the pie):\nhard drive space\nI am really open to suggestions in any case or if the problem doesn't have anything to do with encrypted files. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You can probably do this with the Disks utility that comes with Ubuntu, but I find that installing GParted is much easier and more clear.  Maybe I am partial to it, but it just seems more human readable to me.\nAnyway, go to the Ubuntu Software application and install GParted.  Once it finishes, run it.  If you don't see it available to run, just reboot and look again.  It asks for your password when you first start it up.  This is normal, but be careful not to make changes to your filesystem unless you mean to.\nOnce in GParted, make sure you hard drive is selected in the upper right.  It is usually /dev/sda or possibly /dev/sdb, or something similar.  Look for the right hard drive size you have installed.\nIn the bottom part of this program you should now see any partitions that are listed on that drive.  If you see anything that says crypt-luks or similar, it may be that encrypted partition you were talking about.  It is normal to see one for /boot, one for /, sometimes one for /home, and there may be one that is marked as swap space.  These are all normal.\nIf your previously encrypted volume doesn't show up here at all, but you notice some free space that should be used, then you should be able to resize your partition using this tool.  Just make sure you boot from a live CD or USB first so you don't have to mess with unmounting or turning off the swap partition.  It can get messy.\nI personally would boot to the live CD/USB, kill ALL partitions on my target drive using GParted, then restart a fresh install using either full encryption or no encryption, whichever you prefer...and this time, let it finish. ;-)\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Google earth 64 starts initial screen appears then quits I have tried everything listed on this site.

I tried to kill all those processes that spawn and remain after I play the game. I'm wondering if my graphic card does not switch to some mode that can't sleep.\n\nA: I still have this problem, but have tested many possible fixes. The essence of the problem is that the suspend job fails, hangs.\nI've tried fishing through kernel logs line by line, still don't know for sure what is causing this. I thought problem was video, but now suspect it is network and/or USB-C support. \nWhen the suspend fails, log in again, open a terminal. If in ps aux output, you see something like this, then you are in same situation.\n$ ps aux | grep sus\nroot     22926  0.0  0.0   8668   840 ?        Ss   23:07   0:00 /lib/systemd/systemd-sleep suspend\n\nThat job, 22926, can be killed, which will cause the PC to suspend immediately.\n$ sudo kill -9 22926\n\nThis week, I've found a pretty good way to avoid this.  Create a script file like this:\nsudo /etc/init.d/network-manager stop\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking stop\nsudo systemctl suspend\n\nFor me, this reduces the delay when suspending and it has never failed yet\nWhen you restart, you need to remember to re-start network manually.\nsudo /etc/init.d/network-manager stop\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking stop\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking start\nsudo /etc/init.d/network-manager start\n\nThis again tells network to close down, just for fun, and restarts it.\nThis is a high level solution. I've been into the weeds, changing lots of details within suspend scripts.  Nothing has worked as well as this.\nThe other interesting thread I found on this was that the hardware devices are malfunctioning and causing a false wakeup.  I tried that, but no benefit.

I am a technology enthusiast and try to taste all new technologies (wherever possible) coming in Computing world. So, naturally, when Canonical released 16.04 LTS on 22nd April, I downloaded 16.04 LTS(original ISO Unity) and tried to install (completely cleaned the 128 GB SSD with GParted boot disk and attempted to fresh Install, \"single boot\").\nI used USB flash to boot (UEFI mode) Ubuntu. When \"Install Ubuntu\" option came on the screen and I pressed 'Enter' but screen went blank and never recovered any graphics to show in the monitor screen. But, looking into the Hard-disk indicator light I could assume that system is busy but 'NO DISPLAY' on monitor screen.This was partly informed guess as I already read few articles about fglrx/catalyst/AMD/ATI Opensource driver.\nNext, I installed KUbuntu 15.10 and when Software manager asked for Upgrade  into 16.04 LTS, tried to upgrade. During upgrade I got few messages from Installer and noted them down for future reference.\n\"Replacing /etc/default/rcS\";\n\"Removing 63 packages from /usr/share/sddm/scripts/Xsession\";\n\"setting up xserver-xorg-video-amdgpu\".\nI chose everything as 'YES' in the above cases.\nFinally, upgrading was completed and system asked for reboot.After reboot, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS never came up on the monitor screen (it just went blank, same like the fresh install).Below is the hardware in my system.\nSo, my question is: Is it not possible to install 16.04 LTS in my system?\nBelow is some information about the system:\nkubuntu1404               \n    description: Computer\n    width: 64 bits\n    capabilities: vsyscall32\n  *-core\n       description: Motherboard\n       physical id: 0\n     *-memory\n          description: System memory\n          physical id: 0\n          size: 14GiB\n     *-cpu\n          product: AMD A10-5800K APU with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics\n          vendor: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]\n          physical id: 1\n          bus info: cpu@0\n          size: 1400MHz\n          capacity: 1400MHz\n          width: 64 bits\n      *-display\n             description: VGA compatible controller\n             product: Trinity [Radeon HD 7660D]\n             vendor: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Canonical has has discontinued support for the proprietary fglrx driver but the existing radeon/amdgpu drivers are sufficient replacement.\n\nNote: I had \"vanilla\" Ubuntu 15.10 installed on this system from USB drive and then upgraded to 16.04 LTS.\n\nA: I have the same issue with A6-5400K (MB Biostar A55ML2, VGA output on the MB). I have upgraded from Xubuntu 15.10 to 16.04, and all I get after boot menu is black screen. Sometimes picture appears after an hour or so. First I thought there might be some HDD error, so I have attached same HDD to my other PC (A10-7850K, Asus A88XM-Plus, DVI and HDMI outputs on R7 260X), and everything was fine.\nIt is the same with live disk (from USB drive) – doesn’t work on A6-5400K, works on my other PC.\n\nA: fglrx does not support the newer A10 series APUs, as they were released after the final fglrx release (15.12).\nfglrx DOES support the older A10 series with Terrascale gpus (A10-5700/5800x and older) but not the newer GCN models like the entire 7xxx series.\nYou HAVE to use amdgpu (or amdgpu-pro) on them, but the support and tools for that driver set are still VERY limited and primitive.\n", "Q: install Qgifer on ubuntu 16.04?

I would like to install Ubuntu 16.04 on the newer MacBooks like MacBook Air 2013-mid, however I want to know more about user experiences of 16.04 on newer MacBooks. \nMy final decision:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook 2013-mid was too unstable for me eventually with Ubuntu, although there are many general guidelines to set it up, but little workflows. \nI have experienced similar issues in newer MacBooks with scientific computing. \n\n*MacBooks, not even the 2016 model, are not stable for scientific computing on Ubuntu. \nThere are several buggy firmwares, where the manufacturers (Intel, ...) have no incentives to improve the firmwares because of small market. \nThere are closed stable firmwares privately, but you cannot update your system at all if you stick that.\nMy  conclusions about Ubuntu on MacBooks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not use Ubuntu for scientific computing on MacBooks. \n\n*I do not recommend to use Ubuntu for educational uses targeting vertical understanding in many areas on MacBooks because Ubuntu's package management and window manager has substantial artifacts on Apple systems. \n\n\nDifferential solution: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use more open hardware on Ubuntu. Asus Zenbooks work great.    \n\n\nDifferential OS in scientific computing: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use Debian if you need rock stability. Ubuntu was not stable enough for me (not even on Lenovo, Dell and Asus hardware) and its support too immature for advanced use case. I have experienced one system crash in 4 months with my new work configuration, in comparison to my previous Ubuntu settings - many weekly system crashes\n\n\nDifferential OS as first and/or hobbyist Linux user: \n\n\n*\n\n*I do recommend Ubuntu because you can get sufficient support here.    \n\n\nA: Macbooks are well supported in 16.04.

Although I guess only 64-bit will work.\n", "Q: Servers Hardware Certification of kernel upgrades I am trying to figure out the HW certification policy for older HW (my interest is servers).\nWhen a new point-release or HWE is available, it usually includes a Linux kernel update. Is there a certification procedure for new kernels with existing/old HW? \nI'll give an example for clarification: this is the certification page for HP DL380 Gen9. As you can see, it is certified for 12.04.5, 14.04.1 and 16.04.\nDoes that mean that 12.04.4 (which includes a different Linux kernel) is not certified?\n14.04.2 is based on kernel 3.16 (certified) while 14.04.1 is kernel 3.13. Does that mean that if I want a certified system I cannot upgrade to latest 14.04 point-releases?\n\nA: There is one interesting fact about a new point release. We can divide it into 2 parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Software stack.\n\n*Hardware Enablement (HWE) Stack, the kernel part.\n\n\nLet's take 14.04.1 Ubuntu Trusty (with 3.13 series kernel) for example. When running upgrade with sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your software stack will be upgraded to the latest version, which is 14.04.4 now.\n\n*Your kernel stack will stay on 3.13 series, instead of upgrading to the 4.2 kernel that shipped with 14.04.4. \n\n\nIn this case, you will only be ask to upgrade the HWE stack when the 3.13 kernel has reached its end of life in Apr. 2019. (Or you can do this manually, run sudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-wily, change wily to any other distro name, but you won't need this if the 3.13 kernel works fine with your hardware)\nSo to your question, you should be able to use the command described at the very beginning to upgrade the system from the certified 14.04.1 to the latest point release without causing any problem, as the kernel is the same 3.13 series.\nYou can check this fact after an upgrade, with uname -a to check your kernel and lsb_release -a to check the software stack.\n", "Q: PowerTOP issue with fresh 16.04 install on ThinkPad E555 Here's what happened when I tried to set optimum settings after installing PowerTOP:\nReading package lists ...

Go to the settings of your selected account, go to the page, where the SMTP server is specified, change the port to the number your provider uses (e.g. 465 instead of 587 which in my case was automatically assigned by Evolution) and select the correct method of authentification (e.g. STARTTLS). Furthermore you can try to change the folder where Evolution saves your messages on the next page of the account settings. Often it is called \"Sent Item\", but Evolution tries to use a folder \"Sent\". \nIf none of the above works you could try to tell Evolution to save sent messages in a local folder on your computer by enabling the local account and setting it as the saving destination.\nI hope that this helps.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch: where are downloaded files stored?

Because I have to personalize their out-of-the-box experience, I need automated solution.\nSetting up GNOME seems to be little tricky, because everything is stored inside dconf database. I managed to set up wallpaper, fonts, themes or Metacity using schema override (according to instructions here), but I can't figure out how to configure panels.\nI'm convinced that this can be achieved with dconf too. For example, my current Indicator Applet Complete settings (object-iid, pack-index, etc.) are stored inside /org/gnome/gnome-panel/layout/objects/object-0-1. Unfortunately there is no schema (as described in the picture here) and that's why I am unable to create predefined settings file.\nThe only thing I want to have is black 30px panel on the top, with Main Menu applet in the left-top corner, and Indicator Applet Complete in the right-top corner - predefined for every newly created user. I'd like to avoid copying whole ~/.config/dconf/user file, because it's in special format that I'm unable to parse.\n\nA: Default panel configuration is stored in /usr/share/gnome-panel/panel-default-layout.layout file.\nYou can edit it, but better idea might be copy this file to ~/.config/gnome-panel/panel-default-layout.layout and only then edit it.\nThat will allow you to change default applets and panel size. But this file must be available before user logs in session (before gnome-panel is started).\nFor background color you can use schema override. Background schema id is org.gnome.gnome-panel.toplevel.background. To set black background you need to change two keys:\n\n\n*\n\n*type from none to color\n\n*color from rgba(255,255,255,.2) to rgba(0,0,0,1)\nBut currently there is no way to change text color on panel.

I'm comfortable with the command line so I don't mind if your answers are about doing a manual install via the terminal.\nSearching didn't reveal much and all the results are talking about the opposite (putting a GUI on Ubuntu Server), and while I know I can uninstall the GUI later on I would prefer to not install it altogether.\nThanks.\n\nA: The Desktop installer is designed to rely for the most part on packages put on the ISO for the desktop edition including the GUI. It is not designed to install the GUI-less Server edition.\nYou have two real options here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Desktop edition, then install server after wards and strip out the GUI packages.\n\n*Download and install with the Server ISO.  This will provide server packages on the ISO and the ability to select additional server packages to install and configure.\n\n\nYou don't really have other options here - unless you want a hybrid of Desktop/Server.\n\nA: The Server download is anyway much, much lighter than the desktop ISO, but here:\nI don't know if there is a way to selectively install packages on the Desktop installer,  but you can do this on an installed Desktop system:\nsudo apt-get purge ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-server\n\n", "Q: How do I install and dual boot Windows 8 Pro alongside Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (installed first)?

I looked at the README.md file in the developer's page here: https://github.com/numixproject/numix-gtk-theme. A couple of quotes from there:\n\nIf you want to hack on the theme, make sure you have the inotifywait command available, which is used for watching and automatically building the files.\n\nand\n\nIf you change any assets, you'll need to regenerate the gtk.gresource.xml and gtk.gresource files. You can use grrr to do it easily. \n\nSo how can a normal, average user change any aspect of the Numix theme available for 16.04? Can someone familiar with gtk3 themes that use scss rather than only plain css please explain the procedure?\n\nA: After a bit of reading on the subject and then re-reading the readme.md at the numix project I realised they actually do explain how to manually install and make changes to their theme.\nThe thing is that the instructions assume alot of prerequisite knowledge - basically that you are a C developer who knows CSS.\nI'm assuming you know that source code for languages like C get compiled into binary executables and/or library files, and that SASS/SCSS is a pre-compiler (a kind of \"higher\" language) that gets compiled to CSS which is source code  that is interpreted - and not compiled to a binary form.\nFrom what I can tell the overview is like this:\n                          +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n +------+                 |  +---------------------+                                     |\n |      |   you need to   |  | CSS files           |         Numix theme                 |\n |SASS  |   \"compile\"     |  | ordinary text (code)|         i.e. files in               |\n |files |   SASS to CSS   |  |                     |         /usr/share/themes/Numix Daily/gtk-3.0\n |    +------------------------->             <------------------------------------------+----------+\n |      |                 |  +---------------------|                                     |          |\n |      |                 |   +------------------------+                                 |          |\n +------+                 |   | gtk.resource           |                                 |          |\n If you change this       |   | (compiled binary    <-----+                              |          |\n you need to recompile    |   | file)                  |  |                              |          |\n (update the CSS          |   +------------------------+  |                              |          |\n                          +--------------------------------------------------------------+          |\n files)                      +----------------------+     |                                         |\n                             | GTK library          |     |  +---------------------------+          |\n+--------------------+       | (binary library)     |     |  |  GTK and C developer tools|          |\n| Application        |       |                      |     |  |  used to recompile        |          |\n| e.g. Gnome terminal|       | Configured to use    |     |  |  gtk.gresource            |          |\n| Nautilus etc       |       | Numix Theme          |     |  |                           |          |\n| that uses GTK      |       |                      |     +----+                         |          |\n| library            |       |                      |        |                           |          |\n| (binary            |       |                      |        |                           |          |\n| executable)        |       |                      |        +---------------------------+          |\n+--------------------+       |                      |                                               |\n                             |Makes call to         +                                               |\n                             |gtk_css_provider_load_from_file() +----------------------------------->\n                             |\n                             +----------------------+\n\nSo the Numix theme and I guess many/all GTK-3.0 themes comprise of binary resources and CSS code which is parsed by the function call gtk_css_provider_load_from_file() which seems to be a new addition to GTK-3.0.\nThe numix project suggests you only need to recompile the gtk-gresource if you change any assets. So I wouldn't bother with that - unless you really need to. If you really need here is an introduction to building a GTK binary resource\nUseful resources\n\n\n*\n\n*GtkCssProvider - this is responsible for parsing the CSS - it seems to really be the foundation for making GTK applications able to read CSS.\nparticularly how GTK will read CSS code for a theme on startup:\n\n\n\nAn application can cause GTK+ to parse a specific CSS style sheet by calling gtk_css_provider_load_from_file() and adding the provider with gtk_style_context_add_provider() or gtk_style_context_add_provider_for_screen().\n  In addition, certain files will be read when GTK+ is initialized. First, the file $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-3.0/gtk.css is loaded if it exists.\n  Then, GTK+ tries to load $HOME/.themes/theme-name/gtk-3.0/gtk.css, falling back to datadir/share/themes/theme-name/gtk-3.0/gtk.css, where theme-name is the name of the current theme (see the \"gtk-theme-name\" setting) and datadir is the prefix configured when GTK+ was compiled, unless overridden by the GTK_DATA_PREFIX environment variable. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*A good introduction to GTK themes - http://www.linux.org/threads/installing-obtaining-and-making-gtk-themes.8463/\n\n*Gnome docs on theming\n", "Q: Where can I find the source code for the apt package manager?

In order to use the AMD card, you would have to install fglrx.\nUnfortunately for you, fglrx is no longer supported in 16.04, nor will it work if installed. There is a proprietary driver that is in development, but I don't believe it is very stable.\nFor now, you'll either have to wait until a proprietary AMD driver comes out for 16.04 or downgrade to 14.04 or 15.10 so you can use fglrx.\n\nA: You may want to read this first !\nWhy Radeon Users May Want to Avoid Ubuntu 16.04 \nAnd before you do ,this is the part of the article which will break your heart.\n\nYou can not re-install the fglrx/catalyst driver (or its display stack) from the Ubuntu 16.04 archives after the upgrade completes as the driver is, bluntly, no longer there.\nFurthermore, you cannot download and install the fglrx/catalyst driver\n  using binary packages from the AMD website as, even if you could get\n  them to install, the driver does not support Xorg 1.18¹ that ships in\n  Xenial.\nTo top it all off Canonical say: “AMD won’t support fglrx on 16.04,\n  period”, and Canonical has no desire to take over the duties (which it\n  would have to support for the next five years kids, as this is an\n  LTS).\n\n", "Q: Wifi wont work with Ubuntu I am currently unable to find any wifi connections in Ubuntu.

I've been using openvpn to connect to a work VPN for years and years via a .ovpn config file that's always worked.\nNow, however, something having to do with systemd seems to have changed the way things work. When I try to start it, I get a message broadcast out via wall:\n\nBroadcast message from root@turandot (Sun 2016-05-01 10:25:50 CDT):\nPassword entry required for 'Enter Auth Username:' (PID 17284).\n  Please enter password with the systemd-tty-ask-password-agent tool!\n\nI've googled around for it and found nothing that seems like a solution to the problem. What's the new way to open a VPN connection?\n\nA: Every time on startup, I was asked to \"Enter Auth Username\" and \"Enter Auth Password\" and I periodically got the same messages in the terminal as OP did. I can just hit Enter or type in whatever I want, it makes no difference. (Ubuntu 17.10 and 18.04)\nSo instead of \"reinstalling the whole OS\", I just commented out the line auth-user-pass in /etc/openvpn/client.conf\nNow, the messages both on startup and in the terminal don't bother me anymore.\n\nA: I know is old but, it may help someone...\nThe way that I did to fix it (unfortunately I don't remember where I got the information) You can do this:\nsudo systemctl disable systemd-ask-password-wall.service\nsudo systemctl disable systemd-ask-password-wall.path\nsudo systemctl stop systemd-ask-password-wall.service\nsudo systemctl stop systemd-ask-password-wall.path\nsudo systemctl enable systemd-ask-password-console.service\nsudo systemctl start systemd-ask-password-console.service\n\ncreate a file: /etc/openvpn/pass(or wherever you want) put the passphrase and in the server.conf add, don't forget to secure pass file (sudo chmod 400 pass)\naskpass pass\n\n\nA: This happens since Ubuntu 15.10 uses systemd to start openvpn. Following seems to work me for me. After you start openvpn and get the error message from the terminal do the following\nsudo systemd-tty-ask-password-agent\n\nYou will be prompted to enter your username. Now type in the same command again\nsudo systemd-tty-ask-password-agent\n\nThis time you will be prompted to enter your password. After entering the password start the vpn connection again. For me I do it with the following command\nsudo service openvpn start\n\nNow it should connect successfully.\n\nA: Problem fixed. After some checks inside the openvpn log I discovered that this problem was generated because the row \"auth-user-pass login.txt\" doesn't work. Inside the file \"login.txt\" there was the credential (user and passw). Trying the same configuration file on a different linux machine worked. There as no reason for a different behaviour. Simply reinstalling the whole OS the problem disappear. \n\nA: This is an example showing that a generation of programmers has retired or died and the new generation doesn't have idea on what to do.\nI observed the same problem after a while without using OpenVPN to access an University network. Before, it was working ok. I'm running Debian 8 (Jessie). I don't know if the fact of choosing a female character from Toy's Story has anything to do intentionally or not but anyway. This is the way I found it works:\nFirst you run your command:\nsudo /etc/init.d/openvpn start\n\nand you get the annoying message:\nBroadcast message from root@lenovo (Sun 2019-03-24 19:35:37 EET):\n\nPassword entry required for 'Enter Auth Username:' (PID 5516).\nPlease enter password with the systemd-tty-ask-password-agent tool!\n\nNow, press CTRL+C to come back to the shell prompt again, go to the fridge, get a beer and run the command again:\nsudo /etc/init.d/openvpn start\n\nand you will see:\n[....] Starting openvpn (via systemctl): openvpn.serviceEnter Auth Username:\n\n(drink). Enter your username to authenticate to your service (e.g. University logon). You will see the asterisks as if your username has to be secret (drink again). And this will be spitted on your terminal:\nBroadcast message from root@lenovo (Sun 2019-03-24 19:40:58 EET):\n\nPassword entry required for 'Enter Auth Password:' (PID 5716).\nPlease enter password with the systemd-tty-ask-password-agent tool!\n\n. ok \n\nYou see again the annoying thing. But just ignore it (and drink). Then, run again your command:\nsudo /etc/init.d/openvpn start\n\nand voilà! you will see now:\n[....] Starting openvpn (via systemctl): openvpn.serviceEnter Auth Password:\n\nNow enter your password and continue drinking, and you will just see the response:\n. ok\n\non your terminal (drink).\nThat's it. If you open Google and type 'what's my ip' you will see that now you are connected to the private network.\nEnjoy your beer!\nPS: if in the middle of this crappy process you make some mistake while typing your username or password, the chances are that your terminal hangs up, so just close it and start typing again the commands until you succeed.\n", "Q: How can I find the reference manuals of the installed libraries?

Evidently, I had re-formatted my encrypted home partition as LUKS even though I had never even committed to any changes by pressing 'Continue'.  When I attempt to access the partition after unlocking it with my password, I receive the message, \"The unlocked device does not have a recognizable file system on it.\"  The partition had been originally formatted as EXT4 and I believe used encryptfs (whatever was the standard at the time of the release of Ubuntu 14.04).  How do I fix this?!!  I've created an image of the partition using TestDisk and when I opened it using PhotoRec, PhotoRec only found two .gpg files, a .tib file, three non-playable .mp3 files, a .dbx file, and an .ab file. Unfortunately, I had stupidly not backed up the 600GB partition as I had never had an issue with an Ubuntu installation before, and now I'm regretting it!  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you.\n\nA: How much time did the failed/aborted installer spend writing to the drive?\nIt would take a long time to overwrite all 600GB, and I'm not sure but just setting up LUKS it may not attempt (the recommended secure practice) to overwrite with zeros before creating a filesystem - and it didn't successfully create a filesystem from the \"no recognizable filesystem\" message.\nIt may have been able to run wipefs though, which may explain why testdisk couldn't find anything.\nYour testdisk & photorec attempts are what I'd suggest too, but photorec should have found more than just a handful of corrupted files out of 600GB. Unless photorec can't recognize eCryptfs files, but it's File Formats Recovered by Photorec page says it should know  \".ecr &\n.eCryptfs Encrypted file by eCryptfs\".\nBut, you may not have imaged enough of the drive. The new home partition that was created may not be in the same place as the old home partition. If you had the old home's start/end sectors you could see if it matches, and try imaging/recovering just where the old home used to be...\nTrying testdisk's analyze quick & deeper search on the entire drive couldn't hurt now (as long as the drive isn't failing), and/or having photorec search the entire drive for only eCryptfs files...\n(I've heard about the Ubuntu installer overwriting things by accident before, don't remember the pressing \"continue\" detail, but it's not encouraging to hear. Makes me not want to have any irreplaceable drives even powered on when installing. Definitely want a backup next time)\n\nA: Thanks for the reply.  It wasn't long at all before I had aborted the installation.  It should have never proceeded to do anything before I continued to the next step.  For one thing, the Ubiquity developers should have realised that many people only upgrade from LTS to LTS so might not know about the new changes in encryption.  In previous releases, I was accustomed to being prompted to input a password for the encryption so that the /home partition would be unlocked upon login, so I had thought it was safe to select my /home partition to be mounted as /home and tick it for encryption.  Once I ticked the box and saw that it had automatically selected the 'Format' box, as well, I panicked and immediately reverted the changes.  Once I determined that I wasn't sure how to proceed, I aborted the installation altogether.  \nYes, I should have backed up my /home partition, but in my six years of using Ubuntu, I NEVER had any issues with a fresh installation of Ubuntu.  The Ubiquity folks really dropped the ball on this one.  It would be nice if one of them could post to this thread and at least tell me what exactly their installer did to my drive.\nDuring the preliminary installation process, I never requested any re-partitioning, so the /home partition that I had selected was the exact same one for 14.04.  I've tried the \"Quick & Deeper\" search on the entire drive, and it finds nothing.  The file system is just gone.  I wish I knew what Ubiquity did!  I'm leaving the partition alone and hoping that SOMEONE will know of a way to salvage my data, but it's not looking good.....\n(P.S.

I tried cd ~/Downloads and I get the no such directory message. I can't seem to navigate anywhere. \nIf it helps, When I type pwd it says /root. When I type echo $PATH it shows: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8\nAny help is appreciated, its probably a simple solution, thanks a lot!\n\nA: The solution is that you are logged into the Bash shell as root. The beginning of the cursor line should say your username @ your computer name not root @ your computer name and the end of the cursor should have a $ not a  #. The root account doesn't have a Downloads directory which is why you are getting the error.\nIf this is the case you can type exit and press enter  this should bring you back to where it will have your username@yourcomputername and the $ at the end. If all else fails you can close Bash and open it again and it should start you in your user's 'home' directory. \nOnce set this way, typing cd ~/Downloads (in Ubuntu/Linux it is case sensitive) will bring you into your Downloads directory. The Bash shell mirrors the Windows drive structure. The downloads folder is the same folder as Windows default download folder ... C:/Users/yourusername/Downloads\nThe original poster was having problems with the bash shell always using root. I have tried everything to get the initial screen back where you enter the Unix user name and password but wasn't able to find a way without breaking the shell. \nThe way I was able to get back to that initial setting was to create a new Windows account. Log into that account and then reboot \nnote I had to log in and let it set up the account then I had to reboot because some of the files needed for the bash didn't seem to be in place and it seemed to hang when I tried but the reboot solved that. \nThen I launched a cmd prompt and type bash to get the following screen.  \nAt this point I screwed up again... I picked the name Don for the UNIX name and put in a password .. everything worked well until I tried cd ~/Desktop and it threw an error.  \nThe error said \nbash: cd: /home/don/Desktop: No such file or directory\n\nIf you notice in the image the user directory for this account I created is donat not don .. so the ~/Desktop is using the \"username\" to find the directory \nBecause of this I would have had to use donat as the Unix name for everything to work properly. \nSo if you have to create a new account to set this up properly .. Make sure you make note of what directory that new account is using and make that your UNIX login name matches the directory name. \nAs I said, if I look at explorer  and look at the path C:\\Users\\ the \"Home\" folder is donat for this account. \nUnder further messing around I found that it seems that Windows and the Bash running in Windows doesn't like the ~/directory shortcuts. You will have to use full paths such as /mnt/c/Users/username/Downloads to access your download folder you can't just use ~/Downloads. \n", "Q: Sublime Text 3 dpkg error I want to install Sublime Text 3 , but had a problem, my terminal is showing this error:\n\ndpkg: error: dpkg status database is locked by another process\n\nWhat shall I do?\n\nA: This is probably because apt-get is being used already.

I hope when I update Windows and/or Ubuntu they don't mess with this!\n\nA: The direct answer to your question is no.\nHowever, it is possible to achieve your end goal by installing Ubuntu (and thus GRUB) to the mSATA without the other drive connected.\nNext, install Windows to the other drive without the mSATA disconnected.\nThen connect both, and set the other drive before the mSATA in the boot order.\n\nA: I don't see the need to disconnect the drives.

This does seem a bit strange to me, are there plans in maybe later releases for the gnome-software application to completely replace the update-manager or is it just going to stay like this for ever with two applications installed that can do the same thing?\n\nA: This is because the gnome-software application can only handle app upgrades, not core system upgrades such as kernel upgrades, so the update-manager is needed for that.\nThough this is likely to be a work in progress as on Fedora they have already managed to get the gnome-software application to handle core system upgrades, but they have a different backend to Ubuntu so it may take some time before the gnome-software application fully replaces the update-manager.\n", "Q: Apache2 All catalogs without index.html or php are forbidden All catalogs that havent index.html, or .php are forbidden.

I have just done this once, so I won't claim to be an authority on this. My quick take, you are using incorrect syntax. Below is a copy of my \"fstab\" file.  Note the syntax for mounting a logical volume.\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

Use that image to ascertain your mount points with VLM. You can also see your disk drive layout under LVM by using the command below:\nsudo lvdisplay\n\nI also wrote a short tutorial (based on my one and only experience), which may be of some use: Create Logical \"Home\" Volume When Using Logical Volume Management (VLM) \nPS: If you do a clean install of Ubuntu, there is a checkbox for using LVM (in my case), so there is no need to actually install LVM should you see that checkbox and check it.\n\nA: Not to detract from the accepted answer, but wanted to offer a more complete solution that hasn't failed me yet.\nudisksctl unlock -b /dev/sdb5\nsudo mkdir /mnt/data\nsudo mount /dev/dm-1 /mnt/data\n\nrun into mount: unknown filesystem type 'LVM2_member' do the commands below\nsudo bash\nvgdisplay\nvgrename <VG UUID> new_name\nmodprobe dm-mod\nvgchange -ay\nlvscan\nmount /dev/new_name/root /mnt/data/\n\n\nA: Here is a solution that also works for cloned disks, unlike the accepted answer.\n\nI have done another install but now when trying to mount my original drive … I get this message: mount: unknown filesystem type 'LVM2_member'\n\nThis happens because both your old and new installation use LVM, probably because you enabled hard disk encryption. Ubuntu will use ubuntu-vg as the volume group name (similar to a disk name) for the installation, and this causes a problem because LVM can only access one of the volume groups in case two or more have the same volume group name. In your case, one is already in use since booting the system, so trying to access the other installation fails.\nThis is pretty identical to the issue when you want to use LVM to access both a disk and its clone. The LVM system provides the vgimportclone command for this purpose. Compared to the currently accepted answer, this has the advantage that it allows renaming the inaccessible volume group, which is not possible with vgrename for cases where you cannot find out the VG UUID, for example because it is the same as an existing one, as in cases of cloned disks.\nInstructions:\n\n*\n\n*If the LVM volume group is on an encrypted partition, first open the encrypted partition to make it visible to LVM commands:\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb5 sdb5_crypt\n\n\n\n*Then use vgimportclone to rename the volume group:\nsudo vgimportclone --basevgname ubuntu-vg-old /dev/mapper/sdb5_crypt\n\nIn case of an unencrypted LVM volume group, use /dev/sdb5 in place of /dev/mapper/sdb5_crypt as the device identifier.\n\n\n*The devices in the volume group now named ubuntu-vg-old should now be available for mounting by clicking on the corresponding device in a file manager, or for manual mounting with:\nsudo mkdir /media/username/ubuntu-vg-old-root\nsudo mount /dev/mapper/sdb5_crypt /media/username/ubuntu-vg-old-root\n\n\n\n*If mounting does not yet work, you might have to disconnect and reconnect the encrypted partition to let Ubuntu recognize the changed volume group name:\nsudo dmsetup remove /dev/mapper/sdb5_crypt\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb5 sdb5_crypt\n\n\nA: Try the following steps from the shell:\nsudo cryptsetup isLuks /dev/sdb5 -v\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb5 newhd\nsudo lvscan # Check if LVs are active.\nsudo vgchange -ay # Activate LVs if not active.\nsudo lvdisplay # List logical volumes (note the LV Path).\nsudo mount /dev/ubuntu-vg/root /mnt\nmount # List mounted filesystems.\nxdg-open /mnt # Open in file explorer\n\n\nA: You used the exact same name (ubuntu-vg) for your new volume group as the old volume group.  You must give them unique names. You can rename one of the groups using vgrename and its UUID.\nFind the UUID with vgdisplay and then rename the volume group:\nvgrename <VG UUID> new_name\n\n\nA: sudo bash\nvgdisplay\nvgrename  new_name\nmodprobe dm-mod\nvgchange -ay\nlvscan\nmount /dev/new_name/root /mnt\nAfter renaming will I be lost any data. (As we have migrated disk from one server to another and we are getting same error. Just to make sure before making changes prod environment )\n\nA: I got the same error message, but in my case I was trying to mount what I thought was my root partition, but when I found @Pascal's answer to a related question on SuperUser - linked by @Tisaconundrum and ran lsblk, I found that it was a logical volume group that contained swap and root logical volumes.\nWith that information and @SteveR's answer here, I mounted it by using: mount /dev/mapper/<logicalVolumeName> /mnt/<mountPoint> where <logicalVolumeName> was gleaned from lsblk output.\n\nA: That's not the way LV's are mounted, you're missing some important parts.\nAfter creating the Logical Volume (LV) that belongs to a Volume Group (VG) that's part of one or more Physical Volume/s (PV), you need to find the path to the volume.\nYou can do that by lvdisplay and you'll see something like \nLV Path /dev/books-vg/books_volume\nYou're going to copy this path, and create a Filesystem (because it's not a Filesystem yet, it's just a Partition - and that's why you can't mount it). So you need to format this Partition and create the Filesystem:\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/books-vg/books_volume\n\nthe output will look something like\nmke2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)                                                   \nCreating filesystem with 13107200 4k blocks and 3276800 inodes                 \nFilesystem UUID: f00a7051-6203-4c18-9d95-b589aae48606                          \nSuperblock backups stored on blocks:                                           \n        32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208,\n        4096000, 7962624, 11239424                                             \n\nAllocating group tables: done                                                  \nWriting inode tables: done                                                     \nCreating journal (32768 blocks): done                                          \nWriting superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done                \n\nAnd now, finally, you can mount the volume:\nmount /dev/books-vg/books_volume /mnt\n\n", "Q: How would ubuntu 14.04 run on my hardware So I'm very new to Ubuntu. I'm building a new computer to run on Ubuntu and I'm just wondering how Ubuntu 14.04 would run on the following hardware I have purchased:\n\n\n*\n\n*4gb DDR3 ram\n\n*AMD Phenom 2 Quad Core 2.5 GHz to 3.7 GHz (not sure)\n\n*EVGA Nvidia GForce GT 610\n\n*WD Blue 1TB Desktop Hard Disk Drive - 7200 RPM SATA 6 Gb/s 64MB Cache\n\n\nA: It will run fine.

Its a bit slow on boot and if Windows 10 is chugging along it can be a bit unresponsive but .. I'm really stressing the hardware ... I think you would be fine with that... maybe an upgrade to 8g or 16g ram might help a bit more. \nI also agree with the other poster .. I use Xubuntu on the server I mentioned above\n", "Q: How to check for executable files in a given directory and its sub-directories? I understand that it is a bad practice to keep files owned by oneself in one's home area which are executable, so I am in need of a script/tool which checks recursively through a given directory (in this case my home directory) and all of its sub-directories etc (should check hidden files and folders obviously too) and outputs the name and location of any files which are executable, it should also indicate the owner of the file. I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, is something like this possible?\n\nA: find ~ -type f -executable should work. Maybe add -exec ls -l {} \\; to get user and group. \n\nA: find command is the most appropriate for this task, in combination with stat , you can see the owner of the file \nfind $HOME -type f -executable -printf \"FILE:%p OWNER: \"   -exec stat -c \"%U\" {} \\;\n\nOr purely with find printf:\nfind $HOME -executable -printf \"FILE:%p OWNER:%u\\n \" \n\nAnd if you're adventurous enough, here's a pythonic solution:\nimport os\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk( os.getcwd()  ):\n    for name in files:\n        file=os.path.join(root,name)\n        owner_uid=os.stat(file).st_uid\n        if os.access(file,os.X_OK):\n           print(file,owner_uid)\n\n", "Q: 16.04 LTS wifi connection lost randomly every 5 minutes First I had this issue described here 16.04 LTS wifi connection issues but nobody was able to provide a valid answer.\nRecently this wifi connection issue gets even worse.

When I close the lid of the notebook, it does not seem suspend whatsoever. The indicator led stays on whereas on Windows it flashes a few times and stays in a breathing state.\nAfter a bit of research, it looks like a few people had a similar issues in which they could not wake up their Thinkpads. The cause of the problem seemed to be a bug with a USB3 driver, but as the posts regarding it are two years in the past, I suspect that these bugs should be fixed by now.\nSadly, I am not too experienced with Linux, so I don't really have any idea on how to debug this problem.

In case, you are using Unity and want to switch to GNOME since it will be the default Desktop Environment from 18.04, you can use the command mentioned above. \nsudo apt install gnome-shell\n\nChoose gdm3 over lightdm, and you will get the option of login in to Ubuntu GNome session next time you start. \nInstall GNOME in Ubuntu\n\nA: +1 for Umayanga Sandeepa!\nAlso if you need to change the login manager later on you can do that with \ndpkg-reconfigure gdm3\n\nor\ndpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nrespectively.\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n\nThen choose gdm3 or lightdm\nRecommend to reboot.\nWorked for me.\n\nA: For the best Gnome experience on Ubuntu, get the official ISO.\n", "Q: How many partitions will I be able to create? I'm preparing to install Lubuntu on my laptop. \nI have already got stuck once, because apparently my system created two partitions (one recovery and the other I have no idea) and then I had C: and D: in Windows. So I couldn't create a new partition for Linux.\nTo remedy this, I removed the D: partition. My question is: will be able to install Lubuntu with all the partitions like /, /home and /swap?\nThank you.\n\nA: Yes,you only need one primary partition to install Lubuntu.Rest all partition you can create during the installation process according to your requirement.But make sure you have sufficient large primary partition in which you are planning to install.If you need any more details specific to your problem,share a screenshot of your disk management. \n\nA: You will only need 2 partitions for Linux.  One for the Linx OS and one for Swap.\nThe /home folder doesn't have to be on separate partitions.  It wouldn't hurt, but by default it's not.\nYou can use Gparted from the Install disk to edit your partition sizes.  If you have a large space you can use Gparted to create an extended partition.  The space in the extended partition becomes un-allocated space of which you can create any number of partitions.\nSo, basically you can partition the drive the way you want it.  Then on the install pick the \"Something Else\" for the install option.  Then you'll have a choice of specifying where you want Linux installed.  Pick the partition that you created for this install.\n", "Q: VLC stream problem On Ubuntu 16.04, when I play video with VLC it looks like this:\n\nI reinstalled it but no change.\nOther players work fine.\nWhat's wrong ?\n\nA: Did you try to delete the vlc settings as described in http://sourcedigit.com/16683-how-to-solve-3-common-problems-with-vlc-in-ubuntu-15-0414-0414-10/\nI found another hint wich solved the problem for me:\nhttps://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=132705\n\"...in Preferences => Input / Codecs => Hardware-accelerated decoding.

How do I install it?\n\nA: Is the file you found a .iso file? If it is, that's good! But don't open it with WinRAR. Instead, burn it to a DVD using software that can burn a disc image, or use Rufus to make a bootable USB stick.\nPlease be aware that there are different ways of installing Ubuntu, and some of them will erase everything on your computer, including Windows itself. Please make backups of all important files and read up on dual-boot setups, if that's what you're aiming for.\n\nA: I don't know what you found as a winrar file.  The forms of Ubuntu 16.04 can be found at: http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/, or http://www.ubuntu.com/download.  I wouldn't trust something that you are finding somewhere else.\nThere are some net install options as you can see from the official download site.

I want to use nouveau but whatever I do my laptop is always using Intel's driver. How can I make it use nouveau?\n\nA: This is not possible, because notebooks with intel and NVIDIA hybrid graphics use are using the intel graphics as default. When you you want to select which graphics to use, you have to install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers and Optimus support. Then you can switch between the intel and the NVIDIA graphics adapter by using the NVIDIA X Server Settings application  -> PRIME Profiles.  \nTo install the latest stable NVIDIA drivers open a terminal and execute the following commands :  \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-361 nvidia-prime\nsudo reboot  \n\nNote : This assumes that you are running the latest stable Ubuntu 16.04 edition. In case you are running Ubuntu 14.04 or 15.10, you have to install nvidia-352 drivers instead of nvidia-361.\n\nA: Make sure you dont have nvidia Geforce GT(X) 900M series (960M, 970M... etc), because nouveau does not support those cards as of May 2016.\nSince nouveau is loaded by default together with intel you only need to\nput 1 command in a terminal once your computer has started:\nxrandr --setprovideroffloadsink nouveau Intel \n\nthen you only need DRI_PRIME=1 in order to run a specific program with nouveau.\nDRI_PRIME=1 program_name\n\nreplace \"program_name\" with your applicatioin (e.g. DRI_PRIME=1 firefox )\nSee here for more info\nHowever don't expect to have good performance, since nouveau is not on par with the nvidia proprietary driver, which you can install following cl-netbox or an alternative way\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu be downloaded to a phone? I'm not that savvy when it comes to computers but am good on a phone. Can Ubuntu be installed onto a phone? \n\nA: The short answer to your question is no. While there is an Ubuntu variant that works on phones and tablets, called Ubuntu Touch, you cannot just download Ubuntu Touch and install it on your phone as you would install a regular Ubuntu desktop on a computer.\nIf you are highly tech savvy you may be able to install it on a very limited number of supported phones, and there are now some phones preinstalled with Ubuntu Touch. For somebody who claims to be \"not that savvy when it comes to computers\", installing it themselves is pretty much completely out, and I wouldn't recommend getting a preinstalled Ubuntu phone either (at this point) unless you are very familiar with Ubuntu and want to tinker with it.\nIf you are still interested, you can get more information on the Ubuntu Touch Wiki.\n\nA: The short answer to your question is yes. In the form of Ubuntu touch. Have a search on google and you will be able to find the link to download  it and install it. I have this on both my new phone and tablet. You can now buy phones and tablet with just Ubuntu on them. Still new but showing promise. The good thing is is that when you connect a blue  tooth  mouse and keyboard and HDMI monitor your phone or tablet turns into a desktop.\n", "Q: run two ongoing processes on startup with one that needs initialization time I'd like to record start recording utility consumption right at startup but I can't find the right combo of operators, pipes, and sleep commands to enter into crontab -e . I think my smartest attempt would be\n@reboot rtl_tcp || sleep 4 || ./go/bin/rtlamr -logfile=/home/ubuntu/log.json\nShouldn't this start start rtl_tcp, wait a few seconds, then start logging with rtlamr?\n\nA: An easier way would be to put your startup commands in a script, and invoke that:  \n# You could put the file in any other directory that is mounted\n# early in boot time (not your HOME directory)\ncat >>/var/local/foo <<EOF\n#!/bin/bash\n# Suggestion: use absolute path: /usr/local/bin/rtl_tcp\nrtl_tcp\nsleep 4\n# Warning - MUST specify absolute path! \".\" is probably \"/\" here.\n./go/bin/rtlamr -logfile=/home/ubuntu/log.json\nEOF\nchmod +x /var/local/foo\n\nand, in your crontab\n@reboot /var/local/foo\n\nYour expression with the ||s requires that rtl_tcp and sleep 4 each return a status of 0 so the next step will be evaluated.\n\nA: Immediately I'm noticing that your command\n@reboot rtl_tcp || sleep 4 || ./go/bin/rtlamr -logfile=/home/ubuntu/log.json\n\nuses an OR list operator (the || symbols). It does this:\n\nAn OR list has the form\ncommand1 || command2\n\ncommand2  is  executed  if  and  only if command1 returns a non-zero exit status.\n\nSo the sleep 4 command will only be run if rtl_tcp fails, and the last (logging) command only starts if sleep fails.\nTry using the AND list operator &&, it only runs the next command if the previous one succeeds.\nAnd see man bash for more info on them (Shell Grammar -> Lists).\n", "Q: Adjusting an Nvidia GPU's Fan Curve So I was trying to figure out how to make a custom fan curve for my Gigabyte GTX 960 ITX card.

It requires root, but when I try to run it as root it can't find it.\n\nA: So, it looks like you may have a version of fluxgui running in WINE. If it would not be too disruptive, you could try uninstalling WINE and seeing if that helped get rid of fluxgui. Then, when the coast is clear, you could reinstall WINE.\nThe most important files I'm seeing from what you posted:\n/home/katana/.config/autostart/fluxgui.desktop\n# launcher for the binary  \n\n/home/katana/.wine/drive_c/users/katana/Local Settings/Application Data/FluxSoftware/Flux/flux.exe\n# without the .exe the app cannot run\n\n/usr/local/bin/fluxgui\n# this is where Ubuntu looks to run your program. again the app cannot run without its binary.\n\n/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/fluxgui\n# This is interesting. This tells me that fluxgui is a Python package.\n# You could try using pip to uninstall:\n# pip uninstall fluxgui\n\n/usr/local/share/applications/fluxgui.desktop\n# again, another launcher shortcut to the binary. remove this, and the app will be difficult to run.\n\n", "Q: configuring Samsung Xpress C460w and connect it wirelessly to the router I just bought Samsung Xpress printer C460w and I installed the Linux package driver from its website, but I can't connect my printer wirelessly to my router.

I am a new with Linux, having years experience with Windows servers/desktops and am having issues setting a static IP. I am using a method used for previous versions of Ubuntu, which doesn't seem to work with 16.04\nI have used the command sudo nano /etc/network/interface and added the following\niface enp0s25 inet static\naddress 10.10.8.2\nnetmask 255.255.0.0\ngateway 10.10.1.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n\nI have rebooted the system and the Ethernet is pretty much dead, ping doesn't work at all. I have tried to modify /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and made the following changes\n#dns=dnsmasq (comment out the dnsmasq)\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=true (changed from false)\n\nWith this I can get Ethernet to work sporadically, however it eventually fails.\nI have tried this configuration on two other machines plus a virtual machine as well and all have the same results. I can confirm these settings work fine when I install Windows on any of these machines.\nAs well when I let DHCP auto configure, everything works fine no issues.\nI figure I am missing something here, setting up a static IP should not be difficult at all.\n\nA: I had the same problem and this was my solution:\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nand paste (altering for your network) this under # The primary network interface:\nauto enp0s25\niface enp0s25 inet static\naddress 192.168.0.16\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.0.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.4.4 8.8.8.8\n\nYou can get correct interface name using Terminal command ifconfig -a on ubuntu 16.04 or ip address on 18.04+\nShutdown your Virtual Machine and then!!!\nGo to network settings and click on refresh MAC address button a few times :)\n\nand start your VM and you should get internet!\nUPDATE 20.02.2019\nFor ubuntu 18.04+ you need to edit this file\n/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml\n\nnetwork:\n    ethernets:\n        enp0s3:\n            addresses: [192.168.0.55/24]\n            gateway4: 192.168.0.1\n            dhcp4: no\n            nameservers:\n              addresses: [1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8]\n            optional: true\n    version: 2\n\n\nA: Setting the static IP address as above in the accepted answer here works, but one has to flush the old IP addr setting and then restart networking.service:\nsudo ip addr flush enp0s25\nsudo systemctl restart networking.service\n\nThen verify it is correct:\nip add\n\n\nA: # interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\n# auto lo\n# iface lo inet loopback\nauto enp2s0 \niface enp2s0 inet static\n    address 172.16.9.124\n    netmask 255.255.240.0\n    gateway 172.16.0.9\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8\n\n\nA: sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces\n    auto lo\n    iface lo inet loopback\n    auto eth0\n    iface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.10\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8\n\nsudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0\n\nA: I had the same problem and the solution \"was\" simply... for me, at least.\nauto ens160\niface ens160 inet static\naddress 172.31.0.164/22\nnetmask 255.255.252.0\ngateway 172.31.0.2\nnetwork 172.31.0.0\nbroadcast 172.31.3.255\ndns-nameservers 172.31.0.21 172.31.0.18\n\n#Add internal route\nup route add -net 172.16.168.0/21 gw 172.31.0.20 dev ens160\n\nAnd, create an empty file with the name of the network interface in:\n~$ touch /etc/network/interfaces.d/ens160\n\nIt works...\n\nA: I had the same problem and this was my solution:\nRemove all empty lines at the end of the file /etc/network/interface.\n\nA: If your server is showing that old IP as well as new assigned IP, simply restart your server.

Now on my laptop, which died on me, there was a big amp drain that caused the battery to run low even with the adapter plugged in.  That meant the draw was too much for the adapter and it could not maintain the -19.5 vdc level it was rated at.  It finally fried that adapter and the upgraded adapter I got for it.  The repair shop could not find the problem, so I am out for the repairs and the price of a suitable repllacement.  Be glad you don;t have those problems.\nI can suggest trying a different LiveCD and install, even to a USB drive.  That way you can eliminate the possibility of a software glitch in the Linux build or layered software,  Go with an older LiveCD in case it is in the kernel upgrade.

I am tempted to just install over my current install with 16.04 since /home is on a separate partition, but I really don't want to have to re-install all the software on this machine. Also that's the easy way out. Can somebody please help me analyze what is happening?\n\nA: This is more of a redirect, but when I posted my broken package issue on launchpad (similarly trying to upgrade from 15.10 to 16.04), I got excellent support. In my case my issue was that I had used a foreign source (a ppa) to install some more recent graphics packages, specifically libgl1-mesa-dri, libegl1-mesa, and libgbm1. I had to downgrade those packages to the Ubuntu source versions, and then I was able to proceed with the upgrade. So my suggestion for handling broken package issues is to follow the steps in the OP, e.g.\nsudo apt-get update --fix-missing\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nand if that fails, consider whether any ppas might be introducing package versions that would interfere with stock Ubuntu packages. Additionally, if you get extremely frustrated (like I did), get support on Launchpad.\n\nA: I hate to do it, but because I needed a working system I just wiped and reinstalled. Luckily, I have my home folder on a separate partition, so all I needed to do was to format / and reinstall. Thank you to everyone who helped and hopefully this question can serve as valuable troubleshooting material. \nAnother file that I forgot to check was...sudo vi /etc/update-manager/release-upgradesI forgot that I had been changing the value of Prompt=lts  to Prompt=normal\n", "Q: Ubuntu Can`t Boot After Failing To Install This is my situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had in my hard drive two operating systems: Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Precise Pangolin.\n\n*Using a bootable USB stick, I created another partition to install in it the newer Ubuntu MATE 16.04 LTS Xenial Xerus (the operating system in the bootable USB stick).\n\n*After creating the partition and trying to install Ubuntu MATE 16.04 LTS Xenial Xerus in it, I got some error messages that I cant remember right now. The result was that I couldn`t boot my computer anymore and, when booting my machine, I was sent to a black screen with the words \"grub rescue\" on it.\n\n*Then, I decided to completely erase my entire hard disk and install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Precise Pangoling in it once again. I used a bootable USB stick with Precise in it and used the entire hard disk in the install.\n\n*The install was running smooth and by the numbers until I got this message in the end:\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed failed to install into /target/. Without GRUB boot loader, the installed system will not boot\n\n\n\n*I ran boot repair and got no solutions at all. Only a black screen with the words grub rescue on it.\n\n*I asked boot repair to create a report (http://paste.ubuntu.com/16184588/) about the boot conditions in my machine. I don`t know how to read that report. Sorry for that. :-)\n\n*My hard disk partitions are this way right now:\nPartition File-System Size Used Unused Flags\n/dev/sda1 fat-32 94.00-MiB 1.46-MiB 92.54-MiB boot\n/dev/sda2 ext4 927.48-MiB 17.75-GiB 909.73-GiB\n/dev/sda3 (key image) linux-swap 3.94-GiB\nStackOverflow doesn`t support tables. Sorry for the mess above.\nSome additional informations:\nI think something went wrong when trying to configure UEFI, Secure Boot, Fast Boot and all those stuffs of \"modern\" computer systems. The BIOS was so easy to use. The fact is that I did something wrong, since my computer is a useless pile of metal right now. I cant boot it and I cant install anything in it.\nBy the way, all I want right now is to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Precise Pangoling in my computer. I have a bootable USB stick with it and I don`t mind using the entire hard disk for that.\nBest regards.\n\nA: Here are my observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your EFI System Partition (ESP) is small -- 94 MiB. In theory, this should be OK, but in practice, it might not be, particularly with an older (early 2010s) computer -- some early EFIs have somewhat flaky FAT drivers that don't cope well with sub-512 MiB FAT filesystems. Thus, you could try increasing the size of your ESP. I recommend 550 MiB because that's enough above various limits to avoid problems that can occur if you try creating something that's exactly 512 MiB.\n\n*There's no evidence of a boot loader installed on the ESP. This could be a bug in Boot Repair, but given the errors you describe, it's probably the case that there really is no boot loader there. Unfortunately, there's no clue in what you've reported about why the boot loader could not be installed; all I can do is speculate about flaky FAT drivers.\n\n*A less radical solution is to install another EFI boot loader. Most of these are at least a little tricky to install manually, but you could install my own rEFInd without too much difficulty:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of rEFInd from the links on its downloads page.\n\n*Prepare a boot medium from the file you download.\n\n*Boot with the rEFInd medium. With luck, it will a boot option for Ubuntu, which I expect is installed except for GRUB.\n\n*Boot Ubuntu.\n\n*Install rEFInd using the Debian package or PPA.\n\n*Reboot. If it works, great. If not, perhaps the rEFInd installation will have at least produced a more helpful error message.\n\n\n", "Q: Xubuntu 16.04: fstab won't mount \"/root\" entry A week ago, I installed Xubuntu 16.04 and supposed to mount a partition(/dev/sda3) for root's home (/root).

But I have no clue why /dev/sda3 is not mounted to root in previous cases. Does Ubuntu disable this for security reasons?\n\nA: As a general rule, it's inadvisable (at best) to make /root a separate partition from the root (/) filesystem. The reason is that this is the root user's home directory, and it's critical that this location remain accessible even in the event of a severe problem, such as damage to the /etc/fstab file.\nI don't know if that's related to your problem, but it might be -- it's conceivable that there's something in the Ubuntu startup or shutdown procedure that's interacting badly with use of a separate /root partition. Certainly use of a separate /root partition is so rare that this case would get absolutely no testing by Ubuntu's developers.\nI recommend you reconsider this practice. Given Ubuntu's security model, /root probably contains few or no files, aside from boilerplate account files. If you're storing anything there (especially anything big enough to warrant creating a separate partition for those files), it could be another location would be more sensible.\n", "Q: How to login with root user?

I think it is a loop!\n\nA: When you install Ubuntu, the first user you create has sudo access. If that's how you are logged on, and you don't have sudo access, you must have messed up something. Boot from installation media, mount your root partition and edit /etc/sudoers to include your username (and/or edit your groups file to include your username to the sudo group).\nBy default, you cannot log in as root on an Ubuntu machine. There are lots of ways of changing this, but it's probably best if you don't until you can figure out how to do it on your own :)\n", "Q: Steam installation fails under Ubuntu 16.04 Since I did a \"clean\" install of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (\"Xenial Xerus\") on our three computers (all different models, from two different manufacturers), Steam simply will not install using the new (GNOME) Ubuntu Software.\nWhen I go to the Steam website, download and run the Debian (\".deb\") installer, (GNOME) Ubuntu Software displays the blue \"installing\" bar, then this disappears and I'm left with an icon on the Launcher that says \"Waiting to Install\" when you hover over it.\nThere are no dialog boxes hiding in the background, and clicking the \"Waiting to Install\" icon does nothing...\n\nA: This is a bug in the new software app. Try using the terminal to install your application with sudo dpkg -i new_app.deb.

But I may be wrong.\nUPDATE:\nI also recently noticed that the IP (external IP) is constantly changing (after very long periods of time), of course I always try to connect to the current IP. Could having a non-static IP have something to do?\n\nA: The problem with this was that the Internet Service provider wasn't allowing me to properly port forward.\nI changed provider and problem solved.\n\nA: It is also possible that your wireless ISP is blocking ssh traffic and/or traffic to the router. The -vvvv options can be involved on the client and debug data requested on the server. -d option is useful to troubleshoot the daemon. \nIf you check the manpage for sshd, it is there. \nSo, stop the normal sshd (service stop) and manually run it - sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -d then watch the debug output as you attempt connections from the other box. Might want to tee the output to a log file - that output is to stderr, not just stdout, so do any redirection desired.\n\nA: You should check that you have a Gateway defined in your network config file.\n", "Q: I can't resize/partition my disk using gparted I am trying to install ubuntu alongside windows 10 but when i run gparted i cannot shrink either of the existing partitions.

I want to downgrade my PC, unless there is any other solution to fix this graphic problem.\n\nA: \nAMD graphic which is not supported by ubuntu 16.04.\n\nI think you're talking about fglrx being deprecated in 16.04. Fglrx is a very old AMD driver, notable for bad performance, and being pretty buggy. It is deprecated on both sides: it won't work with newer xserver version because of ABI change, and AMD themselves considering the driver legacy.\n\nif there is any other solution to fix this graphic problem. please give the solution.\n\nYes, just use the default open source driver. For now this driver being actively developed by AMD, so you may count this as an official driver by AMD. AFAIK for newer cards there's also new AMDGPU driver, which is open-sourced too.

Most traffic should go through network A, however, I also need my computer to communicate with other computers in the network B (e.g., 10.84.1.8 -- yes, actually not in the same subnet of network B). I have set metric in the /etc/network/interfaces file so that I can set two gateways, but it seems that only the first gateway works, and computers in other subnet of network B (i.e., 10.84.1.8) cannot access my computer (10.73.9.30) at all. \nInterestingly, computers in the same subnet of network B (e.g., 10.73.9.3) can access my computer without any problem, and 10.84.1.8 can also access 10.73.9.3 (which is only connected to network B). Therefore, I think the cause of the network issues on my computer is that it is connected to two networks.

For everything else, he needs routes. The default route is used if there isn't a more specific route. Now you have told him to send all packets for that subnet over a different router, that probably knows where to send the packets.

What is meant by emulation in simple layman terms?\n\nA: This is not a Linux thing, it's a bash thing. Bash is just one of many shells. Bash is the \"Bourne again shell\" and was released as a replacement of the original Bourne Shell, sh. \nPOSIX is a set of standards defining how POSIX-compliant systems should work. The POSIX shell standard can be found here. Bash has many features not present in sh and is not actually a POSIX compliant shell.\nThis is why the --posix option is provided. As explained in man bash (emphasis mine):\n\nIf bash is invoked with the name sh, it  tries  to  mimic  the \n  startup    behavior  of  historical  versions  of sh as closely as\n  possible, while    conforming to the POSIX standard as well.  When\n  invoked as an  interactive  login  shell, or a non-interactive\n  shell with the --login option, it first attempts to read and\n  execute commands from /etc/profile and ~/.profile, in that \n  order. The --noprofile  option may be used to inhibit this\n  behavior.  When invoked as an interactive shell with the name\n  sh, bash  looks for the variable ENV, expands its value if it is \n  defined, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read \n  and execute. Since a shell invoked as sh does not attempt to read\n  and execute commands from any other startup files, the --rcfile\n  option has  no effect.   A  non-interactive  shell  invoked  with\n  the name sh does not    attempt to read any other startup files. \n  When  invoked  as  sh,  bash    enters posix mode after the startup\n  files are read.\nWhen  bash  is  started in posix mode, as with the --posix command\n  line    option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files.  In\n  this mode, interactive  shells  expand  the ENV variable and\n  commands are read and executed from the file whose name is  the\n  expanded  value. No other startup files are read.\n\nThis means that if you run sh, or bash --posix, to start an interactive shell, your ~/.bahsrc file is ignored and, instead, the file saved as $ENV (if any) is read. To illustrate, I have added echo \"read .bashrc\" to my ~/.bashrc:\n$ bash\nread .bashrc  ## message was printed, ~/.bashrc was read\n$ sh\nsh-4.3$       ## no message printed, ~/.bashrc was not read\n\nIf I now set $ENV:\n$ export ENV=\"~/.bashrc\"\n$ sh\nread .bashrc\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Ubuntu has chosen to make /bin/sh a synlink to /bin/dash. Dash is yet another shell and is actually a POSIX-compliant one. This means that in order to observe the behavior I described above, you need to use a different sh1. On Ubuntu, you need to create a file called sh that is a symlink to /bin/bash:\n$ ln -s /bin/bash ~/sh\n\nYou now have a file called sh in your home directory. Use that to demonstrate the differences I explained above:\n$ ls -l ~/sh\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 terdon terdon 9 May  2 14:03 /home/terdon/sh -> /bin/bash\n$ ~/sh\nread .bashrc\n\n\n1 Actually, the behavior will look as though it's the same, ~/.bashrc will be ignored, but that's just because dash is not bash and has no business reading the bash-specific ~/.bashrc anyway. However, dash also ignores $ENV so you need to use the link to /bin/bash to see that. \n", "Q: X.Org Nouveau display Ubuntu 16.04 Im running Ubuntu 16.04 on my Asus G55VW 15\" ROG Laptop. When i use the X.Org driver which is default my system runs fine, ive got a hdmi port and screen which has a naitive res of 2560x1080 which is widescreen. It is currently set to 1920x1080 so it looks a little weird. \nWhen i use any of the Nvidia legacy drivers i cant get it to use 2560x1080 so i switch to NVIDIA Binarydrivers either 304.131 or 361.42 and i can get the resolution and looks great but sporadically locks up the machine. Or when i boot it GUI doesnt start correctly\nIts not due to the screen being used because when im at work just on the 15\" built in using the NVIDIA binary it still occasionally locks up.\nAnyone else experience this? I used to use the latest NVIDIA on 14.04 and never had an issue so its weird its starting now.  \nI an provide logs etc but just from a user experience perspective i wanted to see if anyone else has had similar issues?\nThanks,\n\nA: I thought I'd share that this thread worked for me in case anyone stumbles across this question.\nGraphics issues after/while installing Ubuntu 16.04/16.10 with NVIDIA graphics\nThanks!\n", "Q: Creating own snap images I see some similarities between Snap and Docker.

With my set-up, I have the same problem, except for one difference: I have two different variants of it. Either an application (such as LibreOffice) is completely missing the menu bar, or an application (such as gnome-terminal) has its menu bar doubled. Both problems appear right after reboot, and disappear if I log out and back in. That is, completely without adjusting any settings or running any commands; plain logout-login cures the problem. Well, for the most apps -- some apps still present their menu bar doubled occasionally.\nI hope someone could tell me which part of the system I could point my bug report to, as for now,  I have no idea of which component might be causing this.\n\nA: As posted in other forum (cannot take credit), open a command window and enter the following command:\nrestart unity-panel-service\nThis worked for me - at least until a more permanent fix is made.\n", "Q: Notifications not showing up properly in Slack and other Electron apps I recently upgraded from Ubuntu 15.10 to 16.04.

Mouse is SteelSeries Rival 100, which has a DPI of 250 to 4000.\nI have absolutely no idea how to change it. Googling it doesn't bring up anything either.\nHow do I change it? Through the command-line is fine.\n\nA: KISS - Keeping It Simple Solution\nMy wireless Logitech MX Performance mouse has DPI of 400 to 1600. To set the speed in Ubuntu I go to System Settings -> Mouse & Touchpad which brings up this display:\n\nSliding the \"Mouse pointer speed\" changes the DPI rate for comfortable use. In Windows Logitech also recommends setting the DPI by sliding the Mouse Pointer Speed. Specifically it says:\n\n\n*Under Pointer speed, adjust the slider to your preferred DPI value. The minimum value is 400 DPI. The speed can be increased in increments of 200, up to a maximum of 1600 DPI.\n\n\nThe more complicated solution\nSome report that for gaming mice the slowest pointer speed setting (above) is still too \"insanely fast\".

How to reduce speed?\n\nA: I am unable to test the mouse itself as I do not own the hardware but it looks like there is a nice command line utility called rivalcfg available for Linux to manipulate many of the settings including DPI.\nTo install rivalcfg run the following:\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\nsudo pip install rivalcfg\n\nTest your installation of rivalcfg and make sure that your copy covers your mouse (which I have arrowed in!):\nandrew@ilium:~$ rivalcfg -l\nSteelSeries Rival                             1038:1384   \nSteelSeries Rival 100                         1038:1702   <-------\nSteelSeries Rival 300                         1038:1710   \nSteelSeries Rival 300 CS:GO Fade Edition      1038:1394   \nSteelSeries Rival 300 CS:GO Hyperbeast Edition 1038:171a   \nandrew@ilium:~$ \n\nThen you should have access to two preset DPI options from the command line:\n-s SENSITIVITY1, --sensitivity1=SENSITIVITY1\n                    Set sensitivity preset 1 (values: 250, 500, 1000,\n                    1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 4000, default: 1000)\n-S SENSITIVITY2, --sensitivity2=SENSITIVITY2\n                    Set sensitivity preset 2 (values: 250, 500, 1000,\n                    1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 4000, default: 2000)\n\nThe usage is simply:\nUsage: rivalcfg [options]\n\nand the complete command line options can be seen here...\n", "Q: Ubuntu loading screen stuck, how to recover from this situation? I have done nothing. Just normally uses my 15.10 Willy. But after the last shutdown at 1 pm I couldn't get pass the loading screen. There is very important things in my laptop. Anyway to recover this position? \nPlease help me\nI mean it\n\nA: It's very hard to tell anything without knowing the output. \nYou can try choosing older kernel (maybe kernel update caused this), by selecting \"Advanced options for Ubuntu\" in Grub menu at the beginning (if Grub menu doesn't appear, hold Shift while booting).\nMuch better will be access kernel boot options by pressing \"e\" and remove \"splash\" and the \"quiet\" entries from the boot parameters to make Ubuntu display the output during boot and read what the error is.\nTo get logs of this, you need to access your hard drive from LiveCD or LiveUSB and take logs from /var/log, e.g.: \n/var/log/boot.log\n/var/log/dmesg \n\nUsing LiveUSB, You can also rescue your data to another computer.\nThere is a lot of questions on Ubuntu boot, so knowing the output, you can google for your error.\n", "Q: How to connect via ssh and use gcc on target?

I was trying to experiment with docker, Ubuntu 14.04, 64-bit. I managed to run an image, and I gave it the path on one of my removable drives, /media/Drive1.\nNow, whenever I reboot, I see there is a /media/Drive1 with only a docker directory inside it, and the actual drive which should be Drive1 ends up mounted on /media/Drive11, and this happens every reboot - even when I unmount these drives, and do a sudo rm -rfv /media/Drive1 before rebooting!\nSo something probably creates /media/Drive1 before it is fully mounted, and I guess that something is docker, because when I boot, I have:\n$ ps axf | grep docker\n 2085 ?        Ssl    0:00 /usr/bin/docker -d\n\nSo, how can I disable the docker autostart, so it doesn't interfere with the mounting of external USB drives at boot? \n\nA: Ok, I think I managed to get it working, following How to enable or disable services?:\nsudo bash -c 'echo manual | sudo tee /etc/init/docker.override'\n\nHope that was it...\n\nA: On the systems since Ubuntu 16.04+ (where OS uses systemd), according to the doc, autostart on boot can be turned off by:\n$ sudo systemctl disable docker.service\n$ sudo systemctl disable docker.socket\n\nor as @Burak said in the comment, here is the one liner command:\nsudo systemctl disable docker.service docker.socket\n\nNote that if you do not disable the socket as well as the service then the service will get started anyways as the socket depends on it.\n\nA: This is for recent Ubuntu releases using systemctl.\nTo disable on boot, use systemctl disable as @Burak said:\nsudo systemctl disable docker.service docker.socket\n\nThis will have the side-effect of stopping Docker from working at all after a reboot, as @Taylor found. You will get an error like this:\n~$ sudo docker container ls\ndocker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?.\nSee 'docker run --help'.\n\nTo start the Docker service in a script or at the prompt without re-enabling it to start at boot, use systemctl start:\nsudo systemctl start docker.service\n\nYou can then use docker or docker-compose as normal, and it will still not automatically restart on boot.\n\nA: I think the best way is to apply mask to the service:\nsudo systemctl mask docker\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu SDK unable to play scope I've just created a Unity Scope project in Ubuntu SDK. \nHowever I'm not able to run it, If I target the Desktop, I have the following error : \nStarting /usr/ubuntu-sdk-ide/share/qtcreator/ubuntu/scripts/qtc_desktop_scoperunner.py...\nScopeRunner> Setting up environment\nScopeRunner> TmpDir:      /home/bertrand/.local/share/unity-scopes/unconfined/stars.kramp/\nScopeRunner> AppId:       stars.kramp_stars\nDebug-helper> Environment initialized, starting the application\nDebug-helper> Executing /usr/bin/unity-scope-tool /home/bertrand/dev/uapp/build-stars-Desktop-Default/src/stars.kramp_stars.ini\nThis application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin \"xcb\"\nin \"\".\n\nReinstalling the application may fix this problem.\nThe program has unexpectedly finished.\n\nMy desktop kit configuration is below : \n\nAnd I've also tried on with an emulator target, then I've another error : \nResults:\nFatal error: /tmp/stars.kramp_0.1_armhf.click failed to install.\nWARNING:root:Signature check failed, but installing anyway as requested\nCannot install /tmp/stars.kramp_0.1_armhf.click: Framework \"ubuntu-sdk-15.04.4\" not present on system (use --force-missing-framework option to override)\n\nSdk-Launcher> Installing the application failed\n\nMy armhf kit configuration is below : \n\nI'm new to QT/UbuntuPhone/Click/Kit/Framework/target/andSoOn development environment, so I'd like to understand what's wrong.\nI'm under ubuntu 15.10.\n\nA: I am able to run on the Desktop target now.

You either need to update your application to support MySQLi or pdo_mysql or install PHP 5.6 from PPA (ppa:ondrej/php). \nAs for the reinstallation problem, I would suggest removing MySQL packages first and then reinstalling them again:\nsudo apt-get remove mysql-common\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\n\nA: When I upgraded my website PHP from version 5.6 to 7.2, I encountered this problem “Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL extension which is required by WordPress”. It turns out that mysql extension is no longer supported in php version 7.2. It is now using mysqli extention. I am using old version of wordpress which still using mysql extension that is why the problem existed. So what I did is upgraded the wordpress to the core. This solve the problem.\nHere's the steps I followed when upgrading wordpress manually:\n\n\n*\n\n*First I created a full backup of my website http://fractioncalc.com. This is very important in case of mistake.\n\n*I download the newest WordPress ZIP file from wordpress.org.\n\n*I unzipped the file into a local directory of my computer.\n\n*I went to my website root directory and deleted your ‘wp-includes’ and ‘wp-admin’ directories. I used sFTP connection using Filezilla software.\n\n*I uploaded the new wp-includes and wp-admin directories from the new version of WordPress I unzipped to my website root directory and replaced the directories I just deleted.\n\n*I did not delete the wp-content directory or any of the files in that directory. I just copied over the files from the wp-content directory in the new version of WordPress to my existing wp-content directory. All existing files with the same name have been overwritten. \n\n*I copied all files from the root (‘/’) directory of the new version of WordPress that I unzipped into my website root directory (or the root directory of your WordPress installation). Existing files has been overwritten and new files has been copied across. wp-config.php file was not be affected because WordPress has never distributed with a wp-config.php file.\n\n*I compare wp-config-sample.php which was distributed with WordPress, but did not find anything to change, so I just used the old one.\n\n*I cleared my browser cache to ensure I can see all changes.\n\n*I checked the site and there is no error now.

If I run mysql_secure_installtion I see that old settings never got set permanently. \nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I recently upgrade my Ubuntu 15.04 to 16.04 and this has worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*First, connect in sudo mysql\n sudo mysql -u root\n\n\n\n*Check your accounts present in your db\n SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;\n +------------------+-----------+\n | User             | Host      |\n +------------------+-----------+\n | admin            | localhost |\n | debian-sys-maint | localhost |\n | magento_user     | localhost |\n | mysql.sys        | localhost |\n | root             | localhost |\n\n\n\n*Delete current root@localhost account\n mysql> DROP USER 'root'@'localhost';\n Query OK, 0 rows affected (0,00 sec)\n\n\n\n*Recreate your user\n mysql> CREATE USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '';\n Query OK, 0 rows affected (0,00 sec)\n\n\n\n*Give permissions to your user (don't forget to flush privileges)\n mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;\n Query OK, 0 rows affected (0,00 sec)\n\n mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n Query OK, 0 rows affected (0,01 sec)\n\n\n\n*Exit MySQL and try to reconnect without sudo from your local machine.\nEdit: a previous version of the answer post recommended creating a user 'root'@'%'. However, it is more secure to create 'root'@'localhost' so connections can only be made from localhost, and not remotely. Both solutions work equally as well for local development.\nI hope this will help someone :)\n\nA: In short, on MariaDB\nUPDATE mysql.user SET plugin = 'mysql_native_password', \n      Password = PASSWORD('NEWPASSWORD') WHERE User = 'root';\n\nwhere you replace NEWPASSWORD with the password you want, and everything else verbatim.\nThe issue here is that when MariaDB or MySQL are installed/updated (especially if at some point root is set without a password) then in the Users table the password is actually empty (or ignored), and logging in depends on the system user corresponding to a MySQL user. \nYou can test this as follows by switching to system root, and then type:\nmysql -uroot -p\n\nThen enter either no password or the wrong password. You'll probably be let in. (You may even be able to log in from the unix root by simply # mysql as the password is irrelevant and the user is defined).\nSo what's happening? Well, if you log in as root and do the following:\nselect User,host,plugin from mysql.user; \n+----------------+-----------+-----------------------+\n| User           | host      | plugin                |\n+----------------+-----------+-----------------------+\n| root           | localhost | auth_socket           |\n+----------------+-----------+-----------------------+\n\nyou'll note auth_socket (which may read unix_socket on MariaDB). These sockets ignore passwords and allow the corresponding Unix user in without a password check. This is why you can log in with root but not with a different user.\nSo the solution is to update the Users to not use the auth_socket/unix_socket and properly set a password.\nOn MariaDB (<10.2, see comments below) which is on the Ubuntu version 16 as of 2017 this should suffice. NEWPASSWORD is your password. mysql_native_password you type verbatim. \nUPDATE mysql.user SET plugin = 'mysql_native_password', Password = PASSWORD('NEWPASSWORD') WHERE User = 'root';\n\n(It's possible that setting the plugin to empty would work. YMMV. I didn't try this. So this is an alternative.)\nUPDATE mysql.user SET plugin = '', Password = PASSWORD('NEWPASSWORD') WHERE User = 'root';\n\nOtherwise:\nALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'NEWPASSWORD';\n\nThen \nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nFor the record, the solution involving deleting the user and recreating it with '%' got me totally locked out of the database, and can cause other problems unless you get the grant statement exactly right - easier to simply update the root you already have. \nIn my experience, the issue only happens with the root user, as other users will be added manually not part of an initial install/update.\n\nA: If you just run mysql command under root user you will be granted access without asked for password, because socket authentication enabled for root@localhost.\n.\nThe only way to set password is to switch to native authentication like:\n\n$ sudo mysql\nmysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH\nmysql_native_password BY 'test';\n\n\nA: Try to create new mysql account, for me it has worked (mysql 5.7.12):\n\n\n*\n\n*Login as sudo:\nsudo mysql -uroot\n\n\n*Create new user and grant him privileges (no password):\nCREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost';\n\n\n*Login as new user:\nmysql -uadmin\n\n\nA: Try this code first,\necho \"CREATE USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'root';\" > your_init_file.sql\necho \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;\" >> your_init_file.sql \necho \"FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\" >> your_init_file.sql\n\nand then,\nkillall mysqld\nmysqld_safe --init-file=$PWD/your_init_file.sql\n\nthen  press Ctrl+Z and type: bg to run the process from the foreground into the background, then verify your access by:\nmysql -u root -proot\nmysql> show grants;\n\n\nA: I’ve been adapting some provisioning scripts I have created to use MariaDB and ran into this exact issue. Piecing together lots of info here an Gazzer’s answer really zeros in in the issue; it all boils down to the auth_socket/unix_socket setting.\nSo when using MariaDB 5.5 (under Ubuntu 14.04) and MariaDB 10 under (Ubuntu 16.04), logging into MySQL and running this command cleared things up right away:\nUPDATE mysql.user SET plugin='' WHERE User='root';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nThe other answers—including the highest voted answer as of this post by Loremhipsum—really encourage bad practices by recommending dropping a user and then recreating them. To me, that is a pretty radical solution. The best/simplest solution os to nullify the plugin value, flush privileges and get on with life.\n\nA: I had to do two things (thanks to @Todor and @Loremhipsum):\nupdate mysql.user set plugin = 'mysql_native_password' where User='root';\ngrant all privileges on *.* to 'root'@'localhost';\n\nand then:\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nI would not recommend to drop user root.\n\nA: \nIf you install 5.7 and don’t provide a password to the root user, it\n  will use the auth_socket plugin. That plugin doesn’t care and\n  doesn’t need a password. It just checks if the user is connecting\n  using a UNIX socket and then compares the username.\n\nTaken from Change User Password in MySQL 5.7 With \"plugin: auth_socket\"\nSo in order to to change the plugin back to mysql_native_password:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login with sudo:\nsudo mysql -u root\n\n\n*Change the plugin and set a password with a single command:\nALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'test';\n\nOf course you can also use the command above to set an empty password.\nJust for the record, (and MariaDB < 10.2 users) there is also another way to only change the plugin without providing a password (leaving it empty):\nupdate mysql.user set plugin = 'mysql_native_password' where User='root';\n// to change the password too (credits goes to Pothi Kalimuthu)\n// UPDATE mysql.user SET plugin = 'mysql_native_password', Password = PASSWORD('secret') WHERE User = 'root';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n\nA: By default, root user is set to authenticate through an auth_socket rather than with a password.\nIn order to use the password authentication, do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to MySQL root shell:\nsudo mysql\n\n\n*Check authentication methods enabled for different users (optional)\nSELECT * FROM mysql.user;\n\n\n*Make root to authenticate with a password:\nALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_password_here';\n\n\n*Flush privileges for the changes to take effect;\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n\n*Exit and authenticate with your password\n exit\n mysql -u root -p \n\n\nA: Maximum security\nAs unix authentication is the most secure authentication, the best thing to do is leave the default root account as is (i.e. continue to use unix socket authentication with no password) and if not using the root account, use it via sudo. If an attacker has root/sudo access; then they already have full control of your server...\nWhen you need to access MySQL/MariaDB via an alternate method (i.e. not CLI), create a new MySQL/MariaDB user with a password and only the required permissions.\n\nA: I had the same issue and running the following fixed it:\nmysql_upgrade --force\n\n", "Q: Keyboard slow to start working on boot Ubuntu 14.04 I have a recently built PC with Z170 mobo and 6700k/980Ti and a Corsair Strafe (backlit) keyboard. I had some issues with the Ethernet interface not appearing anywhere, which I solved like other people with the same specs on Ubuntu 14.04.\nAfter I boot on Ubuntu, it takes 2-3 minutes for the keyboard to start responding. Also, if I try to adjust its brightness, it will stop responding again. I have no idea where to start looking, since I can't find similar problems online. I have a 750 Watt supply, so I don't think it has to do with high power needs.\nNote: The problem with the keyboard existed from the beginning..along with the ethernet thing\nUPDATE: I bought a Razer Deathadder and it also takes the same amount of time to start working on boot.\n\nA: If you can reproduce the issue with another keyboard there may be another device that is causing the issue. Some good troubleshooting steps if you haven't already tried them: \n\n\n*\n\n*Try a live boot CD/DVD to see if the issue still occurs when booting into another OS (or a generic Ubuntu install)\n\n*Unplug everything external except power, primary display, and the keyboard. This includes any USB dongles for wireless devices. Reboot and see if it still happens.\n\n*Also try unplugging any internal USB headers such as front facing ports or control panels.\n\n*Nuclear option is to start removing PCIe add-on cards.\n\n\nIf it is a software/driver issue it should start working after the first step.

I have gone with Kubuntu. I am having some problems with getting my dedicated graphics card to work.    \nI have recently installed KUbuntu 16.04 LTS on my Lenovo Z51-70. It has both integrated Intel HD5500 graphics and AMD Radeon R9 M375 graphics card. \nWhen I run the command \"sudo lshw -c video\", it is only showing the Intel graphics card. How can I install or switch to AMD graphics?\nOutput of sudo lshw -c video is:\n  *-display               \n       description: VGA compatible controller\n       product: Broadwell-U Integrated Graphics\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 2\n       bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n       version: 09\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: msi pm vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n       configuration: driver=i915 latency=0\n       resources: irq:49 memory:d0000000-d0ffffff memory:c0000000-cfffffff ioport:5000(size=64)\n\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Short answer: you can't, at least not right now.\nExplanation:  \nWhen Ubuntu runs into a switchable graphics situation, it will use the integrated graphics by default and keep doing so until a proprietary driver is installed for the discrete graphics.\nNow, you may be thinking, \"great, I can just install the proprietary drivers for my AMD card.\" Well, unfortunately, you can't. Up until 16.04, AMD provided a proprietary graphics driver for Linux known as fglrx. This worked nicely (for the cards that were supported, but that's a different issue) until AMD decided it would not be supporting its Linux driver anymore.\nUnsupported doesn't necessarily mean incompatible. There was the possibility of fglrx working on 16.04, but it's been shown that fglrx does not work with 16.04. Users on 16.04 are currently stuck with generic drivers for their AMD card, forcing them to use integrated graphics if they have that setup.\nI believe there is a new proprietary driver in the making, but it's very buggy and not worth attempting to install just yet. For now, if you need the performance from your discrete card, you will have to downgrade to 15.10 or 14.04 (if you want LTS).\n\nA: The latest kernel 4.17 has extended support for various AMD graphics card. So, I guess, now you can use AMD card instead of inbuild intel card.\n", "Q: how to fix update problem on ubuntu 16.04 While update I have got error like this \nW: Target Packages (main/binary-amd64/Packages) is configured \nmultiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list:3 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list:1\nW: Target Packages (main/binary-all/Packages) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list:3 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list:1\nW: Target Translations (main/i18n/Translation-en_US) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list:3 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list:1\nW: Target Translations (main/i18n/Translation-en) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list:3 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list:1\nW: Target DEP-11 (main/dep11/Components-amd64.yml) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list:3 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list:1\nW: Target DEP-11-icons (main/dep11/icons-64x64.tar) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list:3 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list:1\n\nN: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-i386/Packages' as repository 'http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb stable doesn't support architecture 'i386'\nW: Target Packages (main/binary-amd64/Packages) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list:3 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list:1\nW: Target Packages (main/binary-all/Packages) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list:3 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list:1\nW: Target Translations (main/i18n/Translation-en_US) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list:3 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list:1\nW: Target Translations (main/i18n/Translation-en) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list:3 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list:1\nW: Target DEP-11 (main/dep11/Components-amd64.yml) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list:3 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list:1\nW: Target DEP-11-icons (main/dep11/icons-64x64.tar) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list:3 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list:1\n\n\nA: I had the same kind of problem.

An USB upgrade is the only way I can do it. That's not my computer, his connection is very slow and it would take ages to download it.\nI had installed the Xubuntu 14.04 LTS via USB, now I'd like to upgrade it with the new 16.04 LTS. Some suggest to do a clean install, some say it's okay to upgrade from a LTS to another one.\nCould you help me? What file do I need if I can upgrade via USB?\nMany thanks\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04 using a live DVD. You need to burn the live DVD of the same flavor (e.g. Xubuntu) and run the installer. If it detects the previous LTS version, it will prompt you to upgrade.\nSee this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/475494/271\nHowever, keep in mind that the package installation phase in this mode is (in my experience) very slow. You might still consider performing an upgrade using the network, esplicitly asking for all possible releases:\nsudo update-manager -c\n\n\nA: 14.04 --> 16.4 is not a supported upgrade path.\nYou'll be able to upgrade once 16.04.1 comes out.\n\nA: According to the Release Notes for Xenial Xerus the LTS->LTS upgrade will get enabled with the so called 1st point release (16.04.1) due some time during summer.\nBut also according to the same release notes  \n\nThere are no offline upgrade options for Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server.

I've used git clone to make a local copy of a GitHub repository containing a video driver I'd like to use. The local copy contains all of the source for the program; but as a newbie to Ubuntu, I've no idea of what tools or steps are involved in compiling and installing the driver. \nI'd really appreciate if anyone could provide a step-by-step guide?\n\nA: I still think a newcomer to this shouldn't go to compile drivers themselves, so understand that this is a process where lots can go wrong and you do this at your own risk.\nTo begin with, you want to install the proper tools for that. To do so, open a terminal (ctrl+alt+t):\nsudo apt-get install build-essential autogen automake make xutils-dev autoconf libtool autoconf-2.64 automake xorg-server-devel xorg-server-utils xorg-util-macros \ngit clone https://github.com/mmind/xf86-video-armsoc.git\ncd xf86-video-armsoc/\n\nNow you should be set to compile your driver. First run the command sh autogen.sh - this will create the neccesary files and configure them. \nThen you run \n./configure --with-drmmode=pl111\n\nor\n./configure --with-drmmode=exynos\n\ndepending on which driver you want to build. \nIf the configuration process stops in an error, check the last lines which dependencies are missing and install them. Easiest way to find those is running \napt-cache search <name>\n\nIn most cases you will get a fairly long list and have to go through it to find the proper package names to install. This is done then with \nsudo apt-get install <packagename>\n\nRe-run the configure as often as you need until it ends with no errors. \nNow that you have configured your build you can use the command make to compile your driver followed by sudo make install to install it.\n", "Q: Why is /usr/local/ owned by root? I am wondering why directories such as /usr and /usr/local/ are owned and created by root. Usually I am logged in as a normal user and I want to store programs that I personally use in these dirs. For example the Android Studio are stored there. Whenever, I need to make an update or to make any kind of change, permission are not granted because I am not logged in as root.\nThe directory name \"usr\" already implies that (normal) user based programs are supposed to be there. \nDidn't I get the concept behind this directory?\n\nA: \nThe directory name \"usr\" already implies that (normal) user based programs are supposed to be there.\n\nNot since the Dark Ages of Unix history, if it ever was. What do the abbreviations \"etc\" and \"usr\" mean?\nNow, the /usr directory is for the administrator to handle. However, almost all content in /usr is handled by packages, and /usr/local is where the administrator can install local software, outside of the package management system.  Let's consult the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard:\n\n/usr/local : Local hierarchy\nPurpose\nThe /usr/local hierarchy is for use by the system administrator when\n  installing software locally. It needs to be safe from being\n  overwritten when the system software is updated. It may be used for\n  programs and data that are shareable amongst a group of hosts, but not\n  found in /usr.\nLocally installed software must be placed within /usr/local rather\n  than /usr unless it is being installed to replace or upgrade software\n  in /usr.\n\nFor both /usr and /usr/local in a modern Linux system, normal users shouldn't have write permissions. On a single-user system, sure, you could give write access to /usr/local, but you have sudo privileges anyway (how often do you have to write to these directories?).\n\nA: There is nothing that stops you from installing and running applications locally, without sudo privileges. Locally, meaning: in your own home directory. That is how it is supposed to be.\nYou shouldn't have the same permissions on directories you are sharing with possible other users on your system.\nAbout /usr\nThe explanation on what usr literally stands for varies from unix system resources, to user system resources. The latter however should not be interpreted as owned by users, but as serving users, opposite to serving the system. Here we read about /usr:\n\nSecondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications.\n\nThe bottom line is that all (modern) explanations mention that it is about \"shareabble, read- only data\", and: \"should not be written to\"\n\nA: The directory is for globally installed software by the admin. If you want to install software by yourself for yourself, do it in your home directory. Check the FHS for more information about standard locations. \n\nA: Try placing the files you like in a sub-directory;\nsuch as ~/program/runthis\nThen in /usr/bin do\nsudo ln -s /home/username/program/runthis runthis\nand then do\nchown -h username:username runthis\nThat should create a symlink with only your permissions in the /usr/bin directory that points to a file that resides in a subfolder of your home directory. In that way the execution of that file only has your user permissions and never has root permissions as the symlink and the executables are owned by you no root. This would be fine for running on a personal machine and restricting the access of the program.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on a second internal drive in an \"independent way\" (no boot option) I have a 120 Gb SSD drive (/dev/sda) where Win7 is installed and a second internal drive (/dev/sdb) that I use for data storage. Both of them have GPT partition tables.\nNow, I want to install Ubuntu on the secondary drive and so I partitioned it in this way: EFI (fat32), root (ext4), home (ext4) and Data (NTFS).\nI want the installation to be fully separate from Windows: at startup, Windows must load automatically without selecting it by grub menu, instead if I want to use Ubuntu I should simply select it in the bios boot override section.\nI made an attempt and I selected /dev/sdb as boot loader destination, but at the end of the installation I strangely found it in the EFI partion of /dev/sda drive instead!\nThat's not what I want of course. For example, if I decide to format the primary drive for some reason, then I must be able to continue to use Ubuntu on the other drive with no problems and vice versa!\n\nA: You will have to remove your harddrives to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the second harddrive\n\n*Install a bootloader to /dev/sda\n\n*Insert the second harddrive and remove the SSD\n\n*Install Ubuntu on the second harddrive.

Messing around with partitions can cause data loss if something goes wrong, or make your system unable to boot.\nYou'll need to boot off a LiveCD/USB, because you can't work on mounted partitions.

If this still fails, you may have to resort to using Launchpad.net to rebuild the Ubuntu Precise dependencies you need for your current lsb-release version.\nI have actually done this for a few packages that exist in Trusty that don't exist in Xenial for me but some of my other programs still needed.\nI created my own Launchpad.net corner with a special PPA for my own use.  I then use Ubuntu Primary Package archive to copy packages to my PPA repo and set the destination build release appropriately for the release I want.  Before I upgraded to Xenial, I was using Trusty and copied some packages from Wily and had them rebuilt for Trusty.  You still have to go through the build logs if anything fails and copy dependent packages to your PPA repo, but eventually everything builds and can be used from your PPA.  You may need to copy packages from other PPAs, and you can do so, but you need to use their \"copy-packages\" link instead of the one I just provided.\n", "Q: Remove Bitlocker encryption on Ubuntu 16.04 How to access bitlocker encrypted drive in Ubuntu 16.04?\nDislocker utility worked in 14.04 but a package which dislocker depends libpolarssl is missing in 16.04.

The username and password never reach the proxy machine.\nTroubleshooting:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've verified that this machine can access the proxy by doing a curl:\nhttp_proxy='http://user:password@proxybox:8443/' curl google.com\n\n*I've verified that my password does not contain any special characters.\n\n*I've verified that there are no other proxy settings on the machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*grep -ri proxy /etc/profile* returns nothing\n\n*grep -ri proxy /etc/apt/* returns nothing but the file above\n\n*env | grep -i proxy returns nothing\n\n\n\nHere's what the tcpdump from an attempt with curl looks like:\nCONNECT apt.dockerproject.org:443 HTTP/1.1\nHost: apt.dockerproject.org:443\nProxy-Authorization: Basic (redacted)\nUser-Agent: curl/7.22.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.22.0 OpenSSL/1.0.1 zlib/1.2.3.4 libidn/1.23 librtmp/2.3\nProxy-Connection: Keep-Alive\n\nAnd an attempt with apt-get:\nCONNECT apt.dockerproject.org:443 HTTP/1.1\nHost: apt.dockerproject.org:443\nUser-Agent: Debian APT-CURL/1.0 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.24)\nProxy-Connection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: max-age=0\n\nNote the lack of the Proxy-Authorization header.\nHow do I get apt to respect the user/password settings I've defined in the configuration file?\n\nA: From what I picked up this is an issue with the specific version of apt. I found this bug report https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/1087512. The original author mentions\n\nThe problem is that the https transport mangles the proxy string before passing it to curl and strips the proxy credentials.\n\nI'm not sure if you can upgrade apt to the fixed version in that report (I can't tell if it was backported to 12.04 and earlier), but if not there is a work around you can use in the last comment from rvolgers which is:\n\nBy the way there was a workaround that allowed proxy authentication to work with https in the old version, but unfortunately this will break once the fix ships (not surprising, since it shamelessly abuses the overly permissive URI parser in apt):\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://username:password@hostname:port\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"http://username:password@username:password@hostname:port\";\n(In other words, duplicating the username:password@ part for the https proxy only.)\nAgain, I recommend against using this, since your apt config will stop working once this fix is backported.\n\nI hope the work around will work for you (I am unable to test myself), and if so, remember to undo this on your next upgrade.\n", "Q: Avoiding mouse scrolling in Gedit when editing long documents I need a solution specifically for the Gedit Editor:\nWhen editing long documents I want to avoid having to scroll down with the mouse when hitting the end of the page.\nIs there a solution to avoid the mouse?

But now I get the error:\n\nbash: $FILE: ambiguous redirect\n\n\nI'm getting the password and other info from an external file:\nDB_HOST=000.000.000.000\nDB_DATABASE=dbdame\nDB_USER=db user\nDB_PASS=\"xgT{uic[Is?uJ+\"\n\nWithin my script it take the info from the external file:\nSource dbserver.conf\nMUSER=$DB_USER\nMPASS=$DB_PASS\nMHOST=$DB_HOST\nDBS=$DB_DATABASE\n\n\nA: Your password needs to have the special characters escaped. So if your original password is xgT{uic[Is?uJ+it will have to become xgT\\{uic\\[Is\\?uJ\\+ (A slash before the special characters).\nYou might also want to look at something already written to do this such as AutoMySQLBackup, but I'm not sure if you need daily, weekly or monthly backup rotations. However the same rule applies, if the password has special characters those special characters need to be escaped. \nHope that helps!\n\nA: Yes. It helped to escape special chars:\nMPASS=$(printf \"%q\\n\" \"$DB_PASS\")\n\nBut there was still a problem with mysqldump. I finally found out, that mysqldump only worked for me with passwords with special characters when I don't tell mysqldump the host (-h hostname). This seems to be a bug. Or isn't it?\nUnfortunately I also have sites where the mysql server is an other host. So this solution isn't perfect.\n\nA: You should write like this:\nssh \"$SUSER@$SHOST\" \"mysqldump -q -u \\\"$MUSER\\\" -h \\\"$MHOST\\\" -p\\\"$MPASS\\\" \\\"$db\\\" --no-create-db | gzip -9 > \\\"$FILE\\\"\" 2> \"$ERROR\"\n\nThat is, all variables used as command line arguments should be protected by enclosing within quotes. The double-quotes around variables ensure that the expression is treated as a single value, so the shell will not split it to words. Notice that \" embedded within \"...\" need to be escaped,\nand written as \\\". A simpler solution is to use single-quotes instead of the embedded double-quotes, like this:\nssh \"$SUSER@$SHOST\" \"mysqldump -q -u '$MUSER' -h '$MHOST' -p'$MPASS' '$db' --no-create-db | gzip -9 > '$FILE'\" 2> \"$ERROR\"\n\nLastly, I'm wondering if you really meant to have 2> \"$ERROR\" on the local host, and not on the remote host. I suspect you actually wanted that on the remote host, so that's another error in the original command line.\nIf that's the case, then here's the fix:\nssh \"$SUSER@$SHOST\" \"mysqldump -q -u '$MUSER' -h '$MHOST' -p'$MPASS' '$db' --no-create-db | gzip -9 > '$FILE' 2> '$ERROR'\"\n\n", "Q: HDD boot repair I just used boot-repair tool in Ubuntu and I applied MBR option …\nand when I reboot my laptop, it won't boot hard drive.

When it started installing, in the middle the screen went black and the monitors were showing no input. \nI unplugged the hdmi cable and plugged it back in and it showed my desktop for a little bit but went black again. Plugging into either gpu or motherboard makes no difference. The computer does not respond to any keyboard or mouse inputs but the they do seem to be on.

It's been like this for a few hours now.\nI noticed this happened after I manually locked the computer with Super + L but I'm not sure if this is the cause of it.

I cannot tell if yours will so you'll have to check that yourself. \nAnd to execute a python script you need python BEFORE the path to the script\nAlso:\n\n\n*\n\n*~ is a shortcut to the home directory of the current user\n\n*~asdf is a shortcut to the home directory for the asdf user\n\n*~/Documents is the path to the Documents folder in the home directory of the current user\n\n*~Documents is looking for the home directory of the Directory user which is invalid unless you have a user called Directory\n\n\nAs @muru pointed out, you probably meant ~/Documents. So your bash script would probably look something like this\n#!/bin/bash\n\npython ~/Documents/dota2/dotaapi2/match_scraper.py \n\npsql dota2apidb\nupdate games set online=1 where online is null;\n\npython ~/Documents/dota2/gosugamers/gosugamers/spiders/scrapy crawl dota\n\nAgain, I do not know if this will work since I have no clue if each line will work. For example, does python ~/Documents/dota2/gosugamers/gosugamers/spiders/scrapy crawl dota actually work when you run it on the command line?\nAnd I do not know psql but I suspect you need to pass it some command line paramater to get it to run that update... command?\n", "Q: Scaling 3rd party programs on small size high resolution display I have Dell 9350 (13 inch) and installed Ubuntu 16.04. I am able to use my resolution at 3200 x 1800 but I have small screen so I have to adjust scale for menu and title bars setting 1 to 2 in order to have normal window and icon size. Although, there is no problem with size of icon and windows after adjusting, when I download a 3rd party program, I have small screen and I cannot adjust it. What can I do to fix this ?  \n\nA: Personally I would down your screen resolution.  As a general rule, even for advanced photo and video editing, you're better off to set your screen resolution to a size at which you can conveniently use it, and zoom in.  You might think you'll lose some quality, but it's worth a try.  Frequently high DPI screens are also of a quality that makes them quite good even at more normal resolutions of 1600x1080.\n", "Q: Highlighting pdf using evince?

There is a variety of new stuff in Ubuntu 16.04, so that may make a difference. \nOk, so the issue is likely that guest addition drivers didn't compile correctly. \nFirst, uninstall Guest additions, and purge them from the machine.\nsudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run uninstall\n\nSecond, install dkms. They recommend installing that before the Guest Additions are run. \nsudo apt-get install dkms\n\nFinally, install Guest Additions again:\nsudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nNote: I've gotten into the habit of moving the VBoxLinuxAdditions.run to home directory, chmodding it to 755, and running it from there. I can't remember why; I think it might have been for a debian thing a while ago. I don't know if it makes any difference, but you might try it that way when you're doing the above steps:\n(when you're in the cdrom dir)\ncp ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run ~\ncd ~\nsudo chmod 744 ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nEdit:\nOh, another thing I did: After Guest Additions are installed, you can select its graphics adapter (not enabled by default). \nOpen Software & Updates, Additional Drivers tab, and under \"InnoTek Systemberatung GmbH: BirtualBox Graphics Adapter\", select \"Using x86 virtualixation solution -X11 guest utilities from virtualbox-guest-x11 (proprietary)\". Apply Changes, and reboot. \n\nA: I had the same problem and upgrading vbox to 5.1.2 and guest additions to 5.0.16 (and reinstalled them) solved it.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 16.04 network-manager failed to edit connection with crued log Always I want to edit a network-connection(WiFi, VPN, eth etc.) I get a log-message something like\nMay 2 21:39:19 mylaptop NetworkManager[925]: <info>  [1462217959.6967] audit: op=\"connection-update\" uuid=\"850afb13-cf82-402c-af7a-80408324329a\" name=\"myname1\" result=\"fail\" reason=\"connection.gateway-ping-timeout: can not set property: value \"32497520\" of type 'guint' is invalid or out of range for property 'gateway-ping-timeout' of type 'guint'\"\n\nwhich seems to be a false default value of a variable inside the network-manager?

Please tell me if it will fit.The file seemed to say that it was 1.5 GBbut the website claims it is 64-bit.\n\nA: The download file is indeed 1.5 gigabytes. \"64-bit\" refers to the type of computer processor it runs on, and is unrelated to the size of the download. Unless your CF card is decades old, I'm guessing it's 16 gigabytes, not 16 megabytes, and should have enough capacity to hold the Ubuntu installation.\nPlease let me know if this helps, or if you have further questions or clarifications needed.\n", "Q: Add an eSATA drive with bootable Ubuntu 16.04 to a Windows 7 UEFI dual boot PC I have a HP Envy 700-215xt, with UEFI, and WIndows 7 on it's original 1 TB drive. I've added a 2 TB internal drive, initialized as GPT, and installed Fedora 22 on it's first 500 GB. The UEFI boot order is set to boot to Grub2 on the second drive, which lists Fedora and Windows 7 in it's boot menu. This setup works fine so far.\nI have an \"Anker\" hard drive docking station (which has it's own power supply) connected by an eSATA cable and an adapter to the one remaining SATA connector on the IPM87-MP mobo, and with a 2 TB WD SATA drive installed in the docking station, with the intention of installing a bootable Ubuntu 16.04 on its first terabyte.\nMy first question is, should the new drive be initialized as GPT as well? It should work for that drive, but if I was to get  another drive later and want to use that in the same docking station, is there a possibility of a GUID conflict when UEFI's boot manager tries to boot the same entry for the docking station?\nSecondly, if there is a possible conflict in the above scenario, will initializing the drive as MBR prevent such a conflict and allow installation of Ubuntu normally, and for it to show up in the Fedora's boot menu by using Fedora's grub2-mkconfig, and still be able to later install another new drive in the docking station, without any UEFI/GUID conflict?\nThanks in advance,\nNaturelover\n\nA: I recommend using GPT. If the installation creates an entry in the EFI's NVRAM, that entry may or may not survive unplugging the eSATA disk. This is true whether the disk uses MBR or GPT -- that is, it's throwing the dice either way. If you don't intend to boot the eSATA disk on another computer, it might be better to proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu installer in its \"try before installing\" mode.\n\n*Launch a Terminal window.\n\n*Type ubiquity -b in the Terminal window. This launches the Ubuntu installer, but -b tells it to not install GRUB.\n\n*When you're done, reboot into Fedora and tell it to update its GRUB configuration. (IIRC, grub-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg is how you'd do this in Fedora.)\n\n\nThis procedure will cause Fedora's GRUB to retain control of the boot process, and to add an Ubuntu entry to it, rather than have two different GRUBs installed, and possibly battling for status as the GRUB that controls the boot process.\nAlternatively, instead of step #4, you could boot into Fedora and install my rEFInd boot manager, which would then take over the role of the program that manages the boot process. rEFInd tends to be a little easier to maintain if you're dual-booting two different Linux distributions.\nNote that GPT disks use several GUIDs -- one for the disk itself, one for each partition, and GUIDs used as type codes to identify partitions' intended uses. The first two of those should be unique for each disk and partition, so as to avoid the sorts of conflicts you seem to be concerned about. Unless you do a low-level copy or clone of a disk (and maybe not even then, depending on the software you use and the procedure you follow), two disks should not have shared GUIDs.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu run on an Asus F555LA Does anyone have any experience with an Asus F555LA-DM2095T laptop? I'm looking for a new laptop and I'm thinking of buying this one but I'm not sure if it'll run properly.\nI've read a review on a similar model (ASUS F555LA-AB31) that does seem to work. I think the only difference between the two is the hard-drive (HDD over an SSD) and the processor (i3 over an i5).\nI'm specifically asking if this hardware will run Ubuntu because I can not find any review on this model.\nI'd really like to know if anyone has ever tried to run Ubuntu on this laptop.\nThanks!\n\nA: Overall it should run fine. \nI have an Asus UX303LA with quite similar specs and the things I had to tweak to make them work were the hotkeys for the display brightness and the keyboard back light (see this link for a workaround for the keyboard backlight issue if you experience it: https://askubuntu.com/a/701145/474849).\nThe gestures on the touch pad might also need some tweaking... \nHope this helps!\n\nA: The main issues with Ubuntu tend to be with wireless cards and Nvidia or AMD graphics cards. Since the Asus F555LA-AB31 got good reviews, and the only differences in the models are HDD and processor (components which are generally very well-supported under Linux), I'd say go for it!\n", "Q: Different versions of Racket A friend helped me install Racket 6.1 on my Ubuntu a long time ago.

My guess is that your PATH includes the path of the old installation (the one in your home directory) first. Or perhaps it's just a question of doing a rehash. Here's what I'd suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a new terminal window (one way to make sure that paths are refreshed).\n\n*run racket --version, make sure that it's still 6.1.\n\n*run which racket to see which version of racket you're running. I'm guessing it'll be one installed in your home directory.\n\n*run echo $PATH to see what your PATH looks like. My guess is that the path to the one installed in your home directory will occur before the one installed using the ppa.\n\n\nIf everything I've supposed is true, then you can probably solve this by deleting the racket directory in your home directory (or, more conservatively, by moving it to /tmp so you can get it back if you want).\nAfter removing the racket from your home directory you need to tell your shell (bash), that the command has disappeared from previous location, because bash shell remembers location of commands already used.  You can remove this command hash table either by running: hash -r or just closing existing shell instances and opening new terminal window.\n", "Q: Looking for ppa kernel for ubuntu 16.04 http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\ndose not have any ppa kernels for 16.04.

I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 on a laptop. I have a small, 120GB SSD drive, and a secondary 1TB HDD. \nToday I made Linux use a swap partition that is located on that second drive. After testing things out (opening LOTS of chrome tabs) and checking if the swap partition is used (it is), I noticed, that the drive in question doesn't spindown after some amount of time like it used to.\nBattery life on my laptop is a huge deal to me, because I often have to work while traveling, with no way to recharge. Is there a way to force Linux out of using swap partition, and turn the second hdd off? Is there a way to do it automatically? \n\nA: To force Linux not use the swap, run sudo swapoff -a\nAs for turning off the disk, you can do that through the included \"Disks\" application. See screenshot. (The option is grayed out for me as it is my system drive)\n\n\nA: You could look into the tlp package (sudo apt install tlp will install it). Once installed, it sets up various power-saving optimizations for laptops automatically. It's quite \"set-it-and-forget-it\"; \nonce it's installed, you don't need to manually do anything to make it work. \nSpinning down hard drives when they are idle is a feature supported by tlp; however, it is not enabled by default. It \ncan be enabled by editing the DISK_SPINDOWN_TIMEOUT_ON_AC and DISK_SPINDOWN_TIMEOUT_ON_BAT values in the /etc/default/tlp configuration file (the values indicate the number of seconds before the drive spins-down to save power; by default they are 0, indicating no spin-down). \nMore information about manually configuring tlp: http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html \nMore general information about tlp: http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/tlp.html\n", "Q: Make certain programs in Xfce not go to the Notification Area When I run Xfce Task Manager, it shows a little icon in the Notification Area on my Panel.

I ended up not using ubuntu too much on this machine, as i do all my power user processes on my desktop running ubuntu, and windows is better suited for my case in this  being a tablet as well as a laptop. So I booted off a windows installer USB, went into repair my computer, and dropped into the command line. I executed the command bootrec.exe /fixmbr which it returned that the operation was completed successfully. So i exit the command line, click the turn off pc button, boot back up and grub is still there. I just type exit and it will boot strait to windows but its pretty annoying having it on here. Note during ubuntu installation everything was set to install on the sd card, and not on the internal storage occupied by windows. Note I do not have the sd card with ubuntu in the system anymore. Disk management reports the normal partitions on the drive(450mb recovery, 100mb EFI, and the 119gb primary partition). I guess I could restore from a backup if nothing else but I would much rather just remove it. Thanks!\n\nA: The simplest way of getting Windows back as the only OS on the system would be to run a Windows install disc for your version or Repair disk ... If it is windows 10 you would select repair then troubleshoot then startup repair and that will restore the Windows Boot loader. The steps are basically the same for Windows 8/8.1 and 7 but off hand I don't know the actual steps to get to the startup repair in those OS's .. it should be easy enough to find though\nIf worse comes to worse and you want a real easy way.. I can set you up so that Windows is the default boot and with no menu delay so basically it will boot right into Windows and you wouldn't see Grub at all but it would still be there\n\nA: In windows or using a \"windows recovery USB\" access cmd.exe (command prompt) as admin (in restore media it will already be admin)\nType diskpart then press Enter\nType list vol then press Enter\nType sel vol and enter the number where the EFI vol is (it will be a FAT32 fs around 100mb so for example sel vol 2) press Enter\nType assign letter=Z:(or a letter you know is unassigned Z will probably be fine) press Enter\nType exit and press Enter\nType cd /d Z: press Enter this will give you access to Z:>\nType dir press Enter you should see an EFI directory\nType cd EFI press Enter\nType dir press Enter you should see boot, Microsoft Ubuntu etc\nType rmdir /s ubuntu press Enter\naccept with y\nexit/reboot job done\nAnd it now should boot straight to windows without the bash grub also it doesn't matter about removing the Ubuntu from UEFI boot order because its not necessary on a surface pro tablet as the vol down and power on button prioritises the USB bootable source\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Ethernet Help So, I have recently installed Ubuntu 16.04 (Server).

I thought something fun to do would be install Nethack, surely its in an APT repository. I've looked into the SOURCES file to see the repositories I can reference.. what is the universe/multiverse business? Who is Wily Werewolf and am I looking at his repositories?

I have been using Plank since I started using linux late last year and never had this issue.\nA few things that I have done that might be responsible are installing and subsequently uninstalling Google Chrome (this coincided with several other weird errors, such as odd font rendering in Firefox) and unplugging my computer from my TV without safely disconnecting it.      \nI have already uninstalled and re-installed Plank, but it comes back exactly the same.

Should DNS entries be added to Bind for the containers, not just physical hosts?  Any idea on why Ceph might be failing?\nUpdate 2:  Ceph is failing because the placement groups exceed the PG max set by ceph.  The fix is increase the OSDs without increasing the placement groups.  I've added an answer that indicates the bug.  The suggestion at the time of this edit, is to create some tuning in the juju charm to 'calibrate' settings after things are deployed.\nUpdate 3:  Adding OSD's does decrease the placement groups count against the maximum PG limit warning value.\n\nA: With some help, I was able to find this bug, which was what was causing the health_warn in ceph.

I have done hardend build for compiling virtualbox and followed this link on my Ubuntu desktop  virtulbox build instructions\n\nA: Run \"debuild -us -uc\" in the main folder.  You may also need to install some additional packages to get debuild to work, but it should tell you what it's missing.\n\nA: You probably should learn about packaging. Almost never would a wise person \"build from source\" and then try to wrestle that  into a package. Instead, one would fiddle around with files in the source directory (the debian directory) and build a package with dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot.  If none of that makes sense, you seriously need to learn about packaging.\nOne good avenue is to run \"apt-get source your-package-name-here\" and it will pull down the source and packaging so you can see how real packages are actually made.\nNow, suppose you ignore that whole speech. I'm trying to save you from yourself. There is a way to fake a package build by monitoring the effect of \"make install\" that grabs the files and makes them into a pseudo package.  This  is called \"checkinstall\", but if you do it, you will be ridiculed by the  much more knowledgeable  people who properly build packages. I'm not teasing. If you admit to any reasonable Debian or Ubuntu  user that you use check install, you can become a laughingstock. \nhttps://wiki.debian.org/CheckInstall\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall\nWhen your friends brand you with a name like \"lazy Linux user who refused to learn the proper way to do anything\", you won't be able to say I did  not warn you.\nBut I did this  once when the packaging for one Debian project was put together in such a ridiculous way that rebuilding their packages--even if it did work--resulted in an awful spew.\n", "Q: Epson L800 lsb error Ubuntu 16.04 This particular printer doesn't work with esc-pr and has a driver and a useful interface utility that shows ink level and nozzle cleaning options.

This should work, because an official L800 driver from Epson is included in the OpenPrinting drivers (see http://www.openprinting.org/printer/Epson/Epson-L800 ). \n(One commenter suggested selecting a connection type of \"DNS/SD\" and then \"ESC/P-R\" in the setup tool -- I don't know if this makes sense, and I'm not on an Ubuntu box to try it right now)\nHowever, if that doesn't work, I have hard that you can manually download the \"lsb-\" packages from Wily manually from the following site: http://packages.ubuntu.com/wily/lsb and install them in Xenial, just to satisfy the official Epson driver installer package.

Though it does freeze up sometimes for a second or two right after I log-in. (Then again, Pantheon wasn't designed and isn't technically compatible for Ubuntu).

I try setting it down to 10 and even 0 with:\nsudo sysctl vm.swappiness=0\nbut as soon as I turn the system back on, swappiness is right back at 60 and my system is defaulting to using swap for everything until I die of old age at the iowait hangup (like I said, I know swappiness isn't the chief culprit, but I can't operate with it in the room). So, how do I solve it? I've heard that I can supposedly add in \"vm.swappiness = 0\" to sysctl.conf, but I'm really not sure how to add it in in order to make it both stay and not have the computer blow up. (like, is there a specific place in there I need? Do I tack it onto the end? Do I preface it with a #?)\nSo, basically, I don't need the classic and easy to find answer of \"how to lower swappiness,\" I need the annoyingly necessary answer of \"how to keep it lowered.\"\nRunning Ubuntu 15.10, in case that helps.\n\nA: This is a duplicate of How do I configure swappiness? . \nShort answer: add the line \nvm.swappiness = 0 \n\nto the file /etc/sysctl.conf and the change will persist after rebooting. \nSince it's a system file, you will need to open your editor with superuser privileges.\ngksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nshould work if you're running regular Ubuntu, or you could use \nsudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nto edit the file in a terminal on any Ubuntu variant. (If you use nano, CTRL+O saves the file and CTRL+X exits the editor when you're done.)\nAdd it exactly as written, to the end of the file, on its own line (press ENTER a couple times to create a new line, if necessary), save the file, and exit. Do not add a #.

I was trying to boot Ubuntu 16.04 amd64 ISO from Grub.

I rebooted again, there's no lenovo sign, nothing. It's totally black screen. I can not enter UEFI firmware.\nI had set my laptop to boot in UEFI mode only.

In some cases, unplugging all the disk devices can work past this sort of problem. With all disks unplugged, the computer should launch its setup utility, which you can generally use to reset the firmware settings to the defaults. (The details of how to do this vary from one computer to another.) The problem with this is that it usually wipes out the NVRAM entries that enable you to boot any OS, so you may need to use recovery tools to do so. Some EFIs enable you to launch EFI programs you select using a file selection tool. In other cases, you may need to use a recovery disk. An Ubuntu install disk can work for this; it will enable you to boot to a working system, where you can use efibootmgr to re-create a working entry. Another option is to use my rEFInd boot manager on a USB flash drive or CD-R to boot your regular system, and then use efibootmgr to re-create your regular boot entry.\nThere's a small chance that your computer is completely \"bricked.\" Such things have been known to happen, but mostly with EFIs from 3-5 years ago, which were often quite buggy. (Some Samsungs achieved notoriety for a bug that could cause them to brick themselves.)\n", "Q: Is battery life affected with dual boot? I have dual booted my laptop with Windows 10 and Linux.

I am asking this question because I have found articles basically saying that some computers have enabled Optimus technique with some propriatory graphics drivers, for example this one from Ubuntu Wiki page and this one from pilot6, while a lot of people are still seeking methods to install Bumblebee over internet. So, I got confused. Meanwhile, although my laptop, Lenovo Thinkpad P50, is listed on the document linked above as a supported system, but I haven't make the propriatory nvidia-361 driver successfully installed (see this question) which is told by the document to be working on my system. I have a little suspect about the authority of the document. \nCould anyone offer some reliable sources, evidence and real experiences (or techniques to confirm if no success instance found yet) to confirm Ubuntu 16.04 indeed natively supports hybrid graphics -- one integrated card and one discrete card -- no worse than Bumblebee? I haven't built enough confidence by simple searching. Thanks!\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04 of course supports hybrid graphics solutions, especially notebooks that have intel graphics and NVIDIA graphics with Optimus support. Do NOT install bumblebee, it is not under development anymore, the latest version is from April 2013. The solution to switch between the two graphics today is nvidia-prime, which is available in the official Ubuntu repositories. Most important to get everything working properly is the way the drivers are getting installed. Here you find the instructions  to install the drivers with a high chance that everything works properly :  \nInstall NVIDIA drivers\n\nA: Currently, you have (at the best of my knowledge) three possibilities regarding Nvidia hybrid graphics (the so-called Optimus technology) under Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bumblebee. While this project might seem dead, it’s not (discloser: I’m part of the dev team). It has been slowly developing for a very long time, because we were all quite busy, but things have gone better recently, and we received help from new contributors. The 4.0 version is on track, it’s mostly bug fixes and the primus backend becoming the default (most people won’t notice since they were already using it). Bumblebee allows you to run your desktop and display on the integrated Intel chip, while running selected applications on the discrete Nvidia card. It can use either nouveau or nvidia driver (given that they support your card, which they should both do), and relies on bbswitch for power management (with the option of using vga_switcheroo if using nouveau). On the performance side, because of how it works, Bumblebee is PCIe bottlenecked, which means you can not achieve very high framerates (which is not really usefull anyway) but also that you can never reach the full power of your dedicated Nvidia card. In case some of the display outputs on your laptop are wired to the Nvidia chip (often the case of HDMI on Lenovo laptop), Bumblebee allows you to use them, but it requires a bit of configuration, is probably far less than ideal and above all not tested since no any of Bumblebee devs own an affected laptop. Otherwise, Bumblebee works with either DRI2 or DRI3.\n\n*PRIME. This is the proper solution for this technology, and is implemented at the right level: drivers, kernel, Xorg… PRIME allows you the same setup as Bumblebee, however, due to legal concerns, only nouveau is supported. Outside of that, it has also some issues with tearing because of changes needed in the i915 driver. Also, nouveau still has a lot of issues regarding performances, so until it gets proper reclocking, you might have less perfs than in the Bumblebee + nvidia setup (Bumblebee + nouveau suffers from the same issue obviously). PRIME does not rely on bbswitch for power management, but rather use nouveau/kernel integrated one. PRIME also allows you to use outputs wired to the Nvidia chip quite transparently AFAIK. When running on DRI2, it requires a bit of configuration (depending on whether you also have Bumblebee/bbswitch installed, the exact amount may vary), but nothing outstanding. VDPAU is supported too in this mode (but only with nouveau driver again). When running on DRI3, it’s very seemless to use (so much that Bumblebee will probably gain support for this mode in the next release). However, you don’t get VDPAU support, and apparently no Nvidia outputs support either.\n\n*Reverse PRIME. Here, the idea is to use the Nvidia card for everything including the desktop, and only use the Intel chip as an output sink for the laptop display. This is supported by both nouveau (with the same performances issues as above) and nvidia (with the dedicated nvidia-prime tool under Ubuntu for instance). This means you don’t get powersaving at all (and get increased power consumption at all stages), but as with PRIME you can easily and fully utilize any display output. In this mode, you get the best of your dedicated card when using the nvidia driver. This is also the only configuration where you can get VDPAU working on the Nvidia chip using the nvidia driver. However, it has also some issues with tearing because of changes needed in the i915 driver. This mode only works with DRI2. In fact, this is for the same reason as why you can’t use outputs in PRIME+DRI3: Reverse PRIME is in fact the name of the support for using another card outputs (whether it’s Intel ones while running on Nvidia here or Nvidia ones when running on Intel above), and that currently does not work under DRI3.\n\n\nNote that things like CUDA or OpenCL do not require any of these tools, just a bit of configuration, but Bumblebee as a mode to use them easily while still getting its other advantages.\nPRIME and Bumblebee can cohabit when using DRI3, but under DRI2 or switching to Reverse PRIME requires a switch of configuration files and restarting the X server. So, depending on your needs, this is what I would advice:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don’t care about performances, but care about ease of utilisation (for external outputs mainly — if affected) and FLOSS, go for PRIME.\n\n*If you care a bit more on performances but often use your laptop in battery mode and don’t want to restart your X server all the time, go for Bumblebee.\n\n*If you care about performances and mostly use your laptop while plugged on AC (and don’t care about some extra W saving), take a look at Reverse PRIME using nvidia (you can use nvidia-prime to switch to Intel only mode when running occasionally on battery, but I’m not sure if the Nvidia card is turned off in this setup).\n\n\nA: A reason to install bumblebee instead of nvidia-prime is that with bumblebee you can switch easier between both GPUs. With nvidia-prime you can only select a single GPU for an X session. That means that if you want to switch GPU, the X session has to be restarted. With bumblebee, it is not necessary to restart the X server.\nThis blog contains installation instructions for bumblebee on 16.04. The comments section also discusses the reason to install bumblebee instead of nvidia-prime in more detail.\n\nA: PRIME works perfectly well with NVidia proprietary drivers now(mine is 367), so my guess is, even though @Archange's answer is very extensive and detailed, PRIME has no performance implications any longer, and is probably the best option in terms of performance now.\n@Archange, or did you mean that with nouveau it can really happen automatically, Windows-style?\n", "Q: How can I create recurring events in Calendar? Does the default calendar app in Ubuntu 16.04 provide an option to create recurring events?\n\n\nA: I believe that this is not possible with the default Calendar application but there is an application called 'California' which borrows the look of the default application and extends its functionality.

And the same way for any data you want it to survive over something big like OS reinstallation. One more thing is to backup /etc directory so you can refer to your old configuration later.  \nFor additional information about backup: How to backup settings and list of installed packages\nIt's really worth to invest time, reading and work on the backup. You will be thankful to yourself in many cases of big and small problems.\nMany people will jump right on trying new versions (i.e. Ubuntu 16.04) even though they may not be very experienced in the old version. These cases will result in tough learning experiences (I did). The good advice is to try the new thing on something unimportant first. For example, install it on a virtualbox machine or another computer; explore and see how it is before applying the changes to the important computer.  \nRegarding the upgrade\nWith the general advice above in mind, and that you've done something to follow it (at least make a list of installed software), you can choose the upgrade option. However, I would recommend doing the upgrade from the command-line terminal without the need of a CD/DVD/USB. It is not that hard and actually more convenient. Just read though the process first.

Just for reference I'll show the output for the mic off and wifi off media keys from xev:\nKeyRelease event, serial 33, synthetic NO, window 0x1a00001,\n    root 0xf6, subw 0x0, time 3107820, (-19,759), root:(625,798),\n    state 0x0, keycode 198 (keysym 0x1008ffb2, XF86AudioMicMute), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyPress event, serial 34, synthetic NO, window 0x1a00001,\n    root 0xf6, subw 0x0, time 3112189, (-19,759), root:(625,798),\n    state 0x0, keycode 246 (keysym 0x1008ff95, XF86WLAN), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nAnd I used to get similar results for the volume keys before installing ubuntu as well (I was using Arch).\nThe brightness keys don't work either, are these being overridden at some low level? Is there a way I can fix it so they return the correct value or is there some other way I can get the media keys working for ubuntu?\nUpdate: This is what xev gives for the volume up and down keys while I'm running unity.\nFocusOut event, serial 47, synthetic NO, window 0x4800001,\n    mode NotifyGrab, detail NotifyAncestor\n\nFocusIn event, serial 47, synthetic NO, window 0x4800001,\n    mode NotifyUngrab, detail NotifyAncestor\n\nKeymapNotify event, serial 47, synthetic NO, window 0x0,\n    keys:  2   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   4   \n           0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   \n\nKeyRelease event, serial 47, synthetic NO, window 0x4800001,\n    root 0xf7, subw 0x0, time 2182026, (-1217,972), root:(525,2104),\n    state 0x0, keycode 122 (keysym 0x1008ff11, XF86AudioLowerVolume), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nFocusOut event, serial 47, synthetic NO, window 0x4800001,\n    mode NotifyGrab, detail NotifyAncestor\n\nFocusIn event, serial 47, synthetic NO, window 0x4800001,\n    mode NotifyUngrab, detail NotifyAncestor\n\nKeymapNotify event, serial 47, synthetic NO, window 0x0,\n    keys:  2   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   8   \n           0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   \n\nKeyRelease event, serial 47, synthetic NO, window 0x4800001,\n    root 0xf7, subw 0x0, time 2185429, (-1217,972), root:(525,2104),\n    state 0x0, keycode 123 (keysym 0x1008ff13, XF86AudioRaiseVolume), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nWhen running unity, I also have unity-settings-daemon, unity-panel-service and unity-fallback-mount-helper. Could one of these be catching the event and adding the XF86 keysyms? None of these are running in i3.\nIn response to @Adaephon I have this in my i3 config:\n# volume controls\nbindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec amixer -q  set Master playback 2%+ unmute\nbindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec amixer -q  set Master playback 2%- unmute\nbindsym XF86AudioMute exec amixer -q set Master mute\n\n\nA: It looks like the keys in question are already grabbed globally by some other application. The three segments of output you get from xev are only related to the xev window loosing and reaquireing the focus, while the key is grabbed otherwise (See my post on the old i3 FAQ).\nThere are two likely causes, why xev might show an output like that and the keybinding does not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*First I would check, whether the keys in question - XF86AudioLowerVolume (keycode 122), XF86AudioRaiseVolume (keycode 123) and XF86AudioMute (keycode 121) - are already bound with bindsym (or bindcode) in your i3 configuration. Maybe it is only the bound command, which does not work.\n(Update) From the snippet of your i3 config this seems to be the case. I think 16.04 uses PulseAudio by default, so amixer might not even be installed. You can use pactl to change the volume on PulseAudio. To emulate your previous amixer settings try this:\nbindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ +2%; exec pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ 0\nbindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -2%; exec pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ 0\nbindsym XF86AudioMute exec pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ toggle\n\nYou can also use 1 instead of toggle on set-sink-mute, if you want to unmute only with the XF86AudioLowerVolume and XF86AudioRaiseVolume keys.\n\n*If that is not the case, some other tool is grabbing those keys. One likely candidate is gnome-settings-daemon, unity-settings-daemon might be another. Also, some media players may try to bind these keys globally. I suggest checking the output of ps aux on a fresh i3 session to see what is automatically started. When you found the culprit you have essentially three options: \n\n\n*\n\n*In most cases it should be possible to un-configure the key bindings. Probably the easiest solution, if you want to keep using whatever is grabbing the keys.\n\n*Make it work correctly. It may be that the program grabbing the key actually should do, what you want to do anyway (e.g. volume control), but for some reason it can not. For example: the program tries to change the volume with PulseAudio, while you are not actually using PulseAudio.\n\n*Stop it from starting. If you put it into autostart yourself (e.g. exec statement in your i3 configuration), you can just remove it. If it is automatically started due to some Ubuntu preset, it may require more work. \n\n\n\n\nFor gnome-settings-daemon you can use the instructions from my (other) post on the old i3 FAQ:\nYou should be able to get a list of bound keys with the following commands:\ngsettings list-recursively org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys\n\nYou can then unset them by assinging an empy string\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys volume-mute ''\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys volume-down ''\ngesttings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys volume-up ''\n\nAlternatively, you can also use dconf:\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/volume-mute \"''\"\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/volume-down \"''\"\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/volume-up \"''\"\n\n", "Q: Cannot switch to Gnome on 16.04 I just installed Ubuntu 16.04.

I have looked at some wine programs and I found one but its old and it might not work with the new void expansion.\nIs there another emulator to run this game - and if so where do  get it?\nI asked here, and it wasn't much help.\n\nA: Generally, big Windows software, which requires various libraries and dependencies, are very tricky to run on Linux (with Wine or the like). I don't think it is possible to run starcraft2 decently without installing it on a virtual machine based on Virtualbox or VMware. The seamless mode makes the virtualbox very transparent. \nDisclaimer: I haven't installed starcraft2 on a virtual machine myself.

When I start typing a file name that contains an equal sign, autocompletion with [tab] shows a strange behaviour:\nls ./foo[tab]    # autocompletion to \"./foo\\=bar\"         <- ok\nls ./foo=[tab]   # autocompletion to \"./foo=foo\\=bar/\"    <- not ok\n\nIs there something I can put into .bashrc to control this behavior or change some autocomplete scripts in /etc?\nbash --version\nGNU bash, version 4.2.25(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)\n\n\nA: Probably not. Or, at least, it will be really complex. The problem here is that foo= is interpreted by bash as an attempt to set the variable foo to something. So, when you hit tab it tries to complete with the names of the files in the current directory. It isn't actually completing foo=, it is starting a whole new glob from nothing. Note that it takes two tabs to complete foo=. \nTo illustrate, you can see the same behavior even if there are no files starting with foo=:\n$ ls\nbar  baz\n\nTyping foo= and pressing Tab results in:\n$ foo= ## first tab does nothing\n$ foo= \nbar          baz  ## both file names are printed. \n\nI doubt there's going to be any way around this since this is a basic function of the shell and the primary way to define variables. \nI can think of two workarounds. Either escape the =:\n$ ls foo\\=  ## hit tab\n$ ls foo\\=bar \n\nOr use quotes:\n$ ls 'foo=     ## hit tab\n$ ls 'foo=bar' ## yes, the final quote is added by the shell. \n\nHitting Tab now will expand the file name correctly. \n", "Q: Grive2 automatically sync (on logout) So I found that grive2 can be used to synchronize my google drive files. \nI also found a nice way to automatically sync google drive when I login to  Ubuntu (16.04) desktop: Startup Application settings to sync grive\nbut how can I also do the automatic sync when I logout?\n\nA: For scheduling regular tasks crontab is a general solution.

I couldn't find evidence of this on Google.\n\nA: Right now you can use both apt & apt-get, while apt has received a lot of developer love in the past weeks/month.\nTherefore, apt now comes with a progress bar, coloring, etc.\nIt does not fully replace apt-get so far, but will most likely in the future.

For example, if I depend on libvtk6-dev being at least version 6.0.0 I can write in the Depends line:\n libvtk6-dev (>= 6.0.0)\n\nBut is it possible to specify a range? For example, if I depend on the version 6.0 or 6.1 of a package, but not 6.2 or 5.9, how would I specify that?\nA more complex example would be if dependencies of a package changes depending on the version. For example, libvtk6-dev has missing dependencies, but this changes depending on the version of the package installed. How can I say something like: if libvtk6-dev is version 6.0 or 6.1 then also depends on libpython2.7-dev, and if the version is greater or equal to 6.2 then depend on libproj-dev?\n\nA: *\n\n*So let's break it down:\nlibvtk6-dev (>= 6.0.0), libvtk6-dev (<< 6.2.0), libpython2.7-dev\n\nOR (logic op)\nlibvtk6-dev (>= 6.2.0), libproj-dev\n\n, in Depends: is like AND (logic op). | is OR (logic op) but they don't have same priority neither brackets to be combined directly in that order/form.\n\n*Here what I could come with:\nlibvtk6-dev (>= 6.0.0), libvtk6-dev (>= 6.2.0) | libpython2.7-dev, libvtk6-dev (<< 6.2.0) | libproj-dev\n\nHow to read it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Must libvtk6-dev (>= 6.0.0)\n\n*If NOT libvtk6-dev (>= 6.2.0) then libpython2.7-dev\n\n*If NOT libvtk6-dev (<< 6.2.0) then libproj-dev\nFunny thing, this way is similar to NOR (or NAND) logic in electronics. If you have one of these then you can create all logic operations from it.\n\nA: You can do that with << example:\n libvtk6-dev (>= 6.0.0),  libvtk6-dev (<< 6.2.0)\n\nThis way you have locked the range between 6.0.0 and 6.1.0.

I then tried to start the computer this morning, I get to the account login page, I try to login...it flashes and then goes back to the login page.

I have really important information on this laptop and I haven't backed up in a couple months.\n\nA: For completeness' sake, I post the solution we found during our conversation in the comments section as an answer:\nFirst of all, you are probably able to boot into your Linux system, you may just not be able to log in graphically, since graphical login usually tries to read/write in your home directory. You can still try to log in using a virtual console (Ctrl + Alt + F1) and work from there.\nUsing a Live CD instead should also work. You can mount your encrypted system partition from the Live CD, too. For example, you can run gnome-disk-utility on your Live CD and decrypt+mount your system partition from there graphically.\nAlso, watch out that the instructions in the linked tutorial assume that you are logged in as the user whose home you want to rescue.

Running sudo mysql -u root (n.b. w/o a password) will give you mysql console whereas running the command as non-root prompts you for a password.\nIt would seem that changing the password doesn't make much of a difference since the auth backend doesn't even check for a password.

I have 3 partitions: EFI (/boot/efi), boot (/boot) and root (/). I want to encrypt just /. I can do this manually via the installer, but I want to preseed it.\nHow do I define it? My (non-encrypted) recipe looks something like the below. It is something of a mishmash of suggestions for EFI System Partitions I have found (found no clear guide).\nboot-root ::\n  100 100 100 fat32\n    $primary\n    $iflabel{ gpt }\n    $reusemethod( }\n    use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ vfat }\n    method{ efi } format{ }\n    mountpoint{ /boot/efi }\n  .\n  300 300 300 ext4\n    use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext4 }\n    method{ format } format{ }\n    mountpoint{ /boot }\n  .\n  100% 3000 100% ext4\n    use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext4 }\n    method{ format } format{ }\n    mountpoint{ / }\n  .\n\nHow do I make sda3 be a physical partition for LUKS-encryption and then have a filesystem on top of that?\nUPDATE:\nI discovered that I can set the partition to be crypto as below, but there are still 3 issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*I still need to create and activate the encrypted volumes on the chosen partition\n\n*I still need to set the correct ext4 filesystem on the encrypted volume after created and activated\n\n*The recipe doesn't select the encryption type to dm-crypt which is required for creating and activating the encrypted volumes.\n\n\nStill struggling mightily\nboot-root ::\n  100 100 100 fat32\n    $primary\n    $iflabel{ gpt }\n    $reusemethod( }\n    use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ vfat }\n    method{ efi } format{ }\n    mountpoint{ /boot/efi }\n  .\n  300 300 300 ext4\n    use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext4 }\n    method{ format } format{ }\n    mountpoint{ /boot }\n  .\n  100% 3000 100% ext4\n    method{ crypto } format{ }\n  .\n\n\nA: At first, open a root terminal: \nsudo -i\n\nThen fill the partition, which should be encrypted, with random data using a command like this:\nopenssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pass pass:\"$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=128 count=1 2>/dev/null | base64)\" -nosalt < /dev/zero > /dev/sdxy\n\nYou have to replace sdxy with the partition which will be encrypted. Then type \ncryptsetup luksFormat --cipher twofish-xts-plain64 --key-size 512 --hash sha512 --iter-time 2000 /dev/sdxy\n\nto encrypt the partition sdxy. Open the volume and name it root:\ncryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdxy root\n\nUse this command to make an ext4 filesystem inside it:\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/root\n\nNext you can start the installer. Chose \"Something else\" when being asked what you would like to do. Then chose the mount points for all your not-encrypted partitions. For your root partition, select /dev/mapper/root, click \"Change\". Then select ext4 for the filesystem type and set the mount point to /. Then click \"Install now\" and install Ubuntu normally.\nWhen finished installing click \"Continue testing\". Open a terminal and type:\nsudo -i\ncd /mnt\nmkdir root\nmount /dev/mapper/root root\nmount /dev/sdyz root/boot\n\nsdyz should be replaced with your boot partition. Next, type:\nchroot root\nmount -t proc proc /proc\nmount -t sysfs sys /sys\nnano /etc/crypttab\n\nOpen a second terminal and type sudo blkid. Find the UUID for root (the one that says crypto_luks in the end) and paste it into /etc/crypttab. Then the file /etc/crypttab should look something like this:\nroot UUID=d68911dd-172a-4608-86d4-084eb72f409c none luks\n\nClose the file with Ctrl+x, y and Enter. Type nano /etc/fstab in the terminal and check if everything looks right (e.g. the UUIDs).\nAt last, quit the chroot environment and type:\ncryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/sdxy --header-backup-file /root/root.img\n\nThis puts an image of the header of the encrypted partition into the folder /root and names it root.img. Then move the image to an external drive (in case of forgetting the password).

The graphics card supports up to 6 heads.  I cannot simply switch to a card that has 5-6 ports due to space limitation (unless it was extremely low profile).\nMy configuration:\n- Ubuntu 14.04\n- Using gnome in place of Unity\n-- output of ps aux: gnome-session --session=gnome-fallback --disable-acceleration-check\n- Five monitors - 3 connected directly via mini-DisplayPort, with two others connected using Club DisplayPort splitter\n- I set the monitors up using xrandr and then captured this config by creating a monitors.xml with the Display settings console\nProblem:\n- On average, 1 of 4 boots does not properly read the monitors.xml.\n- When it doesn't, the resolution and rotation are not correct.  It goes to the default setup of extending them next to each other in a horizontal orientation (I lose the rotation and non-standard resolutions).\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've found reports of forgotten settings and tried most of these fixes without any improvement.\nUbuntu - forgetting screens prefs\n\n*I've tried manually settings with xrandr after an arbitrary sleep (15 seconds) at boot.

I'm going to be performing some testing to see if this resulted in any change.\n\n*Look into a udev rule that would wait for the splitter monitors to be found, and then manually run xrandr.  This seems to do exactly what monitors.xml is doing, however, with the unity-settings-daemon and xrandr module.\n\n\nAny thoughts or experiences with this?\n\nA: This issue did appear to be related to the timing of the initialization of the monitors.

It only had four primary functions (ssh, ftp, http, and mysql (for use by web pages)).  Before I started my release upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04, I made sure that both\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get upgrade\n sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nto be absolutely certain I had the latest 14.04 packages before trying to upgrade the release.  Once that was done, and the system was rebooted (and ran the above commands again, to be sure they didn't see anything new), just to be safe, I ran 'sudo do-release-upgrade -d' to go from 14.04 to 16.04.\nEverything we quite smoothly of the previous two systems upgraded the same way, but the web server upgrade hung during the mysql part and it appears to have destroyed any ability I have to run mysql on the system.  Period.\nFrom what I've read, people are STRONGLY recommended to upgrade mysql 5.5->5.6->5.7, because jumping directly from 5.5 to 5.7 can cause some table compatibility problems.  Unfortunately, my (fully up-to-date, remember) web server was still running mysql-5.5.\nI have copies of /var/lib/mysql that I captured while do-release-upgrade was hung, but mysql-5.7 AND mysql-5.6 both refuse to use them.  It appears to be impossible to install mysql-5.5 on Ubuntu 16.04 in order to manually step through the releases. I tried getting the packages from the mysql web site, but I can only find mysql-server there, not -client, -common or anything else.\nSo, the 14.04 to 16.04 upgrade appears to have destroyed my database.  Yes, I know, not having a current backup is my fault, but after two flawless upgrades, and under a deadline (that has evaporated, since the database seems to be gone for good, now) I was too comfortable -- I had trust in the people who built the upgrade.  I know I should check in advance for anything that might break but, honestly, I thought that was the packager's job.  Saying the customer should check everything is like saying a car buys should have the car disassembled and every part checked for flaws prior to purchase -- it ain't gonna happen.\nIf there is any way to return to mysql 5.5 on Ubuntu 16.04 so that I can run through the CORRECT/RECOMMENDED (by mysql) upgrade procedure, please let me know.  If not, does anyone know of a good primal scream therapy group in Central Florida?\nUPDATE:  I've managed to get the database in good working order again by building a virtual 14.04 server and repairing/rebuilding the database files on it.  I successfully upgraded the virtual 14.04's mysql from 5.5 to 5.6.  Next, I need to learn what I must do in order to be sure the 5.6 to 5.7 upgrade works.\nUPDATE 2:  Despite the scoldings, I've managed to get my repaired database to work under mysql 5.6 on the upgraded system.  Now I'm getting errors because PHP support for mysql is not installed.  They may be baby steps, but it is progress!\nUpdate 3:  SUCCESS!  I reinstall all of the php7 /mysql packages and made sure my web app was using the mysqli database type and, voila!  I think I'll stay at mysql 5.6 for a while, though.  Until I'm a bit more comfortable with the upgrade path to 5.7.x.  Hopefully, this may provide a cautionary tale to others like me -- but if they're too much like me, then they won't see this until it is too late.\n\nA: This happens because upgrading from 14.04 to 16.04 causes an unsupported mysql upgrade (5.5 -> 5.7), which is not a supported upgrade path as documented by mysql. The easiest way around this is to upgrade mysql to 5.6 whilst still under 14.04. You achieve this by first (of course!) dumping all your databases;\nmysqldump --lock-all-tables -u root -p --all-databases > backup.sql\n\nthen upgrading to mysql 5.6;\napt-get install mysql-server-5.6 mysql-client-5.6 mysql-server-core-5.6 mysql-client-core-5.6\n\nThis way, all your databases are upgraded in place and (on my machines so far) entirely safely and transparently to 5.6. The only issue after the upgrade may be TIMESTAMP entries. Now, after the do-release-upgrade, mysql is still left at 5.6 and the issues surrounding the non-supported upgrade from 5.5 directly to 5.7 during the release upgrade never even surface.\n", "Q: Compiling Cinnamon I am trying to build Linux Mint's cinnamon DE on Ubuntu 14.04 but I get this error on the make command, can someone help?\n  CC       libst_1_0_la-st-bin.lo st/st-bin.c: In function 'st_bin_set_child':st/st-bin.c:465:7: error: 'clutter_actor_unparent' is deprecated (declared at /usr/include/clutter-1.0/clutter/deprecated/clutter-actor.h:58): Use 'clutter_actor_remove_child' instead [-Werror=deprecated-declarations]\n   clutter_actor_unparent (old_child);\n   ^\nst/st-bin.c:475:7: error: 'clutter_actor_set_parent' is deprecated (declared at /usr/include/clutter-1.0/clutter/deprecated/clutter-actor.h:54): Use 'clutter_actor_add_child' instead [-Werror=deprecated-declarations]\n   clutter_actor_set_parent (child, CLUTTER_ACTOR (bin));\n\nThis is for a Raspberry Pi 2B (armhf proc) \nAnyway I'm trying to reinstall clutter now see if it helps\n\nA: Try this :   \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:moorkai/cinnamon\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon\n\nThen log out and press on Ubuntu button like here:\n\nThen select cinnamon.\n", "Q: I just wiped my computer and installed 16.04 LTS and I am not able to shut it down or restart I just wiped my computer and installed 16.04 LTS and I am not able to shut it down or restart it just hangs in till I have to force shut down, by holding the power button. \n\nA: Since the install appears to be a fresh install, you can reinstall it to the same partition in a non-destructive way that will insure the integrity of the system files.\nTo do this, run the Install and choose do something else for the install option.\nPick the partition where you performed the previous install.

I have successfully setup and used special 'guest' accounts so the directories are wiped between uses.  This scheme worked well for 14.04 LTS.  I just tried a trial setup of 16.04 LTS (which in other test environments solves an unrelated annoying problem with some software we would like to run).\nThe problem is that after the upgrade I can no longer log into the \"guest\" account.  All the administrator and standard user accounts work fine but the automatic \"guest\" login goes into a loop (as described in other questions, *login the screen clears and the system starts to setup but fails in some way I can't determine and returns to the login screen).\nWhat makes this different is that the 'guest' directory is created on the fly so .Xauthority and local log files aren't visible to me.  I can't get much information or apply some of the proposed fixes outlined in the referenced sites for more permanent accounts.\nI have changed the 50-unity-greeter.conf file to allow guest logins removing any files that might prevent guest logins.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where can I get more diagnostics on what seems to be going wrong here?\n\n*What has changed in the handling of guest accounts?

The source of the problem in my case which posits another more general one is in the execution on the auto.sh and prefs.sh scripts in the /etc/guest-session directory.  These scripts are intended to run ahead of the login so as to do last minute configurations.  I have one of each that ran fine under 14.04.  The offending instruction is a usermod command:\n\nusermod -a -G dialout $USER\n\nwhich I use to allow guests to use devices plugged into the USB port.  This command worked well in the auto.sh stage of the script under 14.04.\nUnder 16.04 if I place this command in prefs.sh (where it seems like it should belong) I get the infinite loop problem.  If I place it in auto.sh the script executes normally but it is ineffectual (probably because it needs root privilages to change groups.\nI found this by trial and error.

There you can login with your user account and install what you need.\nWith Alt+F7 your should come back to the x-server or just reboot your machine. Holding down Ctrl is only necessary when switching from the GUI to a text-based virtual console.\n\nA: Well, there's always TTY virtual consoles : press Ctrl + Alt + F1 , login , and sudo apt-get install whatever packages you need, or better yet ( as Elliot Frisch suggested )  sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop.

After installing nvidia drivers it is displaying at wrong resolution (and starts long time after boot, a few seconds before display manager) and I decided to remove it.\nWhy Plymouth is so important for package manager?\n\nA: Plymouth is well-integrated into Ubuntu, and removing it could get difficult. Fortunately, you don't need to remove plymouth in order to disable it; there's a GRUB boot option called splash that can toggle the graphical boot screen on or off.\n\nTo disable graphical boot in Ubuntu, you need to open your /etc/default/grub file for editing, with superuser privileges. Under regular Ubuntu, this can be accomplished with:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n(on a command-line-only system or any other Ubuntu variant, open a terminal and type sudo nano /etc/default/grub instead.)\nLocate the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line in /etc/default/grub , it might look like:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nThen remove the splash from this line, so it looks like the following:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet\"\n\nSave the file and exit the editor. \nFinally, to apply your changes, open a terminal and run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNow your system should boot in text mode, without the graphical boot screen.\n", "Q: Login loop after changing username I'm using 14.04.

In Linux, your ping will continue to ping forever.  You can use the -c flag to limit the number of pings:\n\n\n*\n\n*ping -c 1 172.16.0.1\nAfter reading the Windows Docs for ping, I understand the -t flag is to make the ping keep pinging forever.

After boot I always have to run route add default gw 192.168.1.1 manually.  Any idea of what can possibly be wrong?  I could swear this setup used to work fine on older versions...\n\nA: I am configuring a Raspberry Pi as a router and ran into the same problem. I fixed it by editing the file /etc/dhcpcd.conf.\nOpen the file and look for the line:\n# A list of options to request from the DHCP server.\noption domain_name_servers, domain_name, domain_search, host_name\noption classless_static_routes\n\nI simply commented out \"option classless_static_routes\"\n# A list of options to request from the DHCP server.\noption domain_name_servers, domain_name, domain_search, host_name\n# option classless_static_routes\n\nI am now getting an automatic default route set by the DHCP server.\nA similar thing could be attempted with dhclient by editing the file /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf and looking for this line:\nrequest subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,\n        domain-name, domain-name-servers, domain-search, host-name,\n        dhcp6.name-servers, dhcp6.domain-search,\n        netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu,\n        rfc3442-classless-static-routes, ntp-servers;\n\nand removing the request for rfc3442-classless-static-routes.\n\nA: I'm experiencing the same issue on Ubuntu Server 16.04.  After troubleshooting, my issue stems from my DHCP server also providing a Classless Static Route (DHCP option 121, rfc3442-classless-static-routes in ISC DHCP), from a Microsoft DHCP server (Windows Server 2008 R2).\nLooking at /sbin/dhclient-script, if at least one classless static route is provided to the DHCP client, it disregards the router setting, hence no default route set.\n# if we have $new_rfc3442_classless_static_routes then we have to\n# ignore $new_routers entirely\n\nMy \"fix\" is to add another classless static route to the Windows DHCP server.  So:\n\n\n*\n\n*Destination: 0.0.0.0\n\n*Network Mask: 0.0.0.0\n\n*Router: 192.168.1.1\n\n\n(once added, the Network Mask is automagically changed to 255.255.255.255)\nI do have short DHCP lease expiry (15 minutes) and have not had any complaints from other Linux or Windows users on the network since adding the new route, so I figure the change should not cause major issues.\nAs I'm too new to comment:\n\n\n*\n\n*@t11z My lease file is /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.ens32.leases, option routers is present and valid.\n\n*@Jos Although a workaround, your suggestion defeats the purpose of utilizing DHCP to provision network settings. If the default gateway IP address changes in the future, affected machines will need to be updated manually.\n\n", "Q: PyBFD cannot find Binutils in 16.04 I've upgraded my distro from 15.10 to 16.04 LTS.

You can find more information on how to configure UFW here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW\n\nA: Other answers have pointed out most of the causes. I would add another reason for not able to ssh. If you ssh by password authentication method, it may be because your password is a bad one. Just update a decent password, it will work. This was driving me crazy to find out...\n\nA: Try port forwarding port 22 if you are trying to connect with a public IP address, because that would be the only reason why you can only connect to it using the local ip address of the server. Also yes if you are using the ufw firewall and it is enabled make sure you have 'ufw allow 22' executed.

I remembered Kompozer being able to do these things as well, so tried installing it.\nI'm aware that Kompozer has stopped and is no longer being maintained, but I couldn't find any alternative that has these two options so started to try anyway.\nFollowing the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallKompozer I managed to get it working, but when I perform a software update it gets removed again. I also get the 'Error Broken count >0' notification, and cannot update until I remove kompozer again.\nWhile installation the only error I get is that libidl0 is not installed. When I try to install it, I get the message that it has been replaced by libidl-2-0:i386 libidl-2-0. I've installed these two packages but it doesn't solve the problem.\nAny help for this newbie?\n\nA: It is still possible to do, although a little convoluted:\n\n\n*\n\n*The package libidl0 is no longer present in Xenial; you can still find it in Trusty.  You therefore have to install it manually.  Go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/libidl0 and download the file for your architecture (i. e. amd64 for 64 bit systems) and install it.\n\n*Then you can follow the original instructions minus the libidl0 package installation.\n\nThe installation can be abridged to just two commands once you have the three Deb package files in the current working directory:\nsudo dpkg -i libidl0_*.deb kompozer_*.deb kompozer-data_*.deb\nsudo apt install -f\n\nThe first will likely end in a missing dependencies error which the 2nd command will fix.\n", "Q: How to enable 5.1 channel playback on a Realtek ALC887-VD chip? I have an ASUS F2A55-M LE board which includes a Realtek ALC887-VD chip. Stereo audio playback works just fine but I have a 5.1 speaker set that I would like to use. I am able to achieve full surround playback in Windows 10 using the same machine but I can't seem to get it working within Ubuntu 16.04.\nI've tried setting default-sample-channels = 6 in /etc/pulse/daemon.conf but even after rebooting it doesn't make a difference. Playback is still only two channels.\n\nA: In addition to changing default-sample-channels in /etc/pulse/daemon.conf, it was also necessary to launch alsamixer and change the number of channels to 6:\n\nNote: you may need to restart between changing daemon.conf and using alsamixer.\n", "Q: 16.04 constantly reconnecting to WiFi Using Ubuntu 16.04, my computer is constantly reconnecting to my WiFi network.

The problem is that the O/S does not provide an option to send audio output to the Bluetooth controller - this is a Bluetooth controller firmware issue. Basically I am not able to load the *.hcd file I made from a *.hex file into the kernel (my interpretation of this issue with my very limited understanding).\nImage #1 - Bluetooth is connected to Bluetooth card in PC (screen shot is of 'blueman' software as suggested in Bluetooth won't find devices!):\n\nImage #2 - Core of problem, no option to output sound to connected Bluetooth device:\n\nImage #3 - when I run dmesg | grep -i blue the result is as follows (confirms the issue is a firmware problem):\n\nI have spent over 8 hours looking through posts on this issue, and I can say\nthat out of very many posts with similar unanswered issues, there is a gem which explains how to fix this issue. Have a look: Bluetooth Broadcom 43142 isn't working\nI followed this instruction manual to the T! The only problem is that it didn't work for me. The image below shows the final step of the solution to the post I linked to. Now, does it not work for me because the *.hcd needs to go to a different location (as everything else is *.bin) in addition to this location? Could it be the naming of the hcd file? Is there some command to force load the *.hcd file into the kernel? do I need to remove some other piece of software? Can I load the driver I created using 'System Settings' > 'Software and Updates' > drivers tab?\nIt seems that all that needs to be done is to somehow load the compiled hex file (hcd file) into the damn kernel.

Next I uninstalled blueman using software center:\n\nAt this point do a restart. After the restart there will only be one bluetooth logo (instead of two)\n\nAt this time pair the chosen device as usual. Now when you go to sound settings, you will see the Bluetooth device.\n\nA massive thanks to Pilot6, first for posting a working solution, and second for responding when I asked for help. Thank You! Too bad the blueman software breaks the firmware used by the O/S, the blueman interface is really nice. Well problem fixed....

My educated guess about what happened, based on your description, is:\n\n\n*\n\n*You installed Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\n*When you tried to install Windows 7, you booted in EFI/UEFI mode, so it complained about the MBR partition table and you converted it to GPT and installed Windows in EFI/UEFI mode. This would have rendered Windows bootable and Ubuntu unbootable. This could have been repaired, but....\n\n*You booted Boot Repair in BIOS mode, and proceeded to trash the EFI System Partition that held the Windows boot loader, thus rendering Windows unbootable; and for whatever reason, Boot Repair was unable to get Linux booting again.\n\n\nAt this point, I recommend you read my page on the CSM and its perils for background information. Without an understanding of the CSM, you're likely to dig yourself into the same hole again.\nIt's almost always best to install both OSes in a dual-boot in the same boot mode -- that is, both in BIOS mode or both in EFI mode. Mixing boot modes is a recipe for disaster. Furthermore, given the way most EFIs are designed, it's usually best if that boot mode be EFI; as my page describes, using BIOS mode turns the boot process into a complicated mess that's as likely to lead to problems as to a successful boot. Thus, I have some specific suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable your CSM. This is the single most important thing to do.\n\n*Change the type code of /dev/sdc1 so that it's an ESP. (It's currently marked as a BIOS Boot Partition, which is useless for EFI-mode booting.) Note that there's a chance that this partition still holds the Windows boot loader, so correctly marking it as an ESP might be all you need to do to get Windows booting; but you may need to create a new FAT32 filesystem on it and do more repairs. You can change the type code using gdisk by changing it from EF02 to EF00; or with parted or GParted by removing the bios_grub flag and replacing it with a boot flag.\n\n*Re-install the Windows boot loader using Windows tools. You should ask for details of how to do this on a Windows forum.\n\n*Install an EFI boot loader for Linux. There are a couple of relatively simple ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Boot Repair, but boot the repair disk in EFI mode. (If you can't boot in EFI mode, the disk is probably prepared incorrectly. My page on the CSM that I referenced earlier goes into this subject in detail.)\n\n*Prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R image of my rEFInd boot manager. (Images for both are on that page.) Boot with it, and using rEFInd, boot Ubuntu. You can then install rEFInd to the hard disk using the Debian package or PPA.\n\n\n\nInstead of those last two top-level bullet points, you could re-install one or both OSes -- but be sure to do so using the same boot mode (preferably EFI mode). Note that this will go best if you disable the CSM and fix the type code of your ESP.\n\nA: You're bang on with what happened.\nDiscussing with other people, I'm realizing that dual booting Ubuntu and Windows 7 on a single SSD with a GPT partition table is not a diserable route to go down.\nAparently MBR/legacy setup is the least problematic. I reinstalled everything that way, works now like a charm.\nThanks for your time.\n", "Q: Lockscreen access denied (AD auth via sssd) On xenial, the lock screen doesn't work for me. Whether I enter the correct password or not, it won't let me in. However, if I click on the menu at the top right corner of the screen and choose \"switch user,\" but choose the same user as at the lock screen it lets me right in.\nAt the lock screen, authentication seems to work correctly. It just doesn't authorize me. Here's what I see in /var/log/auth.log:\nMay  3 11:57:44 hostname compiz: pam_krb5(unity:auth): user myuser authenticated as myuser@MYDOMAIN.NET\nMay  3 11:57:44 hostname compiz: gkr-pam: unlocked login keyring\nMay  3 11:57:44 hostname compiz: pam_sss(unity:account): Access denied for user myuser: 6 (Permission denied)\n\nAuthentication is from an Active Directory domain. I'm using sssd. This same configuration works fine on Trusty, Vivid, and Wily. Only seems to be broken on Xenial. I've tried on a workstation that was upgraded from Wily, as well as a fresh install. I'm having a heck of a time figuring out what needs to be done differently.\nOnly AD accounts are affected by this. Local accounts are not.\nIt also fails when running something via the gui that requires elevated privileges. For example, when installing software from the Ubuntu Software Center. It won't let an AD account authorize installation, but it will allow a local user to authorize it. Yet from the command line, AD accounts can use sudo with no issues.\nSomething is making pam unhappy. Any idea what it could be?\n\nA: This fix was posted as a comment to the bug that vargax submitted. If you add:\nad_gpo_map_interactive = +unity\n\nto the [domain/domainname] section of /etc/sssd/sssd.conf, the lock screen problem goes away. \nUnfortunately, this does not solve the problem with elevated privileges in the gui.\n\nA: Those are two separate (but likely related) bugs. No one posted a log that demonstrates the error of the elevated privileges, so I can't tell you what option to add to sssd.conf to fix it. \nI got \"unity\" from \"pam_sss(unity:account): Access denied\" (the text before the \":account\" is the name of the PAM service being contacted).\nThe bug here is that the downstream Ubuntu maintainer didn't adjust the default set of values for the AD provider to include whatever PAM service is in use here, and it denies by default if it's unknown.\nThe ad_gpo_map_interactive = +unity is a workaround; I've submitted a patch to SSSD upstream to add this by default. I might do the same for whatever is affecting the elevated privileges if it doesn't conflict with anything else. Otherwise it will be Ubuntu's responsibility to modify that in the downstream package.\n\nA: Check if /etc/fstab is correctly set to the disc partitions.\nThen i would reconfigure lightdm itself\nFor last resource i would try reinstalling ubuntu itself seeking the user and password settings during installation.\nPAM seems to be very tricky.\n\nA: I just submit a bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sssd/+bug/1578415\nMaybe you guys can mark yourself as affected...\n", "Q: Application resolution problems with Macbook Pro retina I installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my Macbook pro retina mid 2014.

(The third one works of course; I'm sure it's clear that's the correct one!) These names are all the same despite the fact that I have unique names to the printer and fax in hp-setup (which are now duplicated, but I think I'll have better luck removing those extras).\nI can't figure out where information about these scanners is stored, or how to clear them, or anything like that. There aren't any other such devices on my subnet.\n\nA: D'oh, of course I figure it out right after posting.\nAnyway, hp-setup is still the answer, despite the default GUI only adding things -- run hp-setup -r and check everything in the resulting list, even though none appear to be a scanner.\n", "Q: 14.04 to 16.04 upgrade ignores NetworkManager.conf The machine in question was a straight from dvd install of 14.04 (upgraded to date before upgrade to 16.04 on 27-APR-16), with static ip, bind9 and registered domain. /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections edited to reflect static ip, namesevers, search. /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf was edited #dns_dnsmasq allowing information from /etc/dhcp/dhclienet.conf to used for /etc/resolv.conf. \nAfter upgrade /etc/resovl.conf reads nameserver 127.0.0.1.

The . references this directory itself while the .. references the parent directory.\nSo ../../ is a relative path which points to the current working directory's \"grand-parent\" directory i.e. the directory two levels above your current one.\nSo as you ran the mv command in question from inside /etc/apache2/sites-available, you moved the other folder into the directory two levels above from this one, which is /etc.\n\nA: What it did is that it moved the source content to ../../ ( parent of parent).

Thanks!\n\nA: You stated that you \"just copied my old set of databases\" The word \"copying\" in this situation could imply an incorrect approach. Of course your \"copying\" may have involved other undisclosed steps.  MySQL seems to be structured to export your databases and to then import them into the \"new\" database. Not actual copying.\nDo you still have your original MySQL configuration operational? Are the databases still there and accessible?\nDo you have MySQL installed on your \"new\" system? \nDo you have phpMyAdmin installed? If not look into how to use mysqldump.\nIf phpMyAdmin is available, use phpMyAdmin to export your databases.\nAfter that copy the output to the download folder of the \"new\" computer system.\nOn the \"new\" computer system, again use phpMyAdmin, but in this case, to import the databases from the download folder. Importing your databases should resolve your permissions problem.\nFor additional more in-depth guidance on how to export/import do an internet search on \"mysql exporting databases\". \nHere is a random pick example based on using mysqldump: \"Export and Import all MySQL databases at one time\"\n", "Q: mir session in 16.04 shutdown my monitors I am trying to test the unity8 mir session in ubuntu 16.04 but when I log in using the session both my monitors turn off.\nI installed unity8 using \nsudo apt-get install unity8-desktop-session-mir\n\nMy graphic card is (lspci):\nIntel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v3/4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 06)\n\nCan you tip me in the right direction?\n\nA: I found the answer in Michale Hall's blog.

There was a hiccup with verification, but tracking this down on StackExchange indicated it was a known issue with the signing process, so I re-ran apt-get install mongodb without the -y flag. Installation then succeeded, or so it seemed. But when I tried to start the service, this happened:\n$ sudo service mongod start\n[sudo] password for mark: \nFailed to start mongod.service: Unit mongod.service not found.\n$ sudo service mongod status\n● mongod.service\n   Loaded: not-found (Reason: No such file or directory)\n   Active: inactive (dead)\n\nSure enough, the file /etc/init.d/mongod does not exist. The install directions explicitly say this file is provided:\n\nThe mongodb-org package includes various init scripts, including the init script /etc/init.d/mongod. \n\nThe file does exist in the sources on GitHub. So I can carry on. But I'd like to know why a critical configuration file is missing from a successfully installed package. (Call me a completist.) \nMy Ubuntu release is 16.10, which is not officially supported. I wouldn't think that could be the cause. Could the release version really be to blame? Or was it a mistake to install the packages unsigned? Or is the package itself broken? Or is something else going on here?\n\nA: I was just wrong. The release incompatibility is the issue. It appears a post-install script was silently failing, which is why the missing file did not exist.\nThe solution turned out to be very similar to this question, which suggests running this script. \nI made minor changes to the script, in accordance with a change to the default file locations for MongoDB 3.2.6. (The changes aren't strictly necessary. I just don't like cruft.) Previously, data files were located in /data/db/. The default location is now /var/lib/mongodb/, and the old location is no longer used at all. So I removed the lines in the script that refer to that path. \nUbuntu now uses systemd by default rather than Upstart, so /var/run/mongodb/ is no longer needed. I just commented out these lines rather than removing them. If you're still using Upstart for whatever reason, you'll need to uncomment the three lines that refer to this path.\nThe updated script looks like this:\n# enable_mongo.sh\n\necho '[Unit]\nDescription=High-performance, schema-free document-oriented database\nAfter=syslog.target network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=mongodb\nGroup=mongodb\nExecStart=/usr/bin/mongod -f /etc/mongod.conf\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target' > /lib/systemd/system/mongod.service\n\n# Setup the required directories\n# mkdir -p /var/run/mongodb/\nmkdir -p /var/log/mongodb/\nmkdir -p /var/lib/mongodb/\n\n# chown mongodb:mongodb /var/run/mongodb/\nchown mongodb:mongodb /var/log/mongodb/\nchown mongodb:mongodb /var/lib/mongodb/\n\n# chmod 0755 /var/run/mongodb/\nchmod 0755 /var/log/mongodb/\nchmod 0755 /var/lib/mongodb/\n\n# Start the new service and enable it on boot\nsystemctl --system daemon-reload\nsystemctl enable mongod.service\n\necho \"Starting\"\nsystemctl start mongod.service\n\n", "Q: Lvmetad is not active yet After upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04, it is showing the following message during the boot:\nlvmetad is not active yet; using direct activation during sysinit\n\nlvmetad is not active yet; using direct activation during sysinit\n\n/dev/mapper/server--vg-root: clean xxx/xxx files, xxx/xxx blocks\n\nThe Xs refers to a big sequence of numbers. After this message appears, the login screen is shown and I can log in to the system.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: Don't worry, there is no danger, follow this little guide to resolve the problem.\nThese messages are not dangerous, after a while LVM (a software abstraction over your disk) will scan the partitions and your system will boot normally. There is a delay due to the lack of optimization, since lvmetad is a system service (daemon) that caches the LVM condition to prevent useless disk accesses and it does not start soon enough (probably for a bug or misconfiguration).\nUbuntu Desktops doesn't need it to work.\nSolution\nOpen a Terminal (CTRL+ALT+T or search in Dash), write sudo -H gedit /etc/lvm/lvm.conf and press ENTER (insert your user credentials).\nIn the editor find:\nuse_lvmetad = 1\n\n...and change the line to:\nuse_lvmetad = 0\n\nDo not make other changes, you only need to change a single number and save the file. After this, you may close the Terminal or log-off from the VT.\nThis will disable any attempt to use the lvmetad daemon and if your disk configuration is simple enough your boot will be faster and any LVM command will not try a new connection to the system bus of lvmetad. You may notice more disk activity, this is a normal behavior.\nThe warnings will remain, this is the right behavior and it doesn't have side affects.\nPlease note: this is a good but temporary solution, future GNU/Linux versions will not need this procedure.\nOptimization\nAfter the edit, you may also execute (in the same type of Terminal) the command sudo systemctl disable lvm2-lvmetad.service to disable lvmetad completely.\nThis is not necessary and you should contact your system administrator before doing it.\nWhat NOT to do\nNever boot with the nomodeset option enabled, because it WILL disable many GPU features and your graphics card may not work correctly. Ubuntu Desktops will not work correctly with this option enabled, because Unity (and successive GUIs) and many applications need the graphic acceleration and the advanced GPU features.\nThis option must be only used to debug graphic drivers or to start a system without the right graphic drivers.\nImportant: on some systems the user may need to disable this option in GRUB to login, while other systems will simply be slower but usable.\nEDIT (10/03/2017): after disabling the service and upgrading one of my Debian machines (Ubuntu is based on Debian) I noticed that the warning disappeared. The upgrade installed the kernel Linux 4.9.0-0.bpo.2 for AMD 64 (64-bit). It can be temporary or limited to some architectures, but it is a step forward, also because Ubuntu can inherith the change.\nI suppose that a developer saw this message and they are working on the problem. Well done FOSS.\n\nFell free to comment under here if you need more help and don't forget to press the left UP arrow and accept the answer.\n\nA: I managed to resolve this for my machines by adjusting the grub configuration like so:\nIn /etc/default/grub, change:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset\"\n\nThen add this line: GRUB_TERMINAL_INPUT=\"console serial\"\nRun update-grub and reboot for the changes to take effect.\n", "Q: Disappearing mouse cursor, when upgrading from 15.10 to 16.04 LTS I recently tried upgrading from Lubuntu 15.10 to 16.04 LTS on my old Toshiba laptop.

While fixing wordpress, I removed owncloud.  Now, if I try to install owncloud, I get the following errors:\n    Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have\nrequested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable\ndistribution that some required packages have not yet been created\nor been moved out of Incoming.\nThe following information may help to resolve the situation:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n owncloud-server : Depends: php5 (>= 5.4.0) but it is not installable\n                   Depends: php5-pgsql but it is not installable\n                   Depends: php5-json but it is not installable\n                   Depends: php5-ldap but it is not installable\n                   Depends: php5-cli but it is not installable\n                   Depends: php5-cgi but it is not installable\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nI am installing the package from the owncloud repository for Ubuntu 16.04 here:\nhttp://download.owncloud.org/download/repositories/stable/Ubuntu_16.04/\nI have read the article about the 16.04 upgrade breaking owncloud here:\nUbuntu 16.04 upgrade: authorization issue\nHowever, I have not been able to find a workaround.  I would imagine I just need some way to trick owncloud to use PHP7, but I can't figure out how to do that.

I would try going into your \n/etc/apt/sources.list.d \n\nfind the owncloud one and change the number from 16.04 to 15.10  or maybe even 15.04 and then \nsudo apt-get update \n\nand then try to install \nsudo apt-get install owncloud-files\n\nfirst and if that doesn't work try installing\nsudo apt-get install owncloud  \n\nIf it will install that way .. after install I would go back and re-update your owncloud.list back to 16.04 and another apt-get update .. then see if there is an update to it and try to update\n", "Q: Add a delay to a keyboard shortcut To put my screens on standby, I've defined a keyboard shortcut:\nxset dpms force standby\n\nThis causes the screens to go into standby mode immediately.

You may download them here:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.6-rc7-wily/\nPlease download and install the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-headers-4.6.0-040600rc7_4.6.0-040600rc7.201605081830_all.deb\n\n*linux-headers-4.6.0-040600rc7-generic_4.6.0-040600rc7.201605081830_amd64.deb\n\n*linux-image-4.6.0-040600rc7-generic_4.6.0-040600rc7.201605081830_amd64.deb\n\n\n(Sorry, I cannot post direct links to the files because of askubuntu reputation restrictions)\n\nA: Same issue here. Using the same graphics card.\nEDIT: I got it fixed by installing the latest 4.6 kernel packages from the mainline repository. It looks like something needs to be backported to the default 4.4 kernel of Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: I see you upgraded kernel and solved your problem. I have same specs and I upgraded to kernel 4.6 and now DRI_PRIME=1 glxgears works fine. \n... but running games with DRI_PRIME=1 command brings me same (poor) result as running with integrated card. Is it normal or I am missing something?\n", "Q: imwheel refuses to \"window spread\" currently I have my ~/.imwheelrc\n\".*\"\n, Thumb1, Super_L|w\n\nSuper_L|w from the keyboard works and invokes the window spread.  But in imwheel it just prints the letter \"w\".  I tried      , Thumb1, Super_L|a and imwheel correctly invoked the expo.  \nI even tried remapping the window spread to Alt_L|Shift_L|w and that didn't work.  I tried it on Thumb2 with no luck.  imwheel just refuses to invoke the window spread.  \nDoes anyone one have any ideas why or an alternative solution?\nThanks.\n\nA: I found a cleaner solution than the original I was having problems with.\nInstead of using imwheel..  I used CompizConfig Settings Manager\nunder Window Management -> Scale -> Bindings -> Initiate Window Picker (with the mouse icon).  For my case I wanted the first thumb button which was button8.  Done.\n", "Q: Interrupted upgrade from 15.10 to 16.04, Ubuntu boots into black screen What happened\nI was working on my laptop while it upgraded from 15.10 to 16.04 (which I admit was a mistake) when suddenly the Unity overlay disappeared and the only thing on screen was the Firefox browser window. I switched to a new terminal, logged in and tried to run sudo service lightdm restart but instead of restarting correctly, the screen started turning on and off repeatedly, which freaked me out, so I physically turned off the PC.\nLong story short: I forced a shutdown halfway through the Ubuntu upgrade.\nEver since, any attempts of logging in normally have been met with a solid black screen and the idle whirring of the CPU fan.\nWhat I have tried\nI have tried the recovery mode boot up, but no luck (The log does greet \"Welcome to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS!\"). I tried out each option that seemed useful:\n\n\n*\n\n*dpkg goes through the packages as advertised, but strangely enough it always locks up on some Braille package until I do Ctrl+C, at which moment it spouts some error messages and then I think throws me into the normal boot.\n\n*failsafeX results in a similar situation to the normal boot: a black void.\n\n*fsck says the single partition I have is a-ok.\n\n*grub seems to get a bunch of stuff. Don't know if it searches locally or fetches from the internet.\n\n*network didn't work I think.\n\n\nI tried following this answer but couldn't do the sudo part because the filesystem was mounted as readonly.\nSo I ran fsck which mounts as RW and tried again. \nThis time, after running apt-get autoremove it went through many packages (Setting up foobar (X.Y.ZubuntuN) ...), sometimes installing packages, which I assume is the usual behavior. One thing to note though is it kept getting stuck several times, so I had to Ctrl+C it out of processing the current package. It finally ended on \"Processing was halted because there were too many errors.\".\nWhile this question seems to mention some of the graphics problems I've been experiencing... I have Intel HD Graphics, not Nvidia. I'll keep looking into it.\n\nA: One solution, maybe not the best, but one I would try, is to just reinstall over your broken system, without removing your personal files.\nGet your hands on a fresh 16.04 Installation Medium (not the old version) and prepare your computer. Making  a backup of your /home folder is always a good idea.\nYou can take a look at this link for more information on how to do this properly.\nThe basics are this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu like you usually would.\n\n*When choosing the installation type, try a \"install over\" or \"upgrade\" option. The description of the option should say something like \"Documents, Music, and other personal files will be kept...\"\n\n*Install the system as usual.\n\n\nThe key part about this is to not format the home folder. If you have a separate partition for /home, don't format it. If you don't have a separate partition, don't format /, but select it as the root installation location.\nBenefits of this method?\n\n\n*\n\n*Easy\n\n*Reliable\n\n*Almost guarenteed to work\n\n*You will keep all your files and preferences in your home folder\n\n\nThe downsides?\n\n\n*\n\n*You lose your installed applications (you'll have to reinstall them)\n\n*Application settings or configurations that aren't found in your home folder will be reset (most applications put settings somewhere in /home, so this will only be the case for a few applications)\n\n*Might take a while depending on the speed of your computer\n\n\nA: You can use the Live-DVD/USB to fix your system.\nBoot the Ubuntu Live-DVD/USB.\nOpen a terminal,Press Ctrl+Alt+T\nType the following:\nexec sudo -i\n\nUse the fdisk utility to list the partitions on a device.\nType the following:\nfdisk -l\n\nsuppose fdisk informed that / is /dev/sda1\nType the following:\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nmount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nmount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts\nmount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nmount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nchroot /mnt\nnano /etc/resolv.conf\n\nAdd OpenDNS name servers to /etc/resolv.conf file:\nnameserver 208.67.222.222\nnameserver 208.67.220.220\n\nCtrl+O Save file.\nCtrl+X Close nano.\nNow type the following:\napt-get update\napt-get -f install\napt-get dist-upgrade\napt-get autoremove\ndpkg --configure -a\napt-get clean\numount /dev/sda1\nreboot \n\nNote: change /dev/sda1 for your / partition\n\nA: In the end, doing apt-get autoremove on the RW filesystem and then rebooting seems to have fixed enough so that I could log in graphically again (albeit without Unity components showing up, but that was a different problem). I'll leave the question up, even if it's messy and goes into tangents, in case it might help anyone with a similar problem.\nThanks to Zach and kyodake for their helpful answers, but thankfully I didn't have to resort to reinstalling the OS or using the Live CD tools... this time.\n", "Q: juju ERROR Unable to connect to environment \"maas\" whether i do juju status or destroy-environment or bootstrap i am getting the error \nERROR cannot connect to API: unable to connect to \"wss://10.1.1.187:17070/environment/f41f9bb1-c503-4a7b-81c0-07fa221f8a4e/api\"\n10.1.1.187 is the IP that was used by juju while bootstrapping that MAAS node....it is the IP for juju-br0 on the juju bootstrapped server......I can ping that IP from MAAS server........This preventing from installing openstack or to deploy an juju service........ \n\nA: Try $ juju destroy-environment maas --force, then bootstrap again.\nIf it doesn't help, share maas log file (/var/log/maas/maas.log)\n", "Q: Libparted complaining about GPT signatures on disk This warning comes up while using the Ubuntu studio \"Live\" from an USB stick, in a PC where the program is installed but the GRUB doesn't work.\nWhat does this mean and how can I fix this issue?\n\n\nA: If you prepared a \"live\" boot disk by using dd to copy a .iso file to a USB flash drive, then the disk uses a Frankenstein's Monster sort of partition table, and GParted will produce a warning message like that if you launch it on the USB disk (or without explicitly specifying another disk). Thus, this warning may be normal, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's also not a bug, because the disk partition table is, as I said, a monstrosity by design. If this is the case, you should ignore the problem and do not try to use GParted to modify the partition table on /dev/sdb (as noted in the warning), although you can use GParted to modify the partition table(s) on other disk(s).\nOTOH, if you prepared your boot disk with a tool like Rufus or UNetbootin, the partition table should be more normal. Also, if /dev/sdb is a regular internal hard disk rather than a USB flash drive, then the warning you're seeing could indicate a serious partition table problem. I can't offer more specific repair advice because the warning doesn't present the details I'd need to diagnose the issue. You might want to consult my page on repairing GPT disks for some general guidance on this topic, and post back with more details if you think you've got a real problem.\n", "Q: How do I keep 16.04 LTS up to date? I regularly use the Software Updater to keep 16.04 LTS up to date.  Today when I opened the Software Center, there was one OS update available that \"Improves performance, stability and security improvements\". It also shows \"bind9-host\" and \"1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-8ubuntu1\".  Should I also install this OS update?\n\nA: You can install unattended-upgrades by typing the following commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades\n\n*sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades\n\n\nA: Yes. Whenever the update manager comes up with an update, it is a release-wide update (everybody's machine gets it). These small updates keep 16.04 up-to-date and error free between major and minor releases.\nSome updates may not be \"checked\" be default because they are not for the core of Ubuntu.

You can additionally get it from their website.\nI've used it previously on systems that somehow had ended up with lots of junk, and it does work. However, I've found Linux systems don't usually end up with a lot of extra files that need cleaned up, unless a user explicitly downloaded/stored something somewhere.\n\nA: how about increasing your system partition instead of deleting some unknown files that may cause system meltdown? If you got free space like unallocated space on the hard disk, try merge it to system partition in Disk Management. If you got free space in other partitions, shrink one of them and add the redundant space to system partition.\n", "Q: How can I install CuDNN on Ubuntu 16.04? For TensorFlow I would like to install cuda and CuDNN. How do I do that on Ubuntu 16.04?\n\nA: Fast forward 2018 and NVIDIA now provides cuDNN 7.x for download. The installation steps are still similar with those described by @GPrathap. But if you want to replace the old cuDNN version with the newer one, you need to remove it first prior to the installation.\nTo recap:\nStep 0. Verify that you already have installed CUDA toolkit. Proceed with CUDA toolkit installation if you haven't.\nStep 1. Go to NVIDIA developer portal https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn and download cuDNN.\nStep 2. If you have previously installed cuDNN, remove it\nsudo dpkg -r <old-cudnn-runtime>.deb\nsudo dpkg -r <old-cudnn-dev>.deb\n\nStep 3. Install the cuDNN library (runtime, dev, doc) using dpkg\nsudo dpkg -i <new-cudnn-runtime>.deb\nsudo dpkg -i <new-cudnn-dev>.deb\nsudo ldconfig\n\nStep 4. If you want to find where the library was installed you can update the locate index and then find the library location.\nsudo updatedb\nlocate libcudnn\n\nIf you are specifically installing cuDNN 7.x against CUDA toolkit 9.1, this article provides more elaboration that can be of some help: http://tech.amikelive.com/node-679/quick-tip-installing-cuda-deep-neural-network-7-cudnn-7-x-library-for-cuda-toolkit-9-1-on-ubuntu-16-04/\n\nA: From 5.1 onwards you can't install according to what @Martin mentioned. \nDownload libcudnn6_6.0.21-1+cuda8.0_amd64.deb, libcudnn6-dev_6.0.21-1+cuda8.0_amd64.deb, libcudnn6-doc_6.0.21-1+cuda8.0_amd64.deb from nvidia site  and install one by one follwing way. \n sudo dpkg -i <library_name>.deb\n\nEdit:\nYou must first install runtime (libcudnn6_6.0.21-1+cuda8.0_amd64.deb) because dev depends on the runtime (Thanks @tinmarino)\n\nA: Also, you can download the deb packages for Debian based distributions.\nFrom the NVIDIA web page, for the developer profile are available the next files :\n\n\n*\n\n*cuDNN v5.1 Runtime Library for Linux (Deb)\n\n*cuDNN v5.1 Developer Library for Linux (Deb)\n\n*cuDNN v5.1 Code Samples and User Guide Linux (Deb)\n\n\nI tested this, over my machine with Debian (Stretch) and TensorFlow is working !\n\nA: Adding an important detail to the still valid answers by @Martin Thoma and @Íhor Mé:\nAfter copying the libcudnn files to the cuda directories, you must update your .bashrc file:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64\"\nexport CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda\n\nYou must then add the include directory to any config file that uses it.\nCaffe e.g. has a config file which you must edit before compiling with make. For this, edit caffe/Makefile.config to add the paths to these config variables(add whitespace between paths):\nINCLUDE_DIRS: /usr/local/caffe/cuda/include/ \nLIBRARY_DIRS: /usr/local/cuda/lib64/\n\nFor every current terminal window you want these changes to be effective, don't forget to execute the file once!\n. ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: Step 0: Install cuda from the standard repositories. (See How can I install CUDA on Ubuntu 16.04?)\nStep 1: Register an nvidia developer account and download cudnn here (about 80 MB)\nStep 2: Check where your cuda installation is. For the installation from the repository it is /usr/lib/... and /usr/include. Otherwise, it will be /usr/local/cuda/ or /usr/local/cuda-<version>. You can check it with which nvcc or ldconfig -p | grep cuda\nStep 3: Copy the files:\nRepository installation:\n$ cd folder/extracted/contents\n$ sudo cp -P include/cudnn.h /usr/include\n$ sudo cp -P lib64/libcudnn* /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/\n$ sudo chmod a+r /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn*\n\nRunfile installation:\n$ cd folder/extracted/contents\n$ sudo cp include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include\n$ sudo cp lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64\n$ sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Register on NVidia's website. It may take a day, or two before they'll get your account approved. At least that used to be the case back when I registered.\n\n*Download and Install latest CUDA from NVidia, or the latest version that fits the software you'll be working with, if any, in this case your version of T-Flow.\nNote, that installing via ubuntu's standard package manager via clicking probably won't work appropriately.\nInstead, you'll probably have to follow these instructions in the terminal to install .deb pakage. After that you'll have to add a few lines to .bashrc, or wherever appropriate in your case. For example, if you're configuring a server, it's probably going to be a different place, maybe somewhere prior to your app's autolaunch, as .bashrc will probably not get executed in that case.\n\n*Download CuDNN from NVidia \nI used the \"Library for Linux\" version, didn't have much luck with .deb packages.\n\n*You can find where CUDA is located via\nwhich nvcc. Usually /usr/local/cuda/ will be a symbolic link to your currently installed version. \n\n*Open CuDNN archive and copy appropriate contents into appropriate places within CUDA installation folder (cuda/lib64/ and cuda/include/). I usually sudo nautilus and do it from there visually.\n\n\nA: the answer is correct but for cuDNN 5.1 some names have been changed. So if you use this version after extracting the cuDNN file you will find two folder: lib and include. change the name of *.h file in include folder to cudnn.h and then follow https://askubuntu.com/a/767270/641589. this change is needed if you wanted to use cuDNN for Caffe!\n\nA: In 16.04 if you are installing CUDA directly from Nvidia's website and you are also building Tensorflow from source then you can specificy the directory you want to indicate as being Cudnn.  By default it is : \n/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu\n\nWhen you are building Tensorflow it will ask you which version you want to indicate you are using for Cudnn.  Then after that it will ask where is it located.  Just indicate the directory above and it will work fine.  It should create a wheel file at that point and you can install it with pip.\n", "Q: Apparmor Init Failed, Exit Code 123 Apparmor fails boot and command line start with same result as below\nx@x-NICEPUTER:~$ systemctl --failed\n  UNIT             LOAD   ACTIVE SUB    DESCRIPTION\n● apparmor.service loaded failed failed LSB: AppArmor initialization\n\nLOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.\nACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.\nSUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.\n\n1 loaded units listed.

My friend is running Ubuntu 14.04. I need to give him some technical support, but I can't visit his house, so I want to stream his screen.\nWe both have pretty slow Internet plans (800 kilobits per second, both up and down.) I want fair resolution, enough to read text, etc. Therefore, the FPS will have to be very low in order for this to work on this speed. Even if the FPS is 0.5, I don't mind. That is enough for me to offer technical support.\nI'd also prefer if it was easy to set up, as I'll have to explain to him over the phone how to set it up. I'd like if someone could offer me a step by step answer on how to set this up. If anyone does this and it works, I'll give them a bounty on the answer.\nCan Skype for Linux do this?

Today suddenly I am seeing that it freezes during shutdown. I have no idea why this is happening.\n\nA: The launchpad discussion (linked below) has several suggestions you may find work for you.  Assuming your cause is the same, it is suspected that swap and/or systemd are the issue.  Try these possible fixes:\nsudo systemctl reboot\n\n(works occasionally for me, but not 100% of the time)\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nor even a combination of the two\nsudo swapoff -a && sudo systemctl reboot\n\nThough, when I tested this, the swapoff part took > 10 mins anyway.  For shutdown, replace 'reboot' with 'poweroff.' \nAs a side note, I have had this same issue on my PC from Ubuntu 15.04 through the current 16.04.  It is possibly connected to how long the computer has been in use.

How can I fix the boot menu?\n\nA: Grub Menu will appear if you press and hold \n\nShift\n\nduring loading Grub, then select the distro you want to boot into.\nMore info HERE\n\nA: Based on the question, I suspect \"no boot option for Ubuntu\" refers to GRUB 2 boot loader that has been installed earlier by Debian, and not the one belongs to Ubuntu.\nIn related matter, I have a dual boot setup of Debian 8.2 Xfce and Xubuntu 14.04 on my test machine. For my setup, the installations are noted below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Debian is installed first, then Xubuntu is installed afterwards\n\n*Boot loader that is installed to hard disk itself i.e. /dev/sda belongs to Debian, which will not detect Xubuntu that was installed afterwards\n\n*Boot loader that is installed to its partition i.e. /dev/sda3 belongs to Xubuntu, which will detect Debian at partition /dev/sda2, when chainloading from boot loader at /dev/sda.\nFollowing this, I'd say \"no boot option for Ubuntu\" occurs because GRUB 2 boot loader in Debian somehow doesn't detect other operating systems that have been installed afterwards. Yet, I didn't manage to reconfigure GRUB 2 configurations in Debian to make detection possible.\nWorkaround\nThe workaround is to add new entry manually in /etc/grub.d/40_custom, then run update-grub in Debian. Despite shown for Xubuntu, this can adapted similarly for Ubuntu.\nmenuentry \"Chainload to Xubuntu\" {\n    insmod ext2\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set <UUID>\n    chainloader +1\n}\n\n<UUID> is UUID value of the partition that can be checked by running blkid as root in Debian. Look for the corresponding line that looks like /dev/sda3: UUID=\"...\" and copy the value without the quotes (your Ubuntu might be installed at different partition).\nchainloader +1 will look for bootloader in next partition. Chainloading is more convenient than specifying linux and initrd manually, because user doesn't have to edit these lines whenever Ubuntu had updated its kernel release.\nAnyway, when the menu is selected, the GRUB 2 boot loader will redirect to another GRUB 2 boot loader that belongs to Xubuntu, which will show boot option for Xubuntu.\nSolution found (2016-06-06)\nThere was no need to reconfigure GRUB 2 configuration at all. The relevant configuration file already exists at /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober. Unlike Ubuntu and its flavours, Debian by default is missing a package called os-prober.\nTherefore, Debian users will have to manually install os-prober via APT and re-run update-grub. Boot options for Ubuntu will be seen on next boot.\nSee also this answer on Unix SE, which has been posted recently from this date.\n", "Q: How to increase VB resolution? (Ubuntu host, Windows 7 guest.) The host is 14.04, the guest is Windows 7.\nThe maximum screen resolution I'm offered in the control panel of the guest is 1024 x 725.\nMy actual screen resolution is 1600 x 900 and I have a NVIDIA Geforce GTX960M graphics card.\nHow can I increase the screen resolution in the guest?\nI already have the guest additions installed.\n\nA: The reason I had this problem was because the VM was in windowed mode. It turns out that the larger screen resolutions only appear in the control panel when you have actually resized the VM window to a large enough size for the resolution. So,  I put the VM into full screen mode,  and the larger screen resolutions promptly appeared in the control panel.

Now the (hyper intelligent) Ubuntu installer (contrary to the Debian installer) doesn't allow me to set the mirror/country to use for the package downloads, which makes the installations quite slow (other than setting up a mirror myself and point every installation to that one, but that would be cumbersome for various reasons)\nSO, how do I tell the installer to let me pick the mirror I want to use contrary to my locale/country settings?\n\nA: you can install ubuntu without using updates and after installation change mirrors in /etc/apt/sources.list or update-manager and you can use update-locale and locale-gen fr_FR fr_FR.UTF-8 as expemple to change your settings.\n", "Q: How to put ubuntu 14.04 LTS into Performance mode I've tried the indicator-cpufreq but look at this: Screenshot of the indicator\nRendimiento means High Performance and Ahorro de energía means Powersave.\nSeems like the indicator is obsolete, is there any other indicator for 2016?\n\nA: Try this:\nInstall cpufrequtils:\nsudo apt-get install cpufrequtils\n\nThen edit the following file (if it doesn't exist, create it):\nsudo gedit /etc/default/cpufrequtils\n\nAnd add the following line to it:\n\nGOVERNOR=\"performance\"\n\nSave and exit.\nDisable ondemand daemon\nsudo update-rc.d ondemand disable\n\nYou can check your settings with:\ncpufreq-info\n\n", "Q: Windows not see ubuntu files I had ubuntu 14.04 in my laptop but my laptop crashed due to gpu error.

The main problem comes down to the fact that the sender can indeed specify \"special\" treatment for attachments that they include and Thunderbird then blindly follows the instructions in the email to open the PDF attachment as a video. What is even worse is that receiving such email and opening the attachment also adds the mime type to your MimeTypes.rdf and confuses Thunderbird further.\nI know this doesn't help you much, but at least you now know what the issue is exactly and can try to manually work around it.

I usually navigate through a local network shared folder from a Linux machine via smb (i.e. from file manger using smb: ).\nNow whenever I try to access the shortcut or typing credential again I keep getting the dialog window asking for user, domain and password.\nSo I tried mounting the location manually using cisf-utils doing:\nsudo mount -t cifs //fileshare1/docs1/user/My\\ Documents/shared/Francesco/ /home/frank/used_shared/ -o username=my_user,password=my_pass,domain=my_domain,gid=1000,uid=1000\n\nI get mount error(13): Permission denied.\nI'm definitely sure my user has permission on that folder cause I can access it from a windows machine.\nAlso if I try to mount my personal folder on that location through:\nsudo mount -t cifs //fileshare1/docs5/francesco.azzarello/ /home/frank/mnt_folder -o username=my_user,password=my_pass,domain=my_domain,gid=1000,uid=1000\n\nI can access it with no problem.\nFor reference I'm using 4.2.0-36-generic kernel and my mount.cifs version is 6.4\nAny idea on how to make one of both methods work?\n\nUpdate Rgarding ponsfrilus answer\nnumber 1: verbose option returns: \n_mount.cifs kernel mount options: ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx,unc=\\\\fileshare1\\docs1,uid=1000,gid=1000,user=my_user,,domain=my_domain,prefixpath=user/My Documents/shared/Francesco/,pass=********\nmount error(13): Permission denied\nRefer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)_\n\nNumber 2 is basically the same thing:\n_ mount.cifs kernel mount options: ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx,unc=\\\\fileshare1\\docs1,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,user=my_user,,domain=my_domain,prefixpath=user/My Documents/shared/Francesco/,pass=********\nmount error(13): Permission denied\nRefer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)_\n\nAnd nothing changed with vers=2.1: \n_mount.cifs kernel mount options: ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx,unc=\\\\fileshare1\\docs1,vers=2.1,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,user=my_user,,domain=my_domain,prefixpath=user/My Documents/shared/Francesco/,pass=********\nmount error(13): Permission denied\nRefer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)_\n\nAs for number 4 I can mount docs1 no problem but I can navigate tho get to the shared folder in user.\n\nA: *\n\n*Try to add the \"-v\" option to get verbose output:\nsudo mount -v -t cifs //fileshare1/docs1/user/My\\ \n   Documents/shared/Francesco/ /home/frank/mnt_folder -o \\\n   username=my_user,password=my_pass,domain=my_domain,gid=1000,uid=1000\n\n\n*Test with these options to the mount command \niocharset=utf8,rw,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777:\nsudo mount -v -t cifs //fileshare1/docs1/user/My\\ \n   Documents/shared/Francesco/ /home/frank/mnt_folder -o \n   username=my_user,password=my_pass,domain=my_domain,\\\n   iocharset=utf8,rw,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777\n\n\n*Test specifying the SMB version option (vers=2.1), see the samba wiki. From the mount.cifs man page:\n\nvers=\n             SMB protocol version. Allowed values are:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*1.0 - The classic CIFS/SMBv1 protocol. This is the default.\n  \n*2.0 - The SMBv2.002 protocol. This was initially introduced in Windows Vista Service Pack 1, and\n             Windows Server 2008. Note that the initial release version of Windows Vista spoke a slightly\n             different dialect (2.000) that is not supported.\n  \n*2.1 - The SMBv2.1 protocol that was introduced in Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008R2.\n  \n*3.0 - The SMBv3.0 protocol that was introduced in Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.\n\n\n*Finally, try to mount only the first share :\nsudo mount -v -t cifs //fileshare1/docs1/ /home/frank/mnt_folder \\\n   -o username=my_user,password=my_pass,domain=my_domain,\\\n   iocharset=utf8,rw,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777\n\nAny verbose output you can share might help.\n\nA: For this problem when using cifs higher than 6.0:\nnew version of cifs use the domain variable instead, so creadentials file look like:  \nusername=<your username>\npassword=<your password>\ndomain=<your domain>\n\n\nA: Adding the option sec=ntlm to the mount command  resolved my issue.\neg:\nsudo mount -t cifs -o username=administrator,password=123456,sec=ntlm //ip/eeshare /mnt/eeshare/\n\n\nA: I'm pretty sure I ran into this exact same problem today on Ubuntu 16.10 I tried all the suggestions in this thread several times, I could mount the exact same share using Windows Server 2016 and I could browse it using smbclient (smbclient -U brainstrust //WINBOX01/shared).  I even tried an external credentials file.\nI ended up stumbling on a fix - although I'd created a local user for the share on the Windows box, it was also joined to a domain.  Basically setting the domain to be the local machine -o domain=WINBOX01 fixed my problem instantly, so leaving a comment here in the hope that its useful to someone out there.\nThe complete minimal command I used was:\nsudo mount.cifs -v //WINBOX01/shared /home/geoff/winbox01  --verbose -o user=brainstrust,password=topsecret,domain=WINBOX01\n\n\nA: I think you have the wrong security type for the server , error 13 means the server isn't letting you in.\nYou will need to select the right security mode in your mount command add a sec option via -o as follows [reference]:\nsec=\n   Security mode. Allowed values are:\n   ·   none - attempt to connection as a null user (no name)\n   ·   krb5 - Use Kerberos version 5 authentication\n   ·   krb5i - Use Kerberos authentication and forcibly enable packet \n       signing\n   ·   ntlm - Use NTLM password hashing\n   ·   ntlmi - Use NTLM password hashing and force packet signing\n   ·   ntlmv2 - Use NTLMv2 password hashing\n   ·   ntlmv2i - Use NTLMv2 password hashing and force packet signing\n   ·   ntlmssp - Use NTLMv2 password hashing encapsulated in Raw NTLMSSP message\n   ·   ntlmsspi - Use NTLMv2 password hashing encapsulated in Raw NTLMSSP message, and force packet signing\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 graphics crashes with Intel graphics I just updated a laptop to Ubuntu 16.04, and now I see the following problem.

In a bash script, I wish to pass in a string which is contained in a variable, and contains up to 3 substrings separated by the '+' symbol. Each substring will have a specific numeric value, sort of like an octal mode.\nI'd like to split the string into the substrings, convert them to their numeric value, and add the values together.\nFor instance if my substrings and values are:\n\n\n*\n\n*hat = 1\n\n*shirt = 2\n\n*trousers = 4\n\n\nAnd my variable containing these in a string is:\nmy_outfit=shirt+trousers\n\nI'd like a variable called outfit_value to have a value of 6. How should I go about doing this?\nI've thought about setting IFS to '+' and reading the variable into an array, then looping through the array and converting each element to its value. Unfortunately, my head turns to custard when I think about retrieving these numeric value elements and doing an arithmetic expression.\nEDIT:\nThis is what I have so far, it seems to work, but I'd like to know if there are any problems, or if it could be done more safely/efficiently:\nmy_outfit=hat+shirt+trousers\n\noIFS=$IFS\nIFS=+\nread -a clothes <<< \"$my_outfit\"\nIFS=$oIFS\n\noutfit_value=0\n\nfor string in ${clothes[@]}\ndo\n   if [[ $string = \"hat\" ]]\n   then\n      add_value=1\n   elif [[ $string = \"shirt\" ]]\n   then\n      add_value=2\n   elif [[ $string = \"trousers\" ]]\n   then\n      add_value=4\n   fi\n   let outfit_value=\"$outfit_value\"+\"$add_value\"\ndone\n\necho \"OUTFIT VALUE is $outfit_value\"\n\n\nA: With bash, in an arithmetic evaluation context, variable names do not require the $ prefix. That means this is possible:\n# set up the variables\nhat=1 shirt=2 trousers=4\nstring=\"my_outfit=shirt+trousers\"\n\n# evaluate the equation \n(( $string ))\n\necho $my_outfit\n\noutputs\n6\n\n\nA: Here's a variant of your original method, but using bash arrays.

After upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 on a Dell E6330 laptop with core I7 cpu, when running in the default Unity desktop with external USB keyboard and mouse, if I don't touch the keyboard or mouse for roughly 5 seconds the mouse apparently snoozes and it takes about 0.5 seconds of mouse motion before it resumes functioning.  Brief bumps of the mouse are usually ignored and the motion is lost.  The keyboard doesn't lose keystrokes and pressing a key before using the mouse prevents the mouse hesitation.\nIn my preferred XFCE desktop the issue is far worse.  Keyboard input is also lost.  Sometimes it can take several keystrokes to 'wake' the system.  In some apps such as PyCharm the problem seems worse and the system is more resistant to \"waking\" than in other apps such as gedit.\nThe laptop's internal keyboard and pointer stick work fine.  I'm not 100% sure about the trackpad as it can lose very slight motions after a pause but I think it might be its normal behavior.\nOn further testing I just discovered that if I plug my mouse into a USB port on the laptop instead of through my hub the problem goes away.\nMy question is does this sound like a power saving configuration issue and if so what settings or tools should I use to resolve it?\n\nA: Have you tried plug them on other USB ports in this notebook?\nAre them wired or wireless devices?\nIf wireless it could be low battery issue..\n", "Q: how to copy file or directory to remote machine using sftp I used this command sftp  cbuser@10.250.41.20 to start session with a remote virtual machine on the cloud and tried to copy files from my local machine to that machine and I used this command : put l1/l2/file.tar.gz  /rl1\nUnfortunately, I got the following error :\nremote open(\"/rl1\"): Permission denied\n\n\nA: This command\nput l1/l2/file.tar.gz  /rl1\n\ncopies file to the remote root directory (/), which is probably not what you want (and as a normal user, you certainly don't have access for this).

This is the default log file for many system events, services, and applications.\nsudo tail -f -n 1000 /var/log/syslog\n\nYour target service or application may use a different log file. Some services and applications have multiple log files. The Apache Web server, for example, has separate logs for access, errors, and SSL events. Also, some log files are configured to roll off into an archive file (usually in the same directory) after the original file reaches a certain size, e.g. 1 KB. Check the service or application's documentation (or search) for specific log file locations. \nAlso, you may find it helpful to open several console windows, and monitor multiple logs at once while you perform a test.\nFor example, if you were tracing events in a Web application that ran on Apache and used a MySQL database, you may want to open the following two commands in their own console windows. In fact, you may wish to trace these application logs along with the system log from above.\nsudo tail -f -n 1000 /var/log/apache2/error_log\nsudo tail -f -n 1000 /var/log/mysqld.log\n\nAs always, check the tail man pages for a full list of options:\nman tail\n\nA: Many things you simply cannot spot, because they are handled inside the application or process without any communication to \"the outer world\". \na random (totally incomplete) list of a few of the most important tools you could use however to monitor specific sections of what is going on:\n\n\n*\n\n*the top command: from man top:\nThe  top  program  provides  a dynamic real-time view of a running system.  It can display system summary information as  well  as  a list  of processes or threads currently being managed by the Linux kernel.  The types of system summary  information  shown  and  the types,  order  and size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable and that configuration can be  made  persis‐tent across restarts.\n\n*dstat. From man dstat:\nDstat allows you to view all of your system resources instantly, you can eg. compare disk usage in combination with interrupts from your IDE controller, or compare the network bandwidth numbers directly with the disk throughput (in the same interval)\n\n*wmctrl; although wmctrl does not provide realtime ongoing information, when used in a loop in a script, it is fairly easy to retrieve an almost realtime report or log on what happens concerning opened/moved/closed windows.\n\n*The dbus-monitor command, of which @Serg should be able to tell you much more. From man dbus-monitor:\nThe dbus-monitor command is used to monitor messages going through a D-Bus message bus. See http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for more information about the big picture. (in short: dbus is a simple way for applications to talk to one another. Note that dbus-monitor only works in cases where dbus is used, not as a general tool as mentioned by @heemayl (thanks!) )\n\n*The dconf watch command (relatively unknown). From man dconf: \n   watch\n       Watch a key or directory for changes.\n\nTry e.g. what happens in the output of dconf watch / , while editing system settings.\nThe bottom line is that there are many, many tools, each and every one of them to spot a specific section of what is happening. A one fits all answer is quite impossible, let alone a single terminal window to show even the beginning of \"the whole picture\".\nWhich tool is fit for your purpose depends on what events you specifically want to monitor.\n\nA: All activity is pretty broad.  To add to the existing answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*dmesg dumps the kernel log to the terminal.  Man page.\n\n*strace allows real-time tracing of all system calls from single a given process.  Man page.

The Ubuntu box has 4 extra hard drives, each shared separately, and all are formatted as NTFS.\nUntil recently, everything has been working fine. For the last few weeks (including before the upgrade to 16.04, when I was on 15.10) however, I have found that when I have one file open on any device from any of the file shares on the Ubuntu box, then if I open another file on the same device from the same file share, then an error will occur on either the first or the second files, where it appears that Ubuntu has closed the file handle. I then have to reopen whatever file it was that had the error, which usually works, but sometimes then causes the same type of error on the other open file. \nThe same issue continues if I try to open more than 2 files - and it's seemingly at random as to which of the already open files will experience the error.\nThis issue is most readily obvious when listening to music or watching videos, however I've checked and it also happens with .DOC and .PDF files and presumably all other types as well.\nHere is an example scenario:\nI am listening to an .MP3 from share #1 in Nightingale, and then open a .AVI (also from share #1) in VLC.  VLC will give an error:\n\nFile reading failed:\n  VLC could not read the file (Bad file descriptor).\n\nIf I then try to re-start the video file in VLC, almost always Nightingale will have an error and skip straight to the next track.\nIf I instead have one file open on share #1, and open a second file on share #2, there is no problem, everything works fine.  If I then open a third file on share #2, the problem occurs.\nTo me it feels like Ubuntu has some kind of file-handle limit going on for the file shares, and it's set extremely low. I've done some basic searching on settings, but haven't seen anything obvious so far.\nHere is what I have tried, all to no avail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applied all the latest updates\n\n*Upgraded from 15.10 to 16.04\n\n\nIn testing, I have confirmed that: \n\n\n*\n\n*it happens on either of the Windows laptops\n\n*it does NOT happen directly on the Ubuntu box, only when accessing via file shares.\n\n\nAlthough I occasionally install new things on the Ubuntu box, I don't recall doing so in the days before the problem start - with the exception of the normal Ubuntu updates available in Software Updater.  My fstab file has definitely not changed in this timeframe.\nPlease let me know what kind of information I can provide to help troubleshoot. \nAs an aside, the Ubuntu box does have one semi-frequent (~daily) error that comes up about smbd, but it's been happening ever since I first set up the shares 2 years ago, so I don't think it's relevant to this very recent problem starting.

For reference, this is what my hard drive looks like in windows: \nEdit: So after an uproar on Reddit, it turns out Lenovo has specifically confirmed that the 900 cannot run Linux. This is extremely disappointing for a laptop that costs so much.  \n\nA: I experienced the same problem (on a Dell XPS 13). The issue for me was that the SATA bios setting was set to raid (which Ubuntu doesn't seem to recognize?).\nThe following link (second post/ first answer) explains how to change it to ahci: \nhttp://www.eightforums.com/drivers-hardware/53429-migrating-raid-ssd-switching-ahci.html\n(edit: You can ignore the unplugging of the disk in the fifth step and the seventh step completly, those are not needed to changing to ahci) \nJust keep in mind to make some backups if you care about the data on your machine. Before finding the link above I did mess around a bit myself and got a few problems rebooting. \nBesides that, this worked on my machine so no idea how it will fare on yours. You probably want to be extra careful if you actually have multiple disks or raid setup or something like that.\nHope this helps! \n", "Q: What is the purpose of grub-common.service? I am tuning the start up of my machine and noticed that grub-common.service was at the top of systemd-analyze blame 12.628s grub-common.service\nCan this service be safely disabled?\n\nA: As you can see from the source https://github.com/JoliOS/grub2/blob/1efdfd9afceeb08661a5ae0565b3651fdf180601/debian/grub-common.init\nit records successful boot for GRUB.\n# Description:       GRUB displays the boot menu at the next boot if it\n#                    believes that the previous boot failed. This script\n#                    informs it that the system booted successfully.\n\nAlso if $VERBOSE is set (non silent mode, I assume), it logs it's actions.\nSo in theory if you disable this service, every time you restart your machine, grub menu will popup. Of course you can set up appropriate timeouts in /etc/default/grub. Beware, if you set up too low timeouts you might end up in the situation with cycling reboot and overgrowing logs, which cannot be rotated or archived.\nBe sure you have liveCD just in case.\n", "Q: Do I need to reinstall Xubuntu? A lot of libraries are missing I just upgraded from ubuntu 14.04 (not xubuntu) to xubuntu 16.04. During the installation, it said that it had failed to restore some applications. That was the only error it gave.\nNow whenever I try to run some applications, they fail to load some libraries, which are supposed to be in /lib folder.\nDo I need to reinstall it, overwriting the previous installation?\n\nA: You can try to fix dependencies:\nsudo apt check\nsudo apt -f install\nsudo rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\n\nI want to remember that  in 16.04 apt-get is deprecate \n", "Q: How to make dash search outside the home folder I am new to Ubuntu and very excited about life outside the MS-bubble! ;-)\nI want to set up a computer which shall serve as a library. \nMy system partition is on a SSD. The data (pdf, mp4, mp3 files) will be on a separate HDD. I as administrator will be the only one to write to the HDD. The other users of this computer need to search through the data on the HDD and read it.\nNow here is my question:\nHow can I make the dash search/index the content of the HDD so everyone can easily search through it? (Ubuntu 16.04)\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: As far as I know, Unity already searches the entire system for files or information, as long as the user has permission to read it and the drive the information is on is mounted. \nI tested this with my internal \"Storage\" HDD, searched something in it, and it found it (albeit after a few seconds). \nYou need to make sure the guest user (or kiosk user, or whatever user is searching things) has read and possibly execute permissions, but not write permissions. You can ensure this by going to the folder above where your data is stored and run the command (assuming your data folder is named \"Data\" and your username is MYADMINUSERNAME):\nchown MYADMINUSERNAME:MYADMINUSERNAME Data -R\nchmod 755 Data -R\n\nThis will set the owner and group of the folder Data to your user, then give you full permission (755), your group read and execute permission (755), and anybody else read and execute permission (755).\nAfter that, Unity will find your data, just it might take a while on a standard HDD. There's a lot of kiosk user mode settings you can do to optimize the search and the kiosk user experience, but that's for another post / question.\n", "Q: install opencv 3.1.0 I downloaded opencv3.1.0 and extracted it then I opened cmake and built it.Then I opened terminal and in its directory (the directory of given to cmake as build address) typed \"make\".when making is completed I typed \"make install\" but an error occured below:\n[100%] Built target opencv_traincascade\n[100%] Built target opencv_createsamples\n[100%] Built target opencv_annotation\nInstall the project...\n-- Install configuration: \"Release\"\nCMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:36 (FILE):\n  file cannot create directory: /usr/local/share/OpenCV/3rdparty/lib.

That should get you back to the windows system.  \nIf you want back Ubuntu, get the installation media and install it as usual. If the partition is not deleted, however, you could try to untick the \"format this partition\" option when installing but I can't guarantee full recovery of data  \n", "Q: Is there any way to use Android Studio in Ubuntu? If so, then how? I'm new in Ubuntu. I used to work in Android Studio to develop apps. \nI tried to install Android Studio, but when I went to their website, all they offered me a .zip file. I unzipped that. But I don't have any idea how to install that.\nAnd I don't know if anyone noticed it or not, but I think, that file for Ubuntu is not full, because the file for Windows is like 1.2 GB, while Ubuntu's file is only 200MB or something... Is that alright? \n\nA: There's nothing to install.  Just unzip the file and go to the ./bin directory of the package and run studio.sh.\nA common place for custom programs is the /opt directory.\nSo you can create a folder under /opt calling it android-studio or anything of your choice.  Then run the studio.sh from there.\nIf you unzip it into /opt/android-studio you'll have a folder in that directory called android-studio.  You could actually create a system-wide link to it so that you can run studio.sh from the commandline to start it.\nTo create a symbolic link perform this command:\n$ sudo ln -s /opt/android-studio/android-studio/bin/studio.sh /us/local/bin/studio.sh\n\nThen to run it just type studio.sh from the the terminal.\nDetails are also included on the sdk download site:\nhttp://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html\n", "Q: Configure Folder Sharing I am trying to share a folder in Ubuntu 16.04 so I can access it on a Windows XP machine.

Eclipse was properly installed using apt-get.\nWhen I launch Eclipse from Dash Home it doesn't open. It opens only through Terminal. How can I open it from the dash?\n\nA: The cause\nIf you install an application via apt-get, you can be pretty sure a correct .desktop file is installed in /usr/share/applications. That leaves us the only option that there must be an outdated .desktop file, representing Eclipse, in ~/.local/share/applications, most likely of a previous locally installed version, or some application must have created a local version of the previous .desktop file.\nSince local .desktop files overrule the global ones, you will have to remove it.\nWhat to do\nRun the command:\nrm ~/.local/share/applications/*eclipse*\n\nThis will remove all local version(s) of the .desktop file. Subsequently log out and back in.

This is a server build, with absolutely no GUI. It runs apache2, bind9, nfs, and a few other network-related services. For the most part, nothing was broken in the upgrade... except the network. Now, I have to run\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking start\n\nafter every reboot to get it to connect to the network. Not very helpful for a server.

Use that information and apply that to HerrTaschenbier's answer. You will also need to create the new file as he instructed, sudo vi /etc/systemd/network/20-ens32.network. The content is slightly different. \n[Match] \nName=ens32\n\n[Network]\nDNS=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nDomains=somedomain.com\nAddress=xxx.xxx.xxx\nGateway=xxx.xxx.xxx\n\nNote the file name format has the network adapter name in it.

This happened to me from a 14.04 to 16.04 upgrade.  \n\nA: I ran into the same issue after long usage of 16.04, probably some update messed things up. \nRunning systemctl status networking.service showed, that the service failed to start due to error in ifup -a call. Running ifup -a separately revealed that it is trying to work with eth0 interface, while ifconfig -a listed only enp0s31f6 and lo interfaces.

I have bought a new laptop specifically without Windows, which has only DOS.\nI understand how to prioritize the boot order in BIOS but in doing that, my understanding is that the OS on the DVD is only installed into the Memory. Correct me if I'm wrong. I want the OS on the DVD installed onto the Hard Drive.\nThe question \"How do I install Ubuntu?\" refers to creating a partition in the Hard Drive to share with Windows. I don't want Windows. My computer does have DOS which I now realize needs to be partitioned if I want to keep it.\nThe installation was simple. Ubuntu gave the option of \"Trying\" (leaving in the memory) or \"Installing\" (installing onto the Hard Drive) and then gave the option of leaving the existing FreeDOS (DOS & Ubuntu) or removing it (Ubuntu only)\nThanks Guys.\n\nA: A live CD can do both, you can run it in memory, or you can click the icon in the GUI to install it to a hard drive.\nDuring your installation of Ubuntu, you'll have the ability to set up partitioning to how you want it.  Assuming you're not going to keep FreeDos and you don't intend on installing windows later, you can let Ubuntu handle the partitioning and use the entire disk.\n\nA: If you boot from the disc it should open a window that gives you the option to \"Try Ubuntu\", which runs the OS from the disc, or you can \"Install Ubuntu\", which will install it to the hard drive, and also give you the option to overwrite any other systems on the hard drive.\n\nA: The \"running from memory\" refers to the try option provided at boot from DVD. \nProviding that you only want Ubuntu on this system the details about partitioning are NOT required. The install package on the DVD will replace the entire contents of the hard drive.

And don't do anything\n  to it unless you are sure it will result in your disk's partition\n  recovery, otherwise you may harm your data when attempting to recover\n  it.\nAfter that, all the testdisk related posts are useful for the specific\n  case, as you mention.

Which reminds me that if your\n  hard disk drive is having crossed clusters or data you may lose a lot\n  of information.\nGive testdisk a chance and please inform if you succeed on it by\n  commenting on the answers to your question.\n\nYou can download a testdisk binary to run it directly from a terminal in a Ubuntu live session or if you wish to go directly to the rescue mode in a terminal (no GUI) you can use the pre-built Hirens Boot which already has a lot of useful tools to recover data, which includes but does not limit only to testdisk.\nJust have in mind that testdisk will allow you to bring back your deleted partition and in the other hand you will be able to rescue your deleted data in a per-file basis.\nLet us know how do you do with this task and if need further assistante don't hesitate to drop a comment.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 LTS tablet cannot parse or open package lists I just got an Ubuntu Tablet M10 through BQ (see Ubuntu site for details).

Any help would be appreciated\njournalctl logs on connection of usb dongle:\nMay 04 19:09:31  kernel: usb 3-4: new full-speed USB device number 4 using xhci_hcd\nMay 04 19:09:31  kernel: usb 3-4: New USB device found, idVendor=0b05, idProduct=17cb\nMay 04 19:09:31  kernel: usb 3-4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3\nMay 04 19:09:31  kernel: usb 3-4: Product: BCM20702A0\nMay 04 19:09:31  kernel: usb 3-4: Manufacturer: Broadcom Corp\nMay 04 19:09:31  kernel: usb 3-4: SerialNumber: 5CF3706C6DB1\nMay 04 19:09:31  URfkill[924]: adding killswitch type 2 idx 1 soft 0 hard 0\nMay 04 19:09:31  URfkill[924]: Setting device 1 (BLUETOOTH) to unblocked\nMay 04 19:09:31  URfkill[924]: set_soft: Setting BLUETOOTH to unblocked\nMay 04 19:09:31  mtp-probe[5353]: checking bus 3, device 4: \"/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1c.0/0000:05:00.0/usb3/3-4\"\nMay 04 19:09:31  kernel: Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: chip id 63\nMay 04 19:09:31  mtp-probe[5353]: bus: 3, device: 4 was not an MTP device\nMay 04 19:09:31  kernel: Bluetooth: hci0: BCM20702A\nMay 04 19:09:31  kernel: Bluetooth: hci0: BCM20702A1 (001.002.014) build 0000\nMay 04 19:09:31  kernel: bluetooth hci0: Direct firmware load for brcm/BCM20702A1-0b05-17cb.hcd failed with error -2\nMay 04 19:09:31  kernel: Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: Patch brcm/BCM20702A1-0b05-17cb.hcd not found\nMay 04 19:09:31  bluetoothd[4595]: Failed to obtain handles for \"Service Changed\" characteristic\nMay 04 19:09:31  bluetoothd[4595]: Not enough free handles to register service\nMay 04 19:09:31  bluetoothd[4595]: Error adding Link Loss service\nMay 04 19:09:31  bluetoothd[4595]: Not enough free handles to register service\nMay 04 19:09:31  bluetoothd[4595]: Not enough free handles to register service\nMay 04 19:09:31  bluetoothd[4595]: Not enough free handles to register service\nMay 04 19:09:31  bluetoothd[4595]: Current Time Service could not be registered\nMay 04 19:09:31  bluetoothd[4595]: gatt-time-server: Input/output error (5)\nMay 04 19:09:31  bluetoothd[4595]: Not enough free handles to register service\nMay 04 19:09:31  bluetoothd[4595]: Not enough free handles to register service\nMay 04 19:09:31  bluetoothd[4595]: Sap driver initialization failed.\nMay 04 19:09:31  bluetoothd[4595]: sap-server: Operation not permitted (1)\n\n*****If I try and connect to the headset I receive the following errors:\nMay 04 19:01:14  bluetoothd[1180]: Unable to get connect data for Headset Voice gateway: getpeername: Transport endpoint is not connected (107)\nMay 04 19:01:14  bluetoothd[1180]: connect error: Too many levels of symbolic links (40)\nMay 04 19:01:14  bluetoothd[1180]: GLib: Source ID 212 was not found when attempting to remove it\nMay 04 19:01:16  bluetoothd[1180]: connect error: Too many levels of symbolic links (40)\n\n\nA: You can download required file from here.\nLocate it in brcm/BCM20702A1-0b05-17cb.hcd and place it into /lib/firmware/brcm/BCM20702A1-0b05-17cb.hcd. After that just re-insert bluetooth device. dmesg will show you that firmware properly loaded, so you can configure bluetooth with Bluez software.\n\nA: The crux of the issue is this:\n\nMay 04 19:09:31 kernel: bluetooth hci0: Direct firmware load for\nbrcm/BCM20702A1-0b05-17cb.hcd failed with error -2\n\n\nYour configuration is not right for this bluetooth adapter so the firmware that it needs will not run. Without the firmware its just silicon, it needs code to run it properly, that is the firmware.\nThis link should have the right firmware but it's not packaged for ubuntus beyond Oneiric so you will need to put it in /lib/firmware/brcm/ yourself\n", "Q: Wireless LAN worked in 14.04, doesn't on 16.04 even with the proprietary drivers The problem is, that the proprietary drivers, that worked with 14.04, no longer work for Ubuntu 16.04. I did not upgrade, I did a clean installation.sudo lshw -C network shows that my WLAN card is UNCLAIMED, even though I'm using proprietary drivers, which solved the issue back in 14.04. I did a clean install of Ubuntu 16.04, I did not upgrade. I'm new to Ubuntu, and Linux, I have been using Windows all my life, so bare with me. It would be really helpful if I could finally stop using my phone as a wireless tether. Also I used a script that was mentioned in one post to help with the answer.

Today, I started my computer and it hung after login, but before the desktop fully rendered (my custom background didn't even appear). I held down the power button to reboot and on login things looked 'off'. For instance, I keep the volume muted and the indicator showed it was turned all the way down instead of muted. I'm running Ubuntu on a mac and when I hit Fn+F10/11/12, nothing happened, but this usually works fine to change the volume. I tried rebooting again, to no avail. I was low on disk space, so I deleted some files and that didn't help, either.\nI have a secondary login that is nearly identical to the first. Upon logging in under that user, everything works normally, so it does not appear to be a systemic problem.\nThoughts So Far\nI have done a bunch of googling for the errors in .xsession-errors to no avail.

I get continuously failed with bluetooth. \nMighty mouse then again paired nicely. \nSystem: Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit\nHardware: Macbook Air 2013-mid\nKeyboard: Apple Wireless Keyboard 3rd gen   \n\nA: I was able to work around this issue by using the \"blueman\" package to pair the keyboard.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 doesn't shut down after suspend or hibernate Why no answer accepted\nFor the simple reason that I haven't been using Ubuntu for a long time, so I couldn't test the answers.\nThe question\nActually my question can appear identical to this one in this forum (and also this one elsewhere); indeed the question is the same, but I'm asking it anyway because I can give more informations and because I tried some solution found on the web (possibly getting things worse).\nI used to hibernate Ubuntu 15.10 (closing the lid).\nNow that I've updated it to 16.04 (I thought it was a good thing, since this version is LTS, unlike the 15.10), I cannot use hibernation (nor suspension!) anymore: if I try to use it, Ubuntu doesn't shut down, just the screen goes black, the power led is on, and I cannot do anything else than shutting it down manually (long press of the power button).\nWhen I power it on again, I see the following lines\n\nthen Ubuntu boots up.\nFrom here I tried with\nsudo -s\necho shutdown > /sys/power/disk\necho disk > /sys/power/state\n\nand\nsudo -s\necho platform > /sys/power/disk\necho disk > /sys/power/state\n\nOnly the first partially worked and only once: by partially I mean that after the brutal shut down the session was recovered.\nThen I tried to follow this suggestion. I didn't understand the comments written after the commands, so I literally entered the commands as they are (thinking that some error like \"this command/folder doesn't exist\" would have been occurred if there was something to substitute in the commands):\nEDIT\ncat /proc/meminfo\nsudo swapoff -a\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=8M\nsudo chmod 600 /swapfile && sudo mkswap /swapfile && sudo swapon /swapfile\nsudo -b gedit /etc/fstab\nfree -m\nswapon\n\nmount | grep \" / \"\nsudo blkid -g\nsudo blkid\nsudo filefrag -v /swapfile | grep \"First block:\"\nsudo filefrag -v /swapfile\necho \"resume=UUID=cdXX--X18 resume_offset=66050\" | sudo tee /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume\nsudo -b gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst\nsudo -b gedit /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"... resume=UUID=cdXX--X18 resume_offset=66050\"\nsudo update-grub -y\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nMaybe this has been a terrible idea, since now I get this.\n\nIn the end I found the question linked above and I went here, but I don't know what to do.\nEDIT 2 At the moment if I enter\n...$ sudo swapon -s\n\nI obtain absolutely nothing\n...$\n\n\nA: I had the same problem after upgrading from 15.10 to 16.04:\n\n\n*\n\n*Closing the lid did not do anything\n\n*Manually suspending with the menu item in the system tray resulted in a half suspended state with the only way out to reset the system.\n\n\nI solved these issues by \n\n\n*\n\n*upgrading the kernel to 4.4.8 (after this suspend from menu worked for me)\n\n*Adding the line HandleLidSwitchDocked=suspend to /etc/systemd/logind.conf (wich made the lid switch to work again).\n\n\nI think both issues are bugs that should be fixed (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1574120). \n\nA: By seeing your last image and EDIT 2, I can understand that Ubuntu can't find a Swap Partition on your system. So I suggest you should create a Swap partition equal to or larger than your RAM size, and try again by running\nsudo pm-hibernate\n\nYou can create swap partition using GParted, run this to install it\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\n\nA: Forcing hibernate to power off the machine:\nAfter looking around a long time for an answer to this that actually addressed the issue (not related ones), I found a tip here which got the job done for me:\nCreate a file in the pm config directory:\nsudo vim /etc/pm/config.d/hibernate_mode\n\nthat sets the variable HIBERNATE_MODE like so:\nHIBERNATE_MODE=\"shutdown\"\n\nAfter doing this, hibernate powered down the machine on completion like expected. An explanation for what setting HIBERNATE_MODE does is in the manual for pm-hibernate:\n\nDefault method to power down the system when\n  hibernating. If not set, the system will use the kernel default as a\n  default value. Check /sys/power/disk for valid values. The default\n  value will be surrounded by [square brackets].\n\nMy default in that file was platform. Setting the variable above to shutdown overrides this, and gets what we want happening.\nRelated information and tips for getting hibernate to work correctly:\nAs for those \"related issues\" everyone seems to have with hibernating, quick debugging tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check that the command sudo pm-hibernate actually does something. If not, none of these other tips will make any difference. If it doesn't work, ensure 1) the size of your swap partition is greater than that of your RAM and 2) secure boot is disabled in your BIOS.\n\n*Only once that command works, look at integrating hibernate into your system as you please. A couple of common ones:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add hibernate to the Ubuntu menu: This seems to be the best answer to me. Official documentation also has a slightly different version.\nNote: once hibernate is added to the Ubuntu menu, you may also need to fix the alternative call to sudo systemctl hibernate. Apparently, (at least for Ubuntu 16.04) the Ubuntu menu option calls sudo systemctl hibernate instead of sudo pm-hibernate. systemctl hibernate was fixed for me by adding the following content to file /etc/systemd/sleep.conf:\n\n[Sleep]\n  HibernateMode=shutdown\n\nIf the file doesn't exists yet, you can create it. More info here. \n\n*Change the behaviour of the power button (by default it displays in interactive menu): To change it to directly hibernate, or shutdown you need to modify the associated gsettings entry. A lot of other answers go through the GUI way if that floats your boat. To see the available options use gsettings range org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-power\n\nA: Hibernate has been disabled by default.\nTry this\nsudo pm-hibernate\n\n\nIf the hibernate test works, you can continue to use the sudo\n  pm-hibernate command when you want to hibernate.\nYou can also enable the hibernate option in the menus. To do that, use\n  your favorite text editor to create\n  /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla.\n  Add the following to the file and save:\n\n[Re-enable hibernate by default in upower]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\n[Re-enable hibernate by default in logind]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate;org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate-multiple-sessions\nResultActive=yes\n\nRead More on Hibernation 16.04 from this link\nTo Shutdown\nsudo shutdown -h now\n\nTo Restart\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\n", "Q: error: attempt to read or write outside of disk 'hd0', can't shut down My ultra-book has dual boot of windows 10 and  Ubuntu 14.04.

So I restart my ultra book. then the error:\n\nerror:attempt to read or write outside of disk 'hd0'.  \n\nPress any key to continue.\nThen whatever key I pressed it is still the same. The power button does not work either. I can't even force to shut it down. what should I do?\n\nA: Try make a live version of Ubuntu and mounting the partition Ubuntu is on your hard drive. Look go to the file '/boot/grub/grub.cfg' and see if hd0 or a different drive number lives in the code. \nYou can see what hard drive number your grub.cfg should be on by using gparted. \nTake care. \n", "Q: Konsole hide tab bar Is it possible to hide konsole tab bar?

I have already seen some answers related to this, but they didn't bring me to a definitive answer, so I'm going to try again.\nBasically, my question is: how can I run Ubuntu Touch applications from the command line - specifically, so that I could debug them with gdb?\n\nMore details:\nFirst, what that means is that I'd like to run them from a remote shell connection to a (phone/tablet) device on a PC, either from adb shell or phablet-shell (see Hacking Ubuntu Touch, Part 5: adb shell vs. phablet-shell). I already got the Terminal app, but - given that one cannot establish a proper (VNC) remote desktop connection to an Ubuntu Touch system, - it is of little use to me, as I cannot really work with it (haven't yet tried a Bluetooth keyboard attached to a device, though).\nSecond, I'd like, if possible, to run applications in the foreground; then when called from the terminal command line, I'd expect the applications to dump their stdout printouts to the terminal. Thus, the recommendation in Ubuntu Touch: How do I run an ubuntu touch app from the terminal? I cannot use much, since (this is from a BQ E5 (Ubuntu 15.04, OTA-10.1)):\nphablet@ubuntu-phablet:~$ ubuntu-app-list\nubuntu-system-settings\ncom.ubuntu.calculator_calculator_2.0.233\nphablet@ubuntu-phablet:~$ ubuntu-app-launch com.ubuntu.calculator_calculator_2.0.233\nphablet@ubuntu-phablet:~$ \n\n... it simply launches the app in the background, and immediately exits. And AFAICS, webapp-container simply opens an URL in the browser, doesn't run arbitrary applications.\nSome of the preinstalled applications are apparently run by a program qmlscene, as How do I simply run an ubuntu touch app from the terminal? notes; but even the accepted answer there isn't applicable to Ubuntu 15.04 Touch as-is:\n$ /usr/bin/qmlscene \\\n> --desktop_file_hint=/usr/share/click/preinstalled/com.ubuntu.clock/3.7.456/share/applications/ubuntu-clock-app.desktop \\\n> /usr/share/click/preinstalled/com.ubuntu.clock/3.7.456/share/qml/ubuntu-clock-app.qml\nLoading module: 'libubuntu_application_api_touch_mirclient.so.3.0.0'\nfile:///usr/share/click/preinstalled/com.ubuntu.clock/3.7.456/share/qml/ubuntu-clock-app.qml:22 module \"Alarm\" is not installed\nfile:///usr/share/click/preinstalled/com.ubuntu.clock/3.7.456/share/qml/ubuntu-clock-app.qml:20 module \"WorldClock\" is not installed\n\n... and the application shuts down on device barely after being started. And below is the only command line I've found to work on a BQ E5 Ubuntu 15.04:\nAPP_ID=com.ubuntu.clock_clock_3.7.456 \\\nQML2_IMPORT_PATH=/usr/share/click/preinstalled/com.ubuntu.clock/3.7.456/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf \\\nQML_IMPORT_TRACE=1 \\\n/usr/bin/qmlscene \\\n--desktop_file_hint=/usr/share/click/preinstalled/com.ubuntu.clock/3.7.456/share/applications/ubuntu-clock-app.desktop \\\n/usr/share/click/preinstalled/com.ubuntu.clock/3.7.456/share/qml/ubuntu-clock-app.qml\n\nThe application then starts on phone, while on shell terminal messages are being dumped, like:\nLoading module: 'libubuntu_application_api_touch_mirclient.so.3.0.0'\nQQmlImportDatabase::addImportPath: \"/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/qt5/qml\"\nQQmlImportDatabase::addImportPath: \"/usr/share/click/preinstalled/com.ubuntu.clock/3.7.456/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf\"\nQQmlImportDatabase::addImportPath: \"/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/qt5/bin\"\n...\n\n... and after you press Ctrl-C in terminal, the application exits.\nWhy I like this, is for one, I know what is the application printout and how to redirect/save it - and for another, I know how to build a gdb command line in order to debug. I managed to set the device in writable mode, and from the shell install build-essential (see Recommended way to install regular(cli) .deb packages on Ubuntu Phone?), which pulls in gdb, so now it is available in shell also in read-only mode. Then I can do:\nAPP_ID=com.ubuntu.clock_clock_3.7.456 \\\nQML2_IMPORT_PATH=/usr/share/click/preinstalled/com.ubuntu.clock/3.7.456/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf \\\nQML_IMPORT_TRACE=1 \\\ngdb --args \\\n/usr/bin/qmlscene \\\n--desktop_file_hint=/usr/share/click/preinstalled/com.ubuntu.clock/3.7.456/share/applications/ubuntu-clock-app.desktop \\\n/usr/share/click/preinstalled/com.ubuntu.clock/3.7.456/share/qml/ubuntu-clock-app.qml\n\n... which will properly open gdb:\nGNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.9-1ubuntu1) 7.9\n...\nType \"apropos word\" to search for commands related to \"word\"...\nReading symbols from /usr/bin/qmlscene...(no debugging symbols found)...done.\n\n(but won't be of that much use in this example due to missing debugging symbols).\nHowever, besides these apps ran by qmlscene, there are seemingly also \"proper\" executables on Ubuntu Touch 15.03, such as the Browser app:\nphablet@ubuntu-phablet:~$ which webbrowser-app\n/usr/bin/webbrowser-app\nphablet@ubuntu-phablet:~$ file /usr/bin/webbrowser-app\n/usr/bin/webbrowser-app: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (GNU/Linux), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=c173774045b98a97e831eda92dd5008d08b9a251, stripped\n\n... but this kind I simply cannot get to run from the command line. Closest I got to (by analogy with above, and copying some environment variables that env ran on the Terminal app on the phone reported) is this:\nAPP_ID=webbrowser-app \\\nUNITY_MIR_SOCKET=/run/mir_socket \\\nMIR_SOCKET=/var/run/mir_socket \\\nMIR_SERVER_PROMPT_FILE=1 \\\nMIR_SERVER_NAME=session-0 \\\n/usr/bin/webbrowser-app \\\n--desktop_file_hint=/usr/share/applications/webbrowser-app.desktop\n\n... which however fails immediately in terminal with:\nLoading module: 'libubuntu_application_api_touch_mirclient.so.3.0.0'\nUbuntuClientIntegration: connection to Mir server failed. Check that a Mir server is\nrunning, and the correct socket is being used and is accessible. The shell may have\nrejected the incoming connection, so check its log file\nAborted\n\nWhat's more, all this business with --desktop_file_hint seems something required by Unity8 (i.e. Unity8 might inspect the app command line and look for it, even if the app itself doesn't use it) - but may be (or is) going away:\nubuntu-bugs - [Bug 1578319] [NEW] Some ubuntu-ui-toolkit AP tests failing to launch - rejected by unity8 as is using desktop_file_hint (2016-05)\n\n...is not using upstart-app-launch - which would explain the fail.\n  desktop_file_hint is not a supported means of launching an app (and can\n  go away at any time), so UITK should change to use UAL in its AP tests.\nThis indeed used to work until recently, but a recent refactoring broke\n  the desktop_file_hint behaviour. Since it's not a supported behaviour,\n  it should be relied on, so it would be better to fix UITK than restore\n  the old behaviour.\n\nOk, but then, how do I run executable files, possibly from non installed applications, with upstart-app-launch (i.e. ubuntu-app-launch) - and how would I run them in foreground in the terminal? I'm aware that, - just like Android has ndk-gdb, - the Ubuntu SDK has something similar via Qt Creator which apparently uses gdbserver on the device. However, I'd prefer not firing up a GUI for something like that - and in fact, would love to run gdb in the old-fashioned way, as described above, with an executable as argument on the command line.\nI guess a lot of this has to do with me not quite understanding init/Upstart, X11/Mir, Gnome/Unity etc differences that are applicable on a device vs. a (classic) desktop - and I cannot really tell what runs what. I'd love to have enough of it explained, so I can understand how running (GUI) Ubuntu Touch apps from a terminal command line would work.\n\nA: Well, I think I found something that explains some of the things I was wondering about - but I'd still love for someone to post a proper erudite answer, so I'm not going to accept this one for now...\nAnyways, the resource is:\nBug #1367871 “ubuntu-app-launch doesn't pass arguments to the executable” : Bugs : Ubuntu Application Launcher\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-app-launch/+bug/1367871 \n\nUAL isn't designed to run custom binaries how ever you'd like, it's designed to launch applications. An application is defined with a bunch of different metadata, but one of the key ones is a desktop file. That file defines how to launch the application and is what UAL decides to use for how to launch it. In this way the application can get launched in a consistent manner and is the same thing from device to device. [...]  \nThe tricky thing about app confinement, is that command line arguments and environment variables aren't really a good mix for it. An \"app\" is completely separate from the rest of the system, in the click package world. There are some hooks in click to set up symlinks or such, for other parts of the system to be able to easily find those apps, such as ubuntu-app-launch and the apps scope. But they are not command line applications, and you can't simply just run them from the command line with arbitrary configuration. \n\n\nA: I'm running Lubuntu, and I find that these work fine from a remote shell started with ssh -Y user@linuxbox:\nubuntu-app-launch \"qterminal\"    \nqterminal\n\nThe first launches qterminal in Quartz and doesn't need to ask my password\nThe second also launches qterminal but needs password\nI think the first is also running bash.

This time I decided to keep the license. I took advantage of the free upgrade to MS Windows 10 (I chose to do a clean installation from a USB disc so I could control the partitions on the SSD - I left enough space for a root partition). This installation worked fine.\nNext, I installed a HDD and proceeded with an Ubuntu 16.04 installation using a live USB.\nI partitioned the disks as follows (I got this from GParted after booting from the Ubuntu live USB):\n \n\nBasically I want: \n\n\n*\n\n*both OSs to boot from the SSD\n\n*Ubuntu to use the HDD for a nominal /home, swap partition and /tmp\n\n*a shared partition to which both Windows and Ubuntu can write to\n\n\nI have no idea why /dev/sdb3 and /dev/sdb4 have got \"msftdata\" flags.\nSecure Boot is enabled (I've read various posts - some say have it disabled when installing Ubuntu, some say you don't need to do that). Fast Boot is disabled.\nUbuntu installs as expected however, upon reboot (having removed the live USB disk) the machine boots only into Windows.\nI have checked the BIOS and there is no option to boot into anything other than the Windows Boot Manager (or the live USB disk when installed).\nefibootmgr reports:\nBootCurrent:0002 \nTimeout: 2 seconds  \nBootOrder: 0000,0002,0001 \nBoot0000* Windows Boot Manager  \nBoot0001 ubuntu \nBoot0002* UEFI: SanDisk\n\nI noticed that there is no asterisk next to Boot0001 implying that is not \"active\". I have tried setting that active and I have also tried changing the boot order so Boot0001 is first. I've even tried changing BootNext to 0001. None of these work. I did notice that changes to activate Boot0001 are reset on the next boot - so my changes are not being preserved.\nI read a number of posts which make number of recommendations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some say install Windows first, others say the reverse.\n\n*Install Grub again.\n\n*Repair the EFI bootloader entries either manually (by mounting the EFI partition and copying/renaming entries) or using Boot-Repair.\n\n\nI can't seem to attach a dump of the EFI partition, but here's a fragment:\n./EFI\n./EFI/Microsoft\n./EFI/Microsoft/Boot\n./EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bg-BG\n./EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bg-BG/bootmgfw.efi.mui\n./EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bg-BG/bootmgr.efi.mui\n./EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgr.efi\n./EFI/Microsoft/Boot/memtest.efi\n./EFI/Microsoft/Boot/boot.stl\n./EFI/OEM/Boot\n...\n./EFI/Microsoft/Boot/en-GB\n./EFI/Microsoft/Boot/en-GB/bootmgfw.efi.mui\n./EFI/Microsoft/Boot/en-GB/bootmgr.efi.mui\n...\n./EFI/OEM\n./EFI/OEM/Boot\n./EFI/OEM/Boot/boot.stl\n./EFI/OEM/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n./EFI/OEM/Boot/bootmgr.efi\n./EFI/OEM/Boot/memtest.efi\n./EFI/OEM/Boot/BOOTSTAT.DAT\n./EFI/OEM/Boot/BCD\n./EFI/OEM/Boot/BCD.LOG\n./EFI/OEM/Boot/BCD.LOG1\n./EFI/OEM/Boot/BCD.LOG2\n...\n./EFI/OEM/Boot/en-GB\n./EFI/OEM/Boot/en-GB/bootmgfw.efi.mui\n./EFI/OEM/Boot/en-GB/bootmgr.efi.mui\n...\n./EFI/ubuntu\n./EFI/ubuntu/fw\n./EFI/ubuntu/fwupx64.efi\n./EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi\n./EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg\n./EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi\n./EFI/ubuntu/MokManager.efi\n./OEM\n./OEM/AcerOA30.xml\n./OEM/Factory\n./OEM/Factory/AMIDEWINx64.exe\n./OEM/Factory/AMIFLDRV64.sys\n./OEM/Factory/CHK.bat\n./OEM/Factory/CHK_DK.bat\n./OEM/Factory/Delay-Diags.exe\n...\n\nI know I'm close to cracking this nut, so which of the above suggestions is likely to work?

When you look at the output of tlp -stat output you found the error message x86_energy_perf_policy: program for your kernel not installed.\nWhen you attempt to install the energy performance policy by sudo apt-get install linux-tools-generic the install appears to work but does not have any effect.\nI have looked at the code for x86_energy_perf_policy and I could see no issues with it. It does not appear to be kernel specific so it looks like x86_energy_perf_policy which is part of linux-tools-common is not linked into the kernel properly.\nThis will have a big effect on battery life for laptops with Intel CPUs since the default policy is to maximise performance at the expense of energy expenditure (and hence battery life).\nI may be wrong and x86_energy_perf_policy could be depreciated and TLP has yet to catch up but this looks like a serious kernel bug. I could attempt to patch your kernel to resolve this, but this issue will effect this and subsequent versions of the Linux kernel until it is resolved so I suggest you raise a bug by entering ubuntu-bug at a terminal. Feel free to paste parts of this answer into your bug report if this helps.\n\nA: To answer my own question, the problem was that in dual graphics system, the newer kernels would load both the power-saving and discreet GPU, whereas the default install kernel that came with 16.04 LTS would not, and subsequently the fan and battery would be drained more.\nThis could have been solved by creating and using a radeonoff script when booting, or simply, as I solved it, disabling the switichable graphics options in BIOS. Temporary solution, untilAMDGPU is more developed.\n", "Q: Which is the best git client for linux? I am moving out of a windows enviroment where i used Tortoise Git.

I'm a heavy user of Blender, but since I can't really script at all, it doesn't fullfill my needs completely. What I'm looking for specifically is an easy tool to design furniture, for example. The tools I need in the program, according to SketchUp, are: exact measurements, ability to draw an object simply by drawing edges in 3D space or at least in 2D, ability to scale, extrude and manipulate with verticies, edges and/or faces in real measurementunits, ability to create a segment in an existing object easily in specified location. For example if I know I want a window in wall, knowing it has to be 1 meter from the ground and 50 cm from the corner, I want an easy way to do that. \nWhat I don't need is calculating anything, running anything.

I have recently spent a lot of work and built my 14.04 ubuntu desktop to be \"perfect\" for me. Should I really do a distribution upgrade to 16.04, because I can? \nI am a newbie and do not want to lose any of my work. As I see it I am able to use 14.04 for three more years, so what is the hype about 16.04!?! I hope this question is not silly, because as I see it you should not upgrade unless you do not need to. \nThen why does Ubuntu have so many LTS distributions going on at the same time? Why not have a one at a time LTS to finishing with the next LTS?\n\nA: They support the previous LTS releases for the exact reason you mentioned in your question: people create a stable environment they want to keep. If an LTS was only supported for 2 years, there wouldn't be much advantage to an LTS, and people would have to upgrade all the time to continue to receive support. It's also helpful to businesses that may have software that only works on, say, 14.04.\nI feel like you've pretty much already answered your own question. You say you have every reason to stay with what you have and that you just want to upgrade for fun. Unless you have an actual reason for 16.04, don't risk the upgrade and potential hassles, inconveniences, bugs and breakages just \"because [you] can.\"\nTL;DR:\nDon't upgrade to 16.04 unless the need arises. You already have what you want. No need to ruin it.\n\nA: If you value stability of a system, then by all means stick with 14.04 for now. You can always install Virtual Box and try 16.04 LTS there, which is what I do. Sooner or later you have to face the fact that Ubuntu has switched to new init system, systemd as well as introduced new type of packaging format , snappy. You may want to start learning those slowly in Virtual Box without upgrading.

I'm thinking of using eCryptFS, but I wanted to know how much more disk space is used.\n\nA: I did some testing that indicated eCryptfs has a minimum file size of 12,288 bytes, and seemed to add about 8k to larger files (as Colin correctly says).\nFor example, a file that's 10,485,760 bytes ends up encrypted as 10,493,952 bytes, so increased by 8,192 bytes.\nNot significant for large files, but for lots of tiny files (like home configuration files usually are, or some other applications) the size could balloon significantly. Even a 1 byte file becomes 12,288 bytes.\n\nYou can just add a new user with sudo adduser --encrypt-home newguy then login (in a terminal if you don't want to log out of your regular user - sudo login) and experiment & compare the different file sizes yourself.\nEncrypted files are in /home/.ecryptfs/newguy/.Private/ and (when logged in) the decrypted versions are in /home/newguy/\n\neCryptFS has some quirks, like long filenames (over ~200 characters) may not work or be truncated, and file permissions may not work so well (chmod seems to report success, but ls keeps listing ----------.

Some information points to systemd.link, which is just wrong because Ubuntu (as of 16.04) does not use this part of systemd.\nActually, changing interface name works nearly like it used to, with two small differences: First, the file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules now has to be created manually. This has the advantage that you do not have to worry about any script overwriting this file and can simply add the lines that you need (you do not need any comments either). Second - and this is the change that cost me a lot of time to figure it out - the format changed slightly compared to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:\nThe line for fixing the interface name of the NIC with MAC address \"02:01:02:03:04:05\" to \"eth0\" is now:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTR{address}==\"02:01:02:03:04:05\", ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\", NAME=\"eth0\"\n\nThis line looks nearly the same as in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with one slight difference: In Ubuntu 14.04, there was the additional condition KERNEL==\"eth*\". For some reason, this does not work in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

I tried it and it worked just fine. \n\nA: In my case, I'm running Workstation 16.0 on Ubuntu 20.10, and I needed to enroll MOK keys using MOKutil before vmware-modconfig would complete successfully.\nThere's a comprehensive guide here: https://develmonk.com/2020/06/06/whats-wrong-with-vmware-workstation-on-ubuntu/\n", "Q: Using binfmt-misc in conjunction with xattrs I currently use a piece of sandboxing software on my 14.04 machine that isolates Linux binaries from one another (Using a special type of namespace isolation different than AppArmor)\nCurrently, the way to invoke the sandbox is like so:\n/usr/local/bin/sandbox /path/to/binary --optional-arguments\n\nMy problem is, I want to invoke certain arbitrary binaries and have them execute in the sandbox without having to prepend the /usr/local/bin/sandbox portion to my shell command. I.e.:\n/usr/local/bin/sandbox /path/to/binary --optional-arguments --> *new process*\n\nBecomes:\n/path/to/binary --optional-arguments --> *binfmt-misc* --> *new process*\n\nI figured that I could easily do this thanks to binfmt-misc, however after reading through the documentation it only seems to support requesting an interpreter through either magic bits in the file itself or through its file extension. As it is not feesable to do any of those things in this specific case, I looked for an option in binfmt-misc that could allow me to specify extended attributes on certain binaries that I want launched in the sandbox that binfmt-misc could then read and use to determine that these binaries must be run by the /usr/local/bin/sandbox \"interpreter.\" However, I have yet to find such a feature in it that would allow me to do so.\nIs there any way that I can achieve launching arbitrary ELF binaries with no extension compiled for the same architecture as my computer using the sandbox automatically?\n\nA: I don't know of a way to do this through binfmt-misc and xattrs, but I'll propose a different approach. I haven't tried it out but I can't see why it wouldn't work.\nThe idea is to use a union mount to hide the real binaries by a wrapper script that calls the sandbox. We need a union mount where the upper directory is mostly read and writes to a non-shadowed file go to the lower directory, which is not supported by all union mount systems.  In particular this rules out OverlayFS which is now built into the Linux kernel.\nWrite a generic wrapper script:\n#!/bin/sh\nexec /usr/local/bin/sandbox \"${0#/sandboxed}\" \"$@\"\n\nCreate a directory /sandbox and create a union mount that shadows the root filesystem. I'll use aufs (Ubuntu: aufs-tools), which unfortunately has recently been abandoned; there may be a better choice.\nmount -t aufs -o br:/,br:/sandbox aufs-sandbox /\n\nFor each executable that you want to sandbox, link /sandbox/path/to/foo to the wrapper script (after creating the necessary directories /path/to under /sandbox).\n", "Q: Keyboard and Touchpad wont work I'm using a gigabyte P17F laptop and every time I install ubuntu the touchpad and keyboard stop working, \nI have installed ubuntu 16.04 with a usb keyboard and mouse, sometimes the laptop's keyboard and mouse work, if I open the onboard keyboard in ubuntu and press the caps lock button on the screen it usually fixes the keyboard but not the touchpad, sometimes it also just repeats a random key until I press the key on the keyboard.\nI know it must be software because the machine boots into Windows and the problem is not there.\nHelp me obi one kenobi, you're my only hope!\n\nA: I had similar problems with the integrated keyboard and touchpad freezing randomly.

I tried also via eSATA, but hdparm is not working as well (tried couple different settings) and drives spins-up immediately after going to spin-down, so it's even worse...\nI think that this 5-minute timer is related to enclosure itself, not OS.\nI wrote I simple workaround script that performs an operation on a file to reset countdown:\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /media/my/drive/.alive\nwhile (true); do\n    truncate -s 0 dummy\n    sleep 270 # 4:30\ndone\n\n(dir or ls does not reset the countown, seems like those are reading from cache)\nI don't mind running another terminal, that's even better, I can shut it down whenever I want and drives will then spin-down.\nHowever I would like to know if there's a better way ? Something that does not write anything on a drive (like modifying file), but just sending simple \"keep-alive\" signal ?\n\nA: Not sure if it will work for you but you can try opening terminal and typing\ngsku gnome-disks &\n\nor I guess if you don't have gksu you can type \nsudo gnome-disks &\n\nThen select the external drive and click the icon in the right top that looks like three vertical lines and choose Drive Settings You can set the standby timeouts there ... again not sure if this will work for your situation but its worth a try :D It may have the same issue because of it being an external HD though  so not sure it will work but I can't test  it myself because I don't have the availability of an external HD\nif you don't have gnome-disks installed you can install it by using\nsudo apt-get install gnome-disk-utility\n\n\nA: The problem with hdparm appears to most likely be your implementation of hdparm as hdparm does normally control external drives connected via USB.\nIt is however, quite common for hdparm to ignore spindown settings. Miany times, is rnecessary to find which setting  is honored or accepted by your hardware.\nAn apm setting of 255 is supposed to disable spindown altogether, however, many systems require you use 254 instead. \nIf this still does not work, please post your hdparm configuration and any related error\n", "Q: How to remotely access website in my virtual machine? I have installed VirtualBox and a guest machine with Ubuntu.\nFrom my host Ubuntu, I can browse to 192.168.56.10 and see webpages inside my guest Ubuntu server (and I can ssh user@192.168.56.10 into my guest machine, too)\nNow my question is:\nHow to remotely access this website which resides inside my guest machine?\nguest static ip: 192.168.56.10\nhost static Internet ip: 11.11.11.11 (I do have static Internet IP, but this only as example)\nI want to be able to browse to http://11.11.11.11 from any computer and visit that page inside my virtual machine\n\nA: In your router forward port 80 and 443 to 192.168.56.10 \nThen when an external request hits port 80 or 443 http https it will be routed to the VM guest machine at 192.168.56.10\nThis may only work if your default gateway is 192.168.56.1 or you may have to change the static address on the guest so matches the gateway .. for instance if your default gateway was 192.168.1.1 then you would need a static IP in the guest as 192.168.1.xxx .. for the easiest setup\nJust as an added note that I was just reminded of .. this setup I use myself but I use a bridged connection in VirtualBox not the default NAT connection and now that I look at it, the above IP is most likely a NAT connection in Vbox\n\nA: You should use port forwarding capabilities of virtualbox. You'll find this settings on the adapter properties of your VM. Forwarding 80 and 443 should be enough.\nSee virtualbox manual here for more details: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#natforward\nI assumed that your host has a static public IP. If it's not the case, as said john, you will need to forward those ports on your router too.\n\nA: Actually I did not need to do anything.\nFrom my configurations in the my question above, I just needed to know the IP address of my virtual machine, then from any computer connected to my physical network I can just type that address the web browser.\nI used ip addr show, it spit number of IPs, one is the static ip with my host ip. The other one from the bridged adapter interface (which was the one used by other PCs in my network).\n", "Q: Upgrade from ubuntu 15.10 to 16.04 is stuck I have been running the upgrade from 15.10 to 16.04 for 10 hours now and it is stuck on the following screen:\n\nAlso, I can not open the terminal to with the small arrow to see what is going on.

Another answer to your question is to switch to a different base, like Arch.\nThat said, you should reconsider NEON. You might appreciate the following discussion:\nhttps://www.kubuntuforums.net/showthread.php?69621-KDE-neon&highlight=NEON\nAnd consult this link for installation:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2318147 \n(Though this too is outdated, see below):\nThere are three repos, two of which are GIT based -- stable & unstable.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://archive.neon.kde.org/stable\n\n*http://archive.neon.kde.org/unstable\n\n*http://archive.neon.kde.org/user\nYou and I, it sounds like, will both want to use user. If you're like me, all of the reviews and comments you've read concerning NEON's stability were probably based on 15.10 and are outdated. Currently, NEON is advising against adding their REPO to Kubuntu. However, based on the conversation linked above, good results have been had and the systems are stable. That said, this Jujutsu is for the Linux user comfortable with tty or the command line (in the event of an emergency). \nOf course, the simplest thing to do is install the USER edition of NEON.

It works and I'm aware of the bug making it impossible to install third party software from within the software center. So far I had no problem installing those packages using the terminal with the dpkg command. But now I'm stuck... I want to install VirtualBox so that I can continue a pen testing course and we use Kali Linux in a virtual machine for our practicing and experiments. Are there any one else having this problem? Are there anyone else having a fix for it?\nThe problem is that VirtualBox gives an error about not being able to start the kernel driver. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, I tried to reinstall the dkms package (I'm not sure if it is dkms - but at least something close to it). So, it boils down to being able to install virtual box but not being able to start a virtual machine.\n\nA: If you want to use VirtualBox on *buntus, the best practice is to use Oracle's server and install it from there instead of using the one in the repos.\nSo, you should uninstall everything concerning VirtualBox that you've installed from the repos except for dkms.  dkms is the only thing you must install prior to installing VirtualBox.\nYou need to follow the instructions on putting the Oracle server on your system, here: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads\nThere is a 16.04 specific section that tells you exactly what to do with the keys.\nAfter you install it successfully, you need to install the VirtualBox Extension pack which is available on this page: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\nGood luck!\n\nA: i had the same issue yesterday but i fixed by disable secure boot then run:\nsudo /sbin/rcvboxdrv setup\n\n\nA: Install it through synaptic package manager.

When closing the lid of my notebook or going to hybernate and waking up my Ubuntu Mate 16.04 machine, the nm-applet shows, that I am offline.\nDifferent from the linked question above, I am not offline, I am online, but it just shows that I am offline. \nRestarting the network-manager service helped sometimes. \nAnyways currently this does not seem to have an effect anymore. It is annoying because some applications like evolution appear to share the same source for determining the online status than the nm-applet. That means, that in this state I can not check my e-mails but browse the web.\nHow can I ensure that after waking up the machine from hibernate the wireless network connection is established well and identified as established?\n\nA: I’m not 100% convinced this is a 16.04 issue as this has recently resurfaced for me on 14.04.4. For me sudo nmcli nm sleep false wakes up network manager.\nI know I’ve had this problem before as I had a script with the above command, but I can’t remember if I found a solution or it was just fixed somewhere along the way.\n\nA: I had wicd and Networkmanager installed. Uninstalling wicd, together with implementing the solutions from the above linked question, solved my problem.\nIt seems as if both wicd and the network managing routines of gnome try to connect to my wifi when I am disconnected. The wicd routines are usually quicker and than the gnome ones do not recognize that I am online, which leads to confusion in other programs, like evolution.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Start Terminal on Active Screen I'm currently working off Ubuntu 14.04 on two separate screens.\nWhen I use the keyboard shortcut to start the terminal, Ctrl+Alt+T, the terminal is currently defaulted to open on the screen on the left, even if the screen I'm working on is the one on the left.\nThis issue applies to gnome-terminal only\nI'm wondering is there any way to set the terminal to launch in whichever screen is currently active?\nThanks.\n\nA: How to make a new terminal window, initiated by Ctrl+Alt+T open on the currently active screen?\nAlthough Very much related to this one, not a dupe, and it requires a completely different solution.

But a clean install of 16.04 ignored the lid action.  According to with-ubuntu-16-04-laptop-doesnt-suspend-when-lid-is-closed (which I can't post on) there's a kernel bug fixed in version 4.4.8 whereas 16.04 has just shipped with 4.4.0. Everything else works so I decided to try to fix it with the existing kernel. Following instructions on laptop-does-not-suspend-when-lid-is-closed was helpful but outdated and caused wifi to fail to reconnect on resume. What's the best way to cause a lid close event to enter suspend mode?\n\nA: To get ACPI to perform suspend create /etc/acpi/events/lidbtn and /etc/acpi/lidbtn.sh as below.\nsudo sh\n\ncat <<. >/etc/acpi/lidbtn.sh\n#!/bin/sh\n# Initiate suspend mode when the lid has been closed.\n\n# Only act on a lid close event\nif grep -q open /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID0/state\nthen\n    dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.login1 /org/freedesktop/login1 \"org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.Suspend\" boolean:true\nfi\n.\n\ncat <<. >/etc/acpi/events/lidbtn\n# Laptop lid event triggered.

I am using MonoDevelop, which is quite decent IDE. I have problems when debugging because watching variable does not always work, but other than that it works as expected.\nRegarding WPF, I believe you cannot do it in Linux. You must be aware that Mono, which works great in Linux, is a subset of .NET and will probably never support everything that is available in Windows. I was surprised that so many things work, which I didn't expect too. Take a look here for WPF: http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/wpf/.\n\nA: For Linux you can use Avalonia UI Framework which is not the same thing but similar. Mono has no plan for adopting WPF or UWP. C# do support OpenTK(OpenGL) or Gtk#(GUI) through wrappers. WinForms is supported in Mono.\nYou may even try WINE given valve/steam tried so hard to bring there games to Linux and instead settled with Proton which is technically WINE for games.

Here is information about the -fuzz value:\n\n-fuzz distance{%}\nColors within this distance are considered equal.\nA number of algorithms search for a target color.

For example, if you want to automagically trim the edges of an image with -trim but the image was scanned and the target background color may differ by a small amount. This option can account for these differences.\nThe distance can be in absolute intensity units or, by appending % as a percentage of the maximum possible intensity (255, 65535, or 4294967295).\nUse +fuzz to reset the fuzz value to 0.\n\nPlease let me know if this answer was helpful, or if you have other questions or need clarification.\n", "Q: Huge elements on secondary monitor with lower resolution Ubuntu 16.04 installed on ASUS UX305 ultrabook with QHD resolution (3200x1800) of built-in display.\nConnecting secondary monitor Dell 24\" with 1920x1200 resolution over HDMI I am getting huge control elements on it.\nScaling in \"All settings-Displays\" doesn't help.\nNote: Built-in is scaled to 2 as it's the only way to make it readable and convenient look.\nHow to get external monitor scaled independently from main built-in?\n\nA: As far as I know the only relatively easy way to get independent scaling between monitor and built-in display is to use the Wayland windows system (instead of the current Xorg).\nThis is available in Ubuntu 18.04, although Xorg window system is the default, you can switch at the login screen \nThen in your 'Display Settings' you can set 200% for the built-in display and 100% for the monitor.\nBut there are still major issues. I have created a separate question with the issues I found when using Wayland. Currently only the terminal windows and file explorer windows handle the separate scaling properly.

From the Debian Policy Manual:\n\nIf a relationship field has a version number attached, only real\n  packages will be considered to see whether the relationship is\n  satisfied (or the prohibition violated, for a conflict or breakage).\n  In other words, if a version number is specified, this is a request to\n  ignore all Provides for that package name and consider only real\n  packages. The package manager will assume that a package providing\n  that virtual package is not of the \"right\" version. A Provides field\n  may not contain version numbers, and the version number of the\n  concrete package which provides a particular virtual package will not\n  be considered when considering a dependency on or conflict with the\n  virtual package name.\n\nOne way out is to create minimal packages for each of the provided packages, which just depend on your actual snmp package (transitional packages). They'll be of a higher version and preferred automatically.\n", "Q: MongoDB installation failed on Ubuntu 16.04 I followed instructions given on the official MongoDB website (https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/) and I get this error when trying to install MongoDB.

Get the Deb from here (source - it's also linked in the question), no it won't be automatically updated but since it's no longer supported (and Ubuntu can't patch security vulnerabilities for it in Ubuntu 12.04 anyway because it's proprietary) that doesn't matter. There's less of a chance you'll ruin your system if you get it this way.\nIf you can't find/run Adobe Reader, you will need to run sudo apt -f install to resolve dependencies. If it still doesn't work, try sudo apt install libxml2:i386.\nThis is, of course, a very outdated version of Adobe Reader, but this is not Ubuntu's fault, Adobe haven't updated the Linux client of Adobe Reader. You can, however, get a newer version using the process below (this installs a Windows version of Adobe Reader on Ubuntu).\nFor Adobe Acrobat Reader DC (running with Wine)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install PlayOnLinux (as of 22 December 2018 you must get it this way, and not through Ubuntu Software, to ensure that you have the Wine version required to install Adobe Acrobat Reader DC)\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl + Alt + T\n\n*Type sudo apt install wine:i386, press  Enter , type your password,  Enter , then type Y (when prompted), and  Enter \n\n*Click on the link above\n\n*Click 'Ubuntu'\n\n*For your Ubuntu version (to find that out, type lsb_release -a into Terminal and press Enter, look at the text next to codename), select the first line to be put into Terminal, press Ctrl + C then switch back to the Terminal, press Ctrl + Shift + V and press Enter. Follow the prompts in Terminal, do that for each of the four lines for your Ubuntu version.\n\n\n*Load PlayOnLinux (press Super, type PlayOnLinux, press Enter)\n\n*Click 'Install' (in the toolbar)\n\n*Type 'Adobe Acrobat Reader DC' in the search bar\n\n*Click 'Adobe Acrobat Reader DC'\n\n*Click 'Install' (bottom-right)\n\n*Follow the install screens\n\n*Once installed, click 'Adobe Acrobat Reader DC'\n\n*Click 'Run' (in the toolbar)\n\n\nYou'll need to open PlayOnLinux to run Adobe Reader DC each time (note that you can have this installed alongside Adobe Reader 9.5.5). You can drag the desktop file into the Launcher to get a button there, you can also add an icon for it in the Ubuntu Dash using alacarte ('Main Menu'). I might add instructions for that later (seems unlikely given that I wrote that over two years ago!).\n\nA: You can still use its latest version \"Adobe Acrobat Reader DC\" along with wine although Adobe discontinued their PDF reader software for Linux several years ago. It works perfect for me.\nFirst install wine and winetricks\nsudo apt install wine-stable winetricks\n\nPrepare wine to receive Acrobat Reader DC installation:\nwinetricks mspatcha\n\nDownload the latest version of Adobe Reader for Windows 10 from official site http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/otherversions/\nA file with extension exe will be downloaded.

(Adobe Reader DC runs in protected mode by default to provide an added layer of security) \nAccept Licence.\nNow you can open your files using Acrobat Reader DC even on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Adobe Acrobat Reader DC can be installed in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu by installing the acrordrdc snap package. The acrordrdc snap package downloads a proprietary Windows version of Adobe Acrobat Reader and installs it with Wine.\n\n*\n\n*Install the acrordrdc snap package.\nsudo snap install acrordrdc\n\n\n\n*Launch acrordrdc.\nacrordrdc\n\n\n\n*Configuring messages will be shown in the terminal while Wine is configuring for Adobe Reader. Wait for Wine to finish configuring for Adobe Reader. After Wine is finished configuring you will see a red Adobe Reader icon in the Dock and this window will open.\n\n\n\n*Select a language for installer download from the dropdown menu and click the Install button in the Adobe Acrobat Reader DC window. A small progress bar window will open to show the progress of downloading Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.\n\n\n*Launch Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. A red Adobe Reader icon will appear in the Dock when Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is open.\nacrordrdc\n\n\n\n*You may need to disable Protected Mode to open Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.\n\n\n\n*Press the accept button to accept the Adobe Acrobat Reader DC License Agreement and continue.\n\n\n\n*You can auto-fill forms if you sign in to Adobe Acrobat Reader DC as shown in the upper right corner of the below screenshot.\n\n\n\n*My current version of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is 21.007.20091.59174, the latest version. You may have to reinstall the acrordrdc snap package if you upgrade your Ubuntu release to ensure that it is compatible with your upgraded operating system.\n\n\nA: Yes there is, but the support has been dropped. Check this out and follow instructions to install:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open up terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T on keyboard. When it opens, paste the command below and hit enter to add the repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ precise partner\"\n\nType in your user password when it asks. Note that there’s no visual feed back when you typing a password.\n  \n*After you added the repository, update package lists and install the acroread package by running below commands one by one:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install acroread\n\nOnce installed, you should be able to open it from Unity dash or Application menu.\n  \n*After properly installed Adobe Reader, don’t forget to remove the Canonical Partners repository for Precise:\nsudo add-apt-repository -r \"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ precise partner\"\nsudo apt-get update\n\n  \n*How to Set Adobe Reader as default PDF reader:\nRun command below in terminal to edit the config file:\n    sudo gedit /etc/gnome/defaults.list\n\nWhen the file opens, do:\nFind out and change the line\napplication/pdf=evince.desktop\n\ninto:\napplication/pdf=acroread.desktop\n\nAdd below line into the end:\napplication/fdf=acroread.desktop\napplication/xdp=acroread.desktop\napplication/xfdf=acroread.desktop\napplication/pdx=acroread.desktop\n\nFinally save the file and restart nautilus (run command nautilus -q in terminal) to apply changes.\n\n\nA: You should just be able to download the .deb from here: ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/unix/9.x/9.5.5/enu/AdbeRdr9.5.5-1_i386linux_enu.deb\nand install it by opening the file.

It took a while to open the first time I ran it.\nWhen I most recently installed it on Ubuntu 16.04, I got a few errors:\nlibxml2.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nand\nGtk-Message: Failed to load module \"canberra-gtk-module\"\nI fixed these with\nsudo apt-get install libxml2:i386 libstdc++6:i386 (command obtained from here)\nand\nsudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module:i386 (command obtained from here)\nApparently, there can be another error related to adobereader-enu:i386; run:\nsudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nThe apt-get -f install is for fixing broken dependencies if there are any.\nThen install the .deb file again and you should be sorted.\n\nA: I followed the tips below on Kubuntu 16.04 64 bit:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ precise partner\"\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt install adobereader-enu\n\nAfter properly installed Adobe Reader, don’t forget to remove the Canonical Partners repository for Precise:\nsudo add-apt-repository -r \"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ precise partner\"\nsudo apt update\n\n\nA: I found that:\nsudo apt install adoberead-enu\n\n...throws an error to the effect that it could not find the package\nadoberead-enu. However when I did:\nsudo apt install adoberead-bin:i386\n\n...it worked, and the result seems to be a working Adobe Reader.\nI am using Ubuntu 16.04.\n", "Q: How to restore Xfce default panel colors? I would like to restore the default panel colors. \nI had recently installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and then Xfce 4.12. Xfce brought a dark task bar, I think. \nI experimented with the 3 themes from Ubuntu (Adwaita, Ambience, Radiance) but I would like to go back to the Xfce default. Unfortunately, I don't know how to do that. \nI tried to delete the contents of ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/ (which was empty), and ~/.config/xfce4/panel didn't even exist. I also reinstalled Xfce, but Radiance is still showing up. Also, the icons appear to have changed. \nThe initial settings are not available as a theme. Is there another way to fix this?\n\nA: Go to the xfce settings manager.  In your menu simply search for \"Settings Manger\".  NB: not Settings Editor.  Then go to Appearance, and select Greybird.  Go to the icons tab and select 'elementary Xfce dark.'  For fonts, your default should be Noto Sans, size 9.\nIf you want to reset everything in Xfce to default, instead of doing an apt-get remove, do an apt-get purge.  That will clean up your configuration files as well as uninstalling.  Then reinstall.\nEdit:\nInstall the Greybird with the following:\ncd ~\nmkdir .icons\nmkdir .themes\ncd .icons\nwget https://github.com/shimmerproject/elementary-xfce/archive/master.zip\nunzip master.zip\nmv elementary*/* .\ncd ../.themes\nwget https://github.com/shimmerproject/Greybird/archive/master.zip\nunzip master.zip\nsudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-murrine gtk3-engines-unico\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 black screen I'm using Ubuntu 14.04, when I started my pc today, it shows a black screen and then nothing, on safe mode, in /var/log/boot.log I have 2 fails :\n*Starting Track if upstart is running in a container [fail]\n*Starting rpcsec_gss daemon [fail]\n\nHow to solve it please ?\n\nA: Solved, by uninstalling ldap client.\n", "Q: How to find files that do not have a duplicate in a separate directory I have an old backup of documents. In my current Documents directory, a lot of these files exist in different locations with different names. I'm trying to find a way to show which files exist in the backup that do not exist in the Documents directory, preferably nice and GUI-y so that I can easily overview a lot of documents.\nWhen I search for this question, a lot of people are looking for ways to do the opposite. There are tools like FSlint and DupeGuru, but they show duplicates. There is no invert mode.\n\nA: If you are ready to use CLI, the following command should work for you:\ndiff --brief -r backup/ documents/\n\nThis will show you the files that are unique to each folder. If you want you can also ignore filename cases with the --ignore-file-name-case\nAs an example:\nron@ron:~/test$ ls backup/\nfile1  file2  file3  file4  file5\nron@ron:~/test$ ls documents/\nfile4  file5  file6  file7  file8\nron@ron:~/test$ diff backup/ documents/\nOnly in backup/: file1\nOnly in backup/: file2\nOnly in backup/: file3\nOnly in documents/: file6\nOnly in documents/: file7\nOnly in documents/: file8\nron@ron:~/test$ diff backup/ documents/ | grep \"Only in backup\"\nOnly in backup/: file1\nOnly in backup/: file2\nOnly in backup/: file3\n\nIn addition, if you want to report only when the files differ (and not report the actual 'difference'), you can use the --brief option as in:\nron@ron:~/test$ cat backup/file5 \none\nron@ron:~/test$ cat documents/file5\nron@ron:~/test$ diff --brief backup/ documents/\nOnly in backup/: file1\nOnly in backup/: file2\nOnly in backup/: file3\nFiles backup/file5 and documents/file5 differ\nOnly in documents/: file6\nOnly in documents/: file7\nOnly in documents/: file8\n\nThere are several visual diff tools such as meld that can do the same thing. You can install meld from the universe repository by:\nsudo apt-get install meld\n\nand use its \"Directory comparison\" option. Select the folder you want to compare. After selection you can compare them side-by-side:\n\nfdupes is an excellent program to find the duplicate files but it does not list the non-duplicate files, which is what you are looking for. However, we can list the files that are not in the fdupes output using a combination of find and grep. \nThe following example lists the files that are unique to backup.\nron@ron:~$ tree backup/ documents/\nbackup/\n├── crontab\n├── dir1\n│   └── du.txt\n├── lo.txt\n├── ls.txt\n├── lu.txt\n└── notes.txt\ndocuments/\n├── du.txt\n├── lo-renamed.txt\n├── ls.txt\n└── lu.txt\n\n1 directory, 10 files\nron@ron:~$ fdupes -r backup/ documents/ > dup.txt\nron@ron:~$ find backup/ -type f | grep -Fxvf dup.txt \nbackup/crontab\nbackup/notes.txt\n\n\nA: I figured that the best workflow to merge old backups with thousands of files, archived under different directories with different names is to use DupeGuru after all. It looks a lot like the duplicates tab from FSlint, but it has the extra important feature of adding sources as 'reference'.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add your target directory (e.g. ~/Documents) as a reference.\n\n\n*\n\n*A reference is read-only and no files will be removed\n\n\n*Add your backup directory as normal.\n\n*Find duplicates. Remove all duplicates that are found from the backup.\n\n*You are left with only unique files in the backup directory. Use FreeFileSync or Meld to merge these, or merge manually.\n\n\nIf you have multiple old backup directories, it makes sense to merge the newest backup directory like this first, and then use this backup directory as a reference to clean it's duplicates from the older backups before merging them to the main document directory. This safes a lot of work where you don't have to remove unique files that you want to trash in stead of merge from the backups.\nRemember to make a fresh backup after you've destroyed all old backups in the process. :)\n\nA: I had the same problem with a lot of very large files and there are a lot of solutions for duplicates but not for invert search, and I also did not want to search for content diffs because of the large amount of data.\nSo I wrote this python script to search for \"isolated-files\"\nisolated-files.py --source folder1 --target folder2\n\nthis will show any files (recursively) within folder2 which are not in folder1 (also recursively). Can also be used on ssh connections and with multiple folders.\nsee https://github.com/ezzra/isolated-files\n", "Q: Problems with Netflix in new Google Chrome I've been watching Netflix in Google Chrome for months without any problem.

They simply cease, which is consistent with the idea of a freeze.\n\n\n*The Laptop is on, the HDMI dongle is then plugged in, the secondary screen works, but there is a log output that looks terrible. \nI wanted to paste it here, but it's refusing to format nicely. It's a kernel trace, with the ---cut here--- bits inserted.\n\n*The Laptop is off, the HDMI is plugged in, and the laptop is turned on.\n\n\n*\n\n*The 2nd display works as expected. Screen modes can be changed with no issues in the log\n\n*If the HDMI is re-plugged however, the above 2 scenarios reign.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure where this should be, maybe as a bug report?\nAny help, direction would be useful.\n\nA: I was experiencing exactly the same problem with my Zenbook UX305UA...until today. This was a very annoying problem since it only has mini-HDMI output.\nThe external monitor/tv/projector was only working if the laptop was turned on with the cable already plugged, but was freezing if connecting the cable once the system was running. Only hard power off could restart the system. \nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 (64bits). (could not update to 16.04 for compatibility issues at work). I've tried different kernels... (http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/)\nIn the end, installing the latest kernel v4.6-rc7-wily has finally solved the problem.\nCheck also my previous answer in (https://askubuntu.com/a/750218/523046) to solve graphics issues on this laptop.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: How to Setup Axis Points in g3data of 16.04's apt-get?

If so how?   PDf files are increasingly being infected with some type of malware and I'm hoping that snap apps will help prevent this.\nThanks\n\nA: Good question. The short answer to your question is yes, you could snap up evince (or similar). The longer answer is: as long as there's an insecure protocol involved, you will be at risk. Remember that on the current desktop, even if using a Snap package, if it has a GUI it has to be using X11, which is an inherently insecure protocol. So while packaging the PDF viewer as a snap would likely be helpful in defeating some attacks, it won't be a perfect solution until Ubuntu moves away from X (to Mir, presumably).\n", "Q: External monitor not working properly on Ubuntu 16.04 I recently upgraded my laptop from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04, and now I'm having trouble with my external Dell Ultrasharp monitor that is plugged in via DisplayPort.\nThe monitor will only work correctly if it is plugged in from boot, and even then it sometimes takes a (couple of) cycles of windows+p to get it on. If the monitor is plugged in after booting, it usually will not work. Ubuntu recognizes the monitor and thinks it is displaying (I can move my mouse there), but the monitor will stay black.\nThings get worse when I start up KODI media center, because then both the built-in laptop screen and the monitor go black. The only way to resolve it is plugging out the external monitor, and then the built-in display will turn back on. If I exit KODI I can replug my monitor and it will work again, but as long as KODI is running (even minimized) I have to disconnect the monitor. \nI have an ATI/AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5730 graphics card, but did not use the proprietary drivers before the upgrade and had no problems with the open source ones.\nAny idea what is going on and how I can solve this?

You should see a temperature reading from your Radeon card now.\n\n\nThe above method worked for my Radeon card.\nI think the issue is due to Linux kernel having DPM (Dynamic Power Management) turned on for Radeon cards. This makes sense, as you wouldn't want your discrete GPU to be turned on all the time and consuming power.\n", "Q: What's this bash plugin?

Both monitors are identical (Philips 274E). One is attached via HDMI and the other is via VGA.\nI have a strange situation where after a couple of hours use, the mouse cursor on the VGA monitor changes to what looks like 5 dots with downwards pointing arrows beside them (see this picture). I had to take a photo with my phone as when I took a screen shot that includes the pointer, it showed as a normal pointer icon. I've no idea exactly what causes it to change.\nAnyone any idea how I can fix this without having to restart the computer (which fixes it)?\nEdit 1: Well today the mouse icon on the HDMI monitor changed while the VGA monitor is fine. I have another question here that appears to be related to this issue but unusually, the system has not slowed down when the HDMI icon changed. No idea what's going on but it appears to be related to the AMD graphics driver\nEdit 2: I'm finding the only solution is to change to the Xorg driver, restart the machine, change back to fglrx and restart the machine. If I don't do this then when I restart the machine I get these awful blocky graphics. I'm putting the issue down to AMD's buggy proprietory driver fglrx. Very frustrating. Might have to start using a different machine with the dual monitors\n\nA: The solution is to move the mouse pointer between the two monitors repeatedly till this weird looking pointer is gone . Usually, within 2-6 quick transitions of mouse pointer between the monitor fixes it. And, no need to restart the computer.  It is in fact related to the buggy AMD driver.\nPS- Some nVidia drivers also have shown such behavior.\nThis behavior has also been observed in Windows platform and other OSs.\n\nA: To sort this issue (and the related issue in this question), I re-installed Ubuntu 14.04. When I did this, the open source graphics driver automatically recognised the dual monitors and the laptop has been working like a dream since.\nI guess the problem was with the proprietary AMD drivers which seem to be buggy as hell.\nThanks to all for the assistance\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 live CD not accepting password for wifi - Ralink RT3290 Ubuntu 16.04 live CD is not accepting wifi password for the WPA2 wifi network.

Your files will be safe, however, it's always a must to backup your data before doing any operation with your partitions.  A wrong key stroke could be disastrous. \nIf you don't have space behind your Ubuntu partition, and you have another partition there, you'll need to use a 3rd party application which will let you shrink and grow your partitions.\nI've used EaseUs Partition Manager on windows servers before with good success.

I managed to delete my only user from sudoers group, and now I can't do any administrative tasks anymore. I have been looking for an answer hours, and I guess that part of the problem is solved.

Can anyone explain why this process is made so fiendishly complicated compared to Windows?\nAnd No, I am not a beginner, but have used computers since their commercial infancy and also create my own websites and programme databases. I simply cannot understand why Linux programmers cannot come up with something more standard and understandable. Linux has so much going for it, but this critical area is enough to put off anyone but an expert. Is there some technical reason why it can't be simplified?\n\nA: As @Brian already said, a .tar.gz is like a .zip file - just a compression.\n.tar.gz (or any .tar.*) is a source code archive - you must compile it:\n(In the Terminal)\n\n\n*\n\n*Extract it. (tar xvf filename.tar.gz)\n\n*Change into the directory: (cd filename/)\n\n*If there is a file called autogen or auotogen.sh, run it.\n\n*If there is a file called configure.sh, run it.\n\n*Run make.\n\n*Run sudo make install.\nLook at the project's documentation (install documentation found usually in a README file, probably included with the source code. This is because they may require additional things to be installed before compilation. They (or Ubuntu, or a PPA maintainer) may even provide a fully-built package.\nP.S. If you install such source-only packages frequently, you may consider putting my bash function in your ~/.bashrc file. Then you can just run compile filename.tar.gz.\nP.P.S. I assure you, installing .tar.gz sources in Windows is much, much more complicated.\n\nA: Well, firstly, I don't think it's overly difficult to install applications in linux.\nIf you're simply trying to install a popular application in Ubuntu, you can use package management in your the graphical user interface.  There are many to pick from.  It really can't get any easier.  Find the application and click install...\nWhen it comes to the prompt, once again, it's very easy to install, 'sudo apt-get install application-name'. \nIf you're trying to compile something from source, which is what I am assuming you're meaning in your \"tar.gz\" statement.  You ./configure ; make ; make install.  Keep in mind, .tar.gz is simply a compression, it's like saying install a .zip in windows.  The zip itself isn't the application, it just contains the application.  You could have a .tar.gz compress an install package.  You would decompress the .tar.gz and then run something like start.sh to install an already compiled binary, which would be similar to 'installing'.  Which is just a simple process of moving files, and linking them to dependencies, etc..\nOnce again, I don't find it hard to install any application using a GUI, whether it's windows or ubuntu.  However, if you're talking about compiling an application from source code, it's not really simply 'installing' and you're in a different league than windows.  In fact, windows out of the box can't compile.  It requires applications to be already compiled, and be shipped with the dependencies.\n", "Q: problem during installing multi2sim simulator I'am new to ubuntu and when I'am trying to install multi2sim I get this error:  \n\nCXX      WorkItemIsa.o\nWorkItemIsa.cc: In member function ‘void SI::WorkItem::ISA_V_CVT_I32_F32_Impl(SI::Instruction*)’:\nWorkItemIsa.cc:2335:23: error: ‘isnan’ was not declared in this scope\n  else if (isnan(fvalue) || fvalue == 0.0f || fvalue == -0.0f)\n                       ^\nWorkItemIsa.cc:2335:23: note: suggested alternative:\nIn file included from WorkItemIsa.cc:22:0:\n/usr/include/c++/5/cmath:641:5: note:   ‘std::isnan’\n     isnan(_Tp __x)\n     ^\nMakefile:456: recipe for target 'WorkItemIsa.o' failed\nmake[4]: *** [WorkItemIsa.o] Error 1\nmake[4]: Leaving directory '/home/yasmine/Downloads/multi2sim-5.0/src/arch/southern-islands/emulator'\nMakefile:360: recipe for target 'all-recursive' failed\nmake[3]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\nmake[3]: Leaving directory '/home/yasmine/Downloads/multi2sim-5.0/src/arch/southern-islands'\nMakefile:363: recipe for target 'all-recursive' failed\nmake[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\nmake[2]: Leaving directory '/home/yasmine/Downloads/multi2sim-5.0/src/arch'\nMakefile:568: recipe for target 'all-recursive' failed\nmake[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory '/home/yasmine/Downloads/multi2sim-5.0/src'\nMakefile:570: recipe for target 'all-recursive' failed\nmake: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\n\nI don't know what should I do or how can I solve it !!\nCan anyone familiar with this simulator help me ?! \n\nA: Just find this line:\nelse if (isnan(fvalue) || fvalue == 0.0f || fvalue == -0.0f)\nthat is inside the /multi2sim5.0/scr/arch/southern-islands/emulator/WorkItemIsa.cc file.\nAnd add std:: before isnan.

I figured the best way to install Windows then would be to boot Ubuntu from a flash drive, download Windows from there, and then install it onto the SSD. However, I encountered problems with the storage space on the flash drive(s) I was using, and accidentally ended up installing Ubuntu onto the SSD.\nNow I have a bootable Windows OS on my flash drive, but cannot install it as the SSD is not formatted correctly.

This will give you a big unallocated space where you can install windows.\nThere is no need to care about partitioning tables (i.e GPT or MBR). Windows installation will take care of it.\nNote: This image is just for showing the option of deleting a partition. Your actual partition size will be different. It will have a efi or system reserved partition (~ <= 500 MB) , a big ext4 partition and a swap partition (~ 4-10 GB). \nYou have to delete everything until you get a big unallocated space.\nI could not find an exact image with ubuntu partitions.\n\n\nA: Run gparted, and format the drive to FAT32.\nIf it's not installed, run apt-get install gparted from terminal.\nIt will be accessible in the Ubuntu system tools menu or just by typing sudo gparted.\n", "Q: Make and receive calls on Ubuntu using an external android phone Is there any way that I could use my old Android device by connecting it via USB or even using the wireless LAN and make/receive calls and traditional text messages (SMS) on my laptop running Ubuntu?\n\nA: This topic looks to be asking the same or a similar question, and the answer cites Android Notifier (linked in that thread) as a potential solution.\nI don't know if you've considered it, or if it would be an appropriate response (if not, please edit or remove as necessary!)... But Google Voice allows for a new phone number which is used over WiFi. I have previously used that service for a business phone line as a Web developer, so that I could give a local number to clients and retain the privacy of my personal cell phone.\nThis does not rely on the phone being plugged into the computer, though, so perhaps this answer is not correct because it does not technically \"use Ubuntu;\" however, Google Voice can be used on the Web browser in Ubuntu (or any OS), as well as on your phone. You could download the app via WiFi on your old Android device and use it that way.\nForgive me if this is an irrelevant response, but if nothing else, a valid alternative.\n\nA: not sure if you managed to achieve what you wanted but if not a possible solution that I use is the app AirDroid.\n\nA: I'm not quite sure how you answer calls from your Ubuntu laptop, but for SMS, you could use KDEConnect (despite the name, it will work on Unity according to this). Follow the instructions posted here to install KDEConnect on your laptop, and then install KDEConnect on your phone via F-Droid or the Play Store. Then, make sure the devices are connected to the same network, open up KDEConnect on your laptop and phone and click on your phone's name. Finally, choose your desired settings and click \"Pair\".

The motherboard I'm planning on using for this linux build is the gigabyte GA-H170-HD3. \nMy question is will it work with linux? I started hesitating when I looked for linux drivers for the motherboard, but didn't find any. I went around the internet for a bit and saw a person talk about drivers got programmed into the linux kernel and ubuntu kernel directly. Is this true? Is \"linux compatibility\" nothing really to worry about? Or if it is, where should I look for linux compatible components?\nMany questions that needs to be answered.

Instead of removing /etc/resolv.conf insert nameserver 8.8.8.8 above the line nameserver 127.0.0.1.

You should be able to access it though any computer connected to your network by your computers local IP address such as... if your computers local address on your network is 192.168.0.20 then any other computer on your network could access owncloud by using http://192.168.0.20 If you want it accessible from the net you will have to open the proper ports in your router which I won't go into here\n", "Q: How do I connect my laptop to wifi?

When adjusting [speeding up] my boot time I discovered 2 methods to adjust NTP. https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html suggested /etc/ntp.conf; http://www.pool.ntp.org suggested /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift. \nI'm curious what are the advantages and disadvantages of either method?\n\nA: The two methods are the same.  /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift records the current drift adjustment.  This allows NTP to maintain the same drift setting following a reboot.  You can move this file by adding a driftfile to your NTP configuration file.  \nOn kernels that support it NTP will modify the tick speed so that that the clock does not drift as much.  Various factors such as temperature can cause clocks to drift.  If the clock speed changes, the calculated drift value will change.\nIf you are not running the NTP daemon, you can calculate the drift and manually enter the value in the drift file.

To resolve it, I ran alsamixer from cli, selected the \"Headphone\" channel using arrow keys, then pressing \"M\" to unmute (indicated by a status of \"MM\"). I had to also increase volume on this same channel. There was an additional channel that was causing distortion/interference once my headphones were unmuted, so I lowered that. Everything is fine after this, though I'm no longer prompted to identify the input device like I used to be on 14.04, which isn't a bad thing if it knows it's a headset.\n\nA: I had this problem when I installed pulseaudio and then removed it.\nI am not sure how to fix it myself, but installing pulseaudio might do the trick.\npulseaudio is needed for skype and maybe other programs.

Is it possible to fill a \"bug\" report somewhere to tell the maintainer, he should update the package for the next Ubuntu version? An example would be KBibTex, where the latest stable version (0.6) has been published nearly a year ago and yet we are stuck with a version 0.4.\n\nA: Looks like the  KBibTex package has been drifting through releases with no version bumps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yakkety (0.4-4): universe/kde\n\n*Xenial (0.4-4): universe/kde\n\n*Wily (0.4-4): universe/kde\n\n*Vivid (0.4-4): universe/kde\n\n*Trusty (0.4-4): universe/kde\n\n*Precise (0.4-1): universe/kde \n\n\nSo well worth filing a bug report which can be done through Launchpad:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kbibtex/+filebug\nInterestingly enough in the 'Answers' section you will see Klabauter mentioning that a new version is available and the answer to this question was: 'I suggest you report a bug.'

Is there an Ubuntu ISO used for virtual machines imaged in vmware or is there one ISO for both physical and virtual?\n\nA: It's the same ISO. \nOne of the purposes of a virtual machine is that an OS behaves the same as it does as on a physical machine. (But maybe that's an oversimplification.) Anyway, the booting and installation process is the same on a virtual machine as on a physical.\nBut, the virtualized OS may require some addons to run better in a VM.

I already have Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10.\nEDITED: It worked! The installation was equal to a normal dual boot.\n\nA: There shouldn't be. You will have to create a new partition on your hard drive to select when installing Ubuntu, but aside from that, the installation should be pretty painless.\nYou can use Gparted to resize an existing partition and to create a new ext4 one for Ubuntu 14.04.\nIn the installation, choose the Something Else... option when prompted and choose the new partition to install to.\n\nA: You may run into one issue depending on how the drive is set up. A disk with a traditional partition table (Basic MBR (Master Boot Record)) can only have up to four primary partitions. If you have an UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) instead of standard BIOS (Basic Input Output System) you probably are using GPT (GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) Partition Table) which is different and the following wont apply.  \nEach disk can have up to four primary partitions or three primary partitions and an extended partition. \nIf you want five partitions on a single drive, You’d have to create three primary partitions as well as an extended partition. The extended partition functions like a container that allows you to create logical partitions. So, if you needed five partitions, you’d create three primary partitions, an extended partition and then two logical partitions inside the extended partition. \nYou could also just create a single primary partition, an extended partition and four logical partitions. \nSo dealing with three OS's depending on how they are set up and how many partitions were originally installed. You may have to play around with the extended partition of the drive to set it up to allow enough partitions \n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 cannot uninstall 3rd party via GNOME-Softare So I know there's a bunch of post about installing 3rd party software via GNOME-Software (aka \"Ubuntu Softare\") but it looks like that may have been resolved with an update.

The plan is to retain two daily backups and 24 hourly backups. I think this is the first time that I am ever having to do anything with cron or anacron. So I have not only one but several questions that I am confused about and would be very happy to get some answers to, since I found some seemingly contradictory information about certain points and was not able to find any clear resolutions to them.\nSince I am really confused about quite a few things I had to be rather longwinded to make my questions clear. I hope you can bear with me here. For the TL;DR folks, I have highlighted the actual questions in bold typesetting.\nMy crontab looks like this:\n    # m h dom mon dow user  command\n    17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly\n    25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n    47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )\n    52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )\n    #\n\nand the anacrontab looks like this:\n    # These replace cron's entries\n    1   5   cron.daily  run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily\n    7   10  cron.weekly run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly\n    @monthly    15  cron.monthly    run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly\n\nThat is the standard after a clean install of Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop version.\nSince I suppose the system normally has a bunch of other cron and anacron jobs set up I figure I should better not mess with this standard configuration.\nHowever, I am slightly confused about the way the two work together, and about possible complications with their working together with my planned backup schedule.\nFirst of all, I understand that cron is a daemon that runs its tasks exactly as scheduled in the crontab if the computer is running at the specified time. Otherwise the job cannot be done. Okay. Simple.\nThen there is anacron about which I have read some seemingly contradictory information. The most simplistic information out there is that \"anacron can do scheduled tasks even if the computer is not turned on at the specified time. They will then be carried out whenever the computer is actually turned on again. So it is suited for desktops that do not run 24/7.\" Okay. Sounds nice. Seems like that's what I want.\nSome places I've read that anacron is a \"daemon\", then at other places (like here on askubuntu.com) it is pointed out that anacron is actually run as a cronjob (as demonstrated by the standard crontab above). Or can it be both according to different setups? And how can I know?\nThen there is the information that \"anacron does not do hourly jobs, or anything in periods of less than a day\". This seems to fit with this standard setup of the crontab and anacrontab above after a clean install of Ubuntu 16.04 where only the daily, hourly and monthly jobs are relayed to anacron, and /etc/cron.hourly is handled directly by cron, and as I have read that the first two tabs in each anacrontab entry specify the period of the scheduled task in days (1 day for /etc/cron.daily in this case, for example, and 7 days for /etc/cron.weekly - seems to fit well) and the waiting period in minutes after the first system startup of the day (or I guess rather after anacron startup; so 5 minutes for cron.daily, and 10 minutes for cron.weekly), this would make sense as well. Okay.\nHowever, on a German Ubuntu Wiki (wiki.ubuntuusers.de) I read that anacron now can do hourly jobs as of Ubuntu 14.04. But there is no description of how to do it, and I have not found any statements to that extent anywhere else, and I don't see how one should specify an hourly job in the anacrontab. So another question is: Can anacron \"as of Ubuntu version 14.04\" be used to do hourly jobs? If so, how?\nThe first really mystifying question that arises here for me is: If cronjobs are run only at the specified time, and there are these different cronjobs set up for running anacron to carry out the tasks in /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly and /etc/cron.monthly, at 6:25, 6:47 and 6:52 respectively - then what if the computer is never actually turned on that early in the morning? Then anacron is never actually run or what? How can anacron \"do better than cron\" in some sense (i.e., doing tasks later than scheduled if the computer was shut down in between) if anacron relies on cron?\nSo these are my questions about cron and anacron.\nThen I have also questions about rsnapshot proper which I guess I should better relay to a new question topic.\nThanks for reading, and any clear answers are very much appreciated.\n\nA: Anacron is not a daemon; it's just a program that's run by cron.  This is explained in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto, near the bottom, under the heading How Anacron is Set Up.  According to that article, \"anacron is run on every startup, wake up, plug-in, and at 7:30 AM every day.\"\nTo quote from that section of that article:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a Upstart task, located in /etc/init/anacron.conf, which\nruns all the jobs in /etc/anacrontab. It is set to run on startup.\n\n*There is a cron.d file (/etc/cron.d/anacron) which causes the Upstart\ntask to be started every day at 7:30 AM.\n\n*There is a file /etc/apm/event.d/anacron, which causes the Upstart\ntask to be started when a laptop is plugged in to A/C power, or woken\nup.\nAs for whether recent versions of anacron can handle hourly jobs: I have no idea, but it wouldn't seem useful.  If you look at /etc/crontab, you'll see that the jobs in /etc/cron.hourly are run by cron every hour whether or not there's an executable file named /usr/sbin/anacron; it's only the files in /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly, and /etc/cron.monthly that are run by cron only when there is no executable anacron installed.\n\nA: As far as I understand it .... anacron is not a daemon and is ran by cron. cron runs at boot and runs anacron. anacron checks to see if something its programmed with has missed its schedule and runs it. \nSince this is the way I see it ... it would seem that you would want the daily job set in anacron. As for hourly in anacron .. I also haven't seen anything on how it can be setup so I would put the hourly backup in cron. \nI know this doesn't explain it that well but ... I guess it confuses me too. I'm sure someone here can come up with a better, more satisfying answer but I figured I would generalize it.\n", "Q: Restore unity after removing gnome desktop (Ubuntu 14.04) I removed gnome desktop (ubuntu-gnome-desktop) to go back to unity but now the unity folder icons, unity panel icons and even the boot screen are as they were in the gnome desktop. Dash and launcher are there but icons are from gnome. How can I restore these?\nI have tried resetting and reinstalling unity but it didn't work.\nThis is how folders and panel icons look like at present after removing Genome desktop and reinstalling unity.\n\n\nA: Reinstall the ubuntu-desktop package via command\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall `ubuntu-desktop` \n\nIf that doesn't help, you can manually reset icons and theme via Unity Tweak Tool, and use update-alternatives command to change plymouth theme ( that's the boot screen ) , like so:\n$ sudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth           \n[sudo] password for xieerqi: \nThere are 3 choices for the alternative default.plymouth (providing /lib/plymouth/themes/default.plymouth).\n\n  Selection    Path                                                             Priority   Status\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* 0            /lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntukylin-logo/ubuntukylin-logo.plymouth   150       auto mode\n  1            /lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-logo/ubuntu-logo-scale-2.plymouth     99        manual mode\n  2            /lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntu-logo/ubuntu-logo.plymouth             100       manual mode\n  3            /lib/plymouth/themes/ubuntukylin-logo/ubuntukylin-logo.plymouth   150       manual mode\n\nPress enter to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: \n\n\nA: Have you tried changing the icon and theme of unity in order to get back the default icon and panel settings ?

Response time and user latency can be different due to DNS failures and other network congestion. \nIn the example you gave .. there wasn't any issues at the time.\nThis may not be accurate though.... this is what I have determined after some short research\nAlso another nice switch for ping is the -c switch which is the ping count .. Windows pings 4 times then stops where as Ubuntu will ping until you stop it .. the -c switch will change that .. if you used ping -c 4 google.com it will ping 4 times then stop.  \n", "Q: Black screen after login Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 I had just updated to Ubuntu gnome 16.04 from 15.10.\nAfter reboot, I type password and click Login but just show a black screen, the desktop was not loaded.\nI just go to the desktop by type Ctrl+Alt+F1, then use command startx..\nWhat was happened with my system ?\n\nA: The only workaround available to this bug is to download and choose lightdm as the login manager of Ubuntu, rather than the default GDM, I've downloaded and installed it from Synaptic with ease and chose it as default by running the command : sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm, once you see this message hit Enter.\n\nThen you see this window, choose lightdm and hit enter.\n\nYour selection will be available on the next reboot.\nSource and bug details  [Here].\n", "Q: Identifying an application using network When I ran the following command sudo netstat -lantp | grep -i stab | awk -F/ '{print $2 $3}' | sort | uniq on the terminal to check which applications are using the network connection,  I got the following output\n\nfirefox\n  prx     \n\nI cannot recognize  what prx is.

However please contact Ubuntu so that they can help you further. If further support is required from HP you will need to reinstall the original operating system back on the PC and we will be able to help you further.\n08:50 João Abrantes: I have the original OS installed \n08:52 João Abrantes: Ubuntu is used by millions of users. If your hardware and customer service don't support such widely used Software you will lose all these clients..\n08:52 Pauline: I am sorry however as I said we do not have much expertise over the same and hence kindly contact Ubuntu for the same.\n08:54 João Abrantes: Ubutnu is not a company, they gave me their software for free. I paid you more than a thousand euros and all I get is incompatible hardware and no support.\n08:54 João Abrantes: Is it possible to replace my laptop or my network adaptor? I still have warranty\n08:55 Pauline: If the Pc is still under a month, you can approach the place of purchase to get it replaced.\n08:55 João Abrantes: It's not under a month \n08:55 João Abrantes: it's under 2 years which is my warranty period\n08:56 Pauline: Joao unfortunately we cannot replace the PC if the time of purchase is more than a month.\n08:56 João Abrantes: Not even my incompatible network adaptor?\n08:57 Pauline: You will need to contact the place of purchase and check with their return and replacement policy.\n08:58 João Abrantes: Ok this is useless. I am going to share this conversation in the Ubuntu forums. At least I can save time and money to other users by making them avoid buying HP incompatible hardware.\n09:00 Pauline: I am sorry about the inconvenience caused, however please understand we do not have the expertise or required tools to help with another operating system issue.\n09:00 João Abrantes: The network adaptor also causes problems on windows\n09:00 João Abrantes: I can't start an hotspot\n09:05 Pauline: Joao as I said if you will need to reinstall the original operating system on the Pc for us to troubleshoot. as in the original operating system, should be the only operating system on the PC.\n09:06 João Abrantes: Windows is my original OS!\n09:06 João Abrantes: and it is installed\n09:07 Pauline: Joao I understand but currently there is a dual Os in the Pc and hence I will not be able to troubleshoot the same.\n09:07 Pauline: Please run a recovery on the PC and get back to us with only the windows image loaded\n09:07 Pauline: we will be able to help you with the same.\n\n\nA: This solution was obtained from collaborative effort with the question poster.\nStep 1.

It's Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with kernel 3.19.  The motherboard is the Gigabyte ga-990fxa-ud5 r5 with bios ver. 3.  I have qeum/kvm 2.2 installed.  I have IOMMU on in the kernel and can pass my video cards and usb through.  I have a Intel 82576 four port card and it is detected and shows SR-IOV capability.  I have installed the latest verion of the IGB driver for it.  Seems to be fine as it is attached to the ports on the card.  \nMy issue is that when I put \"max_vfs=4\" in a file under modprobe.d and reboot, no virtual functions show up.  I also have one \"modprobe -r igb\" and then \"modprobe igb max_vfs=4\" as suggested by people.  Nothing.  I just can't seem to program this server and make the virtual functions show up.  \nIs it even possible with this motherboard?  Is the kernel the issue?  \n\nA: Firstly, rebooting is not required when creating VFs. Infact rebooting will remove the VFs(if any created).\nUse the below command to view the number of VFs for a specific PCI device:\ncat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<pci-address>/max_vfs\n\nIt should be zero when no VF is created, now create a VF using the below command:\necho 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<pci-address>/max_vfs\nview the VF using \"lspci\" command\n\n", "Q: High CPU Temperature after switch to Ubuntu 16.04 The idle CPU Temp of my Intel i5-3210M CPU was ~40°C on Ubuntu 14.04.\nNow, after upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04 (complete reinstall) it idles at ~52°C.\nBattery lifetime is also noticeably lower.\nWhat can I do? (What information is needed?)\n\nA: I'm having the same problem. I ran the top command and the browser (vivaldi) is using the most cpu with up to 5 processes. The % range is between 1.5 to 7.0 without playing videos. The % range of the vivaldi browser playing videos is between 13.0 and 46.0. I'm not sure if has to do with ubuntu 16 or the vivaldi browser. I have no problems before with ubuntu 14.04.\nI switched browsers (vivaldi, chromium, firefox) and the cpu's temperature incremented immediately within 90C. \n\n#\n\nI want to update this post. I couldn't find a solution running Ubuntu 16.04. I ended up reinstalling Ubuntu 14.04 and monitor the temperature. Firefox and Vivaldi still have problems raising the cpu temperature while playing videos. However, cpu temperature stays  between 60's and 70's playing videos with Chromium. I watched around one hour of a video tutorial and the cpu temperature was stable.\nLooks like is a combination of OS and browser. The combination that works for me Ubuntu 14.04 and Chromium.\nHope Canonical developers gets notify about the problem and fix it.\n\nA: I had the same problem (after upgrade to 16.04 from 14.04). Psensors detected that my CPU's temperature is around 65° C.\nI look at the top, which showed me that psensors are using about 93% of CPU. Then I tried to run configure psensors again (see http://itsfoss.com/check-laptop-cpu-temperature-ubuntu/)\n\nsudo sensors-detect\n sensors\n\nNow I am observing significant decrease of CPU temperature (from 40° to 45°).\nMy configuration:\nThinkPad T440s, CPU : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4300U CPU @ 1.90GHz, OS: Ubuntu 16.04, Unity\n\nA: The reason is because Ubuntu 16.04 does not use graphics. Now your CPU is doing all the heave lifting for the graphics.\nSadly they won't allow you to use vendor graphics drivers anymore.\n", "Q: Command-Line: nano VS vi What is the difference between the command-line text editors 'vi' and 'nano'?\nCan someone explain this in detail and why many people prefer 'vi' over 'nano'?\nThank you. \n\nA: nano is a simple, easy to use editor that is especially popular among new users and users who hardly ever use a text editor at the command line. It's the default command line text editor in Ubuntu.\nvi is a sophisticated editor for people who don't mind spending a few hours for learning how to use a powerful tool. It's popular among programmers, sysadmins and other people who spend a lot of time using a text editor. \nYou can quit vi using EscShift-ZShift-Z (that's not obvious from within vi).\n", "Q: Lenovo G50-80 suspend freeze on Kubuntu 16.04 I have recently installed Kubuntu 16.04 LTS alongside Windows 10 Pro on one HDD. System selection works. But when I use suspend in Kubuntu computer freezes entirely. Screen turn off, but all LEDs are still lit (power indicators, and CapsLk and NumLock stays lit if they were lit prior to suspend and cannot be switched off). And lastly the fan is going crazy speeding up to full speed after a short time. It does it by steps, like if the cpu was heating up, but air blowing from it is colder than in normal use of the laptop. And anything I could do is holding power button to power off the lapton. In Windows 10 suspend works with no problem.\nI have edited question in accordance to Steve Roome comment:\n\nTry the steps in the answer to \"How can I figure out why Suspend sometimes fails?\" and edit your question to include the output.

However installing kernel 4.4.8 seems to fix this issue (tested few times in Mate). I does not know if it is persistent, or I have luck five times in a row. I does not tested it in kubuntu, but result should be same. Suspend however takes much more time than in 14.04 (up to 15 seconds in 16.04, almost instant in 14.04). Thanks to all people involved in finding answer to this question.\n\nA: Please try opening your terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), then paste the following: sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and enter your superuser password.\nIn the opened file, copy and paste (Ctrl+Shift+V) the following lines beneath the first comment, for simplicity:\nblacklist dw_dmac\nblacklist dw_dmac_core\n\nThen save this file again (Ctrl+Shift+O) and close it (Ctrl+Shift+X).\nSuspend should work now without freezing. If you have shutdown/boot issues, try blacklisting these modules in grub as well.

If it doesn't help, you might have to also add your group ID as gid=yyyy.\nTaken from here.\n\nA: Check permission:\ncd  ~/.local/share/\nls  -la | grep Trash\n\nIf it says root then change the permission using:\nsudo chown username:username Trash\n\nAlso, if you are using the rm command, then files are deleted permanently.\n", "Q: chrome extension to automaticly open highlighted commands from webbrowser in terminal As the title suggests, is there a chrome extension to automatically open highlighted commands of web browser in the terminal?\nWouldn't this be great?\n\nA: Based on the way Chrome is designed to be self contained, there likely isn't any way to make an extension to do this. However, most newer Linux users don't seem to know that if you highlight text with your mouse, you can middle-click and paste it anywhere else. So you can just highlight the text in the browser and middle-click it into your terminal.\n", "Q: Install TensorFlow with Python3 on Ubuntu 16.04 When I try to install tensorflow package with pip3 on Ubuntu 16.04 I obtained this error message:\n\nThe directory '/home/federico/.cache/pip/http' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled.

Luckily the Wheel is actually compatible with Python 3.5, so you don't need to compile from source. \nYou need to download the wheel, rename it to prevent the python 3.4 check from failing, and then install by passing the renamed file to pip.\nFor the current version of Tensorflow (peeps in the future, check the website for the latest version and adapt commands below if necessary) run: \nwget https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl\nmv tensorflow-0.8.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl tensorflow-0.8.0-cp35-none-linux_x86_64.whl\npip install tensorflow-0.8.0-cp35-none-linux_x86_64.whl\n\n\nA: use pip --- for python2\n    pip3 -- for python3\nrecommencement to use sudo\npip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.10.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl \n\n", "Q: Hard Drive error: bad/missing sense data I recently tried to check the spin down time of my hard drive with the following command:\nsudo hdparm -I /dev/sdb | grep level\n\nand got the error:\nSG_IO: bad/missing sense data, sb[]:  70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 00 24 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n\nThe drive reads & writes data just fine and mounts on startup as well. I just simply cannot run this command on this drive without errors\nWhat does this mean, and how can I resolve the issue?\n\nA: looks like your drive controller doesn't support that method of enquiry, not all usb sata chipsets are created equal. You don't say what model of drive or controller you are using so its hard to offer more advice here.\nYou could test this by plugging into another usb controller or using a different drive with the same controller or better still direct via SATA.\n3TB drives can be too big for some usb2 era controllers so i would recommend getting a reputable usb3 sata bridge instead, it will be much faster as well.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my Seagate backup slim and WD black SCSI drives. And I was using hdparm as well. What worked for me is thesdparm utility.\nInstall with\nsudo apt install sdparm\n\nGet all parameters/settings with\nsudo sdparm -l -a /dev/sdX\n\nHere -a gets all output fields  and -l gets the long output i.e. explanation of the output fields. /dev/sdX is the drive in question (similar to /dev/sda).\nGet the spindown timer and the STANDBY flag with:\nsudo sdparm -l --get SCT /dev/sdX\nsudo sdparm -l --get STANDBY /dev/sdX\n\nThe spindown time SCT here is in milliseconds and STANDBY flag is the spindown timer on/off (1/0) switch\nIf your output is similar to:\n# STANDBY     0  [cha: y, def:  1, sav:  1]\n# SCT       4294967286  [cha: y, def:18000, sav:18000]\n\nThis means that your device is not set to spin down.\nIf you want you can change these settings for the current session with:\nsudo sdparm -l --set SCT=6000 /dev/sdX\nsudo sdparm -l --set STANDBY=1 /dev/sdX\n\nThese settings will be lost on reboot.\nChange permanently with:\nsudo sdparm -l --save --set SCT=6000 /dev/sdX\nsudo sdparm -l --save --set STANDBY=1 /dev/sdX\n\nHere I chose 6 seconds (6000 milliseconds) but you can choose according to your requirements.\nIf for some reason, you cannot save your settings, you can put this in your /etc/rc.local to set these on boot:\nsdparm -l --set SCT=6000 --set STANDBY=1 /dev/sdX\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: This problem is usually caused by USB-SATA bridge implementation and should be visible only with USB connected disk enclosures.\nIn case of external USB disk, the system needs to talk to the SATA drive inside the enclosure using UAS (USB Attached SCSI) protocol over SAT (SCSI / ATA Translation) to send ATA commands over SCSI over USB. The reason this is so complex is due historical reasons.\nSomewhere in the chain USB → UAS → SCSI → SAT → SATA some piece of hardware has incorrect implementation. Usually all of this is done by a single microchip inside the enclosure called USB-SATA bridge and some well known variants are ASM1051, ASM1053 and ASM1153. Of these, the ASM1051 is known to be buggy and UAS should be avoided with any hardware containing this chip. ASM1053 and ASM1153 may or may not work depending on actual firmware inside the chip (the manufacturer is allowed to customize the firmware, the reference implementation does work correctly). For example, many enclosures made by Seagate use ASM1153 with custom firmware and have problems with some ATA commands even if the same chip does work correctly with reference firmware. (For example, some enclosures by Seagate work as long as OS never sends any 12 or 16 bit commands. Linux usb_storage supports quirk t for this purpose.) The end user usually cannot replace the firmware so if you have a bad chip/firmware your only option is to complain to the manufacturer. In case of Seagate, they \"fix\" the problem by stating that they officially support Windows and OS X only. Seagate is nowdays officially working with Linux community so perhaps their products will actually work in the future.\nThe only real way to figure out the bridge chip is to dismantle the enclosure and inspect the markings in the actual microchips.\nUpdate: \"Seagate Backup Plus Hub\" enclosures have correctly working USB-SATA bridge and UAS works correctly (Note that this is different product from \"Seagate Backup Plus\"!) However, due to poor history by Seagate's enclosures, the Linux kernel applies the quirk t by default which prevents this enclosure from using all SATA features. You can enable full SATA support including S.M.A.R.T. features with following command:\necho \"0bc2:ab38:\" > /sys/module/usb_storage/parameters/quirks\n\nNote the trailing colon and nothing after that - it disables all built-in quirks for the selected vendor:product. Check your vendor and product ids with lsusb if needed.\nIf your device is buggy enough, you may need to totally disable UAS support. This can be done with the u quirk. For example, if I would like to disable UAS support on Seagate Backup Plus Hub, I'd run following as root:\necho \"0bc2:ab38:u\" > /sys/module/usb_storage/parameters/quirks\n\nAfter that, the external disk will use only slower but usually working USB storage device features and things end up working... slowly. If you only need to transfer some big files the difference is not that bad. If you have lots of small files, the difference between having working UAS support may be more than 10x speed difference.\n\nA: Additional info for systems/devices for which the above and/or modprobe tweaks have no effect (eg Raspberry Pi 3):\nThe quirks must be added to the boot parameters.  For RPi 3/Raspbian, the  boot parameters are in the file /boot/cmdline.txt.\n[other command line parameters...] usb_storage.quirks=YOUR_VENDOR_ID:YOUR_DEVICE_ID:QUIRK_FLAGS\n\nIn my case, I needed to clear the quirks flag for my device, so I added this to /boot/cmdline.txt:\nusb_storage.quirks=0bc2:a0a4:\nThis solved my issue, hopefully it helps someone else\n", "Q: Problem exporting my database sql through the terminal I have this issue when I try to export my database with the CLI instruction  mysqldump -u [root] -p [guru99] > [guru99].sql\nroot@YuveSys:/home/yuve# mysqldump -u [root] -p [guru99] > [guru99].sql\nEnter password: \nmysqldump: Got error: 1045: Access denied for user '[root]'@'localhost' (using password: YES) when trying to connect\nroot@YuveSys:/home/yuve# \n\nPlease can anyone help?\n\nA: you shouldn't need the []'s try\nmysqldump -u root -p guru99 > guru99.sql\n\nand guru99 should be your database name\n", "Q: Box Account Sync in kubuntu I am new to linux, I have currently installed kubuntu and I need assistance with synchronizing my box account to a folder in my Home.

Example:\nabcd@abcd-abcde:~$ xinput --list --short\n\nVirtual core pointer\n\n↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\n↳ Logitech USB RECEIVER                     id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nHow would I extract a column from the output, say the second one? And, for example, store it in a variable?\nIs it possible to do this?\n\nA: Knowing that the items are tab separated, we can use shell-only way with $IFS variable and while read ; do . . .done structure. \n$ xinput | while IFS=$'\\t' read ONE TWO THRE ; do                                        \n> echo $TWO\n> done\nid=2\nid=4\nid=11\nid=3\nid=5\nid=6\nid=7\nid=8\nid=9\nid=10\nid=12\n\nTo store items in a variable, we can use arrays, and \n$ xinput | { while IFS=$'\\t' read ONE TWO THRE ; do                                     \n> array+=( \"$TWO\" )\n> done ;\n> echo ${array[@]} \n> }\nid=2 id=4 id=11 id=3 id=5 id=6 id=7 id=8 id=9 id=10 id=12\n\nNotice me using command | { command1 ; command2 ; command3 } structure.

So I recommend others try that if they are struggling.\nJust note that if you do that, you should follow the instructions here to get your volume/sound icon back (if it's missing after reboot - which it was for me).\nI can't get to the root of this problem now, because it no longer exists for me.\nEdit 3\nThe problem came back...\nDebug logs from pulseaudio don't reveal anything useful (e.g. error messages).\nAccording to this diagram, alsa is the next stop to check for the cause.\n\nA: This answer appears to be working for me, but I have not investigated why yet.\nTo repeat the solution, just run this command in a shell (no root needed):\nalsactl restore\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with Ubuntu 20.04, I fixed the issue by removing and reInstall ALSA and PlusAudio into Ubuntu Like the suggestion from this article.\nHere are Linux Commands for Remove and ReInstall:\nsudo apt remove --purge alsa-base pulseaudio\nsudo apt install alsa-base pulseaudio\n\nThen You can Reload ALSA again(Optional Step) from the same article again:\nalsactl restore\n\nOr Using force\nsudo alsa force-reload\n\n", "Q: How to achieve resolving of the same hostname to different IP addresses based on location I have personal webserver with ownCloud installed. This webserver has no public IP address because my internet connection does not offer it.\nI ordered virtual linux webserver with a public IP address and I use it just for port forwarding via SSH to allow my ownCloud server be accessible from the internet. Everything works fine and I am accessing the ownCloud via a hostname - example: \"mytunneledowncloud.com\".\nBut as I have limited high speed data on my internet connection, I would like to save some data by synchronizing ownCloud via LAN private IP address when I am at home and not via ssh tunneled public ip address of my virtual server. \nI am thinking whether this is even possible. I would need to resolve \"mytunneledowncloud.com\" as:\n\n\n*\n\n*private ip address - in case I am on home LAN \n\n*public ip address - in\ncase I am not on home LAN\n\n\nTo be honest, I know this is a bit \"ridiculous\" request, but maybe there is some \"workaround\" for it. \nNote: I use Ubuntu on all my servers and PCs.\n\nA: Finally I got the resolution for the \"problem\" and it is very simple.\nI followed these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*installed dnsmasq on my home server so it will become a very simple dns server\n\n*in my home server I added an entry with the private ip address of my home server into /etc/hosts with domain name \"mytunneledowncloud.com\"\n\n*configured my home server's DHCP daemon to assign home server's private IP as a DNS server to the clients \n\n\nNow it works perfectly. My home server now acts as dhcp/dns/web server and it assigns its own private ip as a dns server to the connected LAN clients. Then clients send the requests for the DNS resolution to my home server. My home server's dnsmasq looks into its /etc/hosts whether there is an entry for the requested domain name and if there is a match, provide the IP from there and if there is no match, then it uses the \"internet's\" DNS servers to resolve it.\n", "Q: Prevent updating \"modified time\" when copying files to a mounted Samba folder I don’t want the “last modified” attribute to be updated with the current date when I am copying files to a mounted Samba folder.

This is, why using the URI smb:// is not a workaround for me.\n\n\nA: The timestamp \"last modified\" remains (and will not be replaced by the current time) when adding proper group and user IDs to the mount command, e.g.: \nsudo mount -t cifs //mynas/folder mnt/mynas/folder -o user=username,gid=1000,uid=1000\n", "Q: How do I remove the Gnome's video applications?

With the same PC & windows,all is fine.\nAny suggestions what I can do to solve this?\nEdit: requested output can be found here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23133645/\n\nA: First the ath10k driver doesn't report the correct/real speed as indicated in ath10k FAQ. So the \"Bit Rate\" stay stuck at 1Mb/s.\nSecond there is a major performance issue with QCA9377 in Linux kernel 4.4 , I recommend to upgrade your kernel to 4.8 version.\n\nA: Had the low Wi-Fi speed under Ubuntu 20.10 on an Acer Aspire E 15 e5-575g-53s6 with the same QCA9377 network card. The latest kvalo's firmware is already supplied in the system.\nHowever, removing the /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA9377/hw1.0/firmware-6.bin file and rebooting helped. The system works with the previous firmware-5.bin with perfect speed now.\n\nA: Research indicates that the information available on that interface is minimal however, It appears from your pastebin output that firmware is failing to load and no channel is getting configured. Since the QCA9377 supports it you might try iw which is a \"new\" nl80211 based CLI configuration utility for wireless devices. It supports all new drivers that have been added to the kernel recently. The old tool iwconfing, which uses Wireless Extensions interface, is deprecated and it's strongly recommended to switch to iw and nl80211. \nYou might start by insuring that there is no stronger signal than yours on the frequency/channel you intend to use (and if so pick a less crowded one) I've found the android app Wifi Analyzer useful in determining what the best channel to use in a specific area is. Having made this determination you can continue with configuring your router to that channel and then wireless as well with iw Documentation is available here. \nYou can get further useful information by getting station statistics against a peer\nIf you want to get specific statistics against a peer your station is communicating with you can use the following:\nsudo iw dev wlp3s0 station get <peer-MAC-address>\nIn the case of a STA the above  would be the MAC address of your AP (router). Where wlp3s0 is your wireless device which matches to your pastebin output of wlp3s0: renamed from wlan0\nYou can use iw to specify specific Tx rates and Tx power as well which might be quite useful under the circumstances. I might also try turning off power saving for the interface. You can check it with  iw dev wlp3s0 get power_save\nIf it's on you can turn it off with sudo iw dev wlp3s0 set power_save off\n\nA: Try instaling your driver manually.\nplace it in your home and run these commands in terminal:\n$ sudo apt-get update\n\n$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential\n\n$ wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/2015/11/20/backports-20151120.tar.gz\n\n$ tar -zxvf backports-20151120.tar.gz\n\n$ cd backports-20151120\n\n$ make defconfig-ath10k\n\n$ make\n\n$ sudo make install\n\nturn your Wi-Fi off when doing these steps.

Videos from YouTube, Vimeo, etc. are working fine. But no video from Star Sports will play. Why is this and how can I fix it?\n\nA: The old way of installing Adobe Flash with sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer is no longer supported. Instead, you need to use Fresh Player.\nTo Install\nAs of 16.04, Fresh Player is available in the official repositories. Installing is as simple as:\n sudo apt-get install browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash\n\nHowever, if you still want the most up-to-date version, you can add the PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash\n\nThis will install the actual player, but it still needs an extra file. This file is the actual pepperflash library used by the player. To get it, you can use a PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:skunk/pepper-flash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pepflashplugin-installer\n\nClose your browser and re-open, and it should be enabled.

I have disabled secure boot, fast boot and I have enabled legacy mode in bios. After reducing sda3 to make space, what partitions should I create? In which partition should I install bootloader (sda or sdaX)? Is it necessary to use legacy mode or can I use uefi mode?\n\nA: I did the same installation some time ago and the installation worked just fine, without disabling secure boot or anything (using UEFI).\nI just made a new empty partition and started the ubuntu installation from the USB stick. After the installation everything worked and when rebooting,  grub2 showed up to let me choose which operating system to boot.\nBTW: maybe consider to use the newer 16.04 which is also LTS.\n\nA: \nI have disabled secure boot\n\nThis should be unnecessary, and as a general rule, is inadvisable. If you can't boot the installation medium with Secure Boot enabled, disabling it might fix the problem -- or you could have another issue\n\nfast boot\n\nThere are at least two features with similar names:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Windows Fast Startup feature must be disable to safely dual-boot with Ubuntu (or anything else). See here for details. Note that it's also often necessary to disable Hibernation, too.\n\n*Many EFIs have a feature with a similar name, which typically causes the firmware to take certain shortcuts in the startup process. These shortcuts sometimes make it difficult or impossible to select the boot device, so you may not be able to boot the Ubuntu installer; but if you can boot the Ubuntu installer, the firmware feature should have no other negative consequences.\n\n\n\nI have enabled legacy mode in bios\n\nDON'T DO THIS!!!! The result is likely to be one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*No effect. If you're lucky, enabling this feature will do nothing, except possibly increase your boot time by a couple of seconds.\n\n*Create a mixed-mode installation. If you're unlucky, enabling BIOS/CSM/legacy support will result in a BIOS-mode install of Ubuntu alongside an EFI-mode install of Windows. Such a setup is more difficult to boot -- sometimes to the point of impossibility. You should avoid this type of setup like the plague!\n\n\nOn rare occasions, enabling the CSM may be necessary -- but if it were needed on your computer, it would probably already be needed for Windows. Thus, you should undo this change before you attempt to install Ubuntu.

Instead you should only allow the things that require access.\nSolution:\nExecute: xhost +si:localhost:root\nThe above solution also works for Wayland users executing an elevated XWayland application.\nWhen attempting to run an XWayland application with elevated permissions you may receive the following error:\nNo protocol specified\nUnable to init server: Could not connect: Connection refused\nCould not parse arguments: Cannot open display:\n\n\nA: As a regular user, run the command xhost +. After that, try running your graphical application again.\nThis turns off host-based access control on the X server. Here is the relevant information from the man page:\n\nThe xhost program is used to add and delete host names or user names to the list allowed to make connections to the X server.\n+ Access is granted to everyone, even if they aren't on the  list (i.e., access control is turned off).\n\n\nA: Odd but export DISPLAY=:1 helped.

I was using Windows 7 (but since upgraded to Windows 10) when I first used it and all I needed to do was plug the stick into the USB port and the Console-Site-specific browser self loaded, which also provided a shortcut on the desktop to open the Console-Site-specific browser. I need the Console-Site-specific browser to load the connection details into, each time I buy a connection.\nI have successfully installed Ubuntu into my new computer, and am browsing all of the features. I have plugged the USB stick into the laptop and received a message saying similar to that I'm now connected to the Internet, despite that not being possible because there was no current connection, however I can not find where the Console-Site-specific browser is loaded.\nThe only likely place in the Launcher appears to be Ubuntu Software.\nIn Ubuntu Desktop Guide - Install additional software - there is reference to \"Software\" which I assume is a program to install software but I can not find how to use that. It appears Ubuntu assumes the only place users obtain programs is from the Internet, but I want to transfer programs and data from my old computer.\nI have purchased a new laptop and chosen Ubuntu, but now at a standstill because I can't connect to the Internet.\nIf I knew how to open, copy and or paste and or install into, C Drive, D Drive & E Drive, I could probably resolve my problems.\nI also have a text editor which I want to install.\nAnd I want to install XAMPP which requires being installed into C Drive.\nI have been told Ubuntu includes the latest version of PHP, but I don't know if it includes any other parts of XAMPP.\nCan somebody help please?\nUPDATE\nThe \"Console-Site-specific browser\", including the exe file, is located in C:\\Program Files. I can copy that onto a DVD, likewise with the Text Editor. But what do I do with them on the DVD in Ubuntu? The \"Console-Site-specific browser\", and the Text Editor, probably will not support Ubuntu, so it appears I'm doomed. The Internet connections in the country I'm in, is not good. Another ISP probably will not support Ubuntu as 99% of new computers for sale here come with Windows 10 so the likelihood of Ubuntu being supported by any ISP is very low. I do not know how to find the web address, and I guess for obvious reasons that will be well hidden.\nIf I can't connect to the Internet I'll need to abandon Ubuntu. Another web developer spoke so highly of Ubuntu, but he probably uses Windows to connect to the Internet.\nI was expecting Ubuntu to make everything interchangeable with Windows programs, the same as most programs are interchangeable with Windows & Mac, but it appears my expectations were too high. I recall something in the spreadsheet within Ubuntu being compatible with outside programs.\nAlso with the website I intend building, I was intending to encourage users to change to Ubuntu, but that idea now appears doomed.\nIs there any other Linux OS that is compatible with Windows programs?\nUPDATE\nMaybe \"Wine\" is the solution, but when I search in Ubuntu Software \"No Application Found\".\nHow do I install Wine?\nMaybe download from my old laptop and burn it onto a DVD, but I'm bewildered if I can't open the DVD Drive.\n\nA: Ubuntu is not Windows. If you try and do things the same way as in Windows, you will be frustrated.\nThere is no such thing as a C: drive (or E: drive or...). There are only mountpoints. Like, if you have a USB called 'MYUSB', its contents will be accessible (after mounting, which is done when you click it in the file manager - or you can configure it to auto-mount disks) at the /media/USERNAME/MYUSB/ directory.\nThe equivalent to Windows \"installers\" are Debian Packages (file format .deb). Ubuntu has a very intuitive software installation system - no click-click-click installers, no hunting the web for apps - just search for its name in Software and click 'Install'.\nIf you want to access your Windows drives from Ubuntu, just click on the button named XX-GB Volume in the side panel.\nXAMPP consists of Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl. Perl comes installed, you can install the rest with the command\nsudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php7.0\n\nAlso, Ubuntu automatically decides the place for installed programs.\nAs for the internet... That'll have to be a separate question - please provide all details about the modem and the \"Console-Site-specific browser\". If you can see what web address the \"Console-Site-specific browser\" access upon clicking the shortcut, just visiting there in Ubuntu (and logging in, whatever else) will (most probably) work.\n", "Q: Syncronizing to NAS fails but works with USB disk Rsync command:\n$ rsync -ah --progress --delete /path/* 192.168.1.1:/path/\n\nGives error\nohto@192.168.1.1's password:  Could not chdir to home directory /var/services/homes/ohto: ... rsync: failed to set permissions on \"/path\": Operation not permitted (1)\n\nI can copy, create, delete, modify files and folders inside NAS folder.

This is one step into that direction. I cannot achieve that goal without first getting my files to NAS.\n\nA: Since you're syncing from Linux to DSM, I'd suggest using rsync directly, without first mounting the NAS destination on your desktop. There's no point letting SMB/samba sit in the middle - it will introduce extra potential problems, particularly with file naming and features not supported by SMB (such as symbolic links).\nThere are a lot of different ways to set this up, depending on what you want to achieve (one-off sync, regular backups etc.), and I'm not sitting in front of my NAS right now, so probably the best advice I can give is \"look up rsync in the DSM help\", and \"tell us a bit more about what you're trying to achieve.\"\n\nA: This has nothing to do with zfs, but with insufficient rights for your sync programs to access the gvfs folder.\nYou can test this by mounting something so that /var/run/user/1000/gvfs is populated and then do a sudo ls /var/run/user/1000/gvfs and a ls /var/run/user/1000/gvfs. Only the last one will list the contents of the gvfs folder, the first one fails with insufficient access rights.\nAs evidenced by the pkexec in your post, you are trying to run them as root, which fails here.

I run my terminal commands as root but sometimes some programs (e.g., Tor Browser) say \"The Tor Browser Bundle should not be run as root. Exiting.\"\nI want to understand whether this command is optional or mandatory (e.g., sudo apt-get install tor).\n\nA: If you run as root sudo is not necessary, if you run as normal user and want to do something which requires elevated privileges then you need it.\nBeside the fact that you shouldn't run the whole time as root for various reasons, such as security etc. This is why the tor browser wont start when you run as root.\nSudo means \"super user do\" so you will only be root for that particular command. Sure the following commands containing sudo as long within a defined time-frame wont ask you for your password again, but there are ways to change that.\n\nA: It stands for \"super user do\" something.  It allows a certain set of permitted users to run as the root user (full access to everything).  So if your install through apt-get needs to modify something that only root can change, you need to use sudo.\n", "Q: How to uninstall apt-get?

I know python3 needs parentheses after print, so I tried with and without, but the same error is produced. Strangely, print commands.getoutput(line)) produces a syntax error recognizing the missing opening parenthesis.\nAlso I changed the 'comment'(I guess) at the top of the tool to python3 thinking the interpreter would handle whatever parentheses indiscretion was occurring a little more gracefully, but that's a no go because commands is apparently defunct now.\nObviously I want the code that will do what I want, but answers shedding light on the error as well are preferred.

Do:\nsudo apt-key list\n\nFind the offending key (near \"virtualbox\", after \"pub\", xxx/KEYHERE) and do:\nsudo apt-key del KEYHERE\n\nThen go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads and follow the instructions at \"Debian-based Linux distributions\"\n\nA: I encounter this problem when trying to install docker.

So now I need to get most of the space from the sda3 (Linux-swap) partition and add it to sda2.  I already have Gparted on a bootable USB drive to make the changes, but I just don't know how to go about it.  Hoping someone can help me out.\nThanks.\nPicture of Partitions \n\nA: Since You need to resize sda3 and then move the free space next to sda2 to make sda2 bigger, you're going to have to move partitions around. This can cause problems, but I did it a few times with no real issues.\nI did it by resizing my partition from the left to give free space on the left, but that meant for me that I had to move a ~800GB partition, including the free space. That took forever.\nYou have smaller partitions, but I think the following would be the quickest, easiest and safest way. \n\n\n*\n\n*Start out by downsizing sda3 so that the free space following is the amount of space you want to add to sda2. \n\n*Then, you'll have to move sda3 over so the free space is on the left of sda3 and the right of sda2.\n\n*Resize sda2 to take up that free space.\n\n*Apply the operation. (It's going to take some time, but since you have an SSD and small partitions, I'd estimate an ETA of less than 2 hours.)\nHopefully, you won't have any problems. Just definitely do this from a LiveCD or Gparted CD and not from an OS booted on the drive.\nIf you need any more help, just comment.\n", "Q: How can execute a cron at machine sturtup?

Then, I remove it, it assures me that it was removed. Then, when I install it again, it does not download any files and installs in less than a second. So, by my logic, programs are not truly getting deleted? Perhaps the file system keeps them on until the hard drive space is actually needed, like the recycle bin function? Am I missing something?\n\nA: It uninstalls the program, yes. You will be unable to execute it.\nIt just keeps the \"installers\" (deb files) in the /var/cache/apt/archives directory.\nBut if you have a deb of an older version, and a newer version of the package has been released, APT (Ubuntu's package manager, stands for Advanced Packaging Tool) will download the newer version.\nYou can clean them by running sudo apt-get clean and sudo apt-get autoclean.\n", "Q: What's the best way to install Unity and KDE together? I'm in the process of installing a 16.04 from scratch. I'd like to have both Unity and KDE on my system. Is it better to install Ubuntu and add Plasma Desktop, or should I go for Kubuntu and add Unity?\n\nA: Either way will work fine. KDE is just another skin for Ubuntu, and the same goes for Unity. Both ISOs are the same size, so there's no short-term advantage to downloading one or the other.\nI recommend you install the one you like the most. That way, if you decide not to install a second DE, or you prefer having a slightly cleaner install, you don't have to worry about installing one DE and uninstalling the other.\n", "Q: Dropbox litters my folders with unhidden backup files Edit: I have mistaken dropbox for gedit's default backup feature, see below.\nAs the title says when I create a file in any dropbox synchronized folder it creates an unhidden (no . prefix) duplicate backup file with a ~ after the original name. \nFor example, if I create a file file1, dropbox creates a backup file1~.\nThis drives me crazy in editors with tree navigation menus and litters the folders in general. I would be very thankful if someone could suggest a possible solution to this (either how to hide the backup files or get rid of them altogether).\n\nA: I've used Dropbox for years and never seen this behavior. On the other hand, this is typical behavior for some text editors.

How can i fix it?\n\nA: as far as the message you are getting it really isnt anything to do with your driver issue. it is just checking your disk for problems. whenever you boot this happens normally even on a fresh install. under normal conditions it will not find anything and you will just go ahead with booting.\nwhat i suggest though for your driver problem, if it is that:\non boot select the \"advanced options\" and go into recovery mode.\nhere you can do things to work in your system. since this likely has to do with your installing the proprietary drivers what you want to do is go and select the root shell option so you can work in the command line.\nthen you can go back to your proprietary driver and select it, but add the --uninstall option to the end. this will uninstall it.\nafterwards what you do is up to you. you can go back to the nouveau driver which if you blacklisted it and removed everything like you were suppose to then you need to undo the blacklisting and reinstall it. alternatively you can try to reinstall the proprietary driver. you will need to reboot though either way to see if things are working.\nif things are still broken try going back to shell and using the \"dpkg\" option to try and fix any broken packages.\n", "Q: juju message: Waiting for agent initialization to finish juju deploy wordpress\njuju deploy mysql \njuju add-relation wordpress mysql\njuju expose wordpress\njuju status\n\nenvironment: maas\n\n      machines:\n      \"0\":\nagent-state: started\nagent-version: 1.25.5.1\ndns-name: original-shade.default\ninstance-id: /MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-a20a8d58-12ff-11e6-b60a-525400717c8f/\nseries: trusty\nhardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=24 mem=16384M availability-zone=default\nstate-server-member-status: has-vote\n\nservices:\n\nmysql:\ncharm: cs:trusty/mysql-38\nexposed: false\nservice-status:\n  current: unknown\n  message: Waiting for agent initialization to finish\n  since: 05 May 2016 21:41:23-07:00\nrelations:\n  cluster:\n  - mysql\nwordpress:\ncharm: cs:trusty/wordpress-4\nexposed: false\nservice-status:\n  current: unknown\n  message: Waiting for agent initialization to finish\n  since: 05 May 2016 21:47:37-07:00\nrelations:\n  loadbalancer:\n  - wordpress\n\nAlso no wordpress public address.......\ncurrent: unknown\nmessage: Waiting for agent initialization to finish\nThank you \n\nA: Usually when you deploy a service and don't specify a machine, juju deploys that service to a new machine enlisted in MAAS.

I set the vdi disk size to fixed size 10 GB. The settings say: virtual 10GB and actual 10GB. But when I start Ubuntu, it indicates only 6.3 GB. Basically I ran out of disk space directly after installing the OS...\nDoes anyone know how to set virtualbox disk space to a larger size?  \n\nA: At the time you create your virtual machine you were asked to create virtual hard drive (VDI) to hold your new OS.\nChoose a size large enough to not run out of space and up to max. 2 TB. If you had created a dynamically growing disk (this is default) the physical space used on your host will only be used to the actually need, but never exceeding the limit you gave here (e.g. 50 GB):\n\nOn a default installation Ubuntu will create a partition holding the OS and your data (/) plus a /swap partition. Swap size depends on RAM (you are allowed to assign all your phsyical RAM but it is better to leave some for the host). So depending on your virtual memory size the swap partition will add to the virtual hard drive space needed.\nIn case you do not want to use a swap you need to perform a custom install of Ubuntu (\"do someting else\").\nIt is possible to grow the virtual disk after installation but there is more involved than just a command.

I can't find the Share on my Linux Mint VM. I can find the FS luckily though.\n\nA: The error you are experiencing is because you are trying to run a GUI application on a non-GUI terminal without a DISPLAY env variable set.\nIf you can use a visual terminal (like one you can drag around a desktop), use that instead and try sudo gedit or whatever you need to do.\nIf you are stuck with a tty terminal, or some non-GUI based terminal, try sudo nano to edit files instead of sudo gedit.\nYou can also try running export DISPLAY=:0. This will tell the non-GUI terminal where to display any GUI application windows (Display :0 is the normal Ctrl + Alt + F7 display).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 Search cannot find applications I \"upgraded\" to Ubuntu 16.04 and am sorry I did.

Neither Thunar nor Nautilus has this feature. \nEdit: Shotwell seems to be the best solution \n\nA: Digikam does what you want. Also I am pretty sure most photo management applications do. The creation date of a photograph is normally stored in its exif data.\nDolphin has the ability to sort by file creation date (which is not the same as the exif record date).

I followed all steps from this post.\nBut if I mount the EFI partition in the live system (sudo mount /dev/sdb1 mnt/boot/efi), the EFI partition is completely empty.\nLink to ubuntuforums.com: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2323615&p=13484854#post13484854\n\nA: You have neither an EFI System Partition (ESP) nor a BIOS Boot Partition. One of the two is required (well, almost required) to boot from a GPT disk. If you don't understand these details, you should let the Ubuntu installer set up your partitions for you. If you want to learn more, I recommend you read:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog entry on how EFI works -- This page describes the theory behind EFI-mode booting.\n\n*A question and answers on the differences between BIOS and EFI booting on Superuser.com -- This provides the basics of the preceding, but is more concise.\n\n*My page on installing Linux on EFI systems -- This page is a more practical introduction to EFI-mode booting than Adam Williamson's blog.\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki entry on UEFI -- This page is a bit disjointed, but is the most Ubuntu-specific introduction to EFI and its issues.\n\n\nA: Many users forget to add ubuntu as a trusted efi boot.  You need to do this in the Bios setup after install.  If this solves your problem, make a complaint and file a bug to Ubuntu for not telling you and the rest of the world to do this on the install screen.\nIf you do not add this file to your bios (The bios will prompt you where the file is), the computer will not boot.  This is the whole design of secure boot.  Of course it is useless if you do not protect your bios settings (which is very dangerous if you forget your pwd), because anyone can go into bios and change the boot and secure boot file.. or even better, boot legacy.  If your disk is not encrypted, then it is fair game.\nHowever, I think you should read the links about efi and maybe your settings on the partition are not correct.  You should allocate about 400 to 500 mb.  The older computers only had 100mb which is not enough and it will fail to write and install file later on.  You can google the complaints on the size too, especially dual boots and going to win 10 (!) on a single boot system.\n", "Q: need help creating an if statment that will work for my purpose in .bashrc I have edited my .bashrc to look like this with some help from others on this forum ... Thanks guys for the help on the weather segment of this script...\nAn issue I have ran into is the code for the external ip address. If for some reason the site I use to check the external IP doesn't respond .. it locks up my bash at that point until it gets the information. \nWhat I would like to do is change it so that I can have it so if it doesn't respond in a second or 500ms .. then to just move on so it doesn't hang. I hope that makes sense .. here is the code I'm using for it.\nlocalnet()\n{\ndeclare -a INETARRAY\nINETARRAY=( `/sbin/ifconfig | awk /'inet addr/ {print $2}' && /sbin/ifconfig | awk /'Bcast/ {print $3}'`)\necho -ne ${INETARRAY[@]} \"ExtIP:\" ; myip\n}\nmyip ()\n{\nlynx -dump -hiddenlinks=ignore -nolist http://checkip.dyndns.org:8245/ | grep \"Current IP Address\" | cut -d\":\" -f2 | cut -d\" \" -f2\n}\n\nBasically I need an if statement that would do something like this:\nif the site doesn't give whats expected withing a configurable amount of time load \"line 1\" else load \"line 2\" \nLine 1 would contain the code without the external IP request \nLine 2 would contain the code with the external IP request. \nNow .. I'm not actually sure what is causing the hang .. I don't know if the site is not responding .. or if it is busy and taking longer to respond or if its getting information but not whats expected ... it happens sporadically and if it hangs on me I can close the shell and open it and usually it will get the information .. I thought about ping but ... again .. not sure if the site would still respond to the ping but not produce what the script is looking for and still hang. \nI just don't know how to set up the statement correctly to make this happen or something similar \nThanks in advanced. \nI tried the line suggested by glenn jackman\ncurl --silent --output - --connect-timeout 2 --max-time 3 http://checkip.dyndns.org:8245/ | grep \"Current IP Address\" | cut -d\":\" -f2 | cut -d\"\" -f2\n\nIt did get the IP address but the resulted in this:\nxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</body></html>\n\nI will have to probably adjust the second cut command .. lol .. guess I need to learn cut :D\nIf i use \ncurl --silent --output - --connect-timeout 2 --max-time 3 http://checkip.dyndns.org:8245/ | grep \"Current IP Address\"\n\nI get the output of:\n<html><head><title>Current IP Check</title></head><body>Current IP Address: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</body></html>\n\nIf I switch back to the lynx line instead of curl and use the -read_timeout=1 -connect-timeout=1 this does keep the shell from hanging if it has connections issues but .. it produces errors which was why I was hoping to make some sort of if statement \nNetwork: addr:192.168.1.20 addr:127.0.0.1 Bcast:192.168.1.255 ExtIP:\nLooking up checkip.dyndns.org:8245\nMaking HTTP connection to checkip.dyndns.org:8245\nAlert!: Connection failed (too many retries).\nAlert!: Unable to connect to remote host.\n\nlynx: Can't access startfile http://checkip.dyndns.org:8245/\n\n\nA: What seem to be a working solution is using the curl command suggested by glenn jackman and the address suggested by Terrance. I haven't run into the hang yet so I don't know if it will through any errors but it seems to work well.. the new line is now \ncurl --silent --output - --connect-timeout 1 --max-time 2 http://icanhazip.com/ \n\nwhich seems to be working .. I have launched the terminal 10 times without a hang or an error. I think you guys did it again... Man I wish where was something like this forum for Windows... lol you go on their forums and ask a question .. you get a non related  'form letter response' and then nothing.\nYou guys are great .. I think this has now got the terminal shell just the way I want it and no hanging .. lol I disabled the external IP thing for a while because of the annoyance but now I can have it back again :D\nIf anyone decides to use the .bashrc I linked  lol its slightly plagiarized but I don't remember the original person I got it from when the script first started out but I have been playing with it ever since.. it was like in 2010 or something. \nThe file also includes a link to .bashrcc that you can create where you can add  commands and aliases without having to put them in the main file. This was done because I sync my bashrc across several computers and there are times where I want a special alias for one computer but I don't it available on all the PC's that are synced to the file. The .bashrcc will allow me to add it for one user only.

I'm currently running 14.04 and want to upgrade if the J1900 can handle it.\n\nA: I have had 16.04.1 (64-bit) running smoothly on a BXBT-1900 for a couple of weeks now. BIOS version F8. Initially there were some serious problems: the machine would freeze randomly (requiring a hard reset) after anything from a few minutes to a few hours of usage. I found other reports of the same problem in this thread, and following the advice of one of the posters there I disabled the following BIOS features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Virtualization\n\n*Intel Speedstep technology\n\n*Turbo mode\n\n*Smart connect\n\n\nInitially I disabled smart fan control too, but found that (1) enabling it doesn't seem to affect stability and (2) disabling it causes the fan to run very noisily at full speed all the time, so it's now enabled again. With these modifications, the machine appears to be entirely stable so far.\nKernel bug 109051 appears to be related to these freezes, but I haven't tried out the workaround suggested in the bug report.\nUpdate: the machine has now been running smoothly for a couple of months and I'm happy with it. In case anyone else is having problems with this model, here's a full dump of all relevant BIOS settings and data:\nProject name: GB-BXBT-1900(MZBAYAB-00)\nBIOS Version: F8\nBuild Date and Time: 03/02/2016 18:43:21\nTotal Memory: 8192 MB (LPDDR3)\nTXE FW Version: 01.01.02.1120\nCPU SMART FAN Function: Enabled\nCPU FAN Fail Detect: Disabled\nWake system from S5: Disabled\nIntel Virtualization Technology: Disabled\nEIST: Disabled\nCPU C state Report: Disabled\nSATA Mode: AHCI Mode\nSATA Port: KINGSTON SV300 (120.0GB)\nCSM Support: Enabled\nLAN PXE OpROM: Disabled\nDVMT Pre-Allocated: 512M\nOnboard Audio: Enabled\nOnboard LAN: Enabled\nOS Selection: Windows 8.X\nERP Lowest Power State Mode: Disabled\nRestore AC Power Loss: Power Off\nSystem Mode: Setup\nSecure Boot: Not Active\nSecure Boot: Enabled\nSecure Boot Mode: Standard\nFast Boot: Disabled\nBoot Option #1: P0: KINGSTON SV300S...\nBoot Option #2: UEFI: Built-in EFI ...\n\nOf course I don't claim that this is the only configuration that will give a stable system, but having a well-documented \"known good\" configuration may save other users a lot of trial and error :).\n", "Q: How can I download firmware-b43-installer without internet access?

The easiest way how to remove full stack of packages is to remove php5-common and/or php5.6-common package as everything else depends on it, e.g.:\napt-get purge php5-common\n\nThe other option would be to use wildcard support in apt-get and do:\napt-get purge 'php5*' \n\n\nA: Try running apt-get autoremove.  I think what you are seeing is the FastCGI Process Manager which might have been installed with the core PHP5, but not removed as part of the uninstall.  Failing that apt-get remove php5.6-fpm --purge --autoremove.  You are already running the v7 of fpm so shouldn't see any adverse effects.\n\nA: You can completely remove all PHP packages with this command:\nsudo apt-get purge `dpkg -l | grep php| awk '{print $2}' |tr \"\\n\" \" \"`\n\n", "Q: Move Ubuntu 16.04 to a SSD from HDD occurring error, no ssd shown in grub menu I was using an 1TB hdd with uefi boot window10(updated from 7) and ubuntu 16.04 on it.It worked fine.I first installed windows,and then parted 120gb free space for ubuntu,then I installed ubuntu just by setting installing alongside other operating systems in the installation menu and that's done.\nI'm not sure if the grub was installed in the windows efi partition or somewhere else, because ubuntu just have two partition, / and the swap.\nAfter that, I got a ssd. I followed the instruction on this page, http://blog.oaktreepeak.com/2012/03/move_your_linux_installation_t.html\nand this page:\nHow to move Ubuntu to an SSD\nCopying system from hdd to ssd was ok. I think the problem is with GRUB.\nI tried both terminal the boot-repair, but in vain.\nWhat confuses me is: I find these lines in grub customer\ngrub customer\nMy ssd is sda. As shown in the picture,it seems ok. But when I boot,I can not find anything about sda. All is about sdb(my hdd).\nIn details,I created /boot and / ext4 partition andcopied the files from my origin ubuntu accordingly. Then I created a 2mb bios-grub partition just because I failed with grub-install /dev/sda.(I followed a post\n,telling me to create this to avoid \"this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won’t be possible\" error.\nI did this, and succeeded. But still boot from hdd,instead of ssd. So I tried the boot-repair,both recommended repair and advanced(when using advanced,I set ubuntu on ssd as default boot and set to fix grub on sdbX(my windows efi partition)),after that, I still faced the same problem.The strange thing is,I cannot mnt my ssd on ubuntu hdd(still can boot).\nThanks in advance for any reply from you.:)\n\nA: Can you clarify if you still have both hard drive and SSD installed in the machine?\nDid you change the boot priority in your BIOS?  If the Hdd is still higher in the boot order than the SSD, then it will boot from that first and not even look at the SSD.\n\nA: OK, It's eventually resolved. I resized my sda so now it only has one partition which is sda1. (before that I copied files on boot partition to /boot)The swap is the old swap area on hdd. Then I used boot-repair tool again.This time it solved the problem. Be sure to open a terminal before the  operation because it may probably cannot run during the repair. All I needed to do was copy the code boot-repair indicated and paste into terminal and run and click next, pretty simple. Then I finally boot on ssd.\n", "Q: Horizontal lines in Firefox I've recently got a Lenovo X1 Carbon 3rd Gen and installed Xubuntu 16.04.

I'm wondering if anyone has ever written a cron script that blocks ones remote access (specifically a linux email server that I access via alpine on my local linux machine over an ssh connection) over the weekend?  I'd like to not rely on my own self-control nor do I have root privileges on the mail server. \nI can imagine having a script that changes my password to a random string and then sets it back monday morning, but that seems like I'd have to have my password unencrypted somewhere.  Alternatively, encrypt my ssh keys?\nIf you have insights or suggestions, I'd appreciate them.\n\nA: [Option #1]\nAssuming you are referring to logging in over SSH into your specific work computer - the best way would be to just shut down your work machine over the weekend.\n[Option #2]\nYour script could append the host file and reroute your servers address to local host. There is an example application called \"SelfControl\" that does this, but it's written for MacOS X: https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/\nYou could probably get an idea of how they did it there.\nThis is an old unsupported Linux port of it:\nhttps://github.com/zengargoyle/selfcontrol\n\nA: If you log in with ssh keys rather then a password, one easy approach would be simply to rename .ssh/authorized_keys on Friday evening and return it on Monday morning. Using cron, of course.\nThe downside with this if that there is no failsafe (if the job on Monday morning fails to run then you're potentially locked out all week).\n", "Q: How to run and where to save a downloaded package on Ubuntu? There are two ways to download a package: GUI & CLI (via terminal).\nI tried the first one and can run the package via terminal only.\nI want the app to appear on Dashboard and also to be findable in the search bar of Ubuntu.\n\nA: The easiest way is apt-get, but this answer only deals with packages where you have downloaded something through another means.\nIf it's a .deb file, you can just double click on it. It will open Ubuntu Software Centre, and let you install it. \nIf it's an archive, you should first unpack it. After that, you typically need to install it from Terminal.\nI recommend first getting this neat tool:\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal\nThen restart Nautilus\nnautilus -q\nThen navigate to the folder in which you have unpacked your archive.\nTypically there will be a \"Readme\" file inside the folder with instructions on how to install.\nSometimes there's a file called Install.sh or something like that.\nRead the readme file. Now you can use that neat tool I told you about. Right click somewhere in the folder, and click \"Open terminal here\". Then follow the instructions from the readme file.\nIn some cases you have to compile the application from source.\n\nA: if the package you're installing has no .desktop file, it will not be shown \nin Unity Dashboard.\nyou can always make a .desktop file for a package to be shown.\nCheck these question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I edit/create new launcher items in Unity by hand?\n\n*Creating a .desktop file for a new application\n", "Q: Combine h.264 video and opus audio stream into single video file I have a video file encoded as H.264 in an mp4 file and audio encoded as Opus in a webm file. What would be the best way to combine these files into one mp4? I don't want re encode the files and lose quality.\n\nA: This can be done relatively easily with FFmpeg. If you are using Xenial Xerus LTS simply run the following:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\nIf however you are running Trusty Tahr LTS you would be best to build your own from these simple copy and paste instructions...\nTo demonstrate the technique I have created 2 test files:\n\n\n*\n\n*This file called test.mp4 has the h.264 stream that you want and is in the following format, take careful note of the stream identifiers:\nStream #0:0(und): Video: h264 (Constrained Baseline) (avc1 / 0x31637661) ...\nStream #0:1(und): Audio: aac (LC) (mp4a / 0x6134706D)...\n\n\n*This files called test1.webm has the Opus stream that you want and is in the following format, again take careful note of the stream identifiers:\nStream #0:0: Video: vp9 (Profile 0)...\nStream #0:1: Audio: opus, 48000 Hz, stereo, fltp (default)\n\nNote: In your example the webm container may have only an audio stream with no video stream. In this case your Opus audio stream would have the identifier Stream #0:0.\nBear in mind as well that at the moment you cannot put Opus Audio in an mp4 container but it sits quite happily in an mkv container. The following is the simplest method:\nffmpeg -i test.mp4 -i test1.webm -c copy -map 0:0 -map 1:1 -shortest out.mkv\n\nThis accomplishes the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*-c copy copy the codecs without transcoding\n\n*-map 0:0 select the 1st input file : 1st stream = the desired h.264 stream\n\n*-map 1:1 select the 2nd input file : 2nd stream = the desired Opus stream\n\n*-shortest stop encoding when the shortest input stream ends\n\n\nFor more elaborate methods that will be required with multi-stream files see the link in my references...\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*FFMPEG mux video and audio (from another video) - mapping issue\n\n*FFmpeg Docs: 5.11 Advanced options\n\nA: Since Opus doesn't conform to the MP4 container standard and H.264 is similarly out of place in WebM (a restricted MKV) containers you have to use MKV and hope that the players support Opus audio tracks.\nRemuxing can be as simple as opening Mkvmerge GUI dragging both files in and selecting the particular tracks you want to have in the output. But nobody stops you from researching all the options involved for the command line utility (the new GUI should still have an option to copy the entire command) or learning to use ffmpeg.\n", "Q: Xbox 360 wireless receiver taking up all my joystick slots I have two controllers, a XBox 360 with wireless receiver and a retro snes iBuffalo, each one connected to a USB port.\nBoth works fine, but the xbox receiver creates 4 instances of controllers, probably because it supports up to that number of connections. The thing is that when I launch a game such as Crawl or Towerfall this instances takes up the controller slots and my snes USB controller is not detected.\nIs there a way to disable the additional instances?\n\nA: As for the problem itself, the Xbox360 wireless receiver supports four controllers and the kernel driver makes them all available even if no controller is connected. This could be considered a bug in the driver, but also has advantages such as allowing you to hotplug controller when a game is already running.\nAnyway, as for fixing the situation, the quick and dirty way to fix the problem temporarily:\nrm /dev/input/js1\nrm /dev/input/js2\nrm /dev/input/js3\nmv /dev/input/js4 /dev/input/js1\n\nThis will just rename the input devices and move the unused Xbox360 devices out of the way. This won't survive a reboot, as the device names get reassigned automatically each time.\nFor a more permanent fix you have to write some udev rules to change the way how devices are named when they are plugged in:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html\n", "Q: SSH access - Reallocate disk space I understand that this is a question that is asked quite often, but unfortunately most answers involve using a LiveCD which in this case isn't possible. I'm currently using a dedicated server running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on a host that allocates most of the disk space to the /home directory. Unfortunately, I have run out of disk space on the root directory, effectively breaking my server. My conundrum is that I already have quite a bit of data set up on the server, making it difficult to back everything up locally and reinstall the dedicated server using a better allocation.\nEssentially what I'm looking for is a way to allocate everything currently on the .home directory to the / directory. From what I've read, there's no way to reallocate disks while in operation, so I really don't know where to go from here. My host does offer a \"Rescue Mode\" which appears to create a temporary virtual machine that mounts the current file tree in a /mnt directory, but I'm not too sure if I can repartition the disk through that. It also has an option to \"Netboot\", which I haven't tried yet but is always a possibility.\nI am not too sure where to go from here, so any help you can provide would be much appreciated!\n\nA: Ideally you should add another disk and migrate parts of your system to that but you might not get that option with your hosting solution.\nAs an emergency measure you could create a loopback partition in your /home folder and the mount it for use as one of the other folders like var or usr. This is a security issue as it potentially gives your user account root access so make sure you don't put the loopback on a webroot or otherwise share location.\nHow to make loopbacks\nhttp://www.walkernews.net/2007/07/01/create-linux-loopback-file-system-on-disk-file/\nThen edit your /etc/fstab file and add an entry mounting the loopback in the right place then copy the files over to it.\nUltimately this will probably make your server worse for anyone else to understand and will negatively effect performance under heavy load . This is a bizarre reallocation of disk space, the proper solution is to deploy your system with LVM which abstracts the partitioning of disks so that you can mostly reallocate on the fly.\n\nA: If you have enough space in your /home partition then you can create a directory in some path of your /home partition and mount that partition to where ever required using the mount utility if you are using Logical Volume Manager (LVM) using the command:\nmount --bind <some-path-of-/home partition> <some-path-of-/ partition>\n\nThis mounts the path till your next reboot. However, you can use the /etc/fstab for permanent setup by appending the following lines in /etc/fstab\n<some-path-of-/ partition> <some-path-of-/home partition> none bind 0 0  \n\nMore information in this link.\n", "Q: Move part of file name to metadata I have thousands upon thousands of songs that are named as;\nArtist - Song.mp3\nArtist - Song.mp3\netc\n\nWhat I need to do is to move everything before the \"-\" and add it to the metadata of the file as the \"Artist\"\nI've tried a couple bulk renaming programs, and a few commands, but none seem to work, they just move things around in the file name. All of the commands that I've tried are \"one-liners\", so maybe if in terminal I could cut the part of the file name before the \"-\" put it in a text file and then some how use that?

This process includes installing windows 10 externally, changing the partition table to install Grub2, install Ubuntu 16, and to configure the bootloader to be able to boot live ISO files. This is my first how-to, so please feel free to edit this to be more beneficial.\nUpdates\n05/07/16: Tutorial Uploaded to AskUbuntu.\n09/07/16: Uploaded grub.cfg file.\n11/16/16: Now on GitHub.\nMaterials\nTools Needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*External Hard Drive (128GB minimum)\n\n*USB Flash Drive (4GB minimum)\n\n*Grub2's grub.cfg file.\n\n\nSoftware Used:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows Media Creation Tool\n\n*GImageX\n\n*YUMI\n\n*GParted\n\n*CloneZilla (Recommend)\n\n\nISOs Needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 10\n\n*Ubuntu 16\n\n*Lubuntu 15\n\n*Kali 2016\n\n*Clonezilla 2.4\n\n*DBAN 2.3\n\n*OPRE 1.4\nPart Two - Installing Windows 10\nIntroduction\nWe will be working in the Windows 10 operating system. This includes downloading the WIM file as well as formatting it to the external hard drive to be able to boot. We conclude with setting up Windows 10 on the external drive.\nSteps\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Windows Media Creation Tool with the button \"Download tool now\".\n\n*Open the downloaded executable file and accept the terms and conditions.\n\n*Select the option \"Create installation media for another PC\" followed by \"Next\". \n\n*Uncheck \"Use recommend options for this PC\" and select what options you need, then select \"Next\". \n\n*Choose the option \"ISO file\" and select \"Next\".  \n\n*Make a new folder on your desktop labeled \"ISOs\" and save the ISO file to the ISO folder on your desktop. \n\n*Wait until the ISO file has successfully been created and close the program.\n\n*Go to the ISOs folder on the desktop and mount the ISO by double clicking the file.\n\n*Run Administrator Command Prompt.\n\n*Navigate to the WIM file location by changing to volume and using the \"cd\" command.\nD: Note: Make sure you use the drive letter of your mounted iso.\ncd /sources\n\n*Now we need to get information about the ESD file to convert it to a WIM file.\ndism /Get-WimInfo /WimFile:install.esd\n\n*Convert the ESD file to a WIM file using DISM and save it to the ISO folder.\nC:\\Users\\youkergav\\Desktop\\ISOs Note: Change \"youkergav\" to your username so the path is correctly specified. \n\n*Once the image export is successful, close command prompt.\n\n*Plug in you external hard drive and launch \"Disk Management\"\n\n*Locate the external hard drive and format the drive to NTFS with the label as \"Portable Windows\" Note: Be aware this will delete all the contents of the drive. \n\n*Download and install GImageX.\n\n*Open GImageX and go to the \"Apply\" tab.\n\n*Browse for the source. This is the WIM file that is located on the desktop folder \"ISOs\".\n\n*Browse for the destination. This will be the \"Portable Windows\" drive we just formatted.\n\n*Select \"Apply\" and wait for GImageX to apply the image to the drive. \n\n*Go back to Disk Management and make the partition active. \n\n*Open Administrator Command Prompt and navigate to the external drive's System32.\nD: Note: Make sure the drive letter is the same as your external drive.\ncd /Windows/System32\n\n*Make the drives boot entries.\nbcdboot.exe D:\\Windows /s D: /f ALL Note: Make sure the drive letter is the same as your external drive. \n\n*After Command Prompt reads \"Boot files successfully created.\", boot to the external drive through the BIOS and set up windows just like you would for the first time.\n\n*Once you setup everything set up to your liking, reboot back into the external drive to make sure all the data is clean.\n\n\nPart Three - Installing Grub2\nIntroduction\nIn this part of the procedure, we will install grub2. We will do this by making a live version of Ubuntu and Clonezilla (Clonezilla is optional, but recommended). This objective will be completed by using Windows 10 to create a temporary bootloader for Ubuntu and CloneZilla via YUMI. The rest of this section will be done in Ubuntu 16 Live.\n\n\n*Download and install YUMI.\n\n*Download ISOs for Ubuntu and CloneZilla to ISOs folder.\n\n*Insert flash drive (not external drive) and open YUMI.\n\n*Select flash drive from dropdown and FAT32 the drive. Note: Formatting drive will erase contents.\n\n*Select Ubuntu from dropdown and locate the Ubuntu ISO.\n\n*Create the image. \n\n*Select \"Yes\" when adding more ISOs and image the CloneZilla ISO. Note: Do not FAT32 drive.\n\n*Boot to the flash drive from the BIOS.\n\n*From the YUMI bootloader, select \"Linux Distributions\" and boot Ubuntu. \n\n*Once Ubuntu is booted, open the program \"Disks\" and insert your external hard drive.\n\n*Under devices, find the device location.\n\n*Open the program \"GParted\" and select the device location of your external hard drive.\n\n*Right click and select \"unmount\" on the partition.\n\n*Right click on the partition and select \"resize/move\".\n\n*Resize the partition to 50 GB (51200 MB). \n\n*Right click on the unallocated space and select \"new\".\n\n*Make the partition size 25 GB (25600 MB). Format the drive to FAT32 and label the filesystem \"Bootloader\". \n\n*Click the check mark to apply changes. \n\n*Open terminal and log in as sudo user.\nsudo su\n\n*Select the drive using fdisk.\nfdisk /dev/sde NOTE please make sure you use your device path.\n\n*Activate the drive on partition 2 and write the changes to the drive. \na 2 w \n\n*Unmount the partition if it is mounted.\numount /dev/sde1 Note: Please use your specified device path.\n\n*Format the drive using mkfs.vfat.\nmkfs.vfat -F 32 -n MULTIBOOT /dev/sde1 Note: Please use your specified device path. \n\n*Make the directory /mnt/USB and mount the device to that path.\nmkdir /mnt/USB && mount /dev/sde2 /mnt/USB\n\n*Install grub to the device path.\ngrub-install --force --no-floppy --boot-directory=/mnt/USB/boot /dev/sde\n\n*Go to the directory grub and make folder for ISOs.\ncd /mnt/USB/boot && mkdir images\n\n*Download the grub.cfg file.\n\n*Move the grub.cfg file to /mnt/USB/boot/grub/.\n\n\nPart Four - Install Live ISOs.\nIntroduction\nThis part is a quick and easy way to install the live ISOs of CloneZilla, Lubuntu, and DBAN. Simply download the ISOs, rename the files, and place them to the right destination. This is made easy because the set up is already coded in the grub configuration file.\nSteps\n\n\n*Download the ISOs for CloneZilla, Lubuntu, and DBAN.\n\n*Name the CloneZilla ISO \"clonezilla.iso\". Name the Lubuntu ISO \"lubuntu.iso\". Name the DBAN ISO \"dban.iso\"\n\n*Move the ISOs to the folder /mnt/USB/boot/images\n\n\nPart Five - Installing Ubuntu.\nIntroduction\nThis is the final piece to making the bootloader complete. We now have to create the partitions necessary to install Ubuntu. The only difference between this and a normal install is to install Ubuntu without Grub2. We also need to manually install the partitions for Ubuntu.\nSteps\n\n\n*Open Terminal and use the command to install Ubuntu without Grub2.\nubiquity -b\n\n*Select your language and proceed.\n\n*Select the option \"Something Else\" \n\n*Find your external drive path and click the free space then \"+\".\n\n*Add a swap partition with 8 GB (8192 MB). Make the partition a primary partiton \n\n*Click on the free space again, followed by clicking \"+\".\n\n*Add 20 GB (20480 MB) logical partiton, mounted on \"/\". \n\n*Use the remaining space as portable storage. \n\n*Install the Ubuntu system the the drive to dev/sdc. Note: Please use device path.\n\n*Use your bootloader.\n\n\nPart 6 - Backup (Optional)\nBackground\nI will not be going over this in detail. It is recommended that you clone the disk in case you lose it or need to restore it. This can be done in CloneZilla.\nSteps\n\n\n*Boot from flash drive though BIOS.\n\n*Select \"System Tools\" and boot CloneZilla.\n\n*Configure CloneZilla settings and select \"Clone Disks\"\n\n*Clone the disk associated with the device path.\n\n\nConclusion\nThanks if you followed! :) Appreciate support... took a while to write. Please let me know if any errors or edit it yourself! Let me know if this works for you.

Perhaps you could delete some files or transfer them to another drive or partition, and then re-visit this issue. You could also run sudo apt-get clean to free up some space.\nUpdate: Since the errors are related to kernel installation, it's likely that you need to free up space in you /boot directory, which may be in a different partition than the rest of your system. Please see the answer to this question for instructions on how to do that: Can't upgrade due to low disk space on /boot\n", "Q: Unable to install kubuntu-Desktop in ubuntu 16.04 Lts Following snippet is what I used to install kubuntu-desktop in ubuntu-16.04 LTS \nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nGot error message,\nkubuntu-desktop is already the newest version (1.338).\nYou might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n kde-telepathy-minimal : Depends: kde-config-telepathy-accounts (>= 15.04.0) but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unmet dependencies.

Is it legal to use free Ubuntu server and samba server for this purpose ?  \n\nA: Local, Regional, and Ethical laws aside, you can use Ubuntu server for whatever you need. Ubuntu is free and community driven, so people use it for many different things. There is no EULA with Ubuntu (like there is with Windows and Mac) so you have total control, but you also must take all the responsibility for your actions.\nIE, if your local or regional laws prohibit file sharing (you'd have to read up on this yourself or find an answer on another site), then you, not Ubuntu, would take all the responsibility for your actions.\nAnd on a side note, what you are doing sounds reasonable / ethical, as long as you own the shared data and the shared data is distributed. Otherwise, all I and anybody else at Ubuntu can do is shake their finger at you. \n", "Q: How to remove files with no permission I have leftovers of PyLotRO, a Windows emulator, but I can't move all files to the trash bin.\nHow do I change permissions and delete them?\n\nA: Determine where the folder is and change the permissions using chmod\nsudo chmod -R 777 /path/to/folder/foldername\n\nThen press Enter. For example if  the folder was called BLAH and was located at /home/user then you would type\nsudo chmod -R 777 /home/user/BLAH \n\nThat should change the permissions for the folder and all its files and sub directories to read/write/execute. Then you should be able to delete them. Also be aware that Linux is case sensitive so you do have to use a capital -R in the line and if your directory has caps you have to  use caps the exact same way it show or it will fail\nSince you said you can find the folder in terminal you can use this command\nsudo rm -rf /path/to/folder/foldername\n\nThat will delete the folder and its subdirectories as root.\nIt will ask you for a password and when you type it in it will look like nothing is happening . It doesn't show any indication that you are typing it in. Just type the password and press Enter and it will delete the files for you.\n\nA: Having all permissions as a root, you should use:\nsudo -i\n\nAnd for completely removing files or folders and their contents, you can use:\nrm\n\nFor obtaining more information about these commands (and other commands!) you can use:\nman\n\nFor example,\nman rm\n\n\nA: If you wanted to use your GUI file manager (nautilus, thunar, caja, dolphin, etc) you could use the \"root account\" to delete the files.\nMost file managers probably have an \"Open Folder as Root\" or similar option, or just run the file manager with sudo (, from a terminal would work. \nFor thunar: sudo thunar. Or for nautilus: sudo nautilus , etc\nIf you're using nautilus, the answers here should help: How do I open a folder as root?\nThen browse to the offending files and delete them.\nIn a terminal, just sudo rm should work too\n", "Q: Script to send Email if Log grows past 90M I have the Below Script to check the size of my Log file.\nShould it grow to beyond 84M to should be renamed with the current date and a a new one is automatically generated by my APP.\nHowever it doesnt run automatically using cron tasks.\nHelp me to add code to check if it reaches 84M to send me an email then I can run the script manually.\n#!/bin/bash\n#Andrew O.

Gnome developers have become very ignorant to user's and themes, due to their inability to fix underlying problems with their desktop. GTK+ will refuse to use the entire theme if it does not completely comply with what Gnome Developers want on our desktops.

After booting into the recovery mode (the graphic mode) and unistalling Eset Nod32 Antivirus and restarting again, everything returned to normal. It seems as if there is a clash between the Linux kernel 4.4.0-22 and this antivirus, for some reason.\n\nA: I got the same thing this morning - great way to start the day, right? ;)\nAfter playing around with various suggestions and ideas found via Google, I got frustrated and in my typical fashion started doing things my way. :)  I am not sure my fix is the true solution, however it got me through the issues.  \nIn my evaluation of the failed install (easy to replicate, just install or remove ANYTHING), I found the first error in the cascading chain lies in grub2-mkconfig not existing!  Lots of stuff on Google for Fedora and SUSE, but not much Ubuntu based.  grub-mkconfig exists in /usr/sbin, so I created a symbolic link to get me a grub2-mkconfig based on something besides an empty script.  This created an error because there is no grub2 in /boot.  Another symbolic link so /boot/grub and /boot/grub2 are the same and everything seems in order.\nI see this as a duct tape style patch more than a true fix as I haven't addressed the issue - a missing grub2-mkconfig as it's supposed to exist.  A true solution would me more akin to finding and installing a proper grub2-mkconfig.  But I'm lazy and short on time, so... maybe after I'm done procrastinating the rest of my to do list. ;)\n\nA: The 'solution' is to uninstall nod32 before kernel/nvidia update.\nIt's a bad solution but works - blame eset devs.\nI recommend contacting their tech support.\nThis thread contains the same 'solution'\nhttps://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2329082&page=7\n", "Q: Not properly using Physical memory How do I get ubuntu to make use of the swap file. It doesn't even use the full physical memory, it only uses 1.3 Gb of 8 Gb, and it doesn't make use of the swap file at all, even when it has detected that there is a swap file there.\n\nA: If Ubuntu's only using 1.3GB of your 8GB of RAM, it probably doesn't need to use a swapfile. \nIs there any reason you want it to? RAM is usually faster, I think.\nIf you start using more RAM, there's no need to worry -- Ubuntu will use swap space as needed.\n", "Q: Receiving Email Problem from outside in Elastix I've already installed elastix 3 stable version (postfix, cyrus sasl2).\nI'm using as email server in my local network. here everything works as the bellow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Send    Email from Local To Local      = OK!\n\n*Send    Email from Local To Outside    = OK!\n\n*Receive Email (that Sent from Local)   = OK!\n\n*Receive Email (that Sent from Outside) = NO!  ***\n\n\nIn fact the just problem i couldn't get email that send from outside in my inbox however i can already receive the mails that sent from local network in my inbox.\nI'm afraid whats the wrong with the problem. but I would appreciate if anyone can help me during this problem. the master.cf and main.cf file are also as the bellow, I don't know if i should any other configuration.\nalso note that it seems my ISP Blocks port 25, so Im using another port as smtp.\netc/postfix/Main.cf (almost without comment)\n    queue_directory = /var/spool/postfix\n    command_directory = /usr/sbin\n    daemon_directory = /usr/libexec/postfix\n    data_directory = /var/lib/postfix\n    mail_owner = postfix\n    myhostname = mail.cqnordica.com\n    mydomain = cqnordica.com\n    myorigin = $mydomain\n    inet_interfaces = all\n    mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost\n    unknown_local_recipient_reject_code = 550\n    mynetworks_style = class\n    mynetworks = 192.168.0.0/24, 127.0.0.0/8\n    debug_peer_level = 2\n    debugger_command =\n     PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin\n     ddd $daemon_directory/$process_name $process_id & sleep 5\n    sendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail.postfix\n    newaliases_path = /usr/bin/newaliases.postfix\n    mailq_path = /usr/bin/mailq.postfix\n    setgid_group = postdrop\n    html_directory = no\n    manpage_directory = /usr/share/man\n    sample_directory = /usr/share/doc/postfix-2.5.6/samples\n    readme_directory = /usr/share/doc/postfix-2.5.6/README_FILES\n    virtual_transport = lmtp:unix:/var/lib/imap/socket/lmtp\n    virtual_mailbox_domains = cqnordica.com\n    # added by myself \n    smtpd_sasl_path = smtpd\n    smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes\n    smtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous\n    smtpd_sasl_local_domain = $myhostname\n    broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes\n    #smtpd_sasl_tls_security_options = $smtpd_sasl_security_options\n    smtpd_recipient_restrictions =\n            permit_mynetworks,\n            permit_sasl_authenticated,\n            reject_unauth_destination\n\netc/postfix/Master.cf (almost without comment)\n    # Postfix master process configuration file.

The problem is not about mail-server infact. it seems Port 25  should be open for receiving mails from outside. without this, it doesn't work.

An earlier driver such as 340.96 does not support GTX 960M.\nThe newest version of Ubuntu is preferable. And if it is an LTS version then we should be installing the latest point release. With 14.04 that would be 14.04.2 with 14.04.3 being released at the end of August. And 16.04 should be getting its first point release (16.04.1) at the end of July. The purpose of these point releases is to keep the release up to date with hardware drivers for hardware that came out after the LTS was released.\nHow have you been going about installing the proprietary video driver?

Ubuntu users!\nI have a Intel computer running basically as a HTPC machine for years 24/7 and at a certain point in time the Linux kernel started to use the intel_pstate driver for my i7 Ivy Bridge (I chose such a high-end CPU to an HTPC because it was the most power efficient in lower frequencies). Since then, I lost the ability to fix the CPU frequency in indicator-cpufreq and as this machine stays on all the time I have a higher power consumption than I wanted.\nI tried to fix that a few times without success, setting /sys stuff manually included, but in my last try I could finally lower the max frequency using cpupower:\ncpupower frequency-set -u clock_freq\n\nMy question is: Whats is the best way to run this at boot time in Ubuntu 16.04?\nSimilar questions I found:\nHow to permanently set CPU power management to the powersave governor? - CPUFreq is considered deprecated and don't change CPU frequencies with intel_pstate\nHow to make cpupower not reset after each restart? - This is very close, but since Ubuntu 16.04 uses systemd it doesn't seem appropriate to me to create a legacy SysV service (I don't even know if it works).\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling - Arch seems to have a cpupower.service systemd unit, but I failed to find it in Ubuntu.\n\nA: If you still need help, then you can do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*add your code to /etc/rc.local (before exit 0), then enter the command sudo systemctl enable rc-local.service and reboot\n\n*create a systemd service\n", "Q: Can't access another Ubuntu on WAN. ssh,ping,tracepath,nmap all fail.

I want to install xfce4 desktop environment with minimal install. I want to install what I want myself.\nThank you in advance. \n\nA: You can download the minimal Ubuntu image from the following page (which also has instructions): \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\nYou'll probably want the 16.04 64-bit image, unless you know you need a different version.\nBurn it to a DVD or make a USB stick exactly how you would with any other Ubuntu image. Then reboot your computer with the media in the drive, and the text-based installer should start.\nThe installer does work with most wireless hardware, but it's possible that you will need to plug in an Ethernet cable, if your wireless card isn't properly detected or if you can't connect to your wireless network.\nThe installer will have a step where you choose installation packages, including desktop environments; you can unselect all desktop environments and choose \"Manual package selection\" instead. \nAfter the installation is complete, the command-line program \"aptitude\" (sudo aptitude) can also come in handy for installing packages from the command line, resolving dependency issues, etc. I go into its preference menu (F10 activates the menu) and de-select \"consider recommended packages as dependencies\" for even less bloat.\nThe keys in aptitude are vim-like, and might be unfamiliar, but the menus are pretty user-friendly. u updates the package list, + marks a package for installation, - un-marks a package for installation (or marks it for removal), and g applies changes. U marks all upgradeable packages for upgrade. q exits the current screen to go back to the previous one. Actions -> Cancel All Pending Actions will undo all package markings, in case you selected too many and just want to start from a clean slate.\nThen install the appropriate \"xfce4-\" packages, depending on what you'd like.\nThis guide might be useful, as well: https://xpressubuntu.wordpress.com/2014/02/22/how-to-install-a-minimal-ubuntu-desktop/\nI hope this helps!

For some reason, Network Manager wasn't installed by default, and after running dist-upgrade and then rebooting, I had no network.\nI followed the steps at this blog to get it working again. Essentially, the mapping for eth0 had become corrupted. Normally, Network Manager can automatically fix this, but without it, you have to do it yourself. To do that, I first ran:\nsudo networkctl\n\nwhich showed me all my network interfaces like lo, wlan0 and something called enc238897s9879c3, which is actually supposed to be eth0.\nTo correct the mapping, I ran:\nsudo ip link set enc238897s9879c3 name eth0\nsudo systemctl restart networking\n\nand that fixed it. Running ifconfig showed I had an IP, and running ping google.com showed I had Internet.\n\nA: It looks like the upgrade was somehow messed up networking related packages. I did followings which lead to resolution of the problem. I'm not sure which ones were necessary though.\n# apt install network-manager\n# systemctl enable systemd-networkd\n# systemctl enable systemd-resolved\n# systemctl start systemd-networkd\n# systemctl start systemd-resolved\n# apt install isc-dhcp-client\n# dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\n\nA: I ran into the same issue.

Only if you enter the recovery mode after encountering such a mistake.\n\n*\n\n*run sudo systemctl status networking.service to see what happened. It will give you some useful feedback information.

After the installation was completed, I installed the \"xubuntu-core\" metapackage and rebooted.\nBut the system got to a \"Started Update UTMP about System Runlevel Changes.\" message and sits there, with a blinking cursor. I could access other TTYs by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Fx and even startxfce4 (as root), but that issue was really annoying me. So I downloaded a Lubuntu 16.04 ISO from lubuntu.net and went to install it. As I didn't have a DVD or USB drive available, I put it in a backup partition and booted the Lubuntu installation media with GRUB2, using\nset root=(hd0,msdos4)\nloopback loop /lubuntu-16.04-desktop-i386.iso\nlinux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=/lubuntu-16.04-desktop-i386.iso config noprompt noeject\ninitrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz\nboot\n\nBut it also got stuck in the exact same message. The difference is that now I can't change TTY, but I think it's because it's a live media. Some people suggested it may be a graphics driver problem, but I'm not sure. I also saw a similar problem with some Mageia folks.\nCan someone help me?\n\nA: I landed here by googling 'lubuntu 16.04 started update utmp about system runlevel changes'. I saw this same message and I thought the system hanged. But actually I could ctrl-alt-f1 and switch to console. Eventually this thread solved my problem:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2321317&p=13478810#post13478810 In short, I did sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel and rebooted, then everything went ok.\nMy background situation is different from yours, though. My setup is quite simple -- it doesn't involve loopmount. However, it was not a straight install either. I installed lubuntu in a lenovo x220i notebook, booted into a different partition, tar czf the lubuntu 16.04 partition, transferred the .tgz to an old computer (which I can't find make and model for now), tar xzf the image into an empty partition, and set up the extlinux boot loader.\n\nA: If you loopmount, you would see some udates, like FRONT_BACKEND=original and also --- instead of just -- and so on. \nAnyway, I think the new installers have some logic issues with detecting the media, when you loopmount from a hard drive. And it doesn't seem to cp it over to /cdrom but maybe it should have been /media. \nEither way, I recall having this issue and I don't remember if I resolved it as I don't use ubuntu. Either way, you should get into the seed installer if , as I say, you take a little look at updated boot commands.\n", "Q: Compiling VirtualBox kernel modules failed Lubuntu 16.04 I'm trying to install virtualbox in my fresh install lubuntu 16.04 but, it gets the following error:\nanonprophet@anonbook:~/Downloads$ sudo dpkg -i virtualbox-5.0_5.0.20-106931-Ubuntu-xenial_amd64.deb \n[sudo] password for anonprophet: \n(Reading database ... 155035 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack virtualbox-5.0_5.0.20-106931-Ubuntu-xenial_amd64.deb ...\nUnpacking virtualbox-5.0 (5.0.20-106931~Ubuntu~xenial) over (5.0.20-106931~Ubuntu~xenial) ...\nSetting up virtualbox-5.0 (5.0.20-106931~Ubuntu~xenial) ...\naddgroup: The group `vboxusers' already exists as a system group.

Then, remove and reinstall the virtualbox 5 package:\n$ sudo apt-get -f install\n$ dpkg -r virtualbox*.deb\n$ dpkg -i virtualbox*.deb\n\nThe default virtualbox package requires many dependencies.

However, it does support booting directly from .iso files. So there are two options: \n1) You can boot from a Plop Boot Manager .iso (or something like it), then use Plop to boot from your USB drive (see How to boot from a USB drive in VirtualBox?); or\n2) Boot from a different .iso file within virtualbox. For example, if you're trying to install Ubuntu in Virtualbox with an Ubuntu USB stick, you can skip the usb stick completely. Instead, mount the Ubuntu .iso file as a \"virtual DVD drive\" to boot from it directly.\n", "Q: 16.04 uses Intel HD Graphics instead of Radeon I installed ubuntu 16.04 to my Dell inspiron 5559 that has AMD Radeon R5 M335 graphics cards.\nWhen I run:\nsudo lshw -c video\n\nI get:\n*-display               \n       description: VGA compatible controller\n       product: HD Graphics 520\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 2\n       bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n       version: 07\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pciexpress msi pm vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n       configuration: driver=i915_bpo latency=0\n       resources: irq:277 memory:d1000000-d1ffffff memory:b0000000-bfffffff ioport:f000(size=64)\n  *-display\n       description: Display controller\n       product: Sun XT [Radeon HD 8670A/8670M/8690M / R5 M330]\n       vendor: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

If you are okay with just browsing the Internet, typing and listening to music, that's okay. If you want to play games, unfortunately you won't be, since the drivers provided are just enough for lightweight stuff. \nCanonical say: “AMD won’t support fglrx on 16.04, period”.

I am just using a specific library which does not compile correctly if I don't use the \"sudo arduino\" command to open my IDE (not sure why).\nSince I need to always open the terminal, I was wondering if it is possible to create a .desktop file (or a .sh maybe?) that I can just click and will run the \"sudo arduino\" IDE. I want to avoid opening the terminal every time, if possible.\nThanks in advance!\n\nUpdate 1 ---------------------------------------\n\nI am not interested in just avoiding using the sudo command when launching the IDE from the terminal (so instead of writing \"sudo arduion\" to write \"arduino\"). What I want is to avoid using the terminal all together, and have an icon on my desktop that when clicked will run the arduino IDE similarly to going in the terminal and writing \"sudo arduino\".\n\nA: Suggesting this is a dupe assumes adding Arduino to the sudoers file is a good idea, which it isn't. Never add an application that potentially ruins your system, or edits code to ruin your system to the sudoers file, simply because it as a security risk.\nOnly add applications or scripts to the sudoers file if:\n\n\n*\n\n*the code cannot be edited (stored in a location that requires administrator's permission to write on), and \n\n*the application does not have the potention to edit code of other applications or scripts.\nWhat to do in this case\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the existing .desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications: \ncp /usr/share/applications/arduino.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\n\n\n*Open the file with gedit: \ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/arduino.desktop\n\nand add a section at the bottom of the file:\nActions=Arduino IDE with sudo;\n\n[Desktop Action Arduino IDE with sudo]\nName=Arduino IDE with sudo\nExec=gksu arduino\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nNow arduino runs \"normally\" when you click on it, but has the right-click option to run with sudo:\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have gksu installed (on 16.04, it is pre-installed), you need to run first:\nsudo apt-get install gksu\n\n\n*You probably need to log out /in for the edited launcher to be effective.\n\n\nAlternatively\nIf you don't want the Arduino icon locked to the launcher, add the command as a keyboard shortcut: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\ngksu arduino\n\nto a shortcut of your choice.\n\nA: Copy the .desktop file and edit the copy with gedit (or any text editor), i.e. by opening the editor and dropping the file into the editors window. You will see a line beginning with Exec=, something like Exec=/path/arduino. This line needs to be modified accordingly, then save the changes.\nIf you want to read more about desktop files I recommend:\nQuestion: Making .desktop files - Just a few questions\nSpecification of Desktop files: https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/index.html\nStart with sudo rights by typing a password\nInstall gksu using the command sudo apt-get install gksu.\nNow, use gksu instead of sudo (Exec=gksu /path/arduino) and you will be prompted with a password input field like gparted does, when you are starting via the desktop file.\n", "Q: Full man pages index Is there an index of all the man pages that exist?\nI know I should not want to learn them all, but I would like to at least take a snapshot view of each of all the man pages that exist.

My computer keeps switching the audio device from \"headphones\" to \"speakers\", even though the headphones aren't plugged in. I rebooted the computer but the problem kept happening even while the computer was rebooting. It causes the speakers to make an annoying clicking noise whenever it switches from \"headphones\" to \"speakers\", and vice versa. It happens in bursts where it will switch multiple times in a small period of time, then wait a bit before starting up again. I've tried to plug a pair of headphones in to stop the problem but that did no good. Can some one help me out here?\n-Seribro Sorrens\n\nA: I have no information on what is causing your sound device continuously switching between headphones and speakers but there is a way to prevent it. If you use this method you will have to manually switch sound device between headphones and speakers when you need them.\nTo override automatic sound device switching:\n\n*\n\n*edit the file /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\n*find the line load-module module-switch-on-port-available\n\n*insert a # at the beginning of the line to disable automatic port switching\n\n*save the file and reboot.\n\n", "Q: Connecting to Private Internet Access server using OpenVPN and Ubuntu 16.04 server Can someone please give me a guide to setup a vpn connection (that connects on startup) using openvpn and ubuntu 16.04 server. all the guides on the internet are wrong, outdated, or just don't work. i have an account with private internet access and i just want to setup a connection. something i feel should be very simple but i lack the experience needed as this is my first server and I'm still learning. \n\nA: Start by downloading this: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/openvpn/openvpn.zip and extract it somewhere.\nThat archive contains 3 important files: ca.crt, crl.pem and YourServer.ovpn (e.g. Germany.ovpn), copy those to /etc/openvpn/.

Out of curiosity, I typed both into the Terminal and I haven't found a difference between the two. Is there a difference, is  yes, what is it? If not, why are there two packages.\n\nA: Canonical, the makers of Ubuntu, created the Ubuntu Software Center (software-center) as a user-friendly way to discover and install apt packages (friendlier than Synaptic, which was the package manager at the time).\nThen the GNOME project thought, \"hey, that's a really good idea. Let's make a software center for GNOME. It'll follow our own user-interface principles, and it'll work on all sorts of different Linux distributions, not just Ubuntu.\" Over time, they created the GNOME Software Center (i.e. gnome-software). (Now that I think of it, it's possible the Gnome Software Center already existed first, but Canonical rejected it for whatever reasons, deciding to write its own version instead. I think they were criticized over that decision, but it's their right.)\nBoth Software Centers existed for a while, but then Canonical changed their minds and decided it was silly to have two teams working on such similar projects. So in the latest Ubuntu release they have totally discontinued the Ubuntu Software Center in favor of using the GNOME Software Center. This will remain the default software center in the forseeable future of Ubuntu releases, and Canonical will work to improve the code and integrate it with Ubuntu.\nHowever, many users who upgraded their installations to 16.04 from an older version (rather than doing a fresh install) now have both software centers, since the upgrader program tends not to like removing packages unless they're not being used anymore.\n(disclaimer: I could have the timeline of events wrong; feel free to correct me)\n", "Q: How to run a program installed through terminal I followed these simple directions to download and install platform.sh onto my machine. Basically I just ran curl -sS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php from my default directory (the directory you go to when you type cd in terminal) using the terminal. Looks like everything installed OK.\nThe directions say to then just run platform from the terminal to start using it. But when I run platform from the same directory the terminal just tells me 'platform: command not found'. \nI think maybe there is some sort of path issue or something. I'm not very good with Linux so probably I just don't understand what's going on. I think maybe i have to reference the program through some sort of path, but I don't know what the path to the program would be. Also, I would like to make it easier on myself so I could just run the program by typing platform instead of having to type out the whole path everytime.\nCan someone please help me?\n\nA: The installer added the following snippet to ~/.bashrc on my system:\n# Automatically added by Platform.sh CLI installer\nexport PATH=\"/home/andrew/.platformsh/bin:$PATH\"\n. '/home/andrew/.platformsh/shell-config.rc' 2>/dev/null\n\nThus extending your $PATH, this means that for the first run you must use two commands:\nsource ~/.bashrc\nplatform\n\nOtherwise your system will not look in the very non-standard location: $HOME/.platformsh/bin. When you have logged out and logged back in you will not need the source ~/.bashrc line again...\n", "Q: Where has the gnome terminal GTK3 style configuration moved to in Ubuntu 16.04?

First, the file $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-3.0/gtk.css is loaded if it exists.\n  Then, GTK+ tries to load $HOME/.themes/theme-name/gtk-3.0/gtk.css, falling back to datadir/share/themes/theme-name/gtk-3.0/gtk.css, where theme-name is the name of the current theme (see the \"gtk-theme-name\" setting) and datadir is the prefix configured when GTK+ was compiled, unless overridden by the GTK_DATA_PREFIX environment variable.  \n\nPrevious experience suggested gnome-terminal all you needed to do was close all gnome-terminal tabs and windows to make new theming take effect.\nAs per the docs, maybe GTK  needed to go through its initialisation, or there may have been a gnome-terminal process still running, requiring me to logout and back in.  \n", "Q: Do I need a server for hosting website? Is it possible to create my own web host service in an Ubuntu computer/server?\nIf so, how can I do it? \nI'm really interested in making my own web host \"company\", even when the only web page is hosted in the server is my own web page. How can I do it? \nI don't have any knowledge is networks or advance computer systems. I'm about to enter college but this could be perfect to start a new project.\n\nA: Addressing just the part about hosting your own web page:\nSetting up a web server is actually pretty easy.  Setting up a secure web server is quite a bit more difficult.  If you want to get your feet wet, Digital Ocean has some really good tutorials.  Here's the one for setting up an Apache web server. If you get interested and want to continue on, they have good tutorials about adding security as well.\nIf you want to host other people's web pages as well, that, also, is another level of difficulty.\n\nA: Setting up any unix-based computer as a webserver is very easy - Apache on unix runs over half the world's websites. Configuration interfaces range from the command line to Apple's Server application.\nBut that's just one link in the chain. People have to reach your website for it to be useful beyond your desk.\n\nI don't have any knowledge is networks or advance computer systems\n\nThat's a problem. you will need knowledge of networking, co-operation from your internet service provider (doesn't need to be active co-operation, they basically have to not block it), A DNS setup that allows for a changing IP address and a few other things. \nOr you can pay someone to do all that for you. The webhosting market is huge, prices range from $1 / month / site and up, depending on your needs. Start there to get the basics under control, then later work on running it yourself.\n\nA: Since you have limited experience, you are better off with a server that has been setup by professionals like Bitnami or TurnKey. They have done the engineering for you. Follow the directions they provide.\nBut while you are still learning, I suggest you would be better off as a reseller for a hosting company such as Host Gator or Dreamhost, and many others.\n", "Q: Problem with dual monitor on 16.04 with lenovo yoga 260 I'm using ubuntu 16.04 with Lenovo yoga 260.\nWhen I connect external monitor, it is very unstable.\nProblem occurs after login and desktop is successfully booted.\n\n\n*\n\n*It freezes soon after desktop is booted.\n\n*It works well when I use mouse on the external monitor.

How can I add this unallocated space to my partition?\n\nI am using Gparted when booting from a Ubuntu 15.10 CD\nI have 74.99 GB unallocated storage. I want to add that storage to my ext4 partition (/dev/sda5)\nHowever, when I try to click resize on ext4, I get a maximum size of it that is not much more than its current size. I. e. the GUI shows a maximum size limit just around 28 GB and I don't know how to actually add the 74.99 GB.\nAdvice appreciated.\n\nA: with gparted you will need to move /dev/sda4 up to fill that unallocated space . if you cant directly move it just make note of the exact size ... then you can stretch it out so it takes up the full unallocated space then shrink it so its the same original size .. that should put the free space between /devsda4 and /dev/sda5 .. then you should be able to expand 5 to the full space .. or very close too it.. it may end up leaving a few meg of unallocated. \n", "Q: Upgrading Ubuntu versions, keep files but remove programs I'm trying to upgrade from version 15.10 to 16.04 LTS of Ubuntu. I don't have an external hard drive to back up my files to (it's a gaming laptop), so I would have to place my files somewhere else on the hard drive or folder. Either way, is there a way to upgrade Ubuntu fresh while keeping my files (like removing all of my installed applications but keep my photos)? Maybe, for example, repartitioning the hard drive?\n\nA: This will be a little tricky since you don't have an external drive to copy your files to, but it shouldn't end up terribly. I still think you should get at least a >32GB flash drive as a temporary backup in case things go badly.\nI think the best plan is to downsize your current Ubuntu partition as much as possible (you can resize it further during the installation, but it's good to at least start) and then use that partition as your data partition. The data partition will be integrated, so there will be no need for manual copying.\nHere's the procedure:\nPreparation\n\n\n*\n\n*Create your installation media. I recommend a USB stick instead of a DVD. There are countless tutorials on how to burn to a USB, so I won't provide instructions here.\n\n*Create a backup of /home somehow. You don't have to do this, but I strongly recommend it. /home will be big, so you'll need a big flash drive.\n\n\nSetup\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Gparted so you can resize your partitions:  \nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\n\n*Open Gparted and find the partition of your Ubuntu installation. It shouldn't be hard to find; it should be the big ext4 partition, provided you don't have a multi-boot situation.\n\n*Right click this partition and choose the Resize/Move option. Resize the partition from the right until there's about 10GB free space\n\n*Hit OK and then the Apply button (the green checkmark).\n\n\nMore setup\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into your Ubuntu installation: choose the Try Ubuntu option, as there is some more setup needed.\n\n*Search for and open Gparted. It's already installed in the Live Environment.\n\n*Create a new ext4 partition in the free space you created before and apply the operation.\n\n*Once the operation is finished, open the file browser and click the partition in the sidebar to mount it.\n\n*Right click the partition and choose the Properties option. Record the UUID or name given there.\n\n*Now, open a terminal. Run:\nsudo cp -pr /home /media/ubuntu/THENAMEYOUCOPIEDEARLIER/\n\n\n\n*\n\n*That should copy everything in your Home directory to the other partition.\n\n\n*Once the copying is finished, go back to Gparted.\n\n*Now, format the Ubuntu installation partition as ext4. Make sure it isn't the data partition.\n\n*Now, downsize that installation partition even more. Make it 40-60GB, depending on how big your hard drive is.\n\n\n*\n\n*You want your data partition to be bigger than the installation partition.\n\n\n*Unmount the data partition and move it to the left to fill the newly-created free space.\n\n*Resize it to fill the free space.\n\n*Apply the operation. It might take a while, so give yourself some time.\n\n*Remount the data partition and find your user folder there. Rename it to something else. username1 is fine if you want.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the installer and go through the steps until you reach the installation location options.\n\n*Choose Something Else... and continue.\n\n*Right click the installation partition and go into the properties.\n\n*Choose to use it as an ext4 partition and mount it at /.\n\n*Do the same for the data partition, but mount it as /home.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that the Format option is not checked for this partition. The other one doesn't matter.\n\n\n*Proceed with the installation.\n\n\nPost-Install\n\n\n*\n\n*When the installation finishes, don't restart. Instead, open the file browser and mount the data partition.\n\n*Run: \nsudo cp -pr /media/ubuntu/THATUUIDYOUCOPIEDEARLIER/THEUSERFOLDERYOURENAMED/ /media/ubuntu/THEUUIDAGAIN/THEUSERFOLDERTHEINSTALLATIONCREATED/\n\n\n\n*\n\n*That will copy the files from your old user folder into the new one.\n\n\n*Now you can reboot into Ubuntu.\n\n\nConclusion (I guess?)\nHopefully, this will give you a full data transfer, but also a fresh reinstall.\nTo save space, I recommend deleting the old user folder.\nAgain: Please be careful. I REALLY recommend that you at least copy what you need to a flash drive. Ubuntu can always go crazy, as with any OS.\nIf you want to be cautious and need any more explanation for something, please ask. I'll be happy to help.\n", "Q: How do I create a folder for special downloads I am 70 years old and brand new to Ubuntu.

The last byte ( two numbers ) stand for the color on which the launcher is based. ff means solid color defined by the other bytes, 00 means based on wallpaper.\nYou can run \ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/background-color \"'#00000000'\"\n\nto make color based on background\nNote that gsettings is preferred for such actions. Both dconf and gsettings do the same thing, except that gsettings has sanity checks, but in my experience I've not ran into any issues with dconf and been using it successfully to alter all sorts of functionalities.\nI frequently alter the color via command line, so I use the following function in my .bashrc:\nunity_launcher_color()\n{\n  key=\"/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/background-color\"\n  hex_string=\\'\\#$1\\'\n#  echo $hex_string\n  dconf write \"$key\" \"$hex_string\"\n}\n\nTo make launcher black , call the function as so \n unity_launcher_color 000000ff \n\n", "Q: Terminal no longer opens (First off this is my first linux download to a virtual machine)\nBasically I followed a step by step YouTube guide\nI installed everything until the updates\nThere were originally 1300 updates\nNow there are 222 updates left\nWhenever I try to update them I get the \n\"you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' \" dialog\nSeems simple enough.

(again, I am just speculating here.) \nSince I had made a change to the DNS servers list (and I believe that's what ultimately resolved this issue) I think it took the hard start to get the new list into the cache. At any rate, the hard start solved it, whereas soft resets did not. \n", "Q: Apache2-mod-ruid2 doesn't work I set up an Ubuntu 16.04 server with Apache2 and PHP7 cgi.\nSo far so good but as soon as I install ruid2\nsudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-ruid2\n\nApache stops to work properly.

I have never seen the post-boot interface for disabling secure boot (which I expected to see and was asked to set a password for). This sequence of events (no disabling of secure boot and then failed login) happens whether I select to install third party drivers (and \"disable secure boot\") during Ubuntu installation, or install them from the Additional Drivers menu, or install nvidia-364 from the graphics drivers ppa. (From what I can tell, Ubuntu is actually offering to disable secure boot validation within Ubuntu and leave the motherboard's secure boot setting unchanged - the terminology isn't helpful.) \nBackground: \nI have an ASUS Sabertooth Mark 2 desktop with Nvidia GTX 970 that I dual boot with Windows 10 (using the BIOS boot override to choose the OS). Secure boot is enabled in the BIOS and I want to keep it that way for Windows at least. Ubuntu (15.10 and earlier) worked fine as the Shim (and grub?) were signed for secure boot, but no checking was done later in the boot process (when the nvidia drivers come into play). Ubuntu 16.04 newly enables checking throughout the boot process, but it's tripping up when it gets to the nvidia drivers. \n\nA: while I did have a slightly different problem (my Broadcom Wifi driver wasn't working), the symptoms seem to be the same. I too had to enter a password during installation which was never checked after boot.\nI too got the strange error message\n\nFailed to request new MokSB state\n\nafter executing mokutil --disable-validation\nHowever: in my case, the problem was I didn't type sudo: sudo mokutil --disable-validation.\nAfter that reboot, Shim was starting and I was able to disable secure boot after shim without disabling secure boot in the BIOS (which is necessary for Windows dual boot).\n", "Q: Can't run/install Ubuntu from USB: \"Error setting up gfxboot\" My installation of Kubuntu 16.04 has become unusable after trying to plug in an external monitor - it now renders a black screen every time I log in - so I've decided to just reformat and install Ubuntu (laptop is a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 carbon).\nI am trying to install Ubuntu from a usb drive, and after trying 3 different USB drives, 3 separate downloads of Ubuntu (2 of 16.04 and 1 of 14.04), and 3 different USB creators, I always get error messages when I try to boot from the drives like this:\nLoading Bootlogo\nbootlogo: invalid file format\nError setting up gfxboot\nboot:\n\nAnd this error screen:\n\nI tried a solution from another question that said to type 'help' at the boot prompt and then press enter, and this either gives me the message \"uncompression error --system halted\" or \"could not allocate memory\" and I have to hold the power button to switch the laptop off.\nI am able to get into the root shell by holding down shift during boot up and entering the GRUB options, but I have no idea what to try. At this point I just want the laptop to work, I don't care about losing all my data.\n\nA: I solved this issue by actually changing the boot order in the BIOS rather than just trying to temporarily boot from the USB.

I am really new on Linux system.\nCan you help me to install \"Not Installed\" packages ???\n\nA: You think now surely there are left out packages in your system, but that isn't true, your system is fully operational. This output means only there are more known packages you can install if you want. There is no need to install all and everything. \n\nA: Since you are new to Ubuntu , I recommend you to man commands before you use them, man helps you to get the better understanding of commands and various options related with them . For example, if you want to know what does apt-get does , then you can simply type man apt-get and it will give you all the details required and related to that command.\nNow since you believe that your system is missing some packages required for it  run smoothly, open terminal and type apt-get install -f and press Enter. This command will install unresolved dependencies i.e it will install all the packages that systems believe it needs in order to work smoothly.

With existing tools like Deja-Dup\nI have tried to set up snapshots and got trouble following the instructions.\nIs there a sane way to do manual snapshot with BTRFS in Ubuntu 16.04 ?\n\nA: Yes, there is a very good way to make restore points using btrfs in Ubuntu.\nStandard Ubuntu installation with btrfs uses subvolumes @ for / and @home for /home.\nIf you have installed Ubuntu in the default way with these subvolumes, then you can easily make restore points for / and /home separately.\nYou can check if you have these subvolumes by running\nsudo btrfs list /\n\nLet's assume that the partition with Ubuntu is /dev/sda1.\nMake a snapshot of your / by running.\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo btrfs sub snap /mnt/@ /mnt/@_backup\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nNow you can safely amend your data on / (not including /home). You can install or delete any packages, or do whatever you want.\nTo restore to the previous state you will need to boot from a LiveUSB and rename subvolumes.\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo mv /mnt/@ /mnt/@_broken\nsudo mv /mnt/@_backup /mnt/@\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nNow you can boot into the original system state.\nIf you are sure that you do not need the \"broken\" subvolume any more, you can delete it this way:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo btrfs sub del /mnt/@_broken\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nThe same way you can make restore points for /home.\nYou can have some other subvolumes if you installed not a default way. But you can always make snapshots of any subvolumes the same way.\nA useful example:\nBefore you upgrade Ubuntu to a newer release, make snapshots of / and probably /home. The latter is not very important in most cases.\nIf something goes wrong during or after the upgrade you can always return to the old release.\nYou can keep old snapshots for any time if you have enough disk space.\nI upgraded this way some computers from 14.04 to 16.04 and keep the 14.04 snapshots in case there are some problems with 16.04. It takes a minute to boot into 14.04 this way.\nYou can  also setup grub a way that you can boot into one or another snapshot using grub menu.

My son (then I) stupidly chose to upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04 using the LiveUpdate. It went pear-shaped! I will not describe my ordeals but I will jump to my final predicament. I have downloaded an iso installation file of Ubuntu 16.04 and have repeatedly attempted to install with the option of \"erase disc & install Ubuntu 16.04\" (having long given up hope of getting to the Windows partition which we hardly ever used). Everything goes well until just after the screen where you define your username & password. Ubuntu begins installing then stalls at the same point (about 20-30% into the installation) with the error message \"The following file did not match its source code on the CD/DVD /target/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQt5WebKit.so.5.5.1\" If I try to skip this error, I hit a final screen saying an I/O error has occurred and offers to send a report.

I see the same explanation on various forums. This disc checks fine, was validated when written, & I have successfully installed Ubuntu 16.04 on another laptop using the DVD. So it's fine in my book!\nIn exasperation, I thought that there might be a conflict with the Dell hardware. Ubuntu 15.10 loaded perfectly 4 months ago. So I tried going back to re-install Ubuntu 15.10 (using the erase disc/install fresh Ubuntu 15.10 option). Everything goes well until the corresponding spot in the Ubuntu 15.10 installation, which stalls with the same error message \"\"The following file did not match its source code on the CD/DVD ...similar but not exact same file name\". You can imagine the expletives that I voiced!\nI am totally bemused! My simpleton's view is that two installation DVDs for different versions of Ubuntu can't have the same error so the discs are OK. I am doing a fresh installation of Ubuntu so there can't be anything on the hard drive. I am just about to fiddle with the RAM in case a faulty RAM may produce these I/O mismatches.\nI am left with a machine that will only boot from the DVD. The file system is not recognised by my Windows 10 installation disc. So the machine is a \"doorstop\" and my son is \"climbing the wall\" unable to play Minecraft.\n\nA: Thank you for your assistance. It was a faulty RAM problem. I had installed a 4GB RAM chip to upgrade to the maximum 8GB compatible with this Dell model. When I replaced the \"new\" 4GB chip with the original 2GB chip, everything worked! I presume that the Ubuntu installs \"filled\" memory to the faulty RAM segment (which was repeatedly at the same spot) and crashed.\nThanks again!\n", "Q: Making calibre work with Aquaris M10 phablet?

Generally it worked very well and Ubuntu used to recognise it very quickly but today when I was unzipping a file into the hard drive, after a lot of time it crashed and plus my hard drive was not recognised any more. I connected it to the tv and after a LOT of time the light started to blink but it caused the tv to crash (when a unplugged it, it was ok). The I  tried again on my pc and after some time the icon of the disk appeared on the launcher but when I as clinking it it didn't respond. Plus when I try to use the disk program it crashes and only when I unplug the drive it responds. I really need help, I have some really important file in there.Sorry for the but english. Thank you\n\nA: Sounds like a typical hard drive failure. I would back up all data on the hard drive ASAP, so that all of your files are safe before running any diagnostic software, as it may shorten the life span dramatically, or render it useless. \nI would then recommend running a file system check on the drive. This can be done on your Windows computer by right clicking on your external hard drive and select \"Properties\". Then go to \"Tools\" > \"Error checking\". \nYou may also want to try out the different diagnostic and repair tools on this rescue cd, called Ultimate Boot CD. I've used it numerous times, and it's a very handy suite! \n", "Q: Cannot access Ubuntu server using SFTP. No writing perms? I've opened an Ubuntu instance in EC2.

I had a working version of Ubuntu 15.10 with CUDA as the video driver. \nThen, I chose to upgrade the system...\nAfter upgrading to 16.04, the system loaded up, and displayed the login screen on one of the three monitors.  \nAfter typing in the password, the system fails and does a restart of what looks like either some \"shell\" and maybe X (I can't tell--the screen goes dark and some text displays for a split second).  Then, the login screen appears again, this time with a mouse that is very choppy (like a bad remote desktop connection). \nSo, the upgrade failed.  Next, I downloaded the 16.04 image and made a bootable USB.  The USB version of the operating system runs great--all three monitors are displaying, the installer goes through the prompts...but then, after installing, everything goes to hell.  I select the option for automatic login...and, on startup, I get a black screen with a mouse (that works fine--smooth motion) on monitor 1, no signal in the other monitors, and the ubuntu error reporting message flashes up briefly every few seconds. That is it--no other interactivity.  \nWhat could be going wrong? \n\nA: It sounds like something incompatible with 16.04 in your home directory.  You can check this by working with the console and creating a clean home directory.\nYou can test this by creating a new userID.  You can do this from the console with Alt+Cntrl+F2.  Then login.\nUse this command to create a new user:\n$ sudo adduser [newuser]\n\nThe [newuser] will be the name of the new user without the brackets.\nYou may have to reload the login manager with sudo service lightdm restart so that it will see the added user.\nNow login as the new user.\nIf this works, while from the newuser's account you can work to fix the problems that you have with your regular account.\nFixing the flawed account:\nFirst add the new user account to the sudoer access.  Then from a console perform these steps:\nChange directories to the failed login (I'll refer to it as youraccount).\n$ cd ~youraccount\n$ cd ..\n$ sudo mv youraccount youraccount.store\n$ mkdir youraccount\n$ sudo chown youraccount youraccount\n\nIf logging in as the newuser worked, you should be able to now login as your account.  Now you can systematically move or copy your configurations from your failed login account to the new directory.  Or you can study which components are causing the problem and deal directly with those.\nBy the way, the problem configuration is almost always something very simple.  It might just be a permission bit of your home folder.  It also might be a problem with the ownership of the.Xauthority file.\n", "Q: how do I create a subfolder with the Music folder, please?

Since ntfs does not have explicit permission management on a file-system basis, there's no point in using chown, chmod or chgrp. To mount it so it is user accessible from terminal, you need to use the user mount option, like this:\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o user /dev/sdb1 /media/Elements\n\nYou might also look into the uid, gid and umask options of the mount command for fine control.\nYou can create a udev rule, to do that automatically, every time your media is plugged in. Your exact rule depends on whether you want the rule to apply to all usb-media or just this specific stick. But my link to the other answer should get you started.\n\nA: Ok, I got it. All of the above did not work but I noticed that /media/username  was also out of bounds, which was really weird as as was logged in as username. I guess it all has to do with changing the UID a while back. Anyhow, deleting /media/username let it be recreated automatically upon the next plug-in with the right permissions.\n\nA: you need to add user option to your fstab (/etc/fstab) like this\n/dev/sdc1    /media/sdc1     vfat  uid=1000,noauto,user           0  0  \n/dev/sdd1    /media/sdd1     vfat  uid=1000,noauto,user           0  0  \n/dev/sdb1    /media/sdb1     vfat  uid=1000,noauto,user           0  0\n\nNormally,  only  the  superuser can mount filesystems. However, when fstab contains the user option on a line, anybody can mount the corresponding system.\nOr if you want any user to mount/unmount the drives use users instead:\n/dev/sdc1    /media/sdc1     vfat  uid=1000,noauto,users           0  0  \n/dev/sdd1    /media/sdd1     vfat  uid=1000,noauto,users           0  0  \n/dev/sdb1    /media/sdb1     vfat  uid=1000,noauto,users           0  0\n\nOnly the user  that  mounted  a filesystem  can unmount it again.  If any user should be able to unmount, then use users instead of user in the fstab line.\nFurther reading: Fstab - Ubuntu Documentation\nNOTE - Find original answer here by Braiam\n\nA: Not sure if it will work because I can't test it myself but here is what I would try.\nFirst make sure that the USB is not plugged in and mounted. \nCheck /media/Elements and see if it exists. \nIf it does I would delete it then insert the USB again and see whats in the /media/ folder. If Elements isn't in there and some other folder is .. then the Label on the USB has changed. \nIf the label on the USB has been removed it will mount the USB as its UUID\nIf the above still didn't fix anything check again to see that your USB is not plugged in and Create the /media/Elements leave it as root/root but change the permissions on the folder to 777 sudo chmod 777 /media/Elements \nHopefully now when you plug in the USB labeled Elements it will mount in a usable way. \n\nA: If you left have udiskie --tray running as root, it can cause a drive that udisks2 ordinarily would have been mounted within /media/username/ (without any help from fstab) to appear within /media/root/ instead.  May happen without the --tray option (which doesn't do anything on trayless ubuntu 18.04 configuration, anyway). This won't, however, explain issues using mount as an ordinary user, where that normally works, and the automounted filesystem was unmounted as root first.   udiskie provides one method of turning automount on and off from commandline, though not necessarily the best.   Consider \"systemctl status/stop/start/mask/umask udisks2.service\" where stop disables automount and mask prevents it during subsequent boots.\n", "Q: Request for a guide on setting up Apple Aluminium keyboard on Ubuntu 16.04 Is there a working solution to set up Apple Aluminium keyboard on Ubuntu with F13-F15 remapped to Print Screen, Scroll Lock and Pause?\n\nSo far, I came up with the following solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*In /etc/default/keyboard, set XKBMODEL=\"applealu_ansi\".\n\n*Make sure apple:alupckeys is in xkb-options (e.g. gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options \"['lv3:ralt_switch', 'grp:ctrl_shift_toggle', 'misc:typo', 'apple:alupckeys']\").

The dot at the beginning means it's hidden by default, so you may need to choose \"Show Hidden Files\" in your file manager.\nYour Windows program will be in a folder similar to /home/elpharaoh/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/\n\nA: Depending on your file manager, there are often ways to enter a path and go straight to it. This function is usually located under \"Go\" in your file manager, with a label like \"Go to...\" or \"Open directory\". Open it and enter ~/.wine and your Wine folder will be opened.\n", "Q: tty1 black screen after upgrade to 16.04 I updated 15.10 to 16.04 and now it shows black screen with tty1 instead of desktop.\nWhen I run startx it shows desktop but without menu, taskbar, etc.\n\n\nA: This may be a solution but I have no way of checking if it doesn't work you can always rename the file back .. try \nmv ~/.config/dconf/user ~/.config/dconf/user.old\n\nand then try rebooting again \n", "Q: Corsair K40 keyboard https://github.com/cvuchener/k90-linux-driver\n\nhid-generic takes control of the K90 keyboard, you need to unbind it (at least for the interface 0 of the keyboard, it works well with interface 1 and 2).\nsudo tee /sys/bus/hid/drivers/hid-generic/unbind <<< \"0003:1B1C:1B02.XXXX\"\n\nReplace XXXX with the correct value for the first interface of the keyboard.\n\nI do not understand what I need to put in for the XXXX\n\nA: Before you start make sure you know what you are doing\n\n\n*\n\n*Type the following command dmesg | grep Corsair\n\n*You should see something similar to the picture below\n\n\n*The number you are looking for is the one in the location of the circle\n\n", "Q: Updating 14.04 to 16.04. Can I do it without impacting LVM? I'm not a Linux whiz by any means.  A few years ago I struggled through learning how to set up my 3 drives as one large drive using LVM.  I'd just as soon not have to re-learn or risk the data that's on them.  Only data files are there.  All OS files are on a different drive.\nIf I install 16.04 onto that other drive... what am I going to have to do to get the LVM back?  Anything I need to do prior to prep for it?\nI'm not really sure I should be upgrading... I just see that support ends in August for 14.04.\n\nA: If your \"LVM drive\" contains your $HOME accounts and the OS, /var, /tmp... are on another drive, LVM or not, then you should be okay. Make sure that you select the correct drive when asked during the install where the OS will go.  If the OS and $HOME are on the same drive, I can't comment on your success with this configuration.\nLast week I did this dance, upgrading from Ubuntu 14 to 16. I have two LVM Volume Groups. One dedicated to my important data being $HOME and /photographs. The other to the OS, /var, /tmp and swap.\nAfter the upgrade I did have to update /etc/fstab to include my $HOME mount(8) information. Moved the /home/_install_created_user_ account out of the way and create a new /home mount point for my LVM Volume. Then just addgroup(8) and adduser(8) and I was off the the races.\nAs always having a solid backup of your critical data ($HOME, photographs, movies, music...) is critical. rsync(1) and external hard drives are your friends. \nI believe you should be able to test this out via VirtualBox. Create a VM running Ubuntu 14.04, create some extra drives to make two or more LVM Volumes. rsync your $HOME account to the /home LVM. Login check it all out and make any corrections. Then upgrade to 16.04.\nLastly if your machine has a NVIDIA graphics card or you plan on running VirtualBox under Ubuntu 16 then TURN OFF the BIOS setting for UEFI.  If your machine is dual boot this may make windoz unhappy, but who cares about windoz when you have Linux!  I don't.\n", "Q: How do I enable search for package with missing command On Ubuntu Server 14.04 when I type a command not currently installed, it will tell me which packages I can choose from to install. Here is an example of what that looks like:\n# chromium-browser\nThe program 'chromium-browser' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:\napt-get install chromium-browser\n\nThis feature was enabled by default. I didn't have to do anything myself to get such suggestions.

But it could be any package not installed by default.)\n\nA: I found that what I had to do was to install the command-not-found package:\napt-get install command-not-found\n\nAfter running this command and restarting the shell, I got the behavior I liked from earlier Ubuntu versions.\n", "Q: Touchpad not working on HP Pavilion X2 12 I recently bought an HP Pavilion X2 12 (http://store.hp.com/UKStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=T1E48EA&opt=ABU&sel=NTB)\nI installed Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 and all hardware worked perfectly out of the box, but not my touchpad.

The hid-rmi driver seems to be the problem. Can that driver be replaced, updated or exchanged somehow?\nAny help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance! \n\nA: I figured this out!

This will load and use the less advanced hid-generic instead of hid_rmi. It won't handle gestures and such, but for me that is ok. All I need is move, click and scroll.\nHopefully a future update will fix hid_rmi for this device too, allowing more advanced functions.\nTo make the change permanent I did this:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nAdd the line \necho 3 06cb 7d29 1 | tee /sys/module/hid_generic/drivers/hid\\:hid-generic/new_id\n\nabove exit 0.

Did some search on the internet and found out 16.04 has problems with Synaptics. This fix is what I found in the end, may be you can try.\nGo to TERMINAL and type this command:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\nsudo reboot\n\nThis fix is taken from this thread on Ubuntu Forums\n", "Q: Java / Minecraft \"Error: Could not find or load main class –Xms1024M\" I am not a Linux pro nor a Java pro, but I am setting up a Minecraft server on Ubuntu 16.04. System has 8GB RAM.\nI followed all the directions for setting up the server (which is very simple) but when I ran the command:\nsudo java –Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -jar minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar nogui\n\nI got this:\nError: Could not find or load main class –Xms1024M\n\nI then simply ran (after about 1 hour of hacking around trying to install different JREs): sudo java -jar minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar nogui and it worked.\nWhat is the difference and what are the possible issues by not specifying RAM?\nAdditionally, what is a good practice for starting up the Minecraft server via SSH and letting it run in the background after disconnecting?\nEdit:\nWhen running java -jar minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar nogui I am seeing this output:\n2016-05-08 14:30:35,683 ERROR Cannot access RandomAccessFile {}) java.io.FileNotFoundException: logs/latest.log (Permission denied)\n2016-05-08 14:30:35,684 ERROR Unable to invoke method createAppender in class org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.RollingRandomAccessFileAppender for element RollingRandomAccessFile java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\n    at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\n    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\n\nFollowed by an endless list of these:\nat kx.a(SourceFile:44) [minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar:?]\nat kx.b(SourceFile:54) [minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar:?]\nat kx.a(SourceFile:44) [minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar:?]\nat kx.b(SourceFile:54) [minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar:?]\nat kx.a(SourceFile:44) [minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar:?]\nat kx.b(SourceFile:54) [minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar:?]\nat kx.a(SourceFile:44) [minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar:?]\nat kx.b(SourceFile:54) [minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar:?]\nat kx.a(SourceFile:44) [minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar:?]\nat kx.b(SourceFile:54) [minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar:?]\n\n\nA: Pay attention to case!\nThe m should be lower case, like so:\nsudo java -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -jar minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar nogui\n\nAlso, try putting the memory options at the end.\n\nA: Specifying RAM\n\nThe issues by not specifying RAM is pretty simply that your Minecraft server won't have enough RAM reserved for it, causing it to crash. Have you tried putting the RAM commands at the end, like so:\njava -jar minecraft_server.jar -Xmx8192M\n\nBe sure to adjust the RAM to your limits. Note, additionally, that you do not need to specify -Xms in your arguments. Be sure to also not use sudo, as that opens up the possibility for system compromise.\n\nUsing Minecraft in the background\n\nYou can run Minecraft in the background in many different ways. I've listed a few below as an example.\nMethod 1: screen\nYou can run a Minecraft session in the background using a nifty utility known as screen. You can do this by just running the screen command, followed by your start command. Afterwards, just press Ctrl + A followed by D. You'll come back to a terminal. To resume your screen session, just run screen -r.\nMost people prefer screen because you can go back and access the console at any time.\nMethod 2: bg/fg\nAfter your Minecraft server has started, press Ctrl+Z on your keyboard. From there, type bg. Your Minecraft server will be running in the background.\nNote that I have not personally tested it, so YMMV.\nMethod 3: nohup\nPrepend your start command with the nohup command. After your Minecraft server has started, just close your SSH session. The server will keep running.\nBe careful using nohup though, because it will use up a LOT of hard drive space keeping its own logs. You can avoid this by appending >/dev/null 2>&1 to the end of the command.\nMethod 4: Initscripts\nInitscripts are very complicated, but it lets your server auto-start/stop on boot or on manual invocation. Instructions are available online. There are many good methods, but they need to be tailored to your system.\n\nPermission Errors\n\nYour permissions problem is because Minecraft created all of its files as root. Therefore only root can access them. Fix this by running sudo chown -R $USER:$USER . in the Minecraft folder.\nSource: Sysadmin for a Minecraft network\n\nA: Hyphen – instead of minus -\nFollowing the comment of @dessert, it seems like you used hyphen – (U+02010) instead of minus - (U+02212). Both are different characters, and Java doesn't escape when called with –. It's the reason it interprets –Xms1024M as an argument (file/class name), even though you meant for it to be an option.\nsudo java -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -jar minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar nogui\n\nJava does allow the use of both m and M for the memory arguments. The amount of RAM you provide the server with is enough to run it. In case it wasn't (or you use all of it by generating chunks really fast, for example), Java would have thrown a heap error instead.\nHope this helps future readers.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 16.04 - fsck running - prevent login Is it normal that Ubuntu prevents me to login when it's running fsck?\nWhen I input my user and password it shows me this message:\n/dev/sda1: clean, 281922/7077888 files, 6496532/28293888\n\nThen come back to login screen.\n\nUPDATE\nI've just remenbered that I've changed AMD video community driver by proprietary driver, maybe is it the problem?!\nWhat should I do?

Thanks..\n\nA: You probably received a newer kernel version in an update. After the requested reboot, you must recompile:\ncd ~/Desktop/MT7630E\n\nOr wherever you cloned the package, if not your desktop\nmake clean\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe mt76xx\n\nYour wireless should again be working.\n", "Q: Is there an editor for Octave with a \"Run\" button? In Matlab, there is a built-in code editor with a \"Run\" button (with shortcut key F5) to run scripts. I'm looking for similar functionality in Octave; so far, I've only been able to run scripts by switching from the code editor (I use gedit) to the command line window and entering the name of the script.\nDoes such a code editor exist for Octave?\n\nA: The newest version of octave has a full GUI similar to MATLAB. Assuming octave is already installed you can move onto the newest stable octave version by running:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:octave/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf you open octave now it should look like this:\n", "Q: How to tell if current version was upgraded or a fresh install I have a number of installation of ubuntu 16.04.  Some of them were upgraded from a previous version.

Whether I connect the Win7 or Ubuntu HD as the primary one, I do not see the other HD in the UEFI boot menu even though it's physically connected to the motherboard. Both OS's recognize the drives after booting (e.g., I get a drive menu button on the taskbar in Ubuntu). My goal is to dual boot without manually plugging and unplugging the drives.\nBootinfoscript result\n\nA: If you are using UEFI boot make sure your partition table GPT formatted. You did not mention which bootloader you are using, but you should update the grub. sudo update-grub. \nI found this on microsoft site:\n\nWhen you deploy Windows® to a UEFI-based PC, you must format the hard drive that includes the Windows partition by using a GUID partition table (GPT) file system. Additional drives may use either the GPT or the master boot record (MBR) file format.\n\nSo yes, you probably need to convert your partition from MBR to GPT. But before you start it you check this below:\nI did some google search and I found this. It may help you. Further instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*turn off \"fastboot\" in Windows 8 \n\n*disable \"Secure Boot\" in the BIOS\n\n*update grub\n\n\nEnter in BIOS. You should see both SDD in the boot sequence list.\nIf you can't find both of them, you should update your BIOS.\nAfter the update you still can't find them, may your SSD is fragmented or your motherboard has driver issue.\n\nA: It should be possible to configure GRUB to chainload to the Windows boot loader. If you installed Ubuntu after Windows and if both drives were plugged in when you did that, this should have been set up automatically. If either of those conditions was not met, you should be able to fix it as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect both hard disks.\n\n*Boot to Ubuntu\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*Type sudo update-grub.\n\n\nThis should update the GRUB menu to get both OSes in the GRUB menu, which should appear the next time you reboot.\n\nA: I'm not sure why this is the case, but if I use F2 to get to the BIOS and then look at what drive I can boot, I only see the Windows one, as I've said in my question. However, I have found that if I hold shift during boot-up and then press F11, I can choose either drive.\n", "Q: I found the installer, but how do I find the installed software, please?

This will give you a new address more often than not.  To rectify this, get the MAC address of your VM's virtual NIC with ip link.  Then, take that MAC address to your router, and set ip a DHCP MAC/IP reservation (the nomenclature may vary depending on the make and model of your router) to assign it an IP that will neither change, nor conflict with any other devices or hosts on your network.\n", "Q: Get email notification for using 'sudo' by a specific user I have a server set-up and I let somebody that I trust with a little bit of sudo access have it.

Obviously, I don't want an email every 30-minutes.\nHow can I always get an email just for 1 specific user?\n\nA: After some experimentation, I found the answer.  To set options such as mail_always or root_pw for specific users, you can add a line like this to your sudoers file after opening with visudo:\nDefaults:USER_NAME mail_always\n\nJust make sure that this line is inserted near the top, where the other Defaults options are.

I just upgraded it to Ubuntu 16.04, and am having 3 problems.  Any suggestions for any of them would be appreciated.\n\n\n*\n\n*It does not wake up after suspending.    With the kernel directly from Ubuntu 16.04, (4.4.0-22, if I read right), the fan wakes up but there's no other sign of life (black display, can't ping the machine, etc).  Following suggestions from https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1574125 that looked similar, I tried upgrading the kernel, using http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.4.9-xenial/ .

My intention is to remain with Hardware Acceleration disabled for now.\n\nA: Answering myself.\nThe option at Preferences->Video->Use Hardware Acceleration controls how graphics are drawn on screen, not how videos are decoded. The option to disable VDPAU is at Preferences->Input & Codecs. Then look for \"Hardware accelerated decoding\" and change VDPAU for any of the other options, I'm using X11 VA-API.\nAnd problem solved. I can take snapshots again. I will remain with Hardware decoding disabled until the problem is fixed, probably at the side of the VDPAU driver library (just guessing).

It seems like little problems like these pop up every time I try to do anything. I guess it's just cause I'm new to using Linux, but man, I am not used to having to figure out how to do every little thing. This isn't even the first issue I had with trying to use my HDMI cord to watch some Netflix on my TV - the sound wasn't working either. Had to add myself as a user for the audio. Why I had to do that, I do not know.\nAlright, sorry about the complaining. Just had to vent a little bit. Anyways, the problem I am having now is that my laptop display extends on to the TV screen. It's not very much, just a tiny line on the left side of the TV screen. But just enough to make it look bad. I've tried adjusting the resolutions and everything, didn't seem to make a difference. It goes away when I switch to mirrored display, but that makes my laptop's resolution very wonky, so I was trying to do it without mirroring it.If anyone has any suggestions on how I can fix this it would be much appreciated! I am also having problems with my speakers not working on my laptop, but I don't know if that is Ubuntu's fault or the laptop's speakers are just broken, so we'll just focus on my display issue. \nThanks!\nSide of my TV screen\nThis shows the side of my TV screen. As you can see, there is a small white line on the side. This line is just an extension of my laptop screen. I don't know why my laptop screen is bleeding over on to my TV screen. If I go to a lower resolution for the laptop, this does not happen. However, when I go to a lower resolution, the laptop screen becomes blurry. Is there no way to remove the line while still maintaining a clear image on my laptop?\n\nA: As far as you speakers go on your laptop, make sure you have not got a hardware mute button that is disabling them. Then check any software mute that is enabled.\nFinally if all that checks out, check BIOS settings to make sure there are no speaker settings in there somewhere that need to me adjusted.\nAs far as display goes, try another cable - and acreen shot of what you are experiencing would help.\n", "Q: 16.04 crash on GUI interaction I'm very new to Linux.

Your solution is basically a second yet easier to guess password stored in plain text. Custom authentication schemes rarely increase and often even decrease security.\n\nIf you don't like PAM you can configure SSH to use a particular log-in script for root. It may look something like this:\n#!/bin/sh\nset -eu\n\nwhile read -rp 'What is your birthday?!' REPLY\ndo\n    case \"$REPLY\" in\n        '')\n            # empty input; ask again\n            ;;\n\n        '10.10.10')\n            # Run original command if available or simply the user's log-in shell\n            exec ${SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND-$SHELL -l};;\n\n        *)\n            break;;\n    esac\ndone\n\necho \"You're not welcome here.

The whole point of rvm is so that you can have different versions of Ruby installed on your system \nrvm install {ruby_version}\nrvm use {ruby_version}\n\n\nA: you can use rvm (ruby version manager). You can use multiple Ruby versions and each version has it's own separate set of gems. That way you can have 2.1 and 2.3 installed simultaneously.\nInstalling ruby version is very easy.\nTo install ruby version run \nrvm install 2.1.0\nyou can set default ruby version by running\nrvm --default 2.1.0\nBenefit of usng rvm is that it won't touch your local ruby or its gems and anytime you can switch back to it.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Any good alternatives to Notepad++ for code editing in Lubuntu? what are the good alternatives to Notepad++ for code editing in Lubuntu?

You can coutomize it to your hearts content. Atom is fully free, and will never ask you for money. \nSublime Text is the old man in the group. Sublime has been around for a long time. This is the editor that I started with even before I started to use Linux. You can fully customize Sublime and make it look however you want. Sublime is a free text editor but after 30 or 60 days i forget which it will start to ask you to buy a license. If you wait a minute or so you can click cancel and keep using it.\n\nA: Use Sublime Text or Brackets. Brackets is more focussed on web development with live preview features which help a lot. you can download both of them from their website, they give .deb packages directly\n\nA: If you are looking for primarily php, html, and css, go for Webstorm. It is definitely one of the best web development apps out there that is available for Linux. It advertises Javascript, but it's amazing for all things web development.\nOtherwise, code wide - I use gedit, which only highlights / colorizes the code source much like Notepad++ will. Extremely useful for random programs, quick editing, etc.\n\nA: If you're already familair with Notepad++ I would recommend Notepadqq.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:notepadqq-team/notepadqq\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install notepadqq\n\nNote: this apparently won't work on Ubuntu 12.04\n", "Q: ERROR: This recovery media only functions on Dell and Alienware systems We purchased new dell system OptiPlex 7440 AIO.

Using bless I can see my gedit output is ASCII. Can gedit process some kind of Unicode?\n\nA: When you click on save as, on the lower left corner you will get some encodings to choose from, choose add and remove (the last entry) and you will get to a list of available encodings including various unicode encodings.\n\n\nA: So, I gave Bruni a screenshot for their answer to show what they meant. But then I tested the result. You can indeed select UTF-8 encoding in gedit, or any other text editor. However, unless these files contain non-ASCII characters**, they will be detected as ASCII. Indeed, the same holds if you create a \"plain text\" (dubious term*) file by any method, and this answer has the reason:\n\nWhen all your chars are < 128 ASCII and UTF-8 are the same. ASCII is a\n  subset of UTF-8 (and also a subset of latin1 and many other encoding\n  formats).\n\nI challenge anyone to test this answer; I can only create a \"UTF-8\" text file on my system by adding non-ASCII characters to it, even though all my terminals, all my text editors and my locale are set to UTF-8:\n$ echo unicorns > rainbows; file rainbows\nrainbows: ASCII text\n\nredirecting echo creates a file that file says is ASCII (try it yourself!)\n$ echo ユニコーン >> rainbows; file rainbows\nrainbows: UTF-8 Unicode text\n\nAppending non-ASCII characters automagically changes the encoding? No, just forces file to see that really, the encoding is UTF-8, because it can no longer be limited to ASCII.\nTL;DR\nDon't worry, your \"ASCII\" text files are UTF-8 files in disguise (their UTF-8-ness cannot be detected), and will be parsed as you want & expect.\n\n*You were interested enough to ask, so perhaps you already understand what the writer of this article is telling us. This piece explains more about encoding and specifically, why ASCII!=UTF-8 and why you need to know how you encoded your text. I have extracted:\n\nThe Single Most Important Fact About Encodings\nIf you completely forget everything I just explained, please remember\n  one extremely important fact. It does not make sense to have a string\n  without knowing what encoding it uses. You can no longer stick your\n  head in the sand and pretend that \"plain\" text is ASCII.\nThere Ain't No Such Thing As Plain Text.\nIf you have a string, in memory, in a file, or in an email message,\n  you have to know what encoding it is in or you cannot interpret it or\n  display it to users correctly.\nAlmost every stupid \"my website looks like gibberish\" or \"she can't\n  read my emails when I use accents\" problem comes down to one naive\n  programmer who didn't understand the simple fact that if you don't\n  tell me whether a particular string is encoded using UTF-8 or ASCII or\n  ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1) or Windows 1252 (Western European), you simply\n  cannot display it correctly or even figure out where it ends. There\n  are over a hundred encodings and above code point 127, all bets are\n  off.\n\n\n** Fun Fact: @ByteCommander pointed out to me that file only looks at the first 50-100kb of the file, so if there are non-ASCII chars far from the beginning of a text file, then file will still think it is ASCII.\n", "Q: NTP failed to synchronize time I have Ubuntu Server 16.04 running on OpenVZ (VPS hosting provider), and I have difficulties running ntp for time synchronization.

OpenVZ is another project for containers, but like the others it share the same kernel between the host and the guests. And as the kernel maintain the time, it would be not acceptable for a VPS host that one container can change the kernel time, because that would impact all other container.\nSo there is not solution to your problem. If you find that the time reported inside your OpenVZ container is incorrect, you need to open a support ticket with your VPS host provider. They have to install ntpd on their host and make sure it is correctly synchronised.\n\nA: It seems to be a conflict with ntpdate being on the machine as well.

What I am trying to do is:\nThere's a file, inside of it, there's a line (it surely will be there, 100%) in this model:\nname_of_the_value=xxx\n\nWhere the value is numerical and  unknown by me because it changes between device and device... \nI need to, somehow,  get the xxx value and replace it with another value given by the user via a TextField (I'm using Java for this, it's for an Android application, but it's pure shell script anyway).\nIs valid:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find and delete the whole line and replace with the full line e.g\ndelete name_of_the_value=xxx and replace it with name_of_the_value=user_value\n\n*Replace only the xxx (value) part\n\n*Comment with '#' any existing matching lines and write the full line at the bottom of the file\n\n\nBut how can I use echo, sed or awk if I don't know the value?\n\nA: Assuming the part for user_value is always 3 characters long you can do it like this:\nsed \"s/name_of_the_value=.{0,3}/name_of_the_value=$new_value/\"\n\nOr if you be sure there is nothing behind in that line you aswell could use:\nsed \"s/name_of_the_value=.*/name_of_the_value=$new_value/\"\n\nI hope i got that REGEX right, I'm no pro in this. So the value should be all the time 3 characters long best in hex format because decimal doesn't be always 3 characters long in cases below 100. The second case should work even i the number is below 100 but it assumes the whole name_of_the_value=user_value part is in a line of its own. Now testing this in terminal the output looks like this for the second case:\nvideo@NAUTH:~$ echo \"name_of_the_value=xxx\" | sed \"s/name_of_the_value=.*/name_of_the_value=$USER/\"\nname_of_the_value=video\n\nOf course you need to pipe the output back into the file, or use a temporary file to swap around. You could use:\nsed \"s/name_of_the_value=.*/name_of_the_value=$new_value/\" /input_file | sponge /input_file\n\nSed only changes the output while reading the file, not writing it, sponge saves the output then until you are through and writes the changes back.\nIf you don't want to or can't use sponge write in a second file and then switch them like this chain of commands.\nsed \"s/name_of_the_value=.*/name_of_the_value=$new_value/\" /input_file > /output_file\nrm -v /input_file\nmv -v /output_file /input_file\n\nAs @kos pointed out in the comment you can as well use the -i flag of the sed command to write back into the input file without the use of a temporary file or sponge:\nsed -i \"s/name_of_the_value=.*/name_of_the_value=$new_value/\" /input_file\n\n", "Q: Bash 12 - 08 Value too great for base (error token \"08\") So, I'm trying to calculate 12-08 (not 12-8) and get the following error:\nlet: 08: value too great for base (error token is \"08\")\n\nHere's the sample code:\nfirst=12\nsecond=08\nif [[ ($first > $second) ]]; then\n    let fin=first-second\nelse\n    let fin=second-first\nfi\n\nP.S Sorry about the spacings\n\nA: If you precede a number by 0, bash treats the number as octal.

This will install the necessary binaries to your /usr/local/bin directory.\nAs can be seen in section 4 of page 6 of the PDF at http://biogeme.epfl.ch/documentation/bisonfirstmodel-2.4.pdf, to use the program, you need to provide biogeme with two arguments: a model and a .dat file.

I use this 500GB partition to store important data to keep it all in one place.\nOn the 500GB partition I have a MISC folder. Next to MISC I want to store my /home data from Ubuntu.\nI've followed the official Ubuntu guide Partitioning/Home/Moving to store my /home on the partition containing MISC without problems and it works fine.\nThe only thing is that now somehow MISC is inside of /home in Ubuntu...\nWhereas I wanted them to be folders side-by-side on the partition.\nI'm not sure if I should have specified a longer directory path ie; /home/MISC2\nIt seems like moving /home to the partition, in this case sda5, has swallowed the entire partition.\nAlso the partition no longer shows up as a separate drive in the Files app, next to computer, usb, and cd-drives as it used to when Ubuntu wasn't using it to store /home.\nI hope it's not too confusing, any help would be appreciated!  \nEDIT:\nI want this 500GB partition to act as an independent drive, without Ubuntu directory structures. I want it just as a place to store/backup data.\nSo maybe I shouldn't have mounted it via fstab for /home...??? Instead should I have used  --bind or symlink?\n\nA: Answering my own question with the help of @oldfred and @ByteCommander\nFor my original purposes mounting the partition as /home was not what I really wanted. Reading a bit more about the differences between --bind and symlinks I found symlinks are what I wanted.\nIn the end I had to undo mounting /home to the partion, the reverse of the official guide and then create symlinks for all useful folders in /home (ie; Documents, Music, Pictures etc) like the links referenced by @oldfred \n\nA: When you mount a partition to a directory, the partition's root directory will be mapped to the mount point directory.\nExample:\nsda1: /\n     - bin/\n     - home/\n\nsda2: /\n     - user1/\n     - user2/\n     - MISC/\n\nSo sda1 is your root partition and you are now mounting sda2 to the mount point directory /home/. This will then result in a directory structure like this:\nsda1: /\n     - bin/\n     - home/\n        - user1/\n        - user2/\n        - MISC/\n\nYou can not just pick a single directory out of a partition and mount that.\nHowever, you can mount the partition anywhere else and then bind its subdirectories to where you actually want them. This will make them available through two paths. To make it easier, I would recommend you to place all directories that belong into /home in one directory, i.e. so that the structure of the second partition looks like this:\nsda2: /\n     - to_home/\n        - user1/\n        - user2/\n     - MISC/\n\nThen you create a mount point somewhere it does not disturb you, e.g.:\nsudo mkdir /media/home_and_MISC\n\nNow mount the partition there:\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /media/home_and_MISC\n\nThen bind its content directories where you want them:\nsudo mount --bind /media/home_and_MISC/home /home\nsudo mount --bind /media/home_and_MISC/MISC /MISC\n\nYou can convert those mount commands into corresponding fstab entries of course.\n", "Q: PDFTK, CODE128 and UTF-8 I'm used to fill PDF forms from PHP using PDFTK. Recently, I was asked to insert a code-128 barcode in a PDF. To do so, I created a PDF with several text fields for human-readable entries plus a special text fields which text is render with a special font that represents code-128 symbols. This font can be found here: http://www.jtbarton.com/Barcodes/Code128.aspx. The only difference between human-readable and barcode fields is the font used to display the characters.\nUp to this step, everything works fine. With Adobe Reader, I am able to copy-paste a prepared barcode into my special field, it renders just fine, this code can be scanned by barcode readers. A sample example is Ñ000002HÓ (Ñ is a starter, then is my data 000002, the checksum H follows, and the whole ends with the stopper Ó).\nThen I get into troubles when trying to fill the form with PDFTK. If I try to fill my special field with Ñ000002HÓ it only renders characters in the ASCII table (ie 000002H) and displays some kind of squares instead of the expected barcode symboles for Ñ and Ó. More surprising, trying to fill human-readable fields with the exact same Ñ000002HÓ phrase works like a charm.\nI verified both kind of fields receive the exact same characters sequence (including utf-8 encoding), I checked the font was well embedded in order to prevent display issues, I ensured the XFDF file is well-formed, etc.\nHere a XFDF sample used to fill a PDF form with fields named 'human' and 'barcode'\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<xfdf xmlns=\"http://ns.adobe.com/xfdf/\" xml:space=\"preserve\">\n    <fields>\n        <field name=\"human\"><value>Ñ000002HÓ</value></field>\n        <field name=\"barcode\"><value>Ñ000002HÓ</value></field>\n    </fields>\n</xfdf>\n\nI'm afraid I have no more ideas how to solve this issue. If you do, your help would be much appreciated. \n\nA: At last, I found a solution. More precisely a workaround. \nIt seems PDFTK does not handle UTF-8 characters the right way with embed Identity-H fonts applied to form fields. In order to render the PDF file the right way, instead of replacing a field with a content, simply set this content as the default value of this field. This will make Acrobat handle the rendering process of the form field instead of delegating it to PDFTK. \nTo do so, simply add need_appearances to the PDFTK command line. \nNOTE - The form field remains in the PDF created by PDFTK, meaning its content can then be modified by the user in Adobe Reader.\n", "Q: Why does do-release-upgrade try to upgrade my system to 15.10, and how to I make it upgrade to 16.04?

Quote from the link \n\nThe easiest partitioning scheme, on a non-GPT disk, is simply a root\n  partition and a swap partition.\n\n\nA: A possible cause for your problem is this: Your hard disk is partitioned using MBR, which only allows four primary partitions to exist. That is why, once you create one partition for Ubuntu, the limit is reached and the rest of the space becomes unusable.\nA workaround for this limitation is creating an extended partition (a partition that can contain an infinite number of partitions, but only counts as one). Unfortunately you need a bootable partition to install Ubuntu on, and extended partitions are not bootable.\nIf you want to install Ubuntu you will have to get rid of that Recovery Partition to make room (you can make a backup of it using Clonezilla)\n, or alternatively, install Ubuntu all on one partition, using a swap file instead of a swap partition (read Four-step Process to Add Swap File here).\nAlso, as others have said you won't need the DVD to boot, GRUB will ask you which OS you want on each boot.\n\nA: I'll look into the first problem and update this answer accordingly.\nAs for the second question, no, you will not need to insert the DVD to boot Ubuntu as it will install GRUB to the MBR.\n", "Q: Help on Crunch Wordlist Creating I would like to receive some help on making a crunch wordlist.

Everything looks fine except the modem.\nFirst, the modem connects but the icon doesn't change. It still shows 'disconnected icon'. Old computer shows right icon after connecting.\n2nd, the connection shows 'EDGE' in bracket. On old computer connection shows 'HSPA'. This means browsing on the upgraded ubuntu in nearly impossible.\nLastly, on old computer when I unplug the modem I get the message \"Network - disconnected you are now offline\". On new version of ubuntu no message appears.\nNot sure whether this is a problem with new hardware or with ubuntu. But it's definitely not a problem with the modem since same modem works perfectly on old computer.\nAny idea?\nThanks.\n\nA: I never got to resolve this but took some time to test the modem on different distributions.\nThe modem doesn't work on following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 16.04\n\n*Fedora 23\n\n*openSUSE 13.2\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04\n\n\nModem works on:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kubuntu 16.04\n\n*Ubuntu 15.04\n\n*Ubuntu 11.04\n\n\nI decided to switch from  Ubuntu 16.04 to Kubuntu 16.04. Now the modem works perfectly,\n\nA: Blacklist the qmi_wwan and cdc_wdm kernel modules\nSince you are dealing with an older mobile broadband modem (probably a Qualcomm Gobi 1000 or 2000) in combination with a newer Linux kernel, you will need to blacklist the qmi_wwan and cdc_wdm kernel modules when upgrading from (X)Ubuntu LTS 14.04 to (X)Ubuntu LTS 16.04.\nThe kernel modules qmi_wwan and cdc_wdm are modern interfaces which modemmanager will try in vain to establish a communication with your older 3G modem.\nThe solution consists in using your favourite text editor with superuser privileges to open\n$ sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nand append the following lines:\nblacklist qmi_wwan\nblacklist cdc_wdm\n\nReboot and your mobile broadband modem should work again as before.\n\nA: \nFirst, the modem connects but the icon doesn't change. It still shows 'disconnected icon'. Old computer shows right icon after connecting.\n\nIts the new way - the two up/down arrows don't change immediately, but they should change once you start data transfer. In any case, its an experimental feature they are experimenting with, perhaps to emulate the network icons in the smart-phone world. This and your third issue might be fixed by 16.04.01, but it doesn't hamper your work in any way.\n\n2nd, the connection shows 'EDGE' in bracket. On old computer connection shows 'HSPA'. This means browsing on the upgraded ubuntu in nearly impossible.\n\nYour more pressing issue is this - internet speed. This has happened because earlier, Ubuntu used to give you an option in the network-manager's edit connection applet to select a network type such as any, 3G Only, GPRS/EDGE, etc. but it no longer gives since 16.04. By default its the any mode, so you might be getting a slow speed. But you can force it to 3G Only by using a simple configuration change:\nJust edit /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/your_3g_connection file and change network-type to 0 in the [gsm] section, so you can force it to 3G only.\nSource:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/370465/49938\n", "Q: My bash script doesn't work when triggered by crontab, but works when i trigger it manually? this is the cron entry\n*/1 * * * * ./home/usr/automation/check_rejected_files.sh > /home/usr/automation/cronout\n\nit produce the file but nothing else happen, i added a date log in the beginning of the script so i can see if the script ran or not , and no logging happens when it triggers through cron \nAppreciate your help thx\nScript\n#! /bin/bash\n#\n#\nnow=$(date)\necho $now >> $ASfile\n\n*emphasized text*\n##########o \n#Variables #\n############\n\nASfile='AlertsSent.txt'\nRlines=$(cat $ASfile)\nAlerted=\"false\"\nRecipient=\"mymail\"\n\nUSERNAME='usr'\nPASSWORD='pass'\nSERVICE_NAME='service'\n#####################\n#Query List from DB #\n#####################\n\nRejectionQueryOutput=$(sqlplus -s $USERNAME/$PASSWORD@$SERVICE_NAME <<END\n        set showmode off;\n        set trimout on;\n        set feedback off;\n        set  verify off;\n        set  heading off;\n        set  echo off;\n        set pagesize 0;\n        set termout off;\n    select mmfile.name from file_status INNER JOIN mmfile ON file_status.file_id=mmfile.id where file_status.state='BANK_REJECTED' and file_status.type='CURRENT' and file_status.datetime > sysdate - 6 and (mmfile.type='PAIN008_EPC' or mmfile.type='PAIN008_CGI' or mmfile.type='PAIN008_CBI' or mmfile.type='PAIN008_DIAS' or mmfile.type='PAIN001_EPC' or mmfile.type='PAIN001_CGI');\n    exit;\nEND\n)\n\nExportedQueryOutput=$(sqlplus -s $USERNAME/$PASSWORD@$SERVICE_NAME <<END\n        set showmode off;\n        set trimout on;\n        set feedback off;\n        set  verify off;\n        set  heading off;\n        set  echo off;\n        set pagesize 0;\n        set termout off;\n     select mmfile.name from file_status INNER JOIN mmfile ON file_status.file_id=mmfile.id where file_status.state='EXPORTED' and file_status.type='CURRENT' and file_status.datetime < sysdate - 2/24 and file_status.datetime > sysdate - 6 and (mmfile.type='PAIN008_EPC' or mmfile.type='PAIN008_CGI' or mmfile.type='PAIN008_CBI' or mmfile.type='PAIN008_DIAS' or mmfile.type='PAIN001_EPC' or mmfile.type='PAIN001_CGI');\n    exit;\nEND\n)\ntifs=$IFS\nIFS=' '\nRejectedArray=( $(for i in $RejectionQueryOutput ; do echo $i ; done) )\nExportedArray=( $(for i in $ExportedQueryOutput ; do echo $i ; done) )\nIFS=$tifs\n#######\n#Main #\n#######\n#Rejected \nfor i in ${RejectedArray[@]}\ndo\n        for rline in $Rlines; do\n                if  [ \"$i\" == \"$rline\" ]\n                then\n                        Alerted=\"true\"\n                        break\n                fi\n        done\n\n        if [ \"$Alerted\" == \"false\" ]\n        then\n                echo $i \"Rejected\"  >> $ASfile\n                echo \"file $i have been rejected by bank please take action\" | mail -s \"[SEPA] raising alarm: $i have been rejected\" $Recipient\n        fi\nAlerted=\"false\"\ndone\nASfile='AlertsSent.txt'\nElines=$(cat $ASfile)\n#Stuck Exporting\nfor x in ${ExportedArray[@]}\ndo\n        for eline in $Elines; do\n                if  [ \"$x\" == \"$eline\" ]\n                then\n                        Alerted=\"true\"\n                        break\n                fi\n        done\n\n        if [ \"$Alerted\" == \"false\" ]\n        then\n                echo $x \"Long-Exporting\"  >> $ASfile\n                echo \"file $x have been in Exported state for more than 2 hours\" | mail -s \"[SEPA] raising alarm: $x have been in Exporting state for more than 2 hours\" $Recipient\n        fi\nAlerted=\"false\"\ndone\n\n\nA: Remove the dot in your crontab entry like this:\n*/1 * * * * /home/usr/automation/check_rejected_files.sh > /home/usr/automation/cronout\n\n", "Q: lvmetad is not active yet; using direct activation during sysinit After install Lubuntu 16.04 show the following message during the boot:\nlvmetad is not active yet; using direct activation during sysinit\n/dev/mapper/lubuntu--vg-root: clean, 121574/7168000 files, 1115621/2865544 blocks\n\nI wait 1 hour but don't show the login screen.\nI can login using Crtl+alt+F2, return \"Welcome to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\" in a screen like terminal... but I dont know how continue to can use the computer or fix the problem...

The\n  instructions to perform the installation have been simplified and\n  should take less than 10 minutes to complete.  Before installing the\n  driver, a quick note on how to check if your system already has AMD\n  GPU-PRO installed. \nSystem Check\nThe easiest way to find out if you have AMD GPU-Pro already installed\n  on your Ubuntu System is to query the Debian package manager. \nUsing the following command at a terminal will provide you with the\n  version of the AMD GPU-Pro stack on your system, or inform you that\n  there are no packages found:\ndpkg -l amdgpu-pro\n\nDownload\nA direct link to download the Linux AMDGPU-PRO driver is given below\n  and it is also available on the Driver Download Page. This file\n  has a tar.xz extension which reflects a more-effective c​ompression\n  algorithm that (in most cases) creates a smaller archive than the more\n  common gzip format.\nAMD Radeon™ Software AMD GPU-PRO Beta Driver – Linux® for Vulkan™\n  Version 16.15.1013 for Ubuntu 1​4.04.4​\nNOTE: This file can also be located via the Driver Download Page\n  by locating your card and selecting the Linux Driver link.\nExtract\nAfter the archive is downloaded, extract the contents to a temporary\n  location from which you can install it. The example below assumes you\n  have downloaded the archive to /tmp and will extract to the same\n  location. If your file was downloaded into the ~/Downloads/ folder\n  by default, you can also extract and install from there, and\n  afterwards you can remove the install files.​\ncd /tmp\n​tar -Jxvf amdgpu-pro_16.15.2-277429​.tar.xz\n\nInstall\nOnce the archive is expanded on the local machine, run the included\n  script (amdgpu-pro-install) to install the graphics stack.  During\n  the installation you will be required to provide sudo access, and also\n  to provide two confirmations to:​\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Install the packages, and\n  \n*Allow installation of \"unverified\" packages from the AMDGPU-PRO archive.   The script will use the package manager to install the\n  components of the graphics stack, with a short delay during the DKMS\n  (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) installation. From the directory where\n  you extracted the archive, issue the following command:\namdgpu-pro-driver/amdgpu-pro-install\nAfter this you can restart your machine to launch using the new\n  graphics stack.\n\n\nA: In answer to your post, the answer is obvious.  NO, the fglrx driver will not work with Ubuntu 16.04.it was deprecated for a reason in favor of the forthcoming AMDGPU drivers (closed source) from AMD. Sadly AMD is not supporting the R7 ot R5 with this new driver software. You are going to have to back pedal to 15.10 to get the graphics you wanted befoe updating. Those AMDGPU drivers ar e meant for the newerR9 series cards that can also handle Vulkan. (Sadly ours can not...)\nI made the same mistake myself and updated to 16.04 only to find my card deprecated by the installer also. \n(R7 260x). Until the community writes a mew set of compatible drivers for your GPU, stick with fglrx for now. There was an article over on Phoronix that showed experimental use of AMDGPU on the R7 260X a while back, but the performance is just about the same as it was using Catalyst, not much of a performance boost.

I am also running UFW, and when I tried to connect to Clementine, my Android Device was giving an error saying: 'Could not reach host'.\nThe only way I was able to connect to Clementine was to manually allow port 5500 through UFW.

If your app allows it, you can change the port it uses. There really is no problem with that port being open, technically. Because it's the default port for the service, an attacker may bulk scan hosts to see if that port is open, but that's only an issue if there is a known vulnerability in the service itself.

I understand that it is still buggy and in development, but I have read a lot of good things about it and wanted to try it for myself. The laptop I run Ubuntu on has an NVIDIA Geforce 940M and has the latest graphics drivers from NVIDIA (so they are the proprietary drivers). When I first tried to install and switch to the Unity 8 desktop, I was greeted with a blank screen followed by a mostly frozen login screen where I could do nothing but suspend or shutdown my computer. Tried reinstalling, making sure I followed the directions to the letter, but with no avail. I decided it was probably that the proprietary driver I was using were not yet fully supported, so I switched back to the Intel Nouveau drivers, rebooted, chose Unity 8 instead of the default desktop, and was met with a blank screen this time. Not even a frozen login screen, just completely black. Is there no way I will be able to test Unity 8 on this computer, or is there some trick with NVIDIA graphics and/or Nouveau that I have not been able to find yet?\n\nA: It seems the next version of mir (v0.25) will support nvidia. \nSee bug #1628478 at https://launchpad.net/mir/+milestone/0.25.0.\nThe bug milestone was changed to 0.25 from 0.26 a few days ago which makes me think that much progress was made and hopefully an 0.25 release is imminent.\n\nA: To test Unity 8, it requires Mir support, which is currently only partially implemented in the proprietary Nvidia drivers and at this time not enough to run Unity 8 / Mir properly.\nIn my case I installed anyhow (just to see what happens) according to this link\nand what happens in my case, upon selecting the unity symbol at the login screen and then selecting Unity 8, is that, after entering my password, my screens (3 of the same connected to a GTX Titan X) turn black briefly and then show the login screen background again with the top status bar that you see when logging in on Unity 7, but no menu on the left and windows / alt keys don't bring up anything. So basically you can't do anything (AFAIK) but to select the power icon in the status bar at the top-right and \"shut down\" and then \"reboot\" - at which instance my computer switched 2 displays off and only its \"main\" display switched to standard text-based console mode with the reboot image with the dots showing and cycling through repetitively but that's where the process hangs, keyboard doesn't work either, so I had to do a hard-reset.\nHopefully Nvidia updates the Mir portion of the drivers soon to the point that Unity 8 works, I can't wait to test it out, looks very promising! (hopefully by the time Ubuntu 16.10 comes out in Oct!)\n\nA: I feel your pain when it comes to test unity+mir with proprietary drivers. Since the previous answers mentioned why and when mir will work with nvidia driver, I would like to add that one can test the next version of mir before it comes to the stable repositories. You may add this ppa to test next version of mir (currently 0.25+):\nhttps://launchpad.net/~mir-team/+archive/ubuntu/staging\n\n", "Q: Can't find my DVD drive in Ubuntu 16.04 I guess you could say that I'm a slightly educated noob (I know, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing).\nMy drive worked fine in Mint 17.3, but I am now running Lubuntu 16.04 and my DVD drive has not worked yet.

I wiped it, and am in the process of installing Ubuntu 16.04 in my Ubuntu + Windows 8.1 dual boot.

The refresh rate on the login screen is very low, for the cursor and menus, but for the password field the refresh rate appears decent.

This said you can extend them if they are using lvm.\nIf you are not using lvm, best is to boot on a livecd or usb and use gparted or parted tool if you prefer the command line.\nBy the way, nowadays the usual fashion to partition system is /, /home, swap.\n/ at 20G is enough for most of people, swap the size of RAM and everything else in /home.\n", "Q: JUJU Bootstrap Connection Error \nUBUNTU 16.04\n\nMAAS 2.0.0 beta 4\n\nJuju 1.25.5\n\n1) juju ,region and rack controller same server , Server1\nServer1: eth0: 192.168.120.2 // MAAS egion and rack controller ip\nServer1: eth1\" 10.?.?.? // For internet connection\n\n2) Server1 has 2 connection one local private 192.168.?.? and one connected to main network and internet 10.?.?.\n\n3) Mass reghion and rack set at 192.168.120.2\n\n4)after bootstrap it says can not connect to 192.168.120.2! juju tries to bootstrap on same server1 as MAAS?\n\n\nA: Juju does not support MAAS2 until 2.0.0 beta 7.\n", "Q: gui application to custom regional settings I am installing Ubuntu 16.04 and using gnome-shell (wich is very awesome by the way), i try to make first weekday and first workday to Sunday, tried everything in a lot of forums:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_US\nsudo locale-gen\nrestart \nalso editing  /etc/locale.gen \nnothing works for me,\n\nA: You can try this, this is somewhat cleaner and more robust: it doesn't involve customising Ubuntu's locale files. \nIn Ubuntu, you can\nassign locale components by editing the file /etc/default/locale. \n\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"en_GB.UTF-8\"\n\n\nWhich means: I want software messages in American, but time, paper size and units in British i.e.weeks starting with Mondays, A4, metric.\nSo change it according to your region and requirements.

Hyper-V manager shows this taking around 24% of the CPU, so something is going on. )  I decided to download the 14.04 ISO and create a VM using that one.\nNot only did it respond when I hit \"Enter\" when prompted, but when it restarted and I logged in, the desktop loaded (in the 16.04 build, \"turning off\" the VM and then starting it got me to the login screen, but once I logged in, the desktop never appeared and a crash report started flashing so quickly I couldn't read it.\nThe only problem that remains is that there is no network connection even after I entered the static IP information that is required for my network (a unique IP address, not that assigned to the physical NIC).  I will start a new thread for that one... also, going to full screen doesn't fill the screen, but, again, a new thread for that one.\nSo it appears to me, the ball is in Ubuntu's court.\n\nA: i found that you just have to restart when you see that screen as it hangs on remove the media, even if i hit enter on my keyboard.  If I let it sit, eventually it runs through about a thousand lines of code on screen and errors out.  If I just hit reset then it restarts Ubuntu, and then brings me to the login screen.\n", "Q: How do I produce great quality AAC files under Xenial Xerus?

On my SSD I'm running Lubuntu, the 1TB HDD has Windows 10, and the 2TB HDD has Ubuntu MATE. \nWhen I power on and press F12 I see PC-Linux-OS, Ubuntu, and my drives. \nFor context, I started out with my SSD with Lubuntu on it. Later on I installed Windows 10 to my 1TB HDD. After installing Windows I noticed it did not add a boot entry, however after updating grub on Lubuntu, Windows Boot Manager was located within the Ubuntu boot entry. Then I tried to install PC-Linux-OS to my 2 TB HDD, for some reason I could not get it to work, but it added a boot entry for it (which couldn't boot). So after some deliberation I downloaded and installed Ubuntu MATE onto my 2TB HDD, but the PC-Linux-OS boot entry is still there.\nI'm trying to remove the PCLinuxOS boot entry, and separate the Windows Boot Manager from grub so that it has its own separate boot entry (default). Windows and the two Linux OSs are all on separate hard drives and I want to make my boot menu reflect that. \nAlso I've been trying to figure out how to move Windows 10 to my SSD (which has Lubuntu on it), and Lubuntu to the 1 TB HDD (which has Windows on it). I saw a few questions and guides that used Clonezilla and Tuxboot, but I'm not really confident with trying this yet. I feel as though if I clone my Windows HDD to the SSD with Lubuntu in it, I wont be able to boot Windows due to the fact that the Windows Boot Manager is inside grub. \nSpecs:\n\n\n*\n\n*mobo: Gigabyte z87-ud3h\n\n*CPU: Intel i5 4690k\n\n*SSD: Samsung 128GB (sda1/2/3 with Lubuntu)\n\n*HDD: Seagate 1TB (sdb1 with Windows 10)\n\n*HDD: Seagate 2TB (sdc1/2/3 with Ubuntu MATE)\nBoot Info Summary: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/16338254/\nrecommended repair summary http://paste.ubuntu.com/16354671/\n\nA: Wow, 1 year and 8 months ago I asked a stupid question. I suppose for the integrity of the site I'll give my stupid answer..\nFirst of all, to remove the old boot entries in your BIOS load screen, (I haven't figured out how to do this using Windows, I usually use a live image of Ubuntu) open a terminal and enter:\nsudo apt-get install efibootmgr\n sudo efibootmgr\n sudo efibootmgr -b (bootcode) B\n\nBe careful not to delete the wrong one!\nNext, I had 3 hard drives with 3 different OS' on them. I installed a bunch of Linux distros and later installed Win 10 on the drives.\nSo the issue I had was with Grub and Windows Boot Manager. The problem here happened because I installed Windows on a another drive AFTER the other distros. To avoid this I wiped clean and started with Windows 10, ensured it had boot priority in my motherboard's BIOS settings. Then I installed the other distros after. This way Windows Boot Manager didn't end up in Grub (which was forcing me to go through multiple boot selection screens every time I powered on).\nI hope this proves useful to at least 1 person :)\n\nA: Use Boot-repair to solve the issues of bootloader.\nInstall it by using following command:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nYou can even manage your all grub bootloader entries using BCDEdit by neosmart. \nBCDEdit:\nhttps://neosmart.net/wiki/bcdedit/\n", "Q: Chromebook, Ubuntu and Second Life Alright so I'm a long term Windows user.

This having been said, you will need to login in order to revert the change. So you will need to log into a tty instead of the GUI.\nTo get into a tty use the keyboard shortcut: ctrl+alt+F1\nThis will bring you to an environment that is essentially the terminal you open within the Desktop Enivornment (usually gnome-terminal). You will be asked to log in, supplying both your username and password, and then be presented with whatever default shell you have configured, usually bash by default.\nYou are then going to want to undo your changes, likely by executing:\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current\nI would also suggest removing the ppa you added by running:\nsudo apt-add-repository --remove ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nI would strongly suggest, should this fix your problem, that once you're logged into your normal desktop environment, that you use the \"Additional Drivers\" GUI program to try and install the correct drivers for your nvidia GPU.\n", "Q: gvfsd-smb-browse causes 100% CPU usage After upgraded to 16.04, gvfsd-smb-browse always causes 100% CPU usage.

You may want to try that as well to see if it solves your problem without creating other problems.\nThere are several bugs submitted around this, for example 1 and 2 but they appear to be unassigned for some reason. (Note: I am uncertain if they are the same as my case and if I should comment on them or start a new one or do something else to help developers with solving it.)\nupdate: I have stopped getting this bug lately.

I've been digging around for ages but it seems the only option is to use Windows 10.\nIf it's not obvious - things look tiny on the 4k monitor, it's hard to read. And using 2k resolution on a 4k monitor looks terrible.\n\nA: Assume you are using x-window, ubuntu 18.04/18.10, gnome. An approach to your problem is: keep resolution of 4k monitor, raise your 2k monitors resolution to 4k and scale up all windows 200 %. Detail step as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect all monitors\n\n*Go to setting > displays > set scale to 200% (global scaling)\n\n*Type xrandr to check for id of all monitors.

I know that there have been issues raised about the WiFi. However, I am not sure if anyone else is experiencing issues like this with their mobile data. When my data goes the only thing I can do, to get it back is to put the phone into air plane mode and then turn it off again. This always brings the mobile data back. Even when I am in the same place and the data signal originally was lost.\nAs an example; the other day my wife and I were enjoying breakfast in a coffee shop. We were sat by the window and she had full data. I had none. We are both on the same network. I turned on air plane mode and then turned it off again and the my data came back. It stayed on for a minute or so and then went off again. Air plane mode activated again and the deactivated and mobile data was returned. During this time my wife had continual signal on her Samsung S3.\n\nA: Yeah, i have also issues with Meizu Pro 5 and 2G/3G/4G connections. \nAt first issues was smaller: Connection loss, try turn air plane mode on and off. if not worked reboot device and connection works sometime. Now i boot my device and get connection <1min until phone drops connection and says \"unregistered\". Air plane mode does not help anymore. Reboot sometimes helps, but usually i have to turn my phone off, use my spare phone and wait for a day or so and try to connect to network again. As i posted comment here: Meizu Pro 5 Ubuntu Edition OTA-11 - 2G/3G issue, I have this issue in Finland with OTA-10.2, OTA-11 and OTA-12. I was in Sweden 4 days and network connections worked fine with OTA-10.2 and OTA-11. \nI'll try to borrow a sim card from some of my friends and try to get connection and see what happens.

This behaviour continues until I close the terminal.\nI tried:\n$ echo 'hello world' | sudo cat\n$ sudo echo 'hello world' | cat\n\nAnd both seem to have normal behaviour.\nI don't want to have to use $ sudo bash -c \"echo \\'hello world\\' | cat\", which seems overly clunky, and would make quoted text a nightmare to handle.\nAlso, before anyone asks, yes, I know that echo and cat don't often require root permissions.\n\nA: Not sure if this makes you feel better, but what you are observing doesn't occur in Ubuntu 16.04.  It does occur in Ubuntu 15.10 (which is what I presume you're using...or perhaps something older?).\nFortunately, I have a 16.04 and a 15.10 machine to try.  Under 16.04, I only have to enter the password once.\nNot sure where the difference is, though.  I just checked and both are using the same version of bash (4.3.42).

My current md consists of sdb, sdc, sdd, sde and sdf. No partitions as I just let mdadm use up and add the entire drive. How does sdg1 play along in the mix?\n\nA: Problem solved.\nmdadm have no problem mixing entire disks and partitions given that the partition type is set to 0xFD. Using parted, this in non-intuitive since you need to create an ext2 partition and then use set 1 raid on, which will change the partition type.\n\nA: Be careful with hybrid mainboards. In this case here would not do e.g. dual-boot with proprietary operating systems. You could think about 2 swap-partitions or 4 swap-partitions (of course only one is used, but you have then spare partition for emergency-case). Assumed the hybrid mainboard has a hidden flash-rom (or flash-rom is writeable resp. flashable) on the rear side, then in case there is somehow 2 MB to 32 MB free on the partition-table, then the Linux-User could install an additional Linux-Distro, which fixes into flash-rom piece of mainboard, which is again better than a recovery-partition of proprietary system.\nIn case your mainboard is not hybrid (is then without efi or uefi ?!) you could divide partition in smaller logical partitions after backup.

I use the PC for programming and web development so there should not be any strange software running either.\n\nA: Found a stupid mistake regarding this issue.\nI noticed that the mouse acceleration was reverted each and every time I opened a new tmux split in my terminal.

I got a Japanese compressed ASB-KY4 keyboard while I was over in Japan (so I could use it for entering Japanese text).\n\nHowever, none of the keyboard layouts I configure it with match up properly. The 'c', 'd', and 'e' keys aren't recognised (xev and showkey show nothing).\nAnd of course, the manual is in Japanese, and it doesn't look like it gives any indication of the number of keys (which would help me identify an appropriate layout).\n\nA: As far I can tell, the issue with 'c', 'd', 'e' (and the '3' as I had found) keys is a hardware problem. Either something stuck on the membrane, a connection issue to the board, or membrane damage. I haven't confirmed yet because the screw holding it together are 'triangle' screws - I can't find any bit to unfasten them.\nFor the layout, I found that to be able to input do romaji and kana input, all I needed to do was change the keyboard layout in the Ibus Anthy preferences under the 'Typing Method' tab:\n\nThis was originally set to Default (US keyboard). Once set to 'jp' it reads most of the keys correctly and properly reads the characters when doing kana input.\n", "Q: I can not ping webpage but can open it using browser I have problem with webpage: http://webase.sk/.\nWhen I try to ping it there is no response\n~$ ping webase.sk\nPING webase.sk (213.215.116.120) 56(84) bytes of data.\n^C\n--- webase.sk ping statistics ---\n11 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 10080ms\n\nWhen I tried to add ip 213.215.116.120 to my browser I can see just blank page.

(I'll have to refresh my memory on how to do this exactly, and update later though. Until then, I might suggest to install an app that does audio recording.)\nThere is no ALSA device available inside Ubuntu, so standard ALSA tools like arecord will not work. The audio hardware is managed by the Android audio subsystem, and pulseaudio connects to this via libhybris (the library to connect to the Android HAL).\n", "Q: How to sign kernel modules with sign-file? I just installed Ubuntu 16.04 with secure boot and encountered the same vmware-error as described there:\nmodprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'vmnet': Required key not available.\nOne way to circumvent this problem is to disable the secure boot, but I don't want to do that. The other way is to sign the kernel modules by myself, following this very detailed thread. There is a tutorial on how to do that in RHEL and in fedora, but all of these solutions are relying on some script I cannot seem to find:\nsudo /usr/src/kernels/$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./MOK.priv ./MOK.der $(modinfo -n vmmon)\nWhere do I find this sign-file script in Ubuntu?\n\nRelated: https://github.com/bergwolf/rhel6/blob/master/Documentation/module-signing.txt and sign a module after kernel compilation.\n\nA: From VMware's site, the cause of your problem is likely that:\n\nOn Linux host with secure mode enabled, it is not allowed to load any unsigned drivers. Due to this, VMware drivers, such as vmmon and vmnet, are not able to be loaded which prevents virtual machine to power on.\n\nTo fix this without turning off secure boot, you can do the following in a terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Generate a key pair using the openssl to sign vmmon and vmnet modules:\n\n~$ openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout MOK.priv -outform DER -out MOK.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj \"/CN=VMware/\"\n\n(Replace MOK with the name of the file you want for the key.)\n\n*Sign the modules using the generated key by running these commands:\n\n~$ sudo /usr/src/linux-headers-uname -r/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./MOK.priv ./MOK.der $(modinfo -n vmmon)\n~$ sudo /usr/src/linux-headers-uname -r/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./MOK.priv ./MOK.der\n  $ (modinfo -n vmnet)\n\n\n*Import the public key to the system's MOK list by running this command:\n\n~$ sudo mokutil --import MOK.der\n\n\n*Confirm a password for this MOK enrollment request. \n\n*Reboot your machine. Follow the instructions to complete the enrollment from the UEFI console.\n\n\nCited from this VMWare article: https://kb.vmware.com/kb/2146460\n\nA: On Ubuntu, that would be /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file.\nHow did I figure that out? I did a search for sign-file:\ndpkg -S sign-file\nwhich told me which package provides this file (currently linux-headers-4.4.0-22-generic) and where it was installed, i.e. in /usr/src/linux-headers-4.4.0-22-generic/scripts/.\nThe uname -r part is just to keep the command independent from the currently-installed headers-generic package.\n", "Q: Moving old SSD into a new computer My laptop died and I have some important files on it.\nCan I move the old SSD into the new computer and run with it?\nCan I make it work with the Ubuntu Live and install the grub on it?\nOr can I use the Ubuntu Live to access the files, save them and then format the SSD to install everything again?\n\nA: Yes, yes and yes.\nAny of these options will work out of the box.

Retreating to 3.16 didn't fix the problem; I'm guessing because the PPD file is left behind during the 3.17 uninstall and 3.16 \"assumes\" that its permissions are correct.\nIn any case, try checking the permissions on your PPD file, or just set them with CHMOD 754.\n", "Q: USB space reduced after making it bootable and unable to recover I got a problem here.

Then try to add a partition and format it.\nThe tools called disks (in lubuntu 16.04) is better and can slow format too.\nWhen making a new startup disk.  Best to format your disk before and and NOT use startup disk creator to do that (you know that now and that is how I know it too).  There are a few tools to make a startup disk on Ubuntu.

If we succeed they are considering creating a whole lab using Raspberry Pi 2's, thus being a very cost effective solution. \nMe and my classmate are Linux boobs, him knowing a little more than I do. We installed Samba trying to join the domain that way. We've gotten as far as trying to mess with the samba configuration file. Which the only thing we've done on there is edit this line:\nworkgroup = WORKGROUP \n\nto\nworkgroup = student.local\n\nstudent.local is the domain name\nAfter that we tried using the samba command to join it.

What further worries me is that POSIX is the third entry, while on a different, working system, it's last of the list.\nIn order to change my language to en_US.utf8, I typed sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.utf8. The locale command still showed the POSIX locale. After a logout and new login, locale still showed the POSIX locale. After a reboot, locale still showed the POSIX locale.\nHowever, when I type export LANG=en_US.utf8, it works temporarily, but only until logout. As such, I am pretty certain that the locales were generated correctly.\nI am out of ideas. I tried regenerating all locales, but it looks as if /etc/default/locale is simply being ignored.\nFor the sake of completion, /etc/default/locale only contains the line LANG=en_US.utf8\nUPDATE:// I tried running sudo localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8, and localectl also showed me that it set the locale, but even after a reboot, locale still shows POSIX and non-ASCII characters are still not rendered correctly.\n\nA: The answer was indeed PAM-related, as Gunnar Hjalmarsson mentioned in a comment. PAM was disabled via sshd_config, although I honestly do not remember doing so myself.\nTo summarize: If /etc/default/locale seems being ignored, check if PAM is enabled.\n\nA: Run the following commands:\nlocale-gen en_US.UTF-8\ndpkg-reconfigure locale\ndpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\nlocaledef -i en_US -c -f UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8\nreboot\nlocale\n\n\nA: What I eventually did is a combination of above techniques\nI've first done \ndpkg-reconfigure locales\n\nand chosed english, utf8, then:\nlocaledef -i en_US -c -f UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8\n\nAlso edited\n/etc/default/locale\nto look like:\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8\n\nAnd after reboot, when I type locale it now looks like this:\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n\nAnd no more warnings...\n\nA: In deploying some new 16.04.5 VMs, I ran into this exact problem, but with xrdp instead of SSH. I solved this by adding the following to /etc/pam.d/common-session:\nsession required        pam_env.so readenv=1 user_readenv=1 envfile=/etc/default/locale\n\nIf you are sensitive to additional languages and cultures across login methods, you could put this in /etc/pam.d/xrdp-sesman (or another PAM configuration file) instead. This may be why it isn't there by default? This is in the following PAM configurations by default on our new VM installations:\ncron, lightdm*, login, polkit-1, sshd, su, and sudo.\nHope this helps someone with this problem given login methods other than SSH.\nDoes anyone know best practices for PAM configuration/modification of common-*?\nIf there's a better way to get this going it would be good to get that down.\n", "Q: How do I install AMD Radeon HD 7570M/Intel Hybrid drivers?

You can restart this service by executing the following command:\nrestart mediascanner-2.0\n\nIf that doesn't work or isn't valid, you may need to install the daemon:\nsudo apt-get install mediascanner2.0\n\n", "Q: Unable to install graylog-web Package graylog-web is not available, but is referred to by another package.  \n\nThis may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or\nis only available from another source.\nE: Package 'graylog-web' has no installation candidate\n\n\nA: You have to notice that Graylog has four main components:\n\n\n*\n\n*Graylog Server nodes: Serves as a worker that receives and processes messages, and communicates with all other non-server components.\n\n*Elasticsearch nodes: a server that stores all of the logs & messages.\n\n*MongoDB: For storing metadata\n\n*Web Interface: the GUI\n\n\nYou have to install all the prerequisites first:\nInstalling Java then update:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer\n\nInstall MongoDB  and create the source list:\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7F0CEB10\n\necho \"deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu \"$(lsb_release -sc)\"/mongodb-org/3.0 multiverse\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.0.list\n\nafter that update and install the latest available stable version: \nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install mongodb-org\n\nInstall Graylog Server:\ncd ~\nwget https://packages.graylog2.org/repo/packages/graylog-1.3-repository-ubuntu14.04_latest.deb\nsudo dpkg -i graylog-1.3-repository-ubuntu14.04_latest.deb\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install apt-transport-https\nsudo apt-get install graylog-server\nsudo apt-get install pwgen\nSECRET=$(pwgen -s 96 1)\nsudo -E sed -i -e 's/password_secret =.*/password_secret = '$SECRET'/' /etc/graylog/server/server.conf\nPASSWORD=$(echo -n password | shasum -a 256 | awk '{print $1}')\nsudo -E sed -i -e 's/root_password_sha2 =.*/root_password_sha2 = '$PASSWORD'/' /etc/graylog/server/server.conf\n\nUntil this step the admin password is there installed, after that you need to configure graylog to your needs, and you can find the config file here :\nsudo vi /etc/graylog/server/server.conf\n\nGood luck,\n", "Q: new bridge setup for lxd on fresh host 16.04 and fresh guest 16.04 I am still struggling with an lxd bridge setup for IPv4 for all completely new ubuntu 16.04 installs, hosts and guests.  There is one ethernet adapter on the host, and it needs to be shared by its guests (no NAT!).  the 16.04 new guests are all webservers that need to pick up their own IP addresses from the DHCP network server.  my host boots 16.04 up with an eno1 internet identified by ifconfig (I am never sure when eth0, eth1, or eno1 are needed).  I want the bridge configuration to be permanent forever, and reemerge upon host reboot.\nto install, on the fresh host\nhost# apt install lxd\nhost# lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 first\nhost# lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 second\nhost# # lxc list\n\nI think the needed steps somehow involve the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*stopping the running containers with lxc \n\n*a change of the /etc/network/interfaces file\n\n*possibly shutting down containers now and/or host networking\n\n*a dpkg-reconfigure -p medium lxd  (what exact answers?)\n\n*an /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\n*starting the running containers with lxc\n\n\nI am happy to reinstall yet again---I already did this many times, because I am never sure whether my attempts have screwed up something else.  it's painful.  part of this is that I follow certain guides which seem to move along and then somewhere flunk me.\ngiven that I will not have altered anything, how is such a super-plain bridge setup accomplished most easily out of the box for hosts and guests??\nhelp appreciated.\nsincerely, /iaw\n\nA: Before using LXD, you have to configure a custom bridge by following these instructions. You may also want to set the dns-search and dns-nameserversoptions in the interfaces file.\nThen run sudo lxd init. Configure storage, network and password settings according to your needs. At the end answer \"yes\" to the question \"Do you want to configure the LXD bridge (yes/no)?\". In the following dialog answer \"No\" when asked to configure the default LXD bridge. Then answer \"Yes\" when asked to use an existing bridge. As \"Bridge interface name\" enter br0 or whatever you called it in /etc/network/interface. Then lxc launch your container and it will obtain an IP address from your DHCP server.\n", "Q: Mic problems with Analogue Stereo Duplex Ubuntu Unity 16.04 Toshiba Chromebook 2\nI'm trying to get my mic working, either external or internal. \nThere is no input sound available within settings and no internal external mic option within alsamixer capture panel, only within the playback panel. \nThere is no feedback within pavucontrol and I've completely come to a dead end to fix it.\nAny help would be great.\n\nA: According to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/1420988, you should add the line options snd-hda-intel model=dell-headset-multi in the file called /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf (or create the file if it doen't exist). You might need to adjust your model. I have seen model=intel a lot. https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1043568 and https://docs.slackware.com/howtos:hardware:audio_and_snd-hda-intel can help you out.\nDid the trick for me partly.

I have recently upgraded my dev machine to Ubuntu 16.04 (fresh install, wiped 14.04)\nThe default version of gcc is gcc-5.3.1.\nA problem that I have is a vendor supplied library is only built using gcc-4.9, which is not compatible with gcc-5.\nI have asked the vendor to provide a new version of the library, but it is unlikely that that will happen any time soon.\nIn the meantime I have installed gcc-4.9.3 from Ubuntu's package repos.\nI now have both gcc-4.9 and gcc-5 installed:\nls -l /usr/bin/gcc*\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      5 May  9 11:49 /usr/bin/gcc -> gcc-5\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 838008 Apr 13 23:23 /usr/bin/gcc-4.9\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 915704 Apr 13 11:29 /usr/bin/gcc-5\n\nI tried to build our source with gcc-4.9, but now I come up against the same ABI issues, but going the other way.\nThe problem I have is that we have a bunch of dependencies which we would typically install from the distro packages\nsudo apt-get install \\\n    python-dev \\\n    libbz2-dev \\\n    libboost-all-dev \\\n    libprotobuf-dev \\\n    libgoogle-perftools-dev \\\n    postgresql \\\n    libpqxx-dev\n\nWhilst I can configure my build to use gcc-4.9\nmkdir build && cd build\nCC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.9 CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.9 cmake ..\nmake -j8\n\nI now get linker errors when linking against libtcmalloc_minimal.a, libprotobuf.a etc.\nSo the next step that I tried was to remove all the dependencies installed from the distro repos and start building the dependencies from source.\nCC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.9 CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.9 ./configure\nmake -j8\nsudo make install\n\nThe problem here is that I'm starting to head down a rabbit-hole. Each dependency has other dependencies, and I'm not sure where it's going to end.\nThe other option is to downgrade back to Ubuntu 14.04 or some version which ships with gcc-4.9 instead of gcc-5.\nBefore I try this thurmonuclear option, I was wondering if there's a better way to do this?\nMaybe it's possible to install from repos built with gcc-4.9, or some other way? \n\nA: The problem you have is related to C++11 standard requiring a different implementation of C++ string (and list) type(s). For compatibility, g++5.2 and above compiles the new C++11 compliant type by default, (whether or not you specify -std=c++11), but you can set the macro\n-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0\n\nto revert to the old C++ string type. New libstdc++ implementation contain both ABIs. So if you have binaries you have to link against with the old non-compliant ABI, you must set the macro above on your g++ compiles. This should produce binaries compatible with the old ABI.\nUnfortunately if you are using libraries from the OS other than the C++ Standard Libraries, then unless these libraries are multi-arch in the sense of providing all functions which differ by ABI in both ABI's, then you're screwed because they'll probably only have the new ABI.\nHaving said that I have a problem on an old Ubuntu downloading an untrusted modern g++ which simply refuses to produce the new ABI. So it seems that backport from ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test is in fact badly broken because it refuses to produce binaries according to the new ABI.\nAnyhow the bottom line is when you link together everything must either be the old ABI or the new ABI. The following will tell which you are using:\ng++ --version\necho '#include <string>' > test.cpp\necho 'void f(std::string s) {}' >> test.cpp\ncat test.cpp\ng++ -std=gnu++11 -c -o test.o test.cpp\nnm test.o | c++filt\n\nIf that has \nstd::basic_string<char, ....\n\nin it, its the old ABI. If it has \nstd::__cxx11::basic_string<char, ...\n\nin it, its the new ABI.\n\nA: Go to tty1 by pressing: CTRL+ALT+F1\nPurge gcc-5.3.1 using this:\nsudo apt-get purge gcc-5.3.1*\n\nAnd install the gcc-4.9.3 using this:\nsudo apt-get install gcc-4.9.3\n\nNote: This requires Internet connection!\n\nA: It is good to use -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 .\nbut you can also use this option of g++, which can even be better\n       -fabi-version=n\n           Use version n of the C++ ABI.  The default is version 0.\n\n           Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to the C++ ABI specification.  Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0 will change in different versions of G++ as ABI bugs are\n           fixed.\n\n           Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.\n\n           Version 2 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.4, and was the default through G++ 4.9.\n\n           Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a template argument.\n\n           Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard mangling for vector types.\n\n           Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the\n           declaration of another parameter.\n\n           Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion behavior of C++11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and --, and a class\n           scope function used as a template argument.\n\n           Version 7, which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats nullptr_t as a builtin type and corrects the mangling of lambdas in default argument scope.\n\n           Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the substitution behavior of function types with function-cv-qualifiers.\n\n           Version 9, which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the alignment of \"nullptr_t\".\n\n           See also -Wabi.\n\n       -fabi-compat-version=n\n           On targets that support strong aliases, G++ works around mangling changes by creating an alias with the correct mangled name when defining a symbol with an incorrect mangled name.  This switch\n           specifies which ABI version to use for the alias.\n\n           With -fabi-version=0 (the default), this defaults to 2.  If another ABI version is explicitly selected, this defaults to 0.\n\n           The compatibility version is also set by -Wabi=n.\n\n\n", "Q: youtube-dl not working since Ubuntu 16.04 upgrade I recently updated my ubuntu from 15.10 to 16.04 and since then youtube-dl does not work.
