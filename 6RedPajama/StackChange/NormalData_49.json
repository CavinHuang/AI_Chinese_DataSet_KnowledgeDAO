["Q: How do I unlock someone's iPhone 6 without providing the owner's Apple ID and password? How do I unlock someone's iPhone 6 without providing the owner's Apple ID and password?\nI can not contact the owner to find out the Apple ID and password.\n\nA: You can not unlock the owner's iPhone 6 without providing the owner's Apple ID and password, or, if the owner created one, the passcode or password.  Apple does not keep that information, either.\nThe only thing you can do is to restore the owner's iPhone 6 from a previous backup, or set it up as a \"new\" iPhone.\n", "Q: How can I make a secondary encrypted volume open during the boot process? When booting off a FileVault encrypted volume, OSX is capable of accessing the volume for the boot process once the user has entered their password at FileVault prompt. I want to configure my system so it also can access a secondary drive (containing my homedir) during this process.\n\n\n*\n\n*After an SSD upgrade, I have an SSD as boot drive and HDD as data drive.\n\n*A secondary account exists on the SSD, with username \"admin\".\n\n*My preferred account, username \"chris\", has the home directory on the HDD, with symlink /Users/chris -> /Volumes/Tracto/Users/chris.\n\n*User \"chris\" has homedir set to /Users/chris (situation is the same when homedir set to /Volumes/Tracto/Users/chris, no change in behaviour).\n\n*If I log in as \"chris\" from the FileVault login screen, the machine boots and then shows the message \"You are unable to log in to the user account \"chris\" at this time. Logging in to the account failed because an error occurred\". \n\n*If I log in as \"admin\" from FileVault login, the system boots and logs in, at which point I can switch to the preferred account and operate as normal.\n\n*The preferred and secondary accounts have the same password, which is the one found in the secondary account's KeyChain associated with decrypting the drive.\n\n\nTo eliminate the double-login requirement, I hope to configure the system so that FileVault login decrypts both the SSD and HDD, boots off SSD and logs me into the preferred (HDD-homedir) account.\nOSX is 10.11.4, machine is mid-2010 iMac, SSD and HDD are internal.\n\nA: This doesn't work when your home directory is on a non-boot volume which is encrypted. If your home dir was on the boot drive or another unencrypted disk then you can have encrypted disks mount at login by adding the password to your keychain. But that's about it I believe.\n", "Q: How Do I Get Testers for my App Submissions? I submitted my enrollment in the Apple Developer Program a couple of days ago. I'm waiting to be approved.\nI have Mac 3D Puzzle apps that were created as .app files using Unity 5.3.2. I plan to create iPad versions from Unity which create Xcode projects. I would like to take advantage of the TestFlight Beta Testing program for this app but I don't know anyone to invite. Many of the people I know are iPhone/iPad users but are not technically inclined where I would invite them to test my apps. Can I use this program?\n\nA: Most people, myself included, ask family, friends, and co-workers to help test. Depending on the technical details of what you want tested, you can also put out calls for testers on Twitter and Facebook. \nThere are also websites that will help find testers for you, especially for games. Toucharcade is a good site for finding game testers. \n", "Q: Is there a terminal command to open applications in a specific Desktop? For example when I run open -a Kodi I'd like to be able to specify which Desktop I'd want the application to launch in. \nTrying to avoid dragging/dropping to the desired workspace. \n\nA: You can permanently assign an app to a Space by right-clicking the app in the dock > Options > Assign to... This Desktop.\n\nA faster way to move it to any given Space is to grab the window's title bar, then use your regular shortcut to switch to the desired Space. By default that would be  Ctrl ⌃   [number] \nSee System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control if you've never set that up. [Note that it differentiates between the numbers above  qwerty & numbers on a 10-key pad & considers them different keys]\n\nA: Unfortunately, I believe there is no known way to launch an application in a specific dock space (Desktop) using command line.\n", "Q: Where can I find El Capitan's default and beachball/busy cursors? I saw from this answer how I can get most of the cursors, but the busy and default cursors aren't there.

For a while, it worked fine when I used Messenger. I think the problem came along when I updated the software. The issue is before the update the Enter key moved the cursor down a line. Now the Enter key sends the message. I can't stand this and want it back like it was before. Any ideas???\n\nA: This behaviour is up to the app/website to decide, so unfortunately you cannot change it back yourself. However, pressing Ctrl+Enter is a common shortcut on Mac and iOS to insert a linebreak when Enter normally submits.\n\nA: Keep in mind I am using iOS 15.0.2 & using Messages for Android on Chrome. Use Shift+Ctrl+Enter and it will work.\n", "Q: What is the best solution for a free partition recovery? Recently I accidentally partitioned my Seagate Backup Drive (1 TB) not knowing that everything would be wiped off (silly me). I am now in shock knowing that my files are somewhat gone. \nI have tried many such as Wondershare or EaseUS but all require me to pay upfront, the trials do no good whatsoever. Is there any 100% free software for recovering partitioned external drives? I just need an answer.\nI do realize the risk of putting a wide variety question on here, but I am in dire need of getting my files back and would just like some experience on the matter.\n\nA: Data Rescue from ProSoft* works, it has a trial and no-cost limited-recovery options. You won't get the whole volume recovered by freeware.\nIt is unlikely you will get everything back, and if you are still using that drive your recovery percent goes down every hour as files get overwritten. Also unlikely you will get filenames back, just a great big folder of \"Recovered File 000238.txt\"\nOf course you need a different drive to recover things to - no sane recovery program touches the original volume.\nJust for comparison, if you want to let the pros at DriveSavers handle the recovery the bill will start at $1000.\n\n\n*\n\n*prosofteng.com, NOT datarescue.com\n\n", "Q: Flashing Safari I just upgraded to OS X El Capitan and my Safari windows are constantly flashing. I've already re-started my computer, but it's still flashing. It's mostly when something on the page is moving and mainly on constantly moving pages, such as Facebook, Pandora, and Imgur. Is there something I can do to make it stop flashing?\n\nA: Choose Develop → Show Web Inspector (⌥⌘I) and select  Disable paint flashing.\n", "Q: get rid of uninstalled app from updates in app store In the app store, I have a update for an app called \"Nepenthes\", by Wei Li, which claims to be \"for enterprise solution\".\nHowever, I've never installed an app by that name, and I can't find it anywhere on the drive.\nHow do I get rid of it - in two parts: \n1) How do I get rid of the update listing in the app store? (I've tried removing ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.commerce/updates.plist and rebooting.\n2) How do I make sure it is not installed? (other than not finding it on the hard drive)\nThanks,\nRuss\n\nA: Turned out this is renamed SQLiteClient.app\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to differentiate in iOS mail notifications by account? Specifically, the notification (both unlocked & locked screen) in iOS. I have setup two mail accounts (iCloud and another server). When I receive a new message, the notification shows the sender, subject and the first row of the message’s body. \nIs it possible to show the account where the mail was received?\n\nA: That is not possible using the default Mail app. It only allows you to differentiate between VIPs and regular senders (by placing a ☆ next to VIPs).\nIf you want to differentiate which account received an email within a notification, you would need to use a separate app for one of your accounts. You will then get separate notification settings for that app, and a different notification icon as well.\n", "Q: Can I Use TestFlight Beta Testing for Apps Not Created Using Xcode? I just submitted my enrollment application to be an Apple Developer. \nI have three Mac 3D Puzzle apps that were created using Unity 5.3.2 that I plan to sign and submit to the Mac App Store after I'm approved as an Apple Developer. I have .app executable files created, not Xcode projects.\nI'm new to Xcode. I'm currently taking the iOS Development in Swift course by Plymouth University recommended by Apple. When you create a new Xcode project one of the options is OS X which I'm thinking is for creating Mac apps. I assume the course will cover uploading apps to the iTunes App Store.\nOn other platforms such as Amazon and the Windows App Store their websites specifically mention that apps submitted will be tested before they are approved. I did not find anything about submitted apps being tested other than the documentation on the What's Included link about the TestFlight Beta Testing program. The text on this link mentions testing for iOS and tvOS apps. When you click the Learn more link it mentions iOS, watchOS and tvOS, not Mac.\nThe documentation says on the page that displays after Clicking Learn more: \"To get your app ready for testers, upload a beta build of your app from Xcode and add the names and email address of people that you’d like to test in iTunes Connect.\" Is the TestFlight Beta Testing program only for testing apps that are written using Xcode?\n\nA: No, is not necessary. You can upload your app from both Xcode or Application Loader.\n\nApplication Loader is a tool to help you upload your apps to iTunes\n  Connect. It’s particularly helpful if your app includes In-App\n  Purchase products that need to be configured for the app. Application\n  Loader is explained in Using Application Loader. Application Loader is\n  available from the Resources and Help section of iTunes Connect.\n\nWith that tool you will be able to upload your .ipa file. Once your app is upload, you can distribute that build over Test Flight.\n", "Q: Locked Mac find my Mac Find my Mac is locked I wanted to know if there is a way to rebuild a Mac with find my Mac being locked to an Apple ID. I can't remember what I put for my 6 digit pin. Also, is there a way to just get back into it so I can back up my information. \n\nA: You need to visit an Apple Store (Genius Bar appointment) to get it unlocked.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204756\n\nHow do I unlock my Mac?\nOnce you locate your Mac, you can unlock it by\nentering your passcode on the lock screen. If you forget your\npasscode, you'll need to take your Mac to an Apple Authorized Service\nProvider along with your proof of purchase.\n\n", "Q: Mac turns off randomly and has lines on screen For some reason my iMac keeps turning off around 5 to 10 minutes into boot.\nAlso just recently it turns on but has shaded lines going down the screen. I have not installed any weird programs and i have not used it in around 3 months. \nAny ideas on what the issue is, i don't have any other information about the issue besides whats happening when i use it.\n The image i'm showing you was found on google but this looks exactly like mine does.\nThe model of my imac is the late 2011 model.\n\nA: On first guess, based on the description of the symptoms, I would say that you are having an issue with your graphics card.\nThe best way is to run Apple Diagnostics or Apple Hardware Test. Hold D while booting from a powered off state.  Run the diagnostics and post your results and I will update my answer.\nFirst update based on the comments:  I found this video on YouTube that details this exact problem and it's related to the graphics card.  Now, one word of advice: don't do the fix shown in the video. \nWhile the diagnosis is correct, that fix is pure nonsense.  I have had much better results getting the board repaired by a shop that specializes in that type of fix (from eBay - I have used the one in Dana Point, CA with great results and for the record, I am not affiliated with them).  \nNormally I would say to replace it, but the prices are ridiculous - sometime over $700 for the graphics card. \n", "Q: How to get file sizes of large files in OS X Terminal? I'm trying to get the file size of a big file (1GB +) using the OS X Terminal. I'm using du -sh. But also after 30 seconds I don't have any result, is there any faster command?\nThanks.\n\nA: Say you are looking for big files in your home directory, use this command:\nfind ~ -size +1G\n\nReplace ~ with the directory of interest.\nUpdate\nMy original response was wrong, but I'll keep it to remind myself. If you are trying to get the size of a file, try this:\nstat -f '%z' filename  # Normal file\nstat -L -f '%z' filename  # symbolic link file\n\nI have not figure out how to do it for a directory yet.\n\nA: You can use the following command \n\n$ sudo find / -type f -size +1G\n\nIn case you want to avoid traversing mounted drives, your command should be:\n\n$ sudo find -x / -type f -size +1G\n\n", "Q: Notes loss caused by email-account deletion I got a new Macbook yesterday, so I was trying to configure an email account.\nAt the same time, I recorded some important notes in the \"Notes\", which were automatically bound to this email account by the system. (which I was not aware of )\nThis morning, I just found that the email account was not configured correctly, so I deleted it and re-configured a new account.\nThen I found that all the notes I recorded yesterday are gone.\nIs there any method to recover these notes?\n\nA: If your notes are really stored in your email account, you should be able to reconnect to the same email account over IMAP to gain access to your notes again. Do not configure the email account as POP3 for example.\nHowever, if you really have a new MacBook, it is probably running El Capitan. With El Capitan notes are no longer stored on IMAP email accounts - in fact it is not supported at all. Most likely your notes are really stored in iCloud, and you need to relogin to iCloud or reenable Notes in the iCloud preferences to access them.\n", "Q: Dock icons disappear and/or go fuzzy Every now and then the icons in my Dock disappear completely after waking from sleep, except some of them go funny or fuzzy. See screenshot.\nMacBook Pro Retina, 15\", Mid 2014, i7, 16GB memory, often plugged into a Dell P2715Q 4K Display. El Capitan.\nI've tried killall Dock in terminal to no avail, and rebooting doesn't do anything much.\nAny thoughts on what's causing this, or how to force OS X to clear its cache of the icons or similar?\n\n\nA: To clear the cache you need to delete the dock's plist.\nGo to ~/Library/Preferences and delete com.apple.dock.plist.  Restart your Mac.  That should rebuild the icons.  I'm not sure why this is happening, maybe someone else here can help with that.\n", "Q: Command+Z stopped working in all applications My Command + Z stopped working. In any app. Including keyboard viewer.\nNeither Left nor Right Command.\nIt's not hardware – Command + Option + Z (or Command + any other modifier) works on both sides.\nIt's like something is 'trapping' that combo. What could it be? I quit Butler; that was the only shortcut app I had.\nUpdate\nStrange … if I go to Keyboard Pref Panel > Shortcuts, and 'Add' an All Applications shortcut for Undo, then in that little window I can enter Command + Z.

I recently had a disk corruption simultaneous with my Time Machine backup failing to execute for a period of 3 weeks.\nSo I wiped the drive and reinstalled the OS and have been dragging and dropping from the old back up to get close to the previous state. In some cases I've had to reenter software keys.\nAt the moment I am having no luck with re-enabling QuickTime Pro.  I have read Apple's note on the topic:\n\nRetrieve a lost QuickTime 7 Pro registration key\n\nNone of the methods they suggest work for me.\nDoes anyone know if it is possible to copy a preference from the back up to the new disk that will re-enable QuickTime Pro?  What would be the name + location of that file?\n\nA: The file that contains the serial number, if you still have it, would be here:\nMacintosh HD/Library/Preferences/com.apple.QuickTime.plist\n*NOTE: This is the main Library folder, not your User folder Library.\n", "Q: Restore Podcast Layout in iTunes 12.4 My Macbook Pro just updated its iTunes to 12.4, and now I cannot figure out how to navigate my Podcasts. In the previous version, I had a list of Podcasts in the sidebar, and I could select one to see a list of all current and previous episodes. Now all I see is \"Most Recent\" and everything is jumbled together in one list.\nIs there a way to restore the previous behavior of listing the Podcasts individually?\nRelevant screenshots:\n \n\nA: In the sidebar at the top you have the Podcasts option (just above the Stations one you have just selected) which seems to do what you want - you will see a list of all of your podcasts in the middle column. Then you can switch between unplayed/feed tabs in the right column to see all episodes or just the unplayed ones.\nDepending on the defaults the view might be reduced to a text-only list.\nEdit including comment from @JosephLeedy:\nIn order to obtain the three column view similar to the old look, after clicking on \"Podcasts,\" you have to go to View > View Options in the menu (or press ⌘J) and change View As from Classic List to List.\n", "Q: If I install an older, deprecated Java runtime, will that mess up applications that use the current Java version?

If the developer is using a feature in a specific version of Java and you go to a lower numbered version, that feature might now work.  I want to emphasize 'might'.  Nobody knows for sure if what you have on your machine will be impacted.  Of course, and this is most important, you'll lose any security updates issued with the newer versions.\nHere's what Oracle has to say about downgrading:\n\nMost applications written for earlier versions of Java will run\n  without problems in newer versions of Java.

I don't think I've done much in the Mac partition under Windows at all over this period, much less possibly modifying the system files. I can get prepared for reinstalling it at any time, but nonetheless would like to know what most likely is the cause and if it is in any way possible to repair Mac OS under Windows at all.\n\nA: Try using single user mode to repair your disk: http://osxdaily.com/2013/08/07/how-to-repair-a-mac-disk-with-fsck-from-single-user-mode/\n", "Q: Sync multiple devices to iTunes but only one device for playcounts or ratings We have several iOS devices in our household (iPod Touches & older iPhones) that all sync through my account.  All of them except my iPod Touch are set to manually manage music.  However, I'm finding that when syncing, the play counts and ratings assigned by my kids are updating in my account.  I thought that the manually manage setting should have prevented this.  Is there any way to keep their ratings and plays from showing up in my library and on my device?  One of my kids primarily has an iPod Touch for the games and only has about 20 songs on it (which he plays on repeat overnight), which means those songs have play counts in the thousands, while my most played songs are lucky to break into double digits.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure sure that any time one of your devices is plugged into iTunes it's going to update the play counts regardless of whether or not you have \"manually manage music and videos\" turned on. More than likely this is because the metadata is completely separate from the fact that you are manually managing the syncing of songs to and from devices. \nI'm not 100% sure if that's the case with the metadata but it seems to be given that play counts are updated on your iTunes library even with \"manually manage music and videos\" enabled.\nThe only way I could think of checking that would be to enable \"manually manage music and videos\" on all of your devices and run a test again to see if play counts update. If they're still updating then I would say that the play counts are part of the metadata in the song file that's transferred to and from your library by the devices even when no actual song files are being transferred or synced between them. \n", "Q: Downloading music if I download music from a legitimate website, like amazon or iTunes, and half through my download I receive a Facebook notification or a text message or phone call on my phone, will the notification sounds appear on the download song on playback, meaning I have to delete the song and redownload it, many thanks for any help\n\nA: No.  You're downloading a chunk of data from a server, and other activity on the device will not affect the content of that data.\nIt's the same as downloading something on your laptop.  The system sounds that your laptop plays do not affect your download of the Google Chrome installer or whatever.\nAs a imperfect analogy:  If I wanted to communicate a story to you, I could read it out loud while you copied it down.  In that case, things around the process would disturb it; talking, loud noises, that sort of thing.\nThe preferable way to communicate the story would be for me to just hand you a printed copy.  If I do that, we could be in the middle of a busy restaurant and you're going to receive the story without any problems.\niTunes/Amazon is handing your phone a copy of the song, not reading it out loud, and no matter how much Facebook or anyone else bangs on pans in the vicinity, none of that is going to affect the song that is being handed to your phone.\n", "Q: Why OSX symlink cannot Relative PATHs?

Relative paths work fine.\nIf what you're trying to do here is create a symlink from Dropbox to BTsync, the problem is that Dropbox already exists. This means the symlink is created inside the Dropbox folder, named BTSync.

I was able to SSH into the machine, set the preferences using the command you provided and verify that it was set by issuing the command:\nsudo -u testguy defaults read  /Users/testguy/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist Di\nsablePrintPreview  \n\nThe response was 1 (true)\n\nA: First I have to say that at the moment I'm not where I can ssh into another Mac to test this, however I'm going to offer it anyway as I believe this can work.\nSome assumptions on my part...\n\n\n*\n\n*Each of the systems to be touched have more then one User Account.\n\n*You will use Administrator Credentials to modify the target .plist file.\n\n\nNotes:\nIn order to touch the target .plist file under each Account you'll need to use sudo and as such it will change the owner:group of the target file to root:wheel and will need to be changed back after the defaults write ... command is executed on the target file. So the owner:group info of the file will need to be ascertained and stored in variables before being touched.\nIf Google Chrome is running at the time its .plist is touched, the changes will probably not take effect until the app is closed and reopened. Also, depending on the version of OS X, the change may get overwritten when the app is closed. If this is the case you need to add additional code to check and see if the app is running and close it before touching its .plist file.\nThe following bash script should do what's necessary.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nf=\"/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist\"\n\nfor d in /Users/*; do\n    if [[ -f $d$f ]]; then\n        og=\"$(ls -l \"$d$f\" | awk '{print $3\":\"$4}')\"\n        defaults write \"$d$f\" DisablePrintPreview -boolean true\n        chown \"$og\" \"$d$f\"\n    fi\ndone\n\n\n\n\nA: I appreciate your suggestions guys. Allan and User3439894's suggestion are both correct and really helped me a lot. I tested this in 10.11.4 and used the scripts above to 10.9-10.11. I probably just need to email the users to relaunch google chrome for the settings to take effect.\nThe reason why I want to disable this print preview in chrome for mac is because when users print to our Konica printer, which has authentication enabled, it shows \"print\" as the username from the logs. Other browsers like firefox or safari does show the appropriate username. I wasn't able to find a solution to that so I decided to disable chrome's print preview instead.\n", "Q: files not appear on Desktop and Drag & Drop is not working on Desktop I am using 10.11.4 OS X.

I am switching from an iPhone to an Android. I dont have the time to transfer everything right now but am letting a friend borrow my iPhone. If I reset my phone, can I still access all my info from iCloud even if a new iCloud account is set up on my old device?\n\nA: Yes, the content on iCloud is separate from any particular device (except Backup) and can be accessed from a different device regardless of what happened to the original. You won't be able to access all your iCloud data without an iPhone or Mac though (e.g. Safari History and other app data).\n\nA: Yes, as long as you everything has been backed up to iCloud. After you get your iPhone back from your friend, you can remove the iCloud account, put your one back in, and choose to sync everything when prompted.\n", "Q: Can I drive two Cinema 30\" displays from a MacBook Pro (Retina)? I've used a \"Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter\" to drive a single Cinema 30 from my (2014-era) MacBookPro11,2 before.  Can I hook up two of them to drive a pair of Cinema 30's?  It's got 2 Thunderbolt ports and 2 USB ports, but the USB are on opposite sides -- will the USB cable reach?  (UPDATE: The cable will reach, but it's pretty tight.  I wouldn't want to plug/unplug it a lot.)\nIs the USB plug just for power, in which case, could I plug it into a different USB port?  Or is it needed for extra data, too?\nAlternatively, is there a Thunderbolt dock that supports this?  The docks I've looked at so far say they don't support multiple displays, but they seem to assume a new Thunderbolt display, so it's not clear.  Dual-link DVI is kind of an odd beast.\n\nA: The USB cable is only for the ports in the back of the display.  If you don't intend on using them, you don't need to plug it in.  \nUSB 2.0 has a max cable length limit of about 5 meters.  You could get an extension cable that keeps you below that limit and it should make things work smoothly.\n", "Q: headset plugged in via Y-adapter and extension cable stopped working I own a late 2013 iMac 27\". The following setup worked for months until yesterday:\nThe 3.5mm port is connected to a Y-Adapter, the adapter let me use two headsets at once. I use my headset and my stereo (which as new mic and only is for output) on the ends. In-between headset and y-adapter I use a 5 meter extension cable. That worked very fine the last few months.\nYesterday my friends reported my mic sound is bad and they hear my keyboard while talking. I checked and saw that the mic from my headset was no longer recognized within the audio settings. Sound itself works fine on the headset, as well as on my stereo.\nI rebooted, nothing changed.\nThe (bad) solution was plugging in my headset directly to the build in 3.5mm port. External microphone shows up in the settings. Testing the long extension cable and the Y-adapter I came to the conclusion both work fine. It is very unlikely that on both cables the mic channel broke at the same time.\nI tried my (never touched before) headsets from my iPhone and my HTC, both only work when directly plugged in, but not over one or both cables.\nDirectly plugged in headset sound far worse then over the previous setup. According to my friends, which hear me everyday via TeamSpeak.\nThe only thing I did with audio was to have a Skype session in the night (I usually don't use Skype). I read now that skype + OS X sometimes lead to missing microphones, but only within the Skype App, not affecting the system input. So I assume that this is not related to my issue.\nThe setup is sadly pretty unique.\nAnyone experienced similar issues or have any suggestion on how I can fix?\nIf it matters, here is the extension cable  and the y-adapter on (German) Amazon.\n\nA: Based on this statement in your question:\n\nThe (bad) solution was plugging in my headset directly to the build in\n  3.5mm port.\n\nThis tells me you didn't have good results going directly from headset to iMac audio plug.\n\nDirectly plugged in headset sound far worse then over the previous\n  setup. According to my friends, which here me everyday via TeamSpeak.\n\nWhich is confirmed by this statement.\n\nTesting the long extension cable and the Y-adapter I came to the conclusion both work fine. It is very unlikely that on both cables the mic channel broke at the same time.\n\nThis is absolutely correct.  Cables will last a long time if you don't abuse them.  You would know if your cable was giving you trouble and you didn't indicate it here.\nUnfortunately, your iMac audio port may be bad.\nYour audio cable plugging into the back of your iMac looks something similar to the image below.  Each one of the contacts is a \"spring loaded\" contact that pushes against the plug.   In effect, it is a mechanical component and prone to failure at some point.   Alternatively, you may have a bad solder joint on the audio jack's connection to the logic board.  It's impossible to know unless you have it diagnosed by a technician.\n\nAfter doing some searches around the Internet, it seems the the audio port for the iMac 27 (2013) is still separate from the logic board, but for whatever reason it's not availabe in the aftermarket yet.\nLooking at the the back of the iMac, we see it's to the left of the SD card reader. \nHowever, looking at the logic board, it's not physically attached:\n\n(images courtesy of ifixit.com)\nThis gives me hope that you can have it replaced by Apple or an Authorized Service Center.  Hopefully, soon, it will be available for order on the secondary market because this is a very easy DIY project.\nThe other options is that you could switch over to USB and/or Bluetooth headsets.  Going USB would probably be the easiest way to go.\nYou mentioned that you have it connected to a stereo.  I am personally using Behringer UCA202 Audio Interface to hook my iMac up to my Bose Wave Radio.\n\n", "Q: Missing lock icon in System Preferences->Sharing on El Capitan See attached image below. I have a few macs and on one of them, I cannot for the life of me figure out how to lock the Sharing tab under System Preferences. The lock is present and working on other panes that support locking. I also went to Security & Privacy advanced and could not find anything there. How do I re-enable the ability to lock this pane and does anyone know why or how it got that way? My other Macs don't have this problem.\nEdit: I am including another screenshot from my other Mac to show that there is indeed a lock on that pane.\nI am running OS X El Capitan 10.11.2 on a Macbook Pro Retina (late 2013)\n\n\nA: There is no lock on this screen.  There is only a lock if the setting requires an Administrator (someone with the role of Administrator) to make the changes (i.e. Security).  If anyone can make the changes then there's no need for a lock.\nMake sure you're logged-in with the role of Administrator to see the preferences that you can lock/unlock.\nEDIT: based on OP's new comments:\n  - Log in as a user with Administrator rights.\n  - Open System Preferences and select Security & Privacy.\n  - Click the lock icon and authenticate.\n  - Click the Advanced button at the bottom and enable the Require an Administrator... in the popup window.\n  - OK the change and then lock the S&P preference pane.\nNow when you open the Sharing preference pane you will have your lock back.\n", "Q: Is a long app review time good? I have submitted my app before and it was rejected. When I submitted it, it was reviewed within a day and rejected that same day. I have submitted it now and it still says \"in review\". Tt has been 24 hours. Previously it has taken 4 hours. \n\nA: Until recently (like the last week or so), App Review would take 4-7 days.  This was for full reviews, updates, rejects, etc.  Somewhere within that 4-7 days you'd know if it was accepted or rejected.\nYou're experience with App Review is now the new normal.  For example, I have an app that has been 'in review' for 24 hours and I'm not concerned at all.  I'm used to waiting a week or so to find out if I've been approved or not.

I was wondering for a purpose. \n\nA: If you are the Airdrop recipient and you decline to share with someone, it doesn't get saved on your system.  It simply isn't transferred to you. \nIf you are the sender and the recipient declines your share, nothing happens; you still have the file and it stays in the same place.\nIf there's a file that you're seeing in the Trash (or as you mentioned it 'recently deleted'), that means the file was accepted and was then deleted.\n\nA: No. I just AirDropped a photo from my MacBook Pro to my iPhone, and after declining it, the photo did not appear in my iPhone's Recently Deleted album.\n", "Q: Why can't my friend text me on my iPad mini 2 from her phone which is not and iPhone?

My MacMini hdd, some months ago, stopped booting.\nUpon inspection, seemly a tiny amount of sectors got corrupted, but in system-related areas, and OSX went bonkers and destroyed half of my data while trying to fix itself, and made the disk entirely unusable.\nWhile the HDD has only 13 sectors \"pending\", and 0 permanent bad blocks, and 0 reallocated, I couldn't figure how to use it.\nI ended grabbing another HDD I had, that has 300+ actually broken blocks, and used that one as my new boot HDD...\nAnd it worked! Except it is obviously in a much worse shape than the original, I've been using it for months, but I am started to get worried it might die suddenly (although so far I don't got even a corrupted data issue!)\nI learned that on Linux you can use a command caled \"badblocks\" to find all... badblocks. And then use mkfs to create the file systems avoiding such bad blocks.\nBut \"badblocks\" is slow, and destructive, so before attempting using a Linux tool on OSX HDD, I wanted to know if there is a OSX tool for that: write data on the entire HDD (triggering SMART to reallocate, or decide that some sector was okay after all, for the entire HDD), and then put it back to be used as my main OSX disk (And use the worringly bad one as backup).\nAnd please, don't tell me to buy an HDD, I just can't afford one, if I could, I would not be \"wasting\" time doing HDD gymnastics like this.\n\nA: \ndon't tell me to buy an HDD\n\nBuy a new HDD.\nHere's why.\nFirst, a bit of history. \nALL disk drives have bad sectors. Way back in the 1980s drives were simple mechanical devices that came with a bad sector list. Today, the bad sectors are mapped in the drive's firmware. The drive has slightly more storage than advertized and the controller just replaces a bad sector with a spare one. As more sectors read as bad they are also replaced. End result is a drive that appears perfect to the end user.\nYour drive has exposed bad sectors, which means the controller has run out of spare sectors to use. This is a serious problem that will not get better. If the cause of the bad sectors was a head crash, the now-damaged head will be slowly scratching up the rest of the drive.\nSo, your choices are:\n\n\n*\n\n*get a new drive now, enjoy years of trouble-free service.\n\n*don't get a new drive now, have several months of bad performance, data loss, and general unreliability. Get new drive when the current one fails completely.\nLaptop-size drives that fit a Mac Mini are available on Amazon for $75 (1Tb Western Digital Black 7200rpm) down to $20 (120Gb chinese whitelabel). Or an SSD for about twice as much per gigabyte.\nDepending on your Mini's series replacement difficulty ranges from \"tedious\" to \"challenging\". The original ones require 2 big putty knives in addition to the normal screwdrivers, the newer (short, wide, all-aluminium) need a special tool.\n", "Q: Applescript remote control volume Wondering how to turn up the volume on my computer from another computer.\nset volume 4 of machine remMachine\n\ndoesn't work\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: In order to remotely control a Mac, say your desktop machine, you must first set it up for commands to be sent to it. To do this, launch System Preferences > Sharing on the Mac you want to control. Click the box next to Remote Apple Events, and set user restrictions if you need to.\nNext, you will need the IP address. In System Preferences, switch to Network and locate your machine’s IP address. It should be something like, 192.168.0.3. Copy that address to proceed to the next step. You can also use the machine’s Bonjour name which can be found at the top of the Sharing pane in System Preferences.

My wife has a MacBook Pro that she bought new in 2012. In 2013/14 it had an issue with the system files and when she took it into the Genius bar at Apple they reinstalled the OS (wiping all personal data in the process). At this point they also upgraded her to the latest OS X at the time. I'm not sure what version this was but I assume Mavericks or Yosemite for reasons that will become clear.\nAt the weekend the laptop seemed to grind to a halt and lockup while we were browsing the web. After waiting for several minutes to regain any kind of response, we did a hard reboot using the power button. On restarting the system showed a grey screen and a flashing directory symbol with a '?', then switched to the Prohibitory symbol. Unfortunately the warranty has no expired so any trip to the Apple Store will be quite expensive.\nI've been reading various articles and posts for the last few days to try and work out how to fix this, as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Hardware Test comes back OK.\n\n*Booting from the local Recovery partition (Command-R) does not work. Every time I try this it boots Internet Recovery instead. This means that I cannot reinstall the version of Mac OS X currently on the disk. Running diskutil list in Internet Recovery I can see that the Recovery partition exists on disk0 but I assume it is corrupt in some way.\n\n*I have ran 'First Aid' in Disk Utility a number of times in a Verify/Fix cycle. It says that it has fixed the disk but there still seem to be issues in the fix log (checksum errors, etc.). Another strange note here is that it shows the 500GB disk as having all space used except 37.5MB. This wasn't the case when the laptop was working.\n\n*Finally, when I run the Internet Recovery and select Reinstall OS X it tries to install Mountain Lion and gives me an error saying that the laptop cannot be 'upgraded' as it is running a newer OS (presumably Mavericks or Yosemite)\n\n\nSo my question is: What is the best course of action to get out of this bind? My thoughts are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to get the local recovery partition working?\n\n*Is there a way to determine the version of OS X installed on the system from the recovery tool?\n\n*Is there a way to obtain a disc copy (without paying as we already have it installed) of Mavericks or Yosemite so that I can reinstall from media?\n\n*Finally, is my only option now to do an Erase and then Install OS X from the Internet Recovery tool?\n\n\nAny help much appreciated.\n\nA: My recommendation would be to completely wipe the existing OS so that the OS X installer does not give you any errors about \"upgrades\".\nAs mentioned by Apple, I would boot the Mac while holding Command (⌘)-R. Once you are in OS X Utilities, select the Disk Utility option. In Disk Utility, select the drive containing the existing Macintosh HD partition, and then click the Erase button. Format the drive as OS X Extended (Journaled) with the GUID Partition Map. Once the drive has been erased and reformatted, exit Disk Utility.\nBack in OS X Utilities, you should now be able to select Reinstall OS X which will guide you through reinstalling OS X Mountain Lion on the freshly reformatted disk without giving an error about any existing OS.\n\nA: Try Option-Command-R, this will install the latest version of macOS compatible with that machine. \n\nA: Macs sometimes will ignore recovery boot (accessed through ⌘+R) or Internet boot (⌘+⌥+R) when an external disk is connected through a USB port. Try again after disconnecting all devices except for the keyboard, mouse, and screen.\nThis issue was experienced on a 2014 Mac mini running High Sierra.\n\nA: If the MacBook is pre OS X Mavericks (has a cd/dvd drive) then there also have been two grey dvd's with the Mac.\nOne is the Install Disk and the other Disk has the Hardware Test Utilities on it.\nOr if you got your Mac from eBay without the dvd's then you should be able to use a Retail DVD (the ones you can buy without buying a Mac) Boot from the Install Disk also lets you open Disk Recovery Tools or a Terminal Window also you can do a Fresh New Install if needed.\nIf your MacBook is Mavericks or later then it has no cd/dvd drive and also never had a Local Recovery then you won't be able to make local Recovery working.\nAt this Point your best Option will be if you have access to a 2nd Mac so you can create a BootUSB Stick there or maybe ask a Fried if he can create one for you.\n", "Q: how to place file inside /sbin/ in MAC 10.11 during .pkg installation We have been installing / placing a tool for dhcp refresh under /sbin till MAC 10.10 there were no issues. but now it is completely blocked.\neven with root privilege i cannot able to place it.\nAny way is suggested? \nDoes Apple provide any other way to perform the release and renew IP address, clear the ARP entries in better way?\nThanks,\nSaravana\n\nA: wim-deblauwe's comment links to Release & Renew DHCP from the Command Line with ipconfig which shows how to do this:\n\nThe basic syntax to renew DHCP lease from the command line with\n  ipconfig is as follows:\nsudo ipconfig set (DEVICEINTERFACE) DHCP\n\nIf you know the device interface (en0, en1, en2, etc), just run that\n  command to release and then renew DHCP for the determined device.\n  Let’s say it’s en0, standard for modern Macs with wi-fi only.\nsudo ipconfig set en0 DHCP\n\n\nDo not use setuid on OS X.

I'm playing Vain Glory with my iPad Pro plugged into the 12W adapter via the supplied Lightning cable. Screen goes black, battery dead. Takes a few minutes to come back on.\nWhy on earth did the device turn off even though it's plugged into the mains? Why does it show the battery dead symbol, instead of just turning on using the power from the mains to operate? \nThis is so frustrating and lame.\n\nA: The 12.9\" iPad Pro can use power faster than the 12W power adapter can supply it. That's why it can run out of power when running for example a game, even though it is connected to the charger.\nTo avoid that, use the 29W Apple power adapter instead.

If you're not currently using iCloud Drive you can always turn it on under Settings / iCloud / iCloud Drive. \nSyncing through a Computer. If both devices are synced with the same computer, you could go into iTune's device's Settings and enable Sync Books. Then syncing both devices would share the item.

VBoxManage requires either a UUID or the name of the virtual machine in order to interact with it.  For instance, if I wanted to power off a VM, the syntax would be (I have an alias set for VBoxManage as vbm):\nvbm controlvm <vmname>|<UUID> poweroff\nThis is pretty easy if you have VM names that don't have spaces or special characters in them like \"Client X Web Dev Server\".  I do this so I can take advantage of descriptive names.  So, the tradeoff is that I use the UUID.  To do this, I created another alias that will `cut' the output down to just the UUID.  For example, if I am looking for my \"Fred Web Dev Server\" (I am a fan of the Flintstones), I execute the command:\nvbm list vms\nMy output is as follows (shortened list):\n\"Fred - FreeBSD 10.2\" {f93c17ca-ab1b-4ba2-95e5-a1b0c8d70d2a}\n\"FreeBSD 10.2 Master\" {ae2a2d61-25e5-4b5e-b455-1b2f60b49157}\n\"Windows 7 Pro VL\" {62bfbca1-9fb4-4758-aeac-2777f2614ffd}\n\"Windows 10 Pro\" {46b285c3-cabd-4fbb-92fe-c7940e0c6a3f}\n\nSo, to interact with \"Fred\" I just issue the command:\nvbm list vms | grep Fred\nand as expected, I get:\n\"Fred - FreeBSD 10.2\" {f93c17ca-ab1b-4ba2-95e5-a1b0c8d70d2a}\nI then pipe it to another alias, vmc, that issues a \"nested\" cut command: cut -f 2 -d { | cut -f 1 -d }.  My result is just the UUID without brackets\n$ vbm list vms | grep Fred | vmc\nf93c17ca-ab1b-4ba2-95e5-a1b0c8d70d2a\nWhat I would like to do is set that result to a variable.  What I have been doing is re-executing the command, but editing it first to add a variable set instruction at the beginning like this:\n$ set vm=`vbm list vms | grep Fred | vmc`\n\nThen I can reuse vm in my commands easily:\n$ vbm control $vm poweroff\nI like having the option of not setting the variable because there are times I don't need to use it, just see it.  I can redirect it, but that goes to a file.  I have tried to pipe it, but that requires another command.  Does anyone know how to do this?\n\nUpdate (5/20/16):\nI got much more out of this question than I expect to so thanks to @user3439894, @fd0 and @Mateusz Szlosek for their excellent suggestion.\nI selected @user3439894' solution of using \nvm=`!!` \n\nbecause it was simple and elegant.  I assigned it to a shortcut key for when I needed it for even easier use.  However just reading the other answers, I now have some others solutions I can use for different scripting challenges I have run into the past.\n\nA: One way is to accomplish what you're asking is:\nAfter you've executed vbm list vms | grep Fred | vmc, and you want to immediately set the output of that commend to a variable, just type, e.g.:\nvm=`!!`\n\nThen press enter.\nTo remove the $vm variable, use: unset vm\n\nA: What if you used a function defined in one of your bash startup file?\ngetvmid () {\n/Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxManage list vms | grep $1 | cut -f 2 -d { | cut -f 1 -d }\n}\n\nThe $1 is the first parameter of the function. It also limits the scope of the variable.\ngetvmid Fred\n\nSetting the variable:\nvm=$(getvmid Fred)\n\nUntested but this should also work:\nvbm control \"$(getvmid Fred)\" poweroff\n\n\nA: You can pipe the output from vmc to the xargs command line tool.\nThis will look like:\nvbm list vms | grep Fred | vmc | xargs -I {} vbm control {} poweroff\n\nYou'll avoid assigning the output to the variable.\n", "Q: EFI Boot Windows 8.1 or 10 Install on MacPro4,1 / Mac Pro (Early 2009) I would like to install Windows 8.1 or 10 on a separate single SSD disk in my MacPro4,1 (not yet flashed to MacPro5,1) using only\nEFI/GPT method.\nThe machine has a 64Bit EFI (rEFIt reports version 1.1 - build 20070328 in the EFI shell using command \"ver\"), Windows 8 and Windows 10 installer  should be downwards compatible from EFI 2.x and should work with EFI Version 1.x as I read somewhere during my extensive research.\nUnfortunately the machine freezes after choosing EFI Boot from Windows installer.\nI created a USB boot like here \nhttps://superuser.com/questions/1045512/how-can-i-create-windows-install-media-that-boots-installs-uefi-only\nI tried the same installer and a unmodified DVD ISO on (native, not upgraded) MacPro5,1 and at least came to a blue windows screen with boot error 0xc0000225.\nUsing rEFIt on a stick, the MacPro5,1 reports the same EFI version and build.\nMy MacBookPro11,5 boots the stick from Apple Boot Selector Screen and enters setup correctly.

I can also burn DVDs.\nWhat can I do to get the setup to load in EFI Boot and install Win 8 or 10 on my MacPro4,1?\nThanks a lot for help!\n\nA: Got it working finally...\nThe first trick is to remove ALL disks from the MacPro when trying to load setup. You may leave clean HDDs or SSDs where the Mac EFI cannot find MBR or Protected MBR.\nAfter you removed all other disks the MacPro4,1 will not directly freeze after choosing EFI Boot on the installer stick.\n(You will have to create it like mentioned before here to force an EFI boot of the installer.)\nThere will then be a progress bar loading files but unfortunately you will get stuck on a black screen in a few seconds... \nTo be finally able to load setup you need to flash MacPro4,1 firmware to MacPro5,1 firmware.\nThe EFI version reported in rEFit shell will not change. But you will still have a different version after the upgrade flash. Apple does not seem to take great care about correct versioning with EFI standards as I understood from Rod Smith's comment here.\nThis more recent Apple internal version of the MacPro5,1's EFI will be providing us with the ability to boot EFI setup from the Windows 10 Installer on the MacPro4,1 machine.\nSetup will load fine then and will give you a clean bootable EFI/GPT install of Windows 10 (W8 I did not try since I am happy with the more recent version). Install bootcamp drivers and enjoy AHCI without patches.\nBe sure to strip the bootmgr files from the installer disc or stick. Even when choosing EFI boot, the Apple EFI will still boot the installer in BIOS/CSM Mode when those files are present.\nI will probably post more detailed step by step instructions soon...\nHere they are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make EFI bootable USB Installer\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Win10 install ISO from Microsoft\n\n*Boot into Windows DVD Setup or existing BIOS/CMI installation to access a Windows command prompt\n\n*open command prompt (from windows run cmd, from setup press shift+F10)\n\n*load diskpart and make a clean installer stick\ntype in command prompt:\ndiskpart\nlist disk\nselect disk n #n=usb stick\nclean #everything will get deleted!\nconvert gpt\ncreate partition primary\nformat quick fs=fat32 label=Winstall\nexit\nexit \n\n\n*mount downloaded install ISO (I did it in Windows, should work in OSX too)\n\n*drag everything from the mounted ISO onto the USB stick\n\n*delete bootmgr and bootmgr.efi files from the stick to avoid BIOS/CMI boot and force EFI boot.

I don’t know which Apple EFI version is contained in there. Downgrading should be possible as well, definitely possible to version MP41.0081.B07. Please research if you don’t want to lose the downgrade possibility to MP41.0081.B08)\nThe upgraded EFI finally enabled me to complete the boot process and you will have all other advantages of the 2010 and later models (hex-core CPU, faster RAM, Audio over DP) This upgrade is reversible.  (If using El Capitan you need to disable System Integrity Protection. Otherwise the flash will not perform. If patch is running successfully you can see a big grey loader bar and the apple logo.

I have not been able to guess what to use in the open -a ??? my.pdf command.  \nHow could I find this for any general application?

For example, to get Bundle Identifier from Safari:\nplutil -p /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info.plist | grep BundleIdentifier\n\nas a result You'll get \"CFBundleIdentifier\" => \"com.apple.Safari\"\nThen You use it like this:\nopen -b com.apple.Safari /path/to/file\n\nGenerally, You'll need to get Bundle Indentifier from Info.plist file located inside Application.app/Contents/ directory.\nOr if You want, You can get the app name with this:\nplutil -p /Applications/PaintCode\\ Trial.app/Contents/Info.plist | grep BundleName\n\noutput:\n\"CFBundleName\" => \"PaintCode Trial\"\n\n", "Q: How can I determine the maximum supported resolution on a given Macbook? I recall that Macbooks produced in 2009-2011 supported a maximum external resolution (through Thunderbolt or DVI) of 2560x1600.\nAn aspect ratio of 16:10 is much more useful for those who use their Macbooks mostly for work, rather than entertainment. The aspect ratio of 16:9 is more suitable for entertainment.\nYet Macbooks produced starting in 2012, and before supporting 4K external resolution, appear to provide only 2560x1440 (which is 16:9).\nIt's really a pity, because this may be one factor why it's impossible to find 2560x1600 monitors in the 24\" and 27\" variety. To get 16:10 one must move all the way to the cumbersome 30\", and then the DPI is hardly impressive.\nBut before buying any monitor for a \"legacy\" Macbook, it's nice to know for sure.\nHow do I determine the maximum external resolution supported on a given Macbook? Is this available in System Information...? I see the type of graphics card there, but not the resolution. Under Thunderbolt I see the speed (10GB/s x2), but not the resolution.\n\nA: While I don't normally like to post 'link only' answers, this needs to be an exception.  The answer to your question will largely be 'it depends on the MacBook'.  \nTo help you figure it out, I recommend going to EveryMac.com's MacBook Pro section.

I've been comparing some specs between Mac Pro models, specifically with the jump from Harpertown (a.k.a. Core 2) to Gulftown/Westmere (a.k.a. Core i7).\nWhile there were expected incremental performance increases across the board, the most significant jump benchmarked is for the AES instruction set that were introduced in the later generation; on the order of 24x faster. I've understood enough of it to gather that it is used for encryption and that things like BitLocker and SSH would see improvements, but it almost feels like those would go unnoticed in typical use.\nMy question is, is there any part of OSX that benefits from AES that results in noticeable performance improvements? Perhaps at a minimum would HTTPS connections in a web browser see an improvement? I know it is a bit of a stretch, but worth asking :-)\n\nA: So... A bit of poking lead me to a simple conclusion: it's unlikely Apple will tell you where they use AES-NI instructions within Mac OS or the rest of their software, but they are definitely present and available.\nFirstly, Intel talks a bit about AES-NI and where it is used. Some of the comments talk about its presence or lack there-of in the comments. Given that I have homebrew and wine installed on my Mac, I followed the interesting instructions here to test if the openssl dependency of wine is able to use AES:\n$ openssl speed aes-256-c\n...\nThe 'numbers' are in 1000s of bytes per second processed.\ntype             16 bytes     64 bytes    256 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 bytes\naes-256 cbc      69308.49k    74198.23k    75165.95k    74875.63k    76098.51k\n\n$ openssl speed -evp aes-256-cbc\n...\nThe 'numbers' are in 1000s of bytes per second processed.\ntype             16 bytes     64 bytes    256 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 bytes\naes-256-cbc     421057.71k   432531.16k   447445.08k   450021.03k   444866.56k\n\nThese numbers broadly agree with cyberciti's quote about 6x performance improvement using AES-NI. \nFinally, we have some actual evidence in the SE community itself: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12634305/.\nApparently, Apple used to provide an API for Mac OS which would not allow direct use of AES-NI instructions. The work-around used to be using Intel's compiler or building gcc from source. It appears that since 4.6.3, this is no longer the case, and developers can make use of AES-NI if they so choose. The performance improvements are then a function of the developers, not the OS.\n", "Q: I cannot mount .dmg file for VMWare Fusion: Protocol wrong type for socket ERROR I cannot mount .dmg file for VMWare Fusion installer.  I get the error: Protocol wrong type for socket .\nI have Mac OSX 10.11.5 , which is newer than the officially supported versions of Mac for this installer.  Hard to believe that is the problem though since this page says Fusion8 is designed for El Capitan.\nI tried downloading both VMWare Fusion 8.1.0 and also 8.1.1 and neither will work.   Test, I am also a administrator account on my machine.  Maybe I am not a true administrator (since this is a work machine)?\nI have no idea what that error means?  Is there a way to manually extract a .dmg or some alternate download or method to unzip on command line ?\n\nA: If you can't even mount the .DMG file it is unlikely to have anything to do with VMWare or the software they put in the DMG file. Usually errors when mounting a DMG file occur due to a damaged download. Though it is possible the file they placed on their servers is corrupted at the source.\nTry downloading with a different browser or even use WGET in the terminal and see what your results are.\n\nA: It's probably affecting all .DMGs\nhttps://origin-discussions-us.apple.com/thread/7568956\n\nA: Try rebooting your Mac.\nHad exactly the same problem today including Vmware Fusion not starting.\nReboot fixed both on my side. \nI'm assuming that there was an Apple update that required a reboot to finalise or something similar.\n", "Q: unistalling el capitan and installing yosemite issue I have formatted a usb drive guid partition and installed Yosemite from another mac. When booting, the USB is showing as an option to install yosemite. When I select this and try to install I immediately get a prohibited sign. I also booted normally (el capitan) and selected the usb from the desktop and was given an error \"the copy of the install os x application to old to be opened on this os x. Any ideas on how to erase el capitan and install yosemite??\nMac that I'm attempting install on..\n-started with el capitan on it\n-el capitan has been updated once\n\nA: If the Mac in question shipped with OS X 10.11.x on it, it likely will not be able to run a previous version of OS X (like OS X Yosemite.) This is because as Apple updates hardware, they build the drivers for the new hardware into the OS that the Mac comes with and also into later versions of OS X. \nA version of OS X which was released before that Mac model won't have the correct hardware drivers for that Mac. Apple's pretty upfront about it and states Avoid using versions of OS X that are older than what came with your Mac.\nApple maintains a knowledgebase article that shows which versions of OS X shipped with which hardware. It's available via the link below:\nOS X versions and builds included with Mac computers\nFor more information on this issue, please see the link below:\nUse the version of OS X that came with your Mac, or a compatible newer version\n\nA: If it was shipped with El Capitan, most likely you can't go back to Yosemite.\n", "Q: How do I identify which CPU a MacBook uses? I'd like to identify which CPU this notebook is using, in terms of code names such as \"Ivy Bridge\" and \"Haswell\". The little Apple logo in the upper left shows some information, but not this.\n\nA: The CPU has its own model number string built in.  Software can run the CPUID instruction with the right parameters to copy the string into registers.  The string will be something like \"Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz\".  You can get it from the command-line with\nsysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string\n\nI don't actually know OS X.  I'm answering this as someone who is often frustrated by benchmark numbers in SO answers that don't mention the hardware.  On Linux, some distros ship lscpu and/or x86info, but neither of them decode the model number into an Intel code-name either.  The numbers follow a pattern, so it's fairly easy to decode (see below).\nNone of the existing answers have mentioned any GUI method that gives the model number.  All the GUI methods just show you \"Core i7\", which is nowhere near sufficient.  Please don't tell people you have \"a core i7\", because that just wastes everyone's time.\n\"i7\" could be anything from Nehalem to Skylake.  There are huge differences between Nehalem and Sandybridge, and important differences from SnB to Haswell to Skylake.\n\nIf someone asks you what microarchitecture you ran your benchmark on, the model string from that is a great reply containing more information than just the microarchitecture name, so just copy&paste it to them (e.g. \"i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz\").\nMost people who ask you that will know how to decode model numbers, so don't feel like you need to summarize it or look it up for them.  I'd much rather someone copy/pasted the exact model number, since I can google it to find out details like cache size.  (http://ark.intel.com/ has a page for each model, and those usually come up high in google's search results.  However, those don't use the codenames).\n\n\n*\n\n*i3/i5/i7 xxx (3 digits) is Nehalem or Westmere (identical performance, so it doesn't matter)\n\n*i3/i5/i7 2xxx or Xeon E3/E5 XXXX v1 is Sandybridge (SnB)\n\n*i3/i5/i7 3xxx or Xeon E3/E5 XXXX v2 is IvyBridge (IvB)\n\n*i3/i5/i7 4xxx or Xeon E3/E5 XXXX v3 is Haswell (HSW)\n\n*i3/i5/i7 5xxx or Xeon E3/E5 XXXX v4 is Broadwell (BDW)\n\n*i3/i5/i7 6xxx or Xeon E3/E5 XXXX v5 is Skylake (SKL)\nThere are \"Pentium\" and \"Celeron\" models of each microarchitecture, but they have AVX disabled so people only use them for ultra-budget machines.\nThe \"i7 extreme\" CPUs are an exception to this.  e.g. i7-5960X is still Haswell, but is 8 core (16 hyperthreads) with quad-channel memory.  IDK if Apple sells any machines with such CPUs.\nWikipedia has excellent tables of model numbers for each microarchitecture.  e.g. you can google x5690 wikipedia to quickly find that a Xeon X5690 is a Westmere architecture processor.\n\nTo learn more about the differences between the pipelines of various microarchitectures, see articles like this Ars Technica one about Haswell.  Even the Wikipedia articles are not bad.\nFor a more technical CPU architecture point of view, see David Kanter's excellent Sandybridge and Haswell writeups.\nAgner Fog's microarchitecture PDF is excellent if you're analyzing / tuning assembly language (or compiler output), e.g. trying to make sense of perf counters.\nIntel's and AMD's optimization manuals also have some microarchitectural details, but don't always explain their asm optimization suggestions with analysis of how the microarchitecture operates.  This is why I prefer Agner Fog's guide.\nAlso see the Stackoverflow x86 tag wiki, which I've expanded/improved a lot in the past year.\n\nA: First off, you are not going to get the processor microarchitecture name (Broadwell, Sandy Lake, Ivy Bridge, etc.) because it's not a prominent branding scheme for the Intel processors.  Contrast that with Apple, the marketing department chooses to actively market the code names of their operatings systems (Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan).  It's a marketing convention, not a technical one.\nFor a list of all Intel Processors and their codenames, architectures and specs, Wikipedia's List of Intel Microprocessors has a good page.\nSo, to answer this question, I am going to provide three methods to find out what CPU you have, the first two, which should be good for most users, and a third method in which you can determine the microarchitecture number so you can look it up on Intel's support site.  You can \"jump\" to the section that applies to you.\n\n*\n\n*About this Mac (general CPU info)\n\n*System Profiler (general CPU info)\n\n*Terminal (detailed CPU info)\n\n\nAbout this Mac\nClicking on the Apple symbol at the top of your screen, select About this Mac\n\nYou will get a screen that gives you an overview of your system.  Your processor will be listed here.\n\n\nSystem Profiler\nClicking on the button marked System Report... (green arrow) you get a complete profile of your system.  On the first page, it will give you more detailed info about your machine, including processor info\n\nTerminal\nI am a fan of Terminal in general.  Pretty much everything you see in the GUI in OS X can be accessed quicker and more accurately through the command line, IMHO.\nTo get the exact CPU model including the microarchitecture number, in Terminal, execute the following command:\nsysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string\n\nYou will get the exact processor that you are using.  For instance, on my iMac, it the command above responds with:\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz\nYou can then do a search for i7-3770 and pull up the code name and specs.\nJust for reference, you can use the Terminal command:\nsystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType\n\nand get a result that looks just like the screen that I posted in the second section, System Profiler:\nHardware Overview:\n\n  Model Name: iMac\n  Model Identifier: iMac13,2\n  Processor Name: Intel Core i7\n  Processor Speed: 3.4 GHz\n  Number of Processors: 1\n  Total Number of Cores: 4\n  L2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB\n  L3 Cache: 8 MB\n  Memory: 32 GB\n  Boot ROM Version: IM131.010A.B09\n  SMC Version (system): 2.11f14\n  Serial Number (system): XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n  Hardware UUID: XXXXXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX\n\n(Credit to dante12 below)\nSo, if you needed your CPU or more commonly, your Model Identifier, you can use the same command coupled with grep.\nsystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep Identifier\n\nIt responds back with\n  Model Identifier: iMac13,2\n\n\nA: (Update: the clang -march=native part of this answer may not work anymore, if it ever did.  You may need to install GCC specifically, e.g. from brew.  Note that XCode installs a gcc symlink to clang, so if you don't have real GCC installed, the gcc command on a Mac will get you Clang.)\n\ngcc or clang -march=native can print a code-name for you, because the names of the tuning options match Intel's uarch codenames (e.g. -march=sandybridge).  For AMD: -march=bdver2 = Piledriver = Bulldozer version 2.\nclang -v -xc /dev/null -O3 -march=native -o- -E 2>&1 | grep -o 'target-cpu \\w*'\n\nOn my Linux Core2 system prints:  target-cpu core2.  I assume it will do something similar on OS X.\ngcc -v -xc /dev/null -O3 -march=native -o- -E 2>&1 | grep -o 'arch=\\w*'\n\non my Linux Core2 system prints:\narch=native\narch=core2        <----- This one\narch=native\n\nThis command compiles /dev/null as C (-xc).  gcc / clang -vprints its internal commands as it runs them, with full command line args.  Even with-E(preprocessor-only), the-xcoption leads gcc to pass the full set of-march=whatever -mmmx -msse2 ...` options.\ngrep -o prints only the matching part of lines that match.  \\w* matches 0 or more word-characters.\n\nYou need a new enough version of clang or gcc to recognize your CPU's microarchitecture and map it to a code-name.  An old gcc version will just print something like -march=core2 even for a Haswell, and -mtune=intel or something.\nAnother similar approach is to filter the asm output from gcc's -fverbose-asm, which includes the optimization options as comments.  I don't know a clang equivalent for this.\ngcc -xc /dev/null -O3 -fverbose-asm -march=native -o- -S | grep -o 'arch=\\w*'\n\narch=core2\n\nThis works on a Haswell system: see this example on the Godbolt Compiler Explorer.  Note the -march=haswell in the output.  (2022 update: -march=skylake-avx512.  With older GCC thinking that newer CPU was -march=knl, Xeon Phi Knight's Landing which is a very different microarchitecture.)\n\nA: There's an iOS and Mac app called Mactracker.

Finally, you need to specify that \"shell\" as the default for the account you created.\nThe idea is that when the SSH account logs in, it will redirect all STDIN/STDOUT for the session to the shell you specified.

Therefore appears error is probably caused by using -E option in macOS.\nFortunately using Homebrew and running brew install rsync to install a more recent version of rsync fixed the problem.\nSource: https://bayton.org/2018/07/how-to-update-rsync-on-mac-os-high-sierra/\n\nA: Copyfile is responsible for splitting a HFS+ file into two files. The  data fork- file and a metadata fork- ._file. That happens when you use the -E option with the Apple supplied rsync. I have no idea why it is failing. rsync does create temporary files and then moves them into place.\n", "Q: Why is my Hard Drive and User folder shared when I turn on osx file sharing? I decided to try file sharing on a mac mini, and noticed something odd.  When I go to settings > Sharing, and enable File Sharing, then add ~/Shared.  Now ~/Shared is the only item listed.\nWhen I go to another mac, find the shared device in Finder, and \"Connect As\" and login with my username & password for the mac mini, then I see the Hard drive is shared, my user folder ~/ is shared, and the ~/Shared.\nIf I right click on ~/Shared and goto \"Get Info\" I see that the \"Shared folder\" checkbox is checked, but for the hard drive and my user folder it is not checked.  These two folders are also not listed in the Settings > Sharing area...\nIs this just default behaviour? If so, why is that and how is it useful? And, is this stated by apple anywhere?\n\nA: Prior to Mac OS X Lion, Mac OS X Client came with SAMBA Server and Client and what you defined to share was all that was shared. Since Mac OS X Lion, and continuing with OS X Mountain Lion and other releases of OS X, SAMBA has been replaced with SAMBX due to SAMBA moving to GPLv3.  As a result SAMBA is basically broken in the OS since 10.7. The Mac OS X 10.7 Server and OS X Server going forwards does have some finer sharing controls not present in the Client version of the OS.\nAs a result of these changes the Macintosh HD and User's Home folders are automatically shared for them as an Administrative User and only the Home folder as a Standard User, in conjunction to what one chooses to share in System Preferences > Sharing > File Sharing.\nTo see the additional shares including what's defined in System Preferences > Sharing > File Sharing and what's not defined there. In a Terminal, the output below shows what's shared for me as an Administrative User and only sharing a folder named Temp in File Sharing.  With File Sharing enabled in System Preferences > Sharing, just copy and paste the following command into Terminal and press Enter: smbutil view //$USER@$HOSTNAME\n$ smbutil view //$USER@$HOSTNAME\nPassword for $HOSTNAME: \nShare                                           Type    Comments\n-------------------------------\nTemp                                            Disk    \nIPC$                                            Pipe    \nMacintosh HD                                    Disk    \n$LOGNAME                                        Disk    \n\n4 shares listed\n$ \n\nIf you do not want those shares exposed then do not turn on File Sharing via normal System Preferences and instead install SAMBA and manually configure file sharing yourself.\n\nA: Yes, this is the default behavior. Apple describes this in Settings > Sharing:\n\nFile Sharing allows other users to access shared folders on this computer and allows administrators to access all volumes.\n\nI cannot say why they decided to choose such insecure defaults, but you can change it in Terminal.app with:\n$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server VirtualAdminShares -bool NO\n$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server VirtualHomeShares -bool NO\n\nAfter that, restart the SMB server:\n$ sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist\n$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist\n\n", "Q: Send notification from command line On Mac OS X, some applications will display a notification that appears briefly in the upper-right corner (e.g., when I receive email).\nIs there a way to generate a notification from the command-line?  In other words, is there a command-line program I can run to display a custom notification, with text of my choice?  Ideally, I'd love to be able to run something like\nshow-notification \"Hello world!\"\n\nfrom a shell script and have a notification appear showing the text \"Hello world!\".\n\nI discovered I can use this answer to display a dialog box in the center of the screen that the user has to click \"OK\" on, but I'm looking for a notification not a modal dialog box.\n\nA: The following works:\nosascript -e 'display notification \"Hello world!\" with title \"Hi!\"'\n\n", "Q: iPhone 4s front camera not working When I open Camera, I can see the back camera is working but the front camera is not. When I press on the camera icon to switch cameras for a long duration, it shows 'AE lock'.\nCan someone help me with regaining access to my front camera?\n\nA: The camera's probably just stopped working and needs to be replaced. Check out ifixit.com for a step-by-step guide on how to replace it and then decide if you feel comfortable with the doing the repair. If not, there's probably someone in your area that can do it for you.\nIf it were me, I'd save any money I'd put towards a repair, back the phone up to iTunes, save the photos to my computer, and just upgrade to a newer iPhone.\n\nA: AE Lock is simply a state you can put your iPhone camera in by holding your finger down on the main display for a few seconds to lock the aperture.\nI think you may simply be missing the icon (aka Fat Fingers), or the upper right corner of your display is not working properly.\nI would suggest trying/downloading a third-party camera app, many of which have the front/back icon in a different location, to test whether it's actually working or not.\n", "Q: Apple restore problem I accidentally deleted a photo from the \"Recently Deleted\" album and I need it back. I have an iCloud back-up but every time I restore the back-up, the photo is not in the gallery and I know for sure that the back-up was made before I deleted the photo. \nIs there any possibility that I can recover the photo?\n\nA: If your using iCloud Photo Library your photos aren't part of your iCloud device backup, because the photos are stored in iCloud anyway.\nThe only chance to get it back is via a Mac, that downloaded the library via Photos.app and to check it's backups.\n", "Q: How does Twitter or Vine remember login credentials in between of installations? If you install Twitter, or Vine, equally, then you log in, then uninstall the app, then install it again, it somehow appears already logged in. I've got several ideas about how this might work, but they all are dismissed by various reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*associate a unique cookie with the device itself, but that seems to contradict the App Store TOS (I don't know; I've written \"seems\", so I'm not stating it), and it will sustain after the device has been sold, so this approach is hardly viable;\n\n*store the login data somewhere in the cloud, but, as far as I know, all iCloud records get wiped along with app uninstallation;\n\n*use OS keyring, but I doubt there is such an API.\n\n\nFor one, Telegram messenger always installs fresh so you have to log in again after each installation.\nThat said, how does Twitter or Vine do this?\n\nA: The iOS Keychain is not deleted, when the app is deleted. So if the keychain still contains the necessary credentials the app can just log in.\n\nA: Twitter (and by association, Vine) has a native iOS login in Settings, separate from the app itself. Deleting the app doesn't remove your accounts, or log you out.\n\n", "Q: Mail.app disconnected from data files My mac mini was acting up, so I reset the Nvram and ran the disk utilities from recovery mode.  The mini started up fine and runs stable, but now my mail, calendar, and contacts have been wiped clean.  Mail wants me to start fresh.  Its as if the user profile is no longer connected to the library/data/metadata.  I can see the mail accounts in the library folder, but I cannot reconnect.  iTunes and Photos were not affected.  Only Mail, Calendar, Contacts.  I have an SSD system drive and a separate internal drive for my home folder.  Apple support had me reset and move my home drive to the SSD restart, and back move it back again to the second drive to see if it would reconnect, but no change.

This way I don't need to re-format my external HDD I use for backing up files from my Windows machine. Since I won't be using the stick with my Windows machine I thought I might format it with a \"better\" file system than exFat. Would you recommend formatting it to HFS+?\n\nA: From Apple KB : Backup disks you can use with Time Machine \n\nFormatting a backup disk for use with Time Machine\nThe most common format for a Time Machine backup disk is Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format. \nTime Machine also supports Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled), Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled, Encrypted), and Xsan formats.\n  If your disk uses the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition type, some partitions might not be available for use with Time Machine.\n\nIn short, use a Journaled HFS+ partition on a GUID[GPT] formatted disk for best results.\n\nA: For macOS Big Sur 11.0 and newer\nSince macOS Big Sur, the best file systems to use for Time Machine backups are APFS and APFS Encrypted, as mentioned in the macOS User Guide:\n\nAPFS or APFS Encrypted disks are the preferred format for a Time Machine backup disk. If you select a new backup disk that’s not already formatted as an APFS disk, you get the option to erase and reformat it. If the disk is a Mac OS Extended format disk that contains an existing Time Machine backup, you aren’t asked to erase and reformat the disk.\n\n\nA: If you want to use your USB stick for multiple operating systems (like Windows, Mac, Linux), then you should format your USB stick in the following way:\n\n*\n\n*If your USB is <= 4 GB, then format with FAT\n\n*If your USB is <= 32 GB, then format with FAT32\n\n*If your USB is <= 64 GB, then format with exFAT\n\nNTFS and APFS/HFS are only for Windows and macOS respectively, don't use this if you want to use it on multiple operating systems.\nThis mostly worked for me.\n", "Q: Apple iPhone 6 Plus display languages I want to buy an iPhone, and would like to ask whether the iPhone 6 Plus has either Persian or Farsi language support.\n\nA: Apple eventually added the Persian keyboard and language to the list of the iPhone keyboards and preferred languages back in 2017.

This enables support for USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 devices, VirtualBox RDP and PXE boot for Intel cards.\nIn the Ports window pane, I do not see where you have added a USB Device Filter. Below is where I added a 2 GB USB flash drive.\n\nAn alternative to ejecting the USB external drive would be the following:\nUnmount the USB drive before starting the virtual machine. The timing is very important, since OS X will try to remount the drive automatically. Use the Terminal application command\ndiskutil list\n\nto determine the identifier for the external USB drive. For example, say the identifier is disk1, then the command to execute, just before you start the virtual machine, would be\ndiskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1\n\nUpdate:\nActually, I was able to gain access to the USB flash drive after starting the virtual machine. All I had to do is execute the \ndiskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1\n\ncommand while the virtual machine was running.\nAccessing the External USB Drive as a Virtual SATA Drive\nThe following Terminal application commands create the file share.vmdk needed to access the external USB drive as a virtual SATA drive. This file will be stored in the folder named Share on the your Desktop. I assume the identifier of the external drive is disk1.\ncd ~\ncd Desktop\nmkdir Share\ncd Share\ndiskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1\nsudo chmod go+rw /dev/disk1*\ndiskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1\nvboxmanage  internalcommands  createrawvmdk  -filename  \"$PWD/share.vmdk\"  -rawdisk  /dev/disk1\n\nNote: The effects of the sudo chmod go+rw /dev/disk1* command are temporary. The permissions may revert, if you restart the computer or eject the external USB drive.\nYou can now add the share.vmdk file as a second drive in your virtual machine. Note: Before clicking on the \"Open\" button, you will need to execute the command diskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1.\nBefore starting the virtual machine, you will be required to execute the command diskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1.\n\nNote: You can stop OS X from automatically mounting the external USB drive by creating/editing the file /etc/fstab. See man fstab for more information.\n\nAccessing a Read/Write .dmg File as a Virtual SATA Drive\nUse the Disk Utility application to create a new blank disk image. Below is a example where the share.dmg is created in the ~/Desktop/Share folder. (This was done using Yosemite OS X 10.10) Other types of disk images can also be created and used.\n\nAgain you need to create a share.vmdk file. The commands are given below.\ncd ~/Desktop/Share\ndiskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1\nvboxmanage  internalcommands  createrawvmdk  -filename  \"$PWD/share.vmdk\"  -rawdisk  /dev/disk1\n\nNext, execute the same steps already given to access the USB drive.\n\nA: Installation of Intel(R)_USB_3.0_eXtensible_Host_Controller_Driver helped me\n", "Q: How do I change the icon of an alias to a custom ICO file? I've created a couple of aliases to Wine executables that I put in my dock, but by default they're all coming up with the standard page icon. I would like to customize these icons using custom ICO files (which I have) so I can more easily identify which one's which. I tried hitting \"Get Info\" on the alias and then dragging the icon in there (the cursor adds a green plus when I do this), but it seemed to have no effect. How can one customize the icons on aliases on OS X?\n\nA: As you've already found out you cannot customize the icon of an alias.\nWhat you'll need to do, is create an application bundle using either Applescript, Automator, included in OS X, or use third-party app like Platypus.\nYou can then use custom .incs files or copy and paste supported images into the Get Info Sheet Icon and then add the application bundle to the Dock.\nI have 10 WinApps I've done this for using Automator, creating an Application and adding a Run Shell Script Action to it.\nOne App in particular is GIF Movie Gear and the command added to the Run Shell Script Action is:\nopen \"$HOME/Wine Files/drive_c/Program Files/GIF Movie Gear/movgear.exe\"\n\nI can't remember where I got the GIF Movie Gear Icon File however it is an .icns file that I renamed to AutomatorApplet.icns in the application bundle replacing the original.\n\nNotes: I do not have any ICO files to test with, so I can't say whether or not that file type is supported directly and if not, then it will need to be converted into a supported type.\nAlso if you do replace the AutomatorApplet.icns, do this last before adding it to the Dock and note that if you edit the Automator Application afterwards, it will replace the .icns file with a default one.\nDoing the copy and paste method into the Get Info Sheet Icon I believe survives edits.\n", "Q: Persistant phantom volume mount points, how to prevent?

So it's certainly not an hard drive problem or a software problem.\n\nA: The most likely cause is your keyboard is failing; specifically there is an issue with your power button where it intermittently causes it to stick.\nThe shutdown dialog box you are seeing is a result of the power management daemon intercepting the momentary press of the power butting thinking you want to sleep, restart, or shutdown.\n\nFirst I also taught it was the power off button but in this case It\n  should also shutdown when I'm on target mode but it doesn't \n\nThe reason you are not seeing the power button have an effect is because power management must be loaded to intercept the signal.  Not only is power management not loaded, nothing of OS X is being loaded either.  \nTarget Disk Mode is a firmware feature, not a feature of OS X.  What your Mac is doing is allowing the Firewire/Thunderbolt port to pass an external connection through to the internal drive so what you have is in fact, the most expensive Firewire or Thunderbolt external drive ever made.\nBecause it hasn't loaded any systems management services, a simple press of the power button isn't going to do anything; try it yourself.  However, to turn off your computer in TDM, you have to hold down the power button for 5 seconds - exactly the same way you would if your fully booted OS X Mac would if it stopped responding.\nHow to Verify...\nThis is a simple procedure to validate whether or not your power button is failing.  Since it's part of the keyboard assembly this requires disconnecting the keyboard and shorting the power pads to power on your logic board.  I recommend getting an external mouse/keyboard (USB) because when you disconnect your MBP keyboard, you will need something on which to type.\nOnce you remove the back cover and disconnect the keyboard/trackpad assembly from the logic board, you will need to turn on the MBP by \"shorting\" the two power pad connections.  Don't worry, this is exactly what a switch does - it shorts the connection.  You can use a paperclip, but my preference is to use a flat blade screwdriver wide enough to touch both contacts. \n(The images below are from a 2010 MBP, if you give me your specific model, I will update the shots)\n\n\nYou won't be able to power on your MBP unless you open the lid, so you will have to gently have it upside down on your desk with the lid open as you perform this procedure. It helps if you put a towel of some sort of padding to protect it. Once it's powered on, just flip it back to its normal position (off the towel); you won't need to put the bottom cover back on.  Make sure your mouse and keyboard are connected.\nIf the problem goes away once you do this, then the problem is your keyboard - it's time for a replacement.\n", "Q: How to get Torch browser to stop prompting me to update to new version? I have the Torch browser (Version 29.0.0.7181 (7181)) installed on my Mac (10.11.4). It's no longer updated or supported on the Mac but I use it as a tester browser for some things so I like it.\nBut Torch periodically asks me to install a new version of Torch. There's a modal window that says:\nA new version of Torch is available.\nWould you like to install it now?\n\"Remind me later\"      \"Install now\"\n\nI have to click the \"Remind me later\" to dismiss it. And if I click \"Install now\" nothing happens.\nHow can I get the Torch browser to stop prompting me to update to a new version? There is no new version. There is nothing in the Torch settings to disable this. Is the prompter a binary I can just delete from my Mac? Anyway at all to disable this annoying dialog from ever appearing again?\n\nA: Scroll down on this site (http://www.shouldiremoveit.com/Torch-5557-program.aspx) and you'll see something that's known to come with Torch called torchhelper.dll. \nI dug into Activity Monitor to gather data about Chrome (I really don't want to download Torch) and found all this when expanding the Chrome app section (while using Chrome to bring it up to the top):\n\nSo try this and tell me what happens: open up Activity Monitor on your Mac, go to the Memory tab, then search (top-right) for Torch.

I booted to recovery mode, chose reinstall os x and followed the steps. So far so good. When it came to choose the destination disk where I wanted to install the OS, it did not show any hard drive, i.e Macintosh HD was not shown so I could select it. I figured I had to format it first. So I close the installation and went to Disk Utility. The problem is Disk Utility is stuck at loading and does not show anything. \nMy OS is corrupted, that is the reason why I want to do a fresh installation. With corrupted I mean, I can boot my system only if I go to single-mode and mount the hard drive with mount -uw / and then exit. But this is not a long term solution. I search everywhere in the web and there are many solutions out there, but none worked form me.\nI tried erasing and formatting the hard drive when in single-mode with the help of diskutil. But this did not work because the DiskManagement Framework was missing. So I tried loading the files manually with launchctl. But still I can not use diskutil in single-mode. \nI tried also fsck, it did not do any good. \nI ran out of options. I don't know what to do.\nHere is an image when I try to erase the partition via Disk Utility\n\nAnd here is an image when I try to reinstall the OS.

If your hard drive shows up, but the drives are grayed out, try restarting into Recovery mode (pressing Cmd+R after booting). After a couple of restarts you might be able to finally run First Aid on your drive.\n\nA: I suspect that your hard drive is in the process of crashing. I am basing my reasoning off this statement:\n\nMy OS is corrupted, that is the reason why I want to do a fresh\n  installation. With corrupted I mean, I can boot my system only if I go\n  to single-mode and mount the hard drive with mount -uw / and then\n  exit. But this is not a long term solution. I search everywhere in the\n  web and there are many solutions out there, but none worked form me.\n\nTo verify that this is the case, there are a couple steps to take...\nCheck the SMART status.\nBoot like you described,then run the command:\ndiskutil list\nYou will get a listing of your drives.  Chances are it will be /dev/disk0, but it may be different.  Just make note of which one is labeled \"Macintosh HD\" as you noted in your question.\nThen, issue the command:\ndiskutil info /dev/disk0 | grep -i smart\nIf it returns back anything but the word \"Verified\", your drive is crashing.  OS X usually doesn't get corrupt unless the user does something very outlandish and very deliberate.  Most often it is because the HDD is beginning to fail and bad sectors are cropping up.\nRun Apple Hardware Test/Diagnostics\nI am just going to guess and say you have a pre-June 2013 Mac Product, so you will run Apple Hardware Test.\nSimply hold down the D key while booting from a powered off state (power supply plugged in if you are on a Macbook) and then run the \"Extended Diagnostics\".    \nIf you have a post-June 2013 product, launching Diagnostics is the same procedure, just a different set of tools.\nReplace the Drive..\nYou didn't mention which Mac you have specifically but replacing a hard drive is actually quite easy.

I will link them for reference.\n\n\n*\n\n*My Mac is getting really slow, what should I do?\n\n*El-capitan crashing while booting\n\n*How do I know if I need a new hard drive?\nEach of these posts has detailed answer and references on how to replace your drive, and even do a memory upgrade while you have it open.\n\nA: You should be able to load Disk Utility from the OS X Installation. \nWhen you boot into recovery mode, have a look at the menu bar at the top of the screen and there should be a utilities drop down with Disk Utility in there.  From that Disk Utility you should have no problem formatting your drive.\n\nA: I had this problem where I couldn't see my external usb hdd with ntfs format in mac os and I tried DiskUtil where it stuck at loading.\nNone of above worked for me.

I'm new to Macs and I keep having the following problem:\nIf I leave my mouse cursor within roughly a fifth of the top of the screen, OS X thinks I want to exit fullscreen mode and shows the OS X menu bar.\nThis is very annoying as the only options I can find will allow me to choose having the remote display get resized (which is terrible if I'm hovering over a button which was just about to click) or part of my screen gets covered by the menu bar.\nHow can I stop the OS from trying to help me until I push the cursor into the farthest pixel in the upper right hand corner (or something like that) so that I can use the machine as a thin-client and not deal with the local system? Is there a way I could create a separate user account that only displays that application as if there's no Finder?\nBefore suggesting another client: I've found that you really need to use the default one in OS X or it is a poor experience.\n\nA: Something that made this less annoying/painful for me was to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn scaling on\n\n*Set remote monitor resolution to match exactly client resolution (laptop)\n\n*Set to follow cursor continuously\n\n\nThis seems to trigger the top bar pull-down less frequently, but it still happens.\nAnother workaround would be not using fullscreen mode, and use maximized mode instead, but that's no fun!\n", "Q: OS X 10.11.5 Update won't download I am having trouble downloading the OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 Update.

The old disk is encrypted. I did that on my own two MBPs successfully, but both disks were not encrypted. The Mac is running OS X v10.10.5.\nI reboot the friends MBP with CMD+R into Recovery Mode and run Disk Utility -> Restore with the old drive set as \"source\" and the new SSD set as \"backup\"\nIt runs for a few minutes, but then it fails with\nRESTORE FAILURE\nCould not restore - Device not configured\n\nThe SSD is brand new and connected to the Mac via USB.\nDoes anyone have an idea what is going on?\n---------- Solution -----------\nThanks for the answers. The simple solution was to exchange the original HD with the still empty SSD and run restore in that combination. I believe it may have been some kind of USB problem, maybe related to the different read / write speeds (slow reading, encrypted disk vs super fast SSD write). Not sure, but it worked. Cheers!\n\nA: The outcome you're seeing is probably a (security) feature, not a bug. I would think that Disk Utility would prompt for a password to enable access to the encrypted drive before allowing it to be read in order to perform the restore. Before attempting the restore use the Terminal command string \"diskutil corestorage unlockVolume UUID -stdinpassphrase\" followed by the password to unlock the drive then see if your restore runs to completion.\n\nA: \nCould not restore - Device not configured\n\nMeans bad USB drive and need to replace it. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you drive encrypted you are not able to check this in another macbook because ist encrypted with your own and the UUID of the local system.\n\n*If you able to open the drive at your current system, check the storage capacity of the drive it is very full you also get this error. You need to delete something to access your drive.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Had same issue, went and saw that the source disk was Case-sensitive, Journaled, and Encrypted, so I went to the destination disc and first erased it with same settings - Case-sensitive, Journaled, and Encrypted - then repeat the \"Restore\" operation as in this link https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5424527?tstart=0\nand it worked.

Is it possible to add a service to a folder so as to open it with a specific application?\nAs shown in the screenshot below, an application named Evernote has done this. I want to do it manually for VS Code and Brackets.\n\nLet's take VS Code for an example. It is a text editor that opens a folder in it and allows a user to edit the text files in the folder and its subfolders. There are so many other applications in the market like Sublime, Adobe Brackets and so on.\nThe folder hierarchy looks like this:\n\nIn order to open the folder in the app, I have to open the app, then go to the open folder option, then find the folder, then select and click on the open button.\nInstead of this, I want an option in the right click menu of the folder to open the folder directly with the text editor. Just like you can open a folder in Terminal by adding a service.\n\nA: The simplest solution is to create a Quick Action with Open Finder Items:\nThis way you don't need a shell script that might break with an OS update or VS Code update\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator and select Quick Action or File > New > Quick Action If Automator is already open.\n\n\n\n\n*Set Quick Action receives selected to files or folders and in to Finder.\n\n\n\n*Choose an Image (icon) select Choose.. and double click Visual Studio Code in the window that pops up, this will set your quick action icon to the same as VS Code\n\n\n*Add Open Finder Items, Choose open with as Other.. select Visual Studio Code and save your Quick Action as Open in VSCode optionally choose an Image for your Quick Action job done.\n\n\nA: It does not solve the question exactly but you can always just drag the folder on to the VSCode icon in your app dock\n\nA: You can do this with an Automator Service.\nCreate the Service:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and select Service or File > New > Service If Automator is already open.\n\n*Set Service receives selected to files or folders and in to Finder.\n\n*Add a Run Shell Script Action, setting Shell: to /bin/bash and Pass input: to as arguments and add the following code:\n\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n    open -a 'Visual Studio Code' \"$f\"\ndone\n\n\n\n\n*Save the Service as Open in Visual Studio Code.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Close Automator.\n\n\nYou can now select Files and or Folders in Finder and then control-click (right-click) on them and select Open in Visual Studio Code from the Services Context Menu.\nNote: I tested this with Visual Studio Code but not with Brackets as I don't have it installed. However you should be able to create one for it too in the same manner while substituting the application's name in the open command.\n\nA: In macOS Mojave (10.14.2), I could not find Service option in Automator. So I had to follow the below steps to open folder contents in Preview app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator\n\n*File > New\n\n*Select Quick Action \n\n*Click Choose\n\n*Select \"Workflow receives current files or folders in Finder\"\n\n*From the left hand side pane in Automator, drag-drop Library > Utilities > Run Shell Script into the right hand pane\n\n*Ensure Pass input is set to \"as arguments\"\n\n*Then paste the below text:\n\n\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n   open -a 'Preview' \"$f\"\ndone\n\n\n\n*Click File > Save\n\n*Give name as \"Open in Preview\"\n\n*Go to Finder, select a folder containing PDF files, right click on folder name in finder > choose Quick Actions > Open In Preview\n\n*All the PDF files should now open in Preview.\n\n\nTODO: Add checks to ensure that Preview only opens some file types (e.g. PDF etc) and not binaries etc.\n\nA: Here is an alternative solution: instead of using the right-click menu, you could open the folder from the finder toolbar!\n\nPlease see my repo here: open-folder-with-vs-code\n\nA: Here there's a guide that you may use to create an application that will open your favorite applications, as well as any folders you may use frequently, so you can get to work (or play) with just a single click. Maybe it may fit your requirements :)\n\n\nThis workflow is used to launch Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, and\n  Apple's Preview application. The workflow also launches Safari and\n  opens the About: Macs home page. It also opens a folder in the Finder.\n  You could customise it as you wish.\nCreate the Workflow\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Launch Automator, located at /Applications.\n  \n*Select 'Application' as the type of Automator template to use.\n  \n*In the Library list, select 'Files & Folders.'\n  \n*Drag the 'Get Specified Finder Items' action to the workflow panel on the right.\n  \n*Click the Add button to add an application or a folder to the list of Finder Items.\n  \n*Click the Add button to add other items to the list, until all the items you need for your workflow are present. Don't include your\n  default browser (in my case, Safari) in the list of Finder items. We\n  will choose another workflow step to launch the browser to a specific\n  URL.\n  \n*From the Library pane, drag the 'Open Finder Items' to the workflow pane, below the previous action.\n  \n  \n  Working with URLs in Automator​\nThis completes the part of the workflow that will open applications\n  and folders. If you want your browser to open to a specific URL, do\n  the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*In the Library pane, select Internet.\n  \n*Drag the 'Get Specified URLs' action to the workflow panel, below the previous action.\n  \n*When you add the 'Get Specified URLs' action, it includes Apple's home page as a URL to open. Select the Apple URL and click the Remove\n  button.\n  \n*Click the Add button. A new item will be added to the URL list.\n  \n*Double-click in the Address field of the item you just added and change the URL to the one you wish to open.\n  \n*Repeat the above steps for each additional URL you wish to open automatically.\n  \n*From the Library pane, drag the 'Display Webpages' action to the workflow pane, below the previous action.\n  \n  \n  Testing the Workflow\nOnce you finish creating your workflow, you can test it to ensure it\n  functions correctly by clicking the Run button in the top right\n  corner.\nBecause we're creating an application, Automator will issue a warning\n  that 'This application will not receive input when run inside\n  Automator.' You can safely ignore this warning by clicking the OK\n  button.\nAutomator will then run the workflow. Check to be sure that all of the\n  applications opened, as well as any folders you may have included. If\n  you wanted to open your browser to a specific page, make sure the\n  correct page loaded.\nSave the Workflow\nOnce you've confirmed that the workflow works as expected, you can\n  save it as an application by clicking Automator's File menu and\n  selecting 'Save.' Enter a name and target location for your workflow\n  application and click Save. Follow the above process to create\n  additional workflows, if desired.\nUsing the Workflow\nIn the previous step, you created a workflow application; now it's\n  time to use it. The application you created works the same as any\n  other Mac application, so you need only double-click the application\n  to run it.\nBecause it works just like any other Mac application, you can also\n  click and drag the workflow application to the Dock, or to a Finder\n  window's sidebar or toolbar, for easy access.\n\n", "Q: Easily disable/enable all network connectivity My work involves trying stuff online and offline, on a Mac. Sometimes a try can be less than 10 seconds of needed offline time. Most of the time I still need to be online.\nInstead of going to Network -> Ethernet/Wifi and disable everything manually, I'd like to know if there is a way to disable it all at once, and re-enable it just as easily.\nI've also simply removed the ethernet cable for a while but that's just ridiculously annoying. Since I'm working on a Mac Mini, that also forces me to have it's back facing me for easier reach, and all cables lying just under my screen/behind my keyboard. While that is an \"okay\" option, I'd like to get rid of it.\nI'm thinking maybe there is an App that could be on the top bar and I'd just tap On/Off.\nI already use the NetworkConditioner which is amazing for simulating lag, but the only \"offline\" I can get here is just \"100% packet loss\" which isn't really offline, it's just infinite lag.\nIf you have an easy on/off switch (ideally on the top bar so I don't have to Alt-Tab between apps) or something similar to airplane mode, I'm all ears ! \n\nA: Damnit. I searched for a while but without using the keywords \"airplane mode osx\" which only came to me when I edited my question here.\nResearch using these words led to a very useful answer available here :\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20130325002258846\n\nIf you go to the Network pane of System Preferences, you'll see a\nLocation popup menu at the top of the window. Click on that menu and\nchoose Edit Locations. Click on the + icon to add a new location, then\nenter a name, such as AirplaneMode. Click on Done.\nNext, choose that location in the Location menu, and click on each\navailable network interface in the list at the left of the window.\nClick on the Configure iPv4 menu, and choose Off. For Wi-Fi, just\nclick on the Turn Wi-Fi Off button. Click Apply, and this location\nwill block all network activity.\nTo activate the location, there are two ways. You can click on the\nApple menu, then Location, and choose the location. Or, if you wish to\ndo this from the command line, as the poster had requested, you can\nrun this command:\nnetworksetup -switchtolocation AirplaneMode\nReplace AirplaneMode with the name you've chosen for the location.\n\nNote : If you've never used the Locations, it won't appear in the Apple menu ; it will appear the first time you make a switch, either using the command line or the Locations menu from the network pane in the settings.\nAlso, making this process easier could be done by adding two terminal files that execute each command separetely. That can be found here\nHere is a summary of the steps found behind that link :\n\n*\n\n*Create a simple shell script, like your example I've made a Hello\nWorld application:\n#!/bin/bash\nnetworksetup -switchtolocation AirplaneMode \n\n\n\n*Save this file as HelloWorld.command.

I'll edit here if I find it, but I think I might have to develop it myself.\n\nA: I made a configuration which is a sort of Airplane mode for Mac OS X, and am regularly using since more than 10 years with no problem and a\nlot of advantages (when under attack, when troubleshooting a process with network problems...).\nSee: Airplane mode for MacOS X\n\nA: why not just remove the Ethernet cable and only connect via WiFi which is so easy, just turn Airport off when you don't want to be connected from the menu bar.

There is no verification code email delivered (even in \"junk\" etc) and no popup to receive a verification code anyway.\nHave others encountered this frustration and if so how did you overcome it?\n\nA: The answer to my questions is that there appears to be an incompatibility between the Apple \"update ID\" process and at least Internet Explorer - so a work round is to use Safari or another PC browser for the update. \nI have not explored further and thus have no further suggestions - others may know the detail but I regret I am unable to suggest more.  \n", "Q: HDMI to DisplayPort Not Working I have a Macbook Pro and a QHD BenQ monitor here.\nShould it be supported to connect these two devices using a HDMI to DisplayPort cable (So HDMI on Macbook DisplayPort on monitor)?\nFor me it just does not work, I tried replugging checking the channel on the monitor and detect monitors, no cigar.\nFor now, I'm back to my apple monitor, well a smaller one than I had before since someone snagged that when I was away. But I'd rather use the BenQ because when you're not living in a cave the Apple monitors are a strain on your eyes (glare reflection etc.).\nAnyhow my question is in the second paragraph.\n\nA: I would go from your mini DisplayPort (mDP) to DisplayPort (DP) or go HDMI to HDMI from your MBP to BenQ.\nThe reason why is that DP (newer standard) supports HDMI (older) signaling quite easily through a passive adapter, while going from HDMI to DP requires active conversion.    This is probably the reason it's not working.\nI have run into this problem before and what I have found to be reliable is to minimize (at worst) to eliminate (at best) the number of conversions you must do.  If your BenQ has a DP connection, I would use its companion technology, mDP to make my connection.\n\nA: Definitely thunderbolt to thunderbolt. Also my BenQ has HDMI so you could do it HDMI -> HDMI \n", "Q: How to Limit Wifi Connection to Only One Application? I need to connect to open Wifi network but I do not want all my applications access internet with it. Only one internet browser. \nI am using at the moment VPN Service PrivateInternetAccess.com (PIA). \nI need Latvian internet access. I need to one wifi connection use Latvian Open Wifi Connection, and let it use only one specific browser. Otherwise, my other Wifi will use my cell phone internet that is connected to PIA's VPN. \n\nHow can you restrict only one internet browser access internet with open wifi connection?\n\nA: Use Little Snitch 3 for that.\nYou can use Automatic Profile Switching for your filter rules depending on the network you are in.\nFor your specific WiFi just block everything except your browser for that.\nhttps://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html\n\n", "Q: How to Make Macbook a Slave Display for Raspberry Pi 3b? I need to get displays for my microprocessors which I need for different tasks. I can have a USB-microUSB-HDMI connection to the ultrabook. \nI am using Macbook Air 2013-mid and El Capitan 10.11.4. \n\nHow can you make Macbook a Slave Display for Raspberry Pi 3b. \n\nA: It's definitely not feasible, and likely impossible. Whatever ports are for video and audio on your MacBook Air would be out, like to an external display, not in. You could possibly disassemble the MacBook Air and spent an absolutely ridiculous amount of time (and maybe money) to maybe get it to work, but really, you just need a separate display.\n\nA: I don't think it is possible...\n", "Q: Is it possible to share files between iCloud Music Libraries? Previously, my wife and I shared a single iTunes store account and had iTunes match. If I added music to my library from outside iTunes, she could see it in her library and download it to her phone.\nNow we have switched to Family Sharing, an Apple Music family plan, and iCloud Music Library (since our collection(s) are far larger than could fit on our phones). She signs into Apple Music with her Apple ID, I sign in with mine, and everything is great. Our customizations in Apple Music don't affect one another.  We still use the shared iTunes account on our Apple TV for kind of joint music access.\nFrom time to time, though, either she or I acquires music from outside the iTunes store, for example directly from an artist or at bandcamp.com or what have you. Does anybody know an easy way for us to share new music additions with one another or the original joint account? The only way I have found so far is for me to AirDrop or Dropbox a folder of music files from my Mac to hers… but that requires tracking what we've downloaded, what we've shared, and for us to be in \"let's do computer busywork together\" mode at the same time. Even worse, since neither of us is signed into that original iTunes account, to update that library I have to sign out of iTunes on my Mac, sign in with the joint account, and add the music, then switch back, and then I have to go through the whole process of iTunes tagging my music for iCloud Music Library and waiting a long time to sync the library.\n\nA: I understand the issue and simply, the answer is no.\nApple's Family Sharing is limited to iTunes purchases (music, movies, TV, books). What it does not provide is access to the main account's full iCloud Music Library. While the main account can add, access, and delete non-iTunes media to the iCloud Music Library, it cannot share that content, even with those in Family Sharing. I think it stinks and cripples the value this service. \nI can only imagine this is Apple (and thusly, music industry) trying to thwart major music peer-sharing in constantly shared \"Family\" libraries.\n\nA: If your wife goes to the purchased section on iTunes on her computer and looks under family member (your) purchases, does she see the music you added?  Then she would tap on it to download onto her computer/device.\n", "Q: How do I add IRCTC tickets to iPhone Wallet I am residing in India. I have iPhone 5s running 9.3.2 I would like to add IRCTC tickets to iPhone Wallet. How do I add them ?\n\nA: You can either get Indian Railway PNR & IRCTC Info or Rail Pass™ - IRCTC PNR status enquiry. Add Indian Railway train ticket to Passbook using RailPass.\nThen book the ticket and use the PNR to generate pass [for Wallet] using these apps. Once the pass is generated, you can add it from there itself.\nI personally prefer Rail Pass™, as it is slick, fast and bug free. More over it doesn't irritate us with ads. \n", "Q: Serve Application from my Mac over LAN I am trying to serve an application I'm developing over the LAN at work. I'm doing this using Apache and this is working fine locally, but when I try to access from another client on the network the http request is timing out.

Leaving it as port 80 also won't conflict with anything. \nWhat you need to look at is your httpd.conf file.  Specifically, the \"Listen\" directive\n# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or\n# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to \n#Listen 12.34.56.78:80\nListen 23736\n\nSince it's working locally, but not on another client (I'm assuming on the same subnet), you may have the directive set as localhost:23736.\nIf that's the case, it would cause the symptoms that you are seeing.\nWhat you should have is what I posted above, or to restrict it to a particular IP:\nListen 172.18.48.240:23736\nOnce you make the change, restart Apache.\n", "Q: Saving screenshots with name of title bar On Windows I use GreenShots, which by default saves each screenshot with a timestamp followed by the name on the title bar.\nI'd like to replace the \"Screen Shot DATE at TIME\" with \"YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS Whatever on Title Bar\".\nThis would make my screenshots easier to:\n\n\n*\n\n*order by date, just ordering them by name\n\n*find out with a simple search (looking at the title)\n\n\nIs some way achieve this?\n\nA: Here is the appleScript that would achieve what you are looking for:\ndo shell script \"screencapture -W ~/tmp\"\ndelay 3\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set frontApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true\nend tell\ntell application frontApp\n    if the (count of windows) is not 0 then\n        set window_name to name of front window\n    end if\nend tell\nset screenShotName to do shell script \"date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S_\"\nset screenShotName to screenShotName & window_name\ndo shell script \"mv ~/tmp ~/\\\"\" & screenShotName & \"\\\".png\"\n\nCopy and paste the above into appleScript editor then save it as an app, you can name it whatever you want. \nDouble click the app icon select the window you want screenshoted and then make sure that you click that window to ensure it is the front one.\n", "Q: Menu bar missing on second screen after El Capitan update 10.11.5 I was on El Capitan 10.11.4 and just updated to 10.11.5.

I can't find a shortcut that's working on my MacBook Air. In Windows you can either click the rightmost part of the task bar to show the desktop or hit Windows+D to show the desktop. How do I do this in El Capitan?\n\nA: One way is to set a Hot Corner to show the Desktop.\nThis is done via: System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver > Screen Saver > Hot Corners...\nThen select Desktop in the pop-up list for the corner you'd like to show the Desktop when you move the mouse to that corner.\n\n\nA: The default shortcut for showing the Desktop is:\n⌘Cmd-F3\nTechnically, the official name is ⌘Cmd-Mission Control but unless you know what \"Mission Control\" is, you would end up searching for that as well.\n\nApple has a really good listing of all it's shortcuts - I keep this bookmarked for quick reference.\n\nA: Under Keyboard > Shortcuts in System Preferences, you'll see the Show Desktop shortcut within the Mission Control category. You can set it to whatever you want.\n\n\nA: If you don't really like the Cmd+F3 option (the apps hovering at the corners don't really feel like \"I've reached my desktop\" for me) and need the exact same Windows-style Windows+D feature, you can try this,\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new desktop\n\n*For the most frequently used applications on your dock, right-click on them, and select Options->Desktop 2.\n\n*Go to System Preferences->Keyboard->Shortcuts->Mission Control and assign shortcuts for your main desktop and desktop 2. \n\n\nLo and behold, you have a shortcut to reach your desktop. This system works really well for me and helps me multi-task very well. It also has the added advantage of not minimizing any windows. All windows are a desktop away.\nI also set my Finder app to launch in my main desktop as I use it to browse and open files, which open in other desktops.\nOf course, this won't work for new apps unless you set the option for them too explicitly. But I feel the purpose behind the question was to improve your everyday workflow, which would only involve frequently-used applications. And this option will definitely help.

Simply add one Run Shell Script Action  to your Automator Workflow and add the following code:\nuptime | pbcopy\npbpaste | say\n\n\nThis pipes the output of uptime to the clipboard and then pipes the content of the clipboard to the say command.  The output of the uptime command is still on the clipboard to paste elsewhere, either by additional commands and or using the keyboard and or other normal methods of pasting from the clipboard.\nNote: I'm assuming that when you say \"use one task instead of three\", you're actually referring to an Automator Action, e.g. Run Shell Script, not the number of commands written into that on Action.\n", "Q: iPhone 6S, Delete HiCalculator App How do you uninstall the HiCalculator app?

It got to the step where it restarts after the install and now it just hangs on this screen.\n\nI've tried restarted a few times and it keeps coming back to this. Tried booting in safe mode as well, with no luck.\nI get the startup chime, then this. It's sat on this for a few hours at this point with no additional progress.\nMachine specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*2.4 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 Processor \n\n*4GB 1333MHz DDR3 SDRAM\n\n*500 GB Hard Drive, 8x DVD/CD SuperDrive\n\n\nA: I had the same issue with a MacBook Pro 15'' 2011 (A1286) that I tried updating from Lion 10.7.5 to El Capitan 10.11 (Specs. 4 GB, 500 GB HDD).\nThe answer is: you must be very patient: the upgrade took me one full day (~ 11 hours!). \nEven if the progress bar is not updated, the update is being done in the background.\nAfter a first attempt that I interrupted because I thought that the update was frozen, I made a second Internet recovery of Lion.\nThe previously downloaded installer of OS X El Capitan was kept in the Application folder after OS X Lion 10.7.5 was restored, so that I was not required to download it again. \n(The Internet recovery of Lion lasted about 4 hours).\nAs a comment to your picture, if you wait about half an hour, to one hour, the progress bar should move to ~20%.\nThe estimated times will then be completely wrong and you simply MUST WAIT and be very patient, without shutting down your computer. For instance, when under the progress bar, a remaining duration of 31 minutes is displayed, it can last about 9 hours using a wired connection! For me, things went a little quicker at the end (12 minutes meant 1 hours, 7 minutes meant half an hour).\nSometimes, the screen will show greyed / disabled, like if the computer was frozen in some manner and there might be some kind of screen flashing / flickering. Simply wait until the installation ends and the background image of El Capitan displays.\nHope this will help others.\n", "Q: How to convert an epub package to regular epub? I have some epub files in my iCloud Drive that are essentially packages.  I can show package contents and then it shows me a hierarchy of files and folders.\nHow can I convert this structure to a standard epub that any regular epub reader will understand?\n\nA: An ePub file is essentially just a zipped folder, though it has a mimetype file inside which apparently needs to not be compressed.\nThis would imply that it's not completely straightforward to recreate with a simple zip app. However, it may be simpler than that.\nLet's assume nothing has actually unpacked it, merely got confused about how to deal with it. Work on a copy.\nTwo things to try...\n\n\n*\n\n*Try just renaming it, change .epub to .zip, then change it back again, see if it's recognised correctly.\n\n*Open it in Calibre\nYou than have a myriad ways to deal with it, simplest is see if it can talk to your ebook reader via OPDS. Calibre can run its own local server on your wifi & you can copy books over very simply.\nIf still no joy, get Calibre to convert it to an ePub [again] This is a great method for fixing a file, as it can re-examine it, fix fonts, bad hyphenations, all kinds of issues.\nCalibre itself is too big a subject to really cover in a simple QA, but there are reams of data about it on the site itself & at http://www.mobileread.com/forums/ including sections for most major e-readers too.\n\nA: Reproduction of the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*A ePub file named, say, book.epub is a file (-rw-r--r--).\n\n*Open book.epub using iBooks app.\n\n*Take out the cached file stored in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books/, which has been renamed to another name such as A22DFAF7E75C21D979C375B1AD07008F.epub and becomes a directory (drwxr-xr-x@).\n\n\nSteps of the work-around that works on my Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change extension of A22DFAF7E75C21D979C375B1AD07008F.epub from .epub to .zip.\n\n*Go into the zip package and zip up all the contents inside into a new .zip file, say, Archive.zip.\n\n*Drag out the new .zip file and change extension back to .epub.\n\n*The Archive.epub file is a file (-rw-r--r--).\n\n\nA: FWIW, here's a shell command that works:\n cd my-broken.epub\n\n # iTunes/Books seems to add a file \n # 'iTunesMetadata.plist', and it produces a warning.\n # May also contain private data, so better delete it.\n\n rm iTunesMetadata.plist \n\n zip -X -r ../fixed.epub mimetype *\n\nAs far as I can tell, compression does not need to be deactivated (-0). epubcheck has no complaints. There might be differences between versions of the epub spec, however. My test was with an epub 3.0 file. \n\nA: How iBooks imports an ePub file:\nA .epub file, as noted in other answers, is essentially a zipped up file. When iBooks imports the .epub file, the .epub file it stores is an unzipped file. This explains why it has the Show Package Contents option which lets you explore the \"unzipped\" files. However, just zipping the package doesn't always work.\nRe-creating the .epub file from the package:\nManually:\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the .epub file and click on Show Package Contents.\n\n*Select all the contents (CMD + A) → Right click → Compress.\n\n*This will create a .zip file. Simply change the extension from .zip to .epub and voila! The file has become an ePub document.\n\nAutomation:\nI had more than 2,000 .epub packages I wanted to convert to .epub files, so the above method wasn't feasible. To avoid the manual labor, I wrote a script that essentially runs the above method on all the files. I used the simple and elegant shell code provided by Matthias here and wrapped it in a python script shared below:\n# Convert epub packages to epub files\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\nfilenames = []\npath_to_files = \"\"\n#   Function to store all filenames in a list\ndef extract_filename(path_to_files):    # \"/Users/****/Desktop/Old_epubs\"\n    os.chdir(path_to_files)\n    books = os.getcwd()\n    for f in os.listdir(books):\n        f_name, f_ext = os.path.splitext(f)\n        if f_ext == \".epub\":\n            filenames.append(f_name)\n\n    filenames.sort()\n\n#   Function to generate new epub files\ndef create_epub(path_to_new_files): # \"/Users/****/Desktop/new_epubs/\"\n    total_files = len(filenames)\n    for i in range(total_files):\n        epub_path = \"cd \" + path_to_files\n        filename = filenames[i] + \".epub\"\n        zipping = \" zip -X -r \" + path_to_new_files + filename + \" mimetype *\"\n        plist = \"rm iTunesMetadata.plist\"\n        comm = epub_path + filename + \"; \" + plist + \"; \" + zipping\n        p1 = subprocess.run(comm, capture_output = True, text = True, shell = True)\n        success = p1.returncode\n        if success == 0:\n            rem_files = total_files - i + 1\n            print(\"File #\", i+1, \" has been processed successfully. Remaining files: \", rem_files)\n\n#   Enter the paths\nextract_filename(\"/Users/****/Desktop/Books\")   # Path to directory containing epub packages\ncreate_epub(\"/Users/****/Desktop/new_epubs/\")   # Path to store new epub files in\n\nThe extract_filename function takes a path to a directory that contains the .epub packages that need to be converted.\n[WARNING] It is best to work on a copy of the .epub packages in case something goes wrong. To be safe, just copy the packages to a different directory and work on that.\nThe create_epub function takes a path to a directory where you want to store the generated files. It then runs a shell command to open each .epub package and generate a .epub file.\n\nHope this helps! It certainly solved a big headache of mine.\n\nA: I've taken some of the comments here and provided a Jupyter notebook that does this for a backup of say a Books directory:\nimport pathlib\nimport glob\nimport os\nimport zipfile\n\n# Extract the relevant components of a full path\ndef pathComponents(fullpath):\n    path = pathlib.Path(fullpath)\n    name = path.name\n    stem = path.stem\n    suffix = path.suffix\n    parent = path.parent\n    return name, stem, suffix, parent\n\n# Get directories in your path that have a .epub suffix\ndef getePubDirs(path):\n    epubSearch = os.path.join(path, \"*\" + \".\" + \"epub\")\n    eDirs=[]\n    for p in glob.glob(epubSearch):\n        if (os.path.isdir(p)):    # Only if it's an epub directory\n            eDirs.append(p)\n    return eDirs\n\ndef createZipFile(fname, files):\n    zFile = zipfile.ZipFile(fname, mode='w', compression=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)\n    for f in files:\n        zFile.write(f)\n    zFile.close()\n\ndef convertDirToePub(dirname):\n    name, stem, suffix, parent = pathComponents(dirname)        # get dirname details\n    newdirname = zFile = str(parent) + \"/\" + name + \".ori\"\n    zFile = str(parent) + \"/\" + stem + \".epub\"\n    os.rename(dirname,newdirname)     # rename the epub dir so the epub can take its old name\n    # get all the files within the epub directory\n    os.chdir(newdirname) # We need to be in directory so the resultant epub paths are correct\n    everything = [os.path.join(r,file) for r,d,f in os.walk(\".\") for file in f]\n    createZipFile(zFile, everything)  # Create a zip file containing all those files\n    os.chdir(parent)\n\ndirtoconvert='/Users/<username>/tmp/Booksdir'\n\neDirs = getePubDirs(dirtoconvert)\ntotalDirs=len(eDirs)\nprint(totalDirs, \"docs to convert\")\nctr=1\nfor i in eDirs:\n    print(ctr, \"of\", totalDirs, \": Converting \", i)\n    convertDirToePub(i)\n    ctr = ctr + 1\nprint(\"Done!\")\n\n\nA: I have adapted the methods shared here, and created the following shell script.\nIt's pretty simplistic as it does not take any arguments, it just runs from the directory it is executed in.\nThe script adds a fixed directory if there isn't one already, where it places the fixed files.\nYou can either add it to a file, i.e. fix_epub.sh.

I have a 2011 iMac with only Ubuntu installed. It's not a dual-booted iMac, it only has Ubuntu installed.\nHow do I revert back to original OS X and remove Ubuntu? I've tried pressing various keys (⌘ Command R, Alt, etc.) to enter the boot menu,  but so far it hasn't worked.\n\nA: I have installed only Ubuntu. it warned that i may not be able to recover. However, if you hold Alt (option) key since the booting, it will prompt you to select a Wireless network (so make sure there's one available). Once connected it will ask you to confirm on Internet Recovery Mode. Select the option and proceed.

Check that all network traffic is sent to the VPN provider.\n\n*Download and install a type-2 hypervisor like VirtualBox or Parallels Desktop\n\n*Set up the NAT network of the hypervisor with different network settings than the internal network of the VPN provider, your own network and your school's network.\nExamples:\nParallels: \n\nVirtualBox:\n\nPossible networks may be private networks in 172.16.0.0/12 (e.g. 172.18.8.0/24)\n\n*Create a new VM hull and attach it to this NAT network.\n\n*Install a familiar OS (e.g OS X 10.9-10.11) in this VM\n\n*Set up a VPN connection in the VM to your school's VPN server in Sweden in the VPN in System Preferences -> Network, shut down the VM and quit the hypervisor.\n\n*Connect to NordVPN in the non-virtualized OS\n\n*Start the VM\n\n*Connect to the school's VPN server in the virtualized OS\n\n\ntested with a Parallels VM (OS X 10.11) and a private VPN server (Cisco IPSec) and an iMac (OS X 10.9) and VyprVPN (OpenVPN)\n", "Q: Various iOS apps log out randomly, lose all data & settings I've been experiencing an issue that has causing me a lot of problems, as various apps including Whatsapp, Telegram, Linkedin, Authy, Lastpass, and more will randomly log out, and reset back to their inital state as if I just installed it on a clean phone. Apps like Whatsapp and Telegram will have lost all of their chat history, even if it was backup up on iCloud.\nI've talked with Apple and they're adamant the problem is not with the hardware or with iOS after restoring the phone using iTunes. Whatsapp support is just giving me the run around with canned responses, so I doubt they know anything about the problem either.\nI'm at a total loss as to what might be causing this problem after restoring the phone multiple times (the last time without restoring to a backup).\nMy phone is an iPhone 6S 64GB running iOS 9.3.2 although this problem has existed well before iOS 9.3.2 was released.\n\nA: A found a 'satisfactory' workaround. As I commented on the question, I was having the bug after I decided to close all applications using the app switcher and then start every application on my phone.\nMy 'solution' is to close all applications in the app switcher and then turn off the device. Then, turn on the phone. \nSince that, I have not had problems.\n", "Q: Carbon Copy Cloner shell script for ejecting the source drive I created a backup system for a friend, using Carbon Copy Cloner. The system has been up and running since January, but it needs regular intervention. \nThe main problem is that external hard drives are not ejected before disconnecting. When plugged in, the system does not recognize them, and that's when I intervene and get it to recognize them again. \nBy using CCC's \"after run tasks\" function, which gives you the option to ask it to unmount the destination drive after backing up, I've been able to solve half the problem. CCC is automatically mounting and unmounting the destination only as needed. So anytime the destination drive is removed, its always already ejected.\nI'd like for this to work for some of the source drives as well.  Of course its not necessary for the laptop's main drive, but there are a number of external drives that are frequently used off site.  After they're used, I'd like them to back up at the end of the day, and then eject when they're done.\nI've found CCC's shell script for ejecting the destination: \nsource=\"$1\"\ndest=\"$2\"\nexitStatus=$3\n\n####Inserted script to run only if backup successful (exitStatus=0)\n\nif [ \"$exitStatus\" = \"0\" ]; then\n    # foo\nelse\n    # bar\nfi\n\n####Eject destination drive\n\ndevID=`diskutil info \"$2\" | awk '/Device Identifier/ {print $NF}'`\nif [ \"$devID\" != \"\" ]; then\n    (sleep $delay; diskutil unmountDisk \"$devID\"; diskutil eject \"$devID\") &\nelse\n    (sleep $delay; diskutil eject \"$2\"; if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then diskutil    unmountDisk \"$2\"; fi) &\nfi\n\nI think this would work the same for the source drive, if I change it to:\nsource=\"$1\"\ndest=\"$2\"\nexitStatus=$3\n\nif [ \"$exitStatus\" = \"0\" ]; then\n    # foo\nelse\n    # bar\nfi\n\ndevID=`diskutil info \"$1\" | awk '/Device Identifier/ {print $NF}'`\nif [ \"$devID\" != \"\" ]; then\n    (sleep $delay; diskutil unmountDisk \"$devID\"; diskutil eject \"$devID\") &\nelse\n    (sleep $delay; diskutil eject \"$1\"; if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then diskutil    unmountDisk \"$1\"; fi) &\nfi\n\nI'm not completely sure how this script works, so before I try this out, does anyone see a problem?\n\nA: It's much simpler for the source, the following should be sufficient:\n#!/bin/sh\ndiskutil eject \"$1\"\n\nMike\n\nA: On Mac OS X Server 10.6.8, Sarah's replacement of $2 with $1 in the shell script for ejecting the destination does work to eject the source.\n", "Q: Logitech mouse used on El Capitan I CANNOT get my mouse to easily move from one monitor to another. I literally have to wave the mouse in the direction of the other monitor and that sometimes works, though it's very clumsy. I can't understand this weird problem. The mouse just does not want to go the other monitor, no matter which monitor. If I'm on one, I can't get to the other .\n\nA: If you look at System Prefs > Displays  > Arrangement, does it look like this?\n\nor more like this?\n\nIf it looks more like the latter, then you will only be able to drag the cursor from one screen to another at the point they intersect on that picture. Trying to cross the border anywhere else will not work.\nAlso make sure that the arrangement in the picture is an actual representation of your physical layout & not, for instance that your secondary screen is represented at the wrong side of the primary. If so you can just drag it to a better position.\nClicking one of the monitors on the control panel will edge it in red, on the picture & also your actual screen itself, so you know for certain which you are moving.

I can add new material at the bottom but cannot delete what was exchanged previously.  This is causing my messages to people to keep building up in size with the total message being everything I ever sent to them plus what I'm sending as a new message.\nHow can I just send them a brand new message without the entire conversation with them over the past year being prepended to it?  I don't want to delete the previous messages from cache, just don't want them to be included in the new message.\n\nA: The history is just for you. Only the message in the box is sent when you send a message, not the entire history. The recipient keeps their own history of messages which is unrelated to your history.\nThis is not email where a reply to a message includes a quoted copy of the original — each message is self-contained and it's up to the receiver to keep a historical copy of messages, which is what your device is doing for you.\n\nA: I'm assuming this is iMessage because it happens to me, too. However, when you send a new message, and you see the history, the new message isn't sent with all that history attached. Only your new message is sent, the history is just for you to see.\n\nA: You're not sending them all the past messages, it's just loading up your past conversation, and your text is the next message in the conversation. You could get it so it doesn't save message histories and then you wouldn't see past messages, or you can have it so it does save messages histories and you do see past messages. But it's just what you see that's different.\n", "Q: MacBook gets heated up I am running on macbook pro 2015. Since, few days, I have noticed a significant degradation in it's performance.

I have only one decision - wait when OS X remove this bug itself.\n\nA: I think I might know what is going on.

When I opened the browser (or a new tab) it switched the focus to the Google Homepage Search Box. \nUnder \"Preferences / General / ...\" changing the settings \"New windows open with\" and \"New tabs open with\" to something other than a website page fixed the issue for me and now any time I open a new browser window or tab the focus is set to the Safari Search bar.\n\nA: I think I might have a soft solution.\n\n*\n\n*Exit from full screen\n\n*Enter full screen again\n\nThis seems to fix the problem for me.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 calendar What does show all future user events mean in iPhone5 calendar? I am not sure whether to choose \n\n\n*\n\n*Choose only this event or \n\n*Choose all future events when I schedule a birthday\n\n\nA: This is displayed for recurring calendar events.  It looks like you're either trying to delete an event or edit an event.  The calendar needs to know if you want that change to affect a single instance of the event or all instances of the event in the future.  It depends on how the event was setup.\nFor example, when adding a new event you can choose how often you want the event to occur from the Repeat menu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Every day:   It occurs every day, at the same time.\n\n*Every week:  It occurs at the same time, on the same day, every week.\n\n*Every month: It occurs at the same time, on the same day, every month.\n\n*Every year:  It occurs at the same time, on the same day, every year.\n\n*Custom:  It occurs at the same time, on custom days.

Unfortunately, right now I read information that the best place for SSD is the main bay of HDD not the optical bay. So I want to replace SSD to the main bay and HDD to the optical bay.\nMy question is: it's possible without reinstalling the system? \nI'm asking because I not fully understand how Fusion Drive works. When I make coreStorage and I put the names of disks (For instance, /dev/disk0 and /dev/disk1) how it determines where is the SSD and where is the HDD? By manufacture information? So it means that I can replace SSD and HDD vice-versa and it's gonna be fine or coreStorage stores information about each drive how it was determine: first - SSD - /dev/disk0, second - HDD - /dev/disk1?\n\nA: I did the trick by Trent Fitzpatrick's recommendation. Everything works. Speed doesn't changed. Probably it's because I've just made a Fusion Drive and there need some time, probably it doesn't affect at all. But Write 120mb/s and Read 380 mb/s really slow for Fusion Drive I guess.\nI'll wait some time and if speed doesn't will change I guess I'll replace SSD and HDD again because HDD tray has some shock protection.\n", "Q: record AppleTV output with USB Type-C cable and Quicktime.

If you know which configurations caused this problem please post your answer \nI didn't find out why this error occurs, but I solve the problem every time this error appears by running this command:\n$ brew services restart polipo\nStopping `polipo`... (might take a while)\n==> Successfully stopped `polipo` (label: homebrew.mxcl.polipo)\n==> Successfully started `polipo` (label: homebrew.mxcl.polipo)\n\nAfter restarting polipo instance, that error disappears.\nNOTE: This command should be executed OUT of a tmux session. In a tmux session it will not work:\n$ brew services restart polipo\n~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.polipo.plist: Operation not permitted\n==> Successfully started `polipo` (label: homebrew.mxcl.polipo)\n\nIf you are running such a session, detach the session with control+b (or any prefix key combination you set) and then press d. Now run that command.\nTHE BEST ALTERNATIVE: I used reattach-to-user-namespace to restart polipo service directly from tmux session:\n$ brew install reattach-to-user-namespace\n\nthen brew services will work.\nUPDATE: I found that my local polipo cache size is enough large:\n$ du -d0 -h /usr/local/var/cache/polipo\n13.8G    /usr/local/var/cache/polipo\n\nThere is a \"purge\" function that is explained here:\n\nThe behavior of the -x flag is controlled by three configuration variables. The variable diskCacheUnlinkTime specifies the time during which an on-disk entry should remain unused before it is eligible for removal; it defaults to 32 days.\n\nSo I stopped polipo daemon with brew services:\n$ brew services stop polipo\n$ polipo -x\n$ brew services start polipo\n\nNow the size of local cache is reduced:\n$ du -d0 -h /usr/local/var/cache/polipo\n2.1G    /usr/local/var/cache/polipo\n\nAnd it seems that the error is gone.\n", "Q: When iOS says \"there are items are that could not be synced\" Where in iTunes can I see more information? When you get a sync error (somewhat notorious since it's not documented where in iTunes to look for these sync errors) - the iPhone tells you to look in iTunes to see what it was that couldn't be synced. \nInterestingly enough iTunes doesn't actually tell you what it was that couldn't be synced. \n\nMy question is: Where precisely in iTunes can I see this more information?\n\nA: I struggled with this, too. After following several dead ends (from Google searches, e.g., suggesting deleting photo caches, which had no effect on the warning messages for me), and not knowing of @hawkeye's useful information, I noticed that there was a small warning symbol (triangle with an exclamation mark in it) in iTunes, between my device's name and the device eject symbol, at the top of the device panel on the left. When I clicked on the warning symbol, a message popped up describing what the problem was; see the image. (In my case, I didn't have enough free space to replace a particularly large app.)  Apple sure could make this more obvious!\nBy the way, you can get an unsynced item warning on the device when there isn't a problem, due to stale data in iTunes. You can eliminate the device warning by resetting dialog warnings and the iTunes Store cache in the Advanced section of iTunes preferences; there are two buttons there you can push. This solved a mysterious sync warning problem for me in the past.\n\n\nA: It turns out it is available in iTunes - but not in an obvious place like a dialog that collects all the errors for you to review in a dashboard.\nTo identify this specific error - here is how I find the problems with my sync:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes:\n\n*Select Library\n\n*Select 'Movies' or 'Music'\n\n*Go to the View menu and select View As -> List\n\n*Look at the list of items - and scroll down to the bottom. \n\n*Observe that the items down the bottom have an exclamation mark next to them. \n\n*Right click the Item and select Delete. \n\n\nAlternatively, you could stop syncing that class of content as well if you wanted to search for the files on the computer rather than delete the record of library items that are now unable to sync.\n", "Q: Cannot reach webpage for certificate generation on my developer account I am trying to reach the webpage for certificates under developer.apple.com.

Question Details:\nIs it possible to make your macbookpro retina (2015) to hibernate (hibernate mode 25 i.e. fully powered off) via a shortcut? I still want it to go to sleep (the usual default safesleep) when closing the lid. Put differently: I would like to achieve the same settings that I had on Windows.\nWindows setting:\nOn my Windows (7) laptop, besides shutdown and restart, I have the option of 2 settings: sleep or hibernate. Either pressing the sleep button on my keyboard or hibernating via the start menu (by pressing the start menu, clicking the right direction button and then clicking the \"Hibernate\" button). Neither method requires me to close the laptop lid.\nApple Mac OS Assumption:\nI am under the impression that Mac OS has the ability to hibernate just like a Windows PC - i.e. totally powered off. In order to trigger this, I must first enable this feature [sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25] and then trigger it by closing the lid. Please correct me if I'm mistaken about this. If I'm not mistaken, please see below:\nSituation:\nI've just started using a Macbookpro (V10.10). I like how it goes to sleep when closing the lid. However, I would like the option to hibernate via a button/keybaord shortcut. I understand I can change the hibernate mode to hibernate 25 via pmset. However, this makes the macbook go to hibernate whenever I close the lid - I don't want it to hibernate when closing the lid, rather just hibernate via a button/shortcut.\n\nA: This shortcut isn't defined.\nYou could write a small shell script:\ncat >hibernate <<eof\n/usr/bin/sudo pmset hibernatemode 25\npmset sleepnow\n/usr/bin/sudo pmset hibernatemode 3\neof\n\nmake it executable:\nchmod u+x hibernate\n\nand test it:\n./hibernate\n\nThis small shell script will ask you your password and won't echo it\nto get admin priviledge, and then make hibernate immediatly your Mac.\nUpon wakeup, you will be able to verify that an image on disk was\ncleanly made with:\nls -l /var/vm/sleepimage\n\nand you will be able to check that the hibernatemode was reset to 3,\nthus letting the action of closing the lid making a normal sleep.\nIf you are satisfied with this shell script, the next step will\nrequire to define a shortcut to fire a shell script (and this is\nanother question).\nI put a cleaner version of this shell script on GitHub:\nhibernate shell script\nMost notably, it will save the previous value of hibernatemode and restore it on wakeup.\n", "Q: Allow Safari extensions to access files I installed a Safari extension.

Running my custom command vpnpw in terminal works perfectly fine. However, AppleScript's do shell script says it's unknown.\nDoes anyone know how to make these custom executables available globally?\n\nA: What's the fully qualified pathname of the executable?  If it's not within in the $PATH that's passed to the do shell script command, which is /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin, then you'll need to use the fully qualified pathname of the executable.\nTo make an executable available globally, it must be in a directory that's included in the $PATH.\nYou can also add an alias or symbolic link to the target executable to a directory that's in the $PATH if you do not want to either append the path to it in the $PATH however keep in mind if the executable is dependent on files that are within its directory then adding the directory path to the $PATH is what you'll need to do.\n", "Q: After waking-up, how do you know if your mac was hibernating (fully powered off like Windows PC) and not sleeping? Not sure if my Macbookpro Retina 2015 is waking up from sleep, safesleep or hibernation.\nI have enabled hibernatemode 25 (via terminal command: sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25). pmset -g shows hibernatemode is indeed 25.\nIs this mode the equivalent of the Windows 7 hibernate and or, the hibernate button on the 'Deepsleep' widget/mac app http://www.axoniclabs.com/DeepSleep/ or the other 'Deep Sleep' app's sleep button http://deepsleep.free.fr ?\n\nA: When you wake a Mac from hibernation, RAM got written to disk and power removed from memory. Then, at wake, it gets read back into RAM.  This takes longer than normal, or standby sleep (depending on the delay set) and is visible at wake time by showing an Apple symbol and progress bar underneath (white time markers filling up).\nAlso running the following command in Terminal:\npmset -g log | grep -i \"wake from\"\n\nwill show the sleep states, e.g. \n\nWake from Hibernate \n  Wake from Normal Sleep \n  Wake from Standby\n\nThe last time I saw the 'Deepsleep' widget in action, it did the same as hibernation, i.e. write to disk and remove power from memory.\nPS.\nAs the man pages (man pmset) hint in the quote below, standby and autopoweroff should be set to the value \"0\", via the same pmset command you've used to set hibernatemode, to set your MacBook Pro to use hibernation instead of normal, or standby sleep (I would also disable any Energy Saver System Preferences to wake your Mac periodically): \n\nFor example, on desktops that support standby a hibernation image\n  will be written after the specified standbydelay time. To disable\n  hibernation images completely, ensure hibernatemode standby and\n  autopoweroff are all set to 0.\n\nPPS.

Using an iPad makes it more complicated unless you want to purchase an app.  I've used LogMeIn for a while, but that app was about $99.\nIf you have another Mac at work Apple has an app for $80 called \"Remote Desktop\".  Open your system preferences on the Mac you want to control and check \"Remote Management\" then install the app.  \nFor either solution you will need to know your IP at home.

It also accepts a stereo miniplug-to-RCA cable adapter for connecting stereo equipment to the computer.\nOptical audio input is SPDIF format and uses a standard TOSLINK cable with a TOSLINK mini-plug adapter, accepting up to 24-bit stereo and 44.1-96kHz sampling rate.\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202638\n", "Q: MacOSX El Capitan: admin password only working from login screen Since a week or so, I have a very strange issue on my Mac...

I was briefly in contact with Apple support, and I want to empty iCloud of photos and videos completely (basically down to 0 bytes). I want to do this to make sure that the storage usage is properly calculated.\nAfter deleting all Photo/Video content in iCloud, I then want to restore the photos, videos, and preferably also all meta data (dates, folders, locations…) in its entirety.\nQuestion: What would be the suggestible way to accomplish this?\nI have Photos on my iMac set to \"Download and keep all originals\". Can I simply make a backup of Photos Library.photoslibrary, then go to iCloud.com and delete everything in the \"Photos app\", and somehow restore everything from the photoslibrary file?\nI want to be absolutely sure that everything on iCloud is properly saved and restored. Even if that means that I have to download everything from iCloud.com – in case that the photoslibrary file for some discrepant reason may be incomplete relative to what's actually in iCloud.\n\nA: \"Download and keep all originals\" is the correct setting to get all your photos onto your Mac. These originals are stored in Photos Library.photoslibrary, you can check the exact location of your library by launching the photos app while pressing option.\nYou can also check for syncing problems by creating a smart album, looking for files failed to sync.\nAfter you have double-checked all of the above and saved your library on a secure place you go to System Preferences -> iCloud and choose Manage in the lower right corner (I don't know the exact translation, I'm using my Mac in another language). In the popup menu, choose photos and then delete from iCloud Drive.\nThe photos will be stored online for the next 30 days, so you are able to download them again, in case you made a mistake. After that period (make yourself a calendar entry) you can activate iCloud Photo Library again, and all your files will be uploaded again.\n", "Q: How can I edit the .bash_profile? I want to use matplotlib in Python, but it gives me this error:\n\nValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8\n\nSo I searched the internet and people suggest that I should edit my .bash_profile. But when I open it I can't edit since it is locked! So I searched about unlocking .bash_profile, this time people suggest using this command in terminal:\nsudo chown My username ~/.bash_profile\n\nBut after entering my password, it says:\n\nchown: My username: illegal user name\n\nWhy does it say my user name is illegal? I have no idea what to do about. I would appreciate if someone can help me.\n\nA: Try the following command:\nchown $(id -u -n) ~/.bash_profile\n\nUsing the chown command in that way, you can be sure that is using your username (id -u -n).\nAdditionally, as @user3439894 says, if you get permission errors with previous command, your should add sudo before the command to execute the command as root:\nsudo chown $(id -u -n) ~/.bash_profile\n\nFrom id man page:\n\nid - print real and effective user and group IDs\n-n, --name: print a name instead of a number\n  -u, --user: print only the effective user ID\n\nFrom chown man page (suggested by @fd0):\n\nFor obvious security reasons, the ownership of a file may only be altered by a super-user.\n\n\nA: Have you tried editing the bash_profile from the home directory? This honestly shouldn't be locked for any reason. The simple gui approach here would be to unlock via get info in finder (I'm assuming you're on a mac).\n", "Q: Can't install Flash - Installation failed This week my El Capitan system reported that the Flash player was out of date.  So I did the usual thing and went to Adobe, downloaded the latest (21 A) installer and kicked it off. After entering my password, the installer went through the usual \"downloading ..\" part and commenced on the installation part, at which point it failed, showing me this:\n\nWhat I did was the same as I had done many times before, but this time it failed - and I tried multiple times and also downloaded the installer multiple times.  \nAny ideas?\n\nA: I had this problem on & off for years, it's something to do with my firewall, which I've never been prepared to fiddle with just so I can get an online installer to function properly. \nThe simplest workaround is to go get the full downloadable .dmg version instead of the online installer.\nFor the past few years, it's been located at http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/flashplayer/distribution3.html\nor you can Google \"adobe flash player offline installer download\" which always finds it.\nI did eventually find a solution to my Flash problems...\n... I uninstalled Flash from every machine in the building ;-)\n\nA: I had the same problem and after hours of installing, rebooting, and dredging through archives, I  finally solved the problem by opening Library > Internet Plugins and dragging Flash Player plug in and flashplayer.xpt in from an old backup. And hey presto, Flash Player is back.\n\nA: I had the same problem, updating Flash in OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan), and the solutions posted here didn't work, including the accepted solution from May 2016 pointing to \"distribution3.html\" at Adobe, which currently (Nov 2016) redirects to a new page providing only the web installer. After multiple searches, I learned that that page had a deprecation message on it for about a year before Adobe removed it and redirected.\nAnnoyingly, the place to go for a fix appears to be an ever-moving target—Adobe's way to help us all love Flash even more. As of early Nov 2016, the full download version is here:\nInstallation problems | Flash Player | Mac\nWho knows where it will be next month.  The self-contained installer there (18.9 MB) worked without problems for me.  Find it in the \"Still having problems?\" section near the bottom of the page.\n\nA: Ensure you enable Active Scripting - select Internet options, security, scripting, active scripting (last option at bottom of list). This fixed it for me.\nCheers.\n\nA: I had the same issue. I installed OS X Sierra and then installed Flash again without any problem.\n", "Q: Why does iTunes sync take so long? I am trying to sync my iTunes music to my iPhone. It takes a really long time (> 20 mins) when I try to do so. \na) Has anyone else run into this ? How did you fix it in that case?\nb) Is there a way I can work around the iTunes sync process to copy media to my iPhone? \n\nA: Assuming there is nothing wrong with your setup and that there isn't anything causing additional delays to your sync, you might want to consider two things that impact the iTunes sync speed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Encoding of audio files as they get loaded on to your iDevice.\n\n*Speed of USB 2.0 interface @ 480Mbit/sec.\n\n\nThe first one would only apply if you are syncing new audio files to your device and you have the option enabled for downsampling AAC/MP3 files. It is convenient if you want to minimize space, but you can tick a box that says any audio file you put on your iDevice will be adjusted down to a (say) 128Kbps bitrate to save space on the iDevice. If you have this, it does the encode single-threaded while you're syncing and thus adds time to the sync but for the obvious benefit of taking up far less space on the iDevice.\nThe second point is the far more likely culprit since you're probably moving megabytes or gigabytes of data around. Pictures on a recent iPhone take a few MB each, videos you captured can run into the hundreds of MB and naturally DVDs/iTunes movies probably take closer to a gigabyte. If iTunes is deciding to take a backup as it does periodically, that could be the size of your phone (16GB/64GB/128GB/etc.) Now pumping this through a 480Mbit/sec USB 2.0 interface would theoretically get a maximum of 48MB/sec, though USB overhead probably chops 20% off of that so maybe you're getting 40MB/sec so for a backup of 16GB of iDevice data it would take nearly 6 minutes.\nPresumably the lightning interface can handle USB 3.0 speeds, but only the iPad Pro as of 2015 apparently has that capability, though I don't think Apple has officially enabled that yet (as of May 2016) so we don't know how fast it could go and I don't think Apple has published the specs. For all your other devices, you're at the speeds mentioned above.\niTunes is a bit of a dog and capping at USB 2.0 speeds isn't going to help things. The best I can suggest is to enable WiFi sync (if available) so that you can at least have your iDevice sync with your computer while not tethered with a Lightning cable.\n", "Q: Text Message Colors IOS 9.3.2 I sent two text messages via Siri dictation. One was displayed in Green with a note saying the message was sent as text. The second was displayed in Blue with no accompanying message. Both were sent by WiFi with Cellular data turned off. Any thoughts on why the difference?\n\nA: When a message is sent using iMessage, from an Apple device to an Apple device, the message bubble will be blue. \nWhen a message is sent using SMS, in your instance this would be from your Apple device to a non-Apple device, the message bubble will be green. This is to show you that the message was sent but your device can't obtain a read receipt or let you know the message was delivered. \n\nA: To add to fbara, if there is networking issues an iPhone to an iPhone message can still be sent as a text (flaky wifi) for example.\n", "Q: Creating a Installpackage for mac I have a lot of Programms that i always need to install to a new mac. I wanted to simplify this process through an installpackage. I allready tried Iceberg with some success but have a specific error. What i want to do with iceberg is to unpack all the packages and start a script to install it and delete the packages after. I can make a package that unpacks the packages in my destination but the iceberg Programm wont execute the script i add in postinstall. the script itself works fine when i use it through terminal. the Script i am using is\n##!/usr/bin/env bash\nsudo installer -pkg /Library/Virtualbox.pkg -target /\n\niceberg packs the script in the programm but never uses it.\n\nA: There is an error in the postinstall script. The first line should contain only one hash (#):\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nIf the .pkg works with installer and Installer.app, then it is a correct package. All other tools are made by third parties and may not support the latest pkg formats and features.\nLacking Permission?\nUsing sudo in your package script may cause the script to pause forever or instantly fail. How will the sudo command interact with the user to get the super user's credentials?\nRemove sudo and make your script test for permission to install before continuing, otherwise print an error and exit:\nif [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then\n  echo \"You must be a root to run this script\" 2>&1\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nIt is the responsibility of installer to gain the appropriate authorisation rights and run the package's scripts using those rights. Within your package, specify that it needs administrator rights to ensure this happens.\nLogs and Errors\nUse the verbose flag with installer to see each step of the installation process and to see errors:\nsudo installer -verbose -pkg /Library/Virtualbox.pkg -target /\n\nApple Package Tools\nInstaller packages on OS X are typically built with the tools pkgbuild and productbuild. These two Apple tools support pre and post scripts; see the --scripts flag.\nAutoPkg\nMac system administrators often use the open source autopkg tool to create packages:\n\nAutoPkg is an automation framework for OS X software packaging and distribution, oriented towards the tasks one would normally perform manually to prepare third-party software for mass deployment to managed clients.\n\nYou may find AutoPkg is a better approach to simplifying the setting up of new Macs.\n", "Q: My texts are not showing up delivered. Does this mean I could have been blocked? My texts are not showing up delivered.  Does this mean I could have been blocked?  Or did they put it on Do Not Disturb?  Messages were delivered yesterday morning, but everything after that is not showing delivered.\n\nA: No,\nWhen a a user blocks a number on an iPhone and someone else with an iPhone sends a message, it appears delivered.  There is no way for someone to know they were indeed blocked.\nMaybe the phone is off. \nhttp://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/mobile-phone/have-i-been-blocked-in-ios-7-who-blocked-me-ios-8-iphone-ios-9-3476005/\n\nA: There are various reasons why your message hasn't been delivered.

Failure to do any of these steps results in \"iPod service cannot be installed\" late in the installation, at which point the only solution is to cancel, reboot and reinstall.\nLately (12.4) even following all these steps still results in failure to install the iPod Service.  \nDoes anyone have any insight as to why this problem has gone uncorrected essentially since the initial release of iTunes for Windows, and if there is a foolproof way to upgrade iTunes?\n\nA: The most common source of this error is that Sysinternals Process Explorer is running.

Today, I suddenly got the following message on my iPod:\n\nQuestion 1: Does this mean that someone has entered my Apple ID password, or are there other situations where this dialog is triggered? Update: According to an Apple Support representative, there may be other ways to activate this pop-up than entering the password. However, the representative didn't know of any such methods herself.\nQuestion 2: Is there any way I can learn more about the iPad that was used during the login attempt? I have visited appleid.apple.com/account/manage, but can't see any information about \"non authorized logon attempts\" or similar. Does anyone know if Apple keeps a record, even if it's unavailable through their customer-facing services? If yes, is there a way to get this record? Update: The Apple Support representative did not have any more information available through her systems. I asked if more information would have been available if this had been a criminal investigation. She responded that she didn't know, since such requests didn't go through her department.\nIf anyone wonders: As far as I can tell no harm was done. Obviously, I declined the request and immediately changed my password. But only my fiancee & I should have known the old password in the first place, so I found this a bit unnerving. The old password was unique to the Apple account and quite complex (more than 12 characters, no normal words, upper- and lowercase plus numbers). I really can't understand how anyone else can know the password unless they have installed a keylogger on my Mac or similarly advanced.\nUpdate 2: Today, my iPhone suddenly displayed a popup saying \"Use this iPhone to reset your Apple ID password [Allow]/[Don't allow]\". (I regrettably forgot to take a screen shot.) Is this an indication of a sustained attack?\n\nA: Q1: Yes, it looks like someone entered your Apple ID and password.  I don't think there's any other situation where this type of dialog would be triggered.\nQ2: You did the right thing in immediately changing your password.  There's nothing you can do to get more info on who is using your ID, you did everything I would've suggested.  My only remaining advice would be to contact Apple, chat would probably be easiest, and let them know what happened.  It's also good to see that there was no malicious activity on your account, however, you probably want to watch it for purchases every few days.  \nYou mentioned the potential for malware or a key logger, that's quite possible.  Make sure you're checking your machines regularly for malware (I use Malwarebytes), especially if anyone is logging into your Apple account on a Windows machine. \n", "Q: How to cancel photo burst Saw an answer but it was 2 years old and thought there might be changes.\nIs it possible to disable the \"burst\" feature on photo's???\nThanks.\n\nA: No, you can't disable taking photos with burst mode. \nIn Settings you can only disable the upload of burst photos to your iCloud account but you can't turn off burst mode.\nI would recommend going to Apple's Feedback page and providing your feedback that you'd like them to include this as an option.  It's possible Apple will put it on the product roadmap if many people suggest it.\n", "Q: Can iOS display the current audio input device? Is there any way to tell whether an attached external mic is making contact with an iOS device?\nI am trying to attach an external microphone (Sennheiser MKE-400) to an iPhone 5. The mic has a 3.5mm jack which fits into the iPhone's headphone port. I know that the port is capable of audio input. However, I also know that there are different formats for 3.5 mm jacks and ports, and that there are adapters available, one of which may be required to make this connection, though I am not sure.\nI can make a recording with the mic attached, but from listening to it, it is not clear whether the mic is in use or whether the iPhone is using its own, built-in mic.\n\nA: You would need an adapter to make that mic work with an iPhone.

This has been for the last few years and on different computers with the most updated itunes.  Any ideas if this is  normal?\n\n\nA: It's funny, but have you tried to scroll the page?\nThe first block of apps is empty, but apps that support file sharing is in another block at the bottom.\n\n\nA: What you're looking at is the list of apps downloaded onto your computer.  It appears that you don't have anything saved to your computer.  \nYou can easily redownload your past purchases.  \n\nA: Only the apps that you download on your PC or Mac will be displayed there.\nAs you can see in the image, I have many apps installed on my iPhone on the right side (home screen section), but only one app is shown on the left in the apps list (this is the app that I have downloaded on my PC).\nSo you'll have to download all the apps on your Mac/PC for them to show in the list.\n", "Q: Help Understanding Terminal's Command OS X 10.11.5 on a Mid 2011 iMac.

I have a hiking trip coming up and I was wondering whether the iPhone 6S can be used for GPS tracking if there are no cellular networks available? Or does the phone not have the same GPS/GLONASS support that you would get from a hiking GPS device?\n\nA: You would be able to do this - in as much as the co-ordinates can be fixed from the satellite.   You need to be aware that it will take a long time to get the fix if there is no reference point to help it (eg known WIFI or cell towers), as it needs to download the almanac from the satellites.\nYou also need to know that you won't be able to get maps or anything, and mapping may or may not work depending on your application.\nLastly, be aware that, historically at least, phones and similar devices have not had the sensitivity of dedicated devices, so they may not work as reliably. \n\nA: Yes. It can definitely be used without cellular networks. As long as the maps are saved offline, Coordinates can be located by the iPhone on the Map. It's nearly instant on the latest versions. You can save any section of the map offline on Google Maps and use it in locations without Cellular service.\n\n", "Q: Upgrade Macbook Pro Retina A1502 SSD I have an Early 2015 Macbook Pro Retina with a 128Gb SSD and 8Gb of RAM. I know I can't upgrade the RAM but I can upgrade the SSD. Will an Apple Store upgrade my SSD if I take my Macbook to them? Is it possible to know how much will it cost? Or maybe exchange my Mac for another one (same model) with a 512Gb SSD paying the difference?\nI have seen this SSD in Amazon that should work for my Mac but if possible I prefer an official Apple Store to do the replacement. I'm asking because I will be traveling to NY and in my country they won't upgrade the SSD.\n\nA: Yes, but I've heard Apple uses proprietary firmware on their SSDs (I could be wrong), however OWC does make SSDs specifically for the 2015 Retina MacBook Pro, so it appears they've figured out how to make replacements. Here's the link. I'm not affiliated with them, but have bought RAM and a replacement Mac battery from them, both of which work great.\n\nA: Apple doesn't do upgrades or upgrade exchanges. OWC is the only option AFAIK. They have a good reputation and you can review the install video to see if you are comfortable with it. If you don't buy the kit, you should at least order the Torx T5 and Pentalobe T5 screwdrivers needed to do the upgrade. \nMake sure to double-check the model number as explained on the OWC page.\n", "Q: Rails reporting error: Failed to build gem native extension I have installed up-to-date command line tools, and followed steps on other threads with this subject.

To clarify, I have an app that displays ads. Is the announcement that:\n\n\n*\n\n*iAds is shutting down entirely and I need to find another third party ad provider?\n\n*something else about which I'm unclear?\nI'm confused because of statements like this on engadget : http://www.engadget.com/2016/01/15/apple-iad-shutdown-june-30th/\n\nthe iAd program as a whole is not shutting down. What is happening, is that the similarly-named iAd App Network, which allows developers to advertise their own apps through iAds, is going away\n\n\nA: Yes, you need to move to a different provider.  With iAds shutting down, and assuming you don't have any other third-party provider, such as AdMob, serving you ads, your app will not display any ads after the shutdown on June 30.\nThe iAd shutdown was announced almost a year ago, giving developers ample time to find other providers and other ways to serve ads.\n", "Q: Mac Hard Drive Storage Decreases even without downloading anything I have a 128 GB hard drive on my macbook pro retina 13\". My mac storage hard drive keeps decreasing for no reason, even when I do not download anything. This still happens even when I don't use any other application and when I use Chrome in incognito (so nothing is being stored in cache).\nHere is how the pattern looks like when I did not download anything at all, did not use any other application except for chrome and only used Chrome in incognito.\nfirst day:\n\nMore days later:\n\nAs you can see from the images, I did not download anything, even if I did it was probably a Word document or a PDF file. And it still increased 10 GB on the Apps. Just wondering why this happens and how can I prevent it from happening? \nIf this is all a glitch, then how much GB do i actually have left for storage? Finally, why does the total number of GB used from apps, photos, movies, backups, and audio do not add up to the remaining GB left? Like in the last picture it says I have about 52 GB free and the total used up is around 110 GB. Since I have a 128 GB storage, shouldn't it be 10 GB left?\nAlso I have no anti virus running. I don't even have Dropbox and Google Drive. Also, I turned off photo sync from my iPhone. Once again, no apps are running except for Chrome, iMessage, and Skype.\nUpdate: every time I restart my mac the disk space comes back and then it gradually increases again.\n\nA: Could be anything. App updates, new apps, a virus that downloads stuff for you, automatically installed software, or a host of other things. \nIf you did have an application on your Mac like Dropbox or Google Drive, (either of which could automatically be downloading stuff onto your computer) it could be that, but you do not.\nHere's what you should do: download an antivirus app (like BitDefender or Avast). Run a full system scan in whichever you download and make sure no viruses come up, as some malicious software could be doing this. \nThen try downloading Grand Perspective, which shows you everything that's taking up space on your mac. Run it through your entire hard drive. See what comes up, and save your scan; then try scanning again when your available space decreases again.\nPlease report everything you find out in a comment below so I can further assist you!\n\nA: Every time you browse the web you are dowloading contents: HTML (text),\nimages, video…\nEvery time MacOS check for new updates, it is also downloading contents: content description, anticipated software updates…\nHere are a few recommandations for this kind of hidden disk scrounger:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install and run Malwarebytes.\n\n*If your first disk state is 15 days sooner, run the following command:\n/usr/bin/sudo find / -mtime -15 -size +20M -ls | sort -r -n -k 7\n\nand let it run for half an hour to get a sorted list in decreasing order.\n\nA: Simply plugging your iPhone (if you have one) into your mac to charge, apply an update, synchronize them, etc. will lead your computer to do an automatic backup (if you have this feature turned on) which will quickly take up disk storage without you realizing it. To see if you have this automatic feature turned on, try opening iTunes and plugging in your iPhone, then check at the top of iTunes if it says \"backing up\" at some point during the synchronization process. If it does, then this is most likely your problem and monitoring your although useful backups may solve your problem.

As far as I remember, all I did to achieve this was go to System Preferences -> Sound -> Sound Effects tab -> uncheck \"play user interface sound effects\". This worked well - my laptop never made a sound unless I explicitly told it to.\nI have done the same thing on my new El Capitan laptop, and this does seem to have disabled some sound effects, but nevertheless my computer still makes a \"bonk\" sound in some situations. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*In XCode, it happens if I press Shift-CMD-Z when there is nothing left to redo.\n\n*In Finder, it happens if I try to paste a file into a folder for which I don't have write permissions, or if I press CMD-S while a Finder window has the focus.\n\n*A few times it's happened seemingly at random, probably due to me accidentally triggering a trackpad gesture.\n\n\nThis runs the risk of embarassing me in a meeting, giving me an unwelcome surprise if plugged into an amplifier, etc. Is there a way in El Capitan to completely disable all sound effects, except for the ones generated by games, music programmes etc. that I explicitly ask for?\n\nA: Turn down the alert volume \nSystem Preferences---> Sound---> Sound Effects\nThis should mute the \"bonk\" sound you get when you do the things you mentioned\nI am on 10.10.5.

I set the keymap to German and it is displayed correctly in the settings screen. Unfortunately the following two keys are swapped when I type on the keyboard:\n< Key (right of SHIFT)\n^ Key (left of 1)\nAre there any advanced settings to fix this issue?\n\n\n\nA: You can use Ukelele to change the keyboard layout so the meaning of those keys are swapped:\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele\nNote the program is called \"Ukelele\", not \"Ukulele\".\n\nA: I bizarrely had this problem after buying a new mouse (SteelSeries Rival 3), which is plugged into a USB-C monitor (with a keyboard plugged in to the monitor as well), and the monitor has a single USB-C cable going to the MacBook. I could also imagine this being a problem when using USB dongles.\nThe fix that worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*In the terminal, remove the keyboardtype file sudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist, from the accepted answer.\n\n*Remove both keyboard and mouse from the USB ports on the monitor/USB hub.\n\n*Reboot the computer.\n\n*After logging in, plug in the keyboard. Complete the identification. Your keys should work as intended.\n\n*Plug in the mouse to the monitor. Close the new identification box that opened up. Everything should work.\n\n\nA: This is because your keyboard isn't set as ISO standard. This happens sometimes.\nTo change it to the right type:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard, select the Keyboard tab and then 'Change Keyboard Type...'\nThis opens the Keyboard Setup Assistant.\n\n\n*Follow the prompt 'Press the key to the right of the shift key on the left side.'\nIt should now have detected and selected 'ISO' as your standard. If not select it and click 'OK'. 'ISO' is generally used for European keyboards.\nIf this doesn't solve it, you can try manually resetting the settings file:\n\n*\n\n*Delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist\n\n*Restart\n\n*When the keyboard assistent pops up. press the key like it says and select ISO (European)\n\nNote: The problem with fixing this with Ukelele as the selected answer, is that it will swap the keys the other way around on your internal keyboard.\n\nA: You can use Karabiner Elements to swap the keys using Karabiner Eventviewer to find the keycodes of the keys:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the keyboard you experience the issue with is plugged in.\n\n\n*Install Karabiner Elements. Karabiner Eventviewer will be installed with it.\n\n\n*Open Karabiner Eventviewer. Without pressing any other keys, press the two keys you want to swap. The keys ‘key name’ is now shown in the ‘Name’ column. Remember these names or keep the Eventviwer open, to reference again.\nNote: If you're unsure if you have found the correct keys, click the ‘clear the result’ button and then press each of the two keys you want to swap again. Now their ‘key names’ should be at the top of the list like on the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n*Open Karabiner Elements and select the keyboard you have the issue with as your ‘Target device:’ in the dropdown.\n\n\n*Add two new items to the list and find each ‘key name’ from Karabiner Eventviewer in ‘From key’ column, for each of the new items. Now add the opposite key in the ‘To key’ column for each item (see screenshot for reference).\n\n\n\n*You have now swapped the keys!\n\nA: Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard tab > Change Keyboard Type... > Keyboard Setup Assistant, then press the key to the right of the Shift key on the left side.\nIf not available use the procedure of Stefano.\n\nA: Deleting /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist and relying on the keyboard type detection wizard repeatedly did not work for me for my external german keyboard (having also an internal german keyboard).\nBut editing the file /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist manually worked!\nThis is what I did:\nsudo plutil -convert xml1 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist\nEdit file /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist and change type 43 to 41 (or the other way round, depending on what you have) for all the keyboards (or just for the relevant one, but I was not able to figure out which one to change so I changed them all).\nsudo plutil -convert binary1 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist\nReboot. Now the < and the ^ keys should be swapped.\n\nA: Very easy fix I used to solve this: (disclaimer: I don't know what I'm doing.)\nWhen Apple tries to understand your Keyboard by having you click the button next to shift ('<'), I just clicked '^' instead. It proposed ISO (european) then for me, that fixed it.\n", "Q: Windows repositioned to macbook screen after sleep I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015, OS X El Capitan, 10.11.5) with Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB connected to an external monitor:\nSamsung SE790C:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resolution: 3440 x 1440 @ 60 Hz\n\n*Pixel Depth: 32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)\n\n*Mirror: Off\n\n*Online: Yes\n\n*Rotation: Supported\n\n*Connection Type: DisplayPort\n\n*Television: Yes\n\n\nEvery time my MacBook wakes up from sleep, all my windows are back to the MacBook screen.

Witch sees that as the previous window and ⌘tab switched to it, not the actual video window. This takes me to the correct space for the video but it's the wrong window.\nThe solution is to tell Witch to ignore windows with the name \"Window\" by adding ,Window the the \"Ignore windows with titles:\" Behavior settings.\n\n", "Q: locate isn't finding a file that exists The file in question is:\n/Users/me/Library/Containers/com.dell.Toad/Data/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/com.dell.toadext.oracle.core/connections.xml\nWhat is wrong with locate? \n\nA: The locate database in built by the script /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb. The script is run by the user nobody in this line\ntmpdb=`su -fm nobody -c \"$0\"` || rc=1\n\nunless the user nobody has access to a directory then the content of that directory is not recorded in the database. A simple solution would be to use mdfind.\nmdfind -name connections.xml\n\n\nA: Nothing is wrong with locate. By default, it doesn't search for/in hidden files/directories.\nThe directories /.metadata and  /.plugins are both hidden by the fact they are prefixed with a period \".\" which means that locate is not going to index the files within those directories.\nI prefer to use the find command:\nsudo find / -name connections.xml\n\nA: You need to make sure the daemon is running on your machine: \nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist\n\nAlternatively you can also run the following command and build the database:\nsudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb\n\nNote, that indexing of files from the filesystem would take a while, so locate will not show you all the files matched immediately. \n\nOr you may use the regular find for search of what you need.\n", "Q: Recording a maths tutorial video with iPhone I am making a series of maths video tutorials to put up on YouTube.\nI have made a wooden crane that positions the iPhone above my desk looking down so that it captures an A4 sheet of paper.

Some videos come out reasonably crisp, others blurry.\nCrisp-ish:\n\nBlurry:\n\nIs there anything I can do to the iPhone to improve the quality?\nI am working in front of a window, so I am getting ambient daylight (I don't really want to use a lamp because that will give sharp shadows of my hand).  I tried outdoors but then the recording is vulnerable to wind-noise.\nIf I touch the centre of the screen after the record button it sets the focus. I'm not sure whether subsequently moving my hand over the paper forces some refocusing. On my android device I could force manual focus.\n\nA: Use the AE/AF Lock.

That should stop the camera from refocusing when your hand moves. \n", "Q: Macbook Snow Leopard Unzipped file I used Terminal command to unzip an audio file downloaded from a public library.  Command used: unzip -v /<zip filename.zip>; rm -rf _MACOSX.  Terminal displayed 31 files were extracted and stored. I used both Search in Finder and Go to Folder to find the files and only 1 pdf file was found.  The other 30 files, all mp3, went missing.\nI noticed that the more than 1gb of disk space was gone.  So I assume the files are residing somewhere.  Could anyone please help.  Many thanks!\n\nA: The unix command to search for files is find.\nYou can use the command man find to get more information. The usual form is the following.\nfind  <starting folder>  -name  <file name>  -print\n\nFor example, if you are looking for all mp3 files in the current folder and all nested folders, use the following command.\nfind  .  -name  \"*.mp3\"  -print\n\nSometimes you can get a lot of \"permission denied\" or other meaningless error messages. If so, then you can remove all error messages by appending a 2>/dev/null to the end of the command. See the example below.\nfind  .  -name  \"*.mp3\"  -print  2>/dev/null\n\n", "Q: How can I force OS X to update its time more regularly? We have a Mac mini build server running 10.9.5 and sometimes the build fails on the codesign command, which fails because of the timestamp on one of the files. The way we usually \"fix\" this is to simply go on the build server and update the time (either graphically by clicking the clock or in the command line), then the next build will succeed.\nIn the preferences, the option \"Set date and time automatically\" is checked and the time server set is Apple Europe (time.euro.apple.com). The machine is always on but usually nobody connects to it for days/weeks (when something goes wrong usually).\nThis is a bit tedious and time wasting, is there a way to tell Mac OS to keep in sync with the time server more regularly? I could try running a crontab every hour to force time sync but I am wondering if there is something more obvious that I am missing?\n\nA: You can define a minpoll and maxpoll time in /etc/ntp.conf. Usually the poll time is auto-adjusted by ntpd depending on some complex algorithms.\nThe default minpoll and maxpoll time (without specifying minpoll/maxpoll in ntp.conf) should be 6 (64 s) and 10 (1,024 s). By adding minpoll/maxpoll entries and values to ntp.conf you may force different update sequences. The values are seconds as a power of two and the allowed integer values are [3...17]. The minimal poll time is then 8 seconds and the maximal poll time is 36.4 h. You have to reboot the system or force quit ntpd with kill ... in the Terminal or in the Activity Monitor after changing the config file to apply the modifications. The ntp daemon will be relaunched automatically after killing it.\nHere is an already modified example ntp.conf with a poll time between 1024 and 4096 seconds:\n...\nserver 160.45.10.8 minpoll 10 maxpoll 12\nserver 192.53.103.104 minpoll 10 maxpoll 12\nserver de.pool.ntp.org minpoll 10 maxpoll 12\n\nScreenshot of the ntp traffic after changing the default config file without minpoll/maxpoll to the above example 16 minutes ago and reverting it after another 12 minutes to the original state:\n\nThe default poll time of 6 is clearly visible in the above screenshot with an update sequence of ca. 1 minute in the first 14 minutes and the last 4 minutes. \nUsing lower poll times [3..5] (= 8 seconds to 32 seconds) doesn't necessarily mean that the time is more accurate! Due to the extended calculations made by ntpd the time adjustments may oscillate and more inaccurate results may occur than with higher poll times (≥6).\n\nAfter a system update/upgrade you may have to readjust/restore the modified config file!\n", "Q: Xcode 7 Simulator - \"SpringBoard cannot be opened because of a problm.\" I was successfully using the Xcode Simulator yesterday evening.

It was marked as WontFix because it's part of the MacOS convention. It has been officially answered here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=543891\n\nA: Not really answer as much as workaround: Lean on Command-C.\nI like the \"rapid dictionary\" feature.

However, the new one does not appear to control the Apple TV. Do I need to take any steps to get the new remote to control my existing Apple TV 4?\n\nA: Make sure the old Apple TV Remote is out of Bluetooth range, then while in front of the Apple TV set top box press a button on the new remote. This should pair the remote to the Apple TV.\nIf not, try pressing Volume Up and Menu simultaneously on both remotes for 2-3 seconds, new and old, then do the aforementioned steps again with the new remote.\n", "Q: Control Macs volume with headphones I have the Bose Quitcomfort 25 headphones for Android and on it there are 3 buttons (volume up, down and play pause toggle).\nI was able to get the Play Pause toggle up and running by installing BeardedSpice\nNow I'm wondering is there any way to get the headphones volume up / down buttons working on my Mac?\n\nA: The problem here lies in the fact that there are \"Apple\" compatible headsets and \"Android\" compatible ones.  The reason is because of the TRRS (tip, ring, ring, sleeve) connector at the end of your headset.  See the photos below:\n\nIf you notice, the Mic and Ground connectors are swapped.  While your microphone works because microphones don't care about polarity, the switches (volume up/down) won't work because it will be connecting to the \"mic\" conductor and not the \"ground.\"\nThe way the volume up/down buttons work is that one of the signals is shorted to ground  So, for instance using the \"Android\" (OMTP) pinout, if you press \"Vol Up\" then pin A and pin D is shorted.  But, on an \"Apple\" product, pin D is the Mic and nothing happens.  This is obviously really simplified.   In actuality, there is most likely a change in resistance different that what is already there from the left/right speaker or mic.\n\nNotice the switches.  Let's use SW3 (FF/Next) as an example.  When SW3 is open, the microphone is connected and completes the circuit (green trace).  When SW3 is closed (as in pressed), it shorts the circuit before getting to the microphone bypassing it, it goes through a 600ohm resistance and completes the circuit at ground (yellow trace).  The phone then sees the 600ohm resistance as a signal to \"skip\" passes that to iOS and iOS skips to the next song.\nThe same happens vol up/down, I just don't have the schematic for those.  If you use an adapter that has the ground in a different place, the circuit will never get completed thus the signal never gets to the phone.\nThere is no software that's going to fix this because to get a signal to the hardware so that OS X can \"sense\" it, something must be shorted to ground.  Shorting to mic does nothing so the system can't see it.\nThis is why this is not an Apple issue, but an Android one.\n\nA: I've got a set of Android compatible wired headphones. For some time I've been looking for a method in software/firmware to make the 3.5mm port on my MacBook read the ground and mic inputs appropriately (as per Allan's answer), but to no avail. \nHowever, I've found that controls such as volume up and down work when using a 3.5mm to USB-C adapter. I have a post 2015 MacBook so they're all USB-C ports. \n", "Q: How to install Mac OS X in Parallels VM without extra `OS X image file.hdd` file on host Mac? How to install recent versions of Mac OS X such as Sierra or El Capitan in Parallels without creating an extra file on the host Mac?\nInstalling Mac OS X as a guest OS in Parallels is easy. Just choose File > New, and point to a copy of the Mac OS X installer such as Install macOS Sierra.app. \nThe problem is that in Parallels versions 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 we are prompted to create an extra file besides the main file that stores the virtual Mac’s boot drive. The extra file has a suggest name such as OS X image file.hdd. I assume that file is for the “recovery partition” (that I have never really understood). \nIs there some way to install Mac OS X as a guest OS without that second .hdd file? I want to be able to backup and move around my main Parallels file (the boot drive) without having to pull that second file around. Deleting that second file breaks the main VM file, making the VM unusable.\n\n\nDespite claiming the file will be named OS X image file.dmg, it is actually saved as OS X image file.hdd (.hdd, not .dmg). This is the linked file that I want to unlink and dispose of.\n\nThis OS X image file.hdd file is in addition to the the file containing the actual virtual macOS, the .pvm file such as macOS.pvm by default or macOS Sierra.pvm in this screenshot. The .pvm file is the important one, the one to keep.\n\n\nA: For Parallels 11.2.2 and macOS 10.12 Sierra as guest OS, I had the same problem. Once the VM is installed make sure you configure the VM, go to the Hardware tab, select the Hard Disk item in the lefthand column that represents the unnecessary \"OS X image file.hdd\" file and click the minus sign button to remove it. You can delete the actual \"OS X image file.hdd\" file and your VM won't complain about it being missing when booting.\n\n\nA: In contrary to older version Parallels 11 creates a bootable installer hdd with the help of Install OS X El Capitan.app. Older versions created an iso/dmg/img file with the same purpose.\nAfter booting to the pre-installation boot environment in the OS X image file.hdd, OS X will be installed to the main drive inside the VM pvm package. After installing OS X you may unload/remove and safely delete the hdd file.\nPersonally I prefer to create an iso file and use that one to install OS X in one or several Parallels VMs. Use the script here: Install El Capitan with VirtualBox on OS X to accomplish this - the resulting iso also works with Parallels.\n", "Q: How to exercise a new hard drive by erasing multiple times with Disk Utility app?

If it did you could try rotating it back and the file size would drop, but that's not the case.\nI just tried saving a TIF and I can see that Preview seems to be adding an Alpha channel to the image.

This question is inspired by my earlier question:\nAsk Different: Why does rotating a TIFF in Preview increase the file size?\n\nOne thing I don't like about the Preview application is that even something as simple as rotating an image 90 degrees requires Preview to re-encode the file, adding an alpha channel in the process. This results in a file that is 10% to 20% larger than the original, with no added benefit. This size difference may not matter much on a 5 MB file, but on a 500 MB file, it is a nuisance.\nAre there any applications that can rotate a TIFF image 90 degrees without re-encoding it and altering the image in any other way?

It's not using SSD yet. \nSuddenly, one day, it slowed down. Like when you're opening too much applications, your cursor would show loading icon anytime you're clicking on something (but it can still move around freely and smoothly). To the point the song iTunes was playing is lagging. The I restarted it. After some hours, it happened again, and I restarted it again. This time, it stuck on OS loading screen (where there's a gray apple with loading bar below). Restart 2-3 times it using ON/OFF button, failed, stuck on the same screen. \nThen I tried to go into safe mode, and succeed going into desktop. After that, I restarted it again and successfully got to the desktop normally. But now, it would slowed down (cursor turns to loading icon every time you click on something) very often, around every 5 mins. Even more, some apps I frequently used (that I used when symptoms appear) cannot be opened, such as Chrome and Eclipse. I haven't even run IDE and emulator and it's like that already.\nAll this time, usually after I was done with my work for the day, I would just close the lid and didn't shut it down. Some people has said that \"It's not SSD, so you should not do that often\", while someone that I know, a user of MacBook too, said \"Ah, I got no problem doing that with my Mac, which wasn't using SSD\". Is that really the problem? \nI've upgrade the OS to 10.11.5, but same thing happened. Also, I didn't found Apple Diagnostics or Apple Hardware Test. I've run Disk Utility's First Aid too, and it only said \"Operation successful\", \"volume seems to be OK\".\nThe lag happened so suddenly, where yesterday it really did just fine and suddenly today it broke down. Does anyone have any idea about what was really happened and what should I do? \n\nA: If you noticed a sudden slowdown then that points to an event of some sort that is likely pointed to an issue with the HDD (IMHO). Mac OS is very sensitive to issues with the speed of the disk, which is why it benefits so much from upgrading to an SSD. My recommendations?\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your vital data now.\n\n*Boot the system into recovery mode, run disk utility to repair the internal drive.\n\n\nI'm betting that there has been some kind of disk error. The question remains whether or not it is a recoverable disk error. Unfortunately Disk Utility is not a comprehensive disk repair tool. There are others out there (my go to is DiskWarrior, but there are others) that can fix things that Disk Utility can't. If disk utility cant repair it you can try another utility or just replace the drive.\n", "Q: Cannot format SSD to OS X Extended (Journaled) in order to restore yesterday my computer stayed awake during all night, when I woke up it stopped working.

This server has several hard disks that are shared using Samba.\nI have an iMac with OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 and I use one of the shared disks to store some information. I'm accessing this disk a lot of times to write and read information.\nThe performance of the Finder is really slow compared with my Ubuntu laptop and my girlfriend window's laptop...\nThe configuration for the disk on Samba is this:\n[MYDATA]\n    comment = my coment...\n    path = /path/to/disk\n    browsable = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n    read only = no\n    create mask = 0755\n\nI would like to know if the configuration of the disk should be different in any way, or maybe if I need to add some configuration in my Mac. \nI also noticed that sometimes when I try to rename a folder inside this Samba share my Mac usually ask for my root password to modify the folder's name.\n\nA: You should avoid using SMB on OS X (IMHO) as it has been buggy since the days of Snow Leopard (10.6), for me at least.\nA quick Google search limited to this year alone brings up a myriad of issues regarding OS X and slow SMB implementations. \nThere are a few  things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the SMB2 protocol by mounting your share  cifs://<whatever your share name is>\n\n*Enable AFP (Netatalk) on your Ubuntu server and connect to the mount points using afp://<whatever your share name is> \n\n*Setup NFS on Ubuntu  and mount them on OS X\nPersonally, if I have found CIFS good, AFP better, and NFS (even though it's much older) to be the best in terms of performance.  \n\nA: I had the following settings in smb.conf on an Ubuntu Samba server.\nsocket options = SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192\n\nThis seems to have been causing a slow down of large file transfers to/from macOS. The slow down was around a factor of five, as compared with scp between the same machines. Although increasing these numbers helped, the best idea is probably to comment out that configuration line entirely, letting the kernel adjust the buffer size dynamically. This made smb file transfers take around the same amount of time as scp file transfers, i.e. about five times faster.\nThe other change I made was to add this line to the share definition section in smb.conf.\nvfs objects = fruit streams_xattr\n\nThis enables the Samba \"fruit\" module for handling connections from macOS. It affects a number of behaviors and makes available various additional options (see samba docs here), but specifically helps with the speed of scanning large directories.\n\nA: \nEnable AFP (Netatalk) on your Ubuntu server and connect to the mount points using afp://\n\nAnd get a lot of  ._*,.DS_Store,.TemporaryItems,.apdisk,.Appledouble ones in each folder)))\n", "Q: Easy PDF word count What is the 'easiest' way to get word (and/or page) count of PDFs? \nBy 'easy' I mean 'an app where you can read/annotate the PDF and get word count as well, without having to resort to clunky copying/pasting'. I know one can copy/paste things from any PDF reader into Word/Pages and get this info. I'd rather hear about a more practical/robust solution. \nIdeally I'd want to know if this is available (in this order of preference):\n\n\n*\n\n*In Preview (my default PDF reader)\n\n*In another PDF reading app (which I'd be happy to make default)\n\n\nIf the above doesn't exist, I'd also be content with programmes that do word/page count exclusively (although you won't be able to read/annotate the PDF). Ideally in this order of preference:\n\n\n*An app with a GUI\n\n*A command line programme\n\n\nThanks for any ideas!\n\nA: WordService from DEVONtechnologies will do statistics (count words, characters, lines) on seleced text. Page count is shown in the titlebar of Preview.\nIt does more than statistics, like uppercase, lowercase, converting tabs to spaces or vice-versa, date and time functions, etc.\nAnd as it is a Service-provider it's available in all Cocoa apps via the Services menu or contextual menus under the Services heading.  \nDEVON's products page\nLook under the Freeware section. Available from their website and the Mac  App Store.\n\nA: I developed a very small app \"PDF Word Counter\", which is designed to be the easiest possible way to count words in a given PDF.  One simply drags and drops the pdf in to get the word count back. (The app is free in the sense of both speech and beer)\n\nA: Foxit PDF Reader (a free and robust overall PDF reader/annotator) can show the word count, but as far as I can tell, it will only do so in the Windows version. It may also be in the Mac version, but the interface is so completely different that I cannot find it if it is there.

The \"Note on iPhone\" didn't populate to anywhere else.\nI am 100% convinced that I am using the correct Apple ID.\nI decided to try using my husband's Apple ID, too. The exact same thing happened. The iPhone got old versions of his notes - eg, a particular note is dated Sept '15 on in phone, but May '16 on icloud.com and on his phone.\nI checked that the date and time are set correctly.\nAny other ideas?\n\nA: Assuming your freshly-laundered phone was using iOS 9 & your iPhone 4 is still on the last available iOS for it, 7.1.2, then the reason it cannot sync to new Notes is because the new Notes feature was only introduced with iOS 9\nAnything older will still be syncing to the older version, presumably last updated the day before you hit the button to upgrade to the new version when you loaded iOS 9 for the first time.\n", "Q: OS X: Suddenly only one window/application visible at the same time I have a rather weird problem with my desktop of my MacBook Pro.

I want a way where the installation of an application in mac happens in the server and my mac is able to read the respective data from it. Till now I have not been able to do such a thing. Any idea?\n\nA: It is likely that the file system in use on your Ubuntu server does not support all of the things that HFS+ does meaning that somethings just can't live on a different file system, applications and other types of package files spring to mind.\nHowever a disk image file is designed to be a self contained archive that can transit all sorts of file systems. You could put a (read/write) .DMG file on your Linux server and then mount it across the network to your Mac and run your applications from there. Just remember that some (many?) apps are not designed to run in such a container and that many will want to write their preference files and the like to your local home directory.\n", "Q: Prevent display from sleeping I'm trying to use an auxiliary LCD as a light-pad/bed/table by loading up a 1080p white .PNG in preview and setting fullscreen ON.\nThe problem is after several (20?) minutes of inactivity I get the Apple screensaver kicking in, and then have to enter my password.\nHow to prevent this?\nNothing in System Prefs -> Energy Saver works.\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/03/21/temporarily-prevent-a-mac-from-sleeping/ suggests pmset noidle but that's also fails.\n\nA: In addition to the \"sleep corner\" mentioned in Tetsujin's answer, there is also a small app out there called Caffeine which you can use to prevent the machine (and thus display as well) from sleeping. Note that it will even stop a laptop from sleeping when the lid is shut, so be sure to disable it. There are also alternatives like Amphetamine and Owly that seem to do the same thing, but I've only use Caffeine.

It really takes time and I have lots of files to compress. I am looking for a solution by context menu if possible.\nIs there any solution that you can recommend for clean compressing?\n\nA: You can use zip command in Terminal to zip the files without the .DS_Store, __MACOSX and other .* files.\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (search for terminal in spotlight)\n\n*Navigate to the folder you want to zip using the cd command\n\n*Paste this:\nzip -r dir.zip . -x '**/.*' -x '**/__MACOSX'\n\nIf you want to only filter .DS_Store files and keep other hidden files, use:\nzip -r dir.zip . -x '**/.DS_Store'\n\nExample\nLet's say you have a folder on your desktop called Folder with stuff to zip. \nOpen terminal and write following commands: \n\n*\n\n*\ncd Desktop/Folder\n\n\n\n*\nzip -r dir.zip . -x '.*' -x '__MACOSX'\n\nNow you have a file called dir.zip without __MACOSX and .* files in the folder Folder on your desktop.\n\nA: Based on itunes answer. I needed to also remove DS_Store in nested directories as follows.\nzip -r my.zip . -x \"**/.DS_Store\"\n\nA: Only one I've ever really used is BetterZip [$20]\nIt is a GUI app, but has Applescript & Services support, with which you can run presets with your default settings - including omitting Mac-specific files like .DS_Store & __MACOSX. Possibly worth a look.\nFrom the BetterZip Help...\n\nBetterZip supports two services: one for extracting and one for\n  creating archives. You can configure what the BetterZip services will\n  do with presets.\nTo use a service, select one or more files or folders in the Finder\n  and choose Compress with BetterZip or Extract with BetterZip from the\n  Finder > Services menu or the Services submenu in the contextual menu.\nYou can even set keyboard shortcuts for the BetterZip services, e.g.,\n  ^⌥⌘C for compressing and ^⌥⌘E for extracting. To set shortcuts for\n  services, go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts and\n  choose Services in the left table. In the right table, scroll to Files\n  and Folders, choose Compress with BetterZip and press ↩. An editable\n  textfield will appear. Press the desired shortcut.\n\nOne of my Save presets...\n\n\nA: Just some extra information ...\nMy understanding is that __MACOSX is a subdirectory artificially created by the Mac GUI tools to hold meta data such as extended attributes that can't be normally saved in a zip file.\nIf you use the Mac GUI tools to unpack the zip file, then the tools will know what to do with __MACOSX and the directory won't actually get unpacked.\nThe problems happen when you send your .zip file to Windows or Linux users, or just use the general-purpose unzip program to unpack them. Those tools won't know that __MACOSX is special, and will just unpack it.\nThe simplest option is to use zip to pack up your zip file instead of the Mac built-in tool. zip won't create __MACOSX and your problem is solved. (You will lose the meta data in the process, but you probably didn't want it anyway.)\nzip -r dir.zip dir\n\nIf it's too late, and you already have a zip file with __MACOSX, you can still remove it with:\nzip -d foo.zip __MACOSX .DS_Store\n\nFinally, the accepted answer is the best because if for some reason __MACOSX actually does exist in your directory (e.g. because you previously used unzip to create it), the -x option will keep it from being packed up.\n\nA: Try Keka. It comes with an option to exclude .DS_Store\n\n", "Q: What are the dimensions of the head of a thunderbolt cable?

Its supply is already doubled.\nIt is worth noting that for a long time I didn't have problems \nThanks in advance!\nDoes some one know how to solve this?\n\nA: It looks like the Health app is still (even after you turned things off) aggregating step data.  Instead of going to Privacy, go to the Health app.  Next go to the dashboard and tap on the Steps pane. Tap Share Data and then the Edit button on the top right.  Make sure only 1 app is supplying the step data, whichever app you want to use. \nWhile still in Edit mode, go to the Data Sources section.  Drag that single source to the top so it's the first row.  \nHopefully, this will prevent any other source from supplying step data.\n", "Q: How to get iMessages from phone and old Apple ID email? My 12 year old just got an iPhone. She has an old iPad that she has been using to text. She wants to be able to get texts on both the new iPhone as well as the iPad. Problem is, the iMessages she gets on the iPad are an aol account associated with an old apple ID. A couple years ago, we had to create a new Apple ID for each of our kids to be able to use family sharing. So she has 2 different Apple IDs. Is there a way for her to see texts for both on both devices?\n\nA: Settings > Messages > Send & Receive...\nYou can add multiple email addresses there.\nAlso Settings > Messages > Text Message forwarding will allow you to send SMS to another device [I've not tested to an iPad but that's where I sent txts to my Mac]\n", "Q: Ghost project icon in Xcode laucher Every time Xcode's launcher opens, I see the icon of a project that has been deleted for ages.

I've tried to change around settings so that I don't have to use new shortcuts.\nThe issue I am facing is that I use Control+L to highlight the URL all the time in Chrome. In Mac, the default shortcut is ⌘+L.\nI've changed up some Chrome shortcuts using the App Shortcuts option in  Keyboard Preferences. This triggers menu items when you use your custom keyboard shortcuts. However, there is no menu item for highlight URL, and hence I am not able to use this option.\nI've also tried the extension Shortkeys, but it has no function to highlight URL.\nI'd like to use the Control+L shortcut on my Mac as well. How do I do this? \n\nA: The menu was actually called Open Location.\nI then used App Shortcuts in Keyboard Preferences to set it to Control+L.\n", "Q: Is there any way to permanently crop a PDF without decreasing its quality? I scanned a document and would like to crop out around half of the image.\nI can crop using Preview or using Adobe Acrobat Pro. But neither program permanently crops the file. The file size never decreases.\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried using \"Remove Hidden Information\" on Adobe Acrobat Pro which was able to permanently crop the file. After the process completed, I clicked Save which opened a new Save As prompt. So, I re-saved the document, but the file size grew tenfold. No idea why.\n\n*I tried exporting to Optimized PDF on Adobe Acrobat Pro and the PDF was still not permanently cropped.\n\n*I tried exporting to Reduced Size PDF on Adobe Acrobat Pro and the PDF was permanently cropped, but the image quality was decreased.\nAre there seriously no options to remove the cropped area without exporting the file as TIFF and importing the TIFF files to create a new PDF file or ->Print->Save As PDF? I don't want to do these because the image quality will decrease.\nAnd why is such a basic task so difficult?\n\nA: Cropping (in Acrobat) is non-destructive, as you noted.\nIf you really want to permanently cut away parts of your scan, it would be better to open the file in an image processing software, do the cutting away (aka cropping) there and resave as PDF (or TIFF, and then bring back to Acrobat for a PDF).\nIf you do not change the image resolution, the image quality will remain.\n", "Q: Can naming/running a program “sudo” somehow cause problems? I hope this is an appropriate place to post this--I have no idea what happened.\nI named a c++ file (a simple sudoku solver) \"sudo.cpp\" and then compiled it with \"g++ sudo.cpp -o sudo\" and ran \"./sudo\" from my directory /Code using Terminal. For some reason, moments after, Terminal froze, outputted strange text (I didn't have time to read it), and the computer crashed. Now I cannot boot (I get the blinking folder) and the hard drive does not even show up in Disk Utility when I start in Recovery Mode. Is there any way that the sudo command and the name of a file can conflict and somehow cause problems? I know it is a long-shot, but I can't imagine why a simple sudoku solver would otherwise (apparently) erase my hard-drive, and it seems very unlikely to be a coincidence.\n(I was working on a MacBook Pro Mid-2014, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB Memory.)\n\nA: The command sudo already exists, and runs what comes next as a superuser (usually after requesting a password). Then you can, for instance, delete all sorts if system files. \nNo idea what actually happened, but some conflict seems possible. It seems like a really bad idea to name your game after such a powerful command! \n", "Q: iPhone 5 hanged and now cannot be entered Was using Chrome and WhatsApp on my iPhone 5 when the two apps hanged. Since I was unable to activate multitasking, such as to restart those apps, I tried to lock the phone. However, upon locking my phone, I was unable to unlock the phone. The phone is still switched on, since I can still activate Siri, but the lock screen is pitch black, so I am unable to access my passcode lock screen to unlock the phone. Essentially, my phone is switched on, but is effectively a brick. I am unable to do a hard reset on my phone, since my switch does not work (as a result of being used too often, the wire in the switch has come out of place and renders the switch obsolete).\nI connected my phone to my MacBook Air so as to backup and then restore the phone, but the backup has failed a few times, so I cannot restore the phone yet.

Position the marker at the start of your edit, and do commandY (Split Clip), Then move the red line to the end of the region you want to remove and split it again there. You can now select the mid portion of the video (it should get a yellow border) and delete it. \nSee below for the view when you have done both splits, but not yet deleted...\n\n", "Q: Applescript with get every file loop fails I want to run a script on all files with two specific extensions on a disk with a hierarchy of multiple nested folders.  My script works fine when I choose a folder further down the line with fewer subfolders but I'd like to run it on an entire archive with over a thousand folders.  The AppleScript takes forever to get all the files and then exits without returning anything and without executing the operations after getting the files.  No timeout message, no error message.  And the Finder becomes unresponsive (and remains stuck after the script exits). \nset myFolder to choose folder with prompt \"Choose a folder:\"\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        try\n            set eafFiles to (every file in entire contents of myFolder whose name ends with \".eaf\") as alias list\n        on error\n            try\n                set eafFiles to ((every file in entire contents of myFolder whose name ends with \".eaf\") as alias) as list\n            on error\n                set eafFiles to {}\n            end try\n        end try\n        try\n            set pfsxFiles to (every file in entire contents of myFolder whose name ends with \".pfsx\") as alias list\n        on error\n            try\n                set pfsxFiles to ((every file in entire contents of myFolder whose name ends with \".pfsx\") as alias) as list\n            on error\n                set pfsxFiles to {}\n            end try\n        end try\n        set myFiles to eafFiles & pfsxFiles\n    end tell\n\n    repeat with CurrentFile in myFiles\n        set CurrentFile to CurrentFile as string\n\n        do shell script \"perl /path/to/perl/script.pl \" & quoted form of CurrentFile\n    end repeat\n\n\nA: Perl's File::Find is ideal for iterating over all the files in a folder. This approach deals with one file at a time, is fast, and memory efficient.\nUse AppleScript to present the folder choice and then pass the selected folder path to your perl script:\nset myFolder to choose folder with prompt \"Choose a folder:\"\ndo shell script \"perl /path/to/perl/script.pl \" & quoted form of POSIX path of myFolder\n\nThe perl script can then deal with traversing the files. Below is sample perl script for iterating over files and filtering to only eaf and pfsx suffixes:\n#!/usr/bin/env perl\n\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\n\nuse File::Find;\n\n# Get the first argument passed to the script\nmy $argument_path = shift;\ndie(\"ERROR: an argument must be provided\\n\") unless $argument_path;\ndie(\"ERROR: the argument must be a folder: $argument_path\\n\") unless -d $argument_path;\n\n# Iterate over every file and folder within the $argument_path\nfind sub {\n\n    my $filename = $_; # relative to current working directory\n\n    # Skip all but .eaf and .pfsx file types\n    return unless $filename =~ /\\.eaf$/;\n    return unless $filename =~ /\\.pfsx$/;\n\n    print $filename.\"\\n\";\n\n    # ... deal with the file or folder here\n\n}, $argument_path;\n\n\nA: Try using System Events instead of Finder. I was trying to get every file of a particular extension type in a folder, and kept getting script errors. \ntell application \"System Events\"\ncontinue with the rest of your code. \nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Signing up for an Apple Developer Account under 18 I am looking to launch an app within the next few days on the store. I have done this before in the past under a parents name but as I am 17 and will be 18 in a few months wandered whether it would be worth signing up to the program with my own account now.\nI have read other posts on the min. age being 18 but is there anything that could feasibly happen as a result of this? Or am I just better off doing it under my parent for another year?\n\nA: Launch the app through your parent's name, you are still under 18 and this will ensure your legal obligations are met.\nWhen you turn 18, you can create a new Apple Developer account in your name and transfer your apps from your parent's account to your new account.\nI believe the transfer will include your statistics and other meta-data associated with each app.\nThis approach is common practice for consultants who develop and manage apps for clients, before handing them over when their role ends.\nWith regard to choosing the bank account, so long as your parents agree this should be fine.\n", "Q: Missing disk space after failed Bootcamp install Earlier today, while running Bootcamp attempting to install Windows 7 on my late-2012 iMac, I suddenly lost 160g of disk space after Bootcamp failed to create the partition for Windows.

I have an animated movie in three different languages. The picture is exactly the same for each langauge, only the audio is different.\nI want to merge all these files into one, so that I have a single video file where I can switch easily between the audio tracks in VLC.\nUsing OS X Yosemite, how can I create such a video file with multiple audio tracks?\nAlthough I doubt it's possible, I'd also be open to doing this on iOS.\n\nA: Since you are looking at playing it in VLC, I would suggest using MKVToolNix. It's a free, open-source set of tools to allow you to manipulate MKVs.\nLet's go through it step-by-step (there is a shorter way but this will get you to learn a bit more about MKVTN):\n\n\n*\n\n*You're going to want to demux two of the videos with the foreign audio so drag it in to MKVTN's \"Source Files\" area. You'll see the file get listed and in the \"Tracks, chapters, tags and attachments\" view you will see the streams in that file. In my example below (forgive the Windows interface, but it's the same) you will see there is an AAC audio stream and an Mpeg-4 Hi10p video stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Deselect all tracks so that only the audio track you want to grab is selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n*You'll notice that the filename under \"Output file\" has changed its extension to .mka. This is because MKVTN knows we are exporting only audio. Choose where you want to save the output file, give it a name, and click \"Start muxing\".\n\n\n\n\n\n*Repeat this process until you have the video file with one audio and separate .mka files for each of the foreign audio tracks.\n\n*Repeat step one, dragging in the original video file containing the first language.\n\n*Drag in the separate .mka tracks to the same view. You will be presented with a popup like below.\n\n\n\n*Since we want to use these files as input files too, we can leave the settings as they are and click \"OK\".\n\n*In the \"Tracks\" view, you should now see multiple audio tracks for each of the different languages. (At this point I should note that you could have just dragged the video files all in and then just deselected the video tracks but I figured I'd get you to dummy run the program first ;) )\nIf you're happy with not having any other metadata set for the file then you can go ahead and repeat step 3 (setting the file name etc.) to export an .mkv containing all your audio with the video.\nIf you'd like to though, you can select each track in the \"Tracks\" view and specify the language of each and also which one should play by default by editing the attributes in the \"Properties\" view. This can help you differentiate later on in VLC when you want to switch the languages. \nYou may also find that if the audio files are different lengths and just stretched in their original containers that the audio may not sync up perfectly. You can adjust that via the \"Properties\" tab too if you know the offsets. If the source video was the same though, you may find it syncs up fine.\nAFAIK, there's no similar tool for iOS, but it's not something I've thought of doing on iOS myself.\nLet me know in the comments if there's something you want me to expand on. :)\n", "Q: Flashlight turns itself off while a recording video on iPhone 5s I'm using FiLMiC to record a 30 minute video.\nIn FiLMiC, I turn the flashlight on and hit the record button.\n(the iPhone has is the power cord connected).\nAfter about 20 minutes the flashlight just turned itself off!\nIs this some overheating issue?

(I use the desktop client. OS X 10.11.5)\nSpecifically, I clicked on the Dropbox icon, went to Preferences -> Account, and changed Dropbox location. It took a while to copy the files. Now, for some weird reason, most of my files are stuck in 'syncing'. I don't understand why it has to sync anything at all, since the files were copied within the hard drive, and no file was modified in the cloud.\nIt's been stuck at 6,990 files remaining for the last two hours. When I move the mouse over the dropbox logo, it says Indexing 6,990 files and Can't sync \"x (Access Denied). What does this even mean? There are shared folders in my dropbox that I need to use right now. What do I do?\n\nA: It turns out the issue is with the fact that I moved my dropbox folder to an external drive. In that case, OSX creates a bunch of files named ._filename, which dropbox cannot sync. To clean these files, someone wrote this small script that works in the background. I installed and ran it, and my problems were solved.\n", "Q: Disabling password in recovery mode, is default password restored when re-enabling? I need to fix an issue with my friends mac, but I do not know his pass, and don't want to have to make up a new one, can I disable it in recovery mode or single user mode, then re-enable it after I've sorted the issue and logged into his account, and have his default pass' restored? \n\nA: You can reset the password via Recovery Mode or Single User Mode, but you would need to know the original password in order to change it back. \nAnother important issues comes to mind if they're using FileVault. You will not be able to access their information by changing their password (and you'll likely break other things trying).\nOther options would include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Making a secondary account (if the issue isn't specific to that user account)\n\n*Repairing the issue via Target Disk Mode (if the issue is fixable that way, and they aren't using FileVault)\n\n*Obtaining the password, or having them change it to a temporary password they can share with you\n\n\nNote: If they aren't running FileVault, and you end up changing their password, you'll be prompted to wipe out their Keychain on every boot (which means they lose everything, or you continuously see Keychain errors).\nThe third option, i.e. obtaining a correct password, is best, and standard practice for repair shops.\n\nA: If you change a users password via the recovery partition it stays on the new password until you change it again. To change it to the old value you need to know the old password.\nThe only thing not affected is the keychain password, you need to enter the old password to get access to the keychain.\n", "Q: Can't delete my \"applications\" So, I somehow have 40GB worth of applications on my Macbook, but I can't, for the life of me, see what these applications are!\nI looked in the Applications folder -- there are no apps except the default ones that come installed on the computer.

I have no idea how to uninstall any of these apps, but 40GB is ridiculous.\n\nA: The 40gb of space being used isn't actually applications there just files on your mac not applications. This has happened to me before, apparently its an indexing problem.\nYou Can reindex spotlight by going into terminal and typing : sudo mdutil -E /\nI also would recommend downloading OmniDiskSweeper like mcmahoniel said.\nHope this helps good luck!\n\nA: OmniDiskSweeper is a great tool to help you narrow down where space is being taken up. It's free, and gives you a simply UI (similar to Finder) to drill down and figure that out. See this article for examples.\nAlternatively, if you'd like to do it by hand, you can try narrowing down folders one at a time.\nFor me, I'll right-click (control-click) a set of folders, pick Get Info, and see the space used by each of those folders. I'll dive in deeper into the ones that stand out and do the same for their subfolders.\nRepeat until you can see exactly where that space is being taken up.\n", "Q: Open Bitlocker USB stick on OS X I have a USB stick encrypted by Windows 7 built-in tool (bitlocker).

Somewhere you should get something like \"disk3s1\".

That's why I put it in /tmp which is cleaned at every reboot.\n\n*Decrypt the USB stick with dislocker. If disk is \"disk3s1\" and the password is \"MyPassword\", the command will look like:\nsudo dislocker-file -V /dev/disk3s1 -v -uMyPassword -r -- /tmp/mydrive\n\n\n*Add the disk image to Disk Utility and mount it\nsudo hdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage /tmp/mydrive/dislocker-file\n\nNote: Don't try to list \"/tmp/mydrive/dislocker-file\" by yourself.

However, both the dislocker unlock command and the gist mount the volume as read-only. When full access (read/write) is required, remove the \"-r\" option from the dislocker command and/or edit the gist mount-bitlocker by removing \"-r\".\n\nA: Alternative solution\nUse Windows in virtual machine.

As my warranty has expired now, I want to upgrade the 128GB SSD to a larger one (preferably as large as possible), but I want to keep the traditional HDD for storage reasons, and upgrade it later.\nHere are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What type is the slot the iMac has for it's SSD? In the iFixit repair manual it kind of looks like an M.2 SSD, but I'm not sure.\n\n*What is the maximum size (length) for SSDs to fit into that slot? I know that there are different sizes of M.2 SSDs (if it's M.2 at all).\n\n\nI've heard of adapters that translate that whatever slot the iMac has to a regular SATA connector, so one can use regular SSDs in an iMac. \nThis is interesting because regular SATA SSDs are the cheapest, after all, and offer larger storage options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone know if these are usable (maybe recommend one)?\n\n*Would it be possible to place an 2,5\" regular SSD (e.g. Samsung 850 Evo) somewhere in the case of the iMac and hook it up to that adapter?\n\n\nI'd be glad if there's anonye out there to answer some of these questions. Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: Allan said in his answer that an mSATA SSD is used in the iMac late 2012. Anyone who can confirm this?\n\nA: I have an iMac 27 Late 2012 and I upgraded my SSD.\nThe fusion drive is a misnomer - it's actually two drives.  There is an PCIe SSD, probably about 128GB that attached to the logic board, then there's a 3.5\" 1TB HDD.  Technically, you could upgrade the PCIe blade SSD drive, but after some research, I found it wasn't really economical.\nAll you need is a standard SSD to replace that HDD. You then create a fusion drive using CoreStorage and you will end up with an SSD with 1.13 TB of total storage.\nAs per Everymac.com....\n\n\nThe basic steps for this upgrade are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up data\n\n*Remove the screen\n\n*Replace the SSD (you will need a 3.5\" to 2.5\" HDD adapter\n\n*Replace the screen\n\n*Reinstall / Restore from Backup.\n\n\nI've actually answered this question on another thread:  27 imac Late 2012 HDD Failure\nWhile you are doing all these upgrades, I would upgrade the memory as well.  I used Crucial Memory and your iMac can get up to 32GB of RAM\n\nA: The slot is proprietary, and it is not an M.2 or mSATA slot.\nI have seen no adapters on the market that will allow you to connect an ordinary SATA drive to the proprietary connector. Such an adapter would need to include an amount of electronics, as it is a completely different interface - i.e. it is not just a passive adapter.\nThe only other supplier of compatible SSDs than Apple that I know of is OWC (Macsales). They have a series of SSDs (Aura 6G) compatible with the late 2012 model of the 27\" iMac:\nhttps://eshop.macsales.com/shop/ssd/owc/imac-27-inch/2012\n\nA: I can confirm that swapping the apple SSD for some other SSD is possible in the late 2012 iMac. But I can also confirm that the connector used by the Apple SSD is not mSATA: Although it has the same pin layout, the pins are smaller and don't fit the connector of an mSATA SSD.\nFortunately, I can confirm a third thing: There are adaptors available to convert this proprietary apple connector to a standard mSATA connector. Those are easily found on the Internet on various online shops, and usually called \"iMac 2012 mSATA adaptor\" or anything similar. I only found one called \"MacBook Pro 2012 mSATA adaptor\", but that one worked as well, so the connector in 2012 MacBook Pro seems to be the same as the one in my iMac.\nStill, use such adaptors with caution! Even if it's really low-tech (narrowing the pin layout a bit, no electronics needed), they may be faulty and might damage to your hardware.\nFurthermore, don't forget about the fan issue when swapping the HDD as well: The iMac's internal fan controller won't recognize the HDD temperature of a non-pre installed HDD, even if it's the same brand and model: Apple has built proprietary firmware for the drives shipped with Macs, probably to prevent users from swapping them. I can confirm that this issue applies for the late 2012 iMac as well.\nSee my photos for pin differences of the original Apple SSD and the mSATA SSD, as well as the installed adaptor.\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Create 2 independent audio outputs to apple TV and headphones So I have this setup:\nMacbookPro, external DELL monitor and Samsung TV that is connected to Apple TV.\nI study at home at the moment and use the laptop extensively. Sometimes I play movies to my flatmates via my Mac, but I want to keep the ability to watch my study videos on a Mac too.\nSo for example:\nPlaying a movie via Apple TV and have the audio output on the Samsung TV, at the same time having videos playing on my mac and have the sound coming from the headphones connected directly to my Mac.\nI have looked at Aggregate Device in Audio MIDI setup on OS X, but I can't seem to figure out how to set it up properly.\nI hope it is possible to do what I am looking for and I would really appreciate any advice.\nThanks\n\nA: An aggregated device is intended to play the same audio on multiple devices. As you want to play different audio on multiple devices, I can recommend several methods.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use iTunes to play the video file on your Apple TV. You can choose the Apple TV as a playback device in iTunes, and stream the content to it without having to change your system audio device. That means, audio produced by other applications is still processed by your Mac (and therefore by your headphones, if they're plugged in)\n\n*Use VLC and another playback application of your choice in combination. Use screen mirroring to display the content on your Apple TV. Obviously, this will change your system audio device to the Apple TV, and any other audio will be played on the Apple TV, as well. But that's okay, because with VLC you can choose which device to play the audio on - seperated from the system audio device. So setup any playback application on the Apple TV, and choose Headphones in VLC audio menu for playing your video.\n\n\nObviously, the first method will work best, because streaming the video content from iTunes will require less bandwith than mirroring your desktop, resulting in less latency or connection drops.\n", "Q: I can't edit music on my ipod I was using ipod nano and itunes on my previous computer.

There is only a list of all of the music on iPod and I can play it, but I cant delete it or add new music. There is a button edit playlist, but even if I click it I still can't edit the music on my ipod.\n\nA: Were you using an older version of iTunes on the old computer? They have made a number of redesigns in how iTunes works.

What is this button for, and why am I seeing it in YouTube only?\n\n\nA: That button is to convert Simplified Chinese to Complicated Chinese.\nSo you select some Simplified Chinese text like:\n我喜欢吃面包 (I like to eat bread)\nTap that Chinese pop up option and it converts it to:\n我喜歡吃麵包 (I like to eat bread)\nWhich is the Complicated Chinese version of that sentence, but still retains the same meaning.\nYou can do this vice versa.\nIf you don't use Chinese at all, you can just simply ignore it.\n\nSome additional information.\nComplicated Chinese is the traditional Chinese used for thousands of years. China and Taiwan used to have it has their main language but now only Taiwan has it.\nChina uses Simplified Chinese to make writing simpler.\nIt's not very complicated to convert from one to another as there is hardly any grammatical changes.

I ended up successfully removing the right fan assembly and removing the carpet obstructing the airflow. However, the left fan assembly (the exhaust fan) I was unable to remove, due to the screws being stripped. My laptop is running on the hot side, as airflow is not optimal (I can barely feel any air when the fan's RPM is at maximum).\nSo, I'm looking for options to deal with this problem. I already tried the \"rubber band technique\" with no success. So my thoughts are to try, in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a piece of cloth under the screwdriver instead of a rubber band.\n\n*The \"super glue technique,\" gluing a screwdriver to the screw and then using acetone to remove the glue.\n\n*Looking into screw extractors.\n(Alternatives are greatly welcomed.)\nHowever, this is contingent on finding a place to procure new screws. The iFixit guide reads:\n\nRemove the three 3.4 mm (3.1 mm) T6 Torx screws securing the left fan\n  to the logic board.\n\nIs there a place where I can cheaply buy the necessary screws? I haven't had much luck with searching online, with Google favoring results for screw drivers and the few options I've found being expensive 100-count boxes.\n\nA: If you end up with option 3. Screw extractors, then your 'cheap choice' to put it back together is just make a saw cut in the top of the screw [remains] & treat it as a standard flat-blade screw-head from then on in.\nI presume you have one of those, but didn't procure the necessary Torx before starting out ;-)\nDon't try saw-cutting it first... you really don't want metal filings in your puter.\nThat also precludes trying to drill the screw-head off.\nTry 1 & 2 first, you might get lucky.\n", "Q: Exchange Apple Watch after 14 day policy I bought my watch 19 days ago so it's 5 days over the policy.

My watch had a problem after and it's not a lot after the 14 day window so I was wondering if they will still exchange it for me. \n\nA: If by it froze you mean it's not working anymore, then it's a case for warranty.

It's in German, but I think it's clear. There is about 1GB of app data including photos and the total backup size is 4GB.  Before the switch to the new phone it was 2GB total with 1GB app data.  What are these 2GB and how can I get rid of them?\n\nUpdate: Here is another observation. If I delete my iCloud backup and do a fresh backup it comes at about 2GB total size (which is what I expect).  After two days including taking lots of pictures, transfering them to the Mac, syncing them back etc., however, I was back at 4GB.\n\nA: After talking to Apple Support and trying various things, I conclude that this is a bug in iCloud.\nI've made the following observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backups to iTunes always have the size they should have (about 2.8GB in my case)\n\n*Backups to iCloud when first created are of the correct size and then constantly grow (after I month I saw about 10GB).\n\n*Apple Support has no solution to offer except to periodically delete the iCloud backup and recreate it from scratch.\n\n\nFor reference, this only started after I migrated my iPhone 5S to an iPhone SE via an iTunes backup.  Before this migration iCloud backups worked as expected.\nEdit in 2018: indeed the bug was fixed later and backup size went back to normal a few weeks after this answer. \n", "Q: Can't download apps from App Store since updating to iOS 9.3.2 I updated to iOS 9.3.2 and now I can't download anything on the App Store.

One is Applescript and the other a Bash shell script. The shell script needs to run concurrently with the applescript, return some values and then exit.

I am trying to share a folder with many Numbers files with iCloud, by sharing each file with an AppleScript and saving the path of each shared file so that I can send it to my collaborators. To do that, I use System Events. I got to the point in which I can share the files, but I cannot do something really simple.\nBy default, when you share a file  Numbers gives you the \"Mail\" option by default in the \"Invite with...\" . There is also an option \"Copy link\". If I find a way to select that option, I can get then everything else working.  However, despite my many attempts, I could find no way to tell System Events to change that default selection. Yet I can see what syntax Automator uses for the very same action, but when I copy that syntax into Script Editor, the action is not executed.\nIf you want to understand what the problem is, assuming that you have a 'test.numbers' file into your Numbers folder of your iCloud disk, the following script will share that file (paste it into the Script Editor app):\n=====\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        open POSIX file \"/Users/[\n   XXXPUT HERE YOUR USER NAME\n   ]/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Numbers/Documents/test.numbers\"\n\n        end tell\n    delay 2\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process \"Numbers\"\n            delay 1\n            tell menu bar 1\n                tell menu bar item \"Share\"\n                    tell menu \"Share\"\n                        delay 1\n                        click menu item \"Share Link via iCloud…\"\n                        delay 1\n                    end tell\n                end tell\n            end tell\n            click button \"Share Spreadsheet\" of UI element 1 of sheet 1 of window \"test\"\n            delay 5\n        end tell\n        delay 5\n        tell process \"Numbers\"\n            tell menu bar 1\n                tell menu bar item \"Numbers\"\n                    tell menu \"Numbers\"\n                        delay 1\n                        click menu item \"Quit Numbers\"\n                    end tell\n                end tell\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\n\n=====\nHowever, I found no way to do the simple extra step of changing the default value of mailing the link (you will see that the script paste the link into a message.\nDoes anybody have any clue as to how to achieve that?

I did find a way by using key alternatives. To do the exact bit of work that I needed, the following  sequence will do:\n-- after opening the document in Numbers, open the share window:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Numbers\"\n        delay 1\n        tell menu bar 1\n            tell menu bar item \"Share\"\n                tell menu \"Share\"\n\n                    delay 1\n                    click menu item \"Share Link via iCloud…\"\n\n                end tell\n\n            end tell\n        end tell\n\n    end tell\n\n-- once the share dropdown window is open, use the following key combination\ntell application \"System Events\"\n--add tabs\n\n    delay 1\n    key code 48\n    delay 1\n    key code 48\n    delay 1\n    -- use arrows to move to the right part of the 'Share' window\n    key code 124\n    delay 1\n    key code 124\n\n    delay 3\n    --  click return\n    key code 36\n\n    delay 8\n    -- save the file and close it\n    keystroke \"s\" using {command down}\n    delay 4\n    keystroke \"w\" using {command down}\n\nThe long answer is: it is a pain in the neck for a series of reasons.\nFirst, when you create a Numbers file, it is a simple file. However, when it is shared, or when it is being saved in iCloud, it becomes a package. Applescript sees packages as folders, so you have to do some check before doing anything as to whether what you are dealing with is a folder or a package. Then you can go on to the sharing operations.\nNow, I found NO principle way to intercept when exactly a file becomes a package. That is, when you open a Numbers file and ask it to be shared, you will see that Numbers gives you a \"preparing the document to share\" message. This, I found, is when the file is transformed into a package. There is a property that one can use in order to check if a given path corresponds to a package or a single file: one could loop while (package folder of the item_info is false) and then continue, but this property becomes set as true well before Numbers has finished its own \"preparing the document to share\" work. So I could only guess when I can continue and go to the sharing part of the script. I  put a rough delay of 30 seconds when a file is not yet a package, which should give plenty of time for Numbers to finish its transformations of the file to share:\nif (this_package_folder is false) and (this_extension is in the extension_list) then\n    delay 30\nend if\n\nSecond, you must be on a good network, so that all operations related to Numbers in iCloud can be done smoothly -- otherwise,     iCloud will give you error messages that will block the execution of the script\nThird, you have to take care of the .DS_Store files and other files that may be inside the folder where you put your Numbers  documents to be shared.\nFourth, if you want to identify where the iCloud folder with the documents to be shared is, from inside AppleScript you won't see it as you see it from the finder (i.e., in the iCloud Drive), but you will have to look for it in /yourUser/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud Drive/yourfolder. \nWith all these caveats, here is the script that I am using now. In my system, it works. It assumes several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*there is a folder in your iCloud where your Numbers documents are\n\n*you have a file where you want to save the paths of the files that will be shared, so that you know the paths that you have to communicate to those with who you want to  share your files. In my case, I use a Pages document. \n\n*the files to be shared ARE NOT already shared. Otherwise, the script will give errors.\n\n*you don't care about errors and style. The script has no error checks. I am not a programmer. \n\n\nThe script will ask you to first identify the folder with the documents to be shared, then the Pages file where you want to save the paths of the shared documents, and then will open the documents to be shared one by one, will share them, will save them, will copy their path to the Pages document that you selected, and finally will quit Numbers and Pages. Give plenty of time for the script to execute and don't interfere with it. Notice that when you open each Numbers file, you can modify the script so that you insert specific operations that you want to be done on your files, always with the same technique (for example, in my case I need to find a cell, find a value, copy it somewhere else and save it. This part of the procedure is not in the script below. You can add whatever your fantasy leads you to invent as contorted and complicated operations). \nNow, if somebody finds a way to REVERSE the operation, unsharing the shared files, and especially, a way to tell if a file is ALREADY shared or not, so that the script acquires generality.... \nI paste the script below.  \n-- Beginning of the script\nglobal f\n\nproperty extension_list : {\"numbers\"}\ntell application \"Finder\"\nset source_folder to choose folder with prompt \"Please select directory.\"\nset posixSource_Folder to POSIX path of source_folder\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    set these_items to POSIX path of disk items of folder posixSource_Folder\nend tell\n\nmy createList(these_items)\nend tell\n\non createList(these_items)\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set f to (choose file with prompt \"Choose a file where to store the paths\")\n    end tell\nend tell\nset posixF to POSIX path of f\ndelay 2\ntell application \"Finder\" to open file f\ndelay 1\nrepeat with i from 1 to the count of these_items\n    set this_item to item i of these_items\n\n    set the item_info to info for this_item\n    set this_extension to the name extension of item_info\n    if folder of the item_info is true and (package folder of the item_info is false) and (this_extension is not in the extension_list) then\n\n        process_folder(this_item)\n\n    else\n        if (this_extension is in the extension_list) then\n            process_item(this_item)\n\n        end if\n    end if\nend repeat\nclose_files()\nend createList\n\n-- this sub-routine processes folders \non process_folder(this_folder)\n-- set these_items to list folder this_folder without invisibles\nset posix_this_folder to POSIX path of this_folder\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    set these_items to POSIX path of disk items of folder posix_this_folder\nend tell\nrepeat with i from 1 to the count of these_items\n    --set this_item to alias ((this_folder as Unicode text) & (item i of these_items))\n    set the item_info to info for this_item\n    set this_extension to the name extension of item_info\n    --if folder of the item_info is true and (this_extension is not in the extension_list) then\n    if folder of the item_info is true and (package folder of the item_info is false) and (this_extension is not in the extension_list) then\n\n        process_folder(this_item)\n    else\n        if (package folder of the item_info is true) and (this_extension is in the extension_list) and (alias of the item_info is false) then\n            process_item(this_item)\n\n        end if\n\n\n    end if\n   end repeat\nend process_folder\n\n-- this sub-routine processes files \n\non process_item(this_item)\nset the item_info to info for this_item\nset this_extension to the name extension of item_info\nset this_package_folder to the package folder of item_info\nset Posix_Item to POSIX path of this_item\n\nset Posix_File to POSIX file Posix_Item\ndelay 1\n--opening the Numbers file\ntell application \"Finder\" to open Posix_File\ndelay 3\n-- going to Numbers and making the file shared\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Numbers\"\n        delay 1\n        tell menu bar 1\n            tell menu bar item \"Share\"\n                tell menu \"Share\"\n\n                    delay 1\n                    click menu item \"Share Link via iCloud…\"\n\n                end tell\n\n            end tell\n        end tell\n\n    end tell\n\n    -- extra time allowed for non packages\n\n    delay 3\nend tell\nif (this_package_folder is false) and (this_extension is in the extension_list) then\n\n    delay 30\nend if\n\n\n--tabs\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    delay 1\n    key code 48\n    delay 1\n    key code 48\n    delay 1\n    -- arrows\n    key code 124\n    delay 1\n    key code 124\n\n    delay 3\n    --  returns\n    key code 36\n\n    -- leave some time for Numbers to actually share the file.

I have:\n    tell application \"AppleScript Editor\" to open \"Fallen_Order_Intro.sctp\"\n\nWhen I do this, it says that it can't open \"Fallen_Order_Intro.sctp\" because it is a text document, (which it isn't).  Am I going about it the wrong way? Is there a different way I should be trying to open a script file? Thank you\n\nA: You're close.\nGet the path to your file by making a one-line script:\nset the_file to choose file\n\nCopy the result of that. Then, in the script that will open the \"Fallen_Order_Intro\" script, tell the Finder to do the opening for you, pasting in your second script's path, obtained using the \"choose file\" script. Here's how it would look if your \"Fallen_Order_Intro\" script is on your desktop (and if your user name is sdavis).\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    open alias \"Macintosh HD:Users:sdavis:Desktop:Fallen_Order_Intro.scpt\"\nend tell\n\nThat's all there is to it. The file will open in Script Editor because the Finder knows it's a Script Editor document.\n", "Q: One Mac can print to network printer, one cannot I have a mid-2010 Macbook Pro running El Capitan (IP: 192.168.1.65) and a newer Macbook Air (~2014) (IP: 192.168.1.71) running El Capitan. Both are connected wirelessly to the same network: a U-Verse router (IP: 192.168.1.254). I have an Okidata MC362W (IP: 192.168.1.78) wired to the U-Verse router. All on a subnet of 255.255.255.0. The Macbook Air can print using CUPS without issue. The Macbook Pro prints OK until it doesn't also using CUPS and the Internet Printing Protocol. Then it will stop seeing the IP address. If I reboot the U-Verse, which takes more than 5 minutes, the Macbook Pro can then usually see the printer again until the same issue comes around 4 or 5 days later.\nHere's what I've done: \n\n\n*\n\n*I've assigned a static IP to the printer. The Macbook Pro is not\nusing the same IP and it is not using the same IP of anything else on the network. \n\n*I've manually repaired permissions on the Macbook\nPro \n\n*I've reset the printer settings on the MBP to default \n\n*I updated the firmware on the OKIDATA \n\n*I've uninstalled and re-installed the printer multiple times \n\n*I've installed the most up-to-date drivers for the printer \n\n*I've tried to print using Airprint -- it can see the\nprinter, it cannot connect to the printer \n\n*I cannot ping the printer from the MBP nor can I access its IP through the browser. \n\n*To the best of my ability, the network setup on the Macbook Air and the MBP are\nidentical\n\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions of something new to try? TIA.\n\nA: I solved the problem on my Mac. It was McAfee's firewall. It was blocking Bonjour communications... hence no printer sharing, or finding on the network.

I have tried resetting the SMC, resetting PRAM, reattaching the cables in the electronics of the computer. Now I am stuck for solutions and I think maybe I need to get a new wifi cable? It is a Macbook Pro 15\" early 2011 running OSX El Capitan.\n\nA: \n...reattaching the cables in the electronics of the computer.\n\nI am assuming by this statement, you have opened up your Macbook for whatever reason.  Did you do any sort of service?\n\nTry reseating the Airport adapter - remove it completely and reinstall it.  \nThere are 4 cables that go to this adapter.  Three are the antenna cables (J0, J1, and J2) and the interface to the logic board (right)\nIn addition to that, you have the interface cable that connects it to the logic board (below).  Notice the two connectors at each end.\n\nYou have 4 things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Airport card connector\n\n*The cable connectors\n\n*the cable itself\n\n*The logic board connector\n\n\nYou will have to look closely.  If you did any service to the MBP where removing these components was necessary, you may have damaged them either during removal or installation.  \nThe other scenario is that your Airport card simply failed; it happens.\nIf you damaged either the Airport card and/or the cable, you will have to replace them.  The good news is that they are available on the open market for less than $50\n\n\n*\n\n*Airport Bluetooth Card 661-5867 \n\n*Airport Bluetooth Flex Cable 821-1311-01\n\n\nIf you damaged the connector on the logic board, you will need to have it fixed, the logic board replaced, or get a USB Wifi Adapter like these Netgears (I have personally used them with Macbooks quite successfully). \n", "Q: How to enable journaling to be able to upgrade to El Capitan?

I want to create an AppleID account in iTunes/Apple Music. \niTunes forces me to provide a credit card. There is an option to select the country of my credit card. I have two cards issued in different countries and currently reside in third country. \nMy question is: does Apple consider my country to be the country of my credit card, and will all the restrictions and media of that particular country be applied?\nUPD:\nActually Apple asks twice whether I want to change the country. At first on Terms and Conditions step, and the second on the next step with credit card form. When I change the country, credit card form is also changed. Even secret questions are different for different countries.\n\n\n*\n\n*Terms and Conditions step.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Credit card form step.\n\n\n\nUPD 2:\nHere is what Apple says if I select a country of my credit card. And if I select other country Apple doesn't show this alert. This is what makes me think that Apple restricts access and contents depending on what country your credit card was issued.\n\n\nA: Yes it does.\nThink of iTunes Store (and Apple App Store) as having separate instances (stores) for each country that Apple Inc. offers the service for. In every country/region iTunes Store has its own offering, language, regulations, pricing, availability, age restrictions, etc.\nApple recognises users by either method of payment or their billing address and allows usage only of the iTunes Store of the region to which an account belongs.\nA given method of payment (credit card or prepaid card) is valid only for the country it is issued for (at least at the moment of registration, it can be changed later).\n", "Q: Sync custom icons between Macs I have an iMac I use everyday, and a MacBook Pro I use when I'm not at home.\nI use a lot of softwares, and I have customized the icons of them.\nEvery time I install a new app, or I change the icon of one of the existing ones, I have to do the same with the other computer.\nThis is pretty annoying, so, I was wondering if there is a software that let me backups my custom icons and apply them to another Mac when I need.\nI have found LiteIcon which seems to do a good job in simplifying the icons management, but it lacks an \"export\" and \"import\" feature, so it's pretty useless to me.\nIs there any alternative to achieve the result?\n\nA: I am almost positive there is no app that does this.

Today I was walking using my iPhone 6S running iOS 9.3 as a pedometer and it shutdown. \nWhen I got home and plugged it in, it said 30% capacity. \nThat seems strange. I would expect it for 2% or 5% to preserve RAM, but 30%? Maybe there is a setting I don't know about. \nMy question is: Why does my iPhone power off when the battery is down to 30%? \nEdit: this is not a duplicate of the low battery crash as I witnessed the low power shutdown and it was not a crash. \n\nA: This is usually for one of three reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Aging battery. Lithium ion cells chemically age and peak power output decreases as does total charge available to supply at various voltage levels. \n\n*Abnormal or failed / out of tolerance battery. Same as above, but the voltage and current is below spec for the battery age. \n\n*Bad calibration or hardware. I've never seen that be 30% off, though. After the battery is drained completely, charge the phone back to 100% completely (and for good measure, leave it on the charger for another hour or two). An iPhone can draw more power than a perfect battery can provide due to defect or damage. It might not be the battery. \n\n", "Q: How to prevent notifications of old Messages when I log into my Mac?

I solved it by doing the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backed up the entire volume as a DMG file (to an external drive). The file must be formatted as Read/Write, since the partition is corrupt and therefore requires repair before it is mounted.\n\n*After the back up is complete, verify the DMG is mountable and the files are accessible.\n\n*From Disk Utility, Verify and Repair the DMG and remove any remaining errors.\n\n\nAt this point you should delete the original partition. But because CoreStorage made the disk effectively read only, it is not possible to reformat the disk.

On the Mac, here are the steps I took to fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Note the song that fails, on my case it was a Zeppelin song.\n\n*Using the terminal, cd to the directory containing the song\n\n*Run ls -la and note the owner/permissions of the file that fails, in my case it was an alternate username I was using at one point, let's say that username is paulhewson, and your real username is hewson\n\n*Run sudo find . -user paulhewson from the top level music directory (~/Music), this shows all the music that is owned by this alternate user\n\n*This command will change the owner to your normal username: sudo find . -user paulhewson -exec chown hewson {} +\nI suspect this error could result from any sort of permission problem, in some cases maybe read-only or locked files, in which case you'd want to chmod or unlock the files.  If there are multiple types of permission problems, you may need to repeat this process a few times.  Might be easier to chmod/chown everything in music, but I tried to avoid that so I didn't cause other issues.\nCredit to this question for help with the find command to change ownership:\nChange owner for all files owned by x\n", "Q: Where are Anaconda's libraries for PYTHONPATH?

I can see the video as one picture and there is a white circle in it. But when saving, it simply says, there is no change and my video is not uploaded. After 5 tries I got a message the file could not be uploaded.\nThen I tried to upload the video from a windows browser (I normally do the most possible on windows, because there it works), but as expected it says it can only be uploaded from a safary browser. How stupid is this again. Then downloaded the safary browser on windows and tried again. With the safari browser on windows I even can't display the \"Itunes Connect\" page correctly. embarrassing , embarrassing.\nDoes anyone else has this problem ? Does anyone has a hint ?\nHow can I upload the video, which is correct ?\n\nA: Apple doesn't appear to allow for uploads of app previews from Windows computers: their page states that uploads must be done from Safari and 10.10 (though I suspect 10.11 would work as well.

Though it successfully used the new disk to backup whilst recognizing the old backups, instead of creating another incremental backup (as expected normally), it instead created a full backup. As a result, the old backups were deleted from the new drive to make room for the full backup (I still have the original drive and all of its data.) This is not the desired result for me, as I would like to keep my old backups. \nAttempted Solutions\n\nThis question seems to indicate some similar problem, but has no resolution. Using BackupLoupe on the new disk per this post simply confirms this.\n\nAdditional Info\n\nRunning OS X 10.11.4 on an Early 2009 iMac.

it appears that extended attributes of relevant files are where the keys are held. Though FSEventIDs were indeed the culprit as @klanomath suspected, editing the main FSEvents database isn't enough alone, according to this Superuser post.. (I can't quote it here due to character limits.)\nHowever, looking at the SnapshotVolumeFSEventStoreUUIDs using xattr -l, they appear to be unique with each backup, regardless weather it's a full backup or not. SnapshotVolumeLastFSEventID doesn't seem to have the same format as SnapshotVolumeFSEventStoreUUID, instead being a much shorter string of characters. Only SnapshotVolumeUUID appears to remain consistent.\nUnfortunately, I'm at a loss on how to cure this problem. Though I think it might be possible to postpone it, besides adding more space, I'm not sure if there even is a way to prevent it.\n\nA: Possible solution 1:\nInstead of following Apple's recommendation of copying the backup in the Finder,  you might want to try to use Disk Utility to restore the disk to the new disk (if the new disk is completely empty). \nPossible solution 2:\nFollow these instructions to make sure that MAC Address and UUID match.  I have successfully used this solution in a slightly different scenario, namely to change my backup computer identification so I could keep a backup of a certain state of my computer that would not be deleted when old backups are deleted.  It should also work the other way around.\n", "Q: How can I get the dev name associated to a Volume name?

As soon as it is connected internally instead of the standard HDD, it does not show up in disk utility and can't be used as startup disk or location to where the OS should be installed. \nI cloned the working version of my HDD to the SSD, but when it is booting internally from the SSD (which now has a working version of Mac OS X on it), it freezes as soon as the progress bar reached 100%. It sits there for over an hour (I canceled it at that point always). Booting from the same drive externally boots into a clean working version of El capitan without any problems. \nJudging from what I read online, a possible issue might be that the internal SATA cable doesn't support SATA III, which is used by this SSD. Before I go and buy a replacement cable, I would like to make sure there isn't another problem that could also cause this.\nI have so far only tried net recoveries, and am currently downloading the OS image to burn it to a USB and try from there again. This is to eliminate errors that might come from a broken OS file (my Internet connection sometimes stops working).\nUpdate: Also a recovery from USB with the internal SSD brings the same problems.\nThe drive itself works flawlessly on Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10,  both as external and internal drive.\n\nA: The problem was the internal SATA cable. After exchanging it - this is quite an easy operation, there are plenty of videos on Youtube that describe exactly how it's done - the drive booted flawlessly and is running at a negotiated link speed of 6 Gigabit.\nTo make sure an SSD will work with a Macbook, the Link Speed of the SATA controller should be checked in About This Mac > System Report > Hardware > SATA/SATA Express \n", "Q: Format USB for Samsung TV What's the simplest way to format a USB stick and write some video files to it in order for the Samsung TV to read it? As far as I know Samsung TVs support the FAT format (or maybe ExFAT too), but if I format the USB to FAT then I can't seem to be able to write to it (or even see it in Finder).\nPS: I don't have access to a Windows machine\n\nA: Simply use Disk Utility to format it as FAT, as Macs can indeed read and write to FAT drives–they just have problems with NTFS drives.\nInsert your flash drive. Open Disk Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility), select your flash drive in the sidebar, then click \"Erase\" in the top bar. Select \"MS-DOS (FAT)\" for your format, and Master Boot Record for your scheme.\n\nNote that the FAT file system has a limitation of 4GB file size. If you want to circumvent this whilst still being able to use OS X, format the drive as exFAT (which has a file size limitation of 128 PiB). This option has been recently hidden with 10.11, so it takes a bit more work.\nOpen Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal). Run the command defaults write com.apple.DiskUtility advanced-image-options 1. This gives you access to hidden features within Disk Utility. Open Disk Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility), select your flash drive in the sidebar, then click \"Erase\" in the top bar. Select \"ExFAT\" for your format, and Master Boot Record for your scheme. \n\n", "Q: Xcode install command via OS X Terminal I have Mac OS X version 10.5.7 so I downloaded Xcode version 4.6.3 and launched it.\nAccording to many tutorials (such as this) I am supposed to install further command line tools via terminal: xcode-select --install\nBut all I get is a little manual page:\nUsage: xcode-select -print-path\n   or: xcode-select -switch <xcode_folder_path>\n   or: xcode-select -version\nArguments:\n   -print-path                     Prints the path of the current Xcode folder\n   -switch <xcode_folder_path>     Sets the path for the current Xcode folder\n   -version                        Prints xcode-select version information\n\nI went into the Applications directory and tried to run the command from there, but the same outcome.\nIn fact, the content of my Applications directory revealed through the following command is strange:\n~ cd Applications\n\n~ ls\nChrome Apps.localized\n\nWhat am I missing or doing wrong?\n\nA: The command line install works on much newer OS than yours - the tutorial you link is 10.10 and Xcode 6 or 7.\nIf you can't upgrade to 10.6.8 and then get past Lion, I would suggest run the graphical installer and look for Xcode possibly in /Developer if you don't see it in the /Applications folder. \n", "Q: Minimum volume size to enable versioning I have certain documents stored on a password protected disk image stored on Dropbox. Since the documents are small text documents, I made the image small (100 MB).

So my question is, what's the minimum volume size I should use to avoid this warning?\n\nA: For others looking for an answer, it's 600 MB or larger (599 fails, 600 succeeds). Using a sparse disk helps save space from using a \"too large\" volume, FWIW.\n", "Q: How to show all dates (jubilees) from contacts on calendar There is 1 calendar, that shows only birthday dates from contacts on iphone/mac OS. But if 1 contact has several dates (e.g. jubilee, birthday of kids or other important dates) that i want to be shown in calendar on iphone or mac OS.\nHow can it be done? And can it?\nThanks.\n\nA: Nope. You can add custom dates in Contacts\n\nand create repeating events in Calendar,\n\nbut there's no automatic linkage between the two. The best you'll get is something like BirthdayScanner which scans all dates in Contacts then allows you to add them to your Calendar, but there's no first-party automagic solution.\n", "Q: Adding a new picture to the appstore needs a new build of the app It seems to be true, that I have to build a new app-version for only adding a new picture in the appstore. So my App has the same code, but a new version and I don't know what to write in the update text for the users. Its stupid to write \"I uploaded a new picture, thats why you guys have to upgrade the app \".\nIs this just a design glitch again from Apple, or is there a real reason for that ? \n\nA: It was a slightly common tactic for spammers to change the screenshots to mimic a different app. Hence, from 2013, you are required to create a new app version to change screenshots.\nIdeally, you should not update your app version just to change the screenshots — perhaps you can wait until you really have a new version to upload?\nYou can read more about this functionality at App Store Screenshot Changes - MacStories.\n", "Q: Will grayscale increase or decrease battery consumption? If I turn on grayscale on my iPhone 6, will the consumption of battery increase or decrease?\n\nA: It makes no difference on the iPhone 6. So neither a reduction, nor extra consumption.\nSome sources that tell the same story:\n\n\n*\n\n*From a SuperUser question LCD/LED screens; how color affects the power consumption?:\n\nConventional LCDs and LED based LCDs consume power that largely depends only on the intensity of backlight. This means to save power you want to reduce brightness of the screen.\nOLED displays, like those found in Samsung (and other) smartphones, on the other hand, have power consumption that depends on color being displayed.\n\nAs the iPhone 6 uses a conventional IPS LCD panel, it means that the power usage is mainly due to the backlight - and the backlight power usage does not change whether the displayed image is full color or monochrome. However it does change according to the brightness setting and how dark the displayed image is.\n\n*From CNET's article LED LCD vs. OLED: TV display technologies compared:\n\nThe energy consumption of LCD only varies depending on the backlight setting. The lower the backlight, the lower the power consumption. A basic LED LCD with its backlight set low will draw less power than OLED.\n\n\nA: I haven't read any analysis of this, but my guess would be that it would make no significant difference. Really all that it does is average out the colors of all pixels (so red green and blue of each pixel are the same rather than different strengths). \nNight Shift does use a little extra battery, though. Apparently it uses more energy to show the yellower hues. But this isn't the same as that.\nIf you want to use less battery, you can turn on Power Saver mode (are you running iOS 9?). That will save energy by reducing certain things that use more power like email fetching.\nOther things to do are to close background apps, go to Settings>Privacy>Location Services and go to the bottom and go to system services and disable things you don't need it to use your location for.\nAlso wifi, Bluetooth, cellular data, these can all be turned off to save battery. Reduce the screen to minimum as well. Don't do anything on the phone you don't need to. If possible put it in airplane mode or shut it altogether.\n\nA: I have an iPhone 6 and have set the display to grayscale for an extended period of time. Unfortunately the phone runs extremely hot when on grayscale. I switched back to color mode and have not had any heating issues since. \n", "Q: Why is my Bootcamp asking for a windows installer disk? Firstly my computer specs are:\nMacBook Pro: (13-inch, Mid 2010)\nProcessor: 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\nMemory: 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MB\nI'm trying to download windows 7 so I can play Overwatch, but my Bootcamp assistant keeps asking me to insert a \"Windows installer disk\" before the partition option comes up. Isn't the reason I use bootcamp so that I don't need a disk to run windows?\nI have been trying to get my computer to run in windows 7 for the past 3 days now and nothing that various guides on the internet have suggested has worked. I know my computer is compatible with Windows, but it just won't boot my computer in Windows at all. I have been watching guides on Youtube, but since my model is 6 years old I'm assuming they don't work because they are using different models.\nCan anyone tell me what it is that I'm doing wrong, and how to fix it?\n\nA: you still need to install a legal copy of windows so bootcamp can run windows. That is why the disk request. once windows is installed, bootcamp will run no problem.\n", "Q: How do I get all music off my iPhone without losing my audiobooks? I never purchased any music and am not subscribed to iTunes Match. Everything in settings is set to \"no\" or \"off\". I have unwanted, unpurchased music and want to get it off my iPhone. However, I have two audiobooks, sync'd through iTunes from my computer, that I do not want to lose.

If you want to permanently hide it, from a Finder window, select View | Show view options, then un-tick 'Show icon preview', then click 'Use as defaults'.  (Note that this will change all of your defaults to whatever settings are shown.)\n", "Q: How to reset to default permissions on El Capitan During development and debugging I have changed permissions of various files and folders using chown and chmod on my local system (I didnt maintain the list of changes). Now that I have fixed the issue, i fear of security consequences.\nAny way I could restore the default permissions and/or find vulnerabilities in terms of network security or other potential loop holes that might create due to my changes.\n\nA: For system installed packages you can run the following command in Terminal.app to find permissions that differ from the default:\n\nsudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --verify --standard-pkgs /\n\nIf you want to just apply those permissions to your system as a whole, run the following command:\n\nsudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --verify --standard-pkgs /\n\nOr you could individually fix the permissions that you have changed yourself using chmod/chown.\nFor everything else, you need to have used either a package manager that can verify permissions, or have a backup you can use for comparing permissions before and after the event.\nFor others: Please note that the repair_packages command no longer exists in Sierra and newer macOS versions, as they now automatically handle repairing permissions.

Is there any way to download El Capitan without AppStore? I am downloading OSX El Capitan through AppStore and it runs already 10 hours. I have downloaded 1,5 GB so far. I fear I can't work next week because of this slow download process. I need it because of the new XCode.\nI already tried to download a torrent with this OS, which took me only 30 mins from a Windows System. But I had problems installing it, because it seems to be corrupt.\nIs there another way to upgrade without using the AppStore ? I think about the dmg, which could be simply downloaded. \nOr how can someone upgrade an Apple OS in one day ? \n\n\nI added a new speedtest herer, because it seems not to be clear enough. \n\n\nA: The short answer is no - Apple does not provide any alternative method. A short analysis is something is massively wrong with your network or your computer since 10 hours to download 6 GB of data is something that would bring Apple's iTunes / App Store / software update service to a crashing halt if it affected everyone.\nNow - the answer is also yes. Once you or someone you know has downloaded the Application to install El Capitan, you can install it to USB stick and share it, but this is also how many malware get distributed when people find some random site on the internet and download El Capitan from a site and don't verify checksum.\nApple does allow people to operate a caching server so that when the first person on a network segment downloads a specific app or book , it gets cached locally.

How do I make symbolic links to free some disk space? So I have a partitioned hard drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X 10.9 (my start-up disk)\n\n*OS X 10.6 (obviously running Snow Leopard)\n\n*Share\n\n\nBefore you ask, it was a gift and came partitioned like this. The idea is that all my documents would be in \"Share\" and OS X 10.9/10.6 would have symbolic links to the Documents, Desktop, etc directories in Share so I would have access to the same documents no matter what OS I'm running. \nHowever, I realized I'm quickly running out of space on my start-up disk. I found that in OS X 10.9, I have a directory called Volumes, which has a symbolic link to OS X 10.9, but then real directories to Share and OS X 10.6. I can go into OS X 10.6 and find the same Volumes folder, and the process repeats.\nIs there any way I can replace the directories OS X 10.9/Volumes/OS X 10.6 and OS X 10.9/Volumes/Share with symbolic links directly to OS X 10.6/ and Share/?

The volumes mounted to /Volumes don't use any space on the boot volume.\nSo replacing them with links doesn't create any free space!\n\nSwapping and unifying your user folders (10.6 and 10.9) in \"Share\" and linking it back to each of the /Users/ folders isn't recommended because some content in ~/Library or ~/Music may be incompatible with either 10.6 or 10.9. \nSo better move the big files like Movies to \"Share\" or delete one of the two system partitions after moving all content to the other system partition or to \"Share\".\n", "Q: Partition alert message when using Boot Camp Assistant: \"The startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition.\" I have a 13\" Early-2015 MBP Retina in which I am trying to install Windows 8.1 on.

With the new Macs that qualified for the free downloads, the first time you signed in to the App Store you would be prompted to \"Accept\" iPhoto, iMovie and Garageband which would then bind these apps to your Apple ID as purchases (although they were free). At this point you could then technically download them on all machines that you owned for free, provided they met system requirements and you remembered your Apple ID and password (no activation key required).\nIf you're running Mac OS X 10.6.8 though, Apple outlines that only iPhoto 9.2.3 or lower is compatible, which is not available on the App Store.\nIf you could locate your original discs that came with your Mac, you could reinstall iPhoto from the second disc titled \"Applications Install DVD\".\nIf your Mac came with an older OS than Snow Leopard and you upgraded after the fact it may not have included these applications to begin with (depending on how old).\nYou could try calling Apple. As of 2 years ago I know they were still able to replace this disc for you with an original for $15 upon request.\nI am curious though... if you have a button that says \"Update\" and not \"Download\", barring any other weird glitches that usually means that the App Store is seeing the \"iPhoto.app\" SOMEWHERE on your hard drive.

It would probably not be a generally sought feature, one that apple would likely implement itself, but perhaps a third-party app exists?\n\nA: I was looking for a similar app for video (projector issues), I came across a lot of mirror apps that were mainly for photo's and other images but some for text, others for both, as we as for inverting colours. Just search \"mirror\" in the app store.\n\nA: I haven't tried any of these, but this question sounds similar enough to potentially be of some use:\nhorizonally flip OSX's monitor output?

How can I get the Dock to read the updated plist settings without killing it? \nThe setting is stored in the com.apple.dock plist, this is the command to update it (toggling the boolean):\ndefaults write com.apple.dock expose-group-apps -bool FALSE\n\nIdeally, I want to use this command to quickly change the setting so I can use both window grouping modes with Mission Control, but restarting the dock is slow and disruptive, usually expanding any application windows minimized into the Dock. Is there some sort of notification/ping I can use to alert the Dock to its new settings?\n\nA: Send the Dock process a signal called the 'hang-up' or HUP, also known as signal number 1 as defined somewhere in a system signals.h header file.  POSIX convention, I believe.\nThe quick and dirty:\nsudo pkill -1 Dock\n\nWhat a HUP signal should effectuate in the receiving process is an internal halt and re-evaluation, which usually includes a re-reading of any relevant config files.  The process will not terminate, only 'refresh' itself.\nHope this helps.\nF.\n\nA: In a word, no.\nThe only way to get the Dock to re-read its preference plist is to kill it and wait for it to respawn.\n", "Q: Did 25k on the bike, iPhone says 7.8 k I just got back from a ride where other people had odometers on their bike. They read 26 km. My iPhone's HealthKit said 7.8 km of walking and running.\nIs HealthKit just not useful for biking, or is there some way to get it to recognize biking?\n\nA: Cycling doesn't trigger the 'step' recognition the way actual steps do. \nThe subsystem responsible for the step sensor in fact does a great deal of work to filter out anything that isn't an actual step. \nSo the fact that some cycle moves make it through could actually be considered a flaw. \nWhat actual cycling apps do instead is:\n\n\n*\n\n*use the location service (e.g. GPS) of the phone,\n\n*merge this with optional data from other sensors (like wheel speed or cadence),\n\n*optionally feed the resulting cycle metrics into the Health app. \n\n\nThis is why you can possibly find cycling data in someone's Health database – apps can use it to store their own sensor data or metrics. But so far (early 2016) iPhones don't directly feature built-in cycling sensors. \n", "Q: Examine a .DS_Store file?

Recently I've been seeing emojis under the frequently used section that I've never even used before. Is it possible I'm seeing my husbands frequently used emojis on my phone somehow?\n\nA: The list of frequently used emoji is literally a list of emojis that you've used most often. This list does not synchronise over iCloud. The only other way emojis could be in the list is that the frequent list is pre-populated when restoring iOS with a standard set of emojis.\n\nA: The same thing happened to me.  I was reading on some White Nationalist websites and all of a sudden the Star of David with the dot in the center, a magnifying glass, and the Patriarchal Cross/Orthodox Cross showed up in my frequently used emojis.  I have never used any of these.  There must be a link between what you read online and your frequently used emojis.\n", "Q: What automatic script runs with Bourne Shell (/bin/sh) for root?

On the Bourne Again Shell (/bin/bash), I can edit /var/root/.bash_profile. But with the Bourne Shell (/bin/sh), what script do I edit for that?\n\nA: This answer comes close to answering the question, but I need to start using sudo su - instead of sudo su in order to switch from regular user to root or the /var/root/.profile script won't execute.\nNow, unless Apple changes this, regular users by default will get the Bash shell, instead of the Bourne shell, which is unlike the root user.

I tried plugging it in but somehow the charger port (like where you plug the charger in) is deformed or something because the charger will only go in about halfway. I'm sure this makes the usual methods of data recovery a bit more complicated. Is it possible to still recover my photos?\n\nA: First consider ofcourse if you have any backups on your computer, in iCloud or other cloud services.\nIf not, and you're not able to fix the defective port by yourself, you can use a data recovery service. They might be able to retrieve the photos.\nIn the past I have successfully used IBAS / Kroll Ontrack data recovery services to recover data from an iPhone with a similar problem. However, note that it is guaranteed that it will work - and there might be complications if your data is encrypted, etc. However, they are able to provide an analysis for a limited fee, so that you know before paying the full fee, how likely it is for you to get all your data back.\nTheir homepage is here:\nhttp://www.krollontrack.co.uk\nI cannot see from your profile where you are located, but they operate in many different countries.\n", "Q: Is Adobe illustrator GPU acceleration available on Mac mini with iris graphics card is Adobe illustrator GPU acceleration available with a Mac mini with i7, 16go ram and the  iris graphics card?

My system is OS X El Capitan 10.11.5. I copied from my OS X Extended filesystem to FAT32 about 30 Gb files by Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V. \nNow, I received a proposal to do it by cp -R. \nI am wondering how different it is from the Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. \n\nHow is cp -R different from Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V?\n\nA: When copying and pasting via Finder there is certain meta-data that is maintained that when using cp -R it's not.\nAn example is when copying and pasting via Finder the created/modified date/time stamp of individual files are maintained to that of the existing meta-date vs. using cp -R where both the created/modified date/time stamp are set to the date/time of the copy operation.\nOn directories when copying and pasting via Finder the created date/time stamp is maintained to that of its current value and the modified date/time stamp is set to the date/time of the copy operation. vs. using cp -R where both the created/modified date/time stamp are set to the date/time of the copy operation.\nNow if you use cp -aR the created date/time stamp is set to the date/time of the copy operation and the modified date/time stamp is maintained to it value it had at the time of the copy operation.\nIn essence copying and pasting via Finder maintains all meta-data attributes that are supported by the destination filesystem and to get the most possible meta-data attributes maintained using cp then additional options must be used.  Have a look at the cp man page for additional command line options.\nFAT32 does not support all of the file attributes that HFS+ does, however copying via Finder preserves more then cp regardless of the options implemented.\n\nA: cp and rsync have a lot of options that modify which attributes (ownership, unix permissions, POSIX ACLs, resource forks in some cases!) will be/will not be transferred/reset, and how certain types of files will be included/excluded, and how links to files or directories will be handled(copying the link vs copying what it points to). It is unlikely that just using -R will get the same behaviour as what you are doing with Finder.\nAlso: In Finder, you can only directly select things to copy that you can see OR which are inside a folder (or anywhere in the subfolder tree of it) that you can see and that you explicitly selected. Depending on your settings that could exclude anything prefixed with \".\" , and probably some other structures that Finder treats as special.\n", "Q: How can I see a list of apps that have the ability to record my keyboard history? How can I see a list of programs/services that have the ability to record my keyboard history? My goal is to prevent programs from recording my keyboard history without root privilege. I cannot seem to find any Apple's documentation on its security policies. References are also appreciated.\n\nA: *\n\n*Apps which are in the foreground are granted access to the keyboard automatically.\n\n*Apps which are run by your user account but are not in the foreground require accessibility access to access the keyboard. The list of applications granted access to this is available in System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Accessibility.

I got myself this WD 2TB USB3 external harddrive for backups: http://amzn.to/1X8b3a8\nI connected it to the USB 3.0 port of my mid 2015 Macbook Pro 15\".\nWhen I run Time Machine, it really takes veeeery long for the backup (about 10-20 hours for a 350 GB initial encrypted backup).\nSo I ran disk speed test with this result. Is this speed normal and does Time Machine backup really take that long?\n\n\nA: The speed you see there is not unusual. I have seen various USB3 external harddrives vary from about 60 MB/s to about 120 MB/s. These speeds can be expected from ordinary hard drives - you'll to buy an SSD to get much higher speeds.\nHowever please keep in mind that these speeds are the bulk transfer speed. I.e. if you transfer only one large file without any file system overhead, you would obtain these speeds.\nA backup will contain lots of small files which are individually stored. The random access read/write speeds of these portable USB drives are usually much lower than the bulk speed.\nCompared to my experience, it is not unusual for the first Time Machine back to take 10 hours. \n\nA: Time Machine and OS X is tuned to throttle the IO and possibly the CPU usage of the backup task. You can do a few things to modify that behavior - but from the speed benchmark and my experience - a 12 to 48 hour initial backup is not abnormal or indicative of slow backups once you have a few intervals backed up.\n\n\n*\n\n*You could log out and minimize other apps / changes to files to let the initial backup complete unhindered.\n\n*You could interrupt the backup, erase the backup destination and tweak the io throttle settings and measure if this helps the initial backup.\n\n\nTo do the second, you'll ned terminal and want to review this excellent answer as well as some speculation on the web.\ntmutil stopbackup\ntmutil destinationinfo\ntmutil removedestination DEB58ECE-531B-4295-85B4-82FC905A01EA\necho 'debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nAt that point, you would restart your Mac. When it restarts, then erase the USB 3 drive and establish it as the backup destination and start the initial backup again. There's no need to use the tmutil commands over the Time Machine preference if you like mouse control or visual feedback over terminal commands. The echo 'debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0' command needs to be run in terminal, though. \nLastly, you will need to change the removedestination command to command removal of your destination's unique ID instead of DEB58ECE-531B-4295-85B4-82FC905A01EA. Also, you might also see if your current backups are throttled and how they are doing work with:\nsudo fs_usage backup\n\nUnless you're really interested in analyzing the low level performance, I'd say you don't have a problem - just a slow initial experience - and revisit things in a week once the steady state backup timings are known. If you get hourly backups completing in 5 minutes or less - you probably shouldn't disable the debug timings as I listed above.\n\nA: Stop backing up and reboot then try this method. \nGo to a Terminal and enter:\nsudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0\n\nFor me, this sped it up from 72 hours to ~4 hours on a filesystem with 2.5 million files.\nIt’s also a good idea to re-enable the throttling after the initial backup has finished successfully with the following command:\nsudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=1\n\nMy case was solved.\n\nA: The first backup will always take a long time. Possibly even overnight. Then it gets faster because it backups only modified files. I had the same speed with an Airport Time Capsule.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for 'Clear filters' in excel in office 365 for mac How do you 'clear filters' in excel in office 365 for mac using the keyboard?\nOn PC I can do alt+d,f,s\nor using the mouse I can go to Data > Filter > Clear\n\nA: The keyboard shortcut is Alt C A\n", "Q: Delete cached (offline) email on hard drive in Mail program (El Capitan) How can I delete all cached/offline email from the Mac OS 'Mail' program on my SSD in Mac OS El Capitan?

Basically, I just want the mail accounts to sync to the IMAP/Exchange email servers via the internet and never rely on any local storage. This is a hardwired Mac Mini, so it's never offline. Thanks. \n\nA: You can find Mail's cached mails in\n~/Library/Mail\n\nTo see how much space this folder is using, either use Finder's Get Info or\ndu -hs ~/Library/Mail\n\nTo remove the folder and all its contents, either use Finder or\nrm -rf ~/Library/Mail\n\n\nAFAIK, I don't think you can stop Mail from caching received emails from your servers. There used to be an option in Mail preferences that would stop it from caching everything, but I think this was taken out in Mavericks. \nWith Mail's behavior as such, it is logical to assume that once these mails are deleted, Mail will re-sync with the necessary servers to cache these mails again.\nYou might be able to change some things in Mail's preferences, I'll check and edit appropriately.\nThere's a pretty good guide on Mail and its storage usage over at HowToGeek right here.\n", "Q: rMBP random unexpected shutdown Recently I'm facing random unexpected shutdown on rMBP mid-2014.

However, I'm afraid that upgrading would break the ability to dual boot.\nHow can I proceed safely with the upgrade?\n\nA: In theory, it shouldn't matter, when you install OS X El Capitan, you can select the partition you want the operating system to install on, which surprisingly, you can even select a USB. If you are extremely concerned with interfering with another disk, then make a bootable USB. Follow the instructions from the Apple official website. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372 There are many Youtube videos on how to do that too.\nAfter you finish making the bootable USB. Shut your computer down. Plug the USB into one of the USB ports, start your computer while holding down the option key, and it will bring you a list of bootable disks. Select the \"Install El Capitan\" (or a name that is similar to this) disk, which should also appear as a USB icon instead of a hard disk icon, and it will lead you to the installation. Make sure you select the Macintosh HD hard disk as the disk you want to install OS X El Capitan on, and it shouldn't interfere with your Linux system.

Is that the case?\nHow much quality loss is there when editing photos in the native iOS app?\n\nA: Yes, that is the case. When you edit a JPEG photo and save the result as a JPEG image, it will be re-encoded and thus you'll suffer some loss of quality. The only way to avoid that is to save the photo in a lossless format (for example RAW). You cannot do that with the built-in Photos app.\nYou can find other apps that allow you to save both the original photo and edits in better quality - like for example PureShot and others. Even though the resolution is the same, different apps have different quality settings in regards to how much JPEG compression is applied.\nNote that even though the original photo has low compression (and high quality), just editing it in the native Photos apps will save a new JPEG with higher compression and lower quality. For example read this article where they loaded a 5.59 MB photo, applied an edit and saved - and got a 1.49 MB photo out of the native app:\nEditing App Comparison\nAnother factor when comparing editing apps is to ensure that they perform all your edits against the original photo before exporting a new JPEG. If they create a new JPEG for each edit and use that as the source for the next edit, you'll experience the quality degradation multiple times.\n", "Q: Apple Music charges card or available balance? I am subscribed to Apple Music, and I also have a store credit from gift cards.\nWill my monthly subscription subtract from my store credit or charge my credit card?\n\nA: In my personal experience, store credit will be used until it is gone, and then the credit card on file will be charged.\n", "Q: Notes app search is not finding some notes I am using my notes app on OSX 10.11.5 and iOS 8. For the most part, things are working, but I am noticing that many of my older notes are not searchable. When I type something in the search box, these older notes do not appear in search results even if there is a match. However, if I edit a note or create a new one, it is fully searchable.\nMy guess is that somehow the search indexes for my notes got corrupted. Is there any way to fix this or rebuild the indexes?\n\nA: If your notes are in iCloud, make a local backup. Then in iCloud settings uncheck Notes. Your Notes will all be removed. Now turn Notes back on. They should all return and this force an index rebuild.\n\nA: Notes are stored in under Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes in your user folder. You can force just the notes to be reindexed by Spotlight using the following command in the Terminal:\nmdimport ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes\n\nTested on macOS 10.11.\n\nA: You should try reindexing spotlight on your mac.\nIn terminal type sudo mdutil -E / and you will be prompted for your password, this can take some time though depending on your drive speed\n\nA: I got this when I tried the mdutil:\n$ sudo mdutil -E /\nPassword:\n/:\n    Error: unknown indexing state.\n\nExecuting the following, reenabled indexing and search through Apple Notes was resolved:\n$ sudo mdutil -E -v -i on /\nPassword:\n/:\n    Indexing enabled. \n    Scan base time: 2017-05-03 01:14:49 +0000 (2051798 seconds ago), reasoning: 'ScanShadow'\n\n\nA: Much quicker way of fixing this is just to make a new iCloud notes folder, move all your notes into that and back again. This seems to rebuild the index- you can then get rid of the new folder. \nThis is useful if like me you don't have a quick option to back up your notes separately. \n\nA: For me \nsudo mdutil -E -v -i on /\n\nnot working then I have to Logout and Sign in again. it's fine now.\n\nA: It appears to reindex when you view a note.  I just clicked on my first note and used the down arrow to iterate through all my notes.\n", "Q: Sync itunes media folder with library I'm embarrassed to admit I don't understand how iTunes works despite having a mac for 6 years. How can I clean out my music folder (iTunes media) and then get iTunes to update? I've made substantial changes, so I don't mind just reloading the library if that's what I should do.\nAlso, I have a \"music\" folder which is not organized at all and doesn't seem to be affected by me deleting files in the iTunes media folder. Are these just copies of the songs in the iTunes media folder? Can I delete them? \nThank you for your help, and I apologize if the answer to this question is glaringly obvious.\n\nA: For every song the you import into iTunes, a copy will be made in your iTunes Media folder. If you want to delete a song from iTunes, I would suggest you do it by right clicking on the song and hit delete. Then it will let you decide if you want to remove the referente to that song in iTunes or move the file (the one in iTunes Media, not your music folder) to trash.\nIf you need to open a different library or reload one, make sure iTunes is closed and click on the icon while holding the option button on your keyboard and then navigate to your iTunes Media folder\n", "Q: iPhone 4s Power Cable Compatibility Can I use an iPhone 4s power cable to charge any other mobile device?\nDo any other mobile devices have a power connector similar to the iPhone 4s?\n\nA: \nCan I use an iPhone 4s power cable to charge any other mobile device?\n\nShort answer...YES you can\nThe cable is Apple's (legacy) 30 pin connector.\n\nThis cable is compatible with \n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 3G through 4s\n\n*iPad 1st through 3rd Generation\n\n*iPod (various generations)\n\n\nApple has a complete and official list of supported devices on their product page: Apple 30-pin to USB Cable\n\nA: I'm not sure what you are asking, especially with your lack of effort in formatting.\nThe iPhone 4 uses the 30 pin dock connector so devices such as iPhone (1st generation), iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, 1st through 4th generation iPod Touch, iPad 1, iPad 2, and iPad 3 will support it.\nUnless you have a fake (clone) device that also utilises the 30 pin dock connector.\n", "Q: Archived mail keeps reappearing in Inbox on OS X I have a problem with Mail in OS X El Capitan (10.11.5).\nIf I archive messages from my Inbox, go to another folder, then back to my Inbox, the messages are there again.\nQuitting mail and starting it again doesn't solve this..\nI rebuilt the mail database by deleting the Envelope Index files from /Users//Library/Mail/V3/MailData/, but that didn't solve the problem either.\nAny suggestions?\nThanks, Richard\nps I know there's a comparable thread on this forum, but it's specifically about Mail on the iPhone and Gmail.\n\nA: \nArchived mail keeps reappearing in Inbox …\n\nSmells of a database inconsistency. \n\nI rebuilt the mail database by deleting the Envelope Index files from /Users//Library/Mail/V3/MailData/\n\nCritically: \n\n\n*\n\n*did you quit Mail – and allow time for completion of that quit – before those deletions? \n\n\nSome of the many articles about Envelope Index lack that recommendation.

What I did was selected other resume type (modern resume) that had the body already in the left. Also there you can further reduce the margin all the way to the edge. Then I copied the bits that i needed from business resume over it. Kind of a hack but it works.\n\nA: Just open a new file using \"blank\" and copy the whole column over. IT's bloody wasting my time trying to figure out how to change the column width.\n\nA: Click on \"Document\" menu item at top right, then \"Document\" in the right tab view, then you can control the placement under \"Document margins\" at the bottom.\n", "Q: No sound when making calls with iPhone 6 I'm using iPhone 6. Sometimes when I answer a phone call, there's no sound. Only when I answer again or call back can I hear the voice. Does anyone else have the same problem? Do you know the reason?\n\nA: This is not so common but it has happened to all of us.  It's usually due to a glitch in the cellular communication which can happen at any signal strength. It's of course possible that the person on the other end of the phone hit their mute button too.  In any case if you are not able to reliably repeat the problem then it is due to some random occurrences in the cellular network and not anything within your control. \n\nA: Additionally, check to see if your network uses wifi calling. I've noticed a slight to moderate delay when it uses wifi voip when on a supported network. Especially at home. It is a godsend though as my cell service is bad there but internet is fast. \n", "Q: iOS version distribution of my own app Apple publishes the iOS version distribution across all devices:\n\nIs there a way to see the iOS version distribution for a given app that I have published? \n\nA: In iTunes Connect Analytics, select your app and go to Metrics → Active Devices or Sessions and choose View By → Platform Version. This will give you a breakdown of the iOS version installed per the category you selected.\nKeep in mind this data only began reporting in iOS 8 and is opt-in only.

Then I can (for example) press F2 to rename it.\nWhen I copy and paste a file in OS X, the last inserted file is NOT selected in the destination folder. When I want to rename it, I have to look for it, select it and press Enter.\nIs there a setting (or a shortcut) in OS X to select (or highlight) the last inserted file(s)?\n\nA: If you don't have a current selection, the Paste action will select the new pasted file or folder. Therefore, make sure you don't have a current selection when pasting and the file or folder will be selected when you paste.\nA quick way to deselect any currently selected items before pasting is ⌥⌘A. If you'd like more automation in this, you can use Keyboard Maestro or equivalent to intercept a ⌘V and press ⌥⌘A first if you wish this to occur every time you paste.\n                  \n                  \nThis answer applies to OS X 10.11.5 and I have also tested it in OS X 10.11.6b1.\n\nA: I have a walk-around solution of this problem by using the BetterTouchTool. You can assign a sequence of actions to one Shortcut, such as Control-V (in the following snapshot), which can trigger a series of actions involving deselection, paste, sorted by added date, and highlight the upper most item.\n\n\nA: I'll probably be down voted in this answer, but I tried in my El Capitan as the OP described and it never ends selected, it does not work as Windows. As long I still think somethings are still easier in Windows, an O.S. it's about a culture, the usability solution, and may be a better idea dance as the music is playing. The best way to do this task is by OS X way, after paste the file, to click on it and click again (not double click, just click wait click) to edit the filename. The Mac OS X is an interface that has a lot of the old classic O.S. that was made for mouse, not keyboard, unlike the Windows that has a lot of DOS still in the \"blood\".\nPersonally, I work with two windows opened and drag-and-drop (alt to copy) as even Bill dreamed when he copied Apple's O.S..\n", "Q: Can't delete email from Junk/Trash folders Late last week I started noticing that I can't delete emails from either Junk or Trash folders in my Mail program. In addition the Mail program seems to run very slowly when sending emails and I cannot quit it and have to force quit.\nWhen deleting emails, I highlight as many as I want, select delete and they disappear from sight.  But when I return back to that folder they reappear.\nIn the console I am seeing messages like:\n5/31/16 6:43:42.849 AM Mail[1305]: Skipping STATUS for INBOX.Deleted Messages because CHECK failed with error: (null)\n5/31/16 6:43:42.851 AM Mail[1305]: Skipping STATUS for INBOX because CHECK failed with error: (null)\n5/31/16 6:43:42.853 AM Mail[1305]: Skipping STATUS for INBOX.Deleted Messages because CHECK failed with error: (null)\n5/31/16 6:43:42.854 AM Mail[1305]: Skipping STATUS for INBOX because CHECK failed with error: (null)\n5/31/16 6:44:01.659 AM Mail[1305]: Skipping STATUS for INBOX because CHECK failed with error: (null)\n5/31/16 6:44:01.840 AM Mail[1305]: Skipping STATUS for Trash because CHECK failed with error: (null)\n5/31/16 7:04:53.590 AM Mail[1305]: Failed to open emlx and partial.emlx files (/Users/jdmobile/Library/Mail/V3/IMAP-[Redacted]/INBOX.mbox/Junk.mbox/CF2FBDC0-75B0-42CD-8443-70E3612FF687/Data/4/4/Messages/44436.partial.emlx)\n\nIn addition at times I have seen the Mail program using up to 10% of CPU and currently my Mail program racked up 46 minutes of CPU time and is consuming 26 threads.\nCan anyone suggest what to start looking for?\nEdit \nBased on user6492's answer I really should add that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can receive email perfectly fine on my problem El Capitan Mac.\n\n*The email configuration for the IMAP account looks non-corrupted.\n\n*Using another Mac that has Mail configured for the same IMAP account, I can send/receive/delete email without any issue.  So the server side of the email equation has not changed. \n\n\nEdit 2\nNow it really gets weird for me.  It appears that I can delete emails if I do it one at a time or even a few at a time - not sure at what point it starts to fail to delete\nEdit 3\nI managed to delete lots of emails from both the Junk and Trash folders, however I am stuck with 16 messages that I can't delete from my Trash folder and 1 that I can't delete from my Spam folder. All of the messages are marked as being Spam, and when I right click on any of them and say they are not junk mail, they remain tagged as junk mail.\nI suspect that something down inside the Mail system is corrupt and not allowing these files to be deleted.\nEdit 4\nAfter a force quit I managed to manually delete all but one email.  But this is a strange one and I think the source of all of my problems as it shows in both the Trash and Junk mail folders at the same time.\n\nA: You seems to have an IMAP account, so Mail order server to delete those emails, but something goes wrong and the task is not completed. When Mail sincronizes with server again, those emails will show up again because were never actually deleted from server. You have to review the configurations of this account with your mail provider - probably request for a support. I'm afraid this is the first step. Chances are your configurations changed somehow (even some corrupted file) or the server were updated and your configurations are outdated.\n\nA: After poking around and deleting various emails and force quitting Mail various times I finally figured out a fix to my problem, but I don't know the \"Why\" of it all and will never know.\nI knew that there seemed to be one particular email that was causing trouble as it was the only one I could never deleted.  I even tried delving into the elmx files in the Mail folder and deleting the file there - but that didn't work.\nEventually I realized that I had to delete the email at its source.  So I logged into my IMAP account via its web portal, found the offending email and deleted it there.\nFrom that point on the Mail app has been responsive and I haven't had any issues with deleting unwanted emails.\nSo somehow this one email was malformed to the point that the Mail app could not deal with it, but still managed to cause a lot of problems. \n", "Q: OS X El Capitan won't work and is not recognized on UniBeast I have been trying to download the new version of El Capitan and use UniBeast to create a bootable USB.

To get location based reminders to work, are bluetooth and wifi required to be enabled or just bluetooth? \n\nA: For location-based reminders, you only need to have the GPS turned on.  Keeping wifi on helps with locations because it allows the device to pin-point where you're located.  Wifi is not required, however.\nBluetooth is not required for location reminders unless you're using iBeacons.  If you're using iBeacons then bluetooth is required.  \n\nA: No, just Location Services has to be turned on with Reminders having access to Location Services.\nMy geo-fenced Reminders work fine without WiFi nor Bluetooth (BT) turned on.\n\n", "Q: iPhone won't boot after installing higher capacity battery I wanted to upgrade my iPhone 5 to a higher capacity 2680mAh battery, but when I installed it the Apple flashes on and off and the phone will not turn on. I had to reinstall the old battery. Any solutions?\n\nA: You should only use the battery that's for your phone. The phone is not meant to take a higher wattage battery, so it will malfunction.\nTo put that into context, it's like trying to put a V8 engine into a hairdryer. It won't work.\n", "Q: How to delete Macbook from Find My iPhone without erasing data? I have an iCloud account and there are my phone and a macbook which not belongs to me. I removed it from Apple ID and settings in iCloud, but it is still in Find my iPhone. I only able to erase this macbook. Is there a way to just deatache it from my account without erasing data?\n\nA: In Find iPhone you should be able to tap on the device you want to remove. That will take you to the screen where you see the Erase option. \nAt the top-right of that screen is the option to Remove that device (see my iPad screenshot below). \n\nIf the Remove option doesn't appear immediately, give it a few minutes to show up. After tapping Remove you'll get a confirmation dialog box. Once you tap Agree the device will be removed. \n", "Q: How should I format a Micro SD card for Dropbox storage? I have been using a 128GB SanDisk Ultra Fit USB 3 device with my MacBook for a while now and have really grown to love having all of my Dropbox available without using up my SSD disk space.\nI've recently purchased a 128GB Micro SD card with an SD adapter in the hopes that I can free up a USB slot.\nI'm looking for recommendations as to which type of filesystem formatting I should use. I started out with exFAT and felt like it was a little sluggish, so I switched it to OSX Extended (non-Journaled) and I'm not seeing much of a difference.\nFrom what I could find, some people said that using Journaled with a Micro SD card might cause too many writes and could wear out the life of the Micro SD card.\nIn my case, I'm primarily using Dropbox for file storage and some app usage. I use it with 1Password, but don't do a lot of heavy operations like working directly on Photoshop files.\nEDIT: Here are the specs:\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-Inch, Late 2013)\n2.4GHz Intel Core i5\n4GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n128GB SSD  \nMicroSD Card:\nPNY 128GB High Speed MicroSDXC Memory Card (P-SDUX128U160G-GE) \nMicroSD to SD Adapter:\nBASEQI aluminum microSD Adapter for MacBook Pro Retina 13\"\n\nA: Your card seems sluggish because it is.\nYour particular PNY SD card is rated at up to 60MB/s (megabytes per second) data transfer rate; which is approximately .5Gb/s (gigabits per second)\nIn comparison, your SanDisk has a read speed of 150MB/s or 1.2Gb/s (SanDisk does not provide a write speed).\nBasically, you swapped out a storage medium for another that, out of the gate is at best, less than 1/2 the speed than what you had originally.  There is no filesystem that is going to make up that difference.\nFor reference USB 3.0 is rated at 5Gb/s which is equivalent to 625MB/s.\nFormat Types\n\"Using it with DropBox\" doesn't have any effect on the file system type you choose to use as DropBox's functionality and performance has nothing to do with where your OS writes its files to.  So, the question becomes, which one is is right for you?\n\n\n*\n\n*Use ExFAT if you plan to go between OSes like Windows and Linux\n\n*Use HFS+ if you plan on only working on OS X and like all the extras you get with HFS+\n\n\nIf you really want (need) Speed\nGet an external drive that takes full advantage of USB 3 speeds (up to 5Gb/s) like the WD Passport for Mac or go for a Thunderbolt Drive that will go 10Gb/s\n\nA: If the SD card seems sluggish, you can try purchasing the \"extreme\" edition of the SD cards that are rated for professional photographers that need quick writes for RAW photos in fast succession. It costs more, but you get better performance. \nThe alternative is to wait for Dropbox to release a version that will have placeholders for files stored on the cloud only. The started in May 2016 and I am hoping it will be released soon. This doesn't increase your overall storage, but does allow you to have Dropbox on the SSD and temporarily work with files and release them once you don't need them without having an SD card.\n", "Q: date command gives no output I made an alias earlier today that I saved in my .bash_profile. The alias was called date. I had momentarily forgotten that date is already a native command on OS X (and Linux) in /bin. I removed the alias that I had saved, but now, to use the date command, I have to type /bin/date instead of just date. How can I fix this?\n\nA: Firstly, check your $PATH (run echo $PATH)\nIf /bin isn't there, then run export PATH=/bin:$PATH\nAfter that run which date and you should see /bin/date\nIf you still don't have any output, check if date isn't alias (run alias date)\nIt should say bash: alias: date: not found.  \nBut in your case it may be alias date='some-command'\nIf it is, run unalias date and it should fix the problem.\nThanks Allan for the comments with answer.\n", "Q: Why are many songs just not played in iTunes in Apple Music? How to force them to be played? I've installed iTunes on PC and have registered with Apple Music. I've started playing an album. But most of the songs are just not being played. Only one-three songs for an album are playable. What kind of issue with iTunes/Apple/Apple Music is that? How to force iTunes to play them?\nHere are screenshots of the difference.\n\n\n*\n\n*A song that is playable has a grey color slider:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Songs that iTunes doesn't play have blue color slider. iTunes just freezes on those songs and never goes to the the next song in an album:\n\n\n\nAnd no any hints except these about why Apple Music doesn't play songs.\nSimilar questions:\niTunes - Apple Music - songs are not playing\nWhy can't some songs be played with Music?\n\nA: Apple Discussion has a similar question.\nThey suggest that you change your DNS. Try using the Google Public DNS. \nI would also suggest you to restart your router once. \n", "Q: Repairing permissions twice gives the same result If I repair permissions twice in a row, without launching any apps or processes while I do this, the results are almost the same:\n\nWhy is it that the second time around, the problems seem to be encountered again?\n\nA: The errors with Safari are because -rwxr-xr-x should be lrwxr-xr-x where the l indicates symbolic link. I'm not sure how this is something to 'fix' from a permissions point of view as either something's a symbolic link or it's not. Repair Permissions has been removed in El Capitan so support for it with updated versions of Safari is likely to be overlooked.\nThe error about the InstalledPrinters.plist looks like a normal permissions discrepancy and I don't know why it wasn't repaired. The printer daemons may be resetting this.\nIt's normal for the ARDAgent error to be shown, as the error is included in this list by Apple of messages to ignore.\n", "Q: Does Safari's history eventually get deleted? I recently came across a folder in my computer called \"History\" with over 30 000 (!!) files. It seems that Safari was collecting a copy of every website I visit (probably to display it in the \"history\" menu...).\n\nWould this folder keep on growing if I didn't see it and delete its contents?\nWhat is the best way to clean it?\n\nA: Your history is cleared automatically per your setting in (Safari) Preferences → General:\n\nTo clear your history manually, go to Safari → Clear History….\n                              \n", "Q: checking path capitalization of pwd Is there a quick way to check in terminal that the terminal command pwd returns the correct capitalization of the path?\nNote that if you do cd ~/desktop then pwd would tell you that your path is /Users/foo/desktop rather than the correct /Users/foo/Desktop.\nEDIT: Motivation: build systems need a way to check this early on, otherwise it's really hard to debug. An unsuspecting user uses a wrong capitalisation, starts a build, gets errors that are very puzzling.\nEDIT2: Silently accepting incorrectly capitalised input for cd is the standard behaviour of bash on an HFS+ file system, and thus for the vast majority of OSX users. Then, pwd is a bash builtin, and it simply takes the content of the path stack of the shell (typos included).\n\nA: Use /bin/pwd\ncd ~/desktop\n/bin/pwd -P\n\n", "Q: Recover a deleted contact without iCloud backups When I was deleting contacts on my iPhone yesterday, I mistakenly deleted another one with similar name! Any idea how to get it back? I don't have any backups to iCloud.\n\nA: Follow this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logon to iCloud.com\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*At the bottom left you will see Advanced and \"Restore Contacts\"\n\n\nFrom there you will be able to restore a previous backup that iCloud has done.\n", "Q: Reset USB bus without reboot (MacBook ignores display) I have a MacBook Pro and work with different external monitors. The monitors have a keyboard and a mouse attached. Frequently the MacBook does not recognize the USB devices in the display and the keyboard and mouse do not function. I have to reboot. Is there a way to reset the USB system without rebooting?\n\nA: You could try restarting the usb daemon in terminal. Like so:\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.usbd; sudo launchctl start com.apple.usbd\n\n\nA: Same problem here, it happens with a thunderbolt Apple display, and a thunderbolt LG display, and it's sometimes fixed after connecting/reconnecting/changing USB ports for the keyboard. On the LG even that did not work, only a complete reboot. I'm googling now for a USB reset solution that does not reboot my Mac.\nFound this tool here: http://v6download.touch-base.com/downloads/MacProber/USB_Prober_Mac_OS_X_10.7.3.zip.

I will keep this handy on my desktop in case it happens again.\n", "Q: Rootless custom scheduling of Time Machine backups It has been asked how to customize the backup schedule of Time Machine, but the solutions in the answers only seem to work in releases of OS X that weren’t “rootless”, i.e. before 10.11 El Capitan (or was it 10.10 already?). The recommended tool Time Machine Scheduler also doesn’t seem to have been updated since 2013.\nIs there a solution to adjust the backup intervals for current (2015+) versions of OS X?\n\nA: You can use any of the existing solutions from the existing question Custom Scheduling of Time Machine backups by disabling System Integrity Protection first using csrutil disable in Terminal from the Recovery HD. Once the changes have been made, you can re-enable SIP by running the same command but using ‘enable’ in the place of ‘disable’, also from Terminal in the Recovery HD.\n", "Q: Apple Watch charger not charging I have an Apple Watch Sport. Today I tried using a car port to charge my Watch. However, it does not work. I used the same charger and port yesterday and it worked fine. Why is my Apple Watch not charging?\n\nA: You have to do some basic trouble shooting.  You have two components to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*The 12v power port in your car\n\n*The charger\n\n\nPlug your charger into the power port of a different car with a power port you know to be good.  If your charger works, then the problem is related to your car.  If it dosen't work, then your charger is at fault.\nAlternatively, you can plug a known working charger into your car.  If it works there as well, it's your charger.  If it doesn't, it's your car.  \n\nA: I found it easiest to make this flowchart myself:\n\n", "Q: Changing default email reader does not take effect I am trying to use Kiwi for Gmail as my default email reader (for example, when wanting to share a link via email, I want Kiwi to open up, rather than the Mail application by Apple).\nIn the Kiwi preferences, it says to use the application Mail to change the default email client:\n\nSo, in Mail > Preferences, I have set Kiwi as the default email reader:\n\nHowever, the problem is that, after closing Mail, Kiwi is not the default client., despite I changed it before. In fact, if I reopen Mail, Mail is still set as default email reader. It seems like changing the default email reader doesn't take effect, when closing Mail.\nCan anyone help me to fix the issue?\n\nA: I had this problem too, when trying to set Airmail.app as my default email client.  I found a solution (after many failed attempts) here:\nhttp://docs.airmailapp.com/airmail-for-mac/setting-airmail-as-the-default-email-client-airmail-for-macos\nAll credit goes to the author of that article, and the instructions should apply for any email client, not just Airmail.\nThe key is to reset Apple's LaunchServices database before opening Mail.app.  Here are the instructions from the above-linked site (slightly modified):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (Cmd+Space Bar and enter Terminal)\n\n*Copy & paste this command:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -all local,system,user\n\n\n*Press Return to submit the above command and wait for it to finish (might take a few moments)\n\n*Open Mail.app and set your default email reader\nThis worked for me.  I noticed though that, when right-clicking a file in Finder and choosing \"Open With\", the menu was very slow to be populated with a list of apps (note that the LaunchServices database also controls this list).  So I restarted my computer and everything was fine.\n", "Q: First Aid Fails on External Disk, what can I do from here? History:   Running an iMac late 2011 and updated the OS to Yosemite when the computer stopped booting. I have a history of killing HDD so I figured it was a bad HDD and I went to change the drive. Before I changed the drive I wanted to try and recover some of the files and using my Macbook I set the iMac in Targeted disk mode and I was able to access the drive and copy some of the files. Due to the length go time it took I shut down the computer and tried to pick up where I left off on the next day. This time target disk mode did not work. Since I had copied most of the important stuff I decided to change the drive and try and clone the the drive if it would spin up. \nI extracted the 1TB drive and cloned it using a disk duplicator. I plugged the Dock into the Macbook and Both HDD would spin and Disk Utility acknowledged their presence but would not mount either drive. \n    I figured it may be a conflict because they were clones and I shut down and removed one of the drives Drive 1 (Original iMac drive) Using a program called DriveDX I can monitor the overall health of the drive. Drive 2 is Status OK and GOD overall Health and GOOD performance rating. I tested Drive 1 and got similar results. I also ran self test with good results.\n    I ran the First Aid on both Drive 1 and 2(Disk Utility) Both drives resulted in the same message:\n\"First Aid process has failed. If possible back up the data on this volume.

Skip to the bottom and it says:\nChecking extended attributes file.\nInvalid node structure\nThe volume Macintosh HD could not be verified completely.\nFile system check exit code 8.\nUpdating boot support partitions for the volume as required.\nFile system verify or repair failed.\nOperation failed...\n\nFrom what I can tell the overall health of Drive 1 and 2 are good they both spin freely but neither will mount to the computer which appears to be a file structure issue??  How can I repair the drive or can I recover the drive all? I am not willing to spend $$$ on Data recovery because I was able to get most of the important stuff off the drive when I had it in Target disk mode. At this point I am just puzzled by the failure in the first place and would like to try and understand what happened and how to fix it.\n\nA: Invalid node structure is bad news. You should backup as much data as possible then try repartitioning the drive using Disk Utility. \nIf the repartition fails or the same issues crop up again it'll be time to replace that hard drive. \n\nA: The fact of not mounting a volume from a HDD might related to other issues as hardware problems (talking by self experience). The alternative of spending in third part software is to use a third disk to save data and format the disks again. I think you should use it to save your data and go deep by this steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your hardware is ok by testing with another HDD verified. In my case, Disk Utility found 1TB in a 120GB SSD.\n\n*Make sure your HDD is physically ok by checking SMART status (in the bottom of the Disk Tools window when you click in the disk).\n\n*Format your disk again but making new partition schema, not only erasing it, remember that the scheme must be GUID in order to be bootable.\n\n\nBy copying back the data you save in the third disk, you are already will be testing it again. No problems should appears in the test you do just after the copy.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create something like a requirements file for homebrew? Python (and other languages) can use a requirements file to specify a list of packages to install.\nIs it possible to use a requirements file for homebrew?\n\nA: You should have a look at brew bundle, which installs as a subcommand of brew. It can install and update packages, taps, and casks specified in a Brewfile. You can also dump your current Homebrew environment into a new Brewfile or uninstall everything not listed.\n", "Q: Loading photos onto Windows PC with broken iPhone touchscreen I've cracked my iPhone 5 and the touch screen no longer works. Is there any way I can load my photos onto my laptop without getting the screen fixed?  \nMy computer runs the latest Windows and its a ThinkPad if this helps.\n\nA: Here's a way to transfer photos to your computer (Windows 8 and above)\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to a trusted computer using the lightning cable. It is important that the computer is trusted. iPhones do not connect to the computer otherwise. \n\n*The Photos app should automatically open. If it does not, you can open it using the Windows start menu or search bar. \n\n*Click on the import button in the top right corner, represented by a downwards arrow in a square box. \n\n*Select the photos you would like to import. \n\n*Follow the prompts on the screen.

I have checked Activity Monitor and there are no applications taking up significant Memory or CPU power. The heat is concentrated on the upper left corner of the body, around the power inlet. I have noticed some bending of the body in the same area. Having had a swollen battery before I suspected the same thing might be happening again (as sometimes—though very rarely—the battery is not recognized). However, the location of the battery is not the location of the deformation.\nWhat could be the cause of all this and how could I try to reduce the heat and (if there is a connection) reduce further deformation?\nEDIT: Here's a picture of the area affected by the mysterious deformation\n\nEDIT: Here are some temperature measurements I have made (in degrees C):\n\n\n*\n\n*5V/3.3V Proximity: 51\n\n*Battery TS1: 37\n\n*Battery TS2: 37\n\n*Battery TS_MAX: 37\n\n*CPU Die: 64\n\n*CPU Die - Digital Core: 62\n\n*CPU Die - Digital Core 0: 68\n\n*CPU Die - Digital Core 1: 68\n\n*CPU Proximity: 61\n\n*Palm Rest: 36\n\n*PCH-Thunderbold Proximity: 72 (!)\n\n*Right Fin Stack Proximity: 51\n\n\nWhile I realise that none of these are high enough to do damage to the hardware, the surface is already painful to the touch although the device is basically idle or performing very basic tasks, such as browsing simple web-pages. Average CPU load was around 10% during this measurement while memory was at around 50%. The measurement of 72 degrees (C) around the thunderbolt port confirms my observation that the upper left corner is particularly hot; though I don't know what parts are located there that could cause such heat. I think that the heat originates from this area and the fans only turn on once it has warmed up the entire device. Note also that the heating up occurs whether I am charging the device or not.\n\nA: There's nothing significant that could cause your Late 2011 MBP to swell in that area. In fact, that area has a fan mounted there, which makes it quite unlikely that something could get hot enough to cause frame damage. \nMy speculation:\nIf you've had swelling in the past then your frame is probably still bent from the swelling of the first battery. The initial heat and pressure could have caused the logic board to press against an opposite end. Furthermore, the heat damage could have created soft areas of aluminum that are slowly being modified by the heating and cooling caused by charging.\nHere is the parts breakdown for curiosity sake.\n", "Q: iPad getting annoyed by upgrade requests I have an original iPad. I cannot upgrade it anymore because the newer OS's do not work with an original iPad.\nUnfortunately, I get incessant upgrade notifications.\nIs there any way to turn these off?\n\nA: As mentioned in the comments, your iPad (MC764LL/A) is an iPad 2, and not the original iPad as mentioned. \nThe latest version of iOS on your iPad is iOS 9.3.2. Since you are using iOS 9.1, you will get an update notification. You could, however, choose to ignore it. \nI would suggest you install the new OS. \nTo answer your question: No, you cannot turn off the notification for an iOS software update. \n", "Q: Is it possible to bounce or redirect an email using Outlook 2016 for Mac or OWA? Is there a way to replicate an email bounce / redirect using Office 365 hosted email using either the OWA web app or Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac?\nBasically, some subset of emails that get sent to me need to be sent to another distribution list. I want to be able to automate sending some of my mail (but not all of it) to another address. When outlook forwards the message, it's now from me instead of from the sender which messes up replies and actions based on who sent the mail.\nEudora used to tack on \"via person who redirected\" to the subject line and Apple's Mail app has a Redirect menu option that is disabled when connected to Office365 mail servers so I'm guessing this might be a configuration issue or banned by Outlook entirely.\nIs there any sort of rule or workaround that would enable me to redirect some messages when needed?\n\nA: You should be able to create a rule in the Outlook 2016 for the Mac.  In Outlook's menu select\nTools --> Rules\n\nUse the + button near the bottom of the pop-up to add a new rule.  Give the rule a name (Shunt-Foo-List-To-Bar-List).  For the condition, select something that will uniquely identify the message that needs to be bounced.  This could be the To: address if messages to the list are consistently addressed to the list's address, or if the list uses a [tag] in the subject line you could match on that instead.  Then under Do the following:, select  Redirect To and set the address where you want it to go.\nThere are times I would like to be able to interactively redirect an individual message to a different address, but I've yet to find a way to do this in Mac/Outlook.  But at least this works for cases you can easily identify ahead of time.\n", "Q: Power Up Issues with MacBook Pro A1278 First-off, let me preface this question by stating that I know nothing to very little about computers, especially Apple computers. That being said, I have a MacBook Pro A1278 model. About a month ago, smoke started coming out of the top row of keys on the keyboard (not good at all - that much I do know); so, I powered it down. Then it would not power up at all. This morning, I tried plugging in the adapter and, lo and behold, it started to fire up. However, the progress bar only moves about a third of the way across before it shuts down again. It does this whether or not the adapter is plugged in or not, so I am thinking that it is not the adapter or the battery. If I continue to hold down the power button, it was going into my Desktop. However, as soon as I release it, within about 2 seconds, it shuts down again. Also, now when I continue to hold the power button down, it only makes it about halfway and then shuts off again. \nCould it be my power supply? something else? Any advice would be greatly appreciated as it is a work computer. Thanks. \n\nA: The smoke coming out of your Macbook would lead anyone to conclude that the problem system had either an:\n\n\n*\n\n*Overheating battery (common on some model MBP's) \n\n*Overheating CPU (not at all common unless there is a blockage or other external heat.)\n\n\nAs others have suggested, it is definitely time for you to triage and rescue whatever remains on the HDD and take it to the Apple Store for a further diagnosis. Here are some things you can do in the meantime\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify if the battery is the problem. Take a careful look at the chassis of the aluminum unibody. Does it seem swollen in some areas? If you use one finger to press on an edge of the MBP, does it rock? Swollen batteries are a common indicator of battery malfunction.\n\n*If the battery is removable from the bottom of the MBP, go ahead and remove it. Attach the AC adapter and power on your MBP without the battery installed. This should mitigate your device from turning off because of the heat from a malfunctioning battery. Other things you can do is place your device on a cool, dry kitchen counter while running it without the battery. This will further allow you to use the computer without risk of running into the CPU thermal throttling timer (simple function: too hot -> turn off). \n\n*Lastly, if the above tip worked, immediately move your HDD contents to a backup location. \n\n\nPlease report back on your findings and mark answered if this helps.\n", "Q: To Rescue Nonbooting OS X with Grub?

I can open them using VLC but I can't open them in QuickTime and Adobe Premiere - what could be wrong? Maybe I need some codecs? \n\nA: Here's what Google says:\n\nAccording to the info in Apple official site, QuickTime does support MOV files. However, MOV is a multimedia container file that contains one or more tracks, each of which stores a particular type of data: audio, video, effects, or text (e.g. for subtitles).\n\nSo it could be possible that a part of the .mov file may not be supported by the QuickTime player. In this case, I would suggest you to convert the file to a .mp4 or a QuickTime compatible .mov format using a third party application. \n\nA: Are you using the latest version of QT? If not, install the latest version. \nMOV is a file container format. Your mov file can be encoded with different types of codecs that may be incompatible with QT.

(like doing Spotlight search but for windows)\nI frequently have many windows open, and CMD-Tab & friends, and graphical utilities like Witch really don't cut it. \nI am looking for something analogous to the Emacs iswitch.\nhttps://github.com/nate-parrott/Flashlight apparently used to do this (and much more) in prior versions of OSX. \n\nA: I tried grgarside's solution but his link timed out for me.\nEnded up on Packal and found Swift Window Switcher\nIt only requires you to use it w name instead of window name and it also populates with Safari tabs. It, too, requires Accessibility permissions.\nStill requires Alfred, which is paid, but it seems like the best solution I could find.\n\n\nA: I implemented this functionality in a spoon for Hammerspoon. Fully open-source:\nhttps://github.com/dmgerman/hs_select_window.spoon\nType the hotkey, then it will show you a list of all windows (except current), either in general or in the current application (one command each).\nYou can then select the window by typing a substring of the title or application and/or using arrows (or Ctrl+P, Ctrl+N)\nIt even works across workspaces and with full-screen windows.\n\nA: I was (am) looking for a simple, one-trick, open source solution. Still looking.\nBut I did find a closed-source app that does what I need: allows me to switch between windows by typing any part(s) of app and/or window name:\nhttps://contexts.co/\nNot free. Not open source, has to be allowed to \"control your computer\" via Accessibility features. \nI also tried Alfred; it cannot do this out of the box (but a workflow could probably be created).\n\nA: Switch window by name\nAlfred workflow to switch to a window by the name of the window title. Uses Alfred's adaptive searching engine to make filtering really quick as it learns which windows you usually switch to.\nUsage: window <search window titles>\nYou need to add Alfred to the list of apps allowed to control your computer in System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Accessibility. If you don't, it fails silently.\n\nDownload: https://georgegarside.com/resources/SwitchWindowByName.alfredworkflow\nOne day, I'll have a proper webpage for these workflows. Apologies for the direct download.\nI did have it loading icons for the apps, but defaults takes too long to get the app icon.

Have confirmed on iPhone and Gmail website that for whatever reason, these emails are gone -- they don't show up in \"All Mail\" and they aren't int the trash.\nCompounding that, although his TimeMachine backup has been running, when I go to restore for him, there are two problems preventing him from actually restoring anything. \n1) when choosing a date/time on the timeline, although the email count changes, the screen doesn't animate\n2) the Restore button never becomes active\nIf I try to restore something in a Finder folder, TimeMachine restore works fine.\nHas something changed in El Capitan that prevents email from being restored? perhaps due to it being a Gmail or IMAP account?\nRunning Mac OS X 10.11.4\n\nA: If it is an IMAP account (don't know if GMAIL accepts POP3) I'm afraid the Time Machine is useless because those mails were not in the local storage - your HDD or SDD, so there is no way Time Machine keep it in backup files. This emails was in a remote Google server and you will have to try their recovery tools.\nUsually, the server will keep the deleted messages for a while, even not showing in the trash. This is good place to start: Google Support\n", "Q: Install El Capitan from usb drive I have 2 Macs (one MacBook Pro and one iMac). I made a copy of the installer on a USB drive and then installed El Capitan on MacBook Pro. Now I want to use the drive to install El Capitan on the iMac. How can I do it without losing my data on iMac?\n\nA: If you already have an older version of OS X installed on your iMac just go to the App Store, search for El Capitan and click install. It will update to the latest version and your data will stay on the iMac.\nIf you don't have an OS installed on the iMac, but have a Time Machine backup of your data, just boot from the El Capitan USB stick and do a fresh install. At the beginning of the process it will ask you if you want to transfer your old data from a Time Machine backup. Use that option and it will create a new OS X installation with your old data in place.\nIf you don't have any OS installed on the Mac (but still have data on it) and no external backup of your data, then you should first create such a backup to an external drive, then install El Capitan using the USB stick and then copy the data back from your external backup to your iMac.\nIf you have a copy of your data on your Macbook, you could also transfer everything using a direct connection cable between the iMac and the Macbook. Read here how to do it: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204350\n\nA: Always have a backup first. If you proceed, just know data loss is real (but not expected result). You can select the OSX installer from your desktop/Finder and install in place (be sure the USB is plugged in). Installing the OS this way will not overwrite your data. \n\nA: You just need to go to \"upgrade\" instead of \"install\" in the main installation window. Of course is highly recommended to backup your data before, if the upgrade fails, you will have to format and install (happened to me).\nAlso you can clone or backup with Time Machine, do a \"fresh install\" (formatting the HDD) and use the Migration Assistant to recover your personal data. \n", "Q: Why does my Magic Mouse 2 not work on OS X login screen?

Not for the first time, I'm adding an IMAP account to my iphone with over a year's worth of email in the Trash folder and my iPhone has deleted them all as the default setting is to purge emails over a week old. I am currently in the process of restoring them from backups.\nStrangely, I can't find anyone else complaining about this but it's not OK with me. Is there a way to stop this happening?\n\nA: To change the setting, go to Settings → Mail, Contacts, Calendars → iCloud → Mail (under Advanced) → Advanced → Remove (under Deleted Messages) and set the time period after which deleted messages are removed.\nYou should not expect anything deleted to persist at all. You have instructed for it to be deleted and this is what you should expect.\n\nA: Darren: Yes, the Default setting is 1 \nweek and you don't like it. So change it to Never. \nMy hubby accidentally deleted a Proposal. Bc his Mac techie set his iPad Mini up (a talented guy but my hubby refused to wait for me to use the Mac techie, an Apple Beta tester, who has been setting up all my devices for years). When I went to my own iPhone which my Mac Wizard synched with all my other 5 devices: 3 iPhones. 2 iPads, a Mac laptop and the desktop, the Wizard KNOWS to change those kinds of silly things Apple does, my own Mail Trash accounts are set to Never delete.\nBest of all, there's always AppleCare support if you invested in it as we always do for the maximum allowable period, a Senior Tech Advisor took over the call and case: Apple was able to RESTORE almost all of his Sent emails which had disappeared for no reason. He got back 97 of Proposals, spanning more than 1 year. The emailed Proposol was NOT among them but I knew enough about iOS to go into Advanced Settings to check on what was the time limit on Deleted emails. Sure enough, the techie he used left it in Default (Mac Wizard would have known my hubby's tech skills are poor and would have safeguarded us by changing the Delete settings to Never). My other devices are all set to Never after being in the Mac Wizard's hands for syncing a few months ago. If you call Apple in Cupertino, you usually get better service (fewer mistakes) than making a Genius Bar appointment. If you have a problem communicating with a particular CSR, politely hang up and call back for another one. With Apple, there is usually more than 1 way to solve any problem. One must simply exercise patience and courtesy. Best of luck. \n", "Q: Troubleshooting: Apple booting to Prohibitory Sign So my macbook pro (2012 Intel i5 6gb ram), has been starting up to the prohibitory sign. This sign will kinda sway back and forth between the apple symbol and the prohibitory sign. Every once in a while it will stick at the Apple Logo and turn on.\nI have reinstalled the OS, reset the NVRAM, and pretty much everything else I could think to check, including hardware diagnostic checks.\nI work as an IT and happened to have another Macbook pro of the same year and model laying around. When I switch the hard drives in the two computers both computers, both of them are able to boot up normally every time. (This confuses me). \nAny idea on the problem or other things to try??\nThanks\n\nA: Prohibitory symbol on a high level means the OS build you're trying to boot is not supported on the machine you're on. This can happen for many reasons, from an actual bad build being installed, to OS corruption, to bad HD. \nSince you said when you swap HDs with another MacBook, both are able to boot, is it possible that they got swapped somehow in the first place? In other words the one giving you the prohibitory symbol actually belongs in the OTHER MacBook? So when you swap them and everything magically works, you're just putting the hard drives in their appropriate Macs. \n", "Q: Unable to erase, reformat, or repartition USB drive This afternoon I attempted to mount a .iso of Windows 7 to a bootable USB drive.

I have learned, through search and experiment, that the \"3\" case can be improved to \"2\" by ensuring that the account password matches that of the keychain item which is (also) named \"login.\"  So far, so good.\nI tried essentially the same trick to eliminate the second login: I made the FileVault 2 credentials match the account credentials. On one computer, this worked: I can now log in to this computer via a single typing of credentials. But on another computer, this did not work: all credentials are the same, yet it takes two logins to get in.\nI believe OS X normally keeps all these credentials in sync, so the fact that they were out of sync to begin with may be significant. Unfortunately, in considering the computer that works as I want, it is impractical to recover the history of how it got there, due to limited expertise of the owner.\n\nA: This is pretty simple.\nIn System Preferences \n\n\n*\n\n*go to the Users & Groups Preference Pane\n\n*click on Login Options\n\n*click to unlock (bottom left) if needed and authenticate\n\n*verify Automatic Log in is on the user you wish to use\n\n*go to the Security & Privacy preference Pane\n\n*enable your user for FileVault\n\n*reboot\n\n\nYou will select your user from the picker and then enter your password one time and then you should be logged in. If you have a bad user, you can add a new admin user, let it unlock FileVault - remove the problematic user but do not delete the home folder. Then rename the /Users/whatever (deleted) to be the short name you wish and re-create the user. Be sure the keychain is unlocked when that new user password is set up when you log in. Authenticate the new user to FileVault and remove the \"new admin\" user from above.\n", "Q: How do I assess how \"normal\" my battery is? OS X assesses my battery as \"normal\" under System Information > Power.\nI understand that at some point this is going to change to some kind of \"we recommend you replace the battery\" message.\nI am wondering if I can see this coming.\nCoconut battery reports that 'current capacity' / 'design capacity' is 96%.\n\nIs this number the way that OS X itself determines whether the battery is still \"normal\"? If yes, what is the threshold at which the battery will be deemed abnormal?\n\nA: Yes, you are going about this the right way to determine your battery's remaining capacity and life. \nWhen a battery reaches over 1000 charge cycles, it is considered \"consumed\", aka it's lived out the expected life cycle and any degradation in capacity is totally expected. This is never covered by warranty. A consumed battery may still hold some charge, and in some cases a lot of charge, though that is rare. \nA battery would be deemed \"failed\" and OS X would report it if it holds less than 80% of its factory full charge capacity. If this would happen within the first year, then it would be covered by warranty. This is the way OS X and diagnostics determine the health of the battery when the complaint/concern is poor battery life. \nThe battery Can also unexpectedly fail if the thermal sensor in the battery goes bad. But this is something that's impossible to preventively pick up with software. \n", "Q: What do ._Desktop and ._Library do? In my home directory, there are two files called ._Desktop and ._Library. They have read and write permissions, but cannot be read, even with root.\nWhat do these files do? Is there any way to modify them?\n\nA: ._ Desktop and ._Library contain extended attributes for these directories. This StackOverflow question describes roughly what generic ._ files are.\n\nif for file foo you have another ._foo, and you're on a Mac, the dot-underscore file is where the file resource fork / metadata is kept.\n\nAs to why directories like Desktop or Library would need extended attributes is beyond me, though I would guess it has something to do with appearance and special files.\n\nIf these ._ files are appearing on a mounted network filesystem (i.e. NFS) that doesn't use HFS+ on the host server, that is because HFS+ would usually store the information found inside these ._ files along with the file itself. However, since other filesystems do not handle these extended attributes nicely, OS X creates a resource fork that allows your client-side HFS+ filesystem to see extended attributes as if they were part of the file itself.\nThese files are used in the AppleDouble format which cause the file itself and its pesky counterpart to be merged once the file is taken off the networked filesystem and placed onto a HFS+ filesystem. Deleting these ._file metadata counterparts would usually result in their regeneration the next time OS X processes the file itself.\ncredit to Tetsujin's comment\n", "Q: My iMessages will not send to my friends, but I can send and receive (my friends included) to everyone else I have a small bit of a problem.

Your options are to either continue manually changing files to show extensions, or live with the inconsistency. Personally I agree with you, and would rather have the extensions shown for specific file types, but it appears that whether the save UI allows you to show extensions is up to the application authors.

You can certainly purchase Windows 7 online to get a product key. The ISO file containing Windows 7 can be downloaded from Microsofts web site, allowing you to install via BootCamp.\n\nA: Yes you do. Bootcamp is intended to give you the ability to have both Macintosh OS, and Windows OS on a single disk. This allows you to boot either Mac or Windows via holding option at boot up and selecting the disk. More specifically, Bootcamp is a partition type created to allow the major differences in disk formats between the two OS to cooperate on a single disk.\nThis doesn't give you free Windows.

I tested it out and the Compressed option made my image nearly half the size of the uncompressed version, which is great.  \nNow, I don't know for sure by I am assuming that this Compressed format is either Read only or Read/Write and if this is the case, why would you ever choose one of those formats over Compressed? \nI did not experience any loss of data when I did the Compressed and given the significantly smaller file size it seems like a no-brainer to always choose Compressed. Maybe I am making some wrong assumptions here...\n\nA: When you create an image and you select Compressed, you are doing so at the sake of speed and read/write capability\nTo access the data on a compressed image, you have to uncompress it first; that takes cycles (cpu time).  Secondly, per Apple, the image is read only, not read/write so you will lose that capability as well.\nThe \"Compressed\" format is great for archival of data, not for daily access.\n", "Q: Default Music app deleted from file system I have a jailbroken iPhone 5s on 8.1.2.

One of the claims for El Capitan is that it improves load times for applications up to 40%, but has anyone identified what this actually means?\nAre only specific applications affected? For example, have Apple only reduced the load times of their own apps by up to 40%? Or is there some new feature at work that allows applications to get into memory faster, or load shared libraries faster or what?\nSo, does anyone know how the claimed improvement is achieved? Should all apps be expected to load a bit faster (even if it's not the full 40%)?\nI've been unable to find any technical details about what has been done in terms of performance, except that Metal now exists, but that shouldn't impact load times really.\n\nA: Barring magic the only solution of load time should be to load an app in the background (completely or in part), so that it can load faster when called up by the user.  Obviously application developers can work on their app to make it load faster (like Libreoffice did) but this seems to be a completely different story. Preloading apps obviously has the disadvantage of taking up resources and it might only work with the apps bundled with the OS because these are the only apps that the OS developers can actually directly control.  In any case, an excellent question, and I am sorry I cannot provide more info.\n", "Q: Do Apple Lossless tracks remain lossless when sent via Airplay to a 4th gen Apple TV? This question, from 2012, asks whether there is loss in the signal quality of an Apple-Lossless-encoded file when transmitted from a Macbook to an Airport Express.\nI am wondering whether things are any different in 2016 when transmitting an Apple-Lossless-encoded file from a Macbook to a 4th gen Apple TV. Clearly Wifi is plenty able to transmit the file intact. With an HDMI connection to the TV and an Optical (audio) connection from the TV to the receiver, I should in principle be able to listen to an intact file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it still the case in 2016 that lossless files go through an encode-decode cycle?\n\n*Is there any configuration that makes me say \"use all available WiFi bandwidth, but let me listen to the original file\"?\n\n*Is there any configuration that says \"drop the video signal (for example, just display a static image of the cover of the album), and transmit the audio signal intact\"?\n\n\nGranted, this is not to be done for an extended period since the TV must remain on. Unlike the 3rd gen Apple TV, the 4th gen does not provide direct optical-out to the receiver.\n\nA: I'm assuming you're talking about AirPlay Screen Mirroring from a Mac to an Apple TV. In that case, yes, you are loosing signal quality from compression-before-transmission and decompression-after-reception.\nIn particular, the audio part of the AirPlay Screen Mirroring is compressed using the AAC-ELD codec to ensure low-latency sound encoding. However, there is a signal loss involved.\n", "Q: How to Edit .pps files? They open like power-points in Powerpoint with animations. I would like to maintain the animations.

This also lets you see if autocorrect is to blame without disabling it.\nUnfortunately, iOS doesn't let you set text replacements of less than 2 characters. OS X is supposed to not either, but you still can, and iCloud will sync the settings over.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Text and click the + in the lower left.\n\n*For both the ‘Replace’ and ‘With’, type an asterisk.\n\n*Wait for iCloud to sync the settings over to your iOS device. Your new text replacement should show in Settings → General → Keyboard → Text Replacement.\n\n\nIf the asterisk still changes, there's likely something else going on here, and I would suggest disabling autocorrect entirely just for testing purposes to establish if it is the root cause of the problem.\n", "Q: How to stop kernel_task from constantly using over 400% CPU? Configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Model Name: Mac mini (Late 2012)\n\n*Model Identifier: Macmini6,2\n\n*System Version: OS X v10.11.3 (El Capitan)\n\n\nFor the past few weeks, kernel_task has been using over 400% CPU and its virtual memory size has ballooned up to 68.97 GB. Even after restarting, kernel_task starts hammering the CPU right away. In addition to kernel_task, there is also another process high up in Activity Monitor’s list that is always running and is constantly using between 90% to 100% of the CPU:\n\n\n*\n\n*Python (running under the user: _devicemgr)\n\n\nI’ve tried quitting this process, but to no avail… the process just reopens using the same amount of CPU resources.\n\nA: As noted by Apple here:\n\nActivity Monitor may show that a process named kernel_task is using a large percentage of your CPU, and during this time you may notice a lot of fan activity. This process helps manage temperature by making the CPU less available to processes that are using the CPU intensely. In other words, kernel_task responds to conditions that cause your CPU to become too hot. When the temperature decreases, kernel_task automatically reduces its activity.\n\nThis would imply that kernel_task’s CPU usage will decrease once the process causing the CPU to overheat is stopped. Unfortunately, it was impossible to tell in Activity Monitor exactly what started the Python process owned by _devicemgr to begin with. Thankfully, someone else in this thread already did the detective work.\nThe steps I used to solve the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Moved Server.app to the Trash.\n\n*Clicked OK in the Server app removal detected. dialog box: \n\n*The Python process owned by _devicemgr finally stopped, and kernel_task’s CPU usage dropped dramatically to far more normal levels (3 – 10 %)… making my Mac finally usable again!\n\nOptionally, Server.app can be moved out of the Trash and back into the Applications folder. I attempted this and reopened it. After starting back up and setting up services, it gave a curious error related to DeviceManager (which is quite interesting considering the CPU was being trashed for the past few weeks thanks to a process running under _devicemgr in the first place): \nMore details in Console.app: \nIn any case, clicking on Continue and ignoring the error doesn’t seem to have any negative repercussions (yet) and CPU usage hasn’t seemed to spike yet either, so I’d say problem solved!\n", "Q: Can't sign in to the Mac App Store I am trying to update to El Capitan.  I am being asked for my Apple ID and password.  I entered both correctly however I am being asked to enter a verification code after the password (see screenshot).  This makes no sense, it's absurd, and very unlike Apple. Any thoughts on how to fix this?  \nNote:  I updated the password using the 2-step verification process, but the new password still does not work.  \n\n\nA: This is perfectly normal behavior for an account that has Two Step Verification enabled.\nIn order to have enabled it, you must have a trusted device enrolled that can receive either SMS or be found by \"Find My Phone\" because that's the device which will receive the verification code you enter after your password.  So, just enter the verification code that Apple sent to that trusted device after your password and you will be able to access the Mac App Store.\nHow do I turn off two-step verification?\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign in to your Apple ID account page.\n\n*In the Security section, Click Edit.\n\n*Click Turn Off Two-Step Verification.\n\n*Create new security questions and verify your date of birth.\nYou'll get an email confirming that two-step verification for your Apple ID is off.\n\n\nA: The solution is to insert your 2-way-auth-code directly after your Apple ID password in the same field, where you're asked for your normal password.\n\nA: I had this problem when I restored my Mac. Trouble is that the restore installed a clean version of Yosemite.\nSo, here’s what you do:\nType in your appleid password and hit enter. That brings up that image shown by the OP.\nThis will ding your iPhone (or other Apple device that you normally use 2factor with).\nPress Allow. Then a 6 digit code appears on your iPhone.\nNow append those 6 digits to your appleid password.\nThat process worked for me.\n\nA: When you get OTP on your phone then in appstore enter password with your otp for e.g\n\n*\n\n*username : appleid or email\n\n*password : yourpassword1234\n\nnote: 1234 is otp\n", "Q: App to turn iPhone to an old style feature phone? Is there an iPhone app, that help me reduce usage of the smartphone , by change it into an old style feature phone? Maybe I can turn on smartphone mode for 1 hour per day, but besides that the phone can only send text message and make calls.\n\nA: There will not be an app for this as apps are not allowed to change the system in this way.\nThe closest you can get to this is iOS Restrictions, which require a passcode to re-enable access to certain features on the device. You can configure which features are restricted on the device in Settings → General → Restrictions. There is no automated schedule for Restrictions — you will be required to enable it and disable it yourself.\n\nA: It would help to understand what exactly are you trying to accomplish?  \nFrom what I read I think you want to limit the Smartphone Capability but want to use it for maybe 1 hour a day?  So is this a Data restriction question? \nYou can always turn off the Cellular data and or restrict what Cell data can be used for.

I have a 2009 MacBook showing world with exclamation when attempting recovery. \nIt would not start using regular startup.\n\nA: This is your computer not having a proper bootable partition on your disk. In simple terms.. It doesn't know where your operating system files are to properly boot.\nSadly, you don't have the network recovery like newer macs do according to several posts like below.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4420972?start=0&tstart=0\nYour only option is to visit an Apple Store, unless you have a bootable volume (backup, time machine) that you can hold down the left alt-option at boot-up, and then select your time machine. These are configured to have an EFI partitioned on the disk. \nComplex version: \n\n\n*\n\n*A disk has a top-level GPT partition stating where \"partitions\" are on the disk. A partition is a slice of separated files from other partitions. \n\n*Following the GPT map, is the partitions. There should be an EFI partition to tell the system that OS X # is located at xyz on the disk.\n\n*The OS X partition.\n\n*Then there is a 650mb recovery partition that you boot to to save your system. \n\n\nOne of these partitions is missing. You didnt say if it would boot normally, only that it wouldn't boot into recovery. \n", "Q: Disk Utility of 10.6.2 install disk does not recognise SDD; Disk Utility of El Capitan does I ordered and installed an SSD in my 2010 iMac (10,1). I tried installing El Capitan via USB. This failed and searching the internet I found out that it is best to use the original install disks.\nSo I booted using the 10.6.2 Mac OS X install CD. However, I cannot install since the SSD does not show up in Disk Utility or the Installer. However, when I go back to the El Capitan installer, the disk does show up. It has one partition, HFS Journaled, GUID. \nWhat can I do to make the 10.6.2 installer see the SSD?\n\nA: I solved the issue by installing El Capitan on the USB (via another Mac) and booting from there (a full install, not just a boot disk). The El Capitan booted from the USB did see the SSD, so I could install El Capitan from the USB onto the SSD. \nThe core issue was that Apple seems to have added third party SSD support after 10.6, so installing 10.6 was never possible. \n", "Q: How to Remove iOS dev/IDE/... from Xcode?

I'm connecting to an SFR 'La Box' optic fibre wifi router / modem in France (with 180Mbs down, 10Mbs up) - which has a feature I've not come across before on a wifi router:  \nparallel 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks - using the same names and passwords by default\nAs explained in the system settings:\n\nYou have at your disposal two types of networks Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz b/g/n and 5GHz a/n/ac). Both networks have a common name: Numericable-abcd. These two networks can be configured and used independently. You can disable or enable your convenience your Wi-Fi networks.\n\nUsing a mid-2015 15\" macbook pro - and experiencing random wifi \"dropouts\":  \n\n\n*\n\n*macbook menu bar shows a full strength wifi signal / connection\n\n*browser / app will say you're not connected to the internet\n\n*internet TV still works - indicating that it's not a problem with the router's external connection.\n\n*turning macbook wifi off then on - or waiting a few minutes - fixes the problem\n\n\nAlso - I only seem to get a 25-30m wifi range - which seems low (at least for a 2.4GHz system).\nIs my model of macbook pro able to switch seamlessly between frequencies on the same network - or would I get better performance by turning one network off (or using different network names) ?\nCould the wifi chip become 'confused' by having parallel networks - and could it be what's causing the loss of connection and/or lack of wifi range ?\nSystem Settings Screenshot:\n\n\nA: Chances are, it's your WiFi router.\nI was having the exact same issue with 2 Macs (iMac 27 Late 2012 and a 2009 MBP) as well as a Microsoft Surface Pro 3.  I had both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks and would get random, but continual dropouts that would lose Internet connectivity.\nI disabled each network individually, first the 5GHz , then the 2.4GHz.  Running on one frequency at a time, had no effect - I still kept dropping connections.  I even completely disabled the WiFi in the router and connected another router running DDWRT acting solely as a WAP that was only capable of 2.4GHz.  Even that had problems\nWhat I found was that the build quality of even the so-called best routers (Netgear, D-Link, Asus, etc.) were still of poor quality.  I ended up getting an \"Enterprise Grade\" wireless access point - the Ubiquiti UAP-AC - did my problems go away.\nWhen I say, go away, I mean go away instantly.  From the time I installed this WAP, I have yet to have an Internet drop out.  Period.  I haven't had a single one in the month and a half I have had it installed.  The fix was instantaneous.\nIf you do go this route, what you will have to do is turn off the WiFi on your router and just use this external WAP.  Installation was super easy - it took about 10-15 mins total and I had my network up and running in no time.\n\nA: The short answer is YES it is capable. I have a Macbook Pro 13\" Retina Late 2013 model running El Capitan. I am running a Dual Band Router 2.4 and 5.0 by ASUS.  The difference of my setup is that I gave the 2.4 and 5.0 different names so they appear separately in my wifi list.  I have it set to access the 5.0 first and if for some reason it is not available it will connect to the 2.4 band.  I have it set the same on my iPhone, iPad as well.  I have not experienced any connectivity problems and the range is quite good.  \nHave you tried setting each band with a separate SSID? PW can be the same if you want.  Actually I have even a guest SSID setup too and it too works just fine. \n\n", "Q: Connecting Airport to switch to extend a network I have an Airport Extreme connected to the internet and a handful of Extremes/Expresses extending it wirelessly. It works OK. But when I connect one of the extending devices with an ethernet cable - on the theory that wired is better than wireless - things go awry. (My primary Airport Extreme starts dropping the connection, devices show that they are online, but they are not, etc. Basically, the network stops working.)\nOnce thing that I do that I'm not sure of is that I plug those devices into a switch as opposed to directly into the primary Airport Extreme. So my question is: Is this OK to do?\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: If you have them set up as a wireless extender and then connect them with a wired connection, you are creating a network loop. \n\nThe drawing is a bit rudimentary, but it makes the point.  Whether you are connected over a wire or a radio, you have a connection between one Airport and another. When you make the second (wired) connection, you create a second path back to the Airport.  \nSo, if you imagine a client device connected to any one of the two lower switches in the picture, which path should the switch send data destined for the client?\nThat's why things go awry.\n\"Enterprise\" grade network switches have something called STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) also known as 802.1d which prevents this from happening.  Looking at the Tech Specs page for the Airport Extreme, it appears that 802.1d is not supported; not surprising since it's rarely on consumer grade devices.\nTo fix it, you need to leave the wired connection in and turn off the \"Extender\" mode.  Set it to be a Wireless Access Point instead.\n", "Q: Using internet recovery to install Mac OS X on SSHD, then replace internal? I have a USB 3.0 to Sata cable of which I will plug into a 500gb SSHD. I will try to install a completely new Mac OS X on it using the Internet Recovery option. Then transfer all of my files via USB 3.0 from the internal to the SSHD.\nAfterwards, I will replace my internal HDD with the SSHD. Will this work? Will it automatically boot into my SSHD seeing as it is the only drive? \n\nA: Yes. OS X supports external bootable volumes fine, and doesn't differentiate in any meaningful way between an external and internal bootable volume.\nI would recommend using Migration Assistant to migrate your files, however, if possible–but you'd need a second Mac for this. A relatively easy workaround is to simply \"restore\" the external disk using the internal disk as the source. You'll need to first boot onto an external drive of some sort or Internet Recovery (assuming your Mac is new enough) (to my knowledge, the recovery partition won't work), then use Disk Utility from there.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the external volume in the sidebar, then select Edit > Restore.\n\n*Click the Restore pop-up menu, then choose the internal volume.\n\n*Click Restore, then click Done.\n\n\nA: I recently did this for my iMac using a time machine back up. \nSo I went ahead and replaced the HDD with an SSD and started the computer. I had the ethernet capable plugged in and the time machine External HDD. There was a dialogue screen that asked me if I wanted to restore from Time machine and I clicked yes and selected the backup I wanted to use.  it didn't take long at all.   \nThis would take out one of your steps. \nThe other way to do it would be to remove your HDD and Duplicate it to the SSD and install the SSD and start the computer and you're done.  With this you must insure the SSD is the same size or larger than the original HDD. \n", "Q: How to switch keyboard layout on right cmd press I want to make a shortcut for keyboard layout switching.

Previously I used PuntoSwitcher to switch layout by cmd press but it works for left and right cmd and this is not behaviour I expecting. \nAlso, I tried to use betterTouchTool, but i cannot make 1 key shortcut there.\nIs there any way to achieve this behaviour?\n\nA: Here you go! https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner\ndisregard below, only there for history.\n~Sadly I did a lot of research on the modifier keys for OS X a while ago, and you cannot differentiate left and right cmd modifiers.~ However the keybind normally for changing keyboard configuration is cmd-control-space for myself.

I would highly appreciate any help on that again, thanks in advance !\nSolution\nFollowing the steps as described by klanomath I managed to recover that partition and save the files elsewhere. Note that I couldn't repair the disk after a verification through the disk utility, my guess is that the old version of the disk utility in the Internet recovery is not capable of doing that for something created with a recent version but I'm not sure about that.\nAnyway, I got my data back, thanks a lot for your help klanomath !  \n\nThe free space is the linux system I removed.\n\nA: Your GUID partition table and the MBR are bogus. Your second partition disk0s2 has the wrong partition type. Instead of FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF  the type should be 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC.\nTo modify the partition table destroy and create a new proper one. Afterwards you have to re-add the partitions in the old boundaries but with proper types.\nPreparation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup. \nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan). If you boot to a full system and login as admin you have to prepend sudo to execute some commands like gpt ... or newfs_hfs ...!\nRemove the bogus MBR/GPT and re-add the partitions\n\n\n*\n\n*Open in the menubar Utlities->Terminal\n\n*Enter diskutil list and gpt -r show /dev/disk0 to get an overview\n\n*Destroy the bogus GUID partition table/MBR and recreate a fresh one:\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0\ngpt destroy /dev/disk0\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0\ngpt create -f /dev/disk0\n\n\n*Re-add the partitions but with a different type for the 2nd partition (i=2):\ngpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B /dev/disk0\ngpt add -b 488966144 -i 3 -s 1267712 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\ngpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s 332728384 -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\n\n\n*The logical volume should mount automatically if not encrypted.

It turns off and goes to sleep right away, the only issue is when it launches the whole OS, the Apple logo with the loading bar is on for a bit too long.\nThe guy at the Apple Store said if I am bothered with this ('cause it would bother him, he said), I should take it to a full checkup. This Mac is my workstation and 1,5 weeks in service is not really going to happen anytime soon.\nAre there any ways to work around this problem and any tips what might cause this? The reason why it was restored is because I was reinstalling the OS, however, my internet connection broke at some point. El Capitan had been uninstalled, but the new version hasn't been downloaded yet. So I was like I better take it to the store then mess everything up by myself.\nBefore I used 10.11.0, now it is 10.11.5.\n\nA: I have to say that each version of El Capitan (including 10.11.0) slowed a little more my MacBook Air. \nIn Yosemite the boot was easily 3 times faster.\nThose days, it's the normal behavior of new system versions...\n", "Q: loookup server IPs the website runs on with nslookup error - Got recursion not available from 192.168.1.1, trying next server I would like to lookup servers cnn runs on for educational purposes. \nI issued nslookup www.cnn.com command in terminal and got an error:\n;; Got recursion not available from 192.168.1.1, trying next server\nServer:     2a00:ee0:d::13\nAddress:    2a00:ee0:d::13#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nwww.cnn.com canonical name = turner.map.fastly.net.\nName:   turner.map.fastly.net\nAddress: 23.235.43.73\n\n192.168.1.1 looks like an address in a home network.\nAlthough it lists one server, I don't believe they use just on. Is there something else I must do or is looking up the servers cnn runs on disabled by cnn.\n\nA: The answer you got was correct.\nwww.cnn.com canonical name = turner.map.fastly.net.\nA canonical name, or CNAME record is a record in DNS servers that define an alias for another domain.  In this case \"www.cnn.com\" points to the domain \"turner.map.fastly.net\".\nAs for your 192.168.1.1 server, that's most likely your router that is configured as a DNS cache or DNSMasq server.  The error message is fine, it's just telling you that the DNS server that you have listed first in the list of DNS servers doesn't support recursion.  It's not an issue.\nMy personal router is configured as a DNS relay and I don't get the error because it passes all DNS requests except for anything with my defined domain out to the public DNS servers.\n", "Q: What is @icloud.com domain name?

Can you suggest a straightforward fix for this?\n\nA: I'm afraid you'll probably need to rebuild emacs.  I expect that the one you have is looking for libraries that aren't there any more following the XQuartz update.\nI had the exact same problem, and solved it with brew upgrade emacs --with-x11 --with-ctags --with-glib --with-gnutls.  The relevant command-line for you will differ according to your choice of package manager and build options.\n\nA: XQuartz 2.7.9 has multidimensional namespaces.\nOnly a few libraries were patched.\nNot the ones for gnu emacs as I experienced.\nReinstalling 2.7.8 is the first step.\nThe second is to remove the new X11 library that \nwas installed by 2.7.9.\nIn my case this was found at\n/opt/local/lib/X11\nBut be careful with this!\n", "Q: Add Novel Groupwise Account via Exchange ActiveSync to Mail I want to add my Novel GroupWise account to my Mac, which is not possible due to the lack of a (reliable and recent) client. The firm I'm working for set a data sync server up for this purpose but that only supports Exchange Active Sync if I am understanding it correctly.\nI am assuming this because setting up the account as an exchange account on the iPhone and iPad was no problem but it does not work in mail. \nDoes there exist a workaround for this situation? Maybe some daemon that pretends to be an mobile client and fetches everything? I would really like to be able to add the work calendar and emails on my mac. I'm running the latest El Capitan an a Macbook Pro. \n\nA: OS X only supports Microsoft Exchange, not Exchange ActiveSync.

So, being an independent person, he has tried to install Windows on empty HDD (yeah, it's weird) and after his several tries mac mini stopped showing anything on screen. Mac mini still working, boot up signal and light are on, but now we have nothing on display, like nothing is connected. \nIn workshop repairer said that young man broke BIOS and recover costs 7 000 rub (~106 usd), what is pretty expensive to us. Is there any way to recover bios on my own? In case that I don't see anything on screen while mac is working. :D\nThanks in advance!\nUPD: Brother just burned .iso file on DVD and inserted in mac mini. How installation had even started - I have no idea. But it failed.\nI erased entire HDD. Have tried all the startup key combinations (reset PRAM, etc). Nothing reanimated mac mini. On booting up I have \"no signal detected\" screen.\nUPD2: Tried several monitors and HDMI cables. Mac mini still displays nothing and without HDD too.\n\nA: If you are entirely sure that the computer is starting up with a connection to a monitor, then this is a problem with the disk format more than likely. This will make it so that the Mac will not be able to boot into recovery either. You'll need to go to an Apple retailer to ask them to reformat the disk for you, or perhaps it's possible on your own. I know that apple likes to ensure no third-party computers register with Mac OS X so they format the disks in dumb way.\n", "Q: Itunes smart Playlist with reference to Apple Music favorites won't sync to Iphone I have created a Playlist (pl1) and favorited some of the tracks in it.\nBut because I want to filter (the heart symbol in Apple Music) only the tracks which are favorited from pl1 I created a smart playlist with following settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*contained in pl1 AND\n\n*marked as favorite\nMy Problem now is that the new smart playlist won't sync over to my iPhone...\npl1 and the favorites sync normally and even the favorited tracks from pl1 show up in favorites on the iPhone but as I said the smart playlist won't show up.\nI tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the iPhone\n\n*Re-Enable Apple Music\n\n*Relogging from icloud\n\n*Recreating both pl1 and the smart playlist\n\n\nI also found these two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*ITunes Match: syncing smart playlists that reference other\nplaylists\n\n*iTunes smart playlist not syncing to iPhone\nBut the first one is about itunes match and the second one said that it worked again after some time\n\nA: Unfortunately you are not able to sync Smart Playlists that contain a rule referencing another playlist with Apple Music tracks.\nIn some cases you may be able to get around this by making a normal playlist and putting Smart Playlists in that (for example my top 100 played tracks and my Loved tracks), but as you are trying to get just the intersection that wouldn't work.\nCan only suggest giving Apple feedback at:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/itunesapp.html\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/apple-music.html\n\nA: Although a Smart Playlist that contains a rule referencing another playlist cannot sync I have found a simple work around:\nCreate a normal playlist (this wil be the end result playlist that you are going to use) and from iTunes on your computer simply drag the smart playlist into this playlist. This adds the content from the Smart Playlist into the normal playlist - without any syncing issues.\nThis works for me and although it has the need for some manual implementation, it is minimal and in your case it should not be to big of a problem.\n", "Q: What Apps allow a user to join photos of arbitrary quantity and size?

This includes your text messages, phone records, and internet history.\nHow do I check if one of these profiles has been installed?  I have an iPhone that I think a profile was installed on, but I see no indication anywhere in settings that this is true.\n\nA: Go to Settings -> General and scroll all the way to the bottom. At the very bottom is \"Reset\". Above that is \"Regulatory\". Above that is \"Profiles\". If you have no profiles installed, this may not show up. In that case, you're fine. If a profile does come up click on it to get more information.

I can cd into devbootcamp but not bookshelf but I'm not sure why. I don't remember how I made the alias to devbootcamp but I followed this tutorial to create the bookshelf alias. Also strangly in my terminal devbootcamp is purple but bookshelf is not. How do I make it so they have the same functionality?\n\n\nA: If you are trying to cd into an alias, it will not work; this is by design as an alias works at the Finder level, not the underlying UNIX level.\nI have excerpted some of the key aspects of aliases, symbolic links (symlinks), and hard links from the article \"What Are Aliases, Symbolic Links, and Hard Links in Mac OS X?\" below.\n\n\nAliases\n\nThis type of shortcut is the oldest for the Mac; its roots go all the way back to System 7. Aliases are created and managed at the Finder level, which means that if you're using Terminal or a non-Mac application, such as many UNIX apps and utilities, an alias won't work. OS X seems to see aliases as small data files, which they are, but it doesn't know how to interpret the information they contain.\n  \n\nSymbolic Links\n\nThis type of shortcut is part of UNIX and Linux file systems. Because OS X is built on top of UNIX, it fully supports symbolic links. Symbolic links are similar to aliases in that they are small files that contain the pathname to the original object. But unlike aliases, symbolic links don't contain the inode name of the object. If you move the object to a different location, the symbolic link will be broken, and the system won't be able to find the object.\n\nHard Links\n\nLike symbolic links, hard links are part of the underlying UNIX file system. Hard links are small files that, like aliases, contain the original item's inode name. But unlike aliases and symbolic links, hard links don't contain the pathname to the original object. You would typically use a hard link when you want a single file object to appear in multiple places. Unlike with aliases and symbolic links, you can't delete the original hard-linked object from the file system without first removing all hard links to it.\n\nWhat works in both Terminal & Finder\nJust create a symlink in Terminal\nln -s <path to some folder> <destination of link>\n\nFor example, on my Desktop, I created a symlink to my /Volumes folder\nln -s /Volumes /Users/allan/Desktop/Volumes\n\nOn my Desktop, I got this icon automagically:\n\nYou can even give it a different name:\nln -s /Volumes /Users/allan/Desktop/Stuff\n\nAnd automagically...\n\n", "Q: Can I use Time Machine for multiple different backups? I have my Macintosh HD 500 Gb who backs up on two external hard drives (both 500 GB), so i have always two backups! But i have an other external hard drive (1TB) with a lot of footage on it which i want to backe up on a new external drive (1TB)!\nIt is possible to setup Time machine to do this automatically for me, also two different backups?\n\nA: TM can only run one backup scheme. You can include the other external drive to backup to the existing TM backup drive or drives along with your Mac HD drive. Or you can back up all drives to the new 1TB drive (or drives if you want to add others). The 500 Gig drives are not big enough to backup all drives too.\nWhat you might consider is using CCC or SuperDuper to backup the other drive to the new 1TB drive.\nSOLUTION by Glenn Leblanc on Apple Communities\n", "Q: Forcing `open` command to open unsigned app?

Will it hurt to try?\n\nA: As a general rule, you can mix sticks of RAM as far as brands/speeds/timings/sizes.  \nYour computer should accommodate different speeds/timings by scaling down speeds/timings on the faster sticks until they match the slower sticks.\nBrands will matter as far as they do for everything else: everyone wants you to buy their brand of stuff, but they'll generally work. I've stuck random brands into random Apple/Windows machines and the ones that aren't just terrible do always work.\nDepending how far apart the specs on your sticks are, you may have stability issues, but those are easy to fix - remove the stick you added.\n\nA: According to Everymac, that's what it takes...\nRAM Type:   PC3-8500 DDR3   Min.

There is nothing in my Music app on the phone except for downloadable songs I had purchased (but they're not local on my phone anymore), the movies I had transferred from the computer to the Videos app disappeared, all my podcast downloads had disappeared (they show up as saved, just the download for them is gone), my audiobook is gone from iBooks but other items there appear okay. Photos and Voice Memos apps also appear okay.\nChecking in Settings, I don't appear to have recovered what should have been a couple GB of storage from the disappearance. And when viewing a breakdown of usage by app, it appears like Videos, Music, and Podcasts completely disappeared from the list, even though I did download about 5MB of data back to the Podcasts app.\nI tried rebooting, no luck there. My first thought to fix this would be to connect to iTunes and have it sync and re-download all my content to the phone, but if that doesn't fix it or if I t leaves a couple ghost GB of data on my phone, that'll be concerning. And then I'm worried if I sync it, iTunes will back my phone up and then if I need to do a restore, I won't have a good backup to restore from (unless I can back up the backup and my iTunes library too?).\nAnybody ever heard of this? What should I do?\nUpdate: Tried poking around a little with iFunBox to see what's on the phone. Going to the raw file storage and then podcasts, there still are a few files that show up there, but not as many as there should be and not as many as show up on my iPad when I view the iPad through iFunBox. When going to the iTunes content and then Music, both on the iPad and on the iPHone, it shows a lot of folders with short file names, most of those have an MP3 when viewing in the iPad, but they all seem empty on the iPhone.\nIs there a way I can back up my iTunes library and iPhone backup and then try a sync?\n\nA: Although I cannot account for the loss of the media, and the used storage on the phone may or may not include the ghosts of those files, here is what I did. I first backed up iTunes and archived the iPhone backup for safety, and then I synced (as per Apple Support advice) to iTunes, and everything copied itself over to the iPhone, it appears like normal again, which is great.\nThe only thing was that Podcasts tried to download a bunch of podcasts that had already copied on to the iPhone from iTunes, so I canceled those downloads. Not sure why it wanted to download what it already had.\nAgain, I can't figure out the cause or if this is a common occurrence, but it appears okay for now.\n", "Q: Maximising VirtualBox guest machine window size I am running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS inside VirtualBox on a MacBook Air 7,2, but the guest screen window size is less than the host display size.

Whenever I got to delete a photo, it says \"This photo will be deleted from iCloud Photo Library on all your devices.\" I don't want it deleted from my iCloud Photo Library, only my iPhone 6s. What I want to do is import photos and videos from my iPhone to my MacBook Pro and then delete them from my iPhone. If I import those photos and videos to my Mac and then delete them from my iPhone (ignoring the warning) will they also be deleted from my Mac?\n\nA: iCloud Photo Library's purpose is to unify the photo libraries across your devices. If you wish your devices to maintain separate libraries, you need to disable iCloud Photo Library.\n", "Q: Spotlight search on iOS not showing options to search web/maps/App Store unless it has results from other apps I am noticing something both on my iPad 2 and iPhone SE running iOS 9.3.2 that I don't recall seeing until today. When I do a spotlight search, it shows a list of results from different apps, and then at the bottom options to search web, App Store, and maps. But now, if the search is such that there are no results from apps, it won't show those last three search options either.\nAlso, if relevant, a search that brings up just one top hit of an app and nothing else, also does not show options for the web/app/map search. Also, spotlight might start showing a result, like of a note I'm typing, but as I keep typing just a little more of the title of that note, then all results disappear.\nAnd when offline, this problem goes away. Even about the disappearing notes search result problem.\n\nA: Upon a little testing around, I have discovered the solution. Go to Settings > General > Spotlight Search and disable Bing Web Results. There must be some problem either on Microsoft's end or in the way the iOS software gets it, and this interferes with Spotlight from doing what it needs to do.\nHopefully Apple will fix this and it can be re-enabled with iOS 10 or a future iOS 9.x update, or it will be fixed on Microsoft's end, if the issue becomes known to them.\nIt's unclear to me if this affects everyone or just a small number of users. If you're not sure if you have this problem, test it out as per the original question.

I'm doing a Corporate Challenge where I count all my steps every day and enter them into a website. \nThe other day I had backed up my phone the night before, and had a problem with it that meant it had to be replaced. When I restored my phone, all my steps for the day I had the defect had been lost. \nAll my data for other apps that sync with iCloud was preserved for that day. (Things, Tweetbot etc). \nMy question is: Does the Health App in iOS sync intraday to iCloud?\nEdit: This is different to the other question that is similar because I'm asking about intraday app sync, not daily device backups. \n\nA: Your Health data is backed up to iCloud as part of your device's backup. (Your device backup includes data stored on your phone by apps, your Settings, the layout of your home screen, etc.)\nI'm guessing you have iCloud set up to automatically back up your device each day, which it typically does each night when you're at home connected to Wi-Fi. So when you restored your phone, the iCloud backup you restored from probably had all your Health data up to about the end of the previous day.\nThis is different from how other apps sync with iCloud. When you (e.g.) create a new task in Things, the Things app probably saves that data to iCloud right away so that you can see it on your other devices, etc. So unlike your device backup, which was only current up to the previous night, your other apps/services that use iCloud were probably current up to the moment you experienced your problem.\n\nA: It doesn't sync to iCloud, but if you do an encrypted iTunes backup it will save that data.  \n", "Q: Why can't I create a directory on a mounted USB drive after mkdir, but finder new directory works?

Is this due to my drive containing a space in the name?  Is this due to the drive somehow being mounted as read-only?  From the finder I cannot see the test directory.  I can also create it from the command line with sudo, but as myself, it fails.\nI was able to work around, by creating a folder in the finder named test which seems to have erased the old test folder but mkdir still fails.  Why did I have to use the finder to create the folder?\n\nI went to do the test requested by fd0, plugged my USB drive back in again, and the issue is no longer showing:\nbash-3.2$ ls -al\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 user  staff   68 Jun  5 10:12 .\ndrwxrwxr-x  13 user  staff  510 Jun  3 18:36 ..\nbash-3.2$ mkdir local1_test\nbash-3.2$ pwd\n/Volumes/MiniPro 2/test\n\nI did notice an odd item though:\nbash-3.2$ cd /Volumes\nbash-3.2$ ls -al\ntotal 24\ndrwxrwxrwt@  7 root  admin   238 Jun  5 10:11 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  41 root  wheel  1462 Jun  3 18:29 ..\ndrwxrwxr-x  13 user   staff   510 Jun  3 18:36 MiniPro 2\ndrwxrwxrwx+  3 user   admin   102 Jun  3 18:17 MiniPro\\ 2\n\nWhy do I have to entries, could that have been the source of the issue?

In your case, you have one file system mounted in /Volumes called MiniPro 2 which is a HFS file system mounted noowners (ignore permissions). Your list (ls) command reveals that you also have a directory named MiniPro\\ 2 in /Volumes. Once you have determined that the directory MiniPro\\ 2 does not contain any files that are not backed up and you can safely remove the directory MiniPro\\ 2 then remove the directory. Do this without MiniPro 2 mounted.\n", "Q: How to conference call with FaceTime audio?

Like you, the articles I read all came out around the same time and it looks like they're all using the same wording leading me to believe they're all using the same source.

Little Snitch is a well-known piece of software that allows Mac users to block outgoing connexions from a specific app.\nNow, whenever I ask how to do the same with built-in OS X tools, I get an answer like: \"you can’t do this without Little Snitch. The built-in PF firewall is not an application firewall, and the built-in AF can only block incoming traffic. No OS X tool allows this.\"\nThis cannot be true. I mean, in this case, how would Little Snitch, or Hands Off!, or small apps such as RadioSilence achieve this to begin with? These apps themselves must certainly use built-in tools of some sort to block traffic on a per-application basis. I searched for open source alternatives with the idea to have a look at their sources and find out \"how they do this\". But... I found no open source alternative. Any idea?\n\nA: Little Snitch uses a network kernel extension to intercept network traffic.\n\nNKEs allow you to create modules that can be loaded and unloaded dynamically at specific positions in the network hierarchy. These modules can monitor and modify network traffic, and can receive notification of asynchronous events from the driver layer, such as interface status changes.\n\n\nEach of the networking KPI mechanisms performs a specific task. The basic networking KPI mechanisms are:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Socket filter KPI, which permits a KEXT to filter inbound or outbound traffic on a given socket, depending on how they are attached. Socket filters can also filter out-of-band communication such as calls to setsockopt or bind. The resulting filters lie between the socket layer and the protocol.\n  \n*…\n  \n*Interface filter KPI, which allows a KEXT to add a filter to a specific network interface. These interface filters (previously known as data link NKEs) can passively observe traffic (regardless of packet type) as it flows into and out of the system. They can also modify the traffic (for example, encrypting or performing address translation). They essentially act as filters between a protocol stack and a device.\n  \n*…\n  \n\nAlternatives to network kernel extensions exist as you mentioned, but only for certain use cases.\n\nBecause even minor bugs in kernel-level code can cause serious consequences, including application instability, data corruption, and even kernel panics, the techniques described in this document should be used only if no other mechanism already exists. For example, where possible, IP filtering should generally be done using ipfw. Similarly, packet logging should generally be done using bpf.\n\nNetwork kernel extensions are far more powerful and allow for more detailed control.\n\n\n*\n\n*Network Kernel Extensions Overview\n\n*Introduction to Network Kernel Extensions Programming Guide\nEmphasis in quoted content mine.

I don't know how to find the image compression type used in a PDF on my Mac.\nI've tried Adobe Acrobat Pro, but the \"Document Properties\" box does not show any data regarding compression.\n\nA: The 'compression type' (e.g. JPG, PNG, TIFF…) can vary from image to image within the PDF document, which is why it's not shown in the general document properties.

I'd like to fix this. How can I disable Vsync in 10.9.5? What does this have to do with Beamsync?\n\nA: CS:GO respects its own Vsync setting, which works while in fullscreen. You can edit this in the Video options:\n\nEnabling this setting will prevent screen tearing, at the cost of performance. Typically, this is undesirable in a competitive game like CS:GO, but there's nothing stopping you.\nBeamsync is Apple's implementation of Vsync, present in the normal desktop environment and, by default, most apps. As of OS X Mavericks, the ability to enable/disable it was accessible through the Graphics Tools for Xcode:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Download Graphics Tools for Xcode - Late August 2014\n  \n*Install or just mount Graphic Tools\n  \n*Open Quartz Debug\n  \n*Go to Tools -> Show Beam Sync Tools\n  \n*Select Disable Beam Synchronization\n  \n\nNote that these changes are not permanent.\nAt some point however, this appears to have changed: disabling Beam Sync is no longer available through the Graphics Tools. Some tools (1 and 2) claim to disable it, but I haven't verified their integrity, and neither have been updated since 2015.\nMy recommendation given your use case is to just keep CS:GO in fullscreen and use their implementation of Vsync, toggling as you see fit.\n", "Q: How to remove Apple System Apps How can I delete Apple OS X application such as Photos, iPhoto, and others that I never use?\n\nA: \n@grgarside: El Capitan and later won't let you just rm the default apps, they're protected. – grgarside 11 mins ago \n\nThat's because of El Capitan's System Integrity Protection System (SIPS), which prevents even Root from making (potentially harmful) changes to the system. A fine idea in principle, apart from the fact that it stops you doing a lot of things whose \"integrity\" to the system is spurious –such as changing the speech bubble colour in Messages, or deleting pointless Apple apps you never use.\nYou can disable SIPS by booting into Recovery (Hold down Command+R at startup) and then using Utilities > Terminal issue the following command:\ncsrutil disable\n\nand then rebooting.\nNormal God-like power will now be restored to root and you're free to delete Apple bloatware.  To re-enable SIPS, the corresponding command from recovery is:\ncsrutil enable\n\nHowever - and it's a big \"However!\" - with SIPS re-enabled again, OSX will silently restore any system apps you deleted. I found this out when I disabled SIPS, removed iTunes, re-enabled SIPS and found iTunes back in my Applications folder a few days later.\n\nA: NOTE: the following only works if System Integrity Protection (SIP) is disabled.

Apple has built-in protection to prevent this from happening (if the video is not protected, then it's ok to take a screenshot).\nThe only way you'll be able to do this is to use a third-party video player, like VLC, or a third-party image capture, like SnapNDrag.\n\nA: SnapNDrag Free does not take photos of DRM protected content and VLC does not play DRM protected content.

Installed just fine. However, I’m left with a non-launchable iPhoto, although it’s a slightly newer version 9.2.1.  When I run any of the updaters (9.2.3, 9.3, etc), it gives me the error message “iPhoto 9.1 or later is required to install this update.” which is a bogus message, but probably something that Apple has ceased to care about.\nAs far as I know, there was never an iPhoto 9.6.1 updater put out by Apple — by that time it was updated via the App Store.\nAny ideas on how I an get a runable version of iPhoto on this Mavericks Mac? (Yosemite is not the answer for other reasons I won’t go into). I do have Mavericks installed on a bootable external with an iPhoto that works (not exactly sure which version, but probably either 9.4.3 or 9.6.1). I know I could copy the app, but what support files also need to be copied.  Or is there some way to “trick” the current updaters into working?\n\nA: Turns out that the iPhoto version was being reported incorrectly. It was really version 9.0 (from the iLife '11 DVD) not 9.2.1 as it said in the GetInfo box, so all of those later updaters were being honest. What I really needed was the 9.1 updater found here https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1322?locale=en_US\nOnce I got 9.1 installed, I was able to bring it up to 9.4.3, which will work just fine.\n\nA: If you delete iPhoto, then you can simply go into the Purchased tab of the Mac App Store and re-install iPhoto (the latest version).\n\nA: If you have another Mac running a compatible new version of iPhoto, you can just copy the iPhoto.app file from that Mac into your Applications folder. You might need to authenticate with the user password on the recently updated Mac but that's it. I did this after upgrading to El Capitan and it worked fine, no installer or updater required.\nThere is also a Photos app in El Capitan, which I ended up using instead of iPhoto, actually I deleted iPhoto.\n", "Q: iTunes opens on my iMac automatically iMac with OS X 10.11.5.  iTunes opens with no prompting from me.  I can close it all day and it keeps re-opening.  I rarely want to use it.  How to stop this from happening.\nThanks for the advice.\n\nA: None of the suggestions here had made any difference.  But, I kept looking and scouring the web and found (I don't remember where) what I thought, at first, was a half-assed suggestion that seems to have done the job.  The suggestion was that a \"dirty\" or misaligned speaker jack could be the issue.  Well, some days ago I removed the speaker plug from the iMac and, lo and behold, the constant opening of iTunes ceased.  I will eventually experiment to see if that was really the issue, but at least temporarily I'm satisfied with using the internal speakers.\n\nA: Try checking out the links below. Others have seen similar issues so they might help you out.\nStop iTunes from opening when a device is plugged in?\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/6078492?tstart=0\n\nA: We had the same issue. It turns out that it was the Apple TV controls that was causing it.\n", "Q: External SSHD has Mac OS X installed by another mac. Can I use that SSHD on my Mac? There was an external SSHD that had MAC OS X installed on it through Internet Recovery by using another Macintosh with a USB 3.0 to Sata II cable. Is there some sort of serial number that is tied to that installation of Mac OS X on the external SSHD? Or can I actually boot that external SSHD on another Macintosh and it would be fine?\n\nA: There is no serial number (like a Windows 7/8/10 product key) tied to the OS X installation. If you didn't configure iCloud/iTunes accounts while setting up the system it's almost plain vanilla.\nBut installing OS X in Internet Recovery Mode will install the system the Mac originally was shipped with. Moving the disk with this system to a newer Mac - which usually relies on a newer OS X version - will probably fail to boot.\nUsually newer Mac contain newer or additional hardware. The older system usually doesn't ship with the newer or additional drivers needed.\nExample:\nThe iMac Late 2011 (Mac12,1) was shipped with OS X 10.7.2. The iMac Late 2013 (Mac14,2) was shipped with OS X 10.8.4. Attaching the external disk to the iMac Late 2011 and using IRM's Restore OS X will install 10.7.x on it. The same disk attached to the iMac Late 2013 will probably fail to boot because the system is too old.\n", "Q: Previous File Location Lookup While prepping for the switch to a new computer, I made the dreadful decision to move files from the \"All My Files\" Finder view to a new folder. All of the files moved to the new folder, but left the old folders in all of the previous locations (now with no files in them). I've completely lost the file structure that organized all of the files into something meaningful.\nI didn't realize my mistake until it was too late to \"Undo\". Is there any way to look up the previous location of a list of files? \n\n\n*\n\n*OS X Yosemite 10.10.5\n\n*no Time Machine or other backups\n\n\nA: \nNo, file location isn't something that's tracked and without any form of backups, that would have path recursion, you're out of luck. At least you have the files and didn't loose them. You might want to consider using Time Machine going forward!\n\nSource: comment by user3439894\n\nA: If you moved the file to Trash, as opposed to moving the file to another directory, then you can right-click on the file in Trash, and choose \"Put Back\" in the menu.\n", "Q: How do I use Soundflower with El Capitan on my MacBook Air and hear my computer audio while recording with QuickTime? Okay, so I've tried so hard to set up Soundflower on my computer, and it doesn't seem to work no matter how many tutorials I watch. I'm running OSX El Capitan 10.11.4 on a MacBook Air 13-inch from early 2015. What I'd like to do is be able to record my computer audio, my microphone audio, and my screen at once, and hear my computer audio through my headphones.\nHere's everything I've done so far.\nI have the El Capitan Soundflower version. I can't post the link, because I don't have enough reputation points.\nI went into Audio MIDI setup and made a Multi-Output Device, selecting Built-in Output and then Soundflower 2ch.\n\nI also set up an Aggregate device, merging my Built-In Device (this is what my headphones show up as; they're Urbanear Plattan) with Soundflower 2ch.\n\nI set my output to the Multi-Output Device, and my input to the Aggregate Device (system settings>sound>output/input).\nThen, I went into QuickTime>file>new screen recording and set the input to Soundflower 2ch. I can't hear anything when I play my video back. Can anyone walk me through the correct process, or tell me what to change?

He's upgraded iPhones to a 6s but still has that old account as his default. \nQuestion: How do I get those calendar entries off of a non-syncing account and move them to a regular google calendar account?\n\nA: The best method I found was to purchase and use iExplorer. I backed up the phone and then exported as vCards and calendar files to the attached computer. Then I imported them into google calendar and contacts for them (they were moving to Android). \n", "Q: Canceling the last dictated words in dictation mode in iOS In Dragon NaturallySpeaking one can use the Scratch That command to delete recently dictated text.

This will bring up recently used apps. Find the Message app and swipe up. This will force close the app.\n\n*Hold down the Power button until the power-slider appears, but don't turn the device off. Instead, while that power-slider is showing, hold down the Home button until your home screen re-appears.\n\n*Hold down the Home and Power buttons until the Apple Logo shows, and then release. \n\n*If one of your recent messages had a photo or video, try deleting it from the Messages. This may keep it from crashing again if you're able to open the app at all.\n→ Try this multiple times.\nIf these steps still don't fix the problem, try backing up your iPhone to iTunes. Then restore from the backup. This step is tedious, I understand. But it may solve the problem when everything else has failed.\nEDIT: \n(additional suggestions)\nGoing beyond what usually fixes this problem...\nYou're options, shy of going to an Apple Store for an actual diagnostic, would be limited at this point. I see two options.\n• Restore as a new iPhone.\n• Try downloading PhoneClean on your computer.

Simply insert it into the audio in port on your MacBook Pro using a 3.5mm jack. \nLine level simply refers to relatively amplified analog signal. Not all microphones provide this: if necessary, you may need to use an amplifier.\nI'm not sure why the microphone you already have didn't work: there's nothing that should be preventing it.

Let's say I have 2 MacPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacPro at work\n\n*MacPro at home\n\n\nI wonder if there is any way I could access my MacPro at work from home using the screen sharing method, without anything being visible on the monitors of MacPro at work.\nI am currently able to do the standard screen sharing using my work MacPro from home, and can also normally access its folders etc. My question relates to ensuring privacy of the work content in case someone walks by while I'm using that remote computer. Unplugging the work computer's monitors would not be a fully working solution, as it would only partially resolve this issue.\n\nA: There are three solutions that I know of that allow you to \"black out\" the remote screen so that uses cannot see what you are doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Remote Desktop (ARD).  Cost:  $79\n\n*TightVNC.  Cost:  Free for personal use.\n\n*TeamViewer.  Cost:  Free for personal use ($810 for Business License)\n\n\nAs for ARD and VNC, they will do they job, but as far as performance, they are quite frankly, horrible.  ARD is definitely better than VNC, but if you are comparing it to Microsoft Remote Desktop, then ARD looks and feels prehistoric.  The VNC protocol is quite \"heavy\" and the lag on a LAN is unbearable at times.  But, for the price...\nI wholeheartedly recommend TeamViewer\nTeamViewer, is one of the best remote access / remote control utilities out there.  It's free for personal use but to buy a license it's expensive.  If you have many clients to manage, TeamViewer is the one.  There is zero setup involved. unlike VNC which you have to open ports on your router.\n\nTeamViewer does have the capability to black out your screen and you get this feature with the free version - you don't need the paid version.  I tested this today and it works.  To do this, you have to first disable remote input, then click on show black screen.\nBelow are the screen captures of my TeamViewer session from my iMac to a Dell Laptop running Win10 with the black out option enabled:\n\nIf you notice the black screen on the laptop below.  All you can see is the pointer arrow and that moves with the TeamViewer session and not the remote mouse/keyboard.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately (at time of writing) TeamViewer's \"Disable remote input\" and \"Show black screen\" features do not seem to work in the macOS Sierra version.\n\nA: Another approach. Turn on the guest user on the remote computer, then log in as guest user on your first screen sharing connection. Make another screen sharing connection, log in your actual user, your activity won't be shown on the remote computer.\nIf you have FileVault on remote computer, you will not be able to use  guest user, as it will restart the computer on Safari-only mode. If FileVault is enabled, just create another user, log in as that user on your first screen sharing. Then make another screen sharing connection using your actual user.\nThe guest account is less useful if FileVault is enabled. With FileVault enabled, when you log in as guest, only Safari can be used.

However, the app in question doesn't show up in my 'Purchased', because I never downloaded it from the app store. Is there any way I can give that app to my friend without the use of my first friend's Apple ID?\n\nA: The app was never shared to your Apple ID and was not associated with your Apple ID in any way. If the app was still on the store and needed updating, your friend's Apple ID would be used. The app remains bound to your friend's Apple ID and thus you need your friend's Apple ID again to install it elsewhere.\n", "Q: iTunes stops playing song without reason I'm using Apple Music and I'm still in the evaluation period, but the system isn't working very well:\nEither on my iPhone or my Mac (latest OS version), when I'm streaming music, it stops playing in an unexpected way after two minutes.\nThe playback play fine when the music is local, but connectivity is fine in other application. I wonder why iTunes is so buggy when it comes to distant request...\n\nA: I managed to fix my problem by calling Apple hotline. They asked me to do a lot of manipulation and I cannot say precisely what was going wrong. We did a test on a new test user I created on the system.

However, it does make noise and vibrate, and sometimes I can hear Siri if I ask her a question, but it takes a while for her to respond. Sometimes, I can also hear my FaceTime calls going off, but I can not answer them. My on/off button does not work, so I will not be able to hold down the on/off button and the home button. Whenever I try to plug my phone in, it makes the noise that it usually makes when I plug it in, but nothing happens. When I was last on it, which was a few hours ago, it was fine and then I turned it off and I have not got it to work since. Also, when I didn't have it plugged in, it got really hot and other times it was cooled off. When I tell Siri to make FaceTime calls, she tells me that she is, but nothing happens. This has never happened to me before, and I would like to know if it has happened to anyone else, or if they have heard about it happening to someone before. Is there any causes as to why this could happen and is there a way that I can help make sure that's this does not happen again? I would like to not have to get a new phone, so does anyone have any suggestions on what I could use to get my phone back to normal? A friend of mine suggested to leave it on the charger for a while, but it did not work and my phone heated up. I hope you guys can help me. :) \n\nA: It ever happened to my iPhone 5 twice. All I did was left my iPhone until the battery drained off. Then I charged my phone the next day (or when you think the battery is drained already). It worked well afterwards. If it doesn't work for you, you should take to Apple repair shop. Hope it can work for you!\n", "Q: See hundreds of installed font quickly Back on Mac OS 9 I used to have a great font browsing tool that allowed me to preview hundreds of fonts very quickly. Each font would only take up one line of text and everything was on the same page.\nIt could take some time to launch but you could simply scroll through all these lines to see every font very quickly.\nI have been using FontBook for a long time but I'm not sure if there's a way to do this with FontBook... or with a font browsing app.\n\nA: You could simply fire up an iWork app, select some text, and browse through the font list in Keynote, Pages or whatever app. They only render the font’s name in the font itself, though, not arbitrary text you type in.\n", "Q: How to find icloud ID to activate my iphone I don't know what I did but...\ncatch 22 I can't activate my iphone because I can't remember my icloud ID which I have stored in my iphone  I know my password but that does me no good???\n\nA: Do you mean an Apple ID, right?

Can iPhone play Opus music files? Nothing found on the web or here.\nhttps://duckduckgo.com/?q=can+iphone+play+opus&ia=web\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=opus\n\nA: Update Nov 2017:\nOpus is now included in iOS 11.\niOS 11 and Android Spearhead Universal Support For Opus Audio Codec, MP3’s Overdue Successor\n\nJudging by this conversation on the Apple forums, it seems unlikely an iPhone can use the format directly.\n\nSince Opus is not compatible with most popular players and devices so far, it's absolutely impracticable, no matter directly play Opus files on Windows Media Player, Android, PS3, Xbox 360 and iTunes or sync Opus to iPhone, iPod, iPad via iTunes, or edit these Opus in iMovie and QuickTime.\nUnder the circumstances, the best solution is to convert Opus to MP3 and other more compatible audio formats in order to play or edit Opus in the above popular players and devices.\n\nOne of the posters mentioned that Adapter (freeware) can convert then to a playable format, MP3, AAC etc.\n\nA: Yes, apps on iPhone can play .opus files, but you'll still have to use a 3rd party player on macOS to play the file. That just means that Apple's QuickTime still doesn't support the format as of January 2, 2019. \nThis format is used in common apps such as WhatsApp to communicate audio recordings between users.  Support for this codec has been present in some common (and awesome) A/V software like VLC for several years while some of the biggest players in the hardware/software game are still only adding rudimentary support.  There are conversion utilities/applications readily available on the web - just do a simple google search to find what you're looking for.\n", "Q: 16GB 1600mhz vs 16GB 1866mhz RAM for Macbook Pro 13\" mid 2012 Want To Ask\ni did geekbench test on 2 types of RAMs on my  MBP 13\" 2.9ghz i7 mid 2012.\n1-Crucial 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR3L-1600 SODIMM \n32bit test\n2913\nSingle-Core Score\n6105\nMulti-Core Score\n64 bit test\n3132\nSingle-Core Score\n6754\nMulti-Core Score.\n2-Kingston HyperX Impact Black 16GB(8GBx2) 1866MHz DDR3L Laptop RAM (Low Voltage - HX318LS11IB/8)\n32bit test\n2715\nSingle-Core Score\n5814\nMulti-Core Score.\n64bit test\n2986\nSingle-Core Score\n6975\nMulti-Core Score\nso i would like to know any opinion about RAM is better for my Macbook Pro 13\" 2.9ghz i7 mid 2012??\n\nA: 2012 MacBook Pro 13\" specification states that it supports 1600 MHz RAM. So, Kingston modules do not have an advantage, as the memory will run at 1600 MHz.\nPurely, from numbers point of view, your geekbench results point to Crucial being faster. However, I suspect it is due to variance. You can try to rerun the same test several times and see how the scores differ from run to run.\nBoth Kingston and Crucial are well known brands with low failure rates. And unless you are going to put your computer under heavy load, memory intensive constant tasks, you will not notice any difference between the two in terms of speed. So, if I were you, I would buy whichever is cheaper.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use a Mac Mini with a laptop monitor? I want to buy a Mac Mini and I want to use it with my laptop monitor. My laptop is Lenovo Y510P. I searched some documents for using Mac Mini with laptop monitor and I only found a solution to using with an Apple laptop unfortunately.\nMy laptop doesn't have a video input but can I use the Mac Mini via an external video capture devices etc? Or is there a way to use Mac Mini with laptop monitor?\n\nA: VNC\nYou can use VNC on your Mac Mini to show the screen on your Windows or Linux laptop:\n\nVNC is an abbreviation of Virtual Network Computing. VNC is a common protocol that allows computers to both share and to offer control over the network. Using VNC you can connect to and see your computer remotely; great for remote working or helping a relative perform tricky tasks without needing to be in the same location.\nMac OS X includes a built-in free VNC server.

I'm not positive which one did the trick as I did them both in between an attempt to run bootcamp. These are the things I did in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install reFind... doing this added the missing EFI partition that was mentioned I was missing in the comments for this question.\n\n*Use the reFind partition editor to fix the Master Boot Record (MBR) table for my HDD. This partition editor can be found on the reFit menu (launched by choosing the reFit option on the reFind menu)\n\n\nAfter this, I launched mac, started boot camp, and the 'status: partitioning disk' message/bar restarted and then it was able to finish partitioning and I have since installed Windows successfully. Any hints on why this finally worked would be much appreciated!\nAlso, something to note is that after I installed reFind, my partition table (output to diskutil list) was: \n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n2:                  Apple_HFS MAC HDD                 500.1 GB   disk0s2\n\n", "Q: Kensington Trackball Works, how to scroll horizontally with Trackball or Auto Scroll I have a Kensington Expert Mouse on the Mac running the latest 1.3 drivers.\nThere still is no option to use the trackball to in addition to scroll vertically also scroll horizontally.

I used to use that all the time and they have since gotten rid of it.\nThe workaround I've been able to come up with is to program a button to simply type the shift key (I use the two bottom button combination).

How can I change the Mac terminal to make as identical as possible to the Ubuntu terminal?\nedit: A similar post Can I make my Mac OS X Terminal color items according to syntax, like the Ubuntu terminal? does not answer my question for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*It does not tell me what background color Ubuntu uses or if the colors given are the default colors that Ubuntu uses.\n\n*Gives me a multi line command prompt (I really prefer the single line prompt)\n\n*It talks about syntax highlighting I am interested in other changes as well such as copying and pasting behavior.\n\n*Does not properly explain how export PS1=\"\\n$C_LIGHTGREEN\\u$C_DARKGRAY@$C_BLUE\\h $C_DARKGRAY: $C_LIGHTYELLOW\\w\\n$C_DARKGRAY\\$$C_DEFAULT functions. \n\n\n*\n\n*From what I can tell in changes the prompt so that newline is light green, user appears next in dark gray and blue(?), host name appears in darkgrey, something else is light yellow(?), current working directory is darkgray and a newline is made (?) $(or # for root) is a default color.\n\n*Looking at this website asnwers a bit of my question.\n\n\n\nA: You'll need to change the shell settings to match your current Ubuntu terminal. Simple way would be to make your local .bashrc match the one used by Ubuntu (see here for an example of the Ubuntu default .bashrc.) You can either plug the settings in to a .bashrc file for all shells, or use a .bash_profile in your home folder to set Terminal preferences for login shells. This post has more details on how to create these files.\nLast, I imagine your Ubuntu terminal sessions aren't on a white screen - Adding in the xterm-color settings will provide colored text, but won't affect the background color. I generally start by making the \"Homebrew\" Terminal display setting the default in OS X, to get black background + green text, then tweak from there.\nPoke around in the other settings you have for yourself on Ubuntu - any default keyboard shortcuts, etc. will be in .profile or .bash_profile, and those can be copied into the same folder on your Mac. If you want to get really picky you can even install Ubuntu Mono (the default Ubuntu terminal font) on your Mac, and use it as the default font for Terminal.\n\nA: I believe the previous answer doesn't help in ls coloring. Because ls uses dircolors -b on Ubuntu to generate the color codes, and the output of that utility doesn't work for Mac at all.\nI have posted my take to get as close to Ubuntu colors (as of 2023) as it gets on Mac in a parallel thread.\n", "Q: Calendar keeps losing custom event to launch a program. Is this a bug? I had a daily event set up in calendar that runs a particular program.  Recently it stopped running this (possibly after an upgrade?).  Took me a few days or weeks to notice (because it happens automatically).  I go into the event and see no alert is set.\nI create a new event and add my custom alert to open a file that is a program:\n\n\nand then when I click back into the event I can see that no alert is present!\n\nIs this a new bug or am I doing something wrong?\nI am on OSX El Capitan 10.11.5 and Calendar Version 8.0 (2092.3).\n\nA: You are using a calendar that is connected to iCloud. Since iCloud calendars do not support file opening events, it cannot save to iCloud and then it cancels. Make a new LOCAL calendar that is not on iCloud but based on your own computer, then you can do a file based event on the computer based calendar.\n\nA: I had the same problem - couldn't figure out how to create a local calendar, because any I created got moved to the iCloud section. The fix in my case was to go to iCloud preferences, uncheck Calendar syncing, then go back to the Calender app. Now I could create a local (i.e. On My Mac\") calendar. Furthermore, this calendar persisted as On My Mac even after I went back to iCloud prefs and turned Calendar syncing back on.\nDon't forget to select your newly created On My Mac calendar when you create the event that launches a file!\n", "Q: How can I see progress in BackupLoupe? I'm relieved to discover that BackupLoupe exists, probably for the same reason everyone else is: Time Machine Restores correct system errors but wipe all recent data from your hard drive. BackupLoupe allows you to put it back.\nUnfortunately BackupLoupe does not automatically merge the contents of a folder that you want to restore - you have to either delete the existing folder you're restoring or restore millions of files individually. Obviously, merge is what everyone wants (but we don't get it). This should be a function of Time Machine (but that is a product from the software makers at Apple.)\nBackupLoupe is a buggy program, and I find that after a comparison, I need to restart the program and scan a backup just to see any changes. Also, things simply disappear from the screen. Nevertheless, it is probably our ONLY option to combat the ruthless simplicity of Time Machine.\nBut I at least want to know if a process has begun in BackupLoupe, and see a percentage, timer and list of what is happening, preferably a check mark next to each restored file, subfolder and folder in real time. IS there a setting that allows me to monitor what is happening? Are there are settings that make this vital tool work intuitively that I should know about?\nThanks\n\nA: I like to use BackupLoupe to locate the files I want to restore and not actually do the lifting.\nOnce you have a Finder window - you could use Finder to show you the progress of the copy or even use a tool custom designed for syncing folders that can be paused / stopped / resumed.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com does file merges primarily but it's also nice for syncing folders\n\n*https://www.panic.com/transmit/ is another wizard level program for managing files and copying them - it's also not exclusively for local copies but does that well.\n\n*I like to use BackupLoupe to locate the files I want to restore and not actually do the lifting.\n\n\nSo in a nutshell, get a file moving tool and let BackupLoupe do the indexing / searching is my advice.\n", "Q: iCloud Photo Sharing extremely slow I am trying to create a shared album in iCloud, containing about 750 photos and 50 short videos.\nUsing Photos both on iOS 9 and El Capitan, the process of adding the photos to the album is extremely slow.\nOn iOS, when I try to share the photos I am shown a modal \"preparing\" dialogue that doesn't seem to progress.\nOn my Mac (which does not have \"Optimize Storage\" enabled) the sharing progress bar fills slowly, then stays mostly filled for a very very long time, while heavily using the CPU. \nGiven the amount of network traffic that is caused by the request, I assume that Photos is trying to download/re-upload each image. \nGiven that the photos are already stored on iCloud, I would expect to be able to share the photos instantly, as I can do with Google Photos.\nIs this the expected behaviour or am I suffering from an abnormal issue?\nEDIT: added photo of iOS dialog\n\nAdding one photo to a new shared album works ok, but as I add more photos in one go the time taken scales up quickly.\n\nA: What happens during the Preparing step is Photos first downloads all the photos/videos being shared (so this step can be skipped on a device that holds full-resolution copies of your photos). You also see this step when trying to share a photo by email or iMessage, with Optimize Storage enabled.\nThen it will downsample photos to 2048 pixels on the long edge (5400 pixels for panoramas), and videos to 720p. This step takes place locally, consumes a lot of CPU power, and may take a very long time, particularly with videos. That would explain why you can share a single photo fairly quickly, but then the progress indicator seems stuck once you select everything. I’m almost positive it’s your videos incurring this extra processing time.\nFinally, Photos will re-upload everything to a separate iCloud server, which is exempt from your storage quota. However, each shared album is limited to 5000 photos/videos combined, with videos themselves limited to 5 minutes long.\nDo note that these steps appear to occur asynchronously. However you’ll still ultimately be bottlenecked by either your CPU or Internet upload speed.\nI would advise you to do this from your Mac, if possible. Not only can you leave it plugged in overnight, prevent it from sleeping, and continue using it while it’s doing its thing, the resampling step should be much faster with your Mac’s CPU than with your iPhone’s (generally speaking).\n\nA: As you can read here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7609292?start=0&tstart=0 the pictures are downloaded firstly to your computer to be later compressed and re uploaded to a different server, which only allows 2048 pixel width images. \n", "Q: How to find out the wifi setting of a connected wifi network in MacBook Pro?

To me, it seems as if this should be possible. With a normal app, you can go to 'Purchased' and re-download any previously downloaded apps. \nIs it possible to do the same with an enterprise app which was not downloaded through the app store?\n\nA: No, if it was not originally purchased/downloaded from the Apple App Store, you will not find it in the Purchased section.\nUsually, enterprise apps are distributed from that company's 'app store' only.  If they are deleted from your iOS device, you can revisit the company app store and re-download the app again.

Running osx Catalina 10.15.4 and scaled the resolution to 3000*1692 equivalent i believe the config screen says looks like \"3000*1692\" and give the warning \"using a scaled resolution may effect performance\". i use a great app from VMI Studios \"Temp Monitor V1.4.2\" to keep an eye an everything on my mac temp of every piece of hardware on this mbp. it's also my fan controller.\ni use my machine as a test lab running 3 vm's most of the time. as i did yesterday.. only thin i did notice was my machine running a bit hotter then usual. But this is also due to the old cooling paste on this machine. i have read that people did have good results re pasting older macbooks so i bought sum Kryonaut thermal Grizzly and as soon as i gather enough courage to completely disassemble this machine i'm going to apply it.\nTo sum up.. up-scaling to \"3008* 1692\" and watching 1080p youtube and doing day to day tasks so no gaming, no graphics design just sum sys admin work studying reading is perfectly fine.. reason i'm going to get the second model of LG is that it's cheaper then getting a 30-inch 2560*1600 the native resolution this macbook pro can run without up-scaling. problem is i know i'm going to be upgrading my computer so it's not logical to pay more for less desk space in my use case.\nJust wanted to share this might help anyone thinking of doing the same.\ngood luck,.\n", "Q: HDD corruption after power cutoff Yesterday a breaker tripped in the same room as my Mac Pro 1,1 running Yosemite (Hacked boot.efi.) All other machines powered up but this one. Attempting to mount via Target Disk Mode timed out, so I pulled the drive and put it in a sled so I could access it with my MacBook. First attempt was with Disk Utility, it failed (Who'd have guessed?) I then popped open a terminal window and ran a fsck_hfs -r -d and it appeared to be doing work, but failed to fix the issue. I tried running it several times but to no success. \nPosted is my log file, which is odd. There are 2 files which have no thread records, and when fsck_hfs attempts to make them, it returns OK, but appears to have failed on account of it re-attempting multiple times. Anyone else have issues with inconsistent thread counts, and if so, how did you go about a repair?

freely available tools for so long, I gave up and purchased DiskWarrior. Fixed the thread-count issue on the first pass. It's a shame that this wasn't easily possible with non-commercial tools, but DiskWarrior does it's job extraordinarily well.\n", "Q: Run AppleScript Applet at boot I am a complete amateur at this. How would I get this AppleScript to work on my Macbook Pro on boot? What steps do I need to take? What does the script do?\n\nA: If you want it to launch at login (which I don't recommend, and I'll explain why), add it to your login options. To do this, open System Preferences -> Users and Groups. Select your name in the sidebar, then select Login Items in the main pane.\n\nNext, hit the + button and navigate to wherever you have TardisGlow and hit add.\n\nNow it will launch whenever you login.\nHowever, I'm not sure I would recommend this, for one simple reason: the way the script works (though completely harmless) is by dimming and raising the backlight, which will be extremely distracting if you want to use your computer. Admittedly, as configured, it only runs for 7.2 seconds before resetting it to normal (after playing some sounds)–but if you want to keep running that effect, it will need to keep running.\nIf, however, you decide that you do want to have it continually run, you'll need to change the line repeat 4.5 times to repeat in the script. To do so, go to the app, right click it, and hit show package contents. Next, navigate to Contents/Resources/Scripts/main.scpt and open it. Then, change the line as noted before and save. \n", "Q: How can I remotely view my Apple TV from my computer? I would like to be able to view my Apple TV from my computer remotely (similar to Smart View app by Samsung, but in reverse) so I can use an automation tool. What tools are available that allow me to accomplish this?\n\nA: If you can Jailbreak it (basically atv2 at the time of writing) I believe you can install the Veency package and connect via VNC\n", "Q: How can I use different facebook account to sign in a game on iphone? I used a facebook account to sign in a game on my iphone ( the game is \"top eleven\"). Now I want to change the account and use another one because I have more friends in 2nd account.\nAlready used 2nd account's username and password in setting but didn't work, even deleted facebook app and installed it again and signed in with 2nd one but when I open the game it runs with 1st one.\nhow can I solve this problem ?\nthanks \n\nA: It’s because you are also signed in on Facebook in Safari browser.\niPhone first looks for Facebook login in safari before looking for it in the Facebook app.\nLog out of Facebook in Safari browser. \nThe game will then use your Facebook app to determine which account to use for login \n\nA: You need to change the Facebook login in the app itself. There should be Settings somewhere within the game, and the option to \"Log Out\" of Facebook. Once you have logged out, you will need to link it to your 2nd Facebook account by logging into it - again - within the app itself.\n\nA: Or you have to delete the app, install it again and sign in with your Facebook Account.\n", "Q: Extention enable PHP In my PHP.ini, the extensions are not uncommented.\n;extension=php_curl.so\n\nBut in phpinfo(), I can see that curl (by example) is enable and in my code I can use it.\n\nBut I can't understand why curl is enable, someone can help me?\nMy conf :\n\n\n*\n\n*PHP 5.5.34\n\n*OS X El Capitan 10.11.5\n\n\nA: Extensions can be loaded into PHP two ways. Either statically at compile time, or dynamically at run time.\nStatically loaded extensions are included in the PHP binary at compile time, and does not require an extension= line in php.ini to load it.\nDynamically loaded extensions are not included in the PHP binary, but are saved as dynamic link libraries (.so files on OS X). They require a extension= line in php.ini to load it at run time.\nThe short answer to your question: Your cURL extension is statically compiled with the PHP executable, therefore it works even though you haven't got a extension=php_curl.so line in php.ini.\n", "Q: External Hard Drive Size Problem I recently bought a 4 TB Seagate Desktop Expansion external hard drive. However, after formatting it with Disk Utility the device still says 4 TB but the capacity says 1.8 TB. What is going on?\n\nA: Did you completely wiped it via the Apple Disk utilities and formatted it Mac Journaled? It might look like you kept a partition of the disk (FAT32 or NTFS)\n", "Q: iCloud Two Factor Authorisation doesn't show code on trusted devices I activated the Two Factor Authorisation at iCloud. Now, when I try to sign in at some Apple Service, I am getting the a message that a message was sent to my trusted devices with a code I have to enter.\nBut, nothing happened. Never. I have to click on \"Try again\" and choose \"Send Message to PHONE_NUMBER\"\nAfter that, a message with the code gets send to my iPhone, I type in the number and it works.\nBut, nowhere the code is getting displayed. Neither on my Mac or my iPhone. It just works via Message.\n\nA: There are a view things you should check:\n1) Are both devices marked as 'trusted' in icloud.com (login, go to settings and see 'my devices'.\n2) You have to be signed in with both devices with your iCloud account. Did you check both are correctly activated.\n", "Q: Can I downgrade my iOS version to 7.x? Can I downgrade my iOS to 7.x? I need to do it for app testing.\n\nA: Due security reasons, there is no method to downgrade.\n\nA: Apple has full control what releases are available to install and downgrade. iOS 7 is not downgrade able unless you jailbreak your iPhone (not recommended!). \nYou can check if Apple still allows to roll-back your previous iOS version at IPSW . Click on your device and see what versions are green (allowed by Apple) to install.\n", "Q: Does Apple allows restricting In-App Purchase DLC Non-Consumable Content to one device? I have been reading the review guideline: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\nI see section about for subscription its has to be available for all iOS devices of a single user:\nContent subscriptions using IAP must last a minimum of 7 days and be available to the user from all of their iOS devices.\nBut does that apply to Non-Consumable Content as well?\nI am worry Apple will reject our app because of this reason.\n\nA: You are afraid Apple will reject your app because you use non-consumable content on only one device? \nOne of my project has in-app purchases only for 1 device. The app is already 6 years continuously reviewed and successfully deployed. Believe me, this is not an issue aslong you are not using a subscription. \nThe only problem you are facing is someone can buy the DLC also on a other device and it will auto unlock as it has already been purchased with the same Apple ID. There are ways to prevent this by securing your app via a database.\n", "Q: What is the performance penalty of using RansomWhere.app? As many might be aware OS X is now potential victim of ransomware exploits.  So far we have one example only, First Mac-targeting ransom ware hits Transmission users, researchers say, but chances are that these exploits will increase.\nI recently read about RansomWhere.app that might be effective in protecting your mac from ransom ware attacks, by monitoring the file system for the creation of encrypted files (and blocking the process doing the encryption).  My understanding is that the developer(s) of this program are highly qualified and whatnot but (and here is the questions):\nDoes anyone use this program?  What is the performance penalty?\nI ask because I have multiple redundant backups, so a ransom ware attack would force me to wipe my disk and use one of my backups (losing a day or less of files at most)?  Multiple redundant backups are needed anyway, so what is the net advantage of using ransomware defeating software?\n\nA: I have used it for the past few weeks on my 12\" Retina MacBook and noticed no impact on performance.\n", "Q: Will a USB VGA Video Adapter Work on MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012) Well I'm attempting to get 2 monitors working on a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012).But I'mm so nervous that i will waste my money on the adapter,and i use to play games on a Mac.\nSo, I think it was easier 2 have double monitor for gaming. I'm going provide a picture of the adapter in question\n\n\nA: Yes, it will work.  There's no reason it shouldn't.  But, You have a Mid 2012 which has a Thunderbolt port which is compatible with mini Display Port (mDP).  \nWhy not use an Apple Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter?\n\nThis will be going from a digital video signal to an analog video signal.  It's just my opinion that going from video to video is better than going from USB to video.\nAs far as \"worrying\" about whether it will work or not work, if you buy from a reputable seller like Amazon, or even eBay with their \"Buyer Protection\" you shouldn't have to worry that your item won't work.\n", "Q: OS X Finder not showing correct file size - why and how \"fix\" it? I have a file that is 237153620 bytes long. Interestingly, Finder shows it as 237.2 MB. But we all know that's not true. Obviously it divides size in bytes with factor of 1000 (base 10) to get size in megabytes, instead of 1024 (base 2). Why is this so?\nSome screenshots:\n\n\nEdit: It was mentioned that switchDiskSizeBase could be used to switch between base 10 and base 2 file size, but it seems broken in El Capitan. (code sign failed when launching) Any idea on alternatives?\n\nA: This is not a bug, so there is nothing to fix.  Apple (and pretty much every other computer company) moved over to base 10 to avoid confusion with the standards that we have with the metric system.\nIn metric:\n    10 mm   = 1 centimeter\n    1000 cm = 1 meter\n    1000 m  = 1 kilometer\n\nIn base 2:\n    1 byte  = 8 bits\n    1 KB    = 1024 bytes\n    1 MB    = 1024 kilobyte or 10242 = 1,048,576\n\nSo, in pretty much every other industry \"Mega\" meant 1 million of something, in computers it meant \"1 million and 48 thousand, five hundred seventy six of something\"\nIt wasn't until around 1998 that the IEC, IEEE and other standards organization wanted to address this ambiguity.  They clarified it by coming up with the \"binary prefix\" for the unit symbol.  \n1 Kilobyte = 1,000 bytes.\n1 Kibibyte = 1,024 bytes\n \nThis was done for the sole purpose of making things easier to understand as they related to computers.  \nIt's very easy to understand (using your file example) that you have a\n\n\n*\n\n*0.237MB file\n\n*237.2KB file\n\n*2,272KB file\n\n\nI don't have to break out a calculator to to do base 2 conversion.  It's very easy for me to understand that my 1/2 TB hard drive is 500GB and not 465.66GB\n", "Q: iTunes Store is unavailable Recently I am downloading movies from iTunes Store and books from iBooks Store. But one annoying thing that I've ran into these days are The Movie/iBooks store is unavailable. This is happening for a week now. I've checked the Apple's Service Availability Page but it says that everything is available. Here are screenshots:\n\n\nThis is happening on an iPhone 6s and iPad Pro if it does matter. My Apple ID country is China and my location is in China.\nThanks\n\nA: China blocked the iTunes store and iBook store due to it's political issues with Apple.\n[Update] VPN doesn't help, it's account based not location based.\n", "Q: iterm2 tab and window titles remove current process information I've found tons of places that describe how to get the window title and tab titles to reflect the current directory (relative to my home directory).\nHere is what is in my .zshrc:\nprecmd() {\n  # sets the tab title to current dir\n  CURRENT=$(print -P %3~)\n  echo -ne \"\\e]1;~/${CURRENT##*/}\\a\"\n}\n\nWorks like a charm when I cd around. However, when I run a command-- rails console, for example--that process name replaces the current directory information in both my window and tabs titles. This is unhelpful as I've got lots of tabs open, several in different directories (which represent different rails applications)and don't really care what process is running as much as where I am.\nIs there a way to configure either iterm2 or zsh to NOT change the titles to the current process name?\nthanks!\n\nA: In my .zshrc I uncommented the line:\nDISABLE_AUTO_TITLE=\"true\"\n\nThis keeps the process from being put into the title because it's not changing the title automatically. The precmd function is called regardless of this setting so in there I change the titles manually.\n", "Q: How can I tell if the fans are operating correctly on my MacBook Pro 17\" (2010)? My Mid-2010 17\" MBP seems to be running warmer than normal recently; I've read that fan failure is not unheard of on systems of this age, but I don't know how to verify whether one or both fans is operating correctly.\nI have removed the cover and checked that there is no obvious buildup of lint, etc., in the fans and they spin freely.\n\nA: You can use the freeware application Macs Fan Control to monitor both your current fan speed and your internal temperature. It also allows you to set a minimum speed for your fan(s), which you could use for stress testing your fans by temporarily jacking up the speed, or for permanently increasing the minimum fan speed somewhat if you feel like your Mac is running a little too hot.\nIt also has a diagnostics mode, which I haven't used yet, but which could be useful in your situation.\n\nA: Another 3rd party utility, iStat Menus, gives you a way to see all the readings of your system's internal temperature sensors as well as the fan speeds (among many other things) and what might be causing the system to run hot- including potentially runaway background processes that could be eating CPU cycles.\n", "Q: 'Choose file' sidebar options disappeared When you go to a website with a file uploader you click on a choose file and a pop up window appears with a sidebar similar to what you have in your standard finder window, however recently all of the options like Documents, Downloads, Pictures etc are no longer present, now I can only see ak52-macbook and remote disk. In standard finder windows I have all my standard folders plus custom ones that I added. I made sure in finder preferences that all of them are displayed.\nI could not find anything in the finder or chrome browser preferences regarding this so here is my question, how do I display all of those folder in the pick file to upload pop up sidebar?\n\nA: The kind of items in your case hidden are named Favourites. To show them, go to a site where you can upload a file (e.g. https://encodable.com/uploaddemo/) and then click on \"Choose File\", like you said. When you are prompted to upload something, just hover your cursor on the Favourites line, located on the top of the sidebar. A \"Show\" button will be shown (no irony, at all). Click it and all of the items will re-appear. Done!\nIf you have any more issues with this, feel free to comment.\n", "Q: keys for commands for using Ubuntu in Virtualbox in Mac I have installed Ubuntu in virtualbox in Mac. \ni open firefox in ubuntu, and want to find some word in a webpage by ctrl-f which I normally do without mac and virtualbox, but it invokes something else i.e. asking me if I want to make the ubuntu window full screen. what key shall I type?\nalso I will use emacs a lot in ubuntu in virtualbox, how shall I change keys?\nThanks.\n\nA: By default, the Control key shouldn't be getting confused in VirtualBox unless you specifically set it otherwise; both left and right Control keys should behave correctly when the VM is in context.\nHowever, it does sound like you might have hit the LeftCommand-F combination which may be configured in VirtualBox as \"tell VM to go full screen\". I believe typically the left Command is the \"host key\" and operates as it would on OSX for things like hiding windows, quitting applications, etc. The Command key on the right of the keyboard is probably being passed down as the Alt or Windows key to the VM.\nAll that being said, it sounds like you're hitting Command instead of Control and you're using the left instead of the right. These settings can be changed in the settings / preferences of VirtualBox if you want to modify it.\n", "Q: Using ANT+ accessories in the iWorld I'd like to track my fitness more automatically than I do now, because now it's not automatic, so I don't do it.\nIn particular I'm interested in getting an ANT+ odometer for my bike. I understand that the iPhone can read these, but it is not clear whether that means it reads it into the Health app, or I still have to use some 3rd party solution. Does anyone know of a meter that goes directly into Health?\nAnd then there's the Apple Watch. Can the Watch talk to any of these devices directly? That would certainly be wonderful because then I wouldn't have to carry my phone on bike rides.\n\nA: No iOS device has native ANT+ communication support built in. For the iPhone 4 & 4s, Wahoo makes a 30 pin ANT+ dongle. Newer devices can also utilize this dongle with a 30 pin to Lightning adapter.\nhttp://www.wahoofitness.com/devices/wahoo-key-16.html\nOnce your setup with the ANT+ dongle, you'll need a 3rd party app to read the data. Some, like Strava, can push data to the iOS Health app:\nhttps://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216917527-Health-App-Integration-iPhone\n\nA: There are also devices which act as ANT+ to iOS bridges wirelessly without a dongle, such as the 4iiii's Viiiiva Heart Rate Strap.\nhttp://4iiii.com/product/viiiiva/\nThis should let you use other ANT+ devices with your iPhone at the same time.\n", "Q: Upgrading jailbroken phone while maintaining tweaks using iFile I was just curious if I copied all of the contents of iFile from like the root folder, and then upgraded my iphone's ios version, rejailbroke my iphone, and redownloaded iFile, if I copied the contents into the new iFile would it basically be like it saved my previous jailbreak?\nI know the current iOS version doesn't have a jailbreak out, I'm just curious if per say this would work?\n\nA: \n@IronCraftMan No it wouldn't work\n\nIs correct you would be better off making a backup with iTunes and using some tool to save your SHSH blobs so you can downgrade, there are some jailbreak backup utilities but I cannot vouch for the validity or security of them.\n", "Q: What is the keystroke to switch between windows in a guest os (Ubuntu) in VirtualBox? Using Ubuntu installed as normal operating system, I can switch between windows by using alttab.\nI installed Ubuntu in a VirtualBox VM with a MacBook Pro/OS X as host. In the Ubuntu guest, alttab doesn't switch between windows. How shall I change the keys to do that?\n\nA: You have to hit the Left COMMAND key once and the mouse switches to finder and other apps. If you click inside of virtualbox it activates the virtual machine which in this case is ubuntu. (This assumes that you are running in the default mode which captures on click). It's confusing because it's displayed with a left arrow, but what they really mean is the left COMMAND key. (The one that looks like it has a four leaf clover on it).\nThe key looks like this: ⌘ It's also known as the Apple key.\nThis key is on either side of the space bar. Each works the same. So for example if you wanted to print a document in Windows you could use the keyboard shortcut CONTROL + \"P\" (Press the control key, continue to hold it while pressing the \"P\" key), on a Mac they use a different key - it's the COMMAND Key not the CONTROL key so you need to press ⌘ and the letter \"P\" to print. So if you know several keyboard shortcuts for Microsoft Windows, just try them on the Mac but instead of using the CONTROL key substitute the COMMAND key.\nThe CONTROL key, SHIFT key, OPTION key, and COMMAND key (or Apple key as some like to call it), are all what's called modifier keys.

Much to my horror, my MacBook screen cracked the other day and had to be replaced.  I took the machine to an Apple Store and a Genius checked it in for repair.\nThe Genius said that they would, perfectly understandably, have to run diagnostics software after the hardware was replaced in order to satisfy themselves that everything was installed correctly.\nLess understandably, he insisted that this diagnostics software (which is simply testing hardware functionality) must run from a user account in my installation of OSX—rather than, say, the recovery partition, or a wholly different installation of OSX (eg one they keep on an external drive from which they can boot if they so choose).\nFortunately, I had already enabled the FileVault 2 guest account (the one that boots to its own limited environment) and the Genius said this would suffice.  Sadly, now the repair has completed, I have received a call complaining that it is insufficient.  They are also refusing to return the machine to me without the diagnostics having been run, even though I have volunteered to take full responsibility for the consequences.\nSince I have a backup of the whole computer, I suggested that they just wipe it and reinstall OSX, in order that they can then do whatever they want: I'll just restore once I get it home.  They insist that they're unable to do this without me first unlocking the drive (which obviously is not true—not least because they would solve this for customers who genuinely have lost both their passwords and their recovery keys, but also because very simple instructions are given here).\nAnyway, I'm not giving out my password (which is also my key to many online resources) over the phone to a complete stranger, even if they do work for Apple.  I would be willing to go to the store to tap it in for them, but it's out of my way and the diagnostics apparently take up to 5 hours to run—so I'll end up having to make a second journey to pick up the machine once they're complete.\nIn all, they are making this so inexcusably painful—and frankly I'm more inclined to make a point: go there, buy an external HDD, install OSX onto it and boot that before returning it for a full refund!  (If they insist on booting from my internal drive, I could just copy the encrypted partition to the external drive, then reinstall on the internal, then copy back once all is done).\nIs there any way that I can persuade them to stop being so stupid, and save us all a ton of wasted time and effort?\n\nA: In my experience they don't insist anything except you ensure you have a backup of the data should service erase it.\nIf they don't have your password, they can boot to another OS to test. If the issue is your software, they won't be able to advise - but even knowing you have OK hardware will help you then finish the troubleshooting.\nPerhaps your frustration with the repair is coloring your recollection? It would take them 15 minutes to wipe your drive and test things and if you aren't in a position to fulfill that portion of the repair agreement that's causing the delay and both sides regret entering into the agreement that wasn't \"by the book\". Keep in mind if they have to take hours to work around your not having a backup - other customers are delayed in their repair and maybe that along with the high volume of repairs that happen at the end of the school year.\nPerhaps the time quote was incorporating the backlog and not that your machine itself was taking that long on the test bench.\n\nA: *\n\n*filevault is a security protocol. it blocks anyone else from using your OS and your system.

Assuming that the four or six digit unlock code to the phone is in the Keychain, where exactly do I find it? I see my passwords for apps but not the unlock code for the phone\n\nA: The unlock code (passcode) is not stored in the Keychain, so you cannot find it there.\nIn fact, the unlock code is not stored at all on the device. This is by design.\nWhen you enter the unlock code it is used, together with other information, as the passphrase to decrypt an encryption key that is stored on the device. That key then makes it possible for the phone to read your other, sensitive data.\nWithout the user entering the pass code the phone cannot access the encryption key, and thus cannot access your sensitive data.\nFor more details, read page 12 of this document:\nhttps://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf\n", "Q: Enter passcode without touch screen [iTunes] I have an iPhone 5, which has the screen broken, so I can not type the passcode.

I always knew that Mac operating systems had a concept of \"resource forks\" but have just learned that this feature has in fact been deprecated since the arrival of OS X.\nI also just discovered the mdls terminal command that lists metadata.\nDoes some or any of this metadata come from resource forks? If not, where is the metadata stored? Or is the metadata generated each time it's needed?\n\nA: Yes, some of the meta data is stored in so called extended file attributes. The extended file attributes are stored in a named fork.\nSo in essence forks are still very much used on OS X. However, the specific \"resource fork\" as managed by the Resource Manager API is deprecated, as you describe.\nNote that other parts of the metadata can come from a wide range of data sources - some stored on disk, others generated upon import (for example by consulting cloud services when dealing with files stored in iCloud or similar service).\nmdls uses the Spotlight API in order to retrieve the metadata for display. The Spotlight API draws upon sources such as file system data, file system meta data, extended attributes, and many other places.

(Hibernate like Windows PC, ie. save state to disk and fully power down) Please note: Whilst the older question (4 years ago) Do MacBooks have a true \"Hibernate\" option? has answers that show a hibernate option exists for Macs, it doesn't detail how to make your Mac hibernate. Perhaps this is because that answer was sufficient for older machines (Pre-2015 MacBookPro Retina or pre-Yosemite).\nI've been a longtime Windows user and was told Apple's Macs were better. I recently bought a MacBookPro Retina 2015 15\" OS X 10.10 Yosemite (SSD). I have not been able to make it hibernate.\nI have already enabled the hibernate mode number 25 (as can be seen in the settings below).\nI was told that the grey screen with the progress bar upon wakeup indicates the machine was hibernating. I managed to get this grey screen to show up after disabling standby. \nsudo pmset -a standby 0\n\nI was also told I could check what state the machine woke from via the following command:\npmset -g log | grep -i \"wake from\"\n\nI ran the command but it still shows that I have always been waking from Standby. This is the case when waking from both AC and Battery. E.g.\n\nWake from Standby [CDNVA] due to EC.PME/User: Using BATT (Charge:92%) 303 secs\n\nI am assuming that if my machine did indeed hibernate then the grep command should show Wake from 'Hibernate' as opposed to 'Standby'.\nThis makes me wonder if the OS X man pmset command, which brings up the pmset commands manual which is dated 2012 is still valid today. Or perhaps I'm just too new to this.\nI have also tried 2 deep sleep apps/widgets. Both end up putting the MBP to Standby instead of Hibernate.\npmset -g shows the following:\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power          -1*\nAC Power               -1\nCurrently in use:  \n standbydelay         3  \n standby              0  \n halfdim              1  \n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  \n darkwakes            0  \n gpuswitch            2   \n disksleep            10  \n sleep                1  \n autopoweroffdelay    1  \n hibernatemode        25  \n autopoweroff         1  \n ttyskeepawake        1  \n displaysleep         2  \n acwake               0  \n lidwake              1  \n\nPS. Next to sleep it sometimes shows \"(sleep prevented by AddressBookSour)\"\n\nA: \"Sleep\" and \"Hibernate\" on Macs aren't separately choosable. If you sleep a Mac and then leave it asleep on battery until the battery gets low, it will go into \"deep sleep\" (Apple's term, it's essentially Hibernate) and save battery. On older Macs that supported this, you could force hibernate by pulling the battery out, but that's not possible anymore.\nHere's Apple's documentation on Mac sleep, scroll down to the section on \"Special Sleep Modes\". It may be that the \"standby\" indication you are seeing is exactly what you're looking for.\n", "Q: How does Apple Pay work when used with Family Sharing?

I lately took out the hard drive and replaced it with a new one. The old HDD still has OS X installed on it, so basically I did nothing before taking it out. Now I want to access some files on it, so I have a SATA to USB bridge. When I spin up the drive, I can find it in Disk Utility and with diskutil list, plus in the system report under the USB tab.\nHowever, when I connect it, I get a message saying \"The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer\". As a result, I cannot access it in the Finder. I thought that maybe I could boot from the disk because it has OS X installed and all, but the disk is not shown if I access \"Startup Disk\" in the system preferences. It does also not show if I do a reboot and hold down the option key.\nWhere should I go from here? Does anyone know how I can read the contents of the disk? It has never been used for anything else than OS X, as it has been in my Mac since I bought it. Ideally, if I could access the files from within my current installation of OS X, that would be perfect, but whatever works...\nAny help is much appreciated!\nEDIT: The hard drive is a Hitachi 5K750-500 (500GB). It is the standard one that the MacBook was delivered with. The SATA to USB adapter is an ICIDU AI-707944 (\"Hard Disk IDE/SATA to USB 2.0 adapter\").\n\nA: This is as close as I can get to an answer. \nIt would appear the transfer rate for the bridge is 150 MBps (1.5 Gbps). This would indicate conformance to the SATA I standard. The drive has a transfer rate of 300 MBps (3 Gbps). This would indicate conformance to the SATA II standard. Even though the connectors appear to be the same, these two standards are incompatible.\nSome drives have a jumper you can insert to force a SATA II drive to emulate the SATA I standard. The installation instructions for your drive do not indicate this to be true. You may want to examine the drive for possible jumpers or other instructions.\nFor other readers, I will mention that the SATA III standard of 600 MBps (6 Gbps) is compatible with the SATA II standard. The hardware will transfer data at the lesser of the two speeds. \nIt also does not help that I can not find a web site that states the bridge is Mac compatible. All sites only mention Windows compatibility.\n", "Q: Encrypt Time Machine backups without deleting old backups? I'm on Mavericks (10.9.5). I have an external USB drive that I use exclusively for Time Machine backups.\nI just realized that the backups are unencrypted. Is there a way to configure Time Machine to encrypt all backups on this drive, both existing backups and future backups, without erasing the existing backups? \nThis answer indicates that it can be done with \"sparsebundles\", but the post is 5 years old and it seems risky.\nIs there an easier way?\nUpdate: I was mistaken that the backups were unencrypted -- they are actually encrypted. I was fooled because Time Machine preference window includes the word \"encrypted\" below the listed backup disks, but only if the backup disk is plugged in. If the backup disk is not plugged in, Time Machine still lists the backup drive, but it loses the label \"encrypted\". Doh! In Disk Utility, I verified that the disk is encrypted with FileVault2; moreover, OS X prompts me for a password when I plug in the disk. Would still like to know the answer to my original question though.\n\nA: Try at your own risk, but this might work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename the {machine}.sparsebundle to {machine}-unencrypted.sparsebundle\n\n*Show package contents on the sparsebundle\n\n*Make a backup of com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy it to com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist.original\n\n\n*Open com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist\n\n*Set some placeholder value in com.apple-backup.HostUUID, for example seedotoriginal\n\n*Save and close\n\n\nThis should allow you to start making a new encrypted backup. Eventually {machine}.sparsebundle should appear next to the previous one ({machine}-unencrypted.sparsebundle).\nIf you need to restore from the unencrypted backup, you can replace com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist with com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist.original.\nOnce the encrypted backup procedure has completed, you can delete the unencrypted backup sparsebundle (watch out, that may take quite long).\nNote that it might be still possible to fetch the deleted, unencrypted data from the disk. I would recommend getting another disk so that you can properly clean the disk from unencrypted files by writing zeros to it a couple of times, before starting to make encrypted backups on it.\n\nA: One of the above-mentioned links indicates that converting an unencrypted TM backup drive to encrypted form will erase the disk: \"If you previously used a Time Capsule or networked disk for unencrypted backups and want to turn on encryption now, Time Machine must first erase the unencrypted backup before starting an encrypted backup.\"\nfrom Sep'15 version of Choose a backup disk and set encryption options\n", "Q: Cannot read keyboard shortcut text Some of the shortcut titles take up too much space and are truncated.

I managed to reformat it to HFS+ and it is not a corestorage(?) unit. \nHere are screenshots of Disk Utility and the output of diskutil list:\n\n\n\nA: It is because the Linux file system is something that OS X cannot natively read.  The easiest thing to do is to is load up a live Linux CD and change the partition to something OS X can read like ExFAT, or MSDOS.  Once that change has been made, OS X should be able to see it; allowing you to manipulate the partition.\nThe other option is to load up FUSE for OS X which will allow you to read/write ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems.

How can I get this to run on my Mac without having to buy a Mac license?\nSorry, I refuse to pay a subscription for new versions of stuff I bought and it still does the job.\n\nA: The only way to do this is to pay for a Windows license and either dual boot or run in an emulator like Parallels or VMWare. Even if you could get trade for a Mac-specific version of the software you bought, CS3 isn't going to work well on anything other than older versions of OS X.\n\nA: You are not going to get a Mac license of CS3 from Adobe.  The software is 9-10 years old and Adobe has no interest in supporting anything but their CC offerings.\nYour best bet is to see if you can get an old copy from the secondary market like eBay.  \n", "Q: How to reclaim unoccupied disk space with Disk Utility? I have a 2015 MacBook Pro which I tried to set up for dual-booting OS X and Linux. It resulted in some unclaimed free space on my SSD, see screenshot below.\nUnfortunately, I am unable to reclaim that free space: It is grayed out and there seems to be nothing in Disk Utility that I can use to change that.\n\n\nA: The answer is in the screenshot you posted. \"To resize a partition on the selected disk, drag its resize control and click Apply.\" You should be able to just increase the size of the Macintosh HD partition to use the free space. I would recommend backing up first to be safe.\n", "Q: How can I make songs I delete in iTunes also delete songs of synced devices? I have an iPod Touch 5 and and an iPad 1 (don't ask), and I have them both set to sync entire library with iTunes. My library mainly consists of mp3 files stored on my computer, with a few iTunes purchases here or there.\nI like to keep a small library of songs on my devices, but I'm having trouble deleting songs from iTunes, the iPod and the iPad all in one action. If I delete songs off iTunes directly, they stay on the iPodPad until I delete them manually. If I delete songs off only the iPodPad, iTunes puts them back on next time I sync. Is there a way for me to just do this in one action?\nAlso to throw a spanner in the works, a lot of my library songs are no longer on my computer (broken hard drive I haven't gotten around to fixing), but are on my devices. So I can't just simply unsync and then resync the entire music library, since iTunes won't be able to put the broken-hard-drive songs back on the devices.\n(This is kinda irrelevant anyway, I don't think I should have to resync the entire library just to delete a few songs)\nLooked around can't seem to find an answer. This thread is similar, coincidentally no answer too... https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6122231\nTL;DR: How to delete some songs off my entirely-synced iTunes, iPod and iPad without doing them all separately?\n\nA: You have to understand that iTunes is the 'master' in all this, the mobile devices merely 'slaves'.\nAnything you do in iTunes will be reflected in the mobiles when manually synced. \nThe question you linked is for 'what to do when this sync misbehaves?' & is not the same as your situation. \nYour issue really stems from your iTunes library not being complete, removing the simplest option from your choices. Google 'iTunes iPhone copy' for a slew of apps that will transfer songs from the mobile to iTunes, then you can go back to doing it the recommended way - by syncing with iTunes.\n", "Q: Can I factory reset my jailbroken device without upgrading the iOS version? As the title says - I need to do a factory reset on my iPad Mini, but I don't want to upgrade the iOS version while doing it. Is this possible at all or will I have to make do and upgrade iOS as I am factory resetting the device?\n\nA: Yes, use Cydia Impactor. It is available in the Telesphoreo repository (of Cydia), in the Utilities category.\n\nA: If you have made a backup before you made the jailbreak you can do it easily with itunes.\n", "Q: What is this square icon and square + triangle icon in Mac OS X bar?

The card is set to be shared with the members of the family.\nYet everybody has to use my account. Just tried it with my wife, urged her to login as herself (App Store asked her for the credit card). Then she deleted Keynote that was purchased on mine account, clicked Buy and my card was billed additional $20.\nWhat is going on here? I have a big family I don't want everybody to use my account.\nI have the latest everything. The family is set up, we are exchanging photos and videos since it was released. Shared payment method is set up as well and yet it charged me again. \n\nA: You shouldn't need to pay for other family members to download the app, provided you all are running the latest iOS software (I'm not sure if it requires iOS 9), iCloud Sharing should allow purchases to be shared between six family members. See http://www.apple.com/icloud/family-sharing/ for information and https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201088 for help setting it up.\nYou can go to the receipt Apple will send you for the $20 Keynote purchase, and there will be a link in there to report a problem, and you can indicate you did not mean to purchase. It will hopefully result in a refund.\n", "Q: output of the who command I am trying to understand the output of the who command. When I add the -H flag to print the headers, the second column ( the one signifying the users logged in) is titled LINE. I am trying to understand what LINE is. I am logged into my computer twice, according to the who command, but one of the lines is bad. To understand what that means, I would like to know what LINE is.\n\nA: LINE indicates the TTY the process is running on. It is correct about you being logged into your computer twice, as you are logged in once to Cocoa (the OS X desktop), console, full path: /dev/console, and again in the terminal, ttysXXX, full path: /dev/ttysXXX (where \"XXX\" is a three-digit number, starting from 001). \nconsole is Darwin's (OS X kernel) only 'real' TTY, the only one that isn't running in a terminal emulator. console, being the only non-emulated TTY is therefore the only one GUIs can run on. \nThe Apple logo that appears when Cocoa is not running (booting and shut-down) is generated by the kernel except when in verbose mode (start the Mac with the boot argument -V either by holding ctrl-V while booting or running nvram boot-args=\"-v\" as root, however that will make your Mac always boot in verbose mode until you run nvram boot-args=\"\" or clear nvram). \nWhen boot in verbose mode instead of an Apple logo the kernel will log any boot messages and related to /dev/console and anything written to /dev/console will show up on the console and therefore on-screen (since nothing is generating a GUI on it, whether that be Cocoa or the Kernel). The main part of this is how other Unix-like/POSIX systems work. \nI know this answer is kind of crappy but I hope it helps.\n", "Q: Mail crashes permanently - can't open it anymore I have a question and need a bit of help.\nI do have my complete mails on my Mac since 2012. Now today Apple Mail crashes when I opened it.

Long-story-short: When does apple typically update their hardware?\n\nAs a prospective college student, I'd want to get new devices before college begins, but I'd also prefer to have the most up-to-date once I actually begin college.\nColleges that I've looked into typically start in Fall, so I was wondering whether Apple typically updates devices in late-Summer. Or, do they inconveniently update it after most colleges start?\n\nA: There's a comprehensive Buyers' Guide at MacRumors, which provides the average product cycle lengths (and date of latest product update).\n\nA: I too had this question before joining my college. I would suggest you to wait till July and get which ever mac that suits your budget. \nMy personal advice would be to get something which is ultra portable like Macbook pro 13'inch or Air. I DONT think apple will be launching any updated Air anytime soon. \nSo you should get the 13'Inch MacbookPro. \n", "Q: OS X El Capitan suddenly can't open DMG files I am trying to open a DMG file to install an OS X app. I get the error The following disk images couldn't be opened. Invalid Argument. I have tried to open other DMGs that I successfully managed to mount earlier and they are failing too. So the issue is not with the current DMG only. I restarted and that did not make a difference. I ran First Aid in DiskUtility and it reported that my drive was corrupt and needed repairing. I therefore restarted my mac with cmd + r pressed, selected Disk Utility and ran the repair. The repair failed after running for about 5 minutes. I would like to keep the contents of the drive if a solution exists that allows. What should I do now?\nUPDATE:\nI did a time machine backup and let the iMac go get its drive formatted etc. I then attained a macbook air, and did a Restore From Time Machine onto it such that I have back where I left of on the iMac. I then tried to open a new DMG, and the same error came up. I ran First Aid on the mac air drive and it reported it to fine (Ran Successfully).\nThis is therefore not a drive issue right (first aid on the mac air succeeded)? What could it be, and how can I fix it.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and managed to open .dmg files by going into Disk Utility>File>Open Disk Image. Once opened in Disk Utility, Double Click (Right Click) the icon and click show in Finder. Then I could install what I wanted! Hop it works for you!\n\nA: If the Time Machine backup you used to restore the Mac was created after you started noticing problems, maybe whatever drive corruption there was messed up some files that were backed up, leaving you with a good drive but still bad system files. If you have an older Time Machine backup from when the Mac was functioning properly, that might be better to use.\nSeeing as you can still basically use the Mac, I would recommend reinstalling the iMac from a fresh install, and then manually moving over your apps and files or using Migration Assistant to transfer files and settings from the MacBook Air to the iMac.\n", "Q: Is there a way to access a USB-serial port by the device id, not by the tty.* port? On linux USB-serial devices create two aliases to its serial port:\n/dev/tty* and /dev/serial/by-id/<my_usb_device_id>\nIs there a way on OSX to identify a serial port by the USB device id? Both in System Profiler and using ioreg -p IOUSB I can see the id, but that doesn't get me any closer to connecting using that id.\nWe're developing several pieces of hardware and it's a pain to test them as every time I connect a different device I need to verify the serial port configuration of the testing software, because on OSX the tty.* port name depends on the port on my computer, not on the device. The guys running linux are happily using the /dev/serial/by-id/<my_usb_device_id> port to automatically distinguish between the different devices.\n\nA: Actually, you should be able to find the mapping from device ID/serial number to serial port name using ioreg. Try this command:\nioreg -r -c IOUSBHostDevice -l\n\nIt will print all the USB host devices, and it will print out all properties from the subtree of each device. You should be able to find your device on the top level based on its ID or serial number. Once you've found it, you should be able to scan through its subtree, and eventually find an object of class IOSerialBSDClient. This will contain the property IODialinDevice which is what you want.\nIf you then want to do this programmatically, you could add the -a option to the ioreg command, which will output a plist version of the above output. You could then parse this with a library such as plistlib.\nYou might find it helpful to use the IORegistryExplorer app to help visualise this, as the full ioreg output is slightly difficult to read! This is available in XCode's \"Hardware IO Tools\" package which you can find by searching the downloads on the Apple developer site. Here's what it looks like on my device:\n\n\nA: According to my experience, this problem comes from the driver of your serial to uart device. normally you should be able to access the serial port using\nls /dev/tty*.* \n\nand this is the only way to do it. But if your mac does not show it, i installed a program called serial detect, and it detected my board, otherwise use lusb before and after connecting the board, if you don't have it, install it as follows\nbrew install lsusb \n\naccording to my device, i needed the following driver, for my mac 10.13\nhttps://www.silabs.com/community/interface/knowledge-base.entry.html/2017/01/10/legacy_os_softwarea-bgvU\nonce installed, you can find it by\nls /dev/tty*.*\n\nnow you can flash your device or open the serial port. You can access the usb device using the device id using dfu-util, in my case 1d50:6017 is the device id shown in lsusb, i used it for flashing a blackmagic probe but you can flash what you want, dfu-util is a free utility can be installed with brew install --build-from-source dfu-util\ndfu-util -d 1d50:6017 -s 0x08002000:leave -D ./src/blackmagic.bin\n\n\nA: For an FTDI bridge I have, the serial number already appears in the device name: it appears as /dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_FT231X_USB_UART_DA00AG57-if00-port0 (corresponding to some /dev/ttyUSBx) on Linux, and as /dev/cu.usbserial-DA00AG57 and /dev/tty.usbserial-DA00AG57 on macOS. (See https://stackoverflow.com/a/8632603/4896937 for difference between tty.* and cu.*.)\nUnfortunately, for Prolific bridge I have, an issue like yours still applies: a device appearing as /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Prolific_Technology_Inc._USB-Serial_Controller-if00-port0 (which doesn't contain a serial number) is simply /dev/cu.usbserial and /dev/tty.usbserial on macOS (not even System Profiler gives a serial number for it). Who knows what would happen if I had a second one plugged in.\nMaybe there is a more general answer out there that is vendor-independent, but be warned some devices might not report a serial number.\n\nA: I had the same issue with Profilic Bridge and download the driver from http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=229&pcid=41 fix the problem after restart.\n", "Q: PDF reader for Mac that handles bookmarks well I have a couple of PDFs that are composed of scanned images of books. So there is no table of contents for jumping directly to the chapters. As a workaround I bookmark the page where a chapter starts, and use the list of bookmarks as a sort of index.\nThe problem with Mac Preview is that it doesn't allow to rename the bookmarks and by default all the bookmarks have the same name, so I can't tell which bookmark corresponds to which chapter.\nAs a alternative to Preview I started using Skim, which is very nice and covers all the features I want but Skim handles bookmarks weirdly. All the bookmarks from every single PDF appear together in the Bookmarks menu (regardless of which PDF is open) and I have to manually make bookmark folders for grouping the bookmarks by PDF's which is tedious and also simple drag and drop doesn't work somehow (turns all the bookmarks into the same bookmark).\nI am looking for a alternative PDF Reader that can at least handle bookmarks in a normal fashion. Also if it can embed the bookmarks and highlights and notes into the pdf itself, so that when I transfer it to my other devices these bookmarks and annotations remain.\n\nA: PDFpen allows editing bookmarks.\nPDFpenPro allows editing and creating bookmarks, organising bookmarks, and so on.\nThey are actually marketed as PDF editors, not just readers.\nBoth allow embedding all annotations into the document itself.\n\nA: I have found 2 PDF reader apps, both of which have free versions that at least allow me to rename my bookmarks and work well overall. PDF Reader X and Foxit reader. Both are on the apple app store.\n", "Q: CoreDragCreate error - drag&drop and copy-paste stop working From time to time drag&drop and copy-paste stop working.

Restarting it might provide a fix (temporarily), and can be less disruptive than logging out.  From this answer:\n\nCheck if the pboard daemon is running:\nlaunchctl list | grep com.apple.pboard\nIf the pboard daemon is running, then stop and start it. If it's not running, start it:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.pboard\nlaunchctl start com.apple.pboard\nThen, you may need to restart the application(s) where cut-and-paste is not working.\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro finder error -50 appearing randomly I've done a lot of research about this problem, but cannot find solution.

I would start by bringing to the Apple store for diagnostic, or read here for how to get your own hardware diags.  You have already reinstalled a fresh OS on a new drive, so it's possible the SATA cable is bad (believe it or not I've seen this happen), or even the logic board.  \nWhat errors are reported in Console log when the problem occurs?\n\nA: I am also having this problem.

The option of clearing the preference back to None is not offered in the Info panel.\nThe two files I want to do this to are part of a set of files N files, half with no extension and half with an extension for which no application has registered any interest.

Sorry if the question field is too terse.  Situation: I arrived where I am living now with an GSM iPhone 5 or 5s.  The GPS was working (recording my route to here) and the cell access was working as far as I know (I had used it earlier in the day).\nFor a few days, I only used WiFi.  Then I decided to go out and as usual, record the route with \"Motion-X.\"  Motion-X was unable to find any satellites.  A Garmin that I also had found ten or more and said accuracy two meters¹\nI then noticed that it was also still searching for cell service (or \"no service\"—I forget which).  I went back to the house and found that all my colleagues had cell service.  I haven't been able to get cell for weeks (nor GPS) here or in several nearby villages, including in Pamplona (big city).  So it seems that GPS and cell died at about the same time.  I don't know whether Bluetooth still works, though I know it was working the day I arrived.\nThen IOS 9.3.2 became available.  My iPad updated on the house WiFi, but the iPhone won't.  It downloaded the update but when I try to install it says \"update server not available.\"  Even though it did not say (as occasionally in the past) that there wasn't enough space, I deleted a lot of apps but no change.  Every day, it irritatingly asks me to install, enter passcode, accept the terms, and then says the same.\nFinally, I tried erasing all content and resetting everything.  When activating it afterward, on the third screen, I get to choose between WiFi and iTunes.  I connected to the house WiFi, and after several minutes, \"the activation server is not available … try later or try iTunes.\"  But now that it knows the WiFi password, it will only try that.  iTunes is no longer shown as an option.  Power-off and restart went back to the beginning of the activation, but iTunes is still not an option on page three.\nConnected to the computer anyway and fired up iTunes.  iTunes automatically switched to a window that is all blank except for the word \"iPhone\" in large letters.  This screen won't go away unless I quit iTunes.

If there are multiple audio tracks, those are available to me, but on a video that I can confirm has multiple subtitle tracks, the Videos app only shows me the first one.  The others aren't even options.\nIs there some trick to encoding or muxing? Or does the Videos app on iOS only support a single subtitle track?\n\nA: It seems like, as far as I can tell, that the Videos app on iOS only support one subtitle per language. \nI had two English subtitles that both showed up on my Apple TV (as \"English\") but only one of them in the Videos app. My workaround was to change the language of one of these subtitles to something other than English using Subler (I chose \"Unknown\").

The Magic Mouse has no \"button\", but instead has a trackpad like surface that can register clicks, taps, swipes, etc. I use a third party tool called MagicPrefs for it (the key use in this context is to enable a \"middle button click\" effect for Linux), and I found that if I choose \"Configure Scrolling\" in MagicPrefs, and then disable ALL scrolling behaviors (1/2/3 finger) I no longer can trigger those \"MEvent\" alerts in MATLAB.\nNOTE: disabling all scrolling disables the mousewheel-like scroll, and it turns out only disabling the horizontal/diagonal scrolling seems to be required to avoid the MATLAB issue.\n", "Q: iMac 5k internal SSD vs external SSD performance Can anyone point me in the direction of a real-world performance comparison between a iMac 5k's internal SSD and an external one (ideally one on thunderbolt and one on usb)? Basically, I want to know how much performance I'd give up by buying a smaller built in SSD and putting most data on an external.\nUpdate\nI guess ideally what I want is something like http://www.macworld.com/article/2039427/how-fast-is-usb-3-0-really-.html but for the iMac 5k (so including Thunderbolt 2) and with the internal drive included for comparison.\nA comment asked what specific SSD models:\n\n\n*\n\n*Internal - Whatever Apple ships I guess\n\n*External - Let's say a Samsung 850 EVO (http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-ssds).\n\n\nBut if the answer is literally 'there's no performance benefit to the disk being internal; that answers the real question (but I'd still love to see numbers).\nUpdate 2\nhttp://www.newegg.com/global/au/Product/SingleProductReview.aspx?ReviewID=4066303 suggests that reviewer found a big gap between an SSD in that specific thunderbolt enclosure and the MacPro's internal PCIe SSD - Is that more likely a limitation of the case or disk inside it (in which case how can I base avoid that?), or would that be likely to apply in my case as well?\n\nA: Because the maximum throughput of any port on the iMac 5k Late 2015 is only 10Gbps (Thunderbolt 2), no external storage solution can match the internal SSD's speeds.\nThe short answer is that you would give up a lot of performance.\nThe internal SSD can transfer data at about a couple GB/s.\nAn external Samsung 850 Pro 512GB via a self-powered USB 3.0 docking station runs at about 400MB/s during CrystalDiskMark sequential transfer benchmark on an exFAT partition.  \nThat said, for running macOS and applications, the difference between the internal SSD and an external SSD is much less noticeable than that between an SSD and a traditional HDD. Unless you are constantly moving large files on and off your drive, an external SSD won't feel much slower subjectively than the internal SSD.\nYou did not specify how much data you have or your budget, so I cannot give specific recommendations. But in general, I put macOS and applications on an internal SSD. I would figure out how many GBs macOS and all my applications would consume, and choose an SSD of appropriate size.  \nIf you really value the drive being internal and need large capacity on a budget, consider the 2TB or 3TB Fusion Drive. They have a 128GB SSD built in and intelligently find and put the data you access the most frequently on the SSD portion. The 1TB Fusion Drive only has a 24GB SSD so is less attractive  \nThunderbolt 2 enclosures doesn't make much sense \nTrue, an SATA SSD could be bottlenecked by USB 3.0. But not significantly so. That is because SATA itself tops out at 6 Gbps (SATA3), not much more than USB 3.0's 5 Gbps. \nFor the same reason, even though Thunderbolt 2 eliminates the link bottleneck, the benefit would be small because now the bottleneck is on the SSD side, which is 6 Gbps.\nThere are PCIe NVMe SSDs (the internal SSD falls into this category), which are faster than SATA SSDs. But to use those externally you still have two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbolt 2 tops out at 10Gbps, slower than what the internal SSD and other PCIe NVMe SSDs are capable of. \n\n*There are few (none?) Thunderbolt 2 to PCIe NVMe SSD enclosures. The StarTech product you linked to takes SATA drives. \n\n\nAll Thunderbolt 2 enclosures I have come across are ridiculously expensive, including the one you linked to, especially considering the limited performance gains. You would be much better off spending the money on upgrading the internal SSD.\n\nA: Speed of running an OS from external ssd is about IOPS.\nSadly, after extensive googling, I couldn't find any comparisons on IOPS between sata/usb3/tb.\n", "Q: Used Phone & No Apple iCloud Password I was given an iPhone but I don't have the Apple iCloud password. \nI don't use as the iPhone as a phone, so no carrier is enabled.

The previous owner should be able to remove the lock using his/her password. Otherwise it is essentially a stolen phone.\n", "Q: Connecting two devices to one phone So I have been trying to connect my microphone to my iPhone 5s while connecting another device(a speaker) simultaneously. Is this possible in anyway? Also can I speak on the mic and hear from the speaker when I'm on a phone call. I know we have car headsets and car hands free speakers with built-in mic these days but I was just wondering if it's possible to use two different devices sinultaneously for a phone call.\n\nA: Yes you can do this by buying a bluetooth speaker and a pluggable microphone. I would recommend using the Ultra Slim Bluetooth Speaker as the bluetooth speaker (it is available for $50, pretty affordable) and the Zoom iQ7 as your microphone ($99.99). In Zoom iQ7, there is a headphone plug so you might not even need the speaker if you have the Zoom iQ7. \n", "Q: OS X doesn't query local DNS names properly None of our OS X client machines in our workplace query local DNS names of our servers properly after connecting to VPN. For other client machines – including Linux and Windows – it works properly.\nJust some context: our servers were accessible publicly before. Since we started securing everything, we proceed to put them behind a firewall and they are accessible via VPN only. Since our developers are used to accessing the servers via fqdn, we added a local DNS server. So when they connect to our VPN, DHCP + DNS settings would be passed to their machines automatically. Two DNS server IPs, one is for local resolving and one for public resolving. Unfortunately, all of our OS X users are experiencing these problems.

Different machines may require slightly different content of this file. Examples: different software versions installed requiring different configuration, different paths, different names for things such as partitions under /dev/.\nDo this instead: put all your customized functions and aliases in a file $HOME/Dropbox/my_functions.sh and then include the line\n. $HOME/Dropbox/my_functions.sh\n\nin your .bash_profile.\n\nA: I think is better idea to upload to a repository.

I'm considering migrating to OS X and I have a question on configuring its Mail application. In my current setup, I use Thunderbird configured to keep all sent and received messages from all my POP3 accounts in a single inbox folder, so I can follow my conversations in a nice thread, without having to jump from inbox to sent back and forth. I hope I've described it clearly, if not - I am going for something like this:\n\nWould I be able to configure Apple Mail like this? I know I can just install Thunderbird for Mac and copy profile, but I would rather stick to default application if it's possible.\n\nA: The layout is a bit different than in Thunderbird, but you can get threaded conversations by checking \"Include related messages\" in the Preferences panel:\n\nThe result will be something like this:\n\nBy choosing to \"Use classic layout\" you can get drop-downs for a thread, but it will only show messages from others, not from yourself. Your replies are shown in the preview pane on the bottom, though.\n\nEdit: I just noticed this myself, but you can also click on the double arrows in the not-Classic view to show individual messages from others.\n\n\nA: Don't think so. On iOS, maybe - there are settings to select specific folders as Drafts or Sent or etc. - but in desktop Mail, you cannot select Inbox and change it to function as anything else (selecting a folder allows you to go to the Mailbox menu item and choose \"Use this mailbox as...\" but options are grayed out if an Inbox folder is selected).\nI use Mail.app on mobile. I use Thunderbird on the Mac desktop. Minor complaints aside, I'm happier with that setup, because my mail works as I expect it to on my system - I've been using Thunderbird far too long to want to re-adjust my expectations for a desktop app.\n", "Q: Mac Launchpad icon jumps up I am running OS X El Capitan version 10.11.5 on a Macbook Air.\nRecently, on two occasions, I saw the Launchpad icon in the Dock jumping up and down a few times and then it stopped.\nOn that moment I was not active on the computer. \nWhat could be the reason?\n\nA: Do you have automatic updates activated for apps in the Mac App Store? You can check this under System Preferences -> App Store. (Not in the non-existent Preferences in the actual App Store app, which might be confusing.)\nThe Launchpad icon jumps when an application has been updated.\n\n", "Q: Run shell and type output I am using iTerm2.

I use Optimize iPad Storage in the Apple Photos app for my iPad, but sometimes I want an entire album offline to show someone. Is there a better way to do this than flicking through the photos one by one and waiting for them to download?\nIf this is not possible, I don't mind downloading all the photos. Selecting Download and Keep Originals doesn’t seem to download the photos until I view them.\n\nA: There are actually multiple levels of download. Even when you view an image, a device-optimized version is retrieved. Only when you Edit or Share a photo is it fully downloaded from iCloud (possibly when you zoom in all the way, also).\nWith that being said, you can’t bulk-Edit; however, you can bulk-Share. Here are the steps that worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into the album you wish to download locally.\n\n*Tap Select.\n\n*Tap Select All.\n\n*Tap the Share icon in the bottom-left hand corner.\n\n*Select Email.\n\n*Wait for the Preparing progress indicator to complete. This may take a while depending on how large your album is and on the speed of your connection.\n\n*When your email is ready, Cancel out of it.\n\n\nRemember that these photos are eligible for purging if your device becomes low on storage.\nNote: I tried this on a relatively small album (20 photos and videos). I don’t know if your iPhone might crash attempting to share 500 photos at once.\nIf you choose to Download and Keep Originals, I believe your iPhone does that while your device is locked, on Wi-Fi, and has sufficient charge. It might help to have Photos as the foreground app when locking the iPhone.\n\nA: I'm not sure this can be done directly, as Apple has created this mode in order to save space and not to leave Originals on the interested device in order to take a quick look at those even when Offline.\nBut there's a way around you may find very useful and suitable for your specific case, and not only.\n\niXpand flash drive\nEarlier this year, San Disk and other brands have released a new type of flash drives, this flash drives are specifically designed to have a USB connector and a Lightning one.\nThis allows you to connect it directly either to your Computer or to your iDevice.\nThis way you can save all your important files, photos and videos in it and access them Offline, even while flying, via your iDevice, simply connecting the flash drive to it.\n\nThe San Disk flash drive is called iXpand, and it comes in different storage capacities, from 16GB up to 128GB.\nOf course you're not restricted to purchase a San Disk one, even because I'm not promoting them in any way, but their flash drive's been the first one I've personally heard of.\nAlthough, if you're interested to take a closer look at it, you can find further more details on their dedicated page here.\nOtherwise, you can check out this 9to5mac article which features some of the best new lighting flash drives for iDevices.\n\nA: As of Photos 3.0, you can right-click on an Album name under My Albums, and select Download Originals to this Mac.\n", "Q: MacBook Muted, some applications still provide sound I discovered this not so long ago, when I started using Skype. I get notification sounds even though my speakers are on mute. The same thing happens with email. Suddenly there's a notification/alert sound for everything during mute. \nIs there a setting where I can disable this \"feature\"? \n\nA: The most likely explanation for this is that you have multiple sound output devices. When you mute, only the current output devices is muted — the rest are not.\nThe next time you hear a sound when you think you shouldn't, go to Sound Preferences > Output and check your Output devices one by one. It's almost certain that at least one of them isn't muted (a headset, for example), and that's how you're hearing the mystery sound.\n\nA: I have noticed that my virtual speaker (System Preferences/Settings > Sound > Output) has a software update as the macOS audio driver was reworked for Apple Silicon, the older one is unstable on new Macs, so updating/removing additional speakers might fix it too\n", "Q: How can I see the old episodes of a podcast on iPad? I have noticed that I cannot see all the episodes of a podcast in the feed section, even though I see it on the podcasts website. Can someone tell me how I can access the older episodes ? \nI'd like to watch some episodes not being shown on the app but available on the website.\nThanks.\n\nA: It depends on the author of the podcast. Some authors limit their podcasts on iTunes but do offer them via their website (it gives them extra traffic). \n\nA: Unfortunately, the podcast feed for this particular show only includes the most recent 30 podcasts. To determine that, I looked at the feed source and counted the number of <item> tags within the <channel> tag.\nUnfortunately, there is no way to play shows older than that with a podcast player unless they'd previously been downloaded and saved to your device.\nIt's true that podcasters often limit this, but normally the limit would be higher — 100 is common, for example. Your best bet for a solution is to contact the show (or the BBC, if direct show feedback isn't possible) and ask them to set the limit high enough that all podcast episodes are available.\n", "Q: Changing from HDD to SSD with my Airport Time Capsule I will receive a new SSD very soon (Samsung 850 EVO 500gb).\nMy question is, will it be possible to transfer all my data from my HDD(I have a time machine backup of my computer on the airport time capsule).\nLike lets say, i a) I insert my new ssd in the mac with absolutely nothing on and unplug the hdd. b) Booting my mac while holding (⌘-R or alt button???).\nAfter that would it be possible to choose my network and choose the airport time capsule where i saved my time machine backup? Hope my question makes sense. Thanks!\n\nA: As long as you're on your Wi-Fi network, you should be able to do that, but if I were you I'd just buy a SATA-to-USB cable ($30 at Best Buy), install the SSD as usual, connect the HDD over USB, make a disk image of it with Disk Utility (in Recovery), and then install the image on the new drive. I did this when I upgraded my MacBook Pro to an SSD and haven't had any problems with it.\n", "Q: How can I add a property to the window object in Chrome using Applescript? In Chrome's JavaScript Console, I can type the following:\nwindow.myVar = \"myValue\";\n\nI can then access myVar from the window context, where it returns \"myValue\". Excellent.\nHowever, if I do the following in Applescript:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    execute front window's active tab javascript \"window.myVar = 'myValue';\"\nend tell\n\nThis execute statement appears to run when the script is called. No errors are thrown, and the Chrome window exists. But when I try to reference myVar from the window context, only undefined is ever returned. For testing purposes, I added in an alert statement after that declaration - the alert WILL fire, but myVar remains unset.\nNow, in Safari, using do JavaScript with this same code works as if I'd typed the code directly into the console - myVar returns a value.\nWhy doesn't Chrome fire these statements when called by Applescript when it can be done manually?\n(Chrome 51.0.2704.84, OS X 10.11.5)\n\nA: I discovered a workaround. Might not be the best, but the following line executes the JavaScript I have in mind while also setting properties of window:\ntell front window of application \"Google Chrome\"\n    set URL of active tab to \"javascript:\" & window.myVar = \"myValue\"\nend tell\n\nUsing this, myVar properly returns \"myValue\".

I removed the iCloud and created a new iCloud account, and now get some SMS's from other people, and not all SMS's sent or receieved are showing up on the work iPhone 6. How do I remove my work iPhone 6 from the iCloud so it doesn't continue to show sent and received messages from my personal iPhone 5S? (Maybe the SMS's still appearing on both are from other iPhone users?)\n\nA: To remove your work iPhone 6 from your personal iCloud account, go to Settings, select iCloud, scroll down to the very bottom, then tap Sign Out.  \nTo disable iMessage on the work iPhone without removing it from iCloud, go to Settings, select Messages, and uncheck the iMessage option.  \nIf you're receiving weird, spammy iMessages, scroll down to the Send & Receive option of the Messages section, select that option, and check/uncheck the addresses you'd like to receive iMessages from.  iMessages can be sent to email addresses, so if you have a public-facing email or one that's shared often, you might want to uncheck that address.\nIf you're not receiving text messages even after disabling iMessages, you may wish to use Apple's Deregister iMessage page; it's intended for people who are switching from an iOS device to a non-iOS device, and thus wish to disable iMessages.\nAnother tip: Make sure that the people whose messages you're not receiving aren't attempting to send iMessages to your personal iMessage account!  Make sure to give them your work phone number, and text them from your work phone; otherwise, they may have created a contact with your personal iCloud account as the iMessage address.\n\nA: You should be able to do what you want while still using your iCloud account on the work phone for apps, music, reminders, FaceTime, and other things, if you want. You can choose which things are sync'd and turned on on the work phone.\nOn your iPhone 5s, go to Settings > Messages and see to it that it's not forwarding SMS under Text Message Forwarding. This will stop SMS messages to your personal number from going to the work phone. Also, on the work iPhone, go to Settings > Messages and turn off iMessage. This will stop people with Apple devices who send your iCloud account messages from having those messages go to your work phone.\n", "Q: Any way in OS X to use a keyboard shortcut to switch to a full screen application? OS X has a feature where you can create a keyboard shortcut for switching to a particular desktop / space. However, there isn't an obvious way to use a keyboard shortcut switch to directly a full screen application. Is there a way to do this?\nA few other people have asked this, and there have been some suggestions, but I haven't found one that accomplishes what I'm asking:\n\n\n*\n\n*One suggestion is to turn on \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\", and then switch to the application. I do not want to turn this feature on, as I frequently switch to applications without wanting to change spaces.\n\n*Another suggestion is to use Ctrl + arrow keys, which can be used to switch to a full screen application, but not directly to one. You have to be on an adjacently space. I want a keystroke that switches directly to the application.\nI'm willing to use third party applications like BetterTouchTool to bind a script or application to a keyboard shortcut if it will allow me to do this.\n\nA: To do this: push control and < or control and →.\nYou can slightly change the functionality if you have \"Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\" checked or unchecked. (System Preferences > Mission Control)\nThere is no other way to do this that I know of. I have used a few third party apps. I am sure there exists some third party app somewhere that does it. I've heard that Witch makes the window switcher similar to Windows style, which might achieve the exact results you are looking for, but might not. It costs $15 as of today. It just doesn't mention fullscreen in its advertising, though it has a ton of options so it's possible it covers this.\nHonestly, you can't expect much better from OS X. Look at what you're stuck with:\nSwitching between applications in OS X is command + tab and arranges apps by most recent. Switching between windows within an app is command + ` and arranges windows sequentially. With control + ←/→ and the \"Auto rearrange Spaces...\" unchecked, you can get the sequential switching similar to the way OS X handles window switching within an app, which is a poor way to do it, but at least there is some kind of precedent.\nI have a lot of gripes about switching between applications in OS X. I don't like that there is one keyboard shortcut to switch between apps, one to switch between windows within an app, and one to switch between spaces, and they have different orderings. I want one to switch between everything. I also hate keyboard shortcuts that include an arrow key, like this one. That defeats the purpose of having a fast keyboard shortcut: I still have to move my hand, might as well use the mouse. I am strongly considering switching to Windows 10 this year now that it will include bash. I use keyboard shortcuts for almost everything and Windows does it better, not to mention that I honestly think Windows software looks better.\n\nA: If the goal is to switch directly to a specific full screen app quickly, and NOT specifically to do so without taking your hands off the keyboard, you could use hotcorners or the three-finger swipe (if on a laptop/Magic Trackpad). I set lower right corner of my screen to trigger Mission Control; when I need to switch, I hit that corner, then select the space or fullscreen app. It's a little cumbersome but faster than control-arrow repeatedly.\n\nA: Partial answer, as I'm on my phone this week. \nIf you use apps maximised rather than full screen, with both the menu bar & dock set to auto-hide, then you can simply assign each app to its own Space & use Ctrl/number to switch directly. \nThe downside is you still have the window surround, the upside is you remain in complete control. \n\nA: Try pressing Cmd-Ctrl-F at the same time while you're in an application\n\nA: Another answer:\nIf you have your System Preferences set to switch to a Space with an active window when switching to an app, you can use Alfred (and probably the built-in Spotlight program). If you can push the keyboard shortcut for Spotlight and enter the first few letters of the app, you could probably get very fast at switching.\n\nA: I've found a method that works. I noticed that double-clicking on a dock icon will switch to a full screen application's space, even if \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\" is turned off in Mission Control's system preferences. It's possible to make an AppleScript that utilizes this, even if the dock is hidden:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Dock\"\n        tell list 1\n            tell UI element \"insert application name here\"\n                click\n                click\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nSave this to an scpt file, and then bind it to a keystroke using an application like BetterTouchTool. Since it uses OS X's accessibility API it will require whichever application is invoking it to have permission to remote control the computer (in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > \"Privacy\" tab > Accessibility).\nThis does have one limitation that I'm aware of, which is that it only consistently works if the application has no other open windows on other spaces. Otherwise this will toggle between the various spaces that the application's windows are occupying. Fortunately my use case involves an application that doesn't have any other open windows so it satisfies my requirements.\n", "Q: How do I verify a certificate when installing it on iOS? I am installing a self-created certificate authority SSL cert onto a modern (iOS-9.3.2, iPod6) iOS device. It is self-signed and obtained over an untrusted transport. In normal, e.g. desktop, environments, I’d be able to print out the certificate’s fingerprint or view the fingerprint to verify that the certificate copied to the device is the same as the one I created. For example, on any unix system:\nohnobinki@ohnopublishing ~ $ openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -in /etc/ssl/certs/GlobalSign_Root_CA.pem\nSHA1 Fingerprint=B1:BC:96:8B:D4:F4:9D:62:2A:A8:9A:81:F2:15:01:52:A4:1D:82:9C\n\nWhen viewing the certificate on iOS, I end up at the “Install Profile” screen. It lets me view things like “Subject Name”, “Issuer Name”, Subject Key Identifier”, “Public Key Identifier”, “Signature”, et al. I guess I can verify that the key is the same by comparing all the octets of the Signature—but there are a ton of octets compared to the fingerprint which is already a burden to validate. Also, when I tap and hold on the “Signature”, I get no option to Copy the octets or anything useful.\nWhat is the best strategy for validating that a certificate downloaded to an iOS device matches the one you created and intend to install rather than one crafted by an untrusted/malicious party?\n", "Q: Pretend to be specific Mac OS X version when running app I've purchased a Mac OS X app (outside the App Store) that seems to have arbitrary limitations based on the Mac OS X version. It is fully functional on El Capitan, but has a few features that it simply won't allow on Mavericks. One of these features is pretty basic — reading / writing a preferences file — so I'm guessing the developer simply wanted to narrow down the range of testing scenarios when implementing it, rather than it actually requiring Yosemite / El Capitan functionality.\nQuestion: Is there a way to start a Mac OS X app in a manipulated environment such that I can supply specific values of my own choosing when the application calls methods like [[NSProcessInfo processInfo] operatingSystemVersion] or isOperatingSystemAtLeastVersion or whatever?\n\nA: I know for one app that had a similar problem with we were able to get it to work by modifying /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist\nI would say that is NOT a recommended approach.  However, you may be able to do something tricky so that when your app environment reads that plist it gets a different version then the rest of the system.  \n", "Q: The piece under key hinge –– that looks like a nipple –– came loose. What to do? The left arrow key on my 2014 model Mac Air has been acting weird, so I took off the key cap and hinge to see what was going on and I discovered that the tiny piece that looks like a nipple (or a suction cup, if you will) is not attached to anything. I took off another small key to see how it should be. The nipples under other keys are firmly attached to either side of the key hole, but this one is kinda loose. \nAs a result, the key works but you have to push really hard on it.\nHow can I fix this? Can I just superglue it in place or do I need to get a new nipple-thingy?\nthanks.\n\nA: The piece is the \"dome\" - it sits under the key cap (see here). Underside of it has a conductive surface, so pushing it down closes the contact to trigger a key press. You may be able to fix this with some very small bits of double-sided adhesive tape; not sure I'd superglue it, because failure to fix could mean you're looking at a total keyboard replacement, depending on where the glue gets.\n", "Q: Time control for specific applications on OS X Is there a simple way to limit the use of a specific application to a certain amount of time (for instance one hour per day)? \nTo be more specific, I use a Macbook with OS X 10.10, on which there are several accounts, one for me and one for my daughter, who is a Parental Controls account.\nApparently, it is possible with the Apple's Parental Controls system to put time limits on the use on the computer, and also to block specific applications, but not to combine those two applications, blocking one application at certain time or for certain duration.

This is a good way to clear out space in iCloud.They don't delete immediately, you can recover recently deleted files for a while, but they do disappear from connected devices and will eventually be deleted - any copies you export onto your computer (outside of the Photos app) will not be affected.  I back up older photos from the Photos app, by exporting them to a folder on my Mac, then removing them from iCloud, to recover space when my 5 GB of free storage gets full.\n", "Q: Right click in Ubuntu Virtual Box guest VM is not working I am running Ubuntu in Virtualbox in Mac OS. \nI found that rightclick in the guest Ubuntu, by tapping the trackpad while pressing ctrl key, doesn't work. E.G. \n\n\n*\n\n*it doesn't show the menu for file properties and removal option, when right clicking a file under Nautilus.\n\n*in chrome browser, when right clicking a link, it doesn't show option to open it in a new tab. \nwhen I connect a wired mouse to macbook pro, right clicking works i.e. brings out properties of a file, etc. So does two-finger tapping the trackpad.\nHow can I troubleshoot this?\n\nA: When ever  I'm setting up a guest OS, I find it helpful to do two things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the OS X system preferences and review every setting on every tab of the mouse and trackpad, paying particular attention to multi button and multitouch gestures and shortcuts.\n\n*If you use a trackpad or touch device, connected multibutton mouse over USB to make sure that those settings are passed along to recognized\n\n\nAt that point, you will want to be sure any guest OS additions are loaded in the guest VM. That will make the guest most likely to receive the best input and have drivers on the ubuntu os configured to take advantage of the multi touch / right click events. You can always check the virtual box support forums once you have a specific set of OS versions - you might uncover a bug in the code or they decided to program things as they work intentionally. \n\nA: I was able to activate the right click menu in Ubuntu 19.04 running on Virtualbox 6.0.6 on MacBook 2019 with macOS Mojave 10.14.4 using the following key command:\nControl + Option + Click\nThis worked with both left and right Control + Option keys, and worked on external keyboard with external mouse as well as the Trackpad on my MacBook Pro.\nPlease comment, and confirm my findings. I was personally worried about this as it made working with the Trackpad very difficult on MacBook, and I thought I was always going to have to carry a mouse with my laptop, because I prefer to develop my programs/websites in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: To hide unused rows in Excel How do I hide all unused rows in Excel? I hate that if I scroll to fast I do not stop at the end of the data.\nI am running Excel 15.\nHere is an example. I want every row after 263 hidden so when I scroll down the data scrolling stops at 263. I also want every column after E hidden.\n\n\nA: Taken from this article on TekReview\nMake sure to leave room for expansion, if necessary. \n\n\n*\n\n*Select the first column to the right of your data. Now we need to select all columns from this starting point to the end of the spreadsheet. Because Excel gives users spreadsheets with tens of thousands of rows and columns, we’ll use keyboard shortcuts to quickly jump to the end.\n\n*With the rightmost empty column selected, press and hold the Shift key and then press Command + Right Arrow. This will jump you to the end of the spreadsheet while the Shift key automatically selects every cell in between.\n\n*Now we have to tell Excel to hide these cells. With your cells still selected, go to Excel’s Menu Bar and choose Format > Column > Hide. You’ll now see all the cells to the right of your data disappear.\n\n*Next, we need to deal with the cells below your data. Similar to the steps above, this time select the first row beneath your data. With the bottommost cell selected, press and hold Shift and then press Command + Down Arrow. This will jump you to the very bottom of the spreadsheet and select all the rows in between.\n\n*Finally, head back up to Excel’s Menu Bar and choose Format > Row > Hide. You’re now left with a spreadsheet that features only cells containing your data, resulting in a much cleaner look.\n\n\n\nIf you need to expand your table, or simply don’t like the new look, you can easily unhide the cells. First, click the top-left heading cell that looks like a white arrow pointing to the bottom-right corner. Clicking this cell will select all cells in your spreadsheet, both hidden and not. Once selected, go to Excel’s Menu Bar and choose both Format > Column > Unhide and Format > Row > Unhide. Your spreadsheet will now be restored to the default look.\n", "Q: Boot iOS directly into Airplane Mode My phone is switched off and I want to boot into airplane mode directly, without going online for even a split second (so quickly booting and opening control center and tapping airplane isn't an option as I'll be online for a few seconds).\nHow do I do this? (and no, I don't have a practical Faraday cage or somewhere with no reception available)\n\nA: You can't do that. You can, however, make it so your phone does not have internet access when it boots.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove your iPhone's Sim Card (you can get a sim card remover on Amazon for maybe $3).\n\n*Scan for wifi and ensure no wifi is reachable in case the device is paired with a network. \n\n*Disable any hotspots (Bluetooth or wifi-based)\n\n*Boot up your phone normally, and it will have no method to connect to the internet.\nNote that Bluetooth and gps will still be active since you won't be in full airplane mode, so this probably isn't suitable for a plane flight.\nOptional: To ensure no pre-existing wifi or Bluetooth connections, perform a factory reset of your phone via iTunes or Apple Configurator or other tool. \n", "Q: How to add Service to Finder Toolbar In the contextual menu (right click) on a folder or file object in the finder will give you the option to select \"Services\".  I wonder if there is some way to move those services into a button on the toolbar.  In particular I would like to add \"New Terminal at Folder\" to the toolbar.  Anyone have any idea how to do this?\n\nA: You can create an application doing exactly this using ScriptEditor.app and then add it to Finder Toolbar.\nFirst place this line inside your ~/.bash_profile file: \nalias cdf=\"eval \\\"cd \\\\\\\"\\\\\\`osascript -e 'tell app \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Finder\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to return the POSIX path of (target of window 1 as alias)'\\\\\\`\\\\\\\"\\\"\"\n\nThis will change the active directory to the one of the topmost Finder window.\nThen create an application in ScriptEditor.app like:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    do script \"cdf\"\n    activate\nend tell\n\nSave this as an application and add it to the Toolbar with ⌘ CMD + Drag.\n", "Q: Invalid Password El Capitan with Filevault encryption I just recently enabled Filevault on my 2011 Macbook Pro.  As long as I do not run out of battery El Capitan let's me enter my password and log into my computer.\nIf I run out of battery the password screen is presented after power on and it tells me my password is invalid indefinitely.  At first I reluctantly assumed user failure on my part.  But this is happening everyday now, each time I must enter my backup security key.\nAfter entering the key sometimes it asks me to assign a new password, which I set to what I believe it was before.  Other times it just prompts me to enter my password again as if the screen saver had activated and the password works as intended.\nI hope this is clear enough. It's very frustrating.  I'm guessing I might have to disable Filevault.\nEDIT\nI ran a test:\nI entered the password several times while the machine was powered up for root privileges and on wake from sleep. No problems\nI then let the battery run out and again was presented with the boot up password screen.

Since updating to OSX 10.11.3, I have found Photoshop CS6 will not load, as well as several other programs. Others include Hugin, possibly Dragon Dictate 5 (not resolved or confirmed yet re VP updating), Bamboo digital tablet, and a few others. \nConcentrating on Photoshop CS6, for me following upgrading to OSX 10.11.3 it begins to load then freezes. A web search (several done over a few months) seems to suggest for others there is no issue, yet for others there is, and for some few if any of the CS6 suite is working. Adobe no longer offers support for CS6. Apple is silent. \nI am left confused if there are few or many that find Photoshop CS6 working fine on OSX 10.11.x. If here are many, perhaps a recent replacement of the motherboard, CPU/GPU is the real issue, not OSX 10.11.x in my case.\nI understand OSX 10.11 relocated some system files as part of improved security, so it could be the issue. Others posts on other sites seemed originally to confirm this. \nThis article seems to outline these changes best:  Article Security Changes OSX 10.11.x\nLost and confused.  \n\nA: Last night I updated to OSX 10.11.6.

Both of them output similar voltages. iPhone 6 charger outputs 5v and iPad Air outputs 5.2v. The current on each charger is different - 2.1A for iPad and 1A for iPhone. What do those mean if the actual current is dependent on the load? How come an it is rumored that an iPhone charges faster with an iPad charger?\n\nA: They both output a similar voltage level ~5V. However this is going to change once you start drawing current from the charger. The output will decrease if you start pulling more current. \niPad charger provides 2.1 A at 5.2 V means you can pull 2.1 A and the output will stay at 5.2V. Output voltage might go down if you draw more current (say by attaching 2 ohm resistor across the leads and trying to draw 2.6 A) and thereby also reduce the expected output current.\nSimilarly, iPhone charger will be able to provide rated voltage (5V) only up to 1A of current draw. After that, you might see a voltage drop.\nIn terms of hardware, iPad charger will have a higher power circuit - most likely a bigger flyback transformer, mosfets with higher current capacity and bigger filter capacitors. \nYou can benefit from ipad charger while charging an iphone if your iphone is able to draw current higher than 1A. If this is not the case, then there is no point. However you will notice longer charge times when you charge your ipad using iphone charger.\nAlso, it's false assumption that load remains the same. Here is a sample charging current and voltage curve for a li-po battery which I picked from a google image search:\n\nAs you can see, initially the battery voltage is lower since it has discharged. Once it starts charging, the voltage increases and the charging current decreases. \n", "Q: Changed Time Machine hard drives Wonder if anyone can help.\nI changed over hard drives to use for my Time Machine backups of my mac and have completed a new backup on my new external hard drive.\nOn the old external drive that i want to use for a different purpose now, there is a folder called \"Backups.backupdb\".\nCan i delete this folder now that i have a complete backup of my computer on a new drive?\nThanks in advance \n\nA: Use Disk Utility to reformat the old drive.

This is configured by default in OS X and has nothing to do with giving your WiFi password to your neighbor.\n\nLocal Computers (Hosts)  If you are not given a local DNS name by your DHCP server (your WiFi router, for example), your Mac will default to a .local domain.  So, if you have to go to another computer on your own local network, it will bypass the proxy (if one is configured) and just connect directly.  OS X is assuming all local computers are on the .local domain.\n169.254/16  This is a non routable (private) self assigned IP address.  You would get this IP if you don't have a DHCP server providing you one.  Again, this is there to bypass any proxies you might have configured when connecting to a computer on your local network.\nWhat is a Proxy (Server)  In short, a proxy is a server that makes requests as an intermediary for other computes on the network.  For example, you can have a content filter (at work) that prevents you from going to the naughty bits on the Internet.  It will look at your request, analyze it, then either reject it or make the request for one.  When the remote server responds, it takes the data and sends it to you.\n\n", "Q: com.apple.bkagentservice high cpu usage My macbook has a high cpu usage because of one process and i don't know why.\nThis is the process all the time at 130% \nI think it has something to do with this log.

All - how can I share some of my iTunes music (not purchased via iTunes) with my kid? Virtually all of those are ripped from CDs. I still have the CDs but I don't want to rip them all again.\nThank you.\n\nA: In terms of technology, the files you're talking about don't have DRM, so you can simply copy them to your son's computer. You don't say what kind of devices either of you are using, but you can right-click songs in iTunes and choose Show in Finder/Windows Explorer to see where your music files are located. Then you can transfer these files to your son using the same methods as any other files.\nBut whether it is legal to do that depends on where you live and other factors, and in some cases it may be a grey area. I just want to be clear that I can give you technical advice, but I can't give you legal advice. I am not suggesting that you break any the laws where you live.\n\nA: If you and your kid – or actually your device and your kid's device are on the same network, you could simply share your library like this:\nGo to your iTunes preferences and click on the sharing tab. You can then choose to either share your complete library, or select a playlist to share. On the client iTunes (your kid's device) your shared library should be visible in the top-right corner. \nYou can also find further details on this over here:\n \"Share your iTunes library over your home network\" (at apple.com)\nIf you are actually not on a desktop/macbook computer then things are slightly different – but still possible.

If OS X can have more RAM, will it wake up sooner?\n\nA: My best practice is to think about how to get the best use of your RAM and not make configuration decisions that lock down memory and instead monitor for problems on each OS and then make small adjustments.\nOn the Mac - open Activity monitor and watch the memory pressure. I would try to keep things in Green. If you are in the orange, that's ok, but you might want to try changing the reservations (less RAM to ubuntu guest or quit apps on either OS that take most active memory). In the red, you will be swapping and slowing down the response times.\n\nSo - you have 16 GB of RAM and one OS X running the hardware with Ubuntu running in Virtual Box. Virtual box makes a file or files to act as the storage for Ubuntu but OS X is handling all the actual reads/writes.\nSecond - both Ubuntu and OS X use virtual memory so that you could allocate 1 GB of Ram to the guest OS and it will use a swap file to make more memory as needed.\nTo initially monitor things, I would open terminal on both the host and guest and run something like vm_stat 5 - pay attention initially to only two numbers - the free and the swap out. Also pay attention to the memory pressure on OS X.\nOver time, you can shift to logging things more slowly with vm_stat 60 / vmstat 60 or even time stamp the usage. \nSince free memory is a waste on both OS X and Ubuntu - you will want to allocate all the RAM to OS X so it can cache all the file input and output for both OS X and virtual box. Allocating too much memory on ubuntu will make the OS X starved for RAM to cache the guest OS. Add memory to the guest OS when the applications you run there start to swap out to disk.\nHere are some links to get started on tuning and learning:\n\n\n*\n\n*slow speed of Ubuntu 12.04 in VirtualBox\n\n*Isn't Inactive memory a waste of resources?\n\n*What scale or measure does Mavericks' and Yosemite's \"memory pressure\" adhere to?\n", "Q: Can the iPod Nano 5th generation take screenshots? I own a small iPod nano 5th gen that I really like.\n\nIn order to try and troubleshoot a small, non-blocking bug that it seems to have, I would like to take screenshots on it - I would assume that storing them and transferring them to a computer wouldn't be a problem, since it shoots videos and has a camera roll.\nI couldn't find this info anywhere and I'm wondering if that's even possible, but if it is, I'd like to know how!\nI also accepts answers that offer to recopy the screen of the iPod on a Mac computer, since if I recopy I could easily screenshot there.\n(Maybe with Terminal?)\n\nA: Do what my grandpa would do and record the screen with another camera. :^)\nThe iPod Nano 5g does not run iOS. I'm not aware if it has any kind of undocumented screengrabbing or debugging-over-USB capability. It does have a video output, but only the audio or video content being played is output--it does not mirror the screen; so using an AV cable with capture card to record it would only be useful if the issue you have has to do with video/audio playback.\nYou're probably already aware that it's unlikely for whatever issue you've encountered to be addressed by Apple. The iPod Nano 5g was released in Sept. 2009, its last software update was in Nov. 2009 (version 1.0.2), and discontinued in Sept. 2010 (so all units would be out of warranty by now).\n", "Q: How do I transfer photos from my iPhone to my computer without using iCloud? How do I transfer photos from my iPhone to my Windows desktop without going through an external network? I used to be able to plug the phone into the computer with a USB cable and it would show up as a drive in Windows Explorer, then I could right click and select \"Import Photos and Videos\". But now after I installed an update to iTunes, it's not showing up in Windows Explorer any more after I plug it in. \nThis happened before in this question, but I already installed all the Windows updates available, and I also restarted my computer, and I have the latest iTunes (12.4.1.6), and the latest iOS (9.3.2), so now I don't know what it could be. It was working a week ago.\nThis articles describes what I used to do, but it's not showing up in Explorer. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201302\n\nA: OK I found out the problem! You have to have a photo on the phone for it to even appear in Windows Explorer! I was testing out a new cable to see if it worked and the phone didn't show up (but did iTunes sync). So I switched back to the old cable I knew worked and it still wouldn't show up and got me worried! I took a screenshot to generate a photo and now it shows up in Explorer. This was not obvious at all.\n", "Q: How can I change the black text in my terminal? I have changed the color in my profile, but some text is still black. How can I make all black text inverted, or any color that's visible? I'm including screenshot of my preferences and the issue. The second terminal screenshot is the result of highlighting, to illustrate the problem.\n\n\n\nA: In the second screen shot, it looks like you're looking at man builtin and the Command column, the first column, is in bold text and not visible. Looking at the Bold Text color shows it being rather dark, as dark as the Background Color & Effects in the first screen shot. So, change the Bold Text color to the same color as the Text color or just a shade darker then the Text color.\n", "Q: Running 3 External monitors from a Macbook Pro Retina 13\" Mid 2014 I currently own a Macbook pro (Retina 13\",mid 2014)\n2.6GHz Intel Core i5\n8GB 1600 Mhz DDR3\nIntel Iris 1536 mb\n3 x 22\" Samsung Monitors. 2 of them running through Thunderbolt to DVI-D adapter.\nThe 3 monitor i have tried using both a DVI-D to HDMI convertor and USB to DVI convertor.\nBut i just can't get the 3rd monitor to run.

Without using a 3rd-party application, how do I go about changing the icon in the sidebar for the Developer folder?\nWhen I click on \"Get Info\" for this icon it's showing the icon does have the hammer icon but it's not showing in El Capitan in the sidebar when I add it over there?\nDoes anyone have a solution or can refer me to an article that will provide me with some direct information on how to add/edit this?\n\n\nA: I found a SIMBL plugin that changes the icons on the sidebar to custom ones. By removing the icons from the configuration file, it doesn't replace any icons with custom ones, but only allows the icon of the folder itself to be displayed on the sidebar. Keep in mind that this will also change your home folder, All My Files folder and all other folders to display in colour.\nDownload modified version here\nRemember to use mySIMBL for the plugin to fully work: mySIMBL download\nDisclaimer: The original plugin is made by W0lfschild and is open source. I do not own this file, I have only provided a version with pre-edited config files. Original version is on GitHub.\n\nA: Only items you can activate from Finder > Preferences > Sidebar have custom sidebar icons. If you manually add folders, such as the Developer folder, to your sidebar favorites, they will show up with a generic sidebar icon, even if the folder has a custom Finder icon.\nThe only way to change this would be with hacks as described by e.g. Keyboard_Gamer's answer.\nFor more clarity, a 3rd-party app can add a finder extension to get a custom icon. This is why dropbox, google drive, onedrive and other folders might have custom icons.\n\nA: In XtraFinder Preferences, check \"Show colorful icons in the sidebar\". A side effect is that this will make every icon colorful, maybe you like it.\n\nA: There is at least one officially supported, modern way to change the sidebar icon for a folder.\nIf you enable a Finder Sync Extension and set it's directoryURLs to contain that folder, the app's custom sidebar icon should be used instead of the default icon.\nThis is the method Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. use to change the Finder sidebar icons for their syncing folder.\nThis does not work for changing the icons of certain folders, such as the root of your System directory or your home folder. But these locations often already have their own custom sidebar icons already.\n\nFinder Sync Extensions\n\nYou can also use the extension point’s API to add a sidebar icon for the monitored folder.\n\n\nYou will only be able to have one custom icon per Finder Extension app, so if you were to use this method to customize several folders you would need to use multiple Finder Sync Extensions. A single app won't be able to arbitrarily customize multiple folders.\n\nA: Just create a Developer folder in your user folder and the developer icon will automatically be on the folder, and when we add the folder to sidebar, it will also automatically be an icon.\n\n\nA: I'd love to be able to change the icons without an add-on. You get better visibility and much faster access.\nBest thing I've managed to do for easy visibility is to add emoji to the names of the folders.\nBut of course you likely don't want to add emoji to the folders themselves. Instead you can put an alias to the folder in the sidebar, and have that alias contain the emoji.\nI created ~/Library/Sidebar Aliases/ folder and dropped a number of aliases in there (Command-Option drag the folder). Then I renamed those to include whatever emoji icons I want to help visibility, and added those aliases to the sidebar.\nWorks perfectly:\n\nBonus: You can make the names themselves more descriptive. I've got a number of network folders in my sidebar and they all have the same name \"Photos\" for example.\nUsing an alias, I can have my smb://<server>.local/Collating/Photos/ folder appear in the sidebar as  Collating Photos, without touching the actual folder name itself.  \n\nImportant Note: The only noticeable downside to this approach is that you can no longer drag and drop files into the sidebar aliases, as you can when there's an actual folder in the sidebar. Not a big issue for me, but worth noting.\n", "Q: How to query the history record of when the USB driver which has been used? I always use one USB flash disk on my MacBook Air (OS X 10.10.3), but I lost it recently. I need a way to view when the last date & time the USB device was connected to the computer.\n\nA: Unfortunately peripheral connections are simply something that isn't logged by your Mac. Just think - why would it need to keep a written log of when a USB drive is plugged in?\nHope you end up finding it again!\n\nA: Apple's USB Prober should do the trick\n", "Q: How do I import photos in OS X without using Photos.app? My girlfriend always used Picasa to import photos from the camera, but since upgrading to OS X 10.11 El Capitan that doesn't work anymore.\nUsing Photos.app, she is able to import the photos, but they're hidden away in a Photos Library file which Photoshop cannot open, meaning she cannot add photos as a new layer.\nAny suggestions, please? In the open dialogue of Photoshop I've tried clicking 'Photos' hoping it'd show the entire photo library, but it doesn't bring up any photos.\n\nA: What do you mean by \"import\", if you're not copying to the special internal organization?\nJust copy the files from the camera media. \nIf you're using Photoshop, maybe you can consider using Lightroom too. It can \"import\" with some flexibility in where you store the files.\nNormally I just copy files, no special import process, to put he files where I want them, which is especially handy as I can do that on any computer to store to a file server. Then Lightroom \"imports\" (really, discovers) in-place without moving or changing those files.\n\nA: You can use Image Capture in the /Applications folder. This allows you to select a normal folder and import photos to that location, which can be accessed in Finder or Photoshop as usual.\nIn addition, this application allows you to setup the preferred application to open when connecting your camera (or smartphone, ...). There you can select Image Capture itself as the default application.\n\nA: You can use Dropbox, (free version is Ok, you get 2GB free could storage) when you sign up and install it on your mac, every time you connect any device (including iPhone, iPad, digital cameras, etc..) it comes up with a window asking if you want to transfer the images stored in that device to your Dropbox folder (which is in your computer, but also backed up on the cloud), once transferred you can move them anywhere.\nHope it helps\n\nA: If your girlfriend likes using Photos.app, she can still do that but import her pics elsewhere. You can do this by going to the \"Photos\" menu and choosing \"Preferences\". There's an option to store photos in the Library and it's checked by default:\n\nIf you search the help for \"Change where Photos stores your files\", it says:\n\nWhen you import photos and videos into Photos, they’re copied to and stored in the Photos library. If you prefer, you can store photos and videos outside the Photos library (for example, in a folder on your Mac or on an external drive) and still view them in Photos.

This is to defeat some \"smart\" software that detects that symlinks and aliases are not \"real\" directories and refuses to act on them.\nIn Linux, this would be trivially easy, with:\nmount --bind /path1/source_dir /path2/target_dir\nHowever, Mac OS's version of mount does not support this bind functionality (in any form, including mount -o bind, or mount -B), as far as I can determine. It also appears that none of Macports, Homebrew, or Fink supply a ported version of mount with such an option.  Some available more specialized mounting tools don't seem to relate, either (e.g. xmount is for disk images, and djmount is for network volumes).\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to mount a disk or partition as a volume or as a local directory, nor to create a share to be mounted arbitrarily by various users on various machines. Rather, I want to mount a folder, owned and writable only by a particular user, on an HFS+ disk as if it were a folder on another HFS+ disk, locally, in a way that is effectively transparent, with the same permissions and no security/integrity issues.\nA sloppy workaround is to create a CIFS share of the folder to be mounted, and (calling a custom, one-shot variant of smb.conf) limit its permissions in Samba just-so, such that it is not public, and has the same permissions as the target location, exactly the right file and directory mask, etc.; then mount it that way. But this would be inefficient, since it would be using the bletcherous Windows filesharing protocol, plus creating a visible share that shows up as a mountable volume from the SMB server, to anyone who can access this machine though SMB/CIFS (even if they cannot actually mount it). The Mac GUI will probably also represent it as a volume being shared.\n\nA: To mount a hard drive on a custom mountpoint:\n\nYou can do this with diskutil mount and the -mountPoint option.\n  From the man page:\n\nmount [readOnly] [-mountPoint path] device\nMount a single volume.  If readOnly is specified, then the file system is mounted read-only, even if the volume's underlying file\n    system and/or device and/or media supports writing; even the\n    super-user may not write to it; this is the same as the rdonly option\n    to mount (8).  If a -mountPoint is specified, then that path, rather\n    than the standard path of /Volumes/VolumeName, will be used as the\n    view into the volume file con- tent; a directory at that path must\n    already exist.\nFrom man diskutil, section 'Verbs'.\n\nThe syntax to mount to a custom mountpoint is as follows:\ndiskutil mount -mountPoint /path/to/custom/mountpoint [volume (identifier/UUID/label)]\n\nBear in mind that /path/to/custom/mountpoint must be a\n  directory, just like with mount, and that your\n  identifier/UUID/label are specific to the volume (i.e. /dev/diskXsY\n  not /dev/diskX). Mounting to a custom mountpoint cannot be done with\n  diskutil mountDisk, and only works with a single volume at a time.\n\nFrom my answer to How to mount disk by UUID or LABEL in OS X El Capitan.\nI've tested this by \"mounting\" a USB stick on an external hard drive.

After installing Folx on my Mac I realized I didn't like it.  I tried to remove it but the plugin didn't remove.  When I download any file with Safari it gives an error for the Folx plugin. I've searched and found this website that shows how to uninstall Folx.  I can't find the uninstaller file in downloader.mac.dmg. \nHow can I remove Folx completely?\n\nA: OS X is a bit different. After putting the application itself in the trash, you should probably use safari preferences to remove the extension. Once you do that you do that, you might want to log out and back in.  Then empty the trash. \nAlternatively you can look in the library folders - use finder go menu and choose \"Go to Folder\" and look in both below locations:\n~/Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins\n/Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins\n\nNote the space is encoded with a \\ but you can skip that most of the time if you are not pasting into terminal or scripting. Delete any plugins to be nuked and reboot if you removed any from the second system library folder. Then empty trash. \n", "Q: Some keys not working on Musical Typing?

But I ask myself whether this resolution is the total maximum resolution or the maximum resolution for each of the two monitors. I'm running two Dell U2715H (supporting DisplayPort chaining).\n\nA: From Apple.com's Q&A section:\n\nThe Mac Mini has two video outputs: a mini DisplayPort and a mini DVI port. The mini DisplayPort is the same one you find on the current generation MacBook, MacBook Pros (as well as the Mac Pro) and the mini DVI is the same as the on the old black/white macbook.\n\nand:\n\nFor 1920 x 1080 connect mini display port to DVI or HDMI. \n  For 2560 x 1440 connect mini display port to DisplayPort.\n\nAll you need are the adapters to connect the monitors, the Mac Mini will be able to handle both displays.\n", "Q: Mac iTunes requests update, but App store says no updates available Recently I got a iPhone 5 with iOS 9.3 installed.  On connecting it to my computer iTunes said that I needed at least iTunes 12.2.2.  I had 12.0 at the time.  Mac Running Yosemite.\nI clicked download, and App Store launched, and said I had no updates available.\nWent through this loop several times.\nCalled Apple.\nSpent an hour on the phone, while the very personable agent walked me through the direct link (support.apple.com/kb/dl1814) Clicking the download button there got me to another page.  Clicking download there got me a \"Thanks you for downloading...\" but the download didn't begin.  \nI repeated this step with chrome, firefox and safari.  No joy.\nBooted into safe mode.  Didn't help. \nWent to two other computers, my wife's where I don't have a login, and my laptop, which runs snow leopard.r  No joy from either of those.\nWe left the ticket unresolved.\n\nA: Since the apple advisor was able to perform the download at his end, but I was not able to at my end, my suspicion was that there was a problem with Apple's content distribution network.  \nThis morning I tried again.  No joy.\nOn a hunch I tried logging in on a spare admin account.  No problem. connected to  the apple support site, and downloaded the update. Worked like a charm.\nAt this point it's not clear what happened, but with odd behaviour it does bring up one additional possibility to try:\nAttempt the update as a different user.\n", "Q: Are the keystrokes under guest Ubuntu via Virtualbox supposed to be the same in a Ubuntu? I installed Ubuntu via virtualbox under Mac OS.\nMy keyboard-shortcut experiences with guest Ubuntu until recently were the same as mine with Ubuntu installed directly on a computer.\nFor example, text copy can be done by ctrl-C, instead of Command-C.\nYesterday, I found that right-clicking by tapping the right region of the trackpad in the guest Ubuntu doesn't work, while two-finger tapping does work like right-clicking in PC.\nMy solution was to change the trackpad setting under system preferences of Mac OS, from two-finger tapping to right-region single-finger tapping.\nSo the solution seems to tell me that right-clicking under guest Ubuntu is the same as that in host Mac OS. This is contrary with my previous impression that keyboard shortcuts in guest Ubuntu are almost the same as those in Ubuntu installed directly on a computer. So why is right clicking treated differently?\nThanks.\n\nA: The multitouch events are handled exclusively by OS X and not passed through to the guest OS. Basically, the focus that keyboard and pointer have passes faithfully to the VM. Focus for the trackpad is filtered and not passed. \n", "Q: Edit column browser of a playlist in iTunes 12.4 Whenever I create a new playlist a new design is showing up. The problem here is, I can't edit the column browser anymore i.e. create a new column or change its order or size.\nIs there a way to solve this problem? If it's not possible, is there a way to go back to the previous design without downgrading iTunes?\nI've heard that this new design was for the \"Playlist\" mode and back in 12.2 you were able to change this mode back to \"Song\" mode. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find it. Is it gone, too?\nHere's a picture of the old design:\n\nAnd here one of the new design:\n\n\nA: I've been able to find the tool where you're able to switch between these two modes.

These libraries, named by default 'iPhoto Library.photolibrary' and 'Photos Library.photoslibrary' (see pluralisation in package extension) are stored by default in ~/Photos (the Photos folder in your home folder).\n", "Q: Can I make my apple store app free with ads and give previous buyers ad free add-on? I am planning to make my app free with ads but include an option to remove ads. Can I automatically give the add-on to all the previous buyers?\n\nA: Yes and there's a few different ways to do it.  The path I followed was to release a small update that use NSUserDefaults to write a bool property when the app was installed.  Then, when I distributed the app update with the ads, I'd read if the user had that bool value.  If they did, they were a previous owner and I wouldn't show the ads.  If not, they were a new owner and got the ads.\nYou can do the same thing by having the app set a value on your own server (the app would call your server upon installation with a user-specific string).  This would do the same as using NSUserDefaults except the value is stored on your server and not the user's device.\nThere's a few examples online including how to store the bool value that will stay with the user even if they delete and reinstall the app.\n", "Q: What can I do when iTunes multiplies albums? For as long as I can remember, iTunes has had bugs that will split the songs of an album into multiple albums with the same name when one edits the album name. This happens infrequently and seemingly randomly, and could usually be mitigated by selecting the offending tracks, renaming the album and then renaming it back to the correct title. But now I have this:\n\nAnd the trick does not work. Changing the album title actually renames it but does nothing to join the fragments. Oddly, renaming the artist does rename the artist, but the change does not show in the artist bar on the left. Does anyone have the same experience and suggestions as to what to do?\n\n\n*\n\n*I could remove and re-add the songs, but I'd rather not have to re-add them to every playlist and lose play count and stuff\n\n*Is it possible to edit the itunes database directly somehow?\n\n\niTunes version 12\n\nA: I often have this issue, and I can fix it by selecting all of the offending tracks (e.g. the entire album) using Option + click, right clicking and changing the \"Album Artist\" to something random (I usually use \"asdf\") and then doing to same thing to change it to the correct Album Artist. Doing this forces iTunes to re-index the album and put the parts together.\nIf this does not fix it, then look for any other data that should match between all the tracks but doesn't. iTunes is splitting the album because of one of the tags, and by setting the offending tag to the same on all of the songs it forces iTunes to put it together.\n\nA: As willem.hill stated correctly: the best way in approaching this issue, is to change all tracks of the album in question in one go.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Show items in list, grid or with Cover Flow mode\n\n*Mark the first track, hold shift, the click the last track, then hit  + i > which opens Multipe Item Information preferences window\n\n*Now rename the complete album in one go, by putting in all the information.\n\n\n\n", "Q: what do App Memory, Wired Memory, and Compressed mean? In Activity monitor, what do App Memory, Wired Memory, and Compressed mean? \nFor example, \n\nI am used to the columns in the output of free from procps-ng under Linux.\nBy the way, how can I install  procps-ng under OS X?\nThanks.\n\nA: Regarding procps-ng - it doesn't make sense to install it on OS X.\nThe utilities in procps-ng are specifically made to parse, interpret and display information from the /proc file system on Linux system. The /proc virtual file system on Linux exposes various information from the kernel itself (and kernel extensions).\nOS X does not run on the Linux kernel. The OS X kernel (Darwin) does not utilise a /proc virtual file system to expose kernel information.\nTherefore it really does not makes sense to run procps-ng on OS X.\nNote that many/most of procps-ng has counterparts on OS X. They come from a different \"family\" so they might look and act slightly different, but they serve the same purpose. For example you'll find commands such as kill, ps, top, uptime, w, uptime, sysctl, etc. on OS X in a factory default install.\n\nA: This wonderful Apple Support article says it all: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201464#memory\nI'll give the short version here:\nThere are three different types of memory, as you have noticed - wired, app, and compressed. Each of these types do something slightly different.\nWired memory\nWired memory refers to memory that cannot be taken out from RAM. The contents of wired memory cannot be paged to your disk (swap), and are used by programs. This memory can't be used anywhere else, and stays in memory until whatever is using it is terminated. Usually, this memory is used by OS X's core functions and belongs to the kernel. In a way, you might consider it meta-memory, the memory that oversees other memory.\nthis other question on wired memory and its answer expands more on wired memory and its use.\nApp memory\nApp memory refers to memory utilised by open/background processes and applications.\nCompressed memory\nCompressed memory refers to memory (that isn't being used), which OS X automatically compresses to free up RAM for other processes to use.\n\nThis may be unrelated to your question, but I thought I'd expand on it:\nSwap memory\nSwap memory is RAM contents that have been paged out to disk to free up RAM within memory modules. The entire concept of swap memory is sort of \"expanding\" RAM by taking parts of your hard disk and writing RAM contents into it.\nAdditional resource: Apple Developer Library: Virtual Memory\n", "Q: I can't sync my music to my new iPhone I'm trying to move my music from my old iPhone 5 (purchased in the US) to my new iPhone 5s (purchased in Canada). My music is backed up to my iCloud account and basically when I got the new phone I added my Apple account so everything (apps, notes, texts, emails, photos, vids, etc.) and transferred everything except for my music. I've been carrying both phones so I can listen to music but that's really cumbersome.\nFor whatever reason whenever I tried synching my new phone to my iTunes the playlist names are there but there are no files. When I checked which devices were backed up on my iTunes, it just lists my new iPhone. The files are there in my iTunes library, but I just can't get them to transfer.\nIf it makes a difference, under settings, and music, there is no option under the library heading on either iPhone to turn on iCloud music library. Moreover, the the little iPhone icon in iTunes that usually pops up when you plug it into your laptop doesn't appear. This is the iTunes icon you click on that lets you access things on your iPhone.\nWhat do I do?\n\nA: Go to Settings > Music. Is \"Show Apple Music\" switched to \"on?\" \nYou cannot have Apple Music enabled and sync your music library. It will only make those songs in your library available via the cloud.\nYou must choose, for your device, if you want to have Apple Music (which has a paid subscription fee of $9.99 after a trial period) -or- sync your music library. \nYou can, however, download songs individually onto your device for offline use.\n", "Q: Where is my missing drive space? I have a 2012 Mac mini running the latest Yosemite that I use as a server for file sharing, FileMaker, calibre, Time Machine and Plex. The Finder reports that the internal drive has a capacity of 499.25 GB with 48.03 GB available.\nListing the drive's contents with all folder sizes calculated looks like the following (having used defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE in the Terminal):\n\nAdding all that up brings me to a total of less than 350 GB. Running sudo du -sh .DocumentRevisions-V100/ reveals that that folder is only 17 M, contributing very little to the total.\nSo I seem to be missing about 100 GB of space. This isn't an emergency, I'm just trying to figure this out. Why am I seeing a discrepancy between the amount of space reported as available from the Finder and the amount of space I expect there to be given the size of the files and folders I see?\n\nA: If you don't have view permissions it will report itself as taking zero space to the directory that encloses it. This is especially visible with the \"Users\" folder. Take another User's folder.\n\nNotice how oddly small this folder appears. Yet it is reporting a valid file size, as I have read permissions to the folder.\nNow look at the contents of this folder.\n\nNotice the variety of folder that I don't have view permissions for. As a result, when viewing the overall user folder, it simply assumes they take no space instead of reporting an error of some sort. Thus, the folder size is deceptively small.\nIf you want a more accurate report, I would recommend using something like DaisyDisk or a free alternative to scan the entire disk as admin so you can properly see what's taking up space.\n", "Q: Removing iCloud from my PC I keep getting a message on my PC that my iCloud is almost full.\nI moved the photos on my phone to my computer by cable and store it in my photos.\nCan I remove iCloud from my PC, and still keep it on my iPhone and iPad?\nIf I remove it from my computer, will I still be able to keep iCloud on my iPhone5 and my iPad2?\nI want the photos to work between my iPhone and iPad2 only.\nI can email my photos I take with my phone to my computer or I can connect it to a cable and just download it directly right?\n\nA: Yes, you can remove iCloud from your PC if you don't want it there anymore.  You won't be able to access any of your iCloud files or photos directly on your PC anymore.  If you need any file/photo from iCloud on your PC, you can go to iCloud.com in your browser.  From there you can access everything in iCloud just like it was on your computer.\n\nA: If your iCloud storage is almost full, removing the program from your computer won't help you.  Deleting the program on a PC won't affect the storage. You need to remove files from iCloud itself.\nFor example, last time my storage was full, I copied all of my pictures out of iCloud and then deleted the originals to free up space. This is simpler using the Mac Photos app; I'm not sure what the best way to do this on a PC would be.\n", "Q: My iPhone only shows the Wi-Fi symbol even when I'm using data? I noticed when I was checking a notification the other day that even when I was using 4G or LTE data, my phone just showed the Wi-Fi symbol, even when I turned Wi-Fi fully off. I am on an iPhone 5.\n\nA: I just noticed the same thing. I see the 5 bars then my carrier then where I would normally see LTE, 3G etc I see the wifi symbol. When wifi is turned off that symbol grays out. It used to go away. \nI can no longer tell if I am on LTE or a lesser signal. \n", "Q: How to open a URL without launching a new safari tab?

Of course, only works with iTunes installed.\n", "Q: iMac loading bar gets stuck halfway then reboots OSX 10.11.5 iMac turns on fine but loading bar gets to just over 50% and then a horizontal bar across the screen shows, then the screen goes black then to white. It stays at white then iMac turns itself off and restarts. This happens every time I try turning it on, booting into the backup, booting into recovery mode, and even rebooting from single user mode: the iMac will still be showing the terminal doing its thing the the line appears and mac goes to a white screen then reboots.\nBooting in safe mode and resetting PRAM and SMC have done nothing. \nAny ideas? or tips on how to backup any data and reinstall OSX from single user mode? \n\nA: Have you recently changed anything in the hardware?\nI had this happen once trying to swap drives between two Macbook Pros. They were different hardware versions (a couple of years apart), and the hard drive from the older Macbook did exactly this when trying to boot in the newer Macbook - the old version of the O/S didn't understand the newer hardware, and would get to a certain point, and then reboot.\nAfter I put the drive back in the original (older) Macbook, I upgraded to the latest version of OS X, and was then able to put the drive into the newer Macbook without issue.\nThis doesn't sound like what you're doing (you didn't mentioned swapping any hardware), it does sound like you're having an issue with hardware that can't be properly started. So I'd be assuming hardware issue at this point, which hopefully someone can assist you in how to diagnose that.\n\nA: If you arent able to get into MacOS recovery mode, try internet recovery mode (Command (⌘) + Option (⌥) + R) and see if you are able to run it off of the internet.\nIf this doesnt work for you, then you need to get the Mac inspected at a genius bar. \nIt's likely something wrong with the motherboard.\n", "Q: AirPort Express and ssh So, I've been trying to understand networks a little better and I'm playing around with ssh. I've learned how to set up port forwarding from my AirPort Express directly to my computer, but I am confused on how I am supposed to change the port that is used to accept ssh traffic by the router.\nWhen I set up the port forwarding to my static IP address, I also wanted to change which port the router uses to accept ssh traffic. However, each time I change the public and private TCP ports on the base station and try to connect with ssh by specifying the router port-something like ssh Kyle@123.45.678 -p 1234-I get a connection refused.\nHere is my question. How do I change the port that accepts ssh traffic for the AirPort Express router, and if I change that port and the port accepted on my computer, how do I specify the particular port for the router and the particular port accepted by my computer in the ssh command?\nBoth the AirPort Express and my computer are currently accepting ssh traffic on port 22 (when I have remote login activated, that is). I am trying to change each of these to a different port.\n\nA: I think you're trying to set up port forwarding, to allow yourself to ssh in from outside, and changing the port to keep it slightly more secure? You don't need to change the port used internally (inside your network) - you just need to change the port used from outside of your network. Then, set up a rule that passes connections on the desired port to the internal. You would for example tell the router that incoming connections on port 1234 should be redirected inside your network to the machine at 10.0.1.123 on port 22. There are some instructions here that might help. (I don't have an AirPort but have set up port forwarding for multiple routers - the basic idea is the same for all)\nAsking your computer to accept incoming ssh on another port is more complicated, and (as of El Capitan) apparently requires deactivation of SIP, which is why it may simply be easier to set the AirPort to forward to port 22 by default.\n", "Q: Preventing Chrome from signing me out from Gmail when browsing in icognito When using Google Chrome in incognito mode on iOS on iPhone, it signs me out from Gmail after one or tow hours: how can I prevent it?\n\nA: If I'm correct, using incognito mode means it doesn't save cookies or other caching method to keep you signed in on your device. \n", "Q: I get notification in Mac, though App is installed in iPhone There is one App installed in my iPhone, that is news App. Now, whenever I connect my iPhone to Mac, I get notification also in Mac.\nWhat may be the reason ?\nI want to get rid of this..\n\nEDIT 1\n\nI disable it from Preference. But as shown in the following image, I don't know why this App is shown in Mac.

Recently my Mac Mini was updated to OS X El Capitan from OS X Lion, due to some of my software being incompatible.\nHence, I'd like to downgrade to OS X Lion (10.7), but when trying to download OS X Lion from the Apple website I'm asked to pay for it.\nDo I really need to pay for it as I had the same OS running previously?\n\nA: The Internet Recovery (Option-Command-R at boot) installer will let you install the earliest supported Mac OS X version for your hardware (only as far back as Lion if your device supports an earlier version).\n", "Q: Ethernet Adapter Windows Driver - how to find for BCM5701 I am having troubles with finding driver for my Apple Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.\nI checked the version and I have a BCM5701 chip. These Broadcom drivers don't support my adapter. \nI want to get it working under my second PC Lenovo X1 Carbon with Windows 10 64-bit\nWhere can I find drivers to this ? \n\nA: This is for Windows 7, but should work for Windows 10 \nA quick search on the Apple Support site, I was able to find instructions on downloading the correct driver.  I have condensed them here for quick reference:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Netxtreme Mobile/Desktop Driver.  It will say that it's not supported, but the .inf file does include the requisite driver entries\n\n*Unzip the drivers to a temporary folder on your hard drive (preferably your Desktop so it's easy to find)\n\n*Connect the adaptor to the thunderbolt port \n\n*Reboot Windows \n\n\nWindows should automatically detect the adaptor now and install it. You may need to point the installer at the location where you unzipped the drivers. \nIf that doesn't work, you will need to do this through Device Manager\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Start > Control Panel > Hardware & Sound and open Device Manager \n\n*Click the name of your computer at the top of the device tree \n\n*Click Action at the top of the window and choose Add Legacy Hardware \n\n*Click Next \n\n*Select \"Install hardware that I manually select...\" \n\n*Choose Network Adaptors \n\n*Choose \"Have Disk\" \n\n*Browse to the location of the drivers you unzipped earlier. \n\n*Click the .inf file \n\n*Select Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Ethernet from the list of drivers available \n\n*OK and install \n\n\nYou may need to reboot again with the adaptor plugged into the Thunderbolt port to finish the job\nNote:  Again, these instructions and driver downloads are for Windows 7.  Thought they should work with Windows 10, it is not guaranteed. \nIf having both OS X and Windows 10 support is important, consider getting a USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.  I have personnaly used this exact adapter on an iMac, a MacBook Pro, a Mac Mini (Dual Boot w/ Win 7) and a Surface Pro 3.  \n", "Q: Kernel panic: kernel_task my Mac goes in kernel panic for reasons

Is there a way to add that character to the accent menu?\nI'm looking for an easy way to type Turkish characters on my english keyboard.\n\nA: If your primary purpose is to type Turkish without adding one of the Turkish keyboards provided by Apple, then this can be done by Adding the ABC - Extended keyboard-map. All Turkish letters are easy to type with the \"option\" key, add this keyboard map, and view the layout using Show Keyboard Viewer in the keyboard (change keyboard icon) menu.\nSpecifically - I was not sure whether \"İ/ı\" are available on this layout, but after some experimentation - they are there! \"option-w\" - is adding a 'dot above' a letter, however when pressing \"i\" - it actually removes the dots (there's well thought out design for y'all!). [note that specifically ı/İ - are absent on the \"long press\" mode you're referring to, but using the option key to type is much faster, I regularly type Polish, Swedish, Finnish and now Turkish this way, without even having to switch layouts, and I find it easier than the respective maps] [ Adding letters to the long press mode - is possible as mentioned in in @Tom Gewecke's reply]\nI'm using MacOS 10.14, and generally use the ABC - Extended for several languages. Gladly it also works easily for typing Turkish as well (which I've just started to learn, and use to type in Chat windows).\nThe current mapping is, before the respective letter press:\n\n\n*\n\n*ç ş Ç Ş     : option-c\n\n*ğ Ğ         : option-b\n\n*ı İ         : option-w\n\n*ö ü Ö Ü     : option-u\n\n*â î û Â Î Û : option-6\nNote that it's possible to press the same \"option-shift-(something)\" after the letter, but the result is different - the first gives a \"combined\" letter, while the latter gives a \"letter+combining character\": for example \"ğ / ğ\" - are different (might be rendered a bit differently, the latter is \"g + combing char brev ˘\", in case of \"ı\" - the latter option might render i with an extra combined dot: i̛ - which is probably not what you want.  \n\nA: You can find the answer where this question was asked back in 2011:\nHow to add characters to the press and hold character picker in OS X Lion?\nAn extra step is needed for El Capitan:\nThe keyboard's plists of PressAndHold also can no longer be modified to add the new accents in El Capitain\n\nA: In System preferences, you can change the Input Source to whatever you want. Also, change the region in the Language and Region section to a region where that accented letter is used. That should help!\nIf it doesn't, you can create a shortcut, in the Keyboard section, to achieve typing it quickly.\nHave a nice day :)\n", "Q: Open Scripting Architecture Reference Lots of documents, like this one, refer to the \"Open Scripting Architecture Reference,\" which sounds useful to me. But I can't find it anywhere. Googling the title gets lots of non-authoritative links where people have posted old PDFs of what presumably is an earlier version of the same thing.\nWhere is it?\n\nA: Have a look at https://applescriptlibrary.wordpress.com or use the search engine of your choice. The exact document you ask is here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://applescriptlibrary.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/open-scripting-architecture.pdf\nIt's listed as legacy and from 2007.

Should I type my phone number in or not. I tried to look up how to find and delete viruses but it is mostly Android and Microsoft products.\nMy iPad is an iPad air. But is it possible to get a virus on a iOS device and if so how can I find it and delete it?\n\nA: The website you were visiting was serving you a pop-up to try and get you to enter your phone number. If you just leave that website by clicking cancel and navigating away or closing the whole safari app, you should be fine. While it is technically possible to get a virus on an iOS device, it is incredibly difficult, and in this instance, I think you are safe, I would just avoid going back to that website. If you continue to have issues with your phone after leaving the website, then you might want to post here again, take it to an apple store, or simply reset the phone. But again, I think that is extremely unlikely.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Those messages are, almost always, a scam, trying to get your data, such as phone numbers or email addresses. Leave those sites immediately! Don't worry, getting malware on your iPad is almost impossible with normal use, and even if you did, websites wouldn't be able to check that.\n", "Q: What is this black bar at the bottom of my Dock?

Since I recently upgraded my iPhone, I wanted to try the Continuity features that the Apple ecosystem has to offer. However, since I have a mid 2010 iMac, Handoff is not supported. I've been looking for unofficial resources, and have reached no conclusions.\nHas anyone achieved this, or know how to? Thanks a lot!\nP.S: Here are some articles I've found, just in case they can be useful for you:\nhttp://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/get-continuity-handoff-airdrop-on-old-mac-3582632/\nhttp://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/23/continuity-activation-tool/\n\nA: Yes–but you'll need a hardware upgrade and some third party software.\nContinuity relies on two pieces: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. These need to be \"correct\" to work.\nCheck your iMac to see what Wi-Fi chip you have. To do this, open up System Profiler and look under Wi-Fi. If you have an Atheros chip like this teardown by iFixit shows, you'll need to replace it with a Broadcom BCM94360CD chip. If, however, you have a Broadcom Wi-Fi chip, you can choose to either replace it with the same board, or you can simply install a Bluetooth 4.0 dongle. If you do decide to use a dongle, note a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth 4.0 dongles based on the Cambridge Silicon Radio CSR8510 A10 chip  won't work. Try to use dongles based on the Broadcom BCM20702 chip, which are similar to the ones used by Apple, such as the Asus BT400, IOGEAR GBU521 and GMYLE\n\n*Instant Hotspot currently doesn't work reliably when using a dongle.\n\n\nOnce you've done that, use the Continuity Activation Tool to activate Continuity with your upgraded Mac: just run the app! Note, as always with third party hardware that works on a low level, you should use this with some caution. Make sure you have a backup (just for good caution), and nothing is 100% guaranteed. With that said, it's a very reputable tool, so I wouldn't be too afraid. \n", "Q: How do I kill a daemon and not have it open up again if I can't find it in the LaunchAgents or LaunchDaemons? So I think I downloaded a program from Avatron called Airconnect. I'm not sure, but their website was purple when I looked it up. Anyway, now everytime I check my activity monitor, com.avatron.airconnect.daemon is taking at least 25% of my CPU. What have I done.\nI tried looking up a solution online, and I realized it opens with launchd (I checked through activity monitor), so my research directed me towards System/Library/LaunchAgents, System/Library/LaunchDaemons, or Library/LaunchAgents. I tried looking through all of the folders, and I can't find the airconnect daemon. Please help me. I thought I was smarter than to get viruses. I am so disappointed in myself now.\n\nA: The launch daemon of Avatron Airconnect is installed to /Library/LaunchDaemons. If you want to stop and remove it enter in Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if it is loaded:\nsudo launchctl list | grep avatron\n\n\n*Unload it:\nsudo launchctl stop /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.avatron.airconnect.daemon.plist\nsudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.avatron.airconnect.daemon.plist\n\n\n*To remove it:\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.avatron.airconnect.daemon.plist\n\n\nAfter installing Avatron Airconnect you can uninstall the app from the Airconnect menulet! This should also remove the launch daemon.\n\nA: Software you personally install typically puts its files in several places under your [username]/Library or ~/Library. While holding down the Option key, use the Finder's Go menu to open your Library folder. Check under ~/Library/Application Support, ~/Library/LaunchAgents & ~/Library/Preferences for any files with Avatron or AirConnect in their names & delete them. That should cure your problem.\nBTW- this isn't a virus. \n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 16.04 server on Mac Mini 2006 I have liberated an old 2006 Mac Mini (Model: A1176) from being thrown away and wanted to use it as a Time Capsule for my other Macs.\nTo do this, I want to install Ubuntu server 16.04 LTS to roll my own Time Capsule over my home network.\nHow can I do this? I have downloaded the ISO from Ubuntu's website but when I put it onto a CD-RW and selected it by holding down Option at boot, it then got stuck on the message 'Select CD-ROM Boot Type' with no way to select it (keyboard wasn't loaded).\nCan someone please provide step-by-step on how to do this?\n\nUpdate\nTo answer the comments. The Mac Mini currently has OS X 10.6.8 installed and has the 1.66GHz Intel Core Duo processor. It also has 1GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM\nThe file I downloaded for Ubuntu was called ubuntu-16.04-server-amd64.iso\nThe screenshot for the screen showing after I select the CD on the EFI menu is as follows:\n\nI can't select an option as I don't think the keyboard is loaded.\n\nA: Alright, I see you've added some requisites to your answer. Here goes.\nPart 1: Install Ubuntu 16.04 Server.\nDownload this. (Ubuntu Server 16.04 32-bit)\nThis is done the same way any other Linux install is done. You will insert the CD/DVD, run through the setup to take the entire partition of the Mac Mini, and once you reach a desktop, you're ready for part 2. [Excellent Basic Tutorial, 2012, but relevant]\nPart 2: Getting Time Machine Working within Linux Host (Source)\na. Choose a Data Folder\nFirst you need to pick a directory on your server for your Time Machine data and if it doesn't already exist, create it\nI'll be using /data/timemachine/ for these instructions, if you prefer another location remember to change it in any of the following.\nsudo mkdir -p /data/timemachine\n\nb. Setup a User Account\nYou'll also need Time Machine user account on your server which you can log in with on your Mac. Create one and assign it the previously-created data folder as its home directory and assign ownership of that directory to this user.\nI've chosen to create a user timemachine, but you can pick anything you like.\nsudo adduser --home /data/timemachine timemachine  \n\nsudo chown -R timemachine:timemachine /data/timemachine\nYou'll also need to set the password for this user.\nsudo passwd timemachine\n\nc. Configure Netatalk\nNext, you'll configure Netatalk. Open the existing afp.conf configuration file for editing that is stored in/etc/netatalk/. You can do it in the command line with:\nsudo nano /etc/netatalk/afp.conf\n\nYou can copy my sample configuration exerpt below, editing it to suit your setup. You simply add it to the end ofafp.conf when finished (and save).\n[TimeMachine]\n# is this machine a time machine?\ntime machine = yes\n# directory for time machine data on server\npath = /data/timemachine\n# the max size of the data folder (in Kb)\nvol size limit = 980000\n# users with access to time machine\nvalid users = timemachine\n\nd. Enable Netatalk & Avahi\nNext, using the venerable systemd, you can enable the netatalk and avahi-daemon services:\nsudo systemctl enable netatalk.service  \n\nsudo systemctl start netatalk.service\nsudo systemctl enable avahi-daemon.service\nsudo systemctl start avahi-daemon.service\nOkay, now switch over to your Mac.\n\nMac OS Setup\nBy default Mac OS doesn't show \"unsupported\" or non-Apple Time Machine network drives, but you can easily change that with one Terminal command:\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\n\nIf everything went well after all this, you should now be able to choose your server in the Time Machine preferences when selecting a disk.\n\n(source: samuelhewitt.com) \nYou'll also get a login prompt when attempting to access it, just use the username and password for the Time Machine account you created on your server.\nIf everything has worked thus far, and you are able to perform backups then congrats! You now have a Linux-powered Time Machine.\nPart 3: Getting the server to run headless on the Mini.\nYou will need a DVI to VGA adapter, as well as a VGA dummy to make the machine believe it is plugged into a monitor. The first time you do this, it will have a poor screen resolution. Please just remote into the box (Teamviewer, Logmein, etc) and change the resolution.\nPart 4: Getting your files shared out of Linux Server (in this example below, it's Ubuntu, but instructions are relevant). Source\nInstalling Samba (cross platform ability to share files) in Ubuntu\nSambais a free software re-implementation of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol. Samba provides file and print services for various Windows clients and can integrate with a Windows Server domain, either as a Domain Controller (DC) or as a domain member. So in this article we are using in Per-to-Per network between Windows clients and Linux Ubuntu clients. If you don’t like reading then watch the video tutorials at the end of this post.\n\n\n*\n\n*To install Samba file server in Ubuntu Linux, run the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Tkeys to open Linux terminal command line interface.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now type the “sudo apt-get install Samba” in order to install Samba file server. Type the password to start the installation.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling App In Ubuntu Linux\nRemember; your Ubuntu machine must be connected to internet. Because this apt-get install command will install software from Ubuntu online software repository.\n2. Share File Between Ubuntu and Windows\nLet’s do how to share a file in Ubuntu through file explorer? Open the File and create a folder in Home directory. I have created Netdata folder and required to be share it.\na. Right click the Netdata folder and click Local Network Share. Select Share this folder.\n\nShare File Between Ubuntu and Windows\nTo allow modification to files and folder for users, select Allow others to create and delete files in this folder. Also select Guest access (for people without a user account) to access files from Windows without requiring user and password.\nb. Click Add the Permissions automatically to apply the permission to shared folder.\n\nAdd the Permissions automatically\nIf you want to set a password for shared folder, you shout set a user for Samba file server with “sudo smbpasswd -a Shais” command then type the password twice.\n\nSet a Password to Samba File Server\nNow it ask you user and password when someone want to access the shared folders. The the file sharing from Ubuntu Linux has completed successfully. Let’s test it from Windows 10 client.\n3. Access Shared folders from Windows 10\nYou can access the Linux shared folders from Windows 10 using Network section. To simply access the shared folders type the \\IP address\\Shared folders.\na. In Windows 10 type \\192.168.0.104\\NetData and press enter to open the shared files of Linux Ubuntu.\n\nAccess Network Shared Files\nb. When prompt for network credential, type the user name and password. If you did not set a password for Samba files server, it will not ask the network credentials.\n\nNetwork Credentials\nc. It’s all the contents of shared folder. You can create and delete files or edit the files.\n\nNetwork Shared Files\nTo access the shared files quickly, create a shortcut link to a shared folder in Windows 10.\n\nCreate A Shortcut Link\nRight click on the desktop and click New then click Shortcut.\n\nCreate Shortcut Link\nType the network address of shared folder in Type the location of the item: and click Next.\n\nType a name for Shortcut Link – Share File between Ubuntu and Windows\nType a name for shortcut related to the shared folders contents and click Finish to create the shortcut.\n\nLinux Shared Files\nHere is the shortcut link to the NetData shared folder of Ubuntu Linux. Double click to open it from your desktop. You can create a network Map drive also.\n\nAnd there you have it. You asked for it!  Sources included.\n", "Q: How to automatically paste today's date with keyboard shortcut? I am on El Capitan OS X.\nI want to be able to hit some keyboard shortcut and then have today's date be automatically outputted.\nExample:\nWhen I press Option + D, \"2016_06_13\" is pasted into the text field.\nThe date would be automatically calculated based on my time zone.\nIdeally, I'd like to be able to do this universally. So in Finder, Safari, TextEdit, etc. — not just exclusive to one program.\nHaving this shortcut would streamline my workflow.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Tested (and using it regularly) on macOS Monterey and macOS Ventura.\n\n*\n\n*Create a Quick Action with Automator. Screenshot below. Make sure you select \"Output replaces selected text\".\n\n*Set the Accessibility settings\nin System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy.\n\n*Assign a keyboard shortcut to the Quick Action. (I mapped mine to ⌃⇧⌘D  for Shortdate ((D)ate) and ⌃⇧⌘T for Longdate (date + (T)ime), I even made one for 10 dashes ⌃⇧⌘-.)\n\nI did it this way to avoid using System Events Keystrokes because it will ask for permission in each application you use. Also, I avoided using the system settings for the date formatting. With this, you can just edit the output format as part of the script and can further tweak the output beyond just time/date.\nExamples:\ndate +\"%Y_%m_%d\"\n-- Your Desired Result: 2021_07_11\ndate +\"%Y%m%d %H:%M\"\n-- Result: 20210711 11:51\ndate +\"%Y%m%d\"\n-- Result: 20210711\ndate +\"Today's Date: %Y_%m_%d\"\n-- Result: Today's Date: 2021_07_31\ndate -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\"\n-- Result: ISO 8601 Date - 2021-07-11T14:49:17Z\ndate \"+DATE: %y/%m/%d%nTIME: %H:%M:%S\"\n-- Result: DATE: 21/07/11\n           TIME: 22:48:10\ndate +\"%Y%m%d\"\n-- Result: 20210711 (My preferred Shortdate format)\ndate +\"%Y%m%d %H:%M\"\n-- Result: 20210711 22:58 (My preferred Longdate format)\n\n\n\nA: The easiest way I know of to do this is with 3rd-party text expansion apps.  Personally I use Typinator, with a rule that expands the word dt (i.e. typing D then T) to {YYYY}_{MM}_{DD}, which is Typinator's placeholder format for the current date.  The program uses the local system time and OS accessibility features to fill into nearly any text field, so it would be a good fit for your use case.\nThere are other programs that also do this, the most well known of which is probably TextExpander.  Lifehacker has a good round-up of text expansion apps from a few years ago which may be worth a look.\nIt is also possible to accomplish this with AppleScript and a launching application like Alfred or Quicksilver, as in this answer, but for me the convenience of being able to expand many different abbreviations with an easy-to-learn syntax and UI outweighs the cost savings of using AppleScript.\n\nA: You could do it with Automator like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create new: Services\n\n*Services receives no input in any application\n\n*Use the search to find and add action: Run Applescript\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy and paste the following to the field on the right:\n\n\n\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set _Date to (current date)\n    keystroke ¬\n        (year of _Date as text) & \"_\" & ¬\n        text -2 thru -1 of (\"00\" & ((month of _Date) as integer)) & \"_\" & ¬\n        (day of _Date as text)\nend tell\n\nNote that the day will not have a leading zero like the month does. If you want that, you could replace the line with: (day of _Date as text) with: text -2 thru -1 of (\"00\" & ((day of _Date) as integer))\n\n\n\n*Save with: Cmd + S. Give it a name you can remember in the next step.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you simply use the Save command ( Cmd + S ) instead of Save as... the Service file is automatically put in the right place.\n\n\n\n\nThe Last step would be to define a shortcut for the service you just made.\nGo to mac System preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services and then find the service you saved before. You should find it at the bottom area of the list. Double click the none text on the right side of the service name and give it a shortcut.\n\nA: I wanted to use the system date format for consistency, rather than programming it into the shortcut.\nIt takes about 30 seconds to set up.\n\nIn Automator (Applications folder)\n\n*\n\n*New service\n\n\n*Receives no input in any application\n\n\n*Drag Run Applescript from the Utilities section on the left into the right pane\n\n\n*Check Output replaces selected text at the top of the right pane\n\n\n*In the Applescript window replace all the text with\non run {input, parameters}\nset _date to short date string of (current date)\ntell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke _date\nend tell\nend run\n\n\n\n*Save the service as Short Date workflow\n\n\nIn System Preferences > Keyboard › Shortcuts\n\n*\n\n*Click Services on the left\n\n\n*Short Date will be listed under Text in the right panel\n\n\n*Add a key combination for the new Short Date service\n\nIn System Preferences > Lanuage & Region › Advanced\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Dates tab\n\n\n*Modify the Short: format as desired\n\n\n*Click OK\n\nNote: this system depends on the Services menu under the Application menu. When the menu is not accessible, the service isn't either. It does not work, for example, in the open and save dialog.\n\nA: The above options work well until Mojave. I was trying to insert the current date into the Reminders app with a keystroke and I get an error that suggests that the automator does not have permissions to perform a keystroke command. To allow this go to \"System Settings -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility -> Reminders\" It is annoying that it only permits the action on the specific app but that seems to be the case.\n\nA: I realize this thread is kind of old, however, I seem to have solved the issue with automator, in this instance at least. if you look under Security & Privacy you'll see input monitoring. I took my script and drug it in to add it from the services folder. Once done I stopped receiving the workflow error.\nSo:\nopen finder\npress option and open library\nopen services\nyou'll see the short date script\nopen settings ==> security and privacy ==> privacy ===> input monitoring\nunlock\ndrag your script from the services folder to the list.\nAs near as I can tell it is like with virtualbox, virtualbox has to have permission to monitor the keystrokes in order to use them in the system. It looks like for this script that is the same idea.\n\nA: Spark app can do that. and its free\nhttps://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/14352/spark\n", "Q: Will Adobe CS5 with Java SE 6 runtime work on 10.11 El Capitan?

I cannot turn it off and \nwhen I try to restore it wont let me because it says I need to turn off Find My iPhone.\n\nA: The first thing that you can try is doing a hard shutdown by holding both the power button and the home button for at least ten seconds. If your device still does not turn on or respond, you can try putting it into DFU Mode (recovery mode). To do this, start by plugging your device into your computer with the USB cable. Then hold the power button for around 5 seconds. While you are still holding the power button, press and hold the home button for an additional 10 seconds. At this time, release the power button but keep holding the home button for around 15 seconds. At this point, iTunes should recognize your phone as a device in recovery mode. To exit recovery mode, hold the power button and the home buttons until the device begins booting.\n\nA: Hold down the home and power button for 5-10 seconds, it should reboot, after it boots up, shut it down the usual way by holding the power button and sliding to off.\n\nA: You could also manually disconnect the battery by removing the two bottom screws and then lifting the screen.\nOnce screen is up, unscrew and remove the battery connector shield and then disconnect battery flex.

Is this an iPad Mini 1, 2, 3, or 4?\n\nA: Your friend has a Refurbished iPad Mini (1st Generation, 16GB, Wi-Fi Only, Black). \nThe number on the back should say A1432. \nThe F generally indicates a refurbished product (not always).\n", "Q: Macbook freezes every few seconds when monitor input is switched I have a macbook pro running 10.11.5 El Capitan.  I have it connected to two external monitors -- one using HDMI, and the other using thunderbolt to HDMI.  These two monitors are also connected to another computer using DVI cables.  I'm also using the audio output jack for the macbook.  When I switch the monitor to use the DVI input for the other computer, several things happen on my macbook\n\n\n*\n\n*The mouse and keyboard input freezes for about 3-5 seconds every 3-5 seconds.\n\n*Video freezes intermittently, roughly corresponding with the mouse and keyboard freezes.\n\n*Audio works fine without any freezes until I switch the monitor back to the HDMI input for the macbook, then it is completely muted and the volume control is greyed out until I unplug and replug in the external audio jack.\n\n\nIs there a way for me to share a monitor with another computer without having these freezing problems?  I would like to avoid having to disconnect and reconnect cables unnecessarily.\n\nA: This happens on just about every computer when you are adding or subtracting output monitors. I suppose it has to do with how the(in this case internal) GPU processes the new output. 2 extra monitors is also a big feat for a Macbook's GPU!\nThe only way I am aware of achieving what you want would be through remote desktop. However that has it's own caveats as I'm sure you already know.\n\nA: I'm having what appears to be the same issue - when one of the monitors is switched from DVI (Mac) to HDMI (other PC), the Mac image on the other screen (Displayport) starts freezing.\nI suspect this is caused by the monitor sharing a TMDS receiver between the HDMI and DVI inputs, and the macOS GPU drivers being unable to handle what the monitor does on DVI after switching to HDMI. When I switch the monitor from Mac's HDMI to something other than DVI, eg. DisplayPort input, the problem doesn't happen.\nSo I would suggest, if possible, to hook up the shared monitor using some other input, so that the TMDS receiver isn't shared (works for me - I only share 1 monitor, which I connected to mac with DP). If that's not an option, using a DP->HDMI/DVI adapter may or may not also fix the issue (haven't tested).\nAs for the audio, that's caused by macOS sound output switching to a \"new\" device. There's a suggestion here, but it's not ideal.\n", "Q: Last command source file Despite what I thought, there does not seem to be any concrete/modern answer on the net, so my question is: where does the last command get its information from? I have found the file before, but months ago, and I can not remember where it is. So what is the directory of the file where last keeps its log?\nEDIT\nThis is technically the same as this question, except for one thing: \"/private/var/log/com.apple.launchd\" DOES NOT EXIST on my mac (perhaps it was pre-El Capitan-only) as proven by the fact that\nls /private/var/log | grep \"com.apple.launchd\"\n\nreturns nothing. com.apple.xpc.launchd does exist, but is empty. So please reopen the question, as something is different\n\nA: Since Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) Apple has replaced the utmp/wtmp mechanism with the Apple logging system. See man 5 utmpx for details.  Here is a pertinent excerpt:\nTraditionally, separate files would be used to store the running log of the logins\nand logouts (wtmpx), and the last login of each user (lastlogx).  With the avail-\nability of the Apple system log facility asl(3), these separate files can be\nreplace with log entries, which are automatically generated when utmpx entries are\nwritten.  The API to access the logins and logouts is described in\nendutxent_wtmp(3) while the last login info is accessible with getlastlogx(3).\n\nSee man asl for the programatic interface to the log system.  Apple Syslog saves all its utmp/wtmp/lastlog-like information in /var/log/asl/*.\n", "Q: Alert sound for incoming emails I've searched everywhere but couldn't find it , Would you please guide me where I can find the default MAC Osx sound alert file for new email \nRegards\n\nA: All sounds are stored in HD -> System -> Library -> Sounds\n\n", "Q: Multiple credit cards with Apple ID Is it possible to use multiple credit cards with your Apple ID and switch between them?\nThis is a common option with most online merchants, so I don't see why Apple wouldn't have this as well.

I don't want to manually have to update my credit card info each time I need to make a purchase with the company card.\n\nA: You are not able to switch cards with your Apple ID.

Is there a list of officially-supported Mac models on to which macOS Sierra can be installed?\nI presume it is the same as OS X El Capitan as there does not appear to be many changes which would warrant removing some models of Mac from the supported list, but I can't seem to be able to confirm this.\n\nA: The Keynote announced the following supported hardware: \n\n\n*\n\n*Late 2009: MacBook (MacBook6,1)\n\n*Late 2009: iMac (21.5\" iMac10,1, 27\" iMac10,1 and iMac 10,2)\n\n*Mid 2010: MacBook Pro (13\" MacBookPro7,1, 15\" MacBookPro6,2, 17\" MacBookPro6,1)\n\n*Mid 2010: Mac mini (Macmini4,1)\n\n*Mid 2010 : Mac Pro (MacPro5,1)\n\n*Late 2010: MacBook Air (11\" MacBookAir3,1, 13\" MacBookAir3,2)\n\n\nAll later models are unquestionably compatible. A public list (on Apple's website) is not available yet, but a list may be available in the Release Notes (Developer Only). \nFor the Developer Preview: Registered Developers can access InstallableMachines.plist in InstallESD.dmg for a full list of officially supported Mac board-ids.\nIt may be possible to install on some unsupported hardware through modifying firmware, the installer, or other methods.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 with iOS 9.3.1 stuck restoring My phone was replaced yesterday, and I've since been trying to restore it from the backup I made just before it was replaced.\nI have no greyed out apps, and all my photos are back, but it says I can't install the newest iOS update or make a backup to iCloud because it's still restoring from the iCloud backup.\nI've turned it off and on again, turned wifi off and on again, put it in Airplane mode and switched that off, and also tried resetting it.

You will need to create a bootable install disk (Apple support), e.g. by running \nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app \n\nto install on a drive called MyVolume. Running this will lose you all your content, so you will need to have a backup if you want to retain your files. Otherwise, wait Sierra out…\n\nA: The preferred way is to do a Restore from Time Machine.  Your next option is to do a clean install OS X from USB or other install media; meaning wipe the HDD and install.\n\nA: Best way to downgrade to El Capitan:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new partition\n\n*Reboot and hold down Command R to start Internet Recovery .\nThis will clean install El Capitan.\n\n*After installation, remove the partition of Sierra.\n\n\nSee official documentation of Apple about Internet Recovery\nDone.\n\nA: Ok so i just bought this macbook pro and i am really good with computers. However, this is my first mac. So the person i bought it from didnt know how to reboot it so i went online. \nCommand+R brings up the 4 option menu. I erased the hard drive and when i went to reinstall i wasnt able to install el capitan using my icloud id that i have for my ipad. It said temporarily not available. \nSo i got pissed and shut down the computer as everything i had read had not worked. After shutting it down i turned it back on and a folder with a question mark came on and couldnt get anywhere. Shut it down again.\nRestarted it while holding down command+R and the internet system recovery began. Had to connect to wifi. BAMCIS it was that easy to get it to factory settings. It installed OS X LION and i then upgraded to Sierra. Only to realize that Serato Scratch live was not compatible with Sierra as i am running SL1 lol. \nAnyways had to go back to OS X LION so same process erase hard drive. Shut down computer. Command+R to start internet system recovery go back to OS X Lion. Pretty simple method if you want to go back without a hastle or got a laptop off someone and are getting the temporarily not available message.

Or are those messages sent while you weren't logged in just on iPhone and there will be a gap in your Mac messages for the period you were logged out? \n\nA: In my experience, iMessage syncing is not reliable but it does work most of the time. As a result, it's difficult to ascertain a definitive answer. The intended behavior is as you described it and there should be no gap in Mac message history. \nHowever, for me, it doesn't sync 100% of messages all of the time. It does sync most of the time. The other thing that can happen is a time delay. For example, I booted up my Mac after an extended period of having it off and no messages came in. The next day when I booted it up, everything came in.\nIf most of your messages are not syncing, I suggest disabling iMessage on your iMac and iPhone and then re-enabling it both places. \n", "Q: How do I remove bookmarks from Terminal window?

Since the browser has the IP addresses of all the links in\n  advance,  DNS pre-fetching ensures that any links that may you click\n  on that webpage will load faster. However, when pre-fetching fails,\n  something that’s not very uncommon, you may get the “link broken”\n  error. (source)\n\nTo disable the pre-fetching, go to Tools > Options  (or  Preferences  on a Mac) >  Under the Hood  and uncheck the setting that says “Use DNS pre-fetching to improve page load performance.”\nOtherwise you can also try simply clearing the cache of that specific site.\n", "Q: File/Folder Bi-directional Sync I need a good bi-directional file/folder sync utility for my Mac running OS X El Capitan 10.11.5. I have tried some options but none seem to perform the tasks exactly that I need. What I need is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*A utility that will update files and folder structure between my primary Mac HD and an NAS and it has to be bi-directional. The solutions I have tried so far either only update files in one direction or they will not update the folder structure between the two drives.\n\n*Automation as much as possible. I have reviewed a couple of utilities that claim the ability to do everything I need in #1 but will only work when launched manually.\nThe main utilities I have tried so far are Unison, rsync and the built in file merger capability of Mac OS X.

I have connected with afp which Unison does not recognize.\nRsync will update files if I run it twice, in two different directions. The problem with this approach is there is no analysis done by Rsync to determine which file version is the most recent.\nThe built in capability of Mac OS X to merge files has limited capability that works but it only works for files, not for folders.\nI am basically looking for something similar to the offline file option available in Windows.\nThanks\n\nA: Think about your exact requirements, and check whether they would also allow using a synchronization tool that is not file-oriented.

If that number appeared in an email, iOS 9 lets you know who might be calling.

I think this might be related.\nSo if you are using 11.2 you may need to wait for a bug fix.\n\nA: iOS scans your email for contact info.

The closest you could get to having this button is also having Google Drive, sending from OneDrive to GoogleDrive from inside of OneDrive or a third party multi-cloud app and then using the Google Drive attachment button which exists within the Gmail app. The 'export to Gmail' option you've already found within OneDrive seems like the much better solution to me.\nQuestion 2: I believe the answer to this one is that it's not possible to save the drafts. If you want to work on the email later and hence don't want to send it immediately, the best work-around is to send it to yourself and then edit it and send to the final recipient from your inbox.\nSadly I can't offer a better solution but hopefully this is of some help or at least offers some closure to your query.\nBest wishes,\nJB_199\n\nA: just log into gmail account through web browser, not an app and tick a computer version of display, not a mobile. Once you do that you can send all kinds of files. Even in web browser and gmail without computer mode of display you can still send just images. With computer display mode you are allowed to attach each file in your OneDrive or GDisc or whatever cloud you use. :)\n\nA: mail app is the best for emails on iphone but you cannot sign in on another app using gmail account as it sends the link only on gmail app and not in mail app.any solution to cancel the sign in verification process\n\nA: Copy & paste:\nIn the Word list of documents, share your document \"To another app\" and there select Copy.\nIn the Gmail compose window (this certainly works in the \"Mail\" app, surely in Gmail too), Paste your document. This works for any message, including a draft or reply.\n\nA: I have the same problem but I work around it by using \"Mail\" app from iPad.\n", "Q: How to position cursor precisely on an iPhone running iOS 9.3.x?

The laptop has a DVI port, which I believe is the only display output for it. \nSo I'm trying to obtain something like this DVI to VGA adapter or a DVI to HDMI adapter. The tricky thing is I need to obtain this in 32 hours for a job interview, so it looks as though mail order is not an option. Transferring files to another computer might be an option, but it would be a little more awkward. \nIs there a brick and mortar store that carries mac adapters that are this old? In case it is relevant, I am in the Boston, MA area. Not sure if the official Apple Store would carry them anymore. \n\nA: Best Buy has many adapters, including this DVI to HDMI converter.\n", "Q: \"Differentiate without color\" setting in Accessibility System Preferences In the Accessibility preference pane of El Capitan's System Preferences, I've noticed a \"Differentiate without color\" setting that I didn't notice before.\n\nDoes anyone know to what extent this setting will change the experience of Finder?\nI couldn't find much in the help and the only link I found about this was very succinct (I can't believe this setting only acts on the dots of this exemple).\nI would love to know exactly how toggling this setting would affect the Mac's OS display, and its apps.\n\nA: The only change I've found so far is changing the dots in Messages, as some other users have pointed out. I couldn't find any changes in Finder, which surprised me, since Tags would definitely benefit from this feature.\nEDIT 1: This book excerpt would seem to corroborate that: https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/os-x-yosemite/9781491948484/ch09s02.html\n", "Q: Xcode error The maximum number of apps for free development profiles has been reached I am under the age of 18 so I can't get into the Apple Developer program. I am forced to just use my free developer account and I have been for the past year. Today for some reason I am getting this error:\nThe maximum number of apps for free development profiles has been reached.\nI've had a similar error to this before when I was creating new apps left and right and it said I had too much profiles for the week, so I waited and continued development. This error on the other hand isn't giving me any actions to fix the issue and I can't solve on myself.\nIs there a way to possible delate some of the developer profiles that I have registered? Do I just need to wait a couple of days? I don't know what to do because the error message has no recommended action. Thanks!\n\nA: In my case this guide worked; that is, in Xcode go to Window → Devices then under Installed Apps delete some of your apps and afterwards I could run my own apps on the device again.\nI also rebooted the phone beforehand, but I assume that was not necessary.\n\nA: So I went back to Xcode 7 and created a new app and tried to install it on my device and I found that it gave me the error that I can only make 10 apps per week. Xcode 8 must just not be able to give you that error message yet. Basically, I just need to wait for the week to be over.\n\nA: I succeeded by removing all the unneeded provisioning profiles from the device itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Xcode Menu, go to Window → Devices.\n\n*Right-click the device that is giving the problem.\n\n*Choose Show Provisioning Profiles and delete some profiles to make room for new ones.\n\nA: I had Provisioning Profiles on my device that I couldn't delete. Solution was going to Window > Devices and Simulators, then right-click your physical device and Unpair Device.\nPair your device again after, and the other provisional profiles that couldn't be removed are now gone.\n", "Q: how to force OSX to refresh the Text Replace -list after losing it? (still on iOS safe&sound) I use a lot of text replace on iOS + OSX, but today I woke up and my OSX El Capitan has lost it's text replace list. I have about 40 different text replaces there (long urls, bankaccount numbers, addresses etc), and they're on my iPhone but I'm wondering how to force-slam them back onto OSX, without having to copypaste one at a time from my iPhone to iCloud Notes and then to the Settings -> Keyboard -> Text replace?\nAlso, does anyone know if these are actually on the iCloud at all?\n\nA: Unfortunately the answer seems to be: \"Just boot your Mac and log in and see if they come back\". And yep, they do. How weird.\nHere's to wishing there was a way to press a button and force a reload of the Text Replacement data.\n", "Q: What is the benefit of nanosecond granularity? Apple recently announced a new file system for Apple products, Apple File System (APFS).  Amongst the characteristics, is Nanosecond Timestamp Granularity. Sure, this sounds impressive, and is a great improvement compared to one-second granularity of HFS+.\nLee Hutchinson writes that:\n\nNanosecond timestamps are important in a modern file system because\nthey help with atomicity—in a file system that keeps a record of\nwrites, having nanosecond-level granularity is important in tracking\nthe order of operations.\n\nHow does nanosecond granularity improve my experience as a user of Apple products?  Or is something I'm not likely to notice?\n\nA: It makes your file system less likely to lose or corrupt data if it is shut down incorrectly, e.g. by turning your computer off instead of shutting it down. It doesn't affect the user experience except for making your file system more reliable. \n", "Q: How to remove __MACOSX folder in a list of zip files (not a single zip file)?

Either of thrre causes may lead to this no DNS servers:\n - the DNS servers of your ISP have changed and your router configuration\n   wasn't upgraded,\n - the DNS servers of your ISOP aren't reachable,\n - your router was hacked and a bad DNS server IP address was provided to\n   route all your traffic toward booby trapped web servers.\nTo analyse further this problem, just check what is the IP address configured at your router level. You might include its complete configuration within your original question, so as to get further help.\nIf you see that your router configuration was changed without\nyour knowledge, change its default password ASAP, and\nrestore its correct configuration.\n\nA: Don't know if this will help but here you go: https://origin-discussions-us.apple.com/thread/6617003 \nIt seemed to work for me now.

I feel as if I had something exfiltrated from it while I was outside. To cure my paranoia, I am making this question on due part. Can anyone tell me how I can view some kind of history or log file under OSX El capitan (if there is any) that can show me all USB devices that were connected to my macbook during a certain time or date?\n\nA: Mounting and unmounting a USB disk should be logged in the log files. You can use the Console app to search through the logs.\nAlso, teach yourself to always lock your screen with a password when leaving the keyboard.\n", "Q: Issue with Hard Reset the iPAD (9.3.2) that is in Single App mode I have an iPad application that runs in Single App Mode. Now if I Hard Reset(Home + Lock button) the iPad there are two different behaviours that I came accross while testing the Single App Mode in different iPads:\nIn some iPads after hard reset, the same application starts on the device and the device remains in Single App Mode.\n\nIn some iPads after hard reset, the same application does not starts and the iPad is no longer in Single App mode.\n\nSo which one is the correct behaviour and how can I achieve same behaviour on each device.\nPlease let me know if any further clarifications are needed regarding this.\n\nA: The iPad should launch the app and stay in single-app mode when it restarts after a hard reset. That's the behavior that I get on my devices, although I can't state with certainty that the second scenario (app does not start) never happens.\n", "Q: How do I install ios10 without a developer account? Apple announced iOS 10 during WWDC 2016. It looks amazing so I wanna install iOS 10 on my iPhone 6s. But I don't have a developer account of Apple.\n\nA: Without any research on the matter I would say: you can't. \nThat's exactly what developer account are for: so a new software / a new system can be released to a small group of expert users. While the software / system may already look ok in a presentation, it probably still is way too buggy for the average user. So  either be patient, or become a developer. \nAlso, Apple has released the last few major OS upgrades (for both Macs and iPhones/iPads) as Public Beta some months before the official release. This will allow you do get your hands on these new versions some time between now and whenever-the-release-date-will-be.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Xcode 7 in 10.9 OS X? I have very slow Mac with an HDD (MacBook C2D 2.24Ghz/2.40Ghz) and there is no possibility to install El Capitan or Yosemite (very,very slow).\nI want to use a newer Xcode to learn programming though.\nIs there a way to install a newer Xcode with OS X (10.9) – maybe there is patch for Xcode or some hack for exec?\n\nA: If you really wish to remain on Mavericks and not upgrade to El Capitan I would suggest installing it on an external drive or partitioning your main drive just for a test. Make a new 60 gb partition(just in case you actually like El Capitan) and if you are not satisfied with its productivity, trash it. I guess you could use it just as a \"developer\" OS and switch to it only when you'll be using it but that in my opinion would be inconvenient. I am using El Capitan on 2008 MacBook Pro the OS itself runs perfectly. The startup is a bit slow compared to most newer computers and the CPU isn't the best(2x2.4Ghz) but it works fine for such an old machine.\n\nA: You should download El Capitan anyway; if Apple lets you download it onto your machine, it'll work well enough (they have a firm grasp on how well their each of their hardware run each software). Also, Red Eagle 2000 just said, \"I have a Core 2 Duo Mac and El Cap runs well on it.\" \nSo go ahead and download El Capitan and the latest version of Xcode; I really doubt you'll regret it.\n", "Q: Can I delete this folder? Library -> Application Support -> iOSinstaller I have run out of space on my 13\" MacBook Pro Retina (Early 2015).\nI used DiskInventoryX to see what's taking up so much space and I saw that a folder in my Library was over 50 GB.\nThe folder in question is: /Users/Ruzin/Library/Application Support/iOSinstaller\nThe contents of the folder and the files that are taking up a lot space are text files\n(See included screenshots)\nMy question is:\nIs it safe to delete this folder? Which app created it?\n\n\n\nA: I tried deleting the folder and the system was fine after that. The file wasn't created by the PopcornTime app for Mac but the iOSInstaller of PopcornTime. I tried to install the app on my iPad and the installer created that folder and all those large files.\nSo to answer the question: YES you can delete that folder and all the files inside it.\n", "Q: Apps in El Capitan won't close when clicking the red close button Apps won't close when clicking the red close button in El Capitan. The \"open indicator\" stays on the app icon, the icon stays in the dock even if \"keep in dock\" isn't checked, and the app shows up in alt-tab. This is very odd to me since in Yosemite they closed just fine. I don't mind so much if the app stay open in the background, but if I use every app in a day and close them all, they all still look like they're open. This is confusing, and to me makes the close button no different than minimize. In fact, if you enable \"minimize windows into application icon,\" the close and minimize basically act the same. Is this a bug, or a change? Any idea how to fix it? I saw a post recommending to uncheck \"Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps,\" but this option seems to be gone.\nEdit: I realized that when I was using Yosemite I had cDock installed. Maybe this program let me limit app indicators to apps with open instances in an old version. It doesn't appear to now.\n\nA: There is a difference between closing a window and quitting an app. Many apps continue running even if they have no windows open, although newer versions OS X can close them if it needs the RAM (if the app is coded in the appropriate way). \nIf you want to be sure the app is removed from the Dock and ⌘ Command Tab switcher, use ⌘ Command Q or App Menu > Quit.\n", "Q: Can someone who registered my iPhone read all my text messages? My ex-husband registered my iPhone and I have found out he has been using iCloud to check up on my every move (the iPhone he got me is connected to his iCloud account).  Will he have been able to read all of my personal text messages exchanged through the iPhone?  And is there anything I can do to prevent him from reading my messages in the future?\n\nA: Will he be able to read all of my iPhone's text messages?\nYes. If he has an iPad, Mac, or iPhone hooked up to the same iCloud account as you use on your iPhone, then all of the texts you receive will notify him too, and he can see your sent texts and send some of his own too. He can also (if he's crafty) restore a new iPhone from an iCloud backup of your iPhone and thus copy data from all of your apps. \nDo I have any rights?\nYou can certainly sign out of his iCloud account (go to the Settings app on your iPhone, scroll down and tap iCloud, then scroll down again and tap Sign Out). Then, create your own new iCloud account (go to https://icloud.com in a web browser). Be very sure to set it up with a strong, original password you've never used before, and ensure that your ex does not have access to the email account you set up iCloud with. Then as an added security precaution, you should set up Two-Factor Authentication on your iCloud account which ensures that anyone signing on to your account would need physical access to your iPhone. For a guide on setting up Two-Factor Authentication, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915.\nNow your ex will not be able to see your iCloud data.\nTip from user Alexis: do not set the recovery questions to something your ex would be able to guess. Instead, make up false answers and store it somewhere local (not anywhere in the cloud!!) like on a flash drive, an offline note, or even a piece of paper.\n", "Q: Why does new Time Machine & Migrate fail with SD My MacBook Air had a Time Machine backup of my 60g partition on 80g partition of SD card. The drive needed reformatting, but when I tried to restore the TM backup after disk was erased, CMD-R wouldn't boot the SD card--it would see it but not boot.\nNow, I've destroyed that TM backup and completely started over both with a new encrypted 80g system partition (OS X 10.11.5 El Cap) on the Air, and 95g Time Machine partition  (exfat) on the SD. \nLast night I did a complete TM backup. But this AM when I attempted to test a restore via Migration and CMD-R at startup both attempts failed. \nMigration app could not recognize the SD, CMD-R would see the SD volume but when I'm at the Select System Backup screen, the file browser window shows the message, No system backups were found.\"\nThis seems to be more complicated than I expected. Should I be doing more reading at Apple support or is there a simpler answer?\n\nA: A common Time Machine backup drive (with the root folder /Backups.backupdb/Computername/... only) itself is no bootable system. You always have to boot from Recovery Mode, Internet Recovery Mode or another bootable drive containing a bootable base or full OS X.\nBooted to one of the mentioned systems allows you to restore the Time Machine backup to your main volume.\nAdditionally bootable systems require a GUID partition table and the volume has to be formatted with either HFS+ or HFS+ journaled. The latter is recommended/required for Time Machine backup drives. You may use an ExFAT volume but this needs additional configuration: you have to create a sparsebundle file, mount it and choose this one as backup volume.\n", "Q: How to log in to turn off Num Lock on a MacBook Pro when you can't login? How do I turn off Num Lock on my MacBook Pro when I can't log in to get to System Preferences?\n\nA: Try disabling mouse keys.

And if not, how could this happen?\n(Should I inform my telecommunication provider about this matter?)\n\nA: Make sure that your friend does not have your SIM card or the voicemail password you set up with your carrier.  If those two things are save your voicemail should be as well.\n", "Q: How do I remove the .local domain from sent mail? I am running OS X Server on Snow Leopard (10.6), but I believe this same issue affects newer versions as well. (If the problem can be resolved by switching to a newer version, that would be welcome information.)\nMy server identifies itself as xxx-com.local rather than xxx.com. For example:\nThis is the mail system at host xxx-com.local.\nAlthough I have not had problems (other than the ugliness of this) in the past, I have recently had mail bounce because of this problem. For example:\nDiagnostic-Code: smtp; 554 5.7.1 <xxx-com.local>: Helo command\n   rejected: ACCESS DENIED. Your email was rejected because the sending mail\n   server does not identify itself correctly (.local)\nI understand that this is the Bonjour name, but Bonjour is not applicable outside of my local network. How can I force my email server to identify itself correctly?\n\nA: The solution is to edit the main.cf file in /etc/postfix, and change the myhostname = xxx-com.local line to myhostname = xxx.com. OS X Server appears to honor this change, and not attempt to change it back. However, in my opinion, OS X Server should not have chosen such an absurd default value.\n", "Q: iPhone 6S (iOS 9.3.2) starts switching off whenever battery is low So I have an iPhone 6S running iOS 9.3.2 and recently, I have observed this very annoying trend.\nThe phone switches off automatically when the battery level is around 15-25% [It always happens in this range]. \nI might not be using a very power consuming app, maybe writing a mail or checking my messages and it turns off. When I switch on the phone again, it automatically turns off within a minute.\nOnly when I leave it as it is for 15 minutes maybe, it turns on again.\nThis is not regular but does happen once every 4-5 days.\nIs there anything I can do to investigate and maybe get rid of this issue?\nThanks.\n\nA: This happened to me when my iPhone 5 battery died. If it's less than a year old, take it to an Apple Store or Authorized Reseller for replacement.\nIf it's older and you don't have an AppleCare plan, you can buy a compatible battery from eBay; I did and has worked great for over a year. \nIt may even happen that Apple replaces it for free if it's a batch of defective batteries (mine was, but I replaced it before the announcement.\nYou can check the health of your battery with coconutBattery if you have a Mac.\n", "Q: How can I set up my iPad so I don't have to type in my password every time I try to download an app? I have an iPad 4 and I've searched everywhere for the answer to my question. And every website I've been to has given me the exact same answer. I've tried over and over, but it's not working. I've tried resetting my iPad, and I even bought a new iPad recently, and it's doing the same thing. I couldn't figure out how to add an image to my question, so I set my profile pic as a screenshot of my password settings.\n\nA: You can only remove password authorization for free apps. You can set it so it only asks for it after 15 minutes on paid apps, that is, if you purchased one, it will only ask you for your password if more than 15 minutes have passed when you try to buy a second one. \nThis restriction does not apply for Apple TV.\nCheck this Apple Support document for further information: Manage your iTunes Store and App Store password preferences\n", "Q: Turn off non-Wifi Internet access on iOS I want to use internet only via Wifi, and be asked if I want to use the internet via my SIM (3G or so).\nHow can I do that?

I have Instagram and Google Drive both installed on my iPhone. I want to post on Instagram some photos from Google Drive. Have somebody any ideas how to do that, because in Insta library I have only photos from my iPhone camera.\n\nA: To share a photo from your Google Drive to Instagram on your iPhone, you open the photo you want to share (by tapping on it), on the top right you'll see 3 little dots, tap the dots, and you'll get a list of options.  Choose the 'Open in' option and that will give you the option to share with Facebook etc.  if Instagram isn't there, go to the More option and enable it.  Hope that helps - took me ages to work it out!\n\nA: Since you are specifically asking for how to share from your \"Insta library\", by which you mean you'd like for photos and videos from Google Drive to behave like they're on your Camera Roll, here is the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press 3 dots on the photo/video you'd like to post\n\n*Press Send a copy\n\n*Scroll down, and select either \"Save photo\" or \"Save video\"\n\n\n\nNow, when you open Instagram and try to post from your library, the item will show up as though it's in your Camera Roll.\nThis allows you to use the other options that Instagram offers, such as people or location tagging, cross posting, etc\nImage source\n\nA: in gdrive choose the image and in the options menu click send a copy and then open in \"copy to Instagram\" is a choice\n\nA: Use “open in” to email it to yourself. Save to phone right from the email, then upload to Instagram from iPhone photos like normal. \nThe worst part is that you have to email them one at a time as it won’t let you use “open in” on more than one item at a time (the option doesn’t even show up if you have multiple items selected).  \nGood luck!\n(This worked for me on 5/27/18)\nEdit: I only had to use this method because I had two photos and one video that I wanted to post in the same post. If you only have one item you can use “share item” directly to Instagram, as another person has commented. :)\n", "Q: In OS X Yosemite, FileVault, \"Enable Users\" is not available This is an inconsistency I've found compared to Apple docs on this, and to all the answers in forums online, and to another laptop in my care, similarly configured.\nMy user account is an Admin account.\nEven after unlocking the preference pane for FileVault, \"Enable Users\" is not an option.

If you want to jailbreak your iPhone, there's a few apps that do this exact thing.\nThis sounds like it would be a good idea so I recommend you let Apple know you want this on their iPhone Feedback page.\n\nA: This is possible in iOS 14 using the Shortcuts app. You have to create an automation to enable the airplane mode in the evening and another automation to disable it in the morning.\nI used the following:\n\n*\n\n*Create automation\n\n*At 22:30 → Airplane mode ON\n\n*Disable “Ask before running”\n\n*Finish\n\nThe same process for the morning\n\n*\n\n*Create automation\n\n*At 5:30 → Airplane mode OFF\n\n*Disable “Ask before running”\n\n*Finish\n\nAnother approach.\nOn the other side, since many would want to schedule the Airplane during the night, I can recommend from my own experience that leaving the  devices (phone, computer, tablet), in a different room than the bedroom is a good idea.\nI built this habit in the last months and I use my CASIO watch to wake me up every morning.\n", "Q: How to repair HFS+ partition?

I have some iTunes music files that are all capitalized letters and others that are normal small case letters. Instead of me going through and renaming each capitalized music file’s data is there a way that I could make iTunes default all music files and their data to small caps? …a way in Terminal or through and the iTunes Music Library.xml file, or…?\nI have swapped out the iTunes Music Library.xml file and the iTunes Library.itl file with new fresh files from an unused iTunes from another computer, but when I reinstall music files back into the Music folder it goes right back to being capitalized letters even though I had changed those large caps to small caps earlier. \nI prefer not to rename 100’s of music files so I’m hoping there is a simpler way of doing this via some forced code somewhere. Any suggestions?\n\nA: You asked specifically about defaulting all music files and their data to small caps. I think you mean \"title case,\" like this:\nThis Is Title Case\nAssuming that is what you want, and considering that you mention you already have some files that are all caps and others that are all lower case, perhaps you will get the result you want by changing the names-- automatically-- inside of iTunes. Not quite \"on the way in\" but easily and quickly afterward.\niTunes is very AppleScript-able and it can solve your problem. Here is a script that I wrote to do it. Note that it operates on whichever tracks are selected. I was using iTunes 12.4.1.6 to test, with \"My Music\" clicked at the top and \"Songs\" clicked in the sidebar to the left. I select multiple tracks and then ran this script in the Script Editor:\n-- Uses the satimage osax\n-- Get it at http://www.satimage.fr/software/en/downloads/downloads_companion_osaxen.html\n\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    set the_tracks to the selection\n    repeat with a_track in the_tracks\n        set the_old_name to name of a_track as string\n        set the_new_name to titlecase the_old_name\n        set the name of a_track to the_new_name\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nVery important: you must install the Satimage OSAX as indicated in the script. Plain vanilla AppleScript does not do \"titlecase\" out of the box. There are ways to do it but the Satimage OSAX is the fastest and easiest.\nI wrote the script to be self-explanatory and it could be sped up a little. Still, this should do the job for you. I applied the script to 100 tracks and it finished in less than three seconds. You might try it on just a couple of badly-formatted titles to see it work before selecting a large number of tracks. Test the script and be sure it does what you want before making wholesale changes to your iTunes library.\nYes you would have to run the script again if you imported more songs. But, you could make a Smart Playlist based on Date Added and run the script once a month or so on whatever new tracks you'd imported (and they would be in that Smart Playlist).\nAppleScript can \"get\" and \"set\" a lot of information for an iTunes track. Title, Album, etc. Here is what you get when you run this script (with some track or tracks selected in iTunes):\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    set the_tracks to the selection\n    set my_track to item 1 of the_tracks\n    set x to properties of my_track\nend tell\n\n{class:file track, id:32579, index:23, name:\"Agnus Dei\", persistent ID:\"23958CCD4BBB2A10\", database ID:11459, date added:date \"Wednesday, March 16, 2011 at 10:01:56 AM\", time:\"6:06\", duration:366.471008300781, artist:\"John Rutter\", album artist:\"\", composer:\"\", album:\"Requiem\", genre:\"misc\", bit rate:128, sample rate:44100, track count:0, track number:5, disc count:0, disc number:0, size:5864189, volume adjustment:0, year:0, comment:\"\", EQ:\"\", kind:\"MPEG audio file\", media kind:music, video kind:none, modification date:date \"Thursday, June 16, 2016 at 8:28:57 AM\", enabled:true, start:0.0, finish:366.471008300781, played count:0, skipped count:0, compilation:false, rating:0, bpm:0, grouping:\"\", bookmarkable:false, bookmark:0.0, shufflable:true, lyrics:\"\", category:\"\", description:\"\", show:\"\", season number:0, episode ID:\"\", episode number:0, unplayed:true, sort name:\"\", sort album:\"\", sort artist:\"\", sort composer:\"\", sort album artist:\"\", sort show:\"\", loved:false, album loved:false, cloud status:matched, location:alias \"CB SSD:Users:cboyce:Music:iTunes:iTunes Music:John Rutter:Requiem:05 Agnus Dei 1.mp3\"}\nYou can see Name, Artist, Album Artist, Album, Comment, etc. Lots of info that you could get, change the case, and set.\n\nA: TunesMedic can do that plus a lot of other useful organization tasks in iTunes, its five dollars on the app store if my memory serves me right and in my opinion totally worth it as I don't have time for some of the repetitive tasks to keep everything organized\n\n", "Q: Mail won't open anymore OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 I cannot get Mail to open everytime I accidentally try to open it it takes forever and never actually opens and then asks if I want to reindex or just reopen - I have tried both options with no results.

I would like these bookmarks automatically synched into Safari. Is this possible?s\n\nA: To clarify the previous answer.\nKnown issues with Xmarks+Chrome+Safari\nI would like to add some remarks about Xmarks. The use of Xmarks for Safari and Chrome works mostly very well, but in some case, you can encounter conflicts issues.\nContext\nIf you enable Chrome bookmarks synchronisation and if Xmarks plugin is in automatic sync mode (default setting), some conflicts can appear:\n\n\n*\n\n*all your bookmarks folder will appear in double.\n\n*One will be empty, the other contains the bookmarks.\n\n\nIt can be boring to fix that kind of issue manually... Especially when you have a lot of bookmarks. \nHack/Solution\nThe only solution I have found is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep using Google Chrome synchronisation (bookmarks, plug-in and whatever you want).\n\n*Disable the automatic mode of Xmarks plugin (both on Safari and Chrome). \n\n*Then, each time you add a bookmark into safari or chrome think to overwrite Xmarks server with \"upload\" (see Xmarks advanced settings) and then, download the new bookmarks via \"download\". (the image below is an Xmarks for Safari screenshot - You have almost the same panel in Chrome Xmarks plugin).\n\n\nConclusion\nOf course, that trick doesn't make your life easier and is impossible to use when you want to use Safari and Chrome in the same time (too many upload/download to do).\n\n\nA: The only really reliable way to sync between two browsers like Chrome and Safari is to export the bookmarks from the source browser, delete all of the bookmarks in the target browser, and then import. There isn't really a way to \"sync\" them, per se. This will at least allow you to keep your bookmarks updated, but that's about all you're going to get reliably.\nSadly, with XMarks gone as of 4/30/18, there is no longer a feasible multi-browser sync solution that actually works. Since all of the cross-browser sync extensions are faulty, this is really the only safe way on MacOS.\nIf you have a Windows host, the iCloud app actually does support sync with other local Windows browsers so if you happen to have a Windows VM or host about your can have it handle this, according to this article but I have not tried this yet.\nIn lieu a on-line sync tool that works and doesn't collide with Safari sync (which is needed for sync to IOS) it seems like the best approach would be to write a script to sync/merge/deduplicate bookmarks between the bookmarks settings of two or three different browsers. Gone are the days where bookmarks used to be saved in a single HTML file but it shouldn't be too hard to handle this as text without having to maintain a third-party database of bookmarks.\n\nA: UPDATE: Unfortunately, Xmarks was shut down, so it is no longer an option.\n\nYou can use Xmarks to easily sync bookmarks between most desktop browsers, including Google Chrome and Safari.\niOS devices cannot directly sync their native Safari bookmarks with Xmarks, but if you set up Chrome and Safari on your Mac to sync with Xmarks, and turn on iCloud Safari syncing for both your Mac and your iOS device(s), then your iOS Safari bookmarks will be indirectly synced with the ones in Chrome on your Mac.\n\nA: Don't even bother installing iCloud bookmarks extension for Chrome. It works terribly and will screw up your bookmarks. The only solution I found is to use Xmarks, but it's imperfect, and I often check if Apple updated their Chrome extension to fix their issues. Xmarks works, but deleting bookmarks from Chrome doesn't work if you also have iCloud bookmark sync enabled. They will just pop back up sometime later. You may not need iCloud bookmark sync, but if you have an iOS device you do. The only way to delete a bookmark is to do it from OSX/iOS. You may have to do this several times. \n", "Q: Looking for suggestions on scheduling iCloud Photo Library uploads I have a 57GB photo library that I would like to keep in iCloud Photo library, the only problem is that my ISP absolutely murders my download speed whenever I'm uploading anything.\nIs there a way that I can schedule Photos to upload my library only during off-peak hours (rather than waking up at 2am, un-pausing the upload and then pausing it again at 7am manually).\nI was thinking maybe a third party application like Little Snitch might work (I've never tried it) or something along those lines, maybe even some kind of Apple Script.\nI'm a bit over my head with this so I need some help \n\nA: It's a bit complex but here's a way.\nHow to Throttle iCloud Photo Library Uploads\n", "Q: How to open or convert .xwd image dump?

My mom has an iPhone 5 with some exercise videos in the Videos app, which just total about 150MB.\nAfter getting an iPhone 6S Plus, can those videos automatically transferred to the new iPhone through iCloud sync?  I believe the new iPhone is set up as a new iPhone but not \"restored from backup\", and it may keep the new iPhone from having older stuff that isn't needed.  But just the videos, can they be sync'ed by using iCloud?\n\nA: The right way to do this is to use iCloud Photos.

I want to know if I remove the SIM card from my existing phone, will the data and photos and contacts and whatsApp chats will be deleted or will it remain in the phone? Please guide me on this.\n\nA: If you used iCloud in your iPhone 4, it's most likely you will still have your contacts and photos in your 6S Plus if you'll use the same iCloud account. If purchased music from iTunes and apps from the App Store, you will still be able to have them on your new phone. However, chat message history depends on the app developer. Some have servers to save your messages in and make them available in case the app is installed in another phone/platform (like Skype), and some just save your messages locally (on your phone) which makes them unavailable to other installations of the app.\n", "Q: Is there a specific way to capture a part of your screen with QuickTime Player?

Power ran out while I was closing the lid, I suspect, so I plugged it in, and it wouldn't come back up. So I powered it on. It wouldn't then boot.\nTried NVRAM and SMC resets; no success.\nStartup key combos:\nTried starting up in safe mode; no success.\nTried startup manager; no success.\nTried Diagnostics; no problem reported.\nTried Single user mode; no success.\nTried verbose mode - got EFI error.  \nSwapped in another disk to try and restore from an SL DVD from my older MBP; no success (apparently you can't install an older version of OSX than that it shipped with).\nPut knackered disk back in, tried System Restore - success! This got me into Disk Util for ML (original OS for the 2012 MBP) where I could repair the disk. Diskutil found some problems with the EFI, and it booted into My ElCap OS, everything seemed ok. Ran diskutil again for good measure, no problems reported.\nI turned it off so that I could secure the hard disk and the bottom cover of the machine.\nIt then wouldn't boot again.\nI then tried internet recovery and got an error with an exclamation mark over the little globe on the restore screen with an error 'apple.com/support: -2105F'\nThis was now a little beyond me, and Google wasn't helping, so I phoned Apple.

No problems showing on the new SSD.\nInternet restore also fails on new SSD (with the same '-2105F' error.)\nThe only thing I've got going for me right now is that I managed to mount the broken boot disk onto my 2010 MBP and decrypt the volume, figuring that one less obstacle can only help (took 8 1/2 hours, but completed successfully!). I can read the files on this drive, so I haven't lost data per se. Once decrypt was done, I ran repair_packages from terminal on 2010 MBP on the mounted (broken boot) disk - it found some errors and repaired them. fsk_hfs also completed fine with green lights.\nThe last attempt at El Cap install completed successfully (tried whilst writing this), and it restarted - white screen, with the no entry symbol. The strange thing was that I didn't get the 'traditional' pop up with the 4 choices when trying to install ElCap, just went straight into install.\nWondering whether there was a setting saved somewhere, have now reset NVRAM and SMC again, and trying install. The pop-up menu has now appeared, and am trying again.\nHas anyone got any suggestions, as I'm running low. I'm starting to wonder as to whether I've got a hardware problem.\nLatest attempt has also failed - 'An error occurred while updating system extension information'.\nEdit: So have now successfully installed another copy of ElCap connected via an external drive from my 2010 MBP. It booted fine. I then put the hard disk into the 2012 MBP, and...nothing. So I hooked it externally from the 2012 machine, and it booted. Put my old hard disk (that started the problems) into the external hard disk cradle, and the 2012 machine booted. So I guess it's a hardware issue. AppleCare ran out 6 months ago :(\nEdit2: Just to confirm, it was the cable that was the problem. New one fixed the issue.\n\nA: Further to @Allan's advice and @klanomath's help, the fix for the issue was to replace the Hard Disk cable.\n\nA: MBP early 2011 model w/ SSD, Mavericks OS.\nAllowing shutdown due to out of battery power, I had this twice, with different fixes: \n\n\n*\n\n*SSD was trashed, un-recoverable. Replaced SSD, restored my backup. Back to normal. I fixed it myself; re: iFixit.com repair manifesto\n\n*Booting from backup would not complete startup (or appeared not to). Cause: Bad video card. My local repair guy said Apple knows this era MBP has defective video cards.  \n\n\n*\n\n*P.S. Turns out the SSD in this case was OK but now I have a more capacious SSD. \n\n*P.S. The repair guy surmised this in about 30 seconds simply by watching the screen as the machine started; the problem is so relatively common.\n\n\n", "Q: iTunes backup also WhatsApp chats? a friend of mine has an iPhone 3GS and is swtiching to an iPhone 4S.\nNow, she's tried to backup all her WhatsApp chats using the WhatsApp backup, but it gets stuck.

I'd like to automatically turn off all access to the Internet (through Wi-Fi & Mobile Data) on my iPhone when locking it. I don't really like to get notifications from different apps when the iPhone is locked.\nHowever, I do want to get all these notifications when I'm around and playing with it—so, basically, when I unlock my iPhone, I want to turn access to the Internet back on again.\nCan this be done?  If so, what's the easiest way to do it?\n\nA: Unfortunately there's no such feature in the current version of iOS (9.3), but there are some tricks you can still do now to achieve almost what you're asking for.\n\nOn iOS 9\nIn this version of the Apple's OS you can keep open the settings app in the background, keeping it open in the Cellular Data section so you can easily open the app and turn Off or On your Cellular Data before you Lock or after you unlock your iPhone.\n\nOn iOS 10\nBeta coming on July. Official release coming this Fall. You may also think about updating your iPhone to iOS 10 when it comes out this Fall (or even to the Beta which is coming this July, but may not be very stable), in fact on iOS 10, (if you have an iPhone 6s) you can use the 3D Touch on the Settings app to get straight to the Cellular Data's section.\nIf you have an iPhone 6 or previous and no iPhone 6s, some coders have found out in the iOS 10 code a 6th toggle at the Top of the Control Center, and it's green. This means either it's for Battery settings or for Cellular Data ones (as they're the only green toggles in Settings).\nSo we may have a Wi-Fi and a Cellular Data toggle at the Top of the Control Center in iOS 10, and this may help you solve your problem as the only thing you'd have to do is simply switching them Off or On via the Control Center without even opening the Settings app.\n\nEven if you do update to iOS 10, or not, you can still solve your problem by keeping open the Cellular Data's section in the Settings App, as that won't cost you that much of battery life.\n\nOther methods\nIn the end, as some have already pointed out, if you don't mind about Cellular Data turned on, but you care just about not receiving the 'vibration' when a notification appears, but still want to see notifications on your lock screen, this can be done on the Control Center pressing the moon button.\nDoing so you just activated the Do not disturb mode. Although you won't receive upcoming calls this way, in Settings you can specify wether to allow calls from your favorites, everybody or nobody, or even if you want to get notified about repeated calls - as Apple specifies:\n\nWhen enabled, a second call from the same person within three minutes\nwill not be silenced.\n\nFor further informations about this mode, and how you can customize (and even schedule!), you may want to check out Apple's dedicated Support Webpage for it.\nHope this helped you out.\n\nA: Seems to me the answer would be to turn on Do Not Disturb. This keeps internet on but prevents notifications from appearing while the screen is locked, but when you go to the lock screen they'll appear there, and you'll get notifications while using the phone.\nIf you want to be able to get phone calls while in Do Not Disturb, this can be modified in Settings > Do Not Disturb.\nAn alternative is to turn on Airplane Mode from control center before you put your phone down, which does turn off Internet, but it's not a great solution for you.\n\nA: As others have said, not automatically on an un-jail broken iPhone.\nIf you really want to turn off wifi and cell, you can swipe up from the bottom of the screen and select airplane mode before locking. But turning off wifi and cell will also prevent incoming calls and messages!\nIf it is just the notifications bothering you, go to Settings, Notifications and de-select 'Show on lock screen' for the ones that bother you when your 'phone is locked.\n", "Q: Can the 12-inch macbook charge from USB-A? While it's nice to have a laptop that can charge over a standard cable, USB-C is not yet ubiquitous. USB-A is: you can be sure that whatever hotel room or office you visit, you will find a place to plug in your USB-A charging cable.\nIf I buy a USB-A to USB-C cable, will it allow me to charge my 12 inch macbook (however slowly)? Is it safe to try?\n\nA: Can a Macbook charge it's batteries from a USB-A charger (car or wall) or battery pack?\nIt depends, but yes, it should work.  The charging performance may vary from it charges very slowly to not at all.\n\"Type A\" is the connector type; it has nothing to do with how much power is being delivered.  What you need is a power adapter that is compliant to USB 3.1 specifications.  It just so happens that to connect it to your MacBook, you need a \"Type C\" connector.\nWould I recommend you doing this?  Absolutely not. \nImportant Note:  Plugging into a power source that is significantly lower than what is required by your device can and will damage your equipment.\n\nWhy?\nFirst, we need to know what the power requirements are to power the Macbook; per Apple, it requires a 29W USB-C Power Adapter (see below). \n\nGenerally speaking, the USB Type A adapters most people are familiar with are those that charge their iDevices.  These are based on USB 2.0 at best and according to the specifications, they are limited to 5V 1.5A.  \n\nThat means, those chargers are limited to 7.5W. (Watts = Volts * Amps) 7.5W  is nowhere enough to power your Macbook.\n\n\nIf you notice in the above USB 3.0 pin out diagram, there is only 1 5V (VCC) pin (this is important in understanding USB 3.1 further down).\nThe USB 3.1 is the specification that says it will support up to 20V at 5A.  Using the same equation from above we get a specification that is capable of handling up to 100W so there's enough power \"bandwidth\" to charge your Macbook.  But that's using a special communications protocol over a USB-C cable.\n20V * 5A = 100W\nHowever, the basic spec is still the same, 5V but now at 3A and there are two 5 volt pins as opposed to only one for USB 3.0 and earlier.  This means combined you can get 10V.\n\nIf you notice in this pin out diagram there are two 5V pins (Vbus).  These are combined to make 10V.  \nNote: There are some USB 3.1 Type A adapters out in the wild, but they are so few and far between I wasn't able to find a schematic for the pinouts.  I am using Type C since these are the most common. \nSo using our trusty equation again,\n(2x 5V) * 3A = 10V * 3A = 30W \n30W is within spec of charging your Macbook.\nBut what about the cable?  Plugging in a USB 3.1 (A to C) into a non-USB 3.1 power adapter will not fix the problem.  The adapter is only providing 5 volts on one pin, not on two that's required to get the appropriate amount of current.\n\nA: My MacBook Pro charges with a Belkin Mixit USB- C to USB-A cable and an Apple 10W USB power adapter that came with my old iPad. \nI also tested the same cable with the iPhone usb charger but it didn't charge. It was however, able to keep the power level even indicating a power stalemate which is a half a win. \n\nA: I believe you might be able to do this..  My only evidence for that statement is from this USB-A to USB-C cable on Amazon and the associated product reviews.  \nDozens of users state that they use it, albeit very slowly, to charge their MacBooks. However, one user, who has the very first review and is rated as 'most helpful' provides technical details as to why you shouldn't use it this way because it could damage the MacBook.  Even Apple, here states:\n\nUSB hubs and other USB devices that supply power won't charge your MacBook. Use the supplied 29W USB-C Power Adapter and USB-C Charge Cable to charge your MacBook.\n\n", "Q: I can't access my user on MacBook Pro eventhough I typed the correct password I turned on my MacBook Pro, typed my user  password, but it restarts instead of logging in. Now I'm stuck with the guest user and don't have a clue about what to do to access my user with all the files and everything I had saved. Someone please help me!\n\nA: By coincidence I am writing a blog post about this. I am assuming that you know the password, but the machine doesn't log into your account properly. \nThe basics:\n\n\n*\n\n*We assume your user folder and its contents are OK.\n\n*We will delete the USER (System Preferences/Users & Groups) but leave the user FOLDER untouched. When you are asked what to do with the Home folder you say \"Don't Change the Home Folder.\" This leaves all of your stuff in place, in the Users folder.\n\n*Now you create a \"new\" user with the EXACT same name as the old one. There are three things to get right: the \"Full Name,\" the \"Account Name,\" and the Password. The full name is probably your own name. The account name is usually something shorter, no spaces. You know the password. \n\n\nWhen you create a new user with the same full name, account name, and password as the old one, the system will ask you whether you want to use the existing folder or not. You DO. \nAfter that, you should be able to log in normally. Let me know.\nYou may have to create a temporary user (with admin privileges) to give yourself a place to work from. You could make a user called \"admin\" with the password \"admin\" and then log into that, and from there \"delete\" (temporarily) your user. Just remember: leave the Home folder unchanged.

I keep getting an annoying request to enter my iTunes password, and I have never even tried to order anything from iTunes Do I need two different passwords for my iPad (first and/or second generations)? Are they two separate password protected accounts: one for my login to a device and a second one for iTunes? I keep getting an annoying popup to sign in to iTunes. I don't have or ever bought anything from iTunes. I tried to put a new pswd.in for iTunes and it changed my login Apple ID instead.\nThis pop-up comes up on the Ipad -1 constantly (every 60 seconds) and doesn't on my Apple 2 iPad with the on same Apple ID and password. \n\nA: You don't necessarily need two passwords/accounts. Here is how it works:\nYou have an iCloud account, and an iTunes account. Both are accessed using your AppleID account credentials, but they are separate services. So account changes made in one service (like change of password) will be applied to the core AppleID account, and by extension the account used to log in to all other related Apple services. Most people use the same AppleID account credentials for both services, but you can use two separate accounts if you prefer (I do this for managed business devices).\niCloud accounts are generally only used to backup data and configurations (Activation Lock and Find My iPhone are also features of iCloud). You typically never get prompted for this password unless you are using a service or App that explicitly wants access to your iCloud (usually to perform or access backups). The iCloud account credentials can be set at Settings/iCloud.\niTunes Store accounts are used to purchase, download and update Apps. Depending on your settings, Apps may try to update themselves in the background, and this may require you to verify with your iTunes account password (even free Apps). This also occurs with iOS updates, but with a 1st gen device you won't have to worry about that. This is most likely what is happening to you. The credentials for this account can be changed in Settings/Store on 1st generation iPads. You can also disable automatic updates for Apps via the same location. That should stop the prompts. I have no idea what could be trying to update on a 1st gen device, but I am super curious.\nHope this helps. Apple device/account management can be unnecessarily convoluted sometimes. I wish someone would fix that.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Forcing an app to clean itself?

Well, i never used an apple phone in my life, i am really curious why people are  really crazy for apple phones arent they just like the androids?what's so special? \n\nA: You will have to try an iPhone, or read about it, to form your opinion about what is special about it (if you find anything special about it). You'll find that there's about as many different opinions about phones as there are people.\nTo use an analogy, which you should never do, you could ask what is so special about an Audi when it is just a car like a Toyota is a car?\nFor some there's no difference between the two. For others, the difference is monumental.\n", "Q: Import wav files to iPhone using SD card reader I have the below SD card reader that imports photos and videos to iOS photos app. Is it possible to import .wav files onto my iPhone using the Apple lightning port SD card reader?\n\n\nA: No, you can only transfer certain images and videos.  This adapter will not transfer documents or audio files.\nYou could put those audio files on Dropbox or a network drive and then access them with the iPhone.  You should be able to transfer the wav's that way.\n", "Q: Which iOS IPSW file is the right one for my iPhone 5S? I installed iOS 10 beta 1 on my iPhone 5S but now I'd like to go back to the release version of iOS 9.3.2.\nWhen I go to download the IPSW file for iOS 9.3.2 from www.ipsw.me I am presented with two types of IPSW file, one for \"iPhone 5S (Global)\" and one for \"iPhone 5S (GSM)\". \nWhich file should I use? The only other information I can add is that I bought the phone in the UK.\n\nA: As you can see from the ipsw.me website Apple have released two slightly different versions of iOS 9.3.2 for the iPhone 5S. By looking at Apple's developer website I can see that one version is for iPhone models A1453, and A1533 and that the other is for models A1457, A1518, A1528, and A1530. \nUnfortunately the ipsw.me website does not directly identify which IPSW is which, but by selecting each of them in turn we can see their file names. These file names contain the hardware string for the kind of iPhone they should be installed on.\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 5S (GSM): iPhone6,1_9.3.2_13F69_Restore.ipsw\n\n*iPhone 5S (global): iPhone6,2_9.3.2_13F69_Restore.ipsw\n\n\nAccording to this website:\n\n\n*\n\n*Models A1453, A1533 = iPhone6,1\n\n*Models A1457, A1518, A1528, A1530 = iPhone6,2\n\n\nYou'll find your iPhone's model number on the back of the case (it will start with \"A1\"). \n\n\n*\n\n*A1453, A1533 and you need the (GSM) IPSW from www.ipsw.me\n\n*A1457, A1518, A1528, A1530 and you need the (global) IPSW from www.ipsw.me\n\n", "Q: Will my 14.5V USB-C charger destroy my 9.7 inch iPad Pro? The charger is the one for the MacBook (29W) and the iPad is the 9.7 inch Pro. Can they be used together without damaging the iPad battery?\n\nA: This should be absolutely fine. I haven't tried it myself (yet) but Apple themselves state that you can use the 29W adaptor with the 12.9\" iPad Pro, and other people have verified that it works (and doesn't cause damage). \nThis all came out before the 9.7\" iPad Pro was released, and it doesn't look like Apple have updated the product page for their USB-C to Lightning cable, but I'm certain it will be fine. I've charged many an iPhone with an iPad charger without cause for complaint. \nThe device should only draw as much power as it needs/is safe. \nSources\nTesting Apple’s 29W USB-C Power Adapter and iPad Pro Fast Charging – MacStories\nhttps://www.macstories.net/ios/testing-apples-29w-usb-c-power-adapter-and-ipad-pro-fast-charging/\nUSB-C to Lightning Cable (1 m) - Apple\nhttp://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0X2AM/A/usb-c-to-lightning-cable-1-m\n", "Q: iPhone 6s camera replacement I dropped my iPhone and shattered the external lens. The internal one was scratched, too.\nI got the parts online and followed the iFixit guide to open up my iPhone and replace the camera. Now when I to the Camera app I only capture the top pixels.  The photos come out like the image below.  Do you think I got a defective camera unit or am I missing something?\n\n\nA: Here's what I would do, in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the iPhone\n\n*Open the iPhone up, disconnect the camera, and reconnect it\n\n*Clean the contacts on the logic board with isopropyl alcohol (with the battery disconnected, of course)\n\n*Return the camera and get a new one from a different source\n\n\nAlso, I don't know from where you ordered the camera, but if you have to return it and get a new one, don't just buy the cheapest thing you see. Try to find a seller from your country that cares enough to post real photos of the camera instead of those stock photos and buy one from them.\nIf the next one still doesn't work, you could try one more from another seller, but if it still doesn't work, then it's the almost certainly the iPhone at fault and about the only thing to do would be get another one if you want the camera fixed.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) shuts down when not attached to Thunderbolt Display Maybe somebody else is having this same issue? I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) running OS X El Capitan. For some reason, anytime I unplug the laptop from the Thunderbolt Display, it will shut down. I need to hit the power button for it to come back to life. It shuts down pretty quickly most of the time, although I've seen it stay alive for 5-10 minutes at the most.\nI'm in the System Profiler looking at the battery info and it reports everything is cool.

The projectors will be about 50 feet apart. Is there a way to have the iPad show up on the 2 projectors?\n\nA: As other commenters have already said, it doesn't seem to be possible to AirPlay a display to two targets at once. \nOption 1)\nThe best solution I can think of would be to run something like AirServer on a Mac or PC. Attach the computer to both projectors and have it mirror the display. AirServer will make the computer a valid AirPlay target and you'll be able to mirror your iPad's display to it (and thus see it on both projectors simultaneously). \nOption 2)\nYou could also buy an HDMI splitter and two long HDMI cables. That way you could AirPlay your iPad's screen to an Apple TV and have the Apple TV output to both projectors simultaneously. \nOption 3)\nI believe it's also possible to connect some projectors to a network (eg: via Ethernet or Wi-Fi), so perhaps you could look into that? You may be able to create an AirPlay endpoint on your network (perhaps with a tool like the aforementioned AirServer) and then direct its output to your network-connected projectors. \nOption 4)\nYou could browse the App Store for an app which streams camera input from an iOS device to the network. You could essentially turn the iPad into a streaming HTTP server and then have any number of devices tune into it. Then you could attach an iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, computer (or anything, really) to each projector and have them stream from the source iPad (eg: By visiting the URL for the source iPad's stream in a web browser like Safari or a video player like VLC). This has the advantage of not requiring any long cables, although you'd need a solid Wi-Fi connection. \n", "Q: I want to save my photos from iPad OS9.3.2 to PC Windows I am planning on giving my iPad to son.

I have an iPhone 5S and I am looking for a way to mirror my screen to the TV. I was wondering if I could use the hotspot on the phone to connect my PC (on the TV) and the iPhone, to airplay to the PC, which mirrors to the TV. Thank you!\n\nA: Yes.\nThough info on the topic seems somewhat sparse, a few threads like this and this seem to indicate that using a hotspot works as a viable Wi-Fi network for AirPlay (as long as, of course, you connect both the iPhone and the computer to the hotspot.) However, if you've already got a Wi-Fi network, you'd probably be better off using that instead of a hotspot.\nSince your PC doesn't support AirPlay off the bat, you'd need some sort of software like AirServer to make it a valid AirPlay device. From there, simply connect it to your TV and AirPlay from your phone to the PC.\nHowever, if you do have an Apple TV, a feature called Peer-to-Peer AirPlay is available that will let you AirPlay from your iPhone to your Apple TV without a formal Wi-Fi network, circumventing the need to create a hotspot. Just turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on both devices and it should work. Note, however, that AirServer doesn't support this, so you would need an Apple TV.\n", "Q: Change security question without calling apple I just submitted a gift card on my apple id and wanted to purchase an app. After pressing buy it asked me to enter my security questions because it's my first time and I have forgot them.

You will loose all data stored on the phone itself though, so make sure you have a backup (or, if you store your data in the cloud, the login/password data for all your online accounts).\n", "Q: What is the format of a .xip file As Xcode 8 beta is available to download, I see it's distributed with a .xip extension, Xcode_8_beta.xip.\nWhat is the .xip format? What's the difference between previous .dmg format?\n\nA: The .xip file format contains an archive (xar containing a gzip archive and metadata) and a signature of the archive.\nTo decode an .xip file, use the following commands:\npkgutil --check-signature <xip-file>\nxar -xf <xip-file>\ntar -zxvf <xar-file>\n\nSee the following links where developers discuss this format and its implications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sparkle issue #821 - Add xip support for signed, compressed, application updates\n\n*“End-of-central-directory signature not found.” when installing Xcode 8 beta xip file\n\n*TheUnarchiver source code: \"Kludge support for XIP files to XAR parser\"\nNot for Public Use\nApple has since removed xip from public use. The format has been reserved for Apple's exclusive use in the future, see TN2206:\n\nImportant: Starting with macOS Sierra, only XIP archives signed by Apple will be expanded. Developers who have been using XIP archives will need to move to using signed installer packages or disk images.\n\n\nA: To my knowledge xip is a xar derivative using gzip compression, with a toc header xml containing checksum, timestamp, certificates, user id/name, creation/modification/access date&time etc.\n\nA: According to the xip manual page:\n\nA XIP file is an analog to zip(1), but allows for a digital signature to be applied and verified on the receiving system, before the archive is expanded. When a XIP file is opened (by double-clicking), Archive Utility will automatically expand it (but only if the digital signature is intact).\n\nEssentially, an .xip file is just a .zip with a signature to verify that the file has not changed since its creator saved it. This protects from both damage from a disk error and from a third-party tampering with the file.\n\nA: The Unarchiver and command line (xar, tar) utilities didn't work for me on MacOS 10.12.6.  What did work was right clicking on the .xip file and select \"Archive Utility\", it was able to expand the .xip file successfully.\n\n\nA: For future reference, the shell command\nxip --expand /path/to/Xcode_x.y.xip\n\nalso works, and extracts Xcode into the shell's current directory, so cd /Applications (or wherever) first.\nI'd also strongly recommend removing or or renaming any existing copies of Xcode.app (or Xcode-beta.app) from the target location before using this command†.\nAs far as I know, this has worked as long as Apple has been distributing Xcode in .xip format, and it worked just now on 10.15.6 to expand Xcode_11.7.xip downloaded from Apple's developer site.\n† While I haven't personally tested overwriting with xip, if similar command-line tools are any indication, it could potentially leave a mess if used to overwrite an existing directory with the same name, leaving behind existing files that don't exist in the archive being extracted, or worse.\n", "Q: iPhone 4/5 SIM sizes I have an iPhone 4 and I'm borrowing an old iPhone 5s from a family member. I understand that they have two different types/sizes of SIM cards but would I simply ask my carrier (Verizon) to send me a smaller one or would it be more complicated?\n\nA: The solution to your problem is, either you get it from service provider or cut it by yourself to nano sim size (as stated by other user). You might know that iPhone 4S uses micro sim whereas iPhone 5S uses a nano sim, so to use it with iPhone 4S again after cutting it, all you need is a micro to nano sim adapter which is available online for few bucks. This way you can use it on both devices.\n\nA: I see two options here – both I have done myself, but maybe things are different here with German operators. So while I don't know if those options would actually work with Verzon, I would still like to recommend them to you:\n1) On a similar occasion I asked for a smaller card directly at a service point of my operator. They were able to \"transfer\" my number from one card to the other basically in front of my eyes. That was very practical, since I didn't have to go through the deactivation/activation process via their service hotline – which can be difficult if the mobile phone is the only phone around. \n2) A couple months later I took a special offer: my operator was offering a second card for a one time fee. So I had that second larger/older card sent by post and activated it through their web interface. Now I can basically switch between two devices whenever I want – I just have to login to the web administration interface and point out which card / which device should take incoming calls.\n", "Q: Applescript - Open password protected excel file Is there a way for Applescript to open an Excel workbook (.xls) that is password protected?\nI see that in the library there are functions to check if a workbook has password, but I do not know the proper syntax for opening a wb with password protection.\nTell application \"Microsoft Excel\"\n  -- set theWb to path of .... etc.\n  open theWb with password \"abc\" ? <--- what should go here?\nend tell\n\n\nA: There is a way to open a Excel workbook (xlsx, in my example) which is protected either the workbook and/or the sheet.

Make sure your phone number in particular isn't listed anywhere under the Apple ID that is currently in use on the old phone (you'll need to check this through apple.com to see the full detail, you won't see everything through the phone itself).\nI had this happen re-using a phone from my wife, she started seeing my messages on some devices. Turns out I was using an Apple ID that had ended up with both her and my phone numbers listed under it. If you erased the phone but still had your SIM in it, your number could have ended up included in any new Apple ID created on the phone.\n", "Q: Do cell carries have access to FaceTime information? On the newest iPhone, do cell phone carriers have access to FaceTime call data (such as which caller initiated and ended a FaceTime call)?\n\nA: FaceTime only needs Internet connection for audio and video calls therefore the only data your carrier receives is what server you connected to, which I don't think is what you are looking for. You are the only one having access to the FaceTime logs.\n", "Q: Trackpad going crazy A few days ago, I don't know what happened, possibly nothing but my 13\" MacBook Pro trackpad started acting weird. Did I spill water? Food? Shook it? Pressured it? Any of these might have happened, but nothing out of the ordinary that caught my attention.\nSo, the trackpad started moving around randomly by itself; sometimes clicking around. It was dangerous so I disabled the trackpad from here: \nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac restart  \n\n*SMC reset  \n\n*PRAM reset   \n\n*Fontnuke  \n\n*Clearing some settings and caches\n\n*Messing with the preferences\n\n\nNothing worked to fix it. Even my mouse (Logitech G500) was messed up, the left button is not clicking and movement kind of clunky. \nInterestingly when I login with my guest user account, my mouse works fine until I start using the trackpad. After using trackpad my mouse gets messed up again.\nAlso after I disable the trackpad while mouse is was connected and after that operation I restart my Mac and do a NVRAM reset, my mouse works perfectly fine. As long as I don't disconnect my mouse accidently and do something on the trackpad. \nAfter 2 days my trackpad still has issues but it is not as crazy as it used to be. Now, it doesn't run around randomly clicking around, but I cannot control it properly either. Trying to make a shape with the trackpad is very difficult because it starts jumping around. It's also still messing with my mouse, but this time instead of the left button it started messing up the right button of the mouse. Why?\nIt seems like this is a software problem and how can I fix it?\n\nA: It's probably moisture.  \nI experiencing something similar after being caught in the rain with my MacBook Pro.  Working outside because the weather was nice, I got caught in a slight drizzle of rain.  I immediately shut the lid and ran inside.  \nIt didn't get wet enough to cause damage, but somehow wet enough to mess with the clicking function of the trackpad; it would sometimes \"lock\" in the clicked position, not register clicks, or click erratically.\nWhat I did was put my MacBook Pro in a Zip-Loc bag with several desiccant (silica gel) packets and leave it overnight.  \n\nIn the mid-morning, I took it out of the Zip-Loc and the trackpad was working again.  \nI save these packets in a jar; they come in the packaging of products I buy.  I will throw some in my camera bag where I keep my lenses and I will put a few in my briefcase where I keep my laptop.  \nIf you save them, they're free, but they are also extremely inexpensive on Amazon or eBay if you don't have any available and are in dire need.\n\nA: Update: After a week it kind of got fixed by itself. Its working fine now, I don't know the reason.\n\nA: Don't Worry you can fix it in just few minutes by following these steps.\nMostly this problem is caused by humidity.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your macbook.\n\n*Bring your macbook in Sunlight and leave it there for about 20 minutes.\n\n*Turn on your macbook and enjoy.\n\n\nIf there is no sunlight in your country you can use the hair dryer(1 minute only) for this purpose. Warning ! you must dry only your trackpad using hair dryer. \n\nA: I was on the phone with Apple and they had me clean my tracking pad with a dust free cloth and water.  Boom it was  fixed immediately. \n", "Q: screenshots storage place back to desktop impossible I previously changed the settings of which folder to save screenshots.

I have read what to do, in Terminal enter:defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Desktop/ then killall SystemUIServer.\nHowever, even after restarting the laptop, when I make a screenshot or a partial screenshot, I hear the sound of the shot but it doesn't appear on my desktop (or anywhere else).  How can I get the screenshots to appear in the default folder?\n\nA: The problem is that the command:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Desktop/\n\nwill set the default location for screenshots to be /Desktop/. What you actually want is to set it to be /Users/yourusername/Desktop/.\nTry this, replacing yourusername with the username for your account:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/yourusername/Desktop/\n\n\nA: If you want it back to the default setting, then in a Terminal run the following commands:\ndefaults delete com.apple.screencapture location\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\nThe default location is the User's Desktop and does not require the location key to be set in the com.apple.screencapture.plist file, hence the location key is just deleted as it only exists when the default has been modified.\nThen for the change to take effect, killall SystemUIServer does that.\nNote: When a User Account is first created the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist file does not exist and is only created if one modifies the default settings for screen captures.  As an example, changing the storage location of the screen shots, whether or not you want the drop shadow included and or the file type.\nAs an example I use the default location and file type but do not want the drop shadow, so the output of my com.apple.screencapture.plist file is:\n$ defaults read com.apple.screencapture\n{\n    \"disable-shadow\" = 1;\n}\n\nIf you do not have any setting changes other then the storage location and you want to truly revert to the default, then just delete the .plist file.\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\nThese command can be combined on the command line by separating them with a semi-colon ;.\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist ; killall SystemUIServer\n\n\nA: Open the plist file in Xcode and remove the location key entirely. This can also be accomplished in Terminal with the command\ndefaults delete com.apple.screencapture location; killall SystemUIServer\nAlternatively, you can just trash the plist file and make any needed modifications again.\n", "Q: DNS resolution got extremly slow after issuing ipconfig commands I wanted to inspect DHCP messages.

For about a year now I've been using the Photos app my MacBook Pro (OS X El Capitan 10.11.5). Before Photos, I used iPhoto for a couple of years. I only started using Photos once it shipped with newer OS X installations.\nI'm out of space and, looking at my disk usage, I see that iPhoto is consuming almost 80 while Photos is consuming 15 gigs. The Optimize Mac Storage setting is enabled in Photos. That could mean it is only downloading 15 gigs worth of media, and that would explain the usage difference between iPhoto and Photos. It could also be that not all photos from iPhoto have made it to the cloud. Is that likely? I think all media should be imported entirely once I installed Photos, but I don't want to risk it.\nCan I safely remove iPhoto from my computer or its library at least?\n\n\nA: I was just on the phone with Apple tier-two support, and I asked the same question. \nThe agent's response was yes, both the iPhoto app and the iPhoto library can be safely deleted, if you're confident you've migrated all media to the newer Photos app. \nI've done so, and I've seen no trouble on my Mac nor iPhone. \n", "Q: iPhone Email client includes wrong Original Message in body of reply I'm using an iPhone 6, running iOS 9.2.1.

So I have recently switched to Mac from Windows and I like to have the dock always visible when I'm using programs (probably because I'm used to the Start button toolbar in Windows). I don't use the green full screen button, I just double click the title bar to make the window cover everything. \nUnfortunately, this does not work in Chrome. Seems like the default shape of the Chrome window is set to be a square and when I double click on the title bar, it expands into a square, leaving space on the sides. I have to manually drag the left and right side to cover the screen.\nIs there any way to change this?\nEDIT: Option + Maximise does not work. It still leaves space on the sides.\n\nA: Hold the Option key at the same time you click on the Maximize button on Chrome.  This will maximize the window while leaving visible the menu bar and dock.  This will also work on any other window on a Mac.\nIf this doesn't maximize the window on the first try, drag the window to where you want it (like you're doing now with the left and right sides) and then close the browser.

I deleted the bootcamp partition with the partition manager in the Debian Installer and created two new partitions, rootfs and swap. I had my hard drive previously partitioned as listed below:\n\n\n*\n\n*disk0s1: EFI (where GRUB is currently installed. I'll say more about this later)\n\n*disk0s2: OS X\n\n*disk0s3: Recovery HD\n\n*disk0s4: Windows 8.1 installed with Bootcamp Assistant, I deleted it later to install Debian.\nMy current partition layout:\n\n\n*\n\n*disk0s1: Same as before, but with Grub installed at: (mount point)/EFI/debian/grubx64.efi\n\n*disk0s2: Same as before\n\n*disk0s3: Same as before\n\n*disk0s4: ext4 partition with Debian /\n\n*disk0s5: swap partition for Debian\nI was able to get GRUB installed (I don't remember exactly what I did and I tried to reproduce it but did not succeed which is why I'm asking here). \nIt was working until I cleared NVRAM (don't ask why I cleared NVRAM, it was a very stupid action of me). Before I cleared nvram, I got the GRUB menu when I booted without holding Alt, but when I booted when holding Alt and chose the Debian main partition, it would say \"Missing Operating System\", same for choosing it from the Startup Disk prefrence, or setting it manually with bless (because GRUB is installed on the EFI partition, not the Debian root partition. Please correct me if I'm wrong). \nSo I presume that before I cleared NVRAM without holding Alt the system tried to boot from EFI, now it's trying to boot OS X from disk0s2 (there are no set variables that relate to the OS X root, so I guess the system automatically boots the first bootable HFS partition if there are no variables about booting). (To clarify, my problem is that the only way to boot Debian was to boot Grub, and the only way to boot Grub was if it was default startup disk when the system started, Grub can't be booted from the boot menu displayed when booting while holding Alt, and when I performed the stupid action of resetting NVRAM, the default startup disk went back to the OS X partition.) \nSo how do I change the startup disk back to EFI/Grub (disk0s1/efi/debian/grubx64.efi)?\n\nA: I'm posting the solution that worked for me in case of anyone else that has this problem comes across this. I changed the path of the grub EFI executable from /efi/debian/grubx64.efi to /efi/boot/bootx64.efi. Now it is appearing as a boot device in the boot selector, but it still wasn't booting by default. So to make grub boot by default I ran the following command (from Linux, not OS X): efibootmgr -d /dev/DRIVE -p PARTITION NUMBER -c -L \"Grub\" -l /efi/boot/bootx64.efi, where \"DRIVE\" is my internal hard drive, with GRUB, OS X and Debian installed, and \"PARTITION NUMBER\" is the EFI partition ID, so for me it would be efibootmgr -d /dev/sda -p 1 -c -L \"Grub\" -l /efi/boot/bootx64.efi\n", "Q: Is there any way to recover a deleted Notes.app note that was deleted from the \"Recently Deleted\" folder?

Programs executing at this layer are called tasks.\nOn top of the Mach-kernel is the BSD subsystem. Programs executing at this layer are called processes. The applications you run and know on OS X (such as for example tmux or Terminal.app) use the BSD subsystem, so when running they become processes.\nWhen a running program (a process or task) needs to communicate with another process/task over a Mach port it will go through the so called bootstrap task. This very low-level task is responsible for looking up requests for Mach port, and essentially direct the information to the right place.\nmacOS / OS X is essentially a multi-user system. Multiple users can be logged in at the same time, and each can be running multiple processes. They are generally not allowed to interact with each other, except when explicitly allowed.\nIn addition to user processes, the system will at boot (and sometimes later) run background programs called daemons. They are not associated with a specific user login, and keep running when users log out.\nThe previously mentioned Mach bootstrap task groups all tasks into either the \"startup context\" for daemon programs, or the \"user login context\". There's one of the latter for each currently logged in user.\nIn essence when programs look up Mach ports to communicate over, they can only see ports in their current context. When you start a normal program, it is started in your user's login context - and thus you can communicate with other programs you have started.\nThe tmux process however uses the function call daemon() to \"daemonize\" - i.e. keep running in the background. This also has the effect of moving the tmux process from the user's login context to the startup context.\nNow programs such as \"open\" will no longer work, because they function by looking up the WindowServer's Mach port for the currently logged in user, and sends it commands to do their job. The lookup will fail, as tmux is now in the wrong bootstrap context.\nThe reattach-to-user-namespace program fixes this problem by using an uofficial way of interacting with the launchd process (which is responsible for managing daemon processes) - to get launchd to tell it which context is the user's login context.\nThen it uses the Mach system call task_set_bootstrap_port() so that further port looks from the tmux processes (and its child processes) will hit the user's login context bootstrap task.\nAs to why it is not working for you: Have you remembered to kill and restart your tmux server after installation? (do this by running \"tmux kill-server)\nAlso you could try running the reattach-to-user-namespace command manually from Terminal.app to see if you really have got it installed and it runs properly.\n", "Q: Fastest way to disable daemons gone wild; how to know if attempts to interrupt will break app? As software advances so do the installers, which have become vehicles for all kinds of needless bloat ware.  I do not believe this to be an inevitably, its possible for software to progress without demanding more space and resources—directly, or indirectly, through the numerous \"Helper\" apps they propagate.  \nEven the dæmons (background processes) built into the operating system are way too numerous, attempting connections countless times each hour for menial tasks like checking data and time (which only changes twice a year!) by querying what appears like a small list of domains, but which resolve to hundreds of ip addresses.  Many of them suspicious.\nThis is but one example.  Anyone who has installed Creative Cloud knows that even if you never launch an app, there are about a dozen background apps each with their own daemons doing god knows what.\nI have a subscription to Creative Cloud, that isn't the issue.\nI want to know the safest way to prevent some of them (the resource-hoggers) from opening, to help my system run smoother.\nIn the past I've simply replaced one of the unimportant binaries with one of my own, renamed as the original, so that when Adobe forces it to load, it does something innocuous like clear my RAM.  This usually works until it's time to update.\nIs there a way to know which daemons can be changed without a negative outcome?  Or to install software with an app like Pacifist to customise which daemons get left out?\nI just want my Mac to run smoother, and the daemons in question cannot be quit once open, and deletion usually corrupts the app— replacing is the only way I've found to circumvent the hogging of resources.\n\nA: Moscarda, friend:\nThese are good points, each, and I agree with your conclusion that the list of system daemons or services which are running after the operating system installation is rather excessive.  \nBetween performance and ease-of-operation I readily prefer performance.  Thus, I tend to reduce to bare minimum the list of services which are allowed to run.  I also expect that if something fails to work auto-magically, that I probably need to launch a particular system service which got disabled as a consequence of my preference for performance over ease-of-operation.\nApple has made disabling services rather elegant via launchd in the more recent versions of its operating system.  To a system administrator's dismay, however, Apple continues to allow the historic, deprecated means of launching services and therefore some third-party software still uses the likes of SystemStarter.  SystemStarter is a direct descendant of historic BSD rc (resource control) and System V init processes.  While being more modern than the historic UNIX parents it descends from, SystemStarter is still a far cry from the more evolved functionality and elegance of launchd. \nMy procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preserve a copy of the original state of configuration by making a backup of relevant files.  \n mkdir /private/var/archive ; tar -czvf /private/var/archive/SERVICES_$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S').tar.gz /System/Library/StartupItems /System/Library/LaunchDaemons /System/Library/LaunchAgents /Library/StartupItems /Library/LaunchDaemons /Library/LaunchAgents ~/Library/StartupItems ~/Library/LaunchDaemons ~/Library/LaunchAgents \n\n\n*Inspect what still relies on the deprecated StartupItems and disable anything relevant by removing its items from the ( ~/ | /Library/ | /System/Library/ ) StartupItems folder.\nPlease remember this: These paths ~/, /Library/, /System/Library/ are listed in order of their importance and therefore sensitivity to potential errors that might affect the ability of your machine to boot properly or behave normally.

Now Boot Camp would not install to the HDD in the second bay, and the recommended steps from Apple was to disconnect the SSD temporarily, install Windows and then plug it back in. Worked like a charm.\nIssue is not that I cannot boot into Windows. When I try to boot, I am greeted with a black screen and a blinking cursor, and that's it. Left it for a good 5 minutes and it didn't budge.\nI am assuming it is because the boot loader on the primary SSD needs to have the information to boot into Windows, but since it had to be disconnected to install Windows on the second HDD this was obviously missed.\nI have tried the common solution of booting into the Windows install usb, repair windows and running some boot.exe commands to try and repair but alas it does not fix the issue.\nAny suggestions? Is it even possible to have macOS and Windows on two completely separate HDD/SSDs and still boot them in parallel?\n\nA: You have not begun to given enough information to correctly diagnose your problem. This answer this therefore is based on many assumptions.\nI know Windows 10 can be installed using the EFI boot method on the newer Mac computers. I do not know if this includes your model. Although, if your Mac does support booting Windows via EFI, then, I believe you should not of had any problems booting.\nI have read from some Apple web sites where Windows can be installed on a second hard disk by temporally replacing the first disk with the second disk. If such instances, Apple referred to the computer as a Mac Pro. Your computer is a MacBook Pro. Mac Pro computers are designed to support a second internal HDD or SSD. Your computer probably was not. \nFor the rest of this answer, I will assume you tried to install Windows to boot using the BIOS method. It would seem that if you are intent on keeping OS X and Windows on separate internal drives, then the answer would be to install Windows on the first drive and OS X on the second drive.\nAnother option, if the BIOS boot method is to be employed, would be to boot Windows from the first drive while keeping most of the Window on the second drive. To do this, you would have to create a small NTFS formatted \"System Reserved\" partition on the first drive. This partition can be as small as 100 MB, but 500 MB is the recommended size. This partition would also have to be marked as the active. This would also mean the first drive would be using a hybrid EFI/MBR partitioning scheme. The second drive would use the legacy MBR partition scheme. Once the \"System Reserved\" partition is in place on the first drive, you can simply boot the Windows installer from the USB flash drive and install Windows 10 to the second drive. The installer will automatically know which files need to be placed in the \"System Reserved\" partition. \nIf you answer questions about setting up a \"System Reserved\" partition, let me know.\n", "Q: MacBook display screen Is it possible to fix a MacBook Pro display glass for a cracked one of a MacBook unibody?

This causes non-adult websites to fail to load.  For example, edx.org works for a while then inexplicably, Safari/Chrome can't access it.  The same happens with nytimes.com.  ping and traceroute to these sites eventually fail also.\nWhy?\n\nA: It's not a perfect system because there's no way for any filter to know exactly what the content of a site is or whether it's an \"adult\" site or not.  This is from Apple's site explaining the filtering:\n\nWhen \"Allow unrestricted access to websites\" is selected, the Internet content filter logs websites that the account visits but does not restrict Web browsing. Visited websites are still logged and can be examined in the Logs tab of Parental Controls preferences.\nWhen \"Try to limit access to adult websites automatically\" is selected, the Internet content filter does its best to block websites with inappropriate content. To do this, the Internet content filter uses the same technology that the Mail application uses to identify \"junk\" mail. The Internet content filter can identify, with a high degree of accuracy, whether a Web page is safe or not by examining various properties of the website including text and structure.\n  Additionally, the Internet content filter will block a website if the website identifies itself as adult-oriented using RTA (http://www.rtalabel.org/) or SafeSurf (http://www.safesurf.com/ssplan.htm) rating systems, as well as forcing \"safe\" searches with some search engines.\nIn this mode, the Internet content filter logs all visited and blocked websites, and flags them as such in the Logs tab of Parental Controls preferences.\n  In certain situations, the automatic Internet content filter may mistakenly block a safe website or allow an adult-oriented website. For example, if the website uses an uncommon language or if there is very little text on the page. These websites can be identified in the Log tab of the Parental Controls preference pane and added to the \"Always Allow\" or the \"Never Allow\" lists. These lists can also be accessed by clicking the Customize… button in the Content tab of Parental Controls preferences. Websites that are mistakenly blocked can also be allowed by clicking the \"Allow…\" button on the blocked web page and authenticating as an administrator user.\n\nSo there's no way you're going to be able to do perfect filtering.\n", "Q: If I remove my SIM card from my iPhone, will iMessage still be connected to my phone number, or can I only be reached by my Apple ID email?

I have a late 2014 Mac Mini, with the i7 option, 3 Ghz turbo boosting to 3.5 Ghz according to Apple. To give the system some work to do I am running a ray trace:\n$ time povray --benchmark +WT1\n\nThis should max out one core with some intense floating point calculation. But when I check as it runs:\n$ sysctl hw.cpufrequency\nhw.cpufrequency: 3000000000\n\nWhy isn't Turbo Boost kicking in? The machine is otherwise idle apart from the Safari window in which I am typing this now, this is the scenario as I understand it that Turbo Boost was designed for?\nJust for interest, this machine completes this benchmark in 13m25s and our iMac 3.2Ghz i5 completes in 12m58s - I'm not seeing that paying the premium for i7 was worth it :-(\nUpdate: Well having done some more research, I am getting some boost, according to the Intel Power Gadget:\n\nBut I still can't match a 3.2 Ghz i5.\n\nA: When you run the command sysctl hw.cpufrequency you are getting a constant that was given to the OS at startup.    If you want to get the CPU frequency \"on-the-fly\" you will need to poll the CPU.  That's what the Intel Power Gadget is doing.\nAs for why you are not seeing a performance increase with your specific application, it could be from any number of factors including whether or not the application is optimized to work on this particular architecture.   \nDisclaimer:  Personally, I don't know much about ray tracing software, but from the little bit that I did read up on. I don't see why the calculations for the creation of the trace wouldn't be done on the GPU and not offloaded from the CPU.  This makes me wonder if this is not what's happening here\nMy suggestion here is to use something that is consistent across all platforms like Geekbench\nFinally, Intel has this disclaimer about the Turbo Boost technology...\n\nand...\n\nSo, as you stated it appears that your CPU is \"boosting\" but as to why it's not getting up to the full 3.5 could depend on any/all of these factors that Intel noted.\n", "Q: Expand OS X partition I am using a Mac (OS X 10.10.3) that has a Windows and an OS X partition.

This can also be done with dd and fdisk. Both methods require an external drive.\n\nA very non-conventional method exists to expand Macintosh HD by using the internal Logical Volume Manager (CoreStorage).\nYour main volume is already part of a CS Logical Volume Group – probably because it's encrypted. This can be seen by checking the partition type of disk0s2: 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC.\nAfter adding a partition in the unallocated disk space, formatting it as JFHS+ volume and adding it as physical volume, you may expand the logical volume Macintosh HD into the free space of the now enlarged logical volume group.\nThe method outlined below was tested in a VM and it works. Since I can't install Windows with the Boot Camp Assistant in a VM I can't assure that Windows is bootable afterwards. If Windows booting fails you can use fdisk to modify the pMBR to make it bootable again.\nPreparation: \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your data.\n\n*Detach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive).\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup.\nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Mavericks or Yosemite). If you boot to a full system you have to prepend sudo using some commands (e.g. gpt or newfs_hfs)\nVerify and repair the disk and the volumes with Disk Utility\nModify CoreStorage stack:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open in the menubar Utilities/Terminal\nFirst you should get an overview of your disks and the partition layout:\n\n*Enter diskutil list, diskutil cs list and gpt -r show /dev/disk0\n\n*Unmount the disk containing the logical volume Macintosh HD and you main disk. Below I assume the logical volume (residing in disk0s2) has the disk identifier disk2 – check your diskutil listing for the proper identifier and use that one below.\ndiskutil umountDisk disk2\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0\n\n\n*Add a partition in the unallocated disk space:\ngpt add -b 325078016 -i 5 -s 165156696 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\n\n*Format the new partition:\nnewfs_hfs -v \"Expansion\" -J /dev/rdisk0s5\n\n\n*Add the partition to the logical volume group.

If I get an Apple Music subscription, can I still keep the songs in my iTunes library without moving them to the cloud? I ask because I understand that Apple Music will swap your songs for the closest thing in its library. I'm fine with this, except that I have a lot of classical music and I prefer the specific recordings and interpretations that I've been collecting for years. Will I still have immediate access to these tracks? Also, if Apple Music doesn't have the song I'm looking for, can I still use iTunes to download it? Thank you.\n\nA: You can keep your iTunes music.  A subscription to Apple Music just provides you access to most of the music found in Apple's iTunes music store.  It will not replace any of the songs that are found in your library.  It is important to note that all of my songs were downloaded from the store itself.\nIf you are worried about your songs being deleted or overwritten, I would suggest that you back them up to an external HD or another folder on your computer.  Then if they are overwritten you can always get them back.\nOne thing to note though is that on all computers/iPhones/etc. besides the one you initially subscribed to Apple Music, any music downloaded as part of the subscription will come from Apple Music. In most cases this will be the same track as the one on the original computer, but if Apple's matching algorithm gets it wrong, you might get another version of the same track (e.g. live vs studio recording, or original releases vs. \"best of\" sampler).\n", "Q: How to erase DVD-RW in Disk Utility I have a MacBook Pro Mid 2012 with built-in SuperDrive. MacBook Pro is running OS X 10.11. I am trying to erase a DVD-RW disc that is filled with some images. But the erase option is greyed out:\n\n\nNote that I do can select a disk image and press Burn \"Disk Image.dmg\" to disc and erase the disc and write new things to it. But creating a disk image is very slow in my case and I would just like it to simply erase my rewritable DVD disc. Is there a way to use Disk Utility or a 3rd party app to erase my disc? Thanks.\n\nA: Go into Finder and right click on the DVD, there should be an option \"Erase rewritable disk\". Apparently that's how to erase disks in El Capitan.\n\nA: For anyone running High Sierra (10.13) or a similar version where a rewritable CD or DVD can't be erased from Finder because MacOS can't read it\n\nuse the the terminal instead:\ndrutil -drive 1 erase full\n\nSee the manual for the full usage (man drutil) and ensure drive 1 is the particular drive you want if you have multiple. \nThis can happen, for example, if you have burned a live Linux image that must be bootable.\n", "Q: Processor or RAM? I want to buy a macbook pro in the near future, but choosing the configuration has been a headache for me so far.

That's the reason i want to change my current laptop since its slow for editing photos and maybe sometimes playing some games. If you can help me decide i would really appreciate it. \nThanks\n\nA: (Note: This may be a bit opinionated due to the nature of this question, and I'll mostly focus on photo editing.)\nFrom what I have seen, (at least on Photoshop) RAM and SSDs are the most important. There have been people who have run on i5s and get by just as well. \nIf you can avoid it, don't get the Non-Retina (i.e. get the Retina) especially because you are doing photo editing and it always helps to have a higher resolution while editing so that higher resolution pictures can be used. Also, the drive is not a SSD so it will run slower.\nI would recommend getting the first option as you have said:\n\nMac[B]ook Pro 13\" Retina 2.9GHz Dual-core Intel Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz 16GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM 128GB PCIe-based Flash Storage\n\nsimply because of the following reasons (as opposed to the second option that has the i7):\n\n\n*\n\n*The clock speeds are roughly the same (0.2GHz w/o Turbo Boost, 0.1GHz with)\n\n*Having multiple threads (all i7s have hyperthreading which doubles the amount of threads) only helps in certain tasks.\n\n*The two above reasons (in my opinion) do not justify adding USD$200 to the price, while the 16GB of RAM will help, even though it is USD$80 more than the first option.\nFor gaming: get the second option. More threads will improve gaming performance and all i7s have hyper-threading. The i7 also has a faster clock speed.\nAnd if it is possible, you may want to just get the faster CPU and the larger RAM, since you want to both game and photo edit.\n", "Q: Which is original MacBook Pro 15\" Charger i have MacbookPro with retina display, model A1398\nMacBook Pro \"Core i7\" 2.3 15\" Retina 2012   2.3 GHz Core i7 (I7-3615QM)\n\nI have to buy a new charger and I'm not sure which to buy (EU - Bosnia)? :/\nOn the Internet I found that the original chargers manufactured by a Delta Electronics. \n\nA friend has Air -Mid2012.

I said not to pay and I went online, logged into the iCloud account that was attached to the iPad, and removed the Lost status so she could unlock it again.\nHowever, the iPad is still in Lost mode because it can't connect to WiFi (to receive the 'unlost' command from iCloud) and to connect it needs to be unlocked.\nThere is an option to enter a passcode but the old passcode didn't work.\nAny ideas on how I can recover it? Wiping is an option since there isn't much on it anyway.\n\nA: You can always restore an iPad that’s locked if you have possession of the device and the iCloud account. Also, connecting it over USB to iTunes will often allow you to get it unlocked promptly and on High Sierra - the Mac can share it’s network connection to iOS devices over USB so you don’t even need WiFi on the iPad for it to connect back to the internet and receive an update from iCloud/Apple for the unlock commands that are pending delivery.\n\nA: Unfortunately, even if this was connected up to a computer and opened in iTunes, it would still require you to unlock the device in order to \"trust the device\". \nIt stinks, but I think you've already alluded to the remaining option here: Use iTunes to \"restore\" the iPad.

I want to record a short video of the app I'm developing.\nI'm using QuickTime and iPhone connected via lightning cable.\n\nThe moment I rotate my phone the recording stops.\nIs it possible to record such a video?\n\nPossible workaround: record my whole screen while preview of the iPhone is on.\n\nA: The reason this happens is because a video cannot change orientation mid-record.\n\nIE: My wife starts many of her video recordings on her phone in a\nvertical position. I remind her that we will likely have a terrible\nexperience watching that video at a future date from a television\nbecause of the huge black bars on the left and right.

You could record your whole screen like you alluded to, but if you want a more controled/correct size, you would do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Pretend like you're going to do a new iPhone recording. Have the phone on the screen. Take note of where the phone is on the screen in portrait mode, as well as landscape mode.\n\n*Use sticky notes on your monitor to create a \"square\" that will make sure your phone is completely visible during landscape as well as portrait.

My MBP is running out of storage and I want to start learning video editing where all everything is to be done through external HDD, no SSD involved. Possible? Thanks! \n\nA: The short answer is yes.\nHowever, I would definitely suggest using at minimum, a USB 3 drive, but for best performance you will want a Thunderbolt drive.\nTo give you an idea of what the performance metrics of different interfaces are, I've compiled a quick summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*SATA III (Internal Hard Drive) - 6Gpbs\n\n*USB 3.0 - 5Gbps\n\n*USB 2.0 - 480Mbps (or 0.48Gbps)\n\n*Thunderbolt - 10Gbps\n\n\nSo, while you can use pretty much any external drive, how well it performs is completely dependent on what architecture you use to connect it.

I use a MacBook to access the data.\nMy problem is that my MacBook isn't always \"fully\" connected to my Time Capsule. \nSo what do I mean by fully connected? When I use Finder to access some file in the Time Capsule there is a considerable lag at first. So it is obvious that my computer is connecting or starting up the Time Capsule to browse its library of files.\nWhy is this a problem? I could live with the small lag, but the problem is that every time another drive is activated my Crashplan software search through all my drives to backup files. I really don't want this action activated this way.\n\nA: Your Time Capsule has that \"lag\" because the drives spin down (goes to sleep) if there has been no activity for a certain amount of time.\nThis is also the reason that it gets disconnected after a certain amount of time.  The drives go to sleep for two reasons:  one, it's to save power; there's no point in spinning drives that aren't being used, and two it's to maximize the life of the drive.  \nI wouldn't recommend this method for sharing and/or storing files as the TC was meant for backups.  If you need storage for your files I would definitely recommend a NAS like the Synology or an external Thunderbolt drive.  I personally use the Synology with my Mac and have no problems whatsoever.\n\"Hack\" to Keep the Drives Spinning\nSince the drives spin down when there is no activity for a given amount of time, a quick and easy hack would be to access the drive for some minor operation to create activity.    A simple bash script would work perfectly:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Script to create activity on time capsule to prevent drives going to sleep\n# It creates an empty text file named tempfile.txt then removes it\n\ntouch /Volumes/<Time Capsule Volume Name/tempfile.txt\nrm /Volumes/<Time Capsule Volume Name/tempfile.txt\n\nexit\n\nSave that bash script as keepalive.sh or something that makes sense to you in a easily accessible location like a \"Scripts\" subdirectory in your Documents folder.  Make sure it has the \"executable\" attribute by issuing the command chmod +x keepalive.sh.\nNow, using crontab you can easily set this script to run every X mins, hours, days, etc.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open crontab for editing by issuing the command crontab -e\n\n*add the following line to your crontab file:\n*/15 * * * *   /bin/bash        /Users/<username>/Documents/Scripts/keepalive.sh\n\n*The time is set for every 15 minutes.  If the lag is still present, you will need to adjust that value to something smaller.  Just use crontab -e to edit.\nNOTE:  most likely your \"editor\" environment variable defaults to vi (default).  It's not difficult to use, but it's definitely not intuitive for new users.  Use nano instead by invoking the crontab editor with this command (pay attention to case):\nenv EDITOR=nano crontab -e\n\nYou will then be able to use Ctrl\"Key\" combinations (i.e. Ctrl\"S\" for \"Save\").  The commands will be at the bottom of the screen.\n\nA: You could add the folder for Time Capsule to the startup items and it will attempt to mount each time you log in. You would then want to consider if you want to reconfigure CrashPlan to not backup the Time Capsule Volume. Really two separate tasks, but that would be the game plan.\nFor the automatic part - search the Mac Finder help menu for the string \"Open items automatically when you log in\" and it has step by step instructions.\nYou can surely have actual files stored on a Time Capsule drive and if they only are stored there, you will want Crash Plan to back them up. It's flexible to use the way you wish to set things up. \n", "Q: Secondary Click: Click but not tap with two fingers On my Macbook Pro, I prefer the secondary click to be \"Click with two fingers\", but the closest option that exists in the Trackpad Preferences is \"Click or tap with two fingers\".\nIs there any way for me to keep the behaviour that \"click with two fingers\" is secondary click, but make it so that \"tap with two fingers\" does nothing?\n\nA: If you choose for clicking to be the only option (meaning, deselect the \"tap to click\" option underneath the \nsecondary click\" option), you should be allowed to only click with two fingers for the secondary click. That is one very simple, straight-forward way of solving your issue. \n\n", "Q: Add more suggestions in iOS predictive when typing By default, iOS predictive provides three suggestions on iPhone: how can I increase this number?\n  \n\nA: Most keyboards only show three suggestions as you type, no matter how relevant they are to the current conversation.

I have an older Macbook Pro (8,2 - Late 2011).  It doesn't have a usb 3.0 port, only USB 2.0 ports. I have an Elgato Thunderbolt 2 Dock with a WD External HD, USB 3.0.\nI was expecting to see USB 3.0 type speeds, but only get transfer rates around 35MB/s, which looks like USB 2.0.  \nCan a MacBook Pro that only has USB 2.0 ports realize USB 3.0 transfer rates when connected to a Thunderbolt Dock that has USB 3.0 ports and an external usb 3.0 hard drive?\n\nA: The device you're mentioning, the Elgato Thunderbolt 2 Dock, provides USB 3.0 ports. As commented by someone else, Thunderbolt is a PCIe extension and thus is not limited by the USB 2.0 bus of your laptop. As such, it is possible for USB 3.0 to be something that is offered by a dock like what you mention.\nUSB is a feature offered (typically) by the Intel chipset and tends to be driven these days off of one of the PCIe lines from the CPU. Your computer tends to have a controller that translates the PCIe line to a USB interface (in the CPU's supporting Intel chipset) and would support only the specification that it came with. For example, a MacPro3,1 (2008) uses an Intel chipset that supports USB 2.0 devices.\nAn easy upgrade for those machines is to install a PCI Express card to gain support for USB 3.0 similar to what you'd do with the Thunderbolt dock, i.e. a USB 3.0 controller that sits on the PCIe bus. Of course, any devices on the PCIe bus needs to be recognized by the operating system and thus requires drivers. However, drivers for some USB controllers (e.g. the FL1100) are supported by macOS / OSX 10.8+ and will just work.\nOf course, the USB connector does slightly differ between 3.0 and previous specs; the 3.0 connector has a few extra pins that are key to the higher speeds.\n\nA: Yes.  Install the Elgato Utility Software and after a reboot you should see USB 3 speeds.  \n", "Q: How to share files with an iPad app in El Capitan itunes? I have this iPad app called AVPlayer. I used to plug-in the iPad and copy files to the app using iTunes. However, this doesn't seem to work in the newest version of iTunes. There used to be a feature called \"file sharing\" that allowed to do that, but it seems to be gone now? I can still navigate to the \"apps\" panel, but AVPlayer doesn't show up there, in fact there is no app that would allow sending files to it, and no such option at all.\nSo the question is: how to send files to an iPad app via a usb cable?\n\nA: It should still be there on the Apps panel, though it's more confusingly-located than I seem to remember it used to be. You have to scroll right down past the Apps section where you can add/remove/arrange apps, and you'll eventually get to a File Sharing section with a list of apps that support file sharing.\n\nIf you found your way there but the list is empty, then something else is afoot... if nothing else, you should see the iWork apps there, if you have those installed.\n", "Q: iCloud storage reporting backups that do not exists I disabled iCloud backups on all my devices, but the storage report still claims I have 2gb of backups stored. I've gone into the iCloud preferences and double checked that no backups exists. How can I remove free up the used space?\nI should mention that my iPhone reports only 174.4KB of Documents & Data in \"Manage Storage\".\n\nA: If you have two iOS devices, I would compare the Settings - iCloud - Storage - Manage Storage screens to ensure both agree. One device can get stale or cached data. If you don't have two, restart your device to check that it's updated.\nIf so, you will then want to go to iCloud.com on a computer and verify the number there. The web app allows you to clean or observe the rest of the backups. They are deleted photo albums (potentially) as well as backups of calendar, contacts, files and bookmarks.\nIF at that point, you still think there's something missing - you'll want to escalate to Apple Support to http://apple.com/support/icloud\n\nA: My best suggestion is to check for apps like WhatsApp. It can backup data but will not show in iCloud. If that does not apply, I would call Apple Care and ask them to release the extra storage. \n", "Q: How accurate is share my location With a cell tower in sight about a 3/4 of a mile away how accurate is the share my location if the phone is in a Walmart \n\nA: It's going to vary, of course, but one way to get an approximation is to pull up the Maps app.\nThis article from Apple Support says the following about this...\n\n\"Apps that can show your location on the screen, including Maps, show your current (approximate) location using a blue marker. If your location can't be determined precisely, you'll see a blue circle around the marker. The size of the circle shows how precisely your location can be determined—the smaller the circle, the greater the precision.\"\n\nThis article may be of assistance, too: http://n8henrie.com/2014/09/how-accurate-is-the-iphone-gps/\n", "Q: Error code -36 - cp: Input/output error - mac While I'm coping the file from the External hard drive to my MacBook Pro I'm getting Error code -36. Some recommended for dot_clean option, also I've tried and facing the same issue. Even I've tried to copy through the Terminal and also getting IO error. Desperately need to copy my stuff from my external drive. \n\nA: In a Terminal:\ngrep \"I/O error\" /var/log/system.log\n\nThis will output to the Terminal all lines in the system.log file that has I/O error in it. Output such as kernel[0]: disk0s2: I/O errors are indicative of a falling and or damaged HDD. Note disk0s2 is an example and depending on which disk and partition has bad sectors the disk number and slice number will be different then the example. If you have output such as this and aren't backed up then do it before doing anything else!\nNote; Depending on when the last time you had an error copying something it may not be in the current system.log file and you'll ether need to check the archived system logs or grep directly after the copy error.\nIf the copy is failing just on a particular file, you can attempt a recovery using ddrescue on the target file to try and copy it. ddrescue is a third-party utility that will need to be installed however dd is a part of OS X and it too can be used, although ddrescue offers more control and options then dd does.\n", "Q: Should I have my Mac on until \"external\" hard drive encryption process is done? I have a MBP 2012 and replaced the internal hard drive with an SSD and the SuperDrive with a 1TB HDD. I'm encrypting my 1TB HDD. \nShould I leave my Mac on until it's done? \nDoes OS X pause the encryption process if I turn my Mac off (or put to sleep) or does it start over every time I turn it back on?\nI'm running El Capitan 10.11.5.\n\nA: Not necessarily. \nOS X seems to handle well pausing and restarting where the encrypting process left off. \nHowever, there is no way I can recommend doing this. I had backups of my data and decided to try it. :) I just wish there was more official information regarding this process. \n", "Q: How to export multiple images from Photos on my disk? I imported lots of images in the Photos app.\nHow can I export the selected ones on my disk?

Is there a setting where I can delete my emails in this account freely in Mail without deleting them at all from the gmail?\n\nA: You can check Mailbox Behaviors in your Gmail account setting (under Accounts) and check Store deleted messages on the server. This will make your messages still available in other clients even if you delete them in the Mac where you have this setting.\nReference: Mail (El Capitan): Mailbox Behaviors preferences\n", "Q: OSX 10.6 admin account missing After a power shortage a Mac with El Capitan installed, downgraded to 10.6 and the admin account is missing.\nThe main session password is also in an older state, and we cannot connect anymore.\nWe have tried to suppress the /var/db/.AppleSetupDone and go through the account creation process but without success.\nDoes anyone have any way to retrieve an admin account?\n\nA: Try restarting and then press Command+S. This will boot the computer in single user mode. After everything loaded, type in ( /sbin/ mount -uw /)first, then (rm /var/db/ .applesetupdone), and finally (shutdown -h now )or (reboot). This erases the previous setup and makes the mac think its brand new.

The issue seems to be Finder. I tried leaving it to shut down by itself overnight to no avail. \nOn occasion I get this message: The screenshot below is Dutch but says something along the lines of: \n\nYour Mac was not shut down because Finder could not be stopped. Please quit ?Finder to continue. \n\n\nThings I've tried\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried shutting it down with a hard reset (power button and a shutdown command from terminal) and restarting. \n\n*I've tried disk repair in recovery mode, \n\n*I've tried resetting NVRAM.\n\n*I've tried shutting down Finder with the usual suspects: Force Quit, killall Finder. \n\n\nThis last one does something, but definitely not what I expect:  \n \nIt looks like Finder has quit, it's no longer in the list activity monitor. Relaunching it with terminal command open . in the user home folder gives the error: \n\nLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -600...\n\nDon't know how to fix it anymore. Any advice?\n\nA: My issue turned out to be in an outdated Wacom driver. After removing it, Mac worked fine. I guess formatting would have sorted it out too. \n\nA: To re-run Finder, try:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.Finder\nlaunchctl start com.apple.Finder\n\nThen try to run it as: open -a Finder.\nFor further troubleshooting, you can run the app in the foreground and check for any errors:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder\n\nConsider also checking the logs via log stream command. Also, disconnect any external drives to be sure (e.g. diskutil umount force /Volumes/MyDrive).\nIf you suspect any damaged files, it's good to rsync above files from another working macOS or try to reinstall.\n\nA: I wasn't able to use finder to shut down or restart my macbook air after upgrading to El Capitan until I did a hard shut down and restarted in safe mode (hold down the shift key when restarting).  Logged in as usual, then used finder to restart.  Everything is working as it should now.  \n\nA: In order to properly quit finder, you need to open Activity Monitor. Once you’re in the app, select \"Finder\". Find the \"x\" at the top, and select \"Quit\" or \"Force Quit\".\nAlso wrote this from an earlier question today.\n", "Q: Where is \"mkpasswd\" for OSX? There is a well-known unix utility called mkpasswd available on many *nix systems.\nI was just trying to use it from terminal on an OSX 10.10.5 Yosemite (Early 2015) machine, and it is nowhere to be found.\nHow can I install it on this machine? or is there an alternative already available?\n\nA: I made a tool for creating mkpasswd -m sha-512 (Linux/Ubuntu) style hashes on OS X (or any platform).\nFirst, we need to acquire a single requirement...\npip3 install passlib\n\nNow we create mkpasswd_sha-512.py (or whatever you want to call it)...\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\n# based on https://stackoverflow.com/a/17992126/117471\n\nimport sys\nfrom getpass import getpass\nfrom passlib.hash import sha512_crypt\n\npasswd = input() if not sys.stdin.isatty() else getpass()\nprint(sha512_crypt.hash(passwd))\n\nIt only handles a single use case of mkpasswd but if it fits, enjoy.\nNote: There is a slightly more complicated version at https://gist.github.com/RichardBronosky/58f1b34d2bcf4c4e5f1cd18a88fdc37d which simplifies tuning the CPU Cost, but passlib manages that periodically for you so it's fine to keep it simple like this.\n\nA: There's a Mac implementation of mkpasswd on GitHub - https://github.com/PrototypeAlex/mkpasswd\nAlternatively, Keychain Access has a built-in GUI password generator\nFile menu > New Password Item... > [click the key icon]\ndrop-menu artificially offset for visibility\n\nI also found this Apple Discussion on how to achieve it natively, though it's unfortunately above my skill-level, so I'll let you see if you think it might be suitable.\n\nA: Coming from the docker world, on your Mac/Windows/Linux box (with docker installed):\ndocker run -it --rm alpine mkpasswd -m des helloworld\n\nReplace your mkpasswd arguments as needed.\n\nA: Here's the source code for mkpasswd. It's an expect script. You would have to modify the script (at least the shebang) in order for it to work. There are other command line tools such as openssl (md5), jot and dd that can generate passwords.\n\nA: I successfully installed mkpasswd on my macOS Catalina (10.15.2) using sudo gem install mkpasswd \n\nA: Here is a simple mkpasswd utility written in golang for platform portability.\nmkpasswd -h\n\nUsage of mkpasswd:\n  -hash string\n        Optional hash argument: sha512, sha256, md5 or apr1 (default \"sha512\")\n  -password string\n        Optional password argument\n  -rounds int\n        Optional number of rounds\n  -salt string\n        Optional salt argument without prefix\n\n\nA: If you actually want the original mkpasswd utility, just install expect using Homebrew:\nbrew install expect\nHowever, the original mkpasswd does not include the capability to hash a password using SHA-512 mentioned elsewhere on this page.\nAnother way to get that is to install the Perl CPAN distributions App::bmkpasswd (providing bmkpasswd) and Crypt::Passwd::XS (providing SHA support).\nYou can then run:\nbmkpasswd --method='sha512' <password>\non the command line to hash a password (specified in place of <password>) using SHA-512.\n\nA: I successfully installed mkpasswd on my macOS 10.14.5 using gem install mkpasswd.\ngem install mkpasswd\nFetching mkpasswd-0.1.0.gem\nFetching unix-crypt-1.3.0.gem\nSuccessfully installed unix-crypt-1.3.0\nSuccessfully installed mkpasswd-0.1.0\nParsing documentation for unix-crypt-1.3.0\nInstalling ri documentation for unix-crypt-1.3.0\nParsing documentation for mkpasswd-0.1.0\nInstalling ri documentation for mkpasswd-0.1.0\nDone installing documentation for unix-crypt, mkpasswd after 0 seconds\n2 gems installed\n\nHere is where I get this information.\n", "Q: iTunes charges when it's advertised as free Why does it advertise free for 3D tour of ancient Jewish temple then when I try to install the app it asks for credit card details\n\nA: Verifying your credit card does not mean you are being charged.\nIf there is a change in your billing info, you have to verify it once on each device that uses that AppleID in order to continue downloading from iTunes.

It's taking forever though. Could there be some kind of setting I have to change or some other problem?\n\nA: If you want it right now, why not plug the phone into the Mac & use Image Capture, in the Applications folder - which is the importer 'behind' Photos.app.\nYou can also set it to auto-launch any capable app, including itself, when a device is connected [or do nothing] & set exactly where your imports should be saved.

We're using TestFlight with external testers to beta-test our app. In the guidelines to TestFlight it states that If you already have the live app installed on your device, the beta version of the app will replace the live version., but what about the other way around?\nWe uploaded a build to TestFlight a week ago, and started the beta-testing. Today, we released the same build on AppStore, and now - TestFlight says that we don't have any builds in beta, both on iTunesConnect and in the app. Did TestFlight 'understand' that we released the same version, and removed it from testing? Or did something else happen here..? I am not sure if this happened last time we did this.\nWhat happens to the testers version of the app? It still has the orange beta-dot next to its name, will it update itself to indicate that it's the 'live' version? After all, it is the same build. Or will it 'expire' in 60 days? The real problem is that our beta-testers may be confused if it suddenly says that the app has expired, with no additional information in the TestFlight-app, and they have to install the live AppStore-version manually.\n\nA: The user can 'update' to the newest version on the App Store to remove the 60 days 'trial' for your beta version. \nTestFlight checks your build version that is marked as test version and the live version on the App Store.

Can it cause damage to the aluminum or any other thing on the machine?\n(there was a spot that I couldn't get out without a bit of water..)\nUpdate:   I forgot to mention that after I dried the \"wet\" spot with a dry cloth I reinstalled my Speck SeeThru case.  Was it a mistake that I didn't wait to let the moisture dry for a couple of minutes?\n\nA: It is perfectly fine to use a moist cloth to clean the exterior of your rMBP.  Moist being the operative word.  If your cloth is soaking wet, dripping water, you have too much.\nI have also used cleaners like Endust for Electronics along with a microfiber cloth to clean both the outside as well as the display.  It leaves it looking like new.\nI have, for someone who spilled some sort of cocktail on the laptop and allowed it to dry leaving a stain that wouldn't come off, used Bar Keepers Friend to remove the stain.  I made a paste on the cloth then rubbed it on the area.  The MBP ended up looking like new.\n\nA: Apple employes actually use microfiber cloths in the Apple Stores to clean all of the hardware on display.\nIf you need to use a fluid never use any of the typical household cleaners.  Take a microfiber cloth and place it in a clean small bowl and pour in a small amount of distilled water, never use tap water, and allow it to absorb into the cloth.  Once absorbed wring it out throughly so it is only dampened and no dripping distilled water.  Wipe and or rub as gently as possible using only the force necessary to remove the dirt.\nFollow up with a dry microfiber cloth.\nIf you need a cleaning agent use a 50/50 mix of distilled water and pharmaceutical grade isopropyl alcohol which you can get from the drugstore.\n", "Q: Whats in an icloud backup I have an old icloud backup and I'd like to see whats in it.

Is everything on my phone backed up (assuming I have all the toggles on)?\n\nA: Provided that you have made a backup of the data you want to keep via iTunes or iCloud it is safe to restore your phone from an old backup and later restore it to its present state from the backup you had made.\nI would suggest using iTunes just because it seems more convenient to me and so as to you would feel safer about your data- an iTunes backup holds all the information necessary to restore your phone to its state at a set point in time.\n", "Q: OS X how to disable Command P Shortcut I would like to disable Command P shortcuts or change it to something i would not accidentally hit\nBut i do not see options in Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts\nRegards\n\nA: Keyboard shortcuts such as the \"Print Document\" shortcut are baked into each application, so unfortunately it isn't something that is system-wide and can be disabled in one place. \nHere's an excerpt from Apple's Keyboard Shortcut page:\n\nTo learn more shortcuts, check the menus of the app you're using.\n  Every app can have its own shortcuts, and shortcuts that work in one\n  app may not work in another.\n\nHowever there is still a workaround to get shortcuts from working, and that would be by using another application that binds shortcuts.

Our developers are all on Windows but need access to the Mac VMs for cross-platform development, particularly viewing the iOS Simulator. \nHow do you set up a vanilla Mac OS X install to enable remoting into it with Windows Remote Desktop Connection?\n\nA: It's your virtualization software that provides the RDP server, not OS X itself.\nI don't know what you are using specifically, so I will frame my answer using VirtualBox as the example.  However, the principle is basically the same.\nOn my FreeBSD VM that I have running on my iMac (10.11.5), I have the option to turn on Remote Display as well as configure which port it connects to as well as how I authenticate to the display server.\n\nIn this case, VirtualBox uses the RDP protocol, so you can have any RDP client, whether it's Windows or OS X or even Linux connect to this particular VM.  \nThere is nothing that I have to do to the OS running in the VM instance to connect.  Infact, the connection will remain persistent across reboots so you can in fact issue a shutdown -r now command and watch it go through the whole process.\n", "Q: How to make CMD+Tab show current window The most ongoing annoying thing about OSX is that I'll switch to an app with CMD+Tab and it only shows the top menu bar.

I can't send or receive from my mac to any other iOS device. If I want to send something to my iPhone, the iPhone never scans and shows up on my mac, and If I want to send something from my iPhone, like a photo, the mac doesn't show up on my iPhone. I have followed a lot of fixes on apple discussions and other websites but non seem to work. I'd be very grateful if anyone would help me.\n\nA: For the record, Airdrop only works if you have one of these Macs, and a supported iOS device:\n\"To send items to an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, or to receive items from those devices, you need a 2012 or later Mac model with OS X Yosemite or later, excluding the Mac Pro (Mid 2012).\"\niOS\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 5 or later\n\n*iPad Pro\n\n*iPad (4th generation) or later\n\n*iPad mini or later\n\n*iPod touch (5th generation) or later\n\n\nOn the iPhone, you need to set Airdrop in Control Center, I recommend 'Everyone' just to be sure. Both wifi and bluetooth need to be on.\n\nA: I don't use AirDrop regularly but I gave it a try.  Here are certain situations where my iPhone did not show up on my Mac.  1.) The phone's screen turned off, 2.) Bluetooth on either Mac or Phone was turned off.  \nThe AirDrop functionality was not impaired or disabled when iCloud was turned off as it does not depend on your login information.  If you set the privacy and discoverability functionality on your Mac to \"No One\" then your iPhone cannot find your Mac; this does not affect sending to your iPhone.  As a test, I suggest you set it to \"Everyone\" and see if your iPhone can find it.  If so, then go to your Mac and check to see if your Mac can see your iPhone.  If so, then you're all set.  Make sure that your phone does not go into standby mode--screen turns off not just dimmed.\nIf all else fails, backup your information to either iCloud or your computer and reset it to factory settings.  If this does not work, I would suggest making an appointment with the Apple Geniuses.\n\nA: When I also signed in and out of my iCloud account from Mac, that didn't work. So I signed out and logged in with another iCloud account. I didn't test it right away but at night I just tried again to see if it works or not, and it did. I logged out of the account and signed in with my old iCloud account (with which airdrop wasn't working) and it worked then too.\n", "Q: I have several memory questions regarding OS X 10.9.5 I have just purchased CS3 and it has been legally transferred to me.

Do I have enough memory to do that too?\nAlso, can I erase photos from iPhoto that I no longer need and will this give me more memory?\nAttached is my memory indication.\n\n\nA: It looks like you're running Mavericks (10.9.5) based on the screenshot you provided. That being said, why would you want to downgrade to Snow Leopard (10.6.x)? Yes, it is probably a touch faster than Mavericks, but it isn't supported anymore and doesn't have the memory compression feature that might help a bit for a memory hungry application like CS3.\nEither way, you have 4GB of RAM which is enough to do basic things on the machine but with CS3 it is probably going to be a potentially sluggish experience if you use it heavily and have more than one application open. I would suggest upgrading your RAM to at least 8GB if you can. What kind of Mac do you have?\n\nA: Bing is your friend...\nAdobe CS3 System Requirements\nSpecifically, regarding the RAM needed:\n\n1GB of RAM for DV; 2GB of RAM for HDV and HD; more RAM recommended\n  when running multiple components\n\nPhotos in iPhoto are stored on your drive, not continually stored in memory.  This is irrelevant.\nYou didn't mention what Mac you have.  This is important in determining if you are able to upgrade or not.\n\nA: I run CS5 on a 9 year old 4GB machine and it works great on 10.10.  By just limiting what else I run, I am able to keep my memory pressure in the green despite also having the current World of Warcraft client up.  Surprisingly, web apps are total pigs - a well used Youtube window in a web browser can gobble over a gig.  \nCS3 is built with lower capacity machines in mind, so I think you'll be fine.   \n", "Q: Alarm application using the maximum possible volume level The iPhone's alarm shares its volume with the ringer, and I don't want the ringer volume to be too loud. I am looking for an alarm application for iPhone using the maximum possible volume level.\nIdeally, it would gradually increase the volume till the maximum possible volume level. If it needs the iOS to be jailbroken, that's fine.\n \n\nA: The Wake Alarm Clock app does exactly what you want. No jailbreak required, progressive increase of volume up to the maximum. But, I'm using it because there is a setting that forces you to shake your phone to stop the alarm, and you are awaken almost instantly.\n\nA: You can use the Safe Alarm 2 application.

I can't seem to be able to see the page break anymore: I need to go to print preview in order to get a sense of where rows and columns are on the page. \nIs there a way to see the page break in the new version?\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple's Numbers has never had page breaks.  Here is a solution created from Yellowbox on the Apple's Community forum: https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-7101.  \nHere is also a answer from Ian, also on Apple's forums--\n\"Numbers has never had Page Breaks.\nIf you are using Numbers '09 it has Show Print View which is useful for arranging (and resizing) objects on pages before you print to paper.\nIf you are using Numbers 3, there is only Menu > Print > Print Preview (Print Setup) which shows the pages, but is not editable.\"\n", "Q: Set PATH variable so that it is detected in all applications, even outside terminal. (El Captain) My ~/etc/path looks as follows: \n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\nThe Problem:\nWhen I type echo $PATH into terminal, I get back: \n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nAnd this persists for every application started in the terminal. For instance, if I type emacs, and then do: \nM-x getenv PATH\n\nMy output is: \n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nHowever, if I start up emacs using launchpad instead of terminal and once again enter M-x getenv PATH, my output is instead /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin.\nAs you can see my change to ~/etc/path, which was the addition of /usr/local/bin, is missing. \nAnother Example:\nI use a Firefox plugin called vimperator which emulates vim functionality in Firefox. It has a feature that allows the user to edit webpage input in vim. However, this does not seem to work on OS X. On a hunch I type the command !echo $PATH into vimperator and see the following: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin. Of course, since the symlink called gvim, which points to macvim, was created and placed into /usr/local/bin by brew, this behavior makes sense. What I don't understand is why the PATH is read the way it is. \nSolutions that I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have obviously restarted my machine. \n\n\nEDIT (As requested by now deleted comment):\nusing sysctl user.cs_path in the terminal brings up:  \nuser.cs_path: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\n\nA: The loginwindow process sets a user's environment. It sets the variables TMPDIR and PATH, consults Directory Services and sets SHELL HOME USER LOGNAME . PATH is set to /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin unless modified by launchd (in the more current versions of OS X). This is the PATH variable available to the user's processes unless modified by that particular process (cron as an example sets the PATH to /bin:/usr/bin).\nTerminal emulator applications start your shell as a login shell thus the PATH is modified by reading the various shell startup file. Any process started by your shell now inherits the new PATH variable. Other applications using a shell do not read any shell config files and use those environment variables available in the current environment. An application may modify the environment by using the LSEnvironment key in their Info.plist.\nAs of Yosemite, you can change the PATH variable in the following form.\nsudo launchctl config user path <path>\n\nin your case you want /usr/local/bin at the front of the path.\nsudo launchctl config user path /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nreboot your system and the new PATH will be set by loginwindow.\n\nA: \n\nRun this:\nlaunchctl setenv PATH \"$PATH\"\n\n\nEDIT: That no longer works. Use this with Bash instead:\nCURRENT=\"$(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Print PATH\" ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist)\"\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set PATH $CURRENT:/your/path/here:/another/path/maybe\" ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist\n\nThen log out and log in again.\nNote: You may want to replace $CURRENT:/your/path/here:/another/path/maybe with just a list of paths like :/your/path/here:/another/path/maybe, but that is a bad idea becase it will erase all paths already stored.\nThis uses User Session Environment Variables.\n", "Q: \"Operation can't be completed because item with name already exists\" error with Paragon NTFS I reinstalled Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 on my 2013 MacBook Pro, today, and I've been having an issue copying files from my NTFS formatted external drive using Paragon NTFS. This issue was not present previously, nor is it present in my iMac.\nWhen I attempt to copy and paste, drag and drop, or move a file or folder from my external drive to a folder on my MacBook, I get the following error (obviously with different file or folder names).\n\nI've tried clearing caches, restarting the computer, and I've tested the drive on the other computer. The drive is formatted NTFS, and I'm using Paragon NTFS to access it fully, which works fine on the other computer.\nIt does, however, work if I use the Terminal and the cp -R command to copy the folder recursively. I really need a proper solution, though, since it wasn't a problem until today.\nIt's driving me insane, so I hope someone is able to help me find a solution.\n\nA: Im running Sierra and have the same issue.  Did some research.  It has something to do with Paragon NTFS.  re-booting etc worked for me and of course I disabled paragon.  Another quicker method worked for me is by re-launching finder have I quit Paragon.  \nIf you have found a better solution pls let me know.

This answer was a flat no because that individual did not have superuser privileges. This is not the case for me because I do in fact have superuser privileges. \nI found another answer here, but that doesn't seem to work on my machine. This answer involves setting the HOSTALIASES environment variable to ~/.hosts, but no addition to the ~/.hosts file ever had any implications in my web browser, which is the goal of me wanting to create a user specific host file.\nNOTE: After reading through a bit of the man pages of bash, the correct environment variable on mac that the second answer needs is HOSTFILE. However, this still didn't affect anything. Thoughts on this?\nEDIT: This is for a single user environment as MrWonderful suggested. However, I would like for the hosts setting of one user to be unaffected but another user.\nThoughts?\n\nA: If you are managing a single-user environment, such as a shared MacBook, you could potentially have each user's .bashrc copy a base hosts file, then append their custom one to the end of it.  For example:\nsudo cp /etc/common_hosts /etc/hosts  \nsudo cat ~/my_hosts >> /etc/hosts\n\nThis would effectively give every user their own custom additions to the hosts file.

This will cause the Virtual Machine to capture\n  the host mouse pointer (only if the mouse pointer integration is not\n  currently supported by the guest OS) and the keyboard, which will make\n  them unavailable to other applications running on your host machine.\n  You can press the host key at any time to uncapture the keyboard and\n  mouse (if it is captured) and return them to normal operation. The\n  currently assigned host key is shown on the status bar at the bottom\n  of the Virtual Machine window, next to the ￼ icon.

I tried running 'Can I Run It' but that doesn't work on Macbook's so I need some help to know if my Macbook can run the game before I purchase it. Thank you.\nSimcity 5 Requirements:\nProcessor: Intel Core i5 or faster\nRam: 4GB\nGraphics Card: NVIDIA GEFORCE GT 650M, 660M, OR 675MX OR FASTER\n-These are just the recommended specs and not the minimum specs so these specs can be lowered.\nMacbook 12\" 2016 Model Specs:\nProcessor: 1.1GHz dual-core Intel Core m3 processor (Turbo Boost up to 2.2GHz) with 4MB L3 cache\nMemory: 8GB of 1866MHz LPDDR3 onboard memory\nGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 515\n\nA: Intel Core i5 is a significantly more powerful processor than Intel Core m3. I can't say for sure that it strictly won't work, but it will likely not be very smooth performance at all, unless perhaps you turn all the settings down to their minimum. I've heard even on MacBook Pro's without dedicated graphics (just intel HD) Simcity 5 performance is poor (lots of stuttering), and to the best of my knowledge the MacBook's graphics are not as strong as MacBook Pro's.\nAll that to say, I would not expect Simcity 5 to work very well on a Macbook at all.\n", "Q: Prevent Wake-on-LAN when other devices wake from sleep or get connected to power TL;DR\nWaking OS X computer A on the network, wakes OS X computer B. Plugging in an iOS device to charge, wakes B too. Prevent this.\nProblem\nI keep my iMac in my bedroom, and just before I'm about to go to sleep I use my MacBook Pro for a while. I also connect my iPhone to the lightning connector to charge it over the night.\nBoth opening the MacBook Pro from sleep, and putting the iPhone to charge, has the incredibly annoying behavior of waking my iMac from sleep mode. So even if I've set the iMac to sleep, if I open the lid on my MacBook or plug in the phone, my iMac wakes, and its loud fans are disturbing. I've set my iMac to sleep automatically after 30 minutes, so I always have to go up and make it go to sleep again.\nWhy does the iMac exhibit this behavior? How do I stop it?\nI think that when an iPhone gets connected to a charger, it wakes the iMac to Wi-fi sync to iTunes. Similarly, it may be that because I have my MacBook connected to a shared iTunes library on my iMac, that might be waking the iMac – but I'm not sure yet.\n\nNote: Disabling Wake for Wi-Fi network access under Settings > Energy Saver does not prevent this behavior, from what I have gathered.\n\nTemporary solution\nIf there is anyone else having this problem, this is the quick-fix solution (SSH/VNC) I am using at the moment. There are VNC apps for iOS, and in OS X there is the native Screen Sharing application or third-party alternatives, or the plain old Terminal for remote control.\n\nA: Under Device Backups, in iTunes 12.4.1 Preferences, there is a checkbox \"Prevent iPods,iPhone & iPads from syncing automatically\".

I just got a new 1TB USB SSD, to use as a backup drive. I need cross-platform compatibility and durability. I've used LUKS+ext4, and it seems both reliable and well-established (i.e. long-term support is likely, which is a must for me).\nUnfortunately, this seems less than convenient on OS X (there's no open-source ext4 driver, as most people know). My current setup is to have a Debian VM on VirtualBox, set up to intercept the external drive at the USB level (VirtualBox can expose USB devices to guest VMs).\nI have this working, and can then SSH into the VM, but it's not the most convenient. If I'm just dumping stuff there via rsync -av -e ssh it's okay, but browsing through files on sshfs is not what I'd call ideal (sshfs is notorious for hanging & refusing to unmount on dropped connections, for example).\nHas anyone else tried something like this?\nRelated: Cross Platform GUI-compatible Encryption (but I don't care about GUIs)\n\nA: I've done the Linux VM solution like yours for years on multiple platforms. But different, and depending on the specific use case, much better. (I've tried your method as well. Too many problems, particularly with USB passthrough.)\nHere's what I do, roughly, using VirtualBox (not a step-by-step guide but should be enough to get you going):\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't attach the external volume via USB intercept; I create a raw VMDK of the external drive first. This requires some script magic: You have to 1) Make sure VM is powered off. 2) Delete the VMDK metadata file. 3) Detach the virtual storage controller dedicated to the USB drive. 4) Create a new raw VMDK file for the USB drive [this part is challenging since the physical location changes; I use a script parameter to pass it in to the script]. 5) Create a new virtual storage controller for the VM. 6) Attach the raw VMDK to the new storage controller. 7) Start the VM. The drawback to this approach of course, is that the USB drive and the VM are tied together for the entire session of the VM. If you unplug the USB drive while the VM is running, it will never be valid again (until you shut the VM down and run the script again). But the benefits are huge: A) It works flawlessly, unlike buggy USB intercept. And B) The performance is near-native [since the host is handling the low-level device I/O], which you can't get with USB intercept.\n\n*I set the VM up with two network adapters: 1) NAT with DHCP for regular internet access from within the VM, and 2) Host-only with static IP for host-to-VM access. You could also just have one bridged adapter, but I've found that this approach is more ideal, as VM internet access is not tied to any one adapter.\n\n*I set the VM up to share folders via SMB. In my case, these are encfs mounted folders.\n\n*I then mount folders on the host, mapped via SMB to the guest.\n\n\nThe performance is pretty decent. SMB over gigabit ethernet between real hardware has a theoretical maximum of something like 120 MB/s (there is a specific number max but that's close enough for this discussion). You probably won't get that high in host-to-vm SMB traffic, even using virtio adapter with no bandwidth limit. On my fastest hardware, I've seen at best around 70 MB/s sustained. But my hardware isn't super fast, you might do better. (Although the USB and spinning disk in your solution will be the limiting factors.)\nI would not bother with sshfs. The overhead is severe and throughput terrible. The only benefit to sshfs is when mounting over an unsecured network. Host-to-vm exists completely within your own computer and is therefore as secure as it gets, you don't need encryption, and the lightest-weight network protocol you can get is ideal. (SMB isn't exactly lightweight but it and virtually all hosts support all the remote file actions you could need.)\nThe solution I've outlined seems complex - and is. But if you document the successful process, it's trivially easy the second time. I have all this scripted in both the host and VM, so it's nearly automagic for every session, and easily set up for new hosts and/or VMs. And it's a very nice and seamless solution for daily use.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Settings for iPhone 5S Text Message comes over as email I have an iPhone 5S and was messing with my settings and cannot figure out what I did.

I cannot figure out how to this work. I have read about concatenating the variable and the do shell script command with & inside AppleScript. But that doesn't really work with a longer script.\n\n\nHere is the short AppleScript to select a file and (hopefully) pass it along to the shell as a variable.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    choose file\n    set myFile to result as text\nend tell\ndo shell script \"/path/to/script.sh\"\n\nAnd then the shell script itself:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile read lines\ndo\n    echo ${lines##*:}\n    grep \"string\" \ndone <$myFile | awk '!x[$0]++' |\\\ntrans -b :en # this is where the second problem occurs\n\nThis is a shortened version of the actual script but I think the intent is clear. I am unsure how to pass the myFile variable FROM Applescript to the shell.\n\n\n*The second problem is that the trans command (which is a rather handy command line translator) uses the gawk command which of course is installed along with the trans program itself. But when run from Applescript I get the error message: \n\n\n\nerror \"/usr/local/bin/trans: line 4990: gawk: command not found\" number 127\n\nI know that AppleScript needs the fullpath in order for this to work. But how do I provide the full path for a command embedded deep within nearly 5000 lines of code? Do I alter the code of the trans program itself to provide the full path to gawk?\nAlso I realize that I could do the whole thing from within the shell and that a lot of this is adding complexity where none is needed. But I think it is still worthwhile to know how to do this. \nThanks for reading.\n\nA: The first problem with the first script is you aren't using the set myFile variable.\nHere's a general guide to getting help:\nOpen Script editor - use the help menu to launch the AppleScript Language Guide and search for the command you have. In this case \"do shell script\"\nThat takes you to: https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/CallCommandLineUtilities.html\nThe example there shows how to set a variable for a host name and then call ping:\nset theHostName to \"www.apple.com\"\ndo shell script \"ping -c1 \" & theHostName\n\nSo, in your case you'll need:\ndo shell script \"/path/to/script.sh\"  & myFile\n\nAt that point, you'll likely run into path issues so running small snippets of code in the editor, looking at the result and iterating should get you to solutions as inevitable errors in path, parsing, logic crop up. I left a typo in the second \"do shell script\" example above - pay attention to spaces and quotes :-)\n\nA: The first problem can be solved by exporting the path inside the do shell script part:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    choose file\n    set myFile to result as text\nend tell\ndo shell script \"export MYFILE=\" & quoted form of myFile & \" ; /Users/user_name/bin/sh/echo_var_myfile.sh\"\n\nIn my example \"echo_var_myfile.sh\" is\n#!/bin/bash\necho $MYFILE >> /Users/user_name/echo_var_myfile.txt\n\nThe executable bit has to be set:\nchmod +x /Users/user_name/bin/sh/echo_var_myfile.sh\n\nThe result is the path to the chosen file.\nYou mustn't add a second do shell script for the shell script because as soon as the first one runs it dies and no values are exported.\n", "Q: How to jump between Spaces on OS X when some are Fullscreen?

What to do? \n\nA: I've had this problem and its common.  I would like to help but will need more information about your attempts to solve because there is more than on potential solution.\nRestart your computer.  Sometimes that works just like a nap will make you feel better.\nCheck the power adapter (try a different one but be careful to pick the exact same voltage and cable) and trying different USB cables.   \nDrive format/file system issues are the next best guess for why its not working.  I'm sure you didn't reformat the drive for Windows when you used it on Windows because if it was reformatted then it will need to be reformatted again and the data is probable gone and while you could pay for data recovery its highly unlikely that would help.\nDrive letter issues is another.  Open Disk Utility and see if the drive is showing up there and if it is run First Aid on it and see if it starts showing up in the file system after you do that.\nTo use it for both you need to format it for FAT32 or exFAT.  exFAT enables larger file sizes relative to the older FAT32 which caps files in the 4GB range but exFAT only works on newer computers with more recent Windows XP and/or Snow Leopard (10.6) or newer operating systems.\nFor more information, you can try this more comprehensive guide: http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/external-hard-drive-not-recognized/\nHope this helps!

Later after some months, I created anther apple id with a new icloud mail. Now, I am using this new apple id on my apple devices. \nMy Problem:\nI need to use my old icloud email on my new apple id. In other words, I want to terminate my current (new) icloud mail and move the old icloud mail so I can use it with the new apple id instead.\nI tried different ways, but no solution! Is it possible ? \n\nA: No - if you really have two different AppleID each with different @icloud/@me/@mac addressed - they cannot be merged or swapped one for the other. If you just want to use the @icloud.com to log in to one AppleID that's also known by a different email address - you can do that easily by changing the username on each device.\nSee Apple ID - Want to make my xxx@icloud.com primary Apple ID?\nIf you have two AppleID - the best you can to towards merging them might be to make a family plan and share purchases and migrate mail/contact/calendar data off the account you wish to avoid.\nSee Renaming iCloud mail address for that.\n\nA: I have a similar problem. The best solution for me was to forward the mail from the old Apple ID to the new Apple ID. This way you can migrate over time to the new Apple ID.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in in icloud.com using your old Apple ID.\n\n*Open Mail.\n\n*Click Actions (cog in bottom-left) and choose Preferences. \n\n*Select Forward my email to and enter your new Apple ID. \n\n*Click Done.\n\n\nYou can also select \"Delete message after forwarding\" when you're sure it's all working correctly. \nI know it's not strictly what you want, but I found it the best solution to having an old and new account.\n", "Q: Sync Mac & Windows user profiles to OneDrive I'm running Parallels 11 with Mac El Capitan and Win 10, and Office 365 plus OneDrive installed on the Win side.   Am natively sharing my Desktop, Documents and Downloads folders between Mac/Win thru Parallels but I'd also like to sync them both with OneDrive.\nI don't want to use symlinks as OneDrive can't accept these, and if possible want the ability to shutdown my Win and run Mac on its own - so I'm thinking I need to customise the Win locations of each folder to OneDrive, and then use Offline Files or similar to sync with the Mac.\nAm not wanting an external sync program because from what I've seen they're not real robust unless its a service and watching for changes at a low level like OneDrive does, and I don't want scheduling.  Also need to run a large search index on the Win side as I have over 0.5m files including 50Gb email, and need this native to Win - so I can't run OneDrive on the Mac.  \nA tough one.!  . . . . . . . any suggestions.?\n\nA: OneDrive allows you to sync to whatever folder you desire. In your case, point it to a OneDrive folder in the shared Windows document folder. The Mac will simply have this folder in its Document folder as well. Whenever Windows is running, it will sync with Onedrive and populate the shared folder. Of course, since you don't have OneDrive on the Mac, it won't sync. You could always put OneDrive on the Mac, and point it to the same folder...\n", "Q: Volume on Mac increases automatically when earphones plugged in I have a MacBook Pro running El-Capitan v10.11.5. Whenever I plug in my earphones, the volume gradually increases (one bar every couple of minutes), automatically. This problem has been going on for at least some months, fairly sure this happened also in earlier OS versions.\nI didn't find anything about that online, is that a familiar issue? How can I solve it?\n\nA: Sounds like you have headphones with volume controls and either they volume up bottom is jammed/broken, or they're not compatible with macs... The first one is my guess. The second one is rare.\n\nA: I too had the same issue on my Early 2015 MacBook Air when paired with Samsung Earphones with volume controls. Unplugging the earphones and plugging it again resolved the issue for some time. Try rotating the AUX plug, to a different position. It worked for me.\n", "Q: Swapping HDD RAID 1 with SSD in Mac Mini I have a Mid 2011 Mac mini with 2x 500G HDD configured as RAID 1.\nRecently one of the HDD died. \nI planned to\n\n\n*\n\n*replace the dead HDD with a 500G SSD, and\n\n*let the RAID 1 rebuild\n\n\nIs this a viable option?\nIf viable, should I\n\n\n*\n\n*Leave the setup as is, or\n\n*Buy another 500G SSD and replace the other HDD\n\n\nOS is Yosemite.\n\nUpdate:\nSince the question and the answers, I had went ahead to buy 1 SSD, replaced the disk in the Mini by following videos on Youtube.\nThe RAID rebuilt without a problem.\nThe system \"appears\" to be more responsive than before.\n\nA: Is it a viable option?\nYes.\nYou could do either of your options given that you are using RAID 1.  \nThat said, I am not a fan of software based RAID.  It consumes CPU cycles that could otherwise be used somewhere else.    Given that SSDs are far more reliable than TSM (traditional spinning media), the chances of a drive failure go down significantly.\nWhat I would do is use the SSD as my primary drive and the second hard disk as an internal Time Machine drive.  You will get increased performance, more reliability and much quicker backups\n\nA: With RAID1 your disk drives write operations will be directed to both drives: your write operations will proceed at the speed of the slower drive. That is to say your system will always be waiting for the slower drive, and you will lose all the speed benefit of the SSD. \nRead operations will likely be directed to one drive only: you might or might not find a speed increase depending on configuration.

I used sudo chsh <username> /bin/bash and sudo chpass -s /bin/bash <username> in Terminal and it didn’t bring it back.\n\nA: Usually the proper disable Login Shell value is: /usr/bin/false instead of /bin/false.

I need to know if there is an app for iPhone 5 that would control the data (or lock it down entirely)?\nAlso need to control who is called and what callers can be received.\n\nA: The full information on use restrictions in iOS is here. It doesn't include the ability to restrict the use of phone calls or data, but you can restrict apps like Safari that use the data. Third-party apps are not permitted to modify fundamental iOS functionality like this.\n", "Q: AirDrop for iPhone SE and MacBook Air I'm trying to set up AirDrop to send files between my macbook and my iPhone.\nFor some reason it doesn't work at all. I turned it on both on the macbook and my iPhone SE and my iPhone is not shown in the Finder nor my macbook on iPhone's screen.\nHow to set this up?\n\nA: First, make sure your Mac is able to use AirDrop. The following Macs are able to use AirDrop:\nMacBook Pro (Late 2008) or later, excluding the MacBook Pro (17-inch, Late 2008)\nMacBook Air (Late 2010) or later\nMacBook (Late 2008) or later, excluding the white MacBook (Late 2008)\niMac (Early 2009) or later\nMac Mini (Mid 2010) or later\nMac Pro (Early 2009 with AirPort Extreme card, or Mid 2010)\nHowever, AirDropping files between iOS devices and Macs requires a 2012 model Mac or later.\n\nIf your Mac does work with AirDrop and AirDrop still doesn't work, here are several fixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reactivate Airdrop (on iPhone)\n\n\nGo to Control Center on your iPhone (accomplished by swiping up from the bottom of your screen).\nDisable Airdrop and then enable it again. Make sure your phone is discoverable to all devices.\nMake sure Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are enabled. If it still doesn't work, try toggling the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi button.\n\n\n*Restart your iPhone and Mac\n\n\nRestart your iPhone by pressing and holding the power button and home button at the same time.\nAnd you probably know how to restart your Mac.\n\n\n*Reset Wi-Fi\nLet both your Mac and iPhone forget your Wi-Fi network and/or password and reconnect to your Wi-Fi\n\n*Confirm AirDrop is enabled\nGo to Finder and click on AirDrop in the sidebar.\n\n\n*Update\n\n\nUpdate both your Mac and iPhone to the newest version of OS X and iOS, respectively.\n\n\n*Searching for older Macs?\n\n\nMake sure your Mac isn't searching for older Macs. Go to the AirDrop page in Finder and make sure it's searching for newer devices (including the iPhone).\n\n\n*Confirm Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are enabled on the Mac\n\n\nTurn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on the Mac. People often forget to turn on Bluetooth on their Mac in addition to their iPhone.\n\nHopefully, these tips will help you!\n\nA: Make sure your iPhone and Mac are connected not only to the same SSID but also the same band (2.4 vs. 5 GHz). Some routers will not bridge the necessary multicast traffic between the different bands. \nAdditional troubleshooting steps (this assumes your Wi-Fi network is being provided by your router, which is true for most people)\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz network in your Wi-fi base station (router) so that we can force the Macbook and iPhone to be on the same Wi-Fi band.\n\n*Verify your router's firmware is up to date, and apply the update if one is available.\n\n*Look in advanced settings in router and look for settings like multicast filtering and make sure they are disabled—Bonjour requires multicast traffic to work properly\n\n", "Q: Can you, and if so, how, set a repeat rate for mouse buttons? I have an external mouse, with programmable buttons. I'd like to set some of those buttons to repeat if I hold one of them down- similar to how keyboard keys repeat, but don't see where to do that. \n\nA: You can do this with a a product called ControllerMate.  They have a feature called the  Auto-Repeater Building Block\n\nThe Auto-Repeater building block provides a way to automatically\n  repeat events at a fixed rate.\nAn Auto-Repeater building block has one ON/OFF input and one ON/OFF\n  output. While the input is ON, the output turns ON and OFF at a\n  predetermined rate.\nTo configure an Auto-Repeater building block, enter the rate at which\n  it should turn its output ON and OFF. The rate can be given as the\n  number of repeats per second, or seconds per repeat.\n\n(They provide an example on the page linked above)\n\n\nBasically, if the Building Block detects an \"on\" state of an input (holding the button) it will auto repeat whatever you tell it to repeat at a set rate.\nYou will have to bypass the programming of the mouse and use this to program it.  I have done this with my Logitech MX Professional mouse and a second (Logitech) keyboard which I have reassigned keys to complex macros.\nController Mate has an unlimited trial period that is limited to 10 \"building blocks\" meaning you can have a single work flow of 10 blocks or 5 flows of 2 blocks or whatever combination so long as it has no more than 10.  However, at $25, it's a very reasonable solution.\n", "Q: How to change Font size for PDF in iPad running iOS 9? I have iPad mini 2 running iOS 9. I'm transferring my PDFs to the iPad via iTunes.\nI swear that I didn't find any option to increase font size in iBooks, not even in iBooks settings.\n\nA: I don't think it's possible. I can't find any way to adjust font size on PDFs using iBooks for iOS, nor can I find anything about it online. Apparently, one can only adjust the font size with books in iBooks and not PDFs.\n", "Q: Does a guest OS under Virtualbox need to install drivers for peripheral devices? I run a guest Ubuntu under Virtualbox in Mac OS X.\nThe host Mac OS X has been configured to print on a network printer by someone else. \nNow I try to configure the guest Ubuntu to print on the same network printer. I have provided the ip address and  PPD file (extracted from the driver) of the printer during setup , but when I try to print a test page, it doesn't work. \nNot sure what has been going wrong.\nIn general, when using a peripheral device on a guest OS, do I need to install its driver just as if the guest OS were a host OS?\nThanks. \n\nA: The short answer here is \"yes\"\nIf it's a network printer, you should be able to access it over the network as if you were on a physical host.\n\nA: How is the guest OS seeing the peripherals? Most likely, it is because VirtualBox is presenting them as virtual interface cards or USB. The only translation that VirtualBox is doing is to make those interfaces available, so the guest (Linux, Windows, etc.) still need to have drivers to know how to use the device in question. Printers are no different regardless of their network, USB or parallel connectivity.\nTo turn this sideways a bit, you could be connected to the internet via a dial-up modem. For the guest OS on VirtualBox, its network connectivity could appear as going over a NE2000 network card and require the appropriate drivers for that despite the fact that you're actually using a serial port modem.\n", "Q: Will an iphone in lost mode enable celular data on its own? My iphone has been put into lost mode by some hackers like this.\nI have regained access of my iCloud account and removed the lost mode from there however the phone has not updated yet because I always have cellular data disabled(because I dont have a plan for it) and I see that its not connecting to wifi. \nI can get 10MB data for a day from the Cell company.\nMy question is: Will iOS enable Cellular data on its own while in lost mode?\nI have an iphone 4 with ios 7\n\nA: In short - if your device doesn't have cellular, the lost mode transmission won't be received until / unless it rejoins or connects to the internet via WiFi or someone puts in a working SIM chip with compatible data plan.\nThis link may help you determine the answer to that question.\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH19299\nIn this article, you will see the following. Hopefully this answers your question.\n\n\n  \n*If you used Lost Mode, when tracking begins, you see your device’s current location, as well as any changes in its location on the map.\nIf your device is online  when\n  you put it in Lost Mode or lock it, it locks and tracking begins (if\n  applicable). If Location Services is turned off on the device, it’s\n  temporarily turned on to track your device’s location.

Supposedly, the red badge that shows up on the Calendar icon in the app switcher (and the Dock, if anyone still uses that) represents invitations that you've not dealt with.  That's a nice theory, but I have no invitations waiting for me to act on, and I still have a red badge with a \"3\" in it.\nI realize that I can disable the badge, but that seems like taking a hammer and smashing the light on the dashboard, instead of figuring out why it is lit up.  \nI want to know what (other than invitations waiting) could cause a red badge to show up on the Calendar.app icon.  If this is a bug (e.g. where Calendar is failing update its count of invitations) is there any way to fix it?  Is there any way to reset it?  If it's not a bug, what other entities get counted besides invitations?\n\nA: I had the same issue, disabled and reenabled the icloud account in calendar preferences and it got rid of the phantom badge\n\nA: I had to clear the notifications explicitly despite accepting a meeting invite. Here's a screenshot from macOS Mojave -\n\n\nA: My solution was eventually just to ditch Apple Calendar (after death by a thousand paper cuts) and buy BusyCal.  \nNo, I'm not affiliated with the company.  It's a bit overpriced in my opinion, but it's the best available option, and a calendar is pretty essential when you need one.  Even a lot of the features that I initially thought were silly have turned out to be very useful.  And they are constantly adding features, making tweaks, and fixing bugs.  Unlike Apple, in the case of their calendar.\n", "Q: Late 2013 Macbook Pro Versus a Later Build I have a used Macbook Pro i7 late 2013 that I bought when I started my contracting work.\nI was thinking of buying a new one (except 15\"), but I don't know if it's truly worth making the purchase. I figure I do some homework first.\nMy question is: what is the difference between a i7 late 2013 and a new model? Are there any benefits?\n\nA: Without knowing which i7, how much RAM, and what type of internal storage your 2013 system and the 2015 system you're looking at has, I can't really compare the performance of the machines. If you replace your old machine with a 2015 i7 and with at least the same amount of RAM and the same type of storage, the new one will be noticeably faster, particularly in GPU-intensive applications like Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, AutoCAD, video games, etc.\nThe new MacBook also has a Force Touch trackpad, which definitely feels different than the old style trackpad.\nYou'll also get improved battery life (from an improved battery, improved efficiency, and the fact that batteries lose capacity over time, so any new battery of equal or greater capacity will last longer than any old one.)\n", "Q: My iPad is being held for ransom I was able to restore my iPhone and iPod but my iPad is \"offline\" preventing me from getting out of lost mode.  I also have a call in to Apple.\nI've changed my Apple ID password and had to cancel my credit cards.\nAny help out there?\n\nA: Take the device into an Apple Store and explain the situation to them. Under certain circumstances they may be able to fix such an issue (for example, they are able to remove an iCloud lock from a MacBook, but it takes several days and several checks are done to ensure you own the device)\n", "Q: IPod Classic - music gone I turned on my iPod Classic 128 GB and all music content was gone.  I charged it and the Apple symbol appeared and then it turned on with no songs/music at all.\nI have not connected to iTunes at all recently.\nPlease advise.\nkristeen\n\nA: My old classic used to do that kind of trick to me periodically.\nI always suspected that the disk format was not particularly robust.\nI found the only way to get it going again was to Restore it in iTunes & reload the whole library again - don't plan on being in a hurry, it takes ages.\nOne thing I did learn over the years was to always leave the lock button on [the little slider at the top, slid to show the red dot underneath] all the time unless I actually needed to interact with it.  \nAlso to never leave it locked if I was about to connect it to iTunes, otherwise it would hang.\nRemembering those two would let me run far longer before it played tricks on me the next time.\n", "Q: Latest update of Apple iPhone 6s version 9.3.2 will not let me use most of my apps I'm getting a \"network error\" code, no matter which Wi-Fi I am using.\nHow to resolve this issue?\n\nA: Reset your Network Settings:\nSettings > General > Reset and click \"Reset Network Settings\"\n", "Q: Can't log into my MacPro user account I have an older Mac Pro in 10.11.

This needs to be done to allow for the creation of a symbolic link to the new location of the MobileSync Backup folder and the symlinks name also needs to be \"Backup\".\nTo create the symbolic link, it Terminal, use the following command line example while changing the path to what's appropriate for your use.\nln -s /Volumes/<Your External HDD>/MobileSync/Backup ~/Library/Application\\ Support/MobileSync/Backup\n\nWith the symbolic link created you can now open iTunes, connect the iPhone and perform a backup.\n", "Q: How do I get my iPhone and iPad to automatically search changes of IP addresses with WiFi extenders I have two WiFi extenders and when I move within the range of each extender or back to the router the IP addresses change but my iPhone and iPad don't apply the changes. I have to manually switch off WiFi and restart it to get the device to find the right address.\n\nA: Your devices (iPad, iPod) are not disconnecting from the first AP and connecting to the extender AP because the signal is still too good for it to disconnect from.\nOne of the best ways I have found to create a much more reliable wireless infrastructure is to turn down the transmission power of the WAP.  \nIn basic terms, this lowers the distance that a good signal will get to your device meaning your device will begin looking for a new WAP sooner.  The downside to this is that you will need more extenders.\nThe other way is to invest in \"Enterprise grade\" WAPs that have \"handoff\" built into the controller - this allows you to specify what the threshold is before the WAP \"kicks off\" the client and forces it to to search for another WAP.\n", "Q: Refreshing env variables by sourcing not working I installed torch in my MacBook Pro (running El Capitan).

If you use bash (which is default on OS X) you can do it by:\necho . ~/torch/install/bin/torch-activate >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nand restart your shell, i.e. close and reopen the Terminal.\nThis will have the same effect as suggested source ~/.profile (so you don't have to run it).\n", "Q: How can I copy files from a RDC PC to my Mac I need to copy some files from a RDC PC to my MAC. I can copy files from RDC to a PC but not to a mac. How can I do this? Thanks\n\nA: You could map a folder on the local Mac to the PC and then just move files using the PC copy interface. That's probably the simplest and works across many versions of windows and OS X as well as regardless of the network configuration.\nYou could set up a proper network share on the PC or Mac as well, but that's more work for little payoff.\n\nA: If you have Internet connectivity (who doesn't these days), you can use a Cloud Service to create a shared filespace that you can not only use between computers, you can use between computers located essentially anywhere.\nMy favorite is OneDrive, but I have also used Google Drive, Box, and Dropbox.\nThese are all cross platform (OS X, iOS, Android, Windows (7, 8, 10, Server, Linux and even Windows Phone). \n", "Q: How to get an iMessage conversation to go back from green to blue? After some overseas travel my imessage conversation with my contact (also an iPhone user) switched from blue (iMessage) to green (SMS) - due to problems with international roaming. \nWe're back in our home country, but the message conversation persists in SMS (green) and we'd like it to go back to iMessage (blue). I don't know how to click it back over. \nMy question is: How to get an iMessage conversation to go back from green to blue?\n\nA: Settings\nBefore doing anything:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit the Messages app (Double press your home button and swipe up on the Messages app).\n\n*Go to Settings > Messages and Turn OFF and then back ON your iMessage option.\n\n*Now open back Message and try to send a message to your friend 's iPhone, but make sure to use the button at the Top-Left corner to find your friend and start the conversation, don't just open your recent chat with him/her.\n\n\nThis should have reset your iMessage settings, so you should be able to send iMessages to your friend now.\n\nRestart\nIf the process above didn't solve the issue, you may want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your iPhone, long press the Sleep/Wake button until you see the Apple logo again, then release, OR you can long press until you see a slider which can be used to turn OFF the iPhone, once done that, press again the Sleep/Wake button to turn the iPhone back ON.\n\n*Try to send a message to your friend\n\n\nI'm sure you already know the difference between iMessage and normal SMS/MMS, although that, I'll leave you a link to the Apple Support page about the difference, have a great day!\n\nA: I read many comments to try and solve my inability to use iMessages with my friend, They all overlooked what my problem was. I turned iMessages on and off in Settings, restarted my iPhone 7 and deleted the entire past message thread between us.\nThe problem was, there are two ends to a message. My friend simply didn't have iMessage turned on on his end.\n\nA: *\n\n*Close your Messages app (double click the home button then swipe from bottom to top on the app)\n\n*Restart your phone. \n\n*After the phone boots back up, open Messages.\n\n*Initiate a message to the other person via the Compose button.\n\n\nRestart your iPhone by holding the Sleep/Wake button until you see a slider. Slide to shutdown your phone and wait until it is fully powered off before powering it back up.\n\nA: Send a photo or attach a screenshot to the message. That pushes data through the pipe and will show you that the iMessage network refreshes. This usually fixes the issue.\n\nA: Delete all messages in your feed to the effected \nperson that were sent via SMS.\nThen the green send arrow will be blue (just like it was when you \noriginally sent the current message).\n\nA: Delete the conversation that has text messages messaging.

I use my iPhone to connect to conference calls at work. Frequently I'll need to speak up, with little notice. But it takes me upwards of three seconds to be able to unmute to speak:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click home button to bring up lock screen.\n\n*Use fingerprint to unlock phone.\n\n*Hit green bar at the top to get into the current call.\n\n*Hit \"Hide\" on the keypad if it's up.\n\n*Finally, hit mute button to unmute.\n\n\nI have Googled around and not found any sort of shortcut here. Even the ear buds lack any sort of unmute feature. My workaround has been to sit there and fiddle with the phone screen for the whole call so it doesn't lock itself.\nWhat can I do to improve this situation?\n\nA: I've struggled with the same for years--and just discovered an easier way.  Tap the home or power button to get to the lock screen, or on the iPhone 6s or 7 just pick the phone up so the screen \"wakes up\".  \nYou'll see the phone number you're dialed into and the current call time in mm:ss at the top of the screen.  TAP THE PHONE NUMBER and you'll get the mute/keypad/speaker/add call screen, all without unlocking the phone.\n\nA: There is no \"good\" answer for this, but here's the best I can figure out.\nOnce you are on the call and muted:\n\n\n*\n\n*make sure you are on the screen that displays the mute/addcall/facetime/contacts buttons (I'll call this the \"mute screen\" from hereonout)\n\n*click the top button that turns off and locks the phone\n\n*when you need to unmute, you can click the on/off or home button and swipe right. at this point you will see the \"mute screen\" and you can unmute.\n\n*this only works once as far as I can tell. Once you have done this once, the next time the phone locks and you need to unmute, swiping right will not display the mute screen, but will just display your passcode pad as usual.\nNOTE: in order for this to work at all, the screen MUST BE the mute screen when you click the top on/off button. If you are on any other screen when the phone locks, this will not work even one time, as far as I can tell.\nI hope this is helpful.

Unless I am mistaken, HealthKit/Health.app will automatically track some BlueTooth sensors, like heart rate straps? Is that true?\nIs it also true that other sensors do not work this way, and only work when a 3rd party app is running. Is that also true?\nIf so, is there a list of such \"auto track\" devices?\n\nA: There are no \"auto-track\" devices per se. You have to go in and give certain apps or devices access to the Health data. \nAs detailed on Apple's website, you need to choose the fitness app or accessory you want to use, and this will connect it to your Health app.\nWhen you connect apps as a source of data to your Health app, they should automatically push in the data, but you might have to open the app for it to trigger. On the other hand, there are many, many devices that support automatic synchronization, like the Garmin Forerunner 220. \nUnfortunately there are too many devices supporting synchronization with an iOS device, but most apps or devices that are capable of synching with the Health app support auto-synchronization when in close proximity to the device.\nYou can see a list of HealthKit compatible devices here: http://www.applehealthkit.com/compatible-devices-apps/.\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable Apple Watch iMessage notifications while my MacBook Air is unlocked?

I did receive a European 5 watt USB charger model A1400 that claims to be from Apple. The charger even claims to be designed by Apple in California and made in China. Possibly by \"Salcomp\".\nThe \"made in China\" part, is most likely a valid claim.\nBut how can I find out whether this USB charger is a counterfeit or a genuine Apple product?\nI do own a genuine A1300 that came with an iPhone that was bought in an Apple store in Oberhausen.

I use it mainly with my Henge Docks vertical docking station and Dell 25-inch UHD monitor with external Apple keyboard. In this setup it works perfectly well. However…\nYesterday, when I have taken my MBP out of the docking station and tried to work just on the notebook without any additional devices attached, it shut down after about 30 mins. No warning message, nothing. Nothing in the system log either - only the BOOT_TIME information after the restart.\nIn the evening (working from home - no peripherals - just the power adapter) I have experienced another shutdown and then decided to install latest El Capitan patch. After that I have run the built-in diagnostics - no errors found.\nI tried to work but there were two more shut downs. After that I did reset the SMC and PRAM, but it did not solve my problem.\nToday at work - working with a docking station - computer was stable as rock. No restart - nothing. But when I came home it shut down after about 40-50 mins and then about every 20-30 mins. I have no clue how it can work perfectly well with the lid closed but shuts down without any peripherals attached but with the lid open.\nAny clues/hints? I am stuck and desperate (warranty ended long time ago).\nAdditional info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using WiFi both at work and at home Using Magic Mouse both at work\nand home Using only external display at work (lid closed in vertical\ndocking station) \n\n*Restarts only outside of docking station (no matter\nif battery only or power adapter attached) \n\n*Newest El Capitan \n\n*No sign of any error in the system log, Crash Reporter, Diagnostics etc. \n\n*No core dumps (yes, I have increased the soft limit for core dumps)\n\n*Coconut Battery says it has 91% of original capacity and that is\nhealthy \n\n*It shuts down even with effectively idle CPU (just chrome, mail - thats it) so I don’t think it is overheating - the fan is not\neven turned on \n\n*No message after I power it on again Shutdown looks as\nfollows: screen goes dark (though it still has the backlight),\nkeyboard illumination is on - it stays like that for 5-10 secs and\nthen shuts down. It does not boot up again by itself - need to do it\nmanually.\n\n\nA: I too have a late 2013 MacBook Pro, 15\" Retina Display that kept shutting down. I also reset the SMC and PRAM to no avail. With some web searching I found some people claimed it was the battery. I ran boot up diagnostics and it indicated the battery was failing. I replaced the battery, re-ran the boot up diagnostics and the battery issue was gone. However, it kept shutting down. With further web research I found that someone claimed if an HDMI monitor was attached, it did not shut down. (Perhaps in your case the docking station is connected to HDMI?) So, I tried it and sure enough it does not shut down when connected to an active HDMI monitor (i.e. I used and HDMI input on my TV). \nI even took it to the Apple \"Genius\" Bar. They ran diagnostics and found nothing wrong, but I ran it and showed them the issue still persists. They kept it overnight and ran extensive diagnostics and still could not find anything. They told me for a flat $575 they would guarantee to fix it (i.e. replace the motherboard). I opted out.\nI also took it to an authorized Apple repair facility for a second opinion. They couldn't find anything either. \nNow, having my MacBook Pro tethered to a TV was not ideal. Talking with a coworker the idea of building a gadget to act as an HDMI device came up. This prompted me to search the web for \"HDMI terminator\", to which I found this: http://www.fit-pc.com/web/products/fit-headless-gs (you can get it on Amazon).\nFor $8.50 I have found a solution to my satisfaction. So far, so good! I can close the lid and it sleeps without turning the fans on as it does with a connection to the HDMI TV. When I open the case, it just works. So short of having a small dongle plugged into the laptop, it works like new!\n\nA: I think this is a GPU failure, the easiest method is to install gfxCardStatus and set it to integrated only where the OS will use only the integrated method.\nAnother solution exists with Arch Linux where you disable the DGPU completely and the mac only runs on the integrated GPU. The method is clearly detailed here.\n\nA: Sounds like some sort of hardware failure to me, and since that model is so un-repairable your only option is probably to prepare for an expensive Apple Store bill. An (admittedly bad) workaround would be to keep the machine docked and use VNC + an iPad or something to use the machine on-the-go.\n\nA: Thermal paste MUST be replaced... I had same problem and solved as I exchanged the thermal paste for a quality one... \n", "Q: Solder new RAM in a 2015 Retina MacBook Pro I know that the new rMBPs have no \"user-serviceable\" RAM. But is it possible to solder a new RAM chip onto a 2015 rMBP? Given that the technician doing this is able to install the new chip without damaging anything, would it work?\n\nA: The short answer is yes (anything is possible), but is it feasible?\nThere's a ton of responses out there whether you can/cannot re-solder memory chips to Apple logic boards in an attempt to upgrade RAM.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation out there.  Basically, they all revolve around one of the following three themes:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's extremely difficult/impossible\n\n*No idea how much memory can be addressed\n\n*Physical space to \"add more chips\"\n\n\nImpossible and/or extremely difficult\nReplacing a chip is actually quite an easy process if you have a BGA rework station and a little bit of practice.1 You actually don't need a significant amount of \"electronic engineering\" skill to remove a chip and replace it with another.   It doesn't need to go back to the factory as doing BGA rework doesn't damage the board.\nAre you going to do this with a soldering iron/gun that you get from Radio Shack or your local electronics supply store?  No.\nHowever, obtaining a BGA rework station is not out of the realm of possibility either.  A quick search on Amazon yields both infrared and hot air rework stations that vary in price from $150 to $6,000 depending on the the bells and whistles you want.  The key here is how accurately the rework station can deliver the heat necessary to flow the solder.\n\nBecause the heated air or infrared light is focused directly to the work piece, heat damage to the remainder of the board is mitigated\nAs for my personal experience, I have had GPU's replaced in Apple logic boards that weren't covered by Apple's GPU replacement program using this exact method and not only got a year's warranty on the work, but the logic boards lasted for years after.  \nSo, can this work be done?  Yes.  Quite easily.\n\nHow much memory can be addressed?\nThere has been a lot of speculation as to how much memory a computer can address.  There has even been conjecture on the \"additional (physical) space\" required for the new chips. \nFirst and foremost, the memory limit is primarily determined by the CPU. For example, on an original i7-920 CPU, the maximum amount of memory that can be addressed is 24GB of RAM.\n\nIf you notice, Intel states that it's determined by the \"type of memory.\"  This is where the logic board comes into play. Depending on the type, the logic board and the memory modules available at the time may impose a limit less than what the CPU can address.\nHaven't you ever noticed that everymac.com has tested higher configurations that what was technically specified by Apple?\n\nThis is because what was available at the time the product was released, higher density memory chips weren't generally available.  When they become available,  you can upgrade your Mac past the specified limit.\nTo see what your particular CPU can address, obtain the CPU identifier from your machine and get the specs from http://www.intel.com\nSpace to add more...\nIn the pre-soldered RAM days, when you wanted to upgrade your Mac with more RAM, were you stopped because there wasn't any more \"real estate\" on your logic board?  No.  You replaced the module(s) with larger ones.\nMemory modules (of a particular family)2 only differ in density.  As for physical layout, pin out configuration, voltages, etc., they are identical.  So, using the example I linked with DigiKey, you could have 8 modules of 16M for 128M or 8 modules of 512M for 4G.  Same real estate, same configuration.\nSo, can you get \"bigger\" memory chips?  Yes.\n\nIs all of this feasible?\nAgain, in the pre-soldered RAM days of Apple it was quite easy to upgrade your memory.  Now, unless you are willing to invest in a rework machine and put in some practice reworking a BGA chip you are going to have to send this out to be done by someone with experience.\nI have sent many clients damaged logic boards to a firm in NYC that specializes in this type of work.  It usually costs between $350 and $500 depending on the severity and what parts are needed. Estimating that replacement memory chips would be around $200 and the work would be on the high end given that there are multiple chips to replace (say $450), you are looking at $650 to upgrade your memory.\nA quick look on Apple's website tells me that to upgrade a MacBook Pro from 8GB to 16GB is only $200.\n\nBottom line:  Is this feasible?\nKeep in mind, if you undertake this type of modification, you will void any warranty on your MacBook, if there is one still in effect.\nSo, we are left with a cost comparison:\n\n\n*\n\n*(Est) $650 to upgrade your memory & void your warranty\n\n*$200 to get it from Apple and keep warranty in full effect.\n\n\nNo this is not feasible.  Period.\n\n1 I actually did this work about 4 times a year, at the end of every fiscal quarter, when our company would go \"all hands on deck\" to the manufacturing and shipping departments to get as much product out the door as possible.  Normally, I worked in product management as a go between marketing and development.  However, for about a week every 3 months I was in the QA department re-flowing chips using a hot air rework station like the one referenced.  They gave me this job so the actual tech could spend time diagnosing the problem rather than spend time doing the mundane work of re-flowing a BGA.  I had about an hour or two of training and became quite proficient at it.\n\n2 The memory shown here is for illustration purposes only.  It's not intended to be the specification for memory used in any Apple or other manufacturers' product.\n\n\nA: I don't think this will be possible. The board will be manufactured with only that size of memory in mind, so the memory controller or other hardware would have to be changed too, and its not like there will be place for more memory chips.\nOne exception I can think of is if some higher model has more memory, then there might be some unpopulated place for chips.\nSee also: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/53627/189360\nAlso reworking BGA packages is... very close to impossible. Sourcing bigger memory modules would be the easiest part as I doubt Apple would use the biggest ones available and sources like DigiKey have them.\n\nA: You can definitely buy the requisite parts aftermarket - DigiKey would be the first place I would look. You could also remove the parts from another rMBP (e.g. flood damaged or something).\nYou can probably do the modification without damaging other things on the board, but it would be difficult. You are not going to do it at home. You're going to need someone very experienced with BGA rework with the appropriate equipment. It's a tightly packed double-sided board, so you need to be careful not to disturb other things nearby.\nI don't know how the machine knows how much RAM it is supposed to have. It probably has an SPD chip, which you'd also need to replace or modify. It might be written to one of the many NVMs elsewhere on the board, which would be harder to modify. You can find schematics of the rMBP online, and they may tell you if there is an SPD chip.\nThe iFixit teardowns show that the lower-specced machines do not have empty space for more chips; Apple does RAM upgrades by putting higher density parts in the same locations.\nSo... it might be possible, but it won't be easy. I would recommend selling the old machine on eBay (resale price is good!) and buying a new one with the specs that you want.\n", "Q: Sometimes Mac doesn't recognise my external hard drive I have a Western Digital My Passport Ultra 1 TB external hard drive that is formatted FAT32 and a 16 GB Silicon Power USB thumb drive and both of them uses USB3 but my MacBook Pro sometimes doesn't recognise them and I have to remove them or restart MacBook several times until they show up.\nWhat could be the problem?\nSpecs: MacBookPro12,1 2015 with OS X 10.11.5\n\nA: First, see if it appears in Disk Utility. If it appears but is not mounted, you can select the mount option which should mount your disk. Then, click on the Apple logo in the top left corner and select about my Mac. It should appear under storage. Also try going to the system report under the overview tab. Sometimes the lag can occur because fsck is running on it to repair any possible damage/recovery tools. People have also reported that it might not be receiving enough power if you have to plug it in. \nSide notes: This is commonly caused when the disk is removed without first ejecting\n\nA: There can be a number of reasons why your Macbook Pro won't recognize a drive.\nFor instance, if you have a drive mounted and your system goes to sleep, it will also power down the USB port, putting your drive to sleep.  When your Mac wakes up again, the drive may not have come out of its slumber.\nTo verify that your USB port is detecting devices, open \"Console\" (Applications > Utilities > Console).  For example, I inserted a Windows (FAT16) formatted USB flash drive that doesn't mount and doesn't show on my desktop.  However, in Console, you can see that it is detected and an error is generated:\n\nWhen you attach your USB devices, have Console running and watch to see if the device is detected and whether an error is generated.  If nothing happens here (with both devices) then you have ruled out your USB devices.  \nIf they are being recognized in the system, but not showing up, you may have to disconnect them and remount them in Terminal. \nFirst, see if they are listed.  Issue the command \ndiskutil list\nMy relevant output, again using my non-mountable USB as an example is as follows:\n/dev/disk4 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +15.6 MB    disk4\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk4s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS True Key                15.6 MB    disk4s2\n/dev/disk5 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *8.0 GB     disk5\n   1:             Windows_FAT_16                         2.1 GB     disk5s1 <----- My Problem Child\n\nEject the disk using the command\ndiskutil eject disk5\n(Obviously use the disk number that associated with your USB device)\nRunning diskutil list again shows the device is gone:\n/dev/disk4 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +15.6 MB    disk4\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk4s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS True Key                15.6 MB    disk4s2\n\nNow, physically remove, then reinsert the USB drive.   Your drive should be functioning again. \n\nA: Have you dropped your mbp ? I dropped mine once and the cable connecting the right side ports wasn't truly connected anymore. This lead to external hdds not being recognised and once recognised disconnecting without prompt.\n\nA: Something else to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Did you use the external hard disk correctly?\nIn my situation, that was the problem! Here is what I did wrong: I turned on the external HD case's power button, and then I plugged the USB cable into my Mac. I believed that you must always have power on your devices before plugging them into the Mac. But no drive showed up! Sometimes it worked but I didn't know why. Usually a Mac restart fixed it... I lived with this... for a long time.\nBut today I realized that the proper method for my external drive is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn OFF the external drive (if it's on).\n\n*Plug in the USB cable into the Mac.\n\n*Turn ON the external drive when the USB cable is connected.\n\n\nMy drive will ONLY initialize itself as a \"talking to the computer\" hard drive if I have the USB cable plugged into the Mac at the exact moment that I am turning the external drive on.\nI'm using a two-drive USB hard disk case. And it turns out that if I start the case WITHOUT having my USB cable plugged into my Mac already, then the case enters some kind of \"clone drive A to drive B\" solo-mode where it won't talk to the computer at all.\nSo I am just adding this answer for others that have the same situation. Try plugging your USB cable in FIRST, and THEN power on the external drive. That may be all it takes to solve it for you like it did for me!\nPS: Big thanks for @Allan who suggested that I look in the Console log. That was how I discovered that my USB device was detected by the computer but advertised no storage units. :) Some more fiddling later, I had realized that this particular drive enclosure's external storage mode is only activated if the Mac is already connected before powering on the drive.\n", "Q: ICMP packet with a negative round trip time? I often keep a ping running in my Terminal so that I can pop it up to keep an eye on any network issues in our office. Recently, I ended a long-running ping session and noticed in the summary statistics that the minimum round trip time was -520ms.\n\nDoes anyone have any explanations for this bug?\n\nA: There are several possible explanations for negative ping times:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are running OS X on a PC with a AMD Athlon™ 64 X2 Dual Core Processor which has a bug in the power management which may not only effect Windows but also OS X installations.\n\n*Google is tired of getting pinged 38325 times and is sending erroneous timestamps in the ICMP echo replies - simulating a relativistic twin paradox. The -520.236 ms echo reply packet pretends to come from the fast moving  \"younger\" twin server and the 7219027.621 ms echo reply is the silver-haired \"grandpa\" twin server standing still - both behind a misconfigured Einstein-Rosen voodoo load balancer!\n\n*ntpd did its work and adjusted the time while a ping was sent. This explains the negative time as well as the two-hour-ping: 7219027.621 ms are two hours and 19 seconds - the most prolonged ping I have ever seen!\nYou can reproduce it yourself by adjusting the time manually like in this ping listing:\n64 bytes from 185.62.237.118: icmp_seq=17 ttl=55 time=290.491 ms\n64 bytes from 185.62.237.118: icmp_seq=18 ttl=55 time=310.241 ms\n64 bytes from 185.62.237.118: icmp_seq=19 ttl=55 time=-11797.674 ms\n64 bytes from 185.62.237.118: icmp_seq=20 ttl=55 time=303.643 ms\n64 bytes from 185.62.237.118: icmp_seq=21 ttl=55 time=326.527 ms\n\nI turned the time back for several seconds while ping 19 was sent.\n", "Q: OSX: Spotlight shows the content of locked notes When I search in the spotlight for a locked note, I can see the content of that looked note. I went ahead and rebuilt the spotlight index, but still showing the content. Am I missing something here or is it a bug? OSX-ELCapitan 10.11.5\n\nA: You need to close your notes\n\nI justed tested this in OS 10.11.5 and the contents of the note don't show, just the title.\nI created a note and titled it for which it would be easy for Spotlight to find:  \"Smattering test note\"  (I have no other instance of \"Smattering\" on my system).  Here is what it looks like after I have locked and closed the note.\n\nDoing a Spotlight search for \"Smattering\" yields this result:\n\nIt autocompletes the note title (ligher grey text) and clicking on it opens the Notes App.  Until I unlock the note with my password, the contents are not visible.\nIf I don't lock and close my notes, if I do a Spotlight search, the contents will be visible\n", "Q: Why does my external harddrive not work when attached to this USB3 Hub? I own a Macbook Pro 15\" Mid 2015 which supports USB 3.0 and bought a Western Digital 2TB external USB3 harddrive and a USB 3.0 Hub from Anker with external power supply.\nWhen I plug-in the harddrive directly to the Macbook everything is fine.\nWhen I plug-in an Apple Thunderbolt display to the Macbook's Thunderbolt2 port and then plug-in the harddrive to the USB2.0 port of the display, it works too but it's very slow due to USB2.0 limitation.\nSo I bought the Anker USB hub and thought it would be alright as long as it has an external power supply. But when I plug-in the hub to the USB3 port of the Macbook and then attach the harddrive to the hub it doesn't work. The drive gets mounted and unmounted automatically in OSX all the time.\nBasically like this:\nMacbook USB3 ------  USB3 Harddrive                                  OK!\nMacbook TB2  ------   Display USB2   ------ USB3 Harddrive           OK!\nMacbook USB3 ------     Hub USB3     ------ USB3 Harddrive      Not working :-(\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nA: I finally found the solution. After contacting Anker as well as WD I found out that both, the Hub as well as the harddisk were fine. The cause for the problem was a low quality usb extension cable that was attached to my Macbook. After removing that and directly attaching the hub to the Macbook, everything works fine.\n", "Q: Apple Trackpad Causing Long Keypress Events In the last day my Apple Magic Trackpad has started to cause long keypress events when I type on the keyboard.\nFor example, pressing 'a' in a browser menu bar will cause the accent popup to appear. Pressing 'cmd+t' will cause multiple tabs to open, and causes the 'File' menu to noticeably flicker as if being selected.\nThis even happens on the login screen. It is impossible to for to log in if trackpad is enabled, since each keypress produces multiple entries in my password.\nIs anyone familiar with this situation and a potential fix?\n\nA: I have the same issue - still not managed to find a fix - I only noticed by chance when the keyboard issue went away if I disconnected the magic trackpad.\n", "Q: How can I reset the dock? I recently updated my computer from Mavericks to El Capitan, and I'm unable to add or remove items from the dock. If I attempt to change the dock, the computer freezes and I am unable to interact with the computer through the GUI.\nThe machine has multiple users, and I am the only user on this system that has this problem. I suspect that it's an issue with the way my dock is configured. Is there any way to \"factory-reset\" the dock? Failing that, is there any way to fix a dock that can't be modified?\n\nA: Using the terminal, you can try deleting your dock preferences, then restarting the dock:\n% defaults delete com.apple.dock\n% killall Dock\n\nThis won't affect the contents of your dock, but it will reset the preferences that you'd normally edit in the Dock panel of the System Preferences.\nEDIT: Per comments below, apparently this does reset dock contents for some people, but not for others—not clear why.\n", "Q: MacBook Misidentifies Physical Layout of Built-in Keyboard I have a really strange problem with my sister's MacBook Pro (Mid 2012, running El Capitan): it is incorrectly identifying the physical layout of the built-in keyboard. It isn't just a matter of mapping the buttons to characters incorrectly; the diagram shown in \"Keyboard Viewer\" actually shows more physical buttons than exist on the keyboard.\nNote: see the update at the end for the current status.\nThe physical keyboard appears to be the correct US English version, and it is called \"U.S.\" in the \"Input Sources\" preferences pane — but here's a screenshot of what Keyboard Viewer thinks it physically looks like:\n\nThe problems become more obvious with Shift pressed:\n\nThanks to Wikipedia-ing (and a helpful clue from the yen symbol), I think this is showing the Japanese Industrial Standard layout, but I don't actually read any East Asian alphabets, so I'm less than 100% confident.\nMy goal is to get the layout recognized as standard US QWERTY, either (preferably) by actually getting OS X to believe it is one, or by re-mapping the keys it believes it has. I've read Create and use your own input source, but so far without success. I think my issue may be that the characters it wants to map from are the Japanese(?) ones rather than the ASCII ones.\nInterestingly, I tried booting from a Ubuntu USB, and it recognized the keyboard with no problems. On the other hand, the layout was still incorrect when I booted from the OS X recovery partition.\nAny advice on how to correct this would be very greatly appreciated!\n\nUpdate 1:\nInspired by Tom Gewecke's answer below, I tried re-setting the SMC, which has changed things. Probably the fastest way to describe it is with two new screenshots (taken with the \"U.S.\" input source):\n\n*\n\n*With no keys pressed: \n\n*With Shift pressed: \nAs you can see, it's not Japanese anymore, but it also still doesn't match the layout of the physical keyboard. In Keyboard Viewer:\n\n*\n\n*The diagram shows a key with § and ± to the left of the 1/!\nkey. but the actual keyboard has a key marked `/~. When I press this key, Keyboard Viewer shows it as a press to the `/~ key between the z and left shift keys (there is no physical key between z and shift.\n\n*The diagram shows a vertical return/enter key and an extra \\/| key at the right-hand side of the home row, between '/\" and enter. The actual keyboard has a horizontal enter on the home row and has the \\/| key as the last key on the QWERTY row, to the right of ]/}. Again, Keyboard Viewer shows a press of the physical \\/| as a press of its misplaced key.\n\nSo, for practical purposes, this is a huge improvement, since the physical keys now all do what their keycaps say they do. On the other hand, something is clearly still wrong, since Keyboard viewer still has keys in the wrong place, keys that are the wrong shape, and one key in it's diagram (the §/± key) that isn't mapped to any to any physical key on the keyboard.\nUpdate 2:\nI've tried resetting the SMC a number of times; the resulting layout is always either JIS or ISO, but never ANSI, and I've yet to find any pattern that would allow me to predict which the result will be. More concerningly, even when I get an ISO layout by resetting the SMC, it will  revert to a JIS layout at some arbitrary point while using the system.\nUpdate 3:\nAfter a long delay, I recently gained access to this machine again. Following up on dan's comment, the keyboard is indeed showing the USB \"product id\" 0x0264, which appears to be the JIS variant for the MacbookPro10,1 (this model). Here's a screenshot:\n\n\nA: You machine is mistaking the Keyboard Type.

I am using an external monitor and the only way (that doesn't involve jumping through hoops) to turn off the MacBook Pro monitor is to close the lid.\nDoes closing the lid causes any problems? I have read the following on another website:\n\nYou can still run a single external monitor if you close the lid of\n  your laptop, but that restricts airflow and exposes your display to a\n  lot of heat. Not good.\n\n\nA: Clamshell Mode\nWhat you are describing when you operate your Mac laptop (Macbook/Pro/Air) is called closed clamshell mode or closed display mode.\nIn this Apple Support Article:  Use your Mac notebook computer in closed-display mode with an external display it goes into detail on what the requirements are and how your Mac will function depending on the version of OS X you are running.\nBut basically, you can hook up an external mouse, keyboard and display and use it like a desktop.  As far as what you can do with your Mac, pretty much anything you can do with it open, you can do with it closed\nVentilation\nThe vents on your Macbook are located in the rear and along the bottom - they are not obstructed when the lid is closed.\nHow heat gets dissipated is more determinant on where it's placed rather than if it's open or closed...\n\nWhere you use the system may affect fan behavior and heat as well.\n  Using the computer on a soft surface like a couch, pillow, bed, or\n  your lap can trap heat requiring higher fan activity. Using the\n  computer on a hard flat surface like a table or desk allows for\n  optimal radiation of heat.\n\nThe vents are located along the back, not under the keyboard: \n\nMac computers have air vents that allow heated air to exit. The vents\n  are in the back of the computer on the MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook\n  Pro, and Mac Pro computers. iMac (Mid 2012 and later) models vent\n  along the bottom edge of the computer. Make sure the vents remain\n  unblocked to allow your computer to perform at its best.\n\nThere is also no need to continually monitor the temperature of your machine.  The only time you need to do this is if you are having a problem like it's slowing down significantly or shutting down unexpectedly. \n\nThe System Management Controller (SMC) firmware on every Mac\n  manages the thermal conditions of the computer regardless of the\n  operating system.\n\nBasically, if your Mac gets \"too hot\" it will automatically shut it down to protect itself.  But before that happens, it will slow everything down to a crawl.  \nSource:  Apple Support - Learn about the fans in your Mac\n\nA: With some care it can be done safely. It depends by and large on what kind of loads you're placing on the MacBook when it's being used like this.\nThe MacBook Pro's ventilation operates optimally with the lid open. Closing the lid restricts airflow out of the vents that run along the inside of the hinge on the laptop as seen here:\n\nWhen the lid is closed, there's a slight gap along the bottom that's used as an exit route for the hot air coming out of those vents as seen here:\n\nIf you're closing the lid, you should ensure that the entirety of this exit path along the bottom of the laptop is free from obstructions. That means not placing the bottom of laptop on a flat surface. Generally a vertical stand like this is employed if you want to operate the laptop with the lid closed and ensure ventilation remains adequate:\n\nYou should monitor the temperature sensors of your laptop to ensure your workloads don't push the unit beyond normal operating temperatures when you're using it with the lid close. You can use something like iStat Menus to keep an eye on critical, system operating parameters such as CPU use and the various temperature sensors in your MacBook to make sure they stay within their safe operating limits.\n\nA: I have used 2010, 2013, 2016, and now 2018 MBP in 90% clamshell mode all the time. \nThey work ok BUT the rubber seal in your display lid will deteriorate. They will become sticky and can be annoying sometimes as some flakes will fall off.\n\nA: I have personally found that while most days, operating in clamshell mode with dual monitors and a decently intense workload is not a problem, at all, the hotter summer heat, in a room that has no air conditioning makes my 2.5 GHz I7 Macbook Pro, 16GB DDR3, AMD Radeon R9 M370X 2048 MB run slow, very slow, even internet searches lag and I have 80GB down and 10 GB up.\nSimply opening the laptop, and yes that turned on my retina screen, an unneeded third display for my workstation, seemed to allow more heat to dissipate and I almost immediately experienced a less sluggish experience than compared to Clamshell mode. It is 90 degrees outside and about the same in my office, I am almost naked as type this :)\n", "Q: Best Method for Converting An Executable to A Word Doc? I'm sorting through a bunch of old writings & am running across a large number of files, which are exe's rather than doc or docx or txt or any other normal text doc format. I am almost positive that all of these writings were done in Microsoft Word for Mac (probably) 2004. There are gibberish characters at the header & footers but the body text has all seemed intact, from what I've glanced at. I am curious about how this might have happened, but my priority right now is just reconverting these files back to a simple text format. There are hundreds of documents, mostly notes, but some finished pieces and I would much prefer to not have to go in & remove the junk text from all of them by hand. So...what are my options? thx\n\nA: The file you linked can be opened, for proper display, in LibreOffice, which by the way is free.\nI was also able to convert this file via the command line to a plain text document using LibreOffice's executable soffice using the following syntax:\n/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice --headless --convert-to txt $FileNameToConvert\n\nExample:\n/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice --headless --convert-to txt \"'…& hitting number three on 3\"\n\nThe above command created the \"'…& hitting number three on 3.txt\" file and I then opened it in TextEdit and it displayed properly as it should.\nYou can batch convert the documents in the same manner by using a wildcard (an asterisk), e.g..:\n/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice --headless --convert-to txt *\n\nThe above command to batch convert assumes you've installed LibreOffice in /Applications and placed the files to convert in their own directory and have changed to that directory in Terminal.\nNote: If you want to convert the files to Microsoft Word documents use doc or docx instead of txt for the --convert-to option, e.g.: --convert-to doc\n\nA: The command line utility textutil can do the job. The basic syntax would be\ntextutil -convert txt -- filename\n\nTo batch process a group of files in a folder the syntax would be\ntextutil -convert txt -- /path/to/folder/*\n\ntextutil can convert both .doc and docx files among other file formats.\n", "Q: SMS to 2 iPhones Why do SMS messages addressed to me also go to my wife. I also get messages addressed to her. We both use iPhones and have an Apple Mac which also connects to iCloud.\n\nA: If you are both using the same Apple ID then it is most likely 'Text Message Forwarding', a feature of Continuity in iCloud.\nTo disable this, go to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive and turn un-tick any other numbers that aren't yours.\nAlso, go to Settings > Messages > Text Message Forwarding and ensure it is turned off for any devices you don't want your messages showing up on.\nAlternatively, look into setting up Family Sharing so that you and your wife can both have separate Apple IDs.\n", "Q: External Hard Drive Not Showing Up after dragging it to Terminal?

Of course, I want to save the old emails so that I can access them if I need to. I want to save them on my Time Capsule so that they do not fill my local disk. How can I do this best?\n\nA: Move your `~/Library/Mail' folder in the capsule.  Please note that:\n\n\n*\n\n*the folder can contain subfolders with 'odd' names such as V3 or V4 and these contain your mail (hence my suggestion to move or copy the whole folder and not just the subfolders).\n\n*moving the aforementioned folder will save all your mail, but you will have little usability -- that mail can be re-imported in Mail but I have never done so using a disk that might not be available 100% of the time.  If you do not want to have this data in Mail finding specific emails might be an issues, even keeping in mind the fact Spotlight will index these files (if you let Spotlight index your capsule).\n\n", "Q: Change the nature of a project with iMovie I have created a Movie with iMovie.

I have followed all the instructions about how to turn on iMessage, add an iCloud account, and starting a conversation from iCloud messaging. \nI even bought more storage for iCloud. Please help me.\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure you understand what Messages is meant to be used for. Messages is not an email client. \nYou can, however, receive Messages at your iCloud email and Gmail accounts. However, you don't receive them in your respective email mailboxes. You will, instead, receive those messages in the Messages application on your Mac or iOS device. Also, keep in mind that just because you can receive messages when someone sends them to your email address, that doesn't mean someone can send you an email from their iCloud or Gmail accounts and it come in via the Messages application. Again, Messages is not an email client. \nFor example, I enable an email address in the Messages application settings on my Macbook. My friend sends me a text via the Messages application on their iPhone. They can send the message to me either by my iPhone's cell phone number or by my email address that I added on my Macbook. That same friend opens their Gmail mailbox and sends an email to that same email address that I set up in my Messages app settings. Their email does not come to my Messages application because it's an email. Similarly, you can't email your friend at their email address and expect it to show in the Messages application. \nMessages can be sent from the Messages application on one device to another Messages application on a different device. \n", "Q: Macbook Pro weight increased after battery replacement After my battery died I have replaced it in Authorized Service Provider.

Has anyone had the same experience?\n\nA: You can check what the weight of the MacBook Pro should be from Apple's specifications and compare with the current weight of your machine. If it turns out that your machine is heavier, you can then do something about it.\n", "Q: How can I get Aperture to use gmail for emailing photos? I use gmail in a web browser.

Mac Pro 4,1, upgraded to higher 5,1 spec than was available when new. All Apple, but there was never a 3.46 model originally.\nI have no idea what was in it before, as I bought it ready-upgraded.\nWhat worries me is that the 'main' temperatures reported by iStat Menus - which on this machine are the CPU A & B Tdiodes [not that I really know what they are] - are consistently out by about 15°C\nUnder minimal load, this comes out as approx CPU A at 60°C & CPU B at only 45°C\nIf I put the machine under load, I've seen that lift to perhaps 75°C & 60°C\nThe booster fans always run at the roughly same speed as each other, whatever that speed might be, increasing with load of course.\n\nBTW, it's not always exactly 15° but around that value.\nI have an older Mac Pro 3,1 which, though iStat measures a different sensor for the 'main' temperature [CPU A & B Heatsink], is always within a degree, right now 35/36°C \n\nI'm not worried about the apparent temperature difference between the two machines, as not the same thing is being measured.\nSo, my question is...\nDoes anyone know if this difference between CPU A & B temperatures is normal, or if I need to be looking at the thermal paste etc?  \nThe airflow is clean. I do it regularly anyway & did it just before I posted this question.\nI've never stripped a Mac right down to the CPUs before [though I've done dozens of generic PCs over the years] so I wanted to get a second opinion.\nA small side question - does anyone know which is A & B, physically? Is A to the front, B to the rear? I know they're labelled on the PCB, but it's not visible until you strip them & I can't find a picture of sufficient clarity.  \nSolution to the side question - CPU A is to the rear of the machine, so the air hitting it will have already passed over CPU B's heat-sink.\n\n\nA: I upgraded my 4,1 Mac Pro to a pair of X5690s and am seeing exactly the same Tdiode temperatures as you - CPU A around 61°C and CPU B around 46°C at idle.\nIt seems to be normal owing to the inline airflow and discrepancies in heatsink size. As others have said, as long as the Tcase max temp is not exceeded on either CPU, I think we're fine and can rest safe in the knowledge that it's not due to bad/inconsistent thermal paste application.\n", "Q: Change space of other non-active display via keyboard My two displays (let call them A and B) have separate spaces.

Li+ rechargeable batteries [like the kind in a\n  MacBook] have a self-discharge rate typically stated by manufacturers\n  to be 1.5-2% per month.\n\nBasically, even if you are not charging or discharging your Mac battery at all, it will still lose 1-2% of its capacity every month (on average). You stated your battery age as 7.2 months, and your original battery capacity as 6960 mAh. (Side note: anyone else can find out their battery capacity, original capacity, and battery age with this tool.) Assuming it discharged 1% a month while in storage for 7 months, that means your battery could have lost 487 mAh while in storage. So, it is perfectly reasonable for your 7 month old battery to have lost 350mAh. \nIt is a little frustrating to have a somewhat old battery when you have purchased a new computer, but that's just how it goes. Li-ion batteries last well for about 4-5 years, so 7 months isn't too long on that scale. You will probably need to replace your Mac's battery (or get a new computer) in 2021. So, you have plenty of time to enjoy your new Mac before things even start to go downhill.

From Apple's Support Article:  Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Keyboard compatibility with iOS devices:\n\nSince the Fn keys don't work per Apple, it's a safe bet that you won't be able to remap them.  You have to recognize them in order to reassign their function.\nThis is most likely the reason that you will need to utilize the softkeys provided for by the App.\n\nWhat you can try is using the Escape sequence: Esc #  combination where # is the number of the Fn key you are trying to press (i.e. Esc2 for F2)\n", "Q: Mac App SQLDeveloper stuck in Dock after application closed, Process killed I just started experiencing a bug where the SQLDeveloper 4.1.3 (latest) app icon freezes in the mac OS dock.

Half-performing Time-Machine can mess things up pretty badly (you don't need to be being told this, you're living it).\nThis is most easily done (read: Unless you want to open it, which isn't terrible, but definitely not for a novice) by holding the \"T\" button on the keyboard while powering up. This basically is like opening up your Mac, removing the internal drive, placing it in an enclosure, and then connecting it to another Mac. But it does all of that without any disassembly.\nBefore entering Target Disk Mode, you’ll need a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two Macs: Target Disk Mode works with Macs, so you’ll need two Macs for this. Each Mac needs either a Thunderbolt port or a Firewire port. [You might need to borrow a friends' if you don't have one]\n\n*A Firewire or Thunderbolt Cable: You’ll need either a Firewire cable\nor a Thunderbolt cable for this. You can’t do this via a USB cable.\nIf one Mac has a Thunderbolt port and the other Mac has a Firewire\nport, you’ll need a Thunderbolt-to-Firewire adapter cable.\n\n*FileVault Disabled: Macs now enable FileVault encryption by default,\nwhich will prevent you from accessing FileVault-encrypted home\ndirectories over Target Disk Mode. Before using Target Disk Mode, you\ncan boot the Mac normally, open the System Preferences window, select\nSecurity & Privacy, select FileVault, and temporarily turn it off.\nYou can turn it on again after using Target Disk Mode. [You can't do this step, so we'll just hope it was off...]\n\n*No Firmware Password: If you’ve set a firmware password in the\nrecovery environment, you’ll need to disable that first. [If this makes no sense, you probably don't have one]\n\n\nWith Target Disk Mode, you can treat a Mac’s internal drive as an external drive and boot from it, just as you’d boot from a typical external drive. This actually lets you boot the OS X system from one Mac on another Mac.\nYou can also simply plug it into another Mac, and download your important files. Once this is done, we will want to reinstall Mac OSX onto the iMac. \nTo Re-install OSX once your files are safe and sound:\nImmediately after hearing the Mac boot chime, hold down Command+Option+R – if you see the Apple logo you waited too long and need to reboot and try again*\nOPTIONAL: You may or may not see an option to join a wi-fi network, this depends on whether the Mac can access any saved networks from OS X or not When you see a spinning globe icon, Internet Recovery mode has been entered with a message saying it can take a while, a progress bar appears as the recovery functions are downloaded Starting OS X Internet Recovery Mode on a Mac to reinstall system software.\nWhen finished downloading, you’ll see the familiar “OS X Utilities” screen, choose “Reinstall OS X” to begin the re-installation process of the Mac operating system Install OS X from Internet Recovery.\nSelect the destination and complete the re-installation (or installation) of OS X as usual.\nSources [First Half, Second Half].\n\nA: The SSD is disk0, the internal HDD (which should be disk1 if a Fusion disk is attached) is missing. Instead your recovery volume (loaded from Apple) is disk1.\nYour internal HDD probably either died or the SATA cable is loose/broken. You have to replace the HDD and/or the cable.\nThe SSD seems to be functional but misses any partition. It already contains a GUID partition table though.\nIf the size of the backup data is smaller than ~118 GB (which is unlikely) you should be able to restore it after adding a partition. Otherwise you have to replace the HDD part of the Fusion disk and restore the backup later.\nA temporary work-around is to restore OS X after adding a partition in Internet Recovery Mode, updating to your current OS X and then use the Migration Assistant to only import the most important data.\n", "Q: Location of the resource files for the spinning wait cursor? For a presentation I am making, I want to find my Mac's system's default \"Spinning Wait Cursor\" resources.\nI was told that the cursors are in here:\n    /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/HiServices.framework/Versions/A/Resources/cursors\nand here:\n    /System/Library/Frameworks/WebKit.framework/Versions/Current/Frameworks/WebCore.framework/Resources/\nIndeed, one can find some large and vectorized versions of most cursors in the first folder, and some other, smaller ones in the second.\nBut, there seems to be no beach ball in there. \nI know one can find the graphics in high resolution online easily, but for my project I would need to get the original system files.\nA screenshot or animated screenshot also wouldn't be what I'm looking for. I couldn't find the info anywhere.\nNote 1:\nFrom the GUI, a user can see the spinning wait cursor in various different sizes depending on the settings in System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Cursor size, and then proceeding to crash their computer.\nNote2:\nI am not trying to change my OS' appearance.\nCan anyone help me find where the resource is? \nIs it hardcoded like the startup chime?\n\nA: Cursors are rendered using CoreGraphics\nThe Wait Cursor or what is sometimes affectionately know as the \"spinning beachball of death\" is rendered in CoreGraphics (Apple's 2D rendering engine). Meaning, they are generated on the fly depending on what your preferences are set to (i.e. cursor size).\nThe CoreGraphics file is located at /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/CoreGraphics.framework/Versions/A/CoreGraphics\nFrom my research I was able to find the parameters for the Wait Cursor: $23766C - $23D66C\"\nAs far as working with images stored in CoreGraphics, I can point you to this tutorial:  Core Graphics on OS X Tutorial\nStatic Images of Wait Cursor\nThere is a directory that has static images of the cursors:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework/Versions/A/Resources\nWithin that directory you will find a number of TIFF files.  The specific file is waitCursor.tiff\nOpening the file with preview (open waitCursor.tiff) yields the following graphic (it's quite small):\n\n\nHow I located the file....\nThe El Capitan cusors link you provided had broken img src links, so I used the one for Yosemite for reference as they are pretty much the same.  The icon you wanted is called the \"Wait cursor.\"\nSo, using the find command in Terminal, I executed the following:\nfind /System -iname waitcursor*\n\nThe command basically says starting from the /System directory, look for all files with the name \"waitCursor\" in it regardless of case.\nI guessed the format of the name from the file naming conventions in the directory you initially provided.

When I'm travelling or in other situations where reliable communication is more important than user experience, I want to always have it enabled, sometimes for days at a time. \nHowever, iOS automatically turns it off after the phone has been charged, requiring me to remember to go in and re-enable it after unplugging my phone. I occasionally forget.\nIs there any way (including third-party apps, excluding rooting/jailbreaking) for me to automatically or persistently enable Low Power Mode, aside from the system's automatic behaviour at 20%? A way to leave it on indefinitely, or a way to have it automatically activate earlier (such as at 50%), or a way to activate it based on a schedule?\nIf there's no user-accessible way to do this yet, I would also be interested in knowing if there are any mechanisms in the operating system (URL schemes, framework APIs) that could potentially be used to control Low Power Mode.\n\nA: Yes, the _CDBatterySaver API in the CoreDuet (Private*)Framework can be used to toggle low power mode.\nAn example invocation, untested:\n#import <CoreDuet/CoreDuet.h>\n#import <objc/runtime.h>\n\n-(void)setLowPowerMode:(BOOL) isOn {\n    _CDBatterySaver *batterySaver = [objc_getClass(\"_CDBatterySaver\") batterySaver];\n    int nextState;\n\n    if(isOn) {\n        nextState = 1;\n    } else {\n        nextState = 0;\n    }\n\n    if([batterySaver setMode:nextState]) {\n        NSLog(@\"Set power mode state\");\n    }\n}\n\nI'd wrap this in an app with a background task to watch for low power mode (both well documented APIs). This can be done with Xcode as Apple allow building and installation of apps to your phone without requiring a developer license (IIRC).\n*See answer to question how to import private frameworks in xcode.

(via Terminal maybe?)\n\nA: Apple have removed this function on macOS Sierra, but you can re-enable it running this in terminal:\nsudo spctl --master-disable \n\n\nAdditionally, as Jack points out:\n\nGranted this is a little overkill, but it does the job reliably. It can be re-enabled immediately after launching the application with\nsudo spctl --master-enable\n\n\n\nA: Gatekeeper options are redesigned by Apple for Sierra.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/706/?time=1339\nWhat it comes down to is that Apple is removing the \"Install from Anywhere\" option for the \"general user\" or the masses of people that are not power users.\nHowever as already answered by user Mateusz Szlosek, you can still open unsigned apps via Finder by right clicking (Ctrl clicking) on the Application and selecting Open.\n\nA: \nOS X improves download validation by providing file quarantine in applications that download files from the Internet. This means that downloads are checked for safety (known malware) when you try to open them.\n\nYou can check an app (or any file) in quarantine using terminal. It's literally an extended file system attribute:\nmac:~ user$ xattr /Applications/Some.app\ncom.apple.quarantine\nmac:~ user$\n\nIf you're absolutely sure it's safe to run the app, you can drop the attribute like follows (you'll be asked to provide your password):\nmac:~ user$ sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Some.app\n\nCheck once again:\nmac:~ user$ xattr /Applications/Some.app\nmac:~ user$\n\nNow you should be able to run the app.\n\nA: You can open those files with Seconday Click (Right Click or ⌃CTRL+Click) in Finder and choosing open. \nRight now (10.12 Beta (16A294a)) - there is no check box to add an Anywhere option back in the preferences. \n\nA: If the app was extracted from an archive, it might be your archive extraction utility.\nAfter checking out the other answers found here, none of them were working for me.\nEventually I realized the issue was my archive extraction utility (Keka 1.0.6) was silently failing to extract the app from its .zip file, and even though the app looked intact with the correct icon and everything, it was failing to read the package contents and would throw up a generic error message:\n\nThe application “AppNameHere.app” can’t be opened.\n\nI swapped back over to using the built-in \"Archive Utility.app\" and everything went smoothly after that.

At WWDC2016 Apple announced that ApplePay could be used to make purchases in Safari and they've created a JS API to allow this. From what I can see this is only for once-off purchases, it simply authenticates you and charges your card.\nIs there any similar tool to access purchases which have already been made via an app which the website owner has created? For example if someone buys my task management app from the AppStore, can they then go to my website and \"log in with ApplePay\" or \"log in with TouchID\" and (if Apple confirms they have purchased my app) they can now they can access the web version of the product, customer-only support, etc.\n\nA: I do not believe it is possible. Apple makes it very clear that, in order to protect your privacy, they cannot see what you buy with ApplePay. So there is no way ApplePay could be used to look up past purchases.\n\nA: As Apple's written in its Support Website:\n\nWith the release of macOS Sierra and iOS 10, Apple Pay is coming to Safari on your Mac, iPhone, and iPad. So the purchases you make on many of your favorite websites will be faster and more secure than ever.\n\nNow, this opens a whole new world for online purchases, especially because all you'll have to do to make purchases online will be to lay your finger on the Touch ID sensor of your iDevice and that's it.\nWhat I want to say is this new Apple Pay's feature implementation and utilization is all up to developers, and as such, we can just try to imagine what to expect this fall.\nPossibilities\nAs you mentioned in your question above, developers who may think of having a 'continuity' feature for their Apps, may think about having Apple Pay enabled on their Apps website in order to provide their customers with even further functionalities which however will have to be purchased first.\nEven if there are many ways this new feature could be used for, we're very sure it will affect many of the major (and not only) online markets, probably like Amazon, eBay, etc..\n\nmacOS Sierra\nTalking about Beta OS from Apple, as this feature is from the upcoming new release of their OS for Macs (macOS Sierra), you may find useful to know all the Beta program will accept Public users starting from July, in case you'll want to enroll and try it before the Official release coming this fall.\nFor further details about the new macOS Sierra, I'll link you Apple's webpage for it.\n", "Q: Draft emails on Apple Mac Using Apple \"Mail\" I saved an email to \"Drafts\". I wanted to forward it to someone for review before sending it to the addressees. Having sent it I noticed that it is no longer in \"Drafts\". Can anyone tell me where it is & how to send it when I get the confirmation that it is ok?\n\nA: Emails saved as a draft only stay in Drafts until sent or deleted.  Once sent, a copy can be found in the Sent Mailbox.\nTo send again, select the target email in the Sent Mailbox and then press shiftcommandD or click: Message > Send Again\nThis opens the previously sent email in a new message container, where you can modify as needed/wanted and send again.\n\nUpdate: Composed emails not sent are saved as drafts in the Drafts Mailbox. It is the normal and expected behavior when opening a draft email and sending it that it no longer be in the Drafts Mailbox and to think otherwise is illogical. It was after all sent!\nIn the future, if you have a draft email that you'd like to send, yet retain a copy in the Drafts Mailbox, e.g. send to a recipient for review before sending to other recipients, then you must first select the target email in the Drafts Mailbox and make a copy of it pressing ⌘C ⌘V and then double-click to open the saved draft.\nYou can then send what is the draft and still have an unsent copy of the draft to process further, as needed/wanted remaining in the Drafts Mailbox, because after all... it is a separate email container/object that has yet to be sent.\n", "Q: Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError (Trying run Alda on OS X) I've hit a wall with trying to get Alda to run on OS X. \nIt's an executable I downloaded from here; then, as per the installation guide on GitHub, I ran chmod +x alda on it, and then moved it to my /usr/local/bin.

However one can create an Automator Service which can then have a keyboard shortcut assigned to it.\nThe problem with that method is finding a globally responsive keyboard shortcut that will trigger without interference and work consistently regardless of what has focus when the keyboard short is triggered. In some cases it may be advantageous to use a third-party app, e.g Karabiner, to accomplish the task.\nWhat I'm presenting here is a command that can be executed, a number of different ways, and incorporated into an Automator Service and or an AppleScript Application, etc.\nAs an Automator Service, all that is required is adding a Run Shell Script Action with the command. You might also be able to use the command in conjunction with a third-party app that can be triggered by a keyboard shortcut.\nPersonally, whenever applicable, I like to use an AppleScript Application because I can trigger it using Spotlight or place it on the Dock, etc. It may be a few extra keystrokes however for me it just works better and I avoid what can be problematic with trying to assign an Automator Service a global keyboard shortcut. \nThe command that will invoke the Login Window is:\nAs a Terminal command and or a Run Shell Script Action in Automator:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\n\nIn AppleScript the command is:\ndo shell script \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\"\n\nIf you'd like to switch directly to a different user you can use the following command as an example.\nAs a Terminal command and or a Run Shell Script Action in Automator:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -switchToUserID 502\n\nIn AppleScript the command is:\ndo shell script \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -switchToUserID 502\"\n\nMy primary login User ID ($UID) is 501 and I have a Test Account which has a $UID of 502. So the above command enables me to invoke Fast User Switching to my Test Account using Spotlight (Command-Space) and the AppleScript app named TA.app. It is the top hit in Spotlight so if I type Command-Space-T-A-Enter I get my Test Account Login Window quickly and easily.\nSo with the commands provided, you should be able to utilize what's appropriate to your needs/wants to code with in a much easier way then the code you've shown in your question.\nNote: Make note of the double-backslash in the AppleScript do shell script command line to escape the space in the shell command line vs. the single-backslash as a normal command in Terminal.\n\nA: You will find the user accounts system preference pane here on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan):\nPress cmdshift+ G in Finder, and paste the following path:\n /System/Library/PreferencePanes/\n\nThe one you´re looking for is called \"Accounts.prefPane\". To make it real easy to access by keyboard shortcut, you can start Automator, click \"New\" and choose \"Service\". Set it to \"not receive data from a application\", and add the Automator action \"Open Finder objects\" from the \"Files and folders\" category. From there, browse to the path I described above and choose the \"Accounts\" prefpane.\nSave the service, and go to System Preferences -> Keyboard. Select \"shortcuts\", and choose \"Services\". From the list on the right, scroll until you see the name of the service you just made. Select it, and click in the right field to assign a new shortcut. \nRun the service once from the Finder->Services menu, and now you have just made yourself a keyboard shortcut to the user accounts area in OS X. Voilá.\nYou can of course also make an alias to that one, or any of the other prefpanes - and even drag it to the Finder toolbar for quick access, quite handy.\n", "Q: How do I get icloud to stop emailing me about my google calendar events? iCloud, iCal and Mail integrates pretty well with Google Calendar, even though they are not both from Apple.\nBut I have a hassle when it comes to Calendar Notification in Mail App specifically.\nI get notifications correctly on OS X, iPhone, about Google Calendar.

We want to continue sharing contacts and calendars.  Can this be done if we use separate  Apple ID s? We don't want to keep getting each others messages and calls.\n\nA: Yes, you can. However, since Apple ID's aren't designed to be used with multiple users Family Sharing would be a more suitable option.\nTo do this you'll first want to turn off the syncing features you don't want in Settings > iCloud.\nTo avoid receiving each other's calls, etc you'll want to disable some of the Continuity features like \"iPhone Cellular Calls\".\nAlso, ensure that Automatic Downloads aren't turned on in Settings > iTunes & App Store to avoid your partner's purchases being downloaded to your device automatically.\n\nA: This can be done on your own but since it would be the first time you set this up, I recommend getting Apple's help. If you're close to an Apple store, make a Genius appointment. If not, and one of the devices is still under warranty, contact Apple via chat or phone and have them walk you thru it. Having someone with you while you do this is extremely helpful.\n\nA: You can share a calendar. Based on my personal experience, you could make a Google Calendar and sign in to whatever devices with that Google account and have it set to sync calendars. I think it could also sync contacts, but I haven't tried that. That way contacts and calendars is separate from your Apple IDs.\n", "Q: How to export Reminders task to Todoist?

Inherited a MacBook Pro (2010 MacBook6,1 17\"). Starts up fine, but wouldn't boot - no operating system found. Hard drive does not appear to be bad (see details below) but I can't seem to get it to accept an OS installation. What I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Starting system using my 13\" MBP as host drive in Target Disk Mode (intent was to check system hardware before I tried anything else) - would not boot, some type of error message appears over the loading screen, system reboots too quickly to read it.\n\n*Placing 17\" MBP in Target Disk Mode - My 13\" reads the disk just fine, Disk Utility sees no errors in the volume, reformatting the volume gives no errors\n\n*Starting from included OS X 10.6 installation DVD - Loads fine, Disk Utility shows no errors, installation initiates correctly, but exits with an error stating the installation could not complete on this system.\n\n*Cloning Recovery Partition from the 13\" MBP (using CarbonCopy Cloner) - Will not boot, same text error as encountered using 13\" in Target Disk Mode\n\n*Internet Recovery - system initiates recovery, but immediately throws a \"-6002F\" error\n\n*Starting in Single User Mode didn't highlight any obvious errors that I could see.\n\n\nSo... what next? I have NOT tried resetting PRAM or SMC. I do have another hard drive that I could swap in if needed (currently this drive is inside a 2007 MBP with a dead motherboard, so swapping it would require removal of 37,000 tiny screws). I probably have some memory that would be compatible, if it's an issue there, as it appears to take the same specs as my 13\", but am hoping that's not the problem (I upgraded the 13\" from 4 to 16 GB RAM, 17\" currently has 8 GB, so swapping it could cut the memory in half, depending on DIMM arrangement - I haven't cracked the case yet to check).\nSuggestions?\n\nA: Appears to have been a bad memory module. I swapped in a known good hard drive (with OS already installed) with no success, reset PRAM (which restored startup sound) but didn't help the boot process. However, as soon as I pulled the RAM and replaced with a known good pair of DIMMs it booted right up. (Unfortunately that also means I went from 8 GB to 2 GB RAM - so I think I'll be placing an order for an upgrade!)\n", "Q: Collecting All Clients logs every night We have a financial institution we are bring on as a client running on Mac's.  The are looking to collect all the system logs from each computer every night and keep each for 90 days. I have seen others have scrips to collect system logs at time of an incident when someone is having an issue but nothing that will collect user data for security reason automatically. Can anyone point me in the direction of a 3rd party product or script structure? \n\nA: You can use an automated central logging system, like Filebeat + ElasticSearch. The automated collection of logs you are referring to could be CMD+ALT+CONTROL+SHIFT+. which is a sysdiagnose command. It takes a long time to run and isn't generally considered a good idea to use as 'standard' log collection.\nUsing something that is actually made for collecting logs will help you out a whole lot better than a simple script.\nIf you wanted to go the script route anyway, you can create an applescript that collects to logs and copies it to a server. You can then make a Calendar appointment which has the option to add a script as an action. Another method would be using osascript from the commandline in combination with a crontab entry.\nA third more user-friendly option for situations where you don't have a proper server system where you can add these things is Apple Remote Desktop Administrator. You buy it from the App Store and then you can setup periodic jobs to gather logs. You will also be able to completely remotely manage all the Macs.\n", "Q: Restart download Mac OS X (macOS) Sierra, Developer Preview version My download of macOS Sierra (Developer Preview, see press release) began downloading, appearing in the Launchpad app. But then got interrupted.

Can I change the date and/or time of photos that are in the iOS camera roll?\nI've imported photos, but they now have the wrong date. How can I adjust these photos to appear in the correct temporal order in my camera roll and iOS iCloud Photos library?\n\nA: Yes, you can accomplish this by downloading third-party apps from the App Store.\nPixelgarde\nOne I've found very popular from my web searches is Pixelgarde. This app not only lets you edit the date and time of when your photo was taken, but also change or delete the location where it was taken in, the person who took it, and much more.\n\nAgain, this is the one I've found most popular in my web searches, but please feel free to pick up the one you most prefer!\nHope this helped you out, let me know !\n\nA: You can also adjust the date/time if you have access to the Photo app on a Mac computer that automatically syncs to the camera roll on your phone (assuming you are referring to photos on your phone).  Double-click on the photo, then click on the circled \"i\" next to the heart at the top right corner of the window.  Then, double-click on the date/time section in the window that pops up, and it should let you edit the information there.\n\nA: iOS 15 in 2021 adds a new Adjust Date & Time feature to the iOS Photos app.\n\n*\n\n*Scroll up on a photo\n\n*Press Adjust button\n\n*Adjust Date & Time via the calendar, date picker, and time zone selector.\n\niOS 15 is now capable of adjusting the Date and Time a photo was taken. This was previously only available in the macOS Photos app via Adjust Date and Time....\nYou can also press and hold the Date on photo, and then press and hold it on another - to Copy and Paste the Date & Time taken. (same works for location)\n\n\n\n\nA: Metadata Pro is also a good app to change photo date + a lot of other metadata.

I made new Apple ID successfully but for updates it ask old ID password . How to solve this problem?\n\nA: This is because each App on your phone is linked to an Apple ID. You can change your AppleID on your phone, but the app will still remembering the AppleID from was installed initially. I found similar behavior if you use a phone backup from other phone different than your own. \nThe only solution you have in this case is to unninstall each installed with the old AppleID and reinstall it again with your new AppleID.

These are called Suggested Apps and it's a feature of iOS.\niOS controls what app appears there based on several factors, including your location, the apps on your device, and your history of where & when you use those apps.  Together, iOS trys to present you with the app you would most-likely use at a given time, location, and history.\nIf you don't like this feature, it can be turned off in Settings -> General -> Handoff & Suggested Apps.\n", "Q: My iPhone says I need to do billing My iPhone is saying I need to do billing but there is not a none button by the credit cards what do I do I need to download a app for my cheerleading\n\nA: There is a good chance you have an unpaid balance from a previous transaction. This can happen for a number of reasons such as insufficient funds in your bank account.\nIf you have an unpaid transaction, iTunes requires you to add a valid payment method before you can continue using the iTunes Store/App Store. Even for free items.\nYou can see if you have any unpaid purchases by going into your 'Purchase History' (see example below) or contacting iTunes Support via email or phone.\n\nMore info: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT203005\n", "Q: iPad 3rd gen won't turn on just black screen I unplugged my iPad at 25% charge and used it. Suddenly my iPad froze at 19%.  I rebooted it by pressing both home and wake/sleep button. It was stuck on the booting-up screen so I decided to charge it. After plugging in my iPad for 30 minutes, I came back to check it but then it was turned off.\nAfter that, I turned on my iPad but after the apple logo appears, the screen goes black.  I tried turning it on again but it just repeats the cycle. I already connected my iPad to iTunes to the PC to recover and restore it but still it won't turn on; it just keeps showing the Apple logo then black screen again. \nWhat should I do? Does this need a reformat?\n\nA: Press and hold the Home button and power for 10 seconds. If this does not work, then hold down the home button and plug the charger into computer\n\nA: There are a couple of things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try doing a hard reset of your iPad.  Hold the sleep/wake and power buttons for 10 seconds until you get the Apple logo\n\n*Attempt \"Recovery Mode\".  With the iPad powered off, hold the home button and connect a USB cable from your Mac with iTunes.  Keep holding the home button until the Apple Logo appears\n\n\nKeep in mind, you will wipe your iPad and will have to do a restore.\n\nA: Restart your device which can fix software problem.\nFor iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: Press and hold Power button and Volume button at the same time for at least 10 seconds until you see the Apple logo appears on your device screen.\nFor other iOS devices: Press and hold the Power and Home button simultaneously for at least 10 seconds until you see the Apple logo.\nIf your iPhone screen is still black and not responsive, it is likely having trouble with its operating system. \n", "Q: Downloads and Updates still ask for old AppleID password I signed out from my old AppleID and it was removed from my iPhone.  However, the iPhone still asks for the old AppleID and password when downloading and updating apps. \nHow can I solve this?\n\nA: If an item is purchased with an Apple ID (even if it is a free item) it can only be updated using that same Apple ID.\nFor example, if you downloaded the Facebook app using the Apple ID \"foo@example.com\" and you now use the Apple ID \"bar@example.com\" then you must either update the app using \"foo@example.com\" or delete and re-download the app using \"bar@example.com\".\n", "Q: Driver issue with the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter I have a MacBook (2016) and the first time I plugged in my USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter it prompted me to install an update to the driver - I didn't complete the installation at that point.\nNow the (same) driver update prompt pops up every time I plugin the adapter - even though I've installed the update (multiple times).\n\nI suspect that the first (failed) install of the driver update have caused it to prompt on every plugin (?) - is there any way to break this \"loop\"?\n\nA: For those searching I am having this issue with a new 2016 MacBook Pro running sierra v10.12.1.  Multiple Install->Reboot cycles with everything still plugged in but the Multiport Update is not being installed.\n[RESOLVED]\nUPDATE: \nYour USB-C Power Cord must be plugged directly into your multiport adapter (which is plugged into your laptop) when doing the reboot.  Having the adapter plugged into one port, while the power cord is plugged into another of your laptop's ports will not work.\nNOTE 1: Working Layout\nWall power outlet => USB-C Power Adapter => USB-C Power Cord => Multiport Adapter => Laptop\n\n   (You don't need the external display plugged in.)\nNOTE 2: When I first plugged my power cord into the multiport adapter, it displayed some weird behavior where the Driver Install prompt went away and the \"charging\" icon would show briefly, then disappear.  I restarted my laptop with everything still plugged in and then the Driver Install prompt stayed visible.  \nYou could probably also click the \"Install\" button before pluggin in the power cord and once the wizard is open, plug in the power cord.  I'd guess the power cord is only required to be plugged into the multiport adapter to give the adapter power during the reboot.\nNOTE 3: The time that the install/reboot actually worked, the reboot took a significantly longer time than usual.  Probably about 3 mins.  So if you also experience that then its a good sign.\n\nA: The issue has (finally) been resolved!\nThe solution was to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually download the 10.11.5 (newest) OSX update from the Apple website and install it\n\n*Reboot the machine\n\n*Plug in the USB-C Multiport Adapter\n\n*Install the suggested update\n\n*Reboot\n\n\n(thanks to Gilby for suggesting the re-install of the update)\n\nA: Possible alternative solution:\nI had the same issue, kept receiving the same prompt. Each time I installed the update, I restarted the computer. Then one day I walked away after hitting \"restart\", so it just sat for 5-10min waiting for me to login to FileVault. Eventually the machine just turned off. When I returned and booted the system, no more prompt!\nThe (alternative) solution was to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the update as prompted\n\n*Restart the computer, but don't log back in\n\n*Let the log in screen time-out and the system turn itself off\n\n*Boot the computer back up and log-in as normal\n\n\nA: Just ran into this problem on a 2016 13\" Macbook Pro w/o touchbar.  I found a suggestion on Apple's forums to flip over the USB-C cable from the adapter to the laptop.  This made no sense, but I did it anyway while I looked for other answers.  I don't know why, but it worked.  I'm dumbfounded.\nI'm running OSX 10.12.2, no pending updates until I plugged the adapter in.  Failed to install the adapter update for three consecutive reboots.  No HDMI or USB plugged in, but with the power adapter connected.  Not sure if this will be helpful to others, but \n\nA: Just resolved this on a brand-new Macbook Pro. For this update you need to read the release note: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205858 - quote, bold type is mine:\n\n\n  \n*Plug your USB-C Multiport Adapter into the USB-C port on your Mac. Make sure that your USB-C Charge Cable is connected to your adapter and plugged into a power source using your USB-C Power Adapter.\n  \n*Disconnect all external devices (such as displays, thumb drives, and hard drives) and hard-wired network connections from your USB-C Multiport Adapter.\n  \n\nIf you do these two things it works.\n", "Q: Setting a durable pin-mark in maps by using Siri It's possible saying to Siri: \"Show me my current location\".

Typically you may not need this setting (and therefore avoid using -profile:v and -level), but if you do use this setting it may increase the bit rate quite a bit compared to what is needed to achieve the same quality in higher profiles.\nEncoding video using H.264 compression:\n\n\n*\n\n*H.264 Baseline 3.0: All devices\n\n*H.264 Baseline 3.1: iPhone 3G and later, and iPod touch 2nd generation and later.\n\n*H.264 Main profile 3.1: iPad (all versions), Apple TV 2 and later, and iPhone 4 and later.\n\n*H.264 Main Profile 4.0: Apple TV 3 and later, iPad 2 and later, and iPhone 4S and later\n\n*H.264 High Profile 4.0: Apple TV 3 and later, iPad 2 and later, and iPhone 4S and later.\n\n*H.264 High Profile 4.1: iPad 2 and later and iPhone 4S and later.\n\n\nA frame rate of 10 fps is recommended for video streams under 200 kbps.

Worked like a charm for me. \n\nA: Check your wireless connection. Erasing the disks erases the WiFi information on the drive (it's located in your keychain), so when it reboots, it simply looks for the nearest WiFi SSID it can find, which may not be the right one. Click on the WiFi icon in the upper right hand corner and choose the correct SSID, then feed it any credentials it asks for. When it has the correct WiFi, try again. \n\nA: I resolved this issue by changing the Wi-Fi network I was connected to. I was on xfinitywifi which was requiring a registration I didn't see. As soon as I connected to my internal company Wi-Fi network without a click-through screen it worked.\nOther avenues to resolve this are making a bootable installer, booting from recovery or otherwise connecting to a new network if that’s causing the issue (Ethernet instead of WiFi for instance)\n\nA: The only way out of this mess that I found was asking a friend to make me an installation USB, and use that to install the new OS.\nApple was not very clever with this, they could have made it possible to sign into the AppStore from the recovery screen as you obviously will reach it when you need to (re)install the OS...\n\nA: I had tried three times through the internet installation. First attempt I spent three hours. My second attempt was five hours and the final attempt I wasn’t sure because I had left my notebook at home. \n\nA: Just keep trying. It took me 10 times before it finally went through. No USB needed, just bad connection to the Apple server!\n\nA: Simply click the WiFi logo (top right) and select Join Other Network.

Fan issues, power issues, or spontaneous program unresponsiveness can occur if SMC is having problems.\nNVRAM (Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory, or PRAM in older Macs) stores system settings that the Mac needs to access quickly. Resetting it doesn't always fix anything you are describing above, but it also never hurts to try it as part of your troubleshooting.\nIf you have a bad memory module, you'll get weird crashes and system hangs. If you have multiple chips installed (e.g. two 8 GB modules) try removing one, then if no issues, switch and run the system with the other chip for a while. Possible that only one of the two is bad.\nIf your hard drive is bad, you'll get periodic problems and unpredictable behavior. Unfortunately, a bad hard drive can also mean lost user data... so hopefully you have backups if your drive turns out to be the problem.\n(*For those with newer Macs - swapping out memory or hard drives is obviously not a possibility if they're soldered to the system board.)\n", "Q: Keynote 6.6.2, iMac, OS El Capitan: How do I export Keynote presentation to quicktime without the voice over?

The answer was:\nRemove the voice narration when exporting to quicktime.\nHowever, there doesn't seem to be that option in the latest version of Keynote.\nDoes anyone know the answer to this?\nLet me know if you need a screenshot or screencast for further clarification.\nThanks.\n\nA: I have two solutions, the first one is to export to QuickTime with the audio and then remove the audio the secondary is to first remove the audio then export to QuickTime.\nSolution 1 \nFirst export to QuickTime \nOpen iMovie and create a new movie project (you can remove the new project later)\nDrag and drop the video file to the large grey section at the bottom\nRight click and click Detach audio\nRight click on the new green bar below and click Delete (all audio has been removed)\nTo export, Click File->Share->File and click next and save it where you will find it.\nNote, this solution removes all the audio.

To remove them you have to look thru all the slides and remove them one by one. Click on it then press backspace to remove it.\n", "Q: Iphone 5s unlock to make all providers available I have seen that there has been a lot of questions asking how to unlock, but no question had an answer I was satisfied with. I want to unlock my phone at home using my Windows and/or ubuntu pc. How should I proceed? I have done this on my android devices but I am new to apple products, all google searches just tells me to pay my provider...\n\nA: If your iPhone was purchased on a contract, you must contact your provider for them to release your iPhone from their network lock. This is generally put in place to ensure users on a contract do not switch carriers after paying only one or so instalment for the phone.\nIf you have finished your contract, purchased the phone outright, or come to an agreement with your carrier to unlock your device you'll need to backup (if needed) and restore your device through iTunes to apply the new unlocked carrier settings. You can contact Apple to see if your device will be unlocked after restoring if you're not sure.\nThere may be other ways around this unlocking process, however none are official or supported by Apple. Nor are they guaranteed to work.\n", "Q: How can I delete Time Machine backups, moved into trash? I was going to delete the Time Machine backups. I made a mistake and instead of deleting them using Time Machine, I just moved the Backups.backupdb folder to the trash. Now, if I try to empty the trash, Finder attempts to count the number of files that will be deleted, and this process is incredibly time-consuming, because the Finder tries to count each file in each backup. The same thing happens if I try to move the Backups.backupdb folder from the trash back on my hard drive where it was before.\nWhat can I do in this situation? How can I delete the backups?\n\nA: To remove or move the Backups.backupdb folder open Terminal.app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter cd /Volumes/<Name_of_BackupDrive>/.Trashes to change the working directory. <Name_of_BackupDrive> has to be the volume name of your TM backup volume.\n\n*Enter sudo ls -laO to show all folders. Usually you should see only one folder with  the name 501 now:\nd-wx-wx-wt@ 3 root      wheel  hidden 102 Jun 25 20:52 .\ndrwxrwxr-x  9 root      admin  -      374 Jun 26 01:21 ..\ndrwx------@ 2 user      staff  hidden  68 Jun 26 01:21 501\n\n\n*Enter sudo su to get super user rights.\n\n*Enter cd 501 (Replace 501 with whatever the name of the directory is) to change the working directory and list the content of the folder 501 with ls -laO. Now you should see the folder Backups.backupdb:\ndrwx------@ 3 user      staff  hidden 102 Jun 26 01:21 .\nd-wx-wx-wt@ 3 root      wheel  hidden 102 Jun 25 20:52 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 user      admin  -       68 Jun 26 01:19 Backups.backupdb\n\n\n*Now you may either move the folder back to the root of the backup drive with: \nmv Backups.backupdb /Volumes/<Name_of_BackupDrive>/\n\nor remove the folder with \nrm -dR Backups.backupdb\n\nIf you are asked to override something (e.g. override rw-r--r--  root/wheel uchg for Backups.backupdb/.RecoverySets/0/com.apple.recovery.boot/boot.efi?) enter yes and hit the return button. You may also add the -f option to skip confirmations.\n\nTo delete a 30 GB backup in a virtual machine it took about 3 minutes. So depending on the size of Backups.backupdb some patience is needed.\n\nA: You can also try to delete the trash with help of the free program Onyx: http://www.titanium.free.fr/onyx.html You open the program and gå to \"clean\", then to \"Trash\" and then click on \"delete\". The program will delete the content in the Trash for all connected volumes (for example Time Machine).\n\nA: First off, thank you so much for the help! I just wanted to include a few steps that were different for my setup- just in case it can help someone else.\nI was using a WD external backup drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the root folder, where you can get to the Volumes directory:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd ../.. \n\n\n*Change to the volumes directory: \n\n\n*\n\n*cd Volumes/My\\ Passport  \n\n\n*View all folders: \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo ls -laO\n\n\n*Get super user rights:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo su\n5 Look for the .Trashes directory and change into it.\n\n*Each director is listed at the end of each line. \n\n*cd .Trashes\n\n\n*List the contents of the .Trashes directory:\n\n\n*\n\n*ls -laO\n\n\n*Look for a 501 folder and remove it:\n\n\n*\n\n*rm -dR 501\n\n\n", "Q: iCloud Storage - No photos or videos but still shows as full I have iPhone 6....and standard iCloud storage of 5GB.

How can I free the memory? Is IOS using the storage?\nThank you\n\nA: Use the Manage Storage feature to check what is using the majority of your storage. It is quite common for app data to be using a large amount of storage which can be easily missed.\nAlso update your device if there is an update available as it may have been downloaded to your device but not installed and can take up around ~2GB.\nKeep in mind too, that iOS, when installed generally takes up about 3GB - 5GB of storage and that the actual formatted capacity of devices is usually a bit less.\n", "Q: GNU screen updating or reinstalling Is there a way of updating GNU screen for Mac OS X 10.11.5? \nMy current screen version is 4.00.03 and would like to use the features such as layout which does not seem to be available for me.\nIf not, can I uninstall this version of GNU screen and install it from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/screen/ ?\n\nA: You could install brew and use it to install a more recent version with the command brew install screen. That will currently install version 4.3.1, which (as of writing) is almost the latest release (a new release of screen came out less than a week ago and isn't in brew yet). You will then be able to run it from /usr/local/bin/screen. You can create an alias to simplify that.\nYou could remove the installed version, but it could be silently replaced by Apple at some point when you install an update. And it's always a good idea to avoid making changes in the /usr/bin directory unless absolutely necessary.\nYou could install directly from the source, but that version might not include OS X specific patches. The brew Formula for screen does include at least one specific OS X patch.\n", "Q: MacBook Air Mid 2013 Wi-Fi MAC Address If I change my network interface card on my MacBook Air 2013, which I assume to be my AirPort/Bluetooth card, will it change my laptop's MAC Address? \n\nA: Yes, that is correct; it will change.\nYour MAC (Media Access Control) address is assigned to network interfaces, not to the computer.  For example, on this WiFi adapter from a Macbook Pro, you can see the MAC address imprinted on the chip (circled in red)\n\nYou can even lookup the manufacturer of the WiFi adapter by entering the first six characters into a lookup tool like this one.

It's my wife's, and her previous phone didn't have LTE, so neither of us noticed right away that even in areas AT&T has good LTE service, her phone never registers an LTE connection. Only 4G.\nUpdate:\nWhen a SIM card from a phone with working LTE is inserted into this iPhone 5S, the service indicator shows LTE. I suppose I need to contact AT&T then?\nBy all appearances the phone had never been used (original packaging, pristine accessories,OEM screen protector wrap still on). What would cause a phone to function normally all ways, but not register an LTE connection? \nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*toggling LTE off/on in Cellular Settings. \n\n*checking for carrier updates\n\n*resetting network settings\n\n\nA: I assume you should try to test the SIM with another phone in order to see if it really works.\nTest\nAll you have to do is pretty simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get your SIM ejector and take it off from your current iPhone\n\n*Get another iPhone and put it in\n\n*Unlock the SIM on the new iPhone and make sure LTE is activated properly under Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options\nOnce done this, I'd definitely try to contact your carrier's support (which if I'm not wrong is AT&T in your case) and report them the result of the test and see how they can help you.\nHope this helped you out, and don't forget to let me up to date on the question!\n\nA: As far as I know it is two different things, which means it can only show 1, not according to your phone, but according to your network. You won't see LTE or 4G if your service provider doesn't support it. Eg, your wife is Verizon and it shows LTE and you are AT&T and it shows 4G.\nMy situation: In Dubai I have LTE and my phone shows LTE labels instead of 4G, but when I swop sims to go back to South Africa it all changes to 4G with 4G labels. And both countries have both LTE and 4G. So to me, it depends on your service provider, although I have never been to USA so I'm not familiar with your networks but this is my experience.\n", "Q: Is it possible to mirror emojis on an iPhone I would like to use a mirrored emoji() in an imessage  - is that possible?\n(I am interested in both mirrored, flipped and rotated emojis)\nI have tried to use http://fliptext.net but is does not support emojis. I have tried to take a screenshot, and crop it to only the emoji(and rotate it), but for some reason it also gets stretched. What is the resolution of original emojis? -maybe a mirrored emoji can be prepared on a computer and transferred to the phone?\nEdit : I would like the new emoji-picture to look just as nice as the original(resolution, antialiasing and size) - I have had no luck achieving this.\n\nA: As mirrored emoji are not actual Unicode characters, the only way to accomplish this would be to edit an image with an emoji in Preview or another editing program. The directions provided are for preview.app on any mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Preview\n\n*Open any image that is just a plain transparent background, like this\n\n*Open the markup  toolbox\n\n*Add a new text box, and insert the emoji. You can type emoji using Edit > Emoji & Symbols, or the touchbar on a new MacBook Pro.\n\n*Now, click Tools > Flip Horizontal\n\n*Save your image. Now you've made a flipped emoji that you can place anywhere you want.\n\n\nHere's your reversed megaphone, too:  imgur link\n", "Q: Why do my iPhone playlists not show up under \"My Device\" on Mac computer? When I manually connect my iPhone to my Mac Pro, click on My Device, it does not show my  iPhone playlists.

I just made a playlist called Test for this answer, see below:\n\nUpdate: New iTunes have iCloud Music Library, check if it works when you enable it:\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro turned off and won't turn on! I was just using my laptop normally when suddenly the whole computer just shut down. I turned it back on straight away and it was fine. Another hour passed and it did the same thing. I could also turn it on again. And then it happened again, this time I couldn't turn it back on!! I have never spilt any liquid over my laptop so it isn't liquid damage. I have tried resetting SMC, replugging the battery cable inside the computer, leaving the charger disconnected from the mac for a few hours, nothing works! The strange thing is when I have my charger disconnected and I press the little button on the side to show power, nothing happens. But when I do the same with the charger connected it shows full battery.\n \nI have a MacBook Pro 15\" Early 2011 running OSX El Capitan.\n\nA: Your Mac should still be able to turn on with a dead battery.  As long as charger is functioning properly, it's more than enough to both power up and charge your Mac.\nYou have three possibilities for the cause of this:\nMagSafe Board (highest probability).  This board is known to go bad and when it fails, it presents symptoms similar to what you are describing.  The good news is that this component is very inexpensive ($10-$15).  \n\nYou said in your post you had opened it up and disconnected/reconnected your battery so it sounds like you have the tech skills to do this repair.\nYour Charger (medium probability).  This is the easiest test to do.  I once  took in a MacBook Air into Best Buy and hooked it up to a charger they had connected to one of their display models to verify that the charger wasn't the problem. It may or may not be the charger, but there's no need to spend $60 - $100 just to test it out.  if your computer comes to life after plugging in another charger, you have your answer.\nYour Logic Board.  (least probability).  This is obviously the most expensive, but most of the time, it's not the issue.  The only way to diagnose this is at the component level.  If you have exhausted the first two possibilities, it's time to send it in for a professional diagnosis.\n\nA: The battery appears to be dead or damaged. I would go to an Apple Store to have it replaced. But It is still strange that even with the power cable connected it does not turn on. \nAnother test you could do is resetting the PRAM by holding Command + Option + P + R and turning on the MacBook\n\nA: Even if your battery is dead, your computer should still switch on, see this article for more details.\nMight be power cables inside your laptop. You can test with voltage meters, if you don't know how it works, you can always go to an electrician or just take it into a computer shop or even Apple.\n\nA: Here are the troubleshooting steps recommended by Apple: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204267\nThese are the steps I personally would take to diagnose this issue and resolve it:\n1: attempt to reset the SMC: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201295\n2: try a different charger, also attempt the first step again\n3: this step and all that follow require tools and technical knowledge and understanding. If you don't have both, don't try it. The damage you can cause your machine or yourself isn't worth the trip to an Apple Autherised Service Provider or store. \nDisassemble the machine and inspect it for liquid damage, or burn components\nDisconnect the battery - the method to do so will vary from model to model.\nIdeally you'd want to try also replacing the battery with a known good working battery but it's unlike you have a spare.\n4: Reseat the AC MagSafe / I/O board connect/s to the logic board. Also reseat the screws for the board to ensure its not shorting out. Again it would be worth swapping this part for a known good working part but again probably not something everyone has on hand\n5: remove the logic board, I/O or MagSafe board and the fan/s. Find the power on pads and bridge them to \"hot wire\" start them (with the charger connected). This removes all the other possible components that could be causing an issue. If the fan spins up it means the machine is shorting out with one of the other components - enjoy finding out which one it is.\n6: if you've made it to here you probably have a faulty logic board. With Apple gear its generally cheaper to just buy a new machine at this point\n", "Q: When locking screen on OS X Chrome cancels downloads When I lock my screen using cmdalteject while Chrome is downloading, the download is canceled. I get back to my computer and see that download is not active. I also noticed that video streams I'm watching (such as live TV) also stop.\nMy question is, can I change this behaviour? When the download is big I cannot lock my computer for long time and I feel my computer is compromised when I leave it.\nIs it OS X issue or Chrome?\nI have MacBook Pro (13 inch, mid 2012) with El Capitan.\n\nA: Instead of cmd+alt+eject, use the Login Window instead as this does not interrupt your download or streaming.\nTo use Login Window, go to:\nSystem Preferences -> Users > Login Options > Show fast user switching menu as 'Icon'\nYou will see a \"user icon\" top right bar left of Spotlight icon.

No need for multiple adapters. Alas, this does not support the 30\" Cinema Display, according to the product page:\n\n\"The USB-C to DVI adapter will not work with Apple Cinema Displays or the Dell 3007WFP. These monitors require a true DVI-D signal. Please\n  note this before purchasing\"\n\nhttps://www.pimfg.com/product-detail/USB31C-DVIF-1\n\nA: Here's a single adapter solution (USB-C to dual-link DVI) that IS working on my 16\" MacBook Pro and my 30\" Apple Cinema Display:\nhttps://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QKM856C\nClub 3D CAC-1510 USB Type C to DVI-D Dual Link Active Adapter, 3840 X 2160 @ 30Hz, 2560 X 1600P @ 60Hz, Deep Color 12 Bit \nThe adapter is plugged into one of the MBPs four USB-C ports, and of course the Cinema Display's DVI plug is plugged into the adapter. There's no need to connect the ACD's USB-A cable (unless you want to use its USB ports as a hub).\nAfter normal timeout sleep of the Mac, it takes about 6 seconds for the ACD to show the screen, noticeably longer than when I had it connected through the Apple TB2 adapter to my old iMac.\nSystem Preferences seems to think the ACD's native reso is 1280 x 800, but option-click on ()Scaled brings up the 2560 x 1600 option, which works fine. I'm definitely getting 2560 x 1600 (although everything seems huge now compared to the MBP 16 built-in display, even when I knock its reso down to \"looks like 1536 x 960\").\nAside: a small downside compared to my iMac is that plugging anything into the MBP's right-hand USB-C ports puts the cables in front of my ADC screen. \nI previously tried the Accell Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter like the one Andreas used, into an Other World Computing Dock display port, which lit the ADCs backlight and it showed up in System Preferences, but no picture at all. I returned the Accell--I'm not sure if it really didn't work or I would have needed one of the other adapters above. The OWC USB-C Dock is otherwise working great, although I picked it knowing it didn't have full power to charge the 16\" MPB. It was OWC support that suggested there would be a USB-C/DVI adapter now.\nUpdate 9 Jan 2020: After a few weeks with no problems, the Mac frequently wakes up in a mode where the built-in display flashes on and off and the ACD shows nothing. Can't say whether the Club adapter is causing this but it doesn't happen when not connected. Rebooting allowed me to reconnect successfully.\n\nA: After trying at least 9 different adapters, I finally found one that worked! USB-C to MiniDisplayPort: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CJHHTR8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nYou'll also need a USB to USB-C if you want to use your Cinema as a USB hub as I did. As far as I can see, there are no USB+DVI to USB-C adapters except this one:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MD0XXMI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nIt works, but only up to 1280 x 800.\n\nA: After weeks of trial and error, I have finally achieved 2560x1600 resolution on my Apple 30-inch Cinema Display connected to my MacBook Pro,15-inch, 2016 laptop.\nThe trick is to go from USB-C to Mini Display Port (MDP), then to dual-link DVI. Unfortunately, this does take two adapters, but at least the full monitor's resolution is supported.\nI used the following adapters:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB Type C Adapter (Amazon Link)\n\n*Dual-link DVI adapter (Monoprice Link)\nAlso to note, the DVI adapter needs to be powered by the attached USB connector, and the monitor break out cable USB also needs to be attached to the MacBook.\nA bit of a cabling challenge, but everything is now working 100%.\nAndreas came up with a substantially similar solution, but with different brands and gets the answer bonus!\n\nA: I found a single adapter that worked.\nThe Club 3D CAC-1510-A drives my 30-inch Cinema Display from my 2019 MacBook Pro 16-inch.\nNote that there is a very similar model, the CAC-1510 that does NOT work.  The one that works has \"-A\" at the end of the model number.\nThe difference (according to Club 3D):\n\n*\n\n*CAC-1510-A has HDCP turned off\n\n*CAC-1510 has HDCP turned on\n\nThey offer a firmware utility that can turn HDCP on or off, so in theory you can get either model.  But the firmware utility only runs in Windows!  Also, you have to contact their support to get the firmware utility.  There's no link on their website to download it.\nI've been moving it back and forth between my personal Mac and my work Mac, and after about 16 months, it has become flaky.  It came with a 24-month warranty, and I've just sent a request to get it replaced under the warranty.\nI note that Amazon sells several models that seem to be the exact same device as my Club3D, and they all explicitly claim to support the Cinema Display:\n\n*\n\n*CableCreation CD0720\n\n*Yogi.dog UTC-DDL-AL\n\n*StarTech.com CDP2DVIDP\n\nAlso note: If you want to use the USB ports on the back of your Cinema display, you'll also need a USB-A to USB-C adapter.\n\nA: You need to find a USB-C to dual-link DVI adapter.  The first hit on Google, for example, is this:  StarTech USB-C to DVI Adapter CDP2DVI\nNote: This is not dual link DVI and will not support the full resolution of an Apple 30” display.\n\nA: You'll need a USB-C to DVI adapter to connect the 30\" Apple Cinema Display to your USB-C Macbook. This $22 one, by Cable Matters, supports resolutions of up to 2560x1600 (the same as your monitor) and works with Thunderbolt 3 and the new 2016 MBP.\nI'm sure a commenter will be quick to point out that it's not a dual-link DVI adapter, but it doesn't have to be: it allows all 2560x1600 resolution through its single link (well enough, in fact, to trick most reviewers into thinking it's dual-link). It will still push 2K resolution to your Cinema Display.\n\nEdit: If you don't have a DVI-to-DVI cable (which you'll need to connect the monitor to the adapter), I recommend this gold-plated one.\n\nA: Note that the small/cheap Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter will NOT work to convert a Mini DisplayPort signal to USB-C, despite using the same port design.\nIt is incompatible with the 30\" Cinema Display and other non-Thunderbolt DisplayPort monitors.\nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT207266\n\nThis adapter is not compatible with displays that use DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort, such as the Apple LED Cinema Display. Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2 are not the same as Mini DisplayPort , though the ports have the same shape.\nNote that although it uses a Mini DisplayPort connector, the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter doesn’t support connections to Mini DisplayPort displays.\nThe Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter doesn’t support connections to these devices:\n-Apple DisplayPort display\n-DisplayPort devices or accessories, such as Mini DisplayPort to HDMI or Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapters\n\n\nA: I believe there's current no way of doing this :(\nNew Solution! January 2020: I have the 30\" Cinema Display connected to new a new MacBook Pro 16\" at full resolution and all controls can be accessed. This requires the Apple DisplayPort to dual-link DVI adapter and this thunderbolt 3 to DisplayPort/Thunderbolt 2 adapter that has full support for video up to 4K @60hz. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017TZTMBG?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share\nThis $20 adapter seems to recreate a fully functional Thunderbolt 2 port like the older MacBook Pro's had. The Apple Thunderbolt 2 to DVI adapter must have it's USB cable plugged in to power its conversion electronics. If it doesn't immediately sense the Cinema Display unplug the power cord from the small cord from the Cinema Display power supply, wait a few seconds then pug it back in. Mine worked perfectly after that. It is instant sleep and instant on.\n\nA: You can try buying a USB-C to DVI Adapter.

But here it is:\nhttps://superuser.com/a/371939 \nIf this worked for you, let us know what you did, in a better way please! :)\n", "Q: How to sort photos inside a photo album in the Photos app on an iPhone by date [PC]? By default the photos in user-created albums are sorted by date added, NOT date taken. The user may rearrange the photos one-by-one (tap and hold).\nI do NOT own a Mac.\n\nA: I have had the same question for years. Unfortunately, iOS uses Date Added and not Date Taken from EXIF for sorting. They even added Collections but Camera Roll sorting is still broken.\nTo sort the photos you could use one of the methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Jailbreak. A number of tweaks allow organising photos one by one or sorting by name/date. You would also be able to edit each photo's metadata on device.  \n\n*Sync them as an album from a computer. First, organise them by copying or otherwise modifying the date metadata, then sync the resulting folder through iTunes. This is limited to the synced album and will not fix the camera roll.   \n\n*Direct import and Photos.sqlite rebuild. Having spent another year on this and currently in the process of moving my 5 year camera roll to a new device, the method I plan to use: same as above, prepare metadata on a computer (set every possible date field correctly, e.g. with Attribute Changer). Import photos into DCIM. Delete/rebuild Photos.sqlite. Delete DCIM.plist, or set it manually for iOS to know how to name photos when you take them.   \n\n*Make changes to Photos.sqlite. This should work unless Apple modifies databases. This is sort of the best option available without resorting to mass EXIF editing/renaming, and will only work/make sense if underlying EXIF/file attributes in your photos is correct. If you can see metadata is wrong, this is useless. Details are here.\nN.B: double check dates on PNGs/videQuickTime files and their exif is tricky).   \nFurther investigation confirms this appears to work on iOS 11. Only points to note on later iOSs: clear out iCloud Photo Library folders CLOUD folders in DCIM, or just turn it off), and also delete the Mutations folder in PhotoData (holds edits AFAIK, if any have the same name as the new import you'll have weird conflicts).   \nAlso, the way iOS generates ZDATEADDED appears to be dependent on indexing order and hence naming of the files.   \nSo if you want the Camera Roll to be ordered correctly (without having to resort to SQL commands on the db) by EXIF/file data, you'd need to bulk rename pre-sorted (by date field of your choice) files in order, and then import. The easiest attribute to pre-sort by is Date Modified since all files will have it and it generally remains the same through all the manipulations described above. Obviously, you'd want/need to use something like Attribute Changer (Win) or Better Find Attributes (macOS) to first synchronise EXIF and file attributes.\n\nA: I never thought about that, but it seems like this is not possible at the moment, take a look at this Apple Forum's question answered, this may help you understand more about how photos work on the iPhone and where you can contact Apple to leave a feedback about what you've just asked here, give it a try!\n", "Q: less doesn't work Recently I've noticed that less command doesn't work.\n$ ls | less                                                        \nCertificateEntreprenuership101.pdf\nEngineering Software as a Service_ An Agile Approach Using Cloud Computing_B00CCEHNUM copy.azw3\nPhotos.zip\nRaspberry_Pi_Education_Manual.pdf\nchef-v100\nchef-v100.zip\nnode-webkit\npostgresql-v400 2\npostgresql-v400.zip\nrd1_ua\nrd1_ua.zip\n\nAs you can see it didn't open less as viewer.

I've noticed that several apps on the iOS App Store offer two purchasing options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Free app, then an in-app purchase of $x to the full version\n\n*The full version of the app for an immediate purchase of $x\n\n\n(Infuse is one such example)\nGiven that both purchasing methods get you exactly the same thing (that is, a working full version of the app) why would a developer go to the additional effort to make available both #1 and #2, rather than just have #1 in the App Store?\nPlease note\nI'm looking for fact-based and not opinion-based answers. For example, a fact-based answer is that if you use Family Sharing then IAPs are not supported.\n\nA: I followed up with a couple of developers of such apps that provide these two purchasing options.\nIt turns out that the sole reason that a second standalone purchasing option is offered (rather than just sticking with a single app with an IAP) is for those people who use Family Sharing. \nAs I alluded to in my question, IAPs don't work across Family Sharing so purchases that way wouldn't be reflected across all the devices you share. \nIf Apple didn't have this restriction, then a single free app with IAP would work for everybody - however because they do, then it doesn't. \n\nA: In App-Purchases\nThis option is particularly useful for long-term use:\nthe App itself is free, this makes it easy to spread to as many users as possible. But then, in the majority of this type of Apps, there are ads implemented which make a huge profit to the developer based on how many users watch them, and as said in then point before, the App is free and this allow users to get it very easily.\nThus, people tend to make IAPs because they usually allow them to get useful stuff in the App (like in a Game) which will grant them many advantages respect the normal free users of the App.\nPaid Apps\nIn this case, I think the App Store has points in advantage as people tend to spend money more than in other platforms. Thus, paid apps, tend to appear more premium, and as they cost money they are extremely well designed and cured in any tiny details in order to make that little price be worth.\n\nSummary\nIn App-Purchases are great to earn when you're probably a beginner and need money but need customers, this way you can spread your Apps and get rewarded!\nPaid Apps instead are a great way to serve great products to customers in return of money. People usually love such Apps 'cause they are \"Pay once and Play\" and thus they have no boring ads.\n\nA: Paid version of an app lets a business or organization pay for many copies one time. That way dozens or hundreds or thousands of employees don't need to handle expense reports or associate credit cards. This is especially important in school settings where pupils might never be expected to have payment for a school owned device. \nAlso paid apps work better for MDM and VPP programs to manage all the licenses programatically. \n\nA: I am always willing to pay a little more up front to avoid advertising. I absolutely hate having ads shoveled at me. Formerly free apps that start feeding me ads long after purchase (looking at you, Weather Channel app) really annoy me. It's up to you. For me, a little money out of pocket to support an ad-free experience from the outset is worth it.\n", "Q: How to Import photo from screensaver Mac I have transferred a photo from camera to the Mac and it is  stored in screen saver.

This piece of advice is old but is coming back into fashion. I have seen it a lot recently, on a number of Mac websites or forums. \"Your ‘everyday’ user account should not be an admin account. It should be a standard account created for this purpose, and you should log to the admin account only to perform actual admin tasks. »\nThis seems to be common advice in the Windows world, but for an up-to-date OS X system, I just cannot understand what kind of benefits it brings. Let’s dig into it:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X admin accounts are not root accounts. Any app wanting to go root will ask for your password anyway, so I see no additional security layer here. Try to put /var into the Trash.\n\n*Deep OS modification or code injection into most critical files has been prevented by SIP from El Capitan, whether your are admin, root or nobody. What’s more, in sensitive places where they are still allowed, such modifications would require a root password at the very least, even from an admin account, bringing us back to the first argument.\n\n*For spyware, privacy concerns and this kind of stuff, using standard accounts provides little additional protection, if any. As far as I know, even when used from a standard account, apps have full access to the user’s personal files and have full network access (minus any firewall, etc.). If a bad app wants to send home your docs, it can perfectly do so from a standard account.\n\n*Basic lines of defense (firewall, running trusted apps, and so on) are system wide.\n\n*On the other hand, it is a pain to switch to your admin account, then switch back to your standard account, back and forth. This may actually end up with the user delaying updates or admin maintenance, just to save time and postpone dealing with the hassle.\n\n\nSo, why not use an admin account? I hope this won’t be marked as duplicate, other questions related to this issue didn't address these arguments.\nEdit: the question applies to a computer that you own and control.\n\nA: Security is best implemented as a Multi Layered, Multi Vectored Strategy.\nThe Principle of Least Privilege (POLP) is just another cog in the machine that keeps your computer secure.\nEverything that you listed there are all good but none of that will prevent someone from taking over your computer with an exploit such as the Dropped Drive Hack.\n\n*\n\n*How does a firewall prevent a user from inserting a USB with an remote control exploit embedded on the drive?\n\n\n*How does SIP prevent a keylogger from capturing your keystrokes?\n\n\n*How does having SIP even matter when it can be easily disabled by the Admin?\n\n\n*How do you prevent unauthorized/illegally licensed software from being installed?  A restricted user account will ensure that users who shouldn't be installing software aren't installing software.\nYour last line of defence is using an account that is not an Admin account so that you can mitigate the threat by putting up another layer of security (user authentication) when a piece of malware tries to install itself.\nI have been saying this for what seems eons now:\n\"Security\" is not a product you buy or a switch you flip on; it's a practice, it's a mindset, to leverage all the tools you can to minimize your risk.\n\nA: There is only one root account on every OS X computer and it is disabled by default. It doesn't have a password and you can't login as root unless you specifically use Directory Utility and enable it. It's dangerous, because when logged in as root the system bypasses all authorization - it doesn't even ask for a password. In that aspect, an OS X computer is indeed rootless, which is A Good Thing™.\nAdmins accounts are simply standard accounts that also happen to be in the admin group. Any action in OS X performed by a logged-in user is checked against the authorization database (you can see its rules in /System/Library/Security/authorization.plist to see whether no authentication is required or is it enough to be authenticated as the session owner (standard user that is logged in), or must you be a member of the admin group. It gives very fine-grained control. So three possibilities might occur, for example in System Preferences when clicking the locked padlock. Upon clicking, it may simply unlock without authentication, it may offer authentication dialog with account name already put in (which means please confirm it's you) or may offer authentication dialog with account name and password fields blank (which means you are not admin, please call an admin to type his credentials in).\nA rule of thumb is that anything that can affect other users on the computer (system-wide change) will require administrative authentication. But it's more complex than that. Standard users, for example, can install apps from the Mac App Store in the /Applications folder (which is a system-wide change) but cannot bypass GateKeeper to run unsigned applications even if only within their own data.\nStandard users cannot invoke sudo which has a bad side-effect of not requiring authentication in a 10-15 minutes window after that. A cleverly designed script will ask you for an admin authentication for something you approve of, but after that it will do all sorts of wacky stuff you know nothing about.\nStandard users can also be managed via parental controls or configuration profiles and can have password policies enforced. Admin users can do no such thing.\nSystem Integrity Protection addresses the fact that people have been clicking thru installer packages and providing passwords so easily that the users have become the weakest link. SIP just tries to keep the system afloat, nothing else (and sometimes fails in that, too).\nYou would not believe how many people I've seen that have only one user on the computer (which is also admin account) and even without an account password, just to perceive a slight decrease in annoyance in form of a login window activity.\nI can't agree with your opinion that it is a pain to switch to an admin account when necessary. If you are in Terminal, you only need to su myadminacct before doing anything, including sudo or launching Finder as another user by executing /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder.\nIn GUI, well, Mac App Store updates (including OS X updates) do not require admin authentication. Those installer packages that end up in Downloads folder, including Adobe Flash updates, yes, you should be very careful before opening those doing the extra work and making triple sure they come from the right place and are not full of nasties.\nThat's why I think using a Mac with a standard account is better and more secure than with an admin, because it protects me from my own mistakes and oversights. Even the majority of knowledgeable users don't inspect every downloaded script line-by-line to see if there is anything fishy going on.\nI hope that the controls could get even stricter in the future, for example introducing conditions or schedules when an app (or script or any executable) can be run or have access to the network or that an executable may not even be started if I didn't explicitly allowed it (authentication dialog) within last month or so.\n\nA: It is generally considered best practice to use an account that has no more privileges than are required. What this means generally is that you should use an account that has the lowest privilege level possible, and elevate your privileges when it is needed for a specific task that requires the higher privileges.\nHowever, this gets annoying rather quickly. The reason for this is that what seems like a simple task to you or me (\"I only wanted to turn on the WiFi\") is seen as a privileged operation for the OS (\"You want to enable a network device and allow the machine to be put onto some random network\").\nStriking a balance between convenience and security is much harder than it sounds, and my personal feeling is that OS X does a much better job of it than some other OSen out there such as Windows.\nIf you do run as an administrator all the time, you might accidentally click on an email that contains some link to a site containing crapware, and it automatically runs a script that does some reconfiguration without your knowledge. But if you are running as a non-privileged user, then as soon as that script is run the OS will pop up a dialog saying \"this malicious script wants to do something to your computer. Please confirm by typing your password\". This would usually cause alarm or surprise, if it is not something you would expect to see at that point.\nAlso - more importantly, you set up a computer for someone else. Someone not computer-literate in your family. It is an excellent idea to give them a non-privileged login, and keep the admin password for yourself, so next time they click on any old rubbish (as is their wont), they CAN NOT infest the computer with crapware. They sometimes complain when you do this, but you only have to remind them of that time they had 35 toolbars installed on IE 6, and every time they did a google search they got pages of pornographc popups, before they will grudgingly agree that it might be a good idea. The downside is that they will be calling you more often to get you to unlock their computer when they want to update the Flash plugin.\nAs said before: security is an attitude, not a simple switch that you can flip.\n\nA: Let me see how your reasons would work or not:\n\n\n*\n\n*Admin accounts are not root. While true, they may be able to call sudo and perhaps they may even have the password ready for input (or sudo was configured not to ask for password).\n\n*SIP (System Integrity Protection): This is only one layer which is not enough for all attacks. Can be disabled? Even better!\n\n*Spyware argument: Well, perhaps. Privileges are still not separate enough. But even so, it's still a limitation.\n\n*Basic lines of defense are system wide: #1 says apps running on admin accounts can gain root.\n\n*Switching? It's widely known that you can do admin related tasks from  standard accounts as long as you enter the admin account password. No need to actually do a real switch of accounts.\n\nA: If you have other family members who are not computer savvy, or you want to restrict their access (eg children), or you are an employer who wants to restrict access to employees who may use the machine, \nthen absolutely yes; there are still reasons to have non-admin accounts in osx for daily use.\nIf you own a computer and want to control it, use an administrative account. \nIf you don't want other users to be able to \"administer\" anything, then non-admin accounts are very helpful. Also you never know when you may need to lend the machine off the cuff given a moment when someone asks \"hey could I just borrow your mac to do something really quickly?\", it gives peace of mind to be able to log out and log them into what some may regard as a 'semi-guest' account you have created and tailored permissions for.\n\nA: There are probably other reasons, but here's mine: it is not possible to place restrictions on the admin account. It is useful to have restrictions in place to prevent oneself from visiting undesirable or dangerous sites.\n\nA: \nNOTE: This answer was \"in progress\" when this question was closed. I am posting it here instead.\n\nAnswer:\nYour question may be asking for opinions, and it's also similar to this question. I've heard both sides of the argument, and both sides arguments are at least partially subjective. I've not heard a definitive, one-size-fits-all argument for or against it. My conclusion (and my answer) therefore is that it boils down to a matter of personal preference, and individual use case.\nOn one hand, some of our Macs are single-user machines, and separation of privileges may seem pointless. On the other hand, and speaking only for myself, I rather like the idea of the system \"challenging\" my decisions because it gives me a chance to think again.\nAnother aspect of this separation of privileges business arises in which part of macOS you are using: the \"Unix part\", or the \"GUI part\"? Things get blurrier here because there are tools and utilities in macOS that \"overlap\" - that is there are many settings that can be made through the CLI (command line interface, aka Terminal app) that can also be made through the GUI interface.\nIn the case of the \"Unix part\" of macOS, default permissions/privileges may be changed in the sudoers file to elevate privileges for a non-Admin user. In the case of the \"GUI part\" of macOS, permissions and privileges are controlled (in part) through the authorization database (all you want to know is in this Apple resource).\nIt's all a bit of a muddle methinks. IMHO, if you're system is a single-user system, then you are also the Administrator - regardless of whether you choose to use one login, or two. Therefore, this question boils down to: \"personal preference\". If it's a multi-user system, that's a horse of a different color, but I would opine in most cases a second Admin account should be created. But once again, that depends upon your situation and your judgments.\nBased on all of the above, I have opted to create an unprivileged (regular user) account for \"normal\" usage, and reserve my Admin account as a backstop for potentially careless decisions. I use the CLI quite a lot, so I've added my regular user account to the sudoers file to grant Admin/root privileges as an exception. This works for me.\nP.S. Use a strong password for your Admin account.\n", "Q: How to select every second object? I unfortunately copied few of my photos in the foto application and now I want to delete them.

Thus I was thinking to uninstall git and reinstall from scratch, not sure if this is the right approach tho.\n\nA: Do not uninstall Apple-distributed Git. You can leave it as it is and run another version by having it in a directory earlier in PATH environment variable.\nThe easiest way to install another version on OS X would be to use Homebrew packet manager.\nAfter installing it, you can run:\nbrew install git\n\nHomebrew (brew) will take care of all dependencies and configure the latest Git version, however there is still a chance it will find a setting it cannot resolve automatically, so read what Homebrew says at the end.\nPackages installed with brew do not interfere with system-preinstalled packages.\nIt installs packages under /usr/local/Cellar directory and puts executables in /usr/local/bin, so you just have to keep it in PATH variable in before /usr/bin.\n\nA: For people who installed git by following instructions on official Git homepage, and therefore have git installed at /usr/local/bin/git, run the uninstall script:\n/usr/local/git/uninstall.sh\n\nA: /usr/bin/git, along with some other cmd tools, is just a jumper binary to a real binary comes with Xcode.app or 'Xcode Command Line Tools' (CLT). It is protected by SIP and you shouldn't delete it.\nYou might consider to remove Xcode.app or /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/ .\n\nA: I had a very similar issue. Struggled with it for hours and finally found that removing/deleting my .ssh folder and generating a new ssh key did the trick.\nI ran the following in the terminal\nrm -rf .ssh/\n\n\n(after rm -rf, type .ss and hit TAB, it should jump to the folder)\n\nYour ssh folder should no longer exist\nNext, generate your public key with the following command\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nOR, if you want to set it up with your email address, you can type\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"youremailaddress@example.com\"\n\nThis will generate a ssh key\n\n(Go through the process by following the prompts, set password if\n  needed)\n\nThen, you can display your code by typing the following\ncat .ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nOR \npbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\n\n(to automatically copy your public key)\nFinally, paste it in your GitHub or any other, as you would normally\n  add a public ssh key.\n\nThis worked very well for me.\nI hope it helps a few others as well\n", "Q: Free software that monitor CPU temperature under El Capitan?

I installed Ubuntu under Virtualbox in MacBook Pro with OS X El Capitan.\nTo share my OS X home directory /Users/tli folder with the guest Ubuntu, I downloaded the Virtualbox Guest Addition iso file to /Users/tli/Downloads/virtualbox/VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.16.iso, specified it under the virtual machine's Settings -> Storage -> Optical Drive (see the screenshot below), and installed it under the guest Ubuntu. \nThen the shared directory worked: my OS X home directory /Users/tli folder is mounted as /media/sf_tli, and I could access the content in my OS X home directory from guest Ubuntu.\n\nBut after restarting the guest Ubuntu and virtualbox maybe abnormally or maybe not (I forgot), the content of the shared directory became empty in the guest Ubuntu.

There is a way to do it on the iOS version? If not do you know if there is any intention to implement this feature?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Here in iOS that's not currently possible, in fact when you've no connection and try to send a message, the Send button will be disabled, and even though you could successfully tap it before the connection goes off, the message wouldn't get sent and a red icon would appear on its right side, to alert you it was not sent and it won't until you don't get connection back.\n\nSummary\nSo the only messages which will be sent when you get the connection back will be those who were sent when you had actually a connection, but got lost during the process of sending the message.\nInstead you won't be able to do that when you have no connection at all.\n\nThough, developers love to hear their customers feedback, so I highly suggest you to give it a try and contact WhatsApp support (support@whatsapp.com) for iOS and let them know your idea, who knows it may be added in the next update hopefully!\nHope this helped you out!\n\nA: For future reference: This is now supported (starting from version 2.17.1) on iOS.\n", "Q: How To Give Each User Separate Applications Folder I just got a used Mac mini and am currently setting it up for me and my family to use. Before this, the only Mac in the house was my MacBook Pro and very rarely did anyone else use it, so I had the only account. Now, with the Mac mini, I'm giving all four of us user accounts and come across an annoying issue: we all share the same Applications folder. This is probably to save space on the hard drive, but I hate it.\nWhat I'm looking to accomplish is to give everyone their own Applications folder, completely independent of each other (I can delete an app from my folder, but it will remain in everyone else's). Also, I need any new apps downloaded from the Mac App Store to go to the user's Applications folder, as well, but only to that user's folder. Also, I need each user's Launchpad to only show the apps from their folder.\nTerminal commands are fine.\n\nA: It is easy. \nIf you download an app from the AppStore, the app will be installed in the /Applications folder by default, if you want to hide it from others, just move it to /Users/someone/Applications/ (which is your own or another users' application folder). \nIf the app is from a DMG file, just put it into your own (or other user's) \n Applications folder, and do not put it into /Applications folder.\nThe application would then appear only in someone's Launchpad.\n\nA: You can't really manage this. Unix is a multiuser system and apps are usually shared to save space and ease of maintenance.\nApple and apps from the MacOS Store will install in /Applications however only admin users can install or delete them. Thus you can make it so only you can install or delete.\nHowever non Apple apps that are not via app store can be managed in the way you want if they are written correctly (i.e. there are exceptions) If the install process is just copy from a .dmg disk then they can be copied to ~/Applications\n\nA: After a little research, this appears to be happening due to the applications being installed to the root Applications folder on the HD. /Applications folder and not the /Users/user/Applications folder. Typically applications will install to the user's Applications folder by default however this is not always the case.\nTry installing an application specifically into a user's Application folder and see if that works for you.\n", "Q: homebrew - trouble upgrading openssl?

The title says it all. Does anyone have experience with sending uncompressed folders to people using different operating systems? Can attached folders be opened on Windows?\n\nA: When you attach a folder to a email in Mail, even thought it looks like an individual folder in the email, both in the composed email and then the sent email, nonetheless the contents of the folder when sent, is zipped into a single .zip archive that is base64 encoded for transport. It is the .zip file that's received by others and there should not be a problem with them accessing it regardless of Host OS.\nLooking at the actual .emlx file, here is an excerpt showing the attachment as a .zip file that is actually an \"untitled folder\" selected to be attached.\n--Apple-Mail=_E825218C-47BC-4480-9C03-9F3B81A43257\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n    filename=\"untitled folder.zip\"\nContent-Type: application/zip;\n    x-mac-auto-archive=yes;\n    name=\"untitled folder.zip\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\nUEsDBAoAAAAAAAuq2kgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASABAAVG8gVGVsbCB0aGUgVHJ1dGgvVVgMAGZ+cFdm\nfnBX9QEUAFBLAwQUAAgACAAOqtpIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGwAQAFRvIFRlbGwgdGhlIFRydXRoLy5E\nU19TdG9yZVVYDABrfnBXa35wV/UBFADtmDsOwjAQRGeNC0s0LindcABuYEXJCbgABVeg99Eh2hGy\n\nWhen I received the file in a different email client it was shown as an attachment not the folder as shown in Mail under OS X.\nWhen opened in the other email client it contained the files that were in the \"untitled folder\" that was attached to the email that was sent. \n", "Q: Minimize all but the active of the current application's windows I switch to, for example, Safari and find the window I want. I can Command-Option-H to hide all the other applications, but I also want to minimize all the Safari windows except the one I'm using (the front-most one).\nIs there a way to do this? Would settle for an AppleScript I can trigger with Keyboard Maestro.\n\nA: Here is an AppleScript that achieves the results of what you originally explicitly and specifically asked for, before editing the question after it was answered.\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    activate\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke \"h\" using {command down, option down}\n    end tell\n    set miniaturized of (windows whose index is not 1) to true\nend tell\n\n\nNote: The above AppleScript works for me under OS X 10.8.5 and Safari 6.2.8 however I have not tested it on any other version of OS X. That said, I believe it will work fine on other versions of OS X.\n\nUpdate to address the edit of the original question:\nI played around a bit with different methods and what I found was, within the ways I tried, most apps worked while some would not. In other words, I didn't find a universal method that worked with all the apps I normally run. So, I'm adding a block of code that you can try and see if it can work for you.\nIdeally simply hiding all other apps and minimizing the non-active windows of the current app so as to have a smooth appearance in action it what's desired however Finder presented a challenge.  So in this example code Finder must minimize all it windows first and bring back what was the frontmost while other apps have a nice cascading effect to minimized non-active windows while leaving the frontmost windows as is.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set frontApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true\n    set windowName to name of first window of application process frontApp\nend tell\n\nif not frontApp is \"Finder\" then\n    tell application frontApp\n        activate\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            keystroke \"h\" using {command down, option down}\n        end tell\n        set miniaturized of (windows whose name is not windowName) to true\n    end tell\nelse\n    tell application frontApp\n        activate\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            keystroke \"h\" using {command down, option down}\n            keystroke \"m\" using {command down, option down}\n            tell process frontApp to click menu item windowName of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Window\" of menu bar 1\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend if\n\n\nA: This AppleScript will tell the active application to minimize all windows except the active (aka frontmost) window.\nset theFrontApp to (path to frontmost application as Unicode text)\ntell application theFrontApp\n    set theWindows to the windows whose miniaturized is false\n    set theFrontID to the id of the front window\n    repeat with theWindow in theWindows\n        if the id of theWindow is not theFrontID then set the miniaturized of theWindow to true\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nProps to @barryels for the nifty snippet for theFrontApp.\n", "Q: Bash script to click button on an HTML page I'm trying to write a Bash script that opens a browser, clicks an HTML button on a webpage, and closes the browser after getting response.

It's a command line tool that transfers data using various protocols including HTTP.  The beauty here is that you don't need a GUI browser; everything will be handled at the command line level.\nThe \"button\" you want to press will be located in some sort of form.  You can use the Developer Tools in Chrome or Firebug in Firefox to see the code for the form.  Following is an example form with a single text box and a submit button:\n<form action=\"http://foo.bar/helloworld.html\" method=\"POST\">\n<input type=\"text\" name=\"phone\"> <br/>\n<input type=\"submit\">\n</form>\n\nIf you were to fill out this form in your web browser and click submit, you would basically send whatever you typed in the text box and sent the request to the server.\nThe important thing to notice here is that the form creates a text \"field\" called phone which is where it will store the data that you enter to be posted.  In this case, when you type your phone number (+12125551212) it assigns that value to phone.  When you hit the Submit button it sends phone=\"+12125551212 as part of the POST.\nSo, using what I am assuming is the phone number you want to submit as the value for the variable, in curl, the code would look like this:\ncurl -d \"phone=+12125551212\" http://foo.bar/helloworld.html\n\nSince curl is a command line utility, you can put it natively into a bash script:\n#/usr/bin/bash\n\ncurl -d \"phone=+12125551212\" http://foo.bar/helloworld.html\n\nexit\n\n\nA: Another option for robust automated web browsing is perl's WWW::Mechanize module.\nTo report spam to the spamcop service, I use a combination of AppleScript and perl. AppleScript interacts with Mail and gets the spam contents and the perl side handles the web browsing.\nBelow is an example of WWW::Mechanize to submit a form to a web server, find a specific button in the response, and to click the button:\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nuse WWW::Mechanize;\n\nmy $spamcop_url = 'http://www.spamcop.net';\n\nmy $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new();\n$mech->get( $spamcop_url );\n\n$mech->submit_form(\n        form_number => 1,\n        fields      => {\n            username    => 'ENTER YOUR SPAMCOP USER NAME HERE',\n            password    => 'ENTER YOUR SPAMCOP PASSWORD HERE',\n        }\n    ) .\"\\n\";\n\nmy $stop = 0;\nwhile(not $stop) {\n\n    $mech->follow_link( text => 'Report Now' ) .\"\\n\";\n\n    my $form = $mech->form_name( 'sendreport' );\n    if ($form) {\n        print \"Send Report form found: \".$mech->value('reports').\"\\n\";\n        $mech->click_button( 'value' => 'Send Spam Report(s) Now' ) .\"\\n\";\n    } else {\n        print \"No report form button found.\\n\";\n        $stop = 1;\n    }\n}\n\n", "Q: Photos not synching from iPhone 5S to iCloud I am new to the Apple world and running into difficulty while attempting my Photos from my iPhone 5S (ios version 9.2.1) to iCloud.\nIn my Photos settings, I have the iCloud Photo Library option selected, yet when I log in to https://www.icloud.com/#photos I do not see any items whatsoever.\nI've tried the usual options of restarting my phone, de-selecting and re-selecting etc.\nI have noticed that underneath this option it says \"Low Disk Space - Uploading 311 items\"\nWhat could be going wrong here?

Here's one example.\nor\n\n\n*Definitely real MFi-Certified chargers from reputable companies like Belkin, AmazonBasics, and Anker. Here's one example.\nCertainly it would seem like genuine Apple chargers would be safer. But there is a catch: the chargers that claim to be \"by Apple\" or \"Original Apple OEM\" all have terrible reviews (see that link from category 1) that call the chargers \"unsafe\" and \"a fire hazard\". And many of the chargers from category 2 have very positive reviews, often 4-4.5 stars. \nSo are the \"Apple\"-branded chargers really made by Apple Inc., and which type of charger is safer when one needs to purchase a lightning iPhone charger from Amazon?\nHere's a screenshot of some of the \"genuine\" Apple charger's negative reviews:\n\nOne reviewer (pictured on the bottom right in that screenshot) even mentions that the \"genuine\" charger caused the dreaded Accessory Not Supported error on their iPhone.\n\nA: Apple Products\nIf you ever think of purchasing Apple branded products, your only safe place to make your purchases are Apple Stores or the Online Apple Store. If you prefer to make fast and safe purchases online, you can download the Apple Store App by Apple and make purchases there.\nMFI Certified Products\nWhen purchasing these non-Apple branded products you must pay attention. \nIf they're certified by Apple, you just need to find a brand you trust and make your purchases safely while saving some money as well!\nI've purchased one MFi certified cable for my iPhone 6s as a second option, and I've encountered no issues so far. Then, yesterday, a friend of mine tried it as she needed to charge her iPhone 5s, and she had no problems at all either! MFi cables are a great bet. Some of the best and most reliable cables sold on Amazon are made by AmazonBasics and Anker (Anker makes a power adapter brick too).\n\nIn the end, you should always buy cables you are certain are genuine, because counterfeits are downright dangerous. If you need to purchase from Amazon, buy a high-rated MFi cable from the likes of AmazonBasics, Anker, or Sync-Wire. Otherwise, purchase a genuine Apple charger straight from the Apple Store. I would totally suggest you to try the Amazon route: you'll save a few dollars and you can easily get a refund if the cable goes bad quickly. And if you purchase a cable that's \"genuine\" and \"made by Apple\", you must buy it through the Apple Store.\nIf you're interested on the brand of the cable I bought (made by Sync-Wire), here's the link to the product, and you may find interesting to browse their website if you're curious about their products!\n", "Q: How do I recover deleted browser history on iPhone? I accidentely deleted the browser history in Safari on the iPhone, but would still need to re-access one link. How can I recover a deleted browser history?\n\nA: Not endorsing this practice, but yes, there is a way that sometimes works...\nGo to Settings, then Safari, then scroll to bottom and select 'Advanced' and then 'Website Data'. Selecting from there should show you history.\n\nA: It is a difficult thing to retrieve the deleted browser history if you don't have backups, but don't worry, if the data are still not overwritten, there is a strong possibility that deleted browser history can be retrieved with some professional tools.\n", "Q: Run Python Script on any Mac computer Is there a way to create an executable Python script that will be able to run on any Mac via terminal, similar to a Bash script. I need any user to be able to just double click the file, and it should run. I want it to be able to run without the user having Python installed, but it has to be a Python script as it has to interact with an HTML button.\n\nA: You can use PyInstaller, which is a free program that does the exact thing you want. As the official website says:\n\nPyInstaller is a program that freezes (packages) Python programs into stand-alone executables, under Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Solaris and AIX. Its main advantages over similar tools are that PyInstaller works with Python 2.7 and 3.3—3.5, it builds smaller executables thanks to transparent compression, it is fully multi-platform, and use the OS support to load the dynamic libraries, thus ensuring full compatibility.\n\nI should also mention that you can make a .py file executable just like other Linux(Unix) executable file, like this:\nThis command lets the file to be executed (see this)\nuser@linux~>chmod 0755 myProg.py\n\nand then run it like this:\n user@linux~>./myProg.py\n\n\nA: MacOS comes with python 2.7 installed (and has done for nearly ten years). It also contains python 2.6 and 2.5 for compatibility with those versions, which were on even earlier OS releases.\nSo any python 2.7 -compatible script will run on MacOS. If you save the file with the file ending .command or .tool, it will launch in the Terminal from a double-click in the Finder. You will also need to set the execution flag with chmod, as described in the other answer. (Some text editors, like BBEdit, will do this for you when you save the file.)\nMake sure you've added #!/usr/bin/python as the first line, and you're good to go. \n", "Q: How do I clear Google Chrome's DNS cache entirely? Chrome is quite aggressive about caching HTTP responses. I assume this is for speed.\nHowever, for a web developer such as myself, this can often be problematic, since pages I work on often change a lot.\nFor instance, my company's public website had a connection problem that I fixed but Chrome still gives me a ERR_CONNECTION_RESET page whenever I visit it (the root domain and every URL under it).

I've tried to sign up in Face Time and iMessage a lot of time but they are showing that there's a problem on network. Why is this happening? \n\nA: I've had similar experiences with my iPod 6th Gen too. I suggest that you check your network, or WiFi and try again. If it is a network issue, then you might have to wait until it is resolved. I fixed mine, after figuring out that it was a faulty WiFi and not the iPod (the Wifi option was on) or the service.

Facetime is reporting that no camera is available. Killing VDCAssistant does nothing.\nUpdate 2\nIt seems a full shutdown, turn on turns the LED off, unlike a simple restart. Opening any app that uses the webcam reinstates the problem.\nUpdate 3\nAfter running Apple Hardware test, it has been confirmed that there is a hardware issue.  Will be taking it in to Apple to get serviced.\n\nA: Based on the description and the comments, this sounds like a hardware failure, not malware.   The iSight camera and/or cable has most likely failed.  Replacing it should be a fairly simple task to a tech to accomplish\nThe first thing to do when having hardware difficulty of any type is to run Apple Hardware Test (AHT).  Simply hold down the D key while booting from a powered off state and the AC adapter connected.\nSince AHT diagnosed an issue and you are under AppleCare, it's best that you take it in.  \n", "Q: Time Machine backup time Time machine keeps daily snapshot for past month and hourly for the last 24 hours. \nMy question - I am only seeing backups at the rate of anywhere from 3-6 per day. Looking at the TM folder I see this -\n\n3 backups yesterday, 6 the day before. We are 8 hours into the new day, and no backup has completed yet. \nI am running 10.6.8 on a 12 core MacPro. The only BU is for the main drive, a 512GB SSD with only 52GB of capacity used. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it normal for the backs to take so long? \n\n*Is there anything I can do to speed this up? \n\n\nFor what it's worth, I rebooted after posting (6 hours ago) and told time machine to start a backup. It still shows \"indexing\" after 6 hours. \nNew Edit - After posting the above, backups continued to take a few hours, so I still saw a few per day. As of now, no backup has completed in 48 hours. Still hoping for a way to troubleshoot this. Even wiping the backup and starting fresh would be ok, but I'm not confident the problem won't reappear. \n\nA: After searching, I've found that generally, even though this is the stated timing \n\nthe best you are likely to see is every 2-3 hours for this size drive. Sometimes a backup will stall, and the software will restart, so I have a few daily backups remaining that time stamp as late as 6 am, showing there was at least a 6 hour gap. \nThat said, I have a second MacPro, running Yosemite, same 50GB used, and its backups are every hour, like clockwork. \n", "Q: Boot MacMini (2014) from USB Here is the problem.\nA long time ago, I set my Mac Mini to dual boot (using Bootcamp, but with some third-party repartitioning). \nI proceeded to install rEFInd, and eventually, to triple-boot. To find the right combination of partitions was a bit tedious, but I got it to work (using a GPT with a protective MBR disk layout, and a number of partitions, for recovery, for each system - three for Windows, two for OSX, one for Ubuntu Linux).\nAll was well initially, I could boot to rEFInd, and then move around and boot around as well.\nBUT. One fine day, shortly after, my computer stopped detecting the internal HDD at boot time.\nI'd get the blinking grey folder. I got out of it by booting from a Linux Live CD, every time, then restarting my way to the rEFInd partition.\nThat's right: after the Linux Kernel initial load, the whole computer sees the internal HDD once again.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting the boot HD in MacOSX, from \"System Preferences\".\n\n*Repairing file systems using Disk Utility, and also, using Onyx.\n\n*Resetting the NVRam and whichever equivalent of the PRam, using the reserved key combinations at startup + actions involving\nremoving the power cable.\n\n*Completely reinstalling, repartitioning.\n\n*Reinstalling OSX over the network, not using any boot media.\n\n\nTo no avail.\nI am now running two systems, Ubuntu and OSX El Capitan, but to this day - and hear me out, the whole hardware is running fine, has been running for over a year just fine - yet, to this day, whenever I shut my Mac down, I have to resort to the Live USB procedure to gain access to rEFInd.\nI am looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*A way to boot into the supposedly programmable firmware?

This happens even when I restart Mail or even restart the computer. I have tried interacting with it during it's brief appearance (close button, send button, ...) but it doesn't appear to be reacting to my clicks.\nAny suggestions on what may be happening or what I can do about it?\nEDIT: I have just upgraded from Yosemite to Capitan. Perhaps that's a contributing factor to the behaviour. \nEDIT: I have realised that the phantom window DOES receive keystrokes: if I'm typing into another email when the phantom appears, 3 or 4 keystrokes end up in the phantom, then the subsequent keystrokes appear in the new email after the phantom disappears. It seems the phantom grabs the focus if mail is active - also evidenced by document view popups getting cleared each time the phantom appears.\n\nA: This seems to be caused by incorrect credentials for the SMTP server that had been associated with the from address of the email. The Inbox for that email now has \" - dead\" appended to it's name (presumably referring to the SMTP server not working, as am receiving emails). It's a gmail.\nAs a workaround, first, I can stop the annoying window's phantom behaviour by taking all accounts offline (\"Mailbox\" menu). Then change the SMTP server for the offending account (fix credentials or use one that works), then re-enabling all accounts. At this point, the phantom email is actually sent and everything seems back to normal.\n", "Q: How does Siri come up with contact suggestions? Are they recent from days, months?  How long ago?

I have a new Magic Keyboard 2 and I was wondering if keeping it connected all the time to the USB port can somehow damage the battery\n\nA: In general, keeping it connected all the time will not damage the battery.  Apple has designed these peripherals to only accept a charge when it's needed.  When it doesn't need the power, it simply will not use it.\nHowever, it's a good practice to periodically, every month or so, unplug the keyboard and let it run on its battery until it gets very low (below 10%) or stops working.  Then you can plug it back in and leave it alone while it charges.  Apple has a nice section on batteries and their maintenance here.\n\nA: I believe Apple devices use 'smart' charging, where the device will only charge when it needs it, and won't be continuously subjected to charging (this only makes sense).  The energy needs of the device, above maintaining the battery, will most likely come through the power connection (charging cable).\nBut as for running the battery down low to preserve it?\nThat is a bit more dubious.\n\n*\n\n*I believe the biggest question here is whether the device is EVER intended to be used intermittantly or frequently disconnected from a power source (in other words: run off of the battery).\nIf the answer is 'no', then leaving it plugged in all the time will probably allow the battery to last the longest.\n\nRemember, ANY rechargeable battery has a maximum or finite number of charge/discharge cycles.\nIf it's ALWAYS going to be tethered to power, there's no need to disconnect and discharge it (only to then reconnect and recharge it).  By doing that, you would DEFINITELY use another one of the (finite number of) cycles (and for no reason).\nReferences to battery 'health' pertain only to batteries that will be regularly 'cycled'.\nIf the battery is not going to be cycled, then avoiding using up those discharge/recharge cycles will allow that battery to last longer than purposely discharging it for 'health'.\nI have a Macbook from May 2012, with the original battery.\nIt's been tethered nearly permanently since then (only a few times running on battery during power failures, or accidentally knocking off Mag-Safe connector).\nThe Macbook  charge icon always shows 100%, and there're never any battery warnings.\n(When the Macbook has very infrequently discharged and went low, it has always recharged back up to 100%; and that happened even within the last half-year... remember, the battery is going on 9 years old.)\nI'm not sure of the algorithms used by Apple in determining 'battery health'.\nIt could be that one of them is simply a clock; if the battery is so many years old, or if the device has been 'on' for so many hours, it may flag it as needing replacement. Another algorithm could calculate the number of equivalent full cycles, and compare to a some finite assigned number to that battery.\n", "Q: Can't find installed software Forgive me if this is a dumb question, but I've tried all sorts of things, and need help.\nI needed to use some software from the Internet, so I got some installers for them.

Question title pretty much says it all.  My wife just started working for a company that uses Office 365 online.  When she is using a work computer, she logs in to her Microsoft Exchange Mail, Calendar, and her OneNote account via a web browser.  When on her home computer, she can connect Apple Mail and Apple Calendar to her Exchange account.  Is there a way to sync her Apple Notes to her OneNote account?\n(I know that there is a Mac client for OneNote, by the way.  This question is about whether the native Notes app can sync to OneNote.)\n\nA: The short answer is No.\nApple Notes and OneNoe can't be sync'd.

It says that the computer doesn't use battery but it doesn't charge it.\nI have tried with both chargers and it is the same.\nNow I have also tried to shut the computer down and charge it : it works, it remains orange and charges the battery.\nI must admit that I have changed the battery to a compatible one because mine was too old. \nDo you think the fact that it is a compatible battery makes the computer thinks it is fully loaded and stops charging ?  Is there a way to prevent that instead of stopping the computer to charge ?\nThanks\n\nA: The first thing I would do is an SMC Reset.  According to Apple, one of the reasons to reset your SMC is...\n\nTo do a reset\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the Mac.\n\n*Plug in the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter to a power source and to your Mac.\n\n*Using the built-in keyboard, press Shift Control Option on the left side of the keyboard, then press the power button at the same time.\nRelease all keys, then press the power button again to turn on your Mac\n\n\nIf you continue to have problems, I would then run an Apple Hardware Test and see if you can obtain any diagnostic info.\n\nA: This is an unlikely case, but this is what happened to me.

I left version 2.7 as per this recommendation.\nNow I would like to update version 3.5.1 to the latest one but from the command line. Is there a way to do that (preferably from within python itself)?\n\nA: You can easily switch versions of Python using pyenv.\nFor example (using Homebrew):\n$ brew update\n$ brew install pyenv\n$ echo 'eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n$ exec $SHELL\n\n$ pyenv install 2.7.12\n$ pyenv install 3.5.2\n$ pyenv global 2.7.12 3.5.2\n\n$ python -V\nPython 2.7.12\n\n$ python2 -V\nPython 2.7.12\n\n$ python2.7 -V\nPython 2.7.12\n\n$ python3 -V\nPython 3.5.2\n\n$ python3.5 -V\nPython 3.5.2\n\n\nA: I'd use homebrew so you could upgrade or install using a one line command:\nbrew install python3 && brew upgrade python3\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, there isn't another way from the command line other than installing Homebrew, an unofficial package manager for macOS and then typing brew install python3. \nThis method does pose some issues. When installing Python via Homebrew, it does not remove any old version of Python (for compatibility reasons). This means old versions could be sitting on your hard drive, taking up space that could be used for something else. Another possible issue with Homebrew is that it needs Xcode to be installed so that it can compile and install Python on-device (and the current version of Xcode takes up 10+ gigs of HD space, not to factor in the space to store the source code).\nThe preferred and official way to install Python is via their .pkg installer available at their website, but this doesn't remove old Python3 installations either (again, for the same reasons).\nSo it all comes down to how you want to go about installing Python. There are many different ways, and I only listed the ones that seem most relevant to your situation.\n", "Q: Bootcamp and upgrading to macOS Sierra At the moment, I am running OS X El Capitan (10.11.5) and Windows 10 in bootcamp on my MacBook Pro. I plan on upgrading to the macOS Sierra public beta when it comes out in July or so. \nMy question is, is an upgrade to macOS Sierra going to make my bootcamp not bootable anymore. I have seen on apple discussion forums, and people that I know have had problems getting their bootcamp to work after an OS X upgrade. However, I have also seen many others not having any issues whatsoever when upgrading.\nI would just like to clear up my confusion, will an upgrade from El Capitan to macOS sierra render my bootcamp useless/unbootable?\n\nA: I am running a macOS Sierra Seed Beta (invitation-only, released before the public beta) and my VMs and other bootable OS', including bootcamp are working just fine. But as always, you will be on a beta so proceed with caution!\n\nA: It is a beta it might or it might not. Until Apple makes it public we cannot know.\nIt will depend on what they want to test first - it could be that Bootcamp will be fixed in a later part of the beta and be broken at the beginning\nAnyway assume,e you will have to restore from a good backup and make that part of your workflow\n", "Q: What is this invisible character icon in Pages? I enabled 'show invisibles' on a docx that has been converted from pdf and this icon appears at several places:\n\nI cannot get rid of it. What is this icon? What's its purpose?\n\nA: According to Apple's official documentation, that symbol denotes a layout break.\nThese allow you to change the layout anywhere on the page (for example, a one-column title then a two-column title).\nThe reason you can't remove it is because it's part of the layout of the document. You could try applying a default style to the text that is part of the layout break (such as \"body text\").\n", "Q: IOS 10 warning: Using a hidden network can expose personally identifiable information I am aware that 'hiding' a wifi network/SSID does not make the network MORE secure, but Apple's warning on IOS 10: \n\nUsing a hidden network can expose personally identifiable information\n\nseems to indicate that hidden networks are LESS secure.\nClicking the 'learn more' link does not give any further info supporting the claim. \nExactly how can hiding an SSID make the network any LESS secure (by \"expose[ing] personally identifiable information\")\n\n\nA: Clients that connect to known networks automatically will advertise “hidden” SSIDs in all of their probe requests. This results in your device broadcasting those SSIDs everywhere you go, to anyone who’s listening.\nThis behavior is dependent on the client’s operating system. For instance, you can configure Windows 7 and later to not connect to hidden networks automatically (only “visible” ones). That prevents such broadcasts from happening, but then you have to connect to hidden networks manually every time.\nOn the other hand, iOS and macOS always connect to known networks, hidden or not. The fact that iOS 10 warns about this would indicate that Apple has no plans to add the kind of toggle switch that Microsoft added in Windows 7, or to force the user to connect manually. Therefore, iOS and macOS constantly broadcast all the hidden SSIDs they are capable of connecting to.\nMicrosoft explains this behavior on TechNet:\n\nA non-broadcast network is not undetectable. Non-broadcast networks are advertised in the probe requests sent out by wireless clients and in the responses to the probe requests sent by wireless APs. Unlike broadcast networks, wireless clients running Windows XP with Service Pack 2 or Windows Server® 2003 with Service Pack 1 that are configured to connect to non-broadcast networks are constantly disclosing the SSID of those networks, even when those networks are not in range.\nTherefore, using non-broadcast networks compromises the privacy of the wireless network configuration of a Windows XP or Windows Server 2003-based wireless client because it is periodically disclosing its set of preferred non-broadcast wireless networks.\n\nNow as to why this is a privacy issue:\n\n*\n\n*Should I point out the irony of broadcasting an SSID in the direct vicinity of the access point trying to hide it? Except instead of only having the AP broadcasting it, every client in range does. Then the AP responds to each of those clients with the SSID anyway.\n\n*Instead of limiting SSIDs to the vicinity of their respective APs (like in the case of visible networks), your phone goes and broadcasts those hidden SSIDs to everyone near you, everywhere you go. Worse, SSIDs may include first and/or last names, which I’ve seen people use in network names.\n\n*Your set of preferred hidden SSIDs acts as a signature that may uniquely identify you. Let’s say for instance that my neighbor uses the hidden SSID My Secret SSID. Now if I sniff a broadcast beacon containing My Secret SSID at Starbucks, I can infer that a member of his household is nearby, or one of his guests. Based on the other hidden SSIDs among that person’s broadcast beacons, I may be able to determine exactly who I’m dealing with. Conversely, I could walk up to that person, recognize them, then assign a face to their unique set of hidden SSIDs.\n\n*Let’s say you carry your phone with you everywhere you go. Someone with a large-enough network of radio receivers could know where you are at any given time, figure out where you work, where you spend your time, whether you’re home, etc.\n\n1 and 2 show how trying to hide an SSID makes the privacy of its network much worse. 3 and 4 show how that extends to your personal privacy as well.\nSound far-fetched? Criminals/advertisers/jealous exes/the government have done worse things. In fact, MAC addresses were once used to track shoppers’ movements through malls. Apple subsequently randomized MAC addresses in probe requests.\nThankfully, no one I know has used a hidden SSID in well over a decade, and I haven’t seen that practice recommended in even longer long.\nBottom line: don’t hide your SSID. It achieves the exact opposite of what you think it does.\nUpdate: Since there seems to be some confusion as to why you can’t connect to a hidden network without broadcasting it to the world, as well as about security vs. privacy, let’s make a fun analogy.\nImagine a driver (the AP) is picking you up from the airport. They don't know you, and you don’t know them. So they hold up a sign that reads, “John Doe.” When you find them, you (the client) go and tell them, “I’m John Doe.” This is what happens when connecting to a broadcast network.\nNow, imagine that driver is trying to be super covert, and doesn’t hold up that sign. What happens now is you have to walk around yelling, “Who’s picking up John Doe?” over and over, until finally the driver steps forward and responds, “I'm picking up John Doe.”\nIn either case, you then exchange credentials, make sure you’re each who you think you’re dealing with. What happens after authentication is just as secure either way. But every step leading up to it compromises your privacy.\n\nA: Apple representatives stated that iOS 10 passively listens for known access points and broadcasts SSIDs related to hidden access points but no other \"personal\" information.  Other experts, however, claim to have been able to easily collect information on a phone's trusted wifi access points, hidden or not.  Though hiding your SSID cannot prevent an attack (nothing can), it probably doesn't increase your risk of attack in a measurable way unless iOS is broadcasting other data that wouldn't be available to the attacker otherwise, that could inform an attacker about your identity or other information that could aid their efforts to target you.  Apple should clarify exactly what they mean by \"personally identifiable information\".\nConcerns are raised that your phone will broadcast the SSID of your hidden network while you're not connected to it.  Broadcasting the name of an access point in locations where the access point is NOT seems insignificant.  An attacker would still have to find the actual access point which seems pretty resource intensive unless you AND the attacker are nearby the access point at the same time.  \nA \"hidden\" SSID can reduce your exposure to someone with malicious intent war driving or stumbling upon your network by chance.  The fact that someone can still discover your SSID even if it's hidden seems less concerning because it means an attacker may have to take extra steps to get that information making it more resource and time intensive for them, even if just by a bit.  You never know when someone might get deterred and move on to another target.\n\nA: A couple points. \nAny wireless device is broadcasting (searching 1st) for its \"preferred network SSID's\" when out of range regardless if SSID hidden or broadcast. Apple has a list of protocol priorities of what and how are connected.\nSecurity (handshake to the AP) isn't any different. \nThe false sense of hidden SSID is possibly a huge security issue depending on the AP's password or even lack of. One might think \"hidden\" is making their AP more secure yet everywhere they travel all their/families wireless devices are searching for those hidden/preferred AP's when out of range.\n\nA: Preface\nI think what Apple's message on your screenshot wanted to say is that hiding networks' SSID won't allow them to hid anything except that. So basically they're telling you hiding networks isn't safer it just doesn't broadcast the SSID.\nI agree with you the message can be very tricky to interpret, but I see this as the only reasonable way to read that. But let's not desperate, it's still a Beta, Apple changes a lot in Beta versions, so hopefully they'll update and clarify this message as well!\n\nThus, as Apple wrote on that page it suggested you:\n\nHiding a network doesn't secure your Wi-Fi network, because the SSID is still available through other mechanisms. Security is enforced by a different setting.\n\n\n\nEnd of the story\nHiding networks' SSID won't make them safer or more secure.\n\nA: The only thing I see here is that if you are hiding your SSID, then the device (IOS or windows) must query for the SSID on a regular basis to determine if it is in range, even if it isn't. This means that your device will broadcast everywhere were the SSID cannot be reached.\nIf you however turn on your SSID as broadcast, then the device will passively 'listen' for the SSID instead of constantly broadcasting it.\nI have problems with my wifes IPhone 5 on my home hidden SSID since she upgraded to iOS 10 and I think it is because Apple has changed it so that it does not continually broadcast for hidden SSIDs. I have no problems at all with any of the android devices I use or with any of the windows devices either... and after a quick scan, it appears they do not broadcast for the SSID (They broadcast for all SSID's and then choose from the list). It appears to be an Apple specific issue....\nPlacing a message like they have is BS IMHO because they are blatently blaming the issue on others when it is clearly they seem to lack the talent to seek for hidden SSID's in a secure manner like every other device does.\n\nA: It would seem like the best approach to resolve this situation, while still being able to benefit from the added security of using a hidden network, would be to geocode the location of the access point, and then supply an option in the AP config on the endpoint to enable geofencing for broadcast of the SSID query. The reason that I say added security, is only meant in the general sense; because I feel that it does enhance security for the average person. Most people out there do not have, or know how to use, wifi scanners that could be used to pickup and decode broadcast queries for AP location. The only additional security provided is that someone that doesn't know the name of the network, would be unable to try to guess its password. This obviously has no effect on a well-motivated and properly educated individual, but let's face it, your average person lacks both of those qualities. To anyone that intent on getting in, they'll find a way. \n", "Q: Cannot resize Macintosh HD using (supposedly) available free space I partitioned my hard drive in order to install Ubuntu, but I now would like to reclaim that space and add it back to my Macintosh HD.

I did some research on the various ways how corporate data can be protected on a user owned device (BYOD) running iOS.\nMy understanding is that, through mobile device management (MDM), I could create networking and usage restrictions for certain apps specifically. For example, I could require the user to be connected through a specific VPN in order to use app \"X\". \nI also understand that data is separated logically in the way that, for example, the contact data retrieved from an Exchange Server is only available as long as the configuration setting for said server is active on the device. Deleting it also removes the contacts from the device. \nWhat I cannot figure out is if there is a possibility to limit the scope of the contact data provided by such a corporate server without resorting to third party apps that containerize the data entirely. I'll try to make this clearer with an example. \nOn my private iPhone, I can allow apps such as WhatsApp or facebook to access my contacts. I am using multiple cloud accounts that sync contacts to my device but on my private device without any mdm, I am not able to restrict this setting to just one specific cloud account - if I understand correctly, \"contacts\" just means any contact the device has access to.  \nAs the corporate administrator of an mdm solution, would it be possible for me to restrict this, i.e. prevent the user from giving access to company owned contact data to third party apps while not restricting him if he does so with the contact data held locally or coming from a private server? \n\nA: I spoke to the representative of a well known MDM solution for iOS today about this topic. He confirmed to me that iOS does not support such a separation of work and private data. In other words, you cannot restrict apps to access only specific contact accounts, it's all or nothing. MDM solutions usually deal with this by offering their own containers (apps) for mail and contact management. \n", "Q: Performance hit to gaming using Parallels Desktop for Mac I have a Mid 2014 MacBook Pro Retina 15\" (16 GB, Iris pro, 750M Nvidia, 512 GB SSD). I don't like to use Boot Camp, it's not productive and I don't like to use Windows unless its super necessary. \nI saw a YouTube video of someone playing BattleField 4 with Parallels Desktop on the same model MacBook Pro I have, and the game seems to play fine. \nI wish to play DayZ and Overwatch, my question is: Will Parallels Desktop gaming effect my laptop's performance or lifespan (heat, etc.)? \n\nA: No, your computer will be fine, and performance will be fine, but there's a little fun involved.\nParallels uses a technology called virtualization to run another OS–in this case, Windows–using a combination of hardware and software to create a \"virtual machine\" that acts like a computer. Due to a variety of technologies that exist, virtual machines offer quite good performance when compared to their actual physical counterparts, and can be used for gaming with relatively hit to performance. And no, your computer won't explode, heat management and all that is the same.\nUnfortunately, there's a catch with Parallels: GPUs. Modern games (such as those you want to play) rely heavily on GPUs to provide good performance. Games such as these rely on APIs to handle many functions related to GPUs. Currently there are two primary APIs used for games: Microsoft's DirectX and OpenGL. Unfortunately, DirectX is exclusive to Windows–thus, games utilizing DirectX are generally Windows exclusive (ignoring consoles.) The games you described use DirectX: thus, they are Windows exclusive. This presents a problem when using Parallels: because it runs a virtual machine, it can't normally perform the low-level calls needed by APIs like DirectX to the GPU. To get around this, Parallels translates DirectX calls to OpenGL calls (which do work on Mac) before they are executed. This can result in a somewhat significant decrease in performance, though it may be tolerable.\nHowever, recent Intel processors have started shipping with a technology called Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) that allows these low-level calls to be passed through a virtual machine, eliminated the performance hit described earlier. Your Haswell processor is just new enough that it does ship with this technology onboard! Following these instructions for Parallels, you can leverage VT-d within Parallels to run Windows games with very little performance hit. It's quite lengthy, references a few other pages, and generally wouldn't work well if I posted it here like I normally would, so I recommend you read it there.\nIn conclusion, you'll be able to play your games using Parallels just fine with a little bit of work.\n\nA: You will most likely see a performance hit while you are running a virtual machine on your mac. Depending on how much resources you allow the VM to use will have an effect on that. Example: if you use 10gigs of ram for your Win VM and then try to do something heavy on the mac (with only 6 gigs left) you may see a hit.\nI don't think running Parallels will work your system any greater than other software would, so should not reduce performance or longevity of your laptop. Use and wear is use and wear.\nWhile full of information, the answer from JMY1000 doesn't appear to apply to Parallels Desktop for Mac, but rather Parallels Workstation Extreme, which only runs on Windows and Linux. Sad face. I'm still digging... it looks like VT-D was an experimental feature in previous versions of Parallels Desktop, so there might be hope...\n\nA: I've tried both native and steam games in both macOS and a virtual PD of WIN 10, with very little success. I can get MS flight sim to run, if I don't tax it, but most all FPS and other graphic intensive games, forgettaboutit. My hardware however, is a bit long in the tooth: top of the line MBP 2015 and 27\" imac 2012.

Those will only download on your Mac.  If you want to download some or all on your iPhone then you will have to click the cloud icon for each song or an entire playlist to start the download there.  \n", "Q: Strange iCloud Login issue Okay, so I'm pretty sure i have this right because i have tried a bunch of fixes over the past few days to get to this conclusion.\nI think my IP address is for some reason being denied access to Apple servers.\nI am able to sign into iCloud via my cellular connection.\nBut the moment I try to access or login to any of iCloud login (on mac/phone/windows pc) via my wifi (static IP) apple cannot sign me in and returns the error \"unable to connect to server\" or similar ones.\nDoes anyone know how to resolve this?\nNB: I have done everything from router reset to fresh install of OS. in fact, when I was doing the install, I had to switch between mobile hotspot and wifi to ensure Apple verified my credentials and let me begin the install in the first place.

My old HDD broke up, and had no chance to format my new SSD anywhere.\nNew disk was not listed on Disk Utility, when booted the machine with USB-installer and so that I was not able to format the disk and I was not getting nowhere. \nI noticed that I was able to run Terminal during installer (Top ribbon)\nI checked all devices with command-line Disk Utility:\ndiskutil list\n\nAnd the new Disk was listed there.\nThen format using diskutil:\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ NewDisk /dev/<disk id>      \n\nThe new disk was formatted and reboot. Disk was now listed on Disk Utility and I was able to install the macOS without issues.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue - bought a new Samsung EVO 860 SSD for my early 2011 MacBook Pro 13 inch running OS X Yosemite.\nThe original HDD was still working (but painfully slow), so i had intended to use a SATA III to USB3.0 dock to clone the HDD to the new SSD prior to removing the old HDD and installing the SSD.\nPut the new SSD in the dock, connected dock to MacBook Pro, but the SSD was not being recognised at all in Finder or in Disk Utility. \nI also tried it on another notebook running Windows 10, and it was not recognised as a disk on Windows - when i plugged the dock into the Windows notebook, a message came up identifying it as a faulty USB device, but I could not see it as a disk in Disk Management on Windows.\nIn the end, I did what anrah has mentioned above. Installed the \"blank\" SSD into the MacBook Pro, booted MacBook Pro into Recovery mode and then used Terminal prompt to format the SSD using the diskutil eraseDisk script. When running the \"diskutil list\" the blank SSD just comes up as an unnamed, unformatted drive (key is to check it is the correct disk by looking at the capacity ie. mine is 500GB so it came up as an unnamed 500GB disk).\nAfter running eraseDisk (which takes about 5 seconds) the SSD was then \"recognised\" by Mac OS as a disk. \nI then restored to the new SSD from most recent Time Machine backup on an external disk. That all seems to have worked.\nAs this seems to be a common issue for both Mac OS and Windows users for the newer SSDs, it is curious that manufacturers do not ship the new SSDs pre-formatted (whether in Mac OS Extended, NTFS, FAT32 or whatever) as a formatted disk will at least be recognised as a disk when first connected to either Mac OS or Windows.\n\nA: Same issue with new Samsung EVO 860 in 2011 MacBook Pro.

Personally, I had a MacBook air early 2015 with 128 GB SSD. While upgrading to 512 GB SSD, it was not detected in the internet recovery mode. I tried both Disk Utility and Terminal commands. Finally, this method helps me to fix the issue. https://techiestechguide.com/internal-ssd-is-not-showing-in-macbook-while-booting/\nNB: It will work with any brand SSD.\n\nA: The first thing to do with any SSD problems, is check that the drive has the latest firmware.

It\n  also added the availability of HDMI type A connectors for PC sources,\n  the ability for PC sources to implement only the sRGB color space\n  while retaining the option to implement the YCbCr color space, and\n  required HDMI 1.2 and later displays to allow low-voltage\n  sources.\n\nThat would explain why it showed up as a TV using YPbPr color format. \nThis particular monitor has a native DP interface - per Tetsujin, I would use that port instead of doing the conversion from mDP to HDMI.\nIf you want to go with HDMI, you will need an an mDP to HDMI 2.0 adapter and an HDMI 2.0 cable\n\nMy suggestion is to go native mDP to Display Port - it's much easier and you don't have to buy separate cables.  \nAs for your MBA, every model from 2010 onwards supported the 2550x1400 resolution.

I set up separate iCloud accounts for all of us and turned off cellular calling on my iPad. There doesn't seem to be an option to do this on the iPhone any longer. Despite these efforts,  all of our devices still ring when my daughter gets a FaceTime call from her friend. What should I do next? \n\nA: It sounds like you have the same AppleID on all the devices. The default is that all devices configured with the same AppleID use the primary email address associated with that Apple ID. \nYou have a couple of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a different AppleID\n\n*Use a different email other than the primary one.  There's an excellent article on how to do this workaround \n\n\nBasically, you go into the Facetime settings on on each device you don't want to ring and add another (different) email. \n", "Q: El Capitan froze and rebooted (Macbook Pro Retina Mid 2012) \n*\n\n*2.3 Ghz Intel Core i7 8GB DDR3:\nWas running NetAdmin Pro which is monitoring \nmy office LAN, processors consumption was at \n~15 - 20%.

That is how Apple receives feedback from seeding/beta customers. The keyboard shortcut is Cmd Opt Ctrl Shift Period. \nYou can also run sudo sysdiagnose -f ~/Desktop/ in Terminal. The former will save to /var/tmp and the latter will save to the Desktop. \nSysdiagnose will contain pretty much A to Z.\nYou should be sure to check the disks.txt, diskutil.txt, errorlog.txt, logs.txt, and the diagnostics folder.\n\nA: Shutdown cause numbers are different from Error Codes.  For example, a shutdown cause of 0 means that your Mac lost power.  An error code of 0 (in Bash, for example) means that the function or command  exited normally with no error.  Apple has this backward.\nUsing this case as an example, *Error code -128\" in software means user canceled, while shutdown cause -128 is undefined.\nSo, in the output you provided, you have 3 error codes:  3, 5, and  -128.\n\n\n*\n\n*cause 3 is a \"dirty\" shutdown meaning that something was force quit and/or the power button was held down to power off the system\n\n*cause 5 is a clean exit and there is nothing to worry about\n\n*cause 128 is \"undefined.\"  However, most of the time that I have run across this has been either memory or the logic board\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown Cause -128\n\n*MBP Retina 15 inch, late 2013 shuts down randomly\nThe best way to diagnose this is to run Apple Hardware Test (AHT) with one of your memory modules removed (Mid-2012 and earlier.  2013 and newer models have modules that cannot be removed).  Hold D while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter plugged in.  If your test comes out clean, shutdown, remove the module and replace it with the first one that you removed.  Re-run AHT.\n\nA: *\n\n*The combination of the model, video viewing(/discrete gpu usage) and the way it just respawned to the login screen makes me fairly certain it's a faulty GPU issue. Luckily there's a warranty extension repair program running until the end of the year, see http://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\nCheck /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports for .gpuRestart files to make sure.\n\n\n*Yes. brew install lnav and never look back.\n\n\nLastly, neither of the links you posted are about current shutdown causes, so just ignore them.\n", "Q: Mac keeps booting into disk utilities my mac kept getting stuck on the apple logo when booting up so I went into recovery mode and formatted the disk and installed OS X again. But for some reason it is not booting normally when I switch it on it boots automatically into disk utilities??\n\nA: When you say \"boots automatically into disk utilities\" do you see this screen?\n\nIf so, try closing the window by either pressing the Command and Q keys simultaneously or by clicking the red button in the top left corner of the window. It should prompt you to either shut down, restart, or select a startup disk. Choose to select a startup disk, then chose \"Macintosh HD\" (unless when you erased your disk and installed OS X again you replaced Macintosh HD with another name, in which case you should select that disk instead). Then click \"Restart\".\n", "Q: problems with computer itself due to improper disconnection of disk? I know if a disk is not ejected properly, that can cause corruption or data loss on that disk. But can it cause problems with the Mac as well, such as with the file directory? And if it did cause problems with the computer, would those be limited to how it relates to the disk in question?\n\nA: If you were transferring content to your computer from the disk, the write could be left incomplete. The main purpose of ejecting is to make sure everything actually transferred properly, but if nothing is transferring, issues are unlikely on the computer and the disk. Although improper ejection can damage the disk, it does not damage the computer.\n", "Q: How to reset the $PATH in terminal OS X El Capitan? tried previous posts but did not work I accidentally messed up my $PATH. I Tried to follow the instructions from the previous similar questions but I keep having the same problem\nWhen I type: \necho$ PATH, \nI get the following response:\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin . Do you know how i can reset the PATH?  The operating system is OS X El Capitan. Thank you so much\n\nA: First, run PATH=/bin:/usr/bin in Terminal. \nThen open ~/.bash_profile (in terminal, nano/vim/favorite editor ~/.bash_profile) or open Finder, then press Shift+Command+G and paste it in. Then you can comment out the path line. There is no need to delete .bash_profile in its entirety, and it isn't recommended.\n", "Q: iCloud storage and backups My icloud account kept telling me it was nearly full. I had only 1 back up listed on my iphone (i don't have a mac etc) and the same on the dashboard on my laptop. I deleted the 4.9gb backup (nothing important- full of photos and videos already saved elsewhere) and now i have the full free 5gb listed in my storage. Does this mean my iCloud storage is now completely empty?\n\nA: By default, iCloud storage is 5GB large. So if you're saying under\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > iCloud > Storage\n\n\nyou're seeing 5GB available, then yes your iCloud storage's been emptied.\n", "Q: Can't download old apps I recently deleted a bunch of apps on my iPhone 5 so that I would have room for more photos during a trip. I have returned and moved the photos off of the phone, and there is now plenty of space for me to redone load those apps. However, some of these old apps will not download. If I tap the cloud icon, it shows the loading circle for a second and then goes back to the cloud icon. I was only able to redo load two of the apps and I am not sure what is unique about those two. \n\nA: Well the problem got fixed eventually over time. I was never able to find an actual solution, but eventually more and more of the apps I used to have began to be able to download onto my phone. Not all at once, but eventually I got them all.\n", "Q: How to change keyboard shortcut for opening Character Viewer on OS X El Capitan I can open up the Character Viewer app using the Control-Command-Space keys combination.  \nI want to change this keyboard shortcut so I can use it for some other action.\nHow can this be done?\n\nA: For some reason you can't just disable this shortcut, since it's not listed in the preferences by default.\nYou have to add a shortcut in System Prefs / Keyboard / Shortcuts named \"Emoji & Symbols\" and bind it to something else, and it will become available.\n\n", "Q: iOS updates and iCloud I can't remember what happens when I update my iOS: will I be asked for my iCloud password? I would like to delete my iCloud account ultimately and I guess if i didn't have an account I wouldn't be asked for the password after updating my iOS but just wondered if I will be asked while my account is active.\n\nA: You will be asked for your Apple ID and Password.  Often, this is the same thing as your iCloud account but it doesn't have to be.  If you run into problems, you can contact Apple for assistance.\nYou can follow these instructions for how to update your iOS device.\n", "Q: Use Windows-Only Hardware on Mac I recently bought hardware that apparently does not support Mac.\nWhen connecting it to my Windows VirtualMachine the installer pops up and the device is ready to be used. However, that does not happen on my Mac (Mac Mini Late 2012, macOS 10.11.2).\nI checked for available drivers for the hardware that I could install on my Mac to make it run but they do not offer any.\nIs there any application or 3rd party software that allows me to run Windows-only hardware on my Mac?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I believe the Mac program with the best chance of working with that accessory would be GamePad Companion.\nI can't say for sure if it would work with that device, because it is not on the compatibility list, but GamePad Companion probably works with a wider variety of controllers than any other Mac program, and it has the ability to map gamepads to various keyboard and mouse actions so they will work with any game.\n(This is my personal opinion, and I am not affiliated with this developer.)\n", "Q: Will generic earphones allow basic inline remote / mic capability on my iPhone 6? I'm interested in buying the Sony XBAA1AP earphones, and am curious if earphones that aren't specifically designed for iPhones, but which have an inline remote control / mic, will provide basic remote control / mic features on iPhone devices.\n\nA: Yes, generic earphones/headphones/earpods will work fine with an iPhone.  I have several non-Apple headphones and earphones from various manufacturers and they've all worked, including the play/pause, ff/rw, volume buttons.\nAs long as you purchase from a reputable company and manufacturer, like you've indicated in your question, you'll be ok.\n", "Q: My Mac has weird lines when booting MacBook Pro, Late 2011 2.5Ghz. The Mac works perfectly fine, however, every so often, the Mac simply freezes and doesn't respond. Therefore I turn it off, and when turning it back on weird lines appear. \nThe Mac loads up and then shuts down again as soon as the loading screen ends. We tried replacing the RAM because we recently had a RAM issue, but that did not fix anything. Has anyone had a similar problem? \n\nA: I am suspecting that you have a GPU failure.\n\"Weird lines\" while booting is indicative that there is a problem with the video.  Below are a couple samples of the weird lines similar to what I have seen in my travels.\n\n\nHowever, the best way to test this out with with Apple Hardware Test (AHT).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.\nIt will run through a series of diagnostics - I am pretty certain that you will find you GPU is failing.  \nApple Has a Replacement Program for GPU issues.  If your GPU is in fact failing, Apple has a repair extension  program where they will repair, for free your Macbook Pro.  From the details you provided, but check with Apple to be certain.  The program runs until December 31, 2016.  See the link for details\n\nA: You should take the computer to an Apple Store. Any sort of distortion is covered under the Graphics Card replacement program. They have a test they run to verify! Good Luck! \n", "Q: What is a reasonable workflow to copy Android photos to Photos? My workflow from an SLR and a small camera is simple. Once a month, I take the SD card out, insert it in my Macbook, and Photos can (usually) correctly detect the new photos. I copy them to the Macbook, back up to Time Machine. Once every three or so months, I wipe out the SD card.\nIt's seamless enough.\nI am having trouble finding a reasonable workflow for my Android phone. The photos are synced with both Google Drive and with Dropbox. I'd like a workflow that uses either of the two, ideally one that wipes out my cloud-based photos as well as my Android-based photos, and detects and copies the new photos only.\nCan you suggest such a workflow?\nUpdate\nIn theory I could 1. copy the file from Google Drive to my Macbook and 2. then figure out how to convince Photos to copy the new pictures from a folder rather than from an SD card.\nThe first step can in theory be done by selecting the photos since my last copy (to be figured manually), then select the download option from the context menu.\n\nUnfortunately this complains that\n\n\"zip failed: no files to include\"\n\nA: It's simpler and faster if one uses neither Dropbox nor Google Drive.\nPhotos \\ File \\ Import does it. The catch is that when you connect your Android phone to your Mac(Book), Android's filesystem will not be mounted.\nThe solution is to first use Android File Transfer to copy the directory DCIM \\ Camera to the Mac. Then you can import it.\n\n\n\nA: Google Photos has an excellent tool for this: the Google Photos desktop uploader.\nOnce you upload all the photos from the SD card to your Mac Photos app, drag them all to a folder on your desktop, and, with the uploader installed, your photos will automatically upload to Google Photos. \nThis uploader tool made by Google is described as a tool to\n\nAuto upload photos from your Mac or Windows computer, camera, or storage cards.\n\nSo, you can probably just insert the SD card and save the photos to your Mac to prompt Google Photos to upload them.\nFrom there, you can either use the Google Photos app for Android on your phone, or you can access your google photos right in the Drive app by adding a Google Photos folder to Drive. See how to add a Google Photos folder to Drive on your Mac with this support article (scroll down a bit).\nHope this helps! Comment below if you need anything else.\n", "Q: My kid set a passcode on the iPad and doesn't know it. Now what? My 7-year-old daughter mistakenly set a 4-digit passcode on the iPad and doesn't remember what it is. Now it is locked and useless. What are my options to recover it (if any)?\nThe answers I have seen online all say to \"connect it to the PC or Laptop that you usually synch with for iTunes\". But I never used iTunes. I never synched it with a PC or Laptop. When I just connected it to my MacBook Pro, I got the following message:\n\n\nA: Put your iPad into recovery mode by pressing home and power button simultaneously. When your iPad turns into recovery mode, connect it to your PC or laptop.  Then your iTunes will display  a dialogue box stating that your device is in recovery mode. Click OK.\nThen you can restore your device via iTunes.\n", "Q: Where did \"Find Album Artwork\" go? I just upgraded iTunes to version 12.4.1.6, and now when I right click on a song the option of \"Find Album Artwork\" is gone.\nI use that option when I add new songs that aren't imported with it. (I don't like the \"find all\" option because it messes up some custom artworks I've added)\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: It should still be there, just with a slightly different name: Get Album Artwork.\n\n", "Q: Is there any difference between zooming and cropping on iOS? iOS devices with cameras allow the user to \"zoom\" into the image being captured. This does not move any lenses or anything; it is a digital zoom and is conceptually equivalent to cropping in post.\nHowever, I would like to know if there is any (however small) difference in output between an image that is captured while zoomed in and one that is only cropped after the fact.\n\nA: About the only thing I know is different is that when the photo is cropped after the shot is taken, it will take up more space than if the camera was zoomed in when taking the picture. Why? Because in iOS, photo editing is non-destructive. The part that was cropped out will always be there, you just can't see it. However, when zoomed in, that part of the photo was never taken, so, obviously, it doesn't exist.\nAlso, currently (iOS 9), one can't edit a Live Photo and retain the Live part of the photo. Though, I believe iOS 10 allows one to edit Live Photos.\nAside from that, there's really nothing. Like you put in your post, it's just digital zoom and basically is retroactively zooming the camera in.\n\nA: Austin Blanco has done some experiments to answer this question for the iPhone 6s:\nhttp://www.austinblanco.com/blog/iphone-6s-zoom-resolution/\nIt seems that the camera hardware's maximum resolution is not utilised when you are fully zoomed out. This means cropping and scaling a fully zoomed out image will leave you with a poorer image than if you zoomed in some way first before taking the photo. \nHowever, it seems the camera hardware's maximum resolution is being utilised after zooming in just 30% of the way (i.e. ~1.5x zoom). So if you want a final image zoomed in more than 1.5x, there's no great need to zoom in beyond 30% of the way before taking the photo; you can just crop it later if you want (ignoring minor losses due to re-encoding).\n\nA: In digital zoom, the camera scales up the pixels to give out the photo with the same resolution as with no digital zoom photo.\nIn cropping, the cropped photo has lower resolution compared to the uncrossed photo.\nSo I can say that digital zoom is conceptually equal to cropping and then scaling the cropped photo back to its original resolution. The output photos would be the same if the scaling algorithms used in digital zoom and in post scaling are the same.\n", "Q: How to scroll a table down to bottom I know that when you tap on the status bar on top, it will scroll the table all the way to the top.\nIs there a similar way that can scroll it all the way to the bottom?\n\nA: No, there is no built-in way to scroll to the bottom of a table. \nIt would be up to the developers to add that specific function to their table view. \n", "Q: Macbook restarts because of kernel panic Since a year ago my Macbook Pro (13-inch, late 2011, El Capitan) restarts and shows panic reports.

Did my friend blocked me?\n*i don't have his number, just his email.\n\nA: If your friend turned off iMessage or turned off Read Receipts, then you won't get the Read notification.  If they're using a beta of iOS 10, they can turn off Read Receipts for individual contacts.\nAlso, as you suggested, if the friend decided to block you, you won't see the notifications, either. \nEDIT: As indicated in the comments, you will see the Delivered notification even if Read Receipts has been turned off.  Edited answer to reflect that. \n", "Q: Apple Script : Remove space / line in variable I'm using applescript to collect a lost of number from a website, and my script is working fine, I just get a lot of space and a line between the result which I can't figure out how to get rid of.\nset numbersList to my getInputByClass2(\"sortable numPersonId\", 1)\n\n\nto getInputByClass2(theClass) \n    tell application \"Safari\"\n        set r to do JavaScript \"var outPut=[]; var arr=document.getElementsByClassName('\" & theClass & \"');for (var i in arr) {outPut.push(arr[i].innerHTML)};outPut;\" in document 1\n    end tell\n    return strings of r --- this remove all 'Missing Value' from a list of strings\nend getInputByClass2\n\nset goodresult to items 2 thru -1 of numbersList as string\n\nset theText to goodresult\nset {tid, AppleScript's text item delimiters} to {AppleScript's text item delimiters, \" \"}\nset temp to text items of theText\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to \" \" -- or use \" \" if you want to delete spaces\nset theText to temp as text\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to tid\n\nthe result will be :\n                                9990607901\n\n\n\n                                8228210011\n\n\n\n                                1555508116\n\nwhen I expect to have:\n 9990607901\n 8228210011\n 1555508116\nor 9990607901, 8228210011 ,  1555508116\n\nA: This isn't beautiful but it works-- you can probably clean it up.

I would like to be able to specify a time range, as it used to be possible prior to iTunes 12.4.x. I'm thinking of some kind of hidden plist setting.\n\nI know one can create smart playlists with a \"Date Added\" field, but that's not what I'm looking for: when choosing \"View as Albums\", there's no \"Sort by date added option\", which is what I'd need to replicate the recently added view.\n\nA: There is no way to change the default Recently Added criteria.\nAs you already discovered, you can make a Smart Playlist with a limited set of criteria, included Date Added.  However, iTunes doesn't allow a sort by Date Added when viewing as albums, unfortunately.\n", "Q: Facebook message notification showing blank message Since I updated the system to 10.11.5, the Facebook message notification is not showing message text.\n\nIs this a bug in this software upgrade of OSX?\n\nA: This change is not a result of your specific OS X version. The change is on the server end by Facebook as they control what data to send to your Mac and the reason the text isn't showing is the text is no longer sent. \nYou might contact Facebook support to see if they are aware of this change - perhaps it's unintentional or you can so figure the web app to send the extra data to your browser.\n", "Q: External monitor not detected with MacBook Pro I just got my MacBook Pro, and now I want to start using an external monitor hooked up to it.  The connection, from my MBP is an HDMI adapter to VGA, and then the VGA cord to my monitor.  So it's HDMI -> VGA (the monitor doesn't have an HDMI port).\nI go into displays and the monitor doesn't show up.  I hold down the option button and click Detect Displays but still nothing happens.\nThe cables are secure, and I know this HDMI -> VGA setup works (I connect my Raspberry Pi to this monitor using the same setup).\nIs there anything else I need to be doing?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: From Apple: Can the HDMI port drive analog displays (VGA displays, for example) using adapters?\n\nNo. The HDMI port will only drive digital connections (such as DVI)\n  using the adapter that came with the Mac. The HDMI port cannot be used\n  for analog displays such as VGA. You can purchase a Mini DisplayPort\n  to VGA adapter separately to drive analog displays.\n\nIn addition to the actual digital signal, an HDMI port has a few optional pins for legacy analog support. Apple doesn't bother sending an analog signal to HDMI, so an HDMI to VGA adapter receives nothing.\n", "Q: Why will my iPhone 5 not connect to the Internet through 4g but will on wifi My iPhone 5 will not connect to the Internet via mobile data but will on wifi ?

We want to migrate this install to our MacMini running the same exact OS and Server versions.\nWhat is the quickest and most efficient way to accomplish this?\nThanks,\nTony\n\nA: Tony, you might want to have a look at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202848\n\nMigrating your Server\nYou can migrate from OS X Server on Mavericks or Mountain Lion to another >computer using OS X Yosemite. Use the Setup Assistant or Migration Assistant >included with Yosemite to transfer your data before you open Server app.\nYou can migrate server data using one of the following methods:\nA server connected in Target Disk Mode\nA local hard drive or partition with OS X Server installed\nA local Time Machine backup of OS X Server\nMigrating over a network connection, either from an existing server or a Time >Machine backup, is not an available option for OS X Server.\nTo migrate your server:\nUse Setup Assistant on a new Mac, or open the Migration Assistant from the >Utilities folder.\nFollow the onscreen instructions. Select a supported connection method when >prompted.\nWhen migration is complete, download and install Server from the Mac App Store\nOpen the Server app and follow the onscreen instructions to complete\nthe server setup.\nIf you open Server app before migrating your server data, remove Server app >before migrating and then reinstall it after migration is done.\n\n\nA: Assuming the Mac Mini is compatible (the flat, all-aluminium ones are) the simplest way to move the whole server is do exactly that - copy the entire drive.\nGet Carbon Copy Cloner, reboot the Mini in Target Disk mode and connect it to the MacBook with a suitable cable. The Mini will appear as if it was an external drive.\nOpen Disk Utility and reformat the drive in the Mini.\nOpen Carbon Copy Cloner, select the MacBook's drive as source, the Mini's drive as destination, click clone and wait a bit. Reboot the Mini and it will be the same as your MacBook.\nYes, you can do this while the MacBook is running. Yes, you can copy the OS between machines. No, you don't need to install OS X before copying. \nThis used to be a 10-minute job - just pull the drive and install in the new machine. Modern construction makes that nearly impossible now.\nYou will have to adjust minor things like the Mini's IP address, but it doesn't take long to run through System Preferences and Server.\n", "Q: How to disable smart quotes in Outlook 2016 Same question, different version.

I have three monitors. I'd like to use a dock on each monitor that displays the apps / windows open on that monitor. Is this possible?\nThanks!\n\nA: Unfortunately, OS X does not support multiple docks running on multiple monitors simultaneously.\nAccording to Apple's support article:\n\nWhen the Dock is configured to appear at the bottom of your screen, it's available on whichever screen you’re working on. Just move your pointer to the bottom of either display. When the Dock is configured for the left or right position, it appears on the leftmost or rightmost display edge.\nTip: If you don't see your dock because it's set to hidden or there's a full screen app on the display, move your pointer to the location of the Dock. If the Dock still doesn't appear, swipe your pointer towards the Dock again to unhide it.\n\n", "Q: Ipad Mini 2 Warranty for Damage I bought my daughter her ipad for Christmas (7 months ago) and she dropped it the other day cracking the screen; you can actually see inside of it at the top. \nDoes this come with a manufacture warranty and will it cover accidental damage?\n\nA: AppleCare does not cover damage.  However, AppleCare+ covers up to two incidents of damage:\n\nAppleCare+ for iPhone Every iPhone comes with one year of hardware\n  repair coverage through its limited warranty and up to 90 days of\n  complimentary support. AppleCare+ for iPhone extends your coverage to\n  two years from the original purchase date of your iPhone(1) and adds\n  up to two incidents of accidental damage coverage, each subject to a\n  service fee plus applicable tax ($79 for iPhone SE or iPhone 6 or\n  earlier models, $99 for iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus).\n\nSo, if you don't have an AppleCare+ agreement, you will have to cover the damages out of pocket.\n", "Q: Adding a face in Photos I am running macOS El Capitan 10.11.5, and in Photos I am unable to add a face.

I am often on conference calls for work. I mute myself so the background noise is not a problem, and I hit the power button to turn off the screen and put the phone in my pocket. However, when it is time for me to talk I turn back on the screen and it does not show me the call in progress, it takes me to the home screen. I just want to be able to unmute, but I have to navigate back to the call in progress screen to do that. Is there a way to make it stop doing this?\n\nA: Putting your phone in your pocket triggers the proximity monitor. When the front of your phone gets close to an object during a phone call, the screen automatically shuts off to prevent accidental touch inputs from the phone being against your face. However, the phone is not actually off! When you take it out of your pocket and thus away from the nearby object (your leg) which it assumes is your face, the screen will turn back on automatically, without you having to press the power button. When the phone re-awakens after moving away from the nearby object, it will show you the last screen you were on: generally, and in your case, it will automatically open up the phone control screen where you can quickly unmute your microphone. \nHere's what you're doing wrong\nYou're pressing the power button. This closes the phone screen and takes you back to your home screen. How you can fix your issue: Just don't press the power button before you put the phone into your pocket, and it still will automatically shut off the screen, and don't press the power button when you take the phone out of your pocket; it will automatically come right back on to your phone call control screen, where you can unmute the call very quickly.\n\nDon't push the power button when you put your phone into your pocket, and don't push it when you take your phone back out.\n", "Q: Is there a way to list all available commands in terminal Is there a way to list all available commands in terminal? \nI know linux has compgen -c is there an equivalent command for OS X?\nUpdate:\nThe actual issue was that I was using zsh instead of bash. So from zsh, I could either just open bash or run a bash command from zsh bash -c \"compgen -c\"\n\nA: In zsh you need to enable the completion system. Please read through man zshcompsys. To install the completion system enter the command \ncompinstall\n\nand follow the directions.

Tap y and you'll be presented with a list.\nYou can do that same thing for individual commands to see all options for that specific command.  \n\nA: Like fd0 commented above, the best source for quickly listing most everything you can do in the Terminal, is by using the Bash builtin compgen.\nCompgen interfaces with the \"completion\" function in Bash, so it is intended to keep a list of most everything you can do in the shell.  So it is interesting that technically compgen is listing commands, aliases, and functions, as well as a few other things like builtins, variables, groups, jobs and service names.  My experience is that it will not list everthing, like applications typcially ran in the GUI, which I will mention below.  You can use the open command in OSX for quite a few things, for example.\ncompgen -c executes the command in a subshell environment, and its output is used as the possible completions, which is probably what you want. If Bash if your shell, it will spew out similar information for all commands or a single command if you press Tab Tab. \nIt's also common in OSX that many programs can be executed from the shell, so many program names that you'll find in /Applications can also be called via a CLI from the shell.  Similarly, many programs are (at least) at /Applications/Utilities, some interesting stuff is at /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications (as well as other things under the /System main directory...), and as well sometimes custom programs get put under the classic Unix locations like /usr/bin, usr/local/bin, /opt, and /sys/bin. \nOften you can find other interesting things to type, probably also covered above, by typing help or help [command or argument], with more information about most programs or builtins coming with info [command] or man [command]. Apropos is also quite interesting, which you may know already.  These things will get most everything, I imagine there are other things one just needs, or should, hack around and discover...\n\nA: While in Terminal, type Tab Tab. Then you'll see: \nDisplay all 1653 possibilities? (y or n).\nPress Y and it will list all possible commands\n\nA: (Tab, Tab) does the trick, but it only works on bash, if it doesn't work firstly just type 'bash' then (Tab, Tab) then you have an option of yes(y) or no(n) then you are fine.\n", "Q: Easy way to see a list of all the apps I have installed on my iPhone I'm looking for an easy way to see a list of all the apps that are currently installed on my iPhone (running iOS9).

I have several external hard drives.  They're consumer drives which \"go to sleep\" (spin down) automatically when unused; I can't (and don't want to) run them 24x7.  I use them strictly for backup and long-term storage.  \nVery often, I'll use some irrelevant feature of a program (like \"Undo\" in Microsoft Word on a doc that's on the main drive) -- the application will freeze, and I'll hear an external hard drive spin up.  (Or every single drive spin up, one at a time.)  Then the program will unfreeze.   The program does not seem to be bothered if I unmount the drives; it simply stops doing that. \nAnd I am wondering: What on earth is it looking for?  So I can figure out how to stop this annoyance.  For instance if it's tapping fonts it found on the external drive, I can make sure they're inaccessible inside ZIP files. \nMy question is: How can I have a persistent log of accesses to files by applications?

Its simplest invocation is:\n$ sudo opensnoop\n\nwhich will give you a live updating list of every file being accessed on the system. If you suspect a particular application, you can filter its output to show only what that application is doing:\n$ sudo opensnoop -n Word\n\n(IIRC it does partial but case-sensitive name matching, so \"Word\" will match \"Word\", \"MS Word\", \"Microsoft Word\", etc. but not \"word\".)\nOr you can use it to see what's accessing a particular file (example only, I've no idea if this is a real MS Word preference file):\n$ sudo opensnoop -f /Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.msword\n\nFor other options, see the man page.\n", "Q: macbook mid 2010 13\" won't recognise ssd crucial mx200 HD 500gb placed in the optical drive I have a macbook pro 13\" mid 2009 2,26GHz with HDD 160gb.

WTH?\nHow do I prevent Notification Center from calling up my browser? \n\nA: Clicking on the City Name will open the appropriate page from The Weather Channel in your default web browser. That is by design.\nIf you do not want to open the webpage and instead expand a panel showing the forecast for the city, click anywhere other than the city name (the blank space, the time, the temperature, etc.).\n\n", "Q: Mac mini wont shutdown I can't shutdown my Late 2012 Mac mini, running El Capitan, in the normal way, by selecting the Shut Down... on the Apple menu. Every time I try, Finder vanishes and the shutdown progress freezes. I'm still able to work with the Dock, so I can shutdown using Terminal. In long term it's really annoying.\nHopefully someone has an idea whats wrong.\n[EDIT] I just found out that im able to shut the system down by sign out and them use the displayed shutdown on the bottom.\n\nA: *\n\n*Close all Mac OS X apps before shutting down\n\n*Try to determine if one particular app is causing the problem. Maybe one app always aborts the shutdown process. Try updating to the latest version.\n\n*Open Disk Utility. Choose the your main hard drive and click Repair Disk.\n\n*Usefully shutdown freezes are caused by incompatible or outdated drivers e.g printer, scanner software. Open OS X activity monitor. Do you see any high cpu processes or unresponsive applications that are marked red?\n\nA: If you can acess terminal just do. \nsudo reboot\n\nor \nsudo shutdown\n\nthat should reboot or shut down your system. when using sudo it will ask for a password this is the same as when you login to your profile. \nHope this helps\n", "Q: No emergency alerts on iPhone I have \"Emergency Alerts\" enabled on my iPhone, but I do not receive alerts on it. Emergency alerts are enabled, but Amber alerts are off. I know that some alerts have gone out today because I have an older iPhone that doesn't have phone service but which does still receive emergency alerts. What do I need to do to get alerts on my regular phone? I tried turning them off and back on, but it didn't help.\nThe phone that doesn't get emergency alerts is an iPhone 6 using T-Mobile (USA) and running iOS 9.3.2. The one that does get alerts is an iPhone 4s running iOS 8.something, formerly used on AT&T and T-Mobile, but which doesn't have any current mobile service. Both phones connect to wifi at my house, if that matters.\n\nA: Apple support suggested the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable emergency alerts\n\n*Reboot the phone\n\n*Re-enable alerts.\n\n\nThis worked. I don't know why I wasn't getting them, but I get them now.\n\nA: I think so you need to update the iOS version in the software update setting, I have looked at the Wikipedia section of iOS version but couldn't find if the emergency alerts have been even added to update. In the Wikipedia section of iOS 9.3, it highlights(Yellow Color) that the update has been discontinued. I also think that iMessage should be updated on your iPhone. Other than that, I couldn't find any answers since I searched over T-mobile website and it does say \"iPhone 6\". I prefer calling the carrier service provider to giving more insight on how to solve the problem. Also restart your phone, to get the settings applied. If you still can't get the emergency alert, please refer to the Google Docs that I created, which allows the user from United States and Canada to get wireless emergency alerts(EAS & Alert Ready). The document will be updated weekly/monthly and it consists of two pages. It also shows how to look at past emergency alerts in phone. Read it entirely to get the accurate information. Here is the link: Alert Ready/EAS/WEA Notifications. \n\n\nA: I just found out if your iPhone or iPad is on mute and even though the alerts are on you won’t get them\n", "Q: Can't update a certain application on iOS 9.3.2 It isn't only on iOS 9.3.2, it's been happening since the later iOS 8 versions.  But for some reason, I haven't been able to update a certain app on my iPod 6th generation for a while now.\nThe app indicates that it's preparing for an update when I tap on update.  After a few seconds though, it reverts back to the update button.\nI've tried...\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting my device\n\n*Using \"update all\" instead of updating the app by itself.\n\n*Pressing on the update button several more times to see if it would begin updating.\n\n\nBut none of these have actually worked.\nAs said in the title, this only currently happens for one app.  All of the others work fine.\nIf anybody could help me with this, that'd be great.  This issue has been bothering me for a while now.\n\nA: *\n\n*Remove the corrupted iOS app from your iOS device ( be sure to backup data prior step 1)\n\n*Shutdown your iPhone/iPad\n\n*Restart iOS\n\n*Reinstall the app from the AppStore\n\n", "Q: iOS 9: How to disable Location Services for specific apps? It used to be obvious how to enable or disable Location Services on an individual app basis, but today when trying to do this on an iPad running iOS 9 I didn't see any way to do this.\nHas the feature been removed, leaving me no other way than to disable Location Services entirely? I just want to keep my photos from being geotagged. I still want to find my current location on maps and use other such features.\nAll the web searches I've done so far yield outdated how-to pages showing old methods.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You can still do that.\nAll you have to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opening Settings > Privacy > Location services\nNow here you can either disable/enable completely the location services, or limit the access to some of the Apps you choose, it's all up to you.\nThus, if you want to disable the geotagging in your photos and videos you'll want to disable the Camera option from this list.\nHope it helped you out!\n\nA: You have to enable Location Services and then disallow when the app prompts you (when you launch it). After doing this the app will appear in the list so you can turn it on or off.\nThis is true even for apps that are installed by default.\n", "Q: iPod nano 7th generation does not pair with any Bluetooth device My iPod nano 7th generation is giving a lot of trouble in pairing with other Bluetooth devices (headphones, car audio, speaker). I cannot even pair it with my iPhone. I turn on the Bluetooth option and just keep going and going looking for devices, I put them close together and nothing.\nAny solution?\n\nA: My scenario and fix:\nIpod Nano 7th gen paired previously with Jaybird X3 bluetooth headphones.\nAt some point the X3s stopped connecting with the Ipod (connection failed message from Ipod Nano)\nI chose to \"Forget this device\" in Nano interface in the hopes that would reset the connection after X3s were discovered again. No luck. In fact the X3s were not discoverable at all! Other devices were appearing in the Ipod Nanos BT discover screen..and X3s worked with another device via bluetooth.\nI reset the Ipod using menu select button and sleep/wake button for 6 secs.\nNo luck. \nRestored Ipod using the iTunes software from Apple. No change, X3s not found.\nAnd erased all data..\nWatched this YouTube on how to enter diagnostic mode on Ipod:\nFollowed the instructions. Narrator said to press all buttons simultaneously for 3 iterations...I think this is wrong and diagnostic mode will engage after apple logo appears on first try..\nOnce the Ipod was in Diagnostic mode I went through all menu items. I am not 100% sure how the system was repaired but I would definitely navigate to the BT test (bluetooth self-test) and run that.. there was also a DRAm self test but I doubt that test would result in any connectivity change.\nAfter rebooting the Ipod the X3 headphones immediately responded to pairing..\nI hope this helps :)\n\nA: Have you tried pairing it with other bluetooth devices? If not, I suggest you do so. If all else fails, then it's probably a hardware issue and you must ask for help from Apple. \n", "Q: iPad Air no sound, tried everything I bought my iPad Air 2 years ago, and it was fine until last week there is no sound. It's not muted. I can't play any video on the iPad no matter which apps I used, YouTube, Netflix, etc. I can't make a FaceTime call either, audio or video. When I opened Camera and switched to Video then it would hang and display a black screen. It also wouldn't connect to the Bluetooth speaker, as the device didn't show up in the list. I tried plugging in a headphone and there was no sound at all. When I opened the ringtone setting and tapped on some ringtone to hear some preview, the screen hangs a bit and then there was no sound at all.\nI tried everything: turn off and turn on, reset by pressing Home and power button, changed language, restore all settings in General Setting, restored as new iPad, and no improvement at all.\nUp to this point, I'm pretty sure this is a hardware issue.

I've checked all kinds of forums for a similar problem but no one seems to lead to a solution.\n\nA: I ended up taking the laptop to a Apple Store and they said that the hard drive bracket needed replacement. They agreed to do it for free since it is covered by the Apple Quality program. Apparently, the hard drive bracket is something that breaks in this model and Apple has the decency of repairing it for free despite being way out of warranty. One thing I will never know is why Windows performed well despite this hardware error. Anyway, my computer runs smoothly again, specially with the new SSD.\n\nA: The thing I would do is wipe the computer entirely (make a backup if you need) and then install the OS.\nIf you can't install a clean new OS on to an erased drive, you can know a hardware repair is needed. You can try installing the OS onto an external drive if that's faster than swapping the internal drive. Hardware repair is basically a process of:\n\n\n*\n\n*get a test you can run and fails consistently\n\n*change one thing\n\n*repeat the test until you know the one thing that caused the failure\n\n\nYou've got a great test in \"install the OS\" - and if you haven't wiped your preferences / account / changes - that's the next \"one thing\" I would change.

Also is cellular data the same as mobile data? Thanks \n\nA: No, you can not get a virus from an emoji as they are local to the iOS system and therefore not external. If you are referencing the iPhone bug from quite a while where the phone would restart after being sent a message then that was not a virus but instead a failure in the uni code support for certain joined characters in the notification center. This bug has been patched.\nYes, mobile and cellular data are the same. If you know someone who's phone says one of the two that is different than yours it is because iPhones use the most common language for this setting based the language is set for (aka. English, British English, Australian English, etc.).\n", "Q: BOOTCAMP no longer listed as Device in Finder, but can boot into it on startup How can I get BOOTCAMP to be listed under Devices in Finder so that I can go into it and view the files there?\nI can boot into BOOTCAMP as normal on startup but in OS X, Finder does not list BOOTCAMP. \nIt used to in OS X versions previous to OS X El Capitan, but I'm not sure exactly when it stopped showing and whether or not it's the OS X El Capitan upgrade or something else that caused the issue. \nHere is the screenshot showing that BOOTCAMP is not listed in Finder:\n\nDisk Utility shows the Macintosh HD and BOOTCAMP partitions, but only lists Macintosh HD on the left beneath the overall drive (Samsung 840 Pro SSD).

MBR updated. GPT is not. Understanding and fixing but did not follow it for same reason about specifics.\n\n\nPlease can I have advice on how to get BOOTCAMP to be shown in Finder.\n\nA: Solved - the answer is that Windows was in a hibernate state. I was able to take Windows out of this state and now BOOTCAMP appears. I will accept my own answer when I am allowed to. More details of solution below.\nI downloaded a trial of Paragon Disk Manager which showed the BOOTCAMP partition and provided an option to mount it. On attempting to mount, a dialogue popped up saying that the Windows operating system was in hibernate state and that it could not be mounted by accessing the partition by read-only operations; some write options would be required. I think an option was provided to proceed, but instead I decided to boot into Windows from start up as usual and attempt to fully and properly shut it down (as this is the least risky approach; better to get Windows to sort itself out regarding fully shut down and out of hibernate mode rather than from externally (i.e via an app in MacOS). There were some routine Windows updates ran but I don't think this is relevant. So after having shut Windows down. I started up into MacOS and can now see BOOTCAMP in finder. I don't work for Paragon or have any financial or otherwise interest in them, but the tool served a good purpose in that I could attempt to mount the partition which lead me to the solution.\nI've seen something like this with dual-boot Windows / Ubuntu (Linux) systems whereby Ubuntu warns of same message about Windows being in a hibernate state when attempting to mount the Windows partition. So from that I conclude that the issue is not rare (and fortunately remediable). Ubuntu warns that attempting to mount is risky as it means it would have to modify the partition in order to mount it. Again it's therefore better to boot into Windows and fully shut it down. Not really sure why Windows would ever be hibernate mode when shut down though, but a \"power cycle\" seemed to get it out of this mode and into a fully shut down state.\nSo that's solved. However as a separate perhaps unrelated point I am concerned about the gpt show: /dev/disk0: Suspicious MBR at sector 0 message seen when running sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 as stated above. Any tips would be welcome, but my machine functions perfectly fine so this does not appear to affect it but I'd like to resolve this message anyway - research so far doesn't give a definitive answer it seems, I may write another question.\n", "Q: Caller ID from iPad message shows \"Home\" When I send a text message from my iPad, which is synced to my iPhone, I see that the caller ID on the iPhone is \"Home\".  How can I ensure that text messages from my iPad show my name or phone number instead of home?\n\nA: It's not a \"Caller ID\" as it's not visible to anyone but you.\nIt's only shown on your iPhone because the phone number (or Apple ID) is in the Contacts of the device with the name set to Home. This means that messages received show the name of the sender pulled from Contacts, just like any other contact on the phone.\nIf you don't want this, delete the contact from your phone which contains the phone number, but this will delete it from all iCloud synchronised devices and can cause problems if it is your 'Me card' such as incorrect AutoFill information in Safari.\n", "Q: How can I buy something in German if I live in the U.S.?

I don't get all those options though.  I know the exact episode I purchased is available in German, since I previewed it in the German store, but I don't have these options.\nWhat can I do to get this in German?\n\nA: I live in the Netherlands and I am well able to buy from the German Store. My (original) iTunes Account is German, so there is no issue when I am in the German Store and logged in with the German Account.\nIt also works the other way around. Sometimes I want to buy things from the dutch Store. I have a second Account for this. When I switch the store, I also logout and login with the NL Account again.\nThe only catch: You need a valid payment method for each country. Otherwise I experienced no problem having a second account, nor location-based restrictions.\n(Disclaimer: I only tested this with Apps, which were not available in all regions.)\n\nA: It is up to the distributor of the video to choose which languages (dubs or subtitles) are installed for which market.

The pfctl.conf has been been confirmed to be working as expected because issuing sudo pfctl -ef /etc/pfctl.conf leads to the desired behavior (requests to one port get forwarded to the other). \nThat pfctl itself is actually loaded at startup is also confirmed because doing launchctl list | grep pf shows com.apple.pfctl in the output. However, the desired forwarding behavior is not achieved directly after startup. It happens only on doing pfctl -f /etc/pfctl.conf after startup. Oddly enough, the output of pfctl -ef /etc/pfctl.conf still says pf already enabled. \nTherefore, I concluded that while pf is loaded at startup, the daemon seems to not load from the conf file. The body of the launch daemon com.apple.pfctl.plist now looks like: \n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n     <key>Disabled</key>\n     <false/>\n     <key>Label</key>\n     <string>com.apple.pfctl</string>\n     <key>WorkingDirectory</key>\n     <string>/var/run</string>\n     <key>Program</key>\n     <string>/sbin/pfctl</string>\n     <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n     <array>\n         <string>/sbin/pfctl</string>\n         <string>-e</string>\n         <string>-f</string>\n         <string>/etc/pf.conf</string>\n     </array>\n     <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n     <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nHaving checked the discussion at \nGetting launchd to read program arguments correctly it was informative but not practically helpful in this instance - I have already tried editing the program arguments of the plist file to include the full path to the pfctl executable (as can be seen in the code above - first line of the arguments array) but to no avail. I have also added an argument (second line of arguments array) to actually launch pfctl based on the discussion at this gist. The daemon also seems to be configured correctly according to the instructions at Apple developer docs. In accordance to the developer docs (which state that the program tag is required when the program arguments are not supplied and vice versa), I also tried removing the program tag while leaving the program arguments array in place (with the path to the executable as the first argument) - but this had no effect either. \nPuzzlingly, the shipped version of the pfctl.plist file (which can be assumed to be most likely correct) had both the program tag and the program arguments tag, apparently in contradiction to the dev docs (or maybe I misunderstood the docs).\nSo now I am completely at a loss. Any help would be most appreciated!\nAdditional info:\nNot sure this is relevant, but just in case it is: the anchor file (created by me) which is referenced by pf.conf looks like:\nrdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to 127.0.0.1 port =80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8888  \n\nSo is there a possibility that the network interface is not yet active and addresses have not been assigned at the time the daemon runs?

Basically it shouldn't be a problem, especially as you are free to change the file group-membership to a single-user-group for your account only (if there were processes reading the file using default 4 permission for group, they would access now using the same permission for others).\nNevertheless, if you use Vagrant Hostmanager plugin, there are clear instructions how to remove the necessity to provide password at run-time, by adding some configuration to sudoers file:\n\nAdd the following snippet to the sudoers file (e.g. /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant_hostmanager):\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_HOSTMANAGER_UPDATE = /bin/cp <home-directory>/.vagrant.d/tmp/hosts.local /etc/hosts\n%<admin-group> ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_HOSTMANAGER_UPDATE\n\nReplace <home-directory> with your actual home directory (e.g. /home/joe) and <admin-group> with the group that is used by the system for sudo access (usually sudo on Debian/Ubuntu systems and wheel on Fedora/Red Hat systems).\nIf necessary, add yourself to the <admin-group>:\nusermod -aG <admin-group> <user-name>\n\nReplace <admin-group> with the group that is used by the system for sudo access (see above) and <user-name> with you user name.\n\n\nA: Alternatively: note what line should be added to the Hosts file, then use Textwrangler to edit the Hosts file: then the permissions are not changed.\n", "Q: Less space after moving files I got the \"startup disk full\" message so I moved several of my massive folders to an external hard drive, deleted the folders I just moved off my Mac and yes, emptied the Trash bin.\nIt then said I had 83.14 GB of free space (I previously only had two!)

How can I connect my iPad Air to an older Panasonic Viera TC-L37e3 to stream a YouTube video? What app do I need, if any?  Can I use a HDMI adaptor?\n\nA: I take a glance at Panasonic Viera TC-L37e3 manual and as I understood it has DLNA feature. Have you try to use it? Because there are several streaming apps for iPad working with DLNA devices (Infuse, nPlayer, ArkMC, VLC). They give you a possibility to wirelessly connect your iPad and TV.\nThe only problem is if they work with Youtube videos. I definitely know that ArkMC streams Youtube videos, but what about others, I doubt.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro will not boot, begins to load then hangs with white screen I am unable to get my MacBook Pro to boot. It turns on, and the Apple logo + loading bar appear however after a minute or so of loading it eventually changes to a white/grey screen and just hangs. \nThe machine is a 15-inch MacBook Pro from early 2011 running OSX 10.10.5. \nI have booted in verbose mode and I couldn't spot anything untoward however similar behavior was observed, just in verbose mode.\nI can get to a shell with cmd+s but I'm not too familiar with OS X so I'm not sure where to begin looking for hints about the failed boot.\nI tried to enter recovery mode by booting and holding alt and was able to get the screen up where you pick the recovery drive, but I experienced the same failed boot behavior as described above.\nPrior to all this the laptop had a bit of an episode where the video went very funny, top half of the screen at the bottom, and the bottom at the top with some horizontal bars of random colors, like colorful TV static... And it flashes a bit like this just before it hangs at boot... leading me to think it might be something video card related but this is my only clue so far...\nCan anyone help me as to where to go from here? Such as boot logs found from the command line, or diag commands I can run?\n\nA: This is a known issue - More about that here:  https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\nLuckily there's a free MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program.

You can always your change your system (UI) and input language or use multiple languages at the same time.\nIt doesn't matter where you buy your Mac. However please note, a German MacBook will include a German keyboard. Some local stores also sell english keyboards as well..\n", "Q: Is it possible to copy iPhone data to Mac using Xcode? I connected my iphone to a my friend Mac which running Xcode to debug an app. After plugging, I clicked \"Trust [this computer]\" and it took some time to detect the device in Xcode. While debugging, he opened a window which I saw my photos on my device and he switched back again to debug window. \nAfter fixing the app bug, I asked him to un-sync my device and he told me your data is just synced with itunes and when you unplug your device, I cannot see your data (photos) any more.\nActually, I am not convinced and I am thinking wherther he copied my iPhone data including my photos to his computer or not. I am sure he did not use iTunes during this process. \nCan anybody tell me it is possible to copy iPhone data to Mac during Xcode debugging?\n\nA: The window that popped up was probably the Photos app, that will typically auto start when a new device with photos is attached. Your friend did the right thing by closing it when he saw it happen. No copies of your photos would have been made at this time, only thumbnails were downloaded and those would be removed when Photos was closed.\nHe theoretically could have copied some data, but Xcode will not automatically copy anything sensitive, so unless he is a really sneaky 'friend' that set up his Mac to copy in the background in advance, I think you are probably OK.\n", "Q: Early 2011 Macbook Pro display crash In the last week I started seeing a serious issue with the display on my Macbook Pro (Early 2011, El Capitan) where the screen has gone \"crazy\".  I didn't apply any updates just prior to the issue, so I can only assume that something has changed for the worst.  The screen issues manifest themselves in several different ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Interlaced image.\n\n*Totally \"Blue\" screen (with alternate lines of differing blue)\n\n*Totall black screen (nothing showing)\n\n\nThis one example:\n\nThere have been different triggers for this behavior such as\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on an random link in Safari (especially one with images, or google maps) But not all the time as I am posting here on the system in question.\n\n*Plugging in a second monitor\n\n\nSometimes (if I am lucky) I can still see a mouse pointer and shutting down safari clears the issue.  At other times I am forced to power off blindly and at those times it can take 2 or 3 hard reboots to clear the issue an get to a working login screen.\nI would love this to be a purely software issue that I can fix by reloading El Capitan, but I am afraid the problem will be related to this question \nMacbook pro checkered display, safeboot works\nEDIT\nGood News Everyone!!\nIt turns out that there is a known issue with early 2011 Macbook Pro's displays and that Apple is going to replace the logic board for free.  This is outside of Apple Care.\nThis program will end sometime in the future (I did see 4 years after date of purchase mentioned on the Apple site), but even if you don't qualify for a fee replacement the cost of replacing the logic board is only in the order of $USD300 - a lot cheaper than a replacement laptop!\nEdit 2\nJust got an email from Apple containing in part:\nProposed Resolution: Replace logic board under quality program. \n\nRepair Estimate\nItem Number Description             Price       Amount Due\n661-6082    Board, Logic, 2.3 GHz   $ 567.05    $ 0.00  \nS1490LL/A   Hardware Repair Labor   $  39.00    $ 0.00  \nTotal (Tax not included)            $ 606.05    $ 0.00\n\n\nA: This is kind of related to macbook pro refuses to boot recover hangs at white screen and question and MacBook Pro will not boot, begins to load then hangs with white screen\nIts hardware related.

For example, when I set the Documents folder in my user folder to \"Sort by: Kind\", it also sets the sorting option for every other folder on my computer. Can I have unique folder sorting options? Or is it impossible? \nEDIT: This is on El Capitan.\n\nA: Indeed, unique sort order is possible. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open a new Finder window for e.g. Documents and \n\n*Go to View > Show View Options or hit Command + J. \n\n*Define your Sort order. That's it. Close the window\n\n*Repeat the step for every window. This way you can define the Sort order for every Finder window.\n\n\nA: You said: “There is no button labeled \"Use As Defaults\" on my version of OS X.\"\nBut there is, or should be.\nOpene diskUtility, select your disk and hit the FirstAid tab: it will correct the permissions; then restart the mac.

As you can see from the screenshot below, DND is not enabled at all. What could be causing DND to automatically enable? I am running El Capitan\n\n\nA: I solved this by editing com.apple.notificationcenterui.<guid>.plist and setting dndEnd and dndStart to zero.\n", "Q: List of Macbook Pro's with user replaceable parts After finding out that my 2011 macbook pro is slowly dying I am now thinking about its replacement.  However I would prefer an updated macbook pro in which I can replace both the hard drive and RAM.\nSo is there a current, simple list somewhere that identifies the year/model of a macbook pro and what parts are easily user1 replaceable?\n1. [Pedantic mode on] And by user replaceable I mean only with something like a screwdriver.  I am not looking to de-solder/solder items.[Pedantic mode off]\n\nA: All new Retina MacBook Pro models don't have user serviceable parts. You can still buy a non-retina MBP which do have user serviceable parts. I believe the latest model is Mid-2012. It is a bit old but it is the only MBP that you can change components without the need to solder things.\n\nA: You can't upgrade the RAM on any of the Retina MacBook Pro, but you can upgrade the storage on some of them, even if Apple says that there are no user serviceable parts. But not on any of the current models.\nOf course, Apple won't cover defects on the replaced parts and they might have restrictions on the coverage of an equipment still under warranty. If you are still covered, you should check that first.\nOther World Computing and iFixit have good guides on how to replace parts of MacBook Pro. Other World Computing even tests and certifies the parts they sell. \n\nA: iFixit is a pretty decent place where you can find replacement parts and installation/teardown guides. You cannot replace RAMs in all Retina MBP. You can technically replace SSDs in them but the replacement part is very expensive because they use propriety PCIE connector. (OWC sells SSDs for Macs but they are very expensive and only for early models).\nI would suggest buying and selling your Mac second hand rather than replace these because Mac do actually retain value better than Windows Laptops. I sold my MBP though Swappa when I needed an upgrade. It's usually cheaper and safer than upgrades as Macs are notorious for user upgradability.\n\nA: To add to the ifixit.com answer ... every new mac system is rated for \"ease of repair\" on a scale of 1 through 10.  Retina systems generally get 1 of 10 (you are not even supposed to open the case), while the 2011 systems overall are bit better because you can actually open the case and change RAM/disk/fans/etc.\n", "Q: In the Terminal preferences, what does the \"Use Style for \"Copy\" Command\" option do? Sorry if this is a bit of a newbie question, but I couldn't find it by googling.\n\nA: It's for the visualization purposes. For example here are two different paste styles form my Terminal:\n\nAs You see, they look differently when pasted into for example TextEdit app.\n\nA: It sets the style for copied text for any terminal profiles.\nYou can only set for one profile \"Use Style for ”Copy“ Command” under the gear icon, and then text copied from terminal window of any profile will use the set profile's style. E.g., if you set if for Ocean profile, text copied from Grass profile will have blue instead of green background.\n", "Q: ipad & iphone have been compromised Please help me.

Clicked on it & found my email accounts & Twitter.\n\nThat's normal. you are supposed to have a record in Contacts that identifies you.\nIt is highly unlikely that your phone has been compromised.

This caused BootCamp Assistant to fail to partition the hard drive because it did not believe that it would work with a hard drive of this size, although the bug in question had already been patched.\nTo resolve this, the partition was created in Disk Utility. Contrary to what most sites dictate, the Windows partition was not in the first 2.2TB of the hard drive and was not formatted as FAT. This is because it was deleted and recreated as a valid format upon installing Windows. Note that this did not work first time in this case, with Windows giving an error. If this occurs, just delete the partition again (still from the Windows installer) and create a new one. Before doing any of this, all data should be backed up, as if one of the steps fails, it may wipe your data.\nThe install disk was created with BootCamp like usual.\nEdit:\nRunning diskutil list outputs:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            2.5 TB     disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:         Microsoft Reserved                         16.8 MB    disk0s4\n   5:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                500.2 GB   disk0s5\n/dev/disk1 (external, physical):\n   ...\n\nRunning sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 outputs:\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         PMBR\n           1           1         Pri GPT header\n           2          32         Pri GPT table\n          34           6         \n          40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n      409640  4881805104      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  4882214744     1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  4883484280         392         \n  4883484672       32768      4  GPT part - E3C9E316-0B5C-4DB8-817D-F92DF00215AE\n  4883517440   977014784      5  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7\n  5860532224         911         \n  5860533135          32         Sec GPT table\n  5860533167           1         Sec GPT header\n\nRunning sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 outputs:\nDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 97451/255/63 [1565565872 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 - 4294967294] <Unknown ID>\n 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n\n", "Q: 18GB of Other storage I bought the game Wargame: European Escalation a while back off Steam and went to uninstall it today. I deleted it, but now my storage is filled with  18GB of \"Other\". I am on El Capitan version 10.11.1. How do I remove this? Thanks.\n\nA: Perform a scan of your hard drive with the tool Grand Perspective. With that (a free tool), you can easily see what exact files and data are eating up space, as well as where they are in your file tree. Then, it'll be easy to root out and delete what you don't want.\n\nA: “Other” storage simply includes everything that doesn’t fit into pre-existing categories. This includes browser cache, cached email messages & attachments, iTunes backups, notes, voice memos, call history, etc.\nHere i found an article explained in detail what's is \"Other\" on iPhone, and how to clear up \"Other\", you should have a look: mysterious “Other” on iPhone.\n", "Q: Utility like Compost for El Capitan I recently upgraded my Mac from Snow Leopard to El Capitan. I had been using a utility called Compost, which automatically deletes anything that has been in the trash more than a configured amount of time (also there are lots of other options, like if the disk is more than n% full). It doesn't seem to be working any more. The preference pane still works (although it's a 32-bit pane so it requires an annoying reload of System Preferences), and I can see the process running in Activity Monitor, but files aren't getting deleted.\nUnfortunately, the developer stopped maintaining it several years ago. Anyone know of something similar that works in El Cap?\n\nA: *\n\n*After doing a quick google search, a user from MacRumors mentioned Hazel, which has this feature, although pricy at $32\n\n*TrashTimer is a free alternative app, works straight from the preference pane.\n\n*Or, for the DIY-er, this discussion on the Apple Communities forums has two answers, one by twtwtw, and one by Tony T1.\n\n\ntwtwtw's answer uses an Applescript and a launchd plist file to automatically  execute the script at midnight. The files in trash then gets today's date written into the comments section, and if the date matched is older than x days, deleted. TL;DR: File is deleted depending on the date written in the comments section of file. \nTony T1's answer uses only a plist file in the launchd, and it deletes files based on the created date. Tony T1 also adds this: \n\nNotes:\n       -- I use -mindepth 1 -prune, so that if a FOLDER is in the Trash, every file in the folder is deleted (-R), (even is it is less than 7 days old -- good for App bundles).\n       -- Some files might not be deleted if srm has an error (for example, write protected files owned by another user)\n       -- This only handles the Users Home Trash.  If you have attached drives, adjust accordingly.\n\nSidenote for a fix for Tony T1's answer\nAlternative to Compost – MacRumors forum\nApple Communities discussion\n\nA: It is not available anymore and it is certainly not compatible.\nIn general I don't advise to use such \"tools\" at all.\nIf you are working on your mac what is easier then look at the Trash bin and empty it from time to time?\nIf you do not have enough space to have some files in your Trash bin, you are already too low on free space anyway....\n", "Q: Macbook cannot find Magic Keyboard in Settings - Keyboard - configure bluetooh keyboard I have paired the wireless Apple keyboard with my MacBook and I am writing this on the new keyboard. The problem is, I can't configure it in the settings. \"No keyboard found\"?\nI want to set the wireless keyboard's language to English and keep MacBook's keyboard as German. Currently I must switch the language via menu bar. \nSo… Is it even possible to have two different keyboards with two different languages at the same time? \nHope anyone has got a solution.
