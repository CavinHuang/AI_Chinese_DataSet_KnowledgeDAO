["Q: Is unity just a plugin of compiz I have read that unity would be a plugin of compiz. Does it mean that when I uncheck Unity from the CCSM menu, I would be greeted with Conventional Gnome or may be Gnome shell.\n\nA: The version of Unity that will be released in 11.04 is definitely implemented as plugin(s) in Compiz. (I've seen it with my own eyes...) This is described in a little detail in the blueprint on Launchpad.\nIt will also certainly be possible to use convential GNOME or the GNOME Shell, though perhaps not in the manner you describe disabling the plugin. It is more likely to be an option at the login screen (if you have it installed).\n\nA: No.\nCompiz is a compositor. It manages how windows are displayed within the X server. A side effect of this is it can do fancy things with windows and the desktop (which is essentially another window). At its core, Compiz doesn't actually do that much interactive stuff, rather handling things for other applications. \nIt isn't even a window decorator (though it does control which windows are decorated and by what).\nUnity is a shell. It's just an application that lets you use your computer. It's like the standard panels... obviously it works differently but it has much the same role.\nThe confusion between Unity and compiz comes from Unity requiring a heavy compositor to do many of its fancier effects. But Unity is discrete and essentially it wouldn't need to be compiz that handles the effects.... That will be especially true if/when Wayland comes along with its own built-in compositor. \n\nA: Despite the fact that Oli is being marked down, he is mostly correct.  Unity is a Desktop Environment--a shell. Compiz is a compositing manager (http://www.compiz.org/) which can also be used as a window manager.  There has been some talk about new releases of Unity being implemented as a Compiz plugin, but I'm not sure that is any more than semantics.  \nIn fact Unity only recently switched from Mutter to Compiz (http://www.webupd8.org/2010/10/unity-to-use-compiz-instead-of-mutter.html).\nhttp://ubuntulinuxtipstricks.blogspot.com/2008/12/compiz-emerald-metacity-what.html contains further information about what is what.\n", "Q: Orkut (GMail)- Google Talk Chat Program I am new to ubuntu, and can't find Google talk for ubuntu, How can I use chat on orkut.com which uses GMail sign in programme and I use Google talk to chat on windows.\n\nA: You can use Yahoo chat with Empathy. Simply go to Edit->Accounts then click 'Add...' and choose Yahoo as the protocol. You need to enter your Yahoo account details.\n\n\nA: Empathy has Google Talk support. Start Empathy, click Edit -> Accounts, then Add. Choose Google Talk from the Protocol list.\n\nA: I think Pidgin can do Yahoo Group Chat.\n", "Q: Is ~/.profile sourced by bash? I'm trying to create a global counter variable to see how many times ~/.profile gets executed. Thus:\nIn ~/.bashrc:\n# ... \nif [ \"$PROFILE_EXEC_TIMES\" = \"\" ]; then\n export PROFILE_EXEC_TIMES=0\nfi\nlet \"PROFILE_EXEC_TIMES += 1\"\n\nIn ~/.profile:\n# ... \nexport PROFILE_EXEC_TIMES\nlet \"PROFILE_EXEC_TIMES += 1\"\n\nBut when I open a new shell and write echo $PROFILE_EXEC_TIMES, all I get is 1.  $PROFILE_EXEC_TIMES must be at least 2. I suspect that ~/.profile isn't sourced by bash... if so, what I need to do in order to check how many times ~/.profile is executed?\n\nEdit:\nI've noticed that /etc/gdm/Xsession is sourcing ~/.profile by the following line:\ntest -f \"$HOME/.profile\" && . \"$HOME/.profile\"\n\nand ~/.bashrc is sourced in ~/.profile by the following lines:\n# if running bash\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # include .bashrc if it exists\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n    . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\nfi\n\nAlso, I've add the following line to ~/.bashrc & ~/.profile:\necho $(cd ${0%/*} && echo $PWD/${0##*/}) >> /home/myUserName/a\n\nand could see that only one line was added to the file after I logged in to my user. \nI want to emphasize that my goal here is:\nFinding out how many times ~/.profile is executed when user logs in.\nAdditional details:\n$ uname -a\nLinux my-desktop 2.6.32-25-generic #45-Ubuntu SMP Sat Oct 16 19:52:42 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n$ cat /etc/*-release\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=10.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=lucid\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*My /etc/gdm/Xsession\n\n*My ~/.bashrc\n\n*My ~/.profile\n\nA: From your comments on my original answer, it appears that your real question is \"Is ~/.profile sourced by GNOME?\" The answer is yes. Look in /etc/gdm/Xsession:\n# First read /etc/profile and .profile\ntest -f /etc/profile && . /etc/profile\ntest -f \"$HOME/.profile\" && . \"$HOME/.profile\"\n# Second read /etc/xprofile and .xprofile for X specific setup\ntest -f /etc/xprofile && . /etc/xprofile\ntest -f \"$HOME/.xprofile\" && . \"$HOME/.xprofile\"\n\n\nOriginal Answer\nFrom the manpage of bash:\n\nWhen bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a\n  non-interactive shell with the --login\n  option, it first\n  reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that\n  file exists.  After reading that file,\n  it looks for\n  ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and\n  reads and executes commands from the \n  first  one\n  that  exists  and is readable.\n\nSo you may have a file called .bash_profile or .bash_login in your home directory. If either of these exists, bash will use it instead of .profile.\n\nA: First, if you want to watch what's going on in a shell script, put set -x at the top (just after the #! line if any). This prints a trace of the execution on standard error. Here the shell's standard error should be redirected to ~/.xsession-errors.\nThere's a contradition in your question: you say your goal is “finding out how many times ~/.profile is executed when user logs in”, and then you go on to hack with .bashrc. Merely putting export PROFILE_EXEC_TIMES; let \"PROFILE_EXEC_TIMES += 1\" in your .profile does count how many times it's sourced, and it's unsurprising that the result is 1 (you only log in once).\nYour .profile sources .bashrc, which is weird as .profile is used when logging in and .bashrc is the configuration file of bash when it's interactive. Maybe you did this to work around a design bug in bash, whereby it doesn't read .bashrc in a shell that is both a login shell and interactive; I prefer to have a .bash_profile that sources both .profile and (if the shell is interactive) .bashrc.\nNote that your .profile takes care not to source .bashrc if the shell isn't bash. This explains why .bashrc isn't read when you log in: /etc/gdm/Xsession is executed by /bin/sh, which on Ubuntu 10.04 is dash, not bash.\nNear the top of .bashrc, you have: “If not running interactively, don't do anything” commenting the line [ -z \"$PS1\" ] && return. Actually, that line won't do this; it's fairly common for PS1 to be set in non-interactive shells (for example, it's set by /etc/profile). A reliable test for an interactive bash is [[ $- = *i* ]].\nYou may also be interested in Difference between .bashrc and .bash_profile.\n\nA: @Dor: I dont have enough reputation yet to write comments, but i can answer you last comment from Dec 7 '10 at 12:41, which was:\n\"When I append the code to both files & log into GNOME, there's still a single line in the file Xsession.log (the file Xsession.log is empty before each logon). Why's that? There should be at least two lines in the latter case.\"\nNo, because when you logon in Gnome (using GDM), ~/.bashrc is NOT executed, only ~/.profile. As explained by Gilles, Gnome calls /etc/gdm/Xsession, which in turn sources ~/.profile. And ~/.profile ONLY sources ~/.bashrc if running bash.\nFrom ~/.profile:\n# if running bash\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # include .bashrc if it exists\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n    . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\nfi\n\nAnd when you login in Gnome/GDM, you are not using Bash, because, as Gilles also pointed out,  /etc/gdm/Xsession has uses the directive #! /bin/sh, which in Ubuntu is a symlink to dash, not bash.\nSo the whole Gnome login process does not invoke bash. That why files like /etc/profile, ~/.bash_login, ~/.bash_profile are not automatically called. Thats why /etc/profile and ~/.profile had to be \"manually\", explicitly sourced by /etc/gdm/Xsession. And they both test for Bash before sourcing ~/.bashrc\nThe test on \"is interactive shell\" in /etc/profile (and also on ~/.bashrc) may be flawed, but the bash test works, and it return false when logging in. Thats why your log file has only 1 line... thats from ~/.profile\nWhen you open a terminal, its a bash terminal. Bash itself calls ~/.bashrc directly, and ~/.profile is not executed.\nI hope now everything has cleared up.\nLast but not least: Do not source ~/.profile from ~/.bashrc, as suggested by previous answer. That will cause a circular reference (both files source each other), and is both technically and conceptualy wrong. It may cause problemns if bash is ever used for login (maybe text mode, repair console?)\n\nA: ~/.profile is only executed for login shells (bash --login), not all shells, thats what ~/.bashrc is for. So the count of 1 should be correct, as ~/.profile is executed once when you login.\nIf you don't trust the environment variable counter just write a file with a unique filename (something like $(uuidgen)) to keep track of the ~/.profile executions.\n\nA: Are you sourcing .profile in .bashrc? If not, Bash won't read it. You should have something like this, probably best placed at the top of your .bashrc:\n[ -r ${HOME}/.profile ] && . ${HOME}/.profile\n\nThat will make sure that .profile both exists and is readable, and if it is than process it.\n", "Q: Can I use every .deb file, whatever my Ubuntu version or architecture? Sometimes I want to download programs that are not proposed in the Software Center but only on the developer's website, like for example World of Goo Demo. But the website proposes only one .deb download link usable by Ubuntu.\nIs it possible for me to use this file, even if I use an old version of Ubuntu or an architecture that still remains more or less exotic, as a 64-bit one? If yes, can I encounter any difficulties running the program, once installed?\n\nA: I encountered the following two errors when trying to install .deb files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wrong architecture\n\n*Unmet dependencies\n\n\nSo no, sometimes if you want to install a Jaunty Package in Maverick (for example) it won't install, because it depends on an OLDER Version of a package than the Version available in Maverick. (however, there are tools to change dependecies-list within a deb file...)\nI don't know about the architecture problem, as normally a 64-bit system should support 32bit binaries (however, I don't think it works the other way around)\n\nA: For cases where a software publisher provides deb files for their own software as downloads on their website, usually you see one of these two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The downloads page has a separate deb file for each release of Ubuntu (or possibly Debian). If you use one of the many derivative distributions of Ubuntu (or Debian), you'll need to figure out which Ubuntu or Debian version yours is based on.\n\n*There is only a single deb file for download. This file will typically be crafted to work on all recent versions of Ubuntu or Debian. It may do this by including specific versions of all of the libraries that the program needs in the deb, instead of using the system libraries, whose versions will be different in each Ubuntu release.'\n\n\nEither way, you're ok as long as you have a recent release of Ubuntu.\nThis does not mean that you can install any deb file that you just found on the internet somewhere. As long as you use GDebi or Software Center to install the deb, it should prevent you from installing deb packages that are not compatible with your version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: There is no problem in installing .deb files that are not made directly for a specific Ubuntu version, however there can be some dependencies there can't be satisfied.\nArchitecture on the other hand can be problematic. x86-64 machines can run x86-32 binaries but not the other way around. The package manager will not let you install packages of the wrong architecture unless you force it.\ndpkg -i --force-architecture file.deb\n\nI can't recommend that you do this though.\n\nA: Yes you can AFAIK, Linux mint, debian, ubuntu and other flavors all would accept the .deb file.\n", "Q: FOSS Conference calling software I have so far been using Skype to do conference calls on Ubuntu Maverick.

I have the issue that sometimes when I burn an iso image to a CD-R with:\nsudo wodim -v driveropts=burnfree -data dev=/dev/scd0 input.iso\n\nAnd then read it back out again with:\nsudo dd if=/dev/cdrom of=output.iso\ndd: reading `/dev/cdrom': Input/output error\n...\n\nThat I end up with two iso images that are not identical, namely the output.iso is missing 2048 bytes at the end. When I however mount the iso image or CD-R and compare the actual files on the mountpoint, both are identical.\nIs that expected behavior or is that an actually incorrect burn of the data? And if its expected, how can I verify that the burn process was successful?\nThe reason why I ask in the first place is that it seems to be reproducible behavior, certain iso images come out 2048 bytes short, even on repeated burns, but all burned CD-Rs are under themselves identical.\nAlso what is the reason behind the:\ndd: reading `/dev/cdrom': Input/output error\n\nAs it happens always, I assume it is normal, but what is the technical reason behind it? I assume CDs don't allow the device to detect the size directly, so dd reads till it encounters the end the hard way.\nEdit: User karol on superusers.com mentioned that both the size issue and the read error are the result of using -tao (default) in wodim instead of -dao mode. I couldn't yet test it, but it sounds like the most plausible explanation so far.\n\nA: Indeed, it's probably padding. Check the file sizes, is output.iso slightly larger?\nLook at the very end of output.iso:\ndd if=output.iso bs=1 seek=658562000 count=1071 | hexdump -C\n\nI'm guessing zeros?\nYou can try running ls -l input.iso to get its exact size, then:\ndd if=output.iso bs=1 count=<INPUT.ISO SIZE> | md5sum\n\nNote that this will be pretty slow since you're reading one byte at a time. If the size is evenly divisible by an integer, substitute that integer for the 1 in bs=1 and divide the count by that number. Even 2 bytes at a time will be much faster!\nAs to your second question, the Input/output error happens when dd hits the end of the device. Nothing to worry about.\n\nA: This problem might be related to your using dd. Try adding conv=direct when you use dd to read the disc, i.e.:\nsudo dd if=/dev/cdrom of=output.iso conv=direct\n\nThat tells dd to use O_DIRECT for its I/O, bypassing the kernel block layer. (Normally the block layer reads in 4KB chunks even if the calling program requests less. Maybe that was the cause of the error half the time, for discs with an odd number of sectors???)\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu on a headless machine?

You can see the current settings by running xmodmap -pke\nEach keycode (which is a value associated with every key on your keyboard) can have up to 8 keysyms (which is essentially the output) attached to it. They are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*When pressed on its own\n\n*When pressed with shift\n\n*When pressed with Mode switch enabled (seems to be obsolete)\n\n*When pressed with Mode switch and shift (seems to be obsolete)\n\n*When pressed with Alt-Gr (aka ISO_Level3_Shift in xmodmap terms)\n\n*When pressed with Alt-Gr and shift\n\n\nSo currently my \"h\" key looks like:\nh H h H hstroke Hstroke\nwhere the Hstroke keysym produces Ħ.\nUnless you're using Alt-Gr to input non-ascii characters, you could remap h, j, k and l with Alt-Gr to do what you want. This would be:\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 43 = h H h H Left Hstroke'\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 44 = j J j J Up J'\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 45 = k K k K Down ampersand'\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 46 = l L l L Right Lstroke'\n\nThe Alt-Gr with shift entries aren't strictly necessary of course, I'm just preserving the values that already exist. You can find the keycode values by running the xev command from a terminal. xev displays X events, so you can press a key and find out information about it.\nTo make this setting permanent, you can add the following to .Xmodmap in your home directory\nkeycode 43 = h H h H Left Hstroke\nkeycode 44 = j J j J Up J\nkeycode 45 = k K k K Down ampersand\nkeycode 46 = l L l L Right Lstroke\n\nPressing Alt-Gr certainly isn't as nice as pressing Alt when using hjkl, but you I think you may struggle getting just Alt to work because it is used for menu access. You may be able to use the information in this answer along with the tools mentioned by Fraekkert to bind e.g. Alt-Shift-h instead, which may suit you better.\nIt's also possibly worth noting that you can set vi mode in bash (or whichever shell you use) by using set -o vi. This gives you vi like behaviour when editing command lines and history. I don't believe this looks at your .vimrc though, so don't expect your key remappings to work.\n\nA: I would use a combination of the Keyboard Shortcuts preference pane and xvkbd. \nxvkbd allows you to send keyboard-events through command line, and Keyboard Shortcuts allows you to bind command lines to key events.\n", "Q: Mono apps won't start because they can't load certain assemblies here's the output after trying to run banshee from terminal:\njayjay@jayjay-desktop:~$ banshee\n\n** (/usr/lib/banshee-1/Banshee.exe:7909): WARNING **: The following assembly referenced from /usr/lib/banshee-1/Banshee.Services.dll could not be loaded:\nAssembly: glib-sharp (assemblyref_index=11)\nVersion: 2.12.0.0\nPublic Key: 35e10195dab3c99f\nThe assembly was not found in the Global Assembly Cache, a path listed in the MONO_PATH environment variable, or in the location of the executing assembly (/usr/lib/banshee-1/).\n\n\n** (/usr/lib/banshee-1/Banshee.exe:7909): WARNING **: Could not load file or assembly 'glib-sharp, Version=2.12.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=35e10195dab3c99f' or one of its dependencies.\n\n** (/usr/lib/banshee-1/Banshee.exe:7909): WARNING **: The following assembly referenced from /usr/lib/banshee-1/Banshee.Services.dll could not be loaded:\nAssembly: NDesk.DBus (assemblyref_index=14)\nVersion: 1.0.0.0\nPublic Key: f6716e4f9b2ed099\nThe assembly was not found in the Global Assembly Cache, a path listed in the MONO_PATH environment variable, or in the location of the executing assembly (/usr/lib/banshee-1/).\n\n\n** (/usr/lib/banshee-1/Banshee.exe:7909): WARNING **: Could not load file or assembly 'NDesk.DBus, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=f6716e4f9b2ed099' or one of its dependencies.\n\nStacktrace:\nNative stacktrace:\nbanshee-1() [0x80c9774]\nbanshee-1() [0x80f5753]\n[0xb783d40c]\nbanshee-1() [0x80893db]\nbanshee-1() [0x8061698]\nbanshee-1() [0x8062e78]\nbanshee-1() [0x806374f]\nbanshee-1(mono_runtime_exec_main+0xde) [0x8103e9e]\nbanshee-1(mono_runtime_run_main+0x15a) [0x810461a]\nbanshee-1(mono_main+0x18c4) [0x80b2744]\nbanshee-1() [0x805ad75]\n/lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xe7) [0xb75b9ce7]\nbanshee-1() [0x805acb1]\n\nDebug info from gdb:\nCould not attach to process.

When I go to System -> Preferences -> About me, I am able to give all sorts of informations, like my name, my e-mail address, an avatar, et cætera.\nWhat is it made for?\n\nA: If you change your login screen to list users instead of making you type in your username, it'll show the avatar you set next to your name.  It'll also show your real name instead of your username if you set it in there.  I think this real-name-versus-username thing also affects the Me Menu (at least, it affected the equivalent applet a few releases ago...).  As ayan4m1 mentioned, you can change your password there, too.  Finally, I think some of this data is auto-filled-in in your Evolution address book if you set it here.\n\nA: It seems there are several ubuntu brainstorms on this subject. About Me is a simple way to store a bunch of common personal information. It is part of GNOME. Some people no doubt use it in hopes that if their laptop is lost, someone may use the information to contact them. I believe it also allows users to change their password, which is essential if they are not an administrator and do not have access to the Users and Groups control panel item. As far as I can tell, no applications have programmatic access to the information fields in About Me.\n\nA: There was a plan to simplify the About Me window so that it would only be used by the Me Menu, but I don't know what happened to it.\n\n\nA: They put it their for an LDAP server to use.\nOr that other one Active Directory used by the Bad Guys\nObviously not the window it self but the data in the file.\n", "Q: How do I complete the Gnome Character Map with missing Unicode characters? I often use the Gnome Character Map accessory to find characters I didn't know, with a view to surprising friends with exclusive drawings. However the program is not complete and lacks some characters like the Mongol or the Birman ones.\nHow do I install all of them in one time? Notice that I don't care what precise font it is.\n\nA: The program seems complete (at least, it lists the Mongolian script/codepage).  But I don't have a font installed that includes those glyphs, maybe that's what you mean?  You might have to find a font that includes these.\nI think the ttf-unifont package contains most glyphs, but not necessarily beautiful ones, and they don't show up correctly in scripts where letters look different depending on their location inside a word etc.\nIf you want better quality glyphs, it might be a good idea to install a specialized font for that script and/or language, e.g. ttf-manchufont for Mongolian, or ttf-sil-padauk for languages from Myanmar/Burma.\n\nA: Please note that the Unicode character range is immense; There is no one font that covers all of it (although GNU FreeFont comes pretty close).\nIf you see empty spaces, or even empty pages, it may be because they just haven't been assigned yet. Those will remain empty until the Unicode Standard utilises them. Even though there is space for 1,114,111 glyphs, but only specific ranges have characters assigned to them, and between those ranges, there may be quite a bit of unused room.\nYou can get great coverage with the following fonts; Between them, they cover as much of Unicode as is practically usable:\n\n*\n\n*Linux Libertine (my favourite, → project site)\n\n*Droid (includes droid-fallback for cjk support)\n\n*WenQuanYi Zen Hei (focus on Chinese)\n\n*GNU Freefont (best coverage of any free-as-in-freedom font)\n\n(click these links to install the fonts on your Ubuntu system)\n\n\n(source: fontscape.com)\nLinux Libertine is one that, on top of covering a massive span of Unicode, looks excellent and has fantastic kerning and hinting.\n\nAlso, if you don't mind a non free font, there is Code2000, Code2001 and Code2002, which, between them, cover quite a substantial chunk of the Unicode range (97% I think) as well.\nFor a list of Unicode fonts and their coverage, see  Unicode Typeface.\n", "Q: Missing CD Quality, Lossy profile in Preferred Formats in RhythmBox Good evening all, \nI am having a problem with RhythmBox on Ubuntu 10.10.  I freshly installed Ubuntu almost a week ago and everything was great right off the bat.  However, tonight I am having a small issue.  In RhythmBox, I went into the Preferences section and went to check the quality level of the the CD Quality, Lossy profile (the ones that uses ogg) and it is missing from the Preferred Formats list.  If I click the Edit button, I see it in the list of available profiles along with many others and it is set to active.  Why would it not be in the Preferred Formats list, and more importantly, how could I get it back in the Preferred Formats list so I can rip a CD with it?  Just as a side note, RhythmBox is playing ogg files without problem.\nThanks for any help anyone can provide!\n\nA: I found the answer.

I doubt my keystroke was wrong. I am not sure what I pressed. Something wrong went from there. **\nI thought a restart would clear the problem, but it didn't.

Instead of spending time debugging them all, your quickest solution is to create a new user and move over your document files. The other option is to try and reset the options for gnome:\nFrom a terminal which you can get to by going Applications > Accessories > Terminal, copy and paste the following:\nrm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gconf .gconfd .metacity\nThis will remove all of your gnome settings and set them to the default settings. These files are normally hidden files and you don't normally see them in your home folder from nautilus (nautilus is the file manager that is shown when you go to Places > Home).\nLog off and back on to apply the changes.\n\nA: The solution to the problem was very simple\nClick in the menu\n\"System\"\n\"Preferences\"\n\"Windows\"\nThen under \"Movement Key\"\nselect the radio button for \"super (or \"Windows Logo\")\n\nI don't know if this is the way it is supposed to be set or if it is backwards now (I never looked at this setting before) but my mouse now works correctly on\nUbuntu 10.04\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1512841\n\nA: Try to kill and re-run your panel app process.\nCan't run terminal?\nIf you are unable to start the Terminal (e.g. using a shortcut Alt+F2), but can run file manager,\nyou can find the Terminal in: /usr/bin/gnome-terminal (or generally in /usr/bin/*)\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for a panel process (e.g. gnome-system-monitor > tab \"Processes\", search for something *-panel), for me it was xfce4-panel, for you it is probably gnome-panel \n\n*Run terminal\n\n*Kill all of it: sudo killall gnome-panel\n\n*Start it again sudo gnome-panel &\nIf you have Xubuntu, your panel app process is probably xfce4-panel, then, of course:\nsudo killall xfce4-panel\nsudo xfce4-panel &\n\nA: At least for the panel, you should try restarting the panel via \"gnome-panel --replace\" command to see if this temporary solves your problem (until next restart). In Ubuntu 10.04 my Desktop didn't have any problems, but with my Laptop, 80% of times I had to restart the panel at boot time ( there was a bug in gnome ).  \nIf @Martin Owens solution doesn't work you could use KDE for a while ( it will be easier to have a working station to help you find a solution, that what I did in 10.10, where in gnome the mouse could not click anything but in KDE worked ). KDE is instaled from software center as kubuntu package, or in CLI with this command :sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nA: Some of the behavior mentioned here, happened to me as well in while using Xubuntu 18.04, I solved it by going into the XFCE Panel Switch and reapplying my current configuration.\nHope it helps. \n", "Q: How to turn off the automatic lock?

Google strongly suggest to use an HTTPS. Try to switch to 'http and https' connection settings. I think Firefox should open Gmail by HTTP protocol.\n\nA: First of all, test if the problem occurs with other browsers.\nIf the problem occurs with other browsers:\nIs possibly a network issue, like DNS resolution.

Close Firefox, then:\nfirefox -safe-mode\n\nIf that works, then is an extension affecting your login. You can disable all extensions from the safe mode starting dialog and then enable one-by-one until you find the culprit.\nIf that doesn't help, create a new Firefox profile and test it. You can create a new profile by starting the profile manager. Close Firefox, then:\nfirefox -P\n\nIf that solves the problem, then see the tutorial \"Fixing a problematic or corrupted profile\". If the problem persist even when using a new profile, then create a new Ubuntu user and test it. You can do that from \"System >> Administration >> Users and Groups\". If the problem does not persist when using a new user account, then you need to figure out which of your Gnome settings is affecting the Gmail login. Report back with the results.\n\nA: The problem may also be related to your cookies. This could happen if you have an invalid cookie.

In my case I use eth1, but proably your is eth0.\n \nNow when you start windows, check that the ip is of the same local network of your host machine (launch cmd and next digit ipconfig).\nIf the ip is right, try to ping your guest machine from Ubuntu host machine:\nping ip_guest\n\nIf all is ok, now you can access your guest machine (windows) from your host machine (Ubuntu).\nI've recently migrated an application from mssql 2005 to MySql (precisely MariaDB) and I have developed a set of scripts in php to do this task.\nFor remotly connect to a sql server I'have installed through Synaptic the php5-sybase extension. \nNext from my php scripts I have opened two connection, one with sql server and one with MySql and migrated the desired data.\n/*mssql*/\n$server_from=\"ip_guest\\SQLEXPRESS\";\n$username_from=\"mssql_user\"; //mine is sa\n$password_from=\"mssql_password\";\n\n/*MySql*/\n$server_to   = \"127.0.0.1\";\n$username_to = \"mysql_user\";\n$password_to = \"mysql_password\";\n\n//FROM Connect to MSSQL\n$link_from = mssql_connect($server_from, $username_from, $password_from);\n//TO Connect to MySQL\n$link_to = mysql_connect($server_to, $username_to, $password_to);\n\nMssql function are analogue to the Mysql one: http://it.php.net/manual/en/book.mssql.php\nIt change only the prefix...\n\nA: You can use a bridget Network Interface from the Virtual Machine, so you can use this one like a real Server...\n\nA: Bridged networking\nThis is for more advanced networking needs such as network simulations and running servers in a guest.

The application in question does some action (here connecting audio to network streams) and runs minimized if these actions were successful. Therefore a status icon is needed to display the state of the connection (e.g. CONNECTED/DISCONNECTED). Only when clicking the icon the application window will open to give access to further options.\nUsing Python 2.6 and pyGtk I conveniently realised this by using gtk_status_icon. I deliberately wrote the application to run on as many distributions as possible including the various Ubuntu versions. I took care to use possible dependencies only after the user had installed them.\nHowever now I hear that gtk_status_icon will no longer be supported in future Ubuntu releases. Developers are asked to use Application Indicators instead. What is then best practise to make sure that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The application's local icons are displayed properly\n\n*The application will still run and display it's icons in future Ubuntu releases.\n\n*The application will also run and display it's icons in other environments where indicator-applet, libappindicator, and python-appindicator are not provided.\n\n\nApplication Indicator fallback mechanisms to gtk_status_icon won't work if indicator-applet is not running. Python interpreters will not run if there was no appindicator module to import from. Do I need to develop different versions for different distributions or is there a better way to come around this.\nWhere do I find a documentation on how to use ApplicationIndicator other than in the example given in Ubuntu Wiki? What commands are provided to check if indicator-applet is running to avoid programming different source codes for Ubuntu vs. non-Ubuntu distributions?\n\nA: You will need to write code for both. You can detect the presence of appindicator in your Python code using something similar to:\nhave_appindicator = True\ntry:\n    import appindicator\nexcept:\n    have_appindicator = False\n\nFrom there, use have_appindicator to decide whether you should use appindicator code or gtk_status_icon code.\nUnfortunately, this also means you will need to have both an Ubuntu and another environment to test with.\n\nA: for line in os.popen(\"ps xa\"): \nfields = line.split() \npid = fields[0] \nprocess = fields[4]\n\napplet_is_running = ( process.find('indicator-applet') > 0 )\n\nThis way you can detect if indicator applet is running. You don't need to worry about Ubuntu 11.04 because this won't be the case.\nThere are no fallback scenario because indicator-applet is a mandatory component, running by default.\n\nA: I think that the need here is actually more determining of the python-appindicator library is present.  If it is present, it will support all the fallback cases that you need.  It will handle XFCE, KDE and older GNOME appropriately.  Good example of how to do it in this answer.\nThe appindicator library will use DBus to check if the application indicator rendering process is available.  This will be the case on Unity, or if the indicator-applet is running.  If it is available it will use that, if not, it will fallback to using a GtkStatusIcon with the same menu.\nUnfortunately, I believe you'd have to keep both code paths if you want to handle the case of the library not being available.  Though, we'd be happy to help get the library in other distros :)\n\nA: I have an excellent solution that has worked well in StackApplet - I created a functionally-equivalent version of the appindicator module that uses gtk.StatusIcon internally to provide identical functionality when the real module does not exist.\nUsing it is as simple as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloading the following file and call it appindicator_replacement.py\n\n*Adding the following to your application:\ntry:\n    import appindicator\nexcept ImportError:\n    import appindicator_replacement as appindicator\n\nThat's it! Now your application will run perfectly with or without support for AppIndicators. It will even run on Windows, assuming you don't have any other platform-specific code.\n\nNote: the file is released under the MIT license - so you can use it pretty much for anything.\n", "Q: Password protect single Drive I have four drives.

I have heard and read many rumors about Skype but very few tangible informations. Skype is said to be engaged in censorship in China according to the official Ubuntu Wiki, and to have very serious security threats according to French Defense classified information files. Therefore, although it is widely used in companies, Skype is forbidden in universities.\nWhat is the part of trueness of those statements? In the end, am I exposed to security threats if use Skype?\n\nA: Any form of VoIP application be it skype or ekiga or twinklephone has security implications and is vulnerable to privacy breach. Since the likes of ekiga use SIP and is opensource, the threats are well documented  experts can easily come up with ways to plug the holes. Skype uses proprietary protocols, so its pretty much up to them to discover vulnerabilties and inform their users. Ive personally used skype and like it, and there is no reason why you wouldn't but if there is an option its better to use open protocol based software.\n\nA: Skype obfuscates its code from any disassembly attempts. The protocol is not documented either. The code encrypts everything and frustates third parties and users from knowing exactly what it is doing.\nPeople don't like it because they have no way to verify its operation. Skype can and has been told to spy on its users by their governments.\nEkiga is very open. It doesn't work as well but that's mostly because of less resources being devoted to it. AFAIK you can still use encryption w/ Ekiga.\n\nA: This is one of the example of the dark side of Skype: German government malware.\nAny closed source proprietary software can hide inside one or more backdoors.\n", "Q: System can't find disks on boot I installed ubuntu server 10.04 on a PC with two HD drives 500 GB each. I used raid1 to provide data protection. The /boot partition is installed also on a mirrored device /dev/md0.\nAfter the installation has completed, the system did not boot properly. I got the following error message:\nALERT! /dev/disk/by-uuid/<long characters> does not exist. Dropping to a shell!\n\nAny idea what could cause such a problem?\nUPDATE:\nI booted into rescue mode using the installation CD. Executing fdisk showed me the partitions, but it said \"Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary.\". Can this be related to the problem at hand?\nUPDATE2:\nI re-installed ubuntu server without the Raid at all. The system booted as it should be! Also, I got the same error from fdisk after booting. So, this error should not be related to this problem of not being able to boot.\nIt is puzzling me.

I want my / partition to be rewritten, but to keep my existing /home. \nAny way to tell the installer my /home already exists in a separate LUKS partition?\nThanks in advance,\nAdam\n\nA: What I would do is to reinstall using /boot and / and leave the /home partition alone during the install. Once you have installed you can install cryptsetup, set up your partition in /etc/crypttab and /etc/fstab and you'll be away. I'll assume you have an encrypted swap For the details, once you have installed and rebooted, open a terminal and:\nsudo apt-get install cryptsetup\ncryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda6 crypthome\ncd /\nmount -t ext4 /dev/mapper/crypthome /home\n\nEdit the partition details and file system type as required.

I have deleted a partition which had an incomplete ubuntu install using Windows 7 partition manager.\nOther than that I had a different partition with a working ubuntu but when I deleted the partition and restarted the computer I have found out that grub wont let me enter any operating system so I used the fixMbr command in the windows 7 disc and it seems like grub has been gone and when I boot I don't receive a choice of an os but it automaticlly loads windows 7.\nSo my question is how can I get ubuntu back?\n\nA: You need to reinstall GRUB onto the working Ubuntu partition. Grab a Ubuntu LiveCD and boot to it.\nOne you do that, open GParted. We'll use this to discover your hard drive's letter and your Ubuntu partition's number.\n\nNow, the underlined part at the top is the device we are looking at (my hard drive) where the underlined part inside the table is my Ubuntu partition (it won't be in the exact same place in the partition, look for an ext4 (or ext3 for Ubuntu versions prior to 10.04) partition). We need these two when we go into the terminal.\nNext, open Terminal up and type the following in, replace X with the hard drive letter and Y with the partition number (these two are shown inside GParted)\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX\n\nSo for my example, I'd replace X with a and Y with 4. (these will vary depending on how your partitions are setup, so do not use these unless GParted says that's where your partitions are at)\nLet it work and after it finishes, GRUB should show up when you boot your computer up.\n\nA: Windows tends to remove other OSs if present. Therefore you need to restore GRUB. If your Ubuntu installation ist still present (check with live CD!) you'll be able to boot into Ubuntu again.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Ubuntu use YaST? openSUSE is known by it's YaST control center, a powerful tool that centralizes all the system configurations. It makes it a lot simpler to configure the system, why doesn't Ubuntu make use of such a thing?\n\n\nA: I know its not YAST but control centre can handle almost all the Preferences on a Gnome environment.\nGnome has its own control centre which is disabled on ubuntu by default but you can enable it.\nSystem > preferences > main menu\nNow go to the system tab and check box on control central and close\nNow the control centre should be available under places menu, there you can set preferences for almost all the applications on ubuntu.\n\nA: YaST was built to work with RPM packages, one of the two most popular package formats. Ubuntu, along with all Debian variants, use DEB packages and their related tools (dpkg/apt) for package management. Also, as another user mentioned, there are functional replacements for most (all?) of YaSTs features in synaptic , aptitude, and software-center. Most of YaST's configuration functionality is present in GNOME as far as I am aware.\n", "Q: How do I install my Wacom Intuos 2 serial tablet?

Am I right to type it in the terminal?\n\nA: Serial tablepc based wacom tablets should just work without any additional attention. If they don't then we will need to do a bit of investigation from the command line (Applications > Accessories > Terminal).\nFirst check to see if the serial port is registering correctly:\nls /dev/ttyS*\nFor each one of those you can run this command to check it's pnp information (remember to change the ttyS0 to each of the ttyS nodes found above):\nudevadm info -a -p $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/ttyS0)\nIt's probably good if you copy and paste all the information here so we can see what's happening. Normally the output for a wacom should look like this:\nlooking at device '/devices/pnp0/00:0a/tty/ttyS0':\n    KERNEL==\"ttyS0\"\n    SUBSYSTEM==\"tty\"\n    DRIVER==\"\"\n\n  looking at parent device '/devices/pnp0/00:0a':\n    KERNELS==\"00:0a\"\n    SUBSYSTEMS==\"pnp\"\n    DRIVERS==\"serial\"\n    ATTRS{id}==\"WACf004\"\n\n  looking at parent device '/devices/pnp0':\n    KERNELS==\"pnp0\"\n    SUBSYSTEMS==\"\"\n    DRIVERS=\"\"\n\nIf you don't see any wacom info here then your device probably isn't a tabletpc wacom device and is probably plugged into a serial port on your computer. These devices are no longer supported in Ubuntu and you should downgrade to Karmic until support is added back in for newer xservers (1.7 and 1.9).\n", "Q: When creating a new text file, should I add a .txt extension to its name? When I create a new document aimed at containing only plain text, I am not obliged by Ubuntu to add a .txt extension to its name. It works indeed very well: gedit opens it without problem, understanding very well that it is only text.\nThe only two pro arguments I have found from now on for adding an extension are 1/ interoperability with Windows systems and 2/ avoiding confusion with folders having the same name. Nevertheless those two arguments do not convince me at all. As a consequence, should I keep the reflex of adding an extension to files or not?\n\nA: It doesn't matter in Linux based systems whether you use a .txt extension or not. In fact, there is no special 'file extension' as on Windows - it is just part of the name. MIME types are used to determine the type of the file.\nIf, however, you wish to share a file with people who are still using Windows, they will have to manually choose to open the text files with notepad unless you use a .txt extension.\nThere are other compatibility considerations. By default, Notepad will not show new lines correctly because it uses a different line ending to Linux and other Unix like systems. The text editor will show text files in the Windows format correctly but you may need to press backspace twice in order to remove a new line.\nUsing a text editor called Geany you can convert between line ending types through the Document -> Set Line Endings menu. This may also be possible in the default text editor (Gedit) but I don't know how to do it.\nPersonally, I would not use the .txt extension or Windows line endings for daily use but I would convert the files when I needed to share them with Windows users.\n\nA: If you want to learn more about how Linux identifies filetypes and why extensions are useless for that purpose, take a look at the file command man page  \nman file\n\nIt's a kind of magic :)\n\nA: In many cases filename extensions are not required on Ubuntu, but often it's still a good idea to use them.  Not only for Windows/Mac compatibility, but also for your own convenience.  Imagine if you would remove all file extensions (.html, .jpg, .doc, .ttf, .txt, .py, .conf, etc.); you would have to check the file type all the time, instead of knowing it when reading the file name (of course filenames like README are also obvious).\n\nA: If you use linux dosent matter.Extensions are meaningless add it if you like..But if you want to view that file in windows, extension is must else you cant view the file. while keeping a well-known extension makes for better interoperability, it may also help certain (not very well written) apps behave better.For example, a mail client might choose a more appropriate MIME type for an attachment.So decide yourself.\n\nA: It's completely your own decision - don't let anyone chose for you.\nIf it's a 'reflex' then there's no harm in keeping your current habbits. On the other hand it does look cleaner without file extensions...\nIn my opinion the main case for using the extension is if you're emailing files to Windows users - whilst they could still open it in Notepad (with File->Open With) they will probably confused if you leave it off.  \n\nA: The extension is optional but depending on your expectations you may wish to use one anyway. For example, Image viewer will fail miserably to open an image with the wrong extension. The thumbnailer will also fail in this example. You can prove this by renaming a JPEG to .GIF or .PNG for example. If you have a file and you aren't sure what it is you can find out with the command file filename where filename is the file in question. Here's some example commands and output:\nfile unity-panel_001.bmp \nunity-panel_001.bmp: PC bitmap, Windows 3.x format, 1280 x 21 x 24\nme@zippy-64bit:~/Pictures$ file web-off.png \nweb-off.png: PNG image data, 850 x 552, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced\nme@zippy-64bit:~/Pictures$ file XfinityBillShowingLateFee.jpg \nXfinityBillShowingLateFee.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, aspect ratio, density 1x1, segment length 16, baseline, precision 8, 2480x3437, frames 3\n\n", "Q: How do I un-fullscreen KMyMoney? After updating to Ubuntu 10.10 (Gnome), KMyMoney now opens in fullscreen mode by default, and I can't find any option to get out of fullscreen.  I've tried pressing F11, and I've taken a pretty good look through the view options, but I can't find any way to turn off fullscreen mode.  After a little looking, it seems like KMyMoney's preferences can't be found in gconf-editor, and there doesn't seem to be a command-line switch for turning fullscreen on or off.  So I'm at a loss, and any help would be much appreciated, thanks!\n\nA: Kmymoney is not a gtk/gnome application; it doesn't use gconf.\nThat's the first thing. If you are using compiz, there is a fullscreen shortcut (usually super+f).\nYou can try that first. If that does not work, then try accessing the menu by pressing alt+f or f10. Some kde applications start in full screen mode under GNOME (I've never found out why, sadly). If all else fails, someone may be able to provide more information than me.\n", "Q: Cloning (mirroring) laptop display to area of external monitor display I'm using Maverick \"10.10\" Meercat on a HP Pavilion tx2110.  This machine has an NVidia Go6150 graphics card, and sports a 1280x800 display.  I have an external monitor which can do 1280x1024 resolution.  FWIW I'm using openbox as my window manager; as I understand it this shouldn't be a factor.\nI'd like to clone the display to the monitor, so that the size of the desktop remains at 1280x800, and there is a horizontal blank area on the external monitor.  I.E. I want to avoid having to pan the display of the desktop on either monitor.  So the actual resolution of the monitor would be 1280x1024, but the resolution of the section of the monitor where stuff was actually being displayed would be 1280x800.\nUsing the nvidia-settings applet, I'm able to set up the cloned display so that the desktop size is 1280x1024 (the resolution of the external monitor), but can't find a way to instead have the desktop size stay at the resolution of the laptop's built-in display.\nIs this achievable?  Ideally I'd like the external monitor's blank area to be at the top of the screen, i.e. for it to align the display with the bottom of the screen.\n\nA: Your monitor most likely does not support that resolution, if not the nVidia settings manager would have allowed you to use that resolution. Unfortunately you may not be able to achieve what you are looking for.\nYou could do it if there were some custom option available from the drivers, but neither the open-source nor proprietary drivers have this feature. \n", "Q: Cannot watch youtube in fullscreen mode When I am watching videos on youtube and toggle the screen to full screen or switch back from full screen to normal mode, the video stops and sometimes stops loading or starts loading from the start again.\nI installed ubuntu-restricted-extras  so I have flash installed.\n\nA: There's a fix posted here. It seems to have done the trick for me, but I'm not 100% sure it's the same problem for you. This is a problem with Flash and its hardware acceleration, not YouTube itself.\nIn case the above site is unavailable, here's the fix:\nsudo mkdir /etc/adobe\necho \"OverrideGPUValidation = 1\" | sudo tee -a /etc/adobe/mms.cfg\n\n\nA: This happens to me too. I think it has to do with changes in Youtube's player itself. In the normal mode, the default player quality is usually 360p. However when we change to fullscreen, it automatically changes the video quality to 480p and starts loading for that quality. That's why it seems to restart. I can't check right now, but I think it is possible to change these default settings in our user preferences in Youtube. I don't think the problem is Ubuntu or Linux specific (but perhaps it is related to the new flashplugin available for Linux now, but I am not sure).\n", "Q: Is it safe to resize my swap partition on a production system? I have a laptop with 4GB RAM, but when I first set it up, I had no plans to hibernate so I gave it 2GB swap. I don't want to use a swap file, so is it safe to resize the swap partition (and of course the main ext4 partition)?\n\nA: Yeah, that should be just fine. Swap space is used when the system has too many applications running to hold all of their data in memory; it's a feature of the paging/virtual memory system. If you shut down the machine properly before repartitioning, there shouldn't be any data in the swap space and you should be able to expand it safely.\n\nA: The problem you will encounter is that if you try to resize a partition it probably won't work as you are currently using it. In the computer system jargon we says the partition is \"mounted\", reflecting the fact that you can browse it and access its data.\nSo what you want to do is boot from a Live CD or USB and use the disk partition manager to resize your \"home\" partition for instance. As you would have started the computer from the Live device, your real home partition would not be \"mounted\", and as such you can edit it.\nThough, in most cases you won't have problems resizing a partition you should always perform a complete backup of your data on your computer. And in addition, you should check the following, it will help avoiding problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*as you have a laptop, check that your battery is fully charged and that the power cable is plugged in. So you're reducing the risk of power failure during the resizing process\n\n*you should check the partition for errors and correct them before resizing. You could check the Ubuntu wiki for fsck, or you can use the command sudo fsck -y /dev/sda<n> replacing  by the proper partition number. I advise you to do that from the Live CD/USB too.\n\n*as you want to reduce a partition of 2GB, you should verify first that you have more than 2GB free on this partition.\n\n*finally it's good practice to avoid having a file system too full (more than 80 or 90 %) as this helps keeping file fragmentation low. You should be aware that file fragmentation could raise the time and complexity necessary to resize a partition.\n\n\nBut don't be afraid, it's doable. I've done on a production development server at work. And everything worked fine.\n", "Q: Can virtual terminals (ctrl+alt+f*) use external monitors?

Is there some way that I can get VT's to show on the external monitor? (I can't ssh into it, I don't have another computer to do that with).\n\nA: Yes it is possible, depending on the laptop. Anything that uses the standard VGA text mod shouldn't have a problem with an external monitor, although you may need to switch on the external monitor using the keyboard switch.\nI had an HP laptop with a broken screen & was working with both the command line & X with an external monitor, without having the enable the screen when using a VT.\n\nA: I had a laptop with a similar problem, and what I did was to press the key sequence to switch to the external monitor while it was going through the bios screens, before Linux or grub was involved.\n", "Q: Do I need to configure my laptop dock?

It required no additional configuration. I use the DVD all the time. I'm reasonably sure your setup will be the same.\n", "Q: Is it possible (aka safe) to resize a partition while the system is running? I'm talking about resizing my root partition (/), while the system is on (I know that's usually impossible, but I'm just hoping there is some way to do it). I want to know if there is some way I can boot the system up in read-only mode (without a live cd, just in case), and resize /.\nIf it can't work, I understand, as that is what I already know to be the case (but you never know =P)\n\nA: Some filesystems support \"on-line\" resizing, and in that case I would consider it reasonably safe unless the manpage/program warns it is not.\nMost filesystems that support \"on-line resize\" only support making it larger (e.g. XFS, ext2/3/4, reiserfs).\nBtrfs supports on-line growing and shrinking, but of course it's not as stable as a long-existing filesystem like XFS or ext4 yet.\n\nA: I agree with the earlier comment. I would just add to make GOOD BACKUPS before attempting anything like this. I also found that I can do this only if the partition is unmounted, as well as all partitions after this one on the hard disk. I saw this when attempting to merge two partitions together, by first deleting one, freeing up space, and then adding the freed space to an existing partition. \nI was told that all partitions above the one to be increased must be unmounted first. I did unmount it, and merged the partition. It was successful.\nBUT do backups backups backups backups ....................did I say BACKUP ?\n", "Q: Hybrid suspend on HP DV7 I want to enable Hybrid suspend on my system. Can someone point me to the right info? Plus, I read something about it not working, but is that really true? Or just a system by system issue? Thanks for any information.\n\nA: s2both (provided by uswsusp) is one way to do it. pm-suspend-hybrid is another. I'm not aware of any outstanding issues for either program that isn't model- or configuration- specific.\nThat being said, I have this issue with pm-suspend-hybrid. The accepted answer there doesn't work for me. s2both resumes correctly, but shuts down my laptop instead of putting it to sleep correctly per this confirmed bug. I think my issues with these methods are related to my hardware.\n", "Q: How I should proceed to accept translations through the launchpad? I just started my new project right now, however I can't find any documentation on how I should proceed to accept translations on it.\n\n\n*\n\n*how I should proceed to accept translations through the launchpad.net?\n\n*I really need to create a Translation group to start accept this kind of contribution?\n\n\nI do not care if you are a translator or developer, I'm really interested in hearing from both sides. So, go make your answer below and don't forget to suggest best practices too. Thanks!\n\nA: Launchpad translations uses a free software translation system called GNU gettext. This is available as a library for pretty much any programming language you decide to use. Normally, the syntax is something like:\n_('String in English')\n\nThis will translate the string for the user using their locale. If there is no translation for their locale the English string is used.\nThere will probably be tools for your specific language to extract these strings to translate from your code and put them in a .pot file. A .pot file contains information about the strings that need to be translated. It can also contains licencing information at the top (this is required to be a BSD licence for use in Launchpad) and comments for the translators.\nOnce you have your pot file, you should put it in a po/ directory in the root of your source code. The pot file should be named textdomain.pot. When using gettext in your code, you will need to specify the text domain - see the gettext documentation for your programming language for more details. Normally, the text domain is the same as the name of your software package.\nOnce you have the po/ directory and pot file, you can import them into Launchpad.\nIn the translations tab of your project you should set Launchpad to manage your translations.\n\nAlso, set up the import from your code branch.\n\nOnce this is done, translators will be able to translate the strings in your pot file into their language.\n", "Q: Screen Resolution: xrandr \"cannot find mode\" So I do a vanilla install of 10.04 Lucid Lynx, and login.

I have a new project hosted at launchpad.net. My project can be useful for both: Ubuntu and Debian. However, I can't find a documentation to start host my project at launchpad.net and get my package mirrored back to Debian.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to propose my project to be part of Debian too?\n\n*What is the difference between a Ubuntu and a Debian?\n\n*Can I keep it hosted at launchpad.net but ask it to be cross-hosted (and packaged) at Debian too?\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Basically you need to suggest your package according the the Debian guidelines for New Packages where you need to report a bug that your package be set on the wishlist. Once your package is in Debian it will be mirrored with Ubuntu.\n\nA: The process for getting a package into Debian is outlined in this FAQ. Once your package is in Debian, it will be automatically imported into Ubuntu. \nDebian and Ubuntu use the same packaging system. Binary packages (.deb files) for Debian and Ubuntu are not necessarily compatible but when you package for Ubuntu and Debian you upload source code so that it is built for different architectures. Binary packages are built separately for Debian and Ubuntu.\nIt doesn't matter where you host your code.\n\nA: To request packaging in debian you should read wnpp page and fill a bug with RFP\n", "Q: Message during boot: (process:301): GLib-WARNING **: getpwuid_r (): failed due to unknown user id (0) at boot Today when booting my computer (10.04 32-bit, System76 lemur) Ubuntu ran the hard drive scan -- as it was finishing the screen went black with this message:\n(process:301): GLib-WARNING **: getpwuid_r (): failed due to unknown user id (0)\n\nNo key functions seemed to work. I restarted the computer with the power switch and it has since been functioning fine... what happened?

I recently (re)stumbled upon this: Linux Trojan Goes Unnoticed For Almost A Year (Unreal IRCd) \nYes, I know that adding some random PPA/software from an untrusted source is asking for trouble (or worse). I never do that, but many do (many Linux blogs and tabloids promote adding PPAs for fancy apps, without warning that it may break your system or worse still, compromise your security.) \nHow can a trojan horse or a rogue application/script be detected and removed?\n\nA: It's always a game of cat and mouse with detection software.  New malware is created, scanners get updated to detect it.  There's always a lag between the two.  There are programs that use heuristics that watch what software is doing and attempt to catch unwanted activity but in my opinion it's not a perfect solution and uses resources.\nMy advice is simple, don't install software from sources you don't trust but if you are like me and can't avoid the temptation, put them in a virtual machine (ie virtualbox) and play with it until you're confident it won't either bork your system or do things you didn't want.\nAgain, not a perfect solution but for now, a virtual machine has the best chance of isolating your machine from unwanteds.\n\nA: Most anti-malware software for Linux/Unix simply searches for Windows malware. The occurences of Linux malware has usually been very limited, even in cases where the security updates are slow or don't come.\nBasically, you only use software you trust and update daily, that's how you stay safe.\n\nA: Another response said: \"It's always a game of cat and mouse with detection software.\"\nI disagree.\nThis is true of approaches that rely on signatures or heuristics for detecting malware.\nBut there is another way to detect malware: verify known goods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tripwire, AIDE, etc. can verify files on disk.\n\n*Second Look can verify the running kernel and processes.\nSecond Look uses memory forensics to directly inspect the operating system, active services, and applications.\nIt compares the code in memory to what has been released by the Linux distribution vendor.  In this way it can immediately pinpoint malicious modifications made by rootkits and backdoors, and unauthorized programs (trojans, etc.).\n(Disclosure: I am the lead developer of Second Look.)\n\nA: Kaspersky and avg both have solutions they offer, and McAfee has one for Red Hat that might be available on Ubuntu. \navg is here:\nhttp://free.avg.com/us-en/download\nYou might find this article interesting:\nhttp://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/bliss/\nI have the mindset that if you have run anything as root that you feel concerned about later, you should probably reinstall. any files you transfer should probably have the executable bit removed as well\n'chmod ugo -x'\n\nA: You could also try ClamAV from the software center\n", "Q: Moving from Windows to Ubuntu.

I think I have given you enough reasons to switch into ubuntu :)\n\nA: First off, you shouldn't need to download apps from the web (at least most of the time) as the Ubuntu Software Centre, found under the Applications tab in the upper left of the screen, contains most of the applications you will need on Ubuntu, all for free. The Software Centre is divided into categories (Office, Web, Programming, etc) and all you have to do to install software from it is to hit the 'install' button and enter you user password, and you're all set.\nNow, onto specific applications.\nVisual Studio: If you're planning on doing development on Linux, you may want to check out the accepted answer to this question on Stack Overflow. The default text editor on Ubuntu has built in support for syntax highlighting of a great many languages and can have it's functionality expanded with plugins (many of which some preinstalled). If you're looking for an IDE for a particular language, then just search for that language in the Software Centre (you probably don't need to include 'IDE').\nNero: Fluendo is available from the Software Centre for $25 under the recently introduced 'for purchase' category.\nAdobe Reader: Ubuntu has a built in pdf viewer called Evince.\nAlcohol 120%: Ubuntu has a DVD burner called Brasero, though I'm not sure how it compares to Alcohol in terms of features.\nWinRAR: Ubuntu has a built in archive manage that can handle .zip and .tar.gz. Though if you want to use WinRAR, I think there's a Linux version available.\nTotal Commander: Nautilus is Ubuntu's window manager. Play around with it and see if it has the features you use in Total Commander.\nFar: Nautilus and Archive Manager, mentioned as possible alternatives elsewhere in this list, may be able to replace this, though I've never encountered Far before so I can't say for sure.\nVizio: I think Dia, found in the Software Centre, is what you're after there, though I've not used Vizio so I couldn't say how it compares.\nAdobe Photoshop: The Gimp, available from the Software Centre, is the bext bitmap editor available on Linux, and Inkscape is available if you want to do some vector editing.\nMicrosoft Office: Open Office is the primary alternative to MS Office and is preinstalled in Ubuntu.\nBitTorrent: Transmission is the torrent client preinstalled in Ubuntu\nSecurity: ClamAV is a good anti-virus program, not preinstalled but found in the Software Centre. The Ubuntu firewall is good and so you won't need a third party program.\nBrowsers: Firefox comes preinstalled on Ubuntu\nMessengers: Empathy is the preinstalled IM/IRC client on Ubuntu. It supports a wide range of services including MSN, Gtalk and Facebook Chat.\nMusic players: Rhythmbox is preinstalled on Ubuntu, although I personally use Banshee (available from the Software Centre) because of the increased functionality. If you're used to WinAmp, then you might like to check that one out.\nCodecs: There are few preinstalled codecs on Ubuntu, but support for pretty much all AV filetypes is available from the Software Centre. Just search for 'Gstreamer' and you'll get a list of codecs that provide the support for a multitude of formats. Check them out and install the ones you want.\n.txt files can be opened in Ubuntu's default text editor, Gedit, and the various images formats can be opened in the default image viewer.\nI've done what I can here, though you're going to have to fire up Ubuntu and play around with it and see what it does for you. Remember, just search the Software Centre and see what you come across.\n\nA: First of all, welcome to Ubuntu! :-)\nSo, all the software you mentioned in your list have an equivalent in Linux.

Still, you are now on a very different OS. This needs some change of thinking especially when it comes to applications and how to install them.\nUnlike Windows you have not only installed a modern operating system with Ubuntu but much more: it's what we call a \"distribution\". This means that almost all useful applications that are tested to run are already included but perhaps not yet installed on your PC from the installation CD.\nRunning Applications that are not provided on CD is done with a few mouse clicks only. There are several programs installed that do this, but you will find the Software Center where you can choose from an overwhelming variety of tested, useful and mostly free software a good point to start.\nDownloading files from other internet recources is rarely needed. In fact it is discouraged because those applications may not be tested, can cause instabilities to your system and cannot be updated automatically (which is otherwise the case).\nTry out Ubuntu and you will soon find that thinking \"the Ubuntu way\" is what you have always missed in the past.\n\nA: Musical players: Aimp Winamp Sound forge\nVLC, Banshee, Rhythmbox, even Winamp itself (using playonlinux); all available in the software center.\nCodecs for video, audio etc. - if you choose install extras during your install *(maverick, 10.10, and later) you don't have to install these. To be sure, install ubuntu-restricted-addons and -extras (using software center, or synaptic).\nMicrosoft Office 2003,\nOpen Office works fine with files from Office 2003, but if you are really really looking for the exact thing, use PlayOnLinux to give you an easy install.

Does anybody knows why Ubuntu's NM does'n use native implementations for networking ?  \nFor example if I set up a pppoe connection in the network manager (using nm-applet) it has it's own way of storing connections and doesn't use native debian networking sheme, for PPPoE use pppd and store settings in /etc/ppp/pears. I once configured a wired connection that didn's show up in /etc/network/interfaces but was visible in NM ... This is BAD for me because if I don't start X, from CLI I cannot connect to my network connections configured in NM ( or not as easy I would expect), for example in CLI I could do pon \"dsl-provider\" or poff to turn on or off pppoe connection, but my NM's pppoe connections are not visible to pppd and if I configure a pppoe connection using pppd is not visible in NM.\nMaybe I am missing something and don't know how to use it ...\nThank you.\n\nA: You may find that there are issues with NM handling PPPoE connections, especially if through Wi-Fi.\nHowever, to fix exactly what you're describing, you may want to try setting NetworkManager in \"managed\" mode by editing /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf and changing managed=true to false. \nThis tells NM to use the configuration in /etc/network/interfaces if possible (and if it understands the syntax in there, but the logic is getting better and better) and to create a connection that can be turned on or off. It's definitely worth a try ;)\n\nA: You should be able to use nmcli from the commandline to up/down a PPPoE connection registered in NM.\n\nA: I think I would have to agree with the basic point here, having just spent a couple of days tracking down why I suddenly lost networking...\n(This page really helped that, so thanks to all who contributed to it.)\nThe point being that when a 'new' way is introduced, or there are multiple configuration systems it is good to be able to connect the new way and old way and make it\na) obvious which system is in use (to users of the old and new systems),\nb) make it discoverable (including the commands and apps that are recommended e.g. the nmcli reference above), and\nc) that the chosen method should be able to be managed from both the GUI and the command line.\nThanks.\n", "Q: Running Evernote 4 with Wine in Ubuntu I heard that we can now run Evernote with Wine.

I moved to Ubuntu from windows and everything is rocking except the touchpad mouse sensitivity. I have tried keeping it to a low level but its still super quick. How do I make is move across the screen just like windows.\n\nA: Go to System > Preferences > Mouse. You should see a section called \"Pointer Speed,\" with two sliders that set the acceleration and sensitivity of the pointer. It is the third bold section heading in the screenshot below. Sensitivity controls the overall speed of the pointer, which is probably what you're looking for. Acceleration represents an increase in pointer speed over time, which is good to increase if you find that it takes a comparatively long time to move the pointer from one end or edge of the screen to another. The changes made with these sliders should apply as soon as you let go of the left mouse button.\n\n", "Q: Will this hardware work well with Ubuntu?

I was wondering if it was possible to check what package another package is a dependency of.\nFor example, jetty is mysteriously installed and running on my system and I'd like to check whether it is a dependency of something else.\n\nA: If you open Synaptic and find the package, you can right click on it and select Properties.\nUnder the tab Dependencies you can see the packages that jetty depend on, and which packages is dependent on jetty (the dropdown list). \n\nA: Go install apt-rdepends. It doesn't only show immediate dependencies, but all the recursive ones, so will tend to give you a large output. So, use a pager as well.\n\n*\n\n*To display recursive depends: $ apt-rdepends jetty | pager. Note that this will list exactly the same depends multiple times. Output of apt-rdepends 1.3.0 isn't trivial for scripting as package name doesn't appear along each line...\n\n*To display recursive reverse depends: $ apt-rdepends --reverse jetty | pager. Note that this will return all packages, not just installed...\n\n\nA: You can use apt-cache rdepends --installed jetty to see what depends on jetty.

Can't the developers finally in 2011 move away from the flawed concepts of selections and private clipboards in applications and create a working clipboard service under X window system? \nI'm terribly frustrated because of losing my content after closing applications, because of weird middle button behaviour and for other cases of inferiority of Linux clipboard when compared to Mac OS X or Windows. \nNeither Glipper, Klipper, nor xfce4-clipman can heal my wounds.\n\nA: There are also long-time X users who consider the Mac OS X & Windows clipboard functionality broken, so this is partially just about what you have been used to.\nA clipboard manager should solve most of your issues, and where not, you might want to write documentation or file bug reports about what exactly is lacking (use cases that fail), so that the authors of those programs can know what features might be useful.  (In any case, a \"better\" solution would probably require zero changes to the clipboard itself, but instead changes to applications & maybe clipboard managers...)\nBTW: the situation on Windows isn't \"perfect\" either, as for most programs the clipboard manager also has less (or sometimes even no) useful data after closing the application than while it's still running.\n\nA: I had the same frustrations before I installed Parcellite.\nI don't see the need to develop yet another clipboard manager. Instead I think it would be great to have one preinstalled.\n\nA: I don't have many problems with Ubuntu's default clipboard behavior.  The only issue is when using rdesktop, sometimes I can't copy and paste from the remote desktop to the local machine until restarting the rdesktop connection.

Sometimes I want the last line of a text file to be a simple string of text with no newline character appended: ...eg. to concatenate another file to it.  \nSeveral editors automatically modify my text by adding a newline character, even though I have not pressed Enter.  \nRemains unmodified: Emacs, SciTE, Kate, Bluefish, Notepad(wine) \nNewline is added: Gedit, Gvim, Vim, Nano\nI would like to know if there is some way to tweak Gedit, Gvim, and Vim to only save what I have typed.... and even Nano might come in handy\nI currently use Gedit, and I'm dabbling in Gvim/Vim.. so it would be useful to know how to \"toggle\" these on/off...  \nPS. Upon re-opening  the same file in Gedit, Gvim, and Vim, the cursor's end-of-file placement is at the end of the text, whereas it should really show up on the next (empty) line.

Setting to binary will save the file as is and not insert a newline at the end of the document (Unless there already is one, in which it will be retained). At anytime you can revert this option with :set nobinary.\nNano is a little easier. You can launch nano with the -L flag (or --nonewlines if you're more the visual type). This will disable the automatic addition of the newline to the end of the file (so long as one was not actually entered). Ideally you could setup this alias in your ~/.bashrc: alias nano=\"nano -L\", which would launch Nano with the no newlines flag included in it!\nSince I don't know exactly what you're doing I'm going to point you to Why should files end with a newline? which may explain why they're there.

This kernel utilizes a 1000hz timer and full preemption among other things. The feature request here goes into more detail about the subject.\nOpen Fate OpenSUSE Desktop Kernel\nI know how to compile and configure my own kernel, though I do not understand the real advantages to it. Would perhaps disabling nohz, or unused featured such as hyperthreading (on my cpu anyway) and virtualization. (As well as the settings above). Would it really improve interactivity or response in a game?\nIf so, does anyone have any suggestions in configuring my kernel for such a purpose?\nUpdate:\nI did some digging by reading a few mailing lists, and it seems voluntary preemption is best. It has less issues with some drivers as does full preemption and still offers good latency. 1000hz seems like a solid choice considering if the kernel is compiled with no_hz. This means that it will only fire ticks when they are needed.\nI am strongly assuming optimizing the kernel for your arch will help, as well as specifically disabling unused modules. It states in kernel documentation that if you do not have a SMT (hyperthreading) system, that you can improve throughput by disabling that option. I have no evidence that this is the case, however it seems like it would not hurt.\nAlso after some testing it seems the new CFQ is a good scheduler for desktop/gaming use, it seems to offer good performance when running something disk heavy like creating a DVD tree.\nReally the Ubuntu generic kernel is set up well for good soft latency. Adding the 1000hz should be under review though.\n\nA: I believe that the Gentoo Guide to Kernel Configuration is the best:)\nYou can find it http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml?part=1&chap=7\nAs a former Gentoo-ist, having configure my own kernel lots of time I can say for sure that this guide helped me more than once :)\nAbout the performance. Just by recompiling the kernel with the right optimizations (adapter to your system) you'll perceive a performance boost, and by configuring only your needed modules and options you can obtain even more...\nBUT it is not easy to convert that 'performance boost' in game FPS, because there are a lot of other factors, not only the kernel.\nFor example most users need to disable compiz before running their games or they loose precious FPS :)\n", "Q: Thunderbird freezes when downloading large mails I have three mails boxes. While downloading mails with large attachments, thunderbirds freeze (going gray). anything is fine when downloading is finished but by the way i can't read my mails in this time.\nHas someone had this problem ?\n\nA: Going gray does not nessesarily mean that TB crashed with a freeze. It signals you that the application is busy. Only being busy for an endless time would be a freeze. If your application continues running after the download finished IMO everything is just fine. \nFailure to read already downloaded mails while a larger download runs is more like a wishlist feature for TB.

But I don't think that this is possible for desktop computers or servers without special hardware.\nIf you have physical access to the server, you could just plug it in an electricity usage monitor, e.g. this one for 22 USD.\n\nA: AFAIK most server & desktop hardware doesn't have the necessary hardware parts to measure this (unlike laptops where this is part of the battery electronics).\nIf you have an UPS, then this might be part of its features, so if you have one, you might want to look at its documentation.\nOtherwise, there also devices that you can put between the server and the wall plug to measure this.\n\nA: Thanks to the RAPL capabilities available in many intel/amd cpus (that is pretty reliable compared to a physical wattmeter) there are some projects emerging for that in the last years.\nOne of them is scaphandre. This is pretty recent but you can already get the machine power consumption and the consumption of each processes running on it.\n", "Q: How do I get multitouch working on a on Asus EEE pc 1215n?

I'm looking for a color duplex printer for Ubuntu. My favourites are Epson B-310N and Brother HL 4050CDN.

I am working on my project using network simulator2. I installed it and everything is fine.

In many cases I probably could just use SFTP, scp, rsync et al but there are times where I have elevated permissions on the remote server in a way I cannot use these methods.\nIf you're struggling to understand what I mean, imagine that you wanted to download something from /root/ or /var/log/auth.log. Root login is disabled (because we're not idiots). How do you get that file? Copy it out somewhere less protected and then move it? This is clunky. There are also scenarios where the remote path is complex or temporary, or isn't even a path because I want the output of a remote command stored locally. Store remotely, then copy? Clunk!\nThere are several more clunky ways to achieve versions of these but in an ideal world, I would have something akin to local write access from the remote server, using the existing SSH session as a conduit. Something like (this is just an artist's impression):\n$oli@remote: cp /root/cheesecake /local/\n\nAnd it just appears in my local cwd. And bidirectional access wouldn't be a bad thing.\n\nIt's been eight long years since I asked this question and we've seen a real range of clunk, but it remains a problem that I still struggle with occasionally.\nI've refactored the question into something a lot more idealistic. I fully understand that there may not currently be a perfect answer. All past and future efforts towards my ideal are appreciated.\n\nA: If your client machine (the machine you are sitting at) is called machineA and the machine you are currently SSH'ed into is called machine B.  MachineA, your local machine must have SSHD running and port 22 open.  Then:\nscp myfile machineA:\n\nCopies myfile on MachineB to my MachineA home directory on machineA.  This assumes userid/password are the same.\nscp myfile machineA:/newdir/newname\n\nCopies myfile one MachineB to /newdir/newname on machineA.   This assumes userid/password are the same.\nscp MachineA:/path/to/my/otherfile . \n\nGets a copy of otherfile from my MachineA directory on MachineA and puts it in my current working directory on the MachineB machine (designated in standard UNIX fashion by the \"dot\" (.) character).  This assumes userid/password are the same.\nIf the userid/password are not the same then use:\nscp myfile user@MachineA:  to get file.\nscp user@MachineA:/path/to/my/otherfile .  to put files\nNOTES about SCP:\nJust like the cp command, scp has a -p option to propagate the permission settings of the original file to the copy (otherwise the copy is made with the normal settings for new files), and a -r option to copy an entire directory tree with one command.\nscp creates a completely transparent encrypted data channel between the two machines, so binary data (such as images or executable programs) is preserved correctly. This also means that scp is unable to perform automatic end-of-line termination conversion between different types of operating systems, as can be done with ftp in \"ascii\" mode. That will not be a problem when copying between Unix systems, which all use the same end-of-line convention.\n\nA: You may want to check out zssh, which is available in universe, and therefore available with\nsudo apt-get install zssh\nYou need it on your ubuntu server and on your client, but basically when logged in with zssh, you just hit 'ctrl-@' and it brings up the \"File transfer mode\" which allows you to send files back down the pipe to your client machine, or upload them from client to server.\nHowever, you don't have to re-auth or open a new window to scp.\nIf you're using ssh keys, and an ssh agent, you can quite easily do:\n[enter]~[ctrl]-Z\n\nWhich will background ssh, and then just scp $!:/whatever/whatever .'\nOnce the file is transferred, fg to get ssh back. \nIf you aren't using ssh keys, you can still use the \"ControlMaster\" and \"ControlPath\" options added to recent OpenSSh versions, but that gets tricky, check man ssh_config\n\nA: if you access server via ssh, you get the ability to connect via sftp as well. Keep  filezilla client (GUI) handy and paste the path you are currently on\n\n\nA: Assuming you're running an ssh server on your desktop (there are ways around this, but I think they all add complexity, and possibly have security problems), you can set up a reverse ssh tunnel. See SSH easily copy file to local system. over at unix.SE.\n\n\n*\n\n*Type Enter ~C Enter -R 22042:localhost:22 Enter to create a reverse port forwarding from your server to your desktop (22042 can be any port number between 1024 and 65534 that's not in use).\n\n*Then scp -P 22042 foo localhost: will copy the file foo in your current directory on the server to your home on the desktop.\n\n*Now move the file into your current directory on the desktop by typing Enter ~ Ctrl+Z mv ~/foo . Enter fg Enter.\n\n\nSsh escape sequences begin with ~; the tilde is only recognized after a newline. ~ Ctrl+Z puts ssh into the background. ~C enters a command line where you can create or remove a forwarding.\n\nA: If your file is small enough you can encode it with base64 and then decode it locally:\n\nremote.example.net$ base64 <myfile\n(copy the output)\n\n\nlocal.example.net$ base64 -d >myfile\n(copy the output)\nCtrl+D\n\nOriginal answer where I got this (and tested out) from: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/2869/194134\n\nA: I came up with a way to do this with standard ssh. It's a script that duplicates the current ssh connection, finds your working directory on the remote machine and copies back the file you specify to the local machine. It needs 2 very small scripts (1 remote, 1 local) and 2 lines in your ssh config. The steps are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add these 2 lines to your ~/.ssh/config:\nControlMaster auto\nControlPath ~/.ssh/socket-%r@%h:%p\n\nNow if you have an ssh connection to machineX open, you wont need\npasswords to open another one.\n\n*Make a 1-line script on the remote machine called ~/.grabCat.sh\n\\#!/bin/bash<br>\ncat \"$(pwdx $(pgrep -u $(whoami) bash) | grep -o '/.*' | tail -n 1)\"/$1\n\n\n*Make a script on the local machine called ~/.grab.sh\n\\#!/bin/bash\n[ -n \"$3\" ] && dir=\"$3\" || dir=\".\"\nssh \"$1\" \".grabCat.sh $2\" > \"$dir/$2\"\n\n\n*and make an alias for grab.sh in (~/.bashrc or wherever):\nalias grab=~/.grab.sh\n\nThat's it, all done. Now if you're logged in to machineX:/some/directory, just fire up a new terminal and type\ngrab machineX filename\n\nThat puts the file in your current working directory on the local machine. You can specify a different location as a third argument to \"grab\". \nNote: Obviously both scripts must be \"executable\", ie chmod u+x filename.\n\nA: It isn't over the active SSH connection, but scp copies files using the same mechanisms and permissions as does ssh.\n\nA: This is not possible with a default ssh session, but you could use a script instead of ssh, that starts something like a simple ftp or rsh server on you local system and runs ssh with the necessary options to set up a tunnel back to your desktop for connecting to this server.\n\nA: konsole has that ability via \"Edit->ZModem Upload\" menu while you are in an remote session (or Ctrl-Alt-U).\nPlease note: package lrzsz must be installed first.\nFor me looks like works only for uploading ASCII files.\n\nA: Surprisingly i don't see any mention of the good old Midnight Commander here. To my mind, it's probably the most universal & usefull file manager for shell with power-capabilities, one of the \"must have\" tools for the case, which is also allowing you to connect through SSH, FTP, SFTP as well, while on the second panel you can open any other (your local) filesystem and so work with files freely. \nAll you need is: apt-get install mc (from universe)\nAfter that, run mc, open the menu for left or right panel, choose shell connection, enter username@remote-ip, the password - actually, that's it.. copy (here: download) files/folders from one machine to another with F5, move with F6, and so on according to buttons below. For the old MS-users: just like in NC for DOS\n\nA: Since you are connecting from a desktop, I guess you can open a second terminal. \nThis is how I often do: \n\n\n*\n\n*from the first terminal, the one where the ssh session is running, I get the full path of the file I need to get, using either realpath myfile or readlink -f myfile (older Ubuntu releases doesn't preinstall realpath) and copy it.\n\n*from the second terminal I use scp or sftp to get the file, pasting the full path I got before. For example: scp user@host:/etc/some/file ./\nIt's quite basic, but it's also easy to remember and doesn't need any extra package to work. \n\n\nA: WAY overthinking this, folks.  I was looking for all the deep, dark, complex answers too.  It turns out, you can do this right from Dolphin straight out of the can.  fish://username@server:port\n", "Q: Getting access to network server I logon to my server successfully and can transfer files off the server to my desktop.

In all honest opinions, right now VMWare is the best of the best when it comes to unmodified virtualisation because they support Aero at it's best and have the ability to pipe games with decent FPS.\n\nA: It is possible, but not really recommended. That is because of the big difference in hardware your Windows 7 system may go insane :)\n( a virtual machine has completely different hardware than a real machine )\nEven if your Windows system is able to recover from that much hardware change, \nyou might experience performance lost.\nMy recommendation is to backup your data from the Windows system, then fresh install Windows 7 in a virtual machine and restore your backup. Doing that will assure the best performance.\n\nA: You will have  problems with hardware detection, drivers etc. as 7 included these during installation. On your virtual machine you won't have these components as they are provided only virtually (giving you the chance to move your machines host independently).\nMind also that a full blown 7 install will take considerable resources from your host, even if it may only be disk space.\nA fresh 7 install gives you the chance to clean up and install only those components that you really need sometimes.

I tried running Photorec and I was able to recover some 18 GB of data back. Photorec threw an error after recovering 18 GB stating \"Segmentation Fault\". Was it because my windows drive was hardly ever defragged? If so, what routines/precautions I can take to make sure if something like this happens again on Windows or Linux side, Photorec wont throw the \"Segmentation Fault\" error.(Of course one precaution being backing up data regularly :-) )\n\nA: A Segmentation Fault is usually a programming error. There's nothing you can do about but always upgrade to the newest version and sending a bug report to the developer.\n\nA: The segmentation fault is unrelated to the problem with the hard drive. It indicates something went wrong with the software you were using at the time, possibly photorec itself.\nOptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a newer version of photorec as it may have fixed that problem\n\n*Use testdisk, which is a tool from the same author as photorec and can do similar things, though it may be slightly harder to use.\n\n*Try photorec again; it may not happen the next time.\n\n", "Q: What are .run files? What exactly are .run files and what are they used for? I've seen a couple of those lately and I'm simply wondering what file format it is used for.\n\nA: A .run file is normally a custom made program which needs to be executed in order to install a program. These are not supported generally as they don't track where files go and don't normally provide an uninstall method. there is no way to be sure what the script will do to your system so they're considered unsafe.\nThey are close to the windows exe file and as such come with the same issues. If you know what you're doing and are happy about taking the risks, you can execute them with these commands:\nchmod 755 programinstall.run\nsudo ./programinstall.run\n\n\nA: They are usually executables of some form. They're not neccessarily installers although most of the ones you'll see are.\nAs Martin says, and assuming we're talking about an installer, they're usually not as good as packages for when you want to remove them however there are some installers (I'm thinking mainly of the Loki and LGP game installers) do track where they install to and provide a pretty robust uninstall binary.\nAnd what Martin says will work for most binaries, most .run files I've seen are hybrid shell script and compressed binary elements. This means you can just run them through sh. An example with the NVIDIA driver installer:\nsudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-260.19.06.run\n\nYou can check to see what a file really is (well it works most of the time) with file:\nfile NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-260.19.06.run\n\n\nNVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-260.19.06.run: POSIX shell script text executable\n\n", "Q: Windows Home Server equivalent What Windows Home Server equivalents are available for Ubuntu?

If you do so, then there is a great risk for spoiling your hardware EPROM (e.g. if the virtual machine or the USB connection crashes at some point during the upgrade process). \nI recommend the far easiest and safest way: plug in any PC/Laptop running Windows2000 or later, upgrade from there and be happy. \n\nA: Well, here's how I managed to do it: I ran the Windows firmware update utility under Wine and it worked.\nI don't recommend this solution as a lot of things could go very wrong by doing it, but it worked for me.\nI wish HP would have a tool for Ubuntu users.\n\nA: Normally hp firmware is loaded into the device at runtime, you don't need to really manage the firmware as hplip will come with the latest available.\nIt may be possible to extract the firmware from the exe and give it to hplip for your printer, but it would be hassle.\nhttp://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web//tech_docs/man_pages/index.html\n\nA: For the record, I've just updated my CP2025dn firmware using wine, from the command line.

I would like to mount it to a local directory in my notebook automatically every time I login at home so before mounting it I need to do a ping to see if it is answering (which means I'm home).\nI already have the script to mount it (see below) but I have two questions:\n1) How to use the answer from ping in order to see if its answering? I believe I have to use grep together with the ping command, but since I'm a new *nix user I'm not very fluent with it yet.\n2) Where is the best place to put this script?\nThe mount command I have is this:\nsudo mount -t cifs //myIpAddress/remoteDir /media/MyLibrary -o username=myUsername,password=myPassword,domain=myDomain,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777\n\nThanks!\n\nA: No need for grep or anything like that, just do this:\nping -c 4 foo && sudo mount ...\nThis basically uses the fact that ping returns true if the ping works, the -c limits it to 4 pings before returning. You can also do something if ping fails like this:\nping -c 4 foo || echo \"FAILED!\"\nThe other thing to consider is why you're mounting on login and not in your fstab, there are some good guides to mounting smb file storage online:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba/SambaClientGuide\nhttp://www.mattvanstone.com/2006/06/automatically_mounting_smb_sha/\n", "Q: Is there a way to turn off individual screens? I use xset to turn off my screens like this:\nxset dpms force off\n\nIs there any way to turn off a single screen when you have more than one associated with the same X display?\n\nA: If you are using stock Ubuntu Desktop you should be able to use System > Preferences > Monitors.  This should show all of your monitors, click on the one you wish to disable, and then use the 'on/off' radio buttons to disable that specific monitor.\nIf you want to do this from the command line you should be able to use xrandr --output <name> --off to disable the output which should trigger the monitor to power down.\n\nA: Problem with existing answer\nAlthough there was an answer seven years ago with three up-votes it wasn't accepted because it causes all open windows on the shut-off display to migrate to the remaining active display(s).\nSoftware based brightness\nOn a laptop you can control brightness through the graphics card controlling the LCD panel. With external TV's and monitors you need a software solution to turn brightness down to 0. Turning it to zero is closest I've come to the illusion of turning it off whilst keeping the active windows on that external display.\nShort version\nFrom the command line (without scripts) use:\n$ xrandr | grep \" connected\"\nHDMI-0 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 1107mm x 623mm\neDP-1-1 connected primary 1920x1080+3840+2160 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 382mm x 215mm\nDP-1-1 connected 3840x2160+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 1600mm x 900mm\n\nThis shows you the list of monitor names assigned by xrandr. Now if you want to set DP-1-1 brightness off use:\nxrandr --output DP-1-1 --brightness 0\n\n\nSony TV bash script\nHere's one of three scripts I've written:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# NAME: sony\n# PATH: /mnt/e/bin\n# DESC: Set brightness of Sony TV\n# DATE: Dec 9, 2017.\n\nif [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then\n    xrandr --verbose | grep -A5 \"^HDMI-0\" > /tmp/sony\n    head -n1 /tmp/sony\n    echo \"$(tput setaf 1)\" ; tail -n1 /tmp/sony ; echo \"$(tput sgr0)\"\n    rm /tmp/sony\n    echo 'One argument required for brightness level, e.g. \"sony .63\"'\n    echo 'will set brightness level of Sony TV to level .63 using xrandr'\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nxrandr --output HDMI-0  --brightness \"$1\"\n\nTo turn off the display you would use sony 0\nCalling script with no parameters\nWhen you call the script with no parameters it displays the xrandr screen name along with the current brightness in red. You can change the red color to another by modifying this line:\necho \"$(tput setaf 1)\" ; tail -n1 /tmp/sony ; echo \"$(tput sgr0)\"\n\nAfter setaf change the 1 to:\n\n*\n\n*2 for green\n\n*3 for orange\n\n*4 for blue, etc.\n\nModifying and installing script\nChange the two occurrences of HDMI-0to match your screen name. You can get a list of all your screens typing xrandrin the terminal.\nPlace the script in a directory in your path such as:\n/usr/local/bin/sony\n\nMark the script as executable using:\nsudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/sony\n\nChoosing which directory:/usr/local/bin vs ~/bin\nWhen you create scripts in /usr/local/bin you must use sudo powers.

I'm running a web server and the public_html folder is in a windows network drive shared by samba on Ubuntu Server 10.04.\nI have apache2 VH set to point to the folder and it works great. However, when my Drupal 6 install tries to create its default files it can not write to the locations required.\nNow, because this is only a dev machine; I have added www-data user and group to the visudo with ALL=(ALL) ALL\nI have also gone and changed the httpd.conf file to have the following:\n<Directory /media/samba>\n      Order Allow,Deny\n      Allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nWhen I change the envvars username to username with admin privileges it works just fine. Is there something i need to do with chmod to get www-data to work?\n\nA: You need to change your samba mount configuration so that you give permission to the www-data user and group to write to it. You may or may not have the ability to set specific directory permissions, but if not you'll have to set the entire drive the write access (which is bad for security).\nI would personally advise using nfs instead of samba shares for networked storage and the use of ext3 or other fully featured file system.\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-do-i-set-permissions-to-samba-shares.html\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba/SambaClientGuide\nhttp://www.mattvanstone.com/2006/06/automatically_mounting_smb_sha/\n", "Q: How to kill applications I have been playing around with Ubuntu installing new themes and and docks. Sometimes during the installation, whole screen just hangs. What is the best way in Ubuntu to Kill a process/application? Anything similar to Ctrl + Alt + Del of windows?\n\nA: In System->Admin you have an application called System Monitor, this is the equivalent of the windows task manager.\nEdit: for later versions of Ubuntu (writing this on a PC running 13.10), you will find the system monitor through the dash (top left). Just type system monitor or parts of it in the dash and look for the System Monitor application..\n\n\nA: Firstly you should know the PID of the application you want to kill.\nyou can use ps to get this.\nps aux | grep \"$appName\" | grep -v 'grep'\n\nThen use kill.(Ensure you have the privilege to kill it.)\nkill  \"$PID\"\n\n\nA: If your screen hangs, you can switch to virtual console (Alt-Ctrl-F1), login with your user, type top, detect CPU eating process, and then run skill process_name. If it is system (root) process, use sudo skill process_name\n\nA: You can use tty by pressing Ctrl+ Alt+ F2 and then login and run following command:-\nkill -9 -1\n\nFrom man kill,\n\nkill -9 -1\n       Kill all processes you can kill.\n\nThis will return to login screen and after login all process works freshly.\n\nA: If you right click on the Gnome panel, and choose \"Add to Panel\", on the list you'll find a \"Force Quit\" button. If you add that to the panel, you can click on it, and then on an unresponsive program, to kill it.\nYou might also want to learn about the kill and killall command line programs.\n\nA: You can also restart X.Type Ctrl+Alt+Backspace\nIn ubuntu 10.04 these keys will be disabled by default.To enable it,\n\n\n*\n\n*Goto System-->Preferences-->Keyboard\n\n*Select the Layouts tab and click on the Options button.\n\n*Select Key sequence to kill the X server and enable Control + Alt + Backspace.\n\nA: This is my personal list of killing:\n\n\n*\n\n*kill <pid_number> example: kill 8888 effect: kill application that has PID 8888. \n\n*kill -9 <pid_number> example: kill -9 8888 effect: same with above but more extreme and forceful. \n\n*killall <application_name> example killall firefox effect: kill application or application instance that has name firefox. You don't have to know PID number, and this is my most favorite.\n\n*kill -9 -1 effect: kill all processes including X Server so you can go back to display manager (LightDM, GDM, or KDM). Another name for this command is relogin. And this command is a substution for clicking Log Out button.  \n\n*Alt+Printscreen+REISUB effect: force restart; same with Ctrl+Alt+Del in Windows. It is very useful to avoid HDD damage.\n\n*Alt+Printscreen+REISUO effect: force shutdown, like Ctrl+Alt+Del but do shutdown instead of restart. Only differ 1 last char (O and B). \n\n*xkill effect: change your pointer to skull. If you click a GUI Windows with that, the Window will definitely be die.\n\n\nYou can see PID of a process by commands ps aux, top, htop, or graphically by GNOME System Monitor.\n\nA: Not quite like CtrlAltDel of Windows, but you can also kill with xkill. Just go to the \"run\" dialog (Alt+F2), type in xkill and your mouse pointer will change to an \"x\". Point on the application that you want to kill and click, and it'll be killed. Can sometimes be much quicker than loading the System Monitor.\n\nA: Also a quick hot key combination using GUI method works with my Ubuntu 14.04 (xfce) just press Ctrl+Alt+Esc and an xkill cursor should appear, just click on an application to kill.\n\nA: Open the terminal and type:\npkill <application_name>  \n\nwhere <application_name> is replaced by the name of the application in the command which is used to start the application from the terminal. If you don't know the process name of an application you can look it up in the System Monitor.\n", "Q: How do I change the default text editor?

However, there usually is only one such editor detected so update-alternatives --config won't work; you'll have to add the editor you want.\nE.g. to add notepadqq:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gnome-text-editor gnome-text-editor /usr/bin/notepadqq 50\nsudo update-alternatives --config gnome-text-editor\n\n\nA: For some reason I had to use xdg-mime:\nxdg-mime default org.gnome.gedit.desktop text/plain # For current user\n\nyou can use your system-wide .desktop files under /usr/share/applications/\nor local files under ~/.local/share/applications/ or create your own.\nedit:\nIt's also helpful to know that user configurations are stored in ~/.config/mimeapps.list which overrides the defaults.\nsource: https://stackoverflow.com/a/64850938/9085151\n\nA: If you would like to replace gedit with any other text editor for all file types, the easiest is to edit the defaults.list file located here:\n/usr/share/applications/defaults.list\n\nJust find and replace all gedit.desktop references with your own editor (in this case emacs.desktop).\nYou need root permissions to edit the file. So, just do: \nsudo -H gedit /usr/share/applications/defaults.list\n\nSave the file, close it and it's done.\n\nA: A more robust solution would be to replace the bindings in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list. \nsed -i 's/gedit/emacs/' /usr/share/applications/defaults.list\n\n\nA: I don't use a DE, but for my configurations the next command is the best:\n/usr/bin/select-editor \n\n\n\n*\n\n*it selects your default sensible-editor from all installed editors\n\n*must run with current user\n\n*you must have more than one editor in your system\n\n\nMan pages select-editor\n\nA: Here is what worked in my case:\n\n*\n\n*Right click on a text file.\n\n*Choose \"Properties\" (not \"Open With...\")\n\n*Click on the \"Open With\" tab.\n\n*Choose your new text editor.\n\n*Mark chosen text editor using a button \"Set as default\".\n\nThis also works on 12.04 and 13.04.\n@ Edit: based on comments it does work on all distros until 20.04\n\nA: Right click on a text file, point to \"Open With\" and it'll show other editors in a sub-menu.

It's not ideal but I found getting rid of the bottom task bar seemed to let me get rid of the 'ghost' of the frozen plasma widget too.\nIf you want to restore the KDE desktop to default, deleting the .kde directory in your home directory will do it. Then just log back in (back up your .kde dir just in case, though!).\nBear in mind that you'll lose other KDE specific settings, too (like your keyring settings, and so on). There IS a specific file in the .kde dir you can delete to reset plasma/desktop-specific stuff, but when I tried it it only seemed to work by removing the whole directory - which is why I recommend backing it up first.\n\nA: The simple answer is to toggle the desktop effects on and off once. Press the key combination SHIFT+ALT+F12 once, which will toggle desktop effects off. Your desktop will look a bit ugly, but just wait a few seconds and then press the same keys again, which will turn it back on. Your little artifact should be gone now. As to why it happens I'm not sure, but this fixes the issue after login. You'll probably have to repeat it every other login or so.\nAs a \"bonus\", If this happens a lot, you may want to put the \"Toggle desktop compositing\" widget on your taskbar. Click the little cashew icon to the far right on your taskbar, then click \"Add widgets\" in the little window that appears. In the top left of that window is a little search/filter input box. Type \"toggle\" (without the quotes) and select the \"Toggle desktop effects\" widget by doublie-clicking on it. You should now have a little button on your panel that you can click instead of having to click SHIFT+ALT+F12.\n", "Q: Split ogg-theora video files without re-encoding? Good evening all, \nI have decided to rip my entire DVD collection to Ogg-Theora video, specifically a few different TV series' that I have so I don't have to keep digging the discs out.  To do this, I have been using dvd::rip to pull the individual vob files from the disc and then using ffmpeg2theora to encode.  This process has been working great for me until I hit a slight snag.

Now, how do I split this file into the individual episodes?  \nI would prefer not to re-encode these, and obviously any prospective program would need a easy way for me to set the 'cut' points.  I have used a few similar programs in Windows (for other formats), but I am unsure of what is out there for Ubuntu.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Thanks!\n\nA: Thanks for the answers I have received so far!  I think I have found a utility that works for my needs.  After some research, it seems that Xiph.org (the makers of theora) have a utility that has a chop functionality that takes a time offset (much like the ffmpeg utility that aking1012 mentioned ) called oggz-tools\nsudo apt-get install oggz-tools\n\nIt does a direct stream cut as well, meaning the quality stays the same and the process only takes a about 10-15 seconds.

Is it possible that the package will be broken in the backup because some of its files came from the old version and some from the newly-upgraded version? How likely is this?\n\nA: Running a backup during an upgrade is not recommended. A typical case when you need your backup is the case when an upgrade is broken. Therefore I recommend to backup after you checked your upgrade is OK.\nHowever this depends entirely on which files are backuped.

I am trying to monitor the USB traffic in Ubuntu 10.0.4. According to many websites, the usbmon is already included in the kernel, but typing modprobe usbmon. It will return \"Can't find module\".\nDo I have to recompile the usbmon module? \n\nA: Well you can tell for sure if your kernel was compiled with USBMON by running:\ngrep CONFIG_USB_MON /boot/config-`uname -r`\n\nIn my case, I see CONFIG_USB_MON=y as the response... This means it's built directly into the kernel instead of as a module. I built my own kernel but to my knowledge, the .config used stems from a Maverick kernel.\nI don't have a standard Maverick box to test on but my media centre box is just upgrading now. Won't be too long.\nMy media centre is on Mav now. Still returning y so it is built into the kernel.\n\nA: Usbmon is directly compiled in the ubuntu kernel ( not as a module ). I tested on maverick but you can confirm that on 10.04 doing this.\nGo to the 'config' folder of your kernel:\ncd /usr/src/linux-headers-<yourversion>-generic/include/config\n\nSearch usbmon configuration:\ngrep -rn \"CONFIG_USB_MON\" *\n\nIf your output is something like this:\nauto.conf:1494:CONFIG_USB_MON=y\ntristate.conf:1040:CONFIG_USB_MON=Y\n\nThen usbmod is already compiled inside your kernel.\nAlso you can refer to this bug (that was marked as Invalid):\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/364085\n", "Q: Change KDE kickoff slide effect speed How can I change or increase the KDE kickoff slide effect speed?\nI don't mean when moving from one tab to another (Favourites to Applications, for instance) - I mean from menu to submenu (so clicking on \"Internet\" to reveal a list of internet-oriented applications, like a web browser, IM client etc.).\nI find the default sliding speed to be just slightly too choppy and slow and pretty irksome (especially when the rest of the KDE desktop is so smooth).\n\nA: You can change the animation speed from the \"System settings\" application. Open up the [K] menu, select \"System settings\" (or type systemsettings and press enter). In the application, select \"Desktop effects\". This configuration page has an \"Animation speed\" setting, where you can choose everything from reaally, painstakingly slow, to \"instant\".\nAs an added bonus, on the \"All effects\" tab in this configuration window, there is a checkbox for \"Sliding popups\". If you cannot find an animation setting that works for you, you could try turning off the sliding animation altogether by disabling that particular effect (uncheck the box for \"Sliding popups\").\n\nA: It's not possible to change the speed. At least the current release of KDE (4.5) doesn't support changing it.\nFuture releases of KDE might support changing the animation speed.\n", "Q: GNOME Mplayer: \"Failed to open VDPAU backend libvdpau_nvidia.so\" error Using GNOME Mplayer everytime I play a video, I get the annoying dialog pop-out in the screenshot below.\n\n\nA: I'm using the proprietary NVIDIA driver and I fixed this by creating a symlink to the VDPAU lib:\nln -s /usr/lib/vdpau/libvdpau_nvidia.so.1 /usr/lib/libvdpau_nvidia.so\n\nThis has the benefit of actually enabling VDPAU rather than falling back to XV or X11. Of course you need a video card that supports VDPAU acceleration.\n\nA: You can suppress all dialogues like this in mplayer variants by editing ~/.mplayer/config in the editor of your choice and somewhere in the file including really-quiet=\"1\". I use plain mplayer (no GUI at all) but that shouldn't change things, this worked for me in GMplayer too.

But do not worry, you are now blessed with this answer, and the video output driver can be specified on the command line (e.g. -vo xv).\nThe order of configuration options that mplayer will scrawl before it finally decides to (only) try the (missing) vdpau driver is not so obvious, but I think it roughly goes like this,\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the ~/.mplayer/config for the (user specific) default video output driver, if any\n\n*Then check /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf for the (system specific) default video output driver, if any\n\n*Then check in the compile options that mplayer was built with for a default (build specific).\n\n\nIf the mplayer command you were using was compiled with the vdpau option and there are no default video output drivers specified in ~/.mplayer/config or /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf (which is either a common occurrence or I am the only person on the planet earth who has ever had problems with a configuration option on a linux box) then it will fall back to the compiled default which in this case was vdpau.\nAnother similar issue is that mplayer may work fine while gmplayer gives this same error using the same options you just tried with mplayer. Well guess what? gmplayer uses yet another config file, ~/.mplayer/gui.conf, and it will default to the last video driver specified (or defaulted to in the compile options). So again, just specify a video output driver on the command line, or put one in one of the myriad of config files mentioned here.\n\nA: However, a little setting can sort out the problem as follows;\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Edit → Preferences in the GNOME Player menubar\n\n*Select the \"Player\" tab\n\n*Select x11 for the Video Output\n\n*Close preferences and try to open the video file again.\n\n\nYour problem should have been resolved.\n\nA: Right click the Application icon and select Edit Menus, select the menu item for mplayer and edit the Properties > Command\n\nA: Note: Everything before update was included because it may be useful for someone else, and was posted written either before testing or when I was lacking info on the situation.\nIf you are using an nVidia card, install the proprietary drivers.\n\nFglrx is the official (closed source)\n  ATI/AMD driver, though there are also\n  official open source drivers included\n  in Ubuntu by default, and these work\n  just as well with many (older,\n  usually) cards. vdpau (sorry if I\n  misspelled earlier) is only currently\n  available on nVidia and (to my\n  knowledge) Intel cards. MPlayer\n  supports this API for video\n  acceleration, but it is not needed to\n  play videos. As I am not an avid\n  MPlayer user (I use Totem or VLC\n  Media Player to play videos and\n  DVDs), I will have to do some more\n  digging for the correct entry in the\n  configuration file.\nI would not suggest compiling the\n  libvdpau.so file, as it would quite\n  honestly be useless in your\n  configuration, and if you were to get\n  an nVidia card with the proprietary\n  drivers you would not need to install\n  anything extra anyway.\nOne suggestion I would give you is to\n  install MPlayer-gui \n  (temporarily) and see if when\n  launching this allows you to disable\n  the use of vdpau from the gui options.\n  Then you could revert to the normal\n  MPlayer and it should work without any\n  further problems. If that doesn't\n  work, then you might have to end up\n  compiling :( to disable the use of\n  vdpau (and to avoid having to buy a\n  new graphics card lol).\n\nUPDATE\nDon't laugh, (okay, laugh at me, go ahead ;) - but I just opened Gnome-MPlayer for myself and in preferences, you can choose your video output module! All you need to do now is to choose one that works for you (vaapi should work on your graphics card).\nUnder the MPlayer tab (not shown), you can also add command line parameters to pass to MPlayer just in case.\n\n\nCustomary screen-shot :)\n\nThe Wikipedia page for vaapi should help you to understand most of the video acceleration methods in detail (if you follow the links recommended in the article).\n\nA: add -vo xv\n\n\nA: This command line helped me: mplayer -demuxer mov filename.mov\n\nA: Installing libvdpau-va-gl solved it for me, but it was a software solution.\nTry setting export VDPAU_DRIVER=nvidia\n", "Q: How I get twidge to work with identi.ca?

I read today on Phoronix that there is a 200 line patch to the Linux Kernel  which dramatically improves desktop responsiveness. \nHow can Ubuntu users get this in a way that's supported?\n\nA: Discussion regarding this specific patch took place on the Ubuntu kernel-team mailing list:\nhttps://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kernel-team/2010-November/013498.html\nBut let me try to elaborate even more generically about the best way for any patch to make its way into the Ubuntu kernel...\nFirst, it's the preferred policy of the Ubuntu Kernel Team that patches be submitted and accepted upstream before being pulled into the Ubuntu kernel.  It's a large maintenance burden on the Ubuntu Kernel Team to have to maintain out of tree patches.  Additionally, if the patch will benefit the entire Kernel Community, it should go upstream first.\nOnce the patch has been accepted upstream, it will eventually make its way into the Ubuntu kernel automatically.  A cherry-pick or pull request could also be made if one so desired, see the page, KernelPatches, for more information.\nIf the patch needs to be applied as an SRU (stable release update) to a previous Ubuntu release it's best to get the patch accepted into the corresponding upstream stable 2.6.x.y tree.  As a part of our normal kernel SRU process, we continually rebase to the latest upstream stable kernel.  Thus we would again eventually get the patch automatically.\n\nA: You can use a simple \"hack\" posted by a RedHat developer on a mailing list, that doesn't require patching the kernel to get the same thing. Read about it here: Alternative To The \"200 Lines Kernel Patch That Does Wonders\" Which You Can Use Right Away\n\nA: I've just read the lkml thread and hope I can offer some information - although not about getting the patch into Ubuntu. As a post on the linked Ubuntu list says, it's probably going to be in 2.6.38 anyway.\nThe patch automatically groups process based on TTYs. There is a lot of discussion/argument on the lkml that says this means it isn't relevant for typical desktop usage - that it makes no difference to interactive applications. The test cases are all based around \"start a CPU intensive task from a terminal then look at the responsiveness of another task\". So compiling a kernel and trying to watch a video, for example.\nThat's not to say it's not good, but the general \"desktop responsivity improved by an order of magnitude\" type headlines could be misleading if you never run CPU intensive tasks connected to a TTY. I could be wrong of course though!\nThere were some mentions of ways of achieving a very similar result by adding to your bash scripts and allowing all users to create cgroups. This will only work if current Ubuntu kernels have cgroups enabled. The relevant posts are:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=128993140308849&w=2\n\n*http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=128993874020246&w=2\nObviously this isn't answering the question, but it could be used to determine whether the patch is as magical as hoped.\n\nA: \nHow can Ubuntu users get this in a way that's supported?\n\nEmphasis mine. The only way you'll get it in a supported way is by waiting for Ubuntu to pull it into the Ubuntu kernel. As this is really just making it to the kernel mailing list, it's fresh to the point where all testing is fairly anecdotal and I imagine it will be some time before it's ready to be mass-deployed.\nSomewhere between the next release and a long time would be my uneducated guess.\n\nBut if you're a big boy (or girl) and you can cope with a broken kernel if things go wrong (ie you know how to use grub), you can patch and compile your own kernel.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download a patch. There are different versions but the best on its own was posted below by another user: http://pavlinux.ru/krnl/sched_autogroup-2.6.36.patch.bz2\n\n*Download the kernel source for the version your patch targets. In this case 2.6.36. You can get vanilla (that is original, unmodified by the Ubuntu kernel team) kernel sources from kernel.org and extract it.\n\n*Save the patch somewhere and apply it by cding into the kernel source dir and running: patch -p1 < /path/to/patch (you need the patch package for this... Which I think comes as part of build-essential if it's not installed by default)\n\n*And then continue with the rest of the \"old fashioned\" build process... I really wouldn't bother with the newer methods as they're aimed at Ubuntu/Debian-sanctioned kernel sources... Plus the old way seems easier (to me).\nBuilding kernels isn't hard but you can mess it up if you stray too far from the accepted path. And you  won't get official support if things go wrong.\n\nAlternatively, there are more and more kernels emerging with the patch built in (or at least in the source tree, awaiting the next release).\n\n\n*\n\n*I believe Zen Kernel has this patch in their tree but I'm not sure if it's in any builds yet.\n\n*The Liquorix Kernel has this baked in now too.\n\n\nNote: both these kernels (and probably others too) deviate from the Ubuntu way of doing kernels somewhat. You may find (as I did when I moved to Liquorix) that CPU frequency scaling stops working or suspend gets broken. There are usually fixes and workarounds, but chances are you won't get support from AskUbuntu or the rest of the Ubuntu communtiy as we can't check every single kernel out there.\n\nA: As of 2011-01-18, Linux 2.6.38-rc1 includes the said patch.\nSee the related Phoronix news and Linus post.\nAs of 2011-01-29, the Natty Narwhal daily build ships with Linux 2.6.38.\nSo, there are currently two solutions :\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the latest Ubuntu 11.04 image.\n\n*Or wait for the latest official Ubuntu 11.04 release in april 2011.\n\n\nA: I just picked this discussion up now and its very interesting.

I want to ask if we're gonna see a version of Ubuntu such as Kubuntu for example but with GNOME shell and not with Unity ?

I have a python package previously installed via apt(by default). Now I want to install new version and compile it manually from the sources with all the required modules.\nHow can I do that? I suppose that\napt-get purge python\n\nAnd then install from sources is not possible because python have lots of dependencies and will uninstall all of them in this case.\nWhat is the right way to do that?\n\nA: You'll want to look at the command sudo apt-get build-dep python which will install all the build dependencies, but not the package itself.\n\nA: From your question I may not have understood what you are up to do. Please forgive me if I was wrong. In any case you don't want to purge python as much of Ubuntu depends on it.\nTo install an updated application (written in python) from source you most likely don't need to compile it as it can be run in the python interpreter provided with Ubuntu. When it comes to dependencies you may have to install them manually: check with the documentation that comes with your application. \nIn case the program update includes a DEB file you can perform the update conveniently with your preferred package manager.\n\nA: No, you don't really need to purge your python installation, you just have to make the Ubuntu default version and the source compiled version live together peacefully.\nTo achieve that just compile the source in your home folder or, if you want to install for all users, user another installation prefix ( e.g. /usr/local/ instead of /usr/ )\nObviously only one python should be set in the system PATH ( and that should be the default one ).\nThen to run a python script with the new version ( useful if you want to use python 3.0 while Ubuntu has 2.x installed ) just type:\n/usr/local/bin/python myscript.py\n\nalso you can create a symlink of the new python to /usr/bin and call it /usr/bin/python30.\nHope this helps :)\n", "Q: Where is coreutils in ubuntu-minimal? I want to install ubuntu-minimal. I can't see coreutils as a dependency, although there are still plenty of other packages that ubuntu-minimal depends on. Will I have to install it seperately or is it a dependency of one of these other packages in ubuntu-minimal? If so, which one?\n\nA: The coreutils is marked Essential: yes, so it's always included in an installation, and dpkg will warn you in a rather non-ignorable way if you try to remove it. Packages do not have to declare dependencies on essential packages, unless they need a particular version (for example, dpkg (another essential package) depends on coreutils (>= 5.93-1) in Ubuntu 10.04).\n\nA: It's a dependency of both the kernel and dpkg so I'm fairly certain it'll be on ubuntu-minimal.\nTo see essential packages, run this:\naptitude search '~E'\n\nYou'll see something like this:\ni A apt - Advanced front-end for dpkg    \ni  base-files - Debian base system miscellaneous files\ni  base-passwd - Debian base system master password and group files\ni  bash - The GNU Bourne Again SHell\ni  bsdutils - Basic utilities from 4.4BSD-Lite\ni  coreutils - GNU core utilities\ni  dash - POSIX-compliant shell\ni  debianutils - Miscellaneous utilities specific to Debian\ni A diffutils - File comparison utilities\ni  dpkg - Debian package management system\ni  e2fsprogs - ext2/ext3/ext4 file system utilities\ni  findutils - utilities for finding files--find, xargs\ni  grep - GNU grep, egrep and fgrep\ni  gzip - GNU compression utilities\ni  hostname - utility to set/show the host name or domain name\ni  login - system login tools\ni  mount - Tools for mounting and manipulating filesystems\ni  ncurses-base - basic terminal type definitions\ni  ncurses-bin - terminal-related programs and man pages\ni  perl-base - minimal Perl system\ni  python-minimal - minimal subset of the Python language (default version)\ni  sed - The GNU sed stream editor\ni  tar - GNU version of the tar archiving utility\ni  util-linux - Miscellaneous system utilities\n\n", "Q: How can I collect all svg icons from my computer? I want to make use of all the icons which are installed on my computer to make art, posters and designs, what is the best way of making them all easily browsable from inkscape?\n\nA: If you want to make a copy of them all in to one directory try the following:\nsudo updatedb\nmkdir $HOME/svg\nlocate *.svg | awk -F'/' '{X=NF-1;Y=NF-2;Z=NF-3}{ system(\"cp \"$0\" '$HOME'/svg/\"$Z\"\\\"-\\\"\"$Y\"\\\"-\\\"\"$X\"\\\"-\\\"\"$NF) }'\n\nThat will copy all SVG files into an svg folder in your home. You can of course adjust those paths as needed. Since a lot of the System SVG's (Icon sets) are the same name among theme. This will copy them into the SVG folder like so:\nThis /usr/share/icons/Humanity/actions/22/mail-read.svg becomes ~/svg/Humanity-actions-22-mail-read.svg meaning you can view them in one Nautilus folder without having to traverse often cumbersome directory structures.\nAnother alternative - to keep all your SVGs in the same location, but have them update when theme icon-sets get updated - would be to symlink them all to that folder. As long as you performed a \"Save-As\" instead of overwriting icons when working on them:\nsudo updatedb\nmkdir $HOME/svg\nlocate *.svg | awk -F'/' '{X=NF-1;Y=NF-2;Z=NF-3}{ system(\"ln -s \"$0\" '$HOME'/svg/\"$Z\"\\\"-\\\"\"$Y\"\\\"-\\\"\"$X\"\\\"-\\\"\"$NF) }'\n\n\nA: In nautilus:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to /usr/\n\n*Click the search button and type .svg\n\n*Go to the bookmarks window and click \"Add Bookmark\"\n\n\nThe virtual search folder will update automatically. It wont be fast... But it should work.\n\nA: I've found locate to be the fastest/most useful tool for things like this. Try running locate *.svg > ~/svgs.txt in a terminal or from Alt+F2.\nTo access them from inkscape, you could possibly do a little scripting (I'm no bash genius :P), so that you produce symlinks to a new folder with all the existing svgs (from the output of locate). Maybe if you can make a script that reads the contents of each line and does ln -s $line ~/Art/svgs or something.\n\nA: You can use locate and it will be fast but will only contain the files since the last updatedb was executed (usually executed from /etc/cron.daily/mlocate)\nlocate -i *.svg\n\nthe -i option make the pattern case insensitive.\n\nA: sudo find / -name *.svg \n\nThis will list all files with .svg extension \nTo get the output to a file:\nsudo find / -name *.svg > output.txt\n\nUPDATE: \nTo copy all .svg files in to a specific folder\nfind ./ -name \"*.svg\" -exec cp '{}' ./mnt/output_folder/ ';'\n\nThis will copy all .svg files to /mnt/output_folder\n", "Q: Can I simulate a slow hard drive?

Troubleshooting is difficult because I can't reliably reproduce it.\nShort of simply gobbling IO with a high priority process, is there any way for me to simulate having a slow hard drive?\n\nA: \n# echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\nThat'll slow you down :)\nIt'll force you to read from disk, instead of taking\nadvantage of the cached page.\nIf you really wanted to get sophisticated you could do\nsomething like fake a read error every nth time using \nthe scsi fault injection framework.\nhttp://scsifaultinjtst.sourceforge.net/\n\nA: Have a USB 1.1 hub? Or a slow SD card? They'll get you down to under 10mbps.\n\nA: This is by no means a complete solution, but it may help in conjunction with other measures: There is an I/O scheduler much like a process scheduler, and it can be tweaked.\nMost notably, you can actually choose amongst different schedulers:\n~# cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler \nnoop anticipatory deadline [cfq] \n~# echo \"deadline\" > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler\n~# cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler \nnoop anticipatory [deadline] cfq \n~# \n\ndeadline may help you get more strongly reproducible results.\nnoop, as its name implies, is insanely dumb, and will enable you to wreck absolute havoc on I/O performance with little effort.\nanticipatory and cfq both try to be smart about it, though cfq is generally the smarter of the two. (As I recall, anticipatory is actually the legacy scheduler from right before the kernel started supporting multiple schedulers.)\n\nA: You can use a Virtual Machine and throttle disk access ... here are some tips about how do it in Virtualbox 5.8.

A while ago, I used to use the grsecurity kernel patches, which had an option to hide process arguments from other non-root users.  Basically this just made /proc/*/cmdline be mode 0600, and ps handles that properly by showing that the process exists but not its arguments.\nThis is kind of nice if someone on a multiuser machine is running say vi christmas-presents.txt, to use the canonical example.\nIs there any supported way to do this in Ubuntu, other than by installing a new kernel?\n(I'm familiar with the technique that lets individual programs alter their argv, but most programs don't do that and anyhow it is racy.  This stackoverflow user seems to be asking the same question, but actually just seems very confused.)\n\nA: The only way to do this currently is to put each user in a separate container (see clone with CLONE_NEWPID and CLONE_NEWNS), and mounting a new /proc in the container. (lxc will do some of this for you.)\nHowever, there are plans to be porting grsecurity features to the Ubuntu and upstream kernels. If you can, please sign up for something and help out.\n\nA: Up to and including Natty it is not possible to change the permissions on the /proc/$pid/cmdline files with the stock kernel, the permissions bits are built into the kernel.  Currently you would have to build a bespoke kernel with those patches applied.\nIf the patches are simple to enable this functionality then it may be worth posting them to the Ubuntu Kernel Team list (kernel-team@lists.ubuntu.com) and we can consider them for inclusion in future releases.\n\nA: There is now a hidepid mount option for procfs that lets you hide arguments from other users, and optionally allow one group to see all processes:\n\nThe first mount option is called \"hidepid\" and its value defines how\n  much info about processes we want to be available for non-owners:\nhidepid=0 (default) means the old behavior - anybody may read all\n  world-readable /proc/PID/* files.\nhidepid=1 means users may not access any /proc/PID/ directories, but\n  their own.  Sensitive files like cmdline, sched*, status are now\n  protected against other users.  As permission checking done in\n  proc_pid_permission() and files' permissions are left untouched,\n  programs expecting specific files' modes are not confused.\nhidepid=2 means hidepid=1 plus all /proc/PID/ will be invisible to\n  other users.  It doesn't mean that it hides whether a process exists\n  (it can be learned by other means, e.g.  by kill -0 $PID), but it\n  hides process' euid and egid.  It compicates intruder's task of\n  gathering info about running processes, whether some daemon runs with\n  elevated privileges, whether another user runs some sensitive program,\n  whether other users run any program at all, etc.\ngid=XXX defines a group that will be able to gather all processes'\n  info (as in hidepid=0 mode).  This group should be used instead of\n  putting nonroot user in sudoers file or something.  However, untrusted\n  users (like daemons, etc.) which are not supposed to monitor the tasks\n  in the whole system should not be added to the group.\nhidepid=1 or higher is designed to restrict access to procfs files,\n  which might reveal some sensitive private information like precise\n  keystrokes timings:\nhttp://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/05/3\nhidepid=1/2 doesn't break monitoring userspace tools.  ps, top, pgrep,\n  and conky gracefully handle EPERM/ENOENT and behave as if the current\n  user is the only user running processes.  pstree shows the process\n  subtree which contains \"pstree\" process.\n\n\nA: Years ago I published the following two kernel patches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simple process hiding kernel patch\n\n*Process hiding Kernel patch for 2.6.24.x (http://www.iezzi.ch/archives/120)\n\n\nThose two patches still work for the current stable vanilla kernel from kernel.org. If you're interested I can post the current patch.\nDon't ask me why never anybody included a process hiding option in the upstream kernel.\nWarning: These patches completely hide processes of other users except for root.\n\nA: You could stop them from accessing system monitor and top, by changing their permissions in the users and groups settings. I'm not certain this will be a complete solution but it should be sufficient to block this from most common users.\n", "Q: Git on Launchpad I develop most of my code in Git repos, now that I've become slightly more active on Launchpad I've started picking up Bazaar which has two \"small\" difference from Git's workflow that ride against how I usually develop code. While I don't mind using Bazaar I've noticed that Launchpad has options to use multiple VSC tools\n\nI'm curious exactly how this works with Launchpad with an emphasis on the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the repo mirrored as a Git repo or a Bazaar repository?\n\n*If it's a Bazaar repo - how are multiple branches in a Git repository mirrored on Launchpad?\n\n*How are updates from users pushing to the LP branch handled\n\n\n*\n\n*Are the branches from Git considered Read-only or will LP attempt to push them to the Git server?\n\n\n*\n\n*If so under what methods? (Git+SSH, Git Daemon, etc)\n\n\n\n*How often is the LP mirror updated?\n\n\nA: Note that recently git support was added to launchpad:\nhttp://blog.launchpad.net/general/git-code-hosting-beta\n\nA: The repository is stored as a bazaar repository on Launchpad.\nMultiple git branches are not currently imported - this is being looked at & can be followed at https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad-code/+bug/380871\nWriting to the branches on launchpad is not supported, according to http://blog.launchpad.net/code/git-branch-imports-now-in-public-beta\nFrom what I've seen of import history for projects, the branch mirror is updated every 4-6 hours.\n", "Q: Is it likely Ubuntu 11.04 will ship with the ~200 line \"miracle\" kernel patch? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do we get this magic performance-boosting 200 line patch? \n\nThe Phoronix article \"The ~200 Line Linux Kernel Patch That Does Wonders\" has created a lot of noise. It seems reports are flooding in that this patch noticeably increases responsiveness during aggressive cpu usage.\nHow likely is it that this patch will make it into the next version of Ubuntu? And will it be backported?\n\nA: The likelihood of it being included in Ubuntu is mostly dependent on if the Linux Kernel (as upstream) includes the patch in the stable release 2.6.38 which will go into Natty Narwhal.\nIt's possible the Ubuntu kernel team will patch the Ubuntu kernel in time for the release if they feel it's really warranted. But that's up to them. You can track what the kernel team does here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam\nThey often have meetings and discuss these sorts of things, the meeting minutes often contain the decision to patch certain things.\nThere is probably no chance that it'll be back ported, even if it's 200 lines, it's modifying key areas of kernel functionality which change all the time (making the patch hard to apply). If it were to go wrong, it'd be hard to fix. I'd say it would be almost impossible to accept a backport.\n\nA: The answer is simple.If the patch makes it to kernel 2.6.38, then Natty will have it as well.\n", "Q: Command line MP3 and OGG tagger with picture support (cover fetcher) I am searching a command-line tagging tool that supports ogg- and mp3-tagging and allows to add a picture to the tags.\nCurrently I use lltag but that does not support pictures. dagger is the tool I use before but it is lacking picture support as well. \n\nA: eyed3 (Install eyed3)\nThis works for mp3 files.\nExample usage, where image_name.jpg is the filename of the image you want for the cover art of the  mp3 file test.mp3:\neyeD3 --add-image=image_name.jpg:FRONT_COVER test.mp3\n\nvorbis-tools (Install vorbis-tools)\nVorbis-tools provides the command vorbiscomment which can embed images in ogg files if they are encoded correctly.

If I understand Wayland correctly, this isn't something that's built into the kernel. If so, then that means that, even when Wayland becomes the default display manager, we can do a commandline install and install X.org instead of Wayland.\nIn that case, will X.org always be available in the repositories in case someone needs the core features of X.org?\n\nA: First of all, before we jump the gun here, X.org is not going anywhere just yet.\nFor situations where wayland is not supported, X will remain the fallback. Plus, X will still be maintained and available.\nThat covered, wayland will provide many of the features X does, can run a nested X server, etc.\nSorry for not including links, I might do that if I update my answer later.\n\nA: It's hard to predict what things will be like 10 years out, so \"always\" is a pretty strong word.  :-)\nHowever, I can safely make the following forecast:\na) Ubuntu won't be switching away from X.org in the short term.  Certainly not for natty, and likely not natty+1 either.  The exact schedule is doing to depend a lot on how quickly a lot of development work on compiz, unity, gtk and other bits can get done.\nb) Even when we do switch, we'll be keeping X.org available for legacy applications.  I don't know how long we'll keep it, but likely for several years at least.\nc) Some drivers (like -fglrx and -nvidia) won't work with Wayland.  There's also unusual graphics hardware, virtualization environments, and so on that won't meet Wayland's requirements for some time.  So it's likely some \"retro mode\" that runs X just like today will be available, for users who prefer not to use Wayland.\nd) Upstream X.org developers are supportive of moving the ecosystem to something Wayland-based.  I would predict that eventually upstream will simply stop developing/supporting X.org, and that will be what brings X.org to an end.  When will that happen?  10 years out?  Maybe, I don't know.\nIn any case, don't panic.  X.org isn't going away any time soon.  Wayland is still in diapers.\n\nA: My understanding is that several \"xclients\" are still not available for wayland. And then there is is this announcement by nvidia that they have no plans of supporting Wayland. i have to agree with @Roland here that the migration is not going to happen in the near future.\n", "Q: Booting to gnome by default I'm currently playing with virtualbox and just installed ubuntu-minimal.\nI then proceeded to install gnome-core. After reinstalling, I rebooted but I'm taken back to the CLI. How do I load gnome when in command line? And how do I make it run gnome by default after booting?\n\nA: If you want GNOME to start automatically, try installing gdm. GDM is the default X display manager (which provides the login screen, and launches GNOME on login), and it should automatically start on boot.\n\nA: install gdm. you can later set gdm to auto login to the user account with gnome (it will handle starting X for you as well)\n\nA: In order to run gnome you must also install all the xorg/xserver stack as well as a lot of gnome pieces to get a functional desktop.\nNormally you would just install ubuntu-desktop, which would install everything for you. But something in your question suggests what you want to do is install each package and see how it fits together to make a small install base. Run this:\napt-cache show ubuntu-desktop | grep Recommends:\nAnd look through the results to find packages which you may need to install to get a gnome desktop working. Once you've got gdm and xorg installed it should just be a matter of:\nsudo /etc/init.d/gdm start\nAnd you can also make gdm start by default by adding it to the rc.d if it's not loading by default when you install it.\n", "Q: How do we get NVidia to make nvidia-settings a less terrible piece of software? Ever since I've been asking this question, the predominant answer has been something to the effect of \"well one day we'll have free drivers so we can just ignore the problem\"\nBut, in the meantime, NVidia-settings has been so awful it's been scaring users away from Ubuntu for the past 4 years.  If you have multiple monitors, or want to change resolution, NVidia-settings gives a horrible experience.  On multiple occasions I've seen it, singlehandedly, convince a user that Linux was \"not ready\".\nMost of the stuff in there doesn't even make sense -- for instance there's a completely useless \"write to xorg.conf\" button that is incredibly scary.\nSo what can we do?\n\nA: Check out Disper and Disper-applet. Disper is a CLI front-end to the nVidia driver (so you can change the monitor configuration from the command line), and Disper-applet is a very simple gnome-panel-applet that allows you to change the monitor configuration on the fly.\nThere is a .deb for installing disper, but not for disper-applet I'm afraid -- if you need help, post a question on the Launchpad-page.\nLink: https://launchpad.net/disper\nAll the best\nN\n\nA: Well the Catalyst control centre is not a terrific piece of software either. So ATI/AMD is as much to blame. The problem lies with the perception that linux users are not heavy gamers, so do not need advanced tools for tweaking their graphics experience. We can start by writing a front-end to nvidia-settings to tweak hidden settings. I am not exactly sure whether that is possible,but like many users i favour the \"Do it yourself approach\".\n\nA: The answer to this question is the answer to bug #1.\nThe moment the community is large enough to show these companies that linux is a platform worth giving some attention to, is the moment they will suddenly give us high quality software. Everyone who has ever done development on both windows and linux knows that Linux is in all honesty more straight forward to develop on in modern systems (many will claim otherwise for various reasons, but we know if we weighed the differences linux would win).\nIf we can make linux appear also to be a market, as opposed to just a free for all anything goes community, you will see an influx of high quality software even faster. That would happen because first game/3D application/math application developers who target ATI/nVidia would be indirectly putting pressure on them to provide a good experience for linux customers (as well as regular users equally), and with the bottom line falling from under them, the big two would scramble to make a better experience.\nI hope my little rambling/rant makes sense =), but in my opinion this is the solution we seek after.\n\nA: The nvidia-settings tool is open-source (GPLv2 + BSD), so it's entirely possible for anyone to make it better.  I'm not sure how easily patches would be accepted by nVidia, but at worst you could fork  it.\nThe other option is to write a different front-end, disper from this answer takes that approach.\nBoth of these options are constrained by the interface exposed by the binary blob, so there'll be a limit to how much you can implement.  The blob's interface is reasonably good, though, so you could make a lot of progress without needing any explicit support from nVidia.\n\nA: Nothing should save to etc config files without root privileges. Use any sudo method and run nvidia-settings the \"save to x config\" still works even in 11.04.\nWe use large CRT's in a number of systems so nvidia-settings is crucial. We use many meta-modes in all our systems. Low-res for games, high-res for graphics, medium for web and development. We use multiple monitors with multiple inputs, sometimes using the secondary monitor for systems from the rack on a KVM. Meta-modes makes it easy to switch between all the setups, single, dual, triple, low-res, high-res, etc.. When using the KVM we prefer to match the lower refresh rates of the onboard video. When using both (or three) monitors on the main system we prefer the highest refresh rate. Setting up the 8 or so meta-modes used on a new system takes less than a minute then press \"save to X\" and the system is configured. Then switching between the setups is keystroke for the KVM and metamode select. No sudo needed after initial setup, only to save to the config file.\n", "Q: On screen Keyboard with uTouch I want to buy a Mecer LUCID Slate tablet and install unity on the tablet. Thus no keyboard.\n\n\n*\n\n*Clicking on a text entry field will this bring up a on screen keyboard?\n\n*Does uTouch support a on screen keyboard out of the box or do you have to install a package to have this capability?\n\nA: Currently Unity does not come with an onscreen keyboard of that sort. You can use onboard  (open it from dash) to type using the mouse/touchpad, though it won't be a wonderfully smooth experience. Unfortunately there is no \"Ubuntu Tablet Edition\", so until (if) that happens, you will have to resort to \"hacks\" or \"workarounds\" to get such functionality.\nOnboard screenshot:\n\n\nA: In my opinion florence virtual keyboard seems like the best onscreen keyboard currently available for linux.\nDownload it from sourceforge.net and compile or install with a deb  (older version )\n\nA: I disagree with the above answer, I think onboard isgood with the right keyboard layouts. If you install ubuntu netbook, you can pin onboard to the side-menu, and then tap on it whenever you need to type.\nTrust me, im typing this from my acer tablet.\nI think ubuntu is already quite touch-friendly... just search around to make sure somebody else has already got the touchscreen working on your device.\n", "Q: How to print more than 600dpi with CUPS My printer (Canon Pixma IP5200R) is capable of printing up to 9.600 x 2.400 dpi. However in 10.04 CUPS with Gutenberg installed lets me choose not more than 600 dpi in the settings. Is there a way using only open source to improve print quality? I already tried editing the *.ppd files to include higher dpi values. This indeed let me choose these values when printing but there was no visible effect on the resolution of prints.\n\nA: The only way to improve quality of the print is to do the research of reverse engineering the specific driver related instructions and updating the pixma foomatic driver. Currently we don't have any Canon documentation to work from to get printers working.\nI have a Canon iP5000 and have a limit of 600dpi too. Unfortunately it's a lot of work to reverse engineer hardware protocols and we're not likely to get much support from Canon or Canonical in patching the holes.\n", "Q: Auto-mount USB after reboot what should I do if I want that my USB key is auto-mounted after reboot?\nI mounted it on /media/corsair, but after reboot it is gone...\n\nA: You'll need to create an entry in the fstab configuration file. The fstab configuration file contains instructions to automatically mount filesystems at startup. You can include network shares, usb sticks and internal hdd in this file.\nLook here for a full howto:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab\nIt's worth noting that your usb stick will probably be a fat32 formatted device if you haven't formatted it yourself to a different file system.\n", "Q: Typing location path instead of clicking directory buttons in the file picker dialog?

I watch a lot of foreign language films and it really annoys me to not be able to use my PS3 for them without hard coded subs. Is there a piece of software that will let me add the subtitles into the video file (without re-encoding) in a way that will allow the PS3 to recognise them?\nRight now I don't have the time to set up a server for media streaming and am ideally looking for something that alters the video file so that it can just be put on a USB drive attached to the PS3.

I just noticed that HTML files with CSS transforms on elements show with the CSS transforms within the thumbnails on Nautilus. So what rendering engine does Nautilus use to generate the thumbnails for HTML files?\n\nA: The thumbnailing programs are installed separately except for text/plain and are specified in gconf here:\n\nThis system allows you install different programs to do the rendering of different kinds of images. My system doesn't have any html preview/thumnails and gconf reflects that.

There was a folder on my desktop, and I dragged and dropped it onto the trash icon on the bottom right of the screen to see if the folder would be deleted.\nIt got deleted. \nBut when I opened up the trash folder by clicking on that icon, the folder I had deleted was not there. I then clicked on the properties of the trash folder and it said that there are 113 items in the trash while at the bottom of the window it says there is 0 items in the trash.\nI tried viewing hidden folders but nothing showed up. I also tried to open it as root but nothing showed up again.\nSo does anyone know how I can view the 113 items in the trash?\n\n\nA: Sounds like you have some items in an old gnome trash folder instead of the newer xdg trash folder. Do you need to recover the files and could you specify what you're looking for?\nEven if you find out what's wrong, this still should be reported as a bug:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs\n\nA: I'm guessing you probably have some unreadable files in ~/.local/share/Trash. You could determine this by running chmod +r ~/.local/share/Trash/* in a terminal. If that does not work, you can open the folder directly and see if you can see anything in it.\nIf it all fails, then as Martin said, report a bug.\n\nA: There have been some changes in the trash directory location as gnome/glib have evolved. Try the following:\nrm -rf ~/.Trash/*\nrmdir ~/.Trash\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*\nchmod 700 ~/.local/share/Trash/\n\nThen put something in the trash.

Is the disk-space freed when I close player? I've noticed that I can actually Shift-Delete (ie. doesn't go to Trash) a video which is currently playing, and it still keeps on playing, even though there is no named reference to it in nautilus or ls (terminal).  \nIs the disk-space freed normally when the player has finished with the video?  \nI assume it is normal behaviour, but it is certainly a new experience for me (as this was simply not possible in Windows).\n\nA: Although you've deleted it, the file is still in use because you have it open in your player. Once you close the media player, it will release its handle on the file data and will therefore be deleted.\nYou can verify this with the lsof command, which lists open files. If you run lsof, your movie file should be listed as being open by the player, but it will have \"DEL\" next to it which means it has been deleted even though it is still open.\nThis is actually all a useful thing and would mean you could actually recover open files that you've deleted, although that would probably be best left to another question :)\nIt comes about because (as I understand) files consist of the data itself, and handles (location in the filesystem) to the file. Normally you only have a single handle for a file, but you can create others using the ln command to create a hard link. This creates what appears to be an identical copy of your file but is actually just adding another handle - so you haven't used twice the disk space. You can check this by looking at the inode of the two files - this tells you where the data actually is. \nSo e.g. in a terminal window:\nln existing_movie.avi movie_hardlink.avi\nls -i\nThe -i argument to ls shows the inode information for files - they should be identical.\nWhen you delete one of those files, the data will remain because the other one still retains a handle to the inode. Once you delete the second file, the inode has no remaining handles/references and so is deleted/marked as unused space. This is directly analogous to the case when your player has the movie open, except that the second handle here is within the running program rather than a second file in the filesystem.\n\nA: read http://linuxgazette.net/105/pitcher.html, you will understand why (and learn the difference between hard and soft links)\n", "Q: Section of the screen gets distorted and pixelated after a few hours I have a Dell 1464 and installed Ubuntu on an External drive.

Is it lacking a package?\n\nA: If you don't have sound when playing a video, here's some general advice:\n\n\n*\n\n*Assume the simplest cause and work from there.\n\n*Does it depend on that video? Can you play a simple sound file (like one from this page) If the WAV file plays fine, it might be related to a missing audio codec, or to your media player application.\n\n*Is the volume up - both PCM and Master volume, if that applies to your case - and the sound not muted? You can check that by right-clicking on the volume meter in your systray.\n\n*Is your stereo properly connected and set up, no headphones plugged in?\n\n*Does sound work on another operating system?\n\n\nIf these do not point to a cause of the problem, it might very well be a driver problem. In that case you should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out if your sound card was detected at all;\n\n*Use a more full-featured mixer program, such as alsamixer, and see if changing the settings has any effect;\n\n*Find out your audio chipset. This can be done by running lspci in the terminal and watching out for what loooks like a sound card;\n\n*Google that sound card, or the driver used for it. In some cases, adding a module option can bring the sound card to life.\n\n\nIf it is indeed a driver issue, it might help to check if the card works under Ubuntu 10.10 - you can verify this easily by using live media such as a CD or a USB stick.\n\nA: Do you have the alsa-* package installed ?\nTry with:\ndpkg -l |grep alsa\n\nA: if you cant upgrade to 10.10, try these: \nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras package\n\nsudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\nsudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-pitfdll gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse libdvdnav4 libdvdread4 libxine1-ffmpeg\n\n\nA: If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.

See the diagrams at the bottom of http://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html for example.\nThey only mention this in terms of being able to share input devices with X for backwards compatibility, but I presume it means that it will be possible to communicate with the X server over a remote connection even though it is running on Wayland.\n\nA: I do not know of any graphical application that I cannot launch over an ssh session.  I, and probably everyone I know professionally use this everyday.  Not just at work, but at home too.  Compiz and other cool effects are a luxury.  Network transparency for every single graphical application I might install is a requirement.  RDP or VNC are unacceptable substitutes.\nAll I can see on this topic is comments like \"don't worry about it because...[insert words that make me worry here].\nWhat I want is for someone developing Wayland to publicly say \"don't worry about it because \"network transparency is a top priority for us.\"  They know we want to hear that but they won't come out and say it without hedging.\n\nA: According to http://mmol-6453.livejournal.com/253081.html network transparency is on the list of things to do, it's just on the bottom of that list.\nIf what is said there is true, we will eventually be able to connect graphically to another machine and run applications, but not immediately, and probably BEFORE X is dropped.\nI hope this is true, because like others here, I consider this to be a prime advantage to an X based system than others, such as Windows.\n\nA: The correct answer is: \"Network transparency is outside of the scope of the Wayland protocol\".\nA full explanation is provided in this FAQ but a brief summary might be: \"the aim of the Wayland is to define a small protocol, trying hard to stay away from the biggest error of X: doing and mandating too much (X even had a print server in it!!!). With this concept in mind there's no outstanding reason to add network transparency in the Wayland protocol. That can be done in a standalone API and its server / client. Nothing in the Wayland protocol is against network transparency.\"\nOne thing worth mentioning is that current X implementations are not network transparent anymore, as Daniel Stone explains in this video (which you should really see if you're interested in the argument and if you want to have some good --nerdy-- laugh).\n\nA: Wayland's ability to run X nested means that it will be possible to support most situations of network transparency and similar features. Also I read that this functionality may be replaced with a better method (if I can find the link again I will provide it).\n\nA: No Wayland is less ambitious that Xorg and won't have network transparency.\nQuoting from Mark Shuttleworth blog:\n\nSome of the core goals of X make it harder to achieve these user experiences on X than on native GL, we’re choosing to prioritize the quality of experience over those original values, like network transparency.\n\nref: http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/551\nAs a personal opinion I don't think that network transparency of graphic \"server\" is a feature needed for a desktop computer, it's is a feature that best match the tiny_client / big_workstation architecture.\n\nA: While network transparency is outside the scope of wayland, there is nothing preventing compositors to implement network transparancy, or even a project, like waypipe to build remote rendering server on top of Wayland for compositors to use\n", "Q: Is there a way to invert the display of window border decorations? All I can describe is that the result will be that the entire title bar will always be placed at the bottom of the window.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: With the window decorators available, this is not possible. There was some work under way to develop a new compiz decorator that would be able to do this, but as far as I can tell from the git tree of that project development seems to have stopped. Maybe some kind of box based window manager can do it, but I've never known any to work this way.\n\nA: Having looked at Compiz, KDE, GTK, Ubuntu Tweak, Emerald and maybe others, I also cannot see that it is possible.

I know in Windows it's a .EXE, what about Ubuntu? Specifically I removed the startup application hook for Docky and for whatever reason Docky won't add it back in, so I want to add it back in manually. However I'm not sure what file I am looking for here... So that brought me to this question, in general what file type am I looking for that is 'executable' in Ubuntu for this purpose?\nI'm assuming there could be many files, or it might not be files at all.. I'm still shedding off my Windows-esque thinking mode, please help :)\n\nA: Seeing as you are coming from windows, I will try to give you a better understanding of how applications work on linux.\nExecutables do not normally have a file extension; the are normally found in /usr/bin (as opposed to C:\\Program Files\\Vendor\\Program\\Executable.exe), and simply have the application's name (for example, docky = /usr/bin/docky). Desktop files allow for applications to be run with an icon, optional arguments, etc.\nTo add an application to your start up files, you can open the startup applications manager, click add, and type the application's name (usually this is the name of the executable).\nFor example, to start emesene (a chat client) you would add emesene to your startup applications.\nAs a rule: any file can be marked as an executable, even if it is not a program. For this reason, you should be sure to get a better understanding of how executables in linux work, before trying to do any administrative tasks.\n\nA: You can just drag and drop the Docky item from Applications -> Accessories into the\nStartup Applications window and it will be added to the list of programs that start on login.\nThe file type is .desktop. Go to ~/.config/autostart and you'll now see a docky.desktop and several other .desktop files.\nEvery program that has a .desktop file will have it in /usr/share/applications so if you wanted to you could also just manually copy /usr/share/applications/docky.desktop into ~/.config/autostart.\nThe format of .desktop files is basically the same as INI files.\n\nA: An executable file is one that has a 'x' permission. You can use a simple ls -l to view file permissions. You can make a file executable by using chmod +x <filename> and then execute it using sh <filename>.\nFor a detailed explanation on file permissions\nhttp://www.comptechdoc.org/os/linux/usersguide/linux_ugfilesp.html\n", "Q: Does booting on an external hard drive have limitations? I'm planning to make a complete install of Ubuntu on an external hard drive in order to use Ubuntu without touching my internal hard drive. Does it have limitations? Will it perform slower than a \"real\" install or something?\n\nA: It'll be slower than a proper SATA connection most times. The notable exceptions are USB3 over SATA1 and SATA2, external eSATA[2] over internal SATA1. \nBy slower, we're talking a maximum throughput of about 40MB/s on USB2 vs over 100MB/s on a good 7200rpm drive connected via SATA2 (that's the 3gbps version). Advanced features like queuing might also not be supported. And finally, seek time will be somewhat slower too.\nYou also need a BIOS that supports booting to USB. Thankfully most modern BIOSes won't have an issue doing this.\nOne note for installation: You'll need to unmount the drive when you boot to the LiveCD because by default Ubuntu will try and mount it and that will interfere with the partitioning. You might have to keep unmounting drives as they appear (once partitioned) so the installer can continue unimpeded.\n\nIf you can plug it in internally, or use a eSATA port, do that.\n\nA: It will work, you can even do it with a Live USB but for a full install, an internal SATA drive would be faster than USB drive.\nDepending on the computer you're using, it might actually be easy to swap the hard drives for when you want use Ubuntu. Sometimes USB drives have just a couple of screws which would let you take a standard SATA drive out that you could plug straight into the computer.\n", "Q: Automatically change Terminal colors on remote connection? Is there a way to automatically apply a terminal profile when connected to a remote machine via SSH?\nI'd like more obvious visual cues that I'm connected to a remote machine than the user/host displayed on each terminal line. I spend most of my day connected to multiple machines and it can get confusing.\n\nA: You could change the remote system shell profile to use colorfull prompts, check the following link for details: http://www.funtoo.org/en/articles/linux/tips/prompt/ .\n\nA: The following works for gnome3 terminals.   It uses xdotool to automate interaction with the gnome terminal menu, since the available keyboard shortcuts are currently limited.\nI have created two profiles.  The top one in the Terminal->Profiles menu is my default, and indicates a local machine.  The second one is my color scheme for a remote connection to machine66.\nI then defined the following aliases in my bashrc:\nalias first_profile=\"xdotool key F10 Right Right Right Right Down Right Return\"\nalias second_profile=\"xdotool key F10 Right Right Right Right Down Right Down Return\"\nalias go66=\"second_profile; ssh remotemachine66; first_profile\"\n\nThe first_profile and second_profile just use xdotools to click f10 (open the menu), and then traverse right to terminal, down 1 to profiles selection,  and then select the first or second profile.\ngo66 first calls second_profile to set the colors, ssh's into the remote machine.  On exiting ssh first_profile is called, returning the profile to the local profile.\nIt's clunky, but it works.  I'm happy to hear refinement suggestions.\n\nA: Srigelsford from the Ubuntu forums recommends this:\n\nI created several profiles in\n  gnome-terminal with the settings I\n  wanted, then created aliases like the\n  below example to ssh to ares. The Ares\n  profile has a red background.\nalias -p ares='gnome-terminal --window-with-profile=Ares -x bash -c \"ssh ares\"; exit'\n\nThe pitfall of this is that it cannot\n  be done in your existing terminal\n  window, it launches another. My alias\n  closes the existing one after\n  launching the new one, but you can\n  stop that by removing the ; exit from\n  the end.\nJust create as many profiles as you\n  like, and associate each server to a\n  profile in an alias. To launch just\n  type the name of the alias $ares\n\n\nA: i had that on my todolist for quite some time and just tried and searched againg\nthis is also a reminder to myself: Have to try with screen / byobu\nFor now i use gnome-terminal profiles . The config files are xml in HOME/.gconf/apps ... and so i might create / copy them via script lateron for some 20 to 50 hosts, with automatically created colors etc. As i write i see and have to admit it is not very sophisticated idea though.\nFor now i need a easier to type short cut then ALT+D R 0  to open new tab with profile #0 (german shortcut)\n", "Q: Why does /cdrom folder exist?

(/cdrom)\nI recall it used to be /media/cdrom or /mnt/cdrom before (in different distros perhaps)?\nthanks.\n\nA: If you do a detailed listing of the root directory, you will see that /cdrom is just a link to /media/cdrom - a shortcut for convenience.\n$ ls -l /\ntotal 120\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 2010-11-11 01:23 bin\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root root  4096 2010-10-21 18:51 boot\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root root    11 2009-11-19 09:25 cdrom -> media/cdrom\n...\n\n\nA: While /mnt/ and /media/ are common places to mount devices, the device location can be just about anywhere.  /cdrom/ was probably chosen for either brevity or legacy support.\n\nA: \n\nAndre\n\n\nFor me, it doesn't become a link until something is in /media/cdrom, and that's weird.\nI'm sure there's a reason why this is done, most likely for \"brevity or legacy support\" but the linking/unlinking part is quite strange. In past versions of Ubuntu these folders were constantly linked (last I checked was Intrepid maybe)....\nI'm presently trying to hunt down the script that does this black magic in order to discover it's dark secrets.\n", "Q: How to change the fallback font for missing languages?

System freezes completely.\nHow can I locate the problem?\n\nA: Sometimes it's just the X server that is frozen. Try to get a console by hitting CTRL-ALT-F1. If that won't do, try logging it your machine using SSH (install openssh-server package first). If you can't get a shell, reboot.\nOnce you have a shell, check the system logs (/var/log/syslog, /var/log/messages, /var/log/Xorg.0.log and ~/.xsession-errors). Scroll up to the time the crash happened. If you didn't have to reboot, the dmesg command will show you the kernel log buffer in case it can't write to your filesystem.\nWhether or not you are able to find anything in the log file, what makes it easier to debug is being able to reproduce the problem at will. If you can't, and the logs show nothing unusual, then you can try to isolate the source of the problem by booting a rescue CD (or a completely different OS), removing non-essential pieces of hardware, or replacing some parts with others that are known to be functionnal. Doing this can be tedious, and requires rigour.\nOnce you have minimal information, file a bug report for the suspected faulty software, unless you think your hardware is faulty.\n", "Q: How can I schedule a nightly reboot?

The \"zz\" prefix will force it to run last out of all the other scripts in that directory. Check /etc/crontab to see what time of day that will actually happen:\ngrep daily /etc/crontab | awk '{print $2 \":\" $1}'\n\nIf that won't work, then a \"regular\" cron entry can work too, via sudo crontab -e\nMINUTE HOUR * * * shutdown -r now\n\nAnd finally, if you want to just do one-off reboots, you can use at:\necho \"shutdown -r now\" | sudo at 04:30\n\n\nA: I'd use cron (should already be installed):\n\nEdit crontab:\nsudo crontab -e\n\nThe first time you might have to choose your preferred editor (like nano)\n\nInsert a line like\n0 4   *   *   *    /sbin/shutdown -r +5\n\nat the bottom.

If there are no errors, then your actual crontab will be updated.\n\nA: You should create a script using the directions given by Kees Cook...\nYou can just copy and paste the information below in any text editor and create the zz-reboot file in the directory suggested.\nAfter that just remember to right click on the file and assign it execution permission.\nIf you feel like doing in using terminal just:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/zz-reboot\n\nTo understand better what you're doing remember that in /etc folder you generally find configuration files and there you can find cron.hourly, cron.daily and other cron folders.\nCron takes care of executing applications and script at a certain time.\nIf you want to be strict about the reboot time just digit\nsudo crontab -e\n\nso you can edit the crontab for the root user.\nIf you feel better doing it graphically you can install from the Software Center gnome-schedule.\nIf you want to modify the gnome-schedule for root user ensure that you run it from terminal:\ngksudo gnome-schedule\n\nHave fun playing around! :)\np.s.:\ngreat point sBlatt!

It's very easy both on Windows and Linux.\n\nA: Here's a straightforward guide: http://rootmanager.com/ubuntu-ipsec-l2tp-windows-domain-auth/setting-up-openswan-xl2tpd-with-native-windows-clients.html but it doesn't cover tunneling it over http/https  \nanother solution is here: http://www.exiledmind.net/vpn-tunnel/ this maps EXACTLY to what you are trying to do.  \nI prefer openswan since openvpn is client number limited now  \nif the auth is succeeding but the tunnel isn't formed this usually means the two end-points can't agree on tunnel mode and/or crypto system.  another possibility is a routing problem where the near and far networks are on the same private subnet and your traffic gets dropped because it doesn't know to transit the vpn link.\n", "Q: Why can't I configure my touchpad?

So make sure you have both.\nIf you don't have them, then install the package with:\nsudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer\n\nIf you have flashplugin-installer package and the file mentioned above, but it still doesn't work, then you could try to copy the plugin shared object to ~/.opera/plugins with the following command:\ncp /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so ~/.opera/plugins/libflashplayer.so\n\nAlso check if you don't have any old version being detected by Opera and disable it.

Ubuntu 10.04 is a LTS version and it is strange that it takes so long to implement this feature. Many potential canonical customers would prefer to use this version, but buying ubuntuone without being able to sync contacts is annoying.\n\nA: While I wasn't able to find a timeline for when there is an explanation of why it isn't available on the 9.10 and 10.04 release.\n\nSyncing of contacts and bookmarks is\n  working for Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick)\n  users.

There are many options and plugins available for configuring Gedit to meet your needs.\n\nA: dreamweaver is not an editor but a good solution for the web in Linux is Aptana. It is not WYSIWYG. To install it, only downlad unzip it (if necessary) and run it. Aptana will create a folder \"workspace\" (I´m not soure about the name) to your home folder and thats all.\n\nA: For web development you can use an editor called Bluefish.  \nhttp://bluefish.openoffice.nl/\n\nBluefish is targeted towards\n  programmers and webdesigners, with\n  many options to write websites,\n  scripts and programming code.

Does anyone know why?\n\nA: it is because of the latest XDG Base Directory Specification: http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html\n\nA: According to the freedesktop.org Trash Specification:\n\nFor every user a “home trash” directory MUST be available. Its name and location are $XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash ; $XDG_DATA_HOME is the base directory for user-specific data, as defined in the Desktop Base Directory Specification.\n\nIf the environment variable $XDG_DATA_HOME is either not set or empty, ~/.local/share is used. So by default, the trash folder is ~/.local/share/Trash.\nRegardless, the easiest and best way to trash a file from the command line is to use the trash\n command.\nUse it like you would use rm:\ntrash somefile.txt\n\nThis is better than just mv'ing a file into ~/.local/share/Trash because it stores metadata such as where the file was originally so you can restore (un-delete) it if need be.\n\nA: You can find it here.   ~/.local/share/Trash/\n", "Q: External Monitor Resolution doesn't go above 1024x768 I am trying to use a 24\" external monitor as the primary monitor for my Asus EEE netbook.

The standard audio-format for music in Rhythmbox is Ogg. For some reason none of my music encoded as OggVorbis shows up in the Ubuntu One Mobile Music application on my Android phone. The MP3s do show up. It looks like the Ubuntu One servers are not indexing Ogg-files, although it is THE open format for music with superior quality to MP3 and Ubuntu's Rhythmbox encoded my CDs to that format. Solution? \n\nA: Ubuntu One Mobile only currently supports the streaming of MP3 files, but may support open codecs like OGG and FLAC in the future.\nSource: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOne/FAQ/WhatAudioFormatsAreSupported\n\nA: We've just released ogg support on devices that support it (Android, Ubuntu).\nThere are 2 things that held back ogg support in our first release:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone does not support ogg (we would need to build per-os music libraries, which added a lot of complexity and time)\n\n*Battery life for ogg was pretty bad, as it wasn't using hardware to decode the stream. we need to do more research in this area\n\n\nWe also surveyed mimetypes of our existing users, and only a very small percentage of people had ogg files  (I do understand the chicken-and-egg situation).\n", "Q: modprobe ath9k at startup?

Preferably something that works from the Server, but I'm willing to take detours, as it is a one-time job.\n\nA: The easiest way to do migrations between IMAP servers is to copy your mail using an IMAP client.  You can do that using a normal mail client, but I suggest you use a more specialized tool like imapsync or imapcopy (install using apt-get or from Software Center).\n\nA: If you're using imap on your server at the moment it may be possible to use http://migrationtool.sourceforge.net/ to do the migration through imap.\nI haven't used it myself so can't vouch for whether it's any good. The imap route seems the most obvious way to go though.\n\nA: I have made recently migration from zimbra server (on ubuntu) to google apps.\nWe did it in two ways depending account.\nOne and easies way were to make google apps to download posts using pop from original server (and leave messages there tho...)\n  Couple hints, make new address or use other one from google apps (example for mail test.domain make new a record to original mail server like old.test.domain) and for original mail server make new alias for that accaount for old.test.domain.\n2nd way (to get all those folders etc...) was to use email client (thunderbird or evolution) to drag them.

Is there any way i can aggregate the bandwidth of these cards to enjoy the combined speed? What i mean is simultaneously plugging in all the cards and getting the sum total of the bandwidth.\n\nA: You could do this. Network Manager can do one connection per device just fine. But even with network-manager connected to multiple things, outbound traffic will only chose one gateway. You need to bridge these gateways into a virtual tunnel and use that as the gateway.\nThe problem is all the machinery is there (iptables, ipchains, iproute2, etc) is somewhat lower-level than network manager. You can try and follow a guide showing example configuration to split traffic over multiple gateways but network-manager might end up getting in the way.\nIt might not. It might work out just fine. You won't know until you've poked it ;)\n\nA: No, you can't aggregate multiple data cards out-of-the-box. \nYou need to buy a device that does link aggregation(802.3ad protocol).\n\nA: In my opinion you cant.Because you can not make your network manager connect to multiple lines at the same time.. \n\nA: You need to \"bridge\" multiple connections into one.

When you are connected to more than one network and each has it's own \"gateway\" your system by default uses only one of them (usually the last one you connected to).\nPowernet configures the routing table to \"round-robin\" over the available gateways so for example, each connection will go over different gateway/link.\nSingle connection will only be as fast as the gateway it uses but multiple connections will be as fast total speed of all the gateways combined.\nSide effect: You can enter website from one IP and after sometime your IP will change (as you now use different gateway) and it may drive some sites crazy.\nThis is not \"bonding\" and this technique does not require special ISP support. It can work if you just have more than one Internet connection available.\n", "Q: UbuntuOne contact syncing for Thunderbird with new phone plans?

Quoting the description over there:\n\nHedera is an extension for Thunderbird\n  (currently Thunderbird 3 only, but\n  Thunderbird 2 will be supported when\n  the extension is stable) that\n  synchronises contacts with\n  DesktopCouch, thus allowing Evolution\n  users to seamlessly switch to\n  Thunderbird and retain their contacts,\n  and Thunderbird users to benefit from\n  the synchronisation with Ubuntu One\n  and other computers they have paired\n  with.\nIt's still in the early phases of\n  development - to quote Phil\n  Newborough, \"It may go crunch-bang!\"\n  so back up your contacts prior to use,\n  or use a dedicated Thunderbird\n  profile.\n\nAs an aside, note that funambol-dependent contact sync (such as what currently gets your contacts onto your phones, and what can be used for Thunderbird 2 and Outlook integration) has always been exclusive to paid plans; there was a beta of the service during which we waived the costs, and I understand we didn't communicate effectively enough that this was a free beta of a paid service.\n", "Q: Where does Ubuntu store the SSL certificates for Pidgin?

I have the Bindwood extension for Firefox bookmark syncing through UbuntuOne installed on two of my computers and none of the bookmarks have synced between them. The UbuntuOne wiki has instructions for what to do in this situation: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOne/FAQ/WhyArentBookmarksSyncing\nI'm worried that those instructions might break my existing UbuntuOne configuration. (It was hard enough to get regular file syncing working properly, so I'd rather not risk breaking anything.) But deleting the password entries for CouchDB and removing ~/.config/desktop-couch/desktop-couchdb.ini has me worried.\n\nA: Those instruction are harmless, they just renew your DesktopCouch encryption keys.\nHowever Firefox bookmark sync ( and those instructions ) are for Maverick only.\nI see this answer is tagged as 10.04, and on Lucid bookmark sync is not enable yet.\nUbuntu Lucid users need to wait for the support to be backported.\nQuoted from the wiki:\n\nSyncing of contacts and bookmarks is working for Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick) users. Maverick users will need to have the latest updates installed. Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic) and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid) users will have to wait a bit longer for backporting of the CouchDB and Erlang packages. We presented the case for backporting CouchDB to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS to the Ubuntu Technical Board and the suggestion was to investigate creating a separate, special package that will allow Ubuntu One databases (contacts, bookmarks, etc.) to synchronize once again. We're currently looking into this.\n\nHere: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOne/Status#Bookmarks\n\nA: FWIW CouchDB and file syncing on the desktop are only related in that they all come under the Ubuntu One banner of awesomness. I don't think there is anything technically connecting these two things.\n\nA: Firefox 4 will come with a Sync feature built-in, which is capable of syncing not only bookmarks, but also preferences, passwords, history and tabs. If you want to use this feature with older versions of Firefox, you can install Firefox Sync extension:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10868/\nBTW, there are some reports about bindwood causing Firefox excessive CPU usage, freezing and startup delays.

I want to know how ubuntu users can customize various Gnome desktop features to suite or to make best use of a netbook screen. For example I have deleted the bottom panel, and brought the top panel below, and have made it auto-hide. Also I have made the text size smaller everywhere.\n\nI have also customised Firefox like so:\n\nI have got rid of status bar,  menu bar so on. I feel that the title bar on many applications is not so much useful. So can it be removed, as it is done in google chrome. In opera and chrome the tab bar is very thick, so I am looking for a way to reduce the size. Please post solutions to make optimal use of the netbook screen.\n\nA: There are several optimisations you can make to preserve screen space on small screens. Having only 1 GNOME panel is definitely an improvement.\nGlobal Menu Bar\nYou can customise your GNOME panel to contain the menu bar for all application windows (except those that don't work with it - the main ones are Firefox and Open Office). Obviously this makes much more sense if the GNOME panel is at the top. \n\nTo enable this, install the package: indicator-applet-appmenu. Once installed, right click the panel and click 'Add to Panel...' and choose the 'Indicator Applet Appmenu'. One caveat with this is that applications with huge menu bars (such as GIMP) may not fit on the panel at low resolutions. \n\nMaximus\nMaximus is software that automatically maximises windows and removes their title bar when maximised. It was designed specifically for netbooks and used to be part of the Ubuntu Netbook Remix. \n\nTo test it, you can press Alt+F2 then enter maximus. To use it permanently, you will probably prefer to add it to the startup applications (System->Preferences->Startup Applications). \nIf you ever want to un-maximise a window, you can't use the normal window buttons but you can still use Alt+click+drag down. The window border will then be re-added to the window.\nYou can get a similar effect by configuring compiz so that window decorations disappear when you maximise a window. This is good if you don't want windows to maximise automatically but want to save space once they are maximised.\n\nDocky\nDocky is a launcher and dock. \n\nIts main advantage in terms of saving screen space is its Intellihide/Window Dodge feature. I find this much better than the autohide of the GNOME panel because it seems that it shows at the right times more. Docky also reduces space by using icons instead of names for windows and grouping windows by application. These are the settings I use:\n\nThese settings can be accessed by clicking the Docky anchor icon, then clicking on the dock to configure. Docky requires compositing to run. If your netbook can't run compiz, enable compositing in Metacity.\nWindow Selector\nWindow selector is a panel applet that shows all your windows in a menu. This can save a lot of space if it is used instead of a window list at the expense of requiring an extra click.\n\n\nAs far as I know, this applet is installed by default. You can enable it in the usual manner. \n\nI personally use the all of these to make best use of my smallish (13.3\") screen. I have 1 panel, which I keep at the top.\n\nA: If I've understood correctly what you ask you could get a docky bar (installing gnome-do) and try to use it as your only bar tweaking it badly for your needs :)\nOr...\nIt could be maybe even better, if you feel like experimenting something different from Gnome to use Fluxbox!\nNormally it's quite hard (but challenging and satisfying too) to configure and customize but a great customization \"ready to use\" of this windows system (always in the ubuntu flavour) has been made by the guys at Linux Mint.\nDownload Linux Mint Fluxbox and try its super light and minimal look.\nNo menu no fuss no nothing: everything under your right click.\nI really love it on my netbook :)\n\nA: Personally, I've found that Gnome Shell is far superior to a panel combination involving Docky.  I run a somewhat older Acer Aspire One, and have found that Docky slows things down somewhat.\nGnome Shell is fast, easy to learn, and provides excellent space management for Netbooks. I've gone through KDE 4 netbook edition, all kinds of Gnome 2 adjustments (Docky, cairo-dock, UNR 10.04, Unity), and even tried Xfce for extra speed.  So far Gnome Shell leads the pack, in my estimation.\nHere's a link for further info:\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/11/install-vanilla-gnome-3-in-maverick/\n", "Q: How to backup a system with whole disk-encryption? What's the way to backup a system encrypted with whole disk-encryption? I mean, The total system is encrypted, not only the home folder.\n\nA: If you have whole-disk encryption, then just boot the system in the usual way, including unlocking the disk.  Then make a backup using say duplicity, using gpg so that it's encrypted on the destination machine.\nThere is not much point trying to backup the raw encrypted partition.\n\nA: If, when you say encrypted system, you mean that you chose to encrypt your home directory when you set up your system, don't worry, you can backup those files/folders normally.\nWhat happens with the encryption placed on your home directory is that every file and folder in it is copied to a encrypted directory that mirrors your home directory ie you would have\n/home/<user>/stuff\n/home/.encfs/<user>/stuff, but encrypted\n\nwhere the second directory is the encrypted one. When you log in, the the security system attempt to decrypt the encrypted directory using your username and password, thus giving you access to the stuff. It's not encrypted while you're logged in, so you can back the stuff up normally.\nYou can read up on how the encrypted home directory works at this Ubuntu Wiki page. Specifically, you should check out the How it works section mid way down the page, and excerpt of which I've posted below:\n\nEncfs creates an encrypted file/folder\n  inside /home/.encfs/testuser for every\n  file/folder you create inside\n  /home/testuser. When the encrypted\n  folder is \"mounted\" the files are\n  decrypted on the fly and accessible at\n  the mountpoint (/home/testuser).\nWith pam_encfs configured as it is,\n  everytime a user tries to log in, it\n  will attempt to execute \"encfs\n  /home/.enc/$USERNAME /home/$USERNAME\"\n  using your account password. For users\n  you haven't setup encryption for, this\n  will simply fail and everything is the\n  same as normal. For users you setup,\n  the empty /home/$USERNAME folder will\n  suddenly provide access to their\n  decrypted files and folders! Yay!\n\n", "Q: Application to manage software updates on multiple desktops? I have a small home network of 5 Ubuntu Maverick desktops and 1 laptop.

Pressing [Fn-Space] will toggle between keyboard back-light settings on this laptop.  Maybe the manual for your keyboard will provide insight into the key combination that might work for its back-light?\n\nA: for those who land here because they also want the keyboard to light up BEFORE the login screen:\nFinally Found an answer, at least for Ubuntu 14.04\nas for how to get the keyboard to light up before the login screen:\nedit :\n/usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-unity-greeter.conf\n\nsudo gedit /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-unity-greeter.conf\n\nadd the line:\ngreeter-setup-script= xset led 3 \n\n\nA: For my Mi laptop keyboard, above solutions did not work.\nI just had to use that F10 key with the appropriate symbol. \nThe symbol looks like a bold \"dash\", with little thin dashes going in every direction and representing light.  \n\nA: Did you try the script the YouTube poster suggested in his own comments?  \nBasically use xset to toggle the state of the led backlight.\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ -f /tmp/keyboard_light ]; then\n  xset -led 3 && rm /tmp/keyboard_light\nelse\n  xset led 3 && touch /tmp/keyboard_light\nfi\n\n\nA: Found the answer after a long night up with lots of half baked solutions.\n# backup your symbols file\nsudo cp /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us{,.distribution} \n\nAdd the following line in the xkb_symbols \"basic\" { section. do not worry if that second line is not there, it is only there for some languages and was not there for us on my system.\n...\n    modifier_map Mod3   { Scroll_Lock }; <==<< Add this line\n\n    include \"level3(ralt_switch)\" <==<< before this line\n};\n\nYou may have to do the same in your other layouts if you switch between languages \nAlso, there is a cache where xkb layouts live.

When the backlight was on, the metakey was non-functional. I could turn it on and off with scroll lock and use meta when it was off, but i3 needs that too much and it is too hard to see my keyboard without the light, so this was not an ideal way to do it. The above solution, xset led on is a much better solution. By leaving the keymap alone, I can use meta anytime I need it and always see the keyboard.\n\nA: I just bought an EagleTec mechanical keyboard with blue backlight, and like J. Chomel, found that I just needed to use a key combination to turn the backlight on or off, enable/disable \"breathing\" mode, or adjust the brightness.\nIn my case, I'm using it on LinuxMint 17, but it should work on other distributions also.\nHere are the backlight functions that the keyboard supports:\n\"FN\" + \"SCRLK\" = Backlight On/Off\n\"FN\" + \"HOME\" = \"Breathing\" On/Off\n\"FN\" + \"-\" = Lower Brightness\n\"FN\" + \"=\" = Increase Brightness\nThe keyboard also supports other functions not related to the backlight, although I haven't tried most of them, as I have yet to determine what most of the functions are.\nThe ones that I do know to work are:\n\"FN\" + \"F2\" = Lower Volume\n\"FN\" + \"F3\" = Increase Volume\n\"FN\" + \"F9\" = Open Email Application (Thunderbird, in my case)\n\nA: If your using an Hp Omen if you press Fn and the lighting key you can toggle keyboard backlight on and off using ubuntu studio \n\nA: For the people with LK Gaming keyboards, use fn+F12.\n", "Q: How to recover unbootable system?

The best that I could figure out is that if I pressed F1 while the system was stuck in the Ubuntu splash screen, I could get into the terminal. At least there I could recover all of my data. I ended up doing what Martin Owens suggested and put 10.04 LTS after transferring all of my data by flash drive!

I just read about Crossover Office, and am curious as to whether it makes sense to pay for it. Apparently it's run on Wine, so aside from the support options, what features does it have that I can't already get by running a program with wine? (Or in other words: is it worth paying for?)\n\nA: Original answer:\nThe main thing you get for paying for this software is support. Commercial software has better support because of course, you paid, so they have to give you something worth paying for, so to speak. Just a note though, it is not run on wine, but rather based on WINE, and developed from the same code, with some additions and gui features to make it easier for inexperienced/casual users to install software on WINE with it.\nYou could of course do quite fine without it (I do), or you may require it for the greater support it offers (this depends on your skill level etc).\nOne more thing, paying for such a product as CrossOver Office will support the development of WINE, so it is one of those things where even though you don't have to do it, you do it cause it's for a good purpose =).\nUpdated answer:\nIs it worth paying for? Yes, and no. If I'm very honest here, it is worth it if you want to help the development of WINE, and it is worth it if you need the support. Yet, (see below) there are alternatives, as always.\nIn response to your comment:\nYou can try various tools for running applications that don't run well out of the box with WINE, for free.\nThe best in my personal opinion (and most maintained) is PlayOnLinux.\n\nPlayOnLinux main window.\n\nPlayOnLinux install window.\nYou will find a pretty simple gui for installing many different applications on wine (mostly games, unfortunately). If you can't find an application in that list, then you can check the playonlinux forum, and see if there is a script download for it. If you need further, direct assistance, there are several places you can go, including winehq, where you will find a good support forum, ubuntuforums.org, or even here, AskUbuntu.\n", "Q: Apache solr and eclipse taking up huge amounts of memory I have this pc with kubuntu and it gets really slow when I run programs like eclipse or talend.

The package I have installed certainly doesn't have bold versions. What you are seeing are probably \"fake bold\", made by darkening the usual versions algorithmically.

Unfortunately, when the last child cgroup of \"user\" was removed (by the release_agent), that folder would also be removed, leading to the error messages reported. A simple workaround is to enable notify_on_release for each cgroup individually at creation, keeping the parents setting disabled.\nHope that was easy to follow!\nEdit: I'd have posted this as a comment to the actual answer, though it's seems I don't have enough reputation to do so (yet).\n\nA: I applied this patch using the automated script on Web UPD8 to an Asus eee 1000H.

That's the core of the criticism made by that RedHat guy, whose name I won't bother mentioning.\n\nA: Given that it's far more likely that your server is out performing most standard desktops  these days slowing down the system won't at all help responsiveness. Likely - if at all - you are experiencing performance issue it's main bottleneck is Disk IO. Since this patches doesn't improve read/write from disks you wouldn't gain any change in performance. Definitely not worth the trouble of patching X amount of kernels on your servers.\n\nA: There is nothing magic about this patch, it just makes your system a bit slower but also more responsive for interactive use.\nSo I doubt it's very useful for your servers (except in some emergency circumstances maybe).\n\nA: The \"wonder patch\" will provide better results in a desktop scenario, where you want something like 'make -j64' running in background without interfering with the other (\"interactive\") tasks. In your case, I assume you would want the scheduler to treat all your server processes equally... I'll have to agree with Marco and say that it is definitely not worth the trouble right now.\n", "Q: How to view Windows PC connected to LAN? In my LAN, there are 4 PCS. My PC is Ubuntu, others are Windows XP SP2. To share files between us, I installed Samba. In the network places, i can see others PC as well as mine. But when i click on it, it shows a popup \"Unable to retrieve the share list from server\". I dont know how to access them. I couldn't see even my PC in the network folders. It say the same above message.\nPreviously i successfully shared files with the same Ubuntu, same samba, same config. \nPlease tell me to trace the solution. From where i have to check.\n\nA: Sounds like you are shutting the machines down regularly, and, without a domain controller, you are unable to establish what is known as a master browser.  What I would suggest is setting up one machine as your master browser, which is easiest in Samba (see here) and leaving it on all the time.  I have a Linux based NAS device I have designated as my master browser and I never have an issue with share lists.\n\nA: If you're after a specific folder on the XP machines, make sure that you have \"shared\" it. Right click on the folder and select \"Sharing and Security\". Select \"Share this folder\" and it should show up when you click on the machine in network places.\n\nA: Open the file browser and at the location bar type this: smb://ip-of-samba-server/shared_dir. Make relevant changes to the command and it should work.\n", "Q: Get Compiz working on x1300 ati I have Ubuntu 10.10 installed on a thinkpad T60 with an ati mobile x1300.  Ubuntu isn't loading any proprietary drivers and compiz doesn't work.  A google search turned up nothing.  Sure, some people reported \"bad performance\", but I'm not getting any \"performance\" with compiz and these post were all for previous editions.  I'm new to messing with ati drivers.  Is there a way to make sure xorg-video-ati is loaded?  Do I have to add any voodoo lines somewhere in /etc/X11/? Did anyone else have this problem?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: I'm using an ATI X1400 and I found that as long as I don't install any ATI specific binary drivers (fglrx), then I'm good to go. Also, you'll notice the \"ATI binary X.Org driver\" description says it's for \"newer ATI graphics cards\" and apparently that doesn't include us. :)\nThe good news is, all you have to do is go to the Appearance Preferences control panel and choose Normal, Extra, or Custom under the Visual Effects tab and Ubuntu will load up an appropriate open source x.org driver that will work very nicely.\nA handy page to bookmark is Ubuntu Community Documentation for the Radeon Driver\n", "Q: System locking up with suspicious messages about hard disk My system has started behaving strangely, intermittently locking up.

You could boot from the install disc and have access to any program that you might require to investigate the problem. If I ever suspect a hard drive problem, my first priority is to boot from a Live CD or USB drive and make a backup of all the critical data on the hard drive. Then I use the tools on the live system to diagnose the problem.\n\nA: This appears to be a hard disk failure. Swapping the cable didn't fix it. The \"Reallocated Sector Count\" in smartctl is way above the threshold and it's a pre-failure indicator. Luckily I have backups and I can still read from the disk to copy over old data.\n\nA: I recently had this error.  Turned out to be the SATA cables connecting the HDDs to the motherboard.  Brought two new ones and its been working perfectly for the last week.\nAlso in \"System\" -> \"Administration\" -> \"Disk Utility\" check out the SMART data for the drive.  It might tell you why its failing.  My cable problem reported no\n", "Q: How to make Quanta plus editor as a default editor? When I click on any file eg php file it open by default in gedit I want that it will open by default in quanta plus \n\nA: Right click on the file -> select 'Properties' -> go to the 'Open With' tab -> select the text editor of your choice from the list.\nI believe that will make the text editor you choose the default for that particular file type. You'll have to repeat those steps for every file type though (e.g. plain text file, .log, .txt, etc.)\nJust saw, but this question was already answered in a general form here: How do I change the default text editor?\n\nA: The easiest way I found to change mine to gvim (I think it should work the same for your editor) was to add text/plain=quanta.desktop to ~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list and restart nautilus.\n", "Q: Why does the mouse cursor disappear while typing in tomboy? In my laptop (under Ubuntu 10.10 upgraded from 10.04) the mouse cursor will disappear while and after I'm typing something in tomboy. This will also happen in google-chrome location bar. I think it could be some old config file errors. But I do not want to clean all my config files. So I'm wondering does anyone know what config file should be cleaned? Thanks~\n\nA: Well, I don't know for Tomboy but for Google-Chrome and Chromium this is the default behavior so rather of searching what config file should be cleaned you should search what option you need to change to make it work the way you want to.\n\nA: If I remember correctly, this is just how those applications work. So long as you are not seeing it in other applications, it is application specific, and probably not something you can change if the applications do not have settings that allow you to change that particular behaviour.\n", "Q: PPA hosting packages not built on launchpad build farm Is it possible to build the deb packages in house and then upload the binaries to launchpad PPA, instead of uploading the source package and let it build by the build farm ?\n\nA: No it's not possible, as Launchpad only accepts source package uploads for reasons of trust - people need to be able to have the source to what was built, and you cannot put proprietary software into PPAs.\n", "Q: VLC is set to open the folders (Home, desktop, documents etc) in the Places menu.

Reason I want to do this is I have to login to the network before I can start using it and I would like to automate this if possible. \nI read this question: Is there a way to run a script every time I connect to a specifc wireless network?\nBut I'm really unsure as to how to use upstart to do it.\n\nA: I don't know if there is a way to do it with Network Manager, there is one probably but I have another solution for you. You can install Wicd :\nsudo apt-get install wicd\n\nWicd have support directly on the gtk interface to add pre-script and post-script support to every network you can connect. Take care that Wicd will desinstall Network-Manager to work (they are both in conflict) so if something goes wrong you should download the .deb of Network-Manager or have a Live-CD/Live-USB with you.\nWicd is easy to use and quicker to connect but lack some advanced features of Network-Manager (like VPN). Here is a screenshot :\n\n\nA: Apologies for my previous answer which was the way I would have done it years ago. Seems things have changed.\nIt turns out that Network Manager runs ALL of the scripts in the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ directory (those owned by root, that are executable, that are not readable by other users, and not setuid), when a connection changes (up, down, preup, predown).\nEnvironment variables are set and passed to this script by Network manager. You'll be interested in the CONNECTION_UUID environment variable (contains a unique string). \nSo, to solve your problem (execute a script when a particular wireless network is connected to):\n1) find out the uuid of the wireless connection you're interested in (by looking inside the appropriate connection file in the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ directory).\n2) write a bash (or perl, or python, or whatever) script that does what you want if the environment variable CONNECTION_UUID is a match to the uuid of the wireless network in (1) above.\n3) put this script into /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ and set the owner and permissions appropriately.\nfurther reading: man networkmanager ( and a litte poking around the scripts in the directories mentioned above).\nAn example script:\n#!/bin/bash\n#####################################\n# MounterBeast Script\n# /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/02remotemount\n# Copyright 2011 Nathan E.

Ubuntu stops new programs that are in charge of installing/removing/updating software from starting when there is an existing application/process that has the same function.  You probably just need to wait for an application you were previously using to close/relinquish software changing rights and/or close that process if you have not already done so.\n", "Q: Importing mail files of type message/rfc822 I've successfully import mail files to KMail, but since there was only one message in each file, it was inconvenient to read it since each message was stored in a separate folder.\n(I used the Import Evolution 2.x Local Mails and Folder Structure option to import those files)\nHow can I import the mail files without having KMail dedicating a separate folder for each message?\nCheck here for an example of a mail file.\n\nA: rfc822 is also known as .EML file format, you can see all info about importing into Thunderbird HERE. \nInteresting text from the link: \nIf you have problems importing .EML files using the ImportExportTools extension try using eml2mbx to convert the .EML files to a mbox file and then import the mbox file using the ImportExportTools extension. A Google search will find several eml to mbox conversion programs. Whats unusual about this one is that provides a lot of control over how it converts the .EML files using a \"eml2mbx.ini\" file. \nIn short you must convert EML to mbox format.\nThere is also info for KMail and links HERE.\nAlso you can use eml2mbox ruby script to convert your emails to mbox, which can be imported into Evolution. I was able to convert the sample you provided and import it. The script with all info needed can be found HERE. \nregards\n\nA: I think I've tried to do the same once some time ago, though I also wanted to import them to gmail.\nThe way I ended up doing it, was installing a mail server (Dovecot I think) on my computer, put the mbox files in a newly created mailbox, and the point the gmail pop service to my local mailserver.

Are there any software for Ubuntu which quiz masters can use to display questions for quiz events?\nIf there aren't any, what tools or frameworks provide an easir way to build one. Minimum requirements are: a window with eye-candy look, one or multiple text questions on each page, display of multiple images or a single picture and also ability to include videos or sound. There should be an interface to display scores. \n\nA: Try KWordQuiz.\nIt's not the best, or necessarily the most appropriate, but it gets the job done.\nI would also suggest using KompoZer or a similar program from creating a quiz in HTML, or possibly even OpenOffice.org(LibreOffice) impress/writer.

(As far as I can remember Firefox do that, and so Gedit ).\nAs you said Compiz has fine control on where to place which application window, but not the simple option of remembering its last status.\nPlease refer also to these idea in Brainstorm: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/25654/\n\n*http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/1442/\nand this bug ( marked as Wontfix ):\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/metacity/+bug/124315\n\nA: There is really no way to accomplish this in Compiz without creating a custom plugin, since it is the job of an application to keep track of this. It is possible to write a plugin that does this, probably by basing it on the Window Placement plugin. However, there is no existing solution for it.\n\nA: You can, but the window needs to have a unique class/name/title/id or some such that you can refer to.\nStart Compiz settings:\n% ccsm\n\nSelect the \"Place Windows\" plugin\nMake sure it is enabled\nSelect the \"Fixed Window Placement\" tab\nThen click on \"New\" under \"Windows with fixed positions\".\nNow you need to specify which windows have what fixed positions.  Click on the \"+\" sign to bring up a window selection dialog, this will allow you to specify the window by class/title/etc..  You can choose one of the types and grab the window to see what it's value is to see if it's something unique you can use for placement.  You can add multiple conditions and thereby end up with interesting combinations such as:\n(class=myterminal) & title=one\n\nThen specify your X and Y positions, save it and close the settings manager. The next time you place a window that fits the definition you've specified, it should place it in the appropriate location (you may need to 'compiz --replace' though I doubt it).\n", "Q: How to get Opera work correctly with Privoxy?

I am using Ubuntu 10.04 with KDE on it.\nI am facing a problem in connecting to a wired LAN internet connection.\nI want to connect to wired internet connection with static IP and authentication.\nHow can I manage this via terminal?\n\nA: How to configure the network interface using the terminal\nYou can configure a network interface from the command line using the networking utilities. You configure your network client hosts with the command line by using commands to change your current settings or by editing a number of system files. To configure your network interface card to automatically connect when wired cable is connected you can follow this \"simple\" steps:\n\n*\n\n*Configuring DHCP address for your network card\n\nTo configure DHCP address, edit the /etc/network/interfaces and enter the following lines replacing eth0 in the example with your network interface card:\n`sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces`\n\nYou should see something similar to this:\n\n    auto eth0  \n    iface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nin my computer it looks like this:\n\n    auto lo  \n    iface lo inet loopback\n\nSo if your network card appears as eth2 for example then you would leave the file like this:\n    auto eth2  \n    iface eth2 inet dhcp\n\n\n\n*Just in case you want to configure a static IP address for your network card\n\nSame procedure as above but you would need to include more information.\nLike above, replace eth0 with your networks card name:\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\nExample File:\n    auto eth0  \n    iface eth0 inet static  \n    address 192.168.0.100  \n    gateway 192.168.0.1  \n    netmask 255.255.255.0  \n    network 192.168.0.0  \n    broadcast 192.168.0.255  \n\nAfter entering all the details which are needed for your static IP you would need to restart networking services using the following command:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\n\n*Setting up DNS\n\nYou can add hostname and/or IP addresses to the file /etc/hosts for static lookups.\nTo cause your machine to consult with a particular server for name lookups you simply add their addresses to /etc/resolv.conf.\nFor example a machine which should perform lookups from the DNS server at IP address 192.168.0.1 would have a resolv.conf file looking like this:\nsudo nano /etc/resolv.conf\n    search test.com  \n    nameserver 192.168.0.1\n\nin my case it looks like this:\n    search cantv.net \n    nameserver 127.0.0.1\n\n\nA: most answers on this issue are most likely to confuse readers when demostrating what to put in the /etc/resolv.conf because they use local addresses for the nameserver.\n\"For example a machine which should perform lookups from the DNS server.\"\nHere DNS server and nameserver mean the same thing. So instead of placing a LAN address in there, put an actual DNS server address. (ie. Google DNS server)\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\nthis link explains the used of the resolv.conf file in more depth.\nhttps://theos.in/desktop-linux/resolve-conf-linux-example/\n\nA: In my case, what worked is:\necho \"nameserver 8.8.8.8\" >/run/resolvconf/resolv.conf\nping -c 5 www.google.com \n\nIf it does not work, run:\nip link set enpxxx down\nip link set enpxxx up\ndhclient enpxxx\n\nping should work now.\nping -c 5 www.google.com \n\nI found this solution on this page of the ubuntu (french) wiki\n\nA: With nmcli is dead easy\nnmcli connection show\n\nThen use the device name to connect\nnmcli connection up uuid <device UUID>\n\n", "Q: MSI VR601 laptop won't resume after suspend I know that you're probably sick with this issue, but I promise you all that I searched for a solution for this annoying issue, but couldn't find a thing.\nWhen I suspend my laptop, normally the power button keeps blinking, and then it should resume, in my case it won't, it seems as it's about to resume, then the laptop shuts down, then suddenly powers up, but with nothing.

I've extracted all the source contained inside to my home folder \"/home/zolomon/SourceCode\". But where should I place the SourceCode directory with its content when I wish to compile it? Does it matter? \nWill it, in most cases, install and place files in the correct place automatically when I install it? \nIn this case I'm talking about RubyGems.\n\nA: Yes you can place the source code anywhere.During the installation it places all the files in correct location.In your case you have your source code in /home/zolomon/SourceCode so you can compile it from there..Thats not a problem..\n\nA: Files under the directory /usr/local/ are not under the control of the Debian package management system. Therefore, it is good practice to place the source code for your program in /usr/local/src/. For example, you might extract the files for a package named \"foo.tar\" into the directory /usr/local/src/foo. After you compile them, place the binaries in /usr/local/bin/, the libraries in /usr/local/lib/, and the configuration files in /usr/local/etc/.\nIf your programs and/or files really must be placed in some other directory, you could still store them in /usr/local/, and build the appropriate symbolic links from the required location to its location in /usr/local/, e.g., you could make the link\n ln -s /usr/local/bin/foo /usr/bin/foo\n\nIn any case, if you obtain a package whose copyright allows redistribution, you should consider making a Debian package of it, and uploading it for the Debian system. Guidelines for becoming a package developer are included in the Debian Policy manual.\nTaken from: http://www.debian.org/doc/FAQ/ch-compat.en.html\n", "Q: I have a hardware detection problem, what logs do I need to look into? I am trying to ask a question about getting my hardware to work but I don't know what information to add to my question to get help, what do I need to do?\nRelated if you don't have access to a GUI:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I get information from the logs on my computer when I only have access to the command line?\n\nA: One of the most useful things you can do when describing a hardware issue, is describe what you did, what is connection you are using.\nFor example:\n\n\"I plugged in a monitor and my desktop did not automatically extend on to it.\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Tell us what port your monitor uses (for example, vga or hdmi).\n\n*Did you get any notifications when you plugged it in?\n\n*Did you ensure that the connection you used is the correct one?\n\n\nThis kind of information may seem very simple, but it can help to pin point where common problems come from, or if you question may be off topic.\n\nA: Note: If you have a wired connection consider running the all in one wireless script outlined in this answer, it does all the heavy lifting for you!\n\nWireless Cards\nWireless connectivity issues are fortunately becoming rarer with each Ubuntu release.  However problems still occur.\nThe following information will help diagnose wireless connectivity issues in questions posted on Ask Ubuntu, you can open a terminal by hitting Ctrl-Alt-T and typing in one of these commands, then edit your question to add the information. \nHow the kernel recognises your network cards\nsudo lshw -class network\n\nDetails of your USB wireless card\nlsusb\n\nThis can give a long list depending upon how many USB devices are connected.  If in doubt, post the entire list.\nDetails of your PCI wireless card\nlspci\n\nThis can give a long list depending upon how many PCI devices are fitted.  If in doubt, post the entire list.\nHow to see if a wireless card is soft-blocked or hard-blocked:\nrfkill list all\n\nErrors whilst connecting\nOften you can see useful errors by looking at your kernel logs.\nIf you attempt to connect via network manager you can see what errors are produced by looking at dmesg\nSuggested procedure - type dmesg, then attempt to connect and then type dmesg again.  The new output displayed should give an indication as to the error.\nAnother useful output is dmesg | grep -i firmware - if you see some errors in the output then this can indicate you need to install some firmware - usually a package from the repository.\nNDISWrapper\nSearching on Google will sometimes bring results suggesting using NDISWrapper.  This is an old technique where obtaining a Windows XP driver can be made to work in Ubuntu.\nGenerally, this should be avoided in current versions of Ubuntu since the drivers in the kernel have less compatibility issues.\nIf you have any wireless issues post the results of the four command-line entries above into your question BEFORE trying NDISWrapper.\n\nA: Execute these following commandline tool:\n\ncat /var/log/Xorg.0.log \n  lspci \n  dmesg \n  lsusb\n\n\nA: A general problem-solving hint \nI've noticed that I often collect data to diagnose a problem by:  \nFirst, identifying the problem - what did I do, what did I expect to happen, and what seemed to happen? Can I repeat the problem?\nThen, causing the problem to happen, and listing the system's logs in reverse order of modification time:\nls -lrt /var/log,\ntail -n 25 on recently modified log files (for reasonable values of 25), and\ndmesg.\nRead, wonder, think, guess, test, repeat as needed\n\nA: See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingHardwareDetection\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProcedures is usually a good starting point if you want to know what information is useful for a bug report.\n\nA: The most important information you can give is what you've done, what you expected to happen, and what you observe has happened.\nThis question is a particularly fine example of a hardware-detection problem with a USB device.\nOther examples of this could be:\n\nI installed Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop on my Dell Optiwhatever 312 laptop.  When\n  I log in, my wireless card isn't visible in the Network Manager popup menu, \n  although the wired network shows up there.\n\nor\n\nI have Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook edition on my System76 laptop.  When I plug my \n  headphones into the socket, the sound comes out the headphones but also\n  out the speakers.\n\nor\n\nI'm using Ubuntu 10.04.  I used the “Additional Drivers” program to install the\n  current nVidia drivers for my GeForce FX 5200.  Now when I boot the system stops\n  with a black screen after the Ubuntu boot splash is finished.\n\nAfter this general problem description, what other information is interesting depends on what sort of hardware you're having problems with, and what problems you're having.\nIn general:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo lspci -nn will list all the PCI devices in your system.  This will include all the expansion cards (Video cards, WiFi, etc) in your system, whether or not the kernel has a driver for them.  This information is useful if you're not sure precisely what hardware you have.\n\n*lsusb will list all the USB devices connected to your system.  Again, this is useful if you're not sure precisely what hardware you have.  It's also useful to check that the device is actually plugged in correctly!\n\n*/var/log/udev and /var/log/dmesg will have information about what devices the kernel has detected.

What is the best channel for making suggestions for changes to Ubuntu (or, more specifically, Ubiquity)? I have spotted an issue that is not really a bug, but its a fairly big usability hurdle.\nI was helping somebody to install Ubuntu on a virtual machine, and they kept getting stuck at the ‘Who are you?’ section. Eventually, I spotted that they had an uppercase letter in their username.\nThe problem is that the installer did not let them know that this was the issue, and it was very frustrating for the user.\n\nA: What you are describing does seem to be a bug because the software should let them know that uppercase letters are not allowed. Here is the bug tracker for Ubiquity: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubiquity - please report the bug there.\nAlso, to make general suggestions about Ubuntu, you can make them at Ubuntu Brainstorm (http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/) where the community will help vote up the best ideas for implementation.\n\nA: You are likely seeing this bug.\nTo better answer your question, most teams in Ubuntu have a mailing list where you can contact a team if you have recommendations. In your specific example the ubuntu-installer team is who you're looking for.\nAs you can see the issue has already been reported (and fixed in the next version!) so I recommend doing a search for your issue first to ensure you're not duplicating a bug or something someone else has already brought up.\nIf you have some kind of grand visionary dream of an idea that should be implemented then as donatello suggests, Ubuntu Brainstorm is the right place.

I'm buying a new computer and I think I will be going for a system based on a Phenom X6 CPU. I will be getting an nVidia GPU for support under Linux, and 8GB of memory.\nI expect to use 64-bit Ubuntu on this rig, but in the past it's proven tricky to find whether or not all the on-board goodies work on Linux.\nCan you suggest a motherboard that you know works fine? I'd like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Suspend definitely has to work - I've been stuck with non working suspend for way too long (on an Intel D865PERL).\n\n*I expect to use integrated sound, and would very much like support for front panel audio (in particular, I want rear-connected speakers to go mute when plugging in headphones in the front panel, we're in 2010 after all).\n\n*an eSATA port.\n\n*Ethernet would be nice. I could plug in a PCI Ethernet card, so this is not a must.\n\n*SATA 3 & USB 3 for future upgrades (\"support will be in kernel in 3 months\" is OK, I'm not planning to use either right away).\n\n\nI am considering this one: Gigabyte GA-870A-UD3 What do you think? Sound is ALC892, Ethernet is Realtek 8111D. \nAny other options? I can use mATX as well as ATX, but if I have to use a PCI Ethernet card then I would prefer ATX to keep some ports available.\nThanks!\n\nA: Nvidia with AMD is not a combination that i would recommend, especially since many superb AM3 motherboards have excellent ATI onboard graphics and also support ATI Hybrid Graphics when teamed with a ATI graphics Card. You Wont get that with a Nvidia Card. Plus with the latest catalyst releases amd has caught up a lot with nvidia as far as Linux Support is concerned ( Though definitely no VDPAU support). My personal suggestion is gigabyte GA-890GPA-UD3H + Radeon 6850. Even if you want to stick with nvidia go for the 890GX Chipset.\nPut simply, VDPAU uses the stream processor on your nvidia hardware for HD video decoding thus putting very less strain on your CPU. XVBA the competing solution from AMD has very limited support on linux. So if you are into HD videos you should go for nvidia. The open source Radeon driver works beautifully with slightly older ATI Cards (R500/R600/R700) with support for evergreen and barts on the horizon. Even the performance of fglrx is now at par with nvidia imho. I have a radeon hd 4670 which works beautifully on ubuntu 10.10. I am a huge AMD/ATI fan and i have 3 systems running athlon II/Phenom II and opteron respectively. If you have the budget go for phenom II x6 1090t+ hd 6850/70. Killer combo\n", "Q: What would be the most practical way for a web developer to develop on Ubuntu but test on IE I work as web developer and have Firefox and Chrome installed on my Ubuntu system.  However, most of the nightmares for web developers are getting things to work on Internet Explorer, mostly IE7 and IE8.  My entire team of developers have switched to Ubuntu and now we're facing a difficult time with testing on IE.  I'd like to be able to test from my own desktop, but not install virtualbox on each system, since that would defeat the purpose of moving to Ubuntu.  Is it possible to have windows run on a virtual box instance on one server and remotely connect to it from say 5 or 6 systems at the same time?  Or even run windows on one box and have my entire team remotely access that desktop?\n\nA: Just install Windows on a machine ( or virtual machine ) and install a VNC server ( like UltraVnc http://www.uvnc.com/download/index.html ).\nOn the windows machine you can create the amount of users that you need, then configure the UltraVnc server to permit LogIn with Window Authentication.\nThen with any VNC client (like Vinagre) from your Ubuntu desktops you can connect to the Windows machine ( using a different user for each developer ) and enjoy :)\n\n\nA: I do web development on Ubuntu. I think there are three main scenarios.\nIf you need to keep an eye on IE's rendering of your HTML and CSS, you can use a site such as Browsershots. Browsershots in particular is very exhaustive but quite slow, there are a few faster equivalents that will only do most major browsers. Also, you can use VNC for this purpose. VNC is not really suitable for interaction with websites, but just fine for static rendering checks.\nIf you need to test interaction with jQuery-style effects and more complex things, you really need a real local copy of IE, especially if you need to see how responsive an UI is. I use VirtualBox for this. Funny ways of installing IE on Linux don't really work because font rendering and options might be different from vanilla Windows installs. If you need to do this right, you need a real Windows machine (and different Windows versions, too). For example, a tricky bit I ran into lately is when using @font-face server provided fonts. These can vary widely from one platform to the next.\nAnd last but not least, you might need functionality testing (i.e. ¿Did this search box break in the last update?). You can do automated testing of functionality using specialized tools like Selenium or the newer Sikuli. With these you can have Windows tests running automatically on a dedicated machine, but you won't get feedback on small rendering glitches and such.\n\nA: You could install IE7 with PlayOnLinux, and everyone could have their own IE install.\n\nA: Being a web developer myself I see your problem, I have used one of three solutions at various times.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a virtual machine\n\n*Dual boot\n\n*Have a spare machine set up just for that reason, to test your work under the windows environment\n\n\nThere are a few other things you could try, such as remote desktop, which I believe if you use a server you can have multiple sessions at once. I just don't know how many. Or you could take a look at IEs4Linux. One of their goals is to make IE available on Linux for web developers. The biggest drawback to it is it doesn't support IE 7 and up.\n\nA: If you prefer testing within Ubuntu, then I advice you to use WINE to install IE.\nYou can read the guides here:\nhttp://www.wine-reviews.net/wine-reviews/applications/ie-7-on-linux-with-wine.html\nhttp://www.wine-reviews.net/wine-reviews/microsoft/internet-explorer-8-on-linux-with-wine.html\nIf you need older IE you can use IEs4linux - http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page\n\nA: Also consider linie, a new project aiming to make it easy to install MSIE on Linux, using wine. That's not the same as testing on an actual Windows box or VM, but it'll get halfway there.\n", "Q: Accessing Windows 7 shares - numerous issues I am unable to access the shared folder of a Windows 7 machine on the same network.\nI click on the network icon in places, then I can see the Windows Network option, but when I click on it, I get the message:\n\nFailed to retrieve share list from server\n\nI've tried to install Samba (sudo apt-get install samba) and I've also installed SBMFS. I've set the workgroup in /etc/samba/smb.conf to WORKGROUP - the same as the other Windows computers on the network. As far as I'm aware, I should now be able to get access to the shared folders on the Windows 7 computers, but no luck; I can't even get past the 'Windows Network' icon.\nWhen I check the list of processes in the system monitor, there's no sign of anything called Samba or SMB.

Make relevant changes to the above command and it should work if you've configured the shares properly.\n\nA: In 'Places' Menu choose 'connect to server'. In the server type choose \"windows share\". Type the Ip of the Windows Machine in the server field and the name of the shared folder in the shared field.Hit connect. see whether you can access the shared folder now.\n\nA: I recently debugged an issue with a share on a Windows 7 machine, where a user had changed their password on the 7 box, but not on the XP box they were attempting to access the share from.  What threw me was that the share was invisible to every thing, until the user told me about the password change, at which point the share became accessible and visible.\nI would recommend making sure the user credentials on the Linux machine match the user credentials on the 7 box.\nNext I would go on to check the share data on the 7 box to make sure the user account you are wanting to use is allowed to access the share.\n", "Q: manage a system of Ubuntu computers from a single computer I'm a student at a small high school in Denmark, im the only one using Ubuntu, but I'd like the other students to at least try it.\nSo I asked for permission to set up a small group of computers for the others to try, mostly for smaller school tasks, or random internet surfing.\nSo far they've let me set up 4 computers, and I would like to manage all the computers from a single computer which should also work as the \"picture\" for the other computers.\ni need software to manage this, as mentioned below is VNC as an opportunity, but what i get from reading about it is that this kind of soft ware is just sharing a screen (which is hopefully wrong)\nand what equipment would I like to use?\n\nA: You might want to consider trialling Landscape which has a systems management interface to manage multiple desktop Ubuntu installations. It's a pay-for service, but you can register for a free trial to see if it fits your requirements.\n\nA: Clonezilla is used for replicating or imaging installations to multiple machine, and not for synchronizing or managing. If you want to manage or control multiple machines from a single machine, then you can use remote desktop tools like VNC or, if you prefer command line, you can use ssh.

I'm after a virtual printer which takes each page of \"printed\" output and converts into multiple images (one image for each page)... eg. .jpg, or .png,  etc..  \nI'm specifically looking for something to work with Open-Office Writer, but I assume that such a virtual printer would work across the board for any app which can send its output to a \"printer\".  \nIs there such a thing in the Ubuntu repository?  \nPS.  I want one \"normal\" picture image per page.. ie Many images are output.\n...(like the Snagit virtual printer in Windows)\n\nA: Does it need to be an image file rather than a PDF? If not, you could use\nsudo apt-get install cups-pdf\n\nWith ImageMagick you can convert PDFs to images from the command line but maybe that's getting too longwinded. Also, though I don't have it installed on the machine I'm currently used, I read on blog comment that GIMP can open PDFs...?\n\nA: First print your document as pdf and then you can convert it to jpg or png using GIMP.\nPrinting your document as pdf:\nOpen your document in open office,and then click pdf option to export your document as pdf or goto file menu and choose export as pdf.\n\nConverting pdf to jpg|png:\nOpen your pdf in GIMP(Right click your pdf and then choose Open with GIMP\nImage Editor)\nNow again goto file menu and select the option save as,Now be sure you choose the correct format.Choose JPG or PNG to save that pdf file into image format..\n\nA: Well, i finally found a way to get it to produce individually numbered jpegs; one per page of printed output.  \n--(also, see the  UPDATE, below)--\nFirst, I added a \"Generic-PostScript-Printer\"..\nPanel -> Sysetm -> Administration -> Printing\nor\n$ system-config-printer \nThe next step is, in OpenOffice, to choose [*] Print to file (in the Print dialog)\nand save the PostScrip file to wherever you like, eg. ~/print-to-file.ps\nThe final step is to use ghostscript to do the conversion.  It has many output devices.\nYou can list the devices via: $ gs -h \nTo output sequentiall numbered jpeg images, this is the command:  \n$ gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE \\  \n -sOutputFile=/home/fred/print-to-file.ps.%d.jpeg \\  \n -sDEVICE=jpeg /home/fred.print-to-file.ps`   \n\nFor the png format, change the filename's sufix to .png.\nand use png16 / png256 / etc  for -sDEVICE  \n\nUPDATE:\nI've just now realized that ghostscript can also take a .pdf as input...\nSo I tried using the .pdf from OpenOffice's Export to PDF option, as the input to gs (ghostscript) ...\nThe .odt source file  was text-only and the resluting images  have marginally better kearning, so it may be worth comparing the \".pdf\" as imput, vs \".ps\"  for your specific situation.. font, images etc...\nIn summary (for this pdf method):  \n\n\n*\n\n*Export as PDF\n\n*$ gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=/home/fred/print-to-file.pdf.%d.jpeg -sDEVICE=jpeg /home/fred.print-to-file.pdf\n\nUPDATE 2:\nAlthough this method works, the quality of output images was not up to par.\nUpping the jpg quality to 100% still produced sub-standard results..\nEven tiff images were producing aberrations in the text (no anti-aliasing?).   \nMaybe there is a way to tweak ghostscript further, but I started looking elsewhere, and thanks to Roddie's suggestion, I've changed my tack and definitely prefer the \"non virtual-printer\" method of  unoconv + ImageMagick (mentioned in my comment to Roddie's answer)...  The image quality from ImageMagick is great! ..\nA \"two line\" script of these two commands would make a simple \"Nautilus Action\", and bypass the need to directly use OpenOffice.\nBut if you want to convert an unsaved document to images, then you would need you use \"cups-pdf\" or the menu \"File->Save as PDF\" option instead of \"unoconv\".\n\nA: Its not something ive ever needed to do on linux but cups-pdf looks like it might do the job for you. This is available in the software centre or via the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install cups-pdf\nyou can check if everything has worked by going to System > Administration > Printing, and you should have a printer there called pdf. As its installed as a printer on the system, it should work with any application that would normally print.\nBy default these are saved to a folder called PDF under your home folder. It is possible to change this by altering /etc/cups/cups-pdf.conf. Search for the OUT variable and change this to whatever you want.\nIm not sure there is anyway to alter the save location on a per-usage basis, perhaps someone with more knowledge would be able to elaborate.\nAs a side note, Open Office writer already has an option to export to pdf in the file menu.\n\nA: We have taken the sources of cups-pdf and modified them to create svg.\nThis way we have a virtual network printer that creates svg for all our MS windows users.\nAs explained above the advantage for Linux users is smaller as they can always output ps or pdf and use inkscape or so to create svg.\nHowever, even for Linux users it can be convenient to 'just print' and pick up the resulting svg in the user directory of the server.\nLimitation we have now is that only 1 page (1 svg file) can be output at a time.\nI am looking for somebody interested to package the code and place it on an ubuntu ppa. \nYou can mail me at ftoth AT telfort.nl\nFerry\n\nA: You should also be able to export the file to a PDF one, right from the File menu of open Office.\n", "Q: My card reader doesn't show up at all, but previously did in 10.10 I bought a pin-based-USB powered internal media card reader and it worked perfectly when I first installed Ubuntu 10.10 a month ago.

It explains how to set the default audio output device (speakers, etc), from the command line, as well as how to make your chosen setting the system default, so that it is set after the machine is rebooted.\n\nSet the default output sink\nTo list the output sinks available, type the following command:\n$ pacmd list-sinks | grep -e 'name:' -e 'index:'\n\n*\n\n*index: 0\nname: <alsa_output.pci-0000_04_01.0.analog-stereo>\nindex: 1\nname:  <combined>\nThe * in front of the index indicates the current default output.\nTo set a system wide default, add the source name in the default.pa file:\n/etc/pulse/default.pa\n...\nset-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_04_01.0.analog-stereo\n...\nWhen done then you can logout/login or restart PulseAudio manually for these changes to take effect.\n\nfrom Set the default output sink\n\nA: pavucontrol\n\nNot the actual Ubuntu volume control, but better! It lets you control default devices, and even devices per application/stream.\nYou have to have the app actually be recording/playing for it to appear in the 'Playback' or 'Recording' tabs, but once you choose the device for that app, it seems to remember it forever.\nAlso, (on a side note), for old (non pulse) applications, run them after padsp, eg:\npadsp some_old_app\n\n\n\nA: You can control PulseAudio thoroughly through the command line using pacmd and pactl commands. For options see pacmd --help or the wiki at PulseAudio:\npacmd list-sinks for name or index number of possible sinks\npacmd list-sources for name or index number of possible sources\npacmd set-default-sink \"SINKNAME\" | index to set the default output sink\npacmd set-default-source \"SOURCENAME\" | index to set the default input\npacmd set-sink-volume index volume\npacmd set-source-volume index volume for volume control (65536 = 100 %, 0 = mute; or a bit more intuitive 0x10000 = 100 %, 0x7500 = 75 %, 0x0 = 0 %)\nand many many more CLI options.\n\nNote: Changing the output sink through the command line interface can only take effect if stream target device reading is disabled. This can be done by editing the corresponding line in /etc/pulse/default.pa to:\nload-module module-stream-restore restore_device=false\n\nRestart PulseAudio for changes to take effect:\npulseaudio -k\n\nFor a more elaborate tutorial on how to do this, and for instructions on how to change the sink during playback see this answer.\n\nA: Yes there is type alsamixer in terminal\n\nPress ,\n\nF1 - Help\nF2 - System Information\nF6 - Select Sound Card\nEsc - Exit the menu\n\n", "Q: Can I install a firewall interface without `menu`? I need an interface for ufw (uncomplicated firewall) that does not depend on \"menu\", which is outdated and messing with software updates/installations. I don't mind building from source but prefer a deb.\n\nA: I found a deb on planet ubuntu that doesn't require menu :D! Solved. It is for a newer version of gufw.\nFortunately gufw  no longer requires menu.\n\nA: Firestarter, fireshark, fwbuilder, shorewall are some of the firewall builders available. firestarter is gtk based, and might be the lightest of these. They are available through Synaptic Package Manager if not in Software Center. There is also the option of building iptables using ufw without the gui. Information about firestarter is available at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Firestarter . For a bit of information on firewalls and the GUI's to build them, see https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/firewall.html . \n\nA: Try Comodo firewall.

What is the maximum length of command line arguments in gnome-terminal?  \n... and is there a system environment variable which reports this value?\n\nA: xargs knows. On my system,\n$ xargs --show-limits\nYour environment variables take up 2572 bytes\nPOSIX upper limit on argument length (this system): 2092532\nPOSIX smallest allowable upper limit on argument length (all systems): 4096\nMaximum length of command we could actually use: 2089960\nSize of command buffer we are actually using: 131072\n\n\nA: The answer comes from the sysconf value ARG_MAX. To examine it on your system:\ngetconf ARG_MAX\n\nFor me, this reports 2097152. For more details check the manpage:\nman sysconf\n\nTo get this inside a program, for example:\n#include <unistd.h>\n...\nprintf(\"%ld\\n\", sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX));\n\n\nA: I don't really know about gnome-terminal, but the shell has not a 'fixed' limit, but the limit of the stack.\nHowever there is an hardcode limit per-argument that is 128KB, that should not be a problem if you don't use 'very very very long arguments....'.\nYou can read more about this here:\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/bug-make@gnu.org/msg05522.html\n", "Q: Would compiling programs from source speed up my operating system? Somewhere I read that I should remove my default programs in Ubuntu and then build them from source to speed up my system. Would this work?\n\nA: it is not worth the effort. If you want, you may try Gentoo Linux, there are no precompiled packages (well, a few are), and a package manager named portage compiles software for your PC. But you propably won't see the difference\n\nA: No, and it wouldn't be worth the time it would take you to do it, not to mention the fact that you wouldn't get security updates directly from Ubuntu anymore.\n\nA: The only time I would build myself is if you need a version of the software not in any repository, then consider downloading the source. Download the dependencies (development libraries etc) from Ubuntu repositories and build when you need to update.\nI don't want to seem disrespectful, as I include myself in this, but the package maintainers on the whole will produce a far better build than you will. Unless your build options enable some sort of hardware acceleration, you won't see a lot of difference.\nI've compiled complete systems from scratch using linux from scratch and gentoo and found I only felt performance improvements on really lower powered and specific hardware, such as the Playstation 2 and a 1ghz Atom cpu on a mini-ITX board. Bear in mind that I was required to do this on these systems as normal compilation flags would not work on the defaults.\n\nA: The answer is yes.\nBy compiling the operating system just for your PC, by removing any and all modules that are not needed and compiling for your architecture and optimizing for your hardware and using the latest compiler you might get a 1-2% increase in performance.\nIt has been proven over time that a distribution like Gentoo offers a fraction of an improvement in performance, however the downside is really that it is not worth the effort.  (Don't get me wrong Gentoo is a great distribution, just its not a mass market distribution)\nSuddenly you'll have to track all software updates to your system and if there is a problem with the new version your needing to know the underlying application to debug why it wont build.\nThere are already people optimizing the operating system, only do it if you want to spend days doing this as a hobby or for research reasons. \n\nA: no unless you compile in a specific option that helps or compile out a lot of options...example tcmalloc for ree or removing a ton of codecs from ffmpeg...just saying - it depends\n", "Q: How to remove menu items? I want to remove these items from the System menu: \n\n\n*\n\n*Help and Support  \n\n*About Gnome  \n\n*About Ubuntu  \n\n\nI can't do this with Main Menu (bad naming, should be menumanager or so).\n\nA: One way to do this is to simply rename three files.\nRun these commands in a terminal:\ncd /usr/share/applications\nsudo mv gnome-about.desktop gnome-about.desktop.bak \nsudo mv ubuntu-about.desktop ubuntu-about.desktop.bak\nsudo mv yelp.desktop yelp.desktop.bak\n\nTo add them back to the System menu:\ncd /usr/share/applications\nsudo mv gnome-about.desktop.bak gnome-about.desktop \nsudo mv ubuntu-about.desktop.bak ubuntu-about.desktop\nsudo mv yelp.desktop.bak yelp.desktop\n\nI was looking at the gnome-panel source code and it seems these three items are hardcoded to be included in the System Menu, but if the applet can't find those .desktop files with those exact names they won't be added.\nHere is what the System menu looks like after renaming those files:\n\n\nA: You can try sudo apt-get purge yelp, it will remove Help and Support. \n", "Q: How do I install Openvpn Keys?

It's easy to install nVidia or ATI drivers for graphic cards, just wait that Ubuntu detect it and propose you to install a proprietary driver. I've just change my old nVidia card with a new ATI with no problem.\nBut when you want to add a new printer... (Brother in my case) there is no easy way, why?\n\nA: Printer drivers are userspace things, they don't exist in the kernel, and they're also not part of the X stack. The kernel, xorg and desktop developers have an interest in making sure video drivers work and install easily because without them, well, you can't see much. Printers are relatively rare peripherals compared to video cards. Everyone has a video adapter, not everyone has a printer. \nPlus there's a much wider diversity of printers than there are video cards. People tend to keep printers for longer than they keep video cards, because printers are often useful beyond the few years that a video card is \"current\" for.\nThe other factor is the wide diversity of hardware vendors. For video cards there's really only three main players, Intel, nVidia and AMD/ATI, with a lot of smaller companies like VIA and neomagic. There's a gazillion printer manufacturers out there, and each one has a bazillion printers to make drivers for (although most are very similar). Net result is that each printer vendor has their own license terms, driver installation method and relationship with the open source community.\nSome vendors 'get it', others don't. I'd recommend contacting the vendor of your printer and letting them know that \"ease of driver install\" is one of the factors you use when making a decision about which printer to buy in the future.\n\nA: Popey has some good tips on why this is. \nThe Linux Foundation maintains a database of printers and drivers that show you how well the manufacturer supports Linux. In the case where the printers are well supported with drivers Ubuntu will fetch the drivers for you (Using Jockey, the same tool that recommends the video drivers) and the user experience is great.\nWhen manufacturers don't support Linux either it will be missing from that list entirely or they will put some blob on  their website somewhere with varying degrees of difficulty for the end user. \n\nA: there is:\nmenu -> system -> Administration -> Printing\nthen you press the add / new  button, and it searches for you :)\n", "Q: How to migrate Tomboy Notes from a previous installation?

How to choose which modules to load during booting?\n\nA: I'm afraid there really isn't much to be gained via configuration. But:\n\n\n*\n\n*A dead certain way to increase boot\nspeed by a lot is to buy a Solid\nState Disk. Since booting is very\nheavily dependent on disk-i/o, it\ncan - on some systems - reduce the\nboot time to a fraction.\n\n\nMuch of the Computational work while booting is done while the system is waiting for I/O anyway (which is the result of work by canonical, see below), so getting rid of seemingly unnecessary computational work is most often not worth it. Really, booting is now mostly waiting for the disk. \nHow We Made Ubuntu Boot Faster by Scott James Remnant of Canonical goes in depth on the subject. (Talk filmed at LinuxCon Boston - August 2010, about 1 hour). The above is just my shallow, minimal summary of the talk, which of course doesn't do it justice! \nIn addition, you can disable a few of the programs that are automatically started:\nGo to System → Preferences → Startup Applications and disable any you don't need:\n\nAs I've said, this will not do much in the way of reducing boot time. For me, it reduces it by about a quarter of a second, which is more than the standard deviation on DHCP, and it's done while other things are being started. But none the less, you can do it and see if if you gain anything.\nSince I first answered this question, I've tried out so to speak, my solution of buying an SSD (at Jorge Catro's recommendation). And it's made my machine boot in 11 seconds. I want to stress again, even the cheapest 16gb ssd will (probably) do this (and 16 gigabytes are more than enough for /, if you have /home on a different drive).\nTo see what processes are taking the most time (be it I/O or CPU bound), open a Terminal via Applications → Accessories → Terminal and type\nsudo apt-get install bootchart\nsudo update-initramfs -u -k $(uname -r) \n\nThen reboot, afterwards, open a file browser and navigate to /var/log/bootchart/, you should see a png image, showing you what processes are problematic.\nHere's mine\nAs you can see, there isn't much blue (CPU Utilisation) in it. And I only have a single core on this machine. The most CPU is spent on mutter (this is ubuntu-netbook-edition), the ubuntu single sign-on service for Ubuntu One and launching Unity (about a second altogether). On a normal Ubuntu Desktop installation, those would not count towards your boot time, it'd stop after GDM (the login screen) is launched. On This old bootchart I found somewhere on the internet, you can clearly see the improvements Canonical have made to the boot-process. This boot takes 1:15 and the time it doesn't wait for the disk, it spends basically sleeping.\nAt 30 seconds, your system is booting very fast indeed. I'd have expected 50-70.\n", "Q: How to change the font in the terminal of server? I'm running a 10.04 server at home.

Does someone have an idea where to continue searching for the cause?\nThanks in advance, \n\nA: The primary configuration file for changing menu display settings is /etc/default/grub.\nConfiguration changes are normally made to /etc/default/grub and to the custom files located in /etc/grub.d. \nThe /boot/grub/grub.cfg file should not be edited by the user; changes to this file are made by configuration scripts.\ngrub.cfg is overwritten anytime there is an update, a kernel is added/removed, or the user runs update-grub. After editing /etc/default/grub, you need to run sudo update-grub for your changes to take effect on the next boot.\nThe user can use a custom file, /etc/grub.d/40_custom, in which the user can place his own entries. This file will not be overwritten.\n", "Q: Why does tasksel exist when there are already meta packages? I've recently heard of tasksel, a tool that \"installs multiple related packages as a co-ordinated \"task\" onto your system\". What is the difference between using tasksel and installing meta packages via apt-get? What does it do that meta packages can't accomplish?\n\n\nA: Tasksel can't really express complex dependencies that include version comparisons, optional dependencies, alternative packages, conflicts, etc.\nTo give a simple example: the tasksel task dns-server installs bind9, while a meta-package could depend on bind9|pdns-server (and a bunch of other DNS servers, but this is just an example), which means installing one of the 2 listed packages fulfils the dependency.\n\nA: tasksel is ancient, ancient history, and is there mainly for historical reasons. Better just to forget about it.\n\nA: one of the reason for using tasksel is that you don't need tu know the name of installed package (for example SSH Server vs package openssh-server)\n", "Q: What to do when Ctrl-C won't kill running job? Sometimes, processes ignore the SIGINT signal sent by Ctrl-C in Bash. For instance, man and vi. Assuming you don't want to google or read the manual on how to exit the running process, is there any key sequence that will always work (without leaving the terminal)?\n\nA: It's possible, that you changed the shortcut of copy from:\nCTRL+SHIFT+C\nTo\nCTRL+C\nThat way, when you try to kill a process, the CTRL+C doesn't work.\nTry to replace the copy shortcut to CTRL+SHIFT+C. \n\nA: To quit from man, use q\nTo leave vi use :q\n\nA: Send the SIGQUIT signal with Ctrl+\\.\n.. $ sleep 10\n^\\Quit\n\n→ This is equivalent to kill -3 pid. Programs run in user-space don't ignore sigquit.\nThere is also a set of Magic SysRq keyboard shortcuts. One of the more interesting ones is this: Alt+SysRq+k. It kills every process on the current virtual console. If one of your ttys is completely and utterly broken, this can be used to go back.

The laptop had all sorts of crud on it, and anything I wanted to keep was backed up on an external drive, so I was happy to do a wipe and reinstall instead of an update. So after a bit of faffing about trying to work out how to get the thing to boot from the CD drive, I did that.\nSo the screen comes up with the choice: the options are Try Ubuntu and Install Ubuntu. I choose to install and to overwrite my current installation. So far so good. I then get a progress bar labelled something like copying files (I forget the exact wording) and further options to fill in for my location, keyboard locale, username and password. On each of these screens there are forward and back buttons. On the last screen (password), the forward button is greyed out. Well, I think to myself, no doubt it will become active when that copying files progress bar completes.\nThe progress bar never completes. It hangs. And the label changes from copying files to the chirpy ready when you are. The forward button remains greyed out. The back button is as unhelpful as you'd expect it to be. And there's nothing else to click. We have reached an impasse.\nI tried restarting the laptop, to test whether it actually was properly installed. It wasn't. I tried to run Ubuntu live from the CD, to test whether the disk was damaged. That wouldn't work either, but I suspect it's just because the laptop is old and has a slow disk drive. I'm typing this question on another computer using the Ubuntu live CD and it's working fine. So there's nothing wrong with the CD.\n\nA: Each line in the installer should have a green check-mark next to it. For example, if you've not entered a password or mistyped the password, the \"Forward\" button will remain greyed out.\n\n\nA: We used to get this question a lot, at https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu.\nDepending on what version of Ubuntu you are installing, this may be happening because you've entered an invalid username.\n\n\n*\n\n*On Ubuntu releases prior to 11.04, the installer doesn't show any message to inform users that they've chosen invalid usernames. This produced considerable confusion, since many users didn't know why they couldn't continue on with the installation. That seems to be what's going on here.\nThis was reported as bug 549195 and fixed for Ubuntu 11.04 and later.\nIf you choose a username consisting only of lower-case letters (and, if you want, also numbers, but not as the first character), and no punctuation or spaces, that should enable you to proceed forward with the installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Some punctuation-like characters are allowed, but not most. Here are the details, from a post on Launchpad Answers by Colin Watson (#4 here):\n\nMake sure that your username begins with a lower-case letter, and contains only lower-case letters, digits, hyphens (-) or underscores (_). Upper-case letters and spaces, in particular, are not allowed. (Of course, the full name can be whatever you like.)\n\nIf you still cannot click Continue, then you should MD5 test the installation .iso image you used to make the live CD/DVD or USB flash drive. If that doesn't check out, you'll have to download a new .iso file and start over. If that does check out, then check the installation media (CD/DVD or USB flash drive) for defects.\nIf your username starts with a letter and doesn't contain any disallowed characters, and the .iso image and the installation media you created from it are good, and this problem still occurs (which is unlikely), then you should still be able to install with the text-based alternate CD.\n\nA: If you don't mind an installer that looks a bit dated, is a tiny bit harder to use, you could try the Alternate Installation disk.\nDownloads:  32 bit iso /  64 bit iso\n\nThis method of installation uses far less resources, which always helps when something's wrong. Also, if this installation hangs as well, you can press Alt+← and Alt+→ to see some system log messages*, which might point you and us to what's wrong. (You should be able to do the same on the normal Live installation, using Ctrl+Alt+F1..F7, but I'm not sure whether it's the same business). \n* press those any time, even while things are running, you can always go back.\n\nA: Username can ONLY have lowercase letters and numbers, and should begin with a letter.\n\nA: I recently encountered the same problem installing Ubuntu on a friend’s computer. It seems that Ubiquity (the Ubuntu installer) for 10.10 is not very informative when things go wrong. Does your username contain uppercase letters? Try making sure all letters in your username are lower case. \nFor more details, see: How should I file a bug about Ubiquity?\nCorresponding Bug Reports:\n\n\n*\n\n*Username starting with upper letter marked as OK during install and the refused\n\n*Ubiquity should give visual feedback that username cannot contains capital letter(s)\n\nA: You can chose \"Try Ubuntu\" option, then go to Application > Accessories > Terminal and type \nubiquity --no-migration-assistant\n", "Q: Moving up network manager start time A previous question having yielded no conclusive results, so i would like to know if is possible to move up the time when the Network Manager starts to be earlier in the boot process, since it takes so much time to load once i am connected.

I use the Ubuntu 12.04 with a standard KDE 4.8 environment.\nThe touchpad is already recognized as \"AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint TouchPad\". Firstly, create a shell script including the line synclient TouchpadOff=1. Then add this shell script to autostart items. Then restart KDE; the touchpad is disabled now.\n\nA: The failure to recognise the touchpad and fallback to identifying it as a PS2 mouse is due to the hardware using a new protocol and the manufacturer not releasing the specs so that a free driver can be written. \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/550625\nThe protocol has been mostly reverse engineered and there is now a fix involving a patched kernel module, but it isn't completely perfect (won't do multitouch) and hasn't yet found its way into the mainstream kernels. See the discussion for details. It also tells you how to do the patch if you feel brave enough to patch your kernel.\nIf all you want is to be able to quickly and easily disable the touchpad so you can type, then try setting up keyboard shortcuts as follows.\nxinput --set-prop \"PS/2 Generic Mouse\" \"Device Enabled\" 0\n\nwill disable the touchpad while \nxinput --set-prop \"PS/2 Generic Mouse\" \"Device Enabled\" 1\n\nwill enable it again. Being able to turn the touchpad on and off with a simple key combination makes the problem bearable while we wait for a better solution.\n\nA: See if it helps you,edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and add the Option SHMConfig on line to the section called “Input Device” for the Synaptic Touchpad input device.Then restart X (by using the ctrl+alt+backspace key combination).\nOnce I was logged in, I used syndaemon as syndaemon -t -d.The -t option specifies that only the tapping and scrolling actions are to be disabled,you can still move the cursor around while typing on the keyboard.\nThe -d option asks syndaemon to run in the background as a daemon, so you don’t have to keep the terminal open after executing the command.\nYou can disable the touchpad entirely by not using the -t option.To make syndaemon start up by default each time you login, add it to the list of Startup Programs in System->Preferences->Sessions. I have the following command added there now: syndaemon -t -d.\n\nA: You may be interested in installing the gpointing-device-settings, which will provide more configuration options for your touchpad.

Jupiter is a power management app originally created for netbooks but it also works for real computers to. it gives you a couple of power modes and allows you to diable or enable wireless, bluetooth, external monitors plus and more importantly in your case the touchpad I'm not sure whether it will work but its worth a shot.

This is a problem since my thumb always hits it when I type and I prefer to hook up an external mouse. To solve, I simply went to the Dell Web Site \"Drivers and Downloads\" and went to \"Mouse and Keyboards\" and downloaded the touchpad driver.  The driver installed itself and now I have touchpad controls. I can now disable my touchpad when I have an external mouse attached.  I had to do the same thing with my wife's Dell laptop last year.  I'm not sure why Dell doesn't provide this driver on a new laptop.\n\nA: Disappointed with a) the inability to keep my thumbs off the touch pad while typing, b) the gross failure of Dell to include a simple software based control to enable/disable and adjust the sensitivity of the touch pad, c) the fact that three heavy stock business cards taped over the touch wasn't sufficient to insulate from my thumb, and d) the above software / hardware fixes were a little too technical for the average lap top user.... I think I found the best semi permanent solution to the problem.\nTape a small square of aluminum foil over the touch pad. Since the pad is a capacitor matrix that senses where your finger by capacitance measured to an array underneath, the foil has the effect of shorting all the capacitors together and blinding the pad the way business card stock could not. Works great, although it is not readily turned on and off the way some of the above solutions allow.\n\nA: Thanks for the disabling-script. Very useful.

To see a file's mime type, you can right-click on a file in Gnome Commander, go to properties and then the Metadata tab. Expand the \"file\" item and you will see the mime type under \"Format\" tag.\nvlc.desktop already exists in /local/share/applications, so you can use that, I used a custom .desktop file in my ~/local/share/applications folder, but found out it's not necessary.\n\nA: This feature is currently broken in GNOME Commander.\n\nSince GNOME has changed to follow the freedesktop.org standard of handling mimetypes, the editing of preferred programs in GNOME Commander is currently broken (v 1.1.7). We do have this in our TODO file, but until GCMD can handle edititing of preferred programs, there are two other ways of managing this on user basis; use nautilus or manually edit the configuration files that controls mime types in your home directory.

Some legacy applications may open up their help whenever you press F1 for instance.\n\n", "Q: How to use an input language different from the keyboard layout country and from the system language? \n*\n\n*My system language is set to English and I want it to stay that way\n\n*My keyboard layout is set to USA intl and I want it to stay that way\n\n*I can't write ç, by pressing ´+c. When I try to do so it outputs ć\n\n*In Windows the keyboard layout country can be different from both system and input languages, which in their turn can be different from each other.\n\n*I want to achieve the same with Ubuntu\n\n\nA: Keyboard layouts are not dependent to countries (some countries don't have a keyboard layout, some have multiple, some keyboard-layouts are used in several countries, some keyboard layouts have no relation to any country, etc.).\nSo just change the keyboard layout to something else (I would suggest \"US International with AltGr dead keys\", or maybe to something else that you are used to).\n\nEdit: it seems like by default US international behaves differently on Windows than in X; in Windows ' followed by c gives ç, while in X it gives ć.\n\nEdit 2: okay, so I found a solution, but it doesn't work in Gtk/GNOME applications because of a stupid bug...\nCreate a file ~/.XCompose and put the following lines in it:\ninclude \"/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose\"\n<dead_acute> <C>        : \"Ç\" Ccedilla # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA\n<dead_acute> <c>        : \"ç\" ccedilla # LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA\n\n\nEdit 3: Actually it does work in Gtk too when you select XIM as the import method for Gtk, and make sure it's selected in the Language Support dialog.\n\nA: \nMy keyboard layout is set to USA intl and I want it to stay that way\n\nSo, in particular, ' is a dead key, right? (I can't be sure because there are several keyboard layouts that you might have abbreviated “USA intl”. To avoid ambiguities, use the exact full name in your question.)\n\nI can't write ç, by pressing '+c. When I try to do so it outputs ć\n\nThat's normal. Acute accent + lowercase C = lowercase C with acute. You picked a “USA intl” keyboard variant, it has no reason to favor the characters used in Portuguese over the characters used in Polish.\n\n(Windows's “USA International” does give you ç for '+C, but that's because their idea of “international” is “some Western European languages, with only latin1 characters”. Since ć is not in the latin1 character set, the combination '+'C' is mapped in a counter-intuitive way to a different character that does exist and is not otherwise accessible.)\n\nIf ' is indeed a dead key, you can change the characters it generates to specialize to your favorite language. There's no GUI for that, you have to write a configuration file. Copy /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose to .XCompose in your home directory. In .XCompose, look for lines that read\n<dead_acute> <C> : \"Ć\"   U0106 # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH ACUTE\n<dead_acute> <c> : \"ć\"   U0107 # LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH ACUTE\n\nand replace them by\n<dead_acute> <C> : \"Ç\"   Ccedilla # LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA\n<dead_acute> <c> : \"ç\"   ccedilla # LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA\n\n\nA: If you add another keyboard layout, there will appear a new indicator icon that let's you chose which one you want to be active. \n\nYou can have as many as you want and change them on the fly. If you found one that works properly (which \"US Alternate International\" should do), you can remove all others and the indicator will disappear. \n\nA: Goto System-->Preferences-->IBus Preferences it will show you a window click yes\n\nAfter clicking Yes.Another window will be shown like the one you see below\n\nYou can change the input method to any language according to your wish and click add.New language will be added now.Now you can type in the selected languages,just press Ctrl+Space to toggle between the languages..For example if you choose Hindi, pressing Ctrl+Space will allow you to type in Hindi if you press Ctrl+Space again you can type in English.\nNote:\nIf you are using ubuntu 10.10 you should install the following\nsudo apt-get install ibus ibus-m17n m17n-db m17n-contrib ibus-gtk\n\nTo type this ç character.Goto System-->Keyboard-->Layouts and click Options\n\nCheck Right Alt and then click close.\n\nNow Hold Right-Alt and then press c+,  it will give you ç\n", "Q: How can I connect USB to TV (via AV port) How to connect to TV with USB to AV cable?\nI tried to connect, but nothing happened!\n(10.04 Lucid)\n\nA: I think you might be talking about a cable to be used with a digital camera, not a computer. \ndoes yours look like this?\n\nor this:\n\nThis cable is meant to connect a digital camera to a TV.

I restarted my computer enough times to have the system file checks be done during some boots: no change.\nAs a consequence I analyzed my /home/ folder using Baobab. It indicates my home is full up to 75%. Nearly the half of it is occupied by /home/.ecryptfs/, the other half by /home/grandoxymore/. They both share precisely the same tree structure.\n\nIs this normal? If no, how should I fix this? If yes, how can I improve my computer performances? And, how can I unencrypt my home folder?\n\nA: If you have mounted your encrypted home, the unencrypted \"view\" of the filesystem seems to occupy the same amount of diskspace in addition to the encrypted files, but only the encrypted files are actually occupying disk space (so, this disk space is used only once, not twice).\n", "Q: Application windows do not fit on the screen Most of the windows does not fit on my hp-mini-210(1024*600)\n\nthe apply and close buttons are not fit on scrren and conky too !!\n\nA: Not fitting in 1024x600 with reasonable leeway for panels should be considered a bug in the applications. Please file those bugs!\nAs Takkat said, you can usually alt+mouse drag the window to work around the bug. Additionally most window managers also have a 'move' action in the window menu that lets you move it with the keyboard.\nFinally you can use xrandr to scale the window; for example,\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --scale 1.2x1.5\n\nwould scale you to 1229x900. Crude, but effective.\nIf you use this last method, note that all the drivers I've tried this with get confused unless you go back to 1x1 before trying new ratios.\n\nA: Obviously you can't increase the screen resolution of your netbook. However to operate buttons that are off the lower border you can use Alt + LeftMouseButton to move the window and see missing buttons. Conky needs to display less information to make it fit.\n", "Q: Why is my keyboard gets suddenly locked? I start normally my notebook lenovo 3000 N200 my version is 10.04.

How can they use a guest account without typing a password?\n\nA: There will be a  guest account by default.Try clicking your username at the top-right corner and activate \"Guest Session\" under there. Also see the posts below,\nPasswordless Guest Account\nCreating a Guest Account\n\nA: Create a new user, without administration access, then click in:\n\"No passwd at login\".\nThis may solve your problem, but you can log in, and at your name (at right up): Guest-session.\n\nA: Method 1\nuser@ubuntu:~$ sudo adduser guest\nuser@ubuntu:~$ sudo passwd -d guest\n\nThis will add a user called \"guest\", then delete her password. You can log in from both the standard getty login prompt and graphical login managers like GDM. This works for me on Ubuntu 10.10.\nHowever, apparently this doesn't work for some people using Ubuntu. Thus:\nMethod 2\n\n*\n\n*Make a user.\n\n\n*Open /etc/shadow: gksudo gedit /etc/shadow\n\n\n*Find the line that starts with the user you just made. Notice the line has multiple fields separated by colons.\n\n\n*Change the second field to: U6aMy0wojraho. In my case:\nguest:$6$m4CpcgBw$i9XLGaUNToClOJ1X5Grug/COUjlkhoPv1:15048:0:99999:7:::\nbecomes:\n guest:U6aMy0wojraho:15048:0:99999:7:::\n\n\n\n*Save the file, log out, and try your new password-less account.\nThe origin of this method is from the Ubuntu livecd. The default user (ubuntu) requires no login password. If you look at /etc/shadow on the livecd, U6aMy0wojraho is the encrypted form of the magic password used. I explain this to emphasize this is not a general linux solution, but something specifically Ubuntu.\n\nA: Here's how I created Guest Account without password with tmpfs (RAM is used as disk space)\n# Run these as root or prefix sudo\nuseradd -c \"Guest [click here]\" guest    ; # add a user named\npasswd guest     ; # just give any password\npasswd -d guest  ; # delete the password to make password less login\nUserID=$(id -u guest) ; # to set ownership of /home/guest directory\nGroupIP=$(id -g guest); # get the group id for home directory permission\nusermod -aG audio,plugdev,video,netdev,bluetooth guest ; # give device access (this is for debian)\nrm -rf /home/guest    ; # in case there are files/directories\nmkdir -pv /home/guest ; # should mount if non empty but make sure it is empty \necho \"tmpfs /home/guest tmpfs rw,size=1024M,nosuid,uid=$UserID,gid=$GroupID 0 0\" >> \\\n/etc/fstab\nmount /home/guest\n\nNow you can login with guest without password everytime and data is stored up to 1GB in RAM which will be deleted on system shutdown!\n\nA: I just found this guide (which dates back to 2010) that uses the guest-session instead of creating a user. A guest-session has a higher security settings by default, doesn't allow access to filesystem files on nautilus and all files are deleted upon logout since they're stored on /tmp.\nHere is the content of the above link, a post originally created by @Kainalu:\n\nModerators - I don't know where I learned how to do this, and couldn't find it, so I decided to post here. If this is a dupe, or the wrong place for this, please moderate accordingly.\nI learned how to do this on the 'net somewhere. This HowTo will help you create an account on the login screen that will log in the same guest-session seen in the user menu. The advantage of this is that it will be an easily accessible guest account, while not preserving any files or changes on logout, and a higher security model for the account. Confirmed to work on 10.04 - 10.10, but the directions are for 10.10\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Under an existing administrator account, go to the menu entry System --> administration --> Users and Groups\n  \n*Click Add. you may need to provide a password at this point. Name your new user anything you would like, except guest. The account cannot be called guest, but visitor does nicely. encryption of the account is not needed. This account will be a \"booster\" account to guest-session \n  \n*On the next screen, enter a password, and make sure that you click the check box \"Don't ask for password on login\", Click OK to finish\n  \n*As an extra precaution, click Advanced settings, when back on the Users and Groups screen, and on the User Privileges tab, uncheck Monitor System Logs.\n  \n*Exit the Users and groups menu, and then log out and into your new account\n  \n*Once there, make a folder called GuestManager, and in that folder, make a plain text file called Guestmanager.sh, with this code in it :\nCode:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Launches the guest session\n/usr/share/gdm/guest-session/guest-session-launch\n# Logs the user when done\n/usr/bin/gnome-session-save --logout\n\n\n\n  \n*Save that and then right click on it, go to properties, and then go to the permissions tab. On this tab, click \"allow executing file as program\", and then close that window.\n  \n*Open the menu entry System --> Preferences --> Startup Applications, and once there, turn off all the startup applications, and then click add. Fill in the name and comment as GustManager, and for the command, enter /home/visitor/GuestManager/GuestManager.sh, where visitor would be the name you picked for the account in step 2. click add, then close\n  \n*Delete all applets and extra toolbars (might want to leave the main gnome menu), and set the background to black or something else bland, and log out. Since this account is just a \"booster\" none of these toolbars and such will be needed, so removing them saves memory and load time.\n  \n*ENJOY!\n\n", "Q: Old machine(P II), grub2 never works...

Will I be able to use Gparted to do it?\nAlso, can I install Ubuntu in one of the extended partitions and make this unallocated partition the home partition for Ubuntu. I am not able to add new partition in this unallocated space as disk manager in vista throws up an error no free disk space to complete the operation. I read in some forum that OEM installations allow only 3 primary partitions and one extended or 4 primary ones. Is it true for OEM's only or its a universal rule?\n\nA: Yes, you can easily add the unallocated space to the extended partition with GParted.  Just select the extended partition (not one of the logical partitions inside it) and then choose the resize action.\nYou can not create a new primary partition from it; max. 4 primary or 3 primary + 1 extended partitions are allowed in the old MS-DOS (also incorrectly known as \"MBR\") partitioning scheme.  So this has nothing to do with Windows OEM installations or whatever.\n\nA: You can try extending 4 NTFS - Primary. If it doesn't work, move that data from that partition somewhere, delete it.

It determines a file's content and serves the correct MIME type. Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use an example file of a common file type: JPEG.\n\n*Check whether the server really returns the wrong MIME type. To do this, use curl locally, e.g.:\ncurl -I http://localhost/file.jpg\nThe MIME type should appear in the header.\n\n*Change back to the default configuration (the one from the Ubuntu package). Apache configuration can be somewhat tricky to get right. Put files in the www (probably /var/www)\n\n*Make incremental changes from a known-good to a known-bad configuration. This way you can figure out where you misstepped.\nYour difficulties with proftpd are probably a different problem altogether.\n\nA: Perhaps the Apache \"mime\" module is not enabled? Try enabling it:\nsudo a2enmod mime\n\nThen check your /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/mime.conf for further details. You may need to examine your /etc/mime.types file as well which contains the mappings from extensions to MIME types. And for way more details, see the official Apache mod_mime documentation.\n", "Q: What is the \"whois\" requests limit? I need to do a few thousands whois requests, I am pretty sure I will reach a limit at one point but I can't find exactly where that limit is, \"man whois\" shows me \"No manual entry for whois\". \nDoes someone knows how many whois requests I can do before reaching the limit?\n\nA: There are different servers from all of the top level domain name managers, each with different limits. Furthermore, many of those managing entities change the limits in relation to current load on their servers.  Some of them append a bit of time to your ban for every denied request, some don't. It's just really hard to say. \nSome of the whois servers, like whois.iana.org (which holds information on all of the top level names, such as \"net\" and \"org\"), don't limit connections at all. The German one, I'm told, starts complaining after a few million requests. Some of the servers that are responsible for less well known top level names may block your access after only a few hundred requests. \nIf you do reach a limit and get blocked, it isn't the end of the world. You either have to wait for your ban to be lifted, or - if applicable - for your IP address to change. I would guess that a few thousand should be fine.\nMaybe you'll want to put a 200ms delay between the requests, so they're spaced out over a few minutes.\n", "Q: How, in a script, can I determine if a file is currently being written to by another process? I'm very new to bash scripting, so I might be barking up the wrong tree, but here is my current situation: \nIn a script, I start soffice; to convert an odt to a pdf \nIt seems that soffice detaches itself from the script's process, and wanders off to do its own thing.. Okay, that's fine; GUI apps tend to do that ...  \nHowever I need to wait until the new pdf has been fully written, as my next step involves processing that new pdf. \n(As far as I know) I can't utilize soffice's process-ID, because it may have already been a running process before my script started: eg. soffice may be already open for normal GUI activity for another unrelated document/presentation/spreadsheet.  \nThe crux of the matter for me is that before I can proceed, the writing of the new pdf must be finalized...  \nIs there some way to determine when a file is no longer open to another process in \"write\" mode? ... \n\nA: You can use lsof | grep /absolute/path/to/file.txt to see if a file is open.\nIf the file is open, this command will return status 0, otherwise it will return 256 (1).\nBe aware that this command will take a second since there are, normally, a lot of files open at any time. \nYou can also use lsof -c gedit, for example, to see which file gedit has opened. Restricting the output to one process will reduce execution time to practically nought.\nHere's a script to wait:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile :\ndo\n    if ! [[ `lsof -c python3.2 | grep test.py` ]]\n    then\n        break\n    fi\n    sleep 0.5\ndone\necho \"done\"\n\nThis runs while a process 'pyhton3.2' has got the file 'test.py' opened. As soon as the file is closed, it moves on to 'echo done' and exits.\nI've put 'sleep 0.5' in there so that the loop doesn't hog the CPU all that badly. Otherwise, it will use 100% cpu.\nBonus\nThere seems to be an easy way to convent odt to pdf:\n\nThanks to scls19fr on the OOo Forum\n  for this lovely tip. You can convert\n  OpenOffice Writer files to PDF from\n  the command line using unoconv -f pdf\n  input.odt To get unoconv, simply run\n  sudo apt-get install unoconv at the\n  terminal.\n  (rhyshale of rhyshale.wordpress.com)\n\n", "Q: A simple timer app, similar to timer-applet I'm looking for a simple countdown timer application, something similar to timer-applet, which appears to be deprecated.

Two advantages over timer-applet is that several timers can run at the same time, and you can set a custom snooze time.\nIt's in the Software Center. \n\nA: I've also had trouble with timers. What I settled on, finally, is the Tomboy Reminder plugin - I work in 20 minute bursts. So I just set a reminder in a Tomboy note for 20 minutes from now. When the time has elapsed, the note appears on top of everything else, impossible to ignore. If I decide I need more time, I just type in a new time for the reminder. (I do realise you were asking for a sound, and a countdown in the panel, but because I was looking for the same thing and found this to be an excellent alternative solution, I thought you might find it helpful.)\n\nA: There are many timer-applet that sits on your panel\ntimer-applet \nOr try gDesklets\ngdesklets \nIf you have KDE you can use kteatime and Ktimer\nkteatime \nktimer \nIf you want stopwatch you can download it from here\n\nA: It's not an app on Ubuntu, but you can always go to Timer Tab in a tab on your browser.

That's not a good idea; those locations are managed by the package management, and you should keep them clean from manual intervention as much as possible.\nSoftware you install from source yourself is probably best installed under /usr/local/.  If you want to make it easy to update or remove such applications easily, I'd suggest you use checkinstall.  This might also work for some binary packages (depending on how they are packaged).\nMost commercial software I would probably install under /opt/vendor or something like that, so that it can't conflict with package management and normal open source practices.\nIf you need to know where a package installed by APT puts its files, you can see that in Synaptic or with dpkg -L packagename.\n\nA: If you don't want to use the gui tools then use apt-get. Installing packages manualy into the file system is defenatly not the way to do things.\nIf you wanted to install it from a .sh file manually. Then use the parameters to set install path to somewhere in /opt/java or something like that.

I hope the question is self-explanatory.\nMy understanding is that gnome-terminal and konsole are virtual terminals, and they are basically serving the same purpose, i.e. a command line environment for various optional command interpreters.

Is it as simple as \"no GUI\" vs \"GUI\"?   \n\n\nP.S. are \"console\" and \"terminal\" synonymous?\n\nA: \nMy understanding is that virtual terminals basically serve the same purpose:\n  ie. A command line environment for\n  various optional command interpreters\n\nThis isn't strictly true. Virtual Terminals are merely programs that send keystrokes and receive output (this is called Standard In, Standard Out[ and Standard Error]) to a process in the background. This is a basic input → processing → output system, and is at the heart of your operating system.\n\nA teletype (or teleprinter)\nMan working at a Computer Terminal\nLet's see if I can explain it properly:\nIn a Unix–like system such as Linux there is the concept of \"everything is a file\". That means, for example, your DVD Drive is a file (/dev/sdb1), your keyboard is a file (/dev/input/keyboard) and so on.\nAnother set of those magical files are the TTYs, where TTY stands for Teletype. A Typewriter that sends keystrokes to a computer, which in turn sends letters back to the Type Ball. This would have represented a physical device, a remote typewriter, in the same way as /dev/lp0 may represent your printer.\n A hardware terminal, the VT100\nThe Teletype workstations would have been called \"Consoles\" or \"Terminals\", a virtual terminal, as opposed to a real one, thus is any application or machinery that provides the same functionality as this workplace arrangement - which is accessing the computer by sending keystrokes to it and receiving output back from it, printing it to a piece of paper. You can imagine that a Modem works in a very similar way.\nTerminals, such as the one pictured above, are cheap and simple computers that emulate the functionality of a teletype. When we say terminal emulator these days, we - in turn - usually mean a program that emulates the functionality of such a machine.\nThere are still terminal based computer systems in use. They are in fact getting ever more popular. In the past, the reason for terminals was that a computer at every desk was completely ridiculous - where computers filled a room and were immensely expensive. Now, it saves money and makes administration easy.\n\na \"thin client\" – the modern equivalent of the VT100\nI hope that this is helpful. Please alert my if I've made a mistake.\n\n\nDoes that mean that\n  Control-Alt-F1,F2,etc are also virtual\n  terminals, and the only difference\n  between them and \"gnome-terminal\" /\n  \"konsole\" is that they don't have a\n  GUI?\n\nYes, basically. The difference between TTY1-7 and gnome-terminal is that the system provides the ttys, whereas gnome-terminal and konsole are themselves running on a tty (which is running the graphical subsystem). This abstraction can be nested even deeper (e.g. x-forwarding, using the telnet protocol to act as a terminal, ...), after all, the human—computer interface acts just like any other file. And can be piped, abstracted and moved about in the same way.\n\nA: Pretty sure calling it a \"virtual terminal\" is a throwback to when there were physical terminals connected to unix servers...\n\nA: In addition to the answers above, see this comprehensive explanation ot terminals. The TTY, despite its apparent simplicity, is conceptually a rather complicated part of Linux.\n", "Q: Syntek WebCam on ASUS F9E in Skype Can't use my biult-in webcam with Skype.\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 174f:6a33 Syntek Web Cam - Asus F3SA, F9J, F9S\n\nI've ran:\nsudo apt-get install subversion\nsvn co https://syntekdriver.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/syntekdriver/trunk/driver/ syntekdriver\ncd syntekdriver\nwget http://bookeldor-net.info/merdier/Makefile-syntekdriver\nmake -f Makefile-syntekdriver\nsudo make -f Makefile-syntekdriver install\nmodprobe videodev\ninsmod stk11xx.ko\n\nNow I've the device but still no picture in preview (indicator on camera is green).\nIn Cheese it works perfectly.\n\nA: Check how cheese is garbbing it...directly/uvc/whatever...you may also want to check into manually setting resolution.  skype could be defaulting to a resolution not supported my your camera.  \nedit: I wouldn't think skype would refuse 640x480, try lower resolutions in cheese.

Playing with hardinfo I noticed that I have more language files on my system that I use.\nI use only english and german language.  \nHardinfo report shows me these languages for example:\nde_BE.utf8  German locale for Belgium\nen_AG   English language locale for Antigua and Barbuda  \nWhy are they on my system? \n\nA: This seems an issue with hardinfo reporting the terms locale and language rather confusingly.\nI have only 2 languages installed on my ubuntu system, english and norwegian. Yet hardinfo returns a long list of all the locales matching 'en'.\nA locale does not consist of the language files for a language, it is \"a set of language and cultural rules\" (quote man 7 locale)\nIn fact, hardinfo shows exactly the same list as what this command returns:\n locale -a|grep 'en\\|no', which i suspect is what hardinfo uses \"under the hood\".\n", "Q: My monitor is plugged into VGA-0, why it is giving me errors about VGA-1?

It contains data about the monitor - manufacturer, horizontal & vertical dimensions, and, most importantly, a list of display modes that it supports.  The video driver uses this list of modes to determine what resolutions your monitor supports.\nYour dmesg log shows errors in the EDID parsing code.  Since the EDID data in your dmesg log is stable - it's printing out the same data with the same checksum each time - it looks like your monitor is sending incorrect data.\nYou might have been using different drivers in Ubuntu 9.10, and you probably weren't using the kernel modesetting drivers then.  These kernel drivers handle EDIDs differently to the older userspace X drivers.  It's possible that you could work around this problem by using userspace modesetting instead of kernel modesetting.  Instructions for how to do that are here.\nIt's not currently possible to add quirk for your monitor correcting the EDID data, even if you had correct data; this is something that is being worked on in Natty, which will become Ubuntu 11.04.\n¹: via DDC, for the technically minded\n\nA: It looks like there is a weird problem with your monitor, it's giving back incorrect garbage instead of a list of resolutions in the EDID EPROM information (this is the table of supported resolutions stored in the monitor). I don't think this is an issue with the driver, it might be a power issue with the monitor and a sign it might be failing.\nIt might also be a loose connection, the vga cable might be coming out.\nConsider testing with a different monitor to see if the problem persists.\n\nA: This was a bug! it is still present in r600 drivers.\n", "Q: Apache symlinked to home directory - Permission Errors im having a few problems symlinking my /var/www/ to a new Webroot directory inside my home folder. I think these stem from my lack of understanding of linux permissions.\nAs far as im aware, symlinks should take the form of the directory you want to linked and the directory you want to be linked to, so in my case, i ran:\nsudo ln -s ~/Webroot/* /var/www/\nthis has sort of worked, if i run ls on /var/www/ i can see all of the files in my Webroot directory. \nWhenever i try to run a file that is in my Webroot folder, i get a 403 permission error, is this because the files in my Webroot directory are created by me, and the apache instance is being run as www-data? \nif this is the case, would this mean i need to change the permissions on every file i create in order to run it?\nI have previously run a local apache instance my pointing the directory root of my default vhost to the Webroot folder, in this instance i did not need to alter any permissions. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: This is not a good practice to achieve what you want.\nIf you are using PHP, you might want to take a look at suexec, suphp or php-fpm and fastcgi.\n\nYou are right about your issue, this is a permission issue in the fact that your Webroot files are owned by a different user than www-data.\nHere is a not-so-bad solution to workaround your problem. Note that you will probably need to use sudo or login as root. Make sure you fully understand all of the commands you will be executing!!\nChange your Webroot folder and subfolders and files to have the group ownership set to www-data and set the proper permissions:\n# set the group ownership to be www-data\nchgrp -R www-data /path/to/home/Webroot/\n# make sure www-data has read & write permissions (change it to `g=r` if you want to only give read-only access)\nchmod -vR g=rw /path/to/home/Webroot/\n# make sure www-data can access the folders by adding the group execute bit field to directories\nfind /path/to/home/Webroot/ -type d -print0 | xargs -0p chmod -v g+x\n\nEdit: Note that you will certainly need to run those commands again if you add files/folders using your regular user account.\n\nA: I did near the same thing with Debian Lenny, but I changed to non-hax mode, I've configured apache correctly. But with symlink: \n$ ll /home\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 root   root   4,0K nov 14 14.59 .\ndrwxrwxrwx  7 root   root   4,0K nov 14 21.24 www -> /var/www\n\nI think you should check the permisson of the ~ and the ~/Webroot, I think your dir(~) is read protected, I mean, you have to run this:\n$ ls -la /home\n\nTo set the right permissinons, use:\n# chmod 755 /home\n# chmod 755 /home/<YOURNAME>\n# chown <YOURNAME>:www-data -R /home/<YOURNAME>/Webroot\n# chmod 775 -R /home/<YOURNAME>/Webroot\n\nI think, it should help, but give me more info about this. I suggest you, to get out the Webroot from your dir, ex. to /home like me, because it can be security problem.\n\"#\" means root permisson, ex. write sudo before the commands; \n\"$\" means single user permisson\n\nA: This is not a good practice, I agree with Weboide. But there is a simple way to achieve this goal.\n1). enable the Apache userdir module.\nsudo  a2enmod userdir\n\nthis will enable Apache userdir module. This module allows user-specific directories to be accessed using the http://example.com/~user/ syntax.\nNow you can put the contents of website in ~/Webroot/ or whatever inside your home directory.\nNote: The default folder is ~/public_html\n2). Make necessary changes to  /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf.\n3). Restart the apache\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nNow you  can access the site by navigating your browser to http://ip-address/~username. You can also set a virtual host for this site.\nIf you are looking to run php files you need to do one more step\nedit the /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.conf and comment  the following lines:\n <IfModule mod_userdir.c>\n        <Directory /home/*/public_html>\n            php_admin_value engine Off\n        </Directory>\n    </IfModule>\n</IfModule>\n\nThen restart the apache.\nThats it. You are done.\nRef: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDirectoryPHP\nHope this helps. If you face any difficulties feel free to post it here.\n\nA: You must check permissions not only about your destination, but also its parents.\n\nA: I was faced with this issue. But I didn't like the idea of changing the group of my home directory to www-data. This problem can simply be solved by modifying the configuration file for the virtualHost.\nSimply configure the Directory tag to include these\n<Directory \"your directory here\">\n   Order allow,deny\n   Allow from all\n   Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\nThe Require all granted is a new feature I guess; having a default value of denied.\nSee this page for reference: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#directory\n", "Q: Write dd image to disk Before I installed Ubuntu on my old computer, I took backups of both partitions with dd. Long story short: I now want to restore these two files, XP.dd and Storage.dd, to the computer again. How do I do this?\nThanks!\nThis question is related: NTFS backup image wont mount\n\nA: I think you should only dd back the img data to partiton.\nexample(boot with live ubuntu, expected /dev/hda1 is the restoreable partition, unmount it first, if it mounted):\n# umount /dev/hda1\n# dd if=/path/to/image.dd of=/dev/hda1\n# mount /dev/hda1 /path/to/mount\n\nAfter you checked the data, reboot, or set correctly your fstab.\nPlease give more info, for more help!\n\nA: When people use dd to backup an image of a partition, they often fail to backup the partition table as well. If you didn't, you can try creating partitions of similar sizes with fdisk and set the partition flags appropriately. Then dd them back and run whatever disk checking utility suits the partition in question from a bootable CD.\nSlightly more detailed:\n$ ls -l imagename #to get the size  \n$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdX  \n\nOptions:\n\n*\n\n*n: adds a new partition (follow the prompts, make a modestly larger partition and resize if the fix works).\n\n*t: sets the partition type in the partition table.\n\n*w: writes the changes to the disk.\n\n*m: lists options as the program informs you.\n\nThen run:\nsudo dd if=imagename of=/dev/sdXY\n\nRun the appropriate disk check utility after the dd restore is complete.\nThere are better ways to do this, they aren't horribly relevant and are overly complicated.\n", "Q: How can I check my RAM and hard drive for errors? What tools can I use to check that my memory and hard drive are still working correctly?\n\nA: For HDD, you can use badblocks program which is installed with the e2fsprogs program. It's a command-line program and a read-only scan can be performed with:\nsudo badblocks -v /dev/sda\n\n-v causes verbose information to be displayed, /dev/sda is the device name of the disk.\nFor RAM, you can find memtest86+ on any live CD or USB.

You can do this whether or not you have Ubuntu already installed.  \nIf you do have it installed, you can run memcheck from the grub menu.\n\nA: Boot with Ubuntu Live CD/USB stick (or press & hold Shift before the splash screen, to enter GRUB menu), and select TEST MEMORY with memtest86+! See this illustration, don't wait for graphical UI!\nIllustration:\n\nTo test HDD, you can use S.M.A.R.T. data reader, palimpsest disk utility, press Super/Dash button, start typing Disk Utility (for Gnome: System > Administration > Disk utility), and check your S.M.A.R.T. data (YOU MUST UNMOUNT THAT DISK FIRST, YOU WANT TO CHECK ITS FILESYSTEM - that's why, use a Live CD/USB stick - for S.M.A.R.T. reading, the disk could be mounted/used)!\nIllustration: \n", "Q: Why am I not able to buy applications?

Will it be possible?\n\nA: Unity 3D from 11.04 runs fine in Virtual Box >=4.0.6 as tested with NVidia proprietary graphics driver on the host. 3D support is activated by installation of Guest Additions.\n\nA: If all you want to do is experience it,rather than a Virtual machine, use the live CD\n\nA: A useful approach to testing the next releae, 11.04 is to create a live Ubuntu system on a USB memory stick from the daily builds:\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/\nUnity is not the default desktop environment yet, but is scheduled to be so by Alpha1 on the 2nd December as far as I understand the release schedule: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NattyReleaseSchedule\nAs well as testing Ubuntu a Live USB stick, you can also use that live USB stick to install Ubuntu 11.04 onto a second USB stick, selecting manual partition during the install.\nYou can also use TestDrive to automate testing when Ubuntu 11.04 Unity desktop does work in VirtualBox.\nThank you\nhttp://ubuntu.jr0cket.co.uk/testing\n", "Q: Where can I look up my update history?

Why is (was) there so much fuss about it?\nWhy is it under the 'Canonical Partners' section in the Software Center?\nShould I install it?\n\nA: You probably should not install this.\nIt is safe, and has a rather simple purpose.\nThe canonical-census package is meant to help them determine the number of installations on OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) systems.\nFrom what I have read about it, it may be used in the future to provide statistics to the community, but as of Maverick this has not been finalized (to my knowledge).\n\nA: \nWhat is the 'canonical-census' package?\n\nIt's for counting the number of installs of Ubuntu in the wild, put there by OEMs. OEMs (in this case) are companies selling computers with Ubuntu pre-installed. Like Dell, System76, etc.\nIt connects to a Canonical server on a daily basis and tells it the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*How many times it has connected in the past (/var/lib/send-install-count/counter)\n\n*The OEM's ID (stored in /var/lib/ubuntu_dist_channel)\n\n*The hardware product (/sys/class/dmi/id/product_name)\n\n*Which release of Ubuntu it's using (/etc/lsb-release's $DISTRIB_RELEASE)\n\n\nImplicitly it also tells Canonical which IP the computer is using and from that they could work out the country, sometimes company it's being used from. If they're doing this is another question.\n\nWhy is (was) there so much fuss about it?\n\nSome people see this as an attempt to track users. In a way it does. But how much of that information is helpful to actually work out who a user is?\nWell I'm a cynic. With the IP, Canonical could look at the other services they provide  (Ubuntu One, Launchpad, etc). If the users uses another service, they could perhaps work out who has done business with Dell (et al)...\nBut even cynical as I am, what does that really give them? Not much. Its only real value is working out how many OEM computers are get used with their default install of Ubuntu.\nI'm not going to get bogged down in the paranoia of some people but it's fair to say, all but the most cut-off hermits give out more personal, traceable and potentially harmful data to much bigger and uglier companies on a daily basis.\n\nWhy is it under the 'Canonical Partners' section in the Software Center?\n\nI don't know.\nIt doesn't really matter where it sits but the partner repo is as good as any other place, I guess. It's open source but it's not really something for all users.\n\nShould I install it?\n\nNo. You could but it won't do anything meaningful unless you bought the machine with that copy of Ubuntu pre-installed by a Canonical-registered OEM.\nThis is because it checks for the existence of /var/lib/ubuntu_dist_channel before submitting any data. Normal installs won't have this file.\n", "Q: Why does the \"Mouse\" preferences GUI not allow me to enable two-finger scrolling? I know that my touchpad is capable of it. I can enable glitch-free two-finger scrolling by running this script:\n#! /bin/sh\n\nsynclient VertTwoFingerScroll=1\nsynclient HorizTwoFingerScroll=1\nsynclient EmulateTwoFingerMinW=10\nsynclient EmulateTwoFingerMinZ=48\n\nHowever, in the \"Mouse\" preferences GUI, the \"two-finger scrolling\" option is greyed out. It worked fine on my old laptop.\nHere is the output of sudo lshw -sanitize, if it makes a difference.\n\nA: Press Alt+F2, write gconf-editor, it will open gconf-editor, go to destkop, gnome, peripherals, touchpad and type 2 for the variable \"scroll_method\". The option will stay grayed but two finger scroll will be enable. Works for me.\n\nA: This is my understanding of it. Ubuntu doesn't have support for the Synaptics touchpad officially out of the box, so what that script does is it emulates the multi-touch. I think. I don't know for sure, but that is my understanding of that. (I myself have a Synapatics trackpad on my Asus Eee PC, so I've spent a far amount of time working on this.)\n\nA: I don't have a laptop to test it with, but I recently stumbled upon this site: http://stuffivelearned.org/doku.php?id=os:linux:general:synapticstouchtricks\nPerhaps this helps you.\n", "Q: Close button on notify-osd? Is it possible to get a close button on the OSD? \nIt stays for a long time, and sometimes I have colleagues over on my PC, and I dont want them seeing who is online, or what song I am listening to. No, I can't disable it.\n\nA: There is a way you can get notifications with a close button.\n\nFrom Webupd8's Article\n\nFirst install  Avant Window Navigator\n  from the software center and add the\n  \"Notification Daemon\" to the dock.\nNow press Alt  + \n  F2 and paste gconf-editor\nThen navigate to apps >\n  awn-applet-notification-daemon (this\n  is for the latest AWN from the AWN\n  trunk PPA, it may be apps >\n  avant-window-navigator >\n  awn-applet-notification-daemon on\n  older versions of Avant Window\n  Navigator). Clicking a key will\n  display its description at the bottom\n  so you'll know how to tweak it. The\n  most important key is:\n  \"kill_standard_daemon\" - make sure\n  this is enabled or else the AWN\n  notifications won't work.\nFor instance, \"override_x\" is the\n  horizontal position on the screen (for\n  which I've used \"1900\" because my\n  screen width is 1920 and I want the\n  notifications to be displayed on the\n  right), \"override_y\" is the vertical\n  position (for which I've used \"30\" so\n  the notification dialog is displayed\n  in the top right corner) and\n  \"gradient_factor\" is the transparency.\n  That should be enough to get you\n  started.\nTo customize the colors, uncheck the\n  \"use_theme\" box, then specify a\n  \"text_colour\" and \"bg_colour\" and so\n  on.\nAn important feature you may want to\n  turn on is \"show_icon\". This will\n  display an icon on your Avant Window\n  Navigator dock which you can then\n  click to temporarily disable/enable\n  the notifications.\n\n\nA: The choice to have zero chrome on the ephemeral notifications is very deliberate and not going to change. The rationale is that these notifications should be as lightweight as possible.\nHowever, there are some things that could be done to help you further.\nThere is a spec to make the timing of the notification variable - longer messages would stay for a longer time, or updated messages would be extended. A patch implementing that would be welcome, it would allow us to shorten the time for very short messages :-)\nAlso, we would like to add a \"do not disturb\" mode, where only system (urgent) notifications, like battery very low and hardware problems, would show up. So you could use do-not-disturb to avoid people seeing your notifications when they are looking over your shoulder, or you are plugged in to the projector (though we'd rather put the notifications on your laptop screen and not on the projector, where they are different displays). Again, a patch for that would be welcome.\n\nA: Instead of using avant window navigator, you could also do this (only tested on Lucid):\nInstall xfce4-notifyd from the software center and press Alt + F2 and paste killall notify-osd\nThis switches to XFCE's notify daemon, which looks a lot like the default one, only a close button appears when you hover over it.\n\nA: I have read about this before and can understand the design reasoning but in practice they are distracting when they cannot be cleared easily. \nUsing https://launchpad.net/caffeine, a statusbar app which can prevent screen/power saving, will also disable the popups so I thought I would suggest this as a workaround.\nBlocking the notification does highlight the need for a notifications history but this has also been raised as an issue and resolved as wont fix: bugs.launchpad.net/notify-osd/+bug/382094\n\nA: Your best bet would be file a bug and ask for the feature. When filing a wishlist bug like this, be sure to give some thought out user cases why this feature could prove to be useful for a larger section of the Ubuntu user community.\n\nA: There isn't a close button, the blob isn't even there in terms on the mouse (when you click over it, it simply clicks what ever is behind it), see details here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotifyOSD\nThis functionality won't change, there have been several bug reports asking for what your asking for, all of which have been denied in the strongest of terms.\nYou could make a program to close it though, fork the osd code a bit and use some of the existing code branches which do this already. See the program D-Feet to browse and play with the dbus interface for notifyosd and the code on launchpad.\n\nA: Decrease the delay with notify-osd-conf app.\n\nA: Bookmark:  Close button on notify-osd?\nref:  \n\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/31617/89468\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/14356/89468\nConcepts presto proven, bash'd OSD pop-up graffiti \"disabled\" solution is conceived and hatched as:\ndbus-monitor \"interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications'\" |             \\\ngrep --line-buffered \"member=Notify\"                     |             \\\nsed -u -e  's/.*/killall notify-osd/g'                   |             \\\nbash\n\nThis can be run in a terminal or as a background task - stop it and pop-up graffiti resumes.  \nThe OP stated \"No, I can't disable it\". If by this it means that the notification system IS NOT to be disabled by the poser, then this solution is consistent with that. The system is intact. If it means the poser does not know how to do so, then again the solution is pertinent.\nDetails explained below line.\nThe ultimate would be to embed everything on (in?) the DBus, to directly invoke \n  qdbus    org.freedesktop.Notifications                \\\n          /org/freedesktop/Notifications                \\\n           org.freedesktop.Notifications.CloseNotification(uint id)\n\n\nA very, very, very naive rudimentary solution, that is more proof of concept than practical, essentially \"disables\" notify-osd (or at least its effects).  Don't forget to terminate it when done testing! by ETX'ng with <ctrl>-C or closing the terminal window etc. It does do its job but not very pragmatically! since unfortunately other jobs suffer trying to do theirs ...\n  while true; do killall notify-osd; done\n\n(to \"hear\" relevant activity you might want to \"grep out\"\n notify-osd: no process found ....\n\n)\nTest it by running it in a terminal window and from another terminal window try doing:\n  notify-send \"test 1\" \"now you see it not\"\n  notify-send \"test 2\" \"you see it not after test 1 evaporates\"\n  notify-send \"test 3\" \"finally after test 2 evaporates\"\n\nStop the first process and then try the messages again.\nPerhaps a notify-osd indicator for the unity-panel-service could invoke killall notify-osd.  The hot spotted close button wouldn't (& can not!)  be resident on the notification window but it would be available on the indicator panel.  This is completely analagous to the same concept that Unity has for windows.  The use of the top bar for notification closing is similar to the way Unity exiles window menus with close, mini, maxi boxes to the top menu bar.  \nA truly elegant solution would have the indicator appear when DBus activity for the notify-osd manifests and disappear when there are no pending notifications.  \nIt might also address the problem of stacked notifications - only one can be seen at a time and if multiple notifications are pending each one must evaporate before the next appears - they cannot usually be seen simultaneously.\nDBus-monitor'ng of the notify-osd notification interface will however provide immediate acknowledgement of pending notices even if there is one already showing. (AND if killall notify-osd is issued immediately - presto poof!)\nSelect All, Drag & Drop to a terminal window the following tests:\n  notify-send \"test 1\" \"now you see it\"\n  notify-send \"test 2\" \"you see it after test 1 evaporates\"\n  notify-send \"test 3\" \"finally after test 2 evaporates\"\n\nnow do the same with p{r}oof:\n  notify-send \"test 1\" \"now you don't\"\n  notify-send \"test 2\" \"you see it not! after test 1 evaporates\"\n  notify-send \"test 3\" \"NOT finally after test 2 evaporates\"\n  killall notify-osd\n  notify-send \"gonzo\" \"gone nada zip zilch\"\n\nThe killall notify-osd in the suggested solution would be triggered when DBus monitor detects OSD pop-up graffiti activity.\n\nA: Try this:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2012/06/closable-movable-notifyosd.html\nYou won't get a close button, but you'll be able to close the bubble  and adjust the time it is active.\n\nA: It was a deliberate decision to leave out any way to interact with the notification bubble (so its a passive notification), so you can post a bug report on Launchpad (there may be one already) and lobby for it to be changed.\nIts not something I can see happening soon unless there's major demand (and there isn't)\nIt might also be worth trying to tackle the issue by asking for a way to exclude certain programs from accessing the notify-osd system.\n\nA: A close button on the notifications themselves won't solve your problem. They will still see the notifications, and will have to click the close button to close them, if there were one.\nWhat you should do instead, is when you want to allow others to use your computer, simply choose the \"Switch User\" option in the system menu on the upper right (the gear icon), and use the Guest login. This will fabricate a temporary session for them to use, and will not preserve any browser history, cookies, etc… when that user logs out. This will keep them from seeing your notifications, as well as from possibly disturbing any of your own data (web history, downloads, logins, etc…), as they traverse the ether from your computer.\n", "Q: Is it safe to install LibreOffice alongside OpenOffice.org? I would like to try out LibreOffice, but I'm worried about messing up my existing OpenOffice.org install. Can LibreOffice be safely installed alongside OpenOffice.org?\n\nA: Yes absolutely.

But in 10.04, if I clicked another, Exaile would push it in my playlist and that file would be the next to play. However, now in 10.10, if Exaile is already open then it doesn't add the .mp3 once I double click on it and as a result I can't seem to progressively add more files to be played, so the playlist has to be created at once, which really doesn't suit my needs.\nAny way to fix this?

It's given in the following link:  \nhttp://bazaar.launchpad.net/~exaile-devel/exaile/0.3.2.x/revision/3436\nYou should just edit xldbus.py with your favorite editor:\nsudo gedit /usr/lib/exaile/xl/xldbus.py\nand make line 453:  \ntracks = trax.sort_tracks(['album', column], tracks,reverse=descending)\nSave, restart exaile and you're done ;-)\n", "Q: Mount an external drive at boot time only if it is plugged in I've got an entry for an external harddrive in my fstab:\nUUID=\"680C0FE30C0FAAE0\"    /jgdata     ntfs    noatime,rw\nBut sometimes this drive isn't plugged in at boot time. This leaves me half way through a boot, with a prompt to \"Continue Waiting, press S or press M\" but no keypress has any affect at this stage (including Ctrl-Alt-Delete, not even caps-lock).\nShort of writing a script to check the output of fdisk -l, how can I mount this drive at boot time only if it is present? It would be handy to have an fdisk entry for this drive, so I can just type mount /jgdata instead of needing a device name.\n\nA: I had the same issue - I've done one extra step\nIf you use the nofail option in /etc/fstab, the system will look for your disk (and partition) at boot time. If the device is plugged, the filesystem will be mounted. If not, the boot will continue as normal.\nSee arch wiki:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fstab\nExample\nUUID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX    /myhdd ntfs  auto,nofail,noatime,rw,user    0   0\n\nI've tried to boot the system with and without the device plugged, and it works ok.\nWhat I've not achieved is to automount when disk is plugged after boot (when isn't plugged at boot). I must use mount -a as root to mount all again. \n\nA: /dev/xvdh1 /myfs xfs defaults,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=30 0 0\n\nworked for me.\n\n*\n\n*nofail - Do not report errors for this device if it does not exist.\n\n*x-systemd.device-timeout=30 - Boot will take 30 seconds longer if device does not exist (default is 90 secs).\n\nSource: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/fstab#External_devices\n\nA: The recommended way to mount during the boot is instructing their system through the fstab file. Looking at your Ask, I could see you are almost there, lacks only the instruction that sets the device to use automount options, allowing your system to mount the device when its available.\nSo, just rewrite the line in your fstab to be like below:\n# <file system>           <dir>       <type>    <options>         <dump> <pass>\nUUID=\"680C0FE30C0FAAE0\"   /jgdata      ntfs      user,auto,rw       0     0\n\nAfter change and save it, try to mount it by hand: \n\n$ sudo mount -a\n\nIt's important to note that:\n\n\n*\n\n*you need to be sure about the device's UUID. UUIDs are generated by the make-filesystem utilities (mkfs.*) when you create a filesystem.\n\n*Those <options> needs to be written following a very specific format, separated by commas but no spaces after each comma. Be careful with this ;-)\n\n*I'm not sure if this will work smoothly because you are trying to automount a NTFS filesystem, that are handleable using NTFS-3G utilities. While my instructions are supposed to work correctly, I never tried automount NTFS before. So, if its failed, I recommend you to look at this Mounting Windows Partitions for alternative uses of NTFS.\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: does the noauto option let the boot process continue?  \nit doesn't automatically mount if present, but it does get it known if present so a simple mount /jgdata works...then a scripted mount /jdata wouldn't need an output check, just catch the error and keep booting  \nedit: upon some further reading bootwait is probably a more correct option to pass...(usually used for network shares that might not be present until later in the boot process, but it might still cause a hang, idk)  \nand the mount script could be added like so: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2062543/running-a-script-with-the-help-of-grub-and-menu-lst\n\nA: You're all on the right trail. I've found a way that is a little more  clean and better form.\nThe correct option to add in fstab is nofail, however, it needs to come after auto. If you change it to noauto, it will never mount during boot. If you add nobootwait to the bootloader, you could potentially miss something serious, such as mounting the partition before fsck finishes checking it, or not mounting a partition that is used in the boot process.\nAfter making the above change, The system will start normally (and mount the volume) if the device is plugged in while the system is shutdown.\nIt will also boot normally if the device is not present at boot time.\nThe only inconvenience is that if you connect the device while the system is running, depending on configuration (too many variables to test), the device may not mount immediately. This can be remedied with a simple mount -a or mount /specific_device or a reboot.\n", "Q: How to Setup FTP to use in locally hosted wordpress I have installed wordpress on my ubuntu 10.10 desktop edition and I am trying to install plugin from the browser (I know I can drop it to the wp-content/plugin but I want to do it via the web browser using FTP) I get  this screen when I am trying to set auto update or install a plugin from web browser.\n\nI provide the hostname 127.0.0.1\nand Username and password the ones that I use to login to wordpress.

The access to these servers is controlled by ssh keys. Managing these keys is quite a pain, especially when an employee leaves or joins the company.\nIs there a good solution for central key management on Ubuntu?\nAdam\n\nA: Landscape\nCanonical's Landscape makes it very easy to manage many machines at once.\nYou could just have a centralised key store and, on demand, push out changes to every machine's known_hosts file. \nRsync\nAlternatively, if you don't want to use Landscape, how about simply synchronising the known_hosts via rsync? I'm not all that familiar with all this enterprisy business, but it should work very well. \nAssuming the company's computers get shut down every night, i would do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have on some server a centralised known_hosts file that you manage manually.\n\n*write a very simple program that, at boot time, tries to fetch that file and replace the current one\n\n*on the administrative side, test all changed to the master-file before pushing it out, which you do by just replacing the one all the clients try to access. \n\n\nyou could use RCS, an old sysadmin's favourite, to manage different versions of your master-file. \nNote that many sysadmins will tell you that centralising things is a security risk, and generally not a great idea.\nLDAP\nNow, I'm not a sysadmin (and therefore not to be trusted on this matter). You really should ask this question on serverfault\nLDAP seems to come up there quite a lot. Here's a bit information about fetching SSH Public Keys from LDAP, and here's some more.\nThis question might also be of interest to you.\n\nI hope this is helpful. As you've discovered yourself, managing ssh access in large setups really is quite complicated. \n\nA: It is possible to use certification authorities and revoke markers in the \"known hosts\" file.  Another option is probably to use some \"enterprise\" PAM authentication method instead.\n", "Q: What software can I use to view epub documents? What software can I use to view .epub documents?\n\nA: I recommend fbreader.  Small, fast, single key page turning.  Quite pleasant.\nFBReader is a proprietary software, which can be downloaded from its website https://fbreader.org/ and in the Snap Store.\nFor an older free and open source version, use the command line to install FBreader:-\nsudo apt-get install fbreader\n\n\nA: I prefer Okular, a document viewer made for KDE. It has features including bookmarks and highlighting.\nIt's available in the main Ubuntu repository and can be installed on a plain vanilla Ubuntu installation; Kubuntu is not required.\nTo be able to open epubs with okular, you must also install the okular-extra-backends package.\nsudo apt-get install okular okular-extra-backends \n\n\nA: Coolreader 3 http://sourceforge.net/projects/crengine/ one or two pages, bookmarks, memory last reading pages, settings background, fonts, fonts color. Settings avilable only for root, but save for user. \nPPA https://launchpad.net/~vovansrnd/+archive/ubuntu/coolreader\nEditor fb2 http://fb2edit.lintest.ru \n\nA: Another useful option, try this in Firefox; https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/45281/, a fairly good extension for the Firefox web browser that lets you read .epubs from the browser, especially good since on Ubuntu you are likely to be using Firefox and it is usually kept open when you are using your computer.\n\nA: You can use calibre software for viewing .epub documents.\nTo install calibre from terminal:\nsudo apt-get install calibre\n\nOr click the icon below.\ncalibre \n\nIf you don't want to launch the full calibre client just to view your ebook files you can add a .desktop launcher to calibre's inbuilt ebook viewer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new .desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/calibre-ebook-viewer.desktop\n\n\n*Copy and paste the following passage into the file:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nIcon=calibre\nExec=ebook-viewer\nName=Calibre Ebook Viewer\nComment=Display .epub files and other ebook formats\nMimeType=application/x-mobipocket-ebook;application/epub+zip;\nStartupWMClass=calibre-ebook-viewer\n\n\n*Save the file. You should now be able to launch Calibre's inbuilt ebook viewer both from the dash and through the right click \"Open with\" menu.\n\nA: MuPDF can read epub files, and is only 3 MB.\nIt may be too minimalistic for some, but I loved it! Way faster than xpdf!\nsudo apt-get install mupdf\n\n\nA: Use Foliate, an epic epub reader. It support text to speech, on the fly translator, word meaning and Wikipedia search.\n\nYou can download deb file. Or install ppa on ubuntu 18.04+ via\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:apandada1/foliate\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install foliate\n\n\nA: lucidor at http://lucidor.org/lucidor/download.php does a decent job. I completely removed calibre from my system because it doesn't let me leave the books in my own directory structure. (Then spent hours moving the thousands of books into a directory structure I like by hand.) I couldn't find coolreader to try. Okular I like but the extensions did not work on epub for me. fbreader works but you have to open it up first and then the book whereas lucidor you can right click from the file manager to associate epubs to lucidor. \n\nA: Compared to Calibre and FBreader, I find Readium Chrome extension offers a much better user experience:\nReadium is written in javascript and looks much more modern. Hope it will help other Linux users.\n\nA: Another option may be Ebook-Viewer, a GTK ePub reader. But it seems to lack DRM support.\n\nA: nov.el is an excellent Emacs package that allows you to read EPUB files in Emacs.\nThere is also a corresponding Spacemacs layer which allows you use all the Evil (Vim) key bindings when reading.\n\nA: If you care about UI/UX kind of thing, I recommend Foliate. It's neat and crisp.\n\nA: To view an epeub ducument from terminal:\npandoc yourfile.epub | lynx --stdin\n\nYou should install lynx and pandoc.\n", "Q: Driver installation: compiling source code for newer kernel I am trying to install a driver for this DAQ card, but when I execute (as in given documentation):\ninsmod /usr/.../advdrv_core.ko\n\ni get this error:\ninvalid module format\n\nAs I found out, this is because downloaded driver is for kernel 2.6.18, so it will not work on new one, but there is also source code provided so is it possible to compile it for this kernel?\n\nA: If the kernel module is outdated (and doesn't work with the newest kernels) then just having the source code does not mean that you can just compile it. It would need to be modified at the source level to be made compatible with newer kernels.\nThe link you provided doesn't load for me, so I can't really say much about the company/etc., but I would suggest contacting who ever made the kernel module and requesting that they modify it to work with the newer kernels.\n", "Q: apt changelog for to-be installed packages GUI update-manager is able to show the \"changelog\" of packages to-be installed (not downloaded yet).\nI also found out how to provide the .changelog files in the right place for update-manager to show them, and now I'm happy since I'm able to tell my clients that they can see changelogs of my custom packages directly from their gui.\nUnfortunately I'm not able to find any command line tool to do the same thing and that would be more useful on servers.\nFrom what I saw it seems that this convention (putting .changelog files directly alongside the .deb files in the apt repo) is a ubuntu specific extension.\nThere are some debian resources (the reprepro man page for example) which point on a different way to store changelogs online, http://packages.debian.org/changelogs\nDoes anybody know if there already exists a tool like apt-cache to show the changelogs from packages which are not yet installed (nor downloaded) ?\n\nA: There is also the apt changelog command.

I can change the menu and dock icons easily enough, the one i want to change is the one that appears when the application runs, and appears in the notification area.  \nWhenever i run it at the minute, it reverts back to its old, low res icon.\n\nA: I don't think that you can change it, spotify really tries hard to be the less themeable as possible, something about brand management.\nIf you are a paying member, you can use the linux version. It has a decent resolution, grey notification icon that fits nicely with Ubuntu default themes. But they try to manage their own window, it has it's own title bar, buttons on the right and it doesn't bubble when you move it. You can force compiz to manage it, but then you have two sets of close, minimize and maximize buttons.\n", "Q: Breaking out to the terminal Every so often my laptop locks up with some rogue process taking up all the i/o or processor. I then spend ages fighting with the mouse to open up the Applications menu so I can open a terminal so I can diagnose the problem and kill the process.\nIs there a quicker way to break into the terminal?\n\nA: Javier's answer is imo the best, but I figured more info is never a bad thing.\nYou can also type alt+f2 to open a small prompt. From there you can open bash or some other desired program.\n\nA: If your system is utterly unresponsive, you can press Alt+SysRq+K (the sysrq key should be the same as the Print key) to Kill the X display server and all its child processes. \nThis will throw you back to the GDM login screen, killing all applications currently running on TTY7, which is the one where X is running.\n→ More information on Magic SysRq Keys at Wikipedia.\nOf course you will lose all unsaved data, and you won't know what process went awry, but it will respond even if some process prohibits you from doing everything else, the magic sysqr keys have highest priority.\nIf your system is still responsive enough to do what Javier Rivera suggested, this is obviously preferable. Type in ps aux on the command prompt you'll get through Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get a dump of all the processes currently running. You can use Shift+Page Up to scroll though lengthy output.\n\nA: guake \ncan be opened with F12 and does a very good job even if your system is overloaded! It's a quake-style terminal.\n\nA: CTRL+ALT+F1 should give you a terminal where yon can log in to diagnose the problem. You can press CTRL+ALT+F7 (sometimes F8) to return to the GUI.\nThere are additional terminals in CTRL+ALT+F2, F3, etc...\nI also find very useful to map CTRL+ESC to the system monitor, where I can kill a process quickly.\nAs SW01 said, you can also type ALT+F2 to execute one command. This will only work if gnome-panel is enabled (it works by default).\nAnd fred.bear added than CTRL+ALT+T will open a new window with the default terminal.\n\nA: The default keymapping for the default X terminal is  Ctrl+Alt+T\n\nA: Htop shows the top cpu users and allows you to kill a process without shutting down the entire system.\n", "Q: make my ssh key expire automatically I sometimes use ssh to connect to a remote machine.  Once I enter the passphrase once, I can use ssh again without the passphrase, but even if I come back a long time later, it still doesn't ask me, because the key is cached.  I can do ssh-add -D to remove the key from the cache, but I want that to happen automatically after, say, 1 hour.  How can I do that?\n\nA: The program that caches your ssh keys is the ssh-agent program, if you look at the man page you can see this relivent option:\n-t life  Set a default value for the maximum lifetime of identities added\n         to the agent.  The lifetime may be specified in seconds or in a\n         time format specified in sshd_config(5).  A lifetime specified\n         for an identity with ssh-add(1) overrides this value.  Without\n         this option the default maximum lifetime is forever.\n\nYou can edit the ssh-agent program in your startup programs. Go to System > Preferences > Startup Programs, look for the SSH Key Agent and append -t 3600 to the comman. This will expire your keys in one hour.\n\nYou will need to restart your session (log out and back in) for it to take effect. You can also do a similar thing for your gpg key which also can be set in an agent program which can be launched the same way (but isn't installed by default) just in case you get sick of typing in your gpg pass-phrase for package building or emailing.\n\nA: Unfortunately the selected answer doesn't seem valid (anymore): the GNOME Keyring doesn't honor the lifetime option due to bug 525574. A workaround is for example to disable GNOME Keyring for SSH keys, but then you'd have to manually ssh-add -t 60m the key upon use (or script that).\n\nA: You can add a cron job for that.\n", "Q: Acer Aspire One AOA110 randomly hard blocks WLAN0 - How to stop it My Aspire One netbook is now a notbook.  \nIt's an AOA-110 that has worked fine forever and a day (currently with Maverick UNR, fully updated).  Last night, I was ereading and went to go online to look something up.  I notice that not only am I not connected, but my AP is not even visible.\nOkay.  Research time.\nI find out about RFKILL.  It is showing a hard block on the ATH5K device.  The switch is NOT flipped.\nAmong other things, I have tried remapping the switch and the steps listed in #49 here.\nUnfortunately, between this, the current UDEV worker error, the fullscreen Flash video error, and apparently narrowly avoiding the devkit SSD issue, and the perennial lack of progress on Launchpad (as well as two weird errors on two Wubi installs done to make converts), I am losing all faith in Ubuntu.\nIn addition, even when a hard block seems to be missing, neither Network Manager nor Wicd seem to see the AP I know is there and in range.  iwlist scan shows no results, and iwconfig shows the WLAN0 interface.\nEnough discussing, on to questioning.\nHow can I fix this?  Secondly, any ideas on why this is happening?\nI am desperately fighting a complete reinstall.  Any help out there?  \n\nA: Firstly, ensure you're using the most current bios.  Secondly, I'm presuming you've set rfkill to soft-unblock the device.  Thirdly, I'm presuming you've purged hal from your system (which would be the default state if you did a fresh install of Lucid or Maverick).  Fourthly, have you filed a bug against the linux source package with ubuntu-bug linux ?\n\nA: It still seems to be working, so I will close this and let people get on with the more urgent questions.\n", "Q: How to make scp to use ipv6 addresses? When I try to use scp over IPv6 addresses I get this:\nscp -6 osis@::1:/home/osis/test.file ./test.file\nssh: Could not resolve hostname : Name or service not known\n\nWith scp all I ever get is \nssh: Could not resolve hostname : Name or service not known\n\nusing this I get a login into my box without a hitch\nssh osis@::1\n\n\nA: scp requires some special syntax. The IPv6 address must be enclosed in brackets, which must then be escaped. So in your example it would look like this:\nscp -6 osis@\\[2001:db8:0:1\\]:/home/osis/test.file ./test.file\n\nOtherwise the first colon ':' is thought to be the separator between the file and the address parts which would result in \nssh: Could not resolve hostname 2001: Address family for hostname not supported\n\nIn your example with the ip ::1 it is interpreted as if you want to ssh to the host '' (blank).\n\nA: The above command didn't work for me, the error I got was due to v6 address was allowed taking for path.\nNo need to use back slash \"\\\" . As per the above example below command will work.\nscp -6 osis@[2001:db8:0:1]:/home/osis/test.file ./test.file\n\n", "Q: External USB drive won't stop after shutdown After shutdown I notice that both the USB hub and the external USB drive remain active (lights on): the next time I try to boot the system hang after grub and I have to do a hard reboot. After that the system boots fine, until the next shutdown/boot cycle.\nIdeas on how to troubleshoot/resolve the issue?\nEDIT: The USB hard drive is powered by an adapter, while the hub is self powered; it's a dual-boot machine, with Windows XP on another partition and with Win there's no such a problem.\nEDIT #2: It's a PC, and the USB devices remain active after the PC's shtudown: I mean, when the pc is completely off, not standby, not hibernated and not suspended. After that the CPU, PSU, GPU and the various fans are completely quiet.\nEDIT #3: The problem occurs also if a SD card is in the reader at boot time.\n\nA: Also, I re-read again before posting, and I think I mis-interpereted your question. By \nafter shutdown, do you mean after the PC shuts down, or the process of shutting down, before the PC turns itself off?\n\nI am assuming you have a PC, not a laptop. When you shut down your PC, there s still some power flowing through the SMPS (also called the PSU). Thats the reason you can see the hub lit. As for the HDD, it might be connected to the same spike-strip/board as the PSU. After you shut-down the PC, turn off the wall socket too, and see if that works.\n\nA: It's not possible. \nHere's why: Because your drive is set to run as long as it has power. There is no way to change that, it's hardware level.\nSo, the only way to make it stop that is to unplug it. \nApologies if that wasn't what you wanted to hear, but it's the truth as far as I've been able to figure out. \n\nA: \nthe next time I try to boot the system hang after grub and I have to do a hard reboot\n\nThis may be silly ...any chance it's a grub issue?\nif it's a really really really OLD version of grub, maybe. \nlook in /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nDo you see UUIDs being used? stuff like:\nlinux   /vmlinuz-2.6.38-8-server root=UUID=b55fdc69-d2fb-4896-89cc-65031a0bcf9f\n\nor do you see something like\nlinux /vmlinuz-2.6.38-8-server /dev/sda1\n\nif it's the former, nevermind ignore this post ;)\nif it's the latter, then well you might want to edit those /dev/sdXY pointers to UUIDs, because the USB device might be taking over that device name (which is possible with today's BIOSes)\n", "Q: Will the new Unity support dual monitors better then what Gnome 2.X does? Gnome 2.x always messes up my icons in the notification area and stuff when using dual monitor. I was wondering if the new unity will work better?\n\nA: As covered here, multi-monitor support for Unity in 11.04 is being treated with high importance.\n\nA: The issue you're seeing with “messed up icons” is probably this bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/44082\nYes, that will be fixed in Unity because it won't be using Gnome Panel. Instead, the bar at the top is more rigidly defined. Stuff that is meant to be at the right side will always be at the right side.\nYou will see this fixed in Gnome Shell, too, for the same reason.\n", "Q: Different locations for MySQL databases? Can I configure MySQL to store a specific database in a separate place on disk?\nI still want any new databases to go to the default location, but there's a specific database that I'd like to have stored in my Dropbox folder so that it can stay synced between a few computers.  \nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Please bear in mind that if you are using Ubuntu, you need also to add an entry in the AppArmour configuration file /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld otherwise you will keep getting writing permission errors even though you change files and folder permissions.\n\nA: Of course you can! You have to grant root permisson. Read the ln manual pages.\nMySQL stores the database data in separated dirs in /var/lib/mysql. I think, at first you had to make a dir, where you want to put the selected database's files.\nGrant root permisson, stop MySQL deamon:\n# /etc/init.d/mysql stop\n\nCopy your data to your new folder:\n# cp /var/lib/mysql/DATABASENAME /path/to/new/database/dir\n\nRemove your old dir from MySQL data files: (Warning! ALWAYS make SQL dump first!!!)\n# rm -R /var/lib/mysql/DATABASENAME\n\nMake a symlink back to MySQL data dir: (Pay attention! Read the man page of ln first!!!)\n# ln -s /full/path/to/new/database/dir /var/lib/mysql/DATABASENAME\n\nAfter it, you are ready, start your MySQL:\n# /etc/init.d/mysql start\n\nWarning! If your new dir isn't write- and readable by MySQL that wouldn't work!\nExample, the common problem: you place your new data dir to your home folder, your home folder is read protected by others(ex: drwxrwx--- you you yourdir).\nAsk, if you want to know other things about that method!\n", "Q: Indicator Applet Session Log Out Dialog I'm trying to create a user profile for 10.10 and my last step is to create a log out button for the desktop.  I managed to find a simple command for a launcher to execute the log out prompt.  Unfortunately, along with an option to log out, there is also an option to switch user.  For my purposes, giving an option to switch the user is not desired. I have tried everything possible to disable user switching but it does not seem to effect the ability to click the switch user option in the log out dialog box.  \nWhat I would really like to use is the log out option that the Indicator Applet Session uses.  Clicking log out from the applet does not give the option to switch user.  Is there any way to take whatever command the applet is using and create a launcher for the desktop?\n\nA: The exact dialog Indicator Session uses\nis this: /usr/lib/indicator-session/gtk-logout-helper\nSo you can simply add a custom launcher to your panel like so:  \n\n\n", "Q: b43 vs linux STA Which driver is better ?\n i've been using STA , but now i switched to b43 and i think b43 is better in performance than STA .\n\nA: I think it's depends on your WLAN type.\nIn my case b43 works better.\n\nA: for supported broadcom chipsets the b43 binary packages almost always work better.  hopefully we can look forward to better open source drivers eventually (like the change from madwifi to ath5k/ath9k).  just my 2 cents...broadcom has been a thorn in the side of linux for some time.  i remember having to use ndis-wrapper to get any amount of stability out of broadcom.\n", "Q: How to add a hyperlink to an action button? How to add a hyper-link to an action button in Open Office.org Presentation? \n\nA: This is  from Oracle's OpenOffice Help TNT blog:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click the new push button and    choose Control from the context menu.\nThis opens one of the two main\nproperties windows.\n\n*Right click the Action list button    and select \"Open document/web page\"\nfrom the list.\n\n*The URL text field is now enabled.

If you want to link to a web page, enter the url in the \"URL\" field, right below where you selected the action.\nNow you've got to leave design mode (button in the form controls toolbar) for the button to work.\n", "Q: Grouping folders in Gnome I wonder if it is possible to make Nautilus grouping files and folders as Windows do. This is the only thing I don't like in Ubuntu interface. In Windows in every folder my files are always separated to last edited groups: today, yesterday, this week etc. In Ubuntu, say, in Downloads, I hardly able to find what was downloaded 5 seconds ago. Any tweaks/software to implement this? I'm using 10.10.\n\nA: This is exactly what the Zeitgeist project aims to provide users with. You can download and get the latest version of Zeitgeist and the browser which will not only show you what you last worked on / downloaded but lots of other cool stuff.\nZeigeist is being worked into the unity interface for 11.04 in the places menu, so you'll only need to go there to see recent downloads sorted by date and categorised by time period.\n\n\nA: As Martin Owens has said, Zeitgeist is a new technology to implement this kind of functionality. It is integrated into the Unity file browser but as far as I know, there is no way currently to add this functionality to Nautilus. However, there is a graphical front end to Zeitgeist called GNOME Activity Journal  which may be of use to you. It provides chronological access to your files. It also has search and contextual grouping of files.\nsudo apt-get install gnome-activity-journal\n\n\n\nA: This may not be an exact answer. But for grouping files and folders like windows explorer, you can use Dolphin. To install dolphin type\n\"sudo apt-get install dolphin\"\nin terminal.

I have a USB all setup but for the life of me can't get it to boot from USB! I've looked online and can't seem to find the motherboard details anywhere to access the BIOS and more applications won't work on Windows CE so I'm stuck. Is there an obscure Windows CE installer out there? It's really frustrating when I can't get to the BIOS - and I don't have a manual.\nIf anyone knows anything I'd appreciate it!\n\nA: There is no BIOS on that machine because it's not an IBM compatible PC. It's an ARM device. Even if you could get the usb to boot, the PC versions of Ubuntu (i386 and x64) wouldn't work because the chip is completely different. You'll need an arm build, which luckily for you is almost done:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/OMAP\nUnfortunately, the process for creating an image is very specific to each piece of hardware and unless your a programmer it might be a case of waiting until someone makes an image you can install.\n\nA: As Martin already pointed out, EzBookPc is based on an ARM Processor. Therefore it's a prerequisite to install a special Release for ARM processors. AFAIK there is no guide on how to install this on an EZBook PC. I think this is a very challenging and interesting but not easy task. Another point to start from when it comes to distributions for ARM processors may be Anytux.org. Good look :)\n\nA: Although you cannot run Ubuntu on the device you can actually Install an alternative operating system. \nThings Needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*EZBook PC\n\n*2GB (or more) SD Card\n\n*5 Minutes of time\n\n\nYou can install Android 1.6 (Donut) on the ezbook by following these instructions.\nFirst Download this file --> script.zip\nAfter you download the android installer script you will need to unzip it.\nOnce unzipped go into the folder. Inside you will see a second folder called script. Copy this folder to the root of your SD card Note: You need to actually copy the second folder \"script\" to the root directory not it's contents\nOnce copied insert the SD card into the EZBook PC (Make sure the EZBook is off)\nTurn on the EZBook\nYou will see a screen that says preparing upgrade. It will re-format the internal drive and partition it for android. Once the process is finished you will be prompted to remove the SD card. Remove the SD card and wait for the unit to shut down.\nOnce the unit shuts down completely turn it back on and enjoy your new android Operating system!\n\nA: I don't know about this netbook specifically, but there are a lot of 7 inch mini laptop clones. It depends on the CPU if it can run ubuntu. The VIA VT8500 based ones can run a version of Debian, so you should be able to upgrade them to ubuntu. If the CPU is a VIA WM8505 however, only an Android version is known to work (gives DMA errors with regular Linux).\nHere is a very helpful (yet overly lengthy) discussion on the Ubuntu forums:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1349626 \nVT8500 EasyPC Linux: http://bento-linux.org/wiki/vt8500-easypc-linux\nWM8505 Android: http://devio.us/~nextvolume/via_arm/viewtopic.php?id=4&t_id=40\nCuriously however I've just discovered some other WinCE 6.0 netbooks advertised with Ubuntu support.

(Not used it since, because WinCE and its MSIE are.. Words cannot explain it.)\n", "Q: How to program for Windows in Ubuntu? Is there anyway to create (C++ or C#) windows console applications inside Ubuntu's IDE (e.g Anjuta) and compile it for Windows?\n\nA: The other answers are correct for C/C++ code; you'll need to get a cross-compiler.\nFor C# code, you can just use Monodevelop , as Mono's compiler produces the same type of bytecode and executable format as the .NET compiler (and visa versa).  Apps you build with Mono will run unmodified on Windows machines as long as you stay within the standard .NET Base Class Libraries or bundle any extra library you use with your app.\n\nA: Might want to give Qt with Qt Creator a try. Great framework for GUI and Console application you can the compile for Windows, Linux and OS X.\nhttp://qt.nokia.com/\n\nA: You want to do cross-compiling, which is a way to compile code for platforms other than the one your on, especially when the processor is completely different. Basically you need to install all the headers for your target (i.e. windows) and then tell the compiler it's cross-compiling so it won't do some of the system checks and instead will point to non-standard directories.\nDepending on the language you might find it useful to do a search or question specifically, or if you're doing basic c you can use MinGW tools and the same sort of linux based compile tools that use gcc:\nsudo apt-get install gcc-mingw32\nThere is a good guide for qt/win32 cross compiling using MinGW tools.\n\nA: The most common way to program windows application linux (ubuntu) is using the mingw tools: \nhttp://www.mingw.org/\nThere are ubuntu packages for mingw ready to install.\n\nA: From this page:\nsudo apt-get install wine mingw32 mingw32-binutils mingw32-runtime\n\nThis is all that is needed for basic cross-compilation. Let's try:\n#include <windows.h>\n\nint APIENTRY WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,\n    LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)\n{\n  MessageBox(NULL,\n    \"Cette fenêtre prouve que le cross-compilateur est fonctionnel !\",\n    \"Hello World\", MB_OK);\n  return 0;\n}\n\nCompile this using:\ni586-mingw32msvc-g++ -o essai.exe essai.cpp\n\nTo execute, you need the mingw library: mingwm10.dll:\ngunzip -c /usr/share/doc/mingw32-runtime/mingwm10.dll.gz > mingwm10.dll\n\nThen you can launch it:\nwine essai.exe\n\nThe text of the dialog box is in French language with an accent, to do it with gvim, convert the source to windows code page 1252: <ESC>:e ++enc=cp1252\nAnother solution, more powerful is to use UTF-8 but this requires changing the way strings are handled.\n\nA: You should have a look at MingW. It provides a gcc-compatible compiler for windows.\nThere is a cross-platform version that you can use from Linux, to generate Windows binaries. You can install it with synaptic, or by running: \nsudo apt-get install gcc-mingw32\nBased on that, and with using the usual 'make' command, you can create programs for windows.\nThen any IDE that allows you to use make and gcc can use this compiler.\n For instance, here is how to do that from the Code::Blocks IDE. \n", "Q: How do I blacklist certain directories in Samba? I am exporting a directory via Samba to my home theater PC.

Under the particular share /var/test, the following setting will exclude any descendant sub-directory or file matching foo or *bar* (beware, / means OR):\n[myshare]\n  path = /var/test\n  veto files = /foo/*bar*/\n\nThen, you need to restart Samba with stop and start (not reload):\nsudo /etc/init.d/samba stop\nsudo /etc/init.d/samba start\n\nNote: Shares created through Nautilus GUI are defined in individual files in /var/lib/samba/usershare but veto files can't be applied there. If it's your case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Either add veto files to the [global] section of /var/lib/samba/usershare.

I want to be able to play the music from that partition instead of having to copy it into a folder in wine's virtual C drive.\n\nA: From inside Winamp and other applications running within Wine then you should be able to navigate to the 'Z' drive to access your Ubuntu filesystem.\n\nA: You can do what fluteflute said, or put a link into your ~/Music folder or wine C:\\ drive (type ln -s /path/to/partition ~/.wine/pathtocdrive in a terminal and press enter).\n", "Q: How to Remove shortcut arrow from desktop icons? How do I turn off the arrow for desktop icons?\n\nA: It is kind of hackish, but you could rename all the emblem-symbolic-link.png and\nemblem-symbolic-link.svg icons to something else like emblem-symbolic-link.png.bak and  emblem-symbolic-link.svg.bak respectively. Use locate emblem-symbolic-link to find where they are.\nBut is there any reason you need to use a symlink?\nOtherwise you could use a Launcher.

It can be an actual display session, or some kind of emulated display that the application could output to. The important is that I can start it from a command-line-only Putty window, and that it won't stop when I log off.\nI read that xvnc might do the trick, but I didn't get how to do it.\nWas I clear enough?\n\nA: I recommend xvfb-run which will fake an X server for the program you want to run:\nnohup xvfb-run -a PROGRAM &\n\n", "Q: My 'Sync Preferences' are not being saved when I disconnect my Android smartphone from Banshee When I set up my sync preferences for my Android phone, everything works fine and my media is successfully transferred, but when I unplug the phone (after pressing the eject button and being told it is now safe to remove the device) and plug it back in again, the sync settings have been reset and I need to reselect all my playlists again.

After manually killing the process things seem to return to normal. I'm unsure at this point if there's a problem with the \"SkyRocket\" screensaver specifically, or something else.\n", "Q: Any way to change the tooltip duration? There seems to be no option available for changing the tooltip duration. Is there any way to do so?\n\nA: If you are running compiz, this is a rather easy change to do. First you need to install Compizconfig Settings Manager.\nIt will appear in your preferences menu.\nNow, what you want to change is in the animations plugin. Choose close animation and add a new value, with fade as the animation (and type=Tooltip for window match), and add change the duration of it and then change the values as you wish (they are in milliseconds). They get applied automatically.\nWith a little tweaking, you can have tooltips that appear to last on screen for a very long period of time, or tooltips that immediately disappear once you move the mouse away. The major drawback is that with this method, your tooltips will fade in some way. You could make them last even longer by adding an open animation with similar options.\n\n\nA: I haven't tested it, but something like this should work:\nEdit your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 and insert \ngtk-tooltip-timeout = 300\n\nYou will need to restart apps to make them see it.\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://arch-stuff.org/content/show.php/Moomex-Ultimatum?content=77747&PHPSESSID=ueipzmmcni\n\n*http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/GtkSettings.html#GtkSettings--gtk-tooltip-browse-mode-timeout\n\nA: In my case it is unclutter that is causing the tooltips to disappear after less than 1s -- you can edit /etc/default/unclutter to modify the timeout or disable it (system-wide), but I found that adding the -grab option avoids the tooltip disappearing while still hiding the cursor like before:\n...\n# Options passed to unclutter, see 'man unclutter' for details.\nEXTRA_OPTS=\"-idle 1 -root -grab\"\n\nOne side-effect I noticed so far is that touchpad scrolling won't work until you move the pointer slightly to make it re-apper.  A click sometimes needs two attempts as the initial click only serves to re-show the pointer and only the second event is sent to the apps.  This kind-of makes sense but it would have been better if this was the case only after 10-15 seconds.\nGnome / gtk in itself, as far as I was able to investigate, has no setting for tooltip duration because the tooltips are not supposed to disappear in the first place.\nThe compiz fade-out duration hack works for only up to 4s and is annoying in that the tooltip will fade out slowly even when you now want to see a different tooltip.  (I'm not allowed to comment on other replies)\nAs for the gtk-tooltip-timeout setting, apart from having been deprecated without replacement, it was for setting the time before a tooltip appears, not its duration.\n", "Q: Purisa font renders strange symbol instead of TM I use the Purisa Medium font in various appearance settings, it's wonderful. However, whenever I type the characters T and M next to each other, they mysteriously change into a face-like character that I have never seen elsewhere. Sadly, askubuntu doesn't allow me to post an image, but the same issue was reported here, with images: http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?id=344298\nAny ideas would be much appreciated!\n\nA: A font can contain tables which instruct it to replace certain combinations of characters with a glyph that represents them written together as a ligature. You won't come across it that often, and might not have noticed when you have. The image below is an example of this with the Tekton Pro font with the letters \"ff\" together and separated by a space. Note the ff is a glyph with one continuous line. If it were two normal f glyphs, that line would be staggered.\n\nFor some reason the Purisa font has such a substitution for \"TM\", replacing it with an entirely different glyph. This may be a designer's signature or some such whim. As it is primarily designed for writing Thai, perhaps TM wasn't thought a likely combination for someone to want to type.\nThis is a version of the font that I have edited in fontforge, and removed the instruction to substitute TM. You could use this to replace /usr/share/fonts/truetype/thai/purissa.ttf as a quick fix (after replacing the file you need to run fc-cache -r and might need to log out if you are using it as a system font).

(not lag?) After moving to Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Edition, I've noticed a strange problem that manifests itself most obviously with streaming videos like youtube and hulu.  The video will load and begin playing fine and eventually stop, as though it is buffering.  However, it usually happens between 40 and 60 seconds into the clip.  The loading indication however shows that it actually isn't buffering anymore of the data, and will just sit there.  If I force the clip forward (e.g. click to start the movie somewhere ahead of the stall point) the clip will usually reload  quickly and begin playing as expected.\nBecause of the quick load times, and the consistent stop of video, I don't think the problem is related to hardware performance or network throughput.  Also, I have none of these problems in 10.04.  Rebooting into 10.04 makes the problem disappear.\nHowever, one more clue, I also have noticed a higher occurrence of web pages that simply \"stop loading\" - say, 1/10 clicks while browsing I have to hit \"reload\" to get the page to load because the page timed out part of the way through. This seems strangely related to the video problem, though is a lot less infuriating.\nHelp! Where do I begin to look with a problem like this?\n\nA: Delete the ~/.macromedia folder and restart the browser. If you play flash games online, most likely you will lose your scores. So back it up if you need them.\n\nA: Have a look at this link. This may solve your problem.\nhttp://www.techdrivein.com/2010/11/fix-youtube-video-freeze-while-in-full.html\n", "Q: Any way to clean up the look of the shutdown/logout/restart process? So, I've given up trying to configure my system (ubuntu 10.10, open source ATI drivers) to shutdown/logout/restart gracefully.  Whenever I do any of the three, all I get is an ugly ubuntu logo with console text running over it.  It does shutdown quickly, and I love that.  It just looks awful while it does it.\nIs there a way to just have nothing displayed when I click shutdown/logout/restart?  For example, is there a command that can disable the screen that I can put somewhere in some configuration file that will be the absolute first thing that is executed when I select shutdown/logout/restart?  I know of the xset dpms force off command which does turn the display off, but moving the mouse at all or pressing any key will turn it back on again.  \nIs there a command that can disable the screen and disable any input that I can place somewhere that will be the first thing that is executed when I select shutdown/logout/restart?\n\nA: ok to clarify that, when you startup (from power off or restart), is the splash screen in your native resolution?\nAlso, do you have any new/mainline kernels installed? I mean those that are NOT rolled out as part of ubuntu update.\nI use the proprietary nvidia drivers and that messed my start and shutdown screens. I did find a workaround so that the screen now just works like the one with the open source nouveau drivers. Keen on that? Involved editing some grub header files.\n\nA: Okay, I don't see a reply button to anyone's comments above so I guess I'll just have to post this here:\n@aking1012:  I put the information you requested here.  Again, I'm only using the default ubuntu drivers (though, I did try the proprietary drivers earlier to try and resolve the issue but it changed nothing).\n@Eshwar:  It is not a resolution problem.  The bootup splash is fine, displays in the correct resolution and does not display any terminal text.  The shutdown/logout/restart text is also in the correct resolution.  Also, I only have the kernels that ubuntu provides through regular updates.\n@Fraekkert:  Thank you, but that is the complete opposite of the solution I'm looking for.  Getting rid of Plymouth would give me a verbose bootup, as well as, shutdown/logout/restart.  Terminal text is what I'm trying to avoid.\n\nA: I guess you could try to disable Plymouth, or to change the theme. There's an easy tool for that here.\n", "Q: Remote Desktop Viewer doesn't update the image I am trying to use the Remote Desktop Viewer on my laptop to connect to my desktop, which I have configured with Remote Desktop preferences. But it fails to update the screen shot image, making it useless.\nWhat can I do to speed it up and actually have usable Remote Desktop?\nAny applications I can install on either/both sides to do it?\n\nA: Sounds like you have compiz enabled on your desktop which is what's causing the lack of screen refresh. There's an option you can enable on the server side (in your case the desktop) - that is, the machine you wish to control, which will fix this.\nALT+F2 -> gconf-editor -> Run\nNavigate to /desktop/gnome/remote_access\nTick the box next to disable_xdamage\nReconnect to the desktop via VNC and it should refresh the screen fine.\n\n\nA: You can try changing the client and the server for a better experience. As far as as client is concerned, the remmina client is a much better performer than vinagre and if you are use facing problems with vino then try tightvncserver. Both Are available via synaptic or USC.\n\nA: I personally prefer Team viewer,it's a computer software package for remote control, desktop sharing, and file transfer between computers. The software operates with  Microsoft Windows,Linux based OS & Mac OS X, and is able to function while the computers are protected by firewalls and NAT proxy....\nInstalling Team viewer:\nFor Ubuntu,you can download teamviewer here.\nOnce downloading is completed, you can install it easily by double clicking the file.After installation you can find team viwer under the Internet Menu.\nOpen the Team Viwer:\nApplications -- >>Internet -->> Team Viwer\n\nBefore establishing the remote desktop connection,you must know the ID and Password of the remote system which is running Team Viwer.After getting the ID and Password from your partner.Enter the ID and click connect to partner, with in few seconds it will show a window prompting  for a password.Enter the password which you got from your partner and click ok.\nNow you are connected to remote sytem.\n\nA: If you have good internet connectivity there are lot of applications you can use. Some of my favorites are:\n1). teamviewer: TeamViewer connects to any PC or server around the world within a few seconds It supports linux,mac,windows and iphone. So you can access linux desktop from windows and vice versa.\n2). Skype: Nowadays skype also started to provide screen sharing. skype also supports multiplatform\n3). empathy: The default chat client in ubuntu. \n[UPDATE]: Empathy and Skype are available at software center.\n\nA: for 12.04 it's now in dconf-editor->desktop->gnome->remote-access->disable-xdamage\n\nA: Unfortunately this no longer works in ubuntu 12.04  The specified option is no longer available in gconf-editor.\n", "Q: How to reset the terminal properties and preferences? I fooled around with the colors and stuff, in the terminal, and now want to go back to the maroon and white default config of the the terminal. What files do I have to delete?\n\nA: In order to reset terminal , one must understand first what part you want to reset exactly - do you want to reset graphical looks ? do you want to reset the shell ? \nFirst of all, default terminal in Ubuntu is gnome-terminal so for 99% of new users, I assume you're using gnome-terminal. Advanced users, who use something other than gnome-terminal will have to refer to manuals of their respective terminal emulators. \nResetting  gnome-terminal GUI preferences to default\nIn order to reset gnome-terminal it is sufficient to do  this:\ndconf reset -f /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/ \n\nAlternatively, you could use GUI tool called dconf-editor.\nNOTE: Multiple answers here suggest gconftool-2.   However, GConf \n\n. . .was deprecated as part of the GNOME 3 transition. Migration to its replacement, GSettings and dconf, is ongoing (source) \n\nResetting shell\nIt is a frequent question by users that they have something with their shell, and now the text in terminal looks different or they see an error. Simple, quick and dirty way is to get rid of old ~/.bashrc file and replace it with default one, stored in /usr/share/base-files/dot.bashrc\nYou can do so via terminal or via GUI - doesn't matter. Via terminal, you'd do cat /usr/share/base-files/dot.bashrc > ~/.bashrc and via GUI - delete old file, copy /usr/share/base-files/dot.bashrc from file manager to your home folder and rename as .bashrc\nGnome Terminal doesn't open\nSo you have changed some setting and now gnome-terminal doesn't work. Great, what now ? Luckly, there's couple of ways to get around this. \nOne, start xterm.  By default, Ubuntu comes with two terminal emulators. xterm is the original terminal emulator for X11 GUI and has been around since long ago, when dinosaurs of Unix systems roamed the earth.  You can use it to call the dconf command mentioned above, as well as reset your ~/.bashrc config file. \nAnother approach, would be use dconf-editor tool, again mentioned above. If you don't have it installed - use Software Center to get it.\nFinally, you can always purge and reinstall the terminal. Purging the gnome-terminal means any config files associated with it will be removed and it will be installed from scratch. The command to do so is sudo apt-get remove --purge gnome-terminal and then sudo apt-get install gnome-terminal. This can be done via xterm or TTY  (Ctrl+Alt+F[1-6]) \nI did something to my prompt , I want it to look like user@hostname:~$ again.\nHere's the thing: the prompt has two static parts username@hostname: and $. The one in the middle, ~, means your current working directory. Just like in file manager, when you jump to different directories, the terminal will display the directory in which you're working right now. So for example:\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ cd /etc\nxieerqi@eagle:/etc$ cd /home/$USER/Desktop\nxieerqi@eagle:~/Desktop$ \n\nIf you want to see ~ again, all you have to do is jump back to your home directory:\nxieerqi@eagle:~/Desktop$ cd\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ \n\nIf you want to permanently get rid of the directory information in your prompt, you should edit your ~/.bashrc file. Add this line:\nPS1=\"\\u@\\h:$\"\n\nSave the file and run source ~/.bashrc . Now you have a static prompt. Big problem is that you won't see where you are at the moment, so you will have to rely on pwd command for that and be careful not to delete valuable files ( so you have been warned :)\nYou can also use bash --posix which will display this type of prompt:\n$ bash --posix\nbash-4.3$ \n\nI don't want to deal with this, just give me working terminal\nThat's fairly easy: install some other terminal emulator. Oh, and there's plenty to choose from.  Personally, I'd recommend terminator, guake or sakura\n\nA: Try     gconftool --recursive-unset /apps/gnome-terminal\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04\nThis simple command works in Ubuntu 16.04.\ndconf reset -f /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/\n\n\nReset only the default profile\nHowever, if you want to reset only the default profile, which uses UUID b1dcc9dd-5262-4d8d-a863-c897e6d979b9 by default, you can use\ndconf reset -f /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:b1dcc9dd-5262-4d8d-a863-c897e6d979b9/\n\n\nNote: This method should work in Ubuntu 15.04, 15.10 and may work in 14.04 too! But I haven't tested on those versions\n\nA: When you are in Terminal, go to Edit > Profile preferences, or press Alt+E-O to open the Editing Profile dialog. After make sure to select everything as below images.\nAlso, make sure that the value of PS1 in ~/.bashrc file is:\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: In terminal click on the  'Edit' menu then 'Profile Preferences'. It will pop up the 'Editing Profile' Window. to reset the color make sure that you have selected the check box named 'Use colors from system theme' in the 'Colors' tab.\n\nA: If you want to do a complete reset of the Gnome Terminal settings, you can remove the ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal directory which contains them. I would close all terminal windows on your desktop. Then switch away from the GUI with Ctrl+Alt+F1 and login on the console.\nYou should probably backup the directory first, with something like:\ncp -a ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal ~/terminal-settings.bak\n\nThen remove it:\nrm -rf ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal\n\nNow, you can switch back to the GUI with Alt+F7 or Alt+F8 and launch the terminal. It should be reset to system default settings.\n\nA: I played with it which resulted in removing all colors.. and kept me with monochrome..No difference between file and directories.\nTry either of this: \nls --color=auto  \nls --color=tty\n\nReference:  https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-turn-on-or-off-colors-in-bash/\nMight help someone...\n", "Q: Syncing music with Ubuntu One If I want to make use of Ubuntu One's mobile streaming service, how do I add (my own) music to Ubuntu One? \nI mean, if I purchase music through the music store, the music automatically get synced. But how (or rather where) do I add my own collection for synchronization?\n\nA: The easiest way to add all your own music is just to mark the folder it's in as being synced with Ubuntu One. \nSee Ubuntu One : Help : FAQs - How do I move my existing music to Ubuntu One? for details. \nBasically, just right-click on your Music folder (or wherever your music is stored) and pick Ubuntu One > Synchronize this folder from the context menu. This will copy your music into your personal cloud, and then it's all available for streaming.\n", "Q: Cleaning up my Home Directory I have the following problem, I've installed a bunch of Ubuntu packages ever since I used Ubuntu, now I've removed these packages using the Synaptic Package Manager but somehow it still left hidden folders in my home directory for the specific applications I uninstalled, taking up unnessesary diskspace. eg. .Netbeans and .amarok etc\nIs there a way to detect these folders that are no longer in use automatically and delete them?\n\nA: There's no way how to detect these unused folders reliable. A program can choose any folder name to save the user information. There's not necessarily a relation between folder name and program name.\nIn most cases it's not worthwhile delete this folders because most of them occupy very little space. And if you ever reinstall the program all your data is still there.\nYou can however manually delete folders which occupy very much space. You have to guess if the folders aren't used anymore. You may want to backup these folders first.\nThe space occupied by each folder can be listed with a graphical file manager or on a console with a command like this:\ncd \"$HOME\"\ndu -h --max-depth 1\n\n\nA: Well, I had the same problem once, and I just opened nautilus, pressed Ctrl+h to view hidden files, and sorted them by date.  I found lots of folders that werent modified beyond a certain date. Take note though, I had installed a new fresh version of Ubuntu, and hence  some applications had newer modified dates, which helped me to sort.\nI am not sure about this: Some applications might change files inside the folder, but the folder date wont be modified. You have to check for that too.\n\nA: The Mundus project is building some software designed to make it easier to clean up unused files in a home directory. See: https://sebikul.github.io/mundus/\n\nA: Take a look into the folders that bother you, to see if there is anything of value in there, and - if you're happy with losing the data - just delete them (just in case, you might choose to leave them in the trash for a few weeks). \nIn the future, you can instruct your package manager to remove the application as well as associated system-wide configuration files by doing a purge.\n\n\n*\n\n*In synaptic,\nright click the package and select\nMark for complete removal.\n\n*On the command line, if you prefer,\ntype sudo apt-get purge\npackagename.\n\n\nThis will delete any configuration and application data that the application has created system-wide, it will - of course - leave intact all the data that you have saved from within the application (i.e. NetBeans' project directory), this includes all the user-specific configuration that is saved in your home directory. Manual deletion is the only way to get rid of those.\nIf you want to find out what folders take up much space, there's the Disk Usage Analyser (Applications → Accessories → Disk Usage Analyser), select the \"scan home\" option to get a listing of everything in home, including hidden files.\nAlso, use the Computer Janitor (System → Administration → Computer Janitor) to clean up any rubbish that has been left behind by the package manager. In terms of the command line, this would be equivalent to doing sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean.\nSome applications, like NetBeans and AmaroK, may leave behind quite a bit of data. But there is no way for the system to automatically delete them without the risk of deleting something somebody actually wanted to keep. For the users' sake, there's no such feature; a good job considering you might have used netbeans for a few years before removing it - i'd be really annoying if apt deleted all your work to free 500 kilobytes. :-)\n", "Q: Core i7 with 4GB - go 64 bit or stay 32bit..? I have a Core i7 laptop with 4gb ram. In windows, the disadvantage of using the 32bit OS would be that a single app could not use more than 2gb of ram (+ the 2gb shared kernel-space memory) except when setting a boot switch which reduces the amount of shared kernel memory, then it's 3GB max per app.\nWhat disadvantages/limitations would I have in Ubuntu for sticking to the 32bit OS? (If any?) - As I only have 4GB of ram, I can't see why I need to use the 64bit version?\n\nA: I find it quite amusing that the usage of 64bit is so closely bound to memory in the machine. 64bit means as well that per processor cycle you are able to process twice the amount of data comparing to a 32bit operating system.\nUse 64bit in case you do\n\n\n*\n\n*video editing and processing\n\n*sound editing and processing\n\n*graphic editing and processing\n\n*work with large files (e.g. databases, large log files, ...)\n\n\nI am doing a podcast and using 64bit with my notebook saves a lot of time when doing audio processing (noise reduction, normalizing, compression, ...). My notebook only has 2 GB of RAM.\n\nA: It's also worth pointing out that although you only have 4GB of physical RAM, presumably you have swap so in reality have >4GB available. Only you know whether you run the type of applications that are likely to be affected by the 4GB/process limit. Think video/image processing or scientific applications (circuit simulation, matlab, that sort of thing) for examples.\nPersonally I'd go for it. Although you can run in 32-bit mode with these processors, our experience at work is that we get better performance when running the same processor in 64-bit. That's just our experience of course though.\n\nA: Why install 32-bit OS for a 64bit CPU?  Mind that you will almost always be able to install and run 32bit applications on a 64bit environment once you have added the 32bit libs. Running 64bit apps on a 32bit OS is impossible. Go for 64 bit.\n\nA: I have a laptop with almost the same configuration as yours. But I decided to install Ubuntu 10.10 32 bits instead of 64 bits because I have some closed-source software dependence:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adobe Flash plugin: recently Adobe started provide flash in 64 bits for Linux, but its still a problem, crashing every time. Several blogs around the Internet are posting how to workaround to get a flash plugin (32 bits version) to work on a 64 bits system. You may give it a try if you really intend to move to 64 bits.\n\n*Skype: while its possible to install and use skype 32 bits in a 64 bits system, you may suffer from problems related to the fact that two versions of the same library (ia32-libs, lib32asound2, libasound2-plugins, Qt and etc) will be installed in your laptop.\n\n*Mplayer with w32codecs: Mplayer works fine, but to use the W32codecs which include WMV9 support, you need to use a 32bit Mplayer with 32bit libraries. A guide how to do this is found in this thread.\n\n*Several others softwares like Rar, RealPlayer, Java, Opera, Wine, Matlab for Linux - can be a problem too, with different recipes to workaround just giving you more work to configure and use it.\n\n\nMy opinion is: stay in 32 bits!! You probably have a dependency on one of the software I listed above - and the amount of work provided by such a change does not compensate for the change.\nAbout your 4GB of memory: don't worry! Ubuntu will install the right kernel (with PAE) by default. Thanks!\n\nA: You need to install it with a network connection so it can pick the PAE on install.\n\nA: I have the same components, (Dell studio 1557, i7 quad-core, 4GB RAM) an I go for 64bit as it is more natural.\nLinux has 64bit support for almost every application out there and even if there isn't one, 32bit application support is already built in Ubuntu.\nSo for a hardware that has 64bit CPU + 4GB Ram the natural OS is 64bit OS. Not that with 32bit you will have any problem. If you install Ubuntu 32bit, it will automatically install a PAE kernel which is compatible with >3GB of Ram.\nFor years I've been using every 64bit Ubuntu version that was released and never had a single problem.\nSo go for it... :)\n\nA: There may well be some annoyances along the way. A few of the proprietary components of Ubuntu (like the Oracle Java runtime and Adobe Flash) might be a bit harder to install that you would expect.\nThere may also be problems with some obscure wireless drivers and the like - but this is the exception rather than the rule.\nOther than that, Linux' great 32 bit compatibility layer ensures that your system will be pretty much rock solid and, often time, quite a bit better at computational task that benefit from the larger address size.\nUbuntu server is now recommended by canonical in its 64 bit form per default. There is, all in all, much trust in the 64 bit linux architecture. It is no longer experimental, it is no longer just an add on. And even though some of the applications haven't caught up (flash is the only one of them that matters, really), the Linux kernel is now considered a 64 bit system with a 32 bit compatibility layer, rather than the other way round.\nIn short: Do it, go 64 bit - it's running millions and millions of Linux servers today, and it's completely ready for your desktop.\nAs Huygens points out, 32 bit is the safe bet. If you can stand the potential annoyance of re-installing the 32 bit version, it makes sense to try 64 bit first, and test for common issues.\nThe 32 bit installer will of course automatically enable a PAE kernel if you have more ram then can be addressed in 32 bits, rendering the ram issue a thing of the past. This has been said many times here, but why not include it again :)\n\nA: If your concern is only about having access to 4GB of RAM, then go for the 32bit + PAE version of Ubuntu. It's the easiest way :-) But read further in order to understand limitations and advantages of each architecture.\nI guess your hardware is pretty recent, so Ubuntu will just pick up the 4GB of memory even in 32bit as it's using a kernel feature called PAE (some release of Ubuntu have a separate kernel for that, check in Synaptic Package Manager for PAE). It's really stable and you won't regret it, especially for Flash which needs (if you install it the easy way from the repository) a 32bit stack. In my experience, a 64bit OS with Flash 32bit is unstable.\nBut they are a few limitations on the 32bit version, a process (a program) cannot access more than 2GB or sometimes 3GB of memory (depends on kernel and application own memory management such as Java Virtual Machine). This is obviously not a problem for most application. However, I've been using a few GPS tools to build maps. They sometimes (for big maps) need more than 2GB addressable memory. But it's really not common. In addition, 32bit+PAE can be incompatible with some proprietary drivers. They do work perfectly with open source ones, but some times the proprietary/binary drivers can not handle this architecture.\nOn the other side, you can go 64bit and with Ubuntu Software Centre you can be happy as you have access to a huge library of 64bit applications. However, if you want to use proprietary software on Linux, you need to hope that they support also 64bit. Products like: Adobe Flash, Adobe AIR, Google Talk Plugin, Skype, Amazon MP3 are 32bits only. Some do work if you install the 32bit stack on your 64bit system, but some won't (Amazon MP3) or badly (Adobe Flash). Another drawback of 64bit system is that they use more memory. So a same application will use more memory for doing the same thing in a 32bit environment. Sometimes it's a problem.\nConclusion is:\n\n\n*\n\n*32bit is more compatible regarding application (especially proprietary ones like Skype or Flash). PAE does not have impact on applications usually.\n\n*32bit+PAE/64bit you might have problem on both platform with certain binary drivers (usually for WiFi)\n\n*If you don't need an application that uses more than 2GB of RAM (create your own map for your GPS), then you don't need 64bit. This is the case for the vast majority of users in today computing.\n\n*64bit tend to use more memory for the same workload.\n\n*Some users and benchmarks (see phoronix.com) report 64bit systems are slightly faster. But the margin is small enough that I don't feel the differences.\n\n\nA: First of all you would need the PAE kernel if you intend to use the 4gb of RAM with 32 bit OS. Otherwise you would end up with a portion of your memory not being utilised. And the 3gb limit per process would remain. So my suggestion would be to use the 64 bit.In any case if you plan to upgrade your system in future you would have to switch to 64bit. Java and Flash problems aside there is no reason to stick to 32 bit.\n\nA: I had an i7 and was transcoding video. I was using vlc. if i was running ubuntu 12.04 32 bit it resulted in 60% processor utilization. using 12.04 64bit it took 13% utilization. so some applications are drastically impacted. \n\nA: I'd switch to 64Bit.\nReason is that Linux apps come in both flavors and even if they don't you can simply compile them on your system.\nAnother reason is that nowadays, RAM is pretty darn cheap so, if you were to say, double your memory, staying with 32bit would severely limit you. \n", "Q: Video editor with bubble annotations I use the annotations feature of YouTube a lot, but I want to get away from flash and start hosting my videos using html5. So I need to create those bubbles and embed them in the video using an editor. Is there an easy way to do that or a video editor that has such feature?\n\nA: Advene\n\nAdvene Project: http://liris.cnrs.fr/advene/index.html\n\nA: Not directly answering your question, I would say hard-embedding them on top of your video is way too destructive. YouTube agrees with me; they don't edit the videos you annotate, they just show a deebrie above the video.\nAnd you can do exactly what YouTube does with your HTML video. The difference is you need to do it. In short: load a list of annotations (their text, time, duration and position), listen to the playing event of the video, and the pop up divs over the video while it's playing.\nThere are HTML5 \"players\" out there (they're more frameworks around the <video> tag) but none I know of do this for you. JW Player probably has the most advanced solution but it's still in development and they claim their JS API \"will\" change before final release. You might need to change things as they do but it's still a base to work from.\nhttp://developer.longtailvideo.com/trac/wiki/HTML5Overview\n", "Q: Wireless card only starts to work if I boot into Windows I'm facing a very weird problem with my wireless network card in ubuntu 10.10 !\nRecently I have installed ubuntu 10.10 beside my windows XP on my Dell XPS 1330 laptop.\nEverything worked fine except my wireless network. I tried to activate the wireless driver recommended in \"Ubuntu Additional Drivers\" utiltity, but it didn't work.\nNext, I installed \"ndisWrapper-utils\" using \"Synaptic Package Manager\" and installed my windows wireless driver using \"Windows Wireless Driver\" utility!\nNow it is sometimes working fine, sometimes not!!\nThe weird thing is that whenever my ubuntu doesn't recognize my wireless network and I restart my computer to my windows XP; My Windows doesn't recognize the wireless networks too! In this situation if I restart my windows, the problem still isn't solved BUT if I standby my windows and come back, the problem is solved in both windows and linux!!!\nIt means that whenever my ubuntu doesn't recognize my wireless network, I have to restart in my windows and stanby for once and come back in my ubuntu !!! :D\n09:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetLink BCM5906M Fast Ethernet PCI Express (rev 02)\n0c:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802.11b/g LP-PHY (rev 01)\n\n\nA: Is there an on/off button for your wireless?  If so, try pressing that in Ubuntu. It might be off by default when it boots into Ubuntu.\n\nA: \"The weird thing is that whenever my ubuntu doesn't recognize my wireless network and I restart my computer to my windows XP; My Windows doesn't recognize the wireless networks too!\"\nThis may simply (or at least partially) be something new conflicting with your wireless network.  Otherwise your wireless adapter is Broadcom and so takes some extra work to get working properly (Look here and here).  \n", "Q: Whats the .local folder for in my Home Directory What is the ~/.local folder good for and is it safe to remove the content within this folder?\n\nA: The .local/ directory is used by some software to keep your preferences (as pointed by @loevborg). This directory is part of the effort to standardize the mess that is the $HOME user. But unfortunately many software has not yet joined this effort, even some gnome software still are spreading your preferences in others directory (see .gnome2, .gconf, .evolution, etc).\nIt is not safe to remove the directory. Some apps store important information/config files inside this directory.\n\nA: Let me share one of my experiences about the .local directory.\nI also found my disk partition(root partition) which store home directory has no enough space, and after I check those directories' content, I found the .local directory stores above 70G space, then I want to delete it, but fear the deletion could cause my ubuntu system crash. So I searched this question in google, and it directs me here.\nBut the previous answers could not solve my problems, I only want two results on my system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove some content in the .local directory, then I could have enough disk space to store my new files;\n\n*I don't want my system crash, it means I don't want to directly delete the content from my home .local directory, it's too dangerous!\nFinally, I found the biggest content under the .local directory is here:\n/home/myAccount/.local/share/Trash\nIt occupies 69G Bytes. I feel it relates to the Trash, so I go to trash:\ntrash:///\nand empty the trash,\nThen I found the 69G bytes disk space was freed!!\nSo my conclusions:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's highly risky to delete .local directory directly;\n\n*We could safely delete content under /home/myAccount/.local/share/Trash  by \"Empty\" trash.\n\nA: This is a recent innovation, followed by Gnome and thus by Ubuntu, to store user-specific data in fixed directories. According to this document, there is\n\n\n*\n\n*a single directory where user data is stored, defaulting to ~/.local/share;\n\n*a single directory where configuration is stored, defaulting to ~/.config;\n\n*a single directory which holds non-essential data files, defaulting to ~/.cache.\n\n\nHistorically, Unix programs were free to spread their data all over the $HOME directory, putting their data in dot-files (files starting with \".\") or subdirectories such as ~/.vimrc and ~/.vim. The new specification is intended to make this behavior more predictable. I suspect this makes backups of application data easier, in addition to giving your home directory a tidier appearance. Not all applications adhere to this standard yet.\nIn the .local hierarchy, programs put user information such as emails and calendar events. You could manually remove this data, but then the program would lose its state; unless this is what you intend (e.g. when there is a problem with your configuration), you shouldn't remove or change files in that directory. With .cache you can be more careless as the program should be able to recover - redownload or recompute - all the files if you remove them.\n", "Q: Looking for a Commercial Grade SIP Softphone I use a commercial Asterisk-based SIP provider for my business. I'm going through the process of acquiring hearing aids, and it may be smartest for me to stream telephone audio from my provider directly to my aids via bluetooth and a softphone (I spent a lot of time on the phone). I could conceivably use my Android handset, but it seems k,ind of clunky. I used to use X-Lite under Windows, but the Linux version is very rough comparatively. I've also tried Xoiper, but find the interface pretty rough. I want something that's close to a phone dialing and usage wise.\nCounterpath makes Bria and Eyebeam, which are more contemporary then X-Lite, but there is apparently no way to try them out (I would be open to buying one if that made sense).\nAny recommendations are appreciated.\n\nA: I like Ring and find it very \"professional\" and linux friendly (they got accepted on Debian repository)\n\nA: There are lots of software you can use, but firstly you need to know if your commercial Asterisk-based SIP provider is adopting an open protocol. \nSome options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ekiga\n\n*Linphone \n\n*Qutecom\n\n*Twinkle\n\n*SJphone\n\n*Empathy\n\n*Mumble\nThanks!\n\nA: X-Lite is my favorite.\nFeatures include:\n \n\n*Comprehensive Personal Address Book, including detailed calls lists and history\n\n*Zero-Touch Configuration of your USB headset or other audio/video devices\n\n*IM and Presence Management\n\n*Choice of dial pad-centric or contact-centric interface, or a combination of both\nIf you are looking for real commercial software then you can buy  eyeBeam 1.5 or Bria 3. Both are from the makers of X-Lite\n\nA: You can try Jitsi (http://www.jitsi.org). I use this in a corporate environment to connect to Openfire Server (Jabber server using XMPP) and also to a VOIP Server (Asterisk based - PIAF software). Audio, video and screen sharing work very nicely.\nJitsi allows you to sign in various accounts at the same time. Unified communications in the real sense\n\nA: I played around with many SIP Softphones and by far Linphone was the most reliable. It is extremely reliable in terms of audio and video throughput. It may be a little choppy wrt to the UI, even though recently they've made progress on that, but this is just a small nitpick compared to the technical reliability. One added benefit is the impressive platform support:\n\nLinphone has been launched in 2001. It was the very first open source application using SIP software on Linux. For more than 10 years, a lot of improvements have been done and Linphone has been ported on the main desktop, mobile and web platforms:\n\n*\n\n*on Windows Desktop in 2006\n\n\n*on iOS and Android in 2010\n\n\n*on Blackberry OS5-7 in 2011\n\n\n*on Windows Phone 8 in 2013\n\n\n*on web browsers in 2013 (Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Apple Safari)\n\nLinphone is fully open-source, but the company behind it also provides commercial support:\n\nBelledonne Communications company is developing and maintaining Linphone and related projects. It offers commercial assistance and licensing for companies using or integrating Linphone within their products.\n\n", "Q: 7zip error - can not open output file I am trying to unzip a 7zip file from the command line like this, but I get an error with using e or x parameters.

With Ubuntu as the Host, I want to run two similar/identical(?) instances of a VirtualBox Guest on the same Host, or perhaps on another Host which is on the same LAN... \nI have set up a Guest as a \"base\" for the two clones. I have exported it as an ovf appliance.  \nI've imported this \"base\" guest OS back into VirtualBox, with a unique name and .vdk ... and I have started them both on the same Host, and all seems okay, but I do wonder if I have missed some significant point.  \n...eg. Is the virtual NIC the same? this would throw the LAN into confusion (I think)... and what about UUIDs?   \nI haven't actually tried 2 clones together, yet... only the original and one clone, but I haven't gone beyond a simple startup ...\n\nA: If you properly clone the VM using the vboxmanage clonehd commands it will create the cloned VM with a new mac address as well.\n\nA: I am not sure with VirtualBox, but with VMWare there are no such problems. Multiple VMs can share a vmnic, and cloned guests get a new MAC address and what not. \nMy guess would be that you are fine (I do it all the time on VMWare workstation) and from what I have seen of VirtualBox it is very mature. Try it out, if it doesn't work, then worry about it.\n\nA: Watch out. With VirtualBox, cloned VMs will have the same mac address as the original one. Therefore, the network will not be able to differentiate between the two. Currently, you will have to manually change the mac address of the newly cloned instance BEFORE starting it to avoid conflict on the network.\n", "Q: Cannot run Gcompris I installed gcompris on ubuntu 10.10 and when i tired to run it, it exited immediately. i ran it from shell giving the command gcompris and got the folowing message.\nakn@ubuntu:~$ gcompris    \n** Message: Binary relocation disabled\n\n** (process:20588): WARNING **: exec_prefix NONE\n\npackage_data_dir         = /usr/share/gcompris/boards\npackage_skin_dir         = /usr/share/gcompris/boards/skins\npackage_menu_dir         = /usr/share/gcompris/boards\npackage_locale_dir       = /usr/share/locale\npackage_plugin_dir       = /usr/lib/gcompris\npackage_python_plugin_dir= /usr/share/gcompris/python\nInfos:\n   Config dir '/home/akn/.config/gcompris'\n   Users dir '/home/akn/My GCompris'\n   Database '/home/akn/.config/gcompris/gcompris_sqlite.db'\n\n(gcompris:20588): Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_window_set_type_hint: assertion `!gtk_widget_get_mapped (GTK_WIDGET (window))' failed\nSegmentation fault\nakn@ubuntu:~$ \n\n\nA: I guess you found a bug due to the failed Segmentation fault message.

Computer becomes unresponsive to mouse/keyboard and only pressing power button on chasis restores it. Disks and coolers are working during the suspend / hibernation as if nothing happened.

Thank you.\n\nA: I don't know which graphics card you use, but I partially solved a similar problem after changing from the repository ATI drivers to the proprietary, binary Catalyst drivers from the ATI page.\nTo be clear, my problem was that suspension and hibernation did \"suspend\" and turn the computer off, respectively, but I could never resume in any of those cases.\nHowever, that was not totally effective, since the resuming processes now worked but they were astonishingly slow. Resuming from hibernation could take up to 8 minutes.\nAfter following this post\nhttp://ubuntu-virginia.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9378826#post9378826\nnow it works excellently.\nI think it's probable that your problem might be solved in another way, but keep in mind this as a possible alternative if nothing else works.\n\nA: Updating my graphics driver to ATI Radeon community managed drivers fixed this.\n", "Q: apt-get upgrade segfault!

I'm trying to install Zend on a machine running xampp. Zend's help file says that in order to set up the command-line tools, I need to make sure that the contents of the /library directory are placed inside my php include_path specified directory.\nWhen I look at my php.ini, include_path is commented out, but the value looks like this:\n; UNIX: \"/path1:/path2\"\n;include_path = \".:/php/includes\"\n\nWhere exactly is the include_path pointing to? I'm pretty new to Linux, and have never seen .: as part of a file path.\n\nA: .: is actually just . ( since : is the keyword that separates multiple paths ) which means the current folder the script is being executed in is included as part of the include_path. That way when you have two files in the same directory:\nindex.php\ninclude-me.php\n\nYou can include the second in PHP with include('include-me.php');. Without . being in path you wouldn't be able to do so.\nSo in order to complete the install as mentioned you would need to either put the contents of /library in the same folder the script you are working on is in - or in /php/includes (Granted you remove the ; from the ini file). You can also create another directory - like /opt/Zend/library and add /opt/Zend/library to your include path statement: include_path = \".:/php/includes:/opt/Zend/library\"\nLastly - since you are running Ubuntu it is recommended that you use Ubuntu's LAMP setup instead (Most all documentation assumes you are using). This can be installed by removing XAMPP and performing sudo tasksel install lamp-server which will install Apache 2.2, MySQL, PHP 5.3 onto the system. As covered in What's the easiest way to set up a LAMP stack?\n\nA: : is a separator in the list of directories.\n. means the current directory\nSo when a php script is looking for an include file, it will look it the same directory as the php file, and /php/includes.\n", "Q: What is the difference between indicators and a system tray? What is so new about indicators?\nWhat did we have before?\nAre there technical or usability differences?\n\nA: Basically, The system tray is an application running on a given X screen that can display small icons provided by running applications. Windows XP calls this feature the notification area. The concept of System Tray is very well documented by freedesktop.org.\nHere is the documention for indicators:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/application-indicators/\n\n*http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.04/c/indicate/\n\n*http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.04/c/appindicator/\nIndicators are ways to group applications that have some similarity - or belong to a family of applications with a degree of similarity - in a single system tray, improving usability. Let me try to use an illustrative image:\n\nThis indicator works as a proxy (central point sounds better) to different applications that keep a similarity: all are related with communications. You can use the same indicator to open and send emails, or to chat with some friends, browser your contact, or access twitter. All indicators are groups of system trays.\nBTW, I really like the idea of group system tray tasks into the same indicator. It's a huge usability improvement :-)\n\nA: I know this question has been answered a lot of time, but here my own answer :)\nThe main difference between the \"system tray\" and the Indicator applets is that \"tray icons\" are application-wise ( so one icon per application ), while Indicators applets are task-wise ( so one icon per task ).\nSystem tray Example:\nLaunch Banshee and Rhythmbox and you get 2 tray icons,\nwith different options and usage.\nIndicator applet Example:\nBanshee and Rythmbox should integrate with the same indicators,\nwith same icon, options and usage\nObviously you can abuse of Indicator applets ( like the StackExchange or Ubuntuone  one :P making them one per application. That is wrong. )\n\nA: Indicators is a project of the Ayatana team, focussed on usability and\ndesign. The indicators they have invisioned to replace the traditional\n\"system tray\" have the following goals:\n\n\n*\n\n*Support for KDE and GNOME\n\n\n*\n\n*That means that developers only have to do the work once. Which is rather nice.\n\n\n*Creating a space for innovation\n\n\n*\n\n*The most obvious example is the messaging menu, which unifies email, irc\ninstant messaging, and (\"Your App Here\") into a consise menu that will\nalways behave in the same way\n\n\n*Cleaning up the clutter\n\n\n*\n\n*many applications put up indicators for various reasons - and not always\ngood ones. Indicators make it easy to combine various tasks into a single\nindicator, leaving the user with a clean indication area, where they actually\nunderstand what everything does.\n\n\n*Accessibility\n\n\n*\n\n*there were some accessibility problems with the old system, with indicators\nthey can be addressed.

I'm hoping for an application that is to man pages as Kompozer is to web pages.\nI have tried gmanedit but have found that it is basically just a text editor with some easily available snippets - it is necessary to know the man page format to use it and the editing area is just a text widget.\nWhile I'd prefer software that is in the official Ubuntu repositories, I am OK with using unsupported methods for installation such as PPAs or installing from source.\n\nA: It is possible to author man pages using DocBook markup and use tools such as docbook2x-man to create troff output. There are some visual (\"WYSIWYM\"-style) editors available for editing DocBook markup. For example, the GPL-licensed Syntext Serna Free:\n\nAlso, doclifter is a utility for converting man pages to DocBook.\n\nA: This is an addendum to Jukka's suggestion of using docbook with the main reason why I like it other than it's much easier to write and deal with:\nYou can convert it to .pot files for more easy translation. For example, creating a .pot (language template):\nxml2po -o my_program.1.pot my_program.1.xml\nThen merging translated files (.po) back into a language specific docbook man page, in this case German:\nxml2po -p de.po my_program.xml > my_program.de.xml\n\nA: Grapse, an HTML5 webapp, was featured on Hacker News 2/3 of a year ago.

After searching this site, and reading the Ubuntu community documentation, I've decided to use a simple tar command such as \nsudo tar -cvpzf serverbackupMMDDYYYY.tgz --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys --exclude=/media --exclude=/backups --exclude=/boot --exclude=/dev  --exclude=/home -exclude=/tmp --exclude=serverbackupMMDDYYYY.tgz / \n\nTo backup my system. While researching how to backup my system it seemed some people recommended excluding /dev (as I'm doing above) and others warned that there could be problems doing that (but they didn't elaborate).\nWhat are the pros and cons of including or excluding /dev in a backup?\nI tested a full backup/restore and didn't run into any problems excluding /dev myself, but I also think I took more steps than necessary to restore. After inserting a non broken hard drive I reinstalled Ubuntu and then extracted the backup over the fresh install.\n\nA: Some directories are irrelevant into a backup. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/*\n\n*/proc/*\n\n*/sys/*\n\n*/tmp/*\n\n**lost+found\n\n\nThey are created during the boot, and are related specific with your devices and/or your running processes.\nWhile its irrelevant to backup or not - your kernel will recreate those directories when boot from restored backup - you probably will save a little time if you do not backup it.\n\nA: *\n\n*None of the nodes in dev are real files, and none of them contain much that isn't generated.\n\n", "Q: Any way to use Skype without random crashes? Like another gui? Okay here's the deal, there is a bug about this (or so it seems) that I reported (it's been changed a lot since then); Skype is crashing and random/on clicks (e.g. adding a contact). I'm tired of Skype, but unfortunately I don't rule the world and I can make anyone switch. Are there any alternate clients? Like something I can use to connect to Skype, add contacts, and chat? Video support would be nice, but it's optional. I know SkypeKit needs a payment first, so it's unlikely anyone has made anything with it, but, I'm DESPERATE right now -__- (the crashing has made me lose stuff, so I'm a bit... you know).\nANYTHING that works would be GREATLY appreciated.\nI'll use ekiga for contacts who don't care about Skype, but some won't switch so ekiga is off the list :P\n\nA: You can install the pidgin-skype package from the Ubuntu Software Centre which (despite the name) will allow you to use Skype in both Empathy (the Ubuntu default IM client) and Pidgin.\nFrom the package description:\nThis plugin communicates with the Skype application in the background to perform its work, so it's necessary to have Skype installed and running. This product uses the Skype API but is not endorsed, certified or otherwise approved in any way by Skype.\n\nA: I found something myself, and I think this might be useful for other users:\nimo.im allows you to chat, even with video, on Skype and other similar services (MSN, etc). The cool part, and perhaps the drawback, is that it is a website, so you have to have a browser window open. To work around this \"limitation\" I'm planning to use prism, so I can have a desktop application (though it looks better in webkit).\n\nA: You might be able to use pidgin and this plugin\neion.robbmob.com\nEion's plugin will let you use skype from within pidgin you still need to have skype running but you won't have to use the gui. It is available in the software centre as pidgin-skype  \n\nA: You appear to be asking two different questions here, so I'll address the first (\"Any way to use Skype without random crashes?\") only, since others appear to have addressed the second (\"Are there any alternate clients? Like something I can use to connect to Skype, add contacts, and chat?\").  To properly debug and finally resolve the reason(s) for the crashes, you'll need to use gdb and strace on the actual skype binary.

If you install everything into /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages (or whatever your platform's standard location is), it's easy to end up in a situation where you unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldn't be upgraded.\n\n\nA: First of all, you need to install the python3 package. After installing it, go to a terminal and type:\nsudo update-alternatives --config python\n\nthen choose python3 from the list that's presented.\nIf it does not work, you may need to recreate the symlink.

I am wondering what is the problem? I have already used the kernel source provided by Ubuntu and I have also make sure the kernel version is the same.\n\nA: Specifically what the problem is that when you built your module, the kernel source tree was probably missing the Modules.symvers file.  The kbuild system actually warns you about this when you build your module.  If Modules.symvers is missing, you'll see:\n\nWarning: Symbol version dump /usr/src/linux-2.6.34-12/Modules.symvers\n           is missing; modules will have no dependencies and modversions.\n\nIf your kernel has CONFIG_MODVERSIONS enabled, then during the modpost phase of building your driver it will run scripts/mod/modpost with the -m option.  If you're brave and take a look at the scripts/mod/modpost.c source, you'll see that the -m option adds the _module_layout_ symbol from vmlinux, however if you don't have Modules.symvers from your kernel, you'll not get the CRC value for this symbol and you'll end up with this error message.\nSo there are two ways around this.\n1) run a full build of your running kernel to generate Modules.symvers, then rebuild your module.\n[http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt][1]\n51  === 2. How to Build External Modules\n52  \n53  To build external modules, you must have a prebuilt kernel available\n54  that contains the configuration and header files used in the build.\n55  Also, the kernel must have been built with modules enabled. If you are\n56  using a distribution kernel, there will be a package for the kernel you\n57  are running provided by your distribution.\n58  \n59  An alternative is to use the \"make\" target \"modules_prepare.\" This will\n60  make sure the kernel contains the information required. The target\n61  exists solely as a simple way to prepare a kernel source tree for\n62  building external modules.\n63  \n64  NOTE: \"modules_prepare\" will not build Module.symvers even if\n65  CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is set; therefore, a full kernel build needs to be\n66  executed to make module versioning work.\n\n2) The other option is to tell stupid modprobe to just ignore all that crap and just load your module anyways:\nmodprobe -f <module>\n\nI tend to favor option 2 :)\n\nA: You must use the precisely identical kernel configuration prior to running make prepare.  Also, if you're building it out-of-tree, you need to be building it against the precisely identical kernel headers matching your currently running kernel (or the target one if you aren't running it at time of compilation).\n\nA: Have both the linux-headers and linux-source packages corresponding to your kernel installed. For example for kernel 3.2.0-27-generic-pae you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-headers-3.2.0-27-generic-pae and\n\n*linux-source-3.2.0-27-generic-pae.\n\n\nIn case the version for the packages above doesn't match your running kernel version then you need to replace $(uname -r) with the version string from your installed kernel package from above. For the above example the package version is 3.2.0-27-generic-pae. When you run uname -r and its output is something different then 3.2.0-27-generic-pae then you need to replace each $(uname -r) below to match the version string from the installed packages. \n\n\n*\n\n*cd /usr/src/linux-source-$Version and unpack the .tar.bz2 archive in place and cd into the extracted directory - I guess you already did this\n\n*cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config into the kernel source directory\n\n*cp /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/Module.symvers . into the kernel source directory\n\n\nAfter you've done that, in the kernel source directory, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*make prepare\n\n*make scripts\n\n*make M=drivers/usb/serial - change the path after M= to suit your needs\n\n\nUnfortunately, I don't know how to build a specific module while keeping Module.symvers untouched. Doing make drivers/usb/serial/option.ko, for example, kills the Module.symvers file, and you end up with your original problem. Using the M= parameter doesn't kill it, but you have to build all the modules in the specified path - and I haven't found a way around it yet.\n", "Q: How do I enable the \"partner\" repository?

I want to create links to software within Software Center using the APTURL - However, I'm not sure how to find out the true \"package name\". What is the easiest way to discover a package's name for use with the APTURL or apt-get command?\n\nA: To create an APT link, open up Ubuntu Software Center ( Applications -> Ubuntu Software Center ), search for and find a package:\n\nNow click Edit -> Copy Web Link or hit Shift+Ctrl+C:  \n\nYou should now have an APT link in your clipboard, like this: http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/moovida\n\nA: You can find the name of a package through the Ubuntu Software Center:\n\nOnce launched type the name of the software you wish to find the package name for in the top right search box.\n\nOnce you find the software you are looking for select \"More Info\"\n\nAt the bottom of the additional information page you'll find Version information which contains, in parentheses, the name of the package\n\nThis is the package name you'll want to use in either apt-get commands or in APTURL links. Also - as demonstrated in the above picture - the package names of available add-ons are listed in parentheses next to each respective add-on.\n\nA: How about just using: \naptitude search <search_terms>\n\nAnd then you will have some info to use.\n\nA: You can search for package names using the command line and the apt-cache command.  For example, enter the following command to find out what the package name is for firefox\n\napt-cache search firefox\n\nIf you get a long list of results, you can view (pipe) the results in a viewer or a text file\n\napt-cache search firefox | less\napt-cache search firefox > ~/firefox-list.txt\n\nThe command apt-cache search searchstring performs a full text search over all the software sources registered on your Ubuntu system. It will search the package names and the descriptions for an occurrence of the searchstring and prints out the package name and the short description, including virtual package names.\nif --names-only is given then the long description is not searched, only the package name is.  This option usually gives a smaller set of results.\n\nA: Use apt-cache search to find the package name of a package in the default Ubuntu repositories that is installable by apt. For example search for an Nvidia proprietary graphics driver that has the '455' version number somewhere in its package name (including in the middle of the package name).\napt-cache search 455\n\nSearch for a package with a name that includes '455-generic' (including the hyphen character in the package name).\napt-cache search 455-generic\n\nSearch for a package with a name that starts with 'postgresql-12-'.\napt-cache search \"^postgresql-12-\"\n\nThe caret character ^ in  \"^postgresql-12-\" indicates that the package name starts with postgresql-12-\nSearch for a package with a name that ends with '455'.\napt-cache search 455$\n\nThe $ character in  455$ indicates that the package name ends with 455\nSearch for a package with a name that contains both 'docker' and 'client'.\napt-cache search docker | grep client\n\n", "Q: Enable external HD after remote reboot Ran into this one tonight:\nWas on my laptop, and ssh'd into my desktop to access files on my desktop's external HD.

I want to use shotwell to manage my photos (along with other power apps like F-Spot and Digicam), for various reasons, but I have one issue. I can't figure out how to delete events. Is this possible (meaning I'm missing something) or is it not a part of the feature set?\n\nA: This feature has been requested on the Shotwell mailing list:\n\n\nFirst and foremost, I think there definitely should be a way to \"delete\"\n    events, or assign photos to \"no event\". Importing a folder of ~1000\n    \"miscellaneous\" photos collected over a year creates about 30-50 events,\n    which is a bit ridiculous; it defeats the purpose of events matching\n    actual events and not \"days\", so I'd really like a way to unassign\n    photos from events to get a better bird-eye's view of the \"important\"\n    pictures among the mess.\n\nThis has been ticketed: http://trac.yorba.org/ticket/2665\n\nThis feature has not yet been added, but could be in the future.\n\nA: This is not an ideal solution but you can delete data and thumbs folders in /home/[local]/.shotwell folder for a fresh start.\nI second the need for a native edit of events in shotwell.\n", "Q: How to move vbox virtual machine to different location along with snapshots I have oracle virtualbox3.2 installed on ubuntu 9.10 desktop.

Until today, I've avoided using the file Notes feature in Nautilus (Properties), because of portability problems. ...but they are just so tantalizingly handy! ...Adding notes to a like-named text file works, but requires more juggling that the Notes feature.  \nSo I've decided to give the Notes a try; now that I'm (almost) exclusively using Ubuntu ...(I'm past the point of no return ;)   \nSo a couple (or three)  questions have come up.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Is this Notes feature exclusive to Nautilus?  \n\n*Is there a Terminal CLI for Notes ...like the CLI for trash?\n\n*Is there a tool which can batch extract/convert the Notes into individual similarly named text files (or something similar) for \"portability\"?\n\n\nA: I am not sure about your first and third question but it appears that it is exclusive (by that I mean that nautilus' metadata is not portable) to Nautilus and I couldn't find any tools for extracting Nautilus file annotations, but here are a few examples of how to access file annotations from the command line,\nSet the notes for a file:  \nhello@world:~$ gvfs-set-attribute -t string Hello.txt metadata::annotation \"This is a note.\"\n\nRead the notes for a file:\nhello@world:~$ gvfs-info -a metadata::annotation Hello.txt  \nattributes:  \n  metadata::annotation: This is a note.\n\n\nA: Nautilus changed a while ago (2009?) from its own system to GVFS for storing data. All the notes are stored in a hidden GVFS database in your home-directory where at least theoretically other programs now can access it. However, the database is quite unreadable for anyone not a developer or involved with GVFS.  :(\nAs DoR showed, you can use the gvfs-tools to read and write notes. The notes are actually written into the database, and whenever you open a folder with Nautilus, it checks the database for notes. Copying files to a different computer, different user, or a backup will not preserve the notes. If, for example, you copy a file to a memory stick the notes won't get copied. Instead Nautilus will make a new note for that copy in the database on your computer. Once you plug it back in, Nautilus finds that note. But if you go to a different computer or want to do a backup, it of course doesn't work. Pretty brain dead.\nTo work around this, one would have to copy the relevant parts of the database.  Unfortunately, I haven't found a way yet of reading the database directly. A work-around is to have a script go through all the files you want to backup and copy the notes into separate files.\nSome information/work-arounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Extracting GVFS file notes\n\n*A script to retrieve the notes\n\n*The\nculprit\n", "Q: guake with zsh doesn't start I changed guake to use /bin/zsh from /bin/bash. now it doesnt start. by start, i mean that when  click the shortcut key, guake just pops up for a second, and then disappears.

See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport for how to get a crash file to attach to the bug.\n\nAs an aside, how can I make zsh the default terminal?\n\nIt's a shell, not a terminal.  But to change it just for your account, you want\nchsh -s /bin/sh\n\nand to change it for newly-added accounts, change DSHELL in /etc/adduser.conf.\n\nA: I've solved the same problem by running zsh in Terminal.

I am using nm-applet to interface with NetworkManager, running xmonad as a window manager. My X sessions (including nm-applet) are set up with a /usr/local/bin/xmonad.start script.\nMy question is, how can I keep nm-applet running in the background as long as X is running, but not necessarily xmonad? As mentioned above, it is being started with xmonad (and dying with it when xmonad is restarted, etc).\nI am using gdm to manage my X sessions, and I'm running 10.10. Where's a good place to start nm-applet to suit my particular needs? I need to remove it from the control of xmonad, but don't know where to start it otherwise.\nAny help, tips, etc appreciated.\nEdit: problem seems to be with how I have integrated xmonad.

When you add software sources, you need to do an apt-get update so that your system APT's database is updated with all the packages on the repositories listed in the software sources lists.\nThen when you try to install any package, APT checks the package name in its database, finds it and checks the name of the repository from where it got it. It then downloads the package from that repository.\nThis means of all the repositories listed in your software sources, none of them have the package named munin-memcached. I checked again and it is not available in official Ubuntu repositories.\nAfter a bit of googling, I found that it is available in this PPA: chris-lea/munin-plugins\nAdd this PPA and install the packages at your own risk.

But the package manager doesn't find it in the repositories. It is usually followed by some info about what packages are missing it, but it didn't here.\nThere is no package name munin-memcached in the standard Ubuntu repos, so you are likely using some extra repository. If you post it here we can try to found the cause.\n\nA: What does Package <package> has no installation candidate means that the package is not found in your Ubuntu releases software sources.\nOne possible reason for this message is that this package is an old package that has been discontinued from your release's default repositories. For example, qt4-default has been discontinued from the default repositories in Ubuntu 20.04 and later. To check for this possibility run the following command:\nrmadison <package>\nThis command will show which Ubuntu releases provide this package and also will show which repository provides this package.\nAnother possible reason for this message is that this package is not available for your computer's CPU architecture. This is worth checking if your computer has an ARM processor. Once again run rmadison <package> to show this information. rmadison <package> will also show if the package you are looking for is only available as source code in which case you must download the package's source code with apt-get source <package>, build a .deb file from the source you downloaded with a program such as checkinstall, and install the .deb file with sudo apt install ./package.deb\nAnother possible reason for this message is that this package is not found in the list of available software because the list of available software  software in the software sources has not been updated. To update the list of available software run the following command:\nsudo apt update\n\nAnother possible reason for this message is because of a proxy configuration issue.\naptitude is a terminal-based package manager with a command-line mode similar to that of apt-get only it is smarter. aptitude can help to resolve package conflicts that generate a  E: Package 'package-name' has no installation candidate error message.\nsudo apt install aptitude\nsudo aptitude install package-name # replace package-name with the name of a package\nLet's say you get the following error message in Ubuntu 20.04.\nE: Package 'libssl0.9.8' has no installation candidate\n\nIt seems that libssl is probably available in the Ubuntu 20.04 default repositories, but it has been renamed because libssl has been upgraded to a newer version.

I realize that Calibre can be used to manage e-books and I do have that downloaded. However, Amazon won't let me download ebooks unless my PC is registered in their Kindle program and I'd like to just keep things streamlined.\nI've viewed many tutorials and advice for setting it up.

Following some clues I saw on forums, the best solution was to delete all files under .wine/drive_c/windows/winsxs/manifests. It works but may cause problems with other programs.\nBut I notice also that the only file to cause trouble was x86_microsoft.vc90.crt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.30729.4148_none_deadbeef.manifest - inside the winsxs/ directory - and that the problem is that this file make reference to three files:  msvcr90.dll, msvcp90.dll, msvcm90.dll\nIf you look inside \n.wine/drive_c/windows/winsxs/x86_microsoft.vc90.crt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.30729.4148_none_deadbeef\n\nyou will notice that only the file msvcr90.dll exists. So search for the other two dll files on Google and put them in this directory. For me, Kindle for PC is working just fine now after I've put these two dll files in this directory.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install PlayOnLinux. Also, in Synaptic, etc.\n\n*Run it.\n\n*Click 'install'\n\n*Search for 'kindle'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select it and install.\nPlayOnLinux will use and if needed will install the appropriate Wine version for the program. Let PlayOnLinux download automatically and install the Kindle for PC software instead of downloading and selecting it yourself. \n\nA: I just want to share a solution for those who are trying to install Kindle on Ubuntu 14.04 and Linux Mint. In my case, I noticed that the ttf-mscorefonts-installer package was not properly installed by the Software Center App because it didn't show the agreement that I had to acknowledge. I think that the fonts were not installed because of that. So I manually installed the fonts from the terminal using sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer, acknowledged the agreement shown in a colored text format display, and after that, my Kindle does not crash anymore when I open my e-books. My Kindle now works on Wine versions 1.6 and 1.7 under PlayOnLinux. \nFor Linux Mint users, they should install the ubuntu-restricted-extras package before installing the ttf-mscorefonts-installer for some reason. I think without the ubuntu-restricted-extras, not all fonts will be available even after installing the ttf-mscorefonts-installer package\nHope this works!

If it is possible, how can I do that?\n\nA: Nautilus Scripts\nNautilus scripts can be written in any programming language, including python. You just need to make your python source file executable and copy it to ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts  in Ubuntu versions prior to 14.04. For Ubuntu 14.04 and newer the directory is different: ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts\nYou will also need to add #!/usr/bin/env python as the first line of the file. Note that by default #!/usr/bin/env python points to Python2. If you need Python 3 specifically, use #!/usr/bin/env python3. \nOnce you have done all this, the script will be accessible from the scripts sub-menu of the  right click menu in Nautilus.\n\nSee also:https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NautilusScriptsHowto\nNautilus Extensions\nNautilus extensions have more flexibility than scripts - eg. they can be used to add an item directly to the context menu.

Actually what is a bug ? any predefined rules?\n\nA: I'll take a swing. Primarily, behaviour not intended by the designer / programmer (discounting bad design). In terms of what bugs you should report to people, anything which makes the program hrder to use and fits the above description. This includes, from worst to least severe, system crashes, X crashes, program crashes and any internal program bugs.\nBugs which cause crashes or window closures will usually cause some kind of output to stderror if you've run the application from a terminal, this can be useful. Also see system logs for error reports.\n\nA: A bug is:\n\nA software bug is the common term used to describe an error, flaw, mistake, failure, or fault in a computer program or system that produces an incorrect or unexpected result, or causes it to behave in unintended ways. (From Wikipedia)\n\nHere is another good definition of what constitutes a bug. Either:\n\n\n*\n\n*The program did not behave according to the programmer’s intentions. or\n\n*The programmer’s intentions did not fulfill common and reasonable user expectations.\n\n\nUbuntu community has a excellent definition for bug in this wiki, especially highlighting the difference between bug and missing features:\n\nA software bug is an error or fault in a computer program which makes it fail to work as it's supposed to. This could be as simple as failing to work at all, or as complicated as a subtly incorrect result [...] Some things aren't bugs, but are missing features that should be reasonably included. Missing features shouldn't be reported as bugs, instead FeatureSpecifications should be written for them. \n\nWhile it is hard to draw a line separating the two definitions and answer the question is it bugs or missing features?, it is possible to give some guidelines: \n\n\n*\n\n*if it's a problem that would have many details to address, it's likely to be a feature. For example, the inability to write files safely to a modern Windows partition is a missing feature. \n\n*The inability to write files safely to a ReiserFS partition would be a bug. \n\n\nThe difference between the two assertions is: the first is more widespread (support modern windows FS) and thus can be view as Missing Feature, while the other emphasizes a unique problem (can't write into ReiserFS) - a specific bug.\nIf you are interested, I recommends you to take a look at the BugSquad team wiki. Fighting bugs is one of the most interesting activities involved in software development cycle, besides being a great learning opportunity :-)\nThanks!\n\nA: A bug is an error in a computer program or system, so the program doesn't work properly or doens't work at all. So bugs can be a result of wrong programming code, or programming code that isn't robust enough and can't handle certain exceptions (for example: division by 0)\n\nA: For all practical purposes the term \"bug\" should be avoided as a too fuzzy term.\nThe best answer to your question fills a whole book: \"Why Programs Fail\" by Andreas Zeller. A book that should be on every programmers' bookshelf. The author also makes a good effort in not calling them \"bugs\" (read on). Because as crncosta's answer already suggests a \"bug\" isn't just a programming error. This is why some people prefer the term \"issue\" instead (which leads to \"issue tracker\" instead of \"bug tracker\").\nBecause what's perceived as a bug by an end-user needn't be a bug at all. It can be - even though this is often used as a lame excuse - simply by design. Some failures however, once observed, are classified \"bugs\", even though they are due to lack of a feature.\nThe author of aforementioned book spends several pages on the definition of terms such as failure and defect and describing why \"bug\" is not an appropriate term (too fuzzy).\nSummary of his terminology:\n\n\n*\n\n*programmer creates the defect\n\n*defect causes an infection (\"faulty program state\")\n\n*infection propagates\n\n*infection causes failure (\"observable bad/unintended behavior\")\n\n*observer (usually the end-user) sees the failure\nAs you can see the author distinguishes between cause and effect, which in the case of \"bug\" is almost always mixed. Most of the time the term \"bug\" is being applied to the defect, the infection and the failure.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have Separate X Screen with separate sound?

I have a Toshiba USB floppy drive that I need to use under Ubuntu. When I connect it, and insert a floppy disk in it, I do not see anything mounted under Ubuntu 10.10. \nI was suspecting the hardware and/or the floppy disk to be defective, and so I tested the floppy disk as well as the floppy drive itself under Windows XP, and everything was just fine. \nI was able to find the following instructions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Add the following line to the /etc/modules file: \nfloppy\n\n*Enter the following shell commands: \nmkdir /media/floppy\nmount -t vfat /dev/sdc /media/floppy -o uid=1000\nThis will mount the floppy, but I would like this to happen automatically, so when I connect the drive to the USB port, it automatically mounts the floppy.\nHow can I make this work? Or does Ubuntu only work with internal Floppy drives? \n\nA: The following procedure worked instantly on Ubuntu 12.04:\nREMARK: \nThe df command shows that /dev/sdd show that d the last assigned drive in use. I need to know this to find the next available one, which is used in the subsequent sudo mount ... command. In my case, the next drive will be /dev/sde .\nYou will need to determine the correct drive for your own system.   For example, you might have /dev/sda, or sdb, or sdc. \nSo, first, to see the drive information:\n df\nNext, run mkdir and mount :\n mkdir /mt/ee1\n\n sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sde /mt/ee1 -o uid=1000\n\nFor automatic execution at boot time, I normally use Perl scripts, which detect and adapt automatically and give stable names to the partitions. \nI do not need this at this point of time for floppies, and therefore I didn't optimize it. Perhaps the command \"mount ...\" is not optimal....)\nA more general but a bit primitive solution would be to create a bash/batch file with multiple lines as above with sudo... , with the several probable possible variants /dev/sd... on the specific PC.\nThen there might be a call of this file in the settings of \"Startup Applications\". \nI did not test this. \nIn addition, this does not deal with the aspect of removing or inserting a different floppy disk. This could be done in some automatic or at least semi-automatic manner.... \nI do not know if the way above is optimal. I just wanted to add helpful information, after having settled my own problem with the preceding answers. \n\nA: On my older systems with built-in floppy drives, the drive is designated as /dev/fd0. Unfortunately, later releases of Ubuntu do not automatically mount these drives, nor do they create a directory in /media for it. \nTo mount my drive, I first have to create a directory to mount it in, /media/floppy. Then I can mount it using sudo mount /dev/fd0 /media/floppy. \n\nA: Make sure there is a floppy disk in the drive or else there is nothing to mount!\nDon't sudo mount or else you can only access with root privileges.\nFirst, to see the drive information, run df.\nOn my system with one HD the floppy appears as sdb (sda was the hard drive)\nThen to mount:\nudisks --mount /dev/sdb --mount-fstype=vfat\n\ne.g:\nfred@Ubuntu1:~$ udisks --mount /dev/sdb --mount-fstype=vfat\nMounted /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sdb at /media/MM259_32BIT\nfred@Ubuntu1:~$ df\nFilesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1      152030356 9315352 134992252   7% /\nudev              890692       4    890688   1% /dev\ntmpfs             360384     856    359528   1% /run\nnone                5120       0      5120   0% /run/lock\nnone              900956     292    900664   1% /run/shm\n/dev/sdb            1424    1397        27  99% /media/MM259_32BIT\n\n\nA: I wrote a little script that auto-detects the drive id when you run it, takes some of the donkey work out.

This tells me that there are. I thought that the automatic fsck every 30 mounts during the boot-up process is precisely to take care of errors in the root filesystem. But it doesn't do it in my case.\nI could reboot with a LiveCD and fix the errors, and then reboot again, but that's some serious downtime for a live server. A reboot, auto fsck, then continue booting is much more sustainable on a live server, and I believe should be the right behaviour.\nAdditional info: Here is the output. It looks like something that the autofsck would fix, doesn't it?\nroot@server:~# fsck.ext4 -n /dev/sda5\ne2fsck 1.41.11 (14-Mar-2010)\nWarning!  /dev/sda5 is mounted.\nWarning: skipping journal recovery because doing a read-only filesystem check.\n/dev/sda5 contains a file system with errors, check forced.\nPass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes\nPass 2: Checking directory structure\nPass 3: Checking directory connectivity\nPass 4: Checking reference counts\nPass 5: Checking group summary information\nFree blocks count wrong (1849368, counted=1948909).\nFix? no\n\nFree inodes count wrong (545504, counted=552134).\nFix? no\n\n\n/dev/sda5: ********** WARNING: Filesystem still has errors **********\n\n/dev/sda5: 116752/662256 files (0.2% non-contiguous), 795324/2644692 blocks\n\n\nA: You can not force a fsck on / that will repair because the partition is in use. Try running the check from a different partition or live cd.\n\nA: I know this is a really old thread, but I recently had to solve this problem so I wanted to post how to force the OS to fix problems found with fsck during bootup (for 12.04).\nYou do need to run the command sudo touch /forcefsck.  This will cause it to perform an fsck on the next boot.  You can see the results of the fsck in /var/log/boot.log.\nHowever, you are not guaranteed that fsck will fix anything it finds.  To do this, you would need to edit the file /etc/default/rcS.  There is a line at the end of that file:\nFSCKFIX=no\n\nThis needs to be changed to the following:\nFSCKFIX=yes\n\nThis will have the same effect as running the fsck with the -y option which will force all fixes that are possible to be implemented and it will not ask for user interaction.\nThis will allow you to run the fsck like the OP was asking to without having to resort to booting from a live disk which isn't always possible especially if you are on a remote system.\n\nA: sudo touch /forcefsck\nsudo reboot\n\nYou've got a typo- you're touching /forcefcsk. The \"c\" and the \"s\" are swapped. fsck is short for FileSystemChecK.\n\nA: From the e2fsck man page :\n\n\"Note that in general it is not safe to run e2fsck on mounted filesystems. The only exception is if the -n option is specified, and -c, -l, or -L options are not specified. However, even if it is safe to do so, the results printed by e2fsck are not valid if the filesystem is mounted. If e2fsck asks whether or not you should check a filesystem which is mounted, the only correct answer is ''no''. Only experts who really know what they are doing should consider answering this question in any other way.\"\n\nSo if you check a mounted FS with fsck even using the -n option the result may be not valid at all. Don't check mounted filesystems. Use a Live-CD/Live-USB.\nIf you don't check the filesystem while it is mounted, I don't understand why you need to use touch /forcefsck you can just unmount it and fix it. But if it is the case and after a fix your FS still have errors then you can consider using :\ne2fsck -cy /dev/sda5\n\nThat will fix an hard drive related issue called bad blocks you may have (this will take a long time). \nIf you want to check a mounted filesystem, I don't know how to proceed but I think you should create another question.\n\nA: touch /forcefsck alone didn't ensure my system ran fsck at the next boot. I also needed to run:\nsudo tune2fs -c 1 /dev/<my partition>\n\ne.g. \nsudo tune2fs -c 1 /dev/sda1\n\nMore explanation I found is here: How to Force fsck to check filesystem after reboot\n\nA: You can have the revisions done automatically in the following way:\nTune2fs -c 5 -i 10 / dev / sda1\n\n-c is the maximum number of mounts before running fsck and -i is the maximum number of days before running fsck.\nIn this case will be done every 5 mounts or every 10 days, whichever comes first.\nI have two computers, one with Linux SuSE 13.2 and the other with Linux Mint 18.0 and in both it works perfectly.\n", "Q: Is there any way to get a roaming profile in Ubuntu with say ubuntu one, dropbox, rsync, etc?

You may also wish to 1) disallow Skype's managing your microphone levels; 2) unmute your microphone and raise the level to an amplified one (also in Sound Preferences > Input).  Note also that if you're using 10.10, you'll need the latest updates installed for linux, alsa-lib, and pulseaudio.\n\nA: Here's how I resolved my Logitech Headset through Skype problem.  NOTHING is wrong with your headset if you hear music or video. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Tools in Skype (go to \"Tools\" at the top menu, next to \"Help\")\n\n*Click \"Tools\" and scroll down to the bottom for \"Options\" and click it\n\n*Now scroll down to \"Audio Settings\" and click it\n\n*the second category down is \"Speakers\".  Inside the box you should read: \n\nSpeakers (2-Logitech USB Headset).  \n\nIf it does not appear in the box, rather another speaker system, click the down (black, not green) arrow right next to the box. That speaker system is probably what you are seeing inside the box, which are your COMPUTER speakers, which Skype thinks you prefer.  \nAssuming the \"Logitech USB Headset\" is also an option that you see, click Logitech.  Now Logitech appears in the Speakers selection box.\n\n*Go to the bottom and SAVE.  This will tell Skype that you prefer Logitech Headset for your output speaker.  \nThis is how I corrected my Logitech Headset and Skype problem.  Works great now!\n", "Q: Where are the Apache and PHP log files? I've installed Apache, PHP, and MySQL on Ubuntu 10.10 desktop edition, and it's working fine.\nExcept I have no clue where to look for Apache or PHP log files.\n\nA: Check these settings in php.ini:\n\n\n*\n\n*error_reporting = E_ALL | E_STRICT (as recommended for development in php.ini)\n\n*error_log = /var/log/php_errors.log\n\n*Then create log file manually \ntouch /var/log/php_errors.log\nchown www-data: /var/log/php_errors.log\nchmod +rw /var/log/php_errors.log\n\nNow you can view PHP errors by this way\ntail /var/log/php_errors.log\n\nThis is an agreeable solution to this issue for me.\n\nA: By default, /var/log/apache2/error.log.\nThis can be configured in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini.\n\nA: You can also define a specific error log file for each VirtualHost in Apache. If you have any VirtualHost defined in /etc/apache2/sites-available/ and enabled in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled (enable with sudo a2ensite [your-virtualhost-definition-file]), you can change the error log by adding the following line inside your VirtualHost config:\nErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/[your-vhost]-error.log\n\nThat might be useful if you have a lot of vhosts and want to split where they report the errors.\nAlso, you can watch your error log live by issuing the following command (adapt to your own log file if different from the default):\nsudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log\n\nThis is particularly useful when doing live debugging.\n\nA: If Apache was setup with Webmin/Virtualmin there is a separate folder for each VirtualHost.\nIt is \n~/logs\nfolder for each VirtualHost user.\nThese are two files: \n~/logs/access_log\nand \n~/logs/error_log\nSo they are\n/home/onedomain/logs/access_log\n/home/onedomain/logs/error_log\n/home/anotherdomain/logs/access_log\n/home/anotherdomain/logs/error_log\n...\netc.\nTo view log files for each particular domain login as VirtualHost owner user of that hostname and run\ntail -f ~/logs/error_log\n\nA: If you use a bitnami distribution, it is at:\ntail /opt/bitnami/apache2/logs/error_log\n\nBitnami distributions have their own directory structure. I had to find what it was for my server, and this is where it resides by default for bitnami. I would assume lots of people are looking for the same thing when using a bitnami distribution.\nFor more info see here: https://docs.bitnami.com/bch/infrastructure/lamp/troubleshooting/debug-errors-apache/\n", "Q: Good and easy way to share files on local machine I would like to have a directory that has following properties: \n\n\n*\n\n*Many users can copy files into it \n\n*These files can be deleted/changed by these users (user A can delete/modify file that was copied into this directory) \n\n\nit cant be done using normal file permissions (because permissions are retained on copy).\nHere is what I found on the net: \n\n\n*\n\n*brainstorm idea\n\n*blueprint\nSome use cases: \n\n\n*\n\n*Sharing music on local machine \n\n*Simple git repository sharing (just make a bare repository writeable to many people) --- i know that there are solutions like gitosis\n\n*Allow many developers to modify test instance of php app without giving them root (i guess they would copy files) --- I'm leading a team of nonprofit junior developers and I need to keep that one simple! \n\n\nEDIT\nAFAIK setting SGID bit is not enugh, it only affects newly created files --- and basic workflow for these use cases ivnolves copying and other operations (which cleave file's gid unchanged) \n\nA: Access control lists\nThe straight answer is access control lists (ACLs). Yeah, you can find a counterexample, but they're good enough in practice (unlike mere group writability which requires that users think about it all the time). What they do require is that the system administrator (root) define the groups, if you want files to be shared only by a named group (root can choose to delegate, for example by accepting groups from LDAP, but that's another story).\nYou do need participating users to have a umask of 022. If they create non-world-readable files routinely, this scheme won't work. But if they have a restrictive umask, it's presumably because they don't want to share files anyway.\nEnabling ACLs\nUbuntu doesn't enable ACLs by default, so there's a one-time admin requirement. Edit /etc/fstab using your favorite editor, and change every line corresponding to a filesystem where you want to share files: add acl to the options. (Make sure not to change any other line, and not to use an editor that wraps long lines.) Here's an example line with the acl option added:\nUUID=5e1ec7ed-face-dead-beef-c011ec7ab1e5  /  ext4  errors=remount-ro,acl  0 1\n\nFor the option to take effect the first time, use a command like the following (for each filesystem):\nsudo mount -o remount,acl /\n\nInstall the ACL tools from the acl package.\nSetting up the shared directory\nTo have files shared by the group mygroup:\nsetfacl -m group:mygroup:rwx /path/to/shared/root\nsetfacl -d -m group:mygroup:rwx /path/to/shared/root\n\nIf people create files and copy them to the shared directory, the files will be world-readable (because of the umask) and anyone in the group can add and remove files (because the group is group-writable). People can't edit each others' files, but that's a good thing or you'd run into editing conflicts straight away.\nIf you don't have a unix group, you can add users one by one:\nsetfacl -m user:bob:rwx /path/to/shared/root\nsetfacl -d -m user:bob:rwx /path/to/shared/root\n\nVersion control\nIf you do want people to be able to edit files in place, you also need something to prevent editing conflicts. That's version control.\nYou don't need any of this to share a git repository. You know there are solutions like gitosis, so use them.\n\nA: Simply do this:\nmkdir /src/teamA\naddgroup teamA\nchgrp teamA /src/teamA\nchmod g+rws /src/teamA\n\nNow everybody in the teamA group can make everything inside /src/teamA\nThe magic is the sgid (set group id) bit on directory.\n\nA: If you want users to be able to access files in a shared folder (for example, different people log on to the same machine at different times and need access to the same files), you can use bindfs to create a shared directory.\nIt allows multiple local users to read and write (create, delete, rename, modify...) all files (including newly created ones) from a shared directory and its subdirectories. Each user will see the files and folders (including newly created ones) as belonging to them.\nBriefly, you run\nsudo bindfs -o perms=0700,mirror-only=user1:user2:user3 /home/shared /home/shared\n\nto make /home/shared available to user1, user2 and user3.\nInstructions\nSee Bindfs-SharedDirectoryLocalUsers (Ubuntu documentation) for full instructions, including setting it up permanently (every time you switch your computer on).\nI use this on my own machine for a number of directories, each with different sharing groups (one folder is available to all accounts, another only to work accounts, another only to personal accounts).\nFrom the post:\n\nbindfs is a FUSE filesystem for mounting a directory to another location (mountpoint), with permission settings. It allows you to specify the ownership and permissions of the files from inside the mountpoint.\n...\nThe main benefit is that the new files created in the shared directory will inherit the ownership & permissions.\n\nAccess control lists (ACLs)\nThe documentation notes:\n\nIf you want to set up more advanced permissions for different users and/or group try Access Control Lists.\n\nSee Gilles answer for more details.\n\nA: You could combine shellholic's solution with a cron job that updates the gid for all files in that folder every 15 seconds or something similar.\n", "Q: How do Nautilus media handlers work? Nautilus has options for what to do when media devices are added.\n\nHow does Nautilus know what applications to make available in these drop-down menus? \nHow do applications plug themselves in to this mechanism?\n\nA: From http://library.gnome.org/admin/system-admin-guide/stable/mimetypes-registering.html.en:\n\nRegistering applications to handle MIME types is fairly straightforward. Applications are registered by creating a MimeType key in their .desktop entry file and listing each MIME type separated by a semicolon. The MimeType key should only be used in .desktop files whose Type key has the value Application. For more information on .desktop files, see Section 2.3 ― Desktop Entry Files.\n\nNautilus gets this infomation from the mimeinfo.cache files located in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications and $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/ that are created by update-desktop-database.\n\nA: As far as I understand it this is handled by the MIME, the same thing that handles what application opens which files. system (sorry I don't have the full details).\nEDIT: DoR answered as I was typing.

When I want to attach a file (an image) with Evolution, it's very hard to pick the good file because thumbnails are way to small.\nHow can I make them bigger?\n\nA: Changing the size of thumbnails unfortunately is not (yet?) implemented in the Gtk File Chooser used here. Unless the application in question does not use another file chooser there will be not much change to this, I'm afraid.\nFrom Bugzilla bug #141154 there are some patches around now. Launchpad bug #137606 has state in progress.\n\nA: While this isn't directly related to the file chooser in Gnome, you can alternatively open a file browser to your Pictures folder and drag/drop into the composing email. This will allow you to zoom in with all the full functionality of the file browser. Evolution is fully drag/drop compliant.\n\nA: It's control and scroll up on your mouse or control shift =/+\nThis is because evolution isn't packaged with it's own file browser (like most apps), but uses Nautilus (or whatever your default is, again, like most apps).

It would be good to know that when you connect a USB device like a web-cam, it notifies me that it works or not.\n\nA: It's really surprizing for me that in 2014 we still don't have this feature working by default. It seems there are very little amount of people who needs this feature, but I really need it.\nFirst of all, I found udev-notify package, but unfortunately it almost doesn't work for me: it works for very little time (1-2 minutes), and then, if I connect/disconnect any device, it crashes:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"./udev-notify.py\", line 319, in <module>\n    notification.show()\nglib.GError: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name :1.1061 was not provided by any .service files\n\nI haven't found any solution, so I had to remove it. (filed bugreport also)\nThere're no similar utilities I've found so far. So I had to implement my own solution, it is probably not brilliant, but it works for me: it notifies me with sound and visual notification for any device that I plug/unplug. Title of the device is received via lsusb, so that if I plug some unknown device, at least I see its vendor_id:product_id. I like it.\nIt looks like this: \n\nInstallation details.\nTested on Ubuntu 12.04, Xubuntu 12.04, Xubuntu 13.04, Linux Mint 13. I believe it should work on other Ubuntu derivatives, and I hope it will work on any *nix system with udev.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to project page, get sources from there and put them somewhere. There's just one main script in it: my-udev-notify.sh, but archive also contains sounds for plug/unplug notifications, plus some more info, see readme.txt for details.\n\n*Create file /etc/udev/rules.d/my-udev-notify.rules with the following contents: (don't forget to modify path to your real path where you unpacked my-udev-notify.sh!)\n\n\n\n ACTION==\"add\",    RUN+=\"/bin/bash /path/to/my-udev-notify.sh -a add    -p '%p' -b '$attr{busnum}' -d '$attr{devnum}'\"\n ACTION==\"remove\", RUN+=\"/bin/bash /path/to/my-udev-notify.sh -a remove -p '%p' -b '$attr{busnum}' -d '$attr{devnum}'\"\n\n\nAfter this, it should work for newly attached devices. That is, if you unplug\nsome device, you won't get notification. But when you plug it back, you will.\n(yes, for me it works without any udev restarting. If it doesn't for you, try\nrebooting)\nTo make it work for all devices, just reboot your system. NOTE that there might\nbe many notifications during first boot (see known issues in the readme.txt). On second\nboot, there will be no notifications (unless you plug in new device when\nsystem is off)\nYou can customize it (turn on/off visual and sound notifications, or change sounds), check readme.txt in the archive for details.\n\nA: The libnotify-bin package includes a binary, notify-send which displays a notification. Here's an example of invoking it:\nnotify-send \"New USB device connected\" \"A new device has been connected: blah blah blah\"\nI believe you could craft a udev rule for \"add\" and for \"remove\" actions to trigger a small script which would invoke a notification. I haven't looked into this but I have seen similar scripts invoking encryption/mouting comands for storage devices.\nThe Guadalinex project also had this type of functionality[1] which they demo'ed in UDS Seville in 2005 (!), perhaps it would be easier to track down if they submitted their work upstream or if it's available as a separate package somewhere. Do NOT install the packages referred to in the Debian bug I am citing, this is only for reference purposes if anyone would decide to research it.\n[1] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=458405\n\nA: There are applets for the gnome-panel which will let you see plugged in devices and let you eject them. For e.g there is ejecter which is a applet lets you see mounted removable devices and lets you eject them. KDE has a ultra cool notification system letting you see what devices has recently been plugged in. You can try using the lsusb command to check whether your device has been detected or not. And if you are the adventurous type you can write your own udev rules.\n\nA: i dont believe there is such notification yet, (and right now i can't even seem to remember where to set up the notifications) i believe it may be very difficult to make a computer conclude wether or not a webcam works correct.\nwhen you insert a usb device it normally appears on your desktop, i believe you'll have to use the program you are planning to use with your webcam to find out if the webcam actually works.\nlets say skype, for an example, you can make a test to see if it works, without calling anybody (options - video devices - (then pretty obvious (that is if i remember it correct)))\ni hope this answers your question :-)\n", "Q: Two accounts on same computer - how can I make a share folder for both?

In fact, I have a lot of them, all created with the Tanuki Java Service Wrapper.\nIt would seem to me that there could be a simple template for wrapping such a shell script up as an upstart script, but a bit of googling is not revealing one.\nAm I missing something?\n\nA: I don't recall seeing a template for this.  Its a bit ironic, however, that technically, its upstart that is starting your init.d script in the first place thanks to the backward compatibility job rc and rcS.\nI would consider rewriting whatever you have as an upstart job, however, I know that some scripts are difficult to convert, so here's what I did for a while on some of my scripts:\ndescription \"xyz\"\nauthor \"xyz\"\nstart on runlevel 5\nstop on runlevel [!5]\n\npre-start script\n    # do my work here to start the service\nend script\n\npost-stop script\n    # do work here to stop the service\nend script\n\nNow depending on the nature of the service, whether it persists or forks itself, you may need to add expect fork or task to the job file.\nJust to complete the thought, usually, this is all there is to a full upstart job file anyway.  All of the pre start work is done, all of the cleanup is done, the only thing remaining is the service itself which is usually added with:\nexec service_cmd\n\n\nA: So one point of upstart jobs is to be simple to write.\nThere's a lot of shell script magic in init.d scripts that gets repeated over and over. Case statements, pidfile tracking, lsb comment lines. Its not very clear how to write a GOOD init.d script without having read one.\nIf you've already gone through the trouble of writing all of that, then you don't need an upstart job unless, as I mentioned in another comment, you depend on another upstart job/event.\nBut really, upstart does make things really simple. You shouldn't need a pre-start unless you need to set things up like tmpdirs, ulimits, or runtime arguments. You shouldn't need a post-stop unless you want to make sure you tidy up after a service (the service really should be cleaning up after itself on normal exit).\nOften times a giant init.d script with many options boils down to a 10 - 15 line upstart job. The most complex init.d scripts can have most of their logic dumped into pre-start's. The key there is that its just a little snippet of code to setup the environment for the process, and not logic on handling start/stop/respawn/etc.\nThe hardest part, and the one that people get wrong the most often, is knowing when to start/stop their job. start on runlevel [2345] seems logical, but ignores the fact that the network is coming up in parallel at that point, as are local filesystem mounts. The key is to try and figure out exactly the minimum things you need (other services, filesystems, network, etc) to get running, and start when those are done. Most traditional network services should do start on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE!=lo).\n\nA: I thought that Upstart maintains backward-compatibility with SysV-style init scripts in /etc/init.d. You should be able to just use your init scripts unchanged.\n", "Q: Unity Menu (Desktop design), how will it act? Is it known whether or not Unity will have the option to act like the current custom gnome menus (Applications, Places, System)? From what I've seen they've designed it to take up  the whole desktop when the menu is opened.\nAlso, the File, View, Edit menus, will it be possible to have them stay within the application itself rather than be displayed within the top panel?\n\nA: It is already known that you can choose whenever start your session using Unity or the 'good old' Gnome Desktop.\nThis is possible ( at least in the 11.04 Alpha 1 ) by selecting the Gnome Desktop in the session dropdown on the login screen.\n(In case your system has not graphic acceleration enabled ( i.e. compiz ) then the default session will be the old Gnome one.)\nAlso it is possible to remove the global menu behavior by removing the package indicator-appmenu ( there is not graphical settings up to now )\nAlso they assert that Unity launcher won't be moveable.\n( http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/12/ubuntu-unity-launcher-wont-be-moveable/ )\n", "Q: When I boot-up I get this dialog: \"Backup Failed: Failed with an unknown error\" \nBackup Failed\nFailed with an unknown error.  \n\nWhen I booted-up this morning I got a dialog which presented the above message and no other information!   \nThe dialog is \"helpful\" in that it tells me something is wrong, but I have no idea what it is referring to; so it isn't actually helpful.  \nWhat might be causing this \"backup\" error when I am starting the system?  \nI've restarted several times and keep getting the same message.  \nI checked the disks using System--Administration--Disk Utility via a Live-CD, and it reported no errors.\n\nI've just now noticed one tell-tale sign which is probably significant, but I don't know how to interpret it...  \nMy normal routine, with two of my drives (single partition per drive) is to manually mount them (via Nautilus)...

Occasionally, I want to boot directly off a USB stick or USB-connected portable HD and either by-pass the dual-boot GRUB loader or add a boot option for the bootable USB device(s).\nNote: The USB boot option is set as a higher prior than the HD option in the BIOS, and the USB devices boot as expected in a single OS environment. \nProblem: In a dual boot GRUB environment, the BIOS priority setting is essentially ignored.\nWhat is the best approach to booting off a USB device in this scenario, adding \"cdrom-detect/try-usb=true\" to an existing GRUB entry...or another solution?\n\nA: The BIOS priority setting is not ignored.  Your USB is likely registering as a HD in the BIOS - try reordering which HD device boots first (usually labelled USB-something) rather than setting USB to boot first.\n\nA: I don't think it has anything to do with dual-booting grub. I have Xp & Mint and I just tested setting USB as default boot entry and it worked. Maybe you should try restore BIOS setting and then give it another shot.\n\nA: The BIOS loads before grub, and it is the BIOS that selects the device to boot from, so it has nothing to do with grub.\nThat said, your usb device can register as a HDD (as another poster said). Quite often, you can press a button during the BIOS splash to select you boot device manually (often F12). I find this way easier, as it is the exception that I boot off a usb, and therefore don't want my computer to boot from it if I forget a usb key in there.\n", "Q: Unable to browse Windows 7 Notebook from Ubuntu I can see and connect to Ubuntu box from Windows 7 Laptop, but the Ubuntu box keeps telling me failed to retriever share list from server. \nThe laptop shows up in the list of computers in the workgroup but even when connecting by using the IP address, I get an error cannot display location \"smb://xxx.xxx.x.xx and Failed to retrieve share list from server ......\nPleas advise what could be wrong.

The following worked for me:\nsudo apt-get install exfat-fuse\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 (13.10 and higher)\nAdding additional ppas is no longer required. Also, it seems fuse-exfat is no longer installable. The package to install is now named exfat-fuse and is available by default (universe repository).

Also thanks to this answer\nsudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils\n\nUbuntu 12.04 (13.04 and lower)\nA more detailed, step-to-step description on how to use the PPA pointed to by StalkerNOVA can be found on stackoverflow, copied here for the sake of completeness:\nDo only once:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the repository: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:relan/exfat\n\n*Update the package list: sudo apt-get update\n\n*Install the exfat package: sudo apt-get install fuse-exfat\n\n*Create the mount folder: sudo mkdir /media/exfat\nEverytime you want to access sdxc the card/exfat filesystem:\n\n\n*Mount the filesystem (replace sdc1 with your exfat partition): sudo mount -t exfat /dev/sdc1 /media/exfat\nOn some devices, cameras, for locked sdxc cards etc you might want to mount the filesystem read only, just add -o ro to the mount command line: sudo mount -t exfat -o ro /dev/sdc1 /media/exfat\n\n*Read and write to /media/exfat to your heart's desire.\n\n*When you are done, unmount the filesystem: sudo umount /media/exfat\nThe sdc1 in the step-by-step above refers to the linux device where your card/exfat filesystem resides on. If this changes (usb card readers, cameras) or you simply don't know which one it could be either use the menu system System -> Administration -> Disk Util and usually you will find your camera or card reader in the list on the left hand side. Or - as a quick shortcut - use cat /proc/partitions on a terminal command line. The latter is only useful if you know all the other unchanging device names on your system and thus can quickly identify the one added one.\n", "Q: Listening to, and changing tracks on another PC on a LAN?

But I'm not sure on doing that. Any suggestions??\n\nA: At the moment, squid is listening on all of your network interfaces. If you change it to only listen on your internal network, then nobody on the internet will be able to connect. If you are only using it on a single machine, this is easy. Change the line\nhttp_port 3128\n\nto\nhttp_port 127.0.0.1:3128\n\nThis means squid will only listen on your localhost interface.\nIf you have other machines accessing the proxy with one network card for the internet and one for the internal network, you'd repeat the above change but substitute your internal network IP address for 127.0.0.1.\nThis is documented at http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/http_port/ - see the bottom paragraph.\nIt'd probably be worth checking that your firewall is running and configured as well - 3128 doesn't need to be visible to the outside world.\n", "Q: GUI tool to configure ldap client  I am using this wiki to configure LDAP client in Ubuntu. Now i am looking for a GUI tool to configure LDAP client in Ubuntu. Because my colleagues( They don't have much technical knowledge) often complains that configuring LDAP client in ubuntu is little difficult. Is there any simple GUI tool for this?.  \n\nA: There is the LDAP Administration Tool , available from the repositories.\n\nThere is also the GQ LDAP Client , but it's a bit older and (I'm going to be blunt) not as good. :)\n\nA: phpLDAPadmin\n(Also known as PLA) is a web-based LDAP client. It provides easy, anywhere-accessible, multi-language administration for your LDAP server.\nIts hierarchical tree-viewer and advanced search functionality make it intuitive to browse and administer your LDAP directory.

The command for it is:\nbash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )\n\nI know a little bit that the < is a command redirection operator (correct?).\nThen, why is the second < needed (what does it do)?\n\nA: It turns a string into the file descriptor for the output of the bash script that it represents. This might be confusing, here's an example\nif you type echo <(ls) it will open a new file descriptor, the name of which is substituted. So the command might turn into say echo /dev/fd/63. \nA program that expects a file can now read the output of the command without having to accept stdin.\n$ my_program ls\nError: 'ls': No such file or directory.\n$ my_program <(ls)\nmy_program was called with the argument /dev/fd/63\nbin dev etc ...\n\nMany Linux program will, if not provided with a source of input, wait for standard input. Because standard output can be piped to standard input with the \"| \" operator, you can then use say ls | grep hello. This only works because grep would've waited for input anway, if it'd expected a file name to open and read to get its data, the pipe operator doesn't work. This is why you need <(...).\nI hope this is intelligible. :-)\nTogether with the < operator to redirect the output of a file to a programs reading of stdin, this makes for the following meaning: \nBash: read the output from this file, which is created from the output of this command.\nClarifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*standard input: a \"file\" (not really, but in linux everything acts like a file) that, when read, magically contains what you've typed\n\n*standard output: a \"file\" that, when written to, will be printed to the virtual terminal\n\n*operator (i.e. < or <()): Same as in regular maths, expressions of operators and operands will be evaluated and substituted. 3+2*3 turns into 5*3 turns into 15. It's the same in the bash language.\n\n\nA nice example to emphasize Roger's point is this expression:\nif [ -f my_condition ] then something fi\n\nHere the contents of the brackets will be evaluated as a conditional statement, i.e. if my_condition is true, then do something. But: [ is actually just an alias of the program test, which, when called with the parameter -f, will check if a file exists.\n\nA: To clarify Stefano's point, the second < isn't just a <, it's actually <()\nYou may already be familiar with a similar construct, $() which produces a string that is the result of the command within it. So:\n$ which bash # echo the path to bash\n/bin/bash\n$ ldd $(which bash) # return which libraries bash is linked to\n...\n\nAfter the string substitution this is equivalent to\nldd /bin/bash\n\nAs Stefano says, <() does a very similar thing but instead returns a file descriptor.\nYou can find the bash documentation in man bash. As it's a huge man page, you can search (press /) for <\\( (you need to escape the open bracket - searching for <( won't work).\n", "Q: Where is the journal stored? I was reading trough the link on journaling-filesystems and i would like to know where exactly is the journal stored in my Harddisk.  \nSome pointers on this image  shown below\n\nThanks,\nSen\n\nA: There is no fixed place for the journal, each filesystem stores it in a different place.\nIf you are expecting it to be a regular file, then your are mistaken, it's more like a part of the filesystem structure like the inode table. The funny point is that ext3/4 treats it exactly like a regular file. It is usually found in the inode number 8, but  this is a kernel parameter that can be changed at compile time.\nIf you want to get technical, this article by Carlo Wood, written in March 2008, is a great read about the ext3 structure. \nIf you don't mind put journal in a place with words like partition table, inode or block and don't worry about it:\n\nA: The journal is stored in a separate space of the partition, you cannot access it directly. You can use sudo debugfs /dev/sda# where the # symbol is the number of your partition, and then using logdump in debugfs to print it out. The output is confusing though.\nGenerally, as a regular user, you don't need to know about the journal. Using ext3/4 will be sufficient to prevent data loss (in most cases).\nThis link might help: http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/red-hat-fedora-linux/121074-ext3-journal.html\n", "Q: How to define a secondary IP address that is down by default I can define a secondary IP address on the same network card by adding the lines\nauto eth0:1\niface eth0:1 inet static\n        address 192.168.9.101\n        ...\n\nto /etc/network/interfaces. \nThis gives me an IP address that I can turn on or off using ifup and ifdown.

I never saw the point of that.).\nFinally, if at some point you change your mind and decide this secondary IP to be available by default, you can do that in /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet ...\n    ... whatever you have there already for eth0 ...\n    up ip addr add 192.168.9.101/32 dev eth0 \n\n", "Q: Apt-get with no HTTP/FTP access Is it possible to install packages using apt-get install without having HTTP access? In other words, can apt-get install packages from a small local repository?\nI know I can use sudo dpkg -i deb_file to install a package, but this will install only one package at a time and it will fail if the dependencies are not met. This will be a problem if I want to install a package that has many dependencies even if I already have all the required .deb files.\n\nA: The common work-around is to put your .deb files into /var/cache/apt/archives/. Then any apt-get install will look for the files in that cache first, and then try to download them if they are not there.\nAlternatively, you can dpkg -i *.deb to install all packages in the current directory.\n\nA: If you are looking to install standard Debian packages you could use apt-zip that allows you download packages offline and transfer them onto the machine on some sort of removable media. I haven't really used it for a number of years but when I had a slow network connection at home it was a very useful tool.\n\nA: You can use apt-offline or apt-offline-gui.\nPre-requistes: A friend's system with Internet connection. apt-offline installed in both your systems.\nThe Offline installation is achieved in 3 simple steps.\nStep 1:\nGenerate a signature file on the Disconnected Debian box at home\napt-offline set /tmp/apt-offline.sig\nThe above command will generate all information required from apt about updating its database.\nStep 2:\nDownload data based on the signature file generated earlier\napt-offline get C:\\apt-offline.sig --threads 5\nThe above command will download data as mentioned in the signature file. To speed up downloads (that can be from multiple apt repositories), in this example we spawn 5 download threads.\nOnce completed, you could just copy the data (an archive file, if you used the --bundle option) back to the removable medium and copy it back onto your offline host.\nStep 3:\nOnce you're back upon the home Debian machine, you feed the data from the removable medium to apt-offline:\napt-offline install /media/USB/apt-offline.zip\nThis will update the APT database on your disconnected machine seamlessly.\nApt-offline can be even used in Windows systems. In my opinion, apt-offline is the best option for Offline installation.\nSource\n", "Q: How to auto mount a flash drive with root and read/write/execute privileges I have an issue with mounting my Flash drive on Ubuntu 10.04 with write privileges.

What's a shell, their importance, types and functions?\n\nA: *\n\n*Shell works as interpreter of user commands and translates them into action.\n\n*The shell forms the outer part of the operating system and forms the interface between the user and the kernel.\n\n*For each user logged in, there is shell in action. When a command is given by the user, it is examined by the shell and communicated to the kernel for execution.\n\nA: In a nut shell, it's a command-line interface. You can issue commands and do stuff. Read here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)\n\nA: To make it easy to understand, think of the kernel as the snail, and the \"shell\" as it's shell. You can pick the snail up by the shell, because it is the point of simple, easy, and straightforward access. Similarly on a computer, a shell provides you with simple, straightforward access. Shells can come in different shapes/sizes just like a snail shell. For example, bash is a text-based shell, where as GNOME (as a whole) is a graphical shell, making it easy for most computer users to access the kernel, system libraries, and applications (the snail).\n\nA: There is an important (well...) distinction:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal: The program you use to gain access to the command line interface\n\n\n*\n\n*This would be something like gnome-terminal, it allows the user to type in commands, set the font size and so on. In the early days of UNIX, these were physical machines.\n\n\n*Shell: The program running atop the command line, like Bash, Dash, Zsh..\n\n\n*\n\n*A good shell like bash allows you not just simply to run programs, but to script them, use complex arguments, pipe output from one program to the input of another one and so on.\n\n\n\nI've recently written something about the command line in general in the Tag-Wiki for the command-line tag. \nThe command-line interface (CLI) is a way of interacting with the operating system or software by typing text commands into a Terminal.\n\n\"Under Linux there are GUIs (graphical\n  user interfaces), where you can point\n  and click and drag, and hopefully get\n  work done without first reading lots\n  of documentation. The traditional Unix\n  environment is a CLI (command line\n  interface), where you type commands to\n  tell the computer what to do. That is\n  faster and more powerful, but requires\n  finding out what the commands are.\"\n  from man intro(1)\n\nSome users prefer using the command line for some tasks because\nit saves them time and effort. They also benefit from being able to create\nscripts to automate common tasks, and they can use the command line to\nconfigure their operating system on a very low level to exactly fit their\nneeds.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu community documentation has a General introduction to the Command Line.\n\n*There is also a longer, more in-depth  Command Line How-To.\n\n\n\nIf you'd like to learn a bit about it's history and inner workings, people seem to be happy with my answer to question from fred.bear on the subject. \n\nA: This can be useful: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal\n", "Q: How to run multiple user X sessions on the same computer, at the same time?

Only want to forward local email and looking for something dead simple. Thank you! \nClarification:\nI see that ssmtp and nullmailer are suggested, but I need something (just a) little more clever. I have one machine (machine.domain1.com) where I want local mail to be delivered at realuser@domain2.com and I want it delivered through direct connection to mx.domain2.com \nSo when I do mail root on machine1.com it should get forward to realuser@domain2.com. Issue with nullmailer and ssmtp is that forwarding is done to mx.domain2.com but mail is delivered with a RCPT TO set to root@domain1.com and I want the RCPT TO set to realuser@domain2.com\nPossible with a simple solution or do I need to digg into postfix or exim for this? \n\nA: There's certainly no shortage of MTAs in Linux, nor in Ubuntu. As the most full-featured (and possibly overblown) solution, you can use postfix to relay emails to a provider - i.e. all the emails it receives will be sent via that SMTP server. Here is a tutorial with details for Google Mail.\nA more lightweight, and more simple alternative is nullmailer, although I'm not sure if it is capable of using all the secure transport methods required for Google Mail.\nFinally, the easiest solution seems to be ssmtp. The setup is described here.\n\nA: It doesn't get much simpler than nullmailer \n. Although the mail will have to be sent to real addresses as nullmailer only forwards to a smart MTA.\n", "Q: Mistaken dist-upgrade, is this bad? I was looking for Update Manager on Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook Edition and couldn't find it, so in Terminal I did:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nI got a message saying some packages were \"held back\" and searching online gave me the suggestion to do:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nSo I did that and it updated my kernel and now uname -a says I have 2.6.35-23-generic #40-Ubuntu SMP.  My system is still working normally, but I'm now second-guessing if I did the right thing.  Was this kernel update meant for the next version of Ubuntu?  Should I try to back it out?\n\nA: The only difference between apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade is that dist-upgrade will install new packages or remove installed packages if that is necessary to fulfil package dependencies, while upgrade will hold back packages whose dependencies can't be fulfilled by just upgrading.\nSo if there are some hold back packages usually apt-get dist-upgrade is The Right Thing To Do. \nBut it's a good idea to first have a look on what it wants to do, especially if you are using unofficial packages sources like PPAs or apt-get dist-upgrade wants to remove packages.\n\nA: dist-upgrade has some advanced package dependency resolution that is used (possibly needed) when a package changes it's major version. \nUpdates, for example, will always keep your version of OpenOffice 1.x up to date, but as soon as the distribution switches to OpenOffice 2.x, a dist-upgrade will be needed to resolve some more complicated issues.\nSo: You didn't do anything wrong. If you want, you can always do sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. It happens automatically if needed (via Update Manager), but you may invoke it manually to your hearts content. \nSafe for errors in the repository apt is pretty much bullet proof these days. :)\n", "Q: How can I exclude all the svn metadata while synchronizing with unison?

Thanks!\n\nA: The code to show something only in XFCE follows the same idea: \nShowOnlyIn=XFCE;\n\nHere are all the \"ShowOnlyIn\" possibilities:\nhttp://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apb.html\nUnfortunately, as far as I know, the way XFCE stores it's .desktop files is the same as the way GNOME stores them, whereas KDE stores them in a separate folder (within /usr/share/applications).  This is why the separation of KDE/GNOME, as described in the post you link to, is much easier to do en-mass.\nAll the files are stored in /usr/share/applications.  The format of them is very simple, and you can copy any one of them to /home/you/.local/share/applications and it will override that menu entry for that user so you can more easily edit them without needing root privileges.\nThere is no simple way to separate XFCE apps from GNOME, especially since it's often a matter of opinion what you want to see.  This also goes for KDE, since as long as you have the KDE libraries Dolphin, Konquorer, etc. will run in GNOME.\nI suppose if you're intent on using the cmd line you could come up with some grep/sed junk to selectively find and replace text inside certain .desktop files, but I think the easiest way would be to copy the files you want to edit to ~/.local/share/applications so they don't get overwritten by updates and edit them by hand.  Unless you've got a gazillion things installed it shouldn't be too difficult to cherry pick what you want.\nAs a side note, editing .desktop files is annoyingly difficult when using Nautilus.  You either have to drag and drop them into a text editor, open them through the command line or write a Nautilus script that directs the file to a text editor.  Other file managers do not suffer this problem, so I guess it's a bug.  Also, a .desktop file has a different name when it's executable, which can also be confusing, since it's not the actual name of the file.\nThe menu works under the freedektop.org specification, which you can learn more about here: \nhttp://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/index.html\nEDIT: I forgot about this when I originally answered this question and it's a pretty significant caveat.  This only works when using the correct panels/menus.  For example, if you're using xfwm with the GNOME panel you will see the all the \"ShowOnlyIn=GNOME\" items and vice versa.  Just thought I'd throw that in there for anyone this is not working for :)\n", "Q: What software do you recommend to manage TV Series? I need a software to manage Tv Series, i.e rename episodes ( using TvRage or other providers ) and flagging episodes as watched in order to know which episodes I have not watched yet.\nDo you know something like that?\n\nA: Another option you can use is GCstar it covers the options you need. Another possibilty is Griffith but it is geared more towards small video store use films/renting.\nMore Info about gcstar \nMore Info About griffith\nBoth are avaliable in the Software Center.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I would recommend XBMC using the XBMC standalone package. We've got loads of TV series on our server, with the only right part of the filename being the \"season-episode\" labels (S01E09) and XBMC picks them up right away.\nI could go on but that's the only part relevant to the conversation.\n\nA: You might want to try boxee. It's quite a big program if you only use it for Series though...\n\nFeatures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mark Episode as viewed (automatically)\n\n*Show data about Episodes (description, name of episode)\n\n*Automativally scan for and classify episodes in specified folders (only work for some naming conventions, but it's possible to manually classify them)\n\n*List episodes you didn't download but that are available online (so you can stream them)\n\n\nHowever, it does not rename any files and its a media-center software, not a series manager (so you can view episodes directly in the program).\nTo rename your files you could use krename. But krename is for general files, it does not get any info from tvrage or similar.\n\nA: You may try wxSeasons. This isn't a well-developed app, but it may do something good to you.\n", "Q: Hide 'Your profile could not be opened correctly' I have a small public internet cafe, with Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10.

I am able to get them into the Audiobooks category by dragging them over, but that still appear in Music, and when I try to remove them from the Music library, they are also removed from Audiobooks. How can I get them to appear only in Audiobooks?\nNB: They are kept in a separate audiobooks folder, away from the music.\n\nA: Instead of importing directly, drop them in the audiobooks folder and then rescan your media library for banshee to find them.\n\nA: Ok, this sorted itself when I restarted Banshee.

The situation with TRIM in Ubuntu has me utterly confused. I don't know whether I need to manually run it or not. Sources I've found are disparate and unclear.\nI have Ubuntu 10.04 with latest updates (including kernel 2.6.32-26). I have an Intel X-25M drive with latest firmware, and it is formatted as ext4.\nSo, does TRIM support run automatically? If not, how do I check if I need to run it, and then how do I run it if necessary?\n\nA: The Linux kernel supports TRIM as of version 2.6.33.\nSo the answer is: Yes, Linux, in it's latest version, supports TRIM out of the box. Ubuntu 10.04 doesn't though.\nThe question is whether the feature will be back ported to 2.6.32 or 10.04 will get an update to 2.6.33+. (see João Pinto's answer)\nOf course your SSD has to support it as well. There are also still some issues with some specific SSDs (I think the Indilinx ones may still be a bit wonky for example). The SSDs firmware has to implement everything properly - but, I understand, some SSDs implement TRIM in a way that isn't really conform with the ATA standard. Or at least in a buggy way.\nThe first generation X-25M from Intel doesn't support trim \"Properly\" (or not at all - strictly speaking). The second generation Intel X-25M G2 does. I don't know whether the latest firmware adds proper TRIM, the Intel website keeps mentioning it's \"Optimised for Windows 7\", which could mean it's bolted on as a software feature in the windows driver, and that the disk doesn't do it on it's own because Intel left their homework on the bus again :-)\n\nA: TRIM support was introduced in Linux 2.6.33 (Ubuntu 10.10), however it is unlikely that Ubuntu 10.04 will ever receive TRIM support. Once acquired, TRIM support must be activated through FSTab.\n\nA: I see the following pieces in the description of 2.6.32-39 update:\n\n\n*\n\n*sata_mv: fix broken DSM/TRIM support (v2)\n\n\n*\n\n*LP: #644694\n\n\n*ext4: make trim/discard optional (and off by default)\nI assume this means that it is now supported.\n\nA: According to this bug report TRIM is not supported with the Ubuntu kernel in Ubuntu Lucid (10.04). \nAll newer versions of Ubuntu come with a kernel which supports TRIM but you will have to manually activate it if you are using the ext4 file system (default). \n\nA: It looks like this went in Ubuntu-2.6.32-9.13 as commit 9f3979ef, back in Dec of 2009, so has been available in lucid since it was released.\nYou do of course, need to mount with the discard option to enable it.\n", "Q: How do I kill Empathy and get it to show its main window? Empathy shows up in my window picker list and it appears to be started according to the indicator applet and the process manager but I can't see any of its windows! People were sending me messages and there was no empathy window to switch to!\n\nA: Did you try clicking \"Chat\" in the messaging menu (the little envelope icon next to the clock)? It should show the contacts list from where you can open any hidden message windows and change the settings concerning hiding and showing of windows.\n\nA: To get empathy to properly exit by killing processes from the command line, you first need to kill telepathy and telepathy-butterfly processes, then kill the empathy process(es). \n\nA: Run killall empathy, or open the System Monitor and kill it from there.\n\nA: Empathy shows that it is running in the indicator applet.\nYou can click the applet and select \"Chat\" to open empathy, or you can simply run the launcher (I tend to do this as I'm using Gnome Do). The shortcut to the indicator applet is meta-m (meta is the windows-key).\nTo close Empathy, either press ctrl-q while having the main window focused, or run killall empathy in a terminal.\n", "Q: How to check a mounted filesystem for errors in a reliable way Following this question:\nForce fsck.ext4 on reboot, but really \"forceful\"\nApparently the output of e2fsck -n is not reliable when you use it on a mounted filesystem, so its output should not be trusted.\nIs there any way to check for errors in a mounted filesystem? Just check, not fix.\nI am more interested in ext4, because that's what I use the most.\n\nA: Because of the way that most Linux file systems work you simply cannot do a safe/useful check on a mounted file system. It's not really safe, and because the system is in use, it can be unreliable. Sadly, sometimes, you have to live with things the way they are until someone does it better ;). Ext4 probably won't pick up this feature (maybe ext5? if it ever happens) but I believe btrfs will, and if it does, you will be able to switch your partitions over when the time comes.\n\nA: if it is an LVM volume then you can take a snapshot of the volume and then run fsck on the snapshot to see whether the filesystem is in a recoverable state.  That's not the same as checking whether it currently is in a consistent state.  However it is close enough for almost all intentions.  When you're done, drop the snapshot.\n", "Q: Desktop load (Gnome or Netbook edition) jams after upgrading to 2.6.35 kernel After upgrading to 2.6.35 kernel, my netbook jams and I need to press the Enter key many times to resume the desktop load (Gnome or Netbook edition.\nHow to diagnose the problem and identify the root causes?

There's the open document format (ODF) for word processors, but is there an open standardised format for project files? I'm currently using Gnome Planner which I downloaded from the Software Centre, but my course teaches us to use OpenProj, which I don't really like since it's pretty sluggish on my computer. I'm attempting to import the *.planner file from Planner into OpenProj, but it's not working. Planner exports to three different file format: *.planner, *.mrproject and *.html and none of them can be imported to OpenProj, whose default filetype is *.pod and can also export to *.xml and *.pdf. This all seems a bit messy to me.\n\nA: A visit to http://www.osalt.com yielded a link to GanttProject. Among the features listed on their website is the ability to \"import projects from and export them to Microsoft Project formats [and] export to spreadsheets with CSV.\"\nI have no experience with this type of software but osalt.com would always be my first stop for a question like this.\n\nA: http://sourceforge.net/projects/openproj/\n\nOpenProj is an open-source desktop project management application similar to Microsoft Project. OpenProj has a familiar user interface and even opens existing MS Project files. OpenProj is interoperable with Project, Gantt Charts and PERT charts. \n\n\n\nA: ProjectLibre is an actively maintained fork of openproj that is able to open .planner files.\n", "Q: Will the deleted browser history be stored in File-system? I would like to know if the history of urls i browse with my Firefox browser, which i have cleared, will be stored in the file system or not? \nTo be more clear, will the history be stored in some place in the hard-disk, even if the history is deleted from the browser menu(delete history option)?  \nIf yes, Can i retrieve those details?  \nThanks,\nSen\n\nA: Unfortunately (I'm guessing you were hoping to recover?) this information is completely deleted when you clear it. The way linux filesystems (most of them, such as ext4) work, the data is actually deleted, though not wiped. You would not be able to retrieve this data yourself. Maybe someone who is an expert in file recovery could potentially recover the data.\nThere is an option for you to backup your history, but I would suggest you ask a new question for that (if that is what you are hoping to do in the future, as you did not state it).\n", "Q: How to cancel the currently-applied remaining sudo time-out? When I've just run sudo, and don't want it to remain active for the normal duration of its time-out, how can I cancel that remaining active time-out?   \nsudo -k  kills it for the current terminal session, but if a process is currently running in that session and so can't run sudo -k, is there a way to cancel it from another terminal session? \nAnd is there a way to cancel all currently applied sudo times (for all terminal sessions, and all gksudo running apps, etc?\nAlthough, come to think of it, a running GUI may simply need to be shut down, but I just checked that Alt+F2 keeps gksu active for subsequent invocations.\n\nA: Not sure if you mean to kill a sudo timeout so it doesn't timeout or so it times out immediate, but if you want to remove the remaining timestamp you can use sudo -k\nOtherwise,if you're trying to cancel a timeout so sudo doesn't timeout, I don't think that is possible to do in a current session.  The only way I know of would be to change the timestamp_timeout in the sudoers file and restart the session.\n\nA: I found a solution. since my search didn't show anything alike and this is a frequent question: sudo stores somewhere on the filesystem (for example in /var/run/sudo), one directory per user-name, several files that work as the time-stamp, one file for each terminal. delete those files and your system is secure again. just keep in mind that those files are only visible to root (otherwise an intruder might read the time-stamp and set clock-time back to a point where they still were valid -- granting root-ls to anyone is dangerous). therefore in my /etc/pm/sleep/ and maybe also for the screensaver I run:\nrm -f /var/db/sudo/*/*\n\nas root of course...\n\nA: Just on one of your points:\n\nbut if a process is currently running\n  in that session and so can't run sudo\n  -k\n\nThis is specific to the command line, if you want to do anything while some other process is running, you can press Ctrl+Z to pause the process; you then get access to the current terminal again, do anything you like. When you're done, you can type jobs to get a list of processes, with a number beside them. Type fg 1 (for example - and simply fg if there's only one job) to restart a process, raising it to the foreground. Similarly, bg to do the same thing but leaving the process running in the background. \nExample session\n$ sudo apt-get install hello\n<CTRL+Z>\n[1]+  Stopped    sudo apt-get install hello\n$ sudo -k\n$ jobs\n[1]+  Stopped    sudo apt-get install hello\n$ fg 1\nLoading database...\n....\n\n\nA: This can't be done. The parent sudo process will terminate when its child does, and terminating the parent will terminate the children.\nAlso terminating it externally doesn't make any sense, as you can't really know at which point the program will be terminated. The program flow would be unpredictable.\n", "Q: Getting network manager on the gnome panel I've just installed 10.10 from a minimal iso.

I would like to know, what is the difference between initrd and initramfs?  \n\nA: *\n\n*initrd was block device based, initramfs is file base.\n\n*with initrd, you created a file system image. with initramfs, you create an archive with the files which the kernel extracts to a tmpfs.\n\nA: Initrd is deprecated, replaced by Initramfs, which doesn't have some of the weaknesses of initrd:\n\n*\n\n*Initrd requires at least one file system driver be compiled into the kernel\n\n*A disk created by Initrd has got to have a fixed size\n\n*All of the reads/writes on Initrd are buffered redundantly (unnecessarily) into main memory\n\nI think that's all.\n\n\nHow does this update-initramfs command generate /boot/initrd.img?\n\nIt makes the necessary files into a cpio archive, which is a binary archive format (very similar to tar, not extensively used in Linux) and then uses gzip to compress that archive. Gzip is not an archive itself, just a compression (which is why you get .tar.gz archive files).\nAt boot time, the archive is uncompressed and unpacked onto a   ram-disk.\nAlso see: How a computer boots\n", "Q: What is the minimum size of the LAMP server? I installed server 10.10 with LAMP+OpenSSH. It is about 1.1GB. Can I reduce the total size of the server?\nAFTER SOME EXPERIMENTS\nThe full LAMP server is under 1.0gb\n/dev/sda1             7.5G  914M  6.3G  13% /\n\nIt contains PHP/Mysql/Apache and Gearman-job-server with PHP support + libFAM\n\nA: First off, consider using 32-bits if you are space conscious. The binaries are smaller, as is the memory footprint, and if you have a small disk footprint system, its likely you won't even have 4GB of RAM to take advantage of the 64-bit memory management.\nIf you just choose the \"LAMP Server\" task then base system + all of that can be a lot.

Whenever I start my computer Ubuntu pops up the following error:\nA hard disk may be failing\none or more hard disk report health problems\n\nA friend of mine ran some test and it was found that my hard disk has 74 bad sectors.\nIs this merely a software issue that will be solved after a complete format of my hard disk, or is it a hardware issue and I will have to replace my hard disk?\nAwaiting your responses.\nThanks,\nSneha Kamath.\n\nA: Before doing anything I strongly recommend you backup everything. Else in the not unlikely case your disk really crashes everything will be lost. Only after a backup you should further check for hardware defects including the use of proprietary tools from your disk manufacturer.\n\nA: You'll see this message when a hard disk's S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) status begins to report a failure.\nModern disks have a set of tests and benchmarks as part of their S.M.A.R.T. profile and operating systems perform quick tests on them occasionally. When certain tests fall below their specified operating values, this is usually a sign that the disk is getting old and that its performance will likely quickly continue to deteriorate to the point where you suffer data loss or it just packs up and dies.\nYou can verify this through Disk Utility (sitting in System -> Administration). Find the disk, click SMART Data and you'll see a list of tests. Not all tests are performed automatically so you can manually set it to run a full test cycle but as soon as you see bad sectors or tests that are failing really poorly, the disk is as good as dead.\n\nObviously data loss is horrible so I can't recommend anything but moving everything off the disk right away. There is nothing to be gained from hanging onto the disk until it pops. It's better to be in control of the situation than have it jump on you when you're not expecting it.\nI wouldn't even attempt a low-level format. If it's failing now, it's much more likely to start getting sector corruption in the future. In my mind, it's just not worth the risk.\nNote: If it's still under warranty and you send it back, you will almost always (99.999% of times) get a different drive sent back. Diagnosing single drives is much more expensive than just bulk-refitting them. As a result you'll lose all your data in the process so get your data off now.\n\nA: At first, as already suggested, please back up your data immediately, for example by using a Ubuntu Live CD and an external hard drive.  \nIf your friend did use a tool like badbocks and discovered corrupted blocks on the hard drive (HDD), than it is likely that your HDD is going to fail in the near future. \nThere are several options you have: \n\n\n*\n\n*Continue using the HDD till is does not work at all anymore (NOT recommended)\n\n*After backing up ALL of your hard drive data get a copy and burn Ultimate Boot Disk. Boot from the burned CD and look for the Hard Drive Utils section and look for the vendor of your HDD (e.g. Samsung, Seagate, Hitachi, etc...). Start the vendor specific tool and perform a low level format of your HDD (all data will be erased). Check again for bad blocks using the vendor's tool or badblocks. With this option you might extent the life of your HDD.\n\n*Buy a new hard drive and and clone the old one by using an Ubuntu Live CD and the programm dd. It is actually quite simple once the Live CD is running (check google for \"clone hdd with dd\"). Replace the cloned HDD with your old one and continue working as before. Very effective method with little hazzle.\nI recommend option 3. I have done it this way several times.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Glassfish warning when i try to open an existing Java Project the project itself is located in my home-directory, netbeans and glassfish each installed to opt. when i start IDE and open java project i get following warning five times:\n/opt/glassfish-3.0.1/glassfish/domains/domain1/config/wss-server-config-2.0.xml (Permission denied)\nthanks guys\n\nA: What is the permission of the glassfish and netbeans folder in opt? You can verify that with: \nls -l /opt/\n\nDepending on the result you might need to change the ownership of the folder to your username. You can do that with the following commands: (replace username with your username, and press tab to autocomplete versions of the software)\nsudo chown username.users /opt/glassfish-<TAB>\nsudo chown username.users /opt/netbeans-<TAB>\n\n\nA: I tried renaming the folder nbproject in the project folder, which worked.

The two computers are physically next to each other, so what I want to do is connect them together with a cable and then synchronize. How do I do this, and what sort of cable would I need?\n\nA: If you connect the two with a cross-over RJ-45 cable (give them IP addresses in the same range, like 192.168.0.10/255.255.255.0 and 192.168.0.11/255.255.255.0), then use a tool like Unison (in the respositories), you should be able to synchronise what you like.\nsudo apt-get install unison-gtk\nThis method needs that \"special\" cross-over cable, but removes the need for a hub or switch and certainly, there's no need for a router or internet access.\n\nA: The network-manager lets you connect computers together directly. If you right-click on its icon and select 'edit connections', you can select 'auto eth0' under the tab and click on the 'edit' button. The 'IPv4 Settings' tab in the window has a box labelled 'method', from it you can select 'shared to other computers.' If you do this to one computer and connect the other to it (no crossover cable needed), it will act like a router and you should be able to transfer files by whatever method that way. It will also share its wireless internet connection (if it has one) to the other computer. I don't know if you have to change it back to connect normally.\nThis is what I use to connect my laptop to the old desktop I use to hold my backups, your mileage might vary though. I usually use avahi and an ftp server to connect, but this requires files to be transferred manually, Unison should suit your purposes better.\n", "Q: Touchpad too slow -- how do I adjust it?

I'm wanting to get some of the new features in Rhythmbox 0.13.2 on my aging Ubuntu laptop w/out having to upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu.  I'm currently at 9.10.\nOne option for installing the new version of Rhythmbox is to uninstall the package I have then install the tarball in /usr/local and then figure out which dependencies I need to install.  I'd rather use the package management system to manage the dependencies.\nThis may be an elementary question, but is installing the tarball and looking for the dependencies my only option here?  Or can I somehow get the .deb from a repository and install that instead?\n\nA: Unfortunately this method you are looking to use would cause you more headache than anything else. The dependencies are going to be many, and the more you add, the more you have to upgrade other things. Eventually you will be better off upgrading your system.\nInstalling from the deb is safer, but it could also cause breakage even if you use the --force-all option to install. My humble suggestion is that you upgrade (yes I know you don't want to, but if you want the latest, you'll have to do that).\n", "Q: How to open files which are located in VirtualBox's Guest Machine from Netbeans of Host Machine I have Ubuntu 10.04 installed in my Host Machine and it has VirtualBox.

But I could not find any way to open those files from Netbeans.\nCould anybody give me advice about how can I do that please? \nUPDATE\nI forgot to say that I don't want to use SharedFolders. \n\nA: There's a much easier way. Just store your project in a shared folder. Set up shared folders using these instructions and keep your source code there. Now you can access the files in Ubuntu using any method you want.\n\nA: try looking into shared folders in vbox. It would basically allow you to share files without the need for samba/ssh/ftp.\n\nA: If I understand if right ssh is working\nYou can navigate to any folder in the Guest Machine with Nautilus (press CTRL+L and type ssh:/ip/folder/folder in the address bar) or connect to it selecting \"Connect to server\" from the file menu.\nAfter doing that the remote filesystem will be mounted under ~/.gvfs.

This doesn't happen with Windows. I've done my research, and found out that it may be a problem with the graphics card - I've got an ATI RADEON XPRESS 1100. Quite a lot of people have noted that it may be a problem with Ubuntu not being able to handle power management properly with this graphics card. Also, I am not running any CPU-intensive or memory-intensive programs - when I go to Preferences > System Monitor, the memory usage is only around ~250-400 megabytes and the CPU usage hardly ever goes above 20.\nMy laptop is an ASUS X51RLseries laptop, by the way. I'm also just trying Ubuntu at the moment - does this have anything to do with the abnormally high fan temperature? When I actually install Ubuntu on a separate partition (so that I can dual boot both Windows and Ubuntu), will the temperature and fan loudness decrease? On Windows, my Hard Drive temperature at the moment is 41 degrees Celsius, and my CPU temperature is 53 degrees Celsius. This is normal for me, and it may increase or decrease slightly depending on the amount of work I am putting on my laptop.\nI'm quite a newb at Ubuntu yet, so if you could explain instructions clearly to me then I would greatly appreciate it. I know how to do basic stuff, but if you are very detailed then that would be very helpful. If there's anything I've missed or if you need to know anything else, then please let me know. Thanks.\n\nA: I have a ATI card and it get's really hot running Ubuntu with the normal open sourde ATI drivers. Installing the official drivers and set them to minimum the laptop runs normal.\n\nA: I'm just a n00b to these forums (and Ubuntu as well) but I was suffering the same problem with my Gateway 7330gz laptop.  It would get so hot (80 C) that it would automatically shut down.\nI also read the forum posts on this subject and someone suggested cleaning the interior with canned air and getting rid of the dust bunnies.  Everybody else in the forum wanted a fix for their cards - new drivers, other software, whatever - I blew out the dust through the fan vents et voila! my temps dropped form the 60s to the 50s in a hot minute.  I've replicated the scenarios that caused the laptop to overheat and I haven't hit 75 since I chased the bunnies back to their hutch.\nSo if you've got some canned air around....\n\nA: From my understanding your problem does not regard overheating but fan speed.\nIf the fan is spinning too fast then is as well more loud ( but the system is not heater, quite the contrary ). Infact if the temperature of the air that is drained from your notebook is higher that means that the PC temperature is cooler :)\nYou can try to adjust the fan speed either by the bios of your PC ( if permitted ) or with the help of lm_sensors package ( that you can find in the Ubuntu Software Center ).\nhttp://www.lm-sensors.org/\n\nA: Regarding temperature issue:\n1. Verify if there are any CPU-consuming processes by use of standard System Monitor.\n2. Install Gnome Sensor Applet, which works well with most of nowadays laptops. \nEven little fluctuations of CPU load may provoke an overheating. So try to figure out if laptop's fan is functioning in Ubuntu.

That's okay, I'm happy with that.  \nHowever, when I manually unmount it (via the context menu in Nautilus), it  asks me \"Do you want to empty the trash befoe you unmount?\" ... and this only started happening today, after 2 months of daily use...\nNow, it could be that I've never had trash on this drive before today... it is possible, as I often do a Shift+Delete, and I don't do a manual unmount every day...  \nI was a bit surprised by this dialog, and wonder \"Why?\" (because Trash is typically a place which is manually maintained).   \nAlso, how do I prevent this prompt from appearing?\n\nA: On mounted volumes Nautilus does not move the trashed files to your main trash directory in your home folder as that wouldn't make much sense for huge files.  \nNext time you trash something hit Ctrl+H or select View Hidden Files from the menu.  You will notice a .Trash folder lingering in your mounted drive.  \nThe file is actually still on the drive until you permanently remove it.  I guess it's just Nautilus' way of helping you keep things tidy, especially since you might be hooking the drive to other OSes.\nI suppose a way to suppress the dialog would be to create your own trash/temp folder on each drive and move the files you want to trash but not delete just yet there.  You could make Nautilus scripts/actions to point the files to your new folder.  Since the files would be on the same drive there would be no overhead (i.e., the move would be instant/not cost any cpu) and you wouldn't be bothered by dialogs.  I personally have a small (2GB partition) I use as a temp/share with Windows area for misc. odds and ends.  I find it works quite well to get thinks out of the way.  Of course that is not practical for big stuff, but you get the idea :)\n\nA: It sounds like what is essentially happening is that the trashed files are probably keeping opened files from the filesystem you're trying to unmount.You can try using lsof to find out what is preventing the unmount.Something like lsof | grep /the/mountpoint of the device.Nautilus can be misleading though sometimes, because it may be mounting somewhere else than expected.\nTo get rid of this problem Open your SATA hard-drive and press Ctrl+H (or goto View Menu and Select Show Hidden Files) you will see the folder named Trash or similar to the snapshot below,delete that..And then unmount it..\n\n", "Q: How can I make rhythmbox open maximised initially?

The grub menu is poped out, maybe because u installed newer kernel version. Grub is always there, it just didn't show up when u just have one kernel version. If you wanna disable it, u need modify the grub2 config file, under dir /etc/grub.d\nGrub2 manual page\n\nA: If you only have Windows and a single Ubuntu install, installed via Wubi, then you should be able to eliminate the extra menu by adding GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true to /etc/default/grub then running sudo update-grub.\nUbuntu by default hides the GRUB menu when Ubuntu is the only OS installed, and shows it when additional OSs (like Windows) are detected so that you can choose between OSs at the GRUB boot menu. Because you are using Wubi, you can select Windows from the Windows bootloader, so you don't need to be given the option again at the GRUB menu. By using GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true you disable the automatic detection of other OSs by grub, which both removes the Windows option in the GRUB menu and hides the menu.\nIf you actually have more than two OSs, for instance one regular install of Ubuntu in addition to Windows and the Wubi install then you might not want to use GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true. That's why I asked for boot info script output to be sure that I understand your exact situation.\n", "Q: Which package contains the C standard library?

I've heard from many people, Jono Bacon included, that it's impossible to say how many computers are running Ubuntu since there is nothing in the OS that phones home, and the Ubuntu Census package is only installed on OEM machines sold with Ubuntu. This 'phone home' count is important since the marketshare of an OS is based on the number of units sold which is rather disingenuous when you consider that many, if not most, Ubuntu installations are running on computers that were purchased running Windows, or even Mac OS.\nDoesn't the update manager phone home when it's figuring out if there's anything to download?\n\nA: Not all servers are maintained by Canonical. There are many mirrors of the Ubuntu repositories, and which is used varies by geographic location and personal choice. Canonical does not have access to statistics from most of these servers.\n\nEven if they did have information on the number of update checks, there is currently no unique identifier associated with updates that could be used to distinguish between multiple users and a single user checking multiple times. Having such an identifier could pose a privacy risk.\n\nA: As far as I know, though I can't find the source, it is actually used. There was some report about a year ago that had information on the number of unique hits on archive servers. The issue arises when people use mirrors, which many do. If someone is using a mirror outside of Canonical's control, then Canonical doesn't have logs of any updates. That's why there are ballpark estimates, but never anything concrete.\nWhen using Windows, OS updates come from Microsoft's servers. Additionally, they have sales data. Both can be used to have a closer estimate of usage. Ubuntu doesn't require central update servers and is obviously not sold, so usage estimates are a lot harder to deduce.\n\nA: In the software centre, under the partner section is a \"send I'm alive ping to Canonical\"\napplication. \nIts description is unclear as to whether this is only for OEM use\n\nA: There are several issues with this level of tracking:\n\n\n*\n\n*As others have said in this thread, most people use the most geographically \"relevant\" mirror possible as it speeds things up for them. These mirrors are mostly not under the control of Canonical.\nEven if Canonical could grab the remote logs, there'd be international privacy laws to obey which would end up with users perhaps having to agree to multiple agreements depending on the jurisdiction of a chosen server.\n\n*Some people don't use public mirrors at all. If you're using Ubuntu in a farm or corporate scenario over dozens or hundreds of machines (anything over three machines would make sense IMO), people proxy the repositories so only the first hit would count.\n\n*Some people could just beat on the refresh link all day. Not only would that skquiff the statistics but it would also gum the servers up more than they needed to be.\n\n*Sometimes it's better not to know.\nIt sounds stupid but one of my jobs is maintaining a webapp for a company that several large businesses use to train their employees. I've talked about adding extra data collection so we have a better idea what a user is doing as that would be handy for improvement but if we collect that data (and advertise that fact, as we're required to by UK law), our clients will expect to know the results of our collection.\nThat's fine if the data shows strong growth (or lots of their employees using the webapp in my case) but if it doesn't, it can really undermine marketing efforts. Not all data can be spun into something positive.\nBecause the data would not be a full representation of all users, any statistics drawn would be lower than actual values and Microsoft (et al) could very quickly bomb them with a few sales stats.\nThere is a package for OEM installs called canonical-census but as I've already detailed this only works for OEM installs. Read the link to see how it works but I will say it's slightly better than repo-logging.\nI guess one question to ask  you back would be: Why do Canonical need these numbers? Even if they were great results, the problem still exists that there just isn't that much money to market Ubuntu. And if they weren't as stellar as needed for certain advertising claims (or weren't released for that reason), the collection would certainly undermine the project.\n\nA: Considering the onerous Windows registration process, Microsoft is apparently not contradicting any privacy laws around the world, nor are they forced to make their users  sign multiple agreements. That issue simply cannot be a valid.  \nI believe Mark Shuttleworth was quoted having said over three years ago that \".. about 1% of all computer users use Ubuntu\". That figure is still being used by various product developers as an excuse for not providing Linux support for their product. To add insult to injury, the fact that the number is so old, is used to argue that Ubuntu growth is stalled and not going anywhere. Whatever the real number is, it can't possibly be that low anymore, three years later. If Mark cannot come up with a more up-to-date number, who can? Seriously! \nI think it would be both silly and self-destructive to continue bury our heads in the sand and not measure it for fear of seeing a low number. If we don't measure the true population, how on earth will we ever know when we are successful? When can we have a party because we are successful and not just because we wish we were? Any claim of success falls flat in it's face without some measure to back it up.  Let's not allow the lack of book keeping become the evil that kills our success, please. \nIt is rather disheartening to have actively promoted Ubuntu for years with absolutely nothing to show for it, no way of showing whether we have ever made any positive  difference or whether it has been worth our while.   \nWhy does Canonical need those numbers? Exactly because they have no money for marketing Ubuntu.

(like Alt+S) \nThanks, \nDante\n\nA: You can use the keyboard shortcuts interface to do this. Remember to add the full path.\n\n\nA: Goto System>>Preferences>>Keyboard Shortcuts\nIt will open a window click add\n\nAfter clicking add it will show you a window with Name and Command.You can write any name there and in command you should give the full path of the file with bash in-front bash /path/to/the/file.sh\n\nAfter adding the Name & Command.You can assign the shortcut key.\n\nA: xbindkeys allows you to saves multiple configurations (if you want that flexibility).  \nAlso xbindkeys gives you many more key-combinations, because it (optionally) allows you to make Numlock, ScrollLock, and CapsLock states significant... \nAnother feature which is not found in Keboard Shortcuts is that you can use ~/ and $HOME/ for your home directory, instead of having to hard-code it.  \nTo install xbindkeys, and xbindkeys-config (the GUI for xbindkeys)  \nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys xbindkeys-config  \n\nTo create the default config file for xbindkeys   \nxbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc  \n\nThen run: \nxbindkeys\nxbindkeys-config\n\nAnd for your first keybinding, you may find it useful to assign Ctrl+Shift+Alt+X, or whatever you prefer, to xbindkeys-config\nTo keep the xbindkeys hotkeys active ever time you start the computer...   \nMain Menu\n  System  \n    Preferences  \n      Startup Applications  \n        [ Add ]  \n          Name:     xbindkeys  \n          Command:  xbindkeys  \n          Comment:  xbindkeys  \n\n\nA: Just for completeness: If you are using Compiz you can set custom keyboard and mouse shortcuts using CCSM (Compiz Config Settings Manager) and the Commands plugin. \nJust put in the name of your sh-script (for example \"CustomScript\" in the attached screenshot) and give it a custom key binding in the Key Bindings tab. Your script needs to be placed in a directory that is monitored by Ubuntu for this to work. I do place all of my scripts in the /usr/local/bin directory. \nMake sure that your script is executable by applying chmod +x CustomScript in a terminal and note that all words are case sensitive.\nCompiz allows to export all settings including shortcuts which is very useful for settings up similar machines. \n\n", "Q: How to enable graphics card XFX ATI RADEON HD 4350 I need to enable the 3D effects in the graphics card under Ubuntu 10.10 OS\n\nA: Have you installed the proprietary drivers ?\nGo to System --> Administration --> Aditional drivers and press \"Enable\".\nAfter installation is complete, restart your computer.\nThen after you login right click on your desktop --> Change Desktop Background --> Visual effects and select Extra.\n\nA: I can concur that the open source drives work far better for 3d and 2d visual effects.

When trying to configure fire wall ufw, it will not accept my root password.  Is it to do with advanced bin/bash etc on setting up passwords and users?\n\nA: In Ubuntu you are not expected to use a root user with a password, most applications requiring root privileges will be invoked using sudo/gksudo, the user launching those apps will need to have sudo privileges and you must use the regular user password.\nYou should also read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo .\n\nA: You can run as the root user by typing sudo -s in the Terminal. You can then issue commands from that shell as the root, without any further need for a password (until you close the Terminal).\nTake note though that it is generally a bad idea to use root account for anything - sudo ufw something something_else should do it just fine.\nThe password for sudo is your own.\n\nA: Well the first user (you) that has been created actually has root privileges if you type your own password.\nWhen trying to configure fire wall ufw, try adding your password, not roots password.\n\nA: I have run Unix since 1972 mostly logged on as root for years at a time.  Sudo is a recent development.  Sudo is not a hard and fast requirement, the package can be removed and the root operator restored if you so desire.  Microsoft crams \"policy\" down your throat.  The Unix/Linux paradigm is, \"Tools, Not Policy!\"  Unix provides users with a wide variety of tools and allows the user to select a method that works best for him. I frankly dislike sudo, and plan to remove the package very soon so I can do things in the normal manner! Notice, please, that sudo is not normal!\n", "Q: How do I change the way Ubuntu adjusts my volume mixer levels? I've had a mildly annoying problem with my sound for quite awhile now, and I've finally decided it's time to do something about it.\nEvery time I adjust the main volume slider in the toolbar, or use my volume hotkeys on my laptop, Ubuntu adjusts my mixer levels in a strange way. When I open GNOME ALSA Mixer, I notice that there are three output sliders for my SigmaTel STAC9200: Master, PCM, and LFE. Master and LFE both have Mute checkboxes.\nWhen I press my volume up hotkey once, Master and LFE unmute, and the sliders for PCM and LFE jump up about halfway. The Master slider stays at zero. Another press brings PCM and LFE up to about 4/5, and Master remains unmoved at the bottom.\nUbuntu doesn't move Master until PCM and LFE are maxed out, which occurs between about 15%-20% on the main output mixer.\nThe effect of this is that I don't get any sound at all until about 15%-20% (since Master is at zero), and when I cross that threshold, I immediately get a loud bassy sound (from the LFE apparently). If I use headphones, I still don't get any sound until that threshold, but at least it doesn't blast me when I do get sound.\nIs there anything in PulseAudio configuration or anywhere else that could change the behavior of my output mixer?\n\nA: There are many layers in the audio stack that could contribute to this symptom. Most directly is the behavior that PulseAudio defaults to, and you can read about that at http://pulseaudio.org/wiki/PulseAudioStoleMyVolumes. You can work around some instances using the instructions I contributed at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingSoundProblems/KarmicCaveats#Volume%20range%20anomalies:\n\nVolume range anomalies\nThe latest version of PulseAudio tries\n  to control the volume of the sound\n  card using its mixer controls. Usually\n  this works just fine, but in some\n  cases this does not work properly.\n  (Whether this is PulseAudio's or\n  ALSA's fault is beyond the scope of\n  this wiki page. Some more background\n  information is here.)\nDiagnosis\nYou experience any of the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Jumps in volume, e g if everything below 20% is muted, and 21% is very\n  loud.\n  \n*Overdriven (distorted sound) if the volume is set above a certain\n  (low) level\n  \n*No volume changes in parts of the range, e g if 20% is just as loud as\n  70%. \n  \n  \n  Fix / Workaround\nThere are a few variables which\n  control how PulseAudio controls the\n  volume. You can either edit\n  /etc/pulse/default.pa (you'll have to\n  be root to do that) to change the\n  behavior for all users, or copy that\n  file to ~/.pulse/default.pa and then\n  edit that file, to change behavior for\n  the current user only.\nOpen the file mentioned above. Find\n  the row saying load-module\n  module-udev-detect and change it to:\nload-module module-udev-detect ignore_dB=1\n\nTo try your changes, restart\n  PulseAudio with the following command:\nkillall pulseaudio\n\nPulseAudio will then autospawn\n  (restart itself).\nYou may find that the above workaround\n  is insufficient, in which case you may\n  configure PulseAudio to control only\n  one mixer control, e.g., PCM (cf.\n  alsamixer). Find the row saying\n  #load-module module-alsa-sink and\n  change it to:\nload-module module-alsa-sink control=PCM\n\n(remember to remove the # in the\n  beginning of the row!) Optionally\n  replace PCM with the mixer control you\n  want PulseAudio to control.\nYou will then need to killall\n  pulseaudio as above and allow the\n  daemon to autospawn.\n\nFinally, whether this anomaly is actually a bug requires you to use ubuntu-bug alsa-base.\n\nA: For me, the current top answer of adding ignore_dB=1 to PulseAudio's config, fixed volume the level starting from 0 but it still got loud way too quickly.\nAfter some more playing I found my generic USB audio device had multiple output \"profiles\", with names like \"analog-stereo\" and \"iec958-stereo\". Even though the physical device just has a 3.5mm jack output changing to the \"iec958-stereo\" profile fixed both the volume scaling and offset problems.\nI played with the different profiles using the pavucontrol GUI tool. Profile selection is in the \"Configuration\" tab. I then used advice in this post to make things permanent:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/462670/set-default-profile-for-pulseaudio\n", "Q: Only able to login to Failsafe GNOME Installed Ubuntu using WUBI, when I reboot, I'm able to login as \"Failsafe GNOME\" and xterm, but NOT as just GNOME.

I'm pretty new to Ubuntu (and linux in general) so I'm not sure where to go next. The only posts I've found about missing options in tasksel says it just suddenly started showing additional options the next day...\nWhy don't I have all the options I usually do (like LAMP server)? How can I get these options back?\n\nA: I can only imagine that the available package list is either not there or has been corrupted somehow. sudo apt-get update might fix it.\nYou can actually install tasks through other package managers too.

You can partially fix this by using this command from the Live-CD :\nsudo e2fsck -cy /dev/sda1\n\nYou have to change /dev/sda1 by the name of the partition of your system (and make sure it is not mounted), if you don't know what is it, you can use :\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nWhich will show you all the partition on your system. This operation will take a long time and basicilly will add dammaged sectors of your partition to a list so that the filesystem will don't access them again (that will prevent the system from crashing). Since the data on damaged sector will be lost your system may not start even after the fix, in this case save all your important datas with the Live-CD and reinstall on the fixed filesystem (don't format or you'll lose the list of bad sectors and you may crash during the installation). You should do it to every partition of your damaged disk.\nIn any case make sure to save all your important datas.\n", "Q: How to play VOB files that were inside a DVD disc? I just downloaded a DVD which is for a movie. After uncompressing the DVD file I see .VOB, .IFO and .BUP files. If I open the first .VOB file it shows me the DVD menu but I can't interact with it. So, my question is... is Totem able to play those kind of files? If so, how can I achieve that? What other app could I use in order to reproduce those files?\nEdit\nUsing VLC didn't work neither. I forgot to mention I have already tried that. Let me rephrase: if I open the first video file it shows the DVD menu, BUT I can't interact with it. \n\nA: Just install VLC player it will play all VOB files.\nInstall VLC from the Software Center.\nAlso, you need this:\nsudo apt install libdvd-pkg\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure libdvd-pkg\n\n\nA: I found the following solution using mplayer:\nmplayer -mouse-movements dvdnav:////home/me/FOO\n\nHere /home/me/FOO is the directory where the .vob files reside.\n\nA: I found the following item:\nI would check out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/PlayingDVDs and follow the instructions on there (I generally find VLC is the best option). It explains everything you need to know about playing DVDs in Ubuntu.\nIt is specifically tailored to playing DVDs but a vob file is what is used on DVDs so should also cover what you are looking for (except when going to play it you open a file instead of a DVD).\nyou may need to install the libdvdcss packages as well to make DVDs play correctly.\nI hope this helps.\nSo: You can right click on a VOB file and select VLC, or open VLC and find the VOB file.\n\nA: Open the Ubuntu Software Center, search for VLC, and install it.\nThen go to Applications --> Sound and Video --> VLC.\nIn VLC, press Media --> Open Directory and select the folder that contains the VOB files.\n\nA: Finally I figured out how to do it. These are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a subdirectory called VIDEO_TS and move all files there.\n\n*Create an DVD ISO file by executing:\ngenisoimage -iso-level 1 -dvd-video -volset-size 1 -o output.iso root_folder\n\n\n*Mount the DVD ISO by executing:\nsudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop output.iso /media/cd/\n\nThe result will be a compatible ISO image which can be played using any video player (Totem, MPlayer, Dragon, etc.).\nFor those ones who are too ubuntufied, you can use K3B to create a DVD project and select \"Create image only\" before burn it. \n\nA: You don't decompress the DVD file. You have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn the .iso file to a blank DVD.\n\n*Mount the .iso file.\nEither way should produce a playable DVD, and Ubuntu should automatically detect it.\n\nA: Use smplayer. It is a great player. You will need to add the medibuntu repo to install w32codecs or w64codecs for that.\n\nA: The current version of Totem, 2.32.0, on Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick is able to play a DVD .iso file without decompressing it or anything like that. Just right-click on the .iso and \"Open With > Other Application...\" and choose Totem. I had to open the .iso twice for it to work, but it works fine and I'm able to navigate the DVD menus and turn on/off the subtitles and everything.\n\nA: For some linux installations it may be easier to encode the VOB to a video file. Here is an example using libav-tools . With ffmpeg would be the same I guess, but I haven't tried:\navconv -i VTS_01_1.VOB -f avi -c:v libx264 -g 300 -bf 2 ~/video_01_1.avi\n\nUsually the place where the VOB files are located has read-only access. The output file will be in the users main directory.\nSome options explained:\n\n\n*\n\n*-f avi : force output format\n\n*-c:v libx264 : encode with the h264 codec to create small, but quality files\n\n*-g 300 : GOP size is 300 which means one intra frame every\n       10 seconds for 29.97fps input video\n\n\nA: mount the file and play it with default video player...\n", "Q: How can I install a .bin file?

Some months ago, on the road to Ubuntu Maverick, a new system indicator, network (with connman as a backend), started to be developed. The plan was to get it into UNE and release it with no notifcation area. Unfortunately it didn't make it into the final version. However, continued efforts are still being made to improve it, and I'm getting regular updates. \nFrom a blueprint from the last UDS, I read that the plan was to ship no notification area and only indicators. For that, it was defined that nm-applet (backend: NetworkManager) should be ported to the appindicator library. \nToday I discovered that those efforts are going on and a initial version is available for testing, available from Matt Trudel PPA (Natty only).\nSo, my questions is, to whoever has the necessary info: wouldn't it be easier to join efforts and concentrate the work in just one version (probably NetworkManager backend, as that's the official plan), instead of breaking those efforts apart and hampering both testing and developing? Both indicators are being developed by Canonical engineers, and that really doesn't make much sense. \nSo, any Canonical engineer willing to clarify this? \n\nA: The conman indicator is the long term plan, the network manager indicator is the short term stop gap. there are concerns conman has some missing features which are important to some use cases and that's why development continues.\nAlthough I just don't see why the desired features in conman weren't ported to nm.\n", "Q: Cannot Play VCD I am using ubuntu 10.10 64bit.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: If by synchronisation, you mean that you want items to be mark as 'read' on each computer and platform you should definitevely use Google Reader as your web rss reader.\nThen, you can use Liferea on your Ubuntu desktop, it synchronises with Google Reader from 1.6 version.\nJust use Software center to install it. \n\nA: I use \"liferea\" which I think is really good.\n\nOr you can install it by using the command 'sudo apt-get install liferea\"\nnrss is another option.\n\nA: There is a portable version of RSSOwl, I use it on my pendrive when I'm on a different computer and just sync (automatically) my \"rssowl portable/data\" folder to the one on my Ubuntu desktop... search on portableapps.com for portable rssowl.\n", "Q: How should I manage a secure, personal ssh key? I need to have a personal ssh key such that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can back up a single file containing my private key, and restore it when I do a new install.\n\n*The private key is never stored in unencrypted form anywhere, including in the file that I back up and restore, but with the necessary exception of my RAM while I am using it.\n\n*Someone with physical access to my machine cannot necessarily use my private key. I should be required to enter a password before it will work, preferably the password to my user account.\n\n*It is not necessary to back up the public key. I should be able to generate that from the private key (but may need sufficient information to decrypt it).\n\n\nI know that there are a lot of resources explaining how to use ssh key management tools. However, I find them quite complex, and I have proven unable to save my private key when doing new installs in the past. So I would much rather hear some best practices from someone with experience doing exactly what I want to do.\n\nA: Going through your points:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you generate a SSH key, it's stored in ~/.ssh/ as id_rsa (or id_dsa). You can move this from machine to machine as you wish.\n\n*You can ensure its encryption by encrypting /home/. There are several sets of instructions on how to do this around the internet but (having never done this myself) I can't honestly suggest one over another. The one on UbuntuForums seems as good as any other. Doing this on a fresh install is easier (you can do it in the installer) but it's not required.\n\n*When you generate your keypair, make sure you set a passphrase. This means that even if somebody gets your private key, they still need that token to use it.\n\n*ssh-keygen -e will generate your public key hash from your private key. Do yes, you don't need to back that up (although it wouldn't be hard to do either - it's stored as ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub).\n", "Q: FTP access to the files of Guest Machine of VirtualBox from Host Machine I have installed pure-ftpd in the Guest machine. I tried to connect to FTP server of Guest Machine from Guest Machine with the port number 21 and I could connect to it successfully.\nIn the host machine I have added following command in order to redirect host's port 2121 into guest's port 21 and connect to FTP Server of Guest Machine.\nVBoxManage setextradata Ubuntu \"VBoxInternal/Devices/e1000/0/LUN#0/Config/FTP/HostPort\" 2121   \nVBoxManage setextradata Ubuntu \"VBoxInternal/Devices/e1000/0/LUN#0/Config/FTP/GuestPort\" 21\nVBoxManage setextradata Ubuntu \"VBoxInternal/Devices/e1000/0/LUN#0/Config/FTP/Protocol\" TCP\n\nBut once I tried to access this guest ftp server from Host Machine it asked me a password for the user I have in Guest machine and authentication passed successfully.

Maybe your firewall is blocking it?\nHow to solve the problem?\n\nA: FTP can be a tricky protocol. The control connection is (normally) set up on port. This connection is used for authentication and sending commands to the server. Data transfer happens on a different connection. Normally this is on port 20. What happens is that the client requests data from the server on port 21, then the server opens a connection back to the client on port 20 to transfer the data. This is where a firewall on the machine running the ftp client can get in the way (it may block the incoming connection from the ftp server). \nFTP has a passive mode that is supposed to cause the ftp server to transfer data to the client over the control connection instead of opening a new connection for the data transfer. I think the command is PASV, but I have never tried it myself.\nI hope this is helpful.\n", "Q: How do I connect to the internet with a \"Huwaei Ec1260\" modem?

I know about ndiswrapper for Windows network drivers. Is there anything like that for Windows printer related drivers? (Or a \"universal\" driver for Ubuntu by HP?)\n\nA: There is a universal driver called hplip (Hewlett-Packard's Linux Imaging and Printing). It's installed by default (current version in Maverick is 3.10.6) so for most HP printers, you're able to plug it in and start printing straight away.\nHP provide a searchable database of printers so you can check to see if yours is compatible. They also provide recommendations so if you want a HP printer with full Linux support, you can check that list.\nIn your case, the page for your LaserJet 1200 reports that it has full support. Congratulations.\n\nA: I think most HP printers work by default. Try plugging it!\n\nA: According to the HP LaserJet 1200 page on the openprinting.org site this printer should be well supported. What happens when you plug it in (Update your question with what happens).\n\nA: We had a couple of those printers at work. I believe that the last one was changed around a month ago.

You modify his sample configuration file to point at your source and target folders and inosync runs in the background, using rsync to keep the target updated with changes on the source.\n", "Q: Opening CD-ROM with bash code I have copied this bunch of code from one funny video clip about How does a programmer swing his baby.

While running alpha/beta Ubuntu, I have often had problems where X freezes and I would have to restart X.\nDuring this freeze, I'm able to switch to a tty and shutdown the programs. I either use top and kill the running apps[evolution/firefox/etc,..], or use killall commands.\nBut when I use those kill commands, the application shuts-down abruptly and when opening in the next session it 'recovers'. ex: Firefox needs to restore all the web-pages I was viewing, so if I had 20-30 tabs open it will literally freeze for a few mins. evolution would not have deleted messages in trash, etc..\nIs there a command I can use to shutdown applications cleanly from a tty? \n[apps that i use regularly are firefox,evolution,transmission,xchat]\n\nA: The standard way to notify a POSIX application to close, while still having a grace period to do cleanup is to send it the SIGTERM (wikipedia link) signal. The SIGKILL (wikipedia link) signal, on the other hand, kills the application without even giving it a chance to tidy up.\nHowever… both of your actions - calling top (by the way I would recommend that you switch to use htop instead of top) or killall - send the SIGTERM signal by default.\nAnd I have just tested firing Firefox up - and trying it both with SIGKILL and SIGTERM. With SIGTERM, when I took Firefox again, I did not get any error or \"restoration\" message. With SIGKILL, I got the it's embarrassing screen. \nSo, the reason is simple: The instance of X for these apps is frozen. All these GUI applications operate under the premise that their instance of X is functioning properly. They probably cannot even try anything if X is frozen.\nThe way to solve your problem is to determine why X is freezing, and prevent that from happening. \nEdit: Ah, sorry -  just saw that you talk about using the Ubuntu alpha/beta when X freezes. In which case… I would say it is part of the excitement of running an alpha/beta. Try to understand why it freezes, write/add to a bug report. In order to speed Firefox's startup in these, simply tell it to not reload the same tabs when it reopens. (You can still find these tabs in history). For the other applications, their cleanup actions are rather trivial - it should not cost you much that they didn't happen.\n\nA: Do you have both browser.sessionstore.enabled and browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash set to true in about:config?

I wanted to use a NTFS partition on Ubuntu drive to allow file sharing between to two OS's but when I formatted that partition, I accidentally shot my self in the foot by deleting my boot info.  So I now must reformat and reinstall my windows OS because I accidentally deleted my BOOTMGR and when I do I wanted to know, should I put each OS on the same drive and have the other be a data drive in NTFS, or should I set it up as the way I had it again.  Also, Its been a while since the last time I've set it up so how do I select where I want the folder with all the boot info to go, or should I put in on its own partition somewhere.\n\nA: You don't necessarily have to erase the windows partition. Just boot off the Windows CD and hit \"Repair your computer\" You will have to restore Grub2 afterwards (see the grub2 ubuntu wiki page).\nSince you can't, putting the OSs on different devices is probably the smarter decision because of HDD crashes. Put Grub2 on the first HDD, Windows on the second that way both will be able to boot independently.\nYou could of course also experiment with RAID for data or even for your Ubuntu partition.\n\nA: If you've decided to install two separate operating systems, I'd say installing them both on one and using another one as dedicated data is definitely a better choice. It lets you isolate your OSes from your large data like media, and you're not stuck in OS-dependent represntation like C:/Users/username/Documents/Videos [oops, backslash... right.] or /home/username/Videos. You can have a clean hierarchy that you can mount wherever you like.\nCreating a separate boot partition is entirely a matter of personal preference. On a few of my machines I use multiple distributions of linux, so it's good for them to be able to share that information. In your case, though, I don't really see a benefit.\n\nA: I would suggest installing both operating systems, and a dedicated NTFS \"data drive\" (partition), on the first hard disk, and using the second drive for backup.  You can regularly create disk images of the first drive in order to be able to do complete system or individual partition restores, and use a \"real-time\" folder/file backup utility to keep an up-to-date copy of the data drive.  \nI am currently using Acronis True Image (Windows) to create disk images, but have used PartImage in the past, and may go back to a Linux-based disk imager, several of which are available.  \nFor real-time backup, I use inosync (http://bb.xnull.de/ or http://github.com/hollow/inosync) in Linux, and Quick Shadow Backup (http://quicklytech.com/) in Windows, to back up the same data partition that is used by both operating systems.\n", "Q: I can't open up URL's in Hotot When i click on any link an error message pops up saying \"The specified location is not supported\".\nI'm using Lubuntu and hotot version 0.9.5.\n\nA: I see you've already  filed a bug against Hotot. \nPlease give this bug report a bit more time, it seems to be legitimate. You can't expect feedback from the developers in such short order.\nThis will very probably be an incompatibility with Lubuntu/LXDE.\nI've seen many projects which rely on things like \"xdg-open\" and gnome-default-applications\nto handle urls and so on. Fixing this issue will require the Developers to make specific to LXDE, you'll have to be patient.\nUpdate:\nI've rummaged throught the Hotot source code, and found that it - if it detects you're running openbox - first tries to open the URL with firefox (it subsequently tries 'xdg-open', 'google-chrome', 'chromium-browser', 'firefox' again, then 'x-www-browser'). It will open the URL (and assume all goes well) with the first one it recognises as a command that is available on your system. \nAfter this, hotot can't do anything about error that is thrown by the software that was selected as probably being your default browser. \nThere's a bug in Fedora's xdg-utils package which addressed an issue you might have; namely xdg-open not working properly with LXDE. The bug has been fixed in fedora 14, but it probably hasn't been pulled down by the people at Lubuntu.\nSo: it seems your bug report in Hotot is invalid, since they are doing everything properly. You will just have to wait for Lubuntu's version of xdg-utils to catch up to the current upstream version (as of the 28th of October).\nYou can  file a bug against Lubuntu. The better your bug report, the faster it will fixed - as always. :)\nJust make sure there's no issue with Firefox before you do.\n\nA: well i solved it and your comment was pointing me out to the right file where last months i hacked it to make dropbox get opened with pcmanfm and chromuim open downloaded file correctly so yeah the solution is i just had to put this in /usr/bin/xdg-open\n\nenter generic)\n#open_generic \"$url\"\n#xdg-open \"$url\"\nopen_gnome \"$url\" \nthe \"open_gnome\" in the generic case since the others doesnt fit me \nthanks again\n", "Q: Using locate to find a directory I use locate all the time to find files that I know the name of, locate is very fast and I love that. For recently created files find is great, normally with recently created files I know where basically they were created so I don't have to search my entire file system. \nWhen I've forgotten the location of a directory however neither find nor locate seem ideal. \nLocate always spits out far too much information because every file within a directory is also a match for locate. For instance if I was searching for a directory named log somewhere on my file system locate log would return tons and tons of results. If I do the same thing with find, find / -name log -type d find takes minutes to run and spits out all sorts of permissions errors every time it encounters a folder it can't read. \nIs there a better way?\nAnswer: So I'm sticking with grep until I find something else:\nlocatedir () {\n    for last; do true; done\n    if [[ $last == *\\/* ]]\n    then\n        locate $@ | grep \"${last}\\$\"\n    else\n        locate $@ | grep \"/${last}\\$\"\n    fi\n}\n\n\nA: Have you tried:\nlocate /home/insertusernamehere/*/filename?\nor\nlocate file | grep -i '^/home/.*/examplesubdirectory'?\nor any variation of such?\n\nA: You can use the option --regex (-r) of locate:\nlocate -r '/log$'\n\n\nA: Here it is\nlocatedir () {\n    locate \"$*\" | while read line\n    do \n    if [ -d \"$line\" ] ; then echo $line ; fi\n    done\n}\n\nlocatedir $*\n\n\nA: A way (I suspect there may be a better way) is to use grep to return only the those paths which end in your folder name :\nlocate foldername | grep /foldername$\n\n", "Q: Trash works on NTFS when mounted by Nautilus, but not when automounted via /etc/fstab I have 2 \"data\" drives.

Also, there's now a bit of lag when I play a game called teeworlds (not graphics intensive).\nMy laptop is low-end so I'm not sure if it's just my video card. I'm debating if I should install the proprietary drivers to improve performance. Can I get some advice on this?\noutput of lspci | grep -i VGA is as follows:\n01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc M880G [Mobility Radeon HD 4200]\n\nI'm not sure as to what drivers I'm currently using, all I know is that I didn't touch it since installing Karmic 9.10 so I know I'm using an open source one. I'm currently using 10.04 LTS (upgraded, not a clean install).\n\nA: I've found that proprietary ATI drivers induced more lag on my laptop than the open-source drivers. They were also crashing Xorg from time to time - I have no idea why though.\nIf you're not going to play 3D games that require graphics acceleration, then I don't think you should bother with installing proprietary drivers. However, it is up to you and your hardware, so I don't think anyone here can give a 100% correct advice on what is best. Try it out yourself and see which suits your needs.\n\nA: This is quite a hard question to answer as both the open source radeon driver, and the proprietary ATI fglrx driver have their advantages and disadvantages.\nWhen it comes to performance and support of fancy features including energy save modes the fglrx still is better than radeon but the latter improved considerably, and it's main advantage is it's being quite stable.\nI understand that you are not so much dependent on high end GPU power and you are happy with your system as it is now - so why change it? You will risk to be faced with incredible hard to tackle errors including an unbootable desktop when anything goes wrong with the driver installation. Performing upgrades of your Ubuntu may become more difficult. In addition it may not be easy to get rid of fglrx once it was installed. Fglrx is not open source!\nMy advice would be to stay with your system, even though many people are happy with the fglrx drivers and love the challenge to get it running the way it's supposed to.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make Openbox behave like the Compiz Grid plugin? I've been happily using Compiz with the Grid plugin on Ubuntu 10.04 on my Mini Inspiron netbook. However, due to battery life issues, I'm considering downgrading to a lighter Ubuntu derivative, and would like to try Lubuntu, which uses the Openbox window manager.

I understand that fork() creates an identical process of the currently running process, but where does it start? For example, if I have code\nint main (int argc, char **argv)\n{\n\n    int retval;\n    printf (\"This is most definitely the parent process\\n\");\n    fflush (stdout);\n    retval = fork ();\n    printf (\"Which process printed this?\\n\");\n\n    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);\n}\n\nThe output is:\nThis is most definitely the parent process\nWhich process printed this?\nWhich process printed this?\n\nI thought that fork() creates a same process, so I initially thought that in that program, the fork() call would be recursively called forever. I guess that new process created from fork() starts after the fork() call?\nIf I add the following code, to differentiate between a parent and child process,\nif (child_pid = fork ()) printf (\"This is the parent, child pid is %d\\n\", child_pid);\nelse printf (\"This is the child, pid is %d\\n\",getpid ());\n\nafter the fork() call, where does the child process begin its execution?\n\nA: The actual fork forking happens inside the fork() primitive.\nYou can just imagine that inside the code of fork, a system call actually duplicates the process and start their execution at the same point with a slight difference:\n\n\n*\n\n*the parent process fork function will return the process ID of the child process\n\n*the child process fork function will return 0.\n\n\nThus you know where you are during the programming, for instance\n  if (fork())\n  {\n     printf(\"Parent speaking\\n\");\n     // parent's tasks\n  }\n  else\n  {\n     printf(\"Child here\\n\");\n     // child's tasks\n  }\n\n\nA: fork() will copy the Process that is forked in the state it's currently in.*\nIt can be hard to say in which line of code the child process starts, you'd really have to look at a disassembled compiled version to understand. But it's often okay to assume it starts after fork has been called, certainly in your case.\nIt's copying all of it's variables, the stack, the whole thing (it's space in memory in fact) is copied byte by byte. The only thing that changes is the Process ID**.\nIf you do this:\nint i = random_integer();\nfork();\n\nThe child process will have the same value for i as it's parent.\n*: In the child process, the return value of fork() will be 0 instead of the process ID.\n**: Also, the child process will not have the parents Locks and resource utilisation.\n\nA: The child process begins execution right after the fork() call.  More specifically, right after fork() has returned either the child's processes ID or 0.  \n", "Q: Touchpad issues on HP Pavilion dm4 (can't right click) Can anyone help me with my touchpad issues?

But now I find that trying to watch Facebook videos from family and friends is impossible due to the terrible choppy frame rate and near freezing of the browser window. Any idea what is going on and how to fix it?\n\nA: Did you try the fix mentioned in this thread, this post to be specific\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=10020982&postcount=24\n\nA: Video using CPU, not graphics card\nIn general, unless you set it up to be otherwise, videos in the web browser don't use the video card at all. This means your CPU is doing all the hard work to decode and display the video. I don't know enough about specs to know whether this would be happening with your processor, but I have an older single-core AMD processor that usually gets maxed out at 100% when watching videos on the web (especially Flash videos). When that happens, the frame rate gets choppy and the browser gets sluggish.\nRecommended (non-technical) workarounds\nThere are fixes for some setups (see below), but in the meantime, you might try some of the following workarounds when you go to watch a movie:\n\n\n*\n\n*Decrease the bitrate (or \"quality\") of the video stream. Yep, that means if your video is set to HD, like 720p or higher, you're going to have to knock it down to a lower quality. I don't like it, either, but it's better than choppiness.\n\n*Reduce the load on your CPU from other tasks. Close unnecessary programs, tabs, etc. that are using processor time. You can see a list of running programs and sort them by their CPU time (CPU%) in  System Monitor. IMPORTANT: Close the programs properly; do not use the System Monitor to end the task!\n\n*Try watching the video in the opposite full-screen mode. If you typically watch videos in full screen, try watching them in the browser window. If you typically watch videos in the browser window, try watching them full screen. I've heard both changes work for people; it depends on your display setup (and I don't know much about how that part works).\n\n*Watch the video in a different format, if possible. This mostly applies to Flash videos. Try using the video hosting site's option for HTML5 video, if available (YouTube is one of the places that allow you to do this).

However, there is work getting done to solve this problem.\nFlash developers have a beta of Flash Player for Linux that uses hardware acceleration (i.e., uses your video card to help out) on some setups. I also know that VDPAU is used to make the graphics card available for this kind of problem (I've used it to solve the same problem on one of my own computers), but it only works on NVIDIA graphics cards (as far as I'm aware, at least). I don't know of anything for ATI graphics cards. Then again, I don't know a lot of what's going on in video and graphics software development for Linux anyway.

Strangely I could create the file fine but couldn't delete it.\nI looked around the web and saw this problem a lot--most answers were related to permission settings in the smb.conf file.

I want to change my network monitor applet to this  icon.Currently my network monitor applet has this icon .I am using ubuntu 10.04,how to do this?\n\nA: There is a very simple way to do what you wish without root privileges or even overwriting anything.  As you know, your icon themes are located in /usr/share/icons.  Simply go to your icon theme directory and locate the icon(s) you wish to replace, taking note of their locations.  \nIn your home folder there is a hidden directory called .icons.  In Nautilus you can hit Ctrl+H to see it.  Any icons you put in this directory will be treated as icons are treated in /usr/share/icons.  The only catch is that icons places in the .icons folder available only for that user.  Also programs run as superuser, like Synaptic, will not reflect any changes in theme-ing added to your home folder.  \nA way to solve that is to symbolically link ~/.icons (and ~/.themes if you want) to the corresponding folders in /root.\nIf you wanted to do that you could put this in terminal:\nsudo ln -s ~/.icons /root\n\nThat will make your user themes globally available without needing root privileges at all.  But that's beyond the scope of the question and I'm babbling.\nI will use the Mint-X icon theme and the application Blender as an example.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I navigate to\n/usr/share/icons/Mint-X/apps/48 I see a Blender icon.  But I would like\nto replace it with a custom icon.\n\n*I then go to ~/.icons and recreate\nthe same directory hierarchy, staring with \"Mint-X\":\n\n*~/.icons/Mint-X/apps/48\n\n*Then I put my custom Blender icon in\nthe new \"48\" folder.\n\n*And finally, I open the Appearance Preferences\nWindow, select a different icon\ntheme, and reselect Mint-X so it\nreloads (sometimes it happens live\nand you don't even need to reload the\ntheme).\n\n\nNow instead of the Blender icon in /usr/share/icons/Mint-X/apps/48 I see the one in ~/.icons/Mint-X/apps/48 used in apps and menus that use the 48x48 sized Blender icon.\nKeep in mind that everything is case sensitive and must match each other exactly for this trick to work!\nThere a few other ways to do this without overwriting anything in an icon theme, but this is by far the simplest.  Also, just putting your custom icon in ~/.icons often works (the Twitter client Hotot is an example).\nI recommend learning what the index.theme files do.  Those files control what places your system looks to decide which icons to use, what to name the theme, etc.  Open one up in Gedit and have a look, it's pretty simple!\nThe way I do it is by keeping a custom theme in ~/.icons that I always use (to make sure panel icons are the correct colors, mostly).  I make up an index.theme file (you can copy one rather than write a whole new one, but make sure your folder locations correlate!) and just have it \"inherit\" the new theme I want.\nSo if I wanted to use the Elementary icon theme instead of the Faenza-Dark one I would change the line\nInherits=Faenza-Dark\n\nto\nInherits=Elementary\n\nSo in turn, by inheriting Elementary I will also inherit whatever Elementary inherits, but my icons will always come first.\nHope that was helpful, time for bed!\n\nA: This helped me:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=35662\nHope it works out for you.\n\nA: The icon name in use there is the 'network-transmit-receive' .\nSo what you need to do is, Name your favorite icon as 'network-transmit-receive.png'/'network-transmit-receive.svg' depending on what format you have in your theme. \nEither replace it or just add one if your theme does not have the 'network-transmit-receive' icon.\nOther icon names used, at times, in the applet are the \"network-idle\", \"network-receive\", \"network-transmit\" .\n", "Q: Cloud server stuck on dpkg --configure -a I have an amazon micro instance which runs one or two things for me.

You can also just simplify this to just\nscreen -d -m -S mysession -t label sleep 1m\n\nwith the caveat that, when the process exits, the screen will just disappear, and you won't be able to see what it wrote to the screen.

When the admin needs to do privileged tasks,  sudo can be used to become superuser. Before gaining the requested privileges, the admin will be prompted to enter the SAME password used in the first login.\nI was wondering whether it is possible to configure the system to ask the user for a different password when doing sudo. So, the user will have two passwords. The first password will provide access to SSH session. The other password (not the same one) will be used to gain the admin (root) privileges.\nIs this possible? I think it will add more security to the system. Do you agree?\nBTW, this will be similar to the access control used by Cisco devices. First, the admin login using a password. Then, accessing \"enabled\" (privileged) mode requires another password (can be different or same password).\n\nA: SSH via a password is less secure than SSH with a DSA/RSA certificate. Create a certificate with a password. Then give the sys admin account a different password.\nYou will only be able to login via SSH if you have the certificate AND know the password associated with it.\nYou can then use a different password for running sudo (the user's password).\nThis gives you a lot more security!\nRemember to use pass phrases and not passwords too. The difference being a pass phrase is made up of many words (greater than 20 characters say). The longer the password, the more time it would take to break via dictionary attacks.\nTo create a certificate:\n\n\n*\n\n*type ssh-keygen at a terminal and follow the instructions (giving a unique filename and enter your pass phrase)\n\n*then copy the public key onto the server you are administering using ssh-copy-id -i path/to/your/sshkey.pub\n\n*Now log on to your server and turn off password authentication in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and restart the sshd service \n\n\nA: You might want to look towards using su root instead of sudo, but I strongly recommend to follow the answer tommed has provided. \n", "Q: Unable to share a folder between Windows 7 and Ubuntu (running in VMWare) I have installed vmware toolbox in Ubuntu (guest OS).

And in default Ubuntu, cron mostly runs anacron which is responsible for running periodic tasks on machines that may not be on when the task is supposed to fire.\nThings to check are:\n\n\n*\n\n*is cron running? ps -C cron\n\n*is cron configured? cat /etc/crontab\n\n*is cron calling anacron from /etc/crontab?\n\n*is anacron installed? ls /usr/sbin/anacron\n\n*is cron or anacron logging any messages at all? grep CRON /var/log/syslog\nFor the last step, logrotate may have archived older syslogs so if grep gives no result try\n(cat /var/log/syslog.[0-9] ; zcat /var/log/syslog.*.gz) | grep CRON\n\nMy guess is that gnome-scheduler is setting up jobs with the wrong permissions (probably as you and not a superuser) and therefore the complaints will appear in the syslogs.\nresponse to update\nGiven the shell prompt in your crontab -l example, you almost certainly listed bakhtiyor's per user crontab which may not have the permissions to run your (somewhat opaque) jobs. \nThe syslog entries will show if the jobs are being run at all, and if so, if the jobs complain.\n\nA: Based on your log entries, it looks like your jobs did not run recently.\nYou should also check the archived cron logs, because it might have turned over since they last run.\nTo debug this further I would add this job, using crontab -e\n*/5 * * * * echo hello\n\nand see if that sends you mail, and whether it appears in the log file.\nupdate: If it's appearing in the log file but not sending you mail, then you might need to either install a mail agent to see the output from your backup jobs, or run them with output redirected into a log file.  For instance, you could use crontab -e to change one line to\n0 15 * * * nice -n 19 /usr/bin/backintime --backup-job >> ~/log/backup.log 2>&1\n\nyou will need to create the ~/log directory.\n\nA: This solution worked for me:\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/backintime/+question/90513\nMy job configuration was saved under my user and not root because I was using sudo backintime-gnome and not gksu backintime-gnome.\nsudo will not change HOME environ which causes problems:\n$ sudo env | grep ^HOME\nHOME=/home/user\n$ gksu env | grep ^HOME\nHOME=/root\n\n\nA: I had the same issue and solved it by adding my username to the crontab group.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/group\n\n*Locate the line containing crontab (there should be only 1 line)\n\n*Add you username at the end (if other users are on the line, separate with a comma)\n\n*reboot\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem which gave me quite a runaround. Assuming cron, crontab and anacron are healthy, the key symptom is that the task runs correctly if invoked using gnome-schedule's \"run now\" button, but does not run as scheduled once left alone.\nThis turns out to be mostly a graphical environment issue. My recommendation is to create a wrapper for the task script, e.g. \"task-wrapper\":\n#!/bin/sh\ngnome-terminal -x /home/username/task\n\nMake sure the task-wrapper file is executable, and create the task in gnome-schedule as an X application. Alternately, write it like this:\n#!/bin/sh\nexport DISPLAY=:0\ngnome-terminal -x /home/username/task\n\nThe /home/username/task script will now run in a console window which will close upon completion.  My scripts typically require sudo authentication, so I start the \"task\" script like this:\n#!/bin/sh\nset -e\nMESSAGE=\"The task script wants to ...\"\ngksudo --message \"$MESSAGE\" cd /whatever\n\nThe cd command is inoccuous, the MESSAGE explains what the script is requesting authorization for, and 'set -e' ensures the script aborts if the user hits 'Cancel'. The remainder of the script can use simple 'sudo' calls which will succeed unless a lot of time elapses between commands.\nUnder Ubuntu 12.04, crontab group membership doesn't seem to be required.\n", "Q: How can I monitor the output of an already running program?

Still, some programs write a log file to see what happened.\nThis is all very different from software to software.

Is there an equivalent to gconf-editor for GSettings/dconf?\nI know that I can use gsettings set ... on the command line, but that's a bit inconvenient (especially with list types).\n\nA: There's dconf-editor, which is the equivalent to gconf-editor. To install it, run this command:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\nFor old Ubuntu versions (before 14.04), dconf-editor is provided by the dconf-tools package.

Is there a simple fix in the policy mods to enable requesting confirmation of SU privileges as it did in 10.04?\n\nA: It looks like you're experiencing a valid bug. This behaviour isn't easily explainable by anything you might have done, it looks like it's simply an error in 'update-manager'.\nPlease report your bug to  update-manager in Ubuntu. Include all of the steps to replicate the problem on your system.

I can also go to the website and listen there. What gives?\nUpdate: To clarify, I have a Last.fm account, but am not a paying subscriber.\nFollowing a link in the answer provided by DoR, it seems Last.fm changed the structure of their service to be restricted outside of the US, UK and Germany, but I am in the UK so this still just as confusing.\n\n\nA: Banshee uses a newer version of the Last.fm API which requires you to be a subscriber, https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=541227. Rhythmbox uses (or did anyway) a deprecated version of the API that did not require you to subscribe to Last.fm.\n\nA: Because you don't subscribe to last.fm. Last.fm requires you to subscribe to use those features, so it's not Banshee, it's last.fm.\n", "Q: How do I get a Genius iLook 300 webcam to work? please help me install webcam Genius iLook 300 v1.4 in ubuntu 10.04.\nlsusb show this:\nBus 003 Device 002: ID 093a:2628 Pixart Imaging, Inc.\n\n\nA: OK so I noticed a question that needed an answer.

For example, if /dev/sda3 is mounted on /home, given the file  ~/document.odt, what command can I use to determine that the file is on /dev/sda3?\n\nA: You can use:\ndf /path/to/filename\n\nIt will show the path base mount point.\n", "Q: Are there Karma thresholds on Launchpad for gaining access to certain features I'm currently reviewing bus on Launchpad and the option to Triage them is greyed out for me. Is this because my Karma is not high enough (599 at time of writing) or is it because I'm not a part of the correct team (I'm working on papercuts).\n\nA: No, Launchpad karma has no bearing on what you can access. \nThe \"Triaged\" and \"Won't Fix\" bug statuses are reserved to the role called the \"bug supervisor\" for each project or distribution. For Ubuntu, this is the Ubuntu Bugs team (actually, effectively, the Ubuntu Bug Control team), which you have to be part of in order to set the statuses in question.\nYou can join Ubuntu Bug Control once you've spent some time triaging bugs and have familiarized yourself with the various triage procedures.\n", "Q: How to boot to root shell when GRUB recovery menu fails to load a shell?

Ctrl+Alt+F1-F12 don't really give me anything important either.\n\nA: Selecting 'recovery mode' should normally give you a menu from which you can choose to get a root shell or various other options.  If you don't get that menu, something is broken.  What are the last few messages you see?\n\nA: u can manually edit ur grub file.\nFor example, when booting up, press Shift to get into grub2, and press e to edit\nthe commandline, change the commandline: \nappend init=/bin/sh\nlinux  init=/bin/sh\nand if you are lucky, you can get in a shell.\nHow to boot GRUB2 into the simplest Linux shell ?\n", "Q: Why is the default wallpaper in jpg format, rather than a lossless format like png? Is it just to save disk space? Or does it affect loading time/performance in some way? You'd think that you'd want the best quality possible image for something you'll be looking at throughout the day.\n\nA: There is the issue of space on the Live CD which is the primary distribution channel, but my understanding is that this is simply a legacy thing that has not yet been reviewed.\nThe difference between jpg and png when it comes to wallpaper is not all that important when you consider that wallpaper is not something that is carefully scrutinized as its often behind active windows.\nIf you feel strongly, and have comparable images to submit highlighting the advantages, create a bug report on Launchpad.\n\nA: I see on launchpad that photos are compressed at 66%.  I only looked for this after noticing the poor quality of the stock Ubuntu background images.  The compression artefacts are really noticeable on larger screens.\nThis is obviously due to the space on the CD.  So how about creating an ubuntu-wallpapers-hq package for high quality versions of the same images (not included on the CD but available for download).  The package could automatically replace the existing package in order to avoid duplicates.\n\nA: You are probably over-imagining both the loss due to good JPEG compression and your ability to detect that loss.\nBut since GNOME desktop is happy to use JPEGs or PNGs as a background, use whichever pleases you.\n", "Q: Why is the Ubuntu One server side application proprietary? \nNOTE: as of 02-04-14. Canonical has announced that they will be shutting down the ubuntu one service, and in the process, will make the server side application open source as well, as detailed in their blog post\n\nI've come across the Launchpad bug report which gave me some insight into people's opinions on the matter, but didn't explain why Canonical made this decision. The Wikipedia article on Ubuntu One didn't contain any links to announcements that would clear this up.\nQuestion: Why is the Ubuntu One server side application proprietary?\n\nA: \nUbuntu One's source code has been OSSed, see: http://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/08/10/ubuntu-one-file-syncing-code-open-sourced/\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Original answer for posterity: \n  \n\nThis was a commercial decision made early on in the project.\nThere where many rationales behind it, one of the predominant ones being that by making the server open source, anyone could set up a competing site with lower prices, effectively making the project hard (impossible?) to be sustained.\nThat said, many bits and pieces have been open sourced, and many more are to come.\nWe are continuously exploring ways to generate revenue that at the same time allow us to shift away from this model.\nThe cost of the infrastructure to give away free storage space and synchronisation to millions of users as well as a brilliant development team is hugely expensive, so it is a sensitive subject.\nEveryone involved in the project is passionate about open source, and the majority of us are deeply involved in many open source communities.\n\nA: Because they are a private firm offering a service and believe that their revenue will be better if Fred's UbuntuOne isn't competing with them.\nThey also don't have to tell us why and apparently haven't.

Which is a better platform for a professional use server?\nDebian Stable or Ubuntu LTS?\nThe third party software we plan to use, works on both. Which one is better on it own merits?\nTake into account things like the kernel (Ubuntu for example has its own custom kernel for servers), and other Ubuntu specific customizations.\nI keep switching back and forth, and I need to decide so I can recommend one or the other to a client. Right now, I think I am going to choose Debian Stable.\n\nRecently, I have had Ubuntu Server Edition 10.04.1 have a few strange issues...\nI have Ubuntu setup to do automatic updates via a simple script, and every few months or so, libapache2-mod-php5 gets removed because of conflicting packages... Thereby causing me to loose the php function of the web server.\nDebian Stable has not done anything like this.\n\nA: Well I don't see why people are making a fuss about the quality of the question. It's clearly a decision that lots of developers will want to weigh up before deploying. And there are clearly some differences that are very relevant to deploying each.\n\nI think the prime consideration and comparison between debian stable and an Ubuntu LTS is security and general package updates.\nDebian \"stable\" releases are supported for a year after the next stable release. So if a stable comes out every two years, and you started on a stable release right at its launch, you get three years of updates:\n\nThe security team tries to support a stable distribution for about one year after the next stable distribution has been released, except when another stable distribution is released within this year. It is not possible to support three distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult enough.\n\nYou should note that the debian cadence is not guaranteed. Stable releases come out when they're ready. This could mean you get anywhere from 18 months to 18 years of support. This makes it very unpredictable as you won't know when you need to upgrade until you know when the next stable will be finalised.\nCompare that to a Ubuntu LTS release, desktop updates are very similar but for the server applications and kernel, you get a mammoth 5 years of support, regardless of any new LTS releases in that time:\n\nA new LTS version is usually released every 2 years. With the v12.04 Long Term Support (LTS) version you get 5 years support for both the Ubuntu Desktop and the Ubuntu Server. There is no extra fee for the LTS version; we make our very best work available to everyone on the same free terms.\n\nThis means you should be able to deploy the latest LTS on a box and not have to worry about it not getting security updates (for supported packages) for years and years. When you have more than a handful of servers, or just some applications that can't afford any downtime for testing upgrades, or just don't have the time to spend a day/week testing upgrades, Ubuntu has a large advantage over debian.\n\nA: I am testing xen hypervisors for 2 years now and the general rule is newer kernel = more performance/stability. In that regard Ubuntu LTS is almost like Arch Linux with support. Debian worked fine with Intel/Nvidia, as soon as we got into testing AMD \"hit the fan\". Debian with xenkernel from testing still doesn't have a bugfix for AMD FX 81xx CPUs, i won't even talk about \"stable\" repo. Big community is good and all, but Canonicals responsiveness was better every time it was needed (may be conincidence).\nI think in 3-4 more months there will be enough statistics for me to say decisevly, but i am convinced there will be a migration of all hypervisors to ubuntu server.\n\nA: Seeing ByteCode's answer, I thought I'd supply my anecdotal experience with Ubuntu LTS on a work server.\nThe box: AMD 1055t, 4GB ram, 4TB hardware raid5, enthusiast motherboard with mild overclocking. Lots of fans & the 4 raid drives are external & mounted to a large aluminum plate with copper as heat sink on other side. \nInstalled Ubuntu 10.04 LTS in 2011 I think. Might have been 2010. Never did a dist upgrade. Rarely if ever updated at all actually, as I didn't do it frequently enough and then dependencies got broken. It shutdown in September 2011 when San Diego's power went out for hours. Then next time was this year when I moved it into a cabinet.\nMy trick? Total neglect. Rarely updated & when I did, I used aptitude. Then we had 3 power outages in a row yesterday. Should have left it off the whole time, but the last time something went wrong with the HDD and ubuntu wouldn't boot. So new HDD time and I'm installing debian now, as from my reading, it would seem debian is better for install and forget.\n\nedit / update 1.5 years later\nDebian didn't install quite as easily as I'd like on my latest server, so I'm back on the latest Ubuntu LTS. Uptime would be much more awesome than 29 days but had to shut down to remove a couple failing drives from the zfs raid. Been running ubuntu for the work's fileserver for half a decade and it is rock solid. Not once can I point any blame at the OS. Heck, it even saved me when that aforementioned AMD system started having kernel panics from the RAM trying to go bad.\nI haven't ever purchased windows server, but at least once a year, one of our Windows computers does an update and upon reboot, isn't quite the same again. Never had that with linux...\n\nA: To answer your question about Professional/Production use I think there are several key elements that have been addressed but there is one point I feel that is extremely crucial. \nPackages and Package Management\nThis is a key difference between Debian stable and Ubuntu LTS especially if your concerned about longevity, uptime, stability etc. \nUbuntu is released every six months and is based off of the Debian unstable branch which generally means overall newer and more up to date software but at the same time having the disadvantage of being considered basically \"unstable\" at least in an enterprise context. \nNow the LTS release is based mostly on Debian Testing which in Debian terms \"represents the state of the upcoming stable release before it is actually considered stable\" and although Ubuntu puts a lot of time and effort into making regular and LTS versions as stable as possible after the packages have been pulled from there respective Debian branches, LTS is still based on the Testing branch which in turn is still considered by Debian in its own branch to be not quite ready for Production use or anything approaching mission critical. \nAnd Ubuntu's community of developers simply cannot compete on the same scope or level of Debian which is possibly the largest communal based software ever created. \nIn basic terms this means Ubuntu LTS being based upon the Debian Testing branch and even with Ubuntus attempts to stabilize and polish their testing packages after they're pulled, does not equal the immense development and maturity of Debian stable and the packages thereof. Debian stable truly is the Golden Standard for rock solid stability. \n\nA: Up to recently support life cycles were of similar length so it made little difference. The most recent Ubuntu LTS (18.04) gives you 10 years of support rather than the usual 5.\nMigrations are expensive so 10 year support is a big advantage for Ubuntu.\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*serverwatch.com\n\n*itsfoss.com\n\n*wikipedia.org\n\nA: I stumbled upon this thread whilst googling \"ubuntu server stability issues\" - searching for answers to my own concerns regarding the stability of Ubuntu server.\nI have to admit that I'm a long term Ubuntu fan, particularly on the desktop (Since Breezy).\nBox 1: \"Fred\"\nI first deployed Ubuntu server 8.04 on a production machine that has low usage requirements; it's predominantly a \"brochure-ware\" level webserver with about 4/5 websites, which also acts as an offsite backup repository. Primary packages are Apache2, Mysql, Postgresql, PHP.\nIt's dual core, has 2 GB RAM, 2x 1GB HDD configured with mdadm as RAID1.\nStability wise, it has been great except that it seems to die every 3-6 months for no obvious reason, despite combining through log after log.\nI've kept this machine on 8.04, performing occasional updates.\nBox 2: \"Charlie\"\nCharlie has been running for a similar lifetime as Fred, and is used as an office based backup and media storage machine, office server monitoring node, network gateway for remote logins, wiki and virtualbox host.\nPrimary packages are: Apache2, postgresql, mysql, PHP, webmin, samba and Virtual box - Non OSE (We needed the headless feature back when that wasn't supported in the OSE).\nHardware wise, Charlie is Quad core, with 8GB RAM, has about 10TB of storage, distributed across a number of sata and ide drives, some of the sata drives comprise a soft RAID5 array, we have a drobo connected over firewire, two external usb drives and another drobo due to be attached.\nCharlie started on Ubuntu 8.04, has been upgraded periodically via dist-upgrade and is currently at 10.04.\nSadly, Charlie is as stable as drunk in a brawl.\nCharlie has frequent kernel panics, OOM's and requires a reboot every 2-3 weeks.  Combing through logs has me scratching my head.\nTo Summarise\nI love Ubuntu server, it's familiar, relatively well laid out, I love aptitude (Which should be the default package manager IMHO, packages/apps such as UFW, Fail2Ban, Denyhosts, logwatch, logrotate etc make administration relatively simple.\nBut both Ubuntu server boxes have uptimes measured in weeks or months, if we're lucky, and yes, during that time we've changed the hardware and re-installed from scracth, tested the disks, tested the RAM.\nBy comparison, I have clusters of HP DL360 G5's, DL380 G5's, DL380 G6's where uptime is measured in years, sometimes, 1000's of days.\nThese are running CentOS - and it doesn't float my boat like UBuntu Server, but it seems so much more stable, yet I don't know whether that's the Hardware or the OS.\nJust my two-pence worth.\n\nA: Terminology and meaning of \"professional use server\"\nFor me the term \"professional use server\" includes a wide range of attributes.\nIt is sometimes difficult to answer such a question.\nFor example the term \"stable\" means for some of us a software that is not crashing.\nWhere as the term \"stable\" also could mean a software that is released/marked as \"stable\" that will not change for the time being released until the next release e.g. release GNU Debian Lenny and following release GNU Debian Squeeze. \nAs you can see \"$stable\" -ne \"stable\" ;)\nSecurity is another elastic term. For example Ubuntu uses always the latest available security compiling flags and features when they compile and build their packages.\nE.g. heap/stack buffer-overflow, address space layout randomization (ASLR) or position-independent executable (PIE). GNU Debian still does not implement PIE in its stable release \"Squeeze\" due to the fact that the source code must be adopted (changed) to make it possible to compile using those security flags and as of stability policy of GNU Debian means not to change things during a running release. However it is planed to enable these features in the next release (Wheezy) which is for now in the testing branch.\nSoftware licensing might be also an issue. GNU Debian spends big efforts to be clear about software licensing issues e.g. Iceweasel vs. Firefox ... That being said that GNU Debian spends big efforts to provide you also with a wide range of real free software stable and ready for production use. Another example is that the main parts of the Linux kernel still stand under GPLv2 and thus GNU Debian does not use non free vendor drivers as much as Ubuntu does. Resulting in a broader hardware support with Ubuntu. At the other hand with GNU Debian you are less exposed to other companies with heavily patents and software licensing based businesses when it comes to interests conflicts.\nAt the very end you have to choose the right GNU distro that mostly suits your needs.\n\nA: There are many things to consider including.\n\n\n*\n\n*Which is newer. Since Debian stable and Ubuntu LTS release at different times One or the other may have newer versions of the packages you care about at the time you come to install. Right now Ubuntu LTS is newer than Debian stable, but that will of course switch around when buster is released.\n\n*What software do you care about? Ubuntu has a distinction between packages in main where Canonical pays people to care about providing updates and packages in Universe where updates are up to the community and where most packages were imported from Debian without a Ubuntu person ever taking a look at them. Debian does not have such strong distinctions.\n\n*Backported kernels, Ubuntu backports kernels from regular releases to the previous LTS release for \"hardware enablement\" and includes those new kernels on installatoin media. Debian also backports kernel's but in a more ad-hoc manner and it does not include those backported kernels on installation media. \n\n*Support lifecycles, Ubuntu LTS releases traditionally have a 5-year support lifecycle at least for server packages in main. Apparently the latest LTS release has increased this to a massive 10 years. Debian gives regular support until 1 year after the next release (typically about 3 years from inital release), on recent releases there has also been \"lts support\" for another couple of years after that, though only for packages the LTS team considers sufficiently important.\n\n*Canonical offers official paid support, while there are certainly paid support options for Debian, none of them are official.\n\n\nWhich of these are most important is a question you will have to consider in light of your particular application.\n", "Q: Where can I download drivers for lenovo s10-3? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to download specific ubuntu drivers for my pc \n\nWhere can I download drivers for Lenovo s10-3 to make it work in Ubuntu 10.xx?\nOr is the XP driver enough to work in Ubuntu?\n\nA: There is a page in the Ubuntu wiki which has information about any issue's and work arounds Here\nLenovo S10 Ubuntu Wiki\nAs Javier explained it should work without much tweaking but it is a good Idea to try it out first on a USB key or Wubi to make sure everything will run smoothly.\n\nA: Xp drivers are useless for Ubuntu (sometimes you can use the wireless one).

Do we need actually swap partition on the ubuntu-server with LAMP?\nI think I don't need it, but better to know for sure if it will not \ncause some unpredicted behaviour.\nActually my thoughts were:\n\n\n*\n\n*The server never hibernates\n\n*If it is swapping one need to think about loadbalancing/traffic shaping, etc...\n\n\nAm I right can I turn off the swap for production server?\nThanks!\n\nA: I have to disagree with having swap on production servers.\nIn my experience, rotational disk swap makes your system less predictable and more prone to frustrating whole system failure. A high load, popular server that is doing anything with a local slow disk will quickly spiral into something far worse than a fail state. Response times will rise to 100x their normal level, and simple things like logging in via the console or ssh may take minutes.\nSSD swap is a special case and would at least remove the seek time slow down that usually kills the system. However, writes are still slow, so you'll still end up waiting a long, long time to recover from an out of control process.\nWithout swap, your LAMP server will simply kill off processes to free up RAM. Proper monitoring should alert you to this, and remove servers from production if critical processes are killed. The worst case here is that your login methods are all killed off and you have to do a hard reset/power cycle. This worst case is still just as likely with an out of control swapping machine, but far harder to detect.\nIf you're using PHP, enable memory limits, and monitor your logs for their failures. Here's a trick, set the limit lower on your dev server than in production. If you're using mod_php under apache, set MaxRequestsPerChild to a few thousand, so that httpd's die before growing too large over time. Above all, monitor memory usage! Often times memory creeps up over time, and you just need to restart a leaky service periodically while you debug the issue.\n\nA: Swap space is used when your system decides that it needs physical memory for active processes and there is insufficient unused physical memory available. If the system happens to need more memory resources or space, inactive pages in physical memory are then moved to the swap space therefore freeing up that physical memory for other uses. \nThis situation will happen many times in server.\na). A non-optimized script can consume large amount of memory \nb). Scripts like backup will always consume huge memory \nc). heavy traffic \nSo it is a good practice to have some swap space. \nMore details: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\n\nA: Using swap will give you one additional safeguard against server instability. There may well be times when RAM is running out, and on server without swap that could result in a soft crash. \nI'm probably in the minority now when I say, it still makes sense, like they used to recommend, to have twice as much swap as you have main memory. Even on a system with 96GB of RAM. \nIt doesn't cost much and, if you need it one day, you'll be glad you got it. The reason for enabling swap is just a very straightforward cost-benefit analysis. Do it! :-)\n\nA: \nAm I right can I turn off the swap for production server?\n\nNo. Always have some swap space.\nI tried running a production server without swap once and about a week later, after a Wordpress update, PHP started eating far more RAM than we'd accounted for. When you run out of RAM and you have swap enabled, things slow down (sometimes a lot, sometimes just a little bit, depending on what gets shoved in there) but you're able to log in, find the problem and try to fix it.\nWhen you run out of RAM and have no swap, processes die, things stall and a lot of the time your only option is a reboot. But until you do that reboot, things will probably break.\nIn my world, broken is far worse than slow.\nOf course if you find your system is constantly using large portions of swap (it will very often use some just as a way of moving out old cached stuff), you obviously have a problem (\"insert RAM please\"), but having it as a safety net is definitely recommended.\n\nIn response to the comment from SpamapS:\nIn the world of \"successful websites\", you have hot failovers, load balancing and other tools that allow a machine to explode and have zero effect on the rest of the site. But that takes a lot of cash. Having redundant hardware isn't economical for most sites, even if they pull in money.\nI completely disagree with your comment on uptime. In a traditional e-commerce set-up if people can't see your site, they can't buy from you. This isn't just e-commerce, all online commercial interests take a lot more flak if you're down for any sort of period. I know because I host sites and services for companies and run my own sites. Slow = grumpy but Down = fury. Even if you only go down for a minute at a time, if a user sees a \"down-for-maintenance\" notice more than a couple of times, they assume you can't keep the site up.\nA slow server is less than ideal but swap isn't there to be run on all the time, it's a last resort to allow things to keep running while you fix them.\nYou also assume there is only one service running on the machine. Again this might be true if you have megabucks to split out everything but in the real world, things get lumped together. Multiple websites, ssh daemons, ftp servers, email servers, etc.  One process leaking into swap might not even effect another service. Without swap, everything has an equal chance of instant, random termination. You have no control over it.\nOf course swap isn't the only answer. You need monitoring to alert you when you're out of ram, but just pulling the plug and rebooting isn't the answer for the majority of people. I'm sure this works for whichever multi-national website you're responsible for but for us mere mortals (that make up the majority of the internet), doing that is commercial suicide.\n\nA: I'd like to thank Oli for the beautiful - i know old - answer. I find partitioning is an always-green topic!\nI totally agree with the line of Oli's post and i'd like to share this - of course improvable - script i use to monitor my servers's swap usage.\nI always configure servers and services to operate with no swap occurrence at all.

I've submitted a patch to hopefully prevent future users from having Wubi render their drive completely unbootable but until that or another fix is accepted this is what you need to do (in Wubi) to get Windows and Ubuntu booting and prevent this from happening again:\n1: Boot from an Ubuntu LiveCD and run sudo software-properties-gtk -e universe && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mbr && sudo install-mbr /dev/sda.  \nIf you have more than one hard drive you will need to change /dev/sda in that last command to the drive windows is on. But it will always be a drive, never a partition. So /dev/sdb might be appropriate but never /dev/sdb1 (doing the latter could overwrite Window's PBR making it even harder to boot back into windows).  \nNow you should be able to boot into Windows or your Wubi install like before.

I set up my Linux server to accept connections from my home PC by adding the public key generated by PuTTYgen to the authorized_keys file.\nNow I'm trying to connect to the same machine, but this time from another Ubuntu machine. I have to use the same private key (for a weird reason, don't ask..) and I don't quite get how to install it on my client Ubuntu.\nDo I have to convert it to some other format?\n\nA: PuTTY/PuTTYgen uses its own proprietary format of key pair. It won't work on Linux, where OpenSSH format of keys prevails.\n\n\n*\n\n*In PuTTYgen, you can directly see (and copy + paste) a public key in the format used by the OpenSSH authorized_keys file.\n\n*You can use the button Save public key to save the public key in the .pub format (RFC 4716). On Linux the file is typically named id_rsa.pub (or id_dsa.pub). But that's typically not needed.\n\n*Use the Conversions > Export OpenSSH key to export the private key in the OpenSSH format. On Linux the file is typically named id_rsa (or id_dsa) and is stored in .ssh folder.\nSee the official Using PuTTYgen, the PuTTY key generator.\nYou can also use a Linux version of PuTTYgen to do the conversion. Linux version is command-line, contrary to Windows version.\nputtygen mykey.ppk ‐O private‐openssh ‐o id_rsa\n\nSee Linux puttygen man page.\n\nA: By coincidence, I just had to do this.  You do need to convert the keys to OpenSSH format.  The command for doing that is:\nssh-keygen -i -f puttygen_key > openssh_key\n\nthen you can copy the contents of openssh_key in to .ssh/authorized_keys just as with a normal SSH key.\nThe -i option is the one that tells ssh-keygen to do the conversion.  The -f option tells it where to find the key to convert.\nThis works for unencrypted keys.  The public key is unencrypted, but the private one is probably encrypted.  I'm not sure if it there's a way to unencrypt the private key, convert it, and then recrypt it.  It may well be easier to use new keys as the other answer suggests (and I'd recommend using ssh-agent though that's orthogonal to the current issue).\n\nA: Andrew Stacey explained how to convert the keys to OpenSSH format on Linux.\nIf you want to do the same on Windows, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start PuTTYGen.\n\n*Click on \"Load\".\n\n*Select your private key and enter the passphrase.\n\n*From the 'Conversions' menu, select \"Export OpenSSH key\".\n\n*Choose destination filename.\n\n\nA: I found one more clear solution.\nOn puttygen create a key, then navigate to Top menu - Conversion  and click export openssh key \nFile content will start and end with \n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- \n\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n\n\n\n*\n\n*for root user Copy that key file to /root/.ssh/ as id_rsa or id_dsa \n\n*for other user Copy that key file to /home/user/.ssh/ as id_rsa or id_dsa\nNote : \n\n\n*\n\n*No need to edit authorized_keys.\n\n*I am using amazon linux \n\n*File permission 0600\n\n\nA: I am not sure if your private key will work in ubuntu, but its worth a shot. just copy the keys to /home/yourName/.ssh/ name the private key as id_rsa, and the public key as id_rsa.pub. \nIf that is not working, then you can create you own ssh key-pair using ssh-keygen and copy the new public key to the server, and ssh as follows\nssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_ubuntu.pub <hostName>\n\nI haven't played with it, but I hear that ssh-agent can also be used to manage ssh-keys.\n\nA: How to re-use your Putty key pairs in Ubuntu as OpenSSH keys:\napt-get install putty-tools #Install Putty tools in Linux\ncd /my-putty-keys\nputtygen mykey-sec.ppk ‐O private‐openssh ‐o my‐openssh‐key.sec\nssh-keygen -i -f mykey-pub.ppk > my-openssh-key.pub\n\nSince purpose of step 4 is to add your public key to *~./ssh/authorized_keys*, so you can use your Putty secret key like this instead of doing 4 as an intermediate step:\nputtygen ‐L mykey-sec.ppk >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n\nA: ** Be careful and make sure you have console access to the box because if you don't do it right, you won't be able to ssh in again until you fix it from the console.\nThe process is much easier than you think. Load the public / private key pair you generated in puttygen again. In puttygen, you'll notice a window in the middle of the screen which says: \"Public key for pasting into Open SSH authorized_keys file:\".\nhighlight the entire contents of the box and press control-c to copy it.\nSSH into your linux box and paste it into the \"/home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys\"  file. I prefer to use nano and just right click to paste it in. Make sure it all stays on one line.\nModify your /etc/sshd_config file as needed and restart your sshd service: \"service ssh restart\"\nIf you need a sample sshd_config file, let me know and I can post mine.\nI've done this on Ubuntu 8.04, 10.04 and 12.04 LTS server and it works slick.\n\nA: The easiest way to install OpenSSH private keys is by creating or editing ~/.ssh/config, as answered below. You need to export your PuTTY private key as an OpenSSH key.\nBest way to use multiple SSH private keys on one client\nHost myshortname realname.example.com\n    HostName realname.example.com\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/realname_rsa # private key for realname\n    User remoteusername\n\nHost myother realname2.example.org\n    HostName realname2.example.org\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/realname2_rsa  # different private key for realname2\n    User remoteusername\n\nThis works on Linux, macOS, Windows, GIT when using OpenSSH.\n\nA: I am not sure if this thread is still active, but I stumbled upon a similar problem with Windows 10 anniversary edition which now support Ubuntu kernel.

Is there a reason to use one over the other?  \nI seem to be constantly running into problems with Flash player freezing crashing, mostly because of running too many flash apps at once (pandora/fantasy apps/youtube/etc). Does using one of these over the other have performance benefits?  Or am I confusing myself and it doesn't really matter as they're both the same?\n\nA: flashplugin-installer is the 'new' name for flashplugin-nonfree. The aim being to more accurately reflect the contents of the package - the package doesn't contain the actual flash player, only an installer that automatically downloads and installs a copy of the plugin. (The file downloaded is the tarball as provided on the Adobe website, but in this case the file is mirrored on Canonical servers.)\nThe reasons you still see flashplugin-nonfree in Synaptic is for backwards compatibility. It is a transitional metapackage with no actual content, all it does is depends on and install flashplugin-installer.\nSo to cut a long story short, there is absolutely no difference between the flashplugin-installer and flashplugin-nonfree packages.\n\nAs for the adobe-flashplugin package - this is provided in the Canonical Partners repository. The difference with this package is that it actually contains the non-free flashplugin itself (it's not just an installer). Note that this package is exactly the same file as can be installed by downloading from the Adobe website.\n\nSo I'm afraid I can't say definitively whether you'll see any performance difference between the flashplugin-* packages and the adobe-flashplugin - but at the end of the day they are the same plugin so it's very unlikely. \n\nA: It makes no difference which one you use, flashplugin-nonfree is a transitional package - a sort of alias that is kept when, for example, a package name is changed - to keep backwards compatibility.\nThese are three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*The flashplugin-nonfree and flashplugin-installer \n    package\n\n\n*\n\n*They download the flash plugin from adobe and install it. This is the default.\n\n\n*The adobe-flashplugin  package from the partner repositories\n\n\n*\n\n*This version is supported by canonical. It will not be as up-to-date, but more stable. Notice that this is a virtual package. It will download flash, Microsoft fonts and so on. But it doesn't seem to be quite the same as the above. The difference must be tiny though, at the time of writing this, the version numbers differ by only a -2 at the end.\n\n\n*Downloading a  .deb package directly from adobe.\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't really see any value in this one,  plus it's not obvious. But if an error message somehow redirects you get.adobe.com/flashplayer you can install it alight. It is the same version as the one in the partner repository. \n\n\n\nMy thanks to jorge castro and fluteflute. \n", "Q: Is there software similar to Lernid for artwork? I'm considering delivering online art tutorials and was thinking of using Lernid when I noticed that it's specifically for Ubuntu-run/related events. Is there any desktop software similar to it?\n\nA: Lernid is by no means \"specifically for Ubuntu-run/related events\" - it is a \"desktop application to participate in online learning events\". Lernid's code shouldn't need modifying to allow you to setup your own events.\nThere is some information on how use Lernid for \"your own purposes\" on the Ubuntu Wiki.\nAs far as I'm aware Lernid does not have specific support for images and video, but it can show \"Powerpoint slides\" and also webpages. So between these you should be able to show images and video.\n\nA: I think Lernid is almost ready to do what you need and it's easy as pie python code.\nSo what I think you need to do is talk to some of the programmers involved in Lernid and perhaps some other developers who might be good friends of yours. See if you can get the small amount of modifications in place to support your use cases and at the same time help lernid become more useful outside of the ubuntu classroom use case.\nFor development see the project page: https://launchpad.net/lernid\n", "Q: is there any kind of utility/protocol that can take premissions from root users? well i encountered a problem that i described in this question:\nProblem with permissions after upgrading\nand while speaking with my friend about it he mentioned some kind of protocol that can take\nthe permissions from root users he called it clinux but it think i misheard him because when i tried to google it, nothing came up.\n\nA: SELinux, but that almost certainly has nothing to do with the problem you encountered.

For a task of mine I need to list all the files in a tree (a directory, all its subdirs, all subdirs of those, etc.).\nI'd prefer to see them in Nautilus or Krusader, but a command-line solution is interesting as well (in this case I will need files full names, sizes and modification times to be listed).\n\nA: tree will be very convenient for you.\nsudo apt-get install tree\n\nusing tree filepathto list the files.\n\nA: As Oli answered, find will allow you to search an entire directory tree:\nfind /path/ -printf \"%TY-%Tm-%Td\\t%s\\t%p\\n\"\n\n# Where %TY will display the mod. time year as 4 digits\n#       %Tm will display the mod. time month as 2 digits\n#       %Td will display the mod. time day as 2 digits\n#       %s displays the file size in bytes\n#       %p displays the full path name of the file\n\nYou may also want to use the -type f option to limit the results to just files. If you want to match a file pattern, you want the -name or -iname options (case sensitive, and case insensitive matching, respectively). Take a read through find's man page - there are a substantial amount of options that you can use to narrow/refine your search.\nAnd just as an aside, if you are expecting to have multiple screenfuls of data get thrown back at you, remember to pipe your results through less.\n@Oli : +1 I just learned something new as well - column. Hadn't used that before.\n\nA: ls is the standard command to list files in Ubuntu and other Linux and Unix operating systems. ls is particularly useful to learn because you will find it installed on every Unix system you ever meet. By default running this displays only the files in the current directory. \nHowever the -R 'flag' is the recursive option (note the capital R, not r) which will show you all the sub-directories as well.\nYou asked for \"details\" too - for this you want the -l flag (that's a lowercase L, not the number one). Be aware this gives you file permissions information as well as file size, time/date info and file name.\nIf you want to also show hidden files/folders (the equivalent of Ctrl+H in Nautilus) then add the -a 'all' flag.\nYou can merge flags together, to give you something like:\nls -lR\n\nIf you run this on any decent sized folder you will find this produces a huge long output that scrolls down your screen very fast. To get around this, you can 'pipe' the output of ls through a program called less (the name is a parody of the similar more which was around first but has more features).\nls -lR | less\n\nThis will allow you to use the up/down arrow keys, alongside PageUp/Down to go through the output at a more comfortable speed.\n\nA: ls -alR\n\nThat's probably the simplest method.

Remember that you can usually install Ubuntu by installing the target harddrive in another computer and complete the installation there, which may be the quickest workaround in such a situation.\nCause analysis and general advice\nThe cause of the issue seems to be that the USB or SATA device isn't available or detection is too slow at the time the kernel takes over during the boot process, so that it can't find the image of the live OS to load. Similar to the recommendation in the data integrity section above, try burning optical installation media when you are unable to boot from USB and vice versa. If that's not possible because your computer only has USB 3.0 ports and no internal optical drive, try booting from an integrated SD card reader. Also look out for available firmware updates for your computer that may fix the issue. If you are trying to install from an ISO of an older release, then please try the latest ISO.\nAs a last resort you can try to use the minimal ISO, which doesn't seem to load another filesystem except initrd but requires a working Internet connection for installation. I would recommend this for Intel Macs from Apple that have this issue.\nHardware issues on laptops and desktops\nThere seem to be issues on laptops from Dell, Lenovo, Toshiba, Sony and may be other manufacturers. Non-custom built desktops may also be affected and as far as I am aware this is specific to modern AMD processors.\nTry changing the firmware settings (BIOS/UEFI) for SATA (set to AHCI mode) when using optical media or use another (non 3.0) USB port when using USB, this seems to work in most cases.\nHardware issues on Gigabyte mainboards\nThere apparently was or still is an issue on some Gigabyte mainboards with the IOMMU on AMD platforms (Intel calls this VT-d).\nI found the following post on the forums (1, 2):\n\nTurns out the IOMMU needs to be enabled in the BIOS. This problems seems to be exclusive to Gigabyte boards.\n\nAs well as this answer here on AU:\n\nGigabyte UEFI boot issues - The partition size of the created USB Installer device needs to be under that of 4GB.

(did you try to boot with this very stick on another machine?), check that BIOS is set for booting from \"USB-HDD\" or something like that as first boot device.\nEdit: I can see this was done. Maybe other BIOS settings for USB or HD access need to be corrected. Your error indicates mounting problems. \nFrom here we can only guess. Try switching from IDE to AHCI, deactivate BIOS support for any non-existent devices, check your BIOS is up to date etc. I do believe it is some BIOS issue we have here.\n\nA: ya you should first make the default booting device to usb drive. i think you have chosen unetbootin for burning which is not useful i myself faced same problem. use multi boot iso which is good...\n\nA: Greetings.

If you use this carelessly you can end up with a broken system. Please try the other answers first before doing this.\nYou can delete the lock file with the following command:\nsudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock\n\nYou may also need to delete the lock file in the cache directory\nsudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\n\nAfter that, try opening Synaptic again.  \n\nA: (Note: my original answer was extensively edited by Guillem Jover, the primary dpkg developer.)\nI see pretty much all the answers recommend deleting the lock. That must never be done, it is always preferable to kill dpkg (which is supposed to be resilient against that kind of event), than to even think about removing its lock file (where its presence does not indicate the lock being held). The locks are acquired when a dpkg or an apt process is running, and are released (by the kernel if necessary) when the processes complete or are killed. Newer dpkg and apt versions will print the PID of the process holding the contended lock file, and apt now even waits by default for the locks to be released. This is covered in the dpkg FAQ.\nIf you try:\nsudo fuser -vik -TERM /var/lib/dpkg/lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend /var/lib/apt/lists/lock\nsudo dpkg --configure --pending\n\nthat will prompt to terminate any process currently holding these lock files, which, once killed will get the locks released. If you see an apt-get process or an aptitude process that looks stuck, killing them should be less harmful than when the packaging system is in the middle of a package installation. If the processes are really stuck and you have no other choice, you might need to kill them by passing -KILL instead of -TERM. You then need to finish any pending configuration so that dpkg can get those into a better state, and so that it can also integrate updates to its journal to the main status database.\nKilling a dpkg process directly, if present, is in general not a great idea, because if dpkg is active, some maintainer script might be performing actions that are not resilient against abrupt termination (or crashes), but dpkg internally should be resilient to such abrupt terminations, and it's preferable to do that, than to remove any lock file, which has a way higher chance of damaging both the dpkg database and the filesystem.\nKilling a frontend such as an apt-get or aptitude process, while not ideal, is in general much safer.\n\nA: In my case, I had to wait for several minutes for the lock to be released  (looks like apt used to hold it). This all happened right after system boot.\n\nA: Only one program can hold the lock. Make sure that you are not running aptitude, synaptic or adept. Close the program and run it again it should work.You may either have synaptic open, or have another terminal window open running apt-get, or have the update manager running.Check it and see if any of those are running,if any of them is running close it and try again.\nTry this command in terminal to find what is running             \nps -e | grep -e apt -e adept | grep -v grep\n\nNote:\nIf that doesn’t print anything, type the following in terminal to remove the lock                       \nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock    \nsudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock\n\nNow you can install any Packages.\n\nA: So far the best way to get it working without breaking a possible background running installation ( as it could happen by removing the lock file), is stopping the service using apt:\nError:\n# sudo apt-get upgrade\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?`\n\nSolution:\nsudo systemctl stop apt-daily.timer\n\nAfter upgrading the system I suggest re-enabling it, as the bug locking it could be fixed with the upgrade. \nsudo systemctl start apt-daily.timer \nI haven't verified this error gets fixed after upgrading. I'll add a new comment once I have that verified\n\nA: I have had this issue numerous times. For me, it was almost always caused by apt-get or some GUI that called it getting hung for some reason. I had to kill it which left various locks in place.\nThe other answers bring up very good points about making sure no updates are currently running before doing anything drastic like removing lock files. However, once you are sure that's not the case, the following usually works for me. I got it by reading many answers to questions like this one.\nWhile most or all of this is presented in the other answers, this distills the fix down to a few commands.\nsudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock\nsudo fuser -vki /var/cache/apt/archives/lock\nsudo fuser -vki /var/cache/debconf/config.dat\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nUse for unlocking the package system after an update of some kind crashed or terminated without finishing in some other way.  These commands should be run in the order presented.\n\nA: First of all we should check what process created the lock file using lsof:\nsudo lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock\n\nor in another situation where /var/lib/apt/lists/lock is problematic:\nsudo lsof /var/lib/apt/lists/lock\n\nThe output will be close to something like:\nCOMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF    NODE NAME\napt-get   12127 root   4uW  REG  252,1        0    86   /var/lib/apt/lists/lock\n\nThen we should check what the commad is doing, we can find it out using ps, pgrep etc; the command is apt-get so I run:\npgrep apt-get -a\n\nThe -a switch lists the full command for me, in my case it's:\n pgrep -a apt-get\n 12127 apt-get update\n\nwe can see that it's running update subcommand, I could run something like this too:\nps -f 12127\n\nwhich produces:\nUID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY      STAT   TIME CMD\nroot     12127 12126  0 09:39 pts/0    S+     0:00 apt-get update\n\nIn this case I would wait for some minute for resource to be freed and if after 2 or 3 minute problem still exist or the command was something that I didn't care about or was not harmful for system (like this apt-get update) I send a SIGTERM to the process:\nsudo kill -15 12127\n\nIt should do the work, If it didn't I'm going to send SIGINT this time (It's like pressing CTRL+C):\nsudo kill -2 12127\n\nIf it didn't work too, we should send an SIGHUP (kill -1), and finally if nothing works I simply kill the process:\nsudo kill -9 12127\n\nor\nsudo pkill -9 apt-get\n\nThen I remove busy resources:\nsudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock\n\n\nA: I don't see this answer anywhere above but on Ubuntu 16.04, I encountered this problem as well.  The cause was the time on my computer was set into the future.  (This is because I'm on a Windows+Ubuntu dual boot system and I guess I have messed up local time vs UTC time.)\nOne odd thing was that the locked file's date and time was the exact date and time that I ran the program.\nI then used \"fuser\" as described in earlier posts and apt worked, but I was getting complaints about needing to run dpkg -a -reconfigure.  When I did that, I got errors like:\nnewline in field name #padding\n\nin files like '/var/lib/dpkg/updates/0003'.\nAll of this was very strange as I've never seen it before.  So, I thought these were symptoms and changed my data and time manually.  I knew there was a problem with the date/time when I logged in, but was ignoring it.  (Previously, it was setting it automatically via the Internet and NTP).\nThen, all of the above problems were fixed...  Hopefully, this helps someone else!  The most notable symptom is perhaps the date/time of the lock file being the exact date/time that you are trying to run the command.\n\nA: In my case, X crashed while apt-get was still removing old kernels. I used the System Monitor to confirm it was still running and not stuck. Everything was fine once the process finished.\n\nA: Check the Launcher to see if Software Updater is running. If so maximize it and have a look at what it is doing. If it is still checking, then wait for it to complete. When it completes it might tell you the software is up-to-date so close the app. If it says there are updates available, either do the update or click \"remind me later\". After this this app closes you can go back to using apt-get or apt.\nIf Software Updater is not running, just use the Dash to invoke it and the wait for completion and then decide if you want to update or click \"remind me later\". After this this app closes you can go back to using apt-get or apt.\n\nA: sudo killall -9 apt && sudo killall -9 dpkg\n\nUse at your own risk\n\nA: Remove your /var/lib/dpkg/lock file and force package reconfiguration.\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nIt should work after this.\n\nA: This error may be caused by the Update Manager trying to automatically refresh the list of packages in background, usually right after your login, thus locking the  directory.\nIn this case just wait few seconds (or more, if your last update was long ago) for it to complete or launch Update Manager to check the status.\n\nA: In my case I was getting the same message by not realizing I had switched to root user and was trying sudo apt-get. Once I realized this I just ran apt-get, and it worked. Silly, but it might still explain the error for some.\n\nA: in my case, after:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Firefox.\n\n*Open terminal\n\n\nI typed\n\nsudo apt update\nsudp apt upgrade\n\nthen I get that problems\n\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\nI fixed that, running the command that was showed me after run sudo apt update\napt list --upgradable\n\nThis command will show you a list of programs in my case only Firefox, I closed Firefox, then could ran the command again without problems.\nsudo apt upgrade\n\n\nA: Don't be so fast to remove something, it may totally damage your system; rather wait until the currently installing or uninstalling program finishes its task and after that you will get access. If you think that there is nothing currently installing or uninstalling, then just reboot your system with the command sudo reboot.\n\nA: The most likely way to hit this is:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot Ubuntu\n\n*start a terminal \n\n*type sudo apt-get install whatever\nand the command-line apt overlaps with update-manager automatically polling.\nSo if you try again in a few minutes that should fix it.\n\nA: You will get this message if you forget to use sudo when executing an apt command.\nOtherwise this is a sign that something else is installing or removing software and has locked the apt database while it performs the actions. The programs that can do this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Software Center\n\n*The Update Manager\n\n*The apt link installer (I think this now goes through SC)\n\n*The apt-get or aptitude command line utilities.\n\n*The Synaptic Package Manager\n\n\nIMPORTANT: only try the below as a last resort since it can crash your system. First try killing any running instance of apt or aptitude as described in Faheem's answer.\nYou can force the lock off by removing the file, but it's not recommended without first closing the program that's holding the lock safely, since you could cause corruption or interrupt an installation (bad). The command provided by João should close the program that holds the lock and then remove the lock but won't protect you from install interruption:\nsudo fuser -cuk /var/lib/dpkg/lock; sudo rm -f /var/lib/dpkg/lock   \n\nAnd the same command can be used for the apt cache lock:\nsudo fuser -cuk /var/cache/apt/archives/lock; sudo rm -f /var/cache/apt/archives/lock\n\n\nA: If you have security updates set to auto-install this will happen frequently. I literally wait 30 seconds and it fixes the issue. Just throwing this out there in case anyone else encounters this issue. \n\nA: For people who are interested in proactively preventing this bug in their scripts, I found that the -q flag on apt upgrade -yq was causing this issue for me. During the upgrade process I guess it would occasionally give me warnings (something along the lines of updating the desktop, would I like to continue), and if these warnings were suppressed, then I guess that causes apt to not unlock the files it was protecting and it got stuck.\nAdmittedly, I had trouble reproducing this error 100% of the time, but eliminating that -q option completely fixed the issue for me.\n\nA: Like most everyone else I waited for the lock to be removed. After 30 minutes I gave up and hard booted to a different distribution. From there I used the internet for some research which landed me here.\nIt turns out unattended-upgrades.service is running. I found that be rebooting into the broken system and running:\nsudo systemctl disable apt-daily.service\nsudo systemctl disable unattended-upgrades.service\nsudo systemctl disable apt-daily-upgrade.service\nsudo systemctl disable apt-daily-upgrade.timer\nsudo systemctl disable apt-daily.timer\nsudo shutdown -r # Note it will take a couple minutes to reboot\n\nallowed me to get the broken system working again for:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\nsudo apt install -f\n\nHowever it didn't fix the kept-back packages and impossible situation reported by apt in the first place. It would appear this was causing apt to lock up at boot in the first place.\n\nA: I have tried the top upvoted answers on this page and they always worked for me without exception, however I discovered an easier way to solve this problem. First some theory. What happens before a user gets this error message?\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/) is another process using it?  \n\n/var/lib/dpkg/lock is locked so the terminal temporarily can't use it, but what process is it locked by? This depends on the circumstances. If you have booted the computer a few minutes ago it is probably locked by the Software app. Try closing the terminal and launching the Software app. If the Software app is indeed locking /var/lib/dpkg/lock it will show a screen that says Software catalog is being downloaded when you open it.\n\nAfter the Software app finishes updating it will show a popup notification message, and another Software Updater window may also appear as show below. Otherwise the Software app will remove its own lock without the user needing to run any commands in the terminal.\n\nAfter it has finished updating the software the Software Updater will remove its own lock without the user needing to run any commands in the terminal.\nAnother case where this answer is useful is in a VM when booting an Ubuntu guest OS that has been inactive for a while. Normally the Ubuntu guest OS starts to update almost immediately. The updating process frequently locks out commands that require installing, removing or updating software until it finishes. Open the Software app, let it finish running and install whatever updates that you want it to install. The Software app will remove its own lock when it finishes.\n\nA: Just reboot and it will auto fix the problem.\nThis is your installation interrupted accidently.\n\nA: Adding this only in the hope that it might be connected, I have not tested this solution. If deleting the lock files does not help, and if it is not even recommended according to the accepted answer, it might help how the similar problem dpkg: error: dpkg status database is locked by another process could be solved using the recovery mode with sudo dpkg --configure -a in the root shell prompt.\nCopy from there:\nI had removed the lock files, and there was no PID running, yet, whenever I executed sudo dpkg --configure -a, the shell was stuck at one of the previously locked \"apt\" tasks that I had force-closed by closing the terminal in the end.\nI also killed the apt processes using sudo killall apt apt-get. The stuck apt task in my case was \"Setting up docker-ce (5:20.10.1~3-0~ubuntu-bionic)\".\nSolution in my case:\n\n*\n\n*Boot in recovery mode.\n\n*In the recovery menu, choose \"root\" in order to \"Drop to root shell prompt\".\n\n*Press Enter.\n\n*Type sudo dpkg --configure -a.\n\n*Go on with what you were about to do, it should work now, and / or just reboot.\n\nPlease see screenshots and detailed explanation (e.g. how to get the recovery mode at start) at the answer of docker ps stuck … docker install also just hangs.\n\nA: My solution was:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\n\nRuntime environment:\n   Operation System: Ubuntu 18.04\n   Computer:Dell Precision 5510\n", "Q: Why is my terminal freezing up? Sometimes when my terminal freezes up and it will not let me type. I can not identify any causes, nor how to diagnose.

It's the terminal pause key that stops all output until you press Ctrl-Q to resume.\n\nA: A good general way to diagnose mysterious hangs:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a(nother) terminal, and use ps axo pid,wchan:32,cmd to find the other process id\n\n*note the wchan column, which should tell you whether it's stuck in the kernel\n\n*run sudo strace -p PID inserting the pid of that process; paste that into a bug report or question\n\n\nIf there's anything aside from just a dash in the wchan column, then the process is in the kernel doing something.

I would try using Alt-SysRq-T to see what tasks seem to be running, then file a bug based on that.  It would also be interesting to know whether Alt-SysRq-B reboots it or not.\n\nA: After various experiments, I've reached a solution for this laptop.\nI've installed gentoo, compiling a kernel with CONFIG_SONY_LAPTOP and CONFIG_SONYPI_COMPAT enabled. With that driver included, setting reboot=bios on the kernel command line worked (of course, as reboot=bios depends on x86-32, it probably won't work on x86-64 and another solution will be needed). Even though I found this solution in gentoo, it would almost certainly work in Ubuntu too.\nAfter more experimenting, it turns out that the only thing I needed was reboot=bios. However, that doesn't work on x86-64, so I'm stuck with x86-32 (that doesn't matter much though; this netbook only has 1GB of RAM).\n\nA: did you also try specifying multiple params?\nAvoid using the kbd method if the keyboard controller dosen't exists(i actually never encountered this situation, but from old experiences with DOS, accessing invalid controllers may lead to system hangup)..\nAre you sure that when the system hangs all other apps are closed?\nDid you try looking into lastlog?\n", "Q: What is the best way to control music on my PC from my iphone or android?

To my understanding there's no reason why a Wayland plugin can't hide the app in the local machine, forward it's windows to a remote machine, and feed the app input from the remote machine. Am I wrong?\n\nA: What a lot of people don't understand about about Wayland is that it's not intended as a complete replacement for everything Xorg does, if it were then it would have no advantage over Xorg. We've become so accustom to the display server protocal, X11, supporting network transparency, font rendering (hardly ever used anymore), drawing of polygons and archs (also hardly ever used anymore)... that we simply expect that that's what a display server does.\nWayland is a display server, and only a display server. It composites buffers to the screen using a very basic protocol, and leaves all other features to a different level, they are out of the scope of Wayland.\nOne way to think of it is to ask a similar question about the sound architecture in Linux rather than the graphics architecture.\nDoes ALSA support network transparency? The answer is no, that's outside the scope of ALSA. But you can still use network transparency in linux, that's why we have pulseaudio.\nYour question is slightly different, but I think is still based on the idea that this is something Wayland itself should support.\nCan ALSA have network transparency implemented as a plugin? I would answer no, because I wouldn't consider pulseaudio to be a \"plugin\" for ALSA, but rather something that runs on top of ALSA.\nSo \"Can Wayland have network transparency implemented as a plugin\"? No, but that doesn't in any way mean that you won't be able to use network transparency with Wayland.\nXorg can run on top of Wayland, and just as efficiently as if Xorg itself were the display server. So you can still use \"ssh -X\" and get a local window for a remote app, running right alongside all your other local windows that may be native Wayland clients.\nSo Wayland will in no way prevent you from using X11 applications remotely, exactly as you do today. And in addition it allows efficient implementations of other protocols for network transparency, like RDP, VNC, and even HTML5: http://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2010/11/23/gtk3-vs-html5/\nI hope that short novel answers your question :)\n\nA: \nSo what I want to know is: can Wayland's compositor plugins implement\n  network transparency, even if it's in a somewhat hackish way, so that\n  apps that are written directly to Wayland without an intermediary\n  layer like X11 still get network transparency.\n\nYes, a Wayland compositor could do this. I don't expect there to be many applications interfacing directly with Wayland rather than through toolkits like Qt/GTK though.\n\nA: Switching terminology from Wayland, which now is the name just for the protocol, to Weston, the reference Wayland protocol implementation.\nSo the answer is: yes, Weston has a module that implements network transparency without passing through X11. See for example this RealVNC Wayland implementation.\n", "Q: Save an edited file in nano, but no permissions I edited a file in  /etc/ that I want to save, but forgot to open it using sudo. I remember there was a command to save such a file in vi, and want to know if there is any such way to do it in nano?\nThanks.\n\nA: Just open a new tab in terminal, use chmod to change permissions of the file to 777, save the file in nano, then change the permissions back to what they were, probably 644. An alternative is to change owner using chown to yourself, save the file, and change ownership back to root.\n\nA: Yes you could save it temporarily to your home directory.

I would like to use Ubuntu One on all of my computers, but I don't want all of the files to be synced with every computer.  Some of my computers don't have a big enough hard drive to sync everything.  I would like to have access to the files in the cloud, without having everything stored on my hard drive.  Is this a current or planned feature?\n\nA: Yes, it's possible.\nWhile files that are placed in the main Ubuntu One folder (~/Ubuntu One/) will currently get synced to all your Ubuntu One enabled computers, you do control which additional folders get synced. Although this functionality isn't currently exposed in a user-friendly way, you can still use it via u1sdtool: you can subscribe (and unsubscribe) to folders using u1sdtool --subscribe=<folder id> (and, respectively, --unsubscribe=<folder id>); you can get the folder id from u1sdtool --list-folders.\nWhen on one computer you select “synchronize this folder with Ubuntu One” in nautilus (or u1sdtool --create-folder=/path/to/folder), your other computers do a “folder merge” and start syncing that folder too, if the value of udf_autosubscribe in /etc/xdg/ubuntuone/syncdaemon.conf is set to True.\nSo, on the computer with a smaller hard drive, edit that file and set the value of udf_autosubscribe to False. You can then manually add the folders you want to be included using u1sdtool. With this you have access to some of your files immediately, and you can fall back to the web interface for the rest.\nThis is not the same as having something like a webdav mount, but it probably covers your needs.\n\nA: It is possible in the latest versions to disable what folders are synced to a particular computer by unchecking them in the folders tab. Note that they will still be stored on the cloud for all other computers.\nThis won't automatically unsubscribe after so much being downloaded, but you have more control over what is selected, and it's a halibut easier.\nFurther, there is an option to not subscribe automatically to new folders. Try that, too.\n\nA: this is not a current feature maybe it would be a planned one. for the above purpose you can use a file sharing site or maybe you can choose to use a cloud os . you can use jolicloud which is good\n\nA: I have to note that we have a bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-client/+bug/682878 which causes the files to continue being downloaded from unsubscribed folders so this --unsubscribe feature is not that useful now.\n", "Q: How can I find the version number of an installed package via dpkg?

The way I've solved this in the past is to pass a stupidly long COLUMNS argument to make it expand:\nCOLUMNS=200 dpkg -l network-manager\n\nwhich gives me the entire version number, but also a bunch of junk:\nDesired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold\n| Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend\n|/ Err?=(none)/Reinst-required (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)\n||/ Name                                         Version                                      Description\n+++-============================================-============================================-========================================================================================================\nii  network-manager                              0.8.3~git.20101118t223039.d60a988-0ubuntu1   network management framework daemon\n\nNow I can see the full version number, which is 0.8.3~git.20101118t223039.d60a988-0ubuntu1.\nI get the feeling that this is not the proper way to find the version number of an installed package.

This situation is covered in the Ubuntu One FAQ.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOne/FAQ/WhyIsItTakingSoLongForMyFilesToSync\nMost users notice this issue when they add a new computer to sync with their Ubuntu One cloud or enable a new folder for syncing... but it generally happens when there are lots of new files to sync. The Ubuntu One team has made improving this experience a priority for the Natty cycle. Most of the enhancements are to the server side so everyone will benefit as they are deployed.\nIf you see slow file sync and you know that only a few files have changed, it might be related to a temporary disruption.

The default music player does not play .wav files. Please help me.\n\nA: Ensure you have installed the restricted extra's package from the software centre, you may also find the following worth a read.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats\n\nA: If you are trying to import music from CD.\nWell,I was in the exactly same situation and was looking for the .wav codec for rhythmbox.\nBut I rethink it over at the first place, wav codec means uncompressed format. So I just copy the wav files in the cd folder and paste them to music directry for Rhythmbox.\nAfter copy & paste, rename the files as you like.\n\nA: The WAV file format isn't very practical for use in music players like Rhythmbox which want to present all the collected files in a library, because WAV doesn't support tagging (track name, artist, album name, genre, track number, etc.).\nIt's also very inefficient regarding diskspace because it's only using uncompressed PCM where lossless codecs like FLAC still deliver the exact same audio quality and usually provide tagging functionality.\nTo debunk the myth that only WAV delivers real CD quality:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lossless is what it says it is. It introduces no loss during encoding, contrary to overenthusiastic marketing for MP3 downloads with 128 kbits or Compact Cassettes. If lossless encoding would still cause loss, you wouldn't want to use ZIP or similar compression methods.\n\n*WAV isn't what's stored on the CD. If you believe in never touching the signal stream that comes from the CD to retain maximum quality and your programs output is WAV you already \"altered\" the format. WAV is more comparable to a container format, the link to the Wikipedia article even offers MP3 in WAV format.\n\n\nA: you can use vlc or install codecs of it through internet...\n", "Q: Error caused by Dropbox in update manager I am getting the following error message when the update manager runs:\n\nApt Authentication issue\nProblem during package list update.\n  The package list update failed with a\n  authentication failure.

By any chance may this be caused because of my rebooting in Windows after the kernel update.  \nUpdate 3\nInstalled older kernel by chrooting through live USB, still the same problem with the kernel, so it seems the problem is not due to kernel update after all.  \nI have faced this problem earlier too but back then, I just considered reinstalling distribution easier (I used to distro switch a lot). But now I had configured it too far and so looking for some last resort.    \nUpdate 4\nReinstalled Ubuntu. Configuration was easier this time thanks to separate home and workspace partitions. Even tough I don't need the solution of this problem just now but if you know any possible solution please post here for future benefit.  \n\nA: I had the same issue like the thread starter and I solved it without reinstalling.\nMy issue occurred while juggling with a virtual installation based on a copied disk image. This resulted in a changed uuid and the copy wouldn't start. This is a rough sketch of what i did.\nFirst boot using a rescue system (same version) and run a shell on your non-booting disk.\nHave a look at /etc/fstab and confirm the uuids there by issuing the blkid command for each device. Fix these entries as they're important.\nNext we fix grub with:\n\n\n*\n\n*grub-mkconfig\n\n*update-grub\nThen run:\n\n\n*\n\n*update-initramfs -u /boot/initrd.img-2.6.YOURVERSION-HERE\nThis will create a fresh initramdisk for your version. If you don't know the exact version you were running have a look at the files in /boot/. Picking the highest version number should be safe.\nAfter you exit the rescue shell the ubuntu live cd will offer you the last menu from where you entered the shell. Choose \"install Grub\" (or similar) there and enter the device where to put your boot sector.\nOn most systems (standard install) /dev/sda is a safe bet. Be aware: Windows- or other multiboot-systems might need other entries here!\nFinally you should be able to boot from the repaired disk.\n\nA: The problem seems to be that your hard disk, or the controller, doesn't respond quickly enough.\nTry the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the boot menu comes up, having\nthe top of the list highlighted,\npress e (for edit).\n\n*You should see a long list of parameters. Add this one to it:\nrootdelay=130\n\n*Hit Enter and then b (boot). Try to see if you system boots now. You can increase the value if that doesn't help first time (but not by much, 130 is already more than enough for any hardware that isn't broken).\nHowever, it may also be your hard drive is failing. The first thing to do once you get back into your system is backing up your data.  If you want to be safe, back it up using an ubuntu cd. I strongly urge you to do that, sooner rather than later.\n\nA: As a matter of fact I have experienced disk UUIDs changing spontaneously once or twice. The change may be the result of a corruption of some sort. I would try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your computer from a live medium;\n\n*fdisk -l /dev/sda to find the partition you're looking for; or use cfdisk; or usegparted(replacesda` by your hard drive).\n\n*blkid /dev/sda1 (replace sda1 by the partition you found); alternatively use vol_id;\n\n*see if you can mount the partition (using the device file /dev/sda1);\n\n*check if the UUID displayed matches with the UUID in your root partition's /etc/fstab;\n\n*generate a new UUID using uuidgen and apply it to the partition using tune2fs -U;\n\n*change the fstab entry accordingly.\n\n\nIt might seem unlikely that something as vital as the UUID changes without apparent cause, but it happens, probably because of a bug. See if changing the UUID to a new value helps.\n\nA: When I saw this on my system, it was a matter of the wrong UUID being set as the boot root parameter in /boot/grub/menu.lst .\ncat /proc/cmdline actually shows the boot parameters passed to initramfs -- if you see that initramfs is being told to mount a non-existent root partition, it's obviously going to fail.\nupdate-grub did not update these parameters for me, but simply doing a manual replacement for the old UUID in the menu.lst fixed it for me.\n\nA: Have you got an older kernel? \nDoes it work?\nCheck /etc/fstab as loevborg said about possible 'stale' records (i had the same problem when installed lvm and grub2 - there was an old record for /boot partition which caused the error)\n\nA: I dont have any idea of what can cause this but as a solution you can try reinstalling Grub only. I think it will solve your problem.\n\nA: Tried all the answers but could not solve it so finally hadd to reinstall ubuntu :(.  \nThis same error came in my friends comp too, but he had no luck with it too. \n\nA: This issue appeared for me after installing libuuid. I was able to fix it manually and now it boots OK, but every time it still shows errors about missing blkid. Also, boot failure re-appears after updates that require rebooting.\nThe UUID in the /proc/cmdline is correct, however system fails to recognize it.\n\nA: How to Fix an Ubuntu Error: \"No init found. Try passing init= bootarg\"\nThis morning, a friend came to me with his laptop that won't boot. At every boot attempt, his Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx system outputs the following error messages:\nmount: mounting /dev/disk/by-uuid/***************************** on /root\nfailed: Invalid argument\nmount: mounting /sys on /root/sys failed: No such file or directory\nmount: mounting /dev on /root/dev failed: No such file or directory\nmount: mounting /sys on /root/sys failed: No such file or directory\nmount: mounting /proc on /root/proc failed: No such file or directory\nTarget file system doesn't have /sbin/init\nNo init found.

Listing /dev/disk/by-uuid also showed the expected UUID sitting there.  The drive is perfectly mountable within busybox as well.  All the normal files expected in [/mnt]/boot/ are present (for kernel 3.13.0-36).\nI got the computer to boot by (from inside of busybox) changing the /etc/fstab's UUID reference for the root partition to be /dev/sda1 (modify as appropriate for your setup).  I'm not sure, however, that this step is important, since alone it didn't make a difference.  What did was upon the next reboot, sitting at grub, hitting \"e\" to edit the Ubuntu default boot, and stripping out the entire \"if ... fi\" construct, and replacing the \"linux\" line's UUID= with the /dev/sda1 .   This approach allowed the computer to boot fully.\nIn the end the problem turned out to be a failed second hard drive was causing a massive delay in the disk search sequence. \n\nA: I fixed this myself editing the file /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\" rootdelay=3 \"\nGRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true\n\nWith only the first one, it was not enough. I even tried a 130 as stated before. Then I disabled UUID with the second command. It was a LVM root partition anyway, so the UUID data was pointless.\n\nA: In my case:\nThe OSs are installed in ext4 with Ubuntu 14.04\nbut I found when I install other ubuntu edition like 10.04 after the Ubuntu 10.04\nand Also compile the Ubuntu 10.04 kernel and use dpkg to install it.\nthe error is appeared.\nFinally, the problem is in grub.cfg.\nBecause Ubuntu 10.04 default use ext2 for OS so the initramfs will load ext2's driver not use ext4 driver...\nSo replace ext2 to ext4 in grub.cfg to fix it.\n\nA: i have same problem in ubuntu after hours i searching i just realised that grub try to boot sdb5 and my kali is on sda5 \nso boot with live cd and try to mount ur linux os with mkdir and mount command if it exist try to fix grub by holding shift in load and hit e and change root dev\nand if it works make it permanent\n\nA: This could also happen if you've cloned a partition or especially the entire hard drive and partition table with dd.  If this has happened usually an fsck of all partitions in question will solve it.\nSource: http://realtechtalk.com/UbuntuDebianLinux_wont_boot_and_drops_to_Busybox_shell_after_cloning_HDD_with_dd-1978-articles\n\nA: Apart from all the other answers, try going to the grub menu (press SHIFT while booting to be in Ubuntu Advanced options) and select your older working kernel.

It can be installed from the Ubuntu Software Store (It is called GNOME Tweaks).  Or if you prefer the console: sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\nRun it after installing, then under Power, Turn off the setting to do nothing when lid is closed.

Open the dash (super key), search for \"power\" and then select the correct option in the dropdown. Note that closing the lid will actually turn off the screen though plus any external monitors:\n\nIf you move the mouse then any connected monitors will power back up with the laptop closed. This will then become the primary monitor.\nThis might either have been removed at some point, or it requires some hardware support which is not available in all systems: Since 16.04, I don't have 'when the lid is closed' options in power settings as there have been reports that it was not visible on Ubuntu 21.04.\n\nA: There is a bug with some laptops and monitors that makes Ubuntu not honor the \"do nothing\" setting when the laptop's lid is closed. I have not been able to find a complete solution, but maybe there is something to do with this link where they hint at this file : /etc/default/acpi-support and using:\ngconftool-2 -t string /apps/gnome-power-manager/buttons/lid_ac -s \"blank\"\ngconftool-2 -t string /apps/gnome-power-manager/buttons/lid_battery -s \"blank\"\n\n\nA: For Saucy:\nEdit /etc/systemd/logind.conf and set HandleLidSwitch=lock to lock the screen on lid close (but not suspend), or HandleLidSwitch=ignore to not even lock the screen.\nThis is due to an upstream GNOME change. See GNOME bug 687277 for the rationale for this change.\n\nA: You can easily disable the lid lock feature by clicking the System Settings icon in the Launcher/Task bar, and then clicking on Brightness & Lock.\nFrom there, you flip the Lock switch to the off position, and un-check the \"Require my password when wakening from suspend.\" check-box.\n\nAnother thing you have to watch for if you also plan on setting up hibernation (suspend-to-disk) is whether or not your system has a large enough swap partition to actually go into hibernation.  Hibernation is different than suspend, but sometimes people like to set up the hibernation feature while they are configuring suspend.\nYou can also go over your Power settings, so they don't suspend the system when the lid is close.  You can do this in System Setting -> Power.\n\n\nA: 11.04 and previous versions\nyou can also go to system->preferences->power management\nnear bottom of the window you will find a dropdown where you can select what your system does when lid is closed\n\nA: 12.04\nIn System Settings, open Brightness & Lock.  On that page, uncheck the checkbox at the bottom that says, \"Require my password when waking from suspend.\"\n\nA: I like to suspend my laptop sometimes, and other times I like to keep it going for long times like a server (do nothing when I close the lid).

I usually start a download before I go to school. \nWhich command should I use to automatically make the necessary saves and turn off the computer after a particular task has been completed? \n(Say, after installing the updates, or after downloading a large file.)\nI have also cross-posted this at unix.stackexchange.\n\nA: To do once to enable you to shut down the machine without a password:\nOpen a command line and type: \nsudo visudo \n\nIn the File that opens add the following line at the end:\nyourusername ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/halt\n\nThen exit the editor and safe it (Ctrl+X).\nNow you can shut down your computer from the command line, e.g. after you download something:\nwget UrlOfTheFileYouWantToDownload && sudo halt\n\n\nA: To shutdown after update you may use this python script: http://kotbcorp.blogspot.com/2009/06/shutdown-after-update-in-ubuntu.html\nTo shutdown after download i use this command:\nwget http://somehwere.com/path/to/some.file && halt\n\n\nA: Other answers are correct, but missing something:\nwget UrlOfTheFileYouWantToDownload ; sudo halt\n\nvs\nwget UrlOfTheFileYouWantToDownload && sudo halt\n\nThe second one will only shut down the computer if wget returns successfully.  The first one will run halt whether wget returns successfully or fails.\n\nA: you can use the download managers or torrent clients to shut down the pc after done or suppose you are defragmenting the disk you can click on shut down after done which is available in most softwares\n\nA: I guess it depends a lot on how you did your 'download'.\nIf you're talking about an apt-get update, upgrade sequence, as root you string your commands together using the && (the sequence only continues if there were no errors)\nsudo su -\napt-get update && apt-get upgrade && shutdown -h now\n\nIf you're talking about a download (e.g. using wget) [again, string the commands together using the && notation, ensuring that the commands execute in order only if the previous command was successful]\nsudo su -\nwget -t0 -c http://somedownloadsite/path/file.foo && shutdown -h now\n\nIf your download was done by a graphical client (gui), then it would depend on that client's mechanisms for executing scripts after a successful download.\n\nA: I know that this does not exactly answer your question but you can also make it time based i.e if you think that your download will complete in 2 hours you can simply issue command:\nshutdown -h +120\n\n\nA: Instead of changing the permissions on shutdown, you could do the following:\nsudo bash -c 'apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade; shutdown -h now'\n\nWhat this does is run a bash prompt as root that executes the items in the single quoted list and then quits.  The bonus of this method is that Ubuntu will forget your initial sudo authentication after some period (depending on the timeout period set - 15 minutes by default) and someone coming across your machine could only stop the current command, not run a new one.  Also, for everyone saying to use su, try:\nsudo -s\n\n\nA: I personally  found it was easier to use gedit to set up the original\nyourusername ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/halt    \n\nsince sudo visudo was confusing to me and did not show the last line clearly\nSo I used\nsudo -H gedit /etc/sudoers\n\nthen ended up with a clear (to me) page\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\nshantiq ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/halt\n\nJust thought I would mention that in case anyone else was a bit confused too\n\nA: I don't think you can do that...

I'm trying to install the Lexmark X1290 printer on a 64-bit Ubuntu 10.10 system. I previously had this printer working flawlessly on a 32-bit Ubuntu 10.04. \nI'm following the instructions from http://www.trodrigues.net/wiki/linux:ubuntu:lexmark_x1290 and using the  Z600 series driver from Lexmark.\nCreate a directory named lexmark and unpack the driver:\nmkdir lexmark\ntar -xvzf CJLZ600LE-CUPS-1.0-1.TAR.gz\n\nExtract the driver from the install script:\ntail -n +143 z600cups-1.0-1.gz.sh > install.tar.gz\n\nAnd untar it:\ntar -xvzf install.tar.gz\n\nThis generates 2 drivers (z600cups-1.0-1.i386.rpm and z600llpddk-2.0-1.i386.rpm) that then should be converted to .deb files with alien and installed with dpkg, but -as the filenames already indicate- the drivers are for 32-bit systems and not for 64-bit systems. Hence the error: \n$ sudo dpkg -i z600cups_1.0-2_i386.deb \ndpkg: error processing z600cups_1.0-2_i386.deb (--install):\n  package architecture (i386) does not match system (amd64)\n  Errors were encountered while processing: z600cups_1.0-2_i386.deb\n\nAny idea how I can get this to work?\n\nA: I'm not familiar with this driver, but you could force the installation by running:\nsudo dpkg --force-architecture -i z600cups_1.0-2_i386.deb\n\nIt might still not work, but it's worth a try.\n\nA: Here is additional information needed as of 2018 (that is, to install Lexmark X1290 printer on Ubuntu 18.04):\n\n\n*\n\n*The procedure fails at alien invocation on a 64-bit system:\n\nz600cups-1.0-1.i386.rpm is for architecture i386 ; the package cannot\n  be built on this system\n\nI could \"fool\" it by converting to .tgz format first, then to .deb:\nsudo alien -t z600cups-1.0-1.i386.rpm\nsudo alien -t z600llpddk-2.0-1.i386.rpm\nsudo alien z600cups-1.0.tgz\nsudo alien z600llpddk-2.0.tgz\n\nAfter which the installation worked:\nsudo dpkg -i z600cups_1.0-2_all.deb \nsudo dpkg -i z600llpddk_2.0-2_all.deb\n\n\n*The z600 backend and rastertoz600 filter need the 32-bit versions of specific libs.

This question is going to be little incomplete but I am sure you will guess what my problem is. So 2 days back When I restarted my machine I got 7 options on the Boot Screen instead of 5. Earlier Windows was the 5th Option (I made it default), but now some Memory test is the 5th option (Being Defaulted). How did it automatically happen? I didnt configure or changed anything.\n\nA: A new kernel was installed with an entry in the boot menu when you updated your system, this made the boot menu longer, and pushed the Windows boot menu entry further down. \nRead this: Is there a way to remove/hide old kernel versions?\n\nA: When the Linux kernel is updated, the older kernel images stick about in case the newer ones are incompatible with your system in some way. There are two parts to each kernel image - the normal one, which you boot up with, and the recovery image, which is why the menu increases by two entries with each update. The number of older kernels doesn't usually go beyond three (plus the respective recovery images, for a total of six images) so the size of your boot menu should be fixed from now on.\nYou can stop the older ones from appearing by editing your grub menu file, by typing\nsudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst\n\ninto a terminal and commenting them out with a # symbol in front of them (look around the file for examples). I assume you know how to do since you were able to set Windows as the default. You can also remove them to free up disk space if you're sure you won't need them.\nThe safest way, in my mind anyway, to do this is to install Ubuntu Tweak, which contains an option to remove redundant kernel images. It will display a list of the additional images and you just pick the ones you don't want, and the safety comes from the application not displaying the one that is currently loaded.\nIt's not advisable to get rid of all of them, either by hiding them or removing them, for two reasons. The first is that when you encounter a serious problem (usually related to hardware and usually when it's not working) the best course of action is to boot using a previous kernel image to see if the problem is resolved there. Updates to the kernel can have a nasty habit of breaking parts of one's system. The other reason is that the 'recovery' image in can be quite useful, especially if you forget your password.\n\nA: Just an advice: for security reasons (in case some update messes up your running kernel,etc.), i usually keep one more kernel image in my /boot folder (it has indeed proved helpful to me).\nAs for your follow-up q's:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, each time you install a new kernel, your menu.lst (since you're using grub v.1) will add the new image to your list.\nIf you want to clean up your list, you should either edit menu.lst manually or install ubuntu tweak as Chris already told you.\n\n*What do you mean by commenting out the image options? You can change the \"title\" to whatever name you want to be displayed in grub list, or your should comment out/delete all the unnecessary entries.\n", "Q: OpenCL programming on CPU and GPU with Nvidia cards? I have a bi Xeon machine with Ubuntu 10.10 and a Nvidia GTX 480 graphic card on it and I'd like to use OpenCL on the CPU and the GPU.\nI installed the latest Nvidia driver (nvidia-current) with apt-get and I downloaded and installed the latest CUDA Toolkit (3.2) from the Nvidia page.\nBUT this allows me only to run OpenCL code on the Nvidia GPU and NOT on the CPU.\nI then read some articles on the internet saying that the ATI SDK is able to run OpenCL code on the CPU.\nI installed the latest version of ATI drivers then tried to compile the SDK.\nI was then able to run code on the CPU but not on the GPU anymore.  \nIs there any way to run OpenCL code both on the Nvidia GPU and the Xeon CPU ?\n\nA: Both Nvidia CUDA and ATI Stream OpenCL implementation support the Khronos ICD extension, so when you call clGetPlatformIDs you'll get two different platforms, and therefore you can query for CPU/GPU devices on these platforms and of course the ATI platform will return the CPU device and Nvidia platform will return the GPU device.\nThen you can create CommandQueues on these devices and start your kernel. Of course this means that it's not trivial to share the task between GPU and CPU, but at least having a button in your app that switches from CPU to GPU would be quite easy to do.\n", "Q: How to remove wine completely How can I remove the wine folder and all the applications in that folder?\nI've tried via synaptic but it keeps showing up in the application menu.\n\nA: In 11.04 and below (GNOME Classic)\nWhen you install wine, it creates a \"wine\" menu in your applications menu, and this menu is partly user specific. To remove the menu entries, right click on your menu and click edit menus.\n\n\n\nNow open the menu editor and disable or remove the wine related entries. You can also remove the /home/username/.wine folder be either enabling hidden files in nautilus, or by opening a terminal and typing rm -rf ~/.wine.\n11.04 and up (Unity Desktop).\nYou need to open the menu editor from the Dash by press alt+f2 and type alacarte. Click on the icon, and the menu editor will come up.\n\nA: Single command :\nsudo apt-get remove --auto-remove winehq-stable \n\njust change \"winehq-stable\" according to your condition ( either winehq-devel or winehq-staging) if above doesn't work.\nnote: this is for them who used winehq\n\nA: If apt-get --purge autoremove wine does not do it, maybe your package goes otherwise, like wine1.6-dev. Try that that one.\n\nA: Using some menu editors can cause trouble, as it hides rather than\ndeletes the menu items - and they stay hidden if you reinstall the apps!\nSee http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ#uninstall_app for tips on how to\nuninstall wine and/or all wine apps.\n\nA: Go to software manager. You will still find wine related packages installed. Remove them. This really works to remove wine from the menu.\n\nA: First answer is the easy form to get this, but it's incomplete, the complete code is:\nIf you've installed wine from the official Ubuntu repositories:\nsudo apt-get remove wine --purge\n\nIf you've installed wine from their official PPA:\nsudo apt-get remove wine-1.3 --purge\n\nNext, clean the context menu, menu entries, etc:\nrm -rf $HOME/.wine\nrm -f $HOME/.config/menus/applications-merged/*wine*\nrm -rf $HOME/.local/share/applications/wine\nrm -f $HOME/.local/share/desktop-directories/*wine*\nrm -f $HOME/.local/share/icons/*wine*\n\nIt needs to reboot the system:\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: Run these to get rid of menu entries instead of (or in addition to) using \"Edit Menus\".\nrm $HOME/.config/menus/applications-merged/wine*\nrm -r $HOME/.local/share/applications/wine\nrm $HOME/.local/share/desktop-directories/wine*\n\n\nA: I tried more ways from here and others but didn't work\nso i did the following and it worked\nif you installed it from Winehq site you just need to do\n1- Press alt+Ctrl+t to open the terminal\n2- Type in it sudo apt-get remove winehq-devel\nNote: if it said that not found try other winehq type to remove what you have install as sudo apt-get remove winehq-stable Or sudo apt-get remove winehq-staging\n3- Type y mean yes to remove it, in the removing in will download some files and a new windows will appear just click tab from your keyboard to click on ok and then yes\n4- when it finish do sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get upgrade\n5- it will ask you to do sudo apt autoremove you are done now\nYou can reinstall it or do what you want to do now\nIf you installed it by Ubuntu software you can remove it by using it too\n\nA: In my case Wine did not get effectively uninstalled using the command:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove wine\n\nSo I did the following (make sure to copy the exact commands):\ncd $HOME\nrm -r .wine\nrm .config/menus/applications-merged/wine*\nrm -r .local/share/applications/wine\nrm .local/share/desktop-directories/wine*\nrm .local/share/icons/????_*.xpm\n\nThese commands delete files stored in hard disk that may lock uninstallation of wine. Quite possibly you will get some warnings about rm: remove write-protected regular file here. These can be enforced collectively by using the f option, i.e. rm -f and rm -rf instead of the above... but be the heck careful that you've actually typed the right paths!\nAfter deleting the files run command:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge wine\n\nDo the following to correct any installation error.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n\nA: I tried the sudo apt-get remove --purge wine .\nAfter this I had to give sudo apt-get autoremove\nIn my case it solved the problem. Also have a look at this to remove all the ms core fonts.\n\nA: I've had a similar problem but after doing\napt-get autoremove wine \n\nit worked\n", "Q: Why does my webcam (light) turn on when i start up my computer after standby? Hej\nWhen I close my lid on my Lenovo SL500 laptop with in-built webcam, my computer goes on standby. When I start up again the webcam light turns on - for no reason.\nI've found a way to make the light turn off again; starting cheese webcam (or probably any other webcam using program) then the light turns off for a second and goes back on, and the program shows camera video. When I close the program the light turns off as well.\nCan anybody tell me if my computer is actually turning on the webcam or just the light?\nand what can I do to solve this problem?\n\nA: It is a known bug, and I have the same problem.\nBug report (not mine): https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/566205\n\nMaybe try echo 'SUSPEND_MODULES=\"uvcvideo\"' | sudo tee /etc/pm/config.d/modules_unload?

I already set ENABLED=1, but the default update-rc.d config seems to be to put the haproxy in K20 (rc0|1|6.d) and in S20 (rc2|3|4|5.d).  Which means it will try to start before networking, so in my case I get this in boot.log:-\n\n * Starting haproxy haproxy                                                     [ALERT] 346/160552 (927) : Starting proxy haproxy: cannot bind socket\n[ALERT] 346/160552 (927) : Starting proxy haproxy: cannot bind socket\n[ALERT] 346/160552 (927) : Starting proxy haproxy: cannot bind socket\n[ALERT] 346/160552 (927) : Starting proxy haproxy: cannot bind socket\n[ALERT] 346/160552 (927) : Starting proxy haproxy: cannot bind socket\n[ALERT] 346/160552 (927) : Starting proxy haproxy: cannot bind socket\n[ALERT] 346/160552 (927) : Starting proxy haproxy: cannot bind socket\n                                                                         [fail]\n\nchanging the startup number to 35 seems to fix it, but I think 36 would be safer (the old number for networking was 35, so best make it start after that).

I tried all your commands without sudo, and they failed as you described. However, with sudo in front of them, using a default haproxy.cfg file from install, it is now running without problems. Just thought I'd point that even with the correct configs, for me it won't go without sudo. \n\nA: I ran into this same issue after first installing the ubuntu maintained package and then (after realizing the version did not support the feature i needed) Installing a ppa newer version of haproxy.  The init.d script that i wound up with pointed to /usr/sbin/haproxy when in fact my executable was in /usr/local/sbin/haproxy.  the debug output \"sh -xv /etc/init.d/haproxy start\"  mentioned earlier made this problem pretty obvious.\n\nA: I just encountered the same issue with the haproxy init.d script on lucid.\nI simply couldn't get haproxy to start, so I looked it up and found you had to change the ENABLED variable in the /etc/init.d/haproxy script. \nChanging this variable however did NOT help at all and this is why:\nA few lines lower in /etc/init.d/haproxy the ENABLED variable is checked by the script with the following line: test \"$ENABLED\" != \"0\" || exit 0. I noticed this test would ALWAYS fail on my system, no mather what the value of ENABLED. So the rest of the script is never run.\nI must admit I do not really know why this test line doesn't work properly. But since we want haproxy to be enabled anyway, why bother checking?... Commenting out this test line made it work for me.\nHope this helps anyone.\n\nA: I also kept staring at the scipt, couldn't see why it wasn't working despite the ENABLED=1 defined within the init-script.\nEventually, after looking down a bit, you'll see that the /etc/default/haproxy-file is sourced just before the test being performed, thus overwriting the set-variable in the init-script itself...\n\nA: Ran into the same problem on azure with a debian vm. Turns out to be quite simple.\nThe init script of haproxy uses run-time dependencies. On older system update-rc.d was the way to go, but on newer system insserv is used: https://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts/DependencyBasedBoot\nSo if you have used update-rc.d to add the haproxy service on newer systems, you should do:\n$ sudo update-rc.d -f haproxy remove\n$ sudo insserv haproxy\n", "Q: How to run applications using admin account while it is not in use or active?

I need a dead simple (read dumbies) guide to setting an Ubuntu 10.10 machine up as a router. \nHere's the scenario:\nI have several Ubuntu 10.10 VM's that run on the same virtual network. I want them all to use one of the VM's as a router. That machine will be the only one able to access real network resources and the internet. Problem is, I've never set a router up on a linux box. I'm sure it's very easy but I'd like to get the simple-mans guide if there is one. I'm sure it's out there somewhere. \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The easiest and simplest way is to turn on Internet-connection sharing in the machine you want to use as a router: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1183420&highlight=xbox+360+bridge\nFor that to work, your router machine would need 2 network interfaces - one connected to the Internet and one connected to the other machines.\nThen, the other machines would have to have their connections go through your router, which I'm not really sure how to do using VMs (ethernet cables IRL).  Presumably, your VM software could set up the networking to do that, but you might be able get by by manually setting the gateway in your VMs to be your router.\n\nA: you can also choose n-computing device to share network as well as system resources...\n\nA: Once of the best resources for ICS and firewall that I've come across is firestarter. Once you install it by typing sudo apt-get install firestarter, you can just run it from Applications > Internet. It requires almost no manual configuration for regular ICS, but also allows you to have fine-grained control over the firewall.\n", "Q: iPod Touch firmware downgrade Is it possible to downgrade my iPod touch firmware (from 4.2 to 4.0) from Ubuntu?\n\nA: I believe it's possible but it's hard.

Otherwise, no, you can't restore a iPod Touch firmware on Ubuntu. Sorry. \n\nA: Yes, its possible, but it involves a lot of work manually converting firmware images and messing with boot files.\nYou will also have to download a few tools that will allow you to read and write to the iPod's boot sectors.\nBasically, if it's at all possible use the iTunes method, unless you want to learn how stuff like firmware updates work (the hard way).\nApologies for the lack of supporting links, but this will involve plenty of Googling regardless....\nGood luck.\n\nA: You should check libimobiledevice.

If the combined horizontal resolution of both monitors is bigger than 2048 (quite easy with one at 1280xn and the other at 1024) they will not fit on a single texture and Compiz will refuse to work.\nBut if you put them horizontally they will fit, as usually vertical resolution is not greater than 1024.\n\nA: It is most likely a bug in the intel drivers, triggering a crash in compiz. You could install compiz-config and see if the screens option under \"general\" lists multiple outputs.\nIn any case, I would suggest reporting a bug on launchpad. (see this link).\n\nA: I have the same controller, running Debian based eeebuntu 4 and had same problem.

E.G. are buffers on the USB drive flushed as part of the suspend procedure?  Are there likely to be any other unfortunate side effects?\nSpecifically under Maverick \"10.10\" Meerkat, with an IDE (PATA) drive, but of course it would be useful to get info on a variety of setups.\nNote: by \"suspend\" I mean the S3, \"mem\" sleep state.  However, answers pertaining to hibernation (S4) would also be helpful.\n\nA: I have done this with my system using powertop, no side effects. In fact most usb devices are powered down during suspend by default, and since that is normal, shouldn't cause problems for you in this case.\nEDIT: in a simple sense, your drive will be fine on suspend. The problem will occur if you take it out and use it in another system. It also depends on the level sleep your system is doing (S1, 2, 3 etc).\nNB: As noted in the comment below, this will not be true if you remove the drive and use it before you resume.\n\nA: when you power down the system it automatically gets ejected. and inserting it during powerup doesn't cause any damage..\n", "Q: How do I add applications to the Messaging Menu?

You can also have one of these in your home directory with this path:\n~/.config/indicators/messages/applications/\n\nSo let's say that I want to add Thunderbird to my messaging menu.  I'd do something like this:\n$ mkdir -p ~/.config/indicators/messages/applications/\n$ echo /usr/share/applications/thunderbird.desktop > ~/.config/indicators/messages/applications/thunderbird\n\nYou'll need to restart your session (log out and back in) the first time you create the applications directory.\nHere's an example of usage from a python application.\n", "Q: Repercussions to sharing .bashrc across machines with Dropbox? I work on a lot of different machines, all running Ubuntu (not always the same version). I have some really basic customizations to my prompt I would like to have available on all machines. \nI currently use Dropbox and store all my other \"dot files\" there, such as my .vim/ .vimrc .gitconfig .ackrc. I then just link them to my home folder from my Dropbox folder. Voilà, all machines in sync.\nI am unsure what the repercussions of doing something like this with my bashrc is. Can any one offer suggestions? Maybe an easy way to load a separate file in the bashrc?\n\nA: The main risk that I can think of is that you must remember that synchronization is not the same as backing up. Any mistakes will be synced to all of your machines.\nTo include a separate file in your ~/.bashrc add something like so:\nif [ -f ~/.foo ]; then\n    . ~/.foo\nfi\n\nWhere ~/.foo is the separate file.\n\nA: Usually, centralizing configuration files is a good thing!  If you want to customize what runs based off of a given OS or hostname, you can do something like the following in your .bashrc:\nexport HOSTNAME=`hostname | cut -f1 -d'.'`\n\nif [ -f ~/.bash/os/$OSTYPE.sh ]; then\n    source ~/.bash/os/$OSTYPE.sh\nfi\n\nif [ -f ~/.bash/host/$HOSTNAME.sh ]; then\n    source ~/.bash/host/$HOSTNAME.sh\nfi\n\nThen, create a .bash directory and the os and host directories under that and put any custom settings in files called <whatever>.sh where <whatever> is the os type or the host you want customized.\nI keep all of these files in dropbox, and I have a bash script called link_dropbox in my Dropbox folder that helps me to facilitate linking them in:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#Array of <source><space><link> target->symlink mappings\nlinkarray=( \"~/Dropbox/config/bashrc ~/.bashrc\"\n            \"~/Dropbox/config/bash ~/.bash\"\n            \"~/Dropbox/config/vimrc ~/.vimrc\"\n            \"~/Dropbox/config/vim ~/.vim\"\n            \"~/Dropbox/config/ssh ~/.ssh\"\n            \"~/Dropbox/config/screenrc ~/.screenrc\"\n            \"~/Dropbox/bin ~/bin\" )\n\n#turn off globbing to split each entry on spaces\nset -f\nfor entry in \"${linkarray[@]}\"\ndo\n    targets=( $entry )\n    #eval will expand the tildes\n    eval from=${targets[0]}\n    eval to=${targets[1]}\n        #if the target exists and is not a symlink, err on the side of caution\n        if [ -e \"$to\" -a ! -L \"$to\" ]\n        then\n            echo \"$to exists and is not a link, skipping...\"\n        else\n            #probably safe to delete an existing symlink\n            if [ -e \"$to\" ]\n            then\n                rm $to\n            fi\n            ln -s $from $to\n        fi\ndone\n\n\nA: I don't see any real repercussions, but I suppose it depends on what you have in there! If it's just quick aliases that work the same everywhere, and cosmetic stuff, I don't see any issues. \nYou could either just move your .bashrc to someplace in your Dropbox folder and then symlink it on each of the machines.\n  mkdir -p ~/Dropbox/dotfiles\n  mv ~/.bashrc ~/Dropbox/dotfiles/.bashrc\n  ln -s ~/Dropbox/dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc\n\nI actually have quite a few dotfiles in my home folder which are actually symlinks to shared folders in my Dropbox account.\nAnother option is that you could create a file inside your dropbox folder to be sourced by your .bashrc:\nI.e., in your .bashrc, put:\nsource $HOME/Dropbox/dotfiles/bashrc-shared-settings\nand then create a bashrc-shared-settings file which is the stuff you want used on all machines, and you can still keep separate .bashrc files.\n(You can also abbreviate source as just . in bash.)\n\nA: I keep my .bashrc symlinked in Dropbox along with lots of other config files (.gitconfig, .vimrc, etc).\nI source a file called .bashrc_local at the end of it for other settings which I might want to keep machine independent.\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc_local ]; then\n    . ~/.bashrc_local\nfi\n\n\nA: Syncing with Dropbox is great, but if you don't want to install Dropbox on the server, you can implement my method. \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file with your shared bash settings in your Dropbox folder.\n\n*Right click the file and click \"Share Link\" from the Dropbox menu.\n\n*Then click \"Get Link.\" This will copy the shared link to your clipboard.\n\n*Add ?dl=1 to the end of the shared file. This lets you get the raw file.\nYour shared link should now look similar to mine: https://dl.dropbox.com/s/h25q5c3czo6mnjo/shared_bash_settings.sh?dl=1\n\n*Add this line to ~/.bashrc \nsource $HOME/.bash_shared_settings\n\n*Create a cronjob with your preferred interval using this command (Replace with your Dropbox Shared File!)\n*/30 * * * * curl -sS https://dl.dropbox.com/s/h25q5c3czo6mnjo/shared_bash_settings.sh?dl=1 > ~/.bash_shared_settings; chmod +x ~/.bash_shared_settings;\nThis will update your copy of ~/.bash_shared_settings every half an hour.

It aims to ensure that all of the Processes and their threads get a fair share of computing time. I won't go into scheduling too much (it's really complicated). But in the end there is something called a run queue. This is where all the instructions of all of the processes line up to wait for their turn to be executed.\nAny process puts it's \"tasks\" on the run queue, and once the processor's ready, it pops them off and executes them. When a program goes to sleep, for example, it removes itself from the run queue and returns to the \"end of the line\" once it's ready to run again.\nSorting on this queue has to do with the processes' Priority (also called \"nice value\" - i.e. a process is nice about system resources). \nThe length of the queue determines the Load of the system. A load of 2.5 for example means that there are 2.5 instructions for every instruction the CPU can deal with in real time.\nOn Linux, by the way, this load is calculated in 10ms intervals (by default). \nNow onto the Percentage values of CPU utilisation:\nImagine you have two clocks, one is called t and it represents real time. It measures a second for every second. The other clock we call c . It only runs if there is processing to do. That means, only when a process calculates something does the clock run. This is also called CPU time. Each and every process on the system 'has got' one of those.\nThe processor utilisation can now be calculated for a single process:\n\nor for all processes:\n\nOn a multi core machine, this may result in a value of 3.9 of course, because the CPU can calculate four seconds worth of computation every second, if utilised perfectly.\nWikipedia provides this example:\n\nA software application running in\n  6-CPU UNIX machine creates three UNIX\n  processes for fulfilling the user\n  requirement. Each of these three\n  processes create two threads. Work of\n  software application is evenly\n  distributed on 6 independent threads\n  of execution created for the\n  application. If no wait for resources\n  is involved, Total CPU time is\n  expected to be six times Elapsed real\n  time.\n\nHere's a small python snippet that does this\n>>> import time\n>>> t = time.time()\n>>> c = time.clock()\n>>> # the next line will take a while to compute\n>>> tuple(tuple(i**0.2 for i in range(600)) for i in range(6000))\n>>> print (time.clock() / (time.time() - t)) * 100, \"%\"\n66.9384021612 %\n\nIn a perfect world, you could infer from this that system load is 100 - 66.93 = 33,1%. (But in reality that'd be wrong because of complex things like I/O wait, scheduling inefficiencies and so on)\nIn contrast to load, these calculations will always result in a value between 0 and the number of processors, i.e. between 0 and 1 or 0 to 100%. There is now no way to differentiate between a machine that is running three tasks, utilising 100% cpu, and a machine running a million tasks, getting barely any work done on any single one of them, also at 100%. If you're, for instance, trying to balance a bunch of processes on many computers, cpu utilisation is next to useless. Load is what you want there.\nNow in reality, there is more than one of those processing time clocks. There's one for waiting on I/O for example. So you could also calculate I/O resource utilisation.\nThis may not have been helpful regarding the original question, but I hope it's interesting. :)\n", "Q: How to take screenshots of sections of the screen?

To do that simply do:\nsudo apt-get install xinput expect-dev\n\nThen you can run the script. Run it first with the -h option to see the possible configuration options. By default, the script will only work once and you have to restart the script after every screenshot (e.g. by a keyboard shortcut). This is because the script might have a performance inpact. If you want to run it as a \"daemon\" run it with the -d option. \nBy default it will also use shutter. If you want to use something else, use the -e option, e.g. script.sh -c \"ksnapshot\"\nBy default, the capture button will be Meta + R. you can change that with the configuration options.\n\nA: Since you were wondering if it was also possible with Shutter...\nTo do it in  Shutter, open it up and select Full Screen from either the toolbar or from File > New > Fullscreen.\nMake sure you have a time delay set so you have enough time to open the Applications menu (Edit > Preferences > Main tab; at the bottom, there is an selection box: Capture after a delay of __ seconds).\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Applications > Accessories > Take Screenshot > Grab the whole desktop > Grab after a delay of : 5 seconds (say)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Do your Applications menu selection.

It's possible to use the \"Screenshot\" tool and set \"Grab after a delay of x seconds\" to the time you need to get the menu back open.\n", "Q: How to sync files/data between two PCs on a home network? I have a desktop and a laptop with almost the same files within their home directory. Sometimes I make changes in ~/Music, ~/Documents, etc.  But these changes of course don't affect the other machine.\nSo I want to have a solution to sync all the data in the home folders of my laptop and desktop. I can connect them with cross cable once in a while.\nI don't want to use Ubuntu One or Dropbox (the files are big, and there's no need to use the Internet when both are on a home network).\n\nA: The best tool for this is the command line tool \"Rsync\".  If you need a GUI, try Unison or LuckyBackup, which are based around the concept of Rsync.  Unison and LuckyBackup are both in the repositories.\nAn example of rsync might be :\n\nrsync -vxtr /home/scaine/Pictures/\n  /home/OtherUser/Pictures/\n\n...which would synchronise my Pictures directory with OtherUser's Pictures directory.  The options I've specified will verify any copies, preserve timestamps/permissions during copy and will traverse subdirectories where found.  Do \"man rsync\" for more options.\nAs for connecting your PCs together - either put them on a switch/hub or use the crossover cable then share the directories via samba.\nEDIT :\nSome good points to make if the aim is to \"mirror\" the two PCs.\nThis command will only \"add\" files from source to destination.  If you need to delete, then you'll need the -delete option in there too.\nOn investigation, it appears that Rsync does not handle mirroring particularly well.  See this to realise that you will probably find older files overwriting younger files during this update!  Worse, even if you get the -update option to work and prevent this behaviour, it won't \"update\" the older with the younger file - it will just \"skip\" it.  Hardly ideal.\nFinally, to perform two way sync, you'll need to run the same command but reverse the source/dest.  Of course, this is of limited use now, since your first command (assuming you used that -delete option) will have deleted any file on the destination that didn't exist on the source.\nUnison handles the two-way sync quite well, from memory.\nIf you're seriously trying to keep multiple edits in sync, then a Dropbox solution is the best way forward.  If you can take another look at either UbuntuOne or Dropbox, symlinking might be a solution - only symlink your documents folder, say, while keeping Pictures and Music off One/Dropbox and using this rsync/unison solution for the big stuff?\n\nA: For a small set of files I'd suggest Dropbox or Ubuntu One, but it seems like you want to sync your music collection between computers, and neither of these are particularly suitable for that for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*They both synchronise to the internet, meaning that large collections of files will take a long time to down- and upload\n\n*They offer a limited amount of space (with the ability to purchase more), meaning that for a large collection of files you may end up having to fork out a lot of money\n\n\nUnison, which is what I use for local replication, has neither of these limitations (inherently). You can sync over your local network, meaning that it's fast (you can also sync over the internet if you wish), and can sync as much as you want — only limited by your available disc space and bandwidth. Unison has both a GUI and a terminal interface, meaning that you can use it on your desktop and server equally. There is a good guide on the Ubuntu wiki that you may wish to refer to if you choose to use Unison.\n\nA: A couple of gui based alternatives if you don't want to or like using the terminal\ngrsync as the name implies a basic gui to rsync.\nunison unison uses more alternate backends than grsync but other than that they do the same thing\nYou can install them from the Software Center or using apt-get\n\nA: Simple answer:\nrsync -vzu user@ip.address:/remote/dir/*  /local/dir\n\nThe -u option compares dates and only transfers if the target date is older than the source date.\n-v means verbose, -z means use compression.\n", "Q: Where can I find the kernel logs?

I have noticed that Shotwell has a pretty capable image viewer but EOG is still used for opening image files, which means Ubuntu's default install has two apps for the same purpose.\nI wonder why Shotwell isn't set as the default image viewer and EOG is removed. Are there certain features that EOG has and Shotwell lacks, which are keeping it from being set as default?\n\nA: I guess that Shotwell is more of a complete photo management application than a simple image viewer like EOG.\nThat's why the official statement from ubuntu talks about it as a replacement to F-Spot.  \n\nA: Note: I work for the Yorba Foundation and am the lead developer of Shotwell.  The following are my own opinions and observations.\nWhen Ubuntu first approached us about making Shotwell the default photo manager, we suggested to them that Shotwell not replace EoG as the individual photo viewer. At the time Shotwell's photo viewer lacked many significant features that EoG offered, including pan-and-zoom and a thumbnail strip view of all images in the current directory. EoG's metadata viewer (Image -> Properties) is also more thorough than Shotwell's.\nThat said, we're constantly looking to improve Shotwell and all these items I've mentioned are slated for inclusion at some point.  (Pan-and-zoom has been added since Ubuntu's decision.)  If Shotwell had a thumbnail strip view (or even a sidebar listing all files in a directory) I would feel comfortable recommending it as a default photo viewer – but that's a decision for the distro, not me.\n\nA: This does not exactly address your question, but you can change the default viewer.  \nIf you right click on the image, select \"Open With\", then \"Other Application...\", leaving 'Remember this application for \"JPEG Image\" files' checked, find 'Shotwell Photo Viewer' and click \"Open\" it will set Shotwell Photo Viewer as the default viewer.  \nI find Shotwell Photo Viewer faster to open than EOG--which can be removed using your favorite package management tool.\nAs far as the difference in features, I can not see a significant difference.  \n", "Q: converting .c module to .o module I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 and the installed kernel for driver programming.

I have a Dell Vostro 3700 version A10.\nThe relevant bits from lspci -v | grep VGA are:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 18)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation GT216 [GeForce GT 330M] (rev a2)\n\nSo as you can see this is one of those hybrid graphics laptops. Now, I have no interest in any kind of switching. I would like to completely disable the Intel Graphics thats on the processor.\nI checked in the xorg.log file and it shows that the intel card is in use.\nFrom lsmod I see it uses the i915 module. I tried blacklisting that module in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf but that didn't really work because i still couldn't use the nvidia card for display.\nI wish there was a BIOS option to disable, but there isn't. Some people have also suggested changing the SATA mode to compatibility, but that does not work either in this case as the intel vga controller still shows up in lspci\nI tried setting the busid manually in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file but it still didn't work. It gave me an error that said something along the lines of screen not detected. any bits of xorg.log that you'd like me to attach?\nSo what I am looking for is some solution that allows me to completely disable the use of the intel vga controller. if it was blocked somehow it'd be nice. as if it were not present. Any suggestions? I am desperate here actually. Because I cannot use the HDMI port right now on my laptop for that reason.\nMy guess is this applies to desktops that also have Core i5 processors with onchip graphics as well as dedicated graphics cards. How would they go about solving the problem?\n\nA: You can try vga_switcheroo. \ncd /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo\ncat switch #to see which card is active.

Is it possible to use Ubuntu One with Xfce/Xubuntu without installing too many GNOME dependencies like Nautilus?\n\nA: The Nautilus extension is provided by the package ubuntuone-client-gnome. So if you don't install that package, you shouldn't have to install Nautilus. I removed ubuntuone-client-gnome on my Ubuntu (gnome) system and Ubuntu One still works, there just isn't any integration with Nautilus, Rhythmbox etc.\n\nA: Additionally, if you use the new ubuntuone-control-panel-qt on Precise, you can use the --with-icon option to replace the launcher you don't have on XFCE/LXDE\n\nA: I've been able to find a workaround for the publishing function of the Ubuntu One client not available from the Thunar. I created a custom action for that. So, whenever I want to publish a file on the Internet, I move it to the Ubuntu one directory, right-click the file, and select the action. The command for the action is following: u1sdtool --publish-file=%f | awk '{print $5}' | xclip -i -selection \"clipboard\". u1sdtool publishes the selected file the path to which is taken from the variable %f and returns the message containing file's URL e. g.: \n\nFile is published at http://ubuntuone.com/SomeUniqueSequence. \n\nThe URL (being the fifth piece of the string) is picked by the awk '{print $5}' and placed in the clipboard by xclip -i -selection \"clipboard\" (you might have to install xclip first). Then it can be pasted by CTRL+V or the “Paste” command. Chipaca, thanks for telling about u1sdtool.\n\nA: In xubuntu 12.04 you can install ubuntuone-client and ubuntuone-control-panel-qt. Starting ubuntuone-control-panel-qt will then kick off the login and set up your synced folders and everything. Still no thunar integration, but the control panel has enough features that it makes using u1sdtool unnecessary.\nFor older versions, the previous answer below is probably still useful.\n\nYou don't need ubuntuone-client-gnome to use the file sync service of Ubuntu One on your desktop; you lose some integration, but you probably wouldn't appreciate that integration if you're on something other than GNOME anyway.\nu1sdtool (part of ubuntuone-client ) is a commandline program that talks to ubuntuone-syncdaemon over dbus, and allows you to do nearly everything you can do via the Nautilus plugin, and some things the Nautilus plugin doesn't know about yet. The only thing not implemented in u1sdtool is sharing a folder with somebody via email; the sharing functionality exported via u1sdtool is slightly arcane, and requires you to know the SSO username of the share receiver, and the share receiver to accept the share using u1sdtool; I'd recommend you use the sharing exposed via the web interface unless you're very confortable with the commandline. The functionality currently in the tool and not in Nautilus includes the ability of unsubscribing from (and resubscribing to) some of your synced folders.\nNobody has done the work to talk to the same dbus interfaces from Thunar (either directly or via libsyncdaemon), but it's certainly possible. Keep in mind that these interfaces sometimes change during development of an Ubuntu release, and while we try to notify other developers of upcoming changes, we make no promises. This communication issue has been the source of some significant frustration in the past, and we're working to address it, hopefully in time for 11.04.\n", "Q: How do I run a script/command on suspend? I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 and the gnome-do docky applet. For some reason every so often (sometimes after one, sometimes after several suspends) when I wake up from a suspend (I'm on a laptop, so every time I close the screen in-between my classes) gnome-do starts devouring the CPU. Trying to use the quit button on gnome-do doesn't work, I have to kill -1 the process.\nApparently it's been a problem for several people as there is at least one bug report. According to the bug report it's been fixed, but the release hasn't been pushed into the PPA. So my idea was to have the suspend script kill gnome-do automagically and then I'd just have to start it up again when I wake up (or set that in a wakeup script). Unfortunately my google-fu seems to fail me - I've found plenty of info about shutdown and logout, but nothing on suspend.\nAny pointers? Thanks!\n\nA: I believe you can put a shell script in /etc/pm/sleep.d/ which will be run on suspend/hibernate/resume/thaw. See the pm-suspend manpage for more information.\nI'd also recommend trying gnome-do from trunk (bzr branch lp:do) and seeing if this fixes it. If so, we can look at getting a targetted fix in as an SRU.\n\nA: You could kill -s STOP <pid> before and kill -s CONT <pid> after. This will suspend and then resume the process giving absolutely no CPU cycles while the computer is starting to go to sleep and when it's waking up. It's a bit of a stretch but maybe it will work.\nCombine it with Iain Lane's /etc/pm/sleep.d/ idea and you got a completely automated solution.\n\nA: Put a script in /etc/pm/sleep.d/. The file name should start with an ordering number, 00-49 for user scripts, and you can differ between suspend and wakeup by an argument that will be passed to the script (for more details on both, see man pm-suspend).\nWhen killing it, I suggest doing\n(killall -1 gnome-do; exit 0)\n\nin the script. Otherwise, if you try to suspend, and process gnome-do isn't running, the killall will exit with exit code 1, which will cancel the entire suspend. The above will run killall in a sub-shell that will exit with 0.\nIf you're having problems, check /var/log/pm-suspend.log that will log the attempt to run your script and possible problems.\n\nA: The key is to run docky process in background with & command. Otherwise some other problems occur.\nYou can find full solution this page:\nhttp://www.linux-compatible.com/tutorial/docky-closes-after-waking-suspend-ubuntu\n", "Q: ssh without opening the ports I usually provide solutions for my friends for fixing issues on their ubuntu machines. Most of them use shared internet connection over LAN where they cannot open ports for allowing me access their machines over ssh. Is it possible to ssh into a machine without opening ports. For example services like Teamviewer allow users to just accept a connection request from outside, and if the owner of the machine permits, then the machine can be used by authenticated users. So, similarly, if the owner of the machine permits, with some kind of authentication, one should be able to get ssh access to a machine without opening the ports on the NAT router.\n\nA: Perhaps this article about reverse SSH tunnel could be of some help to you:  \nhttp://www.marksanborn.net/howto/bypass-firewall-and-nat-with-reverse-ssh-tunnel/\n\nA: Any incoming connection by any means whatsoever will require opening a port.  There's just no other way to make a network connection.  If there is no existing port you can use, then you can't simply go that direction.\nBut you can go the other way.  If you have your friend open an ssh connection to your machine, and port forward the ssh port, then you can ssh back through his tunnel to his machine.  This gives you an ssh connection to his machine that will only survive as long as his ssh to you, (complete with port forwarding), remains.\nThis method also ducks firewalls.\n\nA: You can do this over Empathy's backend (telepathy) through another application called ssh-contact.\nI haven't used it personally, but it seems to me like a good way of getting two novices to SSH into each other.\n\nOf course another method would be to have them SSH to you (I assume you're competent enough to manage your port forwarding) and forward a port back to a ssh server on their machine.\nGet them to run:\nssh -R 48724:localhost:22 your_username@your_ip\n\nYou obviously might not want them logging in as your user so you could create another user and have that just for SSHing. There obviously has to be a modicum of trust between you and the other user.\nAnd then you run:\nssh -p 48724 their_username@localhost\n\nI'm using a high port so root privileges aren't required.\nOf course, they'll need openssh-server installed for you to connect but that's a simple sudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nA: You can use a tool called Ngrok. It's very easy to set up and configure.\nngrok is able to bypass NAT Mapping and firewall restrictions by creating a long-lived TCP tunnel from a randomly generated subdomain on ngrok.com (e.g. 3gf892ks.ngrok.com) to the local machine.\nAfter specifying the port that your web server listens on, the ngrok client program initiates a secure connection to the ngrok server and then anyone can make requests to your local server with the unique ngrok tunnel address. The ngrok developer's guide contains more detailed information on how it works.\nCheck out this Article - Remote access without port forwarding.\n\nA: With straight-up ssh this is not possible.  However, there is likely some other tool that would accomplish what you are trying to do.\n", "Q: Help me solve my problem with NPR Media Player First of, let me apologize for this getting a bit technical.  Several weeks ago, I found that while using NPR's media player (e.g. click on 'Listen to the Show' - this is what I've been using as a test) the stream would suddenly halt after a minute or three.  I could not get the stream to restart without reloading the page.  Now, I assumed this was an issue with NPR's player and Linux (or just a bug in their stuff in general) so I began to dig, the following is what I have tried to date (please note, the tldr; option is to skip to the latest thing as I think I know what is causing the problem).\nNote: All testing has been done, for consistency purposes, on a clean install of Chromium with no pluggins running.  My machine is Ubuntu 10.10x64.\n\n\n*\n\n*First thing I always try, I disabled all firewall stuff on the system (UFW, default deny all, allow ssh).  No change, firewall back up for all additional tests unless otherwise noted.  In any case, UFW is stateful, so connections it started on a non-specified on different ports will continue to work.\n\n*I deleted my ~/.macromeda and ~/.adobe folders, restarted (just to be sure) and tried.  Program still froze.\n\n*I decided the problem might be with my install of flash, so I purged the version I had (and the home folders again).  I installed the x64 version of flash from a PPA.  This had no effect.\n\n*I decided that the problem might be with the version of flash, so I purged the x64 version and installed the standard x32 version that comes with Ubuntu.  No luck.\n\n*Back to the x64 version for consistency, I decided to set up a 64-bit mini 'clone' of my system in VirtualBox.  I was able to run the media player with no problem.\n\n*I rsynced (in archive mode) my home directory from my real machine to the virtual machine (with bridged networking, so it was fully visible on the network).  I also used a few tricks to install ALL of the same software (and repositories) from the real machine to the virtual machine.  I was still able to listen to the player.\n\n*I decided that the problem was with my install (after all, it had gone through two major version upgrades).  As I have /home/ on a separate partition it was easy to reinstall and use the same trick from #6 to have my system up and running again within about an hour.  I continue to have issues with the NPR Media Player.\n\n*By this point the weekend had come.  At work, I use a wired connection while at home I use a wireless connection.  For some reason I forgot that I was having problems and used the NPR Media Player over the weekend.  Low and behold it worked just fine at home on wireless (note: for various reasons, I could not test this on wired at home).  \n\n*Following from #6, I decided that the problem was either something with the network at work or still something with my account.  As the latter was easier to test, I created a new account on my system and used that at work.  The Media Player worked.\n\n*At a loss, I decided to watch the traffic with tshark (the text based brother of wireshark) - X's to protect the innocent, I am the XXX.24.200.XXX:\n\n\nsudo tshark -i eth0 -p -t a -R \"ip.addr == XXX.24.200.XXX && ip.addr == XXX.166.98.XXX\"\n\nAs you would expect, there were tons and tons of packets, but each and every time the player froze, this is what I got\n\n08:42:20.679200 XXX.166.98.XXX -> XXX.24.200.XXX TCP macromedia-fcs > 56371 [PSH, ACK] Seq=817686 Ack=6 Win=65535 Len=1448 TSV=495713325 TSER=396467\n08:42:20.718602 XXX.24.200.XXX -> XXX.166.98.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindow] 56371 > macromedia-fcs [ACK] Seq=6 Ack=819134 Win=0 Len=0 TSV=396475 TSER=495713325\n08:42:21.050183 XXX.166.98.XXX -> XXX.24.200.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbe] macromedia-fcs > 56371 [ACK] Seq=819134 Ack=6 Win=65535 Len=1 TSV=495713362 TSER=396475\n08:42:21.050221 XXX.24.200.XXX -> XXX.166.98.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbeAck] [TCP ZeroWindow] 56371 > macromedia-fcs [ACK] Seq=6 Ack=819134 Win=0 Len=0 TSV=396508 TSER=495713362\n08:42:21.680548 XXX.166.98.XXX -> XXX.24.200.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbe] macromedia-fcs > 56371 [ACK] Seq=819134 Ack=6 Win=65535 Len=1 TSV=495713425 TSER=396508\n08:42:21.680605 XXX.24.200.XXX -> XXX.166.98.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbeAck] [TCP ZeroWindow] 56371 > macromedia-fcs [ACK] Seq=6 Ack=819134 Win=0 Len=0 TSV=396571 TSER=495713425\n08:42:22.910354 XXX.166.98.XXX -> XXX.24.200.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbe] macromedia-fcs > 56371 [ACK] Seq=819134 Ack=6 Win=65535 Len=1 TSV=495713548 TSER=396571\n08:42:22.910400 XXX.24.200.XXX -> XXX.166.98.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbeAck] [TCP ZeroWindow] 56371 > macromedia-fcs [ACK] Seq=6 Ack=819134 Win=0 Len=0 TSV=396694 TSER=495713548\n08:42:25.340458 XXX.166.98.XXX -> XXX.24.200.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbe] macromedia-fcs > 56371 [ACK] Seq=819134 Ack=6 Win=65535 Len=1 TSV=495713791 TSER=396694\n08:42:25.340517 XXX.24.200.XXX -> XXX.166.98.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbeAck] [TCP ZeroWindow] 56371 > macromedia-fcs [ACK] Seq=6 Ack=819134 Win=0 Len=0 TSV=396937 TSER=495713791\n08:42:30.170698 XXX.166.98.XXX -> XXX.24.200.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbe] macromedia-fcs > 56371 [ACK] Seq=819134 Ack=6 Win=65535 Len=1 TSV=495714274 TSER=396937\n08:42:30.170746 XXX.24.200.XXX -> XXX.166.98.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbeAck] [TCP ZeroWindow] 56371 > macromedia-fcs [ACK] Seq=6 Ack=819134 Win=0 Len=0 TSV=397420 TSER=495714274\n08:42:39.801738 XXX.166.98.XXX -> XXX.24.200.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbe] macromedia-fcs > 56371 [ACK] Seq=819134 Ack=6 Win=65535 Len=1 TSV=495715237 TSER=397420\n08:42:39.801784 XXX.24.200.XXX -> XXX.166.98.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbeAck] [TCP ZeroWindow] 56371 > macromedia-fcs [ACK] Seq=6 Ack=819134 Win=0 Len=0 TSV=398383 TSER=495715237\n08:42:59.032648 XXX.166.98.XXX -> XXX.24.200.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbe] macromedia-fcs > 56371 [ACK] Seq=819134 Ack=6 Win=65535 Len=1 TSV=495717160 TSER=398383\n08:42:59.032696 XXX.24.200.XXX -> XXX.166.98.XXX TCP [TCP ZeroWindowProbeAck] [TCP ZeroWindow] 56371 > macromedia-fcs [ACK] Seq=6 Ack=819134 Win=0 Len=0 TSV=400306 TSER=495717160\n08:43:00.267721 XXX.24.200.XXX -> XXX.166.98.XXX TCP 56371 > macromedia-fcs [FIN, ACK] Seq=6 Ack=819134 Win=0 Len=0 TSV=400430 TSER=495717160\n08:43:00.267827 XXX.24.200.XXX -> XXX.166.98.XXX TCP 56371 > macromedia-fcs [RST, ACK] Seq=7 Ack=819134 Win=65535 Len=0 TSV=400430 TSER=495717160\n\nSo, as you can see, my machine is sending out a ZeroWindow packet (which I think means some buffer or another filled up) which causes the Media Player to halt (unfortunately, terminally - no controls on it really do anything anymore).

This effectively tells the sender to stop sending because the receiver's buffer is full. Indicates a resource issue on the receiver, as the application is not retrieving data from the TCP buffer in a timely manner. \nSo my guess is that all this logging is just \"normal\" session (TCP) activity from a hanged application (flash plug-in).\nAs you already mentioned, the logs provided are found after the crash, so it shouldn't matter that much.  \nI guess that more important is to find some logs from your internet browser regarding the crash of the flash plug-in in the first place..\n", "Q: Where are the system-wide proxy server settings?

I would like to take a video I have and remove some parts of it, that is, produce a new video that is basically the same as the original but removing some parts.\nAvidemux seems to let you do this easily: just open the video, select a start and end frame, and hit save. This doesn't seem to be the case with Pitivi, though: \"save\" doesn't save a video, but a project; to save the video I have to hit \"render project\", and then I'm seemingly forced to re-encode the video because Pitivi just won't save the video \"as it was\".\nIs this indeed the way Pitivi works, or am I missing something here?\n\nA: PiTiVi is a Non-Linear video editor first and foremost, and so it doesn't have a \"copy\" mode. \nYou have probably noticed that Avidemux has several \"modes\" of work. Cutting/splitting videos without re-encoding can only be done in \"Copy\" mode.\nIt also means that no video filters can be applied.\nThe \"Copy\" mode works by copying the raw compressed video from the original file (container) into the new file (container). That's why you can't use video filters in this mode.\nYou might have noticed that this cutting doesn't actually work always with exact precision. Effectively, \"Copy\" mode can only split on keyframes, and that means that unless you chose a keyframe to split on, your resulting video will have a few more frames than what you intended.\nUsually too few to notice, but they are there anyway.\nHowever, with some specific codecs, Avidemux can do \"Smartcopy\" as explained here on the website\n\nIf your file uses MSMPEG-4 (DivX ;-) 3) or MPEG-4 video, you can use smart copy mode. Smart copy will leave most frames unchanged, but re-encode the part that lost its reference images with a fixed quantizer. So in our example, frames ab and nop would remain unchanged, while frames jkl would be re-encoded to use a different reference frame. Smart copy will ask you for a value for the quantizer to use – 4 or 5 is generally OK.\n\nSo you still get some video re-encoding, though minimal.\nPiTiVi is a Non-Linear video editor first and foremost, and so it doesn't have a \"copy\" mode, which would prevent any track-mixing and any video effects. Which I think is good, because people would turn it on, and you would get complaints that the video effects don't work :)\n\nA: You're right that this is the way PiTiVi works (alongside most other video editors).\nI agree this is frustrating, but with most video file formats (due to the compression methods used) it's not just as simple as slicing out specified parts of the file and saving those parts.\n\nA: There's just no way to edit a video without re-encoding it - at least not with any sort of coded you would use today. (There are probably some specialised editors (that is, for one codec only, maybe bundled or for use in vertical markets) to do this, but nothing you'll find useful)\nStill, if you, or anybody else, are interested in a nice video editor that makes this task quite easy, i'll mention Openshot  for completeness' sake\n\nJust drag the file from your video CD into OpenShot; It should convert everything automatically. I don't have a Video CD to test it, but since the Video CD standard mandates it use MPEG-1, I'm quite confident it'll work just fine.\n\nYou'll use the Razor tool (3) to split your video into multiple clips, delete the unwanted ones and move them around as you like.\n\nA: In Avidemux, I was able to cut a short MP-4 film without messing of any sort using the following settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Video select MPEG-4 ASP (avcodec).\n\n*Audio select MP3 (lame).\n\n", "Q: Download speed decreased I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 and i like it.

When i deactivate Wifi connections via network-manager-applet and reactivate it, it again has the full speed. \n\nA: I have found that wireless is always slower than the wire for one thing. Another factor is other computers using the wireless connection at the same time. Wireless routers have trouble supporting more than a few concurrent connections at the same time. The first thing I would do is log into the router and look at the DHCP clients to see who is connected. You may unwittingly be giving free internet to a neighbor.\n\nA: How does your Wifi connection strength indication look when you have the problem?\nIt could be the computer is in an unfavourable spot, and the wifi signal isn't good enough, in which case, the wifi driver will throttle your connection down to, perhaps, 1mbit/s to decrease the rate of errors.\nTry moving all of the devices a bit, the connection indicator will take a fair few seconds to catch up. Also, have a look at the connection speed: Mine is Speed: 36 Mb/s at the moment (not the full 54, because the connection isn't that good). So see this,\n\n\n*\n\n*right click on the wifi indicator and select  Connection Information.\n\n\nIt should be between ~20 and 54 (perhaps more) Mb/s.

This thing is one of the be-all-end-all solutions to people wanting to access their multimedia files around their house, but it runs Windows Home Server. Is there any similar device out there running Ubuntu Server, some variation on Ubuntu, or a version of Linux at the very least?\nThe whole idea behind the Windows based media centres that are out there is that you spend as little time as possible configuring them (in theory, if you have a Windows home, they should just work). An Ubuntu (Linux) based alternative should have the same sort of 'take it out of the box and start playing' setup.\nWhat are my options?\n\nA: Assuming you are talking about a piece of hardware you can buy, I'm afraid there is nothing out there (to my knowledge).\nThe Boxee Box does run on top of a Linux operating system, but I don't think that meets your needs. (And the underlying Linux isn't easy to get to/obvious it's there, in the same way Windows Home Server is on the system you linked to.) \nHowever there are a number of 'Media Centre' software packages that run on top of Linux and Ubuntu that you can manually install: examples include MythTV (see also Mythbuntu), Moovida and LinuxMCE. Again though, I'm not sure if any of these directly meet your needs.\n\nA: In this kind of installation, you need, at least, 2 things : \n\n\n*\n\n*A media server ==> your question\n\n*A player (at least one but you can have one for music, one for videos on your tv, ...)\n\n\nCommunication protocol between server and client is important and there is an open standard called UPnP that does a good job and works with a lot of different clients. There are other (ie Airplay system in the Apple world) that i do not know.\nUPnP Server can stream Videos, Pictures or Audio\nSo if you run an UPnP media server, you'll be able to : \n\n\n*\n\n*stream all multimedia content from your desktop, laptop, netbook ... running windows or linux\n\n*stream all your multimedia content from smartphones (iPhone, iPad, Android at least)\n\n*stream all your multimedia content from video game console (PS3 and XBOX360)\n\n*Stream your audio and video from compatible TV BOX (Boxee Box in last version, WD HDTV Box, ...)\n\n*Stream you music on compatible Hi-Fi system\n\n*Manage what is playing on what client with your iPod or iPad using PlugPlayer\nMost of recent NAS Systems offer UPnP server feature (and others like download station, backup, ...), mine is a Synology and is based on Linux. I can connect to it using telnet or ssh, it's not ubuntu but its a Linux.\n\nMy NAS contain all my files and I can access them from everywhere (my home network and even from Internet) using any compatible device.\nHope this help.\n\nA: My solution doesn't run Ubuntu, and I'm not sure if there is any off-the-shelf solution that does, but it is open-source.\nIn my mind, the best solution would be to combine the Boxee Box with a separate storage solution (Some sort of NAS device, such as this. The Boxee Box doesn't contain any internal storage media, so you have to supply your own. It does however support the playing of pretty much any media format under the sun, so there's no need to spend hours, or even days, converting large numbers of video files.\nThe other great thing about the Boxee Box is that it provides a TV oriented interface for accessing media sources in the cloud, through a wide range of native apps. It also comes with a remote that on one side has a couple of navigation buttons, but when you flip it over you end up with a full qwerty keyboard for typing.\n\nA: The DLink DNS-323 is linux and has MediaTomb as a media server but the 500mhz processor on the device is a little too weak to really handle a drive full of files that is larger than about 250mb. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Samba Server Problems I'm currently setting up a samba server on an old school computer for my photo class but I tried to setup samba and it didn't allow me to install the necessary things to get samba rioting.

Is there a Ubuntu alternative for this program?\n\nA: For an updated answer, here is an article from March 2018: Best Free Linux Speech Recognition Tools – Open Source Software.\n\nThis article highlights the best open source speech recognition\nsoftware for Linux. Note, some of the software is in an early state of\ndevelopment, and is therefore not ready for widespread adoption.\nBefore examining our recommendations, Jasper is worthy of a special\nmention. It’s an excellent open source platform for developing\nalways-on, voice-controlled applications. You may be wondering why HTK\ndoesn’t appear below. For sure, HTK is a popular speech recognition\ntoolkit. But HTK is not eligible to feature in the recommended\nsolutions. Not because it’s copyright is owned by Microsoft, but\nsimply because it’s proprietary software.\nLet’s explore the 6 free speech recognition tools at hand. For each\ntitle we have compiled its own portal page with a full description and\nan in-depth analysis of its features.\n\nOpen Source Speech Recognition Tools\n\n*\n\n*Mozilla DeepSpeech: TensorFlow implementation of Baidu's DeepSpeech architecture (website/source).\n\n*Kaldi: C++ toolkit designed for speech recognition researchers (website/source).\n\n*CMUSphinx: Speech recognition system for mobile and server applications (website/source).\n\n*deepspeech.pytorch: Implementation of DeepSpeech2 using Baidu Warp-CTC (website/source).\n\n*Julius: Two-pass large vocabulary continuous speech recognition engine (website/source).\n\n*Simon: Flexible speech recognition software.\n\n\nA: You can install Chromium 11 version from the ppa ppa:chromium-daily/stable (How to add an PPA) and add --enable-speech-input  to the end of the launcher.\n\nNow visit this website and whoo! Speech-to-Text on ubuntu using html5.\nI read here that if you speak slowly it will be more accurate.\n\n\nA: freespeech-vr\nIs a decent open source speech to text engine. Here the source code (on Google Code)\nNote that it takes a bit of configuration, which is less polished than Dragon Naturally Speaking's configuration.\n\nA: Dictanote\nTo expand on Alaukik's answer, there are apps built on top of Chrome speech recognition capabilities. \nI personally use Dictanote (it is very similar to Dragon). Here is a link to chrome app.\n\nA: There is a whole  Article on Wikipedia dedicated to the Problem.\nUnfortunately, it seems there's currently no one solution that works well enough, but a massive list of projects that are underway.\nYou may want to rummage through the list of solutions to see if there's anything that fits your needs.\nPlatypus:\nThere's always the possibility to run Dragon Naturally Speaking using WINE. The Platypus Project is creating software to redirect Dragon's output to any Linux / X application, and they are very far along. \n\nYou should definitely take a look at this.\n\nA: Try Mozilla DeepSpeech an opensource tool for automatic transcription. But you will need to train the tool or download Mozilla's pre-trained model. For very clear recordings, the accuracy rate is relatively good. but for my projects, it was still not sufficient, as the recordings had lots of background noises, they were not of good quality, I used Transcribear instead, it's web based editor that allows for automatic transcription, but you will need to be connected online to upload recordings to the Transcribear server.\n\nA: If you are Google-tolerant, there's Google Voice typing in Google Docs in Chrome. Open a blank Google doc, do Tools->Voice Typing, click the mic and talk away. In 2020 it seems to be better than the last time I tried it circa 2018, seems about the same error rate as Dragon based on a quick one-paragraph test. Less customization unfortunately, can't teach it custom pronunciations of words it doesn't know. Here's the docs. There is also the \"Voice in Voice Typing\" Chrome plugin to make speech-to-text available in all web input boxes.\n", "Q: Blurry printed raster images with Brother MFC-8840D (NOTE: crossposted here: ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1621795)\nI've got a Brother MFC-8840D.

For example, I can scan a page of black and white text at 150 or 300 dpi. The grayscale image looks perfect on my monitor. But the printed version is much blurrier than the original, regardless of the \"print resolution\" dpi I choose.\nAs a counterexample, if I use the \"copy\" function of the MFC-8840D, the copy looks excellent, and this function is much, much faster than if I scan then print a scan of same.\nI've googled around a bunch and tried different tricks (printing a PDF with the image from evince, printing with Gimp, EOG and other applications) but I just can't print anything that looks as good as a copy made with the MFC-8840D.\nAny ideas?\nI'm using Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS server.

Unity is supposed to be able to do a desktop spread (similar to pressing Super+W, where you get a view of all windows in the current workspace) and a workspace spread (similar to Super+E, where you see all the workspaces).\nRight now it's easy to perform a workspace spread because it's mapped to the workspace switcher, but desktop spread is supposed to become very relevant in Unity at some point, so how will the user access it?

It is like gnome-session-quit. \n\nA: lubuntu 12.10 LXDE running on a Samsung netbook (CPU: 1.66 GHZ Intel Atom; RAM: 2GB)\nThe below two commands logged me out immediately:\nsudo pkill -u username\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\n\nA: I tried gnome-session-quit --force and it works!\nNote: I use ubuntu 15.04\n\nA: In case you don't want to kill your session, you can go back to the login screen using:\ndm-tool switch-to-greeter\n\nIf you select your user and enter your password, the session will be resumed, so it's not a full logout.\n\nA: 11.10 and above\nHere's my personal solution!\nIn the terminal, run:\ngedit ~/.bash_aliases\n\nAnd add:\nalias log-out=\"gnome-session-quit\"\n\nto the file! Now you just have to run log-out!\n\nA: 11.10 and above\ngnome-session-quit\n\n11.04 and previous versions\ndbus-send --session --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.gnome.SessionManager /org/gnome/SessionManager org.gnome.SessionManager.Logout uint32:1\n\n(via DoR, see his answer to \"Reboot without sudoer privileges?\" for more dbus goodness!)\nor alternatively, you can use\ngnome-session-save --force-logout\n\n--force-logout in contrast to just --logout will not ask the user to deal with unsaved documents and so on.\n\nis this the easiest way? no simple one\n  line command like sudo logout?? I will\n  never remember all that.\n\nYes, there is a command called logout, but it concerns the Terminal. gnome-session-save is the program that actually quits the gnome-session, which you can of course kill, but that wouldn't qualify as logging out. :-)\nNotice as well that these commands don't require you to be root.\nYou can always add an alias to your system if you want to have a shorter command.\nOpen ~/.bash_aliases with a text editor, or create it if it isn't there, and add something like this to it:\nalias logout-gnome=\"gnome-session-save --force-logout\"\n\n(.bashrc is a script that is run every time a new virtual terminal is started up, you should set up all your permanent aliases there, see also: How to create a permanent \"alias\"?)\n\nA: Define a function by adding the following line to your .bashrc, then invoke by typing logoff at the shell prompt.\n  logoff() { gnome-session-quit --logout --no-prompt ; } # Log Out\n\n\nA: Looks like gnome-session-save was renamed to gnome-session-quit for 11.10. Everything else in the main answer should still work with that single change.\nhttp://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2011-February/msg00147.html\n\nA: For gnome sessions, gnome-session-quit works well.  By default it asks for confirmation and then logs you out (i.e., the --logout argument is assumed unless overridden with --power-off explicitly).   You can also tell the command to not prompt for confirmation on logout:\n--no-prompt\n      End the session without user interaction. This only works with --logout.\n\ngnome-session-quit is still valid in 12.04. \nSince the OP didn't specify the window/desktop manager, and the gnome-session-quit might not work with all possibilities, here's a generic X-windows way to return to the login screen or chooser which I've used several times over the last several releases:\nFrom a terminal (invoked with, variously, 'Alt-F2 + xterm, or Ctrl-T, or Crt-Alt-F1, or by right-clicking on the desktop in Nautilus and using the \"open in terminal\" shortcut, etc.) type\nsudo pkill X \nThis is generally overkill for most situations.   I tend to use it when I've got a hung process or when I've got to log out quickly.  When I've done this, Ubuntu has politely returned me to the login screen by re-spawning X-windows. \nI've not yet used the power-off feature of the gnome-session-quit, as I typically use shutdown -P now for that purpose.\n\nA: I had installed mate desktop and none of the menus worked, even the f-keys didn't work.\nI managed to get xterm through browsing with file manager.\nThe only thing that worked was :\nsudo pkill -u username\n\n\nA: On Xubuntu (or whenever using an Xfce session), you can logout via the terminal by using \nxfce4-session-logout --logout\n\nYou must specify --logout or the logout confirmation screen will be displayed. This will work whether you have specified 'Xubuntu session' or 'Xfce session' when you logged in with Lightdm, as the session is still managed by the Xfce session manager.\nIn addition, another option will log you out as well: \nxfce4-session-logout --fast  \n\nIf this command is issued the session is not saved, so it is normally best to use xfce4-session-logout --logout. \nThe ability to logout using the terminal will be very useful to you, as will the other options such as suspend that are available with xfce4-session-logout.\nFor more information, see man xfce4-session-logout or the Ubuntu manpages online.\n\nA: And in kubuntu 12.04+ it is:\nqdbus org.kde.ksmserver /KSMServer org.kde.KSMServerInterface.logout 0 0 0\n\n\nA: There is a way which will work whether you are running X or you are in a TTY. There you go:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use lightdm\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\n\n*if you use gdm or in Ubuntu GNOME\nsudo service gdm restart\n\n\n*If you use kdm or in Kubuntu\nsudo service kdm restart\n\nThe downside of this command is that it will ask for your password.\n\nA: I found this accidentally.\nluvpreet@DHARI-Inspiron-3542:~/go/bin$ who -uH\nNAME     LINE         TIME             IDLE          PID COMMENT\nluvpreet tty7         2017-12-27 17:33  old        27458 (:0)\n\nHere you get the process id of your current session.\nSo, easy.

And what are the steps to achieve this?\n\nA: Yes you can! \nSimply go to your /opt/google/chrome folder\nReplace the file \"libflashplayer.so\" (I recommend doing a backup of that file) and your done. \nI would recommend doing the same for the /usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/ folder. \nBy the way, this combined with the 200 line kernel patch makes flash SUPER FAST even on my crappy computer! \n\nA: Most browsers, including Chrome, can detect plugins from the ~/.mozilla/plugins folder. So you can download the flash player from Adobe and extract it there. After that, restart Chrome, type about:plugins in the address bar, then click the \"details\" button on the right to display plugin info. Scroll to Shockwave Flash and disable the versions you don't want to use.\nAlthough Chrome lists as many flash plugins it can detect, it will use only one. The default selected plugin should be the one shipped with Chrome, so in order to use a different plugin is recommended that you disable all instances, except the one you want to use.\nDownload for 32bit: http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/flashplayer10...\nDownload for 64bit: http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/flashplayer10...\nI don't know for how long they will keep the 64bit link alive, since they recently removed the 64bit version download page.\nIf you are on 64bit and still has Firefox installed, you can get the 64bit preview version with my Flash-Aid extension for Firefox, which also removes conflicting plugins.

The proxy is used to share the internet connection with a small group of PC's (3 machines) over ad-hoc wi-fi. Another reason for using squid cache is to bring down data usage, as my internet connection come with a usage limit of 2 Gbits per month. I found that squid3 is little heavier for my netbook, as the processor fan will be always active whenever squid is being used. I have plans to go for Polipo, as it is lighweight, and better performance results according to this test. But in the documentation for Polipo, there is no information about HTTPS support, and I always access sites which use HTTPS on my LAN Pc's. So, would Polipo be a better solution for my requirements? Efficient data caching is my first priority, and cached data shouldn't get deleted during reboots. \n\nA: Performance differences between both for such a small setup are probably not noticeable.\nHowever, traffic over HTTPS is NOT cached by squid3 anyway, as far as I know. So if you use the proxy to save bandwidth, all HTTPS traffic will not be cached, so you are not saving anything.\nIn any case, Polipo is more lightweight, so give it a go. It's also much easier to configure.\nSquid is much more powerful, and more oriented to \"enterprise\" environments. I manage a Squid server for the school where I work, and Polipo just isn't an option.\n", "Q: Recovering Files from a Corrupt CD/DVD I have certain old CD/DVD's which are not in good condition. I want to recover from them anything that can be recovered. in windows you had software like Isobuster and Cd Recovery which will let me do this. Can anyone suggest a native linux app?\n\nA: The other answers concentrate on software; I'll add another \"layer\" to this.  \nThe fact that the disc (CD or DVD) is physically damaged is likely to impose a limitation on the possible results of the software approach.  \nI still do recommend to try them FIRST as what follows below might destroy your data entirely if you're too rough with it.  \nA process to reduce scratches; what tools, chemicals and gadgets to use:  \nInitial advice: read through and practice first, then do the real thing. \n\n\n*\n\n*Wettex wiping sponge cloth or similar. Make it be damp, then place it on top of a steady surface\n\n*Place your disc with the recording surface up on top of 1.\n\n*Find any type of Rubbing compound and place fairly large drops of it on top of the disc surface\n\n*Use any combination of tools to work on surface similar to how \"Buffing\" is done on car paint.\n\n\nTake it in easy steps, clean the disc after some work and try to read it - eventually, using easy steps of the above, you will get more data out than initially.\nNOTE: This will not work for discs that has cracks through the optical layers or in the recording substrate. There is no magic in this. You are making the top surface more even, removing scratches as you go.\nTried out in practice on DVD+R discs\n\nA: For Ubuntu, try dvdisaster for data cd's and dvd's. Really good if you like graphical tools. It's tricky to use with commercial movie dvd's, though. You'll have to open the dvd in Totem once first to \"authenticate\" the drive. After that, it works well.\nYou also have ddrescue for the terminal.\nI have used both, and they are good.\nOnce you have the file on your hard drive you can try \"uncompressing\" it, or mounting it. If it's too damaged, I resort to foremost or testdisk to get all possible files out of the dumped image of the disk.\nHere is a quick link:\nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/recover-deleted-files-with-foremostscalpel-in-ubuntu.html\nNot sure about music cd's, though.

I burnt the live CD but can't reboot from CD ROM.\nI tried to choose it from the BIOS menu (by pressing F12) and also tried changing the boot order (no floppy).\nIs there a way to extend the Ubuntu partition without using Ubuntu Live CDROM?\n\nA: use easus partition master (or any other that you prefer) on windows to resize the partition of ubuntu...\n\nA: if you have a flash drive then you can create USB Startup disk and then boot Ubuntu using that flash drive. From there you can run gparted or any thing else that you want. Also as you booted Ubuntu from Flash and not from harddisk, you can easily edit any of your partitions\n\nA: Use tuxboot or unetbootin to create a bootable usb of gparted live. just use any Ubuntu  live CD installer and boot into it  and select \"Try Ubuntu\" option. \nNow use gparted partition editor to extend the Ubuntu partition on your system,the thing is that for any operation like extending, creating, moving etc, have to be performed when the volume is offline i.e The volume or partition can't be mounted, so when you're using Ubuntu on your system its not possible to do this because your system partition is mounted in /.\nAnd Easeus partition manager would not do any fancy operation on Ubuntu partitions (such as ext3,ext4).\n", "Q: How to track the total network data in a month I can see the data transferred (internet Download/Upload) in the current session from the System Monitor.

It uses the network interface statistics provided by the kernel as information source. This means that vnStat won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also ensures light use of system resources.\nIn this tutorial we'll review:\n\n*\n\n*Features\n\n*Installation\n\n*Configuration\n\n*Start Systemd Service\n\n*Usage (from command line)\n\n*Conky example\n\n#Features\n\n*\n\n*quick and simple to install and get running\n\n*gathered statistics persists through system reboots\n\n*can monitor multiple interfaces at the same time\n\n*several output options\n\n*summary, hourly, daily, monthly, weekly, top 10 days\n\n*optional png image output (using libgd)\n\n*months can be configured to follow billing period\n\n*light, minimal resource usage\n\n*same low cpu usage regardless of traffic\n\n*can be used without root permissions\n\n*online color configuration editor\n\n#Installation\nnvStat is in the official repositories so no need to link to a new ppa. To install create a Terminal instance using Ctrl+Alt+T and type at the prompt:\nsudo apt-get install vnstat\n\nAfter installation, keep your Terminal open for the following sections. There is no need to reboot.\n#Configuration\nPick a preferred network interface and edit the Interface variable in the  /etc/vnstat.conf accordingly. To the list all interfaces available to vnstat, use:\nvnstat --iflist\n\nTo start monitoring a particular interface you must initialize a database first. Each interface needs its own database. The command to initialize one for the eth0 interface is:\nsudo vnstat -u -i eth0 \n\n#Start Systemd Service\nAfter introducing the interface(s) and checking the config file. You can start the monitoring process via systemd:\nsudo systemctl start vnstat.service\n\nTo make this service permanent use:\nsudo systemctl enable vnstat.service\n\nFrom now on vnstat will be gathering network usage in the background using such a small percentage of CPU it doesn't show up on conky's (system monitor's) top 9 list of processes (on my machine).\n#Usage (from Command Line)\nQuery the network traffic:\nvnstat -q\n\nViewing live network traffic usage:\nvnstat -l\n\nTo find more options, use:\nvnstat --help\n\n#Monthly Totals\nTo see monthly totals, use:\nrick@dell:~$ vnstat -m\n\n eth0  /  monthly\n\n       month        rx      |     tx      |    total    |   avg. rate\n    ------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------\n      Nov '16     76.31 MiB |    2.03 MiB |   78.35 MiB |   10.45 kbit/s\n    ------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------\n    estimated      3.13 GiB |      84 MiB |    3.21 GiB |\n\n#Conky example\nConky is a popular light-weight System Monitor used across many Linux distributions. You can vnStat bandwidth totals to your conky display like this:\n\nNote when picture was taken Yesterday was Sunday which explains why the Weekly total is less.\nThe conky code to achieve this is:\n${color orange}${voffset 2}${hr 1}\n${color1}Network using vnStat \"-i\", \"-w\" and \"-m\"\n${color}${goto 5}Today ${goto 100}Yesterday ${goto 225}Week ${goto 325}Month ${color green}\n${execi 300 vnstat -i eth0 | grep \"today\" | awk '{print $8\" \"substr ($9, 1, 1)}'} ${goto 110}${execi 300 vnstat -i eth0 | grep \"yesterday\" | awk '{print $8\" \"substr ($9, 1, 1)}'} ${goto 220}${execi 300 vnstat -i eth0 -w | grep \"current week\" | awk '{print $9\" \"substr ($10, 1, 1)}'} ${goto 315}${execi 300 vnstat -i eth0 -m | grep \"`date +\"%b '%y\"`\" | awk '{print $9\" \"substr ($10, 1, 1)}'}\n${color orange}${voffset 2}${hr 1}\n\nTo save space on my narrow window I used \"G\" instead of \"GiB\", \"M\" instead of \"MiB\", etc. If you have more screen realestate change substr ($10, 1, 1) to $10 and the same for $9.\nYou may have to change eth0 to wlan0 or eth1, etc. depending on your network name reported by ifconfig.\n", "Q: Unison shows error about locked archives I have installed Unison to sync data between my two PCs but I am getting an error about a non existing file.

Just like with command-line sudo.\nThe gksudo may not be available in your system then install it with sudo apt-get install gksu.\n\nA: One simple way to make the script only runnable by root is to start the script with the line:\n#!/bin/su root\n\nA: A root user does not have to be named \"root\". whoami returns the first username with user ID 0. $USER contains the name of the logged in user, which can have user ID 0, but have a different name.\nThe only reliable program to check whether the account is logged in as root, or not:\nid -u\n\nI use -u for the effective user ID, not -r for the real user ID. Permissions are determined by the effective user ID, not the real one.\nTests\n/etc/passwd contains the following usernames with user ID 0 in the given order:\nrootx\nroot2\n\nLogged in as root2, gives the next results:\n\n\n*\n\n*whoami: rootx\n\n*echo $USER: root2 (this returns an empty string if the program was started in an empty environment, e.g. env -i sh -c 'echo $USER')\n\n*id -u: 0\nAs you can see, the other programs failed in this check, only id -u passed.\n\n\nThe updated script would looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nif ! [ $(id -u) = 0 ]; then\n   echo \"I am not root!\"\n   exit 1\nfi\n\n\nA: Taking efficiency into consideration, you may test, first, the EUID environment variable and then, if it doesn't exist, call the standard id command:\nif ((${EUID:-0} || \"$(id -u)\")); then\n  echo You are not root.\nelse\n  echo Hello, root.\nfi\n\nThis way, because of the OR shortcut, you avoid calling a system command, prioritizing the query of an in-memory variable.\nCode reuse:\nfunction amIRoot() {\n  ! ((${EUID:-0} || \"$(id -u)\"))\n}\n\n\nA: #!/bin/bash\n[[ $(id -u) != 0 ]] \necho $?\n\n\nA: This code works under both Bash and stock Bourne sh (tested under FreeBSD) that does not define EUID. If EUID exists its value is returned, else the 'id' command is run. It is a tad shorter than the \"or\" example above, as it uses a shell built-in \":-\".\nRoot in sh:\n# echo $EUID\n\n# euid=${EUID:-`id -u`}\n# echo $euid\n0\n\nIn bash:\n[chaapala@tenfwd2 ese]$ euid=${EUID:-`id -u`}\n[chaapala@tenfwd2 ese]$ echo $euid\n10260\n\n", "Q: Where can I download the latest version of the Ambiance theme?

I'm running the most recent version of Audacity, 1.3.12.\nI'd like to install a second version (1.2.6) because there's a filter I'd like access to that only exists in that version. (As I'm only installing it for this reason, my 1.3.12 install needs to stay untouched.)\nAs a recent convert from Windows XP, I'm still a bit fuzzy on how Ubuntu deals with installing files. Can I just use the deb file from this page?\nOr will it muck up my current 1.3.12 installation?\n\nA: Installing a new version from a regular Ubuntu/Debian package will overwrite your current version. Ubuntu's package management does not support installing multiple versions of the same package.\nYour option is to build from source and specify a different install dir, check the following instructions:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingEasyHowTo\nOn your case during the source configure phase you will need to use:\n./configure --prefix=/opt/audacious1.2.6\n\nThis will make sure the files will be installed into /opt/audacious1.2.6 .\n\nA: Even if you get it working at all, Audacity 1.2.6 does not run well on modern versions of Ubuntu.\nMultiple versions of Audacity can be installed if built from the source code by setting a different installation location when running configure. For example, to set the installation location to your home directory, use:\n./configure --prefix=$HOME\n\nA simpler method is to not actually install the second version but just to build it within a folder. The second version can then be launched by either typing the full path to the executable in the command line, or by opening a Terminal window, navigating to the folder where you have built the second version, and then typing:\n./audacity\n\nHowever, I would recommend against trying to install Audacity 1.2.6 at all.\nIf your only reason for installing is to run a particular \"filter\", then the same, or an improved version of that filter is almost certainly available for Audacity 1.3.12. Unfortunately I cannot give any more information about this aspect as you have not said what this particular \"filter\" is.\nIf you are unable to find information about particular Audacity filters here on AskUbuntu I would recommend that you ask on the Audacity forum.\n\nA: well also... if you're willing to run 1.3.9 instead of 1.3.12 for your current version, you could install the old version the old fashion way... then run the portable appimage of 1.3.9 audacity which can be found at portablelinuxapps.org.\nthese work sort of similar to mac's .app files, it's a whole program in one file.\n2 notes\n1) this isn't an officially supported ubuntu method, but it is cool and it may help your problem... \n2) appimages from portablelinuxapps.org  are only for 32 bit. The people in charge of portablelinux apps are very stubborn about 64 bit support. They tell poeple that using 64 bit linux is not a good experience and that it will cause problems, which is completely ignorant. In my opinion that kind of attitude is whats holding the project and it's credibility back. it's a good solution, but it needs to support both sides of the coin. i personally think the guy behind \"RUNZ\" appimages at hacktolive.org has a much better approach but there aren't many packages available. I just wish the portable linux app people would get their head out of the rock it's under and realize that 64 bit is important to a whole lot of people considering it's the current standard technology.\n", "Q: What functionality of an iPad can I use with Ubuntu? What functionality of an iPad can I use with Ubuntu? I'm thinking about buying an iPad, but I only have Ubuntu PCs these days (no Windows, no Mac), and I'm nervous that it may be too reliant on the existence of iTunes. I'm less concerned about getting media onto and off it (and I have read that I can do this with libimobiledevice), but will I be able to activate it with iTunes? Does it need to be USB synced on a regular basis, or can I do most anything I want through the cloud (i.e. over wifi)?\nEdit: In answer to jrgifford's question, in theory, I'd like to do everything I would want to do with it were I using Windows/Mac. But more specifically, I think I'd want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Activate\" it, if that's necessary\n\n*Copy music / video onto it\n\n*Install apps\n\n\nHow much of this can I do without a Windows/Mac PC? Is it necessary to activate it?\nI don't think I'm that interested in backing it up (what would I back up?), but then again, maybe I'm confused as to how easy it is to get data on and off. Can I get a regular SFTP app for the iPad to copy data to my Ubuntu machine over wi-fi, for example?\n\nA: You cannot even boot an iPad until you connect it to iTunes. Personally, I installed iTunes on a WinXP VM at work (with permission) to activate it; activation this way works fine.\nWARNING: Do not attempt to upgrade iOS on the iPad from iTunes running on WinXP in a VM - it will fail half way through the process and leave the iPad in a state of limbo which requires a non-virtual WinXP + iTunes to rectify.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install apps directly from the AppStore app on the iPad itself. This merely requires an iTunes account, which you must have in order to activate the iPad anyway.\n\n*I've not personally had any luck transferring music or videos to the iPad (using libmobiledevice1 on Ubuntu 9.10). \n\n\n*\n\n*You can use the iPad as a mass storage device, but since iPad apps don't seem to have a concept of \"file-system\" they will never see them. Even the VLC app (no longer available) can only play videos which have been \"shared\" with it via iTunes.\n\n\n*I  have not tried running iTunes in Wine myself, but Wine's website gave the Jan 27 2011 release a 'Gold' rating (cf. http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=1347)\n(Oh, and I typed this on my iPad, so I guess it can at least do some things right. Although there's no way to type a backtick AFAICT)\n\nA: I have an iPad 2 and I only use Ubuntu.  There are free apps with which I can download my media to my computer, and files that I need I can send to myself with my email.\nYou only need to connect your iPad with itunes once -- I do this in the Apple store.\nYou can create your app-store acount in the iPad before that, or in the Apple store or in the itunes of someone else.\nThe only problem is that I don't have still music in the iPad.\n\nA: You can ask them activate it in a shop where you're buying it from (better ask them before you and them your money), or at a friend's place, work or where-ever you might find an installed iTunes. You don't need an iTunes all the time, but it's handy to have for the eventual upgrades, backups and so on.\n\n\n*\n\n*For music copying i'm not sure; i can copy to my jailbroken iPhone 3G with Banshee (just checked it for you, i'm always using Spotify anyway)\n\n*activation yes with iTunes\n\n*App installation goes fine directly over wifi or 3g, without iTunes\n\n\nYou will need an Apple ID for installing apps from App Store, and you use the same account for activation, and you can sign up for the account online from Apple's website.\nAs mentioned above, i have a jailbroken iPhone 3G. Ubuntu (11.04 Natty) mounts it (under ~/.gvfs) and i can access a selection of directories directly via Nautilus or other file management methods. Things might be difference for iPad.\nOn more thing, regarding the your literate question \"What functionality of an iPad can I use with Ubuntu?\" I'm using my iPhone as a 3G \"dongle\" via \"tethering\", it's great! I would assume an iPad could work as a ridicilous-size USB dongle too, but you might need to unlock it if you carrier tries to limit your tethering-options. Mine doesn't.\n\nA: Since the thread is old, but the question is still important, here is an updated answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since iOS 5, you can update your iOS over-the-air (thanks to @Andrew Ferrier for the correction).  If you want to do it via iTunes, as described above, you have to use iTunes on a real Windows / Mac box.  For all other purposes (e.g. music library), iTunes on a windows virtual machine works fine.\n\n*Ubuntu automatically mounts an ipad in two locations (inside ~/.gvfs).  The first is iPad Documents.  This allows you to see documents inside the apps that have been shared with iTunes.  For example, all goodreader documents that get backed-up to iTunes will be available to you.  Another example: if you save a pages document to iTunes from within the pages app, it will also be available here to sync, copy, or whatever you like.\n\n*I can use my iPad as a wifi hotspot, which Ubuntu or anything else will be able to use.  Required jailbreaking and installing MyWi.\n\n\nIn short, it works way, way better than I would have predicted.\n\nA: You can always use iTunes and Wine if you're that worried.\nHowever, to answer each of your questions, I don't think it needs to be activated unless it's for 3g (if you get a 3g model, and if you do that, I think you need to do that in-store, so they can activate it for you).\nCopying music works fine with Banshee and an iPod Touch, videos don't work very well because Banshee claims the iPod can't play mp4 videos (any mp4, not just certain ones). You may need to use iTunes for video, however, I haven't tried with Rythembox, so that might work.\nApps need to be installed through the App Store on your iPad. There is no backup for that unless you use iTunes.\nI'm not sure on the data thing, again, I think it's an iTunes thing.\nI do have to agree with Pitto, why not just get an Android Tablet, they're linux themselves and I think they'd integrate with Ubuntu better.\n\nA: I bought my teenage daughter an ipad for christmas and i used virtualbox with an xp install to get it up and going before wrapping it\n\nA: It should be noted, even though this thread is very old, that iOS5 now on I think all new iOS devices are running 5 now, do not need to ever be connected to iTunes.\n\nA: The iPad is very dependent on itunes - you need to connect it to itunes when you first pull it out of the box or you can't do anything with it.  For the most part, it is treated exactly like an ipod/iphone, so anything you can do with an ipod from ubuntu should be doable with an ipad. \nrelevant Ubuntu Community wiki documentation:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPod\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone\n\nA: Good Reader plays mp3 (m4b did not work, I don't know about other formats) and it is easy to sync with ubuntu. The device is recognized and I copy music into the document folder of good reader and play in good reader on the Ipad.\nEdit: AVPlayerHD is even better, this supported m4b and it is easy to copy files with file browser or via wifi.\nIt is to be questioned if this really is a solution, but it is a workaround at least.\n", "Q: How to start VPN service manually?

Adding a line to /etc/schroot/mount-defaults, with bind or rbind in the options didn't help: schroot always mounts the directory with bind, and it remains empty in the chroot.\nMy current solution is a script that remounts the /afs directory with rbind after the schroot has been set up.\nIs there a way to make schroot use rbind directly?\n\nA: # means run with root or sudo\n\n1.

I have created a PPTP connection back to my office, and managed to setup routing as suggested in this question, so that everything outside the office LAN keeps going to my current default gateway. \nMy problem is that I'd like to access some hosts in the office that are on a different subnet. Suppose I'm on the 1.2.x.y/24subnet and through the VPN I can access the 192.168.2.x/24 subnet (the office LAN). I'd like to access the office DMZ at 192.168.0.x/24 through the VPN.

(of course at the office the gateway on the LAN knows how to reach the DMZ).\n\nA: sudo route add 192.168.0.0/24 gw 192.168.2.VPNENDPOINTADDRESS  \n\nthe far end will either need to NAT or the far network will need to have a route back.\n", "Q: Whats eating my memory? I often face the problem that something is eating away on my memory, but I can't put my finger on what it is.\nI have redis, mysql, ruby, php and apache running on the same server, it's been running fine, but all of a sudden something is consuming too much memory. The TOP command doesn't tell me anything that worries me.\nHow can I find the problem?\n\nA: Try htop in a screen session, press F6, order by MEM, and you'll see that. Alternatively you can set up a munin-node, and get a graph that visualizes your system-behavior. atop -m also works very well for me. Some systems hide super-use processes.

This can come about either due to a bug in the package (or sometimes another package), in which case you should try to identify the problem and report the bug, or because you've been mucking about inside /usr, in which case, well, don't.\nThe workaround is to either do what it takes to satisfy the package script, or comment out the offending command in the package script. The package script you're having trouble with is located in /var/lib/dpkg/info/emacs23-lucid.postinst. The particular command that's failing is /usr/lib/emacsen-common/emacs-install ${FLAVOR}.\nThe first thing you should try is to fix the underlying problem. Here three files under /usr/share/emacs23 are missing. They should be symbolic links to the corresponding files under /usr/share/emacs. If they are broken symbolic links, try removing them; if the files under /usr/share/emacs23 don't exist but the files under /usr/share/emacs do, try creating the symbolic links.\nIf you don't manage to fix the problem, either\n\n\n*\n\n*comment out the offending line: edit the package script, add a # at the beginning of the problematic line(s);\n\n*or ignore the error: add || true at the end of the problematic command, or remove set -e near the beginning of the file.\n\n\nBeyond removing and reinstalling the emacs23-lucid package, you may need to reinstall other packages to put your system into a sane state, in particular the dictionaries-common package which provides the three troublesome .el files.\n\nA: There are very many unnecessary dependencies linked to Emacs for some reason. My advice is to remove all Launchpad versions of Emacs, Emacsen, and any other flavors of Emacs.\nYour next step is to go to gnu.org and download the latest Emacs that is available. You may have to build Emacs before installing it, but what you get from GNU will work without the extra baggage that either Ubuntu, Canonical, or Launchpad requires.\nI have other thoughts and opinions on this issue, but I have already gone too far as it is.\n", "Q: what do i have to do to use NX on a different port than 22 (SSH) I have installed OpenSSH server on my Ubuntu Linux box (10.04). I can SSH to the box properly, no problem. I have to use port 443/TCP. No problem accessing a shell prompt with PuTTY or other SSH client. Hoewver, when I try to use NX to have a graphical session, it is not responding. I thought that NX is simply using the settings used by /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Are there other parameters for NX that I should change so that it listens on port 443 ? \nI use NX from nomachine.com, and the version of all components is: 3.4.0-5\nThanks :-)\n\nA: On the commercial NX, edit /usr/NX/etc/server.cfg, change SSHDPort, and restart NX.\n(A little more... I like to link the NX etc directory.)\nln -s /usr/NX/etc /etc/nx\nsudo vim /etc/nx/server.cfg\n\nChange SSHDPort and save.\n/etc/init.d/nxserver restart\n\n\nA: If you are using FreeNX, you will need to edit /etc/nxserver/node.conf. In the General FreeNX Directives, locate this lines:\n# The port number where local 'sshd' is listening.\n#SSHD_PORT=22\n\nUncomment the second one and put there the port where sshd is listening.

I have a Windows 7 virtual machine running on the closed-source edition of Virtualbox, which has USB support. I want the VM to directly access a USB wireless adaptor, but can't attach the adaptor because it is in use. In this case I do need Windows to directly access the card and configure the wireless settings; configuring it in Ubuntu and bridging it will not suffice.\nAs soon as I plug in the USB stick, Network Manager is a bit too keen and grabs hold of it. Adding the below to /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf does cause Network Manger to not automatically manage the adaptor yet it remains inaccessible to VirtualBox.\n[keyfile]\nunmanaged-devices=mac:00:11:22:33:44:55\n\nHow can prevent anything from using the adaptor, so that I can attach it to the VM?\n\nA: I don't have a usb wireless adapter to try, but you can use dmesg after plugin the adapter to check the module that the kernel loads to use it, then rmmod it.\nOr you can use some udev rule to keep the module from loading.\nNote that, from the question, I assumed you are quite an advanced user, if you need more detailed instructions just ask.\n\nA: click to capture usb from virtual box menu before inserting usb drive . then virtual box would be able to install usb installer software..\n", "Q: How did Ubuntu know my WPA Key? I've recently moved my /home to another computer (keeping all configuration files), with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 10.10.\nAfter Installation I've installed wicd and ndiswrapper, to get my Internet Connection up and running. However, after changing /etc/network/interfaces from\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nTo\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\n\nand running sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart to get wlan0 set up, wicd just suddenly connected... to my modem. Without supplying any information about the modem whatsoever. Of course wicd creates a local directory at ~/.wicd/, but that directory is empty, and the temporary global configuration at /var/lib/wicd/configurations/ didn't exist due to fresh installation of ubuntu.\nSo what's the deal? Where did wicd get the ESSID and the WPA Key?\nThere hasn't been any activity in this question, but it's still open (and even worth some rep)!\n\nA: If you did not format your system, and installed on top of an old installation, then it is quite likely that your old settings were brought over (including settings in /etc). Whatever is not installed on the live CD would have been left alone, which is explains the apparent magic bunnies result that you experienced. It's less of a mysterious answer :( - but at least it's more realistic :).\n\nA: If the only common thing between the old computer and the new computer is within $HOME then the key must be in $HOME somewhere. So the question is really, which file is it in?\nYou could find out by getting a list of the file common to both machines (find $HOME -type f should do from your description). First backup these files and then remove them. Check that the key is no longer known. Then replace half of the files and check again, if it is not known then the key must be in the other half. Split the second half in two and keep going in that manner until you home in on the file containing your key.\nMight take a while.\n\nA: On a standard Ubuntu installation using GNOME and network-manager the WPA key is stored in the GNOME keyring. This will be restored with /home.\nYou can test if this is so in your settings by  temporarily deactivating keyrings in ~/.gnome2 (make a backup before you do so!).\nThe only other location I can think of where Wicd could get a WPA key from is etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf. I have no idea however how this file could have moved to your /home (if that is exclusively  what you restored).\nI don't use Wicd, therefore I can't check settings but if ~/.wicd is empty then there is no chance that any keys are being stored there. You maybe want to check if wicd_gui has another path to store things.\n\nA: WICD has a configuration file for all of the networks that have ever been connected to in\n/etc/wicd/wireless-settings.conf \nthis will contain a set of entries for every bssid (base station MAC address) that you have connected to. So when wicd sees a network that it has connected to before it will get the key values from this file.\nThere is also wired-settings.conf for the settings for wired connections, and various other settings in manager-settings.conf\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu One sync symbolic links with Windows? I noticed that the Windows Ubuntu One client currently doesn't support folders outside of the main ~/Ubuntu One folder.  I'm wondering if I can symlink to my other folders from within ~/Ubuntu One and have Ubuntu One synchronize them properly.  If this isn't supported yet, is it planned for the future?\n\nA: (removed - consider Stuart's answer)\n\nSay for example you want to synchronise /home/matt/test, instead of making a symbolic link to this directory in ~/Ubuntu One, make test be a symlink to ~/Ubuntu One/test, which is a proper directory.\nthat's\nmkdir Ubuntu\\ One/test\nln -s Ubuntu\\ One/test test\ncd /home/matt/test\n\nThis should alaways work, since Ubuntu One doesn't need to know about any of it.\n\nA: Until Ubuntu One for Windows implements a way to mark folders for synchronization, you could try creating Junctions (a sort of special link) on the folders you you wish to synchronize.\nTo do this without having to use the Windows command prompt or a separate microsoft toolkit, look for a program called Link Shell Extension (which seems to work in 32-bit and 64-bit Windows). After installing it, you can simply right-click-and-drag any folder into your Ubuntu One folder, and then select Drop --> Junction. \nIndividual files can be sync'd as well; the only difference is that you would select Drop --> Hard Link after right-click-dragging the desired files. \nHope this helps!\n\nA: Symlinks won't be followed in Ubuntu One for Windows. The way it will work is the same way as the existing Ubuntu One for Ubuntu: you'll be able to mark any folder as synchronised with Ubuntu One. We're working on that right now. :-)\n", "Q: How to force Testdrive to use zsync? While using testdrive gui, how to configure it to use zsync?\nThere seems to be no option to change that. Or is there a config file somewhere which can be edited?\n\nA: TestDrive will use rsync, and then zsync, and then wget by default.\nIf you'd like to force zsync, I think that's a reasonable configuration option we should support.  You're welcome to file a bug against the TestDrive project in Launchpad, http://launchpad.net/testdrive.\nCheers!\n\nA: After some googling 1 it seems testdrive will use zsync by default as long it's installed.\nUpdate:\nI have checked testdrive's source, it will use zsync if it can find the zsync command and if the image url starts with either http or ftp .\n", "Q: Opera web browser in Ubuntu Software Center Is Opera Web Browser going to be offered via Ubuntu Software Center?\n\nA: Opera used to be available in the Canonical partner repository (software in the partner repository is available in the Software Centre), but it was removed in December 2008 (the version in the repository at the time was very out of date).\nMy analysis of this is that there is not a huge desire in the Ubuntu community for Opera, but if either Canonical or Opera had a strong desire to have it there, then it certainly could happen again.\n\nA: Opera is a proprietary..You can get Opera from their website.Or you can probably add their repo if you're into binaries.Same reason that ubuntu offers Chromium, but not Chrome.\n\nA: Just download the debian package file from Opera web site and double click it to install. Once you install the deb, it will add the opera repositories to your Software Sources.\nhttp://www.opera.com/download/\nI would recommend version 11.0 beta, which has support for extensions and tab stacking, among other things.\nhttp://www.opera.com/browser/next/\n\nA: You can add Opera's package source to Apt:\necho \"deb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera-stable.list\n\nYou'll also need to get their signing key, else you'll get the scary \"unsigned package\" warning:\nwget -O - http://deb.opera.com/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -\n\nUpdate the package list, and then you can install it like any other app:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install opera\n\n", "Q: Cracking WPA wireless network encryption My teacher wont tell me the password of the wifi so I am wondering if there is a tool to know the security password of wifi.\nI can see the name of network in the network manager but when I click on it, it asks me WPA and WPA2 Personal security.....\n\nA: You will find that WPA and WPA2 encryption, when used alongside a strong password, is not easy to crack, whichever operating system you use. If it was WEP you would have had a chance though, because that is a much weaker form of encryption.\n\nA: Sorry, but no, there are no tools that will crack WPA and WPA2 encryption. If you see any on Google they are lying.\nBesides if you get caught you cold risk being denied graduation or qualifications. Don't do it.\n", "Q: When will Gnome 2.32.1 be available? When will gnome 2.32.1 packages be released on maverick?\n\nA: In general GNOME updates go through the Stable Release Updates process. Searching through the pending updates shows some 2.32.1 packages there. Here's an example.\nGenerally speaking looking at the meta package usually isn't enough, not all GNOME packages follow the same naming convention, some tarballs might not have a new release, etc. However our desktop team works closely with the GNOME release team on stable updates. \nIn certain cases the SRU/desktop/release team might only cherry pick fixes from the upstream point release and backport them. In cases like this it will be mentioned in the package changelog.\n", "Q: Download a flash video (not from a popular video community) There are a lot of tools to download videos from Youtube, Dailymotion, Vimeo, etc. but I'd be interested in a more generic way to download flash videos, for example the ones here: http://www.canalplus.fr/index.php?pid=3351\n\nA: Using Firefox with the FlashGot!  Firefox add-on has worked well for me. Wikipedia's  FlashGot article also lists some alternatives.\n\nA: Video Download Helper is the best extension for downloading videos from streaming sites. However some sites have protection and won't allow you to download.\nFor generic method, grab the videos from the /tmp folder or the browser cache folder. The location depends on the video player being used by the web site.\n\nA: On Linux you have two additional possibilities. For Flash files transmitted using http - that includes the likes of youtube, dailymotion - the downloaded videos are stored as /tmp/Flash* while they're being played back. If the files are transferred using rtmp, a proprietary protocol, you can try to find the relevant URLs and download using rtmpdump. This can sometimes be as simple as looking at the .html file, but it can also involve packet capturing to find the relevant parameters to supply to rtmpdump.\n\nA: In recent versions of flash, the video is saved in your browswer cache. The easiest way to ignore that fact and download the video, is to use flashgot. You can download videos from almost any site with it. It uses a detection method that can capture most videos on almost any site.\n\nA: In Chrome :\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up developer tools (Ctrl+Shift+I).\n\n*Load the page which contains video.\n\n*Click on Network Tab (in developer tools) and click on Type Column and locate the flash or video type ..\n\n*Next after locating the type click on corresponding row and locate the file.

This it shorthand for both ignorespaces (commands starting with spaces) and ignoredups (duplicates).\nI prefer ignoredups on its own as I find the default behaviour of ignoring commands with spaces at the front quite annoying when I copy a command off a website and it doesn't get saved because I accidentally copied in a space too.... But to each their own.\n\nA: From the bash man page:\n\nHISTCONTROL\n\nA colon-separated list of values controlling how commands  are  saved  on\n    the  history  list.   If  the  list of values includes ignorespace, lines\n    which begin with a space character are not saved in the history list.   A\n    value  of  ignoredups causes lines matching the previous history entry to\n    not be saved.  A value of ignoreboth is  shorthand  for  ignorespace  and\n    ignoredups.   A value of erasedups causes all previous lines matching the\n    current line to be removed from the history  list  before  that  line  is\n    saved.   Any  value  not in the above list is ignored.  If HISTCONTROL is\n    unset, or does not include a valid value, all lines  read  by  the  shell\n    parser are saved on the history list, subject to the value of HISTIGNORE.\n    The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are  not\n    tested,  and are added to the history regardless of the value of HISTCONTROL.\n\n\nSo put the following line in your ~/.bashrc:\nexport HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth:erasedups\n\nA: Putting this in ~/.bashrc will apply @alvin's solution across different sessions as wlell\nHISTCONTROL=ignoredups:erasedups\nshopt -s histappend\nPROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -n; history -w; history -c; history -r; $PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\nSource: Linux: Bash history: “ignoredups” and “erasedups” setting conflict with common history across sessions\n\nA: To uniqely record every new command is tricky.

(I almost never use the Windows side, actually.)\nUbuntu was bugging me to update, so I tried it (backing up everything first). Somehow, the update failed (I think because someone turned the computer off at the socket half way through). The computer now refuses to boot into Ubuntu.\nNow I have an Ubuntu 10.10 install disk. I want to use it to overwrite the existing Ubuntu installation, while leaving the Windows installation alone. I got as far as the advanced \"select a partition\" section, but I had no way of knowing which partition was which.\nWhat I have is\n/dev/sda\n  /dev/sda1   nfts\n  /dev/sda2   nfts\n  /dev/sda5   ext4\n  /dev/sda6   swap\n\nSo, I want to leave the NFTS partitions alone (why do I have two of them?) and install Ubuntu 10.10 on /dev/sda5. Is that right? I'm not sure what /dev/sda6 is used for. What is a \"swap area\" anyway? I think I'll leave it alone.\nSo I selected /dev/sda5 and told the installer to use it as the \"Ext4 journaling file system\". The Install button lights up, but when I click it I'm told that no root file system is defined. How do I go about defining a root file system?\nGParted shows this slightly differently:\n\n(Click to enlarge.)\n\nA: If you had multiple linux partitions and you don't remember the content per device names you will need to manually mount them and verify the contents.\nBoot from the live cd with the \"try it without installiing\" option, then launch a terminal and check the list of partitions:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nExample output:\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n    /dev/sda5           72947       76593    29294496   83  Linux\n    /dev/sda6           76594       80240    29294496   83  Linux\n\nChecking the contents of /dev/sda5 :\nsudo mkdir -p /media/sda5\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /media/sda5\ngksudo nautilus /media/sda5\n\n\nA: If you boot into the Live CD you can access System > Administration >  Gparted. You can look at the filesystem type and your windows is NTFS while the Ubuntu partitions are likely ext3 or 4.\n\nA: I just had to do this earlier today. What I did was I found out which partition was formatted as FAT and which was formatted as ext4. It was fairly obvious in the \"Select partition\" screen. I selected the ext4 partition for the installation partition.\n\nA: \nSetup:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda5   ext4 is your ubuntu partition, \n\n\nSelect it and set the filesystem to ext4. Set the mount point to / (this is what you missed and why the installer was complaining). If you check the box next to format you will get a clean install, if you don't check it ubuntu will not overwrite your /home folder, so all your files and settings should be there after installation\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda6   swap is your swap partition\n\n\nSet its filesystem to SWAP (it will be formated, but this is OK)\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda2   nfts is your windows partition, leave it alone\n\n*/dev/sda1   nfts is probably some system partition from the OEM, also leave it alone.\n\nWhat is a \"swap area\" anyway ?\n\nSwap is used to store data if your RAM is full. It is also used to copy your RAM to if you hibernate your PC.  \n\nA: \nHow do I go about defining a root file system?\n\nIf you select manual partitioning, you can delete the sda5 (ext4) and sda6 (swap) partitions.  This will give you a bunch of free space.  Click on the free space and Add a partition.  Size it to be about 2 GB less than the available free space.  Select ext4 and in the Mount Point box select / which gives you root.  Now the system tells you that you have a new ext4 partition and 2 GB of free space.  Click on the free space, add a partition and, instead of the default ext4, select swap.  Now, you have an ext4 partition where Ubuntu 10.01 will be installed and a swap area which Linux uses as temporary storage space when the operating system is running.\n[I'm not sure if you need to delete and recreate the swap partition, but this process keeps things relatively tidy - Ubuntu will be (perhaps) sda7 and the swap partition will be the next available number (sda8).]     \n\nA: Just keep in mind that Linux does not use NTFS partitions, so if you don't want to screw up your Windows just don't touch them in Ubuntu installation.\n", "Q: Slow USB transfer The transfer of files to a usb device has been very slow. On dslreports.com, a guy has found its cause. The problem occurs when you plug a USB 1.1 device at the same USB HUB where you are using the USB 2.0 device then it defaults to the lowest. Is there a solution for it? A solution where I can use both device at the same time without get slow transfer rate.\n\nA: Are you sure this is what's causing the problem? That shouldn't be happening... I have had USB 2 devices plugged in at the same time as USB 1.1 devices and there was no drop in transfer speed.\nI'm guessing that either something else is using all of the bus bandwidth or your USB host controller is malfunctioning. Try plugging in different devices and seeing what happens. Do you get full speed from the USB 2 device when it is the only thing plugged in? What about the USB 1.1 device?\n\nA: This answer may read as snarky, but it certainly doesn't intend to.  Briefly, if you have multiple usb host ports, use them instead of a powered hub.\n\nA: maybe it is because your hard disk is too fragmented...\n", "Q: HP LaserJet 4L is not working After I have Installed Ubuntu 10.10 my printer is not working anymore. My printer is connected through a parallel port. I was told that the cups have changed in Maverick. Is there any solution?\n\nA: I had the same problem and I noticed in (System → Administration → Printing> Policies) that I needed to put a check mark by \"Enabled\" \"Accepting jobs\" and \"Shared\".\n", "Q: Updating a mysql production server without having problems I have a mysql server, ubuntu server 10.04.\nIt works great and we're really happy about it.\nTime for updates has come and I am sincerely scared: can I do a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade with light heart?\nI thought that maybe using just security updates would be safer or I'm just preoccupied about nothing?\nIn one single question: can I cause problems to production by updating my ubuntu server?\n\nA: If you're just using lucid-updates, the policies are pretty solid for stable release updates. Basically only small changes that won't change the behavior of the software in an incompatible way are allowed.\nHere are some steps you can take to make sure it goes smoothly.\n1) Read the change logs for all new packages. If you're using apt-get upgrade, look at the list of packages that are going to be updated. The easiest way is to use aptitude (apt-get install aptitude if you don't already have it):\naptitude changelog foo\nThis will show you the changelog of the package, including un-applied updates. If you see something like \"LP: #123456\" this is a Launchpad bug report that has been fixed by that update, you can read the full bug report at http://launchpad.net/bugs/123456\n2) backup our system. You should be doing this anwyay!\n3) Schedule downtime. While most updates won't cause LONG downtime, they will probably involve restarting services to pickup updated configurations and/or libraries, so be ready to have brief service interruption.\n3a) Test stopping/starting your services BEFORE the update. We get a lot of bug reports in Ubuntu from users thinking an update broke their system, when in fact the configs had been wrong for a while but the problems had gone unnoticed because the service was running fine with the old, non-broken configuration.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Regular updates from official repositories (I am assuming you are doing just apt-get upgrade, and not a release upgrade) are usually safe.\nAnyway there are some best practices which apply to critical servers and should be followed when applying upgrades:\na) Make a full db backup priot to the upgrade\nb) Have a rollbackup plan, make sure you have the previous version .debs stored or available in case you need to rollback to the previous version\n\nA: Go for it you're safe! Safer than having security issues...\n", "Q: How can I request that a font be added to the official repositories? I think it would be beneficial to have the Cardo font included in Ubuntu's official repositories.\nWhere can I make this kind of request?\n\nA: You'll almost certainly want to get this font into Debian first.  By doing so, you'll save resources on the packaging maintenance, since it nearly always will flow into Ubuntu automatically through Debian.\n", "Q: dhcpd offers ip address but client doesn't get ip I set up a dhcpd on my ubuntu server with this configuration:\nplease note that the ubuntu server which runs the dhcpd has a static ip\nof 192.168.1.50\ndefault-lease-time 600;\nmax-lease-time 7200;\n\noption subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\noption broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;\noption routers 192.168.1.50;\noption domain-name-servers 192.168.1.50;\noption netbios-name-servers 192.168.1.50;\n\nsubnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\nrange 192.168.1.150 192.168.1.200;\n}\n\nNow when I try to get an ip from the dhcpd server from my ubuntu client computer the server offers an ip from the pool of 192.168.1.150 but the client doesn't seem to pick it up, instead it fires new requests until a timeout occurs:\nListening on LPF/eth0/00:24:8c:1d:fb:40\nSending on   LPF/eth0/00:24:8c:1d:fb:40\nSending on   Socket/fallback\nDHCPRELEASE on eth0 to 195.130.132.102 port 67\nInternet Systems Consortium DHCP Client V3.1.3\nCopyright 2004-2009 Internet Systems Consortium.\nAll rights reserved.\nFor info, please visit https://www.isc.org/software/dhcp/\n\nListening on LPF/eth0/00:24:8c:1d:fb:40\nSending on   LPF/eth0/00:24:8c:1d:fb:40\nSending on   Socket/fallback\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 3\nDHCPOFFER of 192.168.1.150 from 192.168.1.50\nDHCPREQUEST of 192.168.1.150 on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67\nDHCPREQUEST of 192.168.1.150 on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 5\nDHCPOFFER of 192.168.1.150 from 192.168.1.50\nDHCPREQUEST of 192.168.1.150 on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67\nDHCPREQUEST of 192.168.1.150 on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 7\nDHCPOFFER of 192.168.1.150 from 192.168.1.50\nDHCPREQUEST of 192.168.1.150 on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67\nDHCPREQUEST of 192.168.1.150 on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67\n...\n\ntcpdump information:\ntcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode\nlistening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 96 bytes\n19:04:18.431422 IP 94.227.60.1.67 > 255.255.255.255.68: BOOTP/DHCP, Reply, length 300\n19:05:10.316903 IP 94.224.188.1.67 > 255.255.255.255.68: BOOTP/DHCP, Reply, length 300\n\niptables information is the same for both server and client:\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination    \n\nAny ideas??\n\nA: I found a solution, iptables was blocking the dhcp port.\nI needed to add this rule that would cause UFW to open the DHCP port, called bootps in /etc/services\nsudo ufw allow bootps\n\n\nA: Make sure that there isn't a firewall on either server or client that is blocking the responses from the server.

I saw in default gnome theme icons when I clicked right the mouse. The icons are very useful for orientation in the menu.\nSee the picture below. How can I add some icons to standard ubuntu theme?\nIf there no icon pack how can I add my own icons?\n\n\nA: You can enable this option (It's disabled by default) in the configuration manager. This should be available through Applications -> System Tools -> Configuration Manager (The System Tools menu may be hidden - you can make it visible by going to System -> Preferences -> Main Menu and selecting the checkbox next to System Tools, and possibly the one next to Configuration Editor in side the System Tools menu). Alternatively you can run gconf-tool from the command line.\nYou'll need to navigate to desktop -> gnome -> interface\n\nSelect menus_have_icons and check the box.\nIf you want the quick one liner you can enter the following in your terminal\ngconftool --set --type bool /desktop/gnome/interface/menus_have_icons 0\n\nThis is the outcome\n\n\nA: See comment 4 for bug 974915 \"Nautilus Context menu missing icons\".\nSebastien Bacher wrote on 2012-04-06:\n\nicons for most components got turned off like 2 years ago, they are only there in menu for objects like applications or directories, not for actions etc\n\nSebastien Bacher wrote on 2012-04-09:\n\nit's not a bug, it's a design decision\n\nBut the following tip works!\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute Alt+F2 → run gnome-tweak-tool\n\n*Navigate to \"Theme\" settings\n\n*Enable icons in Context menus using the sliders \"Menus Have Icons\" and \"Buttons Have Icons\"\n\n*Restsart Gnome Shell doing Alt+F2 → r\n\nA: For ubuntu 12.04 to 15.04+\nTo enable menu have icons, run:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface menus-have-icons true\n\nTo enable button have icons, run:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface buttons-have-icons true\n\nTo do it graphically install dconf-editor or dconf-tools\nsource\n\nA: I don't know how to add your own icons.

The ping manual says that ping -a will generate audible pings, but when I try this no sound is made.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: 1 says it's missing a sound file. You can add it with the following command:\n  pactl upload-sample /usr/share/sounds/gnome/default/alerts/glass.ogg bell.ogg\n\nFor a permanent solution add the command to ~/.xprofile\n\nA: Because the question is not specified for Unity only, I'll make a little hint about KDEs  Konsole. You just should specify a sound for a \"Bell in Visible Session\" which is under Settings -> Configure Notifications. For example I'm using sounds from /usr/share/sounds/ section. I don't remember is there such an option in Ubuntu's Unity terminal.\n\nA: From looking at the source, ping produces a bell by printing the ASCII bell char '\\a', which is doing nothing, probably because the system beep is disabled.\nYou can manually try to produce the bell with:\necho -e \"\\a\"\n\n\nA: compiz \"eats\" the sound and this is a reported bug, so it won't work in the graphical interface in standard compiz ubuntu sessions. (see this bug report, thanks to Dylan McCall comment for the URL).\nIf you really need the functionality, you could run your ping from a physical console (Ctrl+Alt+F1). But don't forget:\nsudo modprobe pcspkr\n\nAs module pcspkr isn't loaded at boot time and actually drives the old PC speaker you should have in your computer.\nYou can add it to /etc/modules if you think you'll need it at a regular basis as this will have the effect to tell the system to load it at boot time.\nNote: as it's a compiz issue, if you are using gnome-fallback session you shouldn't experience the issue. If this is the case, check your terminal program for options related to console bell.\n\nA: In my case I am using KDE in Kubuntu.  I had to tick a checkbox:\n\n*\n\n*Search applications for Notifications, subtitle is Event Notifications and Actions\n\n*Then under Applications select Konsole.\n\n*Then select Configure Events...\n\n*Then highlight Bell in Non-Focused Session\n\n*Then tick next to Play a sound\n\nA: In my case, audible bell was disabled because of xset -b in my ~/.xsession file and could be re-enabled with xset b.\n\nA: If you are using Terminator as terminal on Ubuntu 18.10, left-click the Terminator, select preferences/profiles, and there is the audible beep option.\n\nA: In my case; I just had to turn on/up the 'system sounds' in settings. (see screenshot)\n\n", "Q: How can I get audiobooks from Banshee's 'Internet Archive' plugin into my library? When I view an audiobook in the Internet Archive 'store' in Banshee, there is no option to add it to my library, or even to download the files. I can still stream these files but because I can't view them in my library, I can't get them onto my mp3 player. I am however able to download the files if I do so directly from archive.org.\nIs this just a missing feature, or is there actually a reason for this?\n\nA: This is because of how Banshee is setup, it has nothing to do with IA itself.\nThe main reason you can't download is probably because the Banshee developers didn't care enough to add in that feature, and you can, and probably should, add a request to be able to do that.\nYou can, however, download the file without opening up your browser. Just open up nautilus or whatever file browser you use and drag the file from the files pane to your nautilus window. You still have to import in Banshee, but at least you don't need to open your web browser.\n", "Q: How to edit together split-screen videos? with what software i can split the screen of a video? putting like 3 videos at the same time in one video....here is an example of what i want to do\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JynWHMAQrHQ\n\nA: You can do this with the composite transition in kdenlive \nsudo apt-get install kdenlive\n\n\nWatch this video tutorial to find out how and, as a bonus, how to do a green screen effect.\n\nA: How to do this in openshot:\n\n*\n\n*Put each clip on a seperate track beneath each other\n\n\n\n\n*Right-click clip > properties > layout\n\n\n*Set height and Width to 50% set x and y to 0% or 50% depending on location of clip.\nExample for top-left clip\n\nExample for bottom-right clip\n\nResult\n\n\nA: Here's a tutorial using Cinelerra.\nUnfortunately it seems you have to manually compile it, if you are using the latest Ubuntu 10.10 \"Maverick Meerkat\": http://cinelerra.org/getting_cinelerra.php#ubuntu\n", "Q: Accessing googlecl using python script I am trying to create a python gtk program which uses googlecl tools like listing google calendar appointments, accessing the google blog etc. However I do not know how to call the command in python gtk.\nThe command for running googlecl in the terminal is\ngoogle calendar list --date 2010-12-02 \nThis command would list all the appointments in google calendar on the 2nd of december if entered in the terminal.

Any help would be appreciated.\nGooglecl is a command line tool released by google to facilate easy management of common tasks like google calendar, google blogger, google docs etc. You can find more info on code.google.com/p/googlecl/\n\nA: There's a very good chance (If you're using Python 3) that you'll want to use the  Subprocess Module which will allow you to make, and collect output from, system calls - like the googlecl command.\nIf you're using Python < 2.6 (Odds are you aren't since 2.6 is the official version in the repos) Then you'll want to use the  Commands Module.

I need a GUI application that shows the binary representation of text, using binary numbers, not hexadecimal numbers. Any suggestions?\nFor example, the program should convert the text Hi to 1001000 1101001.\nI would prefer a graphical application to a command-line utility.\n\nA: You could try ppt from the bsdgames package.

Unfortunately not, but a good alternative is xxd found at U&L:\necho 'Hello, world!' | xxd -b\n0000000: 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00101100  Hello,\n0000006: 00100000 01110111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100   world\n000000c: 00100001 00001010                                      !.\n\n\nA: After further consideration and removing my first answer, I now note that you don't want to see the readable text in a binary (e.g. with the strings utility), but see text in binary form.\nSo, I think the KDE utility, okteta is just what you want, and it is available in the repositories and can be installed with\nsudo apt-get install okteta\n\nIt allows you to view text files in binary form (see the second screenshot below), and you can click the tab at the bottom of the page to switch between binary form, hexadecimal, decimal, and octal. You can even create a new file and start entering text and, if you have the binary mode selected, the characters typed will be shown in binary, just like in the online converter you linked to. The screenshot directly below shows an example of this: \n\nThis application does exactly what you have specified in the question, and it is a gui as well, so that seems to tick all the boxes.\nOkteta seems to be the most fully featured editor available, and there are also modules and plugins that give additional functionality. \n\n\nA: GHex - a hex editor for GNOME\nGHex allows the user to load data from any file, view and edit it in either hex or ascii.\nUseful for debugging problems with object code or encodings.\n ghex \n\n", "Q: Are there magic commit words in Launchpad Code? I know in a lot of source control tracking systems (Redmine, Trac, Jira) you can add magic words like resolves #1234 in your commit message to have the bug updated to a certain status. Is there a feature like this with Launchpad - if so where, or what, is the list of magic keywords?\nAn example can be seen on Redmine's issue tracker page.\nhttp://www.redmine.org/issues/6987 has two \"Associated Revisions\"\nThey're associated because the commit message has Fixed: Wiki#find_page should not be case sensitive because page title uniqueness is not (#6987). The combination of Fixed as a keyword and #6987, bug's unique ID, automatically updated the associated ticked to fixed.\n\nA: From http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/development/en/user-reference/bugs-help.html:\n\nWhen making a commit, metadata about bugs fixed by that change can be recorded by using the --fixes option. For each bug marked as fixed, an entry is included in the ‘bugs’ revision property stating ‘<url> <status>’. (The only status value currently supported is fixed.)\nThe --fixes option allows you to specify a bug tracker and a bug identifier rather than a full URL. This looks like:\nbzr commit --fixes <tracker>:<id>\n\nFor example,\nbzr commit --fixes lp:1234 -m \"Fixes bug #1234 will mark Launchpad bug #1234 as fixed. The \"Fixes bug #1234\" message does not mark the bug as fixed but it will link to the bug report when browsing the commit history in Launchpad.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to use mouse gestures without pressing a key?

In an effort to clean up from a software bug in md, I marked half of a RAID (/dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1 in RAID1) as faulty using:\nmdadm /dev/md2 --fail /dev/sdb1\nmdadm /dev/md2 --remove /dev/sdb1\n\nBut now I want to use the \"failed\" half instead. i.e. instead of using /dev/sda1, I want to use /dev/sdb1, but mdadm refuses to bring it online:\nmdadm --stop /dev/md2\nmdadm -A /dev/md2 /dev/sdb1 --run --force\n\nThis fails, as it considers /dev/sdb1 a \"spare\" and not an actual member of the array any more.\n\nA: You're using -A which is --assemble, but you should be using -a which is --add.\nIf I recall correctly, devices (re)added to an existing array are always added as spares, then shortly afterwards the kernel will pick up that the array is both degraded and has a spare, and then it will start re-mirroring.  You can see this with watch cat /proc/mdstat.\n\nA: The entire command that should be run is one of the following assuming the array is not assembled or running (which the OP shows as not running):\nIf the array is not running:\nmdadm --assemble /dev/md2 /dev/sdb1\n\nHowever if the array is running:\nmdadm --manage /dev/md2 -a /dev/sdb1\n\n\nA: I think that the simpliest way to unmark the partition would be to add it again to the array. By the way, if you need to do a test, don't remove the drive from the array. Flag it as faulty and if you reboot, it will fall back on the other partition.\nmdadm /dev/md2 --add /dev/sdb1\n\n", "Q: Browse internet inside terminal Is there any other package other than elinks so that I browse internet inside the terminal using terminal as a browser. I feel elinks is a bit difficult to operate.\n\nA: lynx is my favorite. It is available in the Software Center.\n\nA: There are three families of text web browsers.\nlynx is the classic text mode web browser. It's slightly older than the web. Its interface is nothing to write home about. It has the advantage of being available on many exotic platforms.\nlinks is a more recent implementation of the same concept. There's an alternate development tree, elinks, for which there is an experimental patch for Javascript support, but this is not enabled in the Ubuntu package.\nw3m has an interface with a  different (and I think much more nicer) feel. It's better than the others (though links has been improving lately) at rendering web sites with complex formatting, not necessarily the way the designer intended it, but in a readable way. It can display images. There's an Emacs interface, w3m-el.\nMy recommendation is to use w3m now but keep an eye on (e)links's evolutions.\n\nA: Elinks is IMHO best to use on a daily basis.\nAmongst other features it supports \n\n\n*\n\n*tabs\n\n*bookmarks\n\n*javascript\n\n*tables\n\n*transparency \n\n*and you can easily \"pipe\" a page to any other program like Firefox with vimperator, or scripts if you'd like. \n\n\nGmail is still very much workable and as any other page, very fast under Elinks. \n\nA: You can try w3m.\nIt is Lynx with utf support..\n\nA: Browsh is an excellent CLI web-browser.

Now I get the following bunch of errors.\nchethan@chethan-desktop:~/Applications/grass64_release/display/d.rast$ make\ngcc -I/home/chethan/Applications/grass64_release/dist.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/include  -g -O2       -DPACKAGE=\\\"\"grassmods\"\\\"  -I/home/chethan/Applications/grass64_release/dist.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/include -o OBJ.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/main.o -c main.c\nmain.c: In function ‘main’:\nmain.c:89: error: ‘flag_n’ undeclared (first use in this function)\nmain.c:89: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once\nmain.c:89: error: for each function it appears in.)\nmake: *** [OBJ.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/main.o] Error 1\n\nI have no clue as to why these errors arise. What should I do now?\n\nA: Because the code in the SVN's development branch can often be broken, you have 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check out an older revision of the SVN repo: svn checkout -r REVISION_NUMBER http://whatever/the/repo/is, where REVISION_NUMBER is the last-working revision.\n\n*Fix it yourself - if you know C, it could be trivial.\n\n*Update the checked-out copy again - maybe it's already fixed!\n\n\nA: That error means there is a problem with the source, probably they introduced a change which was not tested or is not finished. when using a version from SVN you must be prepared that it may be broken during development.\n", "Q: What interface mockup programs are available? Are there any interface mockup design applications for Ubuntu? I need one in order to design programs or interfaces (internet sites and more).\n\nA: As has  been suggested in many other similar threads, Pencil offers you a nice framework for prototyping and wireframing (even web stuff). And it's free.\n\nI realise you've already said this isn't the answer you're looking for (having been linked to my question on the topic) but my scope is web development... Which is what you say you want to do. It's perfect for fleshing out page-level objects in a quick grid layout. Much more simple than a full graphics package, with various UI hints available as drag-on objects.\nThere's a deb package available for installation.\n\nA: I see you mention \"internet sites\". For web interface mockups, I like to use gomockingbird.com. \nIt's very quick and web-based, so it will definitely work in Ubuntu. You could probably use it for software application interface development, as well. \n\nA: If you are a professional and looking for professional application then you can try balsamiq\nDownload the desktop app for windows and install it via wine.\nIt has a 30 day trial period after which you have to buy its license with $89.\nAccording to me it is the best one in the market.\n\nA: As was mentioned above WireframeSketcher wireframing tool is also available on Ubuntu. Recently I started providing a standalone version so it's not Eclipse only anymore. Give it a try.\n\n\nA: Currently Balsamiq is the widely used program for mock ups etc in the cooperate levels. It is professional. \nThey have an trial version which you can download and play with. It is not FREE. \nhttps://balsamiq.com/products/\nIf you are looking for an open-source GUI prototyping tool Pencil Project is recommended. It is FREE.\nhttps://pencil.evolus.vn/\nIt works on Fedora, Ubuntu, Windows and Mac OSX. \nFind the download page of Pencil Project.\nhttps://pencil.evolus.vn/Downloads.html\n\nA: I've been playing with Pencil, it's a good program, but I couldn't get any export function to work and I didn't like the program starting a firefox process. In the other hand, I also tried balsamiq mockups, really nice program as well but I ended up sick because they use Adobe Air to make the program available for all platforms, and you already know that Adobe Air doesn't support Linux anymore. Finally I tried Wireframesketcher, I installed it in a few seconds, with an integrated Ubuntu inferface. It's very intuitive and it has got all the features I was looking for. Very powerful program.\n\nA: You can always use Inkscape to create a few shapes and be very flexible. Just need to get the basics of Inkscape geometry stuff down for precise positioning of elements and you're good to go, almost unlimited possibilities. Once you've created a nice little palette, you just copy paste and align elements. Whenever you need something new, it's usually not too hard to add.\n", "Q: Organize Folders In Ubuntu One I have uploaded some music folders from my computer to my Ubuntu One storage. I want to know if there is a way to have those folders moved into another folder I created or have them sync to that folder in Ubuntu One. Thanks.\n\nA: Ubuntu One is an automatic synchronization service so anything you change in your Ubuntu one folder will after a short delay be duplicated online and on anyother systems you have connected with the same account.\nExample.\nI am on holiday with my laptop. I take some pictures and transfer them to my laptop putting them in my Ubuntu one folder. I have a Computer at home which is signed in to my Ubuntu one account and turned on. It will receive a copy of those files in a few minutes. At which point the files will be mirrored in three different places the laptop, online and in the computer at home. One additional feature is the ability to add folders external to the Ubuntu one folder to be synced by Ubuntu one for you. Your documents folder for example.\nI hope this helps explain the feature a bit better for you.   \n", "Q: Switch to a targeted initrd after setup? During the Ubuntu Server setup, I was given a choice to install a 'targeted' initrd with only the modules my computer needs. I chose the other option, 'generic'. How can I install a 'targeted' initrd now that I've already installed my system?\n\nA: Edit /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf and change\nMODULES=most\n\nto\nMODULES=dep\n\nthen run\nupdate-initramfs -u\n\n\nA: Switching initrd type\nAs you correctly pointed out yourself, change the initramfs-tools MODULE= setting from most to dep or the other way around, depending on your wishes.\nNote, however, that hooks in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d overrule the setting from /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf. A file driver-policy is created there when choosing a targeted initrd, at least on Debian (Jessie), that has MODULES=dep.\nReasons for generic initrd\nYou might be interested in going the other way around (towards generic initrd) if you miss USB keyboard support for your LUKS password on boot. It seems the dep option fails to detect the necessity for keyboard support.\nReport examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=771623\n\n*https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=701681\nIf you like your lean targeted initrd, you might want to include modules hid_generic and usbhid in /etc/initramfs-tools/modules for USB keyboards to work in initrd. Might be xhci_hcd is also required if you use a USB3.0 controller to connect your keyboard\n\nA: You probably want to install the linux-image-server package. \n", "Q: Why is hibernation performance so poor? Why is the hibernation performance (i.e the time taken to hibernate and wake up) on my laptop so poor with Ubuntu? This isn't a criticism per se but I'd be interested to know if there was a particular reason why it was so slow. \nIs this a problem with every Ubuntu install? \nMy hardware specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core i3 2.13 GHz\n\n*3 GB DDR3 RAM\n\n*320 GB HDD \n\n\nHDD benchmark:\n/dev/sda5:\n Timing buffered disk reads:   96 MB in  3.06 seconds =  31.40 MB/sec\n\n\nA: Per your updates moving the entire RAM contents to swap (which is required because you need to save/restore the RAM state) would take 3*1024/31 = 99 seconds. That is probably the main time consuming operation.\n", "Q: Web sites see my firefox as a mobile browser Something strange happening to me is that some sites see firefox as a mobile browser on ubuntu and force usage of their mobile interface with no option to switch to full view. They work well with chrome on ubuntu and firfox on windows.  \nSo how can i solve this problem ?  \nUpdate: \n\n\n*\n\n*Example site:\nhttp://www.shorouknews.com (It's an Arabic news website)  \n\n*My user agent string:  \nMozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101027 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.12  \nPlease note that the site works well on Chrome in ubuntu and Firfox on windows.\n\nA: That particular site does the same for me in default Firefox on Ubuntu 10.10.\nThe problem is with particular websites, not with Ubuntu. It's possible they are somehow deciding you are probably using Android or something similar.\nI'd suggest contacting the website owner.\nAlternatively you could install the user agent switcher Firefox add-on to pretend you are using a different browser/operating system and fool the website.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Encryption? I have two questions... \nFirstly, is the communication between my Ubuntu desktop and the Ubuntu One cloud encrypted? \nSecondly, are the files, media etc. stored on my Ubuntu one account encrypted on the servers?\n\nA: This bug contains a good explanation of the state of encryption in Ubuntu One at the moment: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-client/+bug/375289\n\nA: Regarding the communication with the cloud, yes, SSL is used, it's described at https://one.ubuntu.com/privacy/ .\nAbout storage encryption, it is not specified on the privacy statement, I remember reading somewhere that it is not encrypted. Anyway you should be able use encfs or other file based encryption mechanism.\nUpdate:\nI have found the following answer about successfully using encfs with Ubuntu One: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-client/+question/74734\nUpdate2:\nA full guide explaining how to do per file encryption in UbuntuOne can be found here\nUpdate3:\nThe official word is that storage is not encrypted.\n", "Q: How can I run compiz-fusion effects with ATI Radeon x1250? I was installing ubuntu 10.10 to my friend laptop, but when trying to set up effects, I got an error. Then I tried to install proprietary drivers, but this card is too old and no longer supported. :( Please help.\n\nA: It would be REALLY hack-ish, but you could install the old driver from here:\nhttp://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/ati-driver-installer-8.42.3-x86.x86_64.run\nand follow the guide here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=588605\n....might be more pain than it's worth though, and it will effectively move you into the \"unsupported\" bracket.  \nYes, I know that how-to is OLD(3 years), but it gets the old driver installed-ish and working sort of.\n\nA: I have the same video card in my laptop and find that I don't need to install any drivers. The open-source radeon drivers have improved recently and seem to work ok at least for Compiz (no good for games though). Unfortunately, there is some problem that just appeared in Unity-3D and compiz with Ubuntu 11.10, but 11.04 works great.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Firefox 3.0 as well as the default package? I'm a webdeveloper and using ubuntu 10.10 maverick. I want to track down a bug that appears in firefox 3.0, but not 3.5/3.6. Is there an easy way to install firefox 3.0 without it overwriting/clobbering my main install of firefox? i.e. I want to install both 3.0 and 3.6 at the same time\n\nA: You can download old firefox version here:\nftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/\nYou can extract it to some dir in your home and run it from there. Please be careful to use a new profile.\nYou can use:\n./firefox -P profilename\n\nor\n./firefox -P ProfileManager\n\nto select witch profile you want to use.\n\nA: Perhaps too late, but...get my FoxTester extension. It allows you to install any number of Firefox versions you want and launch them without even leaving your default Firefox. Each version gets it's own profile, so you can mess things without fear. Everything is done through the extension context menu and the extension detects Firefox installation files from a monitored folder. All you need is to download the versions you want to the same folder and install via FoxTester. It also allows to check hash number of downloaded files.\nSee demo at http://foxtester-extension.blogspot.com/\n", "Q: Can I limit the amount of logging to \"/var/log\", especially for \"bootchart\"? I've just noticed that I have 342 MB of log files in /var/log \nIn particular /var/log/bootchart takes 329 MB of this space!  \nAs I'm only running a home desktop environment, I can't see how I need this amount of \"history\", and perhaps don't need bootchart at all.  \nHow can I limit/prevent this bootchart logging (and what purpose does it serve)?  \n\nA: First, what is bootchart? Bootchart allows you to check the boot sequence and generate a chart showing how long each process ran during the boot process, and how much CPU/IO they used.\nOnce installed, bootchart runs on every boot. However, you can edit the variable GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in '/etc/default/grub' to include bootchart=disable, which stops bootchart from running at all. Don't forget to run sudo update-grub afterwards to update GRUB's configuration file.\nIf you want to run it at a later point, edit the GRUB entry at boot (by pressing the 'c' key at the GRUB menu you can edit the highlighted entry), and remove bootchart=disable from the the 'linux' line. This will enable bootchart once for the following boot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu keeps creating dummy directories Whenever I boot into Ubuntu, something (frankly, I'm not sure which program does that) creates a bunch of directories, namely ~/Music, ~/Videos, ~/Documents, and ~/Audiobooks. \nI know it's possible to change the names of these directories with ubuntu-tweak, but I don't want these directories in the first place... \nHow do I prevent Ubuntu, or whatever program is responsible for the creation of these Directories, from creating them?\n\nA: Go to System → Preferences → Startup Application and disable \"User folder update\".\n\n\nA: You can also use UbuntuTweak to set them to arbitrary directories.\n", "Q: How to browse the web safely with Mozilla Firefox? i want to know how can i possibly keep me secured from forgery sites. i am currently using mozilla 3.7 \n\nA: Add-Ins for enhanced security:\nNoScript\nAdBlock\nHTTPS Everywhere\n\nA: Firefox 3 or later contains built-in Phishing and Malware Protection to help keep you safe online. These features will warn you when a page you visit has been reported as a Web Forgery of a legitimate site (sometimes called “phishing” pages) or as an Attack Site designed to harm your computer (otherwise known as malware).\nSOURCE\nNOTE:\nYou can also install the following Add-ons for Firefox, for secure browsing.With flash and scripting off, all that is left in browser is html and images and these are not too dangerous.\nFlashblock NoScript Adblock Plus\n\nA: use wot ( web of trust) plugin for firefox.it will keep you secure to some extent from forgery sites...\n\nA: You should remove your browsing history regularly.\nUse strong passwords for websites and Ubuntu (login) accounts.

But acceptable if not possible.\n\n*Rename the files as per some regular expression like %TrackNo - %Artist - %Title. \n\n*Should be accurate, and more importantly smart. I want to start tagging at night, and hopefully my collection should be done by the morning, w/o it being stuck at a user prompt at 1%.\n\n\nIf one app cant do all, I am willing to use 3, wouldn't mind exposure to a few more apps ;)\nI have used picard or someting, and I didnt like it quite a lot. But wouldn't mind using it, if there is no other alternative. \nThanks for your time!\n\nA: Audio Tag Tool (tagtool)\nYou can also install tagtool. This will allow you to edit the ID3 tags of OGG and MP3 files using a nice GUI.\nWarning: Last update: 2013-04-24\n\n\nA: For\n\n\n*\n\n*automatic tagging, I recommend Musicbrainz Picard.\n\n*manual tag editing and robust pattern-based file renaming, I recommend Ex Falso.\n\n\nI can't recommend anything for you for album art, since I use the \"picture in the same folder\" method.\n\nA: EasyTAG\nYou can try EasyTAG, a nice graphical editor for tags in mp3 and aac files.\n\n\nA: Puddletag\nYou might be interested in using Puddletag. It has all the features you mentioned, as well as some more automated %Filename - %Artist - %Title customization.\n\nIncluded with puddletag are tag sources supporting lookups from Amazon, Discogs, FreeDB and MusicBrainz and AcoustID. There is also quite a number of features this application supports.\n\nA: Beets\nYou definitively want beets:\npip install beets\n\nconfig.yaml:\nplugins: fetchart\npaths:\n  default: $albumartist/$album%aunique{}/$track - $albumartist - $title\n\nbeet import <directory>\n\n... and let the magic happen.\nSee also the official getting started guide.\n\nA: Only today I discouvered MP3 Diags. It has a file renamer and a tag editor with Discogs and Musicbrainz support and can parse directory and filenames. Also, it fixes various low level issues.\n\nA: MusicBrainz Picard\ni just went over my entire collection 80gigs+, i did a lot of research and tried easytag, banshee, etc the only that really stands out for me was MusicBrainz Picard. \nIts very clever, backed up a by a huge database. The scanning functionality is what really impressed me, it plays the song and then makes an audio fingerprint of it. It then compares it to the database and populates all the metadata. neat\n\nA: i would recommend amarok or songbird . both are good..\n\nA: as for me. the only tagger I've used and worked nice is Mp3Tag using wine. Not slow and you can download album details from amazon.com or amazon.de mp3tag page also music brainz and it has a clean UI more focused on tagging. I recommend this than easy tag\n\nA: I usually use the zortam online mp3 tagger which can fetch cover arts and lyrics as well. For me it did the job, and it's very accurate. I use Fedora, but normally it should work on any OS if you have Java installed.\n\nA: Have you tried Winamp via Wine?

So I want to change the home folder to a folder on the ntfs partition. I could keep the personal configuration, software and so on after reinstalling the Ubuntu.\nSo I use ntfs-config to manage the disk partition, it's mounted when system is startup. And the permission of all files and directories are 777.\nThen I modified the /etc/passwd to set the home folder to the folder on the ntfs partition. I can successfully login the account, however it looks like the .bashrc and .profile are not loaded correctly. I can't use the input method(even can't configure ibus), no sound device. However everything works well after changing the home folder back to /home/.\nCould anybody give me a hint to make it work? Thanks.\n\nA: Instead of moving over my home directory, I removed the existing data folders and created links to them in their place.\nSo in detail what I did was to go to File System, find the directory named host (which in windows was my C:\\ in windows as it was where I was hosting ubuntu using Wubi). Then I went to user\\myusername\\ and created links for my Documents, Music, Pictures folders. I backed up all my data from home\\ into these folders. (For instance home\\Pictures\\* into host\\user\\myusername\\Pictures). I then deleted my home\\Pictures folder and then moved the link I created in host\\user\\myusername\\ into my home folder and renamed it to \"Picture\". The same applies to other folders.\n\nA: You would be better off not doing this if you want to ensure security. In older GDM versions (like what you would have found in 9.04) there was an easy option to ignore file permissions etc. However, GDM's (gui) options have changed a lot since then, and my suggestion is that you should avoid the risk. For example if your .Xauthority file gets the wrong permissions, you could be left unable to log in.\nAs other user pointed out, NTFS does not support some of the features that applications/service may need, like unix symbolic links, and then there is also the risk of fragmentation, which happens much more on NTFS than on ext file systems. For safety, stick with something like xfs, ext3/4, or even btrfs.\nEDIT: Another thing I took note of, you said you used wubi to install on an NTFS partition. This only works because it creates a virtual disk, but as I mentioned above, fragmentation can occur. If you put your /home folder on a partition under the control of windows there is a risk of corruption (I don't have links, but I have experience; I've done something similar before, and had to do a disk check every time windows accessed the drive. Little did I know that windows was messing things up slowly but surely).\n\nA: NTFS is not suitable for an home partition, there are certain type of file system objects (character devices, named pipes, etc) which are required for certain services but are not supported on NTFS. \n\nA: I'm currently storing the sub-folders of my home (e.g. ~/Documents, ~/Music) on an NTFS filesystem and it appears to be working fine a few months in.\nAs an example, here's how to host your ~/Documents in your Windows profile folders on an NTFS partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*First make sure you have the NTFS partition set to automount so it's accessible to the system each boot.\n\n*Move any files that might have accumulated in ~/Documents over to the NTFS partition (e.g. mv ~/Documents/* /mnt/winblows/Users/Username/Documents/).\n\n*Now delete the ~/Documents directory and create a link to that NTFS folder in its place named Documents (e.g. ln -s mnt/winblows/Users/Username/Documents Documents).\n\n\nNote: You might have to make ensure your ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs is in sync with the folder locations you've chosen (I did). See this answer for more details. Also, be careful to note the actual locations of your Windows user profile directories as these vary from version to version.\n\nA: A different approach is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leave your home folder mounted as it is,\n\n*Automatically mount the VFAT partition on e.g. /mnt/my-data\n\n*Move your standard Documents, Pictures, Videos, etc. folders to this VFAT partition.  Dragging and dropping these folders seems to work, but it may be necessary to edit your ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs.  Experiment.\n\n\nNow you have at least these files located on the VFAT partition shared with Microsoft Windows.  Microsoft Windows has similar folders, and I suppose you can redirect those this shared partition -- Sorry, I don't know how, but I'd like to know!\nI think that seems like a nice way of doing it.  All your Linux-specific files are still located in a Linux filesystem, and only your shared data is placed on a primitive VFAT filesystem where features like symlinks and permissions don't exist, but are probably not needed either.\n", "Q: How to get to the GRUB menu at boot-time? My system is not dual-boot, I run a standard Ubuntu desktop system \"on the metal\" (I think running it in a VM is the same).\nPressing c while booting does not cause the GRUB menu to appear (which I believe it does for a dual-boot system).\nHow can I get the GRUB-menu to present itself on a single-boot system?\n\nA: I have tried both the Shift and Space keys but nothing works. Only the Esc key works for Ubuntu 14.04  and 16.04 to get Grub Menu at boot time.\n\nA: For newer Ubuntu versions there is no GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT instead there is GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE which is set to hidden by default.\nOpen the file sudo nano /etc/default/grub\nChange value of GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE from hidden to menu and make sure GRUB_TIMEOUT is not set to 0 then run\nsudo update-grub\nDone!!!\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04, there is no GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 line in /etc/default/grub - instead there is GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden.  According to info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration' :\n\nif this option is unset or set to 'menu', then GRUB will display the menu and then   wait for the timeout set by 'GRUB_TIMEOUT' to expire before booting the default entry.  Pressing a key interrupts the timeout.\n\nSo if you either remove or comment out the line as:\n#GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden\n\nand run sudo update-grub, then the menu will show by default.\n18.04 + Not dual boot, boots in grub 5 seconds: \n\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=false\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=     (no value). Works fine LVM.\n\n\nA: Menu will appear if you press and hold Shift during loading Grub, if you boot using BIOS. When your system boots using UEFI, press Esc.\nFor permanent change you'll need to edit your /etc/default/grub file:\nPlace a # symbol at the start of line GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 to comment it out. If that line doesn't exist, then you can comment out this line instead: # GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden, and then change GRUB_TIMEOUT=0 to GRUB_TIMEOUT=5, for instance, to give the grub menu a 5 second timeout before it automatically logs you in.\nSave changes and run sudo update-grub to apply changes.\nDocumentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2\n\nA: I've heard Shift does it.\nBut I've used Space before and it worked.\n\nA: *\n\n*Keep hitting Shift until you see \"Grub Loading Message\"\n\n*After the message, hold the Shift down until the menu appears.\n\n\nA: By default, GRUB will show the menu if there is a second operating system installed.

Pressing a key interrupts the timeout.\nIf this option is set to countdown or hidden, then, before displaying the menu, GRUB will wait for the timeout set by GRUB_TIMEOUT to expire. If ESC is pressed during that time, it will display the menu and wait for input. If a hotkey associated with a menu entry is pressed, it will boot the associated menu entry immediately. If the timeout expires before either of these happens, it will boot the default entry. In the countdown case, it will show a one-line indication of the remaining time.\n\nA: For me, I found the issue was that I had left a USB stick plugged in to the computer. I suppose the computer was attempting to boot from the USB stick.\nOnce I had removed the USB stick, I could press shift or esc or space (depending on the version of Ubuntu you are using, I think).\n", "Q: How do I get AWN back? (Get into a terminal if all panels and docks are gone) I had installed and loved AWN, and had removed my last panel using these instructions. Everything was wonderful. However, apparently I was using an AWN package for Lucid - I'm on Maverick. After a recent run of the update manager, AWN was removed, and I now have no access to anything - can't get at any of my applications or folders. The only reason I'm able to even write this message is because I had installed the unity netbook packages to play with, so I restarted and booted into a netbook edition session.\nCan someone help me get my desktop edition back? Is there a keyboard shortcut I don't know about to run a terminal window? I assume if I could get into terminal, I could reverse the instructions about hiding the last panel, and once I have a panel I could add the applications menu back, and then from there try to find a version of AWN that works on Maverick.\nEDIT:\nJavier's answer below did get me back into the GUI with a panel that I was able to add the applications menu to. However, here's what I found. When I go into the software center to install AWN, it turns out I had previously installed it using a PPA that I found on launchpad, called PPA for AWN Testing Team (that's what shows up in the software center.) When I try to install AWN directly through the software center, it tells me I need to remove several packages that apparently got left behind (libawn1-trunk, python-awn-extras-trunk, and python-awn-trunk.) When I go into the PPA in the software center, I do see those packages, but clicking Remove doesn't actually do anything. It's like they're stuck. I tried to get into Synaptic to remove the packages from there, but when I try to run it from the applications menu, I get this error:\nFailed to run /usr/sbin/synaptic as user root.\n\nUnable to copy the user's Xauthorization file.\n\nHow can I get rid of those packages so I can reinstall AWN directly from the software center?\n\nA: You can usually use CTRL+ALT+T to open a new terminal, but I suspect that it wont work if gnome-panel is disabled.\nYou can use CTRL+ALT+F1 to move to a virtual terminal. You will nedd to log in, and then type this command.\nDISPLAY=:0 gnome-panel &\n\nAfterwards you should use CTL+ALT+F7 (sometimes it's F8) to get back to the GUI, the panel must be there. You should be able to restore your system now.\n\nA: Assuming you are using a gnome session, you can launch any application with: ALT-F2, from the run dialog type: \"software-center\" . AWN is available for maverick from the official repositories.\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+F1 will dump you in a proper terminal. You should be able to install things using sudo apt-get install xxx.\nYou might find aptitude a useful thing to have in a situation like this (sudo apt-get install aptitude if you don't have it already) as it'll let you search for packages in quite a nice little text-mode interface.\nIf you need to run a graphical application from a proper terminal (proper name: TTY) you might find you get errors about not being able to find the display. You can fix this by running export DISPLAY=:0. This would be handy for loading AWN without having to restart.\n\nA: The easiest way to sort it out would be to right click on your desktop and select Create Launcher... from the menu type gconf-editor in the command box and give it a name so that you can remember what its for. Hit the ok button click on the icon and go back though to the gnome/session/required_components and change panel back to gnome-panel. close restart login hey presto panels are back. It depends on how many users use the computer other than you but having a short cut to a terminal on the desktop can be a life saver if you are \"experimenting\".\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Remotely run a command on a ssh-server with a script I want to run a command on a ssh-server, but this command is determined by a script on my local machine. How do I do that?\nAn example for clarity:\nI want to write a script here (foo.sh) that takes an argument. If I run ./foo.sh 0 it should somehow send a shutdown signal to the server machine, but if I run ./foo.sh 1 it should send a restart signal.\nI know how to manually login via ssh, and I've already set ssh-keys to skip passwords, but I don't know how to automate the procedure with a script.\n\nA: As Oli commented, you can tell SSH to send commands. You could modify your script so that if your command line arg is 1 it sends ssh user@server \"shutdown -h now\". Keep in mind that you'll have to be superuser on the other machine to shut it down.\nEDIT:\nInstead of using root, as is suggested in the comments put user into the sudoers file as being able to shut down the machine without a password.\n\nA: You can pass a command (or list of commands, separated by ; or &&) to a SSH connection like this:\nssh user@server-address \"./foo 1\"\n\nIf you have a local script that outputs 0 or 1, you can simplify things further:\nssh user@server-address \"./foo $(/path/to/your/local/script)\"\n\nThe code in $(...) executes before anything else and its output is put into the line dynamically. It's called command substitution.\n\nA: You can use runoverssh:\nsudo apt install runoverssh\n\nrunoverssh -n -s localscript.sh user host\n\n-n will use SSH default authentication (your keys)\n-s runs a local script remotely\n", "Q: Dropbox instead of the documents folder? Hello\nI was wondering if it's possible to make Dropbox sync my ~/Documents folder? I'm on Ubuntu 10.10 netbook remix (Not that NBR should matter that much). I've read how to do this on Windows, and I was wondering if it's possible to do it on Ubuntu as well. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You could use symlinks, but you would have to do it the other way round (symlink your dropbox folder onto your documents folder). This would, to all intents and purposes make any files in your dropbox folder show up in your documents folder. The command to do this:\nsudo ln -s ~/Dropbox/* ~/Documents\nObviously replace any folder names as necessary.\n** EDIT **\nScratch that. This script: http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=9665 will allow you to rename / move your dropbox folder wherever you want. Its not yet possible (?) to have more than one folder synced to dropbox (although it is through ubuntu one)\n** EDIT 2 **\nOr just switch the symlink around so it works the other way. See this:\nhttp://wiki.dropbox.com/TipsAndTricks/SyncOtherFolders\n\nA: All I do is :\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a \"Documents\" folder inside Dropbox (which, when I install it, I tell it to use ~/Misc/Dropbox).\n\n*Delete my actual ~/Documents folder (copy anything out of it first).\n\n*Then drag-n-drop my newly created ~/Misc/Dropbox/Documents folder to the root of my home folder with CTRL and SHIFT held down.  That symlinks it.\n\n*Repeat for any other folders I want synced.  I usually do my Development folder and my Desktop.\n\n\nWhenever I use my Documents folder now, I know that it's getting quietly synced to Dropbox.\n\nThis method is particularly useful if you use two or more PCs and know that you'll get all those files no matter which PC you're sitting at, even those you dragged to the Desktop.\nUpdate : As Geppettvs D'Constanzo notes in his answer, Ubuntu Tweak will allow you (after following the steps in this answer) to tell Nautilus to use the default locations for your Desktop and Home folders, so you don't lose the icons after all.\n\nA: I don't know what version of Dropbox are you guys talking about. From Dropbox v0.7.110 there is an option which allows you to choose which folder location is going to be used for the sync process.\nAdditionally, folder locations can be handled via Ubuntu Tweak with ease. And you can change the location of your Documents folder (in example) to a different place in your file system or in a different hard disk drive indeed.\nSorry if my answer is too late.\nEdited to include the Ubuntu Tweak Screenshot:\n\n\nA: Some times ln -s can't be used. so you can add to the /etc/fstab next line:\n/New-Dropbox-Folder  /home/username/Dropbox none defaults,bind      0       0\n\nChange /New-Dropbox-Folder with your needs.\n", "Q: How to create VMWare Player Image with linux as the OS How can I create an image (.iso) that contains:\n  1.

I noticed the time is about 7 hours off, If I fix it, restart the time will be off again, anyway to permanently fix the time on the USB Flash Drive?\n\nA: The trouble is probably one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*you use two operating systems, one of which is configured to the internal clock to UTC and the other to your local time zone; or\n\n*you use two operating systems with differring time zones set.\n\n\nIn either case, the alternate operating systems would try to fix the time, perhaps using NTP. The solution would be to settle on one of the two, UTC or local time zone. Of course it would also require that your USB live linux has support for persistant settings, as Saifallah indicated. More information on time management is available here.\n\nA: I guess you could use the \"Startup Disk Creator\" which is installed by default in Ubuntu & enable the option that preserves settings. \n", "Q: My system time resets to January 2007. How can I solve this? I am facing a weird problem that my system clocks resets to jan 1 2007 to 0:00. Can anybody help me to rectify it? \nThe bios show the same time. What should I do?\n\nA: Maybe you should try changing your motherboard's battery.\nIt's a possible cause.\n\nA: When your computer is switched off, the time is usually kept ticking over by a battery-powered system,which normally operates independently of the OS.There might be a problem with your machine's BIOS settings or its CMOS battery.\nNOTE:\nYou can also test the battery with a multimeter.You should get right around 3.3v.Most BIOS have a Vbat sensor.Anything under 3.0v means the battery is dying.Better to take the battery out and replace it with a new one.\n\nA: you should change cmos battery\n\nA: check the cmos battery i have had the same problem with older computers \n", "Q: Wrong Compiler Error in Code Blocks I am currently using code blocks 10.05 as a C++ compiler but I am facing a problem during building of source code (compiling) . \nIt displays an error that - debug program uses a wrong compiler, skipping...\nI am using a GNU compiler from console application menu .

I verified windows 7 is working upon booting into it.\nI am kind of lost.\n\nA: So here was the solution.  In the BIOS when the PC boots up you press F2.  Find the section that has USB Emulation and make sure it is disabled. Not sure what this is doing but I turned it off and it would boot to the standard install fine.\nI came across another issue after the install completed though.  I would get to the login screen, then login, and hear the standard ubuntu login, but all I could see was the mouse and nothing else appeared on the screen.  I've had a simliar issue before with the free & open video driver not working, so what I had to do was press ctrl+alt+F1, this will bring you to a console shell where you can login from there.  You will get a terminal once logged in.  From there you have to do:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati\n\nThis should install the latest ATI drivers from the net.  Once they are finished installing then just do a:\nsudo reboot\n\nThis should start the reboot of your machine, this time try and login again and hopefully it will work.\nNote, from the comment below: I have found that after ubuntu is installed and everything is running fine, if I turn on USB emulation for some reason Ubuntu can't boot.

They are on the same network, connected by the same router. Upstairs is running Kubuntu (12.04) whereas Downstairs is running bogstandard Ubuntu (13.04, with KDE desktop). I prefer to work on Downstairs but often need to access my files on Upstairs, which my partner may be using at the time.\nI shared some Upstairs directories using Samba first of all and this was a nightmare. First of all it didn't work recursively (I had to mark every directory and sub-directory) I wanted to share). Secondly, although Downstairs could see Upstairs on the network,  when I clicked into the shared directories I kept being prompted for a password, and although I was entering it correctly the password was not recognized so I couldn't get in. I am tempted to forget Samba altogether but first let's see how it gets on with making my Upstairs music files available to my excellent internet radio.\nNext I tried nfs as suggested by the user jet. Following the instructions suggested by the link, this worked perfectly the first time. Unfortunately when I tried again the following day after both computers had been rebooted, I kept getting mount.nfs: Access Denied... messages. This problem is well documented in the forums but the multifarious proposed solutions are beyond my level of technical ability.\n\nThis was my solution. Install ssh on the host (server) computer (or both), as suggested by aneeshep:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server openssh-client\n\nNow on the client computer (or both) install a package called sshfs:\nsudo apt-get install sshfs\n\nUsing your preferred file manager on Downstairs, check that Upstairs is on the network. If so, make a directory on Downstairs where you will mount the Upstairs file system.

You probably at least list the files there every time, perhaps so much that your hands automatically type 'ls' after every 'cd'.\nWell, by trying every way I could think of, it turns out there's only one way to properly accomplish the goal we're seeking. We have to create a shell function.\nShell functions are part of shell programming. Like in compiled programming languages, functions provide a sort of procedural modularizability. One can create a generic function to perform an often-used bit of logic or computation with different parameters. In this case, the parameter is the current working directory.\nHere's a simple one:\nfunction cs () {\n    cd $1\n    ls\n}\n\n\nAs @geirha corretly notes, the above function will fail if you try to switch to a directory with a space in its name:  \n$ cs A\\ B/\n-bash: cd: A: No such file or directory\n<current directory listing>  \n\nYou should instead use the following function:  \nfunction cs () {\n    cd \"$@\" && ls\n    }\n\nOnce you add that code to your ~/.bashrc, you should be able to do this: \nhello@world:~$ cs Documents/\nexample.pdf tunafish.odt\nhello@world:~/Documents$\n\n\nA: You can use the builtin command in bash :\nfunction cd() {\n    new_directory=\"$*\";\n    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then \n        new_directory=${HOME};\n    fi;\n    builtin cd \"${new_directory}\" && ls\n}\n\n\nA: Use a function instead of an alias:\ncs() { cd \"$1\" && ls; }\n\n\nA: As an expansion to this function: cs() { cd \"$1\" && ls; }, you may want to pass all of the function's arguments to cd by using $@ instead of \"$1\" as such: cs() { cd $@ && ls; }.\n\nA: I had problems redefining cd because rvm changes my cd definition too. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/19941991/1601989.

Once it offers to go into console, do so and run apt-get install nvidia-current. You can then create a new USB with the ISO it produces (usually located in your home directory).

First, read this article. Second, are there plans to build support for this format into Ubuntu? For example, print to file support, support from Evince, etc.\n\nIt acts exactly like a\n  PDF, but you can't print it out.\n  \"Decide for yourself which of your\n  documents don't need printing -- and\n  save them as WWF,\" the wildlife\n  organisation suggests. – Wired\n\n\nA: No.⁽¹⁾\n\nA: Whilst I am unable to find any example documents to test my theory with, the website says:\n\nWWF documents can be opened with most programs that can open PDFs\n\nI suspect that ultimately Evince (the default PDF reader in Ubuntu) can already read these files. If you can get your hands on a .wff, try renaming it to .pdf, or right click and try Open With \"Document Viewer\".\nSupport for the format would probably be fairly easy to implement in Evince, but I can't see anyone having much desire to do to. Two reasons for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preventing people from printing is the sort of arbitrary restriction that is generally opposed in the Ubuntu and free software community. The PDF file format was intended not to be editable, but we now have tools to edit them...\n\n*The entire file format / campaign appears for the most part gimicky, and most of us are incredibly unlikely to actually encounter such a file.\n\n\nWhat is not that unlikely to emerge is \"support\" for opening these files, but no restrictions on printing.... which kinda defeats the point.\n\nA: If someone made plans to write code which precludes your ability to do what you choose with data under Linux, someone else would write code that liberates said data. So the question is somewhat moot.\nThis seems more like a publicity ploy by the creators than anything that could possibly catch on as in:\n\nI'm going to send you a document which prevents you from printing it, unless you don't have a Mac running special WWF software in which case you might not be able to read it at all. Okay?\n\nThis scenario rests on the assumption that the document sender is intending to communicate something other than \"I should like to control your actions because it will make you a better person\" which is both rude and self defeating.

Why?\nIt doesn't seem very helpful that I'm the only one with permission to read the report. Do I need to now track down someone else to look through it?\n\nA: Apport decided that the attachments/logs/etc you submitted automatically in that bug report may contain information that compromises your privacy.\nIn time (usually within a few hours, certainly with a few days) then an automatic process will look through your bug report attachments, \"retrace\" them (which I believe both helps the developers find useful information, but also can remove personal information) and finally marks the bug as public.\n\nA: To expand on 8128's answer, which is mostly right, the automated retracer does not set the bug public. It merely adds a stack trace to the bug so that it is more clear where the problem lies.\nThe sensitive information is kept in the bug report, as it can be invaluable to a developer working on a fix. The bug is reviwed by members of the ubuntu-bugcontrol team who will evaluate the bug and either keep the bug private, and assign specific developers, or remove the sensitive information if it is not helpful to solving the issue, and then mark it as public.\n", "Q: Why does ubuntu use about twice as much RAM as debian?

Ubuntu + LXDE with Firefox and OpenOffice running uses much more RAM. Why is that?\n\nA: I'm not sure if it's really twice as much, but it's all about settings and running application/services -- Ubuntu is more \"user friendly\" and that also means more applications, tools etc.\nFor example: Compiz is default in Ubuntu (app. + 35MB), UbuntuOne (app. + 20MB), indicator applets in the panel, accessibility...\nYou can go to System→Administration→System Monitor to find applications that are using more RAM.\n\nA: You can't compare \"Ubuntu\" vs \"Debian\" RAM usage ; for both, a base install uses a different set of services/applications with different RAM requirements.\nAlso please make sure you read http://www.linuxatemyram.com/, most people have the wrong understanding of Linux memory usage.\n\nA: If you're that low on RAM, either get more RAM or switch to a less-RAM-hungry distro (I recommend LMDE if you want to use GNOME too).

The one from the repos works great, but it's fairly outdated from what I understand. Are there any charitable devs out there that want to contribute a deb or PPA for those of us who would like to try it out? \n\nA: There doesn't appear to be a PPA of git snapshots for 10.10, unfortunately.

Your friend is to generate his key and send you his id_rsa.pub. His private key is only for him. That's what makes it private. Once anyone but you has access to your private key it's compromised and you need to generate a new pair.\nYour friend can create his key pair in windows with puttygen.exe.

The advantage of this compared to \\b is that you don't have to match number of \\b with the amount of characters you want to delete, and compared to \\r there won't be characters sticking out on the screen if the new line is shorter than the old one. \nBelow is the example of how it can be applied to this question, and here is an example of the related application to create output similar to boot messages. In this particular example, the timer will be gone once 0th second is reached and the timer line will be replaced with \"Ready!\" phrase.\n#!/bin/bash\nsek=60\necho \"60 Seconds\"\n\nwhile ((sek--)); do\n    printf \"One moment please: %d\" \"$sek\"\n    sleep 1\n    printf \"\\r%b\" \"\\033[2K\"\ndone\necho \"Ready!\"\n\n\nAnother alternative would be to employ dialog command for creating simple dialogs in command-line. The dialog will remain on screen for the duration of the timer and update with the loop, and by the time it's done - the timer will be replaced with \"Ready! Press  to exit\" message in a seamless manner:\n#!/bin/bash\nsek=60\necho \"60 Seconds\"\n\nwhile ((sek--)); do\n    echo \"$sek\" | dialog --progressbox \"Please wait\" 10 25\n    sleep 1\ndone\ndialog --msgbox \"Ready!

For instance I run docky and usually it pops up with a notification after login saying that compiz is not enabled and some of the functions wont be enabled however by the time it actually appears compiz has had time to start and docky is fine. Docky has the ability to fall back to a more basic form if compiz hasn't started yet. However AWN (avant window navigator) doesn't do this and will just not load if compiz isn't present even if it manages to get it lazy butt in gear at a later \"date\". Although all my ramblings are about visual gui elements the theory should apply to service programs as well. One possible solution is a script to check for the successful running of the smbd service and if its not running attempt to start it again.\nHope this helps or at least gives you an idea.     \n\nA: If indeed it is a timing issue, it probably means something (I'm guessing a network service) which is required pre smbd startup isn't happening in time.  The fact you can start it no problem after startup means you can probably just set it at a really low startup priority (i.e right at the end as it doesn't appear to be a dependency of any other service).\nYou do this by using the update-rc.d script.\nFor a bit of background, checkout /etc/rc2.d (or any of /etc/rc2.d through /etc/rc5.d) which are the services that are set to automatically start when the system enters run level 2 - 5 (for this exercise let's assume theyre the same). You'll probably notice that there's a S20smbd which means auto start smbd (links to startup script /etc/init.d/smbd) with a priority of 20, where things with a low priority are started first until everything in the run level directory has been processed.\nTypically a user level startup would use a low priority (starts last) of 99, so from the update-rc.d docs, we'll use 98:\n\n\n*\n\n*update-rc.d smbd defaults 98 02\nThis simply means update the auto start for smbd for default run levels (2-5) to priority 98, so its pretty much going to be the last thing that starts (dependant on how your system is set up). \n\nA: There's a further problem on Ubuntu 11.04 (natty, amd64).\nFrom the bootlog:\nRather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use the service(8)\nutility, e.g. service S20smbd start\nSince the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an\nUpstart job, you may also use the start(8) utility, e.g. start S20smbd\nstart: Unknown job: S20smbd\nSo, it seems smbd tries to be started as \"S20smbd\", thus it's not recognized by \"service\". Again, restarting smbd once the system is up fixes it.\nI cannot figure out where the problem is in the upstart scripts. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.\n\nA: I was having the same problem.  I figured out the solution while reading a howto on installing sendmail on my company server.\nInstall the packages sysv-rc-conf and sysvinit-utils by typing the following in a terminal.\nsudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf sysvinit-utils\n\nThen you type this to configure your system (Ubuntu 10.04) to load nmbd on boot:\nsudo sysv-rc-conf nmbd on\n\n\nA: I think this issue is due to a race between dhclient, which brings up the network interface asynchronously, and other services which need the network interface.\nI've had Samba sporadically not starting on my Debian system for a long time, and now essentially the same happened with mysqld (needed by the MythTV back end), which finally motivated me to dig deeper into it.\nIf the DHCPACK arrives in time and dhclient brings up the interface before Samba / mysql start up everything is OK, otherwise the services fail to start:\nmysqld: 120520 11:38:02 [ERROR] Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port: Cannot assign requested address\n\nMay 20 12:50:38 piano smbd[1763]:   WARNING: no network interfaces found \n\nI've fixed it by the ugly hack of adding a 15 second delay after the start of network-manager in its init script, and moving the two init scripts after network-manager in the boot order.\nA better way would be to add a proper dependency for the network interface, but that doesn't seem to be possible with sysvinit.\nI considered other solutions too risky (e.g. using upstart).\n", "Q: Why is it bad to log in as root? I've often come across posts on forums or other websites where you see people joking in such a manner about running/logging in as root as if it's something awful and everyone ought to know about it. However, there isn't much that a search reveals on the matter. \nIt may be widely known to Linux experts, but I really don't know why. I remember always running as root when I first tried Linux years ago (Redhat and Mandrake) and don't remember running into any problems because of that. \nThere are actually some distros that have a bright red background with alert signs all over it as wallpaper for the root user (SuSe?). I still use the \"Administrator\" account for regular use on my Windows installation and haven't ever run into any problems there either.\n\nA: Just one word: security.\n\n\n*\n\n*You're logged as root = all applications are running with root privilegies -- every vulnerability in Firefox, Flash, OpenOffice etc. now can destroy your system, because possible viruses now have access everywhere. Yes, there are only few viruses for Ubuntu/Linux, but it's also because of good security and default unprivileged user.\n\n*It's not only about viruses -- small bug in an application could erase some system files or...\n\n*When your're logged as root, you can do everything -- the system won't ask! Do you want to format this disk? Ok, just one click and it's done, because you're root and you know what you're doing...\n\n\nA: rm /*\n\nLets say you have been cleaning out an administrative area. You get tired of password, so you sudo su.  You get distracted just for second and forget you cd to /.  Then you rm *.  I've done it.  You can get it all back, but it's a PITA. Oh, and it's descended into /media too!\n\nA: Why not have root login?\nWhile you can create a password for the superuser account allowing you to log in as root, it's worth mentioning that this isn't the \"Ubuntu\" way of doing things.  Ubuntu have specifically chosen not to give a root login and password by default for a reason.  Instead, a default Ubuntu install will use sudo.\nSudo is an alternative to giving people a root password in order to perform superuser duties.  In a default Ubuntu install the person who installed the OS is given \"sudo\" permission by default.\nAnybody with \"sudo\" permission may perform something \"as a superuser\" by pre-pending sudo to their command.  For instance, to run apt-get dist-upgrade as a superuser, you could use:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nBenefits of the sudo approach\n\n*\n\n*With sudo, you choose in advance which users have sudo access. There is no need for them to remember a root password, as they use their own password.\n\n\n*If you have multiple users, you can revoke one's superuser access just by removing their sudo permission, without needing to change the root password and notify everyone of a new password.\n\n\n*You can even choose which commands a user is allowed to perform using sudo and which commands are forbidden for that user.\n\n\n*And lastly, if there is a security breach it can in some cases leave a better audit trail showing which user account was compromised.\nSudo makes it easier to perform a single command with superuser privileges.  With a root login, you permanently remain in a superuser shell which must be exited using exit or logout.  This can lead to people staying in the superuser shell for longer than necessary just because it's more convenient than logging out and in again later.\nWith sudo, you still have the option of opening a permanent (interactive) superuser shell with the command:\nsudo su\n\n... and this can still be done without any root password, because sudo gives superuser privileges to the su command.\nAnd similarly, instead of su - for a login shell you can use sudo su - or even sudo -i.\nHowever when doing so you just need to be aware that you are acting as a superuser for every command.  It's a good security principle not to stay as a superuser for longer than necessary, just to lessen the possibility of accidentally causing some damage to the system (without it, you can only damage files your user owns).\nJust to clarify, you can, if you choose, give the root user a password allowing logins as root, if you specifically want to do things this way instead.  I just wanted to let you know about the Ubuntu convention of preferring sudo instead and try and explain some of the reasoning why Ubuntu favors that approach as a default.\nWhy not allow root login over SSH?\nEven if your root user does have a password enabling you to log in as root, it is still a good security practice to disable direct root login from outside, such as in SSH.  It is reasonable for users to have to su - or sudo after the initial login.\nThe potential benefits to this are mostly security-related:\n\n*\n\n*It reduces the attack vector by removing the possibility of brute-forcing the root password remotely.  It is typical for a server on the internet to be constantly barraged by attempts to brute-force the root password via SSH.\n\n\n*It creates a better audit trail so that even in the event of a breach where the attacker does obtain superuser privileges later, you can see whose user account was used to gain access.\n\nA: When logged in as root it makes it possible for  applications, scripts or commandline commands to access sensitive parts of software which can damage the system. This can be the result of inexperience on the user or programmer's part or due to malicous hidden code.\n\nA: Running as root is bad because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stupidity: Nothing prevents you from doing something stupid.  If you try to change the system in anyway that could be harmful you need to do sudo which pretty much guarantees a pause while you are entering the password for you to realize that you are about to make a possible big/costly change.\n\n*Security:  It has been mentioned already quite a few times in this question but basically it's the same thing, harder to hack if you dont know the admin user's login account.  root means you already have one half of the working set of admin credentials.\n\n*You don't really need it: If you need to run several commands as root and you are annoyed by having to enter your password several times when sudo has expired all you need to do is sudo -i and you are now root.  Want to run some commands using pipes?  Then use sudo sh -c \"comand1 | command2\".\n\n*You can always use it in the recovery console:  The recovery console allows you to try and recover from doing something stupid or fixing a problem caused by an app (which you still had to run as sudo :)) Ubuntu doesn't have a password for the root account in this case but you can search online for changing that, this will make it harder for anyone that has physical access to your box to be able to do harm.\n\n\nThe reason why you couldn't find information about why it's bad is because, well, there is way too much data in the internet :) and that a lot of people that have been using Linux for a long time think like you do.  This way of thinking about the root account is fairly new (a decade maybe?) and a lot of people still get annoyed by having to use sudo.  Especially if they are working on a server which means they went in with the intention to make system changes.  Probably brought on from previous bad experiences and security standards most sysadmins know better but they still don't like it :).\n\nA: It's just too easy mess up when operating as root.  You can clobber the entire system in like one command ... \n\nA: I can add that there is a difference between Administrator in Windows and root in Unix. Administrator still have some restrictions in systems, where root does not have any restriction. The correct analog of root in Windows is System user.\nThe bad thing to use PC under root/System is that you can accidentally destroy anything without any warning from OS.\n\nA: This is a good question. I think the answer is slightly different depending on whether you're talking about a server or a desktop installation.\nOn a desktop, it is uncommon to use the root account. In fact, Ubuntu ships with root access disabled. All changes requiring superuser privileges are done through sudo and its graphical cognates gksudo and kdesudo. Given that it's easy to set a root password, however, why don't people do it?\nOne reason is that it gives you an additional layer of security. If you run a program as root and a security flaw is exploited, the attacker has access to all data and can directly control the hardware. For example, it might install a trojan or key-logger into your kernel. In practice, though, an attack can do a large amount of damage even without superuser privileges. After all, all user data - including documents and stored passwords - is accessible without root access.\nA more valid point, on a single-user system, is that the user is prevented from accidentally rendering the system unusable. If the user unintentionally issues a command that deletes all files, they will still be able to boot the system, even if the data is lost.\nAdditionally, most user-facing (X11) applications today are built on the assumption that they're run as a regular user account and without administrator rights. Thus some programs might misbehave when run as root.\nOn a multi-user system with non-graphical shell access only, many of these reasons do not apply. However, Ubuntu still reasonably defaults to an inaccessible root account. For one thing, there is a real difference between gaining access to a user account (with sudo rights) through a security hole and gaining access to root, as in the first case disrupting other users will require running sudo and will still prompt for the account password as an additional security step. For another, it is useful to perform many administrative tasks from a user account and only invoking sudo when the superuser privileges are absolutely required. Thus when installing a program from source, it is advisable to build the source - running configure and make - inside the user's directory and only using sudo make install in the final step. Again this makes it more difficult to shoot oneself (and other users of the multi-user system) in the foot, and it decreases the likelihood of build scripts wreaking havoc with the system. Thus even on a server it is good advice to stick to Ubuntu's sudo-based administration.\n\nA: One reason not to run as root that has not (so far) been identified by other answers is traceability.  It probably matters less on machines that are primarily single-user machines (your desktop or laptop), but on server machines, if someone is logged in as root, you don't know who to blame for the actions taken.  Therefore, most professional organizations with multiple systems and multiple administrators that need root privileges require people to login using their own user ID (and password), and then use sudo or similar programs to operate with root privileges when necessary.\nOtherwise, the primary reasons for not running as root are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Minimize risk of damage from accidents.  If you run rm -fr / home/me/my-subdir as root, then you've just dramatically eliminated everything of importance from your machine because of that space after the (first) slash - because the stuff that goes first is the stuff that was added first - little things like the kernel, the /bin and the /etc directory.  Unix gets upset if you lose those.\n\n*Minimize risk of damage from malicious outside sites.  If you browse as root, you're more nearly vulnerable to drive-by downloads of malicious material.\nI use MacOS X more than I do Ubuntu, but there, root is disabled by default, and it still is on my machine.  I routinely upgrade the kernel and other similar operations - using sudo (behind the scenes).  Similar techniques apply to Linux generally.\nBasically, you should only use the all-powerful privileges of root for abbreviated periods of work to avoid the risk of mistakes.\n\nA: If applications are run as root, there is no guarantee that none of them would execute\nrm -rf /\n\n(This is an example of a command that should not be run.)\n\nA: Reasons against using root:\n\n\n*\n\n*Could accidentally destroy system files\n\n*Could get an infection\n\n*Doesn't log actions\n\n\nReasons FOR using root:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access to everything, no typing passwords\n\n*GUI, no using terminals for managing system files/directories\n\n\nSeems to me that a non-root account could still fall victim of those reasons against using root, the most it adds is a confirmation for your actions. I think that as long as you know what you're doing, you're perfectly safe using root. There, I said it.\n\nA: Given a knowledgeable and careful user, I'm not sure that a right answer exists. I hadn't seen this answer, so I thought I'd chime in.\nWhat I don't like is unintentional changes of permissions on multi-user systems that I need to chmod later.  Fixing via chmod after-the-fact is much more irritating than needing sudo, but it depends on what I have planned.\n\nA: There is no danger in logging as root if used carefully.\nAlthough I think that disabling root is preferable solution,\nbecause attacker could not brute force it.\nOne solution is to create user in sudo group with obscure name, like gamer and use sudo to perform administrative tasks.\nHence attacker must not only guess password of that administrative user but his login name too. Which is not obvious if user using sudo has login name like kitty or gamer or something similar.\n\nA: TL;DR: Do things as root only when you have to. sudo makes this pretty easy. If you enable root logins, you can still follow this rule, you just have to be careful to do so. Although enabling root logins is not actually insecure if done right, you don't need to enable root logins because you have sudo.\nThere are really two related questions here.\n\n*\n\n*Why is it bad to to log in as root for one's everyday computer use (web browsing, email, word processing, gaming, etc.)?\n\n*Why does Ubuntu default to disabling root logins altogether and using sudo and polkit to enable administrators to run specific commands as root?\n\nWhy not run everything as root, all the time?\nMost of the other answers cover this. It comes down to:\n\n*\n\n*If you use root powers for tasks that don't require them, and you end up doing something you didn't mean to do, you could change or harm your system in a way you don't want.\n\n*If you run a program as root when you didn't need to, and it ends up doing something you didn't mean for it to do--for example, due to a security vulnerability or other bug--it could change or harm your system in a way you don't want.\n\nIt's true that even without doing things as root, you can cause harm. For example, you can delete all the files in your own home directory, which usually includes all your documents, without running as root! (Hopefully you have backups.)\nOf course, as root, there are additional ways to accidentally destroy those same data. For example, you could specify the wrong of= argument to a dd command and write raw data over your files (which makes them way, way harder to recover than if you'd merely deleted them).\nIf you're the only person who uses your computer, the harm you can do only as root might not really be higher than the harm you can do with your regular user privileges. But that is still no reason to expand your risk to include additional ways of messing up your Ubuntu system.\nIf running with a non-root user account prevented you from exercising control over your own computer, then this would of course be a bad tradeoff. But it doesn't--anytime you actually wish to perform an action as root, you can do so with sudo and other methods.\nWhy not make it possible to log in as root?\nThe idea that the ability to log in as root is inherently insecure is a myth. Some systems have a root account enabled by default; other systems use sudo by default, and some are configured with both.\n\n*\n\n*For example, OpenBSD, which is widely and reasonably considered the most secure general-purpose OS in the world, ships with the root account enabled for local, password-based login.\n\n*Other well-respected OSes that do this include RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora.\n\n*Debian (from which Ubuntu derives) has the user decide which approach will be configured, during system installation.\n\nIt's not objectively wrong to have a system where the root account is enabled, provided that\n\n*\n\n*you still only use it when you really need to, and\n\n*you restrict access to it appropriately.\n\nOften novices ask how to enable the root account in Ubuntu. We should not conceal this information from them, but usually when people ask this it's because they are under the mistaken impression that they need to enable the root account. In fact, this is almost never necessary, so when answering such questions it's important we explain that. Enabling the root account also makes it easy to become complacent and perform actions as root that don't require root privileges. But this doesn't mean enabling the root account is by itself insecure.\nsudo encourages and helps users run commands as root only when they need to. To run a command as root, type sudo, a space, and then the command. This is very convenient, and many users of all skill levels prefer this approach.\nIn short, you don't need to enable root logins because you have sudo. But so long as you use it only for administrative tasks that require it, it's about equally secure to enable and log on as root, so long as it's only in these ways:\n\n*\n\n*Locally, from a non-graphical virtual console.\n\n*With the su command, when logged in from another account.\n\nHowever, substantial added security risks arise if you log on as root in these ways:\n\n*\n\n*Graphically. When you log in graphically, a whole lot of stuff runs to provide the graphical interface, and you'll end up running even more applications as root to use that interface for anything. This goes against the principle of only running programs as root that really need root privileges. Some of these programs may contain bugs, including security bugs.\nFurthermore, there's a non-security reason to avoid this. Logging in graphically as root is not well supported--as loevborg mentions, developers of desktop environments and of graphical apps don't often test them as root. Even if they do, logging in to a graphical desktop environment as root doesn't get real world alpha and beta testing by users, as almost nobody attempts it (for the security reasons explained above).\nIf you need to run a specific graphical application as root, you can use gksudo or sudo -H. This runs far fewer programs as root than if you actually logged on graphically with the root account.\n\n\n*Remotely. The root account can in effect do anything, and it has the same name on practically every Unix-like system. By logging in as root via ssh or other remote mechanisms, or even by configuring remote services to allow it, you make it much easier for intruders, including automated scripts and malware running on botnets, to gain access through brute force, dictionary attacks (and possibly some security bugs).\nArguably the risk is not extremely high if you allow only key-based, and not password-based root logins.\nBy default in Ubuntu, neither graphical root logins nor remote logins via SSH are enabled, even if you enable logging in as root. That is, even if you enable root login, it's still only enabled in ways that are reasonably secure.\n\n*\n\n*If you run an ssh server on Ubuntu and have not changed /etc/sshd/ssh_config, it will contain the line PermitRootLogin without-password. This disables password-based root login, but allows key-based login. However, no key is configured by default, so unless you've set one up, that too will not work. Furthermore, key-based remote root login is far less bad than password-based remote root login, in part because it doesn't create the risk of brute force and dictionary attacks.\n\n*Even though the defaults should protect you, I think it's still a good idea to check your ssh configuration, if you're going to enable the root account. And if you're running other services that provide remote login, like ftp, you should check them, too.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n*\n\n*Do stuff as root only when you need to; sudo helps you do that, while still giving you the full power of root anytime you want it.\n\n*If you understand how root works and the dangers of overusing it, enabling the root account is not really problematic from a security perspective.\n\n*But if you understand that, you also know that you almost certainly don't need to enable the root account.\n\nFor more information about root and sudo, including some additional benefits of sudo that I haven't covered here, I highly recommend RootSudo in the Ubuntu help wiki.\n\nA: Software is based on shared libraries, dependencies, configuration files, etc.\nMost of the times, a single click in an application invokes a \"chain reaction\" of multiple changes, not only where you think it would probably.\nWhen these changes are about to affect system-critical settings, it's good for you - as a user - to know.\nThat's why root access is a good security model:\nIf something crucial is about to happen to your system, you'll be notified by being asked for privilege elevation.\n\nA: It's a two-faced problem with more than one answer.\nFor some reality check on the ever-same-but-oh-so-awful answers to this:\ndesktop installations: \n\n\n*\n\n*use your own user and sudo if need be, otherwise one successfully used attack vector because you don't really know what you're doing and your system is compromised\n\n*in larger companies chances are, you might not even have root privileges on your own workstation, even if you're an admin, depending on the amount of tin-foil hats being present.\n\n\nserver installations: \n\n\n*\n\n*there is a vast difference between doing your short work sessions legit as root (provided you have passwordless logins, proper ssh key management for all servers - and fail2ban configured for all password logins while you're at it anyway) and having every daemon/service running with its own user (which is a must) - most people seem to not realize the difference\n\n*for fun: try using your version-controlled configuration management tools (ansible/puppet/salt/whatever with files from a git server) only without root access. (you do have some form of AAA in place for these special systems, as well as for your monitoring and backup systems, don't you?)\n\n*also: default rm -rf / doesnt work in most mainstream distros IIRC\n\n*any serious workplace has a jumphost/bastion-host for accessing the server fleet which logs anything you do anyway, which likely is further protected by 2FA\n\n*if you have sudo and no jumphost you can fix up the hosts logs to end up however you want them to anyway, if they are not mirrored in realtime, that is. \n\n*when also the ssh logs are 'cleaned', you can't even be proved to have been on the host, if there is no further network monitoring system in place\n\n\nFor any company size (read: most likely SOHO with a static ip) in between these two extremes that lacks decent monitoring/backup/automation/logging measures, it may be useful to enforce usage of sudo on servers. (Which gets circumvented by people doing sudo su - ASAP after connecting, letting all your intentions of logging what happened go to waste even without malicious intents as soon as more than one root user is logged in. Good luck changing this through forced procedures and treatening people with draconian measures for failing to obey the rules. Life always finds a way.)\nBut if you dont have at least fail2ban to secure your password logins (if there are any present, especially on internet facing systems), plus do mind about proper password handling (password management tools, retention policies, no master passwords, handling these upon employee fluctuations...) and have some form of proper update management for the server fleet in place so all the servers are patched regularily, you likely will be hacked some day anyway, be it from within or from the outside. \nAnd always having used sudo religiously and having enforced its usage among all people will not change your probability for getting owned much in that case.\n\nA: It defeats the security model that's been in place for years. Applications are meant to be run with non-administrative security (or as mere mortals) so you have to elevate their privileges to modify the underlying system. For example, you wouldn't want that recent crash of Rhythmbox to wipe out your entire /usr directory due to a bug. Or that vulnerability that was just posted in ProFTPD to allow an attacker to gain a ROOT shell. \nIt's just good practice on any operating system to run your applications on a user level and leave administrative tasks to the root user, and only on a per-need basis. \n\nA: Root account is disabled by default - meaning that it exists but it's not usable (except in recovery mode). This means that an attacker is aware of your root account, but couldn't use it even if he/she had the root password. Thus, an attacker has to guess both a user-name which has administrator privileges, AND that user's password (which is far more difficult than just trying to work out the root password).In XP if you have the Recovery Console installed, anyone who has physical access to your box can boot into it (RC) - no password required. Same as Recovery Mode in Ubuntu.\nIn Ubuntu, when they say that the root is disabled - what is really meant is that the account is locked. An account is locked by changing the password to a value which matches no possible encrypted value. This effectively prevents anybody from being able to log in as root - since there would be no possible way they could enter the password. Since there are still times when root access is necessary - the Ubuntu kernel has been modified to allow root local login only in single-user mode.\nAlso see this page\n\nA: Its like arming a little kid with an AK47, while he can happily play with his paintball gun. ;)\nI mean its wrong because you and your applications will have more privilege then they need and that is when things can and sometimes will go wrong :(\n\nA: Very nice question... Let me answer it from a practical point of view:\nWhen I started using Linux, which is more than 10 years ago, the major distributions did not advertise using non-root accounts as much as today. As I was used to Windows I also did not see a point in using a constrained user account. In particular because I had to enter \"su\" very often - sudo wasn't that popular back then. ;-) So I always logged in as root because I had a lot of maintenance to do to get my system well configured. But guess what, any fresh installed system became quickly very unstable.\nOne concrete problem for instance: I haven't had that much harddisk space reserved for Linux so it happened to me a few times that I had 0 bytes left on my partition. Maybe I'm not completely precise because I don't know the exact mechanism, but when you fill up a disk with a non-root account there are always a few kilobytes left. But if you really have 0 bytes left, your system makes weird errors and you might end up with some hard to fix damage in your system because there is a lot of system software running in the background...\nAnother thing is: That division between root and non-root keeps your system well-organized. As a root-user you might be tempted to not cleanly install your new applications which leaves you with a dirty, hard maintainable system.\nBut the good thing: Modern distributions do most of the administration tasks for you, so seldom you have to fiddle in the guts of your Linux system with a root account. Entering a password from time to time is sufficient, the rest is done by the distributor's scripts.\nBut I doubt that you haven't had issues on your Windows system with that if you used 95 oder 98. (At least I had issues with that...) Because of the lack of a clear separation between Administrator and regular user \"traditional\" Windows apps assume they can do anything E.g. install Spyware if they feel like it, even without telling you. Microsoft engaged in that issue when releasing Vista. (Effectively implementing a sudo mechanism.) So people got very annoying dialogues saying \"You can't do that\". For some non-Vista-compliant software you needed some dirty hacks to install it, even as Administrator...\n\nA: There are a lot of aspects behind this approach. Some of them are:\n\n*\n  Root is all powerful.\nIn Unix and Unix-like systems, system administration privileges are all or nothing. A user either has root access or not, and root access implies complete control of a machine. If the machine in question is used by more than one person, or root has access to other systems or user files, it is more acceptable to give some users partial root privileges.\n\n*The root user can hide all of their actions.\nsudo logs every command run via sudo. Having a record of what's being done with sudo helps us diagnose problems with individual systems/processes and general configuration issues, as well as helping us identify needed improvements.\n\n*The root password gives you access to any command on a system.\nVia its config file, sudo can give a user root access for a particular set of commands. This also avoids the \"all or nothing\" effect, allowing us to give individual users more control over their machines and to help themselves out of common problems.\nhere is a good article : http://cf.stanford.edu/policy/root\n\nA: Ultimately there is no harm in running as root. It's just a bunch of paranoid people who think that re-installing an OS is impossible. The \"Someone might compromise a program..\" argument, so what? if they do that then they already could keylog your password, or just display a root password request anyway and have you give them the password. Blow away your system because you select everything in / and delete? oh well, get out the installer and re-install. It takes less than 20 minutes, grab a coffee and chill. Root is fine, I've been running root as long as I can remember and you know what it does? It makes installing packages less of a headache. You don't have to enter root password every 5 minutes like you normally have to. You don't run into problems trying to save/edit system config files because they're root permissions only. It's just so much easier and better to run as root. \n", "Q: Installation of trading-shim there is a software for trades called trading-shim. I played a little bit around to install it, but I wanted to know if some people out there know how to install.\n\nA: can you tell us a little more about what you tried and what went wrong?\nIn perusing their INSTALL file I see:\n\"Prerequisites:  You need, at a minimum, a C++ compiler; a Java; a\nrunning Trader Workstation, available by download from\nhttp://www.interactive.brokers.com/ ; MySQL; and Ruby.\"\nDo you have all these installed? \nC++ compiler (gcc) is available by installing the build-essential package.\n\"a Java\" probably means a JVM. There are two available for Ubuntu as I recall. I recommend firing up Synaptic and searching on \"Java\" to see what's available and decide which you want. You can also get MySQL and Ruby through Synaptic AFAIK. The Trader Workstation appears to be available as a Java application from the referenced link (which appears to be broken- should be http://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/control/systemstandalone.php?os=unix&ib_entity=llc ).\nI'm going to assume you have never compiled software before. In general, we'll use gcc to compile things from C or C++ or Pascal or the many languages gcc supports. The usual procedure is something like:\n1) Download source code (usually a tarball or other archive)\n2) Unpack archive into the location of your choice\n3) Read README and other documentation to determine dependencies, expected paths to libraries, etc.\n4) cd to directory containing Makefile\n5) ./configure or make configure\n6) make\n7) make install\nIf the dependencies are properly installed, the code and supporting scripts are properly written and invoked, and the stars are properly aligned, you should now have a functioning binary. ;^)\n", "Q: Can you change the orientation of the Unity launcher? I was looking at 11.04 pre-Alpha and wondering if I can change the dock orientation. Does the pre-Alpha have this function? Is the idea being implemented as we speak? If not where can I propose this idea? \n\nA: This feature request was reported as a bug recently, but the request was declined. \nMark Shuttleworth answered:\n\nI'm afraid that won't work with our broader design goals, so we won't implement that. We want the launcher always close to the Ubuntu button.\n\nSee also: OMG Ubuntu - Ubuntu Unity launcher won’t be ‘moveable’\n\nA: I've no idea whether this is being implemented or not (edit: see fluteflute's answer here), but:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can submit your ideas for ubuntu at  Ubuntu Brainstorm.\n\n\nThere isn't a proposal yet for your idea, so i suggest you add one. By the way, they are indeed being read by the Ubuntu developers. \n\nA: unity wont support changing the launcher(please dont call it dock) position afaik. it might have something to do with the fact that ubuntu button in the top left have a relationship with the launcher e.g. the icon will glow if there is pending notification in one of the running apps.\n\nA: No, The position of the launcher is fixed (left) but and I wished to change the position too, so rather than changing I set it to auto-hide which is effectively good option (without using any external apps). The launcher when hovered overlaps the opened application rather than shrinking the size. So thats equally good. :)\n", "Q: How do I adjust the volume without pulseaudio?

If you need all the files the best way to do it is just to use the regular ubuntu one client and setup your account.\n\nA: The best way to get all your files is to just install the Ubuntu One client as normal.\nHowever, if you're unable to do that for some reason, you can use u1ftp as a stopgap. Download from Launchpad; u1ftp is explained by James Henstridge here and there are some demonstration screencasts and descriptions here. It works on pretty much every desktop platform (Ubuntu, Mac, Windows, Fedora, Suse, etc), and it makes Ubuntu One available over FTP to the computer you're on, so you can access U1 directly as a network drive in Nautilus or Windows Explorer or Coda or by mounting it as a drive, and it connects securely to Ubuntu One via the U1 files API and SSL.\n\nA: Just a suggestion look at this, however if you need a local backup use unison.\n", "Q: Control compiz zoom from the command line I'm downstairs on my phone trying to VNC into my desktop upstairs but earlier today, I zoomed in with compiz on one of my screens so it makes using that screen over VNC almost impossible.\nNow I could go upstairs...

I don't want to google for the ppa name and I don't want to execute add-apt-repository before executing apt-get. I just want to install a ppa package with one command like ppa install vim to get the newest vim ppa version.\nCan you recommend me a tool?\n\nA: There isn't such a tool, because that is not the way ppa's work, nor is it safe.\nYou could potential write a script that locates the ppa and pulls the package from it directly, but you would have to note that you can easily break your system that way. Sometimes the longer, more complicated route, is the safer way to do things, and better to be safe than sorry :).\n\nA: ppasearch might help you find PPAs in a CLI environment.\n\nA: Using add-apt-repository (or adding the deb lines to /etc/apt/sources.list manually, which is more-or-less the same thing) is the apt-get way. Apt needs to know what packages are available for installation, and for that to work it has to have a list of installable repositories. It's simply not feasible to search Launchpad for all PPAs for the most recent version, nor is that safe — I could create vim 99999999-9999 which hoses your entire system (debs install as root). Installing software from third party repositories is something you should be forced to think about.\n\nA: These are three simple commands, provided that you know what the PPA is:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:george-edison55/george-edison\n\n*sudo apt-get update && upgrade\n\n*sudo apt-get install stackapplet (name of application that you want to install)\n\n\nA: As indicated clearly in the other answers, what you're asking for would be unsafe.  Repositories allow you to not only get software, but to regularly get updates to the software to fix security holes and bugs.  What you ask for would be like googling the whole web to find a package and blindly downloading it and installing it.  That's a sure way to not only risk getting malware, but, even for good packages, to leave yourself open to security issues that are found later and updated in the ppa, which you would not be tracking.\nSo you do need to search to find a ppa, using the tools mentioned in the other answers.  You should then personally vet the reputation of the ppa, since it could easily take over your whole system if you add it. \nIf you find a ppa that you trust, use add-apt-repository as described elsewhere.\nBut another aspect of your question is how to get just a set of specified packages from it.  For that, see the info at How do I cherry pick packages from a PPA? - Ask Ubuntu.  If you want an easier solution, you should file an enhancement bug request on launchpad with a good use case. \n", "Q: Mouse cursor seems to change keyboard input focus Running 10.04 and 10.10 (maybe before these) I've noticed that for some dialogs to accept input the mouse cursor must be in the parent window.

Not sure if there is a specific, objective answer to this question but I get the same everything I want to buy a piece of hardware and try to check if it's Ubuntu / Linux compatible:\n\nRequired OS → Microsoft Windows 7 (32/64 bits), Microsoft Windows Vista (32/64 bits), Microsoft Windows XP (only 32 bits), Mac OS X 10.6.2 or higher, 10.5.6 or higher, 10.4.11 or higher\n\nThing is, the product usually does work flawlessly with Ubuntu. Why don't these people even mention that in the product specifications? Why do they always make it harder for the (admittedly small) Linux-using part of the population who want to buy their products?\nIt's not like including that information somewhere would cost them money, would it?\n\nA: as far as I understand, they don't add ubuntu / linux to the list mean that they don't officially support it.\nBy officially supporting ubuntu / linux mean that they will have to answer every support question. This off course will add cost to their operation, given the range of ubuntu / linux configurations.\n\nA: Vendors probably feel that they can safely ignore Linux / Ubuntu due to low perceived market share. Presumably they think that the tiny amount of money spent to add \"Linux 2.6.32 and above\" to the package is not justified by the small number of revenue generated by the few folk who will buy the item based on that support.\nOr maybe it's not that. Vendors generally develop their own drivers for Windows, and those drivers are often closed-source. The vendor retains complete control over the functionality of the device, and does not have to worry about some geek tweaking the code, modprobing the new driver, and complaining to customer service if the device doesn't work properly.\nFrankly, even when the package does claim linux support, don't believe it. I've been burnt in this way by ASUS, whose idea of \"Linux support\" is providing a CD with an ancient, non-compiling version of someone else's (RaLink) chipset driver and telling the user, \"Go compile it.\" When I contacted technical support, I was told that they only support kernels up to 2.6.22! I'd like to believe that RaLink is unique in this, but I don't.\nDoes anyone know if the vendors that actually work with Linux developers to support their devices under Linux (HP and IBM come to mind. Intel?) advertise \"Linux support\" on the hardware they sell? I haven't thought to check...\n", "Q: How can I accept the Microsoft EULA agreement for ttf-mscorefonts-installer?

Here is what is posted about suspend/resume problems similar to yours:\nInstantaneous wakeups from suspend\nFor some Intel Haswell systems with the LynxPoint and LynxPoint-LP chipset, instantaneous wakeups after suspend are reported. They are linked to erroneous BIOS ACPI implementations and how the xhci_hcd module interprets it during boot. As a work-around reported affected systems are added to a blacklist (named XHCI_SPURIOUS_WAKEUP) by the kernel case-by-case.[2]\nInstantaneous resume may happen, for example, if a USB device is plugged during suspend and ACPI wakeup triggers are enabled. A viable work-around for such a system, if it is not on the blacklist yet, is to disable the wakeup triggers. An example to disable wakeup through USB is described as follows.[3]\nTo view the current configuration:\n$ cat /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\nDevice  S-state   Status   Sysfs node\n...\nEHC1      S3    *enabled  pci:0000:00:1d.0\nEHC2      S3    *enabled  pci:0000:00:1a.0\nXHC       S3    *enabled  pci:0000:00:14.0\n\n...\nThe relevant devices are EHC1, EHC2 and XHC (for USB 3.0). To toggle their state you have to echo the device name to the file as root.\n# echo EHC1 > /proc/acpi/wakeup\n# echo EHC2 > /proc/acpi/wakeup\n# echo XHC > /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\nThis should result in suspension working again. However, this settings are only temporary and would have to be set at every reboot. To automate this take a look at systemd#Writing unit files.

I already used a lot of Ubuntu versions, I started with 5.10. But eversince I had issues with the audio subsystem. No matter what hardware, currently I have two computers and both have issues. On my laptop I need to trigger the Speaker channel to get sound, on my Desktop, also Ubuntu 10.04/32 bit it took me also a lot of fiddling to get the sound working. Actually it just worked by accident. Although the input sound quality is still really bad. \nNow I installed on another partition Ubuntu 10.04/64bit and sound is not working though the high level software stack seems to be fine.  Pavucontrol registers sounds and shows the correct hardware but I can't hear a thing. (Except on the other output jacks, front panel and the other channel, I hear strange sounds.)\nMy question is: How can I learn to understand Ubuntu's soundsystem and be able to debug such problems myself?\nAnd another question: Why is audio on Ubuntu so complicated? There must be tens of thousands of threads in online forums about these problems and I have already seen dozens of threads indicating no succesful solution. On the other hand there must be hundreds of problem solving guides but none of these is able to cover it all...\nThanks, Philip\n\nA: During my tenure maintaining the PC audio stack in Ubuntu, I made several presentations on debugging the desktop aspect, and you may find this one the most gentle or informative.  The gist of the matter is that combinations of ego (aka \"technical pride\"), politics, and ownership collisions (aka \"no maintainer\") have caused a morass of APIs to crop up over the past decade (and few years), and many incorrect assumptions have been made all over the place.  We're continuing to eliminate many of the inconsistencies and poor assumptions.  For Ubuntu specifically, we have a developer Launchpad group.  I can't speak for the other members, because they're all Canonical employees and may have additional restrictions, but certainly feel free to contact me through Launchpad; I'm happy to walk you through the debugging process individually as our schedules mesh.\nIt's absolutely vital to note that PulseAudio has more stringent requirements of one's audio hardware in a fundamentally different manner to traditional applications.  These requirements continue to expose poor assumptions in the kernel, the sound drivers, and underlying libraries.  For a long time, people's \"solution\" for \"fixing broken sound\" has consisted of removing PulseAudio, which effectively skips the broken aspects of the kernel, the sound drivers, and underlying libraries themselves.  So, while you \"get sound back,\" the problem remains.  In the end, it's much better to fix the problems completely.\nTo summarize, there are two general approaches for methodical audio debugging.  Either one starts at the application level, say, Banshee, or one starts at the hardware level.  For the sake of consistency I'll refer to the former as \"high level,\" i.e., higher in the stack, and the latter as \"low level,\" or lower in the stack closest to the hardware.  I'm most comfortable troubleshooting from the lowest level upward, since my involvement in audio over the past decade (from creating and maintaining device drivers up through application integration) has seen OEMs repeating mistakes that Linux, i.e., the kernel, has to work around (or \"hack around\" as we developers sometimes call it).  Yet hardware people are no more guilty than software people.  These problems have many bases: it doesn't matter whether they lie in the BIOS, the power supply, the motherboard bridges, sound controllers and codecs, the kernel, or the userspace portions (libraries, APIs, PulseAudio, applications, and so on).  In the end the issue is quite straightforward: we all insufficiently handle out-of-bounds conditions from every level below and across.\nAt the PC hardware level, we begin debugging by identifying precisely which components are used.  Most modern desktop audio hardware has two significant pieces of information: the PCI subsystem identifier and the audio codec subsystem identifier.  You can find the former via lspci -nv; look for the audio subsystem codes 0401 (AC'97) or 0403 (High Definition Audio).  Depending on hardware, the latter can be identified through information exposed by the ALSA driver itself in /proc/asound (the developers' debugging script I just linked automates much of that information-gathering).  It's absolutely vital that one realize and remember that similar, even identical, symptoms often have varying hardware and software causes.  For that reason it's easiest on people fixing the bugs to have a clear bug report, and that's why in Ubuntu we have ubuntu-bug alsa-base for driver problems and ubuntu-bug pulseaudio for application problems.  If you aren't sure what's at fault, just choose one, or use ubuntu-bug's audio symptom.  Regardless, we'll request additional information as necessary.\nThe PCI SSID is important, because it is a record of which computer manufacturer integrates which set of audio components onto a motherboard.  For example, you'll often find Dell, HP/Compaq, Acer, Samsung, Lenovo, and so on using different combinations of IDT/Sigmatel, Realtek, Cirrus, Analog, and Conexant audio components.  A Dell that has a Realtek 269 does not necessarily have the same behavior as an HP with a Realtek 269.\nThe codec SSID can be considered the analog of the PCI one from the perspective of the audio equipment manufacturer.  Information associated with the codec SSID can be used to find which revision has been integrated onto the silicon.\nUnfortunately, here's where the problems begin.  Assuming that the BIOS is ok (which is a rather blind assumption, since there are a lot of broken BIOSes that wreak havoc with Linux audio), sometimes the PCI SSID is reused incorrectly.  In those situations, our recourse is to apply specific quirks in the driver based on codec SSID.  Unfortunately still, sometimes the codec SSID is reused incorrectly.  In those situations, we have to look at specific revisions of the codec in addition to more blindly brute-forcing attempts to reinitialize the driver.\nFor most of the newest equipment, we tend to trust the BIOS instead of using our historical \"just use this hard-coded definition\" approach.  In some situations, we have to use tools to emulate the codec to find which pin definitions perform what functions. Missing functions in the driver to handle jack sense, i.e., (un)muting internal speakers when headphones are (removed)inserted, can be easily corrected in this fashion.\nOnce we've determined that your underlying hardware isn't broken and that the sound driver doesn't need to be patched, we look at the userspace layer, namely alsa-lib, alsa-plugins, and pulseaudio.  The vast majority of issues lie in the driver or in (some interface to) PulseAudio.\nalsa-lib is responsible for handling all native ALSA operations (thus, PulseAudio uses it, too).  Problems here will manifest themselves regardless whether PulseAudio is used.  On the other hand, problems arising only when the 'default' ALSA virtual device is used can point to either the PulseAudio alsa-lib plugin (in alsa-plugins) or to PulseAudio itself.  In standard Ubuntu 8.10 and Kubuntu 10.10 installations, 'default' routes through PulseAudio, so switching between the 'default' and native PulseAudio outputs (or inputs as the use case may be) should help narrow down which layer to further investigate.\n\nA: You might want to start reading from PulseAudio entry at ubuntu's wiki.\n", "Q: Faulty upgrade from 10.4 to 10.10 Can I redo the upgrade without erasing all the existing mess?

As Jeremy stated, they're being considered for inclusion as part of upstream compat-wireless, and they have not yet landed in compat-wireless (they're only in staging currently), hence they have not landed in linux-backports-modules-2.6.35 yet.

Maybe it is just \"vsftpd\" and it will find its own config file(s)... but would this clash with disabling load-on-boot?\nOption 2:. Start the daemon as the system boots up,\nbut start it in a stop/waiting mode... ie. equivalent to sudo stop vsftpd, or sudo initctl stop vsftpd.  \nI would prefer Option 1, because I rarely need an ftp server. \n\nA: The answer to this may depend on which version of Ubuntu you are running. On version 10.10 (and maybe version 10.04) which uses upstart you can edit the /etc/init/vsftpd.conf file and comment out the two lines involved with starting vsftpd as so:\n#start on (filesystem\n#        and net-device-up IFACE!=lo)\n\nThe # at the beginning of the lines indicates a comment and will deactivate starting vsftpd on startup.\nWhen you are ready to start vsftpd, you can simply type:\nsudo start vsftpd\n\nat a command prompt to start vsftpd. To stop you would use:\nsudo stop vsftpd\n\nI hope this is helpful!\n\nA: You can stop the daemon using the following command,          \nsudo service vsftpd stop\n\nAdd the above command to startup list so that the daemon will be stopped during time.If you want to start the daemon after bootup.Issue the following command in terminal.\nsudo service vsftpd start\n\nAdding the command to Startup list.Goto System>>Preferences>>Startup Applications.Click Add and give your command there.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Wiki refuses to change theme I'm attempting to do everything I can in terms of trying to make sure my team's wiki page looks good, but sadly, I cannot seem to activate the new theme (I'm stuck using the old one, for some odd reason)\nI get the message:\nThis email already belongs to somebody else.\nWhenever I try and change theme (or other settings) How do I correct this?\n\nA: Yes that's a bug\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-website/+bug/685436\n", "Q: What's the best, simplest OCR solution? I'd like to scan a good amount of papers I have lying around, with the least possible hassle. I would like to convert them to images using Simple Scan, then convert them to text using OCR. Is there a good OCR app with a GUI that will give me good results at the push of a button?\n\nA: linux-intelligent-ocr-solution\ndisclaimer - I am closely connected with the development of this opensource solution\nLios can convert print to text using either scanner or a camera.\nIt can also produce text out of scanned images from other sources such as Pdf, Image or Folder containing Images. \nProgram is given total accessibility for visually impaired. \nSince I'm closely connected - I would love feedback. \n\n\n*\n\n*Site at Sourceforge\n\n*Source code\n\n*Forum\n\nA: *\n\n*GOCR from\nis an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program.It converts scanned images of text back to text files.        \n\n*CLARA is another good graphical option.      \n\n*OCRAD from\nis an OCR can be used as a stand-alone console application,or as a backend to other programs. \n\n*KOOKA from\nis a KDE application but works fine,in addition you have to install actual OCR programs like GOCR and OCRAD.After installing Kooka and the OCR programs,you have to point Kooka to the OCR install location in order for it to be able to convert the JPEG to text.\n\n*OCRFeeder from\nis a document layout analysis and optical character recognition system.  \n\n*Tesseract from\nis Command line utility and it is very simple to use.You can install language package tesseract-ocr-eng from  here.\nHave a look at this page.\nNote:\nTo run tesseract goto terminal and type the following\ntesseract imagefile.tif outputfile.txt\n\nTesseract can only read a TIFF file - if you've got a JPEG or PDF or whatever, you'll have to convert it. Also, the filename extension must be .tif, not .tiff, otherwise tesseract errors out.\n\nA: Best and easyest way out there is to use pypdfocr it doesn't change the pdf. pypdfocr is a python module link here.\npypdfocr your_document.pdf\n\nAt the end you will have another your_document_ocr.pdf the way you want it with searchable text. The app doesn't change the quality of the image. Increases the size of the file a bit by adding the overlay text.\nI think the command is pretty easy that it doesn't need any GUI.\nMaybe installing pypdfocr is a bit more verbose:\nsudo apt install tesseract-ocr \npip install pypdfocr \n\nUpdate 3rd november 2018:\npypdfocr is no longer supported since 2016 and I noticed some problems due to not being mentained. ocrmypdf(module does a symiliar job and can be used like this:\nocrmypdf in.pdf out.pdf\n\nTo install:\npip install ocrmypdf\n\nor\napt install ocrmypdf\n\n\nA: I have just had success (under 16.04) with pdfocr.rb. This is listed on Ubuntu wiki\nHere is a ppa but the repository for 16.04 is not updated. The ruby script above from github though still works with 16.04.\nYou can download it from Github. You will need the following packages installed:\nruby tesseract-ocr pdftk exactimage\n\nthen made pdfocr.rb executable and ran:\n./pdfocf.rb -i source.pdf -o output.pdf\n\nOptionally you can use the -l LANG parameter. In that case you will need to install tesseract-ocr-LANG package, where LANG is the three letter ISO 639-2 language code. Right now you have 108 languages on 16.04 repo.\n\nA: There are few popular OCR command-line tools you can use (I'm not sure if they've GUI):\n\n\n*\n\n*Tesseract (ReadMe, FAQ) (Python)\nAlso available for: Tesseract .NET, Tesseract iOS\n\nAn OCR Engine that was developed at HP Labs between 1985 and 1995...\n  and now at Google. Tesseract is probably the most accurate open source\n  OCR engine available.\n\nUsage:\ntesseract [inputFile] [outputFile] [-l optionalLanguageFile] [PathTohOCRConfigFile]\n\n\n*GOCR\n\nOpen-source character recognition. It converts scanned images of text\n  back to text files. GOCR can be used with different front-ends, which\n  makes it very easy to port to different OSes and architectures. It can\n  open many different image formats, and its quality have been improving\n  in a daily basis.\n\n\n*OCRopus™ (FAQ) (written in Python, NumPy, and SciPy)\n\nOCR system focusing on the use of\n  large scale machine learning for addressing problems in document\n  analysis, featuring pluggable layout analysis, pluggable character recognition, statistical natural language modeling, and multi-lingual capabilities.\nThe OCRopus engine is based on two research projects: a\n  high-performance handwriting recognizer developed in the mid-90's and\n  deployed by the US Census bureau, and novel high-performance layout\n  analysis methods.\nOCRopus is development is sponsored by Google and is initially\n  intended for high-throughput, high-volume document conversion efforts.\n  We expect that it will also be an excellent OCR system for many other\n  applications.\n\n\n*Tessnet2 (Open source, OCR, Tesseract, .NET, DOTNET, C#, VB.NET, C++/CLI)\n\nTesseract is a C++ open source OCR engine. Tessnet2 is .NET assembly\n  that expose very simple methods to do OCR. Tessnet2 is under Apache 2 license (like tesseract), meaning you can use it like you want, included in commercial products.\n\nFew others: ABBYY CLI OCR for Linux, Asprise OCR\nFor more complete list, check: List of optical character recognition software at Wikipedia\nSee also: wanghaisheng/awesome-ocr - A curated list of promising OCR resources at GitHub.\n\nA: Gscan2PDF\nOCR on multi page PDF or scanned documents\nThis is probably the easiest way. Gscan2pdf is a graphical tool which lets you not only scan files, but also import files and perform OCR on them. \nInstall gscan2pdf from here , from Ubuntu Software Center or running this command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install gscan2pdf\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Run gscan2pdf\n\n*Import the pdf (Ctrl+O)\n\n*Optional: Tools > Clean up\n\n*Choose Tools > OCR Save (Ctrl+S)\n\n\nGscan2PDF can use customizable OCR engines, default is tesseract-ocr\nYou might consider selecting the appropriate language.

You can scan right to the program or import your pdf into the program.  I've found the Tesseract engine works great, and very easy to use\n\nA: OCRFeeder has already been mentioned as one of many options, but I thought it would be worth mentioning why it fulfills your requirements:\n\n*\n\n*It has a GUI (unlike some of the applications mentioned in some of the other answers)\n\n*It's easy to use (click Add Image then click Recognize Document)\n\nIn addition, it has other qualities that make it an excellent choice:\n\n*\n\n*It's just a frontend and can use one of any number of backends (engines), with built-in support for CuneiForm, GOCR, Ocrad and Tesseract (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/ocrfeeder/-/blob/master/src/ocrfeeder/util/configuration.py).\n\n*It's packaged for Ubuntu (as ocrfeeder)\n\n*It's still under active development at the time of this posting\n\n*It's part of the Gnome project\n\n", "Q: How to add nvidia-current drivers into an iso file with remastersys? It is necessary to use 3D drivers with Unity Desktop 11.04. How can I create my own iso disk to burn it on usb drive for testing Unity. I have some problems to test unity in Virtual box also default Ubuntu Disk Creator doesn't work for me to make usable installation on usb.\nI am searching the internet without success for how to add files, or - for example - the nvidia-current driver, to an iso. Only topics like \"create you own custom distribution\" but those topics don't fit the content :) :(\nI can not report bugs without possibility to test natty with unity. \n\nA: I'm afraid you can't, at least there is no easy or official way to do so. Remastersys doesn't enable you to bundle proprietary drivers:\n\nYou should start with a clean install of Ubuntu or variant and use a single user to make all changes.  You should not install any proprietary video drivers like the nvidia or ati drivers as they will not be used on the livecd and users will have to reinstall them after installation. (source)\n\nHowever, you can add files to the installation. Any file that is put in /etc/skel will be copied to the home folder of each user on the installation. So you could potentially bundle the dependencies of nvidia-current and add the .deb installer.\n", "Q: What exactly is \"Ubuntu Desktop Edition\" safe mode? I've installed Ubuntu 10.10 i386 on an old laptop (Compaz Evo N1015V: 1.2GHz CPU, 256M RAM!).  When attempting to log into Desktop Edition,  nothing is drawn apart from the mouse pointer - the background remains as with GDM, the panel/nautilus do not appear, keyboard shortcuts (Alt+F2 for example) do not work, etc.  \"Safe mode\", however, works fine.\nI managed to solve this problem by removing compiz, which was a bit of a brute-force solution but did the job for this machine.\nSo one thing that is different between safe mode and normal: compiz isn't started.\nBut what else?  I can't find any documentation about \"safe mode\" anywhere.  What else does it do differently?\n\nA: Safe mode is supposed to load only the default video driver (VESA/FB) in order to bypass any vga-related problems.\nIn your case, your video driver couldn't probably work with Compiz, so you could either go to 'safe mode' (and just load the plain video driver with no support for Compiz) or uninstall the package.\n", "Q: I am looking for a small (Ubuntu) open-source-project for which I can code I have basic C and C++ programming skills as well as a little bit experience with gtkmm and Linux-programming in general (not to forget I have lots of spare time). I want to participate in an Ubuntu project which is small and not too complex in order to improve my programming sills and of course support Ubuntu.  \nCan you give me pointers in the right direction and do you know of a project where I could start?\n\nA: Another opportunity is to look for an area where the linux ecosystem is lacking, and create a small application to fill the space. A good example of this is simple-scan. If you can create (a) small application(s) like this that improve the life of the wider community, it goes a long way.\nI personally have a small game project in need of coders. If you are interested: Colonial The Game.\n\nA: GNOME Love is also a good place for new contributors to start.\n\nA: The right answer to that question is up to you.  What I mean is that you can only put your heart and soul into a project that you are interested in.  Find something that you use often and that is missing a feature or it has a bug that annoys you so much that you would give up your spare time to fix it.  That is the perfect project for you.\nAnything else suggested by other people will very likely only motivate you for a couple of days and then you will be looking for something else to do.\n\nA: I good place to start is the One Hundred Paper Cuts project.\n\nA: Aside from recommending any specific Project, keep this in mind:\nWith open source software,\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't need to ask permission from anybody to\n\n\n*\n\n*download source code\n\n*modify it\n\n*re-distribute your modified versions\n\n\nAs long as you follow the terms of the License.\nMany projects are apprehensive of accepting new members before they have contributed in some way; therefore, it's best to just start doing stuff and worry about the projects after you've done something. If your modifications are significant, make your work known on their mailing lists, forums or IRC channels. They will most likely help you out, getting to know the projects structure and development guidelines.\nI absolutely agree with João Pinto's recommendation of the One Hundred Paper Cuts project, it's a fantastic place to start.\n\nA: Another good place to start is to look for bugs that have been marked as easy to fix, using the bitesize tag.\n\nA: Ubuntu is using tons of open source software. You also can support some project/s separate form Ubuntu but used by them. \nFor example sourceforge, freshmeat.net etc. and pick a project according to your expertise / interests and became a member of the dev.team or just contact them and send a pach.

I am trying to create a bootable USB stick from a .iso image (it isn't a linux distro or anything of the sort) intended for use with a CD. I've tried UNetbootin and dd but they don't boot.\n\nA: Usually, Unetbootin works perfectly so try to file a bug if possible.\nIf you want to make a bootable ubuntu flash disk, you could try the Ubuntu Startup Disk Writer.\nFor Fedora, there is a similar utility.\n\nA: Try Ubuntu Startup disk creator, I don't think it discriminates about which input ISO you give it.

Should be in /usr/bin/ktorrent. That way everytime you download a torrent it will use ktorrent.\nIf you want to have access to ktorrent via torrents you already have downloaded. Then.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on a torrent file and select Properties.\n\n*Select OPEN WITH tab\n\n*Select KTORRENT from the list. If it is not from the list click on ADD and search or type ktorrent.\n\n\nThis way you will make a relationship between all torrent files and ktorrent.\n", "Q: Is Compiz Unity's new flat black/outlined launcher look permanent? The new compiz version of Unity has a different looking launcher. Before it was similar to the ambiance theme used in unity.

(my opinion: this looks like it belongs to a different style of theme, and when a window is next to it, it looks like two themes are clashing.) \n \nThis will look way better when maximized windows share titlebar and menu with the panel. I think even after maximized windows share controls and menu, the smooth look will still always fit better though\n\nA: The theme is not final. We don't have design resources yet.\nCurrently it is just me drawing what I think looks okay without putting a lot of time into it. It could probably use a gradient or two...\n\nA: I'm not sure I completely understand your question, but you may like to take a look at the \"blog\" post \"Window controls will show in Unity panel for maximised apps\" which may address your question about the window titlebar.\n", "Q: How to direct Ubuntu to use USB connection for Internet I posted yesterday regarding how to configure easytether on Ubuntu.

It's only worked if I plugged in the cable and then used the Internet for a while,\nafter being assured that I am connected, I will remove the cable and start using Wifi. This works just for a while, but when I restart I will have to do the same thing again.\nAfter connected to the wired network, I try to bring my netbook away from the modem, I am still connected if I am nearby to my modem that located upstairs of my house. Then if I go downstairs, the connections is fading away but the wireless indicator still indicate 100% active.\nDownstairs, I can't access the internet at all even though the indicator shows 100%. If I want to connect to the internet again, I have to go upstairs, put in the cable in again and again. This trouble's really exhausting me.\nWhat is the problem?\n\nA: You haven't indicated which brand your wifi adapter is. Have you check if there's a more uptodate driver for your wifi adapter? Does this also happen if you try it on another platform like windows?\n\nA: I suppose your computer doesn't receive LAN paramenters (IP, DNS) via wifi.\nTry to Ping some IP outside you home network, for example Google public DNS 8.8.8.8.\nIf it works with wifi after disconnecting from your ethernet cable, you probably need to configure your wifi connection settings manually ! Most likely you will need to provide DNS server information.\n\n\nA: I had a very similar problem today using Ubuntu Maverick. I reinstalled my wi-fi driver (bcmwl-modaliases) and now the issue is apparently fixed. Identify your wi-fi driver and try to reinstall it on the cable. Then reboot and try to use your wi-fi connection.\n\nA: If I were experiencing this type of problem with my own computer, I would start by trying to figure out whether the problem was with the DSL modem/router, or the computer. So the first thing I would do is reboot the modem/router to see if it is just a simple problem with that equipment. \nNext, I would log in to the modem/router's web based configuration system (using the wired connection) to reset the wireless password just in case I had mistyped it. Then I would reset the wireless password on the computer to match the password entered into the router's configuration. Then, I'd unplug the ethernet cable and turn on the computers wireless and connect wirelessly to the router. Does it work?\nNext, I would start to suspect that maybe it is a problem with the computer. Is there another wireless access point that you can try connecting too? Maybe at a library or coffee shop? If I could not connect successfully to another wireless access point, then I would really start to suspect that the wireless on the computer had some kind of problem. Maybe a driver that doesn't work properly? Maybe the wireless card is defective?\nFinally, I would start to investigate what type of wireless card was installed in the computer. Is it well supported in Ubuntu and other Linux based systems? Have other people reported trouble with this type of wireless card? If so, I would look seriously at replacing the wireless card with one that is properly supported by Ubuntu, most are.\n\nA: Some questions:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Are you using network-manager for managing the wireless NIC (WNIC)?\n\n*Can you paste the output of ifconfig in your initial post?\n\n*Can you verify that the WNIC is indeed connected to your wi-fi network?\n\n*Have you obtained an IP address on your WNIC?\n\n*If you do have obtained an IP address on the wireless adapter, try 2 things:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the wired NIC (type: sudo ifconfig eth0 down) or  \n\n*Release the wired NIC's DHCP lease (type: sudo dhclient eth0 -r)\n\n\n\nA: Read through the community documentation here it should give you all the information needed to find the root cause of the problem.\nIf your still having problems you will need to provide some more diagnostic information to enable us to help you further - stating that it works fine on Win7 gives us very little information to go on.\n", "Q: How do I use xplanet?

For example, if you were to have a line indented with four spaces, with auto indentation the next line will also have four spaces.

What are the differences between an Ubuntu Long Term Support release (LTS) and a normal release?\n\nA: The most important thing (for most people) is how long you get to use an install without having to do a release upgrade. A non-LTS version of Ubuntu only gets updates for 9 months from its release so to stay up-to-date —which is critically important— you need to upgrade twice a year; you need to upgrade through every Ubuntu version…\nConversely an Ubuntu LTS release is supported for 5 years and you can upgrade directly from LTS to LTS. This gives you long-lived, solid base to target and test on that makes it super-easy to release-upgrade when you decide to. It's therefore ideal for mass deployment, high-availability systems, and just people who don't like doing release-upgrades.\nIn the last two LTS versions, point-updates have also been made available to support newer hardware (it's a kernel, driver and X stack), which boosts the utility of the LTS versions over their lifespan. The original stacks are maintained too.\nMost other applications won't jump versions, so it makes for a solid, predictable deployment.\nIn terms of the Ubuntu development process, Ubuntu pulls many of its packages from Debian. Debian has multiple versions too (stable, testing and unstable) that usually correlate with package age. The package pull for an LTS will favour the more stable Debian version. I'm certain there are exceptions to this.\nThere also is supposedly more focus on bug fixing for an LTS release. More people have a vested interest in the success of an LTS so I'd like to think more people test it pre-release.\n\nA: Previous desktop LTS releases were supported for 3 years.\nHowever, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS will be supported for 5 years both for desktop and server releases.\n\nA: Canonical provides security updates for the LTS releases for 3 years on the desktop and 5 years for the server version. The normal release is only supported with updates for 18 months.\n\nA: Simply put, LTS releases introduce fewer new technologies than Normal releases, and replaces them with Long Term Support of the older, more time-tested technologies that have proven track records of working like said.\n\nA: There is a new release every 6 months (in April and October), with the version number being year.month (e.g.: 16.04 was released in April 2016). Every two years, the April release is a Long Term Support version.\n\n\n*\n\n*All normal releases (13.04 and later) are only supported for 9 months.\n\n*All LTS releases (12.04 and later) are supported for five years on both the desktop and the server.\nOlder versions had slightly different support cycles, but they haven't been included as they're all unsupported now. See the Ubuntu Wiki for historical information.\nNow, support means:\n\n\n*\n\n*Updates for potential security problems and bugs (not new versions of software)\n\n*Availability of Commercial support contracts from Canonical\n\n*Support by Landscape, Canonical's enterprise oriented server management tool set\nThe Desktop refers to the packages that are in the main and restricted repositories, these are the ones that have the little  Ubuntu icon next to them in Synaptic or are marked as Supported in the Software-Centre respectively.\nThe Server packages are the ones in the \"server-ship\" and \"supported-common\" seeds (there's a directory of all of the different seeds available).\nThis is what this looks like:\n\nImage from Ubuntu.com\nThe primary reason for using an LTS release is that you can depend on it being updated regularly and therefore secure and stable.\nAs if this wasn't enough, Ubuntu releases additional versions of the last LTS between releases—such as 14.04.1, that incorporate all of the updates up to this point. This is called a Point-Release (or sometimes snapshot). Those are released every quarter to half year, as needed.\n\nIn addition to support, there are Development strategies that differentiate an LTS release:\n\n\n*\n\n*The base of the operating system, Debian, comes in three versions: Stable, Testing and Unstable. Normally, Ubuntu is based on Unstable; the LTS releases are based on Testing. Starting with 14.04 LTS, all new releases will be based on Debian Unstable.\n\n*The Development effort for an LTS release in focused on providing a rock solid base, not only for customers who want the LTS release, but also for the next three Ubuntu versions to come. \n\nThanks to Oli for demystifying that last part, I wasn't quite sure about it.\n", "Q: How do I disable X at boot time so that the system boots in text mode?

Then you can run DM/DE manually when needed = Use 'startx' /etc. To return machine to console and exit X server completely after this, just use 'log out'.\nOther dm .confs scripts are similar.\n(I setup my server like this.. to be able to work using a GUI occasionally - but, not pull resources when not using/needed or simply rebooting.)\n\nEDIT\n(My current system: Upstart 1.12.1 / Ubuntu 14.04)\nDue to upstart the way to resolve this lately is to simply disable your Display Manager from starting on boot:\n\necho  \"manual\" | sudo tee -a /etc/init/{service}.override\n\nFor lightdm:\n echo  \"manual\" | sudo tee -a /etc/init/lightdm.override\n\nThis can be any service in /etc/init including kdm/gdm. 'startx' to run as needed following a reboot.\nref:\nHow to disable lightdm?\nHow to enable or disable services?\n\nA: Installing the GUI will probably cause it to start automatically, but it's very easy to boot to text mode in Ubuntu. Just open /etc/default/grub as root and add text to the\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\n\nline. Then run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nYour system will then always boot to text mode.\nIf you want to boot to the GUI, just press e in the boot menu and remove text from the kernel line.\nIf you want to start the GUI after boot, just run:\nsudo /etc/init.d/lightdm start\n\nHope this helps :)\n\nA: Edit /etc/default/grub with your favourite editor, e.g. nano:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nFind this line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nChange it to:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\"\n\nUpdate GRUB:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nFor systems that use systemd\nThis is an additional step for systemd releases, e.g. Ubuntu 15.04, the steps above for grub are still necessary.\nYou need to tell systemd to not load the graphical login manager:\nsudo systemctl enable multi-user.target --force\nsudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target\n\nYou will still be able to use X by typing startx after you logged in.\n\nA: For 11.04 and previous versions (and perhaps later)\nIf you want to boot into text mode:\nEdit /etc/default/grub. For example:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nFind this line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nAdd text:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash text\"\n\nThen update Grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNote:\nRemoving quiet splash (i.e. GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\") will show text during boot but then show a graphical login screen as usual. Replacing quiet splash with text will leave you at a login prompt; to start a GNOME session, use sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start or startx.\nTo disable GDM:\nInstall bum .\nAfter installation it will be found under System>>Administration>>Bootup-Manager\nUncheck Gnome Display Manager\n\n\nA: If you are using lightdm as a login manager it can be prevented from loading by disabling it.\nYou can use an override:\nsudo bash -c 'echo \"manual\" >> /etc/init/lightdm.override'\n\nAnd to start lightdm on command:\nsudo start lightdm\n\nTo restore your system so that lightdm is always started on boot:\nsudo rm /etc/init/lightdm.override\n\nFor more information, the upstart cookbook is your friend:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/\n\nA: You could use Ubuntu Server edition.\n\nA: I did following:\n\n\n*\n\n*First update your repository by running\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*There is some bug in old version of lightdm, so we need to upgrade\nthe same. To do so run,\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\n\n\n*Now we have to modify grub config.\nOpen /etc/default/grub with your favorite editor and change\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\"\n\nAlso comment GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 This line is for unhiding the GRUB menu\n\n*Now we will upgrade GRUB configuration\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n*Now restart your machine.\n\nA: The steps are:\nCustomize the grub 2 configuration:\n\n*\n\n*sudo nano /etc/default/grub, to open the file with root privilege,\n\nFind the line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash”\n\nand change it to\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”text”\n\nSave the changes (hit ctrl + o followed by ENTER) and close the file (ctrl + x).\nTo apply the new configuration do this\n\n*\n\n*sudo update-grub\nNow restart your PC\n\n*\n\n*sudo reboot\nThere you are... A text-graphic login screen... Supply your credentials to log-in to the tty (default tty1). You can change the tty's with crtl + alt + [F1 to F6] for tty1 to tty6. You may also start the X session (X11 session), the graphical user interface, with sudo start lightdm (ctrl + alt + F7).\n\nPS: In case you want to revert the changes you've made here follow the link:\nHow to revert back to GUI as the default interface from CLI in Ubuntu desktop?\n\nA: If using Lubuntu 15.05 with systemd managing boot processes it is possible to boot to the console and then later from the console start the graphical environment.  Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*follow the previously mentioned edits to grub per Bruno:\nEdit /etc/default/grub with your favorite editor, eg: nano:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nFind out this line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nChange it to:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\"\n\nUpdate Grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n*Bruno suggested sudo systemctl enable multi-user.target --force.  The use of force bothered me so I preferred  sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target.\nopen a terminal and do sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target\n\n*reboot will take you into console asking for password\n\n*when desiring to enter graphical environment enter sudo systemctl start lightdm.  You will be taken to the lightdm login window.\n\n*use ctrl alt F1 key combo to get back to console you were at to exit out if so desired.  (I exit out of the console mode as I am usually done there till next boot) \nctrl alt F7 to get back to lightdm login.  or ctrl alt F1 through F7 per need or desire.\n\nA: You may also want to prevent the kernel from changing video modes which can be problematic, especially if you cannot see the login prompt or it is partially off the screen. Add the setting GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset\" to /etc/default/grub:\n#GRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\n#GRUB_TIMEOUT=5\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\n#for text mode boot up... and also uncomment the \"console\" terminal\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset\"\n#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"text\"\nGRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\nAnd then run the command\nsudo update-grub\n\nTested with Ubuntu Server 16.04.1\n\nA: It has already beed answered in several old questions, but cannot find them just now, so I sum up the various situations here.\n\n\n*\n\n*To stop an X server started by startx, simply terminate the session.\n\n*To stop an X server started by the Login Manager (GDM), run\nsudo service gdm stop\n\nthen move to a tty, for example pressing Ctrl-Alt-F1, then login here in text mode.\n\n*To avoid at all the starting of the Login Manager (and X), modify\n/etc/default/grub\n\nchanging the line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto become\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash text\"\n\nthen update the grub configuration file with\nsudo update-grub\n\nso that the next time you go directly to text mode, and you need startx to initiate a X session, or alternatively sudo service gdm start.\n\nA: When you install Ubuntu-desktop, it will automatically set lightdm to start with the system. You will have to disable this (probably by editing /etc/rc.local) and use startx to run the graphical interface when you need it.\n\nA: Just a report on Lubuntu 18.04.3 LTS.\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nThen change the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\" and run\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis correctly sets up text mode of booting. Very useful, I can track and spot problems without going into log files.\nsystemctl get-default \n\nThis outputs graphical.target and please note it for future restoring original state.\nsudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target \n\nThis switched off GUI of XWindows (lightdm and startx, openbox, etc.), but I had to type 3 times my login/password to boot into Xwindows:\nA) login\nB) sudo lightdm # starts xwindows with my default setting (which is good)\nC) regular GUI login dialog of Lubuntu.\nThree logins are annoying, but it works OK otherwise.\nRestore original setting:\n sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target\n\nHopefully this will be useful to someone. :-)\n\nA: This is a slightly different method to set autologin for lightdm so you don't have to enter a password to log into the graphical session. However, it should be noted that google chrome will ask for your password only once, the first time after you login, to unlock your keyring.\nFirst, edit /etc/default/grub and change:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\"\n\nSave the file when you are finished and then run the following command to update grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNext, install lightdm and libpam-gnome-keyring so you only have to enter the password the first time you start google chrome after you login:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install lightdm libpam-gnome-keyring\n\nThen, run the following command to set autologin for your current user on lightdm:\nprintf \"[SeatDefaults]\\nautologin-user=$USER\\n\" | sudo tee -a /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nSave any unsaved work and reboot.\nFinally, when you want to start a graphical session, run the following command to start lightdm:\nsudo systemctl start lightdm\n\n", "Q: Connect to network before user login As a learning experiment, I'm trying to turn Ubuntu Desktop into a server.

Writing a commercial proposal, I want to create a nice graphic showing the clients the architecture I thought of for their IT network, with servers, network connections, firewall, load-balancing, etc.\nFor years I have been using dia, but I am tired of it because: the results are not satisfying, very few network elements are available, and each element's graphic representation is really ugly.\nQuestion: How to create nice network diagrams?\nIf a better set of elements was available for dia, that would be a solution.\n\nA: I still find dia to be a great option, and I'm curious to know why you find that the network diagrams don't look adequate. \nIn my experience, there are a large number of traditional network diagram shapes such as the conceptual drawings for routers, switches, etc., as they are used on documentation (like what comes from Cisco)... and it looks just the same. Please let us know what you find is missing in Dia, so that someone can go ahead and create the shapes we may all find really useful :)\nThere are, admittedly, a number of issues with connecting things and other aspects of using dia that are different if you come from a Microsoft Visio background, but to me, it still seems to work great.  When I researched it, it was still the best diagram editor around for this type of work.\nAs far as I know, all the elements I described there are available in the stock dia. You will want to look for the shape sheets with names starting with \"Cisco\".\n\nA: I recently found a Dia package called gnomeDIAicons and although not a large set of icons they do look good.\nHere's an example I just put together:\n\nTo install, download the archive and in the terminal:\ncd /usr/share/dia/\nsudo tar xf ~/Downloads/rib-network-v0.1.tar.gz\n\nIn case you are using Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, 17.10 or 18.04,  the package dia-rib-network is available (see here). You can install it with:\nsudo apt install dia-rib-network\n\nThen open Dia and choose the RIB-Network sheet.\n\nA: Another tool to create nice network diagrams in real 3D is MaSSHandra.\nIt has all Cisco symbols as a external download and includes autodiscovery and access features inside the diagrams. It's free and you can see how it works before install it from here.\n\nMaSSHandra web site\n\nA: An alternative to Cacoo might also be Gliffy, although I'm not certain what their shape/stencil support is like though.  Worth a look nonetheless.\n\nA: Though may seem like an odd choice, I find inkscape to be a great tool for diagramming, particularly network diagramming.   Its output is svg, making it very portable and attractively rendered.  And underneath, there is xml -- which you can manipulate programmatically (e.g., parse, search, edit, or even tie into other data sources for descriptions or other variable attributes).  And it is Open Source. \nBy the way, here are the Cisco stencils, for those who might be interested.  Formats include svg, jpg, bmp, tif, eps, wmf.\n\nA: kivio  is a diagramming application within koffice (the office suite of KDE) called kivio, which comes with a set of stencils for different types of diagrams. Additional stencils can be purchased, but the program itself has the basic set. NB: Kivio is now called 'Flow', and is part of the Calligra office suite 3.\nJgraph is Java based and it is a commercial product. But it has a free version for basic use.\nSee the screenshots of kivio here\n\nA: I agree that the in-built shapes in Dia are a bit aesthetically lacking. To come up with a solution, I have taken the VRT Shape Gallery linked to in this answer and exported them from LibreOffice to SVG files and to Dia sheets. I've created a Git repo for it with installation instructions for Dia:\nhttps://github.com/jb-stack/Dia-vrt-sheets\nI've been using them and found it offers a nice compromise between Dia's easy to use diagramming features and VRT's nice looking shapes.\n\nA: I use the graphviz utility, but it is not for the faint of heart. It has a steep learning curve, but I am satisfied with the results I get.\n\nA: Try these LibreOffice/OpenOffice galleries with Draw: http://www.vrt.com.au/downloads/vrt-network-equipment \nCC licensed, also available in Fedora repos and the libreoffice extensions site.\nUPDATE:  v1.1 release added new darker variants (like VMware's shapes), and a set logical network symbols added - now near 200 symbols in 5 gallery themes.\n\n\nA: Inkscape is all you need. For additional clip art graphics ('elements'), use openclipart.org. OpenClipart is actually built into Inkscape these days. There's really no need to resort to non-free apps.\n\nA: I decided to move my diagrams to the cloud after I saw Cacoo. It's a very intuitive tool, having a lot of diagram and icons choices and mostly it has options for online collaboration. The only downside is that is a proprietary software :/\nHere is my sample\n\nA: By looking in the Dia official FAQ, I discovered there is a way to extend Dia and its elements set.\n\nExtending Dia\nQ: How do I add new shapes/sheets?  A:\n  An explanation is given in\n  doc/custom-shapes in the source\n  distribution on how the shape format\n  works. However, Dia now also has the\n  capability of exporting a diagram as a\n  shape. Each collection of shapes\n  (called a sheet) should be kept\n  together in a subdirectory of\n  ~/.dia/shapes, e.g,\n  ~/.dia/shapes/Engines. To make a\n  shape, first design it in Dia. Then\n  export it into your subdirectory. Two\n  files will be generated, a .shape file\n  and a .png file (the icon).\nFrom version 0.90 and up, Dia features\n  a Sheets and Objects editor which will\n  allow you to load the shape into a\n  sheet. It will also update Dia's\n  loaded objects on the fly.\nIf you still want to do things by\n  hand, update the corresponding sheet\n  file in ~/.dia/sheets, in this case\n  called Engines.sheet. Example contents\n  of a sheet file is:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"iso-8859-1\"?> <!-- -*- xml -*- -->\n\n<sheet xmlns=\"http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia-sheet-ns\">\n  <name>Engines</name>\n  <description>Mechanical Engines</description>\n  <contents>\n    <object name=\"Engines - Gas\">\n      <description>A gas engine</description>\n    </object>\n  </contents>\n</sheet>\n\n\nEach new object should be added to the\n  sheet by adding an object section.\n  Next time you restart Dia, the new\n  objects should show up in the list of\n  sheets.\n\nSo I suggest you to add your own shapes to Dia and live happily:)\n\nA: yED Graph Editor is a desktop application that can be used to quickly and effectively generate high-quality diagrams.

What are the steps that I want to follow to get Ubuntu membership? I know contribution is the only mantra to get Ubuntu membership. I am not good in programming so what are other ways to contribute to the Ubuntu community to get membership?\n\nA: Helping with documentation is one way. Another way is to do translation work. Your profile says you're in India, so if you're fluent in any Indian language (or any other language for that matter) then translation work would certainly be helpful.\n\nA: As the wiki page on membership notes, \"membership of the Ubuntu community means recognition of a significant and sustained contribution to Ubuntu and the Ubuntu community.\" These contributions can come in various forms. Some gain their membership through technical contributions (i.e. packaging programs or working on various quality assurance tasks). Yet many more become Ubuntu Members through other contributions. Some work on documentation or translations. Some contribute by providing community support on the Ubuntu Forums, in IRC channels, and even right here on Ask Ubuntu. Others contribute through marketing and advocacy, in their communities through LoCo Teams and on-line. Most have some combination of all of these.\n\"Sustained contribution\" has generally meant at least six months or one full development cycle.\nJust as there are many ways to contribute, there are different ways to apply for membership as well. Most will apply for membership through the regional membership boards. Though if you contributions are more technical and you seek upload rights to the Ubuntu archive, you will likely want to go through the Developer Membership Board. Some communities within Ubuntu, like the  Kubuntu Council and the Edubuntu Council, have been delegated the authority to confer membership to those whose contributions are mostly in their area.\n\n\nA: There is a wiki page telling you exactly what to do: See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership and follo the instructions below \"Procedure for Obtaining Membership\".\nThere are various ways to contribute to Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Organise events\n\n*Support Ubuntu booths on fairs\n\n*Give speeches (or lectures)\n\n*Help people with Ubuntu\n\n*write documentation\n\n\nA: If you're not good at programming, then you can always help to triage bugs by evaluating them as they're reported and processing them into the system so that programmers can spend more time fixing them and less time figuring out if they're actually valid bugs. A great place to do this is on the One Hundred Paper Cuts project since those bugs have a very strict definition and since their usability bugs, rather than technical bugs, you don't need to be familiar with the code base of the package in question.\nThe wiki page on Ubuntu Membership states that applicants must make a 'sizable and sustained contribution' to the Ubuntu project in order to be approved for membership. If you want some sort of benchmark for what is required, imagine doing 5 hours of work a week for around 6 months (that's the example I was given when I asked Jono Bacon about it at his weekly Q&A on Ustream).\nThe reason for this is that they don't want people coming along and burning themselves out after a couple of weeks of nonstop contribution and never being heard from again. If this happens, the effort the rest of the community had to put in to bring this person up to speed on what's going would be wasted, and whatever project they joined would have had to slow down a little bit while they settled in and learned the ropes, and that would have gone to waste also.\n\nA: See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership\n\n\"Contributions are valued and recognised whether you contribute to artwork, any of the LoCoTeams, documentation, the forums, the answers tracker, IRC support, bug triage, translation, development and packaging, marketing and advocacy or anything else.\"\n\n\nA: You can also obtain membership via forums participation\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Forums/Membership\nAnd I suggested a route via aksubuntu participation on meta, perhaps you could model an option similar to the forums ;)\nHas there been any suggestion to encourage AU members to become Ubuntu Members?\n", "Q: control keys produce ascii output in Vi insert mode When I enter  mode in vim, all control keys (like arrow keys, delete keys etc.) produce characters instead of expected control behaviour.

It doesn't seem to be reliable - but it basically works. With an appindicator.Indicator, it doesn't work. The entry just stays empty. Even if you set the child[border_size] to 32, for example.\nThe only widget that works is a gtk.Label (plus the MenuItem, ImageMenuItem and so on of course).\nNow the Me Menu has got a gtk.Entry in it, so it must surely be possible to do this Properly. How do I do it?\nHere's some example code to explain what I'm on about:\n    self.item = gtk.MenuItem()\n    self.item.add(gtk.Label(\"hello world!\"))\n    self.menu.append(self.item)\n\nThe above code works, this however doesn't:\n    self.item = gtk.MenuItem()\n    self.item.add(gtk.Entry())\n    self.menu.append(self.item)\n\nWhere self.menu is an appindicator.Indicator, if it were a gtk.Menu, the Entry would be at least displayed.\nHere's some working code:\nimport gtk\nimport appindicator\n\nclass AppIndicator (object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.ind = appindicator.Indicator(\"hello world client\",\n            \"distributor-logo\", appindicator.CATEGORY_APPLICATION_STATUS)\n        self.ind.set_status (appindicator.STATUS_ACTIVE)\n        self.menu = gtk.Menu()\n        item = gtk.MenuItem()\n\n        item.add(gtk.Label(\"hello world\"))\n        # item.add(gtk.Entry())\n\n        self.menu.append(item)\n        self.menu.show_all()\n        self.ind.set_menu(self.menu)\n\n\nindicator = AppIndicator()\ngtk.main()\n\n\nA: The Application Indicator menu support is based on D-Bus menus, which are limited in what they support - they only support basic menu functionality, not more exotic things such as arbitrary widgets.\nOne significant roadblock to them ever supporting such things is the fact that the application indicator menu is rendered by a different process, the application indicator process, so your program doesn't have access to directly draw anything on it.  Overcoming this would require either supporting something like X-Embed in D-Bus menus or allowing all of GTK to work over D-Bus.\n\nA: The sound indicator in Ubuntu has sliders for the volume and I wondered how that is possible. After a look in the code it seems there are GtkMenus which can be filled via dbus meanwhile:\nhttps://developer.ubuntu.com/api/devel/ubuntu-12.04/c/dbusmenugtk/index.html\nBut I don't know how to use them.\nWanted to write a sound indicator where I can control the volume per-app just like pavucontrol can do it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Shuttle XS35 What Ubuntu features do and which do not work on your Shuttle XS35 barebone mini-pc? In the spirit of this question, add your experience, good or bad, with this fanless, i.e. passively cooled, small-form-factor computer, based on Intel's Atom, to this community wiki.\n\nA: I bought a Shuttle XS35 specifically to use as a media centre for my lounge room.\nInstallation of Ubuntu 10.10 was a breeze up until it was time to reboot.\nThe eject button on the DVD Drive did not work so I rebooted anyway without removing install disc.\nAfter reboot, the eject would still not work, it just made a soft screeching type sound.\nTrying to run the \"eject\" command from the console gave the same response.\nI managed to get it open using a pin in the \"emergency eject\" pinhole of the drive.\nNow eject seems to work normally - strange.\nNext thing I found is that Ubuntu would not auto-detect my Wireless LAN.\nThis seems to be a problem in BIOS 1.08 as shipped with the box (as mentioned above).\nBIOS 1.08 offers the following options for \"Wireless Power Control\": \"Disabled\", or \"Switch by AP\".\nNow according to ubuntuforums posts, this can be fixed by flashing to BIOS 1.09 and selecting the new option of \"Always On\".\nI have yet to try this as BIOS 1.09 has been removed from the Shuttle website.\nI tried installing and running XBMC before I had installed the proprietary NVidia drivers to see how it would fare on ION without GPU acceleration - it was completely unusable.\nFortunately installing the NVidia proprietary drivers was straightforward and now XBMC works with no performance issues.\nWith default install my MCE compatible remote control had some buttons working and others not.\nAfter installing lirc and configuring it for my device (a single drop-down during install), it is working a charm! \nI am puzzled that it partly worked at all without lirc ... ?\nIn summary, so far everything has been awesome except the wireless problem, which is a serious pain.\n\nA: Here's a copy of the 1.09 bios you need to get the wifi to work. It's been working for me for the past few months, although it drops the signal way too frequently. Reconnecting to the router via the menu bar icon works.\n\nA: Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (x86_64) on XS35GT, wired Ethernet. (no WLAN needed)\nDug out my old 2011 Shuttle XS35GT w/win7 in order to re-commission it as a openHAB server.\nSince it going to be tucked away on my LAN, I opted for Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS\nSince I was sent on a wild goose chase with issues concerning previous Ubuntu versions, I just want to share my experience so that others might save some time.\nThe installation process fails to find any network devices, but fear not, just continue until finished.\nMy mistake was that, based on previous issues others had in the past, I thought I needed to updated jme driver and the latest BIOS for the Shuttle. This is not the case. Shuttle BIOS 1.08, and the jme driver that comes with the install  (v1.0.8) turned out to work OK.\nIt all boils to setting up the interface.\nStart with:\n$ networkctl\nWARNING: systemd-networkd is not running, output will be incomplete.\n\nIDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL SETUP\n  1 lo               loopback           n/a         unmanaged\n  2 enp2s0f5         ether              n/a         unmanaged\n  3 wlp3s0           wlan               n/a         unmanaged\n\n3 links listed.\n\nNote that the expected eth0 is now history and is replaced by enp2s0f5 in my case.\nAlso note that the WLAN interface is found, but I did not pursue it as I prefer my server wired.\nNext set up the interface with a static IP, good for servers:\n$ cat /etc/network/interfaces\n# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system\n# and how to activate them.

The nouveau driver worked well enough to cover the installation, but I suspect that it was the cause of a crash and that switching drivers improved stability.\n\nA: Sadly the wireless does not work out of the box. On the server editions the ethernet is not detected either. I have seen posts on getting the wireless working with a flash of the bois but I still haven't managed to get this working even with the new bois.\n\nA: I own a Shuttle XS36V that I installed 11.10 on.  In the bare-bones machine I put 2G of RAM and a cheap Seagate Momentus 250G HD.  I prefer using the last x.10 version, even though 12.4 exists.  \nI used pendrivelinux Universal USB Installer to mount the iso to a thumb drive, stuck it in, booted to the BIOS screen using F2, set the thumb drive (detected) to boot order 1, rebooted, chose to run Ubuntu off the USB, then finally installed from inside it the running OS.  \nI then installed LAMP, PHPMyAdmin, and VSFTP (good instructions here).  It works fine as a remote development server.  I have it in my cubicle and me and the other web developer like it.  I have a keyboard and monitor, and it seems as fast as any other machine I have used when doing typical desktop stuff.  \nBoth RAM and CPU seem to use about 1/4 capacity and remote PHP development does almost nothing to spike these resources.  Plus, I have to say, this mini computers is cool.  No fan, so it is dead silent, and barely warm.\n", "Q: How to get my software into Ubuntu? As a developer of free software, I want to get my application into Ubuntu.\nShould I provide a source tarball and ask for packaging? Or should I create a package myself? Should I target Ubuntu directly, or should I try to get into Debian and then into Ubuntu automatically?\n\nA: While getting into the default Ubuntu repositories is hard and might not be right for your project (At least yet), you can set up a project in Launchpad and set up a PPA there so they can install it via PPA. More on that in the Launchpad help sections, particularly here.\n\nA: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages details the normal process for including packages into Ubuntu.\nThere are often a lot of packages awaiting review on the REVU site, which is a reason why we suggest that packages are uploaded to Debian, where they can benefit even more people.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Debian/ForUbuntuDevelopers#Getting_new_software_in_Debian explains how this can be done.\nFor Ubuntu, you can ask people for reviews on #ubuntu-motu on irc.ubuntu.com, and for Debian there is a #debian-mentors channel on irc.oftc.net.\nAlternatively, there is a developer.ubuntu.com page which details a separate process of getting applications reviewed & published for stable releases. \n\nA: Background\nUbuntu doesn't allow upload of binary packages, but only source packages which are build by build servers.\nGetting your packages directly in Ubuntu repositories is not so easy. It is recommended to have it first in Debian and get it synced from there. So for now you can put it there in your PPA. You can create a PPA with your Launchpad account.\nUploading to PPA\nIf you used debuild to build the package, then your work is a bit more easier. debuild generates many files including .dsc and .changes\nYou might have used .dsc file with pbuilder-dist to create the deb file, so now all you need to do is to publish it to a PPA for now. Use\n\ndput ppa:yourlaunchpadusername/ppaname foo.changes\n\nYou will need to sign the package before upload with the same key as you have uploaded in your Launchpad Account\nPushing in Debian/Ubuntu\nThe pushing of your package in Ubuntu/Debian repositories includes a review from the maintainer and the ftp masters at Debian. The license has to be very clear with no ambiguity. You might need a sponsor for uploading to Debian\nFiling an ITP\nYou might need to file an ITP (Intend to package) to get it packaged in Debian. This is just a formal procedure.\nWhen the package is available in experimental/unstable then you can use requestsync tool to file a sync request on LP. For getting requestsync working you need to run manage-credentials to login to Launchpad\nBoth of these tools are in package ubuntu-dev-tools\n\nA: Well, first I would suggest that you put the source into a Launchpad repository.\nThen you can put the package in your PPA and distribute it.\nAs for getting it included in the official repository... it really depends on the app.\nPer duanedesign's comment, this page can help get you started and this page can help with some common upload errors. \n\nA: There are a number of paths that a package can take to enter Ubuntu. The overview of Ubuntu development targeted at \"upstream\" developers like yourself might be a useful place to start, but I'll try to give you some pointers as well.\nThrough Debian\nGenerally, if you are publishing free and open source software going through Debian first is the best path. This way ensures that your package will have a dedicated maintainer. It also will reach the largest number of users as it will be available in not just Debian and Ubuntu but all of their derivatives as well. Some useful links for requesting/providing new packages in Debian:\n\n\n*\n\n*Work-Needing and Prospective\nPackages - Information on how to\nfile \"Intent to Package\" and \"Request\nfor Package\" bugs as well as list of\nopen ITPs and RFPs. \n\n*Debian Mentors\nFAQ - debian-mentors is for the\nmentoring of new and prospective\nDebian Developers. It is where you can\nfind a sponsor to upload your package to the archive.\n\n*Debian Developer's Reference - Debian Developer's Reference's section on new packages. The entire document is invaluable for both Ubuntu and Debian packagers.\nDirectly into Ubuntu\nIn some cases, it might make sense to go directly into Ubuntu first. Some helpful links:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu App Developer site - for lightweight desktop applications, you can submit them directly on the My Apps section of developer.ubuntu.com, the App Review Board will review them and they will be published in the Software Center.\n\n*Packaging Guide - an introduction to how to package for Ubuntu.\n\n*REVU - a web-based tool to which Ubuntu contributors can upload new packages for review by Ubuntu Developers for inclusion into Ubuntu.\n\n*Sponsorship Process - After entering Ubuntu, you can maintain your package through the sponsorship process.\nPersonal Package Archives\nBeyond the official Ubuntu and Debian channels, Launchpad offers you the ability to distribute Debian packages directly to your users through its Personal Package Archives or PPAs for short. One particularly useful aspect of a PPA is that you can provide daily builds of your software for testing purposes.\n\nA: You can wait for some time because the Ubuntu devs have set up a new repository for Ubuntu 10.10 called extras.ubuntu.com for application developers to submit packages.The app will have to pass through application review first though.\n", "Q: Better drivers for SiS 650/740 integrated video?

I've read somewhere that I can use openvz templates with lxc or libvirt. How can I do this?\nI'm doing all this on a dedicated server, so I can't access it by hand, only ssh, plus on my local pc running Ubuntu Desktop Maverick everything works.\nEDIT\nGetting closer, I managed to understand how to use an openvz template with lxc, now the problem comes with the network bridge:\n\nlxc-start: invalid interface name: br0 # Use same bridge device used in your controlling host setup\nlxc-start: failed to process 'lxc.network.link = br0 # Use same bridge device used in your controlling host setup'\nlxc-start: failed to read configuration file\n\n\nI followed the exact steps to create a bridge and lxc conf looks like:\nlxc.network.type = veth\nlxc.network.flags = up\nlxc.network.link = br0 # Use same bridge device used in your controlling host setup\nlxc.network.hwaddr =  {a1:b2:c3:d4:e5:f6} # As appropiate (line only needed if you wish to dhcp later)\nlxc.network.ipv4 = {10.0.0.100} # (Use 0.0.0.0 if you wish to dhcp later)\nlxc.network.name = eth0 # could likely be whatever you want\n\nSince it's not working, I know smth is wrong so could somebody guide me ?\nEDIT: looks like the base install was using a custom kernel (bzImage-2.6.34.6-xxxx-grs-ipv6-65) for which I didn't find the headers. I did an update-grub after I installed a new kernel, edited menu.lst and now it's using 2.6.35-23-server and now debootstrap is working just fine (same as ubuntu-vm-builder).\n\nA: This command worked for me:\nsudo lxc-create -n my-vm -t ubuntu\n\nbut I didn't generally find that lxc was very mature.  Using kvm:\nvm-builder kvm ubuntu\n\nPerhaps the simplest solution is: download an Ubuntu ISO, run virt-manager, create a VM through the GUI, attach the ISO to the CD drive, then boot it and install in the usual way.\n", "Q: How can I run gedit with a different configuration I want to use gedit as a programming IDE and as a regular text editor. Would I be able to make some .desktop file to load a different configuration?\n\nA: It doesn't seem to be supported right now, see this upstream bug report.\nHowever, you could create a wrapper for gedit, that sets the specific plugins you want via gconftool-2.\nThis would look something like:\n#!/bin/bash\nold_config=$(gconftool-2 --get \"/apps/gedit-2/plugins/active-plugins\")\ngconftool-2 --set --type list --list-type string \"/apps/gedit-2/plugins/active-plugins\" \"[$1]\"\ngedit\ngconftool-2 --set --type list --list-type string \"/apps/gedit-2/plugins/active-plugins\" \"$old_config\"\n\nNow save this somewhere as eg. gedit_profile and make it executable:\nchmod +x  gedit_profile\n\nTo load different profiles, just call it with a comma-separated list of plugins you want to enable, for example:\n/path/to/gedit_profile \"terminal,colorpicker\"\n\n[Of course you then can put this into separate launchers.]\n", "Q: Apple G4 733Mhz and 512Mb Ram... Any suggestions on what to use for good performance? I'd like to install Ubuntu on this little g4 I've found...\nI hope to get a better performance than Os X 10.4, is it possible?\nI thought about using a server minimal install and then put on it gnome, xfce, lxde and fluxbox to find out the best user experience / performance ratio.\nAny ideas or experiences about such kind of G4?\n\nA: Xubuntu or Lubuntu might go good on this. Give a few live cds a try. I certainly know Ubuntu will run however it might not be very reactive. Stuff will still get done fast though you might spend some time waiting for firefox to come up. :)\n\nA: It's a G4, so a powerpc processor (ppc). Most distributions have either a current version or older version that works with ppc. Ubuntu itself has a ppc version, however it's a bit larger than a single cd, so you'll need a dvd to install it. I've never tried to work with Ubuntu PPC because of the dvd thing (we don't have dvds where I might be putting ubuntu on a ppc computer).\nArch also has a ppc flavor, again, I've never used Arch before, so I don't know if it's any good or not.\n\nI have tried to get Arch running on a Power Mac G4. I couldn't get the computer to read my disk, but this might have been a combination of using a bad type of disk and not burning it correctly. I'm going to try again soon (Thursday), I'll attempt to report my efforts if you want.\n\nA: Having as much as 512MB RAM means that Ubuntu will install using the normal Live CD. Ubuntu doesn't officially support the PPC architecture any more, but most software from the current release should work fine. Debian still has PPC among its official targets.\nGenerally I think the CPU power will be sufficient for many tasks, including web browsing (minus Flash videos) and watching movies. As to comparative performance relative to OS X, only a test will tell. Ubuntu - and Linux in general - has the advantage, though, that you have more ways of influencing the configuration, such as using a lighter window manager and disabling desktop effects.\n\nA: As for using a lighter window manager, try using the LXDE GUI interface.  It runs lighter than Gnome & even XFCE.  \nIt should install from the repositories & give you an option to use LXDE at login. \nI would not recommend Lubuntu as is fairly new to the scene.  I run Xubuntu with the LXDE GUI on a PIII with good results.\n\nA: I have my own answer too :D\nI think the best (speaking of performance / usability) will be lubuntu or..\nThis little guy:\nhttp://macpup.org/ (now it works with ubuntu packages too :D)\nI'll keep you posted :)\n\nA: I've installed, and now I'm writing from an iMac G4 with 2 GB of RAM (but I've started from 512MB and it was ok) it's a 1,2 Ghz CPU.\nUbuntu 10.04 LT installs really fine with absolute no problems...LiveCD works greats.\nInterface is reactive.\nI found very big problems using Internet with flash due to here flash is provided by GNU/Gnash and to me let the CPU to 100%.\nI think in my case 10.04 is mature for production on iMac G4.\nIf you can, where is possible, I advice you to compile application trying different performance options and test differences.\nYou can just directly install the standard Ubuntu release and then install LXDE packages and do the right login on GDM.\nPcmanFM as a desktop manager (replacing nautilus) is very light I'm using it everyday, but it's not strictly necessary, you can just switch off the desktop manager and browse files directly with PCmanFM file manager when you need.\nYou need to focus all resources to the focused application under your eyes (i.e Firefox) using one application at time when is possible.\nFirefox is very hungry at all for a 700Mhz CPU (the RAM it's ok), just try to use a tab with gmail and tons of mail in it with a tab of Facebook you'll see that something wrong will be happen near...\nReduce to the minimum the use of swap with the swappiness option...the disk is a very bad bottleneck.\nIf you can, upgrade the RAM to the maximum possible with the speediest RAM possible, this make the difference...I did it these days upgrading to 2GB...applications thanks for this...today oldest RAM are cheap to buy new...\nDo not hesitate to contact me privately for more information about my experience...\n", "Q: Migrating from Mac to Ubuntu, What will I miss? this is my first question (in askubuntu).\nI'm about to try Ubuntu for the first time (First time to take it seriously actually).\nI love my Mac but don't want to be closed minded, nor closed source ;)\nSo, if I go ahead with this change, where would you say I would feel the difference?\nPitfalls of Ubuntu compared to Mac? (honestly)\nWhat will I miss the most?\nThanks in advance!!\n\nRelated: Difference between mac os and linux\n\nA: You will probably miss the comfort of having everything just ready to work and working. Mac OS is a perfect OS, it's beautiful and it just works. But you have to follow Apple's rules. \nUnlike with Ubuntu, you have to pay for most of the best software (although there are some open source or free alternatives for MacOS, too). Unlike Ubuntu, you can't choose your desktop environment. Ok, maybe you don't need to, the original one is quite nice. But it's a compromise between what Apple thinks you need and what you really need. Unlike with Ubuntu, where you can configure almost everything to your needs. You can even configure it to look like a Mac and behave almost like a Mac.\nAnd I'm sure you will not miss:\n- The need to buy a new OS each time a major upgrade occurs\n- The feeling of having an outdated hardware, Apple is an expert in making you feel that your two or five years old computer is garbage and you have to buy a new one to have the shinny new things that the shiny new cat has to offer. And we are talking about Apple's own hardware! A wonderful and powerfull computer like a last generation PowerMac G5 won't run Snow Leopard! But you can run perfectly the latest (11.10) Ubuntu on a 10 years old power pc properly upgraded with processor and memory.\nSo, there is not much to miss\nMaybe some software which only runs in Mac's, like OmniOutliner.\nI'm a big fan of Mac OS but, honestly, with the development and growth of Linux, especially Ubuntu, Mac OS is becoming a useless luxury.\n\nA: OK I will give a short answer as it is late and I fancy a Haiku\nSomethings will not work out of the box.\nYou will have to find a solution to get it to work.\nYou will get a huge feeling of satisfaction that you got everything to work and you will now have a deeper understanding of the workings of your computer.\nYou will feel like you are the master of your computer not it of you\nTrufa San\nSo I'm not being completely serious but really MAC's are perfectly built machines running a perfectly built OS like getting a perfect scale model of Titanic pretty to look at but boring after a while Ubuntu and other linuxses are like a Lego kit for the Titanic or anything else your imagination can stretch to.\nI'm sure others will be able to give you a more detailed explanation of the differences but I thought I give you the metaphysical perspective.\n\nA: You will miss your digital photography apps.\nI am actually considering switching to OS X because of that, and I love Ubuntu.\n\nA: I've been an *nix user for years and have used Ubuntu for simplicities sake on all my notebooks from the last 3 years or so (everything.. just works!).  My current job provided me with a shiny new MacbookPro when I started just over a year ago, great hardware (almost no complaints), but OSX lasted about a month on it.\nTo get to the point (sorry about the lenghty diatribe), I've found very FEW issues with the switch, however:\n\n\n*\n\n*the setup is a little more\ncomplicated than a similar spec\nDell/Thinkpad/etc, it's not too hard\nthough \n\n*the Mac's greatest asset, by\nfar, is the Trackpad, the new\nmultitouch driver (check\nwww.ubuntuforums.org) are almost\nthere, but its not quite as silky\nsmooth as in OSX\n\n\nOn the good side:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compiz is a beautiful, beautiful\nthing (I turn most of the 3D effects\noff), it combines a great way of\napplying keyboard/mouse/gesture\nshortcuts to enhance window\nmanagement and common, often\nlaborious tasks with some great\neyecandy (if you're that way\ninclined).\n\n*4GB RAM goes a whole lot further in Ubuntu/Gnome than it ever went in MacOSX, I can code, browse, listen, watch, game all without issue.\n\n*Ubuntu's package management, APT, and\nthe new Ubuntu Software Centre is\ngreat for keeping software up to\ndate, and allows the installation of\nnew apps easily, ironically enough\nits becoming more and more like the\nApple App Store by the day.\n\n\nThe pitfalls would be the lack of some software like Photoshop (and the Adobe Suite), Microsoft Office (though 2008 was terrible in my experience compared to the Windows version) and many games, but coming from Mac, you probably wouldn't many anyway.\nFinally, I'd say, give it a go, at least in a dual boot situation, what have you got to lose?\n\nA: For me it was OSX Services, like the ability to spell check anywhere. Or how most text edit boxes have outline mode, system key bindings and the ability to accept the output of an any service.\n\nA: I'm totally agree with other answers, but on ubuntu is very difficult to find software like imovie or finalcut. Oss video editing software are not the same. \nAnd multitouch experience isn't the same. \n", "Q: Roll-your-own mysql-server (.deb) files and MySQL root password I know I can make my own .deb files of an installation.

(3.16.1)\n\nThis main purpose of specifying this is so that users may find the location of the data files for particular\n  service, and so that services which require a single tree for readonly data, writable data and scripts\n\n(my emphasis)\nNote: 'Served by the system' doesn't necessarily refer to the Internet. It needn't even mean a network. It's applicable to even a shared system. Further, the words site and service should be understood in their pre-internet meanings. Your site can be \"the physics department\" or \"the finances office\".\nIt goes on to say:\n\nOn large systems it can be useful to structure /srv by administrative context, such as\n  /srv/physics/www, /srv/compsci/cvs, etc. This setup will differ from host to host. Therefore, no program\n  should rely on a specific subdirectory structure of /srv existing or data necessarily being stored in /srv.\n  However /srv should always exist on FHS compliant systems and should be used as the default location for\n  such data.\n\nYou should therefore further structure your data in directories such as /srv/nfs, /srv/backup and so on.\nI should also mention that few people do this anymore. But there is no good reason why they don't. The standard is by no means out of date.\n/var is traditionally used for things like print-spools and log-files, but it's also used by the Apache web server (on Debian systems anyway - SUSE use /srv); There doesn't seem to be consensus on whether /var is a proper directory for shared data. But if you decide to use it instead, you will have no regrets I'm sure.\nNote also: Karthick's answer is by no means wrong. The FHS says /srv \" should be used as the default location for\nsuch data\", but the standard leaves some room for your own preference, depending on how you interpret the terms.\n\nA: I have seen /export used to serve with nfs, and /mnt used to mount an nfs share locally, in a corporate environment, as suggested in the NFS documentation, a standard that I suspect originally came from Sun OS, later renamed Solaris.\nThe /etc/exports file names the exported volumes and the /exports directory serves them to remote users, who mount them on /mnt. The server host may also mount these same shares on /mnt using the same nfs daemon for the use of any clients or processes running locally on the server, to retain compatibility with any remote hosts and maybe retain the functionality of load leveling, quotas, etc.\nThat is as close to a 'standard' as it gets. Note that /export is not in the FHS therefore /export was added independently, so presumably nobody is happy with /srv. Probably because of potential confusion with 'services' running as daemons rather than 'served' volumes. /export is unambiguously named with little chance of confusion. I never see anything in /srv.\n\nA: *\n\n*Non-user specific data can be stored in /usr/local/var so that it doesn't end up on a newtwork share again.\n\n*Anything not under ../local/.. is allowed to end up on a nfs share,so if you want to download data from a nfs share, and be sure they are stored locally on the machines harddrive.\n\n*Then you should choose a path with .../local/.. in it.... the rest depends on the nature of the data,on the type of it.It could be /local/var or /local/tmp etc.        \n\n\nFile system hierarchy:\n \nAlso have a look at this\n", "Q: Is there one file that all Desktop Managers (GNOME, KDE, XFCE and etc) are required to read/execute when users login?

When I try to watch a video with a high HD Resolution 1280 x 720 H264 in Ubuntu it isn't played smoothly. Stops and glitches occur. I don't think this is a problem with the CPU or graphics card, because under Windows there are no problems like this. Could it be a driver problem? \nUpdate: For me VLC Player works best. No stops and no glitches. Smplayer also looks good but the performance leaks similarly to the standard Ubuntu video player in my case.\n\nA: You can't compare Windows and Linux, because video driver performance and features are different. For instance, if you are using nVidia you need a card that supports vdpau for best performance, which is equivalent to PureVideo in Windows. PureVideo supports many more cards. However, depending on your CPU, you can play HD videos smoothly without vdpau support. So it depends on your video driver, CPU and also player settings.\nIt would help if you could provide more info about your video card and CPU.\nAnyway, try smplayer \nIt's the best player IMO and plays even videos with resolutions higher than 1080p on my Core2 Duo with nVidia 7300 GT (not vdpau).\nMake sure you tweak smplayer. In the Preferences, click the Performance section and select the option Skip only on HD videos in the Loop filter settings. In the General section, click the Video tab and make sure the Output driver is set to xv.\n", "Q: Which DVB-S satellite receivers work with Ubuntu? I would like to connect my satellite dish to my laptop. Can anybody recommend a USB DVB-S receiver that works well with Ubuntu?\n\nA: If found that the following devices are reported as working with VDR. This usually means that they will work with other software as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hauppauge DEC 3000-s\n\n*Hauppauge Nova USB\n\n*Technotrend PC-Line USB\n\n*Kathrein UFP 500 \n\n*Pinnacle PCTV 400e\n\n*Pinnacle PCTV 450e\n\n*Sundtek SkyTV Ultimate DVB-S/S2\n\n\nI don't know, unfortunately, if you can still buy any of them.

What I have done many times and what works quite well is the following scenario:\n1 NIC connected to a bridge and then N VMs connected to the network via that bridge (on Ubuntu 10.4).\nMy newest server now has 2 NICs and I thought I do the same and in addition simply add the second NIC to the same physical LAN and to the bridge (using bridge_ports eth0 eth1); hopefully getting redundancy and higher throughput. This does not seem to work very well. Network traffic is extremely unstable irrespective of network load. Even my ssh session keeps dropping out and reconnecting all the time.\nNow my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should my approach basically work or am I doing something wrong? E.g. fundamentally misunderstanding what bridges can do with 2 NICs?\n\n*I read that there is also NIC bonding that can combine two NICs. Does this have a higher chance of working? And if yes would I then still add a bridge to the bond and the VMs to the bridge?\n\n\nFor reference my /etc/network/interfaces:\n# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system\n# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).\n\n# The loopback network interface   \nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto br0\niface br0 inet dhcp\n      bridge_ports eth0 eth1\n\nNote: This question is the same as this one on server fault. Since it got no answers and I am using Ubuntu I hope to have more luck here.\nThanks,\nCarsten\n\nA: Bridging both physical interfaces caused the problem. If you want to improve speed, you should use bonding. The configuration downside to this is you have to bond at both ends.\nAnother possibility load balancing over these 2 interfaces using ECMP and ip-tables. ip-tables provides connection counters (at least i think they do), so use those to select odd and even connections and send them through one or another connection. Be wary if there is NAT in the middle as that can cause problems with establishing related connections. Also, services with several connections may fail.\nI cannot provide correct syntax on how to do this as I only can do this on some proprietary system.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on Intel Mac I've recently taken up a position in an all Mac workshop - We have Intel based Apple machines.

But, it does much more things than simply getting the color of a pixel on the screen.\nHere's the forum post where I've shared it: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2155281\nThe module has many functions that allow you to e.g. count the amount of pixels that have a specific color in an area of the screen, search for pixel color(s) in area, wait for a pixel or an area of the screen have a specific color, wait for pixel color and run some other function while waiting (e.g. move the cursor for not letting the screen turn off while you are waiting for a specific color).\nBut, as I said, it does a lot more things, like simulating mouse clicks and keyboard, screenshot taking of area of the screen and more.\n\nA: You can use the program grabc. It will turn your mouse pointer in a crosshair and return HTML and RGB values of the selected color.\nsudo apt-get install grabc\n\nDownside: it's not possible to do pixel-exact selections due to the crosshair not being thin enough.\n\nYou can also create a python script, something like:\n#!/usr/bin/python -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\nimport sys\nimport gtk\n\ndef get_pixel_rgb(x, y):\n    pixbuf = gtk.gdk.Pixbuf(gtk.gdk.COLORSPACE_RGB, False, 8, 1, 1)\n    pixbuf.get_from_drawable(gtk.gdk.get_default_root_window(),\n                             gtk.gdk.colormap_get_system(), \n                             x, y, 0, 0, 1, 1)\n    return pixbuf.get_pixels_array()[0][0]\n\nprint get_pixel_rgb(int(sys.argv[1]), int(sys.argv[2]))\n\nmake it executable, and run pixel_rgb=\"$(/path/to/script.py x y)\" in your bash script.

This is what changes there when I run gnome-control-center (the \"Details\" applet in the settings application from the top right menu) and change Default Applications, Web from Google Chrome to Firefox ESR:\n11c11\n< x-scheme-handler/http=google-chrome.desktop\n---\n> x-scheme-handler/http=firefox-esr.desktop`\n\nAs hoped, I could revert that from the command line with:\nperl -i -wpe 's@x-scheme-handler/http(s?)=firefox-esr.desktop@x-scheme-handler/http$1=google-chrome.desktop@' ~/.config/mimeapps.list\n... and put it back with:\nperl -i -wpe 's@x-scheme-handler/http(s?)=google-chrome.desktop@x-scheme-handler/http$1=firefox-esr.desktop@' ~/.config/mimeapps.list\n\nA: For me, sensible-browser seems to just call /usr/bin/gnome-www-browser, which symlinks to /etc/alternatives/gnome-www-browser, which symlinks to the browser.

Hey, everyone, I'm using Macs for years,and since I'm fascinated by the terminal and command line, I try to learn the basic linux stuff, so I don't care about gaming or web browsers,the only thing I want is just a basic, simple, stable, Linux distribution. Should I use ubuntu, or are there any better suggestion for me? Thanks.\nMy old PCs configuration is: \n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Pentium III CPU\n\n*NVidia GeForce mx-440 GPU\n\n*256 megabytes of ram\n\n*a 30 gigabyte hard drive\n\n\nA: Download an Ubuntu ISO file, burn it, boot from CD and test it yourself. You can run Ubuntu without intalling it! It's really simple and there is no risk for you. I think Ubuntu will be the right thing for you. Have fun. :)\n\nA: If you are exclusively interested in the command line, then ubuntu server is worth looking at (particularly given the lower specs of your PC, this will work fine)\nYou will get full compatibility with Ubuntu desktop (and hence support in ubuntu forums will apply to you), but the \"Server\" CD avoids including desktop packages (packages like X, Gnome or KDE) by default, which it seems you are not interested in. Instead it includes server related packages (Apache, DNS, etc). \nThe desktop-centric packages could be added later on an individual or group basis later if you changed your mind.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/server\nhas a FAQ section for further questions.\n\nA: on my parents pc which is a p3 with 1000mhz, geforce 3 and 256mb ram ubuntu runs, but it doesnt work smoothly. everything takes ages and its just very slow. we tried xubuntu but its still not very smooth to use just a little bit better. i havent tried lubuntu yet... so i guess i'd give that a shot if you want to stick to something related to ubuntu.\n\nA: I have tested Ubuntu and installed on several clients with the following specs:\nPC 1\nPentium 2 400Mhz\nMemory 128MB\nHDD 4GB\nPC 2\nPentium 3 550Mhz\nMemory 256MB\nHDD 6GB\nPC3\nPentium 3 866Mhz\nMemory 128MB\nHDD 4GB\nPC4\nPentium 3 1GHZ\nMemory 256MB\nHDD 10GB\nI have to say in this cases and many others i have had Ubuntu perform much better than Windows on the same machine. I guarantee it. Clients have been amazed at the change on their old PC to a new speed and overall performance. This is the case with Ubuntu. Of course xubuntu, lubuntu and low performance desktop distros would be better but for your question am giving you real experience for this type of PCs.\nIn your case:\n* Intel Pentium III CPU\n* NVidia GeForce mx-440 GPU\n* 256 megabytes of ram\n* a 30 gigabyte hard drive\n\nYou have a good CPU to test with. It worked good on the Pentium 3 550Mhz i tried. 256MB memory is enough to work with ubuntu. Trust me with that. Obviously the Nvidia card will help even more. For the hdd space you have plenty for a computer that can play several games, do work, internet and music.\nHope this info helps.\n\nA: I have a very similar, almost identical machine in my mother's home and I use it when I stay there. It has a Celeron 400 CPU and 256 RAM and 32 GB hard disk. I've read that \"The Intel Pentium III Processor had a clock speed range from 450 MHz to 1.4 Ghz\" so under any condition you have a CPU faster than mine.\nIn the past I used Xubuntu on that machine. (Xubuntu is the official ubuntu release with Xfce desktop environment) I believe it can still handle it. (I haven't ever used Lubuntu so I can't comment on that.) The trick is: tandard installation CD of Ubuntu which serves as a live CD may be very slow because it is not installed on the machine and relies on the RAM to run. It doesn't give you an idea on the speed of the installed system. Especially on a machine with that much small RAM. Keep that in mind. You may even prefer to install from an \"alternate CD\"; which is an instalation CD with no live CD feature. (That's for Xubuntu; Debian CDs are not live CDs at all.)\nTwo weeks ago I installed Debian on that machine. (Ubuntu is very closely related with Debian, Ubuntu is a Debian based distribution.) Debian, as default, has much more less services working as default and in my opinion it is superior to Ubuntu for the task to learn GNU/Linux basics on an old machine. \nI installed Debian 5.0.6 \"stable\" release from the iso CDs. (They have 5.0.7 at the moment so prefer that one.) I have no internet connection with that machine. So I created a CD from debian-506-i386-xfce+lxde-CD-1.iso This is the first installation CD of Debian containing Xfce and LXDE environments instead of Debian's default GNOME. The purpose is to be lighter, of course, and is suitable for old old machines.\nAt the beginning of the installation, you are given a choise to install Xfce or LXDE. Later you may install the other one you didn't opt in at the beginning as well. Rhen you'll have 2 desktop environments and choose one of them while logging in. I installed even GNOME desktop to my old machine and now I have 3 choises. (In fact more than 3; there's also a very plain X window system choise as I remember.) To install GNOME as well, you have to have the 1st CD (not the xfce+lxde one) as well.\nBecause I have no Internet connection, I created the first 5 CDs and I'm instaling packages from them. (There are 30+ CDs in total.)\nAs a result: Xfce (both Xubuntu and Debian versions) and LXDE (Debian one) and even GNOME (Debian) works well on the machine. So I see no reason that they won't work for you too.\nAbout the performance: For sure, I installed GNOME just for some testing purposes. Xfce and LXDE are working like a charm on that machine. Starting od the services and applications are a little bit slow but when they start I even don't realize a slowness. That is to mean, machine starts a little bit slow. But when it starts there's no problem. Office package starts a little bit slow but once it starts there's no speed issue when writing... and so on. I have no problem with listening to the music on that system. I even can watch video but video performance is not that good. I don't advice to use [more than 2] relatively heavy programs at the same time.\nFor the command line, there's absoluıtely no problem. That kind of a machine is ideal to learn the basics of GNU/Linux.\nI must admit that I like to work with that machine better than my \"modern\" laptop! I'm sure that your machine will host one of these choises and it will be a lovely GNU/Linux machine. Good luck.\n\nA: I would recommend you to try puppy linux. http://puppylinux.org. It is very small and lightweight.\n\nA: *\n\n*I would recommend you to use Lubuntu. \n\n*It's a faster, more lightweight and energy saving variant of Ubuntu using LXDE- the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment.\n\n*Xubuntu will also be good (Ubuntu + XFCE): http://www.xubuntu.org/\n\n*Crunchbang(Debian,  Ubuntu is also based on Debian, + Openbox) is good and it uses 60MB RAM http://crunchbanglinux.org/\n\n*You can see this thread for more information.\n\n*System requirements for lubuntu can be found here.\n\nA: You can also give Damn Small Linux a try. It's very small (50 MB) and will run fast on your hardware. It's not as comfortable as Ubuntu, but you can also use it to learn some linux basics.\n\nA: If you want to learn just do a Ubuntu Server install and fight with the command line :)\nIf you want a gui then I'd choose DEFINITELY (I have a lot of experience with \"poor hardware\") Linux Mint Fluxbox.\nHave fun :)\n\nA: You can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Xubuntu\n\n*Use Lbuntu\n\n*Use it as a thin client with UbuntuLTSP \n\n*Install Gentoo, and compile everything with processor-specific and optimized flags. Only exagerate with the flags if you don't mind having an unstable system.\n\n", "Q: How to work on *.php pages without LAMP I am learning PHP, which means I'd have to install LAMP on my laptop and I think LAMP would degrade my battery life which is already very low, So is there substitute to the LAMP so that I can see how the PHP pages renders on the browser?\nPlease recommend a software to test the php webpage rendering, Some kind of virtual Web Server or something.\nPS: yes, battery is the main reason I am trying to avoid LAMP, Because each time the system boots LAMP would start and I wont be working on that all the time.\n\nA: LAMPP is just an easy way of running apache with php, mysql and some other stuff. If you were not using LAMPP, you would have to install and configure these (or an alternate webserver) yourself.\nSo in general, no.\nYou don't have to run lampp on system startup. It's as simple as opening a command line and typing sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start to start it, or sudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop to stop it.\nI'm using Gnome Do a lot, and have made some scripts to help me. I have put launchers in my application menu to run these scripts, and can therefore start them from Gnome Do.\nThe script to start lampp and show progress via notify-osd:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport pynotify\nimport os\n\npynotify.init('Lampp loader')\n\nimageURI = 'file:///opt/lampp/xampp.png'\nnotifyString = \"Powering up lampp\\n\"\n\nn = pynotify.Notification(\"lampp\", notifyString, imageURI)\nn.show()\nf = os.popen('gksudo /opt/lampp/lampp start')\ntry:\n    for line in f:\n        notifyString += line\n        n.update(\"lampp\",notifyString)\n        n.show()\nfinally:\n    f.close()\n\nAnd the similar to stop lampp:\n    #!/usr/bin/python\nimport pynotify\nimport os\n\npynotify.init('Lampp loader')\n\nimageURI = 'file:///opt/lampp/xampp.png'\nnotifyString = \"Powering down lampp\\n\"\n\nn = pynotify.Notification(\"lampp\", notifyString, imageURI)\nn.show()\nf = os.popen('gksudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop')\ntry:\n    for line in f:\n        notifyString += line\n        n.update(\"lampp\",notifyString)\n        n.show()\nfinally:\n    f.close()\n\nBoth require python and pynotify (sudo apt-get install python-notify).\nTo create a launcher, simply right click on the Applications menu, select Edit Menus, select a category to the left, and click the New Item button to the right. Put the path to the script in the command field, and make sure the file is executable. \n\nA: Running Apache and PHP will not burden your machine much more than its current state. The other solutions of \"Install XAMPP, etc\" will present the same problem. They're just other \"LAMP\" stacks you can install. I recommend installing lamp-server with tasksel by typing the following in the command line sudo tasksel install lamp-server Once LAMP Server is installed you can disable it from launching on start up:\nsudo update-rc.d apache2 stop\nsudo update-rc.d mysql stop\n\nWhen you need to start either MySQL or Apache you can invoke it from the service command\nsudo service apache2 start\n\nto stop the service\nsudo service apache2 stop\n\nThe advantage of installing lamp-server over other third party stacks, Ubuntu will constantly update and maintain these packages for you. You also are eligible for support here and on other Ubuntu support sites for questions. Most third party stacks need to be supported by their providers, which limits your outlets.\n\nA: In order for PHP to run, you definetely need a web server installed.\nIf apache is not preferred, you could try lighttpd, nginx or abyss.\nThe only part that is really not necessary is MySQL, if you're not interested in having any database backend.\nOn the other hand, you can just install LAMP and make sure that the servers don't start automatically at boot by running:  \nsudo update-rc.d mysql stop\nsudo update-rc.d apache2 stop\n\n\nA: You do need a LAMP server to run PHP code, however, I would recommend you to try XAMPP (a.k.a. LAMPP). \nIt's pretty easy to set up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest version of XAMPP as a .tar.gz archive.\n\n*Extract the archive into the /opt directory:\n$ sudo tar xvfz xampp-linux-<version>.tar.gz -C /opt\n\n*The server is already configured as a development server, so you don't need to do anything else.\n\n\nXAMPP does not start automatically when the system boots, so it shouldn't drain your battery unless you start it manually:\n$ sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start\n\nThen just put your PHP files into the /opt/lampp/htdocs directory, and they should be available at http://localhost/ immediately. When you're done, just stop the server again:\n$ sudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop\n\n", "Q: What is the best way to partition, and what is the best file-system for a new Hard Disk? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat's your recommendation on drive partitioning schemes for a desktop and home server?\nIs Btrfs in Maverick considered stable?\n\nBonus: What is the \"best\" filesystem for \"general\" use?\nBonus 2: If btrfs is supposedly \"better\" than ext3/4, why isn't it the default?\nBonus 3: Will creating a separate boot partition reduce boot time?\nI currently have it set up as:\n\n\n*\n\n*?G Other Stuff\n\n*4G Swap\n\n*10G root ext4\n\n*17G home btrfs\n\n\nA: There is no best way to partition a drive as such. Of course it depends on your set-up. If you have a complicated or odd server system, you may want to spend a lot of time thinking about this. If your current configuration works, leave it be.\n\n\n*\n\n*You will not gain a lot by making an effort. \n\n\nBut this is the important bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*The default, i.e. what the ubuntu installer chooses for you if you select erase entire drive is heavily tested by millions of users. It will work very well.\n\n\nThe default file system in Ubuntu currently is ext4. This is what that partitioning looks like on one of my virtual machines:\nThis works extremely well\n\n\nBonus 2: If btrfs is supposedly \"better\" than ext3/4, why isn't it the default?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*There are things that are better about btrfs compared to ext4, and vice versa. Keep in mind that ext4 is, also, on the bleeding edge of file systems. It's brand new and very advanced. Btrfs is not magical. :-)\n\n*It may very well become the default soon; we'll see. \n\n*Here's the technical bit about btrfs's cool features (this list is copied verbatim from  btrfs):\n\n\n*\n\n*Online volume growth and shrinking\n\n*Online block device addition and removal\n\n*Online defragmentation\n\n*Online balancing (movement of objects between block devices to balance load)\n\n*Transparent compression (currently zlib)\n\n*Subvolumes (separately-mountable filesystem roots)\n\n*Snapshots (writeable, copy-on-write copies of subvolumes)\n\n*File cloning (copy-on-write on individual files, or byte ranges thereof)\n\n*Object-level (RAID1-like) mirroring, (RAID0-like) striping\n\n*Checksums on data and metadata (currently CRC-32C)\n\n*In-place conversion (with rollback) from ext3/4 to Btrfs\n\n*File system seeding (Btrfs on read-only storage used as a copy-on-write backing for a writeable Btrfs)\n\n*User-defined transactions\n\n*Block discard support (reclaims space on some virtualization setups and improves wear leveling on SSDs by notifying the underlying device that storage is no longer in use)\n\n\n(my emphasis)\nIf you care about and use any of the above, btrfs will be a great boon. It's, after the oracle/sun merger, going to be what  ZFS should have always been: Implemented. :)\n\n\nBonus 3: Will creating a separate boot partition reduce boot time?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*No. Boot time is mostly waiting for the magnetic seek-head in the hard drive, you can gain very little indeed by changing any configuration at all. Partitioning the drive differently will do not much good.\n\n*You will possibly hear miracle stories of people decreasing their boot time by putting /boot right at the very beginning of the disk (where the platters are \"smaller\", so to speak). There will be about a 50% decrease in seek times at the very inner part of the disk compared to the very outside. Making an effort to put /boot there is futile. It's will be close to the beginning anyway, no need to bother with that. You should know this though, it makes sense to put the operating system first, and data last.\n", "Q: How to restrict the number of processes a user can start? We tried /etc/security/limits.conf, but that seems to have no effect.\nThe used line for limits.conf looks as follows:\nmyuser hard nproc 6\n\nThat is configuration for a server. I want to limit the processes started. Ulimit limits the processes started from the shell (if I understand that right). But in my case apache starts mapserver-processes, and that number have to be limited.\n\nA: This is not the ideal solution because it can interfere with apache upgrades, but it should work.\nEdit /etc/init.d/apache2, on the top of the script (new line after the #!/bin/sh) add the required ulimit, example:\nulimit -u 1024\n\n", "Q: Create a new SSH user on Ubuntu Server Just created a new virtual Ubuntu server and I'm in the process of hardening it for production use. I currently have a root account. I want to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user (let's call them jim for the rest of this). I want them to have a /home/ directory.\n\n*Give jim SSH access.\n\n*Allow jim to su to root but not perform sudo operations.\n\n*Turn off root SSH access.\n\n*Move SSHd off to a non-standard port to help stop brute-attacks.\n\n\nMy problem lies with the first two items. I've already found useradd but for some reason, I can't log in as a user created with it over SSH. Do I need to beat SSHd to allow this?\n\nA: In my case I had a group which was allowed access and the user was not part of it. This solved it for me.\nUsing the example above with the user jim and assume member of group jim as it's only group (issue groups command while logged in as jim to find groups you are a part of). In my /etc/ssh/sshd_config file I had AllowGroups sshusers entry and thus needed to add jim to the sshusers group. Below is how this would be accomplished:\nusermod -a -G sshusers jim\n\nReplace your group and user as appropriate for your configuration.\n\nA: There will be clues in /var/log/auth.log for why SSH (or PAM) is rejecting the login attempt. Additional clues may be found by using the -v option with the ssh client. Several common situations, some mentioned in the other answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*the user account lacks a password, or is otherwise disabled (see man passwd, try resetting the password or checking the contents of /etc/shadow).\n\n*/etc/ssh/sshd_config is configured to disallow the login (DenyUsers, AllowUsers, PasswordAuthentication, PubkeyAuthentication, UsePAM etc, see man sshd_config).\n\n*the user's shell is not listed in /etc/shells.\n\n*various permission problems on directories or files related to SSH operation: /etc/ssh, /home/jim/.ssh, /home/jim/.ssh/*, etc.\n\n\nI'd also recommend using adduser (instead of useradd) for adding new users; it is a little more friendly about various default account settings.\nAs long as the user is not part of the admin group, they will not be able to sudo to root. For them to use su, you will need to set a root password (passwd root), after which I recommend setting PermitRootLogin=no in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\n\nA: SSH is very picky about the directory and file permissions. Make sure that: \n\n\n*\n\n*The directory /home/username/.ssh has permission \"700\" and is owned by the user (not root!)\n\n*The /home/username/ssh/authorized_keys has permission \"600\" and is owned by the user\n\n\nCopy your public key into the authorized_keys file.\nsudo chown -R username:username /home/username/.ssh\nsudo chmod 0700 /home/username/.ssh\nsudo chmod 0600 /home/username/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nThere is NO need to add the user to /etc/ssh/ssh_config.\n\nA: Edit (as root) /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Append the following to it:\nPort 1234\nPermitRootLogin no\nAllowUsers jim\n\nPort 1234 causes SSH to listen on port 1234. You can use any unused port from 1 to 65535. It's recommended to choose a privileged port (port 1-1024) which can only be used by root. If your SSH daemon stops working for some reason, a rogue application can't intercept the connection.\nPermitRootLogin disallows direct root login.\nAllowUsers jim allows user jim to login through SSH. If you do not have to login from everywhere, you can make this more secure by restricting jim to an IP address (replace 1.2.3.4 with your actual IP address):\nAllowUsers jim@1.2.3.4\n\nChanges to the configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config are not immediately applied, to reload the configuration, run:\nsudo service ssh reload\n\n\nA: I could be wrong but I always have to install the server daemon before I can connect (At least on desktop)\nssh is installed by default but that is just the client\nthis command installs the server\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\nYou can change the port and stop root login by editing \n/etc/ssh/sshd_config\nThis requires you to restart the service though.\nsudo service ssh restart\n\nA: Jim will not have SSH access until you have set a password. As root execute:\ngrep -i \"jim\" /etc/shadow | awk -F':' '{ print $2 }'\n\nIf this command returns a \"!\" character then login is disabled for this account. Executing passwd jim as root will prompt you for a new and confirmed password string after which the grep command above should return a hashed string representing the password for jim.\nAlso be sure to verify that jim has a login shell, set by default, and a home directory that exists.\nPlease note lekensteyn's post for information on modifying SSH server settings.\n\nA: There might be some instances that the PasswordAuthentication is disabled by default.\nKindly check /etc/ssh/sshd_config and ensure that the PasswordAuthentication attribute is set to yes.\n\nA: @Lekensteyn I'm unable to leave a comment to the question answer because I don't have the reputation - but I tried appending\nAllowUsers existingUser,newUser\n\nto my /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and now I can no longer ssh with both my existingUser or the newUser.\n\nA: Simple note:\nThe public key should be written inside this file:\n/home/newUsername/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n", "Q: How do I export all the Python docs of a package and get it into Devhelp?

You may also edit the title, subject, author and keywords of a PDF document using PDF Mod.\nsudo apt-get install pdfmod\n\n \nNote: this application may require quite a few dependencies related to mono.\n\nA: You can use master PDF editor Master PDF Editor is a good application for this task.\n\nA: Option 1:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use calibre  to convert the pdf file to rtf.\n\n*Open the rtf file in OpenOffice.\n\n*Make changes and then create a pdf out of it. \n\n\nOption 2: \n\n\n*\n\n*PDF Studio is a complete PDF editor.But you have to pay for the developers as it is a commercial software.\n\n\nOption 3: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use scribus  it might be useful for complex visual edits.\n\n\nOption 4:\n\n\n*\n\n*xournal\n\nA: you can do this withPDFzorro - PDF Editor:\nhttp://PDFzorro.com\nhere you can edit pdf files online, addcomments and text, draw retangles and lines etc..\ndelete, add, rotate, sort pages, merge etc..\nThere also exista Android-App for smartphones and a Google Chrome-Webstore-App for GoogleDrive\n\nA: For PDF editing I have used a PDF Annotator flpsed \n. You are able to save edited files in postscript format or in PDF.\n\nA: Even Xournal (available in the Software center) is not bad at all, provides an entire suite of pdf editing (highlight, notes, add text...) with the free option of pdf export! Works really fine!\n\nA: I try almost all methods above, and finally find a best method: wine Foxit Reader.\nIn linux, we need pdf software like adobe acrobat pro under windows. \n'wine Foxit Reader' is very light and powerful.\nI am now using wine Foxit Reader 2.3 in ubuntu 12.04 x86_64.\n\nA: I frequently use Inkscape, GIMP eg. to fill in forms. (With such utilities like Imagemagic's convert, and pdftk [because they support just a single page only, you may join pages later].)\nAlso they wrote, that PDF Import extension feature to LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org may do what you want.\n\nA: You can use pdfshuffler to delete pages and rearrange the pages if necessary.\nIt is available in software center. To install pdfshuffler, you can do\n  sudo apt-get install pdfshuffler\n\n\nDescription:  \n\nPDF-Shuffler is a small application which allows one to merge or split\n  pdf documents and rotate, crop and rearrange their pages using an\n  interactive and intuitive graphical interface.\n\n\nA: The other way would be to use Libreoffice it has a Free PDF Import mod extension \n\nA: Cropping, specifically, can easily be done with BRISS, a cross-platform PDF editor.\n\nA: mendeley is good at making notes and manage pdfs, but it is more like a reference manager\n\nA: Make sure to try PDF Buddy, the online PDF editor- it makes editing and signing PDFs a snap.\n(Disclosure: I'm a co-founder) \n\nA: Personally, I tried PDF Studio and I must admit it looks original Acrobat on its features (the gui, however, is not fantastic).\nThe only flaw is that it is not free, but I did not regret what I spent (much less than it costs Acrobat, however). Tested on Mint and Ubuntu and it works great! If you want to be picky, the tool \"Text\" is limited and the interface is less rational than Acrobat's, but all in all, I would say that it is a great substitute.\nOne last tip: if you do not hurry, version 9 should be out in March, with many other new interesting features. The most important for me is to allow OCR for pages that already have some text content included.\n", "Q: Problem with Folders in Ubuntu One i'm new at Ubuntu One.\nI've just uploaded a file and I want to get it into a folder.

In the various download repositories, there are 10.04.1 ISO images of Ubuntu desktop, alternate and server editions, but I can only find the original ubuntu-10.04-netbook-i386.iso, not an updated ubuntu-10.04.1-netbook-i386.iso. Is the latter ISO available somewhere? If no, why doesn't the Ubuntu maintainers create one for this version.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no netbook iso for 10.04.1. For some reason, unlike the desktop and server editions, Ubuntu Netbook 10.04 is not considered a Long Term Support (LTS) release. Though, all hope is not lost. If you install from the original ubuntu-10.04-netbook-i386.iso and apply all the updates, you will effectively have Ubuntu Netbook 10.04.1. If you look at 10.04.1's changelog, it includes many netbook fixes even though it is not a LTS.\n\nA: I found a mirror that has a copy of it here:\nhttp://kambing.ui.ac.id/iso/ubuntu/releases/lucid/\n\nA: http://www.ubuntu.com/netbook/get-ubuntu/download\nMy guess would be there is no 10.04.1 since an upgrade from CD or via Internet is available for the 10.10\n\nA: Ubuntu Netbook 10.04 is not an LTS version (LTS is only \"classic\" Ubuntu and Ubuntu server) -- so there are no maintaince updates (10.04.x) for netbook version.\n(The same as with Kubuntu 8.04.)\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS\n\nA: The official site will give you the newest, 10.10, or you can go here for 10.04.1 - http://releases.ubuntu.com/lucid/\n", "Q: Using a bittorrent client slows down internet connection I have a problem while using transmission. I don't know where it comes from because it doesn't occur every time.\nSometime while downloading a torrent, I cannot browse on the internet with a browser. Or if I can it is extremly slow.\nI opened the correct port on my router. I limited the upload download to a reasonable amount (50/5, my upload is very bad). I don't not allow transmission to use PnP and NAT-PMP. And this doen't seem to be related to the download speed of a particular torrent: before limiting download I could download at 800ko/s and have no problem and sometime the problems occurs with download at 3ko/s.\nIs anyone else having this problem?\nI really don't understand, isn't opening the correct port and disabling plug n play suppose to make transmission not interfere with http?\n\nA: Set your upload to 50% of your max upload bandwidth.  You can have the download unlimited or limited. I set my download to 90% of max.\nI have found with bandwidth saturating programs (Torrents), if the upload gets to > 75% of your max outbound limit, it severely hobbles all the data transfers on the system (Browsing).  TCP/IP is a two way street, the packet replies have to get back to the sender before they can send another packet.\n\nA: Limit the number of connections\nBitTorrent is a protocol using a lot of simultaneous connections. While they may not consume a lot of bandwidth, they do consume a lot of administration work on the IPv4 routers and hosts to keep track of all the connection states.\nRegular simple routers in a box you can buy for $40 aren't usually capable of maintaining more than 1000 connections before they go flat into the ground. This is because these devices have a very limited amount of memory to work with.\nOn the hosts a large number of connections may cause trouble because of security limits for a certain amount of connections per user and per process. These are usually viewed and altered using ulimit, but you should never run into it with the system defaults in Ubuntu with regular usage of your PC. However, BitTorrent can use a lot and may hit the limit on your PC.\nSee this answer on how to limit the number of connections per item and how to set a global limit in Transmission.\n\nA: I didn't think of this myself, but it made a lot of sense once somebody pointed it out to me on here http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/36641-42-slow-internet-torrent-client\nPut a limit on your uploads, most modems these days can take a thrashing, so download speeds are not usually your concern, put a limit on your upload speeds, your computer needs to be able to communicate with other servers on the internet, if your upload bandwidth is being used up completely then your computer will simply appear to be just silent\n\nA: The problem, in your case, is probably not the data rate but the number of connections. Many internet gateways can't handle many connections at the same time.\nYou can Limit your maximum amount of simultaneous connections in the Transmission preferences like so:\n\nTry to keep these values very low at first. 5/10 is a good starting point. And increase them slowly as you find it working.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: Especially new torrents can show this behaviour. If you wait until there are enough seeders for a torrent, it'll be slowing down your browsing much less.\n\n*Note also: You shouldn't have to limit bandwidth. This is handled by the TCP/IP stack, no problem, in most cases. It tries to schedule packet delivery fairly.\n", "Q: How can I add specific folders to Places in mintMenu?

So you should change .py scripts.\nIt is very easy to change/add items in case of Mint 10.\nRight click on Menu button, then select 'Preferences', then select tab 'Places'. From there you will be able to add/remove/change elements of MintMenu Places. \nBest wishes,\nVincenzo\n\nA: Another way to do this is by editing the ~/.gtk-bookmarks file. It is a newline separated list of entries found in the bookmarks folder, where each entry follows the format shown below:\n\n[URI] [entry-name]\n\nIt is extremely flexible in that it can handle pretty much any protocol that your system recognizes, including sftp://, smb://, http://, etc.\n", "Q: Is there a PPA with the latest version of LibreOffice? There was recently another release of LibreOffice, but it is  a pain to have to manually go to their website and download the packages every time there is a new release. Is there a PPA that always has the latest version of LibreOffice?\n\nA: The main LibreOffice PPA is for \"test builds and backports\", including \"alpha and beta releases!\".\nUPDATE As of 2016-07, I see it's \"LibreOffice fresh\", the latest release of the newest series (but no alpha/beta releases, which are now in separate PPA).\nIf you want less-bleeding edge, it includes links to per-version stable PPAs, e.g. https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/libreoffice-4-1 for LibreOffice 4.1.\n\nA: There is an official LibreOffice PPA here. \nYou need to add ppa:libreoffice/ppa in your software sources to add it to the software center, just follow the instructions for the GUI way.\nMore information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the ppa of LibreOffice to be considered safe for the system?\nTo add ppa and upgrade libre office using command line:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa\nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get upgrade  \n\n\nA: If you wish to use a Pre-Release (Alpha, Beta or Pre-Release version) you can use the following PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-prereleases\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThis will give you the latest Pre-Release version available. It works perfectly with LibreOffice 4.2.x (At this moment). If you get any problems related to broken packages or the likes you can force the upgrade procedure which fixes any related problems with the already installed packages. In the case however I would recommend using aptitude instead of apt-get (For a better dependency resolver) like this:\nsudo aptitude full-upgrade\n\nOf course this is only in the worst case scenario but always remember to read the recommendations of aptitude before proceeding which mentions which packages will be removed, upgraded and installed. \n\nA: UPDATE 2\nAs of July 25th 2013, the following PPA offers the Release version of LibreOffice:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa\nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get upgrade  \n\nThat will leave you with LibreOffice 4.1.\n\nUPDATE 1\nA PPA is now available for 4.1.0.

How can I change its user ID from the default of 1000?\nIf there are additional steps that would be required in order to avoid breaking the login process on a typical desktop installation, those should be included as part of the answer.\n\nA: You can change it in /etc/passwd, /etc/group and /etc/shadow or you use one of the preferred possibilties above. But - most important - you have to change the ownership of all files belonging to the user.\nFor instance, if the old user id is 1000 and the new one is 5000:\nfind / -uid 1000 -exec chown -h 5000 {} +\n\nAnd the same for the group id (if you change it as well).\nfind / -gid 1000 -exec chgrp -h 5000 {} +\n\n\nA: The problem is that, like you mentioned, you cannot change your user's UID when it is logged in a session. You have to use another user account to proceed.\nBut you don't have to create a new user account, promote it to admin, log out, log in to the new admin account, change your primary account's UID, log out, log in to your primary account then delete the new admin user just change your UID. ;)\nYou can boot into recovery mode (it's an option that appears when you start up your computer, or hold shift right after the BIOS messages complete; Use ESC on Dell machines running OEM-Ubuntu). This will log you in a root session. Being logged in root and not your usual user account, you will be able to modify your UID.\nBecause the recovery mode only works in  command line interface, once logged into a root session, you will have to: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use BubbaJ's instructions to remount the root file system in read-write mode: mount -o remount,rw /.  \n\n*Use Luis Alvarado's command: usermod -u NEW_UID your_username. \n\n*Follow ddeimeke's instructions to update file permissions. \n\n*Then, reboot your computer (reboot), so you can boot in normal mode.\n\n\nA: Complete solution based on @AlexandreP. and @ddeimeke + official documentation. No reboot necessary.\nThe Debian/Ubuntu policy is that if there is a user jim with user ID 1001, there is also a group jim with group ID 1001. This solution also updates those group IDs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable the root account:\nsudo passwd root\n\n\n*If the user is logged in, then log out (also on virtual terminals)\n\n*Go to VT1: Ctrl-Alt-F1\n\n*Log in as root and run this with the user name and old/new UID supplied:\n# put the information we need in variables\nusername=...\nold_uid=`id -u $username`  # looks up current (old) uid\nnew_uid=...\n\n# update the user ID and group ID for $username\nusermod -u $new_uid $username\ngroupmod -g $new_uid $username\n\n# update the file ownerships\n# NB: you cannot combine the next two chowns, or files where \n# only the uid xor the gid matches won't be updated  \nchown -Rhc --from=$old_uid $new_uid /    # change the user IDs\nchown -Rhc --from=:$old_uid :$new_uid /  # change the group IDs\n\n\n*Log out\n\n*Log in as $username\n\n*Disable the root account:\nsudo passwd -dl root\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Goto System>>Administration>>Users and Groups\n \n\n\n*\n\n*Click Advanced Settings and goto Advanced Tab there in the bottom you will see your user id.            \n\n*Change it and click ok.\n\n\nA: If you go to console and type: usermod --help you will get one of the parameters saying:\n-u, --uid UID      new UID for the user account\nso if you want to change the UID for user cyrex then do:\nusermod -u 1000 cyrex\nthat would change the uid for cyrex from whatever value it had before to 1000\nIf you want to do it visually then do this:\nGo to\n\nSYSTEM --> ADMINISTRATION --> USERS\n  AND GROUPS\n\nSelect yourself from the list and click on ADVANCED SETTINGS\nUID is at the end of that window.\n\nA: This is summed up, what at least since Ubuntu 20.04 is needed (for keeping to be able using Automounting, the change in Extended ACL permissions is needed):\nI wanted to change a user id and group id for example from default (uid=) 1000 (and gid=1000) to (uid=) 5000 (and gid=5000), so access to mobile drives formatted with ext4 or similar capable systems with uid & gid) are no problem, if the files and archives have the same user id or group id 5000, no matter if another computer or operating system writes data to this (this enables sharing files easily between computers if all the own users have the same uid and gid).\nFirst I created an additional user, logged as new user, changed in terminal with sudo su - to the root and then I used the commands\nfind / -uid 1000 -exec chown -h 5000 {} +\n\nfor changing user id\nand\nfind / -gid 1000 -exec chgrp -h 5000 {} +\n\nfor changing group ID.\n(Take care: This changes the rights on all mounted devices. If not wanted, unmount all not desired or narrow the commands in the part find / to find /home/<user> or else.)\nIn Fedora this worked but not in Ubuntu totally. For example Automounting did not work. Then I read one has to fix also the extended ACL permissions, otherwise things like Automounting breaks (perhaps problem because of ACL permissions do not appear if no user had this UID & GID already but in my case this was the problem). The change of the Extended ACL permissions seems to be required since Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10.\nThese are the commands which gave the possibility of Automounting back again:\nsudo setfacl -m \"u:<NEWUID>:r-x\" /media/<USERNAME>\n\n, which sets UID permissions to the own folder in 'media' and\nsudo setfacl -x \"u:<OLDUID>\" /media/<USERNAME>\n\n, which deletes permissions to the own user folder for the old UID (yes, this command is not needed for getting Automounting work again, but it ensures another user with the old UID has not access to the media, too).\nBTW: A user says, usermod already changes all permissions in home folder since Ubuntu 18.04, but for Automounting at least until Ubuntu 20.04.4 this seems not to be enough yet.\nsource of information from where I got it and practically tested it since about a month:\nAnswers contain all I explain but a bit chaotically and only one advices to fix the Extended ACL permissions for keeping to be able of Automounting.\nPS: If someone asks why I did not post this as a question with the solution, the I have to say, I do not have enough \"karma\" in this sites for doing this. So please vote this answer up.\n\nA: With KDE:\nIn the Change Advanced User Settings Menu:\nChanging from another user does not work for 1000 which is the default user.\nyou have to do that manually - my experience\n\nA: First you need to login as root, at least for a while, so let us make this possible:\nsudo passwd root\n\nReboot, ctrl + alt + f1 to switch to the console, login as root, do the following (ownership in home dir will be taken care of automatically):\ngroupmod --gid NEWGID username\nusermod  --uid NEWUID username \n\nFor your files in places other than your home dir, to this:\nsudo chown -R username:username /path/to/files\n\nDelete and lock the passwd of root, if you want. (I tend to keep it):\npasswd -dl root\n\n\nA: I followed ddeimeke's instructions with the following changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I did not logout and instead did sudo su\n\n*I did not touch /etc/shadow\nI have seen it mentioned in the other answers that you should either boot to recovery or login as root. Mine was a fresh Ubuntu 14 install so I was willing to test whether it would work without logging in as root.

It also may clarify why your machine is trying to re-mount /dev/sdb1 when you click on your phone.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: \nError mounting: mount exited with exit code 1: helper failed with:\n  mount: according to mtab, /dev/sdb1 is already mounted on /\n  mount failed\n\nDisk Utility reported error in Ubuntu 10.10 while mounting one of the drives\nREASON\nYour FSTAB file is incorrectly configured.\nYour /etc/mtab and /etc/fstab files must be showing difference in mounted volumes entries. which is confusing for the \"Disk Utility\" to figure out on its own.\nExample\nIn my case reinstalling Ubuntu 10.10 with auto partition option created the problem, leaving my Data Drive(IDE HDD) /dev/sda unreadable.\nUbuntu was installed at /dev/sdb (SATA HDD) but reported as /dev/sda in FSTAB, and I was unable to mount my 2nd HDD(Data Drive)\n/etc/mtab contains the next line:\n/dev/sdb1 / ext4 rw,errors=remount-ro,commit=0 0 0\n\nWhereas '/etc/fstab' shows:\n/dev/sda1 / ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n\nSolution\nYou can change it manually, by changing your / partition entry to it's actual device name.\nFind your / partition's actual device (eg. in my case /dev/sdb1)\n\n\n*\n\n*Press ALT + F2 and run gksudo gedit.\n\n*Open up /etc/fstab \n\n*Change your root partition to the device listed in \"Disk Utility\".\n\n*Restart your computer, and enjoy\n\n\nIn my case I changed the next line from /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sda1 / ext4    errors=remount-ro 0 1\n\nto\n/dev/sdb1 / ext4    errors=remount-ro 0 1\n\nRead about 'MTAB' & 'FSTAB' in wikipedia for more clarity...\nQuite nicely explained there...Thanks Ton 2 all you guys @ Wikipedia.\n", "Q: What exactly does Ubuntu share with other Debian based distributions? What exactly does Ubuntu share with other Debian based distributions? What do all Debian based distributions share in common that other distributions don't?\n\nA: All Debian-based distributions share the Debian package archive either directly or (in the case of Ubuntu) by making their own rebuilds of it. Thanks to this a Debian-based distribution instantly has effectively every piece of software you'll ever need available in a package. We also get the upgrades and bug fixes for these packages made by the 1000 or so Debian Developers.\nWe also all share the dpkg and apt package management tools. Dpkg provides the most reliable package install/uninstall/upgrade as it is transactional. If a package has an issue installing the install is rolled back completely, you don't get something half-installed. Apt provides powerful dependency resolution and allows us to provide three levels of dependencies to ensure users get the best experience from the package but are still able to make some customizations to the packages installed by choosing to install or not a packages Recommends and Suggests lists.\nOnce you get below the general look and feel differences you may notice some of the best aspects of Ubuntu are actually from Debian. This is by design, we are deliberately trying to take those advantages and build on them. All other Debian-based distributions will have those same advantages.\n", "Q: How to profile GNOME desktop start?

What's the reason why we cannot download Ubuntu+1 Alpha 1 once Ubuntu+1 Alpha 2 has been released?\nIt would be helpful to roughly find out when regressions started to show up (sometimes it's not as easy as simply downgrading one package).\n\nA: CD images take up a lot of space. Consider all of the combinations of architectures and flavours that one might wish to download. I imagine that the potential use case for this (consider that this method of regression testing would only work for packages on the CD, which are likely to have lots of developer attention anyway) is sufficiently small that it is not deemed to be a worthwhile tradeoff.\n", "Q: Can't print, CUPS package corrupted and hangs on re-install When I upgraded to Ubuntu 10.4 (Maverick), the upgrade process got stuck on the post-installation of the CUPS package.  I had to kill processes and run several forced updates before I could finally get regular updated.  Ever since I can't print - The printed file gets messed up and crashes the printer.  I also can't re-install CUPS, as each time the installation hangs and I have to kill it before it completes.\nI tried to find a workaround for this problem, but in vain.  Does anyone know how to bypass this?  Or at least why can the post-installation hang, and how to re-install a problematic package?\nSome system specs and other hints: Dell D630 laptop running Ubuntu 10.4, Gnome desktop, standard LAN network, printing to an LPD server.  Everything worked fine on 9.10.  Also, the printed files themselves are not corrupted.  The problem does not seem to be Evince-specific, but common to all printouts.\n\nA: I had a problem like this with a headless box that had once been a print server and only listened for TCP (vice Unix socket) connections. \nThe 10.10 init script for CUPS waits for the Unix socket to appear, and if your cups.conf doesn't specify one, you get the kind of hangs that you are describing.\nVerify that cups.conf has a line like\nListen /var/run/cups/cups.sock\nbecause /etc/init/cups.conf contains the (dumb IMHO) line:\n# wait until daemon is ready\n     while [ ! -e /var/run/cups/cups.sock ]; do sleep\n 0.5; done\n\n\nA: The post-install script is /var/lib/dpkg/info/cups.postinst.

For some reason when I try to upload photos to facebook from the website, it tells me I need to upgrade my flash player:\n\nI definitely have flash installed, as can be seen in the picture, and working fine in youtube etc. \n\nMy question is two-fold:\n1) Does anyone know if this a problem with the version of flash I'm running, Ubuntu, or facebook itself? I get the same problem in Chrome and Firefox, so I know it's not the browser.\n2) Is there a workaround or fix for this? As far as I can tell I'm running the very latest flash (on 64-bit Ubuntu 10.10) - but maybe that's the problem?\nNote: Before everyone starts jumping up and down about using Shotwell or Digikam or some such to upload photos to facebook, I know about these (and do use Shotwell at times). Unfortunately Shotwell only lets you upload to a Profile, but doesn't (as far as I can tell) let you upload to a facebook Page of which I am an administrator, so I am forced do it through the website. Using the simple uploader as seen in the first picture is horribly slow and tedious, and often times out while uploading.\nOf course if anyone knows of any alternate ways to upload to facebook pages I'd love to hear 'em!\n\nA: You're using the 64bit beta, and it looks like Facebook's version check code isn't accepting it. I get the same message in Facebook with that version of Flash on Firefox and Chrome. I don't think there's anything you can do but go back to the release version. Unless there's a Firefox extension that fakes plugin versions?\nFor what it's worth it's easier to disable different versions of a plugin on the fly in Chrome/ium on its about:plugins page.\n\nA: You have a very new version of Flash. I thought I was using the latest version (10.2.161.23) and you're a whole minor version ahead... Which is odd.\nYou can see from the Adobe page that they think the latest version is 10.1.\nI remember when I first started using Flash Player betas that some sites didn't recognise it as a new version (and thought I was out of date).

For example WOW,1024x768\n\" \" - After the variables for /desktop the stuff inside the double quotes is the executable. You do not need to have it inside quotes but just in case you have spaces you will need them.\n-opengl -console - This are only parameters that WOW uses. You can put the parameters for a game after all has been typed as you can see in the above example for wow.\nThis took me almost a whole year to find and use since sometimes users wanted 2 or 3 opened programs at the same time. And since i teach free software i had to really dig into this.\nAfter doing the above you can just create a LAUNCHER in the desktop pointing at the executable with the wine explorer /desktop line.\nOther tips and tricks are:\nUsing Regedit\nJust type regedit in the terminal.

In the screenshot, note how the levels are moving in the \"mixer\" window but no signal in the levels in the upper-right side of the screen, not sure what it means.\nAny idea?\n\n\nA: Firstly, you should configure JACK with qjackctl (which you seem to have installed)\nYou should uncheck \"Realtime\" as you probably don't have a realtime-enabled kernel.\nYou should also raise the \"Frames/Period\" as you're having some buffer overflows, as they're called. The red text in the status box is telling you that.\nGetting sound to work might take some tinkering on your part. If you install a neat little program called patchage (using apt-get or Software Center)\n then you can see a visual representation of your audio system with JACK. If this DJPlay program is truly JACK-enabled it should be very easy to connect and disconnect audio pipelines with Patchage.\nJACK is a very advanced piece of software but unfortunately integrates poorly with the default environment. It takes getting used to.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and just now solved it. The solution isn't optimal and I will look for a cleaner one, but this may help you anyway. (I'm running Debian/Gnome, so if you're on Debian or Ubuntu I suspect this procedure will work - on other distros there may be some differences).\nFirst, start JACK control BEFORE you start DJPlay. Wait for it to display 'Started' in the display window. (If it doesn't get this far, then you probably have a problem with JACK). After it has started, then start DJPlay. Then, go back to the JACK control and click on 'Connect'. On the 'Audio' tab you should see 'DJPlay' in the 'Readable Clients' list, and both 'DJPlay' and 'system' in the 'Writable Clients' list. Expand 'DJPlay' in the left list, and 'system' in the right list. In the left list, click on 'player_1_left', then in the right list click on an item - on my system they show up as 'playback_1', 'playback_2', etc.. Then click on the 'Connect' button. A line should appear between left and right lists. Repeating the process, connect 'player_2_left' to 'playback_1', then connect 'player_1_right' to 'playback_2', then 'player_2_right' to 'playback_2'. This should connect the left and right outputs of both DJPlay decks to the left and right inputs of your computer sound system. If you play something in DJPlay, you should now hear it.\nThere has to be a better, more automated way to do this; if I find it I'll try to post directions.\nI don't have a real-time kernel so I can't use the real-time option. I hear some squeaks that indicate the sound processing isn't quite keeping up with its task, so I'm going to need a dedicated computer with an RT kernel to get this working properly. But before I set that up, I'm going to play a bit to see if DJPlay is worth the effort. Good luck getting your setup running!\n", "Q: Packaging a Java web application: Reuse tomcat6 or separate process? I would like to package my java web application http://kunagi.org/ for Ubuntu (and Debian).\nShould the package create a user kunagi, provide an init script and configuration files for the existing tomcat6, so that my application runs in a separate jvm instance with its own privileges? Or should the package just drop the web application into /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/, so that it runs with the tomcat process and privileges?\n\nA: That should be the choice of the sysadmin. Just package the app in order to just run out-of-the box. If the sysadmin wants increased security that is his work :)\n\nA: Rather than modify an existing tomcat/webapp installation, you could provide (1) stand-alone package that runs with an embedded web server, and (2) provide a simple \".war\" file that people can download and install into their own tomcat (or jetty or glassfish or...) server.  (If you have a versino that's a stand-alone server, then it's trivial to also provide the war as a separate download.)\nAs for upgrades, the stand-alone version can upgrade with your package manager (apt,rpm,yum,etc); but, if people install the war into tomcat, it would be up to the person who installed it to upgrade it manually, or you can provide a updater inside the web application.   For a really nice example of this, see jenkins (formerly hudson).  Sonatype/nexus also has separate installation options.\nThe general guidance to give to end-users is: for the quick & easy personal PC installation, go with the stand-alone version. For a mature data center and long-term ease of management, go with the \".war\" in an existing app server.\nThe problem with a package manager modifying an existing tomcat installation is that there may be ump-teen webapps inside that tomcat, and usually there's a unexpectedly tight dependency between a version of tomcat & the versions of the webapps. It's best to upgrade tomcat first, test to see if all the webapps still work, then upgrade the webapps one by one. (Or, perhaps I'm just being paranoid, since that's the only method that has worked for me, historically.)\n", "Q: Cannot append to mbox file error while fetching mail in Evolution Whenever I try to download mail using POP3 in Evolution I get the following message\n\nError while Fetching Mail.\nCannot append message to mbox file:\n  /home/roland/.evolution/mail/local/Inbox:\n  File too large\n\nIf anyone could give me an idea of how to fix this I would be greatful\n\nA: If you are using lucid(10.04) you can use this ppa https://launchpad.net/~jacob/+archive/evo230 to fix this error. \nSome  workarounds are also available to solve this error( eg: archivemail). There is bug report on launchpad regarding this. Just go through it:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/evolution/+bug/197290\n\nA: Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your mail site (google, hotmail, yahoo, etc..) and do a clean up of all the old files. Basically just to make sure you have only the most up to date ones. This should help evolution when fetching the files.\n\n*Clean the INBOX in evolution just to make sure.\n\n*Clean the TRASH in both, evolution and your mail webpage.\n\n*Try to use evolution and see what happens.\nNOTE: Try to use thunderbird just for testing and comparing.\n\nA: Ahhh. The problem is that, even though the Inbox is empty, IF the Trash folder is full, Evolution cannot append to the mbox file.  Empty (Expunge) the Trash folder, and it starts working.\n\nA: I found that worked for a while, however eventually the error comes back and does't go even if you do all of the above.  \nIn that instance what I did was rename the Inbox (mailbox file) contained in mail/local to Inbox_old then started evolution and downloaded the new mail.   So now, it wouldn't allow me to access the old Inbox mail obviously.  So, in order to access the old Inbox mail, I created another folder in Evolution, but not under Inbox - at the same level.  \nThen I renamed the 'old' file that had been created in mail/local and copied the Inbox_old to 'old' and restarted Evolution.  It complains a bit on the initial access of the 'old' folder, but then it starts rebuilding and sorts everything out.  \nI now have a new Inbox and all my old inbox files full accessible via the new folder 'old' from within Evolution.\n", "Q: Packaging a Java web application: .war or symlinks to dependencies? I would like to package my java web application http://kunagi.org/ for Ubuntu (and Debian).\nShould the package install a .war file which contains all the required dependencies (.jar files)? Or should the package install the unpacked web application without .jar files and place symlinks into the WEB-INF/libs/ directory?\n\nA: Traditionally there has been some friction between upstream and distribution level concerns with java packaging. Bundling dependencies has been one of the major points of contention. The security team particularly sees this as an unnecessary maintenance burden. Packages bundling libraries will likely be rejected from Debian. \nJava webapp packaging policy in Debian is still evolving. There is currently a Debian Enhancement Proposal (DEP) under discussion around this issue. It aims to\n\npropose a file layout, set of\n  conventions and best practices, and a \n  supporting script interface for\n  packaging Java web applications \n  (servlets) and deploying them in\n  containers.\n\nThis discussion is taking place on the debian-java mailing list. It's also probably the best place for you to ask further questions about Java packaging.

Honestly I tampered with plug-in settings in Firefox that this happened. But right now I can't do anything to overwrite the setting...\nMy question is how I can remove Firefox in a way to remove any previous traces and re-install a new version like for the first time?\n\nA: First of all, remove Firefox and all of its configuration files by typing in:\nsudo apt-get purge firefox\n\nAlso, make sure that the ~/.mozilla directory (which contains Firefox' configuration files) is deleted:\nrm -rf ~/.mozilla\n\nIt might even not be necessary to reinstall Firefox, just remove the ~/.mozilla directory (step two) and restart Firefox, and it should be just as if you just installed it.\n\nA: All the answers given so far are way too drastic.  You don't need to apt-get purge firefox or rm -rf ~/.mozilla to get what you want.\nHere's the thing.  Firefox doesn't store any user data in itself.  What it does instead is create what's known as a \"user profile\" -- a directory in your home directory -- and store all your data in there. And by data I mean everything -- add-ons, themes, browsing history, stored passwords, and on and on. (The actual location of your profiles in the filesystem varies by OS; on Ubuntu and other Linuxes, it's generally in .mozilla/firefox in your home directory.) Data in the user profile is completely separate from the Firefox application itself, so removing Firefox via apt-get or the like won't delete the profile data; when you reinstall Firefox later, it'll just look up your profile and reload it all, which can be frustrating if you don't realize what's going on.\nWhen you first use Firefox, it silently creates a default profile for you, and uses that profile from that day onward.  But you don't have to use that profile.  Firefox supports multiple profiles, and you can switch back and forth between them at will.  This means that to get Firefox back to the way it was the day you first installed it, you don't have to touch the Firefox binaries at all -- all you have to do is create a new, empty profile, and use it instead of your old, cluttered one. Restart Firefox and it'll be like you never ran it before.\nHere's how to create a new FF profile in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close all running Firefox windows\n\n*Open a console window (profile management is only accessible via the command line)\n\n*Run the following command at the prompt: firefox -ProfileManager\n\n*This will launch the Firefox Profile Manager -- a dialog box that looks like this:\n\n\n\nYours will probably only have one profile listed -- that's your current, default profile, with all your add-ons and other stuff.  It'll have a name that starts with a string of random characters; that's because FF had to come up with a name for it when it automatically created the profile, so it just used a random string.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the \"Create Profile\" button.  This will launch a wizard walking you through defining a new, empty profile.  When that process is complete you'll be returned to the Profile Manager dialog box, now with two profiles listed, your old one and your new one.\n\n*Select your newly created profile.\n\n*Optional: if you want Firefox to use your new, empty profile from now on by default, check the \"Don't ask at startup\" box.  If you'd prefer FF to prompt you for which profile you want to use each time you run it, leave that box unchecked.\n\n*Click \"Start Firefox\".\n\n\nNow Firefox will restart, completely fresh and new as the first day you downloaded it.  Problem solved. And if you ever need to retrieve something from your old profile, like your old bookmarks, say, all your old data is archived in your old profile, so you can safely retrieve it later.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Ubuntu Software Application\n\n\n*Go to Installed\n\n*Search for Firefox\n\n*Click on Remove.\n\n\nA: Run type firefox.

The only problem is that I do not know how to connect it to a wireless network, and I cannot use a network cable to connect it to my router.\nWhen trying to list the network cards, only the loopback interface showed up:\n$ ifconfig\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback\n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric 1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0\n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\nwhich was unexpected, as both my Ethernet network interface (eth0) and wireless network interface (wlan0) showed up when doing the same in a fresh installation of Ubuntu Desktop 10.10.\nSo, my two questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*how can I install the wireless drivers (and packages I could download etc.) and/or set up the wireless network interface to work properly, and\n\n*how can I connect to a WPA-encrypted wireless network from the command line?\n\n\nEDIT:\nI ended up uninstalling Ubuntu Server and installing Ubuntu Desktop instead, then configuring the wireless network through the GUI and making it boot into command line instead of GNOME.\n\nA: If you don't have wireless drivers, then you will have to figure out a way to get those first, because you obviously will not be able to use your wireless card to get those ;) you can look them up on another computer and install the binaries. More than likely, though, you do already have drivers, but you need to edit your /etc/network/interfaces (as root), which contains interface declarations. It should register your cards once you add the following lines to it:\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\n\nThis will should make ubuntu recognize the cards once you hit /etc/init.d/networking restart and ifup -a.\nOnce you have the wireless card up, you can type iwlist scan to list wireless networks in range. I have only dealt with open and WEP-secured networks, and it works perfectly for those. For those networks, you can use\niwconfig wlan0 essid \"network-name\" ap any key <wep-key>\nI know WPA is possible, but it's a lot more configuration than just using iwconfig.\n\nA: Take a look at this guide for connecting to the network:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=571188\n\nA: I hope I can give you some ideas for your first question, but I only have a definite answer for the second one. \n\n\n*\n\n*Driver installation: for that, you need to know your wireless interface chipset. \nFirst, you need to know the model of the interface you have. (If you don't, run lspci or lsusb and google the line which looks like a wireless device). Then go to http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Devices and find your device model in the appropriate list. There you can find instructions how to install the driver. \n\n\nIf this site tells you that the driver is already part of the kernel, then you have some issue you must troubleshoot. For example, there are two drivers for Ralink, both included with Ubuntu, and when you plug the card in, both drivers try to steer it, so it doesn't work. The solution is to blacklist one of both. For this kind of problem, you will probably have to google something like \"[chipset] wireless card does not work on ubuntu\", this gets you a result much quicker than if you google it without the chipset name. \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect from the command line \n\n\nEdit (or create) the file /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf \nIt needs following code:\n\n    network={\n        ssid=\"networkname\"\n        scan_ssid=1\n        proto=WPA\n        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK\n        pairwise=CCMP\n        group=TKIP\n        psk=\"networkpassword\"\n}\n\nDepending on the router settings, you may need to try out different combinations for pairwise and group (e. g. both CCMP or both TKIP). \nThis solution assumes that you are using the older WPA encryption. If you have WPA 2, it changes to proto=RSN. \nThen connect using the line \n\nsudo wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -D wext -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf \n\nhere you need to write the name of your interface after -i and the name of your driver after -D (you should know both after you have solved 1.)\nI can vouch that this method worked with Intrepid, but haven't used it since. If there is a problem with it, you can look at how to set it up in the man file here.\n", "Q: My hardware needs a module to be blacklisted to work, how can I get this fix shipped? I have an Acer Timeline 1830T. When I install 10.10 and 11.04 it needs to have the acer-wmi module blacklisted for wireless to work.\nI think I need to file a bug on the linux kernel but I am not sure. I've heard the term \"quirk\" being thrown around by developers when it comes to fixing something so that it works on certain pieces of hardware. \nIs this indeed a kernel bug? What steps should I take to ensure that this gets reported so that everyone with my laptop doesn't have to go through this over and over?\n\nA: This is a kernel bug¹, so you'd want to use ubuntu-bug linux in a Terminal.  You'd then want to modify the created bug report to add that you need to blacklist acer-wmi as a workaround for the wireless chipset not working as suspected.\n\n¹ Technically it isn't a kernel bug but probably a combination of broken hardware, BIOS, and kernel drivers.  On the upside, it probably can be hacked around in the kernel, hence the loose use of \"kernel bug.\"\n\nA: Speaking as a member of the Ubuntu Kernel Team, specifically as the 'Kernel Bug Guy', I agree with Daniel's answer as it is the sum of what the Engineers see being the total issue. This is not to discount Oli's answer.\nIn the realm of the highly technical end user, Oli's answer is completely true in that it is a set of the steps we would expect a person of considerable technical acumen to use, however, our intent (and indeed the entire purpose of this site) is to guide the less technical.\nOur main goal must be to provide them with quick and accurate answers that allow them to continue using the software that we build. My favorite saying is, \"If it isn't simple 'they' won't do it.\" The 'they' here referring to whomever the user is at the time.\nHaving said that, and given my personal admiration for the completeness of your post Oli, I have to be honest and say that there are very few readers of this site that will read all of it. They will likely not read all of mine, and that is fine.\nIn the end, Daniel's response is exactly what we need here. It conveys both my and the Team's impression of these issues as well as our preferred method to address.\n\nA: If you want it to go anywhere, don't just file a bug. Of course you should file a bug on Launchpad but that's really just the start of the process of something inherently upstream like this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out what it does\nLook at the code find out what it's supposed to do. If you don't need it, why is it there? Is something else doing its job now? If it's something that's still in demand, why isn't it working for you?\nYou'll quite often see hardware-specific software written for edge cases like a single range of laptops (eg there are dozens of various Thinkpad hardware drivers).\nAccording to its readme, the driver covers wireless, LEDs, bluetooth, 3g and the backlight. To me, it sounds like something you (or others) might want so having it dumped or blacklisted by default might not be desirable.\n\n*Find out how it got installed on your computer\nWhere did it come from? Is it pulled into the kernel? Is it an Ubuntu pull? This will ultimately decide where you need to make your complaint.\nWith kernel-level issues, it really helps to test the latest stable vanilla kernel. You can grab a copy from the mainline repository although you'll probably find there are GCC version mismatches with certain binary-only drivers (I have, with nvidia) so it's not something you'll want to run on all the time IMO.\nIf the problem persists with a vanilla kernel, add a bug upstream and link it to the Launchpad bug and track it backwards too. A nice double-linked bug will help everybody stay on the same page.\nIn this case, it sounds like it's an in-tree kernel driver (ie its source is pulled into the kernel repository and built in).\n\n*Find the person or people responsible for it\nIt's not reasonable to just to dump a bug on Launchpad and hope it finds the right person. I would say only a small portion of developers track their bugs through it so you need to find the maintainers of the software and get in touch.\nIt might feel rude to start cold-emailing people but the software is their baby. If it's not working, I think they'd like to know. Nine times in ten, they'll help you identify the problem too.\nIf it's still maintained, get debugging instructions. Check to make sure your hardware is compatible.\nIf it's not maintained, and you can confirm that with the old maintainer, file a bug in the kernel alerting people that there's a portion of code rotting and that it's causing you issues.\n\n*Suggest action to the right people\nWhen you know what the problem is, don't keep it to yourself. Make sure you take action on your bugs.\nIf it's something that can be fixed in the driver, chase people in the kernel up to get the new version pulled into the development release. Ask about having it backported to 2.6.35 for existing Ubuntu users. Talk to the Kernel team about pulling in the changes to the Maverick kernel (though you might not have any luck there).\nIf it's rotting, push the core kernel developers to dump it from their repo. Ask the Ubuntu kernel team developers to remove it from their repo. At the least, ask for it to be blacklisted (how some modules have been forcibly been removed by Ubuntu in the past).\nIf you get good turnaround on fixing/destroying the driver, it should be possible to get its fix into the final Natty kernel (which is still at -next stage in the proper kernel repo).\nThe point I'm trying to get across is when you do your own triage and talk to the right people, things get so much more attention and have such a higher chance of a good end result.\nAnd by no means stop if you see another person with the same problem. Subscribe to it, comment on their bug, ask what they've found, ask what they've done about it... And then carry on. Don't rely on them to get your problem solved.\nThis is how open source is supposed to work. Collaboration through good, open communication. Communicate your problem well, help where you can and you stand a good chance of getting better quality software.\n", "Q: Can Unity based on Compiz already be fully used? Last, time several month ago, I installed Unity to test it in maverick. I had the problem that it didn't work as expected.\nInstead of Unity I only got a white screen, I'm not 100% sure what the problem was, but it should have to do with my Radeon Xpress graphics card I think.\nIs there another method of getting Unity to work together with this graphics card in Maverick?\n\nA: Unity in Natty (based on Compiz) works quite well on my r700 and Cedar (HD 4xxx and HD 5xxx cards), with the exception of some crash bugs that are getting fixed.  As far as I'm aware, the older r300-r500 cards work better, so your problem probably doesn't exist in Natty.\nOf course, that requires running Natty, which at this stage (between Alpha 1 and 2) is not necessarily a good idea for any machine you need to work!\nWhy not try a LiveCD - you'll be able to test Unity with minimal risk to your system.\n\nA: Unity Compiz is only available if you are using Ubuntu 11.04, which is still in early development.\nAt one point the Ubuntu developers were planning on backporting Unity Compiz to 10.10, but they later decided against it:\n\nHi everybody,\nAs some of you may know, there have been some discussions about\n  backporting\n  \"unity compiz\" to maverick as we had backported unity to lucid with a\n  dedicated ppa and its own session.\nHowever, after some porting discussions and following the natty work I\n  think\n  we should perhaps consider not doing that because it's going to take\n  quite\n  some work for a moderated benefit and we would better spend those\n  efforts in\n  making natty rocking. \n\n\nA: I don't fully understand your question, but the new compiz-based unity is not available for Maverick. For now, stick with the old GNOME Desktop.\n", "Q: Mouse's forward and back buttons don't work I have two buttons on my mouse to go forwards and back:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*They used to work all right in Firefox, but now they don't any more. I've since switched to Google Chrome (the package from google.com/chrome, not chromium). \n\n*I haven't changed any configuration to do with input devices in the mean time.\n\n*xev doesn't seem to recognize the buttons. The others work well. Even the weird zoom-slider on this mouse is recognized by xev. It's only the forwards and back buttons that don't do anything.\nHow do I get them to work?\nThe mouse is a Logitech VX Revolution in case that's important. \nEdit at Dec. 10th, 11pm:\nThe back button has just started working, after an update. I'm confused. :P\nThe forwards button still doesn't work. xev recognizes the back button now, not the other one.\n\nA: The mouse is just broken. I've tested it on another machine, doesn't work either. I've since bought a new one, works perfectly.\nThe thing not working in xev should've been a good clue. \n", "Q: If Unity will be touch friendly, will window buttons become easier to touch? Some people say that Unity is touch friendly and I even saw a video of an Ubuntu developer showing it off on a Dell touch screen.\nIt looks touch friendly and all but the window buttons still look too tiny to be touch friendly. There could be a gesture or something to close the windows easily, but not everyone will know about them and will aim at the little buttons.\n\nA: Gestures will be the easiest method for closing windows in touch environment. There have been several ideas discussing how to improve the window button in a touch environment, however no firm decisions have been made. Ideas range from making the buttons grow bigger on tap (so you have a bigger hit area) to having just plain ol huge buttons.\n", "Q: Where are Empathy's contact-links stored? I linked a bunch of contacts from MSN and Google Talk with the new empathy feature, Now I want to export this configuration to my desktop so i don't have to make the same changes again and again.\nDoes anyone know where this contact-linking configuration is stored? I didn't find it under ~/.config, ~/.local/share or ~/.mission-control.\n\nA: \nthe links are in ~/.local/share/folks/relationships.ini\n\nAn empathy developer just answered me on his blog. \n", "Q: CS4326/7 sound chipset on Thinkpad 600E OK, I know this has been a problem for a while, and I know by now this really old Pentium II laptop is really really really obsolete. However, I have installed Lubuntu 10.10 on this laptop and things seem to work fine except the sound.\nNow I've read and gone through a bunch of tutorials and guides to working around this, none of which have worked. I have gone through this Ubuntu bug report and that doesn't work either.\nThe problem I think is that the latest workaround is (understandably) about two Ubuntu versions behind. Now I'm not sure what has changed since then to make that workaround not work, but I would appreciate any help.\nThanks\n\nA: OK... I figured it out. Basically you need to follow the instructions in the above linked Ubuntu bug report pertaining to Ubuntu 9.10. Those need to be followed to every last detail. That is you need to make sure that you initialize the bios AND THEN disable bios quick boot. \nYou also need to ensure that you are using ALSA. I give credit here to Mr. Brooks for drawing attention to this. He suggested using gstreamer-properties to ensure this. That is what I used. The problem is it isn't installed in Lubuntu 10.10 by default. To get it you need to install the gnome-media package from the repositories. Then alt+f2 and run gstreamer-properties. Under default output, select ALSA as the plugin, and default as the device, then press test. If you've done everything in that order, you should be hearing the sweet sweet sound of victory.\nSide Note: Along the way I ended up also installing some gstreamer plugins including the gstreamer alsa plugin. So if the above alone doesn't work, go ahead and install that then try gstreamer properties again (after a reboot). Good Hunting!\n\nA: Did you disable Quick Boot in the BIOS setup?  And then Initialize the BIOS.  I have a 600E running 10.10 and the sound works fine after completing those 2 steps and then make sure you use the ALSA or OSS driver and not PulseAudio (I use ALSA).\n", "Q: Poor compiz performance on NVidia 9500 GT I have just installed Ubuntu on both my laptop and my workstation. \n\n\n*\n\n*My laptop is a somewhat older one, with a 2Ghz centrino Core 2 Duo processor, an NVidia GeForce Go 7300 graphics card, and 2 gigabytes of system RAM. Compiz+Emerald works flawless and super fast on this computer in every aspect. \n\n*My workstation is a dual core (not Core Duo) 2.5GHz system, with a 1GB GeForce 9500GT card and 4 gigabytes of system RAM. 3D performance with Compiz is super slow here though, and other operations feel heavy as well. Opening a new tab in Firefox for example takes a couple of seconds. \nBoth computers have the same driver version installed (173.14.28).\nI am new to this OS, any suggestions on how I could improve performance on my workstation? Many thanks!\n\nA: My first question would be which version of Ubuntu did you install.  Regardless though, that seems to be a fairly old driver for the 9500gt. If you go to System > Administration > Additional Drivers, you should see that there are 2 choices, one of which is the 173 driver you have. The other one is a much more recent version (260.19.06), at least in the latest Ubuntu version, which is 10.10, it is. You want to activate this version. 173 is meant to maintain support for older cards.\n\nA: It just so happens my testing video card (An awesome playing card) is the 9500 hehe. Ok if you had 10.04 and changed to 10.10 you WILL notice an improvement in every game. In my case WOW, l4d1, l4d2. Anyway yo be sure you have the latest drivers do the following:\nGo in the menu to System > Administration > Additional Drivers and install the one that says RECOMMENDED. It is the one with version 260.\nAfter that reset the PC. Then go to in the menu to System > Administration > Nvidia Settings and change the resolution and any other stuff you want to change. There is an option to change the behaviour from Quality to Performance. I really suggest performance.\nIf you can not use the menu for some reason or do not understand the above then do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press ALT+F2 which should open a small command box.\n\n*Type jockey-gtk and press enter. it will open the Additional Drivers windows which will show you the Nvidia drivers. just install the one that says Recommended which is the latest for the one you have.\n\n*Reboot your PC then ALT+F2 again. This time, type nvidia-settings and press enter.\n\n*configure the nvidia-settings. Enjoy the games with full power!\n\n\nNOTE - You can have both drivers installed and it wont give you problems. Although i recommend to remove the one you have and install the new one.\n", "Q: How can I change another user's \"About Me\" photo? Is there a way for a user with administrative privileges to change another user's \"About Me\" photo?\n\nA: This can be done by replacing the .face file located in the user's home directory with a new photo.\nFor example, to change the photo for user bob:\nsudo cp new_photo.jpg /home/bob/.face \nsudo chmod 0644 /home/bob/.face \nsudo chown bob /home/bob/.face\n\nNOTE: Not all image formats will work, so stick to PNG and JPEG.\n", "Q: Can I set a default \"About Me\" photo? Is there a way to set a default \"About Me\" photo so that all users created in the future start off with the same user image on the login screen?\n\nA: Yes, simply place an image file named .face in /etc/skel. \nsudo cp new_photo.jpg /etc/skel/.face \n\nNOTE: Not all image formats will work, so stick to PNG and JPEG.\nThe /etc/skel directory contains files and directories that are automatically copied over to a new user's home directory when the user is created. \n\nThe name of the directory skel is derived from the word skeleton, because the files it contains form the basic structure for users' home directories.\n\nSource: http://www.linfo.org/etc_skel.html\n", "Q: Hard Disk Spins Down as long as Battery is in Laptop I just figured out today that as long as the battery is in my laptop, it doesn't matter if it's fully charged while plugged in, Ubuntu always spins down my hard drive. I noticed this because there was a huge difference in speed when I removed the batteries. \nMy settings for power management is basically:\n\n\n*\n\n*on AC power, don't spin down\nharddrive, dont suspend or anything\n\n*on battery power, basically save as\nmuch power as possible\n\n\nI assumed that if I plug in my laptop, it'll use the On AC Power settings no matter what but apparently, this isn't so. Is there a way to \"fix\" this?\n\nA: I think you need to eliminate if you have a battery problem. If you remove the battery and just run on the charger and the problem goes away it could be a battery that is pulling too much current and the system would go bonkers because the little external charger can't handle the load. You can check the battery by giving it a full charge then run on battery in Windows if you have Dual boot or a live CD other than Ubuntu. If you still have the problem it is probably the battery. If not it's likely a software problem. Good luck.  Maury\n\nA: You could try editing these settings in gconf-editor:\ngconf-editor /apps/gnome-power-manager/disks\n\n", "Q: How well is the HFS+ filesystem supported? How well does Ubuntu support HFS+ (i.e. Mac formatted) filesystems? Can it read and write to them, and are there any potential problems to watch out for?\n\nA: The kernel supports basic read support - however, journaling support is nearly non-existent which is needed for write support. By default most modern Macs (which utilize the HFS+ Filesystem) have Journaling enabled. For write support you'll need to first disable journaling on the HFS+ Partition:\nsudo diskutil disableJournal [VolumeName]\nThen, if needed, re-enable with:\nsudo diskutil enableJournal [VolumeName]\nHowever, as a warning - Journaling is an important part of any Filesystem which implements it. Disabling it in Mac OSX is not recommended and  can have adverse affects. There has been work to include journaling support for the HFS+ driver in the kernel - but that it still some time away.\n\nA: SuperUser has a great answer for mounting HFS+ partitions in read/write mode here:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/84446/how-to-mount-a-hfs-partition-in-ubuntu-as-read-write\n\nA: Looking at the HFS+ driver in the kernel, it seems to have read & write support, but I have absolutely no idea how stable/useful/etc. it is...\n", "Q: Sometimes keyboard & touchpad work... sometimes not When I first ran Ubuntu from CD on this Dell Inspiron 2650, it worked for about ten to fifteen minutes, then it hung (I was probably trying to do too much at once from a Live CD). The next time, my mouse and keyboard didn't work. I rebooted three times and finally got them working. I then installed Ubuntu alongside Windows XP.\nAfter installing, selecting the OS in GRUB worked, but my touchpad and keyboard were again not working. I rebooted, and they worked. (I fortunately had a USB mouse with which to reboot.)\nBooting Ubuntu and then rebooting to enable my keyboard and touchpad has become a routine ever since. Often several reboots are required; at one point I had to reboot over a dozen times in a row before getting a session where everything worked properly. (My installation has been in place for about three days a week now.) I've looked around for a device manager equivalent to no avail.\nSometimes the hardware is properly detected, and sometimes it's not. Once or twice I've had the keyboard detected properly but the touchpad not.\nPlugging in my wireless card also sometimes requires a plug, unplug, and plug again to get it working.\nSo is there some solution? I'm without an Internet connection at home, and this \"laptop\" is really a wall wart on my desk, so suggestions for packages may take a while to test.\nXorg logs\nI captured two three four sample Xorg logs: one from a startup where the devices worked; one from when they didn't; one from a session where Ubuntu thought my touchpad was a normal mouse; and one from a session where my keyboard worked but the touchpad didn't.\nSee this gist. Updated 2010-12-15 01:50 UTC with Xorg.0.log.keyboardonly file illustrating the case where the keyboard worked but not the touchpad. Updated 2011-01-11 04:10 UTC with Xorg.0.log.touchpadregmouse to illustrate a case where the touchpad was detected as a regular mouse (no \"Touchpad\" tab in mouse prefs).\n\nA: I am working on a friends Laptop Dell inspiron 2650.  Once I get the keyboard and touchpad to work, I set up the power button to hibernate and to hibernate when the lid is closed.  Then, I never completely shut it down.  It hibernates when i press power button and when close lid.  I only have one logon because when I had two and I would log out of one to log into the other, it would stop working.  This is a great workaround until I figure it out.  So far so good.  I've even taken the battery out and as long as it is hybernating, it works when I wake it back up.  \n", "Q: How do I restore compiz advanced zoom? I lost compiz zoom due to some incompatibility that I am not sure about. I read about a fix before, but I forgot what it is. When I try to zoom with the super key and mouse it just vibrates the cursor.\nAfter further testing to find the problem, I know it has to be something that is trying to put the pointer to the centre of the screen. Hopefully someone will be able to track down the cause, because so far I cannot.\nEDIT - I've tried all kinds of options, including resetting all the settings on the plugin, still no change. I can't zoom, even if I change the keys. If it helps, restraining the mouse to the zoom area makes it jump to one side of the screen.\nCould it be that I have dual outputs that is causing the problem?\n\nA: This is caused by a bug when using dual monitors. As far as I know the only current fix is to unplug a monitor. You may be able to get it working by editing the General options in ccsm to not autodetect outputs and instead manually specify your monitors' sizes and positions.\n\nA: If you're also using the desktop cube, make sure you have \"multiple cubes\" selected in the desktop cubes \"Multi Output Mode\" list.\n", "Q: My Ubuntu partition is NTFS? A while ago I put Ubuntu on my Windows computer. It was awesome, for a while. One day I restart my computer and it boots with an error message.\nerror: No such device ###############################\ngrub-rescue>\n\nI couldn't boot to Windows or Ubuntu anymore... When I finally acquired a Live boot CD. I reinstalled grub2 and tried to boot again, but of course it's not configured to boot to anything (still need to figure out how to do that).

I'll happily give you more information if you ask.\n\nA: As Takkat said, you will need to fix your MBR using windows tools from Windows installation CD. After your windows boot successfully you can use EasyBCD from here to add Ubuntu entry into widnows boot menu. This way you will get your Ubuntu back. There is a nice tutorial on how to add Wubi Ubuntu entry back to your Windows boot menu at http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/20340/how-to-restore-the-wubi-ubuntu-bootloader/\n\nA: After erroneous Grub2 installation to the MBR of your harddisk you will have to run Windows tools from the installation CD as described in detail in KB927392. To completely rewrite your Master Boot Record you will have to boot the Windows recovery environment. There you will be able to run the tool\nbootrex.exe /FixMbr\n\nto write a new boot record. Option /FixBoot will write a new partition record.\nYou will then hopefully be able to boot Windows again. For further installations having Ubuntu and Windows on the same machine I recommend a dual boot setup, installing Windows first.\n", "Q: How can I add and change items in my Applications Menu?

If you need to convert your image to jpg beforehand, just use imagemagick's convert utility and run convert logo.png logo.jpg.\nThere is often a need to fiddle with the jp2a options to specify the characters used, the size of the ascii, or to invert the representation. Once you get the settings right you can get good results, however, as I display in the screenshot below. The results do, however, depend a lot on the image you have chosen to convert to ascii. \nAs an example, I have used the following command to do an ascii representation of the Ubuntu logo, which displays on the terminal screen and also saves to file: (This assumes the input ubuntu-logo.jpg is in your present working directory)\njp2a -i --chars=\"..00xx@@\" ubuntu-logo.jpg | tee ubuntu-logo.txt\n\n\n\nA: TOIlet \nI've seen TOIlet, I think that is what you're looking for.\n\nA: Taking a step further, if you like to learn a new command with ascii art generated cartoon character like shown below.\n\n\nYou can use cowsay utility and put a simple one line to learn new command.\ninstalling cowsay\nsudo apt-get install cowsay\n\nadd below line to your .bashrc or .zshrc file located at ~/ i.e ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to get an ascii art character \ncowsay -f $(ls /usr/share/cowsay/cows | shuf -n 1 | cut -d. -f1) $(whatis $(ls /bin) 2>/dev/null | shuf -n 1)\n\nCheers\n\nA: If you want a talking cow there is cowsay :\n$ cowsay hello!\n ________\n< hello! >\n --------\n        \\   ^__^\n         \\  (oo)\\_______\n            (__)\\       )\\/\\\n                ||----w |\n                ||     ||\n\n\nA: There is a Java Application JaVE that does what you are looking for.\nAnother, CLI based project would be AA-lib.\n\nA: I love Linux-logo ( http://www.deater.net/weave/vmwprod/linux_logo/ ).\nTry adding it to the start of any terminal.

I use Chromium. Many times, I am following links, from one page to another, and I am done with the current tab and don't want to open a link that might possibly open in a new tab. I tried some combination of Ctrl, Shift, Alt and mouse click, but the link still opens in a new tab.

As a result, I'm now dual-booting Fedora 14 and Ubuntu Maverick with a shared home directory.\nEverything seems to work, but one glaring problem is the fact that the gtk theme configured for each OS seems to conflict.  If I set the default system theme in Fedora, then it looks broken in Ubuntu.  If I do the same in Ubuntu, it is broken in Fedora.  I'm under the impression that it should be possible to have each OS use a separate theme, and the following tutorial confirms this, but doesn't mention how it is achieved:\nhttp://www.hackourlives.com/dual-boot-ubuntu-10-04-and-fedora-13-goddard-with-shared-home/\nAs shown, I want to use Fedora's theme in Fedora, and Ubuntu's theme in Ubuntu.  How can I have Fedora's and Ubuntu's respective themes co-exist peacefully?\n\nA: You can fix this by changing where gconf stores its configuration data for each distro.\nThe config file is in /etc/gconf/2/path in each distro.  So you're going to want to edit this file once in your fedora partition, and once in your ubuntu partition.  The config option you want is in this line:\n# The default storage location, ~/.gconf\n# This should be the only readwrite source\nxml:readwrite:$(HOME)/.gconf\n\nYou can change it to something like xml:readwrite:$(HOME)/.gconf_ubuntu for ubuntu, or add _fc for fedora, or whatever you'd like.  This way, ubuntu stores its settings in a separate place from where fedora does, so they won't clobber each other.  Apps that don't use gconf (firefox, etc.) will still share configuration.\nYou can also change some of the other \"include\"s in the User Preferences section and rename them depending on the distro you're using.\nWe use this for shared NFS homes at work and it seems to work great.\n", "Q: Missing Thumbnails for .swf files in Nautilus? Before I upgraded to Maverick, .swf files used to have a thumbnail in Nautilus.\nHowever, Nautilus doesn't generate thumbnails for them anymore, even after removing ~/.thumbnails/, which most likely indicates that a package is missing.\nHow do I get Nautilus to generate thumbnails for .swf files?\nEDIT: I've added a bounty, as I believe this question might still be answered...\n\nA: The thumbnails were made with libswfdec (i.e. /usr/bin/swfdec-thumbnailer from the package swfdec-gnome), which was removed in Ubuntu 10.10 (\"maverick\").  The libswfdec author stopped development because there are already 2 other open source projects working on implementing an SWF player: gnash (which is included in Ubuntu) & lightspark (which is new and not included yet).  I am not sure if there exists a thumbnailer that uses gnash...\n\nA: There is a way of getting this done explained in the Floorplanner Tech Blog. To compile dump-gnash on a fresh Maverick you'll need \nsudo apt-get install gcc libboost-dev libboost-thread-dev libagg-dev libsdl1.2-dev libcairo-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev libatk1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgtkglext1-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgif-dev libjpeg-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev libspeex-dev libcurl-dev\n\nAnd then you just follow the steps. This will take a long time.\nNOTE: For Step 7 use the following script instead:\nif [[ $3 ]]; then\n    raw=\"$(mktemp)\"\n    dump-gnash $2 -P \"FlashVars=url=file://$1\" -D \"$raw\" --max-advances 1 -j 500 -k 500\n    tail -c 1MB \"$raw\" | convert -size 500x500 -depth 8 rgba:- -separate -swap 0,2 -combine -trim png:\"$3\"\n    trap \"rm $raw\" EXIT\nelse\n    echo \"Insufficient arguments (expected 3 arguments)\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nOnce you have the final script running you just hook it into gconf-editor\ngconftool-2 -s \"/desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/application@swf\" -t string \"/usr/bin/swfthumbnailer.sh %s %i %o\"\ngconftool-2 -s \"/desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/application@swf/enable\" -t boolean 'true'\ngconftool-2 -s \"/desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/application@x-swf\" -t string \"/usr/bin/swfthumbnailer.sh %s %i %o\"\ngconftool-2 -s \"/desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/application@x-swf/enable\" -t boolean 'true'\ngconftool-2 -s \"/desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/application@x-shockwave-flash/command\" -t string \"/usr/bin/swfthumbnailer.sh %s %i %o\"\ngconftool-2 -s \"/desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/application@x-shockwave-flash/enable\" -t boolean 'true'\n\nThen restart (or restart gnome-settings-daemon), and you've got swf thumbs!\nP.S.: This is a huge hack. A better way to do this would be vastly appreciated.\n\nA: The closest thing I've been able to find is perhaps using ffmmpegthumbnailer to create thumbnails for you and that should handle the .swf files.\nThis blog post has the instructions. \n\nA: Simplest answer should simply be to install swfdec-gnome, but the Lucid version. Not hard to do, just go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/da/lucid/swfdec-gnome and select your architecture. Then just do what you did previously to make it work; it seems to just randomly kick in for me, as I recall. Maybe after a log out/restart.

I was a bit curious to know what a distribution (i.e. 10.04 to 10.10) upgrade really means. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems the update manager is constantly upgrading every piece of software on my computer and as I understand it, Ubuntu is a \"collection\" of open source software. With that in mind, I would be curious to know what really goes into a distribution upgrade in practice.\n\nA: Everyday update -> security fixes, minor improvements - (all software you use stays at the same version, which is a bit older than current, but much more stable)\nDistribution upgrade -> new features, new pieces of software, major changes - (every part of your ubuntu gets upgraded to new version, that was developed since last ubuntu release)\n\nA: Unless you've added extra repositories, Update Manager will only offer to install stable release updates, which are updates that fix either high-impact bugs, or security vulnerabilities. Some rare exceptions notwithstanding, they don't provide new upstream versions of software that constitutes Ubuntu.\nA distribution upgrade, on the other hand, does: it takes you from one Ubuntu stable release to the next, thus most packages you have installed will typically be updated to new upstream versions.\n\nA: Ubuntu upgrades an installed software which getting to the Official repository (only). Mostly they're security updates. IMHO, if Ubuntu will become a rolling release, we would have more updates of all installed software (I hope without need of additional PPAs), and possibly a 'distribution update/upgrade' will become an insignificant action :)  \nBest wishes,\nVincenzo\n", "Q: Boot screen in low graphics/text mode My ubuntu boot screen shows up in a strange low resolution, almost text mode, instead the usual and sleek white \"ubuntu\" over dark background.

I have the same problem with Firefox 4.0 b8. is this a bug with openjdk,firefox or ubuntu? Is there any way to solve the problem?\n\nA: You might want to try the official Sun (Oracle) Java client, instead of the OpenJDK one.  To do so, run synaptic from System/Administration/Synaptic, then click on Settings/Repositories, then choose the \"Other Software\" tab.  Now put a tick next to \"Canonical Partners\" and okay that and reload your packages.\nNow search for \"JRE\".  Remove the \"openjdk\" packages, and select the \"sun-java6\" packages.

It plays standard definition videos fine, but high def videos are 'jerky', I am assume this is because my hardware can't handle it.\nAny suggestions on the minimum spec in terms of CPU, GPU and RAM that will be able to handle HD video while playing nice with Ubuntu?\n\nA: While your hardware is a bit dated, it can be made to play 1080p with a few expenses.\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy some more system memory\nRAM is very cheap these days.

NVidias graphics cards support accelerating HD playback with the Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix, VDPAU. It might be a bit of a pain to set up, from what I've read so far. \nNVidias cards supporting this technology are marked as supporting Pure Video. One of them is the NVidia GeForce 9500 1GB, which, here, costs rougly 50€ at the time of writing this. Someone on the german VDR wiki reports that a card slower than this, the 9400, will play back 1080p no problem.\nYou shouldn't have to spend more than 100£ on both the graphics card and the memory to get HD playback to work smoothly.

Is there a way to have a log of when SSH tunnels are created and by which (local) users, or, if that's not possible, only allow some users to do so?\n\nA: You want to make sure /etc/ssh/sshd_config contains \nAllowTcpForwarding no\n\nand then at the end of the file put\nMatch User yourusername\n    AllowTcpForwarding yes\n\nThis will allow you and only you to port-forward to your hearts content, but as João said you wont be able to prevent them runing their own programs unless you also disable shell access.\n\nA: Note that while you can disable TCP Forwarding by sshd, you need to go a lot further to restrict your users' outgoing activity. Giving them a shell means giving them a lot of power.\nFor instance, if they can scp files to the server and execute files in /home, they can simply upload a pppd binary, and use that to run PPP over SSH. If you allow incoming connections they can just run /usr/sbin/sshd -p 9999 -f special_sshd_config and use your server through that sshd.\nYou may want to look into iptables owner module (man iptables, search for owner) and chroot jails, but this is really hard to solve without ruining their shell experience.\n\nA: If your friends are able to SSH onto your computer, they are using some of your bandwidth and it is therefore impossible to completely block them access to your Internet connection.\nThat being said, one solution would be to limit what your friends can do with your connection. You could set up a firewall that whitelists your friend's IPs and blacklists everything else. That way, your friends could SSH onto your computer but from there, wouldn't be able to reach any other IP than their own.\nI have never setup a user specific firewall myself, but I believe it is possible to achieve with IPTables. Also, keep in mind that your users could still eat up a lot of your bandwidth by uploading big files on your server. If you specifically want to prevent this, you would have to limit bandwidth per user.\n\nA: The only option I am ware of is to disable tunneling at the system level.\nEdit /etc/ssh/sshd_config, and change/add \nAllowTcpForwarding no\n\nPlease note that while having shell access there is no way to prevent users from using their own binaries for forwarding connections.\n\nA: This has been asked on serverfault, too https://serverfault.com/questions/181660/how-do-i-log-ssh-port-forwards and there's a patch: http://blog.rootshell.be/2009/03/01/keep-an-eye-on-ssh-forwarding/\n\nA: First iteration:  \nDisable ssh forwarding for them. in ssh\nYou enable IPSec for yourself and VPN to your server.

By good podcast support I mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*resuming the audio files where I\nswitched off the player or skipped\nthe file.\n\n*Synching with my podcatcher\n(currently I'm using Miro but I could\nchange): deleting episodes, I\nlistened to and copy new ones from my\nHDD to the player.\n\n*A wifi capable player would be great since I wouldn't need to switch on the computer but this is not mandatory.\n\n\nI also have an additional condition: The player should not be manufactured by Apple.\n\nA: I have a Sandisk Sansa Clip, which can be used in MSC- or MTP-Mode. It plays ogg files and can resume podcasts.\nIt is recognized well with ubuntu/banshee.\nThe only problem is, that the player's podcast folder is outside the music folder. But banshee stores podcasts in music/podcasts. So the player doesn't recognize all podcasts as podcast. The unrecognized files are treated as music and resume after you switch the player off, but doesn't remember the last position, when skipping the file.\nWhen using the player with banshee, you have to manually define which episodes you heard with the player after that it automatically synchronizes your new episodes and removes the old ones.\n\nA: A rather savvy Linux developer recommended Cowon to my lady, and she's been quite happy with it...\n", "Q: By default, what system messages get mailed to root? I recently installed ssmtp on my server to enable e-mail notifications for a redmine install.  While I was verifying everything was setup correctly I got an e-mail notification about a failed cron job.  This turned out to be really helpful and I never would have noticed it had I not set this up.\nIt's been a few days since and I haven't received any other e-mails from the system.  By default, what mail gets sent to root?\n\nA: By default, cron will mail all output from cron jobs to the owner of the job, whether they fail or not.  (Root is the owner of the system cron job, and is configured as the mail destination for non-root daemon cron jobs.)  Most system cron jobs are carefully written not to produce output unless something is wrong.\nAny other program can send mail to root, but not many will in a default Ubuntu install.  Things I have seen include\n\n\n*\n\n*in Debian, some programs will send mail when they are not properly configured, but I have not seen this recently in Ubuntu\n\n*mdraid sends mail when an array fails or is restored\n\n*apcupsd sends mail when the machine loses AC power\n\n*uptimed sends mail when you pass a milestone or record\n\n\nIf you're writing your own cron jobs you can set MAILTO to control where the output is sent.

It's all great, except that Hibernate and Suspend aren't usable.\nYes, I know that questions about power-save issues are rampant in the Linux support universe, but it seems that every time I find a solution it's for a very specific hardware combination and doesn't apply to me. So anyway, here goes.\nWhen I resume from either power-saving mode, I'll get graphics problems anywhere on the range from a few scattered random-colored pixels that won't change; all the way to full-screen patterns that don't change as I move the mouse, hit keys on the keyboard, or even bring up the shutdown dialog using the power button.\nThose full-screen issues (which may involve stripes with random pixels, partial black screen, or both) always end in me forcing the machine to shut down by holding the power button.\nI haven't done much testing yet to determine what severity level is most commonly associated with each mode, but I do avoid using either power-save option because of these issues.\nI'll add info on my hardware as I can gather it (no home internet connection, and this laptop is tethered to my desk by a dead battery and casing degradation). Please feel free to request something specific in the question comments.\nHardware Info\nSee this hardinfo report for my system's hardware configuration. (No, my username is not \"myuser\"; I sanitized hardinfo's output before publishing it.)\nScreenshots\nThese screenshots are from a relatively mild occurrence, which happened after the second hibernation I took that session. The first one worked great, though I used the wireless card and Firefox heavily between the two hibernation attempts.\n\nTake a look at what happened when I opened my home directory in Nautilus and scrolled it:\n\nSee below for the situations I've tested so far. The real trouble comes when the machine resumes to an unusable state; in such cases I can't even unlock the screen or properly reboot, much less take a screenshot. I have a hunch that putting a CD in the drive will cause such major failures, and I will try that at some point; see related question.\nSituations Tested\nMaverick (10.10)\nSuspend\n\n*\n\n*Seems to suspend nicely with nothing running\n\n*Seems to suspend nicely with flash drive plugged in\n\n*On resume from suspend with no flash drive, Terminal and gedit running: Funky graphics on top of log output, then blank screen with pixelated cursor; no response to power button (normally will shutdown 60 seconds later)\n\nHibernate\n\n*\n\n*Seems to hibernate nicely with nothing running\n\n*Seems to hibernate nicely with a few apps (Terminal, Mouse preferences) running\n\n*Seems to not hibernate when flash drive plugged in\n\n*Seems to not hibernate when System Monitor is running\n\n*Have encountered failed hibernation (after several hours and one successful hibernate/thaw cycle) with no external media connected and no programs running except normal background stuff\n\nNatty LiveCD (11.04_2010-12-22)\nWhen I tested it, Natty wouldn't stay logged in.

I originally started an Ubuntu forums post about this but I never received any responses.  Anyways, I've got my Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos folders pointing to Samba shares on my server via CIFS volumes mounted in my fstab file. The problem is I end up with duplicate entries in the Places menu.\nI can remove the bookmarks for those folders but then the menu looks ugly as the mounted volumes are still displayed and I can't find a way change their icons in the menu.  I've circled the offending menu entries in the screenshot.  How can I hide them?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*You can hide the volumes in Places Menu.Type the following in terminal to create a new file hide-partitions.rules under /etc/udev/rules.d \nsudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/hide-partitions.rules\n\n*Now copy/paste the following to hide-partitions.rules \n\nACTION!=\"add|change\", GOTO=\"hide_partition_end\"\n  SUBSYSTEM!=\"block\", GOTO=\"hide_partition_end\"\n  KERNEL==\"loop*|ram*\", GOTO=\"hide_partition_end\"\n  KERNEL==\"sda5\", ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}=\"1\"\n  LABEL=\"hide_partition_end\"    \n\n\n*Save the file and close it.\n\n*Now we are going to hide the partition sda6(Stuffs) from Places Menu.\n\n\n*Edit the fstab file  \nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\n*Put a # in front of the line       \nUUID=B630D52430D4EC7D /media/sda6  ntfs-3g  defaults,locale=en_IN  0  0\n\n*So it becomes \n#UUID=B630D52430D4EC7D /media/sda6  ntfs-3g   defaults,locale=en_IN  0  0 \n\n*Save the file.\n\n*Reboot the sytem.\n\n*Now the volume Stuffs will be removed from the Places Menu.\n\n\nA: @fluteflute:  The answer in the question you linked helped guide me to a workable solution.

Unity appears to be working, though there's no side-menu like I'm using to seeing in UNE.  Alt+Tab doesn't switch Windows either.\n\nA: I believe you mean netbook-launcher-efl and not Unity.

Since you are talking about the .bash_profile, I am guessing you want to start via console instead of an interactive desktop.\nThe difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*.bashrc is the one that you edit when you want to change the way xterm or gnome-terminal open the console. how the bash works in this interactive places.\n\n*.bash_profile is the one you edit when you want to change how bash works when you login via console (Like the same way you login to a Ubuntu server or when you press CTRL+ALT+F1 to start a terminal)\nSince .bash_profile does not come by default, you can just create it. But as I understand the default .bash_profile is now called .profile which can be seen in the HOME directory. Both, .bashrc and .profile can be edited to change how bash works in both, interactive and console modes.\nNOTE: If by some way you create .bash_profile, then Ubuntu wont read .profile but instead go directly to .bash_profile since both of them are the same but .bash_profile has more compatibility because of old ways. So basically you do not need .bash_profile if you have .profile. So just remember:\n.bashrc - Interactive Console/Terminal (Gnome, KDE, Xfce...)\n.profile - TTY Console/Terminal\n\nA: Try\nman bash\n\nand look at the INVOCATION section. That will explain how bash starts up.\n\nA: Look at .profile instead. I believe it loads that first then .bashrc.\n.profile is loaded with each login. .bashrc is invoked with each subshell creation, including any subshells created within vi, emacs etc.\n", "Q: Ncurses prompts look broken in PuTTY from Windows Byobu looks very broken in PuTTY.

Does anyone know of any software or solution I can use to listen to Audible audiobook files in Ubuntu? I'd rather not have to use Wine but I'm just wondering what other people have come up with.\n\nA: Update August 2020:\nThey removed .aa files from the website, you can now only download .aax. Support confirmed that .aa files are no longer available for download and recommends to install their tracking app instead.\nThe .aax files can also be converted with ffmpeg, but you need your unique \"activation bytes\":\nffmpeg -activation_bytes AABBCCDD -i YOURBOOK.aax -codec copy OUTPUT.aac\n\nThe activation bytes can be found by a few methods:\n\n*\n\n*Temporarily install the app and grab the /data/data/com.audible.application/files/AudibleActivation.sys file. Because Android hates it when people can access their own files, you probably need root to do this. Then use either this script, or just grab the first four bytes as hexadecimals in little-endian (backwards notation; reverse them).\n\n*Using the Audible Activator. This didn't work for me, perhaps because I am using Audible Germany, but it has been a while and it seems to work for other people.\n\n\nOriginal method for .aa files:\nIn your library, near the right top corner, you can select \"Normal Quality\" (formerly called \"Format 4\"). The download links will change to .aa files. From what I understand, they're a weird kind of mp3 which is easily converted using ffmpeg. This option (to pick Format 4) is only available if your browser's user agent looks like a Linux system.\nTo convert .aa files to MP3, the simplest way (easiest to remember) is this:\nffmpeg -i downloaded_file.aa output.mp3\n\nThe -i option just specifies the input file. The output file needs no option. This will, however, will re-encode the file (losing a little bit of quality, and it's slow).\nIt is better (10× faster) to use the 'stream copy' feature:\nffmpeg -i downloaded_file.aa -codec copy output.mp3\n\n\nPlease do not use this for piracy. If this is used for illegal copying, Audible will just disable downloading these files and make life a bitch for everyone (except for the pirates: they will always find a way, e.g. loopback recording, which is annoying, but it works). I am posting this to make it possible to use free software to read your books, and to be able to use apps like Smart AudioBook Player (which has more features and is not locked to a single vendor).\nWarning to pirates: they leave markers in files so it can be traced back if someone uploads it. These markers are impossible to hear. Of course they're not telling us what they do exactly, but I've read scientific papers where they managed to find the markers very reliably even after they mangled the files into different formats, played at variable 0.9-1.1x speed, etc. See these Google Scholar results as example.\n\nA: You can use mplayer in terminal.

It is a simple, and easy-to-use software which you can use to convert audible files to .mp3.\n\n\nA: Note: this solution has been originally tested for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Firefox 42.0. I tested it again with the new Firefox Quantum 57.0.4 64 bit (still Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) and it still works. Other users are reporting that the cloud player is not working on later versions of Ubuntu with different browsers.\nAudible made available a cloud player allowing subscribers to listen to their audio-books library from a web browser.\nI tested it on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Firefox 42.0 and it worked nicely.\nIn order to open the cloud player, from the homepage, just go to your Library. There you will find the list of your books. Under the cover of each book you will find the Play button, just click on it.\nNote: as cloud player, you cannot use it when offline.

First, please reproduce this one more time, file a bug, and attach the complete logfile from where you got the above excerpt; syncdaemon shouldn't go loopy if a file disappears while it's being hashed. You can make the bug private if you don't want everybody seeing that file (or you can email me the logfile if you'd rather).\nThen, edit /etc/default/xdg/ubuntuone/syncdaemon.conf, find the bit that looks like\nignore.default = \\A#.*\\Z\n                 \\A.*~\\Z\n                 \\A.*\\.py[oc]\\Z\n                 \\A.*\\.sw[nopx]\\Z\n                 \\A.*\\.swpx\\Z\n                 \\A\\..*\\.tmp\\Z\n\nand add a (similarly indented) line with the pattern \\.xhb~\\.. That should make syncdaemon completely ignore the file. If that works (if it's not that pattern, it's one similar to it), file a second bug asking for this to be included in that setting by default. Please let me know the bug numbers of both.\n", "Q: How to permanently mount a remote share? I've got an NAS file server on my local network, in my windows days I just mapped a drive to it and it was just there all the time. I'm having trouble doing the same in Ubuntu. I had done this successfully before using samba-cifs in fstab, but after reconfiguring the box that no longer works and it felt silly since the box itself runs Linux (Busybox I believe).\nSo at first I tried sshfs.\nI can access it from the Places -> Connect to Server using ssh, and it'll pull up in Nautilus.\nI can also mount it via commandline: sshfs -o idmap=user $USER@<localip>:/mnt/HD_a2 /media/nas-files\nand it works fine; however, it asks for a password so I can't add that in rc.local to mount on login.\nI've tried editing fstab, unsuccessfully, using this command:\nsshfs#shazzner@<localip>:/mnt/HD_a2/files /media/nas-files/ fuse user 0 0\n\nfor some reason this turns the nas-files folder in a binary file, that appears to be garbage. When I unmount it, it comes back fine. No idea.\nSecond, someone in the chat mentioned, Autofs.\nI edited auto.master with:\n/media/auto /etc/auto.media\n\nand in auto.media:\nnfiles -fstype=fuse,rw,noperm,allow_other,reconnect sshfs\\#//<localip>/mnt/HD_a2/files\n\nthen restarted autofs, it gives me no error message but the mount isn't there.\nPulling my hair out with this one, any help?\n\nA: You can try to do a \nsudo su\nssh-copy-id username@nas\n\nto enable certificate based auto login for the user root.\nNow the user root should be able to login to the server viva ssh without a password and i think sshfs now also does not need a password.\nSo you have to write a little script executing sshfs and start the script on startup (checkout the update-rc.d command)\n", "Q: How do I install Enlightenment (E17)? Has anybody tried E17 on Ubuntu, as an alternative to Gnome/KDE? How does one install it?\n\nA: 9.10 only\nYou have to add the ppa ppa:e17-packaging/ppato your software sources (here's how to do that) and install e17 from the software center.\nThen:\n\n*\n\n*Logout of your X session\n\n*Change Session (bottom of GDM login screen\nafter you click on username)\n\n*Log back into enlightenment\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 12.04/12.10 you can install E17 in this way:\nppa:efl/trunk this is the official ppa.\nAdd PPA:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:efl/trunk\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install e17\n\nNow Install it:\nsudo aptitude install e17 libedje-bin libqedje0a libqzion0a\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out\n\n*Select E17 session\n\n*Enjoy\n\n\nA: The best way to install E17 is to install it from the official repositories. You can install it from the Software Center or using\nsudo apt-get install e17\n\nYou can then select it as your session in GDM (the login screen) using the dropdown menu in the bottom right hand corner, once you have selected your user.\n (image source)\nThe first time you run it it asks you to choose some preferences. Choose the option for the standard desktop or the netbook desktop if you are on a netbook.\nIt is quite interesting in a retro kind of way and will take a lot of getting used to if you are used to GNOME (or KDE) and I find it harder to use than GNOME and it doesn't look as nice. However it is certainly functional and seems quite suited to power users.\n\nNote Pingus has no window border because I pinned it to the desktop (an action which is apparently irreversible).\n\nA: Just do\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt-get install e17\n\nThen logout and login again using \"Enlightenment.\" :-)\n\nA: The other answers are all the easiest way to install Enlightenment on Ubuntu. They are not by any means the \"best\" way. The packages they suggest installing are over six months old and thus are buggy and not really worth installing.\nThe best way to install enlightenment is to compile it from source (instructions from 8.04 to 10.10 only).\nOr if you want a recent Ubuntu distro with E17 as the default desktop check out Bodhi Linux.\n\nA: I haven't tried using e17 on ubuntu 10.10 straight but I know there is an Ubuntu based distro called Bodhi Linux which uses the e17 stack instead of gnome. There is a forum regular called psychocat who has a how to webpage for Ubuntu. On the site there is a section called \"Playing Around\" where he gives terminal codes to completely remove one desktop before installing another desktop. The reasoning for this is even though you can have more than one wm/desktop solution things can get very mixed up. He doesn't have a particular gnome to e17 switch but the hard part is removing the original\nPsychocats Tips site\n\nA: i'd recommend compiling from source. either via easy_e17.sh or do everything yourself. DIY is not that hard. basically you need all the header files from apt and either the release files from here or checkout the latest SVN sources here.\n", "Q: How can I change the default application that archive manager uses? When I had installed the rar application the archive manager was using that one which had problems with non-english characters. I uninstalled it and the archive manager used p7zip. The question is how can I make the archive manage  (and extract here) to use the p7zip instead of rar but have both installed at the same time.\n\nA: You'll need to associate p7zip with .rar file types. To do so find a .rar file and Right Click that file and choose \"Open With Other Application...\"\n\nIn the \"Other Application\" menu select \"Use a custom command\" and enter /usr/bin/p7zip -d and check the \"Remember this application\" checkbox.\n\n\nA: Personally I found that the best archive manager which support non-English characters is PeaZip PeaZip web site. It has a support for RAR archives and is able to do many other operations. \nIn order to make this (or other) archive manager as a default choice: from file (archive) Properties menu select a Default application (for current file type).  \n", "Q: A few items are missing from my panel and I'm not sure how to get them back I'm missing both the Me Menu and the Log Out/Shutdown/Restart, etc applet from my panel and I can't find them in the 'Add to Panel' list. The screenshot below shows the current state of my panel. How can I get them both back?\n\n\nA: Right click your panel and then click Add to Panel \n\nScroll down and select Indicator Applet Session and then click Add.\n \nNow Me Menu and Log Out/Shutdown/Restart applet will be loaded.\n\n\nA: Try restarting the gnome panel by pressing Alt+F2 and then typing in the command,\ngnome-panel --replace\n\nIf that doesn't work try restarting the system. I get this sometimes but when I log off or restart the machine the applets come back. Though I might ask did you uninstall  gwibber recently, because sometime back when I uninstalled gwibber it also removed the me menu since the me menu is dependent on it. If that is the case, then try installing gwibber through the ubuntu software centre and restart the computer.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Check this:\nMe menu disappeared\n\nA: To add/restore at least Shutdown/Log out/Restart button:\non current panel: RightMouseButton 'Add to Panel', then 'Indicator Applet Session'.\n\nA: You could do the following (It happens sometimes):\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove from the panel enough things that you have an empty space to right click into. If you already have an empty space there is not need to remove anything.\n\n*Right click the panel and click on Add to Panel...\n\n*The Main menu is called MAIN MENU (Since i did not see it in the picture). The Logout is called Log Out...(Except if you are talking about the logout with other buttons in which case it is the Indicator Applet Session) Both are next to each other in the Add to Panel Window. Gwibber and actually any program that uses the Me Menu can not be removed since they have a relationship with the Me Menu. So if you remove them, the Me Menu goes too.\nIf for some reason you already did this and they still do not appear (Which also happens, you need to do one of 3 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the PC to see the changes.\n\n*Change the resolution so the panel gets longer and shows changes.\n\n*Create a new panel above or below (depending on your previous position) and start moving the addons to the other panel.\n\n*Press ALT+F2 and type gnome-panel --replace\n\n\nA: you can also type this command in the terminal, but it will restore the panel to stock, without the widgets you had added afterwards:\nrm -r ~/.gconf/apps/panel/\n", "Q: Deleting without permission in $HOME I experienced some weird stuff:\nberni@zero:~$ touch wiki\nberni@zero:~$ sudo chown root. wiki\nberni@zero:~$ sudo chmod 000 wiki \nberni@zero:~$ ls -l wiki \n---------- 1 root root 0 2010-12-11 15:14 wiki\n\nSummary: I created a file which nobody should be able to access in my HOME (~)\nMy user has default ubuntu permissions, no system tweaks etc.\nBut I'm able to delete the file without root permission!\nberni@zero:~$ ls -l wiki\n---------- 1 root root 0 2010-12-11 15:20 wiki\nberni@zero:~$ rm wiki\nrm: remove write-protected regular empty file `wiki'? y\nberni@zero:~$ ls -l wiki\nls: cannot access wiki: No such file or directory\nberni@zero:~$ \n\nThis does not work in /tmp or any other folder (!= HOME).\nDoes anyone knows why this is the case?\n\nA: Deleting files does not require any permissions on the file or directory you are going to delete, it requires that you have writing permissions in the parent directory and either is the owner of the file or the parent directory.\nFor example:\n/                   root   755\n/foo                user   755\n/foo/bar            root   644\n\nYou cannot delete the /foo directory here, even though you are the owner of it, because you do not have write permissions in the parent directory (/). You can delete /foo/bar, though, since you do have write permissions in the directoy /foo.\n", "Q: Install fails, cannot mount swap I am trying to fresh install a box to 10.04 (it was previously 9.10), but during the install process mounting the swap partition fails giving the error:\n\nThe attempt to mount a file system\n  with type swap in SCSI4 (0,0,0),\n  partition #5 (sda) at none failed.\nYou may resume partitioning from the\n  partitioning menu.\n\nI ran the short-smart tools on it which returned no errors on the disk, its a relatively new disk.\nSuggestions?\n\nA: You should select manual partitioning and create one huge partition format it as ext4 and mount it as /\nThen left about 2-3 GB of space for a swap partion (WHICH YOU DON'T CREATE YET)\n|-----------------------|\n|Root FS /     | free2GB|\n|-----------------------|\n\nThen proceed and ubuntu asks if you are sure not to create swap.

In htop, I kill Nautilus, and within one second, it's back, with a new PID!  \nThe restarted Nautilus shows in the Processes list, but has no GUI until I manually launch Nautilus...  I've heard mention of Nautilus works in lockstep with the desktop... maybe that is the reason(?).   \nIs there some sort of \"watchdog\" program keeping an eye on some distro-critical programs?  Monitoring Nautilus doesn't seem like a Linux kernel issue, so I just wonder what is happening here?  \n\nA: gnome-session is responsible for respawning nautilus. As its parent in the process tree, there is no other process that could respawn it.\nps -eaH shows you the hierarchical process tree excerpted here:\n    1 ?        00:00:00 init\n 1113 ?        00:00:00   gdm-binary\n11391 ?        00:00:00     gdm-simple-slav\n11396 tty8     00:00:13       Xorg\n11465 ?        00:00:00       gdm-session-wor\n11629 ?        00:00:00         gnome-session\n11746 ?        00:00:02           nautilus\n\n\nA: Chipaca & andrewsomething are both close...  :)\nThe /desktop/gnome/session/required_components_list key lists the \"components\" that should be monitored by gnome-session, and restarted automatically when they exit.  The default value for GNOME 2 is something like [windowmanager,panel,filemanager].\nIf you want to prevent nautilus (or whatever \"filemanager component\" you have configured) from getting (re)started by this mechanism, you can change the value to [windowmanager,panel].  (You can still have it start during login by adding it to the list of session start-up programs of course, but it won't get restarted automatically anymore.)\nWhat application (with what commandline parameters) gets started for each component is defined under /desktop/gnome/session/required_components in a key with the name of the component.  It is possible that more components are listed here than are used in the /desktop/gnome/session/required_components_list key.\nNow, in case of nautilus, by default when it is not running yet it starts in the background, and if the /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop key is set it also shows the Desktop.  It is also possible to tell nautilus to behave differently with commandline parameters.\n\nA: Gnome uses a Session Manager (gnome-session) to keep track of what it needs to do. It is responsible for bringing up the whole session, all subprocesses, restoring state and saving it when you log out.\n\nGNOME provides tools to allow your application to run smoothly from session to session. Users can log out with running applications and have those applications fully restored when they log back in.  – from the Gnome Documentation Library\n\nAmong other things, the session manager tries to keep it's instance of Nautilus running. Nautilus has to register with the session manager for that - which it does by default; naturally, there's a command-line option to disable it: \nnautilus --sm-disable\nYou can kill a running Nautilus process for good by running:\nkillall -9 nautilus\n\nA: Nautilus is being restarted because you have it drawing the desktop. Enter \ngconftool-2 --type bool --set /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop False\n\nin a terminal for it to stop doing that, and it then shouldn't come back after killing.\n\nA: As others have mentioned, gnome-session respawns the nautilus process automatically. It also does so for gnome-panel and gnome-wm (which in turn starts the window manager configured by the user, usually compiz or metacity).\nThis behavior is customizable through the desktop > gnome > session > required_components gconf keys.\n\nEditing these value can be useful if you would like to, for instance, run with out the GNOME Panel and only use Docky or AWN. \n\nA: in total do:\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/background/draw_background false\ngconftool-2 -s -t bool /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop false\n\nand\nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop\n\nchange to:\nX-GNOME-AutoRestart=false\n(found it at:\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=119254 )\nthats all...\n", "Q: Synchronising samba and unix user accounts Is there an easy way to have a samba user automatically created whenever a unix user is created?

I don't need to know which key on the keyboard was pressed, I just need to somehow know that it happened.\nAre there any global system hooks for pressed key on the keyboard?\n\nA: Here's a method that in theory should work.\nIf you visit the \"Accessibility\" tab in System>Preferences>Keyboard then you can enable the \"Slow Keys\" \"Only accept long keypresses\" option. Turn the delay all the way down and you basically null the effects of this option. Then go to \"Audio Feedback...\" and enable \"Beep when a key is pressed\" under the \"Slow Keys\" section.\n\nThis method SHOULD work. I couldn't get it to work, honestly. I do have the sound-theme-freedesktop sound theme installed and enabled. Perhaps it's a bug with gnome 2.32.0.\nThese configuration options simply play the system bell.

Is it possible to switch between Nvidia's BLOB and Nouveau video drivers on-the-fly?\nI think I need to be able to:\n\n\n*\n\n*[✓] Unload nvidia\n\n*[✓] Unload nouveau\n\n*[✕] Restore the console after unloading nouveau*\n\n*[✓] Swap xorg.conf files\n\n*[✓] Take care of blacklisting\n\n*[✓] Deal with libglx.so\n\n\n*) After a bit of talk with the guys at #nouveau, it seems to be difficult or even impossible with the current Ubuntu setup (builtin vesafb). I'm trying to get it to work with uvesafb, but for now the scripts in the answer do what I was looking for.\n\nA: I now have two scripts that switch drivers, xorg.conf, take care of blacklisting and the libglx, so the answer is: yes, it is possible.\nBlacklisting works with one file in /etc/modprobe.d/ containing either blacklist nvidia or blacklist nouveau. I also replaced /lib/nvidia-current/modprobe.conf with a dummy, else the nvidia driver would always create a link in /etc/modprobe.d/ that blacklists nouveau.\nSwitch to nouveau:\n #!/bin/bash\n stop gdm\n\n rmmod nvidia\n\n sed -i \"s/nouveau/nvidia/\" /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nvidia-nouveau.conf\n\n update-alternatives --set gl_conf /usr/lib/mesa/ld.so.conf\n ldconfig\n\n modprobe nouveau\n\n cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf{.nouveau,}\n\n start gdm\n\nAfter executing that, I have nouveau running and a working console (nouveaufb).\nSwitch to nvidia:\n#!/bin/bash\nstop gdm\n\necho 0 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind\nrmmod nouveau\nrmmod ttm\nrmmod drm_kms_helper\nrmmod drm\n\nsed -i \"s/nvidia/nouveau/\" /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nvidia-nouveau.conf\n\nupdate-alternatives --set gl_conf /usr/lib/nvidia-current/ld.so.conf\nldconfig\n\nmodprobe nvidia-current\n\ncp /etc/X11/xorg.conf{.nvidia,}\n\nstart gdm\n\n→ Nvidia driver is working, only problem: after unloading the nouveau driver, the console is unusable. I need a way to reset it or load another framebuffer, but since vesafb is compiled into the kernel I don't know what to do.\n\nA: I don't believe it's possible to do, not only is the nouvou driver kernel mode setting and the nvidia one not, but the nvidia driver uses a hacked xorg library which makes even using the same install on a machine requiring the intel driver a problem. (see upside down elements bugs and questions)\n\nA: http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/KernelModeSetting/ suggests running /etc/init.d/consolefont restart after rmmod-ing nouevau to restore the text mode. Note that it has been renamed to console-font on more recent systems and in Ubuntu 13.10 it can not be called this way at all, but like this: service console-font restart\nAlso, it does not work always.

Uninstall it using the package manager, and install from the repository. \nThe repository doesn't update versions between releases, but security patches are backported.  If you have multiple users, you may want to use the repository as all users get the extension.  Otherwise, each user (and profile) needs to download and install their own copy.\n\nA: Some bums didn't update the add-on URL correctly.\nGet them here manually:\nftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/addons/\n\nA: Disable ipv6.\n\n\n*\n\n*Type about:config in the addressbar, press Enter. \n\n*Find network.dns.disableIPv6 in the list.\n\n*Right-click -> Toggle. \n\n*Restart Firefox and try again.\n\n\nThat should fix your problem.\nBTW, to avoid confusion, keep in mind your updating an extension, not a plugin. Plugins in Ubuntu are usually installed and updated via repository. Some extensions can also be installed/updated via repository, but most commonly they are downloaded and updated via Mozilla Add-ons site and Firefox Add-ons Manager, which is what you are trying to do.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get a list of most recently installed packages?

I'd prefer a 100% on-line way.\n\nA: If you have the opportunity to travel to conferences, occasionally Linux Professional Institute will offer their most basic exam on site, for free.  It is a first step towards full certification. Since the Ubuntu certification is based on the LPI, it may be possible for you to take several exams spread out over time to decrease the impact on your finances. \n", "Q: Upgrading to 10.10 causes mountall error in Parallels I just recently upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10 using the update manager tool.\nAfter the upgrade, I was asked to reboot and it fails with\n\nAn error occurred while mounting /media/psf\n  Press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery\n\nSkipping gives me this:\n\nLogging in with the command line prompt doesn't bring me to the UI, but stays in terminal mode.

Your VM won't finish loading. And choosing \"Reinstall Parallels Tools\" will lead you to an empty pair of hands - i.e., it just won't work. You can't get to the actual VM because your Parallels tools are trying to load and crashing your loader's intentions. When Parallels drivers crash, your VM crashes.\nParallels forums advises that a \"future update\" will help 11.04 run. However, for many, the upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 on the Mac is a disaster. So, your old info is likely lost - unless you had the forethought to backup your /home folder and other stuff, like FireFox bookmarks, et al.\n\nA: I found a solution that worked for me. Try uninstalling parallels tools from your VM. To do this select the 'Virtual machine' menu item in parallels when your VM is running, select 'Reinstall Parallels Tools'. When the ISO mounts run the install script and select the remove option rather than update. Restart your VM and install any new update in Ubuntu if they exits.\nNow run the upgrade again and you are away. There should be no more installation issues, however the Parallels tools still do not support 11.04 yet so you will have to do without until Parallels get their act together!\n", "Q: In htop, I sometimes see lists of 64 processes, identical for all but the PID. What are they?

I thought the daily build on http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/ would be updated daily, but the current build is 6 days old. I would love to try out Natty and Compiz Unity on a live USB-drive, but it's not much use if it's not updated.\nAny reason why the build is so old? Does anybody know when it will be updated again?\n\nA: The developers are currently moving the default Python version from 2.6 to 2.7, which involves rebuilding (and sometimes changing) a lot of applications that are written in Python or depend on it (e.g. for plugins, scripting, etc.).  I am running Natty on 1 machine, and currently part of this migration is done, but not all of it.  The result is that the latest version of several packages (that are already converted) can not be installed together with the latest version of some other packages (that have not been converted yet).  That also means that building an ISO fails, hence no new \"daily\" CDs.\n(To be sure somebody from the team that is responsible for building the ISOs should confirm this, but I'm pretty sure this is the main reason.)\nThis may also happen in other cases where applications that are installed on de ISO depend on each other or on a common library, and have version mismatches.\n", "Q: Is Acrobat reader X coming to Ubuntu? Do we know when Adobe release X reader for Ubuntu? It has some good features!\n\nA: The short answer is MAYBE.

It features a very customizable UI, tab support, highlighting and comments.\n\nA: Here is a very nice and fast alternative to Acrobat Reader - FoxitReader for Linux FoxitSoftware PDF Reader web site. I am very glad that Foxit released a reader for Linux platform (I am using this software on Windows PCs and I am very satisfied of the performance). \n\nA: If you like to highlight, underline and make comments in pdf files, then there are no real alternatives to the windows version of Adobe reader or the windows version of Foxit Reader. Best is to use Foxit Reader under wine (the linux version of Foxit reader is only a reader without these functions). Also, the Evince developers do not have time to implement these features into Evince.\n\nA: Try djvu, it has several readers, it's very fast, there are several readers that are better to use than evince or foxitreader , and there's a pdf->djvu converter in the linux repositories (Idk what it's called in ubuntu but in my distribution the package is called pdf2djvu, just do sudo apt-cache search djvu).\nFrom the looks of it, acrobat reader X might end up like the linux version of flash; a buggy port after 5 years of waiting.\n\nA: Guess what, I also needed to install Adobe X, but in my case, in order to use the multimedia pdf files created by the LiveScribe software.\nFortunately, I downloaded Adobe Reader X for Windows XP SP2, gave the install file  autorization to execute and installed it using wine (I have Ubuntu 10.04).\nOne thing I had to do was to tell it to use the \"unproteceted\" mode ????\nAll is ok.

I have, like many, problems with suspending/hibernating in Ubuntu. When I resume from suspend the fans start, the HDD led glows steadily, but the screen is off. The only thing I do is hard reboot.\nNo solution have work for me so far. But I have found a workaround: downgrade from grub 2 to legacy grub. With legacy grub I can suspend just fine. My suspend/hibernate problems are somehow related to grub 2, but why? What is grubs role in the suspend process?

Maybe it is not relevant at all.\n\nA: Grub has no role in the suspend-to-RAM/resume-from-RAM-suspend process.\nGrub has a role to play in the resume-from-hibernation process: it loads the kernel, which then finds a system image in the swap partition and resumes it.\nIf grub2 breaks hibernation with a video-related problem, while grub1 doesn't, it could be something to do with mode setting.  Either GRUB2 itself is trying to change the video mode, or it's configured to pass some kernel command-line option for changing the video mode.\nIf hibernation doesn't work right out of the box, that's a bug in Ubuntu, and it would be a good idea to report it (using ubuntu-bug).\n\nA: You might try uncommenting the GRUB_TERMINAL=console line in /etc/default/grub and see if that fixes it.\n", "Q: Enable Networking in VMWare I just got myself an Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop CD.

This is meant more as a test of the module, but it does what it says on the tin.\nThis command:\npython -m pyftpdlib --directory=FTP --port=2121 --write\n\nwill serve, without root privileges, on port 2121 and grant write access to anonymous users. It will also use the directory FTP in the current working directory instead of your home. Type python ftpserver.py --help to get information about all the options. \n\n\n*\n\n*log into it at anonymous@localhost:2121/\n\nPlease note that this software is released under the terms of the MIT License, which means you can do basically what ever you please with it. Read the license text, it's only a few lines, and know your rights.\n\nNow, this script doesn't support username and password as part of it's stand-alone functionality (for security reasons I imagine).\nSo I've added that feature:\n\n\n*\n\n*download my modified version\nYou now have, in addition to all options I mentioned, the command line parameters\n--username=USERNAME and --password=PASSWORD:\npython ftpserver.py --port=2121 --username=ftpuser --password=3r2u389r2u333j\n\nAgain, use --help to see them all.\nThis should be as easy as it gets.\n\nI've also written a little gui for it:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Download it here (updated at rev. 6)\nI'm sorry it's 3999 lines long, but it will do everything the original does. And i wanted to keep it all in one file.\nWhen it's started without any parameters (i.e. make it executable and double click it, or create a launcher for it), it starts a little gui for you to configure your server. You can still import it as a python module or use the above command line fu.\nKnown issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've not bothered with anything other than port 2121. This should be simple, making the port configurable requires complex error handling which I don't want the user to bother with. 2121 should always work fine.\n\n*It won't warn you, like the command line does, about using an insecure configuration. I.e. not setting a password or something like that.\n\nEDIT: since the API of pyftpdlib and ftpserver.py changed (and the ubuntu pastebin links are gone); most of the above post doesn't work anymore. For the (2014) version of pyftpdlib, use this script (ftpserver-cli.py) to achieve the same as above:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# ftpserver-cli.py\nimport sys\nsys.path.append(\"/path/to/pyftpdlib-svn\") # enter your proper path here\nimport argparse\n\nfrom pyftpdlib.authorizers import DummyAuthorizer\nfrom pyftpdlib.handlers import FTPHandler\nfrom pyftpdlib.servers import FTPServer\n\ndef processCmdLineOptions():\n  global optparser\n  optparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"ftpserver-cli\",\n              formatter_class=argparse.RawDescriptionHelpFormatter)\n  optparser.add_argument('-u', '--username', action='store', type=str,\n      default=\"user\", help=\"username\")\n  optparser.add_argument('-p', '--password', action='store', type=str,\n      default=\"12345\", help=\"password\")\n  optparser.add_argument('-t', '--port', action='store', type=int,\n      default=\"21\", help=\"port\")\n  optparser.add_argument('-d', '--directory', action='store', type=str,\n      default=\"/home/stefano/Projekte/\", help=\"port\")\n  optargs = optparser.parse_args(sys.argv[1:]) #(sys.argv)\n  return optargs\n\n\noptargs = processCmdLineOptions()\n\nprint(\"Using: user: %s pass: %s port: %d dir: %s\" % (optargs.username, optargs.password, optargs.port, optargs.directory))\n\nauthorizer = DummyAuthorizer()\nauthorizer.add_user(optargs.username, optargs.password, optargs.directory, perm=\"elradfmw\")\n#authorizer.add_anonymous(\"/home/nobody\")\n\nhandler = FTPHandler\nhandler.authorizer = authorizer\n\nserver = FTPServer((\"127.0.0.1\", optargs.port), handler)\nserver.serve_forever()\n\ncall with:\n$ sudo python ftpserver-cli.py --directory=/tmp/srvtest\nUsing: user: user pass: 12345 port: 21 dir: /tmp/srvtest\n[I 14-03-02 21:40:57] >>> starting FTP server on 127.0.0.1:21, pid=19286 <<<\n...\n\n\nA: *\n\n*You can use  pure-ftpd \n\n*You can use scp if you have an ssh server.\n\nA: For those who copy files to and from routers you might want to try out this tool: tftpgui\nIt worked for me and is very easy to configure. It is also a Python script but does tftp instead of ftp. All you have to do is install python-tk and download the script\nThe only thing to be aware of is that Ubunutu defaults to Phython2 so the best way to start the script is:\nsudo python3 ./tftpgui.py\n\nYou can then configure it in the GUI. when you are done you press exit and that is it.\nBo\n", "Q: Random images appearing in my home directory... Where are they coming from? Here's an odd problem I've had for a while. Every so often, I find that I have several jpeg images sitting in my home directory that I didn't put there.

But I honestly don't have a clue what could be writing them. They don't bother me enough to go on a full-scale witch hunt but if anybody knows of something that writes images in the home directory like this, please let me know.\n\nA: No amount of investigation actually solved this but I did stop using Liferea and started using Lightread for reading my RSS feeds. The images stopped popping up.\n\nA: You can try running fatrace (see this answer) and when those images appear again, search for them in fatrace's log file. That hopefully will reveal the program that's acting up. :)\n\nA: I don't think this is possible at the moment. I had a look into inotify and back in 2008 a developer wanted to put the PID of the process that created the file event into the cookie information. This would have solved it as you could have created a python program to grab the name of the process with that PID... in fact I created just a script to test the idea.\nBut the patch was thrown out for security reasons and a second patch may or may not have been submitted which needs some kind of options flag which isn't in pyinofity anyway.\nSo then I looked at lsof, it's a one shot deal so it's likely to miss the perp most of the time, but you might get lucky with or with the additional -r 1 to repeat every 1 second.\nlsof +d ~/\n\nAt any rate this is a bit of a missing functionality in the workings of Linux and should probably be fixed.

The shares are mounted to /mnt/nas/music, /mnt/nas/photos, etc.\nWhen I browse /mnt/nas in Nautilus, no directories show up unless I go to the location bar and type in the directory name of the mounted share. Is this how autofs works, or should there be directories that always appear, and then when you try to access their contents, autofs will mount the remote share?\nThanks a bunch.\n\nA: Use the option --ghost in your auto.master. Look at google for an example file, I found this exmaple:\n# mount point   config file        options\n/-              /etc/auto.direct   --ghost\n\n/misc           /etc/auto.misc     --timeout=30 --ghost\n\n+auto.master\n\nFrom here: example (archived copy of original page)\n\nA: You might be using autofs to mount these directories. If you find the file /etc/auto.master, it means that you probably are. The way autofs works is that it mounts and displays directories only once you try to access them.\nAutofs provides flexibilities like pulling from multiple servers, but in your case, you could add static entries to /etc/fstab if you know where these shares are located. For example, if you have a share located at IP address 192.168.1.3 at the directory /content/music, and you want it to be mounted at /mnt/nas/music, you could add an entry like\n\n192.168.1.3:/content/music  /mnt/nas/music  nfs defaults    0   0\n\nDon't forget to remove the appropriate entry from your auto.master!\nTo mount the new structure without restarting, type:\n\n# service autofs restart\n# mount -a\n\n", "Q: how to backup/restore the host key in ssh server I have a ssh server, and some clients have login it via key login.

I would like to install Evince 2.32 in Lucid (10.04)\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any safe way to do it ? \n\n*Download the source and start install all the required dependences is this approach  dangerous for the stability of my system ? \n\n\nI googled for a solution of this problem and the only suggestion I found it was to add\nthe ppa:irie/evince. \nI guess this is a not so safe am I right ? \nIf so it is expected to work with Lucid ?\n\nA: Wow, I wrote a lot more than I was planning on. So here's the tl;dr version:\nIt would be simpler to upgrade the entire system to Maverick than backport Evince 2.32.x to Lucid.\nIs it safe?\nFirst we need to address the question of whether this is safe. In most instances, installing new versions of so-called \"leaf\" packages will not effect the stability of your system. A \"leaf\" package is a package that provides a standalone application that no other packages depend on. Evince, unfortunately for your purposes, is not entirely a simple \"leaf\" package.\nEvince 2.30.x also provides the libraries libevdocument2 and libevview2. While Evince 2.32.x provides libevdocument3 and libevview3. Notice the libraries' have different numbers. This shows that there has been a SONAME bump meaning that there have been incompatible changes to the ABIs of these libraries. Other programs that rely on libevdocument2 and libevview2 may not function with libevdocument3 and libevview3.\nFortunately, at least on my system, there are no other programs that rely on libevdocument2 and libevview2 besides Evince itself. So is it safe? Probably!\nIs ppa:irie/evince safe?\nAs with any other PPA, this question comes down to whether or not you trust the owner of the PPA, in this case irie. There are a few ways that I use to determine whether I trust a PPA like looking at the breadth of their contributions. Are they also a upstream developer? Are they an Ubuntu developer? Does their Launchpad page show on going activity?\nAs for this specific PPA, it seems to introduce change that are not yet upstream:\n\nThis PPA provides slightly enhanced\n  Evince document viewer that pan scroll\n  mode (like \"Hand tool\" in Adobe\n  Reader) is added. It's probably\n  suitable for touch panel based\n  computers. The code changes are based\n  on a patch written by Stephen Sugden.\n  (http://mail.gnome.org/archives/evince-list/2009-June/msg00027.html)\n\nBut more importantly, it doesn't seem to have packages for Lucid. So it will not help you anyways.\nBackporting it on your own\nSo since its safe, is it doable? It depends on just how much you want it. Unfortunately, it would take quite a bit of work to backport Evince 2.32.x to Lucid. Backporting a singe package isn't that much work, but looking at the source code I can see that it's not just Evince that needs backporting. It needs newer versions of libglib2.0-dev, libgtk2.0-dev, libpoppler-glib-dev, and libcairo2-dev that are not available in Lucid. Those are core GNOME libraries that are about the complete opposite of \"leaf\" packages. You would need to backport the entire chain of dependencies.\nIn short, doing so is very complicated , time consuming, and potentially dangerous.\n", "Q: Will the launcher use Intellihide by default? I've found Unity's new Intellihide mode extremely useful, and would like to know if it's planned to be set by default or, by the contrary, the panel will be shown unless you set it manually.\n\nA: The current plan is that it will be intelli-hide for large screens, fixed in place for netbooks, with an option to change it. That might well be changed to be intelli-hide for all devices by release, based on user testing as the implementation matures.\n\nA: The most likely result is that there will be an easy and obvious way to turn hiding of the launcher on and off. The starting state will be of little consequence due to this. If I had to guess, I would guess on by default.\n\nA: The User Interface Freeze is on March 2011, before then it can be changed several times so it is impossible to know what the team will decide at the end.\n", "Q: No sound after PulseAudio reinstall I encountered an audio bug and reported it on Launchpad. There I was asked to reinstall PulseAudio. \nThat sounded dangerous, so I tried it on a VirtualBox virtual machine I had lying around. (this VM had no sound problems at all). And indeed, after I did a naive sudo apt-get remove pulseaudio -> reboot -> sudo apt-get install pulseaudio, the VM has no sound any more. \nStrangely, everything looks OK. There is nothing muted (I unmuted every single playback chanel in alsamixer just in case). The driver for the sound card is recognized and loaded, aplay plays sound files without producing an error, and when I installed and opened PulseAudio Volume Meter, playing a sound resulted in the volume indicator changing with the sound. Only there is nothing coming out of the loudspeakers. This isn't a hardware problem either, because the sound in the host system is functioning. \nI tried to configure PulseAudio as described on this page of the Ubuntu wiki, but had no success. \nI am afraid to try the reinstall on my real system until I know how to do it without causing a problem. Did I miss a configuration step somewhere? Should I have reinstalled in some other way? \nBoth guest and host systems are Ubuntu 10.10 64 bit. \n\nA: Please amend your question to include the most current information from pactl stat in a Terminal and from the instructions at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/AlsaInfo.  As an aside, I've contacted Fabio (the person who asked you to reinstall pulse) with clarifications to his triaging process.  Thanks for your patience.\n\nA: Try to delete ~/.pulse/ in your home directory where there may rest some erroneous per-user settings. Don't worry it will immediately be rewritten with default settings when the PA daemon restarts.\nTo both, check if pulseaudio is running at all, and to start it manually if not type\npulseaudio\n\nin a terminal. You will get an error if pulseaudio is already there.\nFor your bug you may want to check if settings in your /etc/pulse/daemon.conf are o.k., especially look for the entry:\nflat-volumes = no\n\nIf this entry is set to yes (by default) PA will always try to output at maximum level. For detail see the PulseAudio Daemon manpage\n\nA: Go here : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=789578\nDo Part A only. That should fix the problem in no time.\n\nA: Thank you all for the ideas. \nIt must have been a problem in the communication between host and Virtual Box.

Containers might work, though, if there are any that are supported by standard Ubuntu kernels.\n\nA: First, I think this is an excellent suggestion, and definitely something that TestDrive could/should support!\nIn the meantime, you can grab a UEC image, untar it, and launch it in KVM:\nwget http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/natty/current/natty-server-uec-amd64.tar.gz\ntar zxvf *.tar.gz\nkvm -boot a -fda natty-server-uec-amd64-floppy -drive file=natty-server-uec-amd64.img,if=virtio -curses\n\nEnjoy!\n\nA: You can also use TestDrive to launch a UEc Server Image.

I'd like to upgrade my distribution (10.04 to 10.10) and since I have customized Ubuntu quite a bit, I was wondering what is likely to \"break\".\nIf that can help, here is a sample list of things that I have customized (although I'd like a general answer):\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnome panel\n\n*Keyboard shortcuts\n\n*SSHd config\n\n*Apache + config\n\n*Nautilus (added some plugins)\n\n*Compiz config\n\n*etc.\n\n\nA: A distribution upgrade will, in all probability, not change any of your configuration. \n\n\n*\n\n*In rare cases, it can overwrite configuration some files in /etc, but never in your home directory. Make sure to back up all configuration that isn't easily restorable. Of course, you should always back up everything. \n\n\n*\n\n*In case any configuration does break, don't restore your backed up configuration files. Use them as a guide to re-configure what ever software. \n\n\n*To rule out any incompatibilities, it's recommended that you try out the new version via a live CD. Even though it would be surprising.\nI agree with DKuntz2's recommendation to back up, however - I disagree with his recommendation to restore. Restoring old configuration will cause problems at some point. The upgrade process is very smart about preserving your data while upgrading programs. They, in turn, are very smart about handling old data. The will do the best they can with your customisations and changes. \nHere's how to proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up all your data, as you normally would.\n\n*Read the Release Notes. Especially check the Known Issues section for regressions.\n\n*Try out the new version with a live cd or live usb image.\n\n*Use the provided methods to upgrade, that is hit Alt+F2 and type do-release-upgrade, do not change your source.list file, this will result in partial upgrades, leaving old version of software on your system instead of upgrading them.\nOne important note though: If you have used anything like Automatix or EasyUbuntu, that is any repositories that are unsupported and not recommended, all they have done may very well break. Remove this software before upgrading, to be safe. (ref)\nPlease consult any of the sysadmins here on Apache, or just back it up completely. I'm pretty confident in sending you off to upgrade, very much assuming that your recovery plan won't be needed, but I can't be so confident about Apache. I've just never used it.\n\nA: I haven't done this upgrade as I'm sticking with 10.04 for now (and if Unity becomes the default in later versions, I will be leaving Ubuntu for good). However, based on the questions I've been seeing here and elsewhere and my experienced with dist-upgrades in the past:\n1) Keyboard shortcuts, sshd, apache and conffiles and /var/www, and Nautilus plugins are unlikely to be affected.\n2) Gnome panel and Compiz configs might get b0rked, and you may experience other video-related problems. All three of the machines I tested had display issues with 10.10.\nYou could experience issues with wireless drivers as well, but it's equally likely that things will suddenly start working given the state of wireless drivers these days :^)\n\nA: Copy your home folder (the whole thing, including the hidden files) to another drive/partition, than upgrade, than replace the newly created home folder with the copy. This will keep your files and settings intact. Now all you need to do is install your new applications (actually, you might want to install the applications first because I don't know if newly installed apps will replace the old settings folders).\nThis should keep most of your customizations in place, minus apache (I don't know where that's kept), and possibly sshd (same reason).\nThis is why lots of places suggest keeping your home folder on another partition, so you can easily update everything, but leave your home folder intact (just switch the location later).\n", "Q: Rhythmbox still plays songs after exit Is there anyway to get Rhythmbox to stop playing the current track when it closes without first pausing/stopping the song manually? \n\nA: Command-line Way\nTry this command on terminal to close rhythmbox immediately,\nsudo kill $(ps aux | awk '$11==\"rhythmbox\"{print $2}')\n\nIt's an one way of killing rhythmbox using it's process id(pid).\n\nA: This is intentionally the default behaviour: allowing you to minimise (\"close\") Rhythmbox and control it from the Sound menu.\nTo work around this you need to \"quit\" Rhythmbox by selecting File->Quit in the menu, or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Q.\n\nRelated Question: \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a plugin for Rhythmbox to exit on close?\n\nA: With some applications, typically media players, they run in the background unless you quit the application. Whenever it is open, use File > Quit or Ctrt+Q. They typically run in indicators on your panel. This is so that instead of closing when you want to clean your desktop, they keep playing.\n\nA: I know that Clementine and Audacious stop playing when you hit the \"x\" button. Maybe you should try those players instead.\n\nA: It seems that there is much disagreement and flip/flopping on how the close-window, (x) button, etc. does/should work in Rhythmbox.  In fact both behaviors have been reported as bugs on several occasions for various reasons.  This one claims close == hide, while this one claims close == quit.  Whatever the case, I think the functionality should be configurable so it's up to the user to change it.\nAfter reading around through bug reports, I think that's exactly how it's supposed to work.  If you read this comment in the above-mentioned bug, the poster claims the behavior can be turned on/off by enabling/disabling the Status Icon plugin:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*open Rhythmbox\n  \n*Edit > Plugins\n  \n*scroll to the end of the list and find the entry marked \"Status Icon\"\n  \n*deselect \"Status Icon\"\n  \n*close the window\n  \n\nI tried this on my system (Ubuntu v10.10, Rhythmbox v0.13.1) and it did not work.  Back wading through the bug reports it seems there was a patch applied to fix an indicator-application compatibly issue that broke the Status Icon plugin behavior.  I am no longer 100% sure what the current status is on all this, but I think the above procedure should work.\nIndeed, toggling this behavior in Banshee is a very similar process, which actually works.\n\nA: Go to the sound icon in the top bar and stop / pause from there (under volume control you have player control) , or close it while window visible from the file menu. \n\nA: This is still not fixed in Ubuntu 20.04, and there are several bug reports about it, among which the ones previously mentioned here, and also this one.\nThe simple way to stop it is\npkill rhythmbox\n\nOr you can restart it, and select \"Stop & Quit\" in the menu.\nAfter that, I definitely solved the problem with\nsudo apt purge rhythmbox\n\n:-)\n", "Q: Gnome Terminal tabs ugly and oversized Both gnome terminal and terminator (which I am using on my laptop these days) can be customised to look very pretty. By using full screen and keeping desktop clutter down to a minimum it's possible to get a good-sized area to work in, even on my little EeePC.\nHowever, there is one element that I don't seem to be able to control. Gnome's tabs are massively oversized and ugly at best. They don't fit into the theme at all which looks silly, but for me the biggest problem is the screen real estate that is wasted. On a small laptop screen in particular, it's a real problem.\nIs there a way to change these tabs? I realize it's possible to put them up the side of the window, but then they take up even more space!\nIf this isn't possible with theme-ing or gnome configuration, are there any terminal programs like terminator that can handle the tabs themselves? (Ideally in a more elegant fashion!)\n\n\nA: As pointed out by JanC, terminator uses the default gtk theme on your system. It is true that the problem can be solved by putting close_button_on_tab = False in your ~/.config/terminator/config \nAlso, you could change the gtk theme. Or, you could define a special gtk setting specially for terminator. To do that, add the following lines to your gtkrc file:\nstyle \"notebook\" = \"default\"\n{\n    xthickness = 0\n    ythickness = 0\n}\n\nwidget_class \"terminator*.GtkNotebook\"       style \"notebook\"\nclass \"terminator*.GtkNotebook\"              style \"notebook\"\n\nObserve that you are modifying the standard Gtk widget called \"GtkNotebook\". This is whats responsible for tabs. If you want this to work in every application (not just terminator) then use instead:\nwidget_class \"*GtkNotebook\"       style \"notebook\"\nclass \"*GtkNotebook\"              style \"notebook\"\n\nThis will then affect all applications. To change the color of the text in the tab, use:\nstyle \"notebook_maybelabel\" = \"default\"\n{ \n   fg[NORMAL]        = \"#0000AA\"\n   text[NORMAL]        = \"#0000AA\"\n}\n\nwidget_class \"terminator*.GtkNotebook*\"       style \"notebook_maybelabel\"\nclass \"terminator*.GtkNotebook*\"              style \"notebook_maybelabel\"\n\nI am not a Gtk expert, and this advice may contain errors.\n\nA: check out urxvt. One of the main reasons I moved to it was the great way it handles tabs.\nAdd this to your .Xdefaults\n URxvt.perl-ext-common:  default,tabbed,matcher\n\n\nA: It is possibe through GTK CSS config file. Create the ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css then you'll able to add some CSS selector and it's attributes. There are some good examples: Remove ugly fat bazel from gnome-terminal with multiple-tabs\n\nA: Try screen.\nCreate different \"tabs\" with Ctrl-a c and switch between them with Ctrl-a Ctrl-a (to toggle to the  window  displayed  previously) or directly with Ctrl-a <number of tab> (to switch to window number \"number of tab\").\nCtrl-a \" presents a list of all windows for selection.\nFor more information take a look at man screen.\n", "Q: How can I become the owner of a file that origins from another pc / user?

I created a shell script /usr/local/bin/suspend with the following content:\n#! /bin/sh\n\n# Take an optional delay parameter\nif [ \"$#\" -gt \"0\" ]; then\n  sleep \"$1\"\nfi\n\n# Put the system to sleep\ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.Hal\" \\\n    /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer \\\n    org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.SystemPowerManagement.Suspend \\\n    int32:0\n\nIf I chmod +x and run the script by invoking it directly (e.g., just typing suspend or /usr/local/bin/suspend on the command line), nothing happens and the shell hangs—it doesn't even respond to Ctrl-C; I have to switch to a new shell and kill the bash process (which has no apparent children). \nThe script works fine if I invoke it in any of the following ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using sh /usr/local/bin/suspend.\n\n*Using . /usr/local/bin/suspend.\n\n*Renaming it to suspend.sh and invoking /usr/local/bin/suspend.sh (or just suspend.sh, since it's in the PATH).\n\n\nThe last option is fine, but still I wonder: what exactly is wrong with not using the .sh extension?\n\nA: suspend is a bash builtin,\nsuspend: suspend [-f]\nSuspend shell execution.\n\nSuspend the execution of this shell until it receives a SIGCONT signal.\nUnless forced, login shells cannot be suspended.\n\nOptions:\n  -f    force the suspend, even if the shell is a login shell\n\nExit Status:\nReturns success unless job control is not enabled or an error occurs.\n\nand as builtins take precedence, just typing suspend would behave exactly as you describe: the shell blocks until you kill it (if you kill -CONT it, it resumes).\nThat you're seeing this same behavior by invoking it with the path is either an experimental error, or a bug in the shell. I'd suspect the former before the latter.\n\nA: If you want your command to supercede a builtin, you first have to disable the builtion:\nenable -n suspend\n\nYou can then run your command like a normal command.\nThen, you re-enable the builtin\nenable suspend\n\nI'm surprised the builtin is invoked when you call your command with the full path.\n\nA: To answer your question about the sh extension; it is actually the opposite, you should not be using it.\n\nDon't use extensions for your scripts. Scripts define new commands that you can run, and commands are generally not given extensions.

Which startup script executes when Ubuntu wakes up from hibernate? How to check if the daemon is running?\n\nA: You should drop the file in /etc/pm/sleep.d . All the scripts in this dir are executed when a power manage event happens. You can check the first parameter to know what event has invoked the script.\nThere is a nice example in this answer\n\nA: If you get a login screen when your computer wakes-up, a simple solution will be to add service bluetooth start to your ~/.profile because GNOME will execute commands in this file when you login. If you dont use GNOME or if you dont get a login screen then you can add a file to /etc/pm/sleep.d with followiing lines in it\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    thaw)\n        service bluetooth start        \n        ;;  \nesac\n\nthis will script will start bluetooth service i.e bluetoothd whenever your system comes back from sleep/hibernation\n", "Q: Undelete Ubuntu One files, deleted with reconnected PC I just reinstalled Ubuntu 10.10 with the same PC name as it was before. \nSo after reconnecting to Ubuntu One my files lost (I think because in my new system folder which has Ubuntu One synchronized files become empty after reinstall). How can i undelete these files?\n\nA: So, the reason why files became inaccessible was the removal of the UDF upon the connection of a new machine. The reason for that behavior has to be determined. The UDF was recovered on the server side and now I am awaiting the confirmation from Khoss.\nUpdate: Khoss confirmed that the files are now available.\n\nA: Ouch, that is certainly a big problem. At the moment there is not way to do so, but I know as a fact that you will get some help in #ubuntuone in freenode since they will nee your details etc... \n\nA: Did you copy the ~/.local/share/ubuntuone directory to your new Ubuntu 10.10 install from the old one? If you did that but didn't have all your files in your synced folders, then Ubuntu One would see the files as being deleted and would remove them from storage. \nThe best way to get help with deleted files is to contact Ubuntu One support directly, as we'll need to look up your account information: https://one.ubuntu.com/support/contact\n", "Q: How can I make Chromium open apt links with xdg-open?

I would like to disable the shutdown command for all users, even root, on an Ubuntu Server installation.\nThe reason I want to do this is to ensure that I don't get into the habit of shutting down the machine in this way, as I SSH into a lot of production machines at the same time as this one, and I don't want to accidentally shutdown one of the other machines by typing the command into the wrong window.\nThe server I want do disable shutdown on only runs inside VirtualBox on my Windows desktop, and I only use it for local testing so it is not a problem if I can't shut it down from the command line.\nI have already mitigated the problem a bit by ensuring I have a different password on the VirtualBox image, but obviously if I am within the sudo 'window' on one of the production machines, I could still accidentally shut it down.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I disable the shutdown command?\n\n*If I do disable the shutdown command, are there any consequences that I should be made aware of? Most specifically, will it disable support for ACPI shutdown that is the equivalent of pressing the power button on a physical machine? Could it affect other generic applications?\n\n\nFor information, I just use this VirtualBox image for trying out shell scripts, running Tomcat and Java, and that kind of thing.\n\nA: If you usually run the command as sudo shutdown, rather than sudo /sbin/shutdown, then you can just setup a global shell alias for \"shutdown\" to just echo a message to the terminal instead. The real executable will still be there for all other purposes.\n\nA: A much better approach to this problem is to install the molly-guard program on the boxes you don't want to shutdown, rather than trying to train yourself to never run shutdown.\n\nmolly-guard attempts to prevent you from accidentally shutting down or rebooting machines. It does this by injecting a couple of checks before the existing commands: halt, reboot, shutdown, and poweroff.\n\nThe typical configuration is that it asks you to type the hostname of the machine to confirm you are really on the right one.\nIt is possible to add new scripts to /etc/molly-guard/run.d (as documented on the manpage, script files must follow naming expected by run-parts.\nIf you really want to disable shutdown (and this is such a bizarre idea), just do\nchmod 0 /sbin/shutdown\n\nthen if you need to use it, chmod it back to 0755.\n\nA: To disable shutdown command just make the binary non executable i.e sudo chmod a-x /sbin/shutdown\nAlso i dont think that it will effect any other shutdown method because as the man entry for shutdown says\n\nshutdown sends a request to the init\n  daemon to bring the system down into\n  the appropriate runlevel\n\nso any other command/script can do this even after disabling shutdown command for example I can still shutdown my system using shutdown from GNOME menu. Also you can still reboot your computer from command line using reboot command\n\nA: The shutdown command is in /sbin/shutdown. You can disable it by doing this:\nsudo mv /sbin/shutdown /sbin/really-do-shutdown\n\nBut: This means that almost none of the usual methods of shutting down the system will work any longer. Shutting down out of gnome on my test machine for this answer causes it to just log you out and throw you back to GDM. \nIf you want to shut down your system afterwards, you have to do\nsudo init 0\n\n\"Disabling\" shutdown will affect every application that uses the command for anything. Since init 0 is not the recommended way of shutting down a system, all programs that have to shut down the system use shutdown for it, which won't work any more.\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications can also throw exceptions due to the missing file, or the file being not executable, potentially causing them to crash even though a shutdown isn't necessary. This is an edge-case that you can work around by moving some binary, ideally executable file (not a shell script - that won't work) in it's place. For example:\nsudo cp /bin/ps /sbin/shutdown\n\nThis is after you've moved the original out of the way safely.\nNow, all this is quite hacky, and I recommend against it, for the reasons outlined in João Pinto's comment. But I won't stop you from doing it. :-)\nDon't only make a back up of /sbin/shutdown, also, have a recovery plan in place in case it causes any trouble. Don't do this on a server that you can't get to, for example. And test your recovery plan beforehand, assuming that the system doesn't boot at all (it will boot of course - I've tested it - but please be on the safe side). \n\nA: I think it should be take a other solution, Servers should have a ssh policy\nto disable shutdown and init 0 over ssh, or there must be a special dialog displayed\non console like at Windows to enter the \"why\" and special \"shutdown password\". To this the powerbutton should be password protected on Server use.\nAt moment we use a \"physical key switch = 4Euros\" instead of a Push Button.\n\nA: I you want to disable shutdown command.\n\ncp /sbin/shutdown /sbin/shutdown-backup\nrm /sbin/shutdown\n\nthis is because if someone tries to forcefully want to use this command, then also he cant\nnow no one will be able to use shutdown command.\nit will display a message command not found install it.\n\nvim /etc/bash.bashrc\n\nAdd a line in last of bash.bashrc\n\nalias shutdown=\"echo 'You are not allowed to use this command' \"\n\nif you want it back(enabled). just copy it back\n\ncp /sbin/shutdown-backup /sbin/shutdown\n\n", "Q: .u1conflict suffix gets apended to files while using ubuntu one I'm using Ubuntu One to synchronize a directory which I use to create and compile latex files. But, always, when a new file is generated, the files, instead of having the file-type extension like file1.pdf, they gain an extra suffix like file1.pdf.u1conflict, file1.pdf.u1conflict.1 so on. And many such files are generated when I compile pdflatex documents. Ultimately it lead to an error, saying that a file is not found while compiling. And the actual reason is, that file has got a new extension, which is, .u1conflict.\n\nA: hmm... while I can see why this has happened, it shouldn't. Could you please enable debug, restart syncdaemon, wait for it to be idle, reproduce the issue, file a bug, and upload a tarball of ~/.cache/ubuntuone/log/? If you consider your filenames to be sensitive or private, mark the bug private before uploading.\n\nA: *.u1conflict files represent the case when you've modified a file on two computers and then tried to synchronise. In general, you'd either want to pick which version to keep, or try to merge the changes in the two versions. Usually you wouldn't want to upload the conflict to U1, but if you do you can rename the .u1conflict version.\n.u1partial files represent partially downloaded files. If you have one of these hanging around, it might indicate that the synchronisation daemon died while downloading the file. As before, you probably don't want one of these uploaded to your U1 share.\nAs far as other restrictions go, U1 stores filenames as unicode strings. So if you have filenames that are not valid UTF-8 it may have troubles. This shouldn't be much of a problem on Ubuntu systems since it uses UTF-8 locales.\nTaken from: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-client/+question/78943\nHope this helps.\n\nA: In your specific situation, it's a problem of saving before the first file has had a chance to sync. I've had this problem with my novel as well. The solution, is to disable u1 while working on the files, and enable it again when you are done saving the files.\n\nA: I had the same problem with latex and i solve it manually. I deleted the conflicted archive at u1's site, then, i generated my pdf without conflicts.\n\nA: I've had this problem from time to time.  Sometimes I can simply delete the conflicted file on the u1 website, and rename the local file without the .u1conflict extension and it will work.\nToday, however, I ran into this and I had to take a couple extra steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete conflicted file on one.ubuntu.com\n\n*On local machine, stop u1 client by running u1sdtool --quit and then ps -ef | grep ubuntuone-client to make sure it's stopped.\n\n*Move the conflicted client file to a folder that isn't managed by u1\n\n*Start the u1 client again by running u1sdtool --start .  If this step fails, you may have to stop the client (u1sdtool --quit) and try starting it again.\n\n*Connect the u1 client by running u1sdtool --connect\n\n*Run u1sdtool --status a few times and wait until is_online is True\n\n*Lastly, put the conflicted file back in the u1 managed folder on the local machine (minus the .u1conflict extension) and wait for it to sync.\n\n", "Q: System hangs on changing time My machine is always showing an hour ahead of the actual time. I am in Texas currently but the time never picks Day light savings. Any time I click on Set Time(Top Right Corner), my system just hangs right there.

(once a week is fine by my standards. i find that I only migrate away from Atomic Time a few microseconds a week.)\nHowever, with that said, give a try with \n ntpdate time.nist.gov\n\nand see if it corrects your time issue, without a freeze.  \nIf your system continues to freeze, see if you cant ssh in from another machine and have a look at /var/log/messages. On a Fedora system at one point i was 2 hours ahead of actual time, when i reset the date, it caused a panic because everything on the system was 2 hours ahead. Threw some ridiculous error about future time and locked up. I powered down the machine for a day and gave it another go in a recovery console without an issue. \nEdit 1: Another thought occured to me to try and change your TimeZone settings. See if that will reconfigure your clock.

I have a USB keyboard: would that break this functionality?   Or, should I ask elsewhere (superuser, perhaps) about how to get that BOIS setting working properly?\n\nA: From the man page: \"numlockx  is  a  program  to control the NumLock key inside X11 session scripts.\"  It's a very simple tool.  You invoke it from the commandline or a script\n$ numlockx on\n\nwill enable numlock and\n$ numlockx off\n\nwill disable it.\nI use it with xfce myself as an autostarted application.  Once you have installed the package, go to \"Settings->Session and Startup\" from the xfce menu.  Click on the \"Application Autostart\" tab, and then on the Add button.  Enter whatever you like in the Name and Description boxes and in the Command box, enter \"numlockx on\" (without the quotes).  Click OK and Close, and the next time you login, you'll have your numlock on.\n\nA: You will have to try searching in your BIOS, if you do not want to do that then you can try numlockx, it is available in the repositories.\n", "Q: Empathy Yahoo IM contact request spam I'm getting maybe 20 friend requests from Yahoo IM everytime I start empathy (or my Internet goes up). Is there any way I can deal with the contact spam that doesn't involve me individually clicking on all the contact requests and dismissing them one by one?\n\n\nA: The real problem here, from my perspective, is the fact that Empathy doesn't reject requests properly. I keep having the same requests pop up every time even after I reject them until I use pidgin or some other messenger to reject the request. The Empathy team needs to fix the reject request function properly.\n\nA: I've had this problem as well, and sadly, it's is really a problem with Yahoo's infrastructure, and not so much something wrong with empathy (in other words, you won't be able to stop empathy from thinking you have genuine friend requests).\nThe best I can suggest to you is to report a wishlist bug on empathy :(.\nYou could try pidgin but to my memory, that doesn't make it too much easier to dismiss the contact spam in one go, though it does handle it better than empathy.\nAs grim as it sounds, I'd also suggest moving away from yahoo for IM.\n\nA: If you have a copy of Windows, I'd recommend running Trillian and rejecting the people through there, or running a copy of the Yahoo IM client (ugh).  That's how I got rid of the requests in Empathy, but then again, I dual boot.

When my internet connection goes down (which happens rather frequently here) and Empathy disconnects it drops notifications for new messages. So if I haven't opened the conversation window, I will probably never notice a message someone has sent me that I didn't catch in time. Is there a way for Empathy to remind you of new messages even after disconnects?\n\nA: I assume this is rather a bug, meaning this is poor behaviour by empathy.

How can i determine if just the .private folder is encrypted or the whole home directory?\n\nA: This is a great question!  It actually comes up a lot, from a programmatic perspective.  Programs, processes, and applications like the Ubuntu installer, lightdm, and gdm actually need to know if $HOME is encrypted, or Private, and if they're set up properly.\nI've recently written a utility, ecryptfs-verify-private, that was be released in the eCryptfs release version 96.\n\nA: From the terminal type:\ncat /home/.ecryptfs/$USER/.ecryptfs/Private.mnt\n\nIf the file exists and contains your home directory path, your home directory is encrypted.\nAnother way to check is looking at your home dir mount point:\nFrom the terminal type:\ndf $HOME\n\nAn encrypted home will be mounted at  the \".Private\" filesystem, otherwise it will be mounted at some regular partition device (/dev/*) .\nFilesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/home/username/.Private\n                     315482376 101351268 198105472  34% /home/username\n\nRegular device mount (no encryption):\ndf /home/schroot\nFilesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda7            315482376 101351332 198105408  34% /home\n\n", "Q: How can I adjust the time that automatically reduces the brightness of screen?

The ability of a .desktop file to display a \"human-readable\" alias rather than its (perhaps) clinical real name, has merit... and as the .desktop filetype suggests, I assume that this ability is intended for the Desktop (which is (co-?)managed by Nautilus).  \nHowever in the Nautilus File Manager itself, where I would expect to see the bare-bones file information (eg. the real name), I am presented with the meta-data alias instead of the real filename.  \nThis makes it rather difficult to edit/view the .desktop file when Nautilus does not make the real name available.   \nIs there some way to have Nautilus GUI File Manager list these .desktop files by their real names?  (just like ls)  \nPS.. These files had me completely puzzled until today, when I renamed one, and the (my) new \"name\" was actually not the new real filename at all!. The displayed name was an alias; Nautilus had modified the file's contents (Name=...), and the original name was unchanged! ... now I am only half-puzzled (strange stuff)\n\nA: With newer versions of Nautilus (2.31.5 and later) renaming .desktop files actually changes the filename, not the Name field of the file itself.\nNautilus  will show the full filename (with the .desktop extension), if the .desktop file is not executable.  \nFor example,\nif Firefox.desktop is executable:\n\nNow to see the actual filename, make Firefox.desktop un-executable.

Nautilus will display the real file-name if the .desktop-file is located anywhere else.\nWe can do a simple trick with a symbolic link:\nsudo ln -s /usr /USR\nIf we browse in Nautilus to /usr/share/applications, Nautilus will display the aliases for the .desktop-files.\nIf we browse in Nautilus to /USR/share/applications, Nautilus will display the real file-names of the .desktop-files.\nTry it, I tested this on several Ubuntu-flavours with the versions 16.04 and 17.04.

My latex distribution is texlive 2009 on Ubuntu 10.10.\nEDIT: I did try running sudo texhash and it still doesn't work.\n\nA: Check if it will work if you have a copy of ochem.sty in the same location as your latex source file it is likely located in /usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/ochem, if this works then it is likely that you need to just run; sudo mktexlsr in your terminal for latex to re-examine all of your style files, \n\nA: You have to run sudo texhash to update LaTex database of local packages.

I see some answers where people post to set a key in the gconf-editor, however there is no entry for gconf-editor in my menu.\nHow do I run it and how do I use it to set keys that people recommend?\n\nA: What is Gconf?\nGConf is a system for storing application preferences. These preferences are stored in XML files under the user's home directory, ~/.gconf. Each preference is represented as a key-value pair.\nGConf is meant to be a way for developers to easily store user preferences and system administrators to set default values for particular preferences. In most cases, there is no need for a user to edit Gconf keys directly.\nThe vast majority of keys correspond to entries in the various applications' preference menus. Though on occasion, developers will use Gconf keys as a way to enable undocumented features. These are \"hidden\" from users for a number of reasons. Sometimes the feature is still a work in progress. Other times it is a feature that the developer wants to do away with but still leave accessible to users that don't want to give it up. Frequently, the features are targeted at \"power users,\" and the developer simply doesn't want to clutter up the normal preference dialog.\nIn some ways it is similar to Windows' Registry. One major difference is that, unlike the Windows' Registry, Gconf does not store system settings. It only stores application preferences. While editing Gconf keys may potentially cause minor issues with specific programs, it should never lead to system wide issues such as rendering your system unbootable. In fact, deleting the entire ~/.gconf directory will simply revert all programs using Gconf back to their defaults.\nManaging Gconf from the command-line.\nThe program gconftool-2 allows the user to interact with Gconf from the command-line. It is often simpler to enter a one line command in the terminal than digging around in Gconf's GUI tool. For instance, if you would like to show the icon for you trash on the desktop simply run:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/nautilus/desktop/trash_icon_visible --type=bool true\n\nThis also illustrates what I meant by key-value pair above. In this case, the key is /apps/nautilus/desktop/trash_icon_visible which has a value of true.\nYou can perform a variety of operations with gconftool-2. If you'd simply like to see a key's value, use --get:\ngconftool-2 --get /apps/nautilus/desktop/trash_icon_visible\n\nIf you'd simply like to reset a value to its default, use --unset:\ngconftool-2 --unset /apps/nautilus/desktop/trash_icon_visible\n\ngconftool-2 can be particularly useful for system administrators. For instance,  /etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory can be used to set mandatory preferences for all users. Further information on more advanced uses can be found with man gconftool-2 as well as in the GNOME Desktop System Administration Guide\nHow do I use the Gconf editor?\nWhat was your question again? Oh, that's right: How do I use the Gconf editor?\ngconf-editor is the graphical interface to manage Gconf settings. By default, it is not displayed in the menus. The easiest way to start it is by pressing Alt+F2 to bring up the \"Run Dialog.\" Next, enter gconf-editor.\ngconf-editor allows you to browse through the key-value pairs in a tree. Let's look at the example from above. Browse to apps > nautilus > desktop and you will see the trash_icon_visible key.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu docs on gconf-editor\n\n*GNOME docs on gconf-editor\n\n\nA: Alt+F2 → gconf-editor\nHave an explore around it, it's somewhat similar to using regedit in Windows, except I find it's a bit more user friendly, and it won't kill your cat if you look at it funny.\nRather than using that to set keys though, you can use a command line tool 'gconftool-2' to set/edit/remove keys.  I've found it pretty handy when setting URL associations for applications such as Spotify in Wine.\n", "Q: Audio CDs will not Auto-mount Correctly When I try to play any audio CD in Ubuntu 10.10 the following message appears.\n \nWhat is causing this problem with mounting an audio CD in the Ubuntu environment ?\nI need to resolve this issue because I am trying to rip a couple of CDs, and I would like to see how it goes in Ubuntu 10.10. \nThank you in advance for support :)\n\nA: I don't know if this applies to you, but I had problems with audio CDs being recognised by some programs using a USB optical drive.\nThe problem programs were using udev to detect the details of the disc, and it seems that the cdrom_id helper that udev uses was generating larger SCSI commands than the drive could handle.  Since the program didn't add the udev attributes marking the disc as an audio CD, some programs would ignore the disc.\nYou can test if this affects you by running \"/lib/udev/cdrom_id --debug /dev/cdrom\".  If your drive is affected, the output will be something like:\nmain: probing: '/dev/cdrom'\ncd_inquiry: INQUIRY: [CHIYOMI ][TSD80Y1 DVD RW  ][D010]\ninfo_scsi_cmd_err: GET CONFIGURATION failed\nID_CDROM=1\nID_CDROM_CD_R=1\nID_CDROM_CD_RW=1\nID_CDROM_DVD=1\nID_CDROM_DVD_R=1\nID_CDROM_MRW=1\nID_CDROM_MRW_W=1\nID_CDROM_MEDIA=1\n\nIf the program is functioning correctly, then there should be more debug messages at the start and a few extra attributes similar to the following:\nID_CDROM_MEDIA_CD=1\nID_CDROM_MEDIA_SESSION_COUNT=1\nID_CDROM_MEDIA_TRACK_COUNT=16\nID_CDROM_MEDIA_TRACK_COUNT_AUDIO=16\n\nIf this describes the problem you're seeing, you could try replacing the /lib/udev/cdrom_id program with the version from natty as a work around.\n\nA: I think my issue has been resolved after entire set of system updates (I am speaking of 10.10). Now Rhythmbox is playing Audio CDs, so mounting process is OK. I just can give a basic info on my system (iCore 3 (M350), Ubuntu 10.10, kernel 2.6.35-28-generic-pae, Gnome 2.32.0, Rhythmbox v. 0.13.1.)\nSo thank you for comments and suggestions.\n\nA: Original Author has commented with:\n\nI found that VLC is able to play Audio CDs. I found on Ubuntu forum that it is necessary to reinstall 'gvfs-backends'. So I did it. But I am not sure if this action has something with playing an Audio CD in VLC :)\n\n", "Q: Can't get Wireless RT2x00usb driver to work, and can't blacklist it After a two year hiatus to Linux, I try it again out again. And then I run into to driver issues...\nI have an old Linksys WUSB54G v4 Wireless USB Adapter. In previous versions I had to use a combination of Ndiswrapper and Wicd to hope of getting it working. In 10.10, apparently there are built in drivers for it. \nUnfortunately they don't work. Fails to connect to my WPA network, fails to connect to my open unencrypted network.

Applications like Brasero and Rhythmbox will not start while there is a disc in the drive. Removing the disc doesn't result in the list of media updating; it must be forced to update by clicking on one of the desktop icons and going through one of the above-described cycles.\nIt doesn't seem to matter what type of disc is in the drive. This has happened with CD-RWs I burned years ago using Roxio on Windows XP, the Ubuntu disc I installed from (burned with InfraRecorder Portable under Windows XP), and the retail game disc for Star Trek Armada II.\nThe first indication of a problem was Brasero dying when I tried to insert a disc for erasure and rewriting. Since then, I've drafted several different questions on various issues, finally combining them into this one when I realized that having a CD in the drive was the common link.\nCould this be a simple driver issue? If Ubuntu is dynamically detecting my hardware on boot, can I specify drivers for devices that I know will be a problem if the default files are used?\nI'm beginning to think that my laptop, an old Dell Inspiron 2650, is just too old or proprietary-driver-hungry (or something, maybe RAM-starved) for Ubuntu and Windows XP to play nicely alongside each other.

So far, I haven't been to get eth0 and the network configured to get the Blu-ray player talking to the internet.\nHere's my wlan0 configuration:\n ip4 addr: 192.168.0.100\n mask:     /24 (255.255.255.0)\n gateway:  192.168.0.4 (fedora box)\n\nThe Blu-ray player is set to an IP of 192.168.0.98/24, with the same gateway as above.\nI want eth0 set to an IP of 192.168.0.99/24, but when I do this using nm-connection-editor I lose internet access (the system tries to use eth0 as the default internet access interface).\nHow do I get my blu-ray player to talk to the internet through Bohica, and do so without disrupting my current (working) network?\nThanks.\nEdit: Here's the relevant output from nm-tool with the Blu-ray player connected:\n$ nm-tool\n\nNetworkManager Tool\n\nState: connected\n\n- Device: eth0\n  Type:              Wired\n  Driver:            forcedeth\n  State:             disconnected\n  Default:           no\n  HW Address:        90:FB:A6:2C:94:32\n\n  Capabilities:\n    Carrier Detect:  yes\n    Speed:           100 Mb/s\n\n  Wired Properties\n    Carrier:         on\n\n- Device: wlan0  [wlan0] \n  Type:              802.11 WiFi\n  Driver:            ndiswrapper\n  State:             connected\n  Default:           yes\n  HW Address:        00:26:5A:C0:D0:05\n\n  IPv4 Settings:\n    Address:         192.168.0.100\n    Prefix:          24 (255.255.255.0)\n    Gateway:         192.168.0.4\n\n\nA: Turns out all I needed was firestarter.  It quickly and easily did exactly what I needed, and nothing more.\n\nA: You will need to set up routing or bridging on your living room PC (but you already know this, because you have a working Fedora Server acting as a router).\nI think that you will need to bypass the gui and easy networking tools to get the network config that you want. I haven't seen the \"Share this interface\" (you know, like on Windows) setting in the gui or easy networking tools on my Ubuntu systems. I haven't looked real hard, so I may have missed the setting.\nFirst, plug the blu-ray device directly into your Fedora Server. Make sure it works in the simple case. This may involve borrowing a long network cable or a second TV, but you really need to reduce the number of variables.\nNext, decide on Bridging vs. Routing. Bridging would make the network configuration a bit easier, but in my experience, routing is easier to enable on the gateway host. Routing is usually a kernel option, and you would need to plan out a multi-subnet network. Bridging usually involves installing a package and then configuring it.\nNow, look up how to configure your choice (Bridging vs. Routing) on Ubuntu 10.10. I suspect this is where you will need to leave networkmanager behind. It seems clear that network manager is disabling your wlan0 when it has a \"better\" eth0 connection. I'm not sure how to make network manager stop that, but I suspect the steps for enabling routing and bridging will have you disable network manager.\nFinally, test your config. If the blu-ray player is lacking in diagnostic tools (like ping, traceroute, netstat -rn, ifconfig, access to the /etc/resolv.conf equivalant), you may need to borrow another computer (any friends with laptops?) to test.\nI know I haven't outlined a step by step, but I hope I provided some additional clues to help resolve the problem.\n", "Q: Why won't my linux computers recognize a restarted router without a reboot themselves? It seems every Linux machine I've ever worked on, when the router was restarted, the computer required a reboot too.  All the Windows machines rejoined the network just fine.

I'm not sure what PC hardware is relevant here, the motherboard?\n\nA: It will.\nIf it doesn't, it seems you have encountered a bug or an error in the driver.\n\n\n*\n\n*If this bug is in a proprietary wireless driver (see System → Administration → Additional Drivers), I'm afraid there's not a lot you can do about it apart from writing an email to the manufacturer.\n\n*If this bug is in an open source driver, you should report the bug so that it can be fixed. Usually, those bugs will be taken up-stream to the relevant developers, since Ubuntu doesn't provide the drivers themselves.\nIn the usual case, the network-manager will connect automatically to any wireless network within reach. It will roam you through different networks if you're moving around the house, it will detect which networks you've joined successfully and automatically connect you. \n\n\n*\n\n*Network Manager will always keep you connected to some network, if at all possible.\n\n\nIf, in your case, the Network Manager doesn't automatically connect to your network after the connection has been lost, please ask a question about it here. Make sure to provide us with all the details about your connection, your wireless hardware and the drivers you use. Also, provide all the steps to replicate the problem.\nNote: I talk about wireless networks, but this applies equally to Wired networks, 3G connections, Modem connections, even VPNs.

In this way I was able to burn them but they are not accessible from archive manager. Is this related to the size I chose to broke them ? \n03- Is there any other workaround or fix that I could use to make this backup on dvd's ?\nThanks.\n\nA: Not being accessible has to do with not all the parts being present...if you want to be able to pull files out of a single part, there are several approaches. note:you can get files out of archive parts with the rar command line utility.  archive manager just doesn't understand how to do it.  \nYou could do some shell script ninjitsu and wind up with archives of about that size that are not split which archive manager will understand.  Short of that, I don't know a way.\n\nA: Use an application like kiso to create an iso file of the data you want to backup. Then try burning that image onto the dvd.\n\nA: How to find all files with the most typical characters with problem risks?\n\n\n*\n\n*I prefer basic system tools instead of add-on utilities.   \n\n*Here is a solution which can be extended to typical risks for your language\n\n*(in this case: for German language)\nfind /a*/ -type f  -regextype posix-egrep -regex \"/a./.[ä-äö-öü-üß-ß\\ \\,\\;\\?].*\"  -print \nThis would look up all files in the file trees starting with a directory name: /a... \nYou would see all files listed which include a space character, \nor one of;   ä  ö  u  ß   ,  ;   ?  \nThen often bulk rename is required.\nThis could be done this way: \nRename files/bulk = (inside CURREN(!)directory) \n(-n =simulat.without rename)\n===    rename -v -n 's/^xb-/uxb-/'  xb*  ; ls -l ./   ;\nAbove: For start of file names. \nIs to adapt to the task, e.g. below for an inner character group of a file name, and now not similuation -n but really doing the rename: \n===    rename -v 's/have/had/'  *have*  ; ls -l ./   ;\nAll this could surely be improved.\nBut for normal needs it should do the job. \nI did not yet succeed to implement how trailing line feeds can be detected. \nThis fault might occur when saving files with the editor KATE. \nI had only a small case number of this error. So the debug message of K3b was sufficient to detect these files, 1 by 1 with repeating burn attempts. \nPerhaps somebody with better knowledge for this will add here how to detect in the way like above also trailing line feeds in file names? (Hence just by extending the regular expression in the command \"find ...\".) \n", "Q: How to pause/resume transfer of large files? I recently had to copy about 20 GB of data split between about 20 files from my laptop to an external hard drive. Since this operation takes quite a while (at ~560kb/s), I was wondering if there was any way to pause the transfer and resume it later (in case, I need to interrupt the transfer). As a side question, is there any performance difference between copying from the terminal vs copying from Nautilus?\n\nA: short answer, need no installation,\nto pause use kill -STOP PID\n\nto continue paused process use kill -CONT PID\nwhere PID is Process ID. you can get PID by running System monitor or top command\n\nA: I would recommened using rsync.\nExample:\nrsync -a --append source-file destination\nIf you want to see the progress, add the --progress option to the command.\n\n\nA: I can answer only the part about the difference between terminal and nautilus. I have checked several times this. It appears copying from terminal is faster than any graphical way like nautilus. At least in my case, when i copy about 32GB of info, it takes about 3 to 5 minutes less from terminal than nautilus from a 25 minute copy. that is about 10%-20% of the time. About a way to resume a copy to your external unit i think curl or rsync would resume a failed copy. At least with cp command. I have not tried this myself (I will try tomorrow) but this two might work.\nFor curl you need to aptitude install curl or apt-get instal curl since it does not come with ubuntu by default.\nUse curl --help or rsync --help to find out more. Tomorrow i will show how to copy with both if you could not find the way.\n\nA: I would also recommend rsync, but with the --partial option, this way it checks the already transferred data. You could even use it to repair a more or less fully transferred file which has a corruption somewhere in between.\nrsync -v --info=progress2 --partial source destination\n\n", "Q: How to show the transfer progress and speed when copying files with cp? Otherwise, is there any alternative command line utility that can achieve this?\n\nA: As many said, cp does not include this functionality.\nJust to throw my $0.02, what I usually do with trivial copying situations (i.e. no -R):\n\n\n*\n\n*See how big the file is and remember\n\n*Start copying\n\n*Open another terminal\n\n*Run watch ls -lh DIR on the directory where the target is\nThis can keep me updated on target file size, with quite a minimum hassle.\nAs an alternative for less trivial situations, e.g. recursively copying directories, you can use watch du -hs DIR to see summary of DIR size.  However du can take long to compute and can even slow down the copying, so you might want to use -n INTERVAL argument to watch so that trade-off is acceptable.\nUpdate: In case you use wild-cards with command used with watch du, e.g. watch du -hs backup/*, don't forget to quote:\nwatch \"du -hs backup/*\"\n\notherwise the wild-cards will be expanded only once, when watch is started so du will not look at new files / subdirectories.\n\nA: There are already some really great answers here, but here are my favorite commands, including my own little spin on the rsync command, with my favorite options:\n1. watch 'du -hs' (or, for more granularity: watch -n 1 'du -sk | awk '\\''{printf \"%.3f MiB %s\\n\", $1/1024, $2}'\\''') allows you to watch a destination folder grow in size if cp is already running:\nWhat if you already started a long cp process and don't want to stop it now?\nAssuming you already started this copy command:\n# recursively copy source_dir_name to destination\ncp -r source_dir_name destination\n\nJust open up a new terminal, with the copy operation already in progress, and run:\n# cd into destination directory\ncd path/to/destination/source_dir_name\n\n# Now watch, live, the size of this destination grow!\nwatch 'du -hs'\n\n# OR (Preferred!) see even more granularity, in X.xxx MiB: \nwatch 'du -sk | awk '\\''{printf \"%.3f MiB %s\\n\", $1/1024, $2}'\\''' \n\nThis will cause the watch command to automatically run du -hs (or du -sk | awk '{printf \"%.3f MiB %s\\n\", $1/1024, $2}') every 2 seconds (the default for watch) inside your destination directory, so you can see the size of the folder grow in real-time! This doesn't give you a percentage complete, but if you have a rough idea of the size of what you're copying, it certainly gives you something to watch and feel good about, knowing the destination is growing. Here's a sample output on the watch screen:\n\n*\n\n*Cmd: watch 'du -hs'\nOutput:\n\nEvery 2.0s: du -hs\n\n2.5G    .\n\n\n\n\n*Cmd: watch 'du -sk | awk '\\''{printf \"%.3f MiB %s\\n\", $1/1024, $2}'\\'''\nOutput:\n\nEvery 2.0s: du -sk | awk '{printf \"%.3f MiB %s\\n\", $1/1024, $2}'\n\n2560.348 MiB .\n\n\nAbove, you can see the current size of the current directory (.) is 2.5 GiB, or, more specifically in the 2nd case: 2560.348 MiB. To make watch use a slower update interval, such as 5 seconds, just add -n 5 to the watch command, like this:\nwatch -n 5 'du -hs'\n\n# OR (preferred, for more granularity)\nwatch -n 5 'du -sk | awk '\\''{printf \"%.3f MiB %s\\n\", $1/1024, $2}'\\'''\n\n2. rsync really is best for this:\nMy favorite commands:\n# dry-run\ntime rsync -rah --dry-run --info=progress2 --stats source destination\n\n# real copy (Important! Do a dry run first and read the\n# output summary to ensure you're copying what you intend!)\ntime rsync -rah --info=progress2 --stats source destination\n\nNote: the time part at the front of the above commands just outputs a nice time summary of the total run-time for the operation in the end. This works before any Linux command.\nHere's what an rsync --stats summary for a --dry-run looks like, by the way:\n\n$ rsync -rah --dry-run --info=progress2 --stats /media/gabriel/cdrom ~/temp\n          2.76G 100% 2570.10GB/s    0:00:00 (xfr#3836, to-chk=0/4837)   \n\nNumber of files: 4,837 (reg: 3,836, dir: 1,001)\nNumber of created files: 0\nNumber of deleted files: 0\nNumber of regular files transferred: 3,836\nTotal file size: 2.76G bytes\nTotal transferred file size: 2.76G bytes\nLiteral data: 0 bytes\nMatched data: 0 bytes\nFile list size: 0\nFile list generation time: 0.001 seconds\nFile list transfer time: 0.000 seconds\nTotal bytes sent: 123.88K\nTotal bytes received: 15.54K\n\nsent 123.88K bytes  received 15.54K bytes  278.85K bytes/sec\ntotal size is 2.76G  speedup is 19,792.78 (DRY RUN)\n\n\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*Place where I first documented the watch -n 5 'du -sk | awk '\\''{printf \"%.3f MiB %s\\n\", $1/1024, $2}'\\''' type command, in my ROS tutorial: my ROS.org tutorial: Reading messages from a bag file\nExtra reading:\n\n*\n\n*My long answer on some advanced rsync usage and stuff: https://superuser.com/questions/1271882/convert-ntfs-partition-to-ext4-how-to-copy-the-data/1464264#1464264\n\n*[another one of my answers] Unix & Linux: Is it possible to see cp speed and percent copied?\n\nA: There is a tool called progress in the repositories that is able to examine various different commands and display progress info for them.\nInstall it using the command\nsudo apt-get install progress\n\nThis tool can be used like that:\ncp bigfile newfile & progress -mp $!\n\nOutput:\n[11471] cp /media/Backup/Downloads/FILENAME.file \n        29.9% (24.2 MiB / 16 MiB)\n\n\nA: There isn't.

The -a will keep permissions,etc, and -h will be human readable.\nrsync -ah --progress source destination\n\nThe output will look something like this:\nPictures/1.jpg\n      2.13M 100%    2.28MB/s    0:00:00 (xfr#5898, to-chk=1/5905)\nPictures/2.jpg\n      1.68M 100%    1.76MB/s    0:00:00 (xfr#5899, to-chk=0/5905)\n\n\nA: Use a shell script:\n#!/bin/sh\ncp_p()\n{\n   strace -q -ewrite cp -- \"${1}\" \"${2}\" 2>&1 \\\n      | awk '{\n        count += $NF\n            if (count % 10 == 0) {\n               percent = count / total_size * 100\n               printf \"%3d%% [\", percent\n               for (i=0;i<=percent;i++)\n                  printf \"=\"\n               printf \">\"\n               for (i=percent;i<100;i++)\n                  printf \" \"\n               printf \"]\\r\"\n            }\n         }\n         END { print \"\" }' total_size=$(stat -c '%s' \"${1}\") count=0\n}\n\nThis will look like:\n% cp_p /home/echox/foo.dat /home/echox/bar.dat\n66% [===============================>                      ]\n\nSource\n\nA: Depending on what you want to do, Midnight Commander (mc) might be the answer. I'm surprised it's not been mentioned yet.\nTools like pv or rsync are good to display progress of transfer of one huge file, but when it comes to copying whole directories/trees, mc calculates the size and then displays the progress very nicely. Plus it's available out of the box on majority of systems.\n\nA: pv knows how to watch file descriptors given a pid, whether it's cp or something else\nFrom the documentation:\n   (Linux only): Watching file descriptor 3 opened by another process 1234:\n\n          pv -d 1234:3\n\n   (Linux only): Watching all file descriptors used by process 1234:\n\n          pv -d 1234\n\nExample:\nmd5sum file &\n[1] + 1271 suspended\npv -d 1271\n417MiB 0:00:17 [12,1MiB/s] [============>                                 ] 29% ETA 0:00:53\n\n$ cp file.mov copy.mov &\n[2] 3731\n$ pv -d 3731\n3:/media/windows/file.mov:  754MiB 0:00:04 [97,2MiB/s] [======================>                       ] 52% ETA 0:00:07\n4:/media/windows/copy.mov:  754MiB 0:00:04 [97,3MiB/s] [     <=>                                                                   ] \n\n\nA: While cp hasn't got this functionality, you can use pv to do this:\npv my_big_file > backup/my_big_file\n\nNote: this method will lose the file's permissions and ownership. Files copied this way will have the same permissions as if you'd created them yourself and will belong to you. \nIn this example, pv basically just outputs the file to stdout*, which you redirect to a file using the > operator. Simultaneously, it prints information about the progress to the terminal when you do that.\nThis is what it looks like:\nstefano@ubuntu:~/Data$ pv my_big_file > backup/my_big_file\n 138MB 0:00:01 [73.3MB/s] [=================================>] 100% \n\nYou may need to  Install pv (alternatively, type sudo apt-get install pv) on your system.\n\n*: The technical bit\nThere are three important streams of data in a unix-like system: stdout (standard output), stderr (standard error) and stdin (standard input). Every program has all three, so to speak. The > redirection operator redirects program output to a file. Without arguments, as you see above, > redirects a program's standard output to a file. cp basically does nothing fancier than\ncat source > destination\n\n(where cat just reads a file and prints it to stdout). pv is just like cat, but if you redirect it's output stream somewhere else, it will print progress information to stdout instead.\nTake a look at man pv to learn more about it.\n\nAnother option, as DoR suggests in this answer, is to use rsync instead:\n$ rsync -ah --progress source-file destination-file\nsending incremental file list\nsource-file\n        621.22M  57%  283.86MB/s    0:00:01\n\nThis will preserve the files permissions/ownership while showing progress.\n\nA: While it doesn't display speed, when copying multiple files, the -v option to the cp command will provide you with progress info. e.g.\ncp -rv old-directory new-directory\n\n\nA: The kernel knows most of the data such as speed, and often also percentage. Modern kernels expose this via their /proc filesystem.\nshowspeed from https://github.com/jnweiger/showspeed uses that info. It can attach to already running programs and give periodic updates like this:\n$ dd if=bigfile of=/tmp/otherbigfile &\n$ showspeed dd\ndd looks like a process name. pid=4417 matches av0=dd.\np/4417/fd/0r /home/jw/bigfile 113MB/s (12%, 2.3GB)  9m:35\np/4417/fd/1w /tmp/otherbigfile 182MB/s (2.6GB)\np/4417/fd/0r /home/jw/bigfile 285MB/s (15%, 3.0GB)  8m:08\np/4417/fd/0r /home/jw/bigfile 115MB/s (16%, 3.2GB)  8m:01\np/4417/fd/0r /home/jw/bigfile 107MB/s (17%, 3.4GB)  7m:39\np/4417/fd/1w /tmp/otherbigfile 104MB/s (3.5GB)\np/4417/fd/0r /home/jw/bigfile 139MB/s (19%, 3.7GB)  7m:37\np/4417/fd/0r /home/jw/bigfile 116MB/s (20%, 3.9GB)  7m:18\np/4417/fd/1w /tmp/otherbigfile  67MB/s (4.0GB)\np/4417/fd/1w /tmp/otherbigfile 100MB/s (4.1GB)\n...\n\n\nA: You can monitor your progress using watch\ncp -r /path/to/your/file/or/dir ./dst\n\nand in second terminal you can watch your progress\nwatch -n 0.1 du -h --max-depth=1\n\n\nA: While pv can deal with local cp tasks, using dd with pv can deal with both local (cp) and remote (scp) tasks.\ndd if=path/to/source.mkv | pv | dd of=path/to/dest.mkv\n\nPlease ensure the path/to/dest.mkv exits by touch path/to/dest.mkv\nThis can show the progress, but if you want the percentage information,\ndd if=path/to/source.mkv | pv -s 100M | dd of=path/to/dest.mkv\n\nReplace 100M above with the real size of your source file.\nHere Comes the Remote Part\nWhile scp can hardly show current progress, using dd with pv is a piece of cake.\nssh onemach@myotherhost dd if=path/to/source.mkv | pv -s 100M | dd of=path/to/dest.mkv\n\n\nA: If you have rsync 3.1 or higher (rsync --version), you can copy (cp -Rpn) while preserving permissions and ownership, recurse directories, \"no clobber,\" and display overall progress (instead of just progress by file), copy rate, and (very rough) estimated time remaining with:\nsudo rsync -a --info=progress2 --no-i-r /source /destination\n\nNote that sudo is only needed if dealing with directories/files you don't own. Also, without the --no-i-r, the percentage may reset to a lower number at some point during the copy.  Perhaps later versions of rsync will default to no-i-r with info=progress2, but it does not in the current version of 3.1.2.  \nI've found that the percentage and time remaining are grossly overestimated when copying to a directory that already contains files (ie. like when you would typically use cp -n \"no clobber\").\n\nA: If you want to see if your files are transferring correctly you could use gcp and gcp is like cp but by default gives you a progress bar so that you can see what is being copied. As the program's wiki notes, gcp has several useful features such as\n\n  \n*\n  \n*transfer progression indication\n  \n*continuous copying on error (skip to next file)\n  \n*copy status logging: gcp logs all its actions so that it is possible to know which files have been successfully copied\n  \n*name mangling to handle target filesystem limitations (for example deletion of incompatible characters \"*\" or \"?\" on FAT) \n  \n\nHowever, even when the progress bar has reached 100% when using the tool, you must wait until your terminal prompt reappears before safely removing your media so that you can ensure that the transfer process has successfully finished.\ngcp is used to copy files and has options such as --preserve so that various attributes and permissions can be preserved and --recursive so that whole directories can be copied. More information on its options can be found by entering man gcp or by going to the Ubuntu manpages online. A tutorial is also available on this site.\nInstall gcp from the repositories with\nsudo apt-get install gcp\n\n(Note: in Ubuntu 12.10 the new automount point is, for example, /media/user/usbdisk)\nYou can copy a file to your media by entering \ngcp /home/mike/file.mp4 /media/usb\n\nand copy a folder to your media with \ngcp -rv ~/Podcasts /media/Mik2\n\nSample output from gcp with the progress bar:\ngcp ~/Videos_incIplayer/mars.flv /media/Mik2\nCopying 168.57 MiB 100% |########################################################|   7.98 M/s Time: 00:00:22\n\nYou can of course specify multiple files or folders to copy to your disk, and there are a lot of other options covered in man gcp.\n\nA: I get a kick out of using cURL for this exact purpose.

To have estimated transfer time this can be acheived by doing do -s source in advance and passing it as a -s <size> parameter to pv.\n\nA: I use xcp to get a fancy progress bar:\nxcp -r myfolder /path/to/dest/folder\n\nIf you already have rust installed, install it with cargo install xcp.\n\nA: You can copy use any program.

Then I removed Apache2 and reinstalled it. Before doing this, I created a snapshot of the server (which runs in a vm), and copied the complete /etc/apache2 folder, just for convenience if I needed only one file and didn't want to put back the snapshot. \nWhen I removed apache, it still was running, strangely enough. Apt-get still said it was removed. \nPackage apache2 is not installed, so not removed\n\nSo I stopped apache manually, then tried to start it, which didn't work. When I tried to start apache I got an error:\nStarting web server: apache2Syntax error on line 14 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/test:\nInvalid command 'php_admin_value', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration\nhttpd (pid 28574) already running\n\nSo I reinstalled apache2 (apt-get install apache2), and upgraded (apt-get upgrade). The error remained when starting apache and it failed to start, so I thought I reinstalled PHP (apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5-cli php5-common php5-cgi). Then it started, and now it's running again. \n", "Q: Window preview is not working in DockbarX I have installed dockbarx using an article at omgubuntu. http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/12/new-look-dockbarx-hits-ppa/.

And if you put it in your .bashrc file it will become permanent.\n\nA: None of the answers here include the 256 color options in the latest versions of Ubuntu. I'm color deficient (some colors give me trouble near each other) so the default blue directory on black is real hard for me to read. What follows is my research to change that.\nType dircolors -p |less to see your current color code. \nThe default .bashrc should already be configured not only to take advantage of the system color code, but also one in ~/.dircolors so dump the dircolors output to .dircolor so you can start with that using this command.\ndircolors -p > ~/.dircolors\nAlternative: pick up a very similar 256 color dircolors from seebi's solarized project.\nGrab this colortest script and run it with the command colortest -w so you can see all the colors at once. Choose a color. I like the orange #208. I want that to be the text color so using this info on extended color codes, I can apply that.\nSo you have a color, now what. First we have to create the string.\nThe first number will be an attribute code, most likely 00, but if you want it to blink go with 05:\n\nPick an attribute code: 00=none 01=bold 04=underscore 05=blink 07=reverse 08=concealed\n\nNext pick append ;38;5; to that attribute code to indicate your text color to get 00;38;5; and then append your color. I picked 208 so I get 00;38;5;208.\nIf you want to also put a background on it, pick another color (let's say 56) with the colortest script and the append ;48;5; for the background and 56 for the color to get a total string of 00;38;5;208;48;5;56. \nSo now you have it, what do you do with it?\nvim ~/.dircolors and find the section you want to change (for me that is DIR) to the string we determined above \"00;38;5;208\". \nThis won't apply immediately, you'll need to load the config. Use dircolors ~/.dircolors to the get code to set your LS_COLORS variable. You could just paste that into your terminal session or you can close your terminal and reopen it. You could also pipe that into a file and run it as a shell script. \nYou can do this same procedure with 16 colors. You don't need the special ;38;5 or ;48;5 stuff. Just toss the numbers into the string and enjoy the simplicity.\nThanks to Dan and seebi for their notes and code on this.\n\nA: You can find out what colours ls uses by looking at the $LS_COLORS variable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turquoise: audio files1\n\n*Bright Red: Archives and compressed files2\n\n*Purple: images and videos3\nIn addition, files are colourised by attributes:\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*aac, au, flac, mid, midi, mka, mp3, mpc, ogg, ra, wav, axa, oga, spx, xspf.\n\n*tar, tgz, arj, taz, lzh, lzma, tlz, txz, zip, z, Z, dz, gz, lz, xz, bz2, bz, tbz, tbz2, tz, deb, rpm, jar, rar, ace, zoo, cpio, 7z, rz.\n\n*jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp, pbm, pgm, ppm, tga, xbm, xpm, tif, tiff, png, svg, svgz, mng, pcx, mov, mpg, mpeg, m2v, mkv, ogm, mp4, m4v, mp4v, vob, qt, nuv, wmv, asf, rm, rmvb, flc, avi, fli, flv, gl, dl, xcf, xwd, yuv, cgm, emf, axv, anx, ogv, ogx.\n\nAll this information is contained in the output of dircolors --print-database, but its formatting is rather unreadable. \nHere's a technical explanation of what's happening:\nExample:\nCHR 40;33;01\n\nThe colour code consists of three parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first part before the semicolon represents the text style.\n\n\n*\n\n*00=none, 01=bold, 04=underscore, 05=blink, 07=reverse, 08=concealed.\n\n\n*The second and third part are the colour and the background color:\n\n\n*\n\n*30=black, 31=red, 32=green, 33=yellow, 34=blue, 35=magenta, 36=cyan, 37=white.\n\n\n\nEach part can be omitted, assuming starting on the left. i.e. \"01\" means bold, \"01;31\" means bold and red. And you would get your terminal to print in colour by escaping the instruction with \\33[ and ending it with an m. 33, or 1B in hexadecimal, is the ASCII sign \"ESCAPE\" (a special character in the ASCII character set). Example:\n\"\\33[1;31mHello World\\33[m\"\n\nPrints \"Hello World\" in bright red.\nThe command ls with the argument --color=auto (on Ubuntu, ls is an alias for ls --color=auto) goes through all the file names and tries first to match different types, like Executable, Pipe and so on. It then tries to match regular expressions like *.wav and prints the resulting filename, enclosed in these colour-changing instructions for bash.\n", "Q: I updated to Ubuntu 11.04 and It broke my installation I tried to update to Natty Narwhal with update-manager -d and then I followed through everything and then when I restarted everything broke.

My explanation for why I did it this way may need some corrections from someone who knows more than me, so please edit or comment if you have time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create your partition in Gparted, and give it a label that you will easily recognize. Some of us have too many disks and partitions to remember by numbers.\n\n*Before using rsync to copy the files over, unmount your encrypted home using ecryptfs-umount-private. The reason I did this was because rsync seemed to copy the mounted/unencrypted stuff AND the .Private ecryptfs thingies.

I tried pdfcube but it did not really kept its promises.\n\nA: I think it might have helped to tell us what packages you've already tried, so we're not duplicating bad suggestions...\nBut perhaps you want either pdfcube or Impressive? (There was also another form of keyjnote called Accentuate, but the website for that seems to be down.

I am going to install Ubuntu on a brand new PC, which comes with some OEM installation of Windows 7. I know that Ubuntu can resize an existing Windows NTFS partition, so that it has free space to install. However, I am not sure how safe it is, and I'd like opinions, and tips'n'tricks on what I can do to avoid problems. The PC does not contain any data and I will have the recovery disk. \nMerci! \n\nA: If there's data you can't stand to lose (ie that couldn't be recovered by just reinstalling) it doesn't matter if you're repartitioning or not, back it all up to an external drive.\nResizing NTFS is a pretty tried and tested technology (it has been one of the main install vectors for people trying Linux in the past, and probably still is) so you should be fairly confident you won't rinse your drive when you do it. It's had a lot of attention and there are a lot of tools out there to simplify the process.\nThat said, none of them come with any warranty to work or against data loss. But, as I say, you can minimise any loss by just taking a backup.\nYou can use something like CloneZilla to make the initial backup to an external drive. I think it also supports network locations too so you have options available if you can't clone to an external USB disk.\n\nA: For some reason, I don't trust linux tools dealing with NTFS because of a lot of bad experiences. Windows comes with a good disk management tool for FAT/NTFS, and I'd say that's your best bet. I've done this for a lot of people I've initiated into Ubuntu, and it's never failed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Windows\n\n*Press start+r to open run\n\n*Open compmgmt.msc\n\n*Select Disk Management > Local (snap-in)\n\n*Right-click the bar representing your C: partition, and hit shrink volume\n\n*Wait a while as it queries available space [should be enough]\n\n*Tell it how much you want to shrink by\n\n*It should leave a black unallocated segment for you to do anything with.\n\n\nYou should now has as much free space as you asked for; do what you want with it =)\n\nA: Before starting repartitioning, I recommend to create a disk image from the whole disk. You can use Clonezilla for this. Simply burn the ISO to a CD, have an external HDD available.\nWhen running Clonezilla, choose device-image; local_dev; savedisk and continue. (screenshots)\nI've resized a few computers with Win7 on it, and only in one case Win7 refused to start up, displaying an error message. Using the recovery mode of Win7 to run Startup repair fixed this.\n\nA: If it were me I would resize the partition and create a new one from within windows7 I'm fairly sure that should anything go wrong you would still be \"Under Warranty\" as you are using the software that came with the PC. If you use Ubuntu and something goes wrong (not that it would) it could possibly break the warranty.\n\nA: Whatever you do (i.e. from Ubuntu or from Windows), make sure not to delete your recovery partition that most likely came with your machine.\n\nA: Ubuntu 9.04 totally destroyed my Win7 install (even the MBR was unreadable afterwards) once, but it was because my PC had a very weird configuration (it had a mixed PATA/SATA configuration, with apparently the boostrapper for Win7 and Win7 itself being on different drives). Apart from this one case, I installed Ubuntu (up to version 10.10) several times on different computers (desktop, notebook) hosting Win7, without a problem. The tool for resizing partitions included with Ubuntu seems rock solid to me.\nA Windows tool like PartitionMagic, on the other hand, failed me several times on very simple tasks, so even when I don't need to install anything, for any partition-related task I'd rather rely on a good ol' linux tool like gparted.\nConclusion: you will be fine, but save your data first (general IT motto). And your new PC came with legal Win7 key you can use with any Win7 image, in case you wonder. Just make sure you have that key and even an install failure will not cost your more than the time to reinstall.\n\nA: it is pretty safe to install Ubuntu next to Win7, I have done so a couple of times without hassle. Just a couple of pointers that will probably make me win the Capt. Obvious award:\n\n\n*\n\n*Depending on your machine, you might encounter some probs with your wifi (especially of you'll be installing Ubuntu on an \" older\"  machine. So, keep a cable at hand, you might need to download some new drivers.\n\n*Create a part of your harddisk to be FAT32 so you can use certain files (mp3, documents,etc.) both in Win7 and Ubuntu. \n\n*Be patient and enjoy the experience; if you have not fiddled with Ubuntu before you'll be in for a pleasant treat.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: Remove Keyring Popup on Startup \nPossible Duplicate:\nKeyring On Startup popup \n\nI forgot my password recently, so I had to use Ubuntu's recovery mode to change it to something else. I used this command: passwd username and I was then prompted for the new password. Then I rebooted and logged in. Everything went very smoothly, except that now everytime I log in  I see this pop-up 3 times before I can do anything else:\n\nI've tried entering my current password but that doesn't work. How can I get this annoying pop-up to stop showing up? I looked at this question however the checkbox to make this connection available to all users is disabled for me.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open your Home Folder(Places>>Home Folder ) \n\n*Press Ctrl+H to view hidden files. \n\n*Open .gnome2 folder and then keyrings folder and delete login.keyring file.  \n\n*Reboot the system.  \n\n*The pop-up will be disappeared now.\n\n\nA: The system asks you to \"Unlock your keyring\" because it wants to access some passwords that are stored on your computer. This could be, for example, the password to connect to your wireless network. See it as an extra protection: The system wants to make sure that you in person allow programs accessing passwords.\nOn the other hand, as you mention it is quite a paradox behavior. After all you selected that you do not want to enter a password on login. So the reasoning above makes only half sense.    \nIn fact, this wrong system behavior has already been identified by the developers. There is Bug #553646 on Ubuntu's bug tracking platform Launchpad which you can follow to see progress made. \nIf you sign up on Launchpad and select \"This bug affects me too\" you can contribute to raise attention for this bug :).\n\nA: You could just change the password on the keyring.  See this blog post for information on accomplishing just that.\n\nA: It is also important to set 'login' keyring as default. Right click on key ring and choose set as default. After that 'default keyring' can be removed. Of course this removes all passwords that were stored in keyring but for my it's good enough. \n", "Q: Upgrade vs Clean Install I've been trying for months to upgrade my Ubuntu 8.10 to 10.04 and have been told that I cannot because of my ATI Radeon Xpress M200 card.  I finally got tired of not being able to get things from the repository, so I did a clean install from a CD. I have a 64-bit laptop. The clean install went fine and 10.04 seems to have no problems with the ATI card.\nWhy was the upgrade telling me it couldn't do it? I thought I would have to scrap this laptop and get another. In fact, I did buy another one with 10.04 as a backup for when this one finally quit.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: There was a bug reported for that card model in lucid:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+source/linux/+bug/509273\nAccording to the bug report is is fixed now, probably the upgrade pre-validation data was not updated after the bug was fixed.\n\nA: If you do not have any particular software which requires a long post-installation tuning or setting up specific stuff (like remote licence server) it is always appropriate to perform a clean install (testing a live CD/DVD before). In this case you eliminate possible risk of update script's failures. \nI prefer clean installation because it is much easier to restore all necessary data and configuration files (for Firefox, Thunderbird, Skype etc. by copying hidden directories) than in Windows systems.\nRegards,\nVincenzo\n\nA: I have been using Ubuntu and other flavors of Linux for several years now, and I always found that an upgrade is not a good idea. I always had much better results with an actual new install. When doing that, I also take the time to make yet another GOOD backup, and review all the applications i currently have installed. Most of the time, I will end up with only 50% of the installed applications that are actually required, the rest, being useless pieces of code, that will usually slow my computer down, or cause glitches and problems. \nThe only time an upgrade is worth it is when the software manufacturer will require that the previous version be installed in order to install itself. This can be the case for Microsoft Windows, but Linux is not an issue. and Even applications that you may buy will usually not require a re-licensing under Linux. Windows is a different game, all together. \n", "Q: How can I play mp3 files or videos? I've just installed Ubuntu on my Lenovo g460  with Windows 7. I am not able to play any movie or mp3 file.

How can I split an existing partition (NTFS) to get space for a new partition and create a mountpoint for it?\n\nA: You need to boot from a live CD or USB and use gparted to partition your drive. It should be called something like Partition Manager in the System->Administration menu.\nRead through this tutorial for gparted  - it should tell you everything you need to be able to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink the partition\n\n*Create a new partition in the free space created by this action\n\n\nYou should take a note of the device path of the partition you create (eg. /dev/sda5). To mount this drive you can run this command:\nsudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sda5 /path/to/mountpoint\n\nReplace ext4 with the file system type, /dev/sda5 with the device path you noted down and /path/to/mountpoint with the file path you want it to be mounted to.\nTo permanently mount this partition, you need to edit /etc/fstab. Before you do, make a copy to back it up in case you mess it up somehow. To edit /etc/fstab, press Alt+F2 and enter gksudo gedit /etc/fstab. This will prompt you for your password and then open the file in the text editor.\nOnce opened, add this line to the end of the file:\n/dev/sda5       /home           ext4    defaults        0       2\n\nbut obviously you need to use your specific information instead. Once you have done this, save and close the file. The partition will now be mounted to the specified path every time you start up the computer.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install gparted \n\n*After installation you can find it under System>>Administration>>Gparted. \n\n\n*Right click and unmount your NTFS partition first.(In my case i have used /dev/sda6)\n\n*Select your NTFS partition and then right click on it and then choose Resize/Move.\n         \n\n*For example i have maximum size of 39998 MB.    \n\n*So now i am giving 30000 MB\n\n\n*Now goto Edit and choose Apply all Operations. \n\n\n*After few minutes the opration will get completed. \n\n\n*Now you will see unallocated space of 9.77 GB\n\n\n*Right click on the unalloacated space and select New to create new partition.\n\n*Now you are done.\n\n\nNote: \n\n\n*\n\n*To learn more about Gparted,you can have a look at this tutorial. \n\n", "Q: Stop printing test page everytime on HP PSC 1410 Everytime I switch on my desktop running and start the HP PSC 1410, it will print a test page.

Which partitioning algorithms use ubuntu during the installation, is it also available as a standalone application or command? Is it gparted?\n\nA: The ubuntu installer uses parted - for the most part; The parted program in turn uses fdisk to create and modify partition tables and mkfs to create file systems. \nGParted and its equivalents are merely front-ends to the linux partitioning tool kit. The Ubuntu installer is the same. It's a layer on top of parted and it executes it in the background, providing an easy to use abstraction of the plumbing behind it. The installer uses other programs, like resize2fs -to resize file systems - directly as well.\n", "Q: Fix for blinking Nvidia GTX 460m?

I use Ubuntu 10.10.\n\nA: I just solved this with my Dell XPS-15 and Dell bluetooth mouse by removing the batteries for a while and then reinserting them. \n\nA: My solution with Precision mouse : unpairing (removing) bluetooth device and pairing it again.\n\nA: I was using a Logitech M510 wireless bluetooth mouse and was experiencing this issue with Ubuntu 18.04. I noticed that xev was not detecting any events for the scroll. To solve my issue, I turned off the mouse and then turned it back on and it worked.\n\nA: \nHow can I configure what each button of the mouse does?\n\nYou can check if your hardware is defect by running xev. Open a Terminal via Applications → Accessories → Terminal and type xev. A small white window should appear. When you move your cursor in that window, the command line output will tell you what x.org things your mouse is doing:\n\nButton 4 in this example refers to scrolling up. If you don't get any output when scrolling, it may be your mouse is just broken.\nWhen testing this, please ignore the output that is generated by your mouse moving around.\nIf you know your mouse isn't broken, and xev still doesn't give you any indication of the scroll wheel - if for example the mouse works on another computer, you are experiening a bug. In this case, read the Ubuntu Wiki's article on how to report bugs and file it against X.org. Make sure to include all details in your bug report, plus how to reproduce the error. \nBe absolutely certain that your mouse works before filing a bug. \n\n\nHow can I configure what each button of the mouse does?\n\nYou can use btnx  to re-assign your mouse buttons. This will only work if they are detected properly.\n\nThe program will ask you to go through each of your buttons to configure them. Note: If xev doesn't recognise the scroll will, this program will not recognise it either. \n\nA: Old thread, but none of the above worked for me.\nThis is what did work. From: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1750708\n\nI managed to get the scroll wheel working on my PS/2 mouse. As far as\n  I know, this technique will only work on a PS/2 mouse. \nAs near as I can tell, Ubuntu detects some PS/2 mice as \"generic\"\n  mice; that is, as only having two buttons and that's it. \nI had to force the kernel to treat my mouse as a Microsoft\n  Intellimouse to get the scroll wheel working. To verify this, look at\n  /var/log/Xorg.0.log and see if there are some lines referencing a\n  \"PS/2 Generic Mouse\".\nCAUTION: The following commands change your GRUB configuration, and\n  could conceivably render Ubuntu or other OS's unbootable.\nOpen a terminal, and type:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nIn nano, look for a line that starts with:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\nFollowing this line will be some text in quotes. \nInsert \"psmouse.proto=imps\" into the line, so that the whole thing\n  looks something like:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"psmouse.proto=imps quiet nosplash\"\n\nThen hit CTRL-X to exit, then Y to save your changes.\nYou will then need to type:\nCode:\nsudo update-grub\n\nto update your boot menu. You should then be able to reboot and enjoy\n  a functional scroll wheel.

And with no files selected, it says something like \"24 items, Free space 15GB\" which at a quick glance looks like the total size of the files.\nI've looked through the preferences and don't see anything. I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 with Nautilus 2.32.0.\n\nA: Since there's no preference for this change, then unless there's a GConf key for this (which I doubt), you're out of luck unless you want to modify the Nautilus source code yourself and build your own custom Nautilus.\nThe general approach in Gnome is to ensure that there are as few settings as possible--all in the name of simplicity and usability.

There exist an estimated 200 viruses for Linux, a handful of which are supposed to work on contemporary distributions. But they are unlikely to be encountered in practice. Most of that malware are worms which are targetting servers only.\nAnyway, you will need a virus scanner anyway, if you use wine and thus download freeware windows software. Windows viruses may run under the windows emulater. Not all of them work, but some of them could cause harm and even damage/leak personal files.\nSecondly, if you interface with Windows users, for example at your workplace. You will need a virus scanner to check devices, because otherwise people might end up accusing you of spreading viruses (even though it are Windows viruses that couldn't possibly originate on your Linux computer). It's a bit like getting a flu shot to not endanger the community around you.\nTL;DR: use regardless of practical need\n\nA: There is no need for an antivirus/antiWhatever in Linux. About 99% of all announcements related to using an antivirus for linux are FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) coming from tipically private corporations (Cough...wont say the main one.. cough.. cough)\nBut anyway the ONLY way to have a antivirus in Linux would be if you are for example a MAIL SERVER. In which case you would need ClamAV for example so that it checks the mail for your customers. Of course, assuming you have windows customers in your Mail Server.\nSo to get to the point, you will only need an Antivirus if you are hosting some kind of service for Windows users.\nNOTE - The speed at which a solution is found for a vulnerability in linux is many times higher than the total work combine of Windows programmers. Specially if it is an open source project, in which you CAN see how to fix stuff quickly.\n\nA: No it's not really needed. There is ClamAV but, I think it is used only to protect other Windows machines.\n\nA: What I recommend instead of antivirus software is to make sure your machine is behind a firewall, or you have the firewall enabled in Ubuntu. If you are running a server make sure inbound access is only allowed on services you're providing.\nWhile Linux by design is much more secure than say, Windows, you're still vulnerable to exploits on any of the network services running on your machine. I've seen a few boxes exploited in my day, and some attacks can be pretty sophisticated and hide themselves very well (i.e. they recompile a version of ps that hides the trojan processes). In those situations, usually your best bet is to reformat and start from scratch.\n\nA: I have avast free edition for ubuntu on my system but it is basically for to scan my windows drive just in case it gets infected it would be easier to check for viruses from ubuntu , I have windows and ubuntu dual boot\n", "Q: Remote install of Ubuntu Server I have a machine located 500 miles away that's running Ubuntu 8.04.  I figure it's just about time that I upgrade to the latest LTS.  However, there's a software raid (md_raid) in there, and I'm afraid that just a dist-upgrade when I switch over the sources.list will end with catastrophic failure.  Like a panic on boot that the raid'd disk can't be read, or something else.\nFirst, hoping that's not the case, however, if it ends up happening I'm wondering if there's a means of having someone drop in a Ubuntu 10.04 server install disk, and flip on ssh, and some means for me to hop on and re-run the installer remotely.  Is this feasible?  If so, what would one need to do aside run apt-get install ssh on the target machine?  I do have friends who can be in front of the target machine to initiate the process, just not execute it out.\n\nA: Review the instructions on the upgrade.  I have had to uninstall programs before the upgrade.  I have done a number of installations over SSH without a problem.  If there is a problem, booting a CDROM installation to complete the installation is an option.  You may need someone to configure the IP address and start the ssh server for you.  \nUsually, you will be able to reconnect via ssh, although I would keep a second connection open in case you accidentally kill the first one.  The installation process is very good at not killing existing session when running the upgrade.\nYou may need to mount the partitons and chroot into them to complete the installation.  You may need to bind some devices from the live system into the directories to get the installation to complete.  If you do, the missing device is usually obvious from the error.  Just exit the chroot, do the bind, and begin again.  \nThis is the kind of situation where IP access to the console can be extremely useful.  An IP accessible KVM would be ideal.\n\nA: What you want to do in order to do an upgrade is \n\n# do-release-upgrade\n\nGoing by personal experience, this has broken my computer in some cases.\nIf that does happen, you can use the mini.iso image to start an install. It will be a fresh install, but you will need somebody on the other end to configure it for you. If you want this to happen automatically, check out the question on preseeding an ubuntu-server install\n\nA: If you want to accomplish this on multiple Ubuntu server instances set them all up with the same SSH key and then simply enumerate through the hosts in a shell scripts having them all execute 'do-release-upgrade'. \n\nA: The Ubuntu documentation explains the procedure well.\nThe most important thing is to install update-manager-core; this package finds every problem before updating.\n", "Q: What is taking up so much space on my disk, beside the filesystem? I have only one disk in my computer, a 80 GB SSD. It is formatted as a single ext4 partition (no swap), and all the usual folders are installed on it (I keep lots of data on external media, but /home and all the rest is on the SSD). \nToday I booted it and I got a message that the drive is full. I opened Disk Usage Analyzer to look at what takes up space. It insists that 67.8 GB of the disk are used, and that / is taking up 36.4 GB. Which leads to the question, where are the missing 30 GB, if not on the file system?!  \nJust to have a comparison, I added up all the sizes of all readable folders listed in Nautilus as subfolders of / (including the hidden ones). I got 20.9 GB. Trash was unreadable, but I know it has 16.2 GB, so the sum is 36.1 GB, around the same as what Disk Usage Analyzer is reporting. There were some system folders which were unreadable, like proc, but I doubt that they add up to 30 GB - else it wouldn't be possible to install Ubuntu on small disks, and I've seen it run on 2.5 GB. I think they must be the 0.3 GB difference between my calculation and the Disk Usage Analyzer's report. \nSo I'd like to know, what is eating up these 30 GB and how do I get it to free them? \n\nEdit with answers to CYREX's questions\n\n\n*\n\n*Booted from Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit live CD (same as my system).\nfsck result: \nroot@ubuntu:~# fsck /dev/sda1\nfsck from util-linux-ng 2.17.2\ne2fsck 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)\n/dev/sda1: clean, 265956/4890624 files, 18073343/19537408 blocks\n\n\n*Booted from the SSD. Emptied the trash, and the 16 GB from there are now free. The 30 GB are still missing. \n\n\n*I'm not experienced enough to know what counts as weird in a log. Here are my messages log and my syslog since last boot. Maybe you can find something in them: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://pastebin.com/FHrrV1rR\n\n*http://pastebin.com/FK8TmZbc\n\n\n*Here it got really strange. I plugged in an external 500 GB HDD. Disk Usage Analyzer overreported the available space, then showed space missing (76 GB used, but only 24 in folders). \n\nBooted again from the LiveCD, started the Disk Usage Analyzer from it and got the same results as from the installed Ubuntu, within 1-2 GB. \nEdit with answer to CodeMonk:\nThat would have been a nice solution, but the partition is really 80 GB - I mean 74 GB + marketing \"error\", anyway the whole disk is formatted. It also shows that over 50 GB are used, so where are the 30 GB if not in files and folders?\n\nGParted also reports the correct size of the external HDD. \n\n\nA: You can use the Disk Usage Analyzer to scan your directories and see where your space is going on the filesystem.\n\nAs for not being able to see 30GB of your disk, open up GParted and see how the space is allocated on the disk. It may be that your partition scheme isn't what you thought it was.\n\n\nA: You can use du to show this:\ncd /\nsudo du -hcsx -- .[!.]* * | sort -rh | head\n\nor\nsudo du -hcsx -- * | sort -rh | head\n\nThis will show what is using the most space.\n\nA: As default there are 10% of your disk space reserved for the root user. You can change that using sudo tune2fs -m %percentage %device. In your case that would be sudo tune2fs -m 1 /dev/cciss/c0d0p1 for reducing the reservation to 1%. You can set it to any other number you like but I would not recommend 0%.\n\nA: If you use Disk Analyzer as a normal user there can be some files that you can't access or see. You can try to start it with superuser privileges. Open a terminal, or press ALT+F2 and type:\ngksudo baobab\n\nBaobab is the geeky name of the Disk Analyzer if you are wondering. Maybe it can now show you where those missing megabytes are.\n\nA: I solved it - thanks to all your advice, especially that of Javier Riveira, who suggested running Disk Analyzer with sudo rights (I didn't know this can have influence on the results). \nI have Crashplan, and it is making backups to some of the external drives. So there is a backup set which goes to Milly, and another one which goes to Sto_Lat, once every 15 minutes (these are the names of the external drives). When I have at some point started the computer without these drives, Crashplan has found no folders under /media/Milly and /media/Sto_Lat, so it has just created them and has written backups to them. \nFor some reason, Disk Analyzer does not show these folders when started without sudo. Nautilus shows them, but lists the size of /media at 16 KB, when it is actually 30 GB. \nI only noticed this when I dismounted all external drives, including Milly and Sto_Lat, and started gksudo baobab. Then I saw my external drives where there should be none - but not all of them but only the backup targets - and realised that these are not mounted drives, but eponymous folders created by Crashplan. There must be something weird going on when I mount the drive at the same name as the existing folder, I wonder why I don't get an error message or something... \nBTW, this also solves why Disk Analyzer shows the sizes of Milly at 530 GB instead of 500 GB - these are the \"missing\" 30 GB, it counts the folder and the real drive together. \nNow I only need a way to delete the folders without breaking Crashplan or remaining without backups. \n\nA: Do the following at let me know how it went:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert a LiveCd and fsck your /dev/sda1\n\n*Clean your Trash Can.\n\n*See the Log File Viewer for weird stuff that is happening.\n\n*Test (If you can) with a normal HDD (Not SSD). Just to remove that option.\n\n\nLet me know how it went.\n\nA: I really don't know if this helps you, but in my case I also experienced that, my HDD was loosing free space over time without a reason. It turned out that the default settings in synaptic package manager was also a contributor to that. The default settings in the preferences, under the file tab will instruct synaptic to keep all downloaded packages in the cache. Over the time that can accumulate a nice mountain of files.\nI changed the settings to delete downloaded packages after installation. That helped to recover quite a nice amount of free space.\nAgain I'm really not sure if that helps in your case, but you might check the synaptic cache, maybe that's full with files that are obsolete.\n\nA: This answer is same as Javier Rivera's answer in this very question, but for Ubuntu 18.04+ as gksudo command is no longer available.\n\nIf you use Disk Analyzer as a normal user there can be some files that you can't access or see. You can try to start it with superuser privileges.\n\nTo run Disk Analyzer with superuser privileges:\nsudo -H baobab\n\n", "Q: Network load-balancing with Network Manager Can i use Network Manager to connect to multiple networks so they can share the load?\n\nA: Maybe you want Load Balancing.

I recommend scrobbler-helper, which is written in Perl and available via CPAN.\nsudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Audio::Scrobbler'\n\n\n*Configure pianobar to use external scrobbler.\nSkip the next two steps if you already have a ~/.config/pianobar/config.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the configuration directory for pianobar,\nmkdir -p ~/.config/pianobar\n\n\n*Copy the example config file,\ncp /usr/share/doc/pianobar/contrib/config-example ~/.config/pianobar/config\n\n\n*Now in ~/.config/pianobar/config, remove the # from the beginning of this line:\n#event_command = /home/user/.config/pianobar/eventcmd\n\nand replace user with your actual username. This sets the path of the script that will be run every time you finish playing a song.\n\n*~/.config/pianobar/eventcmd doesn't exist yet, so download this script to your Desktop. That script is the same as the one found in /usr/share/doc/pianobar/contrib/eventcmd.sh, but with some lines that required extra packages commented out. Once you have downloaded it, rename it to eventcmd then run the following commands:\ncp ~/Desktop/eventcmd ~/.config/pianobar/eventcmd\nchmod +x ~/.config/pianobar/eventcmd\n\n\n\n*Configure scrobbler-helper,\nscrobbler-helper needs to know your Last.fm account and password.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file ~/.scrobbler-helper.conf and paste the following into it:\n[global]\nusername=USERNAME\npassword=PASSWORD\n\nreplacing USERNAME and PASSWORD with your actual Last.fm username and password.\n\nA: Alternative solution: There is a Gtk application called Pithos that is built on libpiano (i.e., it uses the same backend as pianobar). You can set up last.fm scrobbling in the preferences.\nOf course, if you prefer a command-line player this doesn't help you very much. But if what you're really looking for is a non-flash, desktop-based Pandora player, this may be perfect for you.\n\nA: lastfmsubmitd is cool, because it will queue up scrobbles if the network is down.\nCopying and pasting the following into bash should get you up and running.\nsudo apt-get install pianobar lastfmsubmitd #install requirements\nsudo usermod -a G lastfm $USER              #use `lastfmsubmitd` setup group\nsudo /etc/init.d/lastfmsubmitd restart      #restart `lastfmsubmitd`\nmkdir ~/.config/pianobar                    #setup config environment\ncd ~/.config/pianobar\ncp /usr/share/doc/pianobar/contrib/eventcmd.sh .\ned eventcmd.sh <<\"EOF\"                      #Add `lastfmsubmitd` support\n10a\n        songfinish)\n                if [ -n \"$songDuration\" ] &&\n                   [ $(echo \"scale=4; ($songPlayed/$songDuration*100)>50\" | bc) -eq 1 ] &&\n                   [ \"$rating\" -ne 2 ]; then\n                        /usr/lib/lastfmsubmitd/lastfmsubmit --artist \"$artist\" --title \"$title\" --album \"$album\" --length \"$((songDuration/1000))\"\n                fi\n                ;;\n.\nwq\nEOF\necho \"event_command = $HOME/.config/pianobar/eventcmd.sh\" >> config\n\nThe eventcmd.sh part of the script is from Arnold French\nEDIT: You may have to chmod +x eventcmd.sh.\n", "Q: Arpwatch - no email Im fairly new to Ubuntu and I decided to try and get arpwatch up and running so I can monitor my network network.

When messages are accessed with POP \" choose option to delete the Gmail copy\n\nA: Well, technically you can't, from Evolution. You're using Pop3, which doesn't sync the mailboxes, it just downloads. If you were using IMAP, it would sync.\nAs the other two answers said, you can set that up in gmail, but than those messages are inaccessible in gmail (depending on your settings there).\nWhat I suggest you do is delete the pop3 account in Evolution and make a new account that uses IMAP, not really the answer you're looking for, but most likely a better solution in the long run.\n", "Q: Dual Boot.

Inspired by the recent issue with the Gawker network sites, I've been re-evaluating my password management. What strategies do you use to keep passwords safe? I'm particularly interested in software-based solutions available for Ubuntu, but any interesting ideas should be shared. Bonus points for solutions which are available on Android as well.\n\nA: There is one called Password Card, http://www.passwordcard.org/en it is not a software but is very secure... :) \n\nA: I use KeePassX, which is open source and free. There is an Android port, as well. I haven't spent too much time investigating alternatives, but this one does auto-type and it's in the standard Ubuntu repository. It's a desktop client, not a browser plug-in.\nI use Dropbox for backup/sync of the main passwords file.\n\nA: I'm presently a user of lastpass premium which is a browser plugin, and also works on all symbian/android/iOS/Major OS. \nTo quote their website:\n\nIts the last password you'll ever have to remember. It has form auto-fill, auto-login, its free, cross platform, its everywhere, its secure.\n\nGreat service so far with no issues.You can get your own account and more information by visiting lastpass.com\n\nA: If you can spare some time and effort you could use a plain text file encrypted with GnuPG stored with any of the many remote sync/backup services, or just on a server where you have SSH access (or even plain http). Such a combination is guaranteed to be cross-platform, free and last a long time. \nOn Android it can be accessed easily then decrypted with APG.\nIf you use Firefox, its Sync facility also works on Android, it's really neat.\nLastpass does look quite convenient and affordable, thanks for sharing that, lazyPower.\n\nA: re: LastPass...\"Its the last password you'll ever have to remember. It has form auto-fill, auto-login, its free, cross platform, its everywhere, its secure.\"\nPeriod.\nRe-install your OS, plugin LastPass, login to it and you have ALL your passwords.\nIt's the first thing I install after the OS.\n\nA: I currently use LastPass, but I was previously happy with Clipperz. Clipperz is less integrated, but still has some nice features. You can export Clipperz to an html file and open it locally so that you can use it offline. All the encryption/decrytpion is done on your machine, so passwords and data are never transmitted unencrypted.\nIt also supports one-time passphrases. Very handy, just don't forget your password like I did, since there are 0 password recovery options.\n", "Q: How can I have a Bluetooth Keyboard Auto-Connect at Startup? I have a bluetooth keyboard for my HTPC. I pair it with my computer via bluetooth, and it works fine. However, when I turn off the keyboard or my computer, it has to connect again  (which requires me entering a passcode on the computer and keyboard) when I turn them back on. I've looked through many forums and through that I have found that I'm missing some seemingly vital bluetooth files:\n/etc/default/bluetooth\n\n/etc/init.d/bluetooth\n\n/etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf\n\nIn the instructions that I've found online so far, I must change certain lines in any of these files. I am unable to, since they do not exist.\nAm I missing a dependency or something? I've also tried installing Blueman but that didn't help at all.\nI'm running Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick).\nOriginal post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1643386&highlight=bluetooth\n\nA: I also tried ryandlf's answer by myself but found another easy setup which will eventually do the same work.\nMain idea is that once the remote device is paired and trusted, hcitool spinq will initiate periodic inquiry which will let every available devices be connected.\nFirst, initiate sudo Bluetoothctl -a and follow steps below. These are from ArchLinux wiki but proven to work same in Ubuntu as well.\n[bluetooth]# power on\n[bluetooth]# agent KeyboardOnly\n[bluetooth]# pairable on\n[bluetooth]# scan on\n\nLast command will show all available (waiting for pairing) bluetooth keyboards like this.\nDiscovery started\n[CHG] Controller 01:02:03:04:05:06 Discovering: yes\n\nNote that address of your keyboard and continue with it.\n[bluetooth]# pair 01:02:03:04:05:06\n[bluetooth]# trust 01:02:03:04:05:06\n[bluetooth]# connect 01:02:03:04:05:06\n[bluetooth]# quit\n\nNow put this simple script into /etc/init.d/keyboard\n#! /bin/sh\nsudo hcitool spinq\nexit 0\n\nThen execute these.\nsudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/keyboard\nsudo service keyboard enable\nsudo update-rc.d keyboard defaults\nsudo service keyboard start\n\nThat's it.

It didn't work. After some analysis and trials, I found this combination:\nFirst, as guys suggested, try to connect the device manually from GUI. Make sure it works. Then disconnect it, and switch off. We will start over manually then.\nGet root privileges:\nsu\n\nThen:\nhcitool scan\n\nand simultaneously press buttons or whatever on device, and make sure it is discovered. If discovered, it should print an address of it, e.g. 20:73:00:01:90:65, and a description of device, e.g. Bluetooth keyboard. Grab that address to clipboard.\nNext, we are ready to connect. EVERYONE ALL OVER THE INTERNET SUGGEST HIDD, WHICH IS MISLEADING AS IT ISN'T PRESENT ANYMORE. That's why I couldn't make this work for so long... After looking at man of hcitool, I found plenty of useful commands, and no need to use dbus or whatever. So, to connect it, we issue:\nhcitool cc 20:73:00:01:90:65\n\nand that's it.\nExperiments showed that it even reconnects automatically, when I temporarily switched the device off.\nPART 2.\nI also created a service, as guys suggested in other answers. First, I created a file /etc/init.d/keyboard, with this content:\n#! /bin/sh\nsudo hcitool cc 20:73:00:01:90:65\nexit 0\n\nThen, as root:\nchmod +x /etc/init.d/keyboard\nservice keyboard enable\nupdate-rc.d keyboard defaults\nservice keyboard start\n\nThat's it. Hope it helps.\nOh, and it's Debian 9.\n\nA: This answer comes from a tutorial written by Andrew Martin on thetechdepo.com. See the link below for the original post, however this is a complete rewrite. It is written specifically for an apple keyboard, however I have used it for multiple devices so it is not apple, or keyboard specific. Simply follow the instructions and you will have any bluetooth device auto connect in Ubuntu.\nGo to System Settings > Bluetooth and follow the instructions to add your newly connected bluetooth device.\nFollow the instructions and enter the pin when requested, then after the device is connected and working, power off the device. Now onto the auto connect part.\nOpen your terminal and enter the following commands:  \n$ killall bluetooth-applet \n$ sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart \n$ sudo hcitool dev\n\nThe last command will display the output for your device such as:\nDevices:\n    hci0    00:00:00:00:00:00\n\nInstall a new package to allow you to connect bluetooth via the command line.\n$ sudo apt-get install bluez-compat\n\nOnce this has completed, you will now have hidd program installed. At this point, turn on your keyboard and enter the following command. It will output the MAC Address of your keyboard, which you will need to copy and paste into the subsequent command, as seen below:\n$ hcitool scan        \nScanning ...\n    AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF   Bluetooth Device Name\n$ sudo hidd --connect AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\n\nNow we have to create a startup file to auto connect the device when the pc starts. Via the terminal...\n$ gedit ~/.keyboard.sh\n\nEnter the following text, substituting AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF with the hardware ID you saw above. Finally, save the file.\n#! /bin/bash\n\naddress=\"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\"\n\nwhile (sleep 1)\ndo\nconnected=`sudo hidd --show` > /dev/null\nif [[ ! $connected =~ .*${address}.* ]] ; then\nsudo hidd --connect ${address} > /dev/null 2>&1\nfi\ndone\n\nNow create a new startup file. Substitute \"keyboard\" for whatever device name you choose. This is simply the name of the file.\n$ sudo gedit /etc/init.d/keyboard\n\nPaste the following, which tells your Ubuntu to run the file you just created at startup.\n#!/bin/sh\n/home/username/.keyboard.sh &\n\nexit 0\n\nNow set both files permissions to executable via the terminal.\n$ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/keyboard\n$ chmod +x ~/.keyboard.sh\n$ sudo update-rc.d keyboard defaults\n\nRestart your computer and your device should auto connect and be working without you having to do anything.\nI hope this helps a few people, it took me a long time to find a solution to my problem and I wanted to cement this tutorial a little deeper into the web.\nThe original link can be found here.\n\nA: I had a very similar issue with an Apple BlueTooth keyboard. I bought it because I loved the feeling of the keys. However, I could not keep it connected. The problem seemed to be in the keyboard identification. Once it was matched to an actual MAC computer, where it got an actual name, I no more had any issue with connecting it to Linux or Windows. My wife now uses it with no problem. \nI don't know how this can be transposed in your situation, but this can be a starting point. From other friends, it seems that the device identification is the main issue here. \n", "Q: How to have Debian packaging generate two packages given an upstream source archive? I am packaging something for my PPA. The upstream source is a .tar.gz archive which is Makefile-based.\nSince this package has a significant amount of architecture-independent data, it would be wise to have the build scripts generate two packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*package\n\n*package-data\n\n\nHow can I set this up? I've edited my Debian control file to generate two packages, but I have no idea how to get the right files to the right package.\nSince the data files are currently all installed via the Makefile, I am kind of lost here.\n\nA: This is a place where I've always found the documentation lacking. I pretty much only learned how this works by looking at how it is done in other packages. As with most things in Debian packaging, there are a few ways to do this. I find the simplest way is to use debian/package.install files. Here's an example of a package I've worked on, imagination (bzr branch).\nFirst, we need to create the package in debian/control. There are three stanzas now. One for the source package and one for each binary package. Note that the foo-data package should be Architecture: all. Also note that imagination Depends on imagination-common (= ${source:Version}).\nNext, we create a debian/imagination.install file. This contains the specific files or paths which we want to end up in the imagination package. For this package we want all the architecture dependent files. The desktop file is included as it needs to say with the binary that it calls in its Exec: line.\nusr/bin/\nusr/lib/\n/usr/share/applications/imagination.desktop\n\nWe need to create a debian/imagination-common.install file. This will contain all of the architecture independent files, images, translations, docs, and the like.\n/usr/share/doc/\n/usr/share/icons/\n/usr/share/imagination/\n/usr/share/locale/\n\nman dh_install describes what's actually going on here:\n\nmaybe you have a large package that\n  builds multiple binary packages. You\n  can use the upstream Makefile to\n  install it all into debian/tmp, and\n  then use dh_install to copy\n  directories and files from there into\n  the proper package build directories.\n\nWhat it means by \"the proper package build directories\" is that by the end of the build process, everything that will be in the resulting foo.deb will be found in src/debian/foo. The files that will end up in foo-data.deb will be found in src/debian/foo-data. As debian/rules is essentially just a Makefile, you can begin to imagine so other ways of getting the same result.\n", "Q: Customization in Panel When I minimize folders and mozilla, it is not visible in the panel.

I never get to the kernel image selection screen.\n\nA: Here is the bug report. You might try the solution offered by comment 90\nAll you need to do is download the file attached to the comment and replace your current C:\\wubildr with it.\nAlso, of note from post 91:\n\nPlease make sure that when you boot the line \"insmod ntfs\" is commented out or disable it by pressing \"e\" at the grub boot menu and edit the entry before proceeding.\n\n\nA: Is grub looking at the correct partition on the hard drive? you might want to use an installation cd and get it to repair the installation, maybe some of the updates edited the partition location in grub. Usually, windows likes to be 0,0. Try 0,1.\n", "Q: Unable to right click It appears I cannot right click on the menus to change their appearance etc, nothing happens. I am completely new to Linux so might be doing something wrong. Installed Utweakgi, but it tells me system or administrator cannot use the software and might not load. \nCan someone help me with this one, don't know where else to look. \n\nA: It's Difficult to tell what exactly it is you want to change but. If you want to change the menus in ubuntu there are three places that will be of use.\n\n\n*\n\n*Administration > Appearance this is where you can change your theme, wallpaper and effects you can also change icons and other settings by clicking on the modify button while choosing a theme. This will create a new modified theme so you can always go back to the default.\n\n*Administartion > Main Menu here you can change what programs are shown and not shown. and you can also change the position of icons in the menu. Or create your own menu\n\n*And right clicking on the top of a menu the part on the panel/bar will give you the option of removing the menu (remember to check the name of the menu first which will be in the \"about\" section of the right click menu.\nHope these give give you a basic understanding of how to modify the interface to your own liking there are millions of options, tweeks and mods for ubuntu but its best to start small and know how to get back something before you hit that delete key.\nHappy trails  \n", "Q: Installing multiple versions of sun java I have a need to maintain different versions of a certain product written in java, and uses sun's jdk to build.

I don't want openjdk, icedtea or whatever else, but different versions of sun's jdk itself.\nI ask this as I've seen I have the commands python, python2.6 accessible.

Maybe this is also the case for your software? Then you could use the software center or synaptic for a safe installation. Further reading on how to install software can be found in the Community Wiki.\n\nA: A .tgz file is just a compressed file, like a .zip. It can contain anything, so the installation method could be very different from one program to another:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quite often they are just source code, awaiting to be compiled, it's usually quite complex, much more than what karthick87 suggested.\n\n*Other times it contains some kind of installer that you should run like windows, like firefox downloaded from mozilla site.\n\n*Sometimes you are expected decompress it to a folder and just run the program from there, this is quite usual with java programs.\n\n\nThere is no a simple rule that will cover all the possibilities. But one thing is always true, programs installed outside the Software Centre are liabilities.\n\nA: *\n\n*.tgz is an archive like zip or rar.\n\n*Right click on the file and select Extract Here.\n\n*cd to the extracted folder.\n\n*Then type ./configure \n\n*To install type make and then make install.\n\n*There will be a Read me file with instruction on how to install the file.\n\n*However the installation will differ based on the different packages.   \n\n*So before installing the .tgz files i would strongly advice you to look at the read me file.\n\n*But installing software not in the software centre can be tricky and will not always work without some advanced knowledge.\n\n", "Q: How do I create a permanent Bash alias? I would like to create an alias to rm command in order to have a confirmation message after executing this command. So I am creating an alias like this alias rm='rm -i'. But as far as I know this is a temporary alias and it lives until you close the terminal.\nAs it is explained here to save alias permanently I need to execute ~/.bash_aliases or ~/.bashrc commands in terminal and add my alias there. But when I execute ~/.bashrc I get following error message :\nbash: /home/bakhtiyor/.bashrc: Permission denied\n\nWhen I run ~/.bash_aliases I get another error message like this:\nbash: /home/bakhtiyor/.bash_aliases: File or directory doesn't exist.\n\nWhat is the actual problem and how can I solve it?\n\nA: I wrote this helpful function to quickly create a new alias, and then write the alias definition to ~/.bash_aliases (if it exists) or ~/.bashrc.\nTIP: Ensure ~/.bash_aliases exists & is executed in ~/.bashrc.\n# -----------------------------------\n#  Create a new permanent bash alias\n#\n#  @param $1 - name\n#  @param $2 - definition\n# -----------------------------------\nnew-alias () { \n  if [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n    echo \"alias name:\" && read NAME\n  else\n    NAME=$1\n  fi\n\n  if alias $NAME 2 > /dev/null > /dev/null; then\n    echo \"alias $NAME already exists - continue [y/n]?\" && read YN\n    case $YN in\n      [Yy]* ) echo \"okay, let's proceed.\";;\n      [Nn]* ) return;;\n      * ) echo \"invalid response.\" && return;;\n    esac\n  fi\n\n  if [ -z \"$2\" ]; then\n    echo \"alias definition:\" && read DEFINTION\n  else\n    DEFINTION=\"$2\"\n  fi\n\n  if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then\n    echo \"alias $NAME=\\\"$DEFINTION\\\"\" >> ~/.bash_aliases\n  else\n    echo \"alias $NAME=\\\"$DEFINTION\\\"\" >> ~/.bashrc\n  fi\n\n  alias $NAME=\"$DEFINTION\"\n}\n\n\nA: To create an alias permanently add the alias to your .bashrc file\ngedit ~/.bashrc\n\nAnd then add your alias at the bottom.\n\nNow execute . ~/.bashrc in your terminal (there should be a space between the . and ~/.bashrc.\nNow you can check your alias.\n\n\nA: if you are using ruby, you can install aka using rubygem. \ngem install aka2\nusage\naka generate hello=\"echo helloworld\" #add an alias\naka g hello=\"echo helloworld\"  #add alias for lazy people\n\naka destroy hello #remove alias\naka d hello #remove alias for lazy people\n\nthe rubygem will auto-source your dot file so that you don't need to. Check it out. \n\nA: I'd love to expand on this idea!\nYou want to alias a command according to your question:\necho \"alias wolfr='cd /home/wolf'\">>./~bashrc\n\nNow you can type wolfr to move to wolf's home directory.\nThis is very similar and very cool, the export command:\necho \"export ngse=/etc/nginx/sites-enabled\"./~bashrc\n\nNow you can type cp $ngse/my_file /destination_directory/destination_filename to copy a file from the sites-enabled directory to a destination.\nNone of this will work until you do something like this:\nexec bash\n\nAlternatively, you can re-log or you can reboot.\n\nA: There are a lot of ways to create an alias. The most used ways are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add aliases directly in your ~/.bashrc file\nFor example: append these line to ~/.bashrc file\nalias ll='ls -l'\nalias rm='rm -i'\n\nNext time (after you have logged out/in, or done . ~/.bashrc)  when you type rm the rm -i command will be executed.\n\n*The second method lets you make a separate aliases file, so you won't have to put them in .bashrc, but to a file of your choice. First, edit your ~/.bashrc file and add the following lines if they don't already exist, or uncomment them if they do:\nif [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then\n. ~/.bash_aliases\nfi\n\nSave it and close the file. After that, all you have to do is create a ~/.bash_aliases file and add your aliases there, with the same format specified in the first method.\nContents of my ~/.bash_aliases file:\nalias cs='cd;ls'\n\n\nA: It sounds to me like your only problem is simply trying to execute .bashrc when it is not executable.  But this isn't the correct way to do it; whenever you make a change to this file, you should \"execute\" it by the command:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nOtherwise, it will simply create a new shell, execute the file in the new shell's environment, then discard that environment when it exits, thereby losing your change.  By sourcing the script, it executes within the current shell, so it will remain in effect.\nI'm assuming the second error was because bash_aliases does not exist.  It is not required, just recommended to keep your changes separate and organized.  It is only used if it exists, and you can see the test for it in .bashrc:\nif [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then\n. ~/.bash_aliases\nfi\n\nThis says that if the file ~/.bash_aliases exists, then run it.\n\nA: The problem is that you are trying to execute a non executable file:\nYou can check this with:\nls -la ~/.bashrc\n-rw-r--r-- 1 username username 3596 2010-08-05 17:17 /home/pt001424/.bashrc\n\nNote there is no \"x - executable\" letter on the first column (file permissions).\nProfile files are not executable files, instead of executing them you load them with:\nsource /home/bakhtiyor/.bashrc\n\nor\n. /home/bakhtiyor/.bashrc\n\n\nA: echo \"alias vps='ssh -X user@example.com'\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\nThis is an example I was looking for, a way to type a few letters at the terminal (\"vps\") to remotely log in to a server and enable X11 forwarding so I can run gui apps like \"gedit\" over the network.\nWhatever the command / aliased command, this way with the echo statement, quotation marks, and the symbol for appending the output of a command to a file (>>) works for me.  Just replace my command for the alias command you need and enter it into your terminal.\n\nA: I would suggest using /etc/bash.bashrc\nYou can add line at the end of that file.\nalias ok=\"ping google.com\"\n\nAfter putting the aliases per line you have to reboot or relogin.\n\nA: As I recall, bashrc has, or had, a line suggesting to not use it for aliases directly.  The solution is to use an external file(s).  The foo and bar aliases have been added, but to add baz the bashrc file must be \"sourced\" (or, just open a new terminal).  Example as:\nthufir@dur:~$ \nthufir@dur:~$ alias\nalias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\" \"$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'')\"'\nalias bar='echo foo'\nalias egrep='egrep --color=auto'\nalias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'\nalias foo='echo foo'\nalias grep='grep --color=auto'\nalias l='ls -CF'\nalias la='ls -A'\nalias ll='ls -alF'\nalias ls='ls --color=auto'\nthufir@dur:~$ \nthufir@dur:~$ cat .bash_aliases \nalias foo='echo foo'\nalias bar='echo foo'\nalias baz='echo baz'\n\nthufir@dur:~$ \nthufir@dur:~$ source .bashrc \nthufir@dur:~$ \nthufir@dur:~$ alias\nalias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i \"$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)\" \"$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\\''s/^\\s*[0-9]\\+\\s*//;s/[;&|]\\s*alert$//'\\'')\"'\nalias bar='echo foo'\nalias baz='echo baz'\nalias egrep='egrep --color=auto'\nalias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'\nalias foo='echo foo'\nalias grep='grep --color=auto'\nalias l='ls -CF'\nalias la='ls -A'\nalias ll='ls -alF'\nalias ls='ls --color=auto'\nthufir@dur:~$ \nthufir@dur:~$ baz\nbaz\nthufir@dur:~$ \n\nnow the baz alias works.  I only just now realized that a previous answer had mentioned this technique, but they had buried the lede.\n", "Q: What's a simple/standard way to set up a secondary ubuntu server on the same machine? I manage several ubuntu servers remotely, and occasionally, there will be a need to run fsck on the root partition.\nFrom what I've read, the best way to achieve this without physical access to the machine is to have another OS installed, and tweak grub to boot into that OS after reboot. I have done that on some of the servers, and it did prove useful once or twice.\nHowever, installing the two OSes was a pain, since I couldn't use simple \"Guided - use entire disk\" options, and had to manually craft the partition sizes and define the boot/swap/root etc, which made the installation less pleasant.\nSo my question is: is there a simple way that I'm missing to just install a second ubuntu server on the same machine, where I can just tell it \"use 5 GB of the hard drive, and don't bother me with questions\"?\nAlternatively, is there a better way to enable fsck-ing of the root partition without physical access?\nUpdate: after looking around some more, it seems that it might make more sense to install SystemRescueCD on the hard drive, rather than a full-fledged ubuntu. As long as I'm behind a firewall this might be acceptable. Still not an easy solution.\n\nA: I don't think there is an easy way.\nAnd really, you don't know that you need this at install time.. its something that comes up much later when things are really broken.\nLeaving a little bit (1G maybe) of the \"whole disk\" unpartitioned on the guided partitioning install would be a very simple way to make this a lot easier without giving up too much space. brainstorm.ubuntu.com would be a pretty good place to suggest this.\n\nA: For your alternative question: You could force an automated fsck on the next boot? shutdown -rF now\nDepending on your access to a/the recovery console this might cause trouble if fsck runs into some real problems.\n\nA: Boot up with init=/bin/sh as a parameter in grub, and assuming at least the inintrd image is still ok, you should be in a place where you can fsck the root partition.\n", "Q: How do I set executable permissions on a removable drive? I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 and using a usb drive but I'm finding that I can't chmod any programs on the drive to +x. It is being auto-mounted by Gnome (using udev, I think?) so I imagine the problem is a mount option but I can't seem to find a way to modify the default mount options any where. There are no entries in fstab.\nAnybody encounter this problem?\n\nA: I guess your usb drive is formatted with VFAT/FAT32.  This file format does not support execute permissions which is why chmod +x fails.\n[Edit]\nOk, had a bit of a play and search on the net.  Lots of 'solutions' suggest that you should change /etc/fstab.  This just seems clunky to me, what do you do? change fstab every time you encounter a new usb flash drive???\nMy solution:\n$ sudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/90-usb-disks.rules\nAdd the lines:\n# UDEV Rules to change the permission of USB disks\n#\n\nKERNEL==\"sd*[0-9]\", ATTR{removable}==\"1\", ENV{ID_BUS}==\"usb\", MODE=\"0022\"\n\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart\nThen try inserting a usb drive.  There is probably an attribute that you can check for to ensure it's a FAT formatted drive if you wanted to be more specific.\n", "Q: Where does Ubuntu store its library files? I want to add my own library to use in c compiling, but don't really know where ubuntu stores it.\n\nA: Ubuntu follows Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard), regular applications libraries should be stored under /usr/lib .\nPlease note that developing/managing libraries is not a trivial subject, you should read some more detailed documentation, here is a nice tutorial:\nhttp://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LibraryArchives-StaticAndDynamic.html\n\nA: Depending on library, ubuntu stores its libraries mainly in three locations\n\n\n*\n\n*/lib\n\n*/usr/lib\n\n*/usr/local/lib\n\n\nFollowing is from File System Hierarchy Standard\n/lib\n\nThe /lib directory contains those\n  shared library images needed to boot\n  the system and run the commands in the\n  root filesystem, ie. by binaries in\n  /bin and /sbin.\n\n/usr/lib\n\n/usr/lib includes object files,\n  libraries, and internal binaries that\n  are not intended to be executed\n  directly by users or shell scripts.\n  [22]\nApplications may use a single\n  subdirectory under /usr/lib. If an\n  application uses a subdirectory, all\n  architecture-dependent data\n  exclusively used by the application\n  must be placed within that\n  subdirectory.\n\n/usr/local/lib contains local libraries i.e one specific for this system but I can not find references to /usr/local/lib in FHS, it only contains explanation for /usr/local.\n\nA: Based on your comments to your question, I think what you are really asking is \"How do I install a custom library I wrote and where should I put it?\"\nIn general, things built locally for others on the machine to user are put into the /usr/local tree.  The header file should go into /usr/local/include.  The compiled library should go into /usr/local/lib.  The .c file is not part of the library, it is part of the source and not something normally not installed for the use of the end user.  You will need root access to put files in either of these locations.\nTo build the library, you will need to build first decide if you want a static or dynamic (shared) library.  More information on creating a shared library can be foundin section 3.4, Creating a Shared Library at http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html.  (They also have recommendation about where to put stuff -- most developers will have an an opinion or three :-) )\n\nA: You should tell the compiler, where it can find your library. Assumed, the path to your library is \"/path/to/lib/libfoo.a\", you could compile and link your program \"hello.c\" like this:\ngcc -L/path/to/lib -lfoo hello.c\n\nThis is not specific to Ubuntu, actually all C-compilers I know support those flags.\n\nA: In Ubuntu they are found in /usr/include.\n", "Q: How can I block ping requests with IPTables? and stealth specific ports?\n\nA: I believe iptables -I INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type 8 -j DROP should do the trick.\nFor IPv6 you would need something like ip6tables -I INPUT -p icmpv6 --icmp-type 8 -j DROP.\n\nA: Simplest method of disabling ping response is to add an entry in /etc/sysctl.conf file. If the Iptables flushes or stop server will start responding to ping responses again. I suggest the following entry in your /etc/sysctl.conf file\nnet.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1\n\nthis will tell kernel to not respond any ping response, after this run sysctl -p on shell to implement the changes without reboot.\nFor more info please refer: http://www.trickylinux.net/disable-ping-response-linux/\n\nA: To deny responses to ping requests..Add the following iptable rule\niptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -o eth0 -j ACCEPT          \niptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-reply -s 0/0 -i eth0 -j ACCEPT     \niptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type destination-unreachable -s 0/0 -i eth0 -j ACCEPT  \niptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type time-exceeded -s 0/0 -i eth0 -j ACCEPT       \niptables -A INPUT -p icmp -i eth0 -j DROP       \n\n\nA: Drop ICMP echo requests (\"Ping\"):\niptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP\n\nWhat do you mean by stealth? You could just DROP all incoming packets. Google provided this:\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m stealth -j REJECT\n\nBut on (my) Ubuntu box, iptables does not know of a \"stealth\" match.

The Nautilus file manager doesn't seem to have this option in its preferences and for good reason.\nFile extensions are fake\nBy which I mean, in Linux, they are simply part of the file name and have no special meaning like in Windows. In Windows, there is a distinction between file names and their extensions whereas in Linux, the 'extension' is just the part of the name, if any, after a '.'. Linux allows the '.' character to be used as part of the file name but Windows reserves it for separating the file extension. Windows uses this file extension to determine how the file should behave but Linux uses MIME types.\nThis means that there is no reliable way for a file manager to hide the file extension - '.' can be used anywhere in a file name so hiding file extensions may hide part of the file name - this behaviour would be confusing. File extensions are only used to make it easier for a user to tell what type of file they are dealing with - hiding this would hide useful information. \n\nA: Other than in Windows file extensions are not needed for files in Ubuntu. However they are used for convenience when it comes to sort out files according to their content. Therefore extensions are more like a fixed part of the filename and thus will always be displayed.\n", "Q: LibreOffice RC1 deb package difficulties \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I fix “malformed line” errors in sources.list? \n\nI seem to be running into some difficulties with the acquisition of the latest libreoffice deb pkg.\nWhen I type\nsudo apt-get update\n\nI get\nE: Malformed line 60 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist) E: The list of sources could not be read.\n\nI don't understand of that means that I did something wrong or if there is a problem at tuxfamily.\nAny help is, as always, greatly appreciated.\nFull contents of /etc/apt/sources.list.\n\nA: You should probably just install LO from the PPA: Is there a PPA with the latest version of LibreOffice?\n\nA: Change hxxp to http\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hxxp\n", "Q: Choose another partition for /home directory during installation of Ubuntu?

It is actually a GUI for smbclient.\n\n\nA: There is a command line utility for that, nbtscan, it's available from the repositories.\nsudo apt-get install nbtscan\n\n\nA: AngryIP Scanner\nThere is no question about it. It's much closer to netscan and not in beta like sharescanner.\nI just had the same question, and tried all out by now.\n"]
