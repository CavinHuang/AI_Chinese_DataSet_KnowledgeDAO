["Q: Compatibility with Apple Devices and Printers I am a Windows user from the past 8 years. So, I am new to this Linux interface.\nI would like to know whether Apple devices like iPhone,iPad can be connected in Ubuntu.\nAnd also I have a HP(Hewlett-Packard) Deskjet Printer. So, I would also like to know whether these type of printers work with Ubuntu.\n\nA: HP printers works with Linux, as dos other HP devices. As for Apples iPhones, iPads etc well sometimes, some of the mediaplayers have more support than others, try googling your devices with reguard to linux/ Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu plan to move to btrfs as default filesystem? Btrfs seems to have a set of useful features such us snapshots and is default in Opensuse and Suse.Fedora plans to move to it. Does Ubuntu plan to move to it? If not, why ?\n\nA: I'm not sure when, or even if, Debian or Ubuntu will switch to Btrfs as the default root filesystem. Seeing as how it's just recently \"become stable\" I wouldn't be surprised if it were years before it reached Debian Stable (but Ubuntu's based on Debian Unstable...). If it were me, I'd wait and see how it goes for openSUSE for a while.\nIt seems that \"snapshot and rollback [is] the killer function of Btrfs\" mentioned in this openSUSE news page, but it sounds like a solid backup strategy that you can implement in any FS today with a little effort. I do like the compression feature, I think it uses ZLIB now, but I don't think it would compare to something like what xz uses by default.\nThis guy on LinuxBSDos.com says \"With Btrfs the default on openSUSE, when will other distros follow suit,\" but says that while a default install uses Btrfs on root, that \" a separate partition for /home, uses XFS.\" Then adds \"One thing that caught my attention in openSUSE 13.2 is that the root partition cannot be encrypted, with Btrfs selected. I think that’s because in the default partitioning scheme, there’s no separate partition for /boot.\"\nA comment makes the educated guess that \"Btrfs is on root because in case of unexpected troubles, you can always re-install the system. While on /home where there are user data, you can not count on a re-install.\"\nI actually didn't know Btrfs was stable, just read that it became \"stable\" sometime around August 2014 - if Wikipedia qualifies as a good source (Ubuntu's Community Help Wiki on Btrfs says Wikipedia is a \"more info\" link on Btrfs...), the link to the Btrfs Wiki says it's \"no longer unstable,\" and still has:\n\nThe Btrfs code base is under heavy development. Every effort is being made to keep it stable and fast. Due to the fast development speed, the state of development of the filesystem improves noticeably with every new Linux version, so it's recommended to run the most modern kernel possible.\n\nDebian's Wiki doesn't appear to have any new news about btrfs, mentions that it's been in the kernel since 2.6.29 (23 March, 2009)\nActually the Btrfs Wiki's FAQ doesn't appear to have news about it's stability newer than Dec 2012 about either (I'm sure updating documentation is low on the priorities, but hitting stable seems like a milestone to me):\n\n\nIs btrfs stable?\nShort answer: No, it's still considered experimental.\nLong answer: Nobody is going to magically stick a label on the btrfs code and say \"yes, this is now stable and bug-free\". Different people have different concepts of stability: a home user who wants to keep their ripped CDs on it will have a different requirement for stability than a large financial institution running their trading system on it. If you are concerned about stability in commercial production use, you should test btrfs on a testbed system under production workloads to see if it will do what you want of it. In any case, you should join the mailing list (and hang out in IRC) and read through problem reports and follow them to their conclusion to give yourself a good idea of the types of issues that come up, and the degree to which they can be dealt with. Whatever you do, we recommend keeping good, tested, off-system (and off-site) backups.\nPragmatic answer: (2012-12-19) Many of the developers and testers run btrfs as their primary filesystem for day-to-day usage, or with various forms of \"real\" data. With reliable hardware and up-to-date kernels, we see very few unrecoverable problems showing up. As always, keep backups, test them, and be prepared to use them. \n\n\n\nThe Fedora Project Wiki about Btrfs in it's \"Btrfs filesystem DRAFT\" says \"As of Fedora 16 it is slated to be the default filesystem,\" but that was released back in 2011, so I think that page is useless...\nThe Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Storage Administration Guide calls Btrfs a \"Technology Preview\" and that RedHat version was released 10 June 2014 (with \"End of Production 1 Phase\" of Q4 2019).\nIn Red Hat, What does a \"Technology Preview\" feature mean?\n\n\nTechnology Preview features are currently unsupported, may not be functionally complete, and are not suitable for deployment in production. However, these features are provided to the customer as a courtesy and the primary goal is for the feature to gain wider exposure with the goal of full support in the future.\n\n\n", "Q: How to get SHA1 certificate fingerprint for Google Map API key I need SHA1 certificate fingerprint to get Google Map API key but when I enter\nkeytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android \n\nin terminal it shows that keytool can be found in following packages\nThe program 'keytool' can be found in the following packages:\n * gcj-4.8-jre-headless\n * openjdk-7-jre-headless\n * gcj-4.6-jre-headless\n * openjdk-6-jre-headless\nTry: sudo apt-get install <selected package>\n\nthe file keytool already exists in /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_25/bin even though terminal displays this kinda message.\nWhat's wrong with it?\nI use Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit.\n\nA: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_25/bin isn't in $PATH.\nJust use the full path to invoke it.\n/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_25/bin/keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android\n\n", "Q: QEMU Connect physical disk I made a windows virtual machine on my ubuntu pc using the following script (found online).\n#!/bin/bash\n\nconfigfile=/etc/vfio-pci1.cfg\n\nvfiobind() {\n    dev=\"$1\"\n        vendor=$(cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/$dev/vendor)\n        device=$(cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/$dev/device)\n        if [ -e /sys/bus/pci/devices/$dev/driver ]; then\n                echo $dev > /sys/bus/pci/devices/$dev/driver/unbind\n        fi\n        echo $vendor $device > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/new_id\n\n}\n\nmodprobe vfio-pci\n\ncat $configfile | while read line;do\n    echo $line | grep ^# >/dev/null 2>&1 && continue\n        vfiobind $line\ndone\n\nsudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -M q35 -m 6144 -cpu host \\\n-smp 4,sockets=1,cores=4,threads=4 \\\n-bios /usr/share/qemu/bios.bin -vga none \\\n-device ioh3420,bus=pcie.0,addr=1c.0,multifunction=on,port=1,chassis=1,id=root.1 \\\n-device vfio-pci,host=02:00.0,bus=root.1,addr=00.0,multifunction=on,x-vga=on \\\n-device vfio-pci,host=02:00.1,bus=root.1,addr=00.1 \\\n-device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scs \\\n-drive file=/home/bas/windows7.img,id=disk,format=raw -device scsi-hd,bus=virtio.0,drive=disk \\\n-drive file=/home/bas/Downloads/Windows7Pro.iso,id=isocd -device ide-cd,bus=virtio.1,drive=isocd \\\n-hda /dev/sdd\n-boot menu=on\n\nexit 0\n\nThe vfio-pci1.cfg file only contains the pci address for the video card and the usb devices (keyboard and mouse).\nThe script passes one of my videocards through to a virtual machine.\nI will be running 2 of these vms at the same time so I can play games with a friend on the same computer so dual booting is no option.\nIf you start the virtual machine it uses the actual video card for it's display.\nThe virtual machine starts and runs fine I just want to add a physical drive to it so I can share a volume that has only games (no system disk) to the virtual machine, but I can't find out how to do this.\n\nA: Per the documentation:\nhttp://wiki.qemu.org/download/qemu-doc.html#host_005fdrives\nYou should just be able to do\n\n  -hda /dev/sdX\n\nBut, since this is Windows, you basically just took your hard drive out of your computer and inserted it into another.

See the forums recommendations\nUbuntuforums Staff WUBI Recommendations\nYou can still install to another device (USB stick or disk), run Ubuntu in a virtual machine, or shrink a partition to make room for more Ubuntu partitions.  Adding partitions is only tricky if the Vendor has already used the 4 allowed Primary partitions.  In that case, you need to copy the data off one, delete it, shrink the adjacent one (if necessary for more room), and create an extended partition (counts as a primary). Inside the extended partition, you can add many logical partitions.\n\nYou use the same ISO for virtual machines as the regular downloads.  See the VirtualBox information in the community documentation Title Index for docs.  It may not be for Windows, but I know VirtualBox runs under Windows.  Installing to a USB is no different than installing to any other device, select it in the installer, partition it, and install.  There are some optimizations you can apply to improve performance -- search the forums and questions for tips, but basically, they all boil down to moving things like /tmp into a ramdisk.\n", "Q: Ubuntu still ask to update the package that I have removed Recently I have removed the game 0 AD from my system by using sudo apt-get remove 0ad.

The script can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14750650/how-to-delete-history-of-last-10-commands-in-shell\nFor convenience here it is:\nfor x in `seq $1 $2`\ndo\n  history -d $1\ndone\n\nI put this in my include directory (one which I've added to the PATH) where I run many other scripts I've written and work just fine.\nThis does not produce the desired result of deleting rows from my history, in fact it does nothing at all. \nAny idea why the history command doesn't work? I'm wondering if it has something to do with the directories.\nAdditional Info:\nI played around with the code and tried different variations.

I can't figure out why. This script is being run from /$HOME/Scripts/ and it has been included in the PATH. I also tried running it with sudo and nothing changes.\n\nA: Edit: It seems that there still seem to be some problems on certain machines that run this script. Another (and perhaps the best) way of doing this would no be attempting to use a shell builtin, but rather directly modifying the $HISTFILE\n#!/bin/bash\nHISTFILE=~/.bash_history # Or just let the shell decide\nfor x in `seq $1 $2`\ndo\n  sed \"\\'$1d\\'\" $HISTFILE\ndone\n\nOriginal Answer:\nThe problem seems to be with running the bash script non-interactively...\nThis thread on Unix and Linux seems to cover a workaround method to get your script working:\n#!/bin/bash\nHISTFILE=~/.bash_history   # Or wherever you bash history file lives\nset -o history             # enable history\nfor x in `seq $1 $2`\ndo\n  history -d $1\ndone\n\n\nA: In one sentence: it doesn't work because you aren't calling it correctly.\nFirst, since your script doesn't start with #!/bin/bash, it isn't actually a bash script. Which shell it is executed by depends on how you invoke it. When you invoke it from the bash command line, bash forks a new instance of itself (this has to happen to execute any external command anyway), and it's this new instance that executes the script. So the script is executed with the same settings (including the history so far) as the parent shell. It is executed with different options; in particular, history tracking is off for the commands in the script (which suits you, since otherwise it would add to the history that you want to modify).\nWhether the bash instance executing the script has the HISTFILE variable set depends on whether it was exported in the parent (which is a little weird). If it isn't exported and thus set in the child, then the child script won't save the modified history when it ends. \nIf HISTFILE is exported, then the child script will modify your history file. However, unless you've configured your interactive shell to reload the history after every command, the modified history will only be picked up by newly started instances of bash.\nIf you want to run a shell snippet that affects the current shell instance, you must run that shell in the current shell instance, instead of running it as a subprocess. You'd run into a similar problem if you wanted to do other things that affect the shell process itself, such as changing directories, setting variables, etc. Use the . (“dot”) or source builtin to run a script in the current shell process.\n. idelhistory 300 365\n\nAlternatively, you could define this as a function in your .bashrc.\n", "Q: interchange 2 strings in file terminal command I want to swap 2 strings in a file \nHere is the example \n[ link ]( text ) \n\nI want to make it \n[ text ]( link )\n\nhow can i do this ? i tried something with while but i can't make it \nlink = http://something.com etc \ntext can be anything\n\nA: $ echo \"[ link ]( text )\" | perl -pe 's/\\[(.*?)\\]\\((.*?)\\)/[$2]($1)/g'\n[ text ]( link )\n\n\nA: In bash, assuming the bracketing and white space is fixed, this will do it:\na=$(echo \"[ link ]( text )\" | cut -d ' ' -f 4) ; b=$(echo \"[ link ]( text )\" | cut -d ' ' -f 2) ; echo \"[ $a ]( $b )\"\nYou could make it shorter, but hopefully this way is clear in how it works.

Than you can cross referance the IP with the IP's in the resolvers.csv file. You can also go to opendns.com/welcome and find out if you are indeed using they're nameservers or not.\nAnother way would be to install wireshark, and start capturing packets. You will see every single packet going through your system. If are using dncrypt without a dns cache, such as dnsmasq or unbound, you will be able to see the IP address of the nameserver, however you should not be able to see the query itself, because it's encrypted.\nOf course, there are tools such as dig and whois that you can use to debug DNS related issues as well.

I can not interact with the panel or any application, only move the mouse around. A short time later, the notebook fans get very noisy.\nWhen I change to a TTY and check what keeps the system busy, it's usually ibus and ibus-ui-gtk3 that use >100% CPU. RAM usage is normal. But I am not sure if that is related to my problem, because after killing ibus Unity is still frozen. Only killing Xorg helps.\nI just use the system normally, web browsing, texting, programming. I have only installed few programs.\nI installed all updates. I tried both, the open source and the proprietary driver for my AMD GPU (I have a Intel/AMD dual GPU). This only happens with Unity.\nI've found a similar problem, but disabling ibus in settings and killing it does not solve my problem. I have used Ubuntu on this machine before and it did not behave like this.\n\nA: I also recently began experiencing desktop freezes in Ubuntu 15.04 when minimizing certain application windows. The freezes always occurred in mid-animation, with Chromium and LibreOffice especially -- it seemed to occur with resource-hungry applications. I experimented with swapfile \"swappiness\" settings, but it didn't help. Finally, I used Unity Tweak to disable window animations: Window Manager > General > Window Animations (OFF) ...and so far, this seems to avoid the freezes. Will report here if the freezes return with animation turned off.\nFollow-up: The Unity launcher worked fine for a day, then became unresponsive again after minimizing application windows, even with window animations turned off. I don't think this is a straightforward graphics bug after all. Maybe this is a development issue in Ubuntu's gradual transition from X.org to the Xmir/Mir display server. The difficulty is this (mis)behavior isn't reliably reproducible. Currently the only workaround is to Ctl-Alt-F1 to tty1, use the 'top' command to check the frozen application name (Q to exit top,) killall  (repeatedly, if for Chromium-browse, until \"no process found\" is reported,) and then return to the Unity desktop with Ctl-Alt-F7.\n\nA: Most likely the problem is nautilus crashing as nautilus is responsible for the desktop items. Try out the following solutions if anything works out :\nTry removing the nautilus config files\n  rm -rf ~/.nautilus\n\nIf it doesn't work out , remove nautilus open terminal\n sudo apt-get purge nautilus-open-terminal\n\nIf nothing works, until the patch comes around,  just open nautilus before minimizing the last open window. I hope this helps\n\nA: Well, I don't know if this is a universal solution but at least worked in my case. From the Ubuntu Tweak I just \"enabled\" the icon on the desktop and suddenly everything works!\nI spent many days trying other suggested solution without success, I tried also to disable the animation effects or other things but nothing changed.\nAfter enabling the icons on desktop the speed to minimize the windows became even faster.   \n", "Q: instalation process error I have able to install Ubuntu on my PC.\nEverything goes fine till, copying file dialogue box pops up., after coping for a while error shows up.

I came across the ctrl+alt+F2 command and, curious as we humans are, I clicked the combination without any notion as to what was about to happen. When the raw terminal came up I tried to switch back to the graphical interface, quickly realizing that I did not know how to do this. In a half-panic, I taped the power off button and my computer shutdown (note: I did not force the shutdown). \nUpon restarting my computer, I realized that I could no longer maintain my session open on my admin account. After about 20 seconds I would get kicked off the session with no warning. I am receiving an error but (new as I am to Ubuntu) I'm not quite sure how to track it down. I am able to maintain a guest session going indefinitely but it is my admin session that gets logged out automatically. \nCan anyone provide some assistance please?\nEDIT:\nAfter creating a new sudo user, I have ruled that it is the account that is corrupted. I did some further research and found that deleting the .Xauthority file on the home directory of the corrupted used is sometimes the answer as when you log into the account again, the .Xauthority file should be recreated. However, after I deleted the .Xauthority file, it would no longer get recreated and I could no longer log into the account. Any ideas?\nOn a separate note, this is only a GUI problem, as I can log into the account perfectly through the raw terminal (ctrl+alt+F2) and maintain that session indefinitely.   \nEDIT2:\nEnded up cloning the profile by moving all my files into a new account and giving it sudo privileges. After some research it seems as if I corrupted the .Xauthority or .profile files under my home directory when I shutdown after launching the raw terminal from inside my corrupted profile. I will try tinkering with this some more but as of now the issue is SOLVED\nThanks for helping :)\n\nA: Part one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start recovery mode\n\n*Select drop to root shell\n\n*Type mount -o rw,remount /\n\n*Type adduser username sudo #username=your user name\n\n*Type shutdown -r now\nPart two:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repeat first three steps of Part one\n\n*Type passwd username\nThat's it.\n", "Q: how to update python version on ubuntu 14.10 I'm trying to figure out what version of python i have installed, and also upgrade it to the latest. \nWhen I go to a command prompt and check, it looks like I have an old version of python installed.  \nme@linuxdev:~$ python\nPython 2.7.8 (default, Oct 20 2014, 15:05:19) \n[GCC 4.9.1] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> \n\nBut then when i launch the sofware center in Ubuntu and check the \"installed\" section, under \"developer tools\" i see an entry for \"Python (v3.4)\"\nSo I'm not really sure what version I'm running. \nI would like to \n\n\n*\n\n*remove any old unused version of python.\n\n*end up with one version, which should be the latest \n\n\nThanks. \nEDIT 1\nThis is what happens when I try to reinstall python from the commandline:\nme@linuxdev:~$ sudo apt-get --reinstall python\nE: Command line option --reinstall is not understood\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.10 comes with Python 2.7.8 (available as python, python2 and python2.7) and Python 3.4.2 (available as python3 and python3.4) installed by default. \nAs many programs depend on them you can't remove any of them without breaking your system.\n\nA: To install or update python just type this in Terminal:\nsudo apt-get install python\n\nThat's it :)\n", "Q: What to do now? update just after install Configuration file '/etc/psd.conf'\n ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.\n ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.\n   What would you like to do about it ?

This is because some administrators don't want to update to kernels because things might break and explode (metaphorically).\nYour course of action should be as such:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update (sudo apt-get dist-upgrade or similar) to the latest kernel if you want the fixes included in it and are willing to remove the latest kernel if it fails.  Make a note of the version of your kernel you have now first (uname -a), and what the highest version number that is being installed is.  You may need this info later.\n\n*Boot to the newly installed kernel.  If all boots fine and works, then go to 3(a).  Otherwise, go to 3(b).\n\n*Steps to Take:\n(a) If all works fine, you can try and use an autoremove to get the old kernels gone.  You can erase the old kernel to conserve space, or keep the kernel around as a backup.  sudo apt-get autoremove is a good start point.  If nothing is removed then you need to go hunting to remove the older kernels.\n(b) If all does not work fine, then when booting at grub, choose \"Other options\" or similar, and choose the older kernel number that you kept and referenced.  Choose the kernel from that list.  Then remove the newly installed kernel versions (this is why I said to take down the package versions and names)\n\n", "Q: what is mounting windows 7 file system Something is mounting my windows 7 disk on /media/jim/0236A16836A15E03\nand I can't find out what is doing it.  \nI installed a thing named nautilus which I found referenced in another questions answer.\nI can't find 'nautilus either'.  \nI want to mount my windows disk from .bashrc on something easier to remember but how do I know what device it is on?  \n\nA: Your partition with windows7 is mounted by automount.\nThis is usual.

I have a physical server with about 10TB in two different LVMs and VGs. I'm going to be installing a bare-metal hypervisor on the hardware now, which means I'll have to rebuild my Ubuntu server. I set up my LVMs a while ago but as far as I know they are all software constructs right? Is there a way I can backup my entire configuration and restore it on another virtual server?\n\nA: Volume information is stored on the disks, so it should be no problem as long as you can attach your physical volumes directly to the new virtual machine. The procedure would be no different than if you moved the disks into a new computer. \nhttp://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/recipemovevgtonewsys.html\n\n13.6. Moving a volume group to another system\nIt is quite easy to move a whole volume group to another system if, for example, a user department acquires a new server. To do this we use the vgexport and vgimport commands.\nNote    \nvgexport/vgimport is not necessary to move drives from one system to another. It is an administrative policy tool to prevent access to volumes in the time it takes to move them.\n13.6.1. Unmount the file system\nFirst, make sure that no users are accessing files on the active volume, then unmount it\n# unmount /mnt/design/users\n\n13.6.2. Mark the volume group inactive\nMarking the volume group inactive removes it from the kernel and prevents any further activity on it.\n# vgchange -an design\nvgchange -- volume group \"design\" successfully deactivated\n\n13.6.3. Export the volume group\nIt is now necessary to export the volume group. This prevents it from being accessed on the ``old'' host system and prepares it to be removed.\n# vgexport design\nvgexport -- volume group \"design\" successfully exported\n\nWhen the machine is next shut down, the disk can be unplugged and then connected to it's new machine\n13.6.4. Import the volume group\nWhen plugged into the new system it becomes /dev/sdb so an initial pvscan shows:\n# pvscan\npvscan -- reading all physical volumes (this may take a while...)\npvscan -- inactive PV \"/dev/sdb1\"  is in EXPORTED VG \"design\" [996 MB / 996 MB free]\npvscan -- inactive PV \"/dev/sdb2\"  is in EXPORTED VG \"design\" [996 MB / 244 MB free]\npvscan -- total: 2 [1.95 GB] / in use: 2 [1.95 GB] / in no VG: 0 [0]\n\nWe can now import the volume group (which also activates it) and mount the file system.\nIf you are importing on an LVM 2 system, run:\n# vgimport design\n  Volume group \"design\" successfully imported\n\nIf you are importing on an LVM 1 system, add the PVs that need to be imported:\n# vgimport design /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2\nvgimport -- doing automatic backup of volume group \"design\"\nvgimport -- volume group \"design\" successfully imported and activated\n\n13.6.5. Activate the volume group\nYou must activate the volume group before you can access it.\n# vgchange -ay design\n\n13.6.6. Mount the file system\n# mkdir -p /mnt/design/users\n# mount /dev/design/users /mnt/design/users\n\nThe file system is now available for use.\n\nA: What are you planning on having xen and the dom0 boot from?  If you have another disk for that purpose, then you can just pass the existing disks directly through to the new vm and they will work without modification; you just have to set up an hvm domU.\nA more typical setup would be to have the dom0 manage the disks using lvm and/or md for raid, then present the logical volumes to the guest vms as xen virtual disks.  The guest can stack its own lvm on top of the virtual disk if it wants to, but doesn't need to.  If it does, you just need to make sure that dom0 isn't trying to activate any volume groups it finds inside of its logical volumes, which may require modifying /etc/lvm/lvm.conf's filter rules.\nMoving from the current system to such a setup via backup and restore just means you go through your usual disaster recovery routine: update your backup ( i.e. with tar ), boot the new vm, format the virtual drive ( which may involve setting up lvm again if you want to go that route ), then restore.\n", "Q: How to uninstall dualboot Ubuntu 14 and Windows 8.1 dualboot So I used This Tutorial to install dualboot.

I installed Evernote with Wine on Ubuntu 14.04, and it works great.  I'd love to have the icon stay on the Launcher for speedy access, but when I right-click and select that option, all I get is the Wine icon that does nothing when I click on it later.  How can I get an Evernote icon?\n\nA: You can start apps with wine through the comand wine start /Unix \"/absolute/path/to/file.exe\" or wine start 'C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\file.exe'. And you can create program links even in dash to find by creating a new *.desktop in the /usr/share/applictions folder.\nSo, do that and write into that file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Evernote\nIcon=/path/to/icon\nType=Application\nExec=wine start '[PATH]'\n\nIf you can't find the icon, possibly it is packed into one of the *.exe files, search it (e.g. this http://findicons.com/files/icons/2653/android_icons_2/600/evernote.png), save it in PNG format (make sure you cut away white corners, this simply looks more right) and use it's location as icon path.\nThis should do it, displaying the icon and showing up in dash search so you should be able to keep it in the starter when you run it.

I have used Ubuntu for a long time, but this is my first \"ask\". I have tried searching for answer for my questions below - but could not find an answer, therefore I encouraged myself to ask here. Please bear with me if I should have known better.\nMy question is related to \"Update Manager\" why it downloads more than one kernel images.\nExample:\n -) On Jan-13-15 it downloaded: initrd.img-3.2.0-75-generic-pae and initrd.img-3.13.0-44-generic\n -) On Jan-9-15 it downloaded:  initrd.img-3.2.0-74-generic-pae and initrd.img-3.13.0-43-generic\netc.\nFYI:\n =) On July-25-14 it already downloaded initrd.img-3.5.0-54-generic.\nAccording to System Monitor, my Ubuntu system:\n *) Release 12.04 (precise) 32-bit\n *) Kernel Linux 3.13.0-44-generic\nQuestions:\n 1) Why is it downloading kernel 3.2 (in Jan-15) when it already downloaded kernel 3.5 in Jun-14.\n 2) Why is \"Update Manager\" downloading more than one kernel image?\n 3) Do I need more than one kernel image?\n 4) If I do not need more than one kernel image, how can I stop \"Update Manager\" from downloading the unneeded kernel?\n\nA: You have both linux-image-generic and linux-image-generic-pae installed.\nThus, whenever a new kernel is released, you're getting both the PAE and non-PAE version.\nPAE stands for physical address extension, and is a way for 32-bit computers to access all 4GB (in some cases more) of RAM.  If you have 2GB RAM or less, there is no benefit to using PAE.  If you have 4GB RAM or more, then you would get more benefit by using a 64-bit operating system (due to updated instruction set) given that pretty much all CPUs released in the last 10 years will support it.\nThat said, switching to a different architecture generally requires a re-install, whereas switching to a different kernel is easy, so in the meantime you can just use the PAE kernel.\nUninstall the package you're not using; linux-image-generic or linux-image-generic-pae.\nThen you can uninstall individual kernel packages as needed, which have names like linux-image-VERSION-generic.  When removing installed kernels, however, remember:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't remove all kernels or you won't be able to boot.  Always leave one known working kernel (eg the currently running kernel, you can check what that is by uname -r) and the kernel you want to switch to.\n\n*Your system will try to update the initramfs and grub menu automatically when you change the installed kernels.  You can manually do this with update-initramfs -k VERSION and update-grub but you shouldn't need to, as long as there are no errors during the install/remove process when installing or removing a kernel package. \nFurther information:\nThe packages linux-image-generic and linux-image-generic-pae are just shell packages that do not actually contain the kernels, but they cause the new kernels to be fetched when there is an update, because of their dependencies.  The former will cause you to get all new generic kernels, and the latter will cause you to get all new generic-pae kernels.  I don't know if there are any potential conflicts/downsites to having both sets fetched each time, or how grub chooses which one to use as default.\n", "Q: Shadow drag effect on display in portrait mode I just got a new AOC 27 inch pivot monitor (AOC Q2770PQU).\nI've got it connected to a System 76 Galago Pro laptop with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4750HQ CPU @ 2.00GHz with Intel Haswell Mobile graphics. 16GB of Ram. It's running on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit. \nProblem: When I rotate the monitor 90 degrees to portrait mode (changing the \"rotation\" setting in \"System Settings => Displays\" to clockwise), there is significant shadowing/drag effect when scrolling in Firefox and other applications. It seems like the refresh rate is very slow in that instance. Navigator is really bad when dragging windows. Interestingly, Chromium is fine.\nWhen I connected the same monitor to a three year old Mac Mini (also has i7) and set it to portrait mode, there was no problem. The scrolling and window moving, etc. were fine.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I had this problem too on a carbon X1 laptop. My setup was a bit different and I'm on 15.04 and I was rotating the other screen with xrandr, rather than using the system menu. Nonetheless, it also has a recent intel gpu (broadwell, but I don't think they're that different), so it's probably the same problem. Here's how I fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install new (>= 2.99.917) xserver-xorg-video-intel. This is default on 15.04. It'll be more annoying to install on 14.04 (try ppas maybe?), but can be done.\n\n*Install kernel 4.0. The pkgs are at http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.0-vivid/. More install info at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds. It seems that you have to install them with dpkg. Note that they're labelled \"vivid.\" There are no 4.0 kernel builds labelled \"trusty.\" I don't know if you will be able to install the 4.0 vivid builds with trusty. You can always upgrade. Or google for \"How to install 4.0 on trusty.\" Or compile your own kernel.\n\n*Ensure that you are using SNA acceleration. SNA is the default, so if you haven't done anything fancy with xorg confs, you should be using it. I'd previously switched to UXA acceleration to deal with some issues that came up as a result of not having the fixes in the newer kernel and intel driver. Anyway, it didn't work for me until I'd switched back to SNA and restarted X.\nNow my external monitor refreshes all fast and shit when I rotate it.\n", "Q: Enable Touchpad configuration in ubuntu 14.04 Toshiba Tecra Z40 I just acquired a Toshiba Tecra Z40, it detects the touchpad as a PS2 Mouse generic. \nI would like to disable clicking by tap and enable two finger scroll. \nCould you give me any clues? \nThanks in advance! \nAram\n\nA: According to this site:\nhttp://www.linlap.com/toshiba_tecra_z50\n\nthe problems I had with the touchpad not being recognized (which is an\n  issue to many) were solved by updating to kernel 3.17\n\n", "Q: Problem setting up Environment for 'make' command execution I am trying to set up devkitPro for ARM use, but I continuously get an error while executing the last two commands.

I am certain that there cannot be that much there, but I really don't know how to use git, I just used it once for a tutorial.\n\nA: Well, 91G is your filesystem and home. 90% of that is in your home directory. Your personal files. \n2.2G ./chris/.git\n55G ./chris/Videos\n129M ./chris/Downloads\n3.4G ./chris/Music\n20G ./chris/Documents\n651M ./chris/Pictures\n746M ./chris/.cache  \nThat is over 82G there. Literally half your drive is used up in /Videos. \nAlso, run:\nsudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get autoremove\n\nAnd get \"Disk Usage Analyzer.\"\n\nA: On SSD disk you have to run fstrim regularly too. SSD works differently than old fashion hard disks. Take a look here: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/fstrim.8.html.\nRun fstrim on all your partitions. For instance:\nsudo fstrim /\n\nand make sure this is executed on a regular basis. Maybe a the start of a computer. Take a look also for information about optimizing Linux for SSD:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Solid_State_Drives\n\n*https://wiki.debian.org/SSDOptimization\n\n*https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/ssd\n\n*etc.\n\n", "Q: Fix grub with dual boot on different drives I have windows 7 installed on C drive and Ubuntu 14.04 on another one. When I boot I got into grub rescue. Luckily I've found the solution ( somewhere on stackoverflow) to \"mount\" drive manually by\ngrub rescue > ls (hd1,msdos5) # let's assume this is the linux partition\ngrub rescue > set root=(hd1,msdos5)\ngrub rescue > set prefix=(hd1,msdos5)/boot/grub # or wherever grub is installed\ngrub rescue > insmod normal # if this produced an error, reset root and prefix to    something else ..\ngrub rescue > normal\n\nand then I am able to boot either in Windows or Ubuntu. From my research I suspect that boot loader cannot find boot files from Ubuntu drive, but I am unsure how to fix this. I also tried grub repair but to no avail. \nMy question is what can I do to make computer locate correct boot files for ubuntu ?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: So then I would like to direct your attention to this post: repair-grub\nIt is a very popular question (not the same problem as you, but...) where somebody answers in detail how to repair a destroyed GRUB installation. He therefore updates the config files and rewrites GRUB into the disc's bootsector. Maybe this is something you should try too, though it looks like you have to spend a nice amount of time for it and net a live-cd.\nLet me know if this finally helped you, it is my last idea for the moment.

I think it's called onboard. You should reach it in the panel with that round symbol with a human inside. At least you could work with this until you find a real solution.\n\nA: I use the \"English (International AltGr dead keys)\" layout, I've found it easier for entering the characters I need.

Internally, we use Ubuntu (14.04 Trusty) on our workstations, and until now we've done all of our builds by hand, including the creation of RAID/LVM/LUKS-encrypted volumes.  This doesn't scale, and I'm now working to automate some of our processes to reduce the amount of \"hands on\" involvement required to build a fresh workstation.\nOur hard disk configuration is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda & /dev/sdb are both 1Tb Hard Disks partitioned identically and RAIDed\n\n*\n\n*1Gb Partition with RAID 1 containing ext4 filesystem mounted as /boot\n\n*Remainder of drive RAID 1 containing a LVM PV/VG (vg_raid)\n\n*\n\n*8Gb LV for swap space\n\n*Remainder of space - LV containing ext4 filesystem mounted as /\n\n\n\n*/dev/sdc 128Gb SSD\n\n*\n\n*Single partition containing a LVM PV/VG (vg_ssd)\n\n*Single LV using all available space containing an ext4 filesystem which is mounted at /ssd\n\n\n\nPartitioned in this way we have a large, redundant, root filesystem for general data storage, and a smaller partition on which files which are I/O speed sensitive can be placed (e.g. MySQL databases).\nI'm trying to replicate this in a partman expert_recipe with related configuration so that it can be created by the Ubuntu installer.  My main issue is that there doesn't seem to be a (working?) mechanism in the partman recipe \"language\" to specify that a specific LV needs to be created in a specific colume group, and which LVM physical volumes are assigned to each volume group.  I had an earlier version of this configuration working without trying to partition/format/mount any volumes on /dev/sdc, but as soon as the extra \"non-RAID\" drive is involved, I can't seem to express what I want in the partman recipe.\nThe relevant portion of my preseed.cfg file is as follows:\nd-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc\nd-i partman-auto/method string raid\nd-i partman-lvm/device_remove_lvm boolean true\nd-i partman-md/device_remove_md boolean true\nd-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true\nd-i partman-lvm/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true\nd-i partman-auto-lvm/new_vg_name string vg_raid vg_ssd\nd-i partman-auto-lvm/guided_size string max\nd-i partman-auto/expert_recipe string                              \\\n      boot-root ::                                                 \\\n              512 10 1024 raid                                     \\\n                      $primary{ } $lvmignore{ } $bootable{ }       \\\n                      method{ raid }                               \\\n                      device{ /dev/sda /dev/sdb }                  \\\n                      vg_name{ vg_raid }                           \\\n              .                                                    \\\n              4096 20 -1 raid                                      \\\n                      $primary{ } $lvmignore{ }                    \\\n                      method{ raid }                               \\\n                      device{ /dev/sda /dev/sdb }                  \\\n              .                                                    \\\n              2048 20 -1 lvm                                       \\\n                      $primary{ }                                  \\\n                      $defaultignore{ }                            \\\n                      method{ lvm }                                \\\n                      device{ /dev/sdc }                           \\\n                      vg_name{ vg_ssd }                            \\\n              .                                                    \\\n              8192 100 -1 ext4                                     \\\n                      $defaultignore $lvmok{ }                     \\\n                      in_vg{ vg_raid }                             \\\n                      lv_name{ lv_root }                           \\\n                      method{ format } format{ }                   \\\n                      use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext4 }         \\\n                      mountpoint{ / }                              \\\n                      device{ /dev/sda /dev/sdb }                  \\\n              .                                                    \\\n              4096 100 100% linux-swap                             \\\n                      $defaultignore $lvmok{ }                     \\\n                      in_vg{ vg_raid }                             \\\n                      lv_name{ lv_swap }                           \\\n                      method{ swap } format{ }                     \\\n                      device{ /dev/sda /dev/sdb }                  \\\n              .                                                    \\\n              2048 100 -1 ext4                                     \\\n                      $defaultignore $lvmok{ }                     \\\n                      method{ format } format{ }                   \\\n                      use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext4 }         \\\n                      device{ /dev/sdc }                           \\\n                      in_vg{ vg_ssd }                              \\\n                      lv_name{ lv_ssd }                            \\\n                      mountpoint{ /ssd }                           \\\n              .                                                    \\\nd-i partman-auto-raid/recipe string                              \\\n    1 2 0 ext4 /boot  /dev/sda1#/dev/sdb1                    .   \\\n    1 2 0 lvm  -      /dev/sda2#/dev/sdb2                    .\nd-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean true\nd-i partman/choose_partition select finish\nd-i partman/confirm boolean true\nd-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true\nd-i partman-md/confirm boolean true\nd-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true\nd-i partman-md/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true\nd-i partman-lvm/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true\nd-i partman/mount_style select label\n\nYou'll note that I've tried to be quite specific about which partitions/volumes are to be placed on which disks, but partman doesn't seem to honor at least some of that configuration.  I've also kept the minimum volume sizes fairly small while I test this configuration on a VM.  When I run an install with this configuration onto a VirtualBox VM with smaller drives, the install fails with the error message:\nError while setting up RAID\nAn unexpected error occurred while setting up a preseeded RAID configuration.\n\nCheck /var/log/syslog or see virtual console 4 for the details.\n\nThe relevant section from syslog is as follows:\nJan 13 02:41:54 md-devices: mdadm: No arrays found in config file or automatically\nJan 13 02:41:54 partman:   No matching physical volumes found\nJan 13 02:41:54 partman:   Reading all physical volumes.

I've Googled a lot for versions terms relating to partman recipes and preseed in general, and I can't find a canonical reference for the different configuration options in a recipe and why they're applicable.  I've found a number of RAID examples, and many LVM examples, but nothing that mixes the two in the way I'm trying to use them.  This thread from the debian-user mailing list suggests that what I want to do isn't possible, and that seem to track with my impression that the partman recipe language doesn't have the tools required to describe what I'm trying to acheive.\nIf anyone can point out what I'm doing wrong with my configuration, or even just some good reference materials on partman expert_recipe and the configuration language involved, that'd be most appreciated.  At this point it looks like I can automate my entire install, except for the partitioning portion, which is really the main thing I wanted to automate!\n\nA: Using preseed file to create raid+lvm is tricky.\nBasically, you cannot create a flexible configuration file using preseed.

Is there such a software that allows you to enter different passwords. When you login with one of them you can see all your files, but when you put in the another one, you can only view selected files?\n\nA: You should elaborate on you true intentions. If you are trying to setup a local file share that you can edit and others can read then simply set the permissions of those files to readonly for others. If you are setting up an online file share like Dropbox then the process is the same. \n\nA: What about using something like TrueCrypt? Don't know if this exists for Ubuntu and yeah, I heard that they stopped developing and say they are not 100% safe anymore, but if you don't have to hide things from the FBI/... this is more than enough. You can create virtal volumes that you save either as a file on your disk (you can also hide it e.g. in a video file) or in unpartitioned space on your disk. Any encrypted data created by TrueCrypt should theoretically look like random numbers and therefore your boss or anybody should not be able to see even IF you have encrypted data.

You need 2 users for this with each their own password where user2 only has access to part of the files of user1.  This is actually very typical of large organisations where individual users have access only to the information they need on a file server. \nTo accomplish this you need to set up a data directory (or data partition if you'll be adding more users afterwards) using groups where individual groups have access to certain directories.\nIf you want to \"hide\" just one particular directory or a bunch of files from another user (like dad) that has access to your password , just look at this answer: How can I easily encrypt a file?\n", "Q: how to kill any process \n*\n\n*My process show using this command :\n abc@ABC:~$ ps -e | grep -e apt -e adept | grep -v grep\n 2838 ?        00:00:11 aptd\n\n\n*This 2838 Process kill using this command\n sudo kill -9 2838\n\n\n*But also its give me Error \n bash: kill: (2838) - Operation not permitted\n\nI am use Ubuntu 12.04 now What can I do For this Error?\n\nA: You probably need to use sudo. \nsudo kill -9 2838\n\nThen pgrep -fl apt to see if it is still running or \nps aux |grep aptd\n\nto see who the user is and what the PID is:\nphil     20438  0.0  0.0  11744   916 pts/2    S+   10:43   0:00 grep --colour=auto aptd\n\n", "Q: Converting to .deb or .rpm Is there any way to convert already installed applications into .deb files?

Please help..\nAnd I don't want any solution in which another user has to type anything in terminal everytime..\nThannks\n\nA: You can do this by adding the secondary user to a specific group, and then modifying the permissions of the shared folder.

Right click the folder in your file browser, go to the permissions tab and under \"group\" select the correct permissions for the \"sharedfolders\" group. When on your secondary user account, you can browse to that folder and make a bookmark or link to it however you prefer to do that for easier access.\n\nA: Create a group, add the users to it. Create a folder. Grant access to the group, with whatever permissions you like. Add a link to the folder (with the same name, probably) to each user's home directory. \nThis is very flexible, but I'll do a walkthrough, for users Adam & Bella:\ncd ~ ; mkdir share\naddgroup workers ; adduser Adam workers ; adduser Bella workers\nchown :workers share ; chmod g+rx share ; chmod g-w share ;\nThe links will want adding by the users, or use su (assuming you know their passwords)\nsu Adam\ncd ~ ; ln /home/Deepak/share share -s ; exit`\n& repeat for Bella.\n", "Q: Locale troubles I'm having trouble fixing my locale settings.

I don't know whether it is a bug, but I think so. \nMy solution now is:\nWhen you locked the screen, there is the small window with only the locked user name and a text field to type in the password. Here, you have to click on the gear symbol in the upper right corner of your screen and choose \"Change user...\" (don't know the exact title, I have the German version).\nThen you get to the same login screen as after a normal boot or complete logout.

Do files under the following mount points change other than during software installation? \n\n\n*\n\n*/opt\n\n*/var\nCan they be placed on read-only media?\n\nA: Installations under /opt/ are always 3rd party. Updates of software installed in /opt/ depends on the way that 3rd party believes updates need to be done. Several pieces of software I use have an \"check for updates\" button in their GUI. Others expect you to download a complete new version of their software and install it side by side with the old verion so they do not bother with updates of the old version. I have seen several software create log files in /opt/ in their own log directory. It really depends on the software in question but I would say no.\n/var/: variable files—files whose content is expected to continually change during normal operation of the system—such as logs, spool files, and temporary e-mail files.\n\nCan they be placed on read-only media?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*/opt/: No but depends on the software. \n\n*/var/: no. Well, technically yes but you will need to alter all software writing to /var/ to write elsewhere. MySQL stores it database by default in /var/ but that can be changed. Log files tend to go to /var/log/ but that also can be changed. Cups uses /var/spool/ to store temp files for printing and so on. \n\n\nA: /var should not be placed on read-only media. Even the name says that much. Many volatile directories reside there - most importantly /var/log, as well as /var/spool, /var/run.\n/opt, possibly, not much happens there outside of software installation. \nSee the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for more information, which says this about /var:\n\n/var contains variable data files. This includes spool directories and files, administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary files.\n...\n/var is specified here in order to make it possible to mount /usr read-only. Everything that once went into /usr that is written to during system operation (as opposed to installation and software maintenance) must be in /var.\n\nFor /opt:\n\nDistributions may install software in /opt, but must not modify or delete software installed by the local system administrator without the assent of the local system administrator.\n\n", "Q: Error in sudo apt-get remove -f I have installed kernel 3.18.2 with Cinnamon on Ubuntu 14.04.1:\njohn@john-G31M-S2C:~$ sudo apt-get remove -f\n[sudo] password for john: \nReading package lists...

When I right click on Properties for my ext4 partition I get the following pie chart:\n\nThe meaning of the blue and white slices are fairly obvious, since they are in the legend to the right, but what does the grey slice represent? It's quite substantial and at least a couple of GB's in size.\n\nA: By default ext2, ext3 and ext4 reserve 5% of all space for the root user and to prevent fragmentation (see this mailing list). However as this particular disk is used for archiving data that doesn't change much, I have taken the liberty to change this percentage to 1%, using the command:\nsudo tune2fs -m 1 /dev/sdb\n\nthe last item /dev/sdb reflecting the location of my disk. Behold:\n\n\nA: It shows the size of index table of your filesystem.\nIn every HDD,  you can not use the whole space for yourself.When any kind of partition is made on disk; to keep track of index of any file stored on it, parttion table is created to look up when we try to access any particular file.Not only that much information but all other information regarding each partitions' starting sector to end sector, sector size, structure, sector skewing information, etc...\n\nLike in FAT(File Allocation Table, you can store a file max of 4GB at a time, for greater than 4GB it won't allow you as it's capacity is of 4GB only.)\n\nThere are different types of File-Systems, which uses different techniques to hold information, so that grey mark can be vary according to File-System you're using\nOR possibly it can be showing OS reserved space that used as SWAP area, for PAGING purpose, but I doubt it, if I'm wrong than correct it. Above answer is quite sure.\n", "Q: Can I have my software on a different partition than the base installation? I'm planning to install Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 alongside an existing Windows 8.1 installation (following the guide on Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI). \nI've partitioned my hard disk as follows at the moment:\n\n\n*\n\n*1000MB healthy recovery partition\n\n*260MB healthy EFI system partition\n\n*1000MB healthy OEM partition\n\n*~427GB NTFS healthy (boot, page file, crash dump, primary) (Windows 8.1; C:)\n\n*~16GB unallocated\n\n*450MB healthy recovery partition\n\n*~439GB NTFS healthy primary partition (B:)\n\n*25GB NTFS healthy primary partition, don't want to touch it, it's the Lenovo partition (D:)\n\n*20GB healthy recovery partition\n\n\nI probably can shrink the C-disk at the end and make a new partition of at least around 40GB.\nIf possible, it would be my preference to create a new partition there and install Ubuntu on that one. That way, I keep about half the disk for the B-disk, without any installation, so I can use it for backups.\nHowever, I'm not sure if 40GB will be enough if I would install a lot of additional software (would it?). There will not be any data there as I will put it all on B:. Would it be possible to have the ubuntu base installation in one partition and all additional software on another one? \nIf that's possible, I assume that 16GB is more than enough for the base installation. Is this correct? Then I don't have to shrink the C-disk. In the guide I linked earlier, they say at least 8GB, but better 20GB.\n\nA: \nHowever, I'm not sure if 40GB will be enough if I would install a lot of additional software (would it?). \n\nI have yet to get over 10Gb for all software I installed and that includes Apache and MySQL (with the database on a 2nd partition). Excluding my personal data since I keep that on another disk. \n\nThere will not be any data there as I will put it all on B:. Would it be possible to have the ubuntu base installation in one partition and all additional software on another one? \n\nYes, if you install software from source you can choose where it needs to install. But ... I would not bother. It is a lot of hassle and not worth the time.\n\nIf that's possible, I assume that 16GB is more than enough for the base installation. Is this correct? Then I don't have to shrink the C-disk. In the guide I linked earlier, they say at least 8GB, but better 20GB.\n\n20Gb is included /home/. It is pretty easy to keep /home/ under 2.5Gb by moving all the directories to another partition and use that to store your personal data with a symlink to /home/.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu Server via SSH I registered for a domain and a online hosting on GoDaddy.com. I only have access to it via their website and SSH. Is there any way to install Ubuntu server on this so that I log into Ubuntu via SSH instead of the current OS?\n\nA: No, you decided what operating system to use when you signed up with them.\nIf you picked Windows, Fedora or CentOS you wont be using Ubuntu. If you chose Ubuntu it will be the version they installed for you. This only applies to dedicated servers.\nIf you have a managed Virtual Private Server Ubuntu is not even an option.\n", "Q: Can I stop wget creating duplicates? If I run wget twice, it doesn't recognise that it has already downloaded that file, and creates a new one. Is there any way to prevent it downloading the file again?\n$ wget https://cdn.sstatic.net/askubuntu/img/logo.png\n...\nSaving to: ‘logo.png’\n...\n\n$ wget https://cdn.sstatic.net/askubuntu/img/logo.png\n...\nSaving to: ‘logo.png.1’\n...\n\n(Happy to use curl or a similar scriptable alternative if wget can't do this.)\n\nA: Also there is another option called -nc for wgetting:\n--no-clobber\n   If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory, Wget's behavior\n   depends on a few options, including -nc.  In certain cases, the local file will\n   be clobbered, or overwritten, upon repeated download.  In other cases it will be\n   preserved.\n\nWhen -nc option is specified, Wget will refuse to download copies of the same file. If you had the same file that wget tries to download, it will refuse to download it unless you rename or remove the local file.\n$ wget -nc https://cdn.sstatic.net/askubuntu/img/logo.png\n...\nSaving to: ‘logo.png’\n...\n\n$ wget -nc https://cdn.sstatic.net/askubuntu/img/logo.png\nFile ‘logo.png’ already there; not retrieving.\n\nSometimes this option is strongly good and I recommended to use -nc option instead of both -c or -N option because these options will overwrite the download-file with your local file if they had same names.\nCaveat (from jofel's comment)\nThe -nc option does not update the file if it has changed on the server. If you know the file will change, the -N option is preferable. If you know the file will not change (or you don't care) then -nc is ok.\n\nA: I suggest you use the -N option.\n-N\n--timestamping\n    Turn on time-stamping.\n\nIt enables time-stamping, which re-downloads the file only if its newer on the server than the downloaded version.\n$ wget -N https://cdn.sstatic.net/askubuntu/img/logo.png\n...\nSaving to: ‘logo.png’\n...\n\n$ wget -N https://cdn.sstatic.net/askubuntu/img/logo.png\n...\nServer file no newer than local file ‘logo.png’ -- not retrieving.\n\nCaveat (from αғsнιη's comment)\nIf the server is not configured properly, it may always report that the file is new and -N will always re-download the file. In this case, -nc is probably a better option.\n\nA: Yes it's -c option.\n--continue\n    Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when you want to\n    finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget, or by another\n    program.\n\nIf the file is the same, the second download attempt will stop.\n$ wget -c https://cdn.sstatic.net/askubuntu/img/logo.png\n...\nSaving to: ‘logo.png’\n...\n\n$ wget -c https://cdn.sstatic.net/askubuntu/img/logo.png\n...\nThe file is already fully retrieved; nothing to do.\n\nCaveats (from jofel's comments)\nIf the file has changed on the server, the -c option can give incorrect results.\nWith -c, wget simply asks the server for any data beyond the part of the already downloaded file, nothing else. It does not check if there was any change in the part of the file that is already downloaded. Thus, you could a corrupted file which is a mixture of the old and new file.\n\nLocal test\nYou can test it by running simple local web-server as following(Thanks to @roadmr's answer):\nOpen a Terminal windows and type:\ncd /path/to/parent-download-dir/\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\nNow open another Terminal and do:\nwget -c http://localhost:8000/filename-to-download\n\nNote that filename-to-download is the file that located in /path/to/parent-download-dir/ which we want to download it.\nNow if you run wget command for multiple times you will see:\nThe file is already fully retrieved; nothing to do.\n\nOk,now go to /path/to/parent-download-dir/ directory and add something to the source file, for example if it is a text file, add a simple extra line in it and save the file. Now try with wget -c ... . Great, now you will see the file re-downloads again but you already have downloaded it before.\nReason: why re-downloading?\nbecause its size changed to larger size than old downloaded file and nothing else.\n\nA: I know this was a specific question concerning wget but the OP did mention \"Happy to use curl or a similar scriptable alternative if wget can't do this.\"  I am not sure what the requirement here is (multiple files, keep old version if different from original, replace with newly downloaded version).  Depending on what you want and how you want to handle duplicates you may need more than this..  A very simple way to do what you seem to want is simply to use curl instead.\ncurl http://cdn.sstatic.net/askubuntu/img/logo.png?v=ca4d192163aa > logo.png\n\nThis command will replace the old file with the newly downloaded one every time.\nDo not output this to the terminal (without the \"> [filename]\") if you are downloading a binary file as opposed to text.  Doing so will could potentially mess with your terminal session.  In the case you do do this on accident you may need to open another shell/terminal session.\n", "Q: How to make CTRL+F4 to close the current tab in Firefox?

A managed machine is one on which the landscape-client is installed, and registered with the server.  So long as you don't register any other machines in it, Landscape Dedicated Server ships now with enough free licenses to build a simple cloud utilising 10 machines, but if you plan to put a decent sized cloud into production that way you're going to need to buy more Landscape licenses, which come as part of the Ubuntu Advantage product.\n\nA: The Beta of the OpenStack Autopilot can deploy on up to 10 physical nodes before running into the limits of its built-in license.\nTo be clear, the 10 free nodes will continue to be available even after the Beta period ends.\nFinally, the current Beta does not support HA yet.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Can't install Audacious I've been trying to install Audacious on Ubuntu 14.04 but I can't seem to get it working.\nI have already changed the mirror on Software Sources of Ubuntu Software Center to the main server but still doesn't install and still getting the errors.\nHere are the commands and the errors:\nsudo apt-get install audacious\nReading package lists...

I think, there can be only one extended partition containing logical volumes, but as you first delete the old one this should be fine. But from which environment do you want to perform this? You have to do it from the system on sda3 (the partition you want to keep), or from a live system. You have to unmount the partitions first, too. And you want to delete the boot partition! You have to mark a new partition as boot volume then. It should be the volume GRUB is installed on. \nTo later use the new partitions as swap in your fresh installed systems (Ubuntu?) on sda1 and sda2, you can chose them from within the installer to use as swap or later using gparted (right-click on partition -> use as swap(? only know the German title)).\nI hope this helps you, otherwise feel free to ask again...\nedit: you can perform the repartitioning from within the Ubuntu installer. Just click on \"something else...\" when it asks whether you want to install it instead of/alongside of your old systems (remember I have the German version, so I don't know the exact inscriptions in English!)\n\nIs this what you want to achieve?\nsda1 (primary partition) Linux System 1\nsda2 (primary) Linux System 2\nsda3 (primary) your old system, \"boot\" (GRUB installed)\nsda4 (extended) <container for logical volumes>\n->sda5 (logical) Swap for Linux 1\n->sda6 (logical) Swap for Linux 2\n\nBut what OS do you have on sda3? Ubuntu? Then you would need another Swap: sda7 (logical)\nAnd you have to specify one boot partition where the BIOS looks for a boot loader (e.g. GRUB). This boot loader then loads an OS you can select in its menu from the partition.\nSo you can have many OS on your hard disk, but only one active boot loader responsible for all of them.\n", "Q: Quick way to calculate dimension in inch for photos in Ubuntu I have around 1000 photos that I need to calculate their dimensions from pixels to inches.

Although I normally only access via ssh and the machine is typically headless, I did temporarily attach a keyboard and monitor for troubleshooting purposes. They are unresponsive after ethernet breaks, so I can't get into the system at all to see what's going on.\nI am an extremely novice linux user, so I'm probably missing something really basic here. It was fine until I ran apt-get update a few weeks (maybe months? time is blending in together) ago, then this started happening. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that all the hard restarts have borked an hdd (i had backups, so more annoying than anything else.. but still), the server crashing also breaks ethernet for everything else in the house (including hubby's PC), and I can't really use it as a reliable fileserver b/c if I leave it doing a file copy overnight, I never know if the copy will be able to complete before the next crash.\nThe purpose of the machine, as I said, is just a fileserver. All it really does on any given day is run deluge, sshd, and samba to share a couple drives. That's it. This is not a workhorse machine, it's an old PC turned media server.. and it's met my needs fine.. until now. I'm willing to buy a new ethernet card if necessary, but since the whole machine dies and we haven't even really isolated it to the ethernet card yet, I feel that would be premature.\nI also have wireshark logs from an affected machine on ethernet that I can peruse if anybody knows something specific to look for. I couldn't see anything jumping out at me (either a lack of traffic or a sudden surge in traffic or weird error messages) that would explain why nothing could connect to ethernet anymore.. \nIt seems to MOST frequently crash at night between 1 and 4 in the morning, but it has also done it during broad daylight, which was disappointing because I thought I had isolated it to cron for a few days. :(\nI would love to upgrade to the latest LTS release, but as it is right now, I fear the machine would crash in the middle of it and I'd lose everything and have to start over. Media is all on separate physical drives from the OS, and I could configure samba on a fresh install easily enough... but I could never in a million years remember how I finally got deluge to play nice with my network attached storage device (which I only ever bought one of b/c of how much of a pain it is, the rest of my storage is internal hdds on the server).\nEDIT 01/15/2015: System has been upgraded to 14.04.1 LTS.

The keyboard operates correctly now and I still have two monitors, but this driver produces considerable lag in the mouse. I tried the solution presented here Mouse lag after upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 that said to run \"CompizConfigSettingsManager\" and uncheck \"sync with VBlank\". This suggestion didn't help. So I switched to the third available driver \" Video driver for AMD graphic accelerators from fglrx-updates (proprietary) \". The keyboard and mouse now function properly but my second monitor is not recognized. So here is the summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Source Driver --->   lagging keyboard\n\n*Proprietary Driver --->   lagging mouse\n\n*Proprietary Driver Updates --->   only 1 monitor\n\n\nAnd suggestions on how to fix these issues? I'm not particular about which driver I use, just so long as nothing lags and I have 2 monitors. Thank you all. \nUpdate: 1/14/2015\nI updated my Bios Version from A03 to A08. Now, the keyboard is always fine. When using the Open Source Driver, I have two screens but the mouse lags. When I use the Proprietary Driver or the Proprietary Driver Updates, the mouse functions fine, but I only have 1 monitor. \n\nA: It turns out that my computer has two Radeon HD 8490 video cards. Ubuntu only recognizes one of the video cards. So in using the first video card, there are two ports DisplayPort and HDMI. I connected both monitors to the same video card and now they both function. \nContinuing Problem: The proprietary drivers only recognize 1 of the 2 available video cards.

It is not clear to me. Anyway if you want to install Ubuntu 64 bit OS in your VM with the ISO file, this is doable. You have to mount the iso file in the virtual CD drive and start the VM. What is the hypervisor you are using? I mean, is it VirtualBox, KVM or something else ? If you want to know something else, just let me know. \n\nA: Ahsan,\nThe ISO file is sufficient for what I believe you are asking.  If you simply want to run Ubuntu in a VM you are on the right path and can use the ISO you have downloaded.  What I have done in the past is created a folder in my home directory and named it \"ISO Images\" and then moved the ISO from \"Downloads\" folder to the newly created \"ISO Images\" folder.  I have then opened the VM and during the set-up process, pointed the VM at the new folder and the desired iso image.\nHope this helps and good luck!\n", "Q: Chrome OS: will developer mode remove existing Ubuntu installation?

This partition will contain your bootloader.\nSecond, you must create additional partitions for /, /home, swap and all it deems necessary.\nAfter applying the changes, you should restart to begin the installation, choosing manual partitioning to select partitions.\nThe EFI System partition will also be mounted as /boot/efi, you do not need to tell the installer to mount this partition.\n", "Q: How to use 'if' inside '-exec' attribute of 'find'? I have a directory with many pairs of files. Each non-text file has a textual description partner.

So I've attempted to execute the following:\nfind . -name '*.text' -exec if [ ! -f `basename -s .text {}` ]; then echo {}; fi \\;\n\nHowever, now I get an error:\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `then'\n\n\nA: You just can't use if inside of an -exec action of find command in the way you may wish. This because of the following reasons: \n\n\n*\n\n*The -exec action expects a command. This is from man find (somewhere at the line 697 in my terminal):\n\n\n    -exec command ;\n          Execute  command;  true  if 0 status is returned.  All following\n          arguments to find are taken to be arguments to the command until\n          an  argument  consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}'\n          is replaced by the current file name being processed  everywhere\n          it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just in arguments\n          where it is alone, as in some versions of find.  Both  of  these\n          constructions might need to be escaped (with a `\\') or quoted to\n          protect them from expansion by the shell.  See the EXAMPLES sec‐\n          tion for examples of the use of the -exec option.  The specified\n          command is run once for each matched file.  The command is  exe‐\n          cuted  in  the starting directory.   There are unavoidable secu‐\n          rity problems surrounding use of the -exec  action;  you  should\n          use the -execdir option instead.\n\n    -exec command {} +\n          This  variant  of the -exec action runs the specified command on\n          the selected files, but the command line is built  by  appending\n          each  selected file name at the end; the total number of invoca‐\n          tions of the command will  be  much  less  than  the  number  of\n          matched  files.   The command line is built in much the same way\n          that xargs builds its command lines.  Only one instance of  `{}'\n          is  allowed  within the command.  The command is executed in the\n          starting directory.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*if is not a command as you mat think, but a shell keyword. See the output of type if command.\n\n\nNow, to accomplish what you wish, you don't really need to use if inside of -exec. Just make the test inside of -exec, then use -print (see man find for more info):\nfind . -name '*.text' -exec $SHELL -c '[ ! -f ${1%.*} ]' $SHELL '{}' ';' -print\n\nAnother way would be to use a bash script, as follow:\nfind . -name '*.text' -exec my_if {} \\;\n\nwhere cat ~/bin/my_if gives the following output in my case:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ ! -f $(basename -s .text \"$1\") ]; then echo \"$1\"; fi\n\nFinally, I think that all the normal people using bash would use:\nfor f in *.text; do if [ ! -f $(basename -s .text \"$f\") ]; then echo \"$f\"; fi; done\n\n\nA: Here is a non-optimized way to use an if in an exec clause:\nfind . -name '*.text' -exec sh -c \\\n    'if [ ! -f \"$(dirname \"$1\")/$(basename \"$1\" .text)\" ]; then echo == $1; fi' sh {} \\;\n\nand here is something much better that doesn't launch one shell per file:\nfind . -name '*.text' -exec sh -c \\\n    'for i do if [ ! -f \"${i%.text}\" ]; then echo == $i; fi;done' sh {} +\n\n", "Q: Keyboard Stops Responding While Using Google Docs in Chrome Browser Ubuntu, Unity, 14.10\nWhen I'm using Google Docs in Chrome, as soon as \"All changes saved to drive\" appears at the top of the document, the keyboard stops responding.

This issue is often confused with issues where input is slow or only affects certain websites, as can be seen in this bug report.\nWith Google Docs, I have noticed the issue typically happens with autosaves. I have a theory that during the autosave process, if input is being entered, a queue is building up that iBus or D-Bus (the system processes use to communicate with one another) struggles to handle.\nCertainly, stopping, uninstalling, or replacing iBus with some other input manager will do the trick, but you may be losing functionality in doing so. A better solution is to restart iBus with sudo ibus restart. This will get a new D-Bus bus (which can be confirmed with ibus address) and all will be well.

I have used ntfs in the example - use whatever format it gave from blkid! The final 2 numbers are 0 - pretty much always, see man fstab if you really want to know, & 2 - mount this after all the pass 0 & pass 1 drives so as not to delay boot.\nTry sudo mount -a to check it actually works.\nThis doesn't take account of what seems a long delay in mounting at present - it may be a good idea to run a drive check in Windows?\n", "Q: Error when trying to mount an .iso file I try to mount an .iso file.\nI use:\nsudo mkdir /media/fakecd\n\nsudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop /path/to/your.iso /media/fakecd\n\nBut I get this error message:\ncan't find /media/fakecd in /etc/fstab\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Can you check whether the partition(/path/to/your.iso)  you are trying to mount has entries in the /etc/fstab file.\nIf the entries in not present in the fstab files,only root user is set tomount the partition.To do automate mount please try to add them in the fstab file.\n\nA: I can't tell you how to do this via terminal, but I used to mount an ISO with nautilus, by right-clicking the file and selecting something like open with... > archive mounter (I don't know the exact words as I use the German translation).

I purchased some old software that was made for Windows Vista. Will they work on Ubuntu? Will they work on Windows 7 or 8?\n\nA: Yes but you need WINE https://www.winehq.org/ I recommend latest Development version 1.7.34 (since you said programs are old there is high change they will work great with WINE) for Ubuntu and for Windows if they don't run at first try enabling compability mode but I haven't yet needed to do that so I think you wouldn't too.\n", "Q: Where are header files for GCC located? I want to manually add some header files like math.h and graphic.h for gcc but don't know where to put them.\n\nA: To look for header locations just use the locate command:\nlocate -b '\\math.h'\nlocate -b '\\graphics.h'\n\nor a simpler approach\nlocate \\*/math.h\nlocate \\*/graphics.h\n\nIf you are more familiar with regular expression use\nlocate -r \\/math.h$\n\nTo make sure the database is up-to-date start:\nsudo updatedb\n\nThat's the way I'm searching my headers location.

I know this was asked and answered last year, but I didn't know if Ubuntu has since then added support for installing an ubuntu OS on an exFat HDD.

If there is a way to install a Linux system on exFat I doubt we could call it a Linux system; it would be something new. \nBesides that: exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table) is a Microsoft file system optimized for flash drives.

Router uses DNS servers provided by ISP. I have set up bind DNS server inside my PC and I want router to use DNS server on my PC instead of ISP's. \nWhen I provide my IP (192.168.0.105) on preferred DNS server settings of router, I think router searches for this IP outside the LAN. Is it true? And if it is, what is the way redirect DNS queries to my PC?\n\nA: You'll need to actually confirm your assumption that the router is looking outside the LAN for the DNS server.  Confirming what you think here is tricky.  When you don't have a router you can do a full packet trace on, it's nigh impossible.\nEffectively, though, your router is only getting those DNS servers so it can then later provide them to the machines inside via DHCP.  This is because for the most part DNS lookups occur at the endpoint client/machine/workstation level, not the router unless your router has a DNS forwarder which forwards DNS lookups outbound.  As such, the computers themselves will rely on the IP address as given.  The router is smart enough to know that the IP address is in the internal LAN subnet (there's programmed logic to know what the RFC-dicated private network ranges are instead of public and bogons), and will send it to that internal instead of externally to the Internet.  However, the IP destination for the DNS packet is determined for the most part at the endpoint machines internally instead of the router.\nYou should be able to alter the DHCP settings at the router so the machines connected to the router will automatically get the DNS server entry for the internal machine instead of the ISP servers.  From there, you should be able to test if your internal DNS is working as it should be.  It never hurts to keep the ISP (or if you're paranoid, Google) DNS servers as backups on the endpoint machines in case your bind server doesn't work.\n", "Q: After Installing Ubuntu 14.10 on a Dell Dimension 4600 x-86, Ubuntu Is Running Very, VERY Slow I installed Ubuntu 14.10 on a Dell Dimension 4600 (Pentium 4 2.80 512 RAM) that was running Windows XP.

I have tried fixboot and fixmbr, both say \"the operation completed sucessfully\" however whenever I boot the surface, the logo flashes and than I am directed to grub's command prompt and the only way to boot windows is to type \"initrd\" as if booting linux and than press any key to exit, which boots windows.  This, however, is impossible to do when booting the tablet without the keyboard.  Ubuntu 14.04 is installed on an SD Card which I insert when I need to boot ubuntu, however grub must have been installed on the main drive's MBR. \n\nA: The Suface Pro is a UFEI machine, with a GPT partitioned disk, so the MBR does not enter into the boot process at all. Check the boot order, it should be USB, CD/DVD, then hard disk\nentries for Windows, then Ubuntu.  That should boot Windows when the USB is not present, and the ubuntu entry on the hard disk should never be used.\nThe SD card should have its own EFI partition, and the bootloader used will be /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi, which should be a copy of shimx64.efi, and have grubx64.efi present in the\n/EFI/Boot directory too.  The grub.cfg three line stub file should be put into /EFI/ubuntu (on the USB).  These three files should be on the hard disk's EFI in /EFI/ubuntu (where they will typically be put regardless of what location you specify for the bootloader at install\ntime). Copy them over and rename the shimx64.efi to bootx64.efi.\nDo check that you have set up booting from the SD card in the UEFI settings.  The Ubuntu entry in nvram for the hard disk may be deleted at some point, it isn't used.  Any problems check what devices are used for the grub.cfg files (/EFI/ubuntu on the EFI partition and in\n/boot/grub on the root filesystem.  The hd?s may need to be changed.\n", "Q: Could someone explain what the following command does?

Maybe there are some settings starting with \"Wake-on-...\", which you could try to disable. I think that possibly a device (keyboard, mouse, lan, usb, ...) is waking the machine up for any reason. If you think you know what I'm talking about, try disabling one of those enabled \"Wake-on-?\" options, reboot, shut down and see if it stays off. If not, re-enable the option and try the next until you possibly find the cause. Please do NOT change anything else in BIOS if you don't know what you do, as this could prevent your pc from booting!

I believe I have the latest drivers, and I could really use some help.  Thanks!\n\nA: Whether or not you have OpenGL 4 support depends on your hardware and drivers.  If you use the open-source graphics stack, which I suspect you are, you do not have OpenGL 4 support because mesa does not support it.  If you use Intel's integrated graphics, you have no choice but to use the open-source drivers and you cannot play these games.

Is there a way I recover the data on the rest of the hard drive? The drive was formatted, but not thoroughly (no null bytes overwriting), so the data should still be there. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: You are likely to have lost a lot of files because you have overwritten much of the drive (40Gig is a lot).\nFirst you'll need to create a partition on the rest of the device, but don't put a file system on it. This is easily done in the \"Disks\" utility.\nThen do the following to see a list of files you can recover:\nsudo ntfsundelete <device> \n\nThen use things like the following to recover all jpgs:\nsudo ntfsundelete <device> -u -m *.jpg\n\nor the following to retrieve a file by inode (the first column in the output of the first command):\nsudo ntfsundelete <device> -u -i 99999\n\nNote I haven't tested this as I don't have such data to retrieve.\n\nA: I've had to recover files from inaccessible partitions, or that have been deleted, on a number of occasions and have always found Testdisk and Photorec to be invaluable and reliable. This is the main website for them http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk but I installed using the Software Centre. The interface is text-based and keyboard driven but the documentation is very good and gives a practical example you can follow through for your own disk. I'd be pretty hopeful of recovering files from the unused part of the disk with Testdisk and would also think it worth trying to recover files from the overwritten part of the disk with Photorec (despite its name it won't just recover photos, though it was developed for that).

Typically if there are updates for special drivers (nvidia like drivers come to mind) you may be able to get binary files and an installation script for your architecture.  Otherwise, you will likely get any driver changes (if there were any) when you install kernel updates.\nIf there are special changes for your specific model sometimes you can find kernel patches.

In the post you linked in a comment the person answering even mentions how you can get the \"du\" command in linux to display using the same metric as windows is using which is actually a Kibibyte, Mebibyte, or Gibibyte depending on what you are looking at.\n\nA: Yes, as @Mudit said different os uses different file structure. The different file structure which uses different the size of space for storaging files. The windows os uses NTFS partition and The linux os uses ext3 or ext4 partition. so you can find that the same file shows different sizes in different operating systems.\n", "Q: I am unable to install skype on ubuntu 14.04 When trying to install skype using aptitude I get the following error :\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\nlibaudio2:i386{a} libavahi-client3:i386{a} libavahi-common-data:i386{a} \nlibavahi-common3:i386{a} libcgmanager0:i386{a} libcups2:i386{a} \nlibdbusmenu-qt2:i386{a} libdrm-intel1:i386{a} libdrm-nouveau2:i386{a} \nlibdrm-radeon1:i386{a} libelf1:i386{a} libexpat1:i386{a} libffi6:i386{a} \nlibfontconfig1:i386{ab} libgcrypt11:i386{a} libgl1-mesa-dri:i386{ab} \nlibgl1-mesa-glx:i386{ab} libglapi-mesa:i386{ab} libglib2.0-0:i386{a} \nlibgnutls26:i386{a} libgpg-error0:i386{a} libgssapi-krb5-2:i386{a} \nlibgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-0:i386{ab} libgstreamer1.0-0:i386{ab} \nlibice6:i386{a} libjbig0:i386{a} libjpeg-turbo8:i386{a} libjpeg8:i386{a} \nlibllvm3.4:i386{a} libmysqlclient18:i386{a} liborc-0.4-0:i386{a} \nlibp11-kit0:i386{a} libpciaccess0:i386{a} libqt4-dbus:i386{a} \nlibqt4-declarative:i386{a} libqt4-network:i386{a} libqt4-opengl:i386{a} \nlibqt4-script:i386{a} libqt4-sql:i386{a} libqt4-sql-mysql:i386{a} \nlibqt4-xml:i386{a} libqt4-xmlpatterns:i386{a} libqtcore4:i386{a} \nlibqtdbus4:i386{a} libqtgui4:i386{a} libqtwebkit4:i386{a} \nlibselinux1:i386{ab} libsm6:i386{a} libsqlite3-0:i386{a} \nlibssl1.0.0:i386{a} libtasn1-6:i386{a} libtiff5:i386{a} \nlibtxc-dxtn-s2tc0:i386{a} libudev1:i386{ab} libuuid1:i386{ab} \nlibx11-6:i386{a} libx11-xcb1:i386{a} libxcb-dri2-0:i386{a} \nlibxcb-dri3-0:i386{a} libxcb-glx0:i386{a} libxcb-present0:i386{a} \nlibxcb-sync1:i386{a} libxdamage1:i386{a} libxext6:i386{a} \nlibxfixes3:i386{a} libxi6:i386{a} libxml2:i386{a} libxrender1:i386{a} \nlibxshmfence1:i386{a} libxslt1.1:i386{a} libxss1:i386{a} libxt6:i386{a} \nlibxv1:i386{a} libxxf86vm1:i386{a} mysql-common{a} skype \nskype-bin:i386{a} sni-qt:i386{a} \n0 packages upgraded, 78 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 58.7 MB of archives.

The host is Windows 10.\nThe problem was that the Guest Additions CD image was already mounted. To fix it:\n\n*\n\n*In the VM Manager go to Settings -> Storage.\n\n*Under Controller right-click on VBoxGuestAdditions, and select Remove Attachment. There will be a confirmation box. Click Remove.\n\n*Click the + icon next to Controller to add a new optical drive. A dialog box will open. Choose Leave Empty -> OK.\n\n*Open the VM and select Devices -> Insert Guest Additions. It should power off the VM (not the VM Manager) and restart the VM.\n\nVirtualBox Guest Additions should now be working.\n\nA: I had the same problem and manual installation with sudo apt-get didn't work for me. Different Virtual Box has different guests additions version so it's better to install the guest additions that comes with Virtual Box. So I installed it in this way:\n\n*\n\n*From File manager choose \"Devices\" -> \"Insert Guest Additions CD\nimage...\"\n\n\n*Login Ubuntu\n\n\n*Unmount the CD (guest addition cd image)\n\n\n*Mount the guest additions iso\nIt'll pop up a window asking for confirmation to run it or not.

This time it will pop up a window asking run it or not,\n\n\n*\n\n*choose to run\n\n*enter the login password\n\n*start to install now.\n\n\n\nA: I solved by manually mounting the image (after adding the Device and the ISO according to the Dave Rose's answer) and running the installer.\nsudo su\ncd /media\nmkdir cdrom\nmount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom\ncd cdrom\nsh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nCheck my answer on SuperUser \n\nA: For me, the solution was discovering that you have to add an Empty optical drive in the virtual machine settings!  If you try to \"help\" by pre-loading the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso, it doesn't work.  The shortcut on the Devices menu \"Insert Guest Additions CD image ...\" wants to find an empty optical drive to use!\n\nA: In my case this happened because I was running Ubuntu server which doesn't have a window manager. Here is how I installed:\nFirst, boot up the Ubuntu VM. Then press Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD. The CD has now inserted but you won't see anything. If you try to press Insert Guest Additions CD again you will get the error.\nNext mount the CD:\nsudo mount sr0 /media/cdrom\n\nAnd then cd into the directory (no pun):\ncd /media/cdrom\n\nNext, run the install script:\nsudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nAnd now everything should fine :)\n\nA: Start your Ubuntu in VirtualBox:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Devices -> Optical Drives -> Remove Disk from Virtual Drive\n\n*Go to Devices ->  Click on ->Insert Guest Additions CD Image\n\n*Enter authentication Details\n\n*Shutdown Ubuntu and Close VirtualBox. Open again VirtualBox to see it Working\n\n\nAlso Check Shared Clipboard and Drag & Drop is checked bidirectional \n\nA: The problem many times that happens is that the iso file you installed is already mounted. Just go to Devices-Optical Device-Remove Virtual Disk from Guest installation. Then Manually mount the Guestadditions.iso file by going to Devices-Optical Drive-Choose Disk image then go to the folder where you installed ubuntu, find the guestadditions.iso file and then mount it. Once mounted, simply again click the Devices-Install Guest additions, enter your userID password for Ubuntu and the wizard will then continue to install the guest additions :) \n\nA: I had problems that after mounting ISO the disk was empty in Debian. I made following workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*mount addons image in Deamon tools in home Win system\n\n*copy files from iso to shared folder to access them from virtual Debian\n\n*perform SH installation directly in that folder (you will have access to addons files all the time via this folder)\n\n\nA: Same error for me with Macos.  I was hitting the error Could not mount the media/drive '/Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso' (VERR_PDM_MEDIA_LOCKED).

My keyboard layout is set to Norwegian, and I have searched the keyboard character layout window without finding it.

My Python code needs a ' and I cannot find it either ...  \nI found an answer here\nhttp://mostad.eu/tag/apostrophe/\n\nthe Norwegian Macintosh keyboard layout does not correspond to the\n  physical Norwegian Macintosh keyboards on one key, which makes it\n  impossible to write apostrophes. All other glyphs and modifiers work\n  fine. My solution is to use the Norwegian [PC] keyboard layout and\n  remap the right command key (called the right Win key) to Alt-Gr with\n  the Keyboard system settings panel (as shown above).This makes the keys don’t \n  match what is written on them, but since I am a touch typist used to\n  the PC keyobard on my netbook, I know where the discrepancies are and\n  can cope. Unfortunately, this also means that there is one more\n  keypress to write an upward or downward accent or the @, but on the\n  plus side: I can write apostrophes. When writing English, I really\n  need those for genitive and contractions. (In Norwegian we hardly ever\n  use them.)\n\nBasically choose the regular \"Norwegian\" keyboard layout. This approach works for me. It also has the effect the \"¨\" key to create letters like \"ö\" works again.

The disk was empty according to Windows, and formatted with FAT32. According to the Ubuntu installation, 33MB of the disk was used though. \nAnyway, I selected the option 'something else', as the option to install alongside windows wasn't available (perhaps because the drive has more than four partitions?) and then selected only this 17GB disk, as mount point /, with FAT32. \nThen the device needed a lot of time, over two hours, to write the changes to the disk. I hadn't expect it to take so long for just 17GB, and went to bed. I closed the lid of my laptop. When I woke up this morning, the device was still running. However, when I opened the lid, the screen stayed black. \nI closed it again and opened it, and then saw some text, like when you start up or shutdown Ubuntu. The text was:\nnouveau E[  PDISP] [0000:01:00.0][0xc000907c][ffff880222a2f400] fini: 0xc2061088\nnouveau E[  PDISP] [0000:01:00.0][0xc000907c][ffff880222a2f400] failed suspend, -16\nnouveau E[    DRM] 0xd1500000:0xd15c7c00 suspend failed with -16\nnouveau E[    DRM] 0xdddddddd:0xd1500000 suspend failed with -16\nnouveau E[    DRM] 0xffffffff:0xd1500000 suspend failed with -16\nnouveau E[    DRM] 0xffffffff:0xffffffff suspend failed with -16\npci_pm_suspend(): nouveau_pmops_suspend+0x0/0xb0 [nouveau] returns -16\ndpm_run_callback(): pci_pm_suspend+0x0/0x150 returns -16\nPM: Device 0000:01:00.0 failed to suspend async: error -16\nPM: Some devices failed to suspend, or early wake event detected \n\nAfter a second, the screen goes black again. Any time I close and open the lid I see this text (added to the text that was already there from last time), but just for one second. \nThe special function key to enable/disable the built-in screen doesn't have any effect, nor does ctrl-alt-del or ctrl-shift-esc. I tried connecting an external display, again with no success. \nI'm reluctant to power off the device as it was doing something with partitions and don't want to lose my data. \nHow to get out of this strange mode? \nThe laptop in question is a Lenovo U410. \n\nA: I am not sure that any damage has been done, but I don't see how powering off your device could make it worse at this point.\nYou will need to reinstall Ubuntu though. Install it in the 17G partition, which should be formatted as ext4 and with / as the mount point. The bootloader should also go on the disk (not the partition) to let you choose the OS. The guide you mentioned has good points on this in the troubleshooting section.\nIf properly done the installation should take less than two hours, or at least you should notice some progress or animation.\n(compiled from the comments)\n", "Q: WiFi issues with HP Pavilion g6 2312ax running Ubuntu 14.10 So I've been using Ubuntu for quite some time now. I've previously used Xubuntu 14.04. I've had problems with my WiFi adapter. My WiFi adapter seems to be disabled in Ubuntu. However, it seems to work just fine in Windows 8.1. I get the \"Disabled by hardware switch\" when I try to enable it. I've tried installing the drivers for my WiFi adapter (RT3290 802.11 b/g/n adapter + BT 4.0 combo). \nI've tried the dkms method described here - How to install wifi driver Ralink RT3290 , and have come up with nothing.

If it is over 15 characters windows machines can't handle it and don't see you in the workgroup!  The result is when you go to browse you are asking your own machine to let you see what's there based on the fact that technically you are the only one in the workgroup that is talking!  Therefore you are challenged by your own \"Browse Master\" which is you!\nTo fix by changing your hostname do the following:\ngksudo gedit /etc/hostname (change to your desired hostname under 15 characters)\ngksudo gedit /etc/hosts (change to your desired hostname under 15 characters)\nthen do...\nsudo service hostname restart\n", "Q: How to type the Devanagari tra letter?

If you are using the Inscript layout, then you have to shift on the devanagari input and type l+d+j.

Scopes and Apps in Ubuntu touch In the last couple of years I made several apps for Android (Native and with Cordova) and now I want to develop apps for Ubuntu Touch. I am not yet in the possession of a Ubuntu supported phone (I will as soon Bq or Meizu release there phone in Europe). What I have heard is that Scopes makes Ubuntu Touch unique, so my question is:\nWhat is the difference between Scopes and Apps?\nI have an emulator running but it is too slow to explore the OS' possibilities.\n\nA: According to http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2015/01/ubuntu-phone-bq-photo-scopes-details\n\"To use a clunky analogy to illustrate the point:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps are like books on a shelf. You take one down, find what you need, put it back. Repeat when needed.\n\n*Scopes are the relevant pages from those books pinned to your noticeboard right when you need them.\"\n\n\nThe link has more information, hope this helps.\n", "Q: Enabling Hot plug removable media. Virtualbox windows guest ubuntu host So I have ubuntu 14.04 host with virtualbox installed. A windows 7 guest os on top of that. \nWhen I add a device filter for a specific device it works perfectly. \nWhat I want to do is add a generic USB device filter that enables me to plug in a usb-stick and it wil be automatically available in the guest.\nI have added the \"all usb filter\" (withouth specific info) but this does not work..\nDoes anybody have any idea why this would be happening?\n\nA: While it's not stated directly in VirtualBox docs, filters with all criteria empty are ignored.\nPossible Workaround\nTo achieve behavior close to wanted you can create multiple filters - one for each USB port. But even this approach not gives exactly the same result - ports are not real USB connectors of your moherboard, but USB controller/hub ports.\nTo determine port number for each of USB socket insert some USB device and find it's port with command:\nVBoxManage list usbhost\n\nAlso make sure your user is in vboxusers system group (remember logoff-logon after adding to user to group).\nMore about creating USB filters in VirtualBox manual:\n\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#idp54668304\n\n", "Q: Start up and shut down issue after software update These two programs updated yesterday.

What alternative software exists, which is more memory-conscious? I could use another open format if .gif is not supported, and I do prefer a CLI tool.\n\nA: Use -limit memory 1GiB to limit the amount of memory convert uses. \n1000s of images would create a huge GIF that most computers will struggle to display. I keep my animated GIFs below 200 images when possible. The fewer the better. If you number your images, this command will delete the odd numbered images rm  *[13579].png. \nSo here is my typical workflow for creating an animated GIF from a movie scene: \navconv -ss 00:26:00 -i someMovie.mpg %5d.png\nrm  *[13579].png\nconvert -limit memory 1GiB -loop 0 -layers optimize -resize 400 *.png output.gif\n\n\nA: If you have thousands of png-s, the anigif format is weird. I would do it in this way, using avconv:   \n avconv -i \"%d.png\" -r 25 -c:v libx264 -crf 20 -pix_fmt yuv420p animated.mov\n\n\nA: \nI could use another open format if .gif is not supported\n\nPerhaps APNG is of use to you. It's supported by some browsers, including Firefox but at the moment excluding Chrome and IE. Since it's just a PNG extension, it's very simple to convert PNGs to APNG. The apngasm tool can do that. But the format is so simple that I recently wrote an APNG assembler myself for Sage. Adapting that code would be an alternative.\n\nA: It sounds like you're trying to make a video. If that's the case, then I'd use a proper video format. \nIn this case, I'd use ffmpeg to convert the individual PNG files to a H.264 video. Since ffmpeg is made to work with videos that can be hours long, it should have no problem with your thousands of images. Using H.264 instead of animated gif will result in a vast improvement in image quality.\nSomething like this should work for you:\n ffmpeg -framerate 1/2 -i img%04d.png -c:v libx264 -r 30 out.mp4\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-framerate 1/2: This sets the framerate to one-half FPS, or 2 seconds per frame. \n\n*-i img%04d.png: This tells ffmpeg to read the files img0000.png though img9999.png. \n\n*-c:v libx264: Use video codec libx264.\n\n*\n\n*You can specify video compression parameters here, if you like:\n\n*-crf <number>: Quality setting. 0 to 51. 23 is the default. 0 is true lossless encoding, which will be quite high bandwidth. 18 is nearly visually lossless. \n\n\n*-r 30: Set the output framerate to 30 FPS. Each of the input images will be duplicated to make the output what you specify here. You can leave this parameter off, and the output file will be at the input framerate, but the resulting movie didn't display properly when I tried it just now.\n\n*out.mp4: Output filename.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a video slideshow from images\n\n*FFmpeg and H.264 Encoding Guide\n\nA: gifsicle is a command-line utility to handle GIF animations. If you are willing to trade memory for speed, you can use its --conserve-memory switch.\n\nA: In addition to other answers: since you want to produce a GIF file, I assume you want to display the image on a web page. If so, I would not bother converting your PNGs at all. Just google for \"javascript slideshow\" and use one of the millions of free scripts. Or write your own, this is really trivial.\nThe benefits of doing it this way are:\n\n\n*\n\n*only one image is loaded in the browser at any time, the slideshow starts fast and does not consume much RAM on the user's machine.\n\n*the solution scales to millions of images. Or billions, if you're patient enough to watch them all :)\n\n*You can add controls to your page to pause, rewind, change the delay or go to a particular frame.\n\nA: Personally, I would just launch it on limited numbers of files instead of all at once. For example, something like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n## Collect all png files in the files array\nfiles=( *png )\n## How many should be done at once\nbatch=50\n\n## Read the array in batches of $batch\nfor (( i=0; $i<${#files[@]}; i+=$batch ))\ndo\n    ## Convert this batch\n    convert -delay 2 -loop 0 \"${files[@]:$i:$batch}\" animated.$i.gif\ndone\n\n## Now, merge them into a single file\nconvert  animated.*.gif all.gif\n\n\nA: You can use apng2gif to achieve the same. From the man page:\n\nProgrmam apng2gif converts APNG into animated GIF format.\n\n   The Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) file format is an extension to the Portable\n   Network Graphics (PNG) specification. It allows for animated PNG files that work similarly\n   to animated GIF files, while retaining backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files\n   and adding support for 8-bit transparency and 24-bit images.\n\n   Default run values are /t 128, no background color. A short syntax hlp is provided without\n   any command line arguments.\n\n\nRun the following command to install the package:\nsudo apt install apng2gif\n\nThen run the following command to convert all .png files to .gif:\nfind -type f -name \"*.png\" -exec apng2gif {} \\;\n\n", "Q: trying to overwrite '/usr/sbin/validlocale', which is also in package libc-bin 2.19-0ubuntu6.3 I can´t upgrade Ubuntu because locales do not get installed:\nroot@ubuntuserver14:/home/administrator# aptitude install locales\nThe following packages will be upgraded:\n  locales\n1 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1338 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 0 B/3,942 kB of archives.

Can anybody help? Thank you!\n\nA: Background information\nUbuntu changed to Upstart as the init system, from System-V. It's a lot faster, by enabling parallel starting/stopping services, decreasing boot times significantly. Services are depending on each other sometimes, for which System-V had a fixed order of starting/stopping them for each runlevel. For Upstart, the dependencies are declarative, like \"start firewall before the network is brought up\", which will make sure the network isn't started before the firewall is finished. Other services without this dependency can already start, this way.\nChange SSH Upstart configuration\nBy default SSH Upstart init configuration in Ubuntu 14.04 does not have any dependency on other services, so it may be brought after the network was shut down. This may cause a dead connection on your clients, because the SSH server won't be able to reach the clients in some occasions.\nAdd a dependency in the /etc/init/ssh.conf (SSH Upstart init configuration):\nUnder\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nadd\nstop on stopping networking\n\nAssuming you do not user network manager, but regular /etc/network/interfaces networking configuration, this will make sure the SSH daemon will be shut down before the network is.\nNote: untested, please verify.\nYou may want to report this as a bug against the openssh-server package. I think it will be an improvement for Ubuntu to have a proper dependency on the SSH init configuration.\n", "Q: Can't get windows application to run in Wine I just installed Ubuntu and would like to be able to run a Windows application using Wine.

It seems rather niche and the bug hasn't been that active  because there aren't enough Wine developers who use it. That's just the way things can be in open source some times.\nYou have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask Omnesys to improve their software so that it works on Wine (or even release a native client)\n\n*Find and pay somebody to keep hacking on Wine until it works. Codeweavers (the main company behind Wine) do have commercial support but I don't think it would be practical to have them fix this just for you. Capable independent developers exist but I don't know how you'd advertise the job.\n\n*Find an alternative application.\n\n*Install Windows in a VM running on Ubuntu and install and use Nest in that.\n\n", "Q: How can I design one Linux file system? In an interview, I came across this question. He asked me \"Design a linux file system.\" He asked to give what all things I would need, Data structures and all. Can anyone help me in this that how I can tackle this kind of problem? Just give me necessary links which I can read and refer. I have read on wikipedia but I am not still clear how to tackle this question perfectly. What he might be expecting? I want basic details which linux file system uses. How can I think of file system if I want to design one. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: It's a huge topic and it sounds like you're starting at the bottom. You need to understand what a filesystem is before you can hope to design one.\nTo the Kernel, a file or directory is just an inode tied to a superblock. The inode stores data location information as well as attributes about ownership, permissions, etc. That scopes out the data. Parallel to all this is a tree structure of dentries. These give filenames (hardlinks) and positions to inodes. Together links and nodes give you the filesystem that transforms from a path to naughts-and-ones.\nThat's a brutally quick skim but those are the elements you'd have to design. You can see from real examples (The Linux Kernel source is famously free) but there are some pretty decent documents out there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Andries Brouwer: The Linux Virtual File System. Full-on but thorough. \n\n*Anatomy of the Linux file system. Not as thorough but good related links.\n\n*TLDP: Virtual File systems Very high level but explains what these elements actually do.\n\n\n\nIn practice though, if you needed to write a filesystem, you'd probably turn to something like fuse-python and write one in an an afternoon. Not as performant as proper filesystems, but quick to write for many tasks.\n", "Q: Error instaling OpenStack with juju due to kvm-ok not being installed I'm trying follow this video-tutorial but using VirtualBox and at the moment to install openstack (over 19:30m), I get the next error:\n\nHow I can resolve it?\nThanks!\n\nA: I believe you're running into this issue, KVM doesn't work inside virtualbox:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to enable nested virtualization in ubuntu\n\n*Bug report with Virtualbox: https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/4032\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 wont connect to ethernet - trying manual question I'm very new to linux - I'm on my chromebook now trying to look up answers.\nSo I can't connect my linux run pc to my Ethernet (I know it's working as my chromebook can connect to it) so I'm now trying to do it manually but I don't know how to find my DNS server to finish the manual set up... I'm assuming I have to look it up on the chromebook as there is no internet on my pc. But I can't seem to get the info if it is even applicable to my pc... any suggestions?\nThank you, Winter\nI am not able to post so I'm trying this to list what I've tried all the normal things to get it to auto-connect. Now I'm trying to do manual connect. I put in IP address, Mask address, and Gateway address. I do not know my DNS server though.\n\nA: If you are on a home LAN, then your immediate upstream DNS service is likely provided by your router, in which case the DNS server IP is usually the same as the gateway IP.\nIf on the other hand you have a direct modem (PPP) connection to your ISP, they likely provided you with the IP(s) of their own DNS server(s) that you can use.\nIn either case, you could instead use one of a number of publicly available DNS services such as\nGOOGLE\n8.8.8.8\n8.8.4.4\n\nOpenDNS\n208.67.222.222\n208.67.220.220\n\n", "Q: Looking to install Thunderbird 31.4 I'm looking for a good PPA to pull the latest Thunderbird release (31.4).  I'm a noob and still finding my way.  Looked in Launchpad.  Found PPA:ubuntu-mozilla-security/ppa. I have Thunderbird already installed in my Ubuntu 14.04.  Do I need to uninstall the version I already have or can I add the PPA and install over the current installation? Looking for guidance.  Ciao! P.S. Hooray for new Thunderbird developments!\n\nA: I agree with @CharlesGreen. TB is now 31.1 on stock 14.04; unless you really need really badly NOW one of the updates, I would really advise to wait. \nAnyway, your answer: after adding the PPA the packages will be updated with the PPA ones; no need to remove and reinstall. Just update and upgrade as per the PPA instruction and you have your package updated (and tracking the PPA from now on).\nGoing back is not so easy, though --- especially if the PPA start pulling dependencies and touching the configuration files. Sometime is plainly impossible... And depending on the PPA, then you can have problems in upgrading the system to a new version. \nSaid so, I use PPAs too --- but you have to be very selective and use them only if you really need the newer packages.  \nYou can find a lot of info here: What are PPAs and how do I use them? and here: How can PPAs be removed?\n", "Q: Ubuntu server 14.04 doesn't boot, desktop does After exhausting my test install of esxi 5.5 I am trying to move to Ubuntu Server on my Dell Precision Workstation 690.\nThe system loads and runs a 14.04 desktop but when trying to install the 14.04 Server on an internal hard drive I get:\nController Bus #00, Device#1F, Function#02: 00 Ports\n\nNo device found\n\nAHCI BIOS not installed \n\nAnd system won't finish booting. \nI can load server on the USB thumb drive and it operates fine. But that is not a good plan to have the system on a thumb drive just waiting to be brushed against/pulled out. \nAll my reading indicates there are no significant differences between Server and Desktop that should cause the issue. \n\nA: I've had the same issue before. I believe the problem rests in the installer CD/DVD software. For that install, I went ahead with the desktop install then using aptitude removed everything gnome-ish or unity-ish etc etc. The root of the problem I had was that the server installer seemed to lag a few generations behind the Desktop. Example: like when Core i3 was brand new, there's a type of error that \"everyone knows is common and the work arounds for it\". This is the kind of problem I had last year trying to load server on one of our boxes.\nAnd speaking of USB drives... I've had Dell C521s that we ran linux from USB drives that were inside the case. There was a spare USB header on the motherboard, so I ziptied the cable and thumbdrive to the side somewhere.\nNow that USB3 is pervasive, it seems* to work as well as any HDD. *-that is anecdotal, didn't perform any speed testing. Now makes me want to see if there's a spare USB header on my Lenovo RD430 server... then I can have the OS on a stick and a backup ready to go.\n", "Q: My KDE desktop is 'GONE' How can I recover it? All that is left of my KDE Kubuntu 14.04 Desktop is a white background with no kicker, launcher, etc. All I get is a couple instances of Object could not be created here or something to that effect. \nGuest account is fine, but my standard user is screwed. \nWhat can I do, other than re-installing Kubuntu?\n\nA: Instead of reinstalling the system you could reinstall the KDE desktop environment. I'm not sure if it helps in this case though. But you may want to try reconfiguring it first by\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure kubuntu-desktop\n\nReinstall it with this command:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall kubuntu-desktop\n\nOnly I think this leaves the configurations, so if it doesn't work, try\nsudo apt-get purge kubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nI hope something works for you!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 server with LTSP and AMD Geode GX-MMX Already installed LTSP with  \napt-get install ltsp-server-standalone\n\nBUT ... anyone know this thin clients?\nI don't know which --arch param use to build LTSP.\n\nA: Geode-GX are processors from 2002.

All of this is then sent to print which displays it. Default field separator in awk is whitespace (spaces, TABs, newlines) so no need in using -F switch.\n", "Q: Best way to re-partition boot partions I am unable to install updates because there is not enough space on my boot partition.

If it's not yet installed, you can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install gparted \n", "Q: Where is gparted in Ubuntu? How do I find gparted in Ubuntu, searching from the launcher sends me to Wiki or shopping?\n\nA: You can find gparted in the Ubuntu Software Center. \n\nA: You can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nAs it will most likely not be installed by default.\n\nA: Gparted is not installed by default. To install it, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

I want to change default group separator in CSV files comma to semicolon.\nHow I can edit bg_BG locale table to make this?\n\nA: You can add a line to your ~/.profile file to change a single locale category. For instance, adding this line:\nexport LC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8\n\nwould make dot the decimal separator the next time you log in, since that's the convention in the US.\nAs regards CSV files, it sounds like a question for respective programming language, and not related to the locale.\n", "Q: How to upgrade Ubuntu?

It is free\n  software and available for Linux/UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X. Unlike\n  most free software for creating 3D models (such as Blender) it does\n  not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the\n  CAD aspects. Thus it might be the application you are looking for when\n  you are planning to create 3D models of machine parts [...].\n\nThen you have a few commercial alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*BRL-CAD - \"a powerful cross-platform Open Source combinatorial Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) solid modeling system that includes interactive 3D solid geometry editing\".\n\n*AutoQ3D - a cross-platform 3D CAD conceived with beginners with mind.\n\n*VariCAD - \"compact, fast, easy to use, and provides everything necessary for mechanical design\".\nApart from these you may also check FreeCAD, a parametric 3D modeller; as I understand this philosophy has been loosing followers.\nRegarding CATPart, there are very few programmes out there able to read it. And those that do apparently use libraries licenced for the purpose. You are advised to opt for a more portable format.\n", "Q: Unable to connect to internet using Android wifi tethering (hotspot) in Ubuntu 14.04 I'm unable to connect to Internet when using Android WiFi hot-spot (I'm able to connect to hot-spot, but not able to access Internet).\nWhen I use a WiFi router Internet works fine.

When I try and open .jpg files I get an error saying this error interpreting JPEG image file:  \nNot a JPEG file: starts with 0x00 0x00\n\nMy windows 8 system opens them fine.\n\nA: If it works on Windows and not on Linux, then the file is not a JPEG file type. The issue is in the file extension. Check out the file extension in the terminal by typing file {filename_with_extension}. The command will return some properties of the file. There you could check the image type. If JPEG is not mentioned, then you would have to change the extension to actual image type. For instance, if something like PNG is mentioned, you would have to change extension to .png from .jpeg. In Linux, extensions are important to consider whereas in Windows it doesn't matter of what extension has been set.\n", "Q: Nvidia: New or the same driver? A few days ago I replaced my Windows by Ubuntu 14 (I have a Dell M15X). After that I notice some random problems with my video card (this was my general impression).

Since I installed Ubuntu only few days ago, was it supposed to install this last version? Or not?\n\nA: Don't do anything!\nYou installed the Nvidia proprietary drivers and if you read the xorg-edgers PPA warning again you'll notice that they did warn you that you will receive these.\nCurrently (January 2015), the Nouveau Open Software drivers currently have some problems on some cards which means that (for the moment) you shouldn't mistake \"nouveau\" for \"better\"... \n", "Q: GUFW from desktop icon I am trying to launch gufw from an icon on my desktop.

I set the mount point for for linux to /.\nWhat should I set the win7 partition to ?\nmy options appear to be /dos or /windows. \n\nA: Either of these will work perfectly fine. The differences only affect the path to the folders and files in that partition.\nAs an example, if you wanted to open a file on the Windows partition called file.txt, with /dos as the mountpoint the path would be /dos/file.txt.

I'd love to remove one device from my life.  My question is: will I be able to use it as a web development tool?\nFor example, like most web developers I run test versions of databases (just a few hundred rows) like MySQL, Postgres, and even riak on my laptop. I run servers like Apache too, of course.  And I tweak my hosts and server config files.  I'd need to be able to run my IDE, as well.\nUbuntu desktop does all of the above even on minimal hardware, but what about Ubuntu phone?  Will it be usable for this type of work?\n\nA: I think the real question here is...Do you really want to do all that work on a small phone screen? Theoretically, this will all work as you wish (I used to use Ubuntu on my tablet through a LinuxDeploy install to test a few things). However, it would be more practical to continue using a laptop, no?\n\nA: I don't think it would work in the way you imagine right now.\nA lot of talk has been made about all this \"conversion\" the ubuntu phones are supposed to bring but I have not seen evidence of this working in the current ubuntu-touch builds.\nI think you might be referring to the functionality that was showcased with Ubuntu for android (at minute 2:17) right?\nThe current builds of ubuntu-touch seem to be very different from this.\nAnother problem would be the architecture of the phones shipping with ubuntu-touch.\nThe two phones it will be launched on will have an ARM based processor. So to have any chance of this to work at all you would have to make sure that there are ARM builds available for each of the software products you need to use (every IDE, browser, database server, database manager and so on).\nSo no the upcoming launch of the mobile ubuntu operating system will very likely not fullfil your needs and the use case you have described.\nMaybe in 1-2 years... ;)\n", "Q: 32-bit ubuntu 14.04 on 64-bit system (dual boot) I have a W7 64-bit laptop w/ external monitors. Wanted a clean W7 reinstall, and wanted to add ubuntu 14.04 to make it dual boot machine to try it out.\nI thought it might be dicey but doable myself. But I botched the W7 install from bootable CD and lost the windows partition. I used a bootable CD of 64-bit ubuntu 14.04 and got the machine working (single boot).\nI couldn't restore W7 w/o the old partition, so I had a local shop (1) do that and (2) set up ubuntu 14 for the dual boot.\nI can pick the OS I want, and W7 works ok. W7 device manager says that the non-Windows (ubuntu) partition is the primary boot partition. But ubuntu won't remember dual monitor settings.  Another app I'm trying to load won't display correctly after multiple methods of installing both it and java, based on web articles and (old) documentation for the app. \nWhen I enter command file /sbin/init, it responds with ...ELF 32-bit LSB..... This means the shop put 32-bit ubuntu on my machine -- RIGHT?  \nThe creators of the other app sent new instructions (similar but different). Questions before banging my head against the wall some more:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can it cause problems to have 32-bit ubuntu on 64-bit hardware?\n\n*If I run my 64-bit ubuntu CD, WILL this:\n\n\n*\n\n*simply replace the current ubuntu -- or do I need to \n uninstall the 32-bit version?  If so, how do I do that?\n\n*put the 64-bit version in the current ubuntu partition?\n\n*keep the boot priority?\n\n*and leave W7 alone and working?\n\n\n\nA: You can simply replace the current ubuntu installation. You do not need to erase or uninstall it. \nBack up your personal files first as this will replace your Ubuntu installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the 64 bit (amd64 version). Burn the iso to a disk (do not\ncopy/paste right click on the file and select burn to disk).\n\n*Go to your bios settings and make sure the dvd drive is set to boot\nfirst on the list of bootloaders.\n\n*With the disk in the drive, reboot or boot the computer. If you need\nto set up an internet connection, select \"try ubuntu without\ninstalling\" and set up the internet connection. Then, select install\nubuntu.\n\n*When you get to the part of the installation that asks you if you\nwant to install ubuntu \"along side\" or whatever, go down to the\nbottom of the screen and select \"something else\".\n\n*Right click on the Ubuntu partition, select to format as ext4 and\nset the mount point to \"/\". Exit the menu, place a tic in the box to reformat the\npartition and scroll to the bottom and select continue or apply\nchanges or whatever. Then continue with the installation.\n\nA: There should be no issue running 32bit on a 64 bit system, except if you have a bunch of ram. 32 bit only going to see/use 2gigs, so if you have more you might want to put Ubuntu 64 on. \nIn Windows, go to Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Computer Management and then Disk Management. \nDelete the ubuntu created partitions. Usually if it was created by Windows it won't even give option to delete. Your going to want to delete the ext file system and I think it grub (real small partition). \nTo delete just right click and delete. Be careful not to delete the 100mb System Reserve, Windows partition or any recovery you may have. \nNow that these partition are deleted you are left with a chunk of unallocated space (where ubuntu used to be) \nNow just restart with installation media and go through prompts. When get to partitions make sure to choise boot alongside windows 7. \nOption 2\nAgain in disk management (in Windows) after delete non Windows/non recovery partitions merge the unallocated space back to C: right click and extend then just keep going next. Now you have one, unseparated C drive \nAgain boot install media, again choose install alongside Windows 7,only this time its going to show you a slider with Windows on one side and Ubuntu on other. From here you can use the slider to adjust what size partition for Windows and Ubuntu will be \nP.S - you can also use uname - a to determine what bit version you have. \n", "Q: Can I use my Virtualbox VMs on ubuntu Dumb question, but I just want to check: I'm thinking of switching to linux (have been using it in VMs fro several years and don't play games and prefer gnome to windows), I have several virtualbox VMs on windows 8, I'm right in assuming that I can just install VB in ubuntu and then start my VMs from my windows 8 install in ubuntu, right? I don't want to have to set them all up again.\nI mean copy all my VMs to an external drive, install ubuntu (which will wipe the drives) and then copy the VMs into ubuntu and start using them.\n\nA: For a smooth transition to another host for Virtual Box virtual machines the following should be considered:\n\n*\n\n*In case we had Guest Additions installed prefer to run the VM in the same or higher Virtual Box version release.\n\n\n*If we had installed the Extension Pack we should install this on the new host too.\n\n\n*Latest (and older) Virtual Box application releases can very easily be installed from the Oracle repository (also see this question for details).\n\n\n*To register the VM in the new host Virtual Box we need to first export the VM appliance as OVF to our harddrive or (recommended) to an external storage. Merge snapshots before exporting as they will not be preserved.\n\n\n\n*Then we can proceed with importing them to the new host.\n\n\n\n*Adjust paths to shared folders if defined.\n\nA: Yes.\nFirst, enable the multiverse repository (which contains VirtualBox). \nEnable Multiverse (Graphically)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Software and Updates\":\n\n\n\n\n\n*Make sure Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse) is enabled.\n\n\nEnable Multiverse From Terminal (Alternative)\nIf preffer command line, enable multiverse from terminal (open with Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:\nsudo add-apt-repository multiverse\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nImport your VM\nOpen Virtualbox, then go menu Machine > Add. \n\nBrowse and select your .box file and click on Open.\nRepeat for all VMs.\n", "Q: unable to install gcc-multilib after upgrading to 14.04 I recently upgraded from 12.04 to 14.04.

When i used the fstab route, i got errors about not being able to mount /home and ubuntu would not boot up.  When i removed the line I added to fstab with recovery mode, I was able to boot up and log in with putty again, but of course, my previous home files were not accessible because they were not mounted.\nSome additional information: I received a 6TB drive to replace a 1TB in my array over Christmas and did so successfully, including a full balance.  My array consists now of (2) 6TB drives and (3) 3TB drives in Raid 1.  The OS is on a SSD separate.\nI suspect something may be physically wrong one of the 6TB drives as when I pulled up the connected drives when trying to mount, one of the 6TB showed no partitions, while the other 4 drives had BTRFS partitions with the name \"home\"\nAny thoughts on how I can get this back up and running?\nThanks! \n\nA: Like the command said, your 5th drive is missing.  Either get it working right again, or mount with the -o degraded option to proceed without it ( and the redundancy it provided ).\n", "Q: Migrating VirtualBox VMs Perhaps not the right forum, and in my opinion more of a comment in addition to this question but as I am unfortunately not yet able to comment, and I'd rather not answer the question and and then have it flagged for not being an answer, I'll just ask a new question.\nI'm running Lubuntu 14.10 in a VirtualBox (VB) VM on a Mac OS X 10.10.1 Host.

Is there anyway that I can access both from ubuntu or windows to the music files without copying these files to ubuntu and windows. I have one SSD and one HDD I want to install ubuntu to ssd and windows to hdd. \n\nA: Yes.  First off, I use a 3 partition HDD.  50 gb both allocated to Windows and Ubuntu.  Ubuntu in the ext4 Jorunal file system and Windows in the NTFS file system.  My data part uses an NTFS File system so it can be read by Windows.  In order to do this, you should make a live usb.\nOnce you are running in your live usb in either ubuntu or windows.  At which point you will format your HDD as NTFS.  Once that is done make a folder and copy your music to the HDD.  \nAt this point you can now safely install Windows then Install Ubuntu.  Windows will always mount anything it see, where as Ubuntu will recongize it, but clicking the HDD icon once on the Unity Taskbar will mount it.\nAs a reminder Windows by default will never see the Z drive Ubuntu uses.  So if you need files from Ubuntu make certain you copy them or download them to your Data Drive.  Ubuntu wil see Windows however.\n\nA: If you use the SSD, you'll want to partition it so it has about half the space for both OS.  When you use the HDD format it as NTFS and then just mount it with Ubuntu.  Simple :)\nEdit\nYour drives are separate devices, Ubuntu and other *nix OS use a file system which basically references all the devices in your computer as if they were like files and folders in one system. \nTo accomplish installing both windows an Ubuntu on the same drive, you'll want to install windows first, but set it so it only uses about half the space on the SSD.  Then once Windows is installed you can install Ubuntu and set it up to use the rest of the SSD for its main EXT4 format storage system and the SWAP, if you want to use SWAP on your SSD.  \nOnce both Operating Systems are installed, you can use either Windows or Ubuntu to format the remaining HDD in NTFS format.  \nWindows will likely mount this disk automatically as E: or F: perhaps.  However in Ubuntu you'll mount this disk by clicking the icon for it in your Nautilus file-browser window or in the Unity Task bar if it shows up there.  After this disk has been mounted you can find it in the file system at /media/<volume name here>  where <volume name here> is replaced with a name of your disk being either the label or an ID number.\nEdit 2\nFor UEFI, Ubuntu should install just fine.  As far as I know Ubuntu ships its latest versions with EFI compatible boot loaders (grub-pc/grub2) \nAfter you install Ubuntu, if you install it second, you should get a boot menu like the regular GRUB boot menu. \nHowever, I personally have not installed a dual boot on EFI/UEFI systems and so I don't know if there are any quirks or manual steps you should definitely know about. \n", "Q: Change Chrome notification positions Chrome notifications on Windows/Mac show up in the bottom right, but on Ubuntu it is the top right.

It appears to give an option for the user to do a manual partition of HDD or accept\nthe default of allowing ubuntu to partition and format the entire HDD.  I can't allow it to delete the windows OEM install which already has 4 partitions that win 8.1 is using.  I want to get away from win 8.1 ASAP, but I don't know enough about Linux at this point to be able to do that.  I am usually a fairly quick study and I have read a lot about Linux, but there is still so much that I don't know yet.  \nI want to give Linux about 80gb plus the 4gb swap partition on my 500gb HDD.  I am currently using only about 55gb of the 500gb drive for win 8.1.\nMy question is will ubuntu install in the fifth and sixth partitions on the HDD and can I get grub, during the install, to reduce the win 8.1 partition by 84gb for it to use for itself and if so, how?\n\nA: When you are going to install from usb, first boot to live mode and use gparted to shrink your windows partition. Then run the install and when it wants to use all your disk, it should let you install it to the empty space.\n\nA: From within Windows, defrag, then shrink a partition, then run chkdsk a few times just to be sure Windows is OK.  Then you can install to the free space.  The GPT partitioning is not limited to 4 primary partitions like the old MSDOS partitioning was, so you can freely add your Ubuntu partitions.\n\nThe Ubuntu install will allow you to add partitions and format them, choose \"something else\".  I'd use ext4 on the root, swap doesn't need formatting, and make swap 4G, the ram size.\nIf your Gateway UEFI settings do not allow turning off secure boot without disabling all of UEFI, and you REALLY should look again, since that badly breaks both the UEFI spec and Microsoft's requirements, you have only limited choices. Ubuntu's grub still cannot boot Windows with secure boot on (bug 1091464), but you can still run Windows from the EFI boot menu (a function key at power-up, varies by machine) to select boot device/OS), so that's one choice, leave UEFI/secure boot on, install Ubuntu, and when you want to boot Windows, use the EFI boot to select it.  The other choices are not pretty: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install in different modes and switch modes each time you want to boot the other OS.\n\n*Reinstall Windows in legacy mode, but the GPT partitioning on the disk will need to be converted back to MSDOS (I think to allow Windows to boot), then install Ubuntu in legacy mode.\n\n", "Q: Setting up subdomains for ubuntu server 14.04? I have spent the past 5 or so days googling and asking on various IRC channels, but I can't seem to find an answer. Before I ask the question, I'll give what information I think is relevant, since I'm not quite sure what is needed. If any more information is required, please let me know. Anyways, I bought a vps through DemonVPS and a domain name (for the sake of clarity, lets call it example.io) through godaddy. I pointed the A file (of example.io) at my vps' IP, and set the rDNS of my vps to example.io, and have apache all setup on my vps. So basically, I have a fully functional website. Now, I want to setup the following things on my vps:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Teamspeak3 server\n\n*An IRC Server (mostly for testing purposes of an ircd)\n\n*An IRC Bouncer (ZNC in this case)\n\n\nI can do all of these quite easily, but the issue is connecting to them. Each of them I have to connect to using \"example.io\", and I want each to have a unique subdomain (ie ts3.example.io, irc.example.io, and ichat.example.io respectively) that they can only connect to through that. I have scoured the internet, but every tutorial I found was either how to setup just the server, or how to setup subdomains in general, and as to that I have gotten mixed answers about needing apache or not. Any help in setting up subdomains for each of these applications would be most appreciative.\n\nA: You not need apache on server for subdomains. You need apache only for web. Enough is to create record on dns server, probably on godaddy.\nichat.example.io A xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\ntype of record is A\nxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is ip of your server\nWhen anybody will to go on your irc server practical will connect to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:irc_port. \n", "Q: OpenVPN: IP check looks good but doesn't seem right I am using OpenVPN with a new VPN service (used to use PTPP without an issue). I am deeply suspicious that the VPN is not working though. The IP checks seem to indicate that everything is ok, but when I try to connect to a site that is blocked in my country I am redirected to the usual government website. I'm assuming not all traffic is going through the VPN. How can I check things are secure?\n\nA: By default, when an OpenVPN client is active, only network traffic to and from the OpenVPN server site will pass over the VPN. General web browsing, for example, will be accomplished with direct connections that bypass the VPN.\nAdd the following directive to the server configuration file:\npush \"redirect-gateway def1\"\n\nIf your VPN setup is over a wireless network, where all clients and the server are on the same wireless subnet, add the local flag:\npush \"redirect-gateway local def1\"\n\nPushing the redirect-gateway option to clients will cause all IP network traffic originating on client machines to pass through the OpenVPN server. The server will need to be configured to deal with this traffic somehow, such as by NATing it to the internet, or routing it through the server site's HTTP proxy.\nOn Linux, you could use a command such as this to NAT the VPN client traffic to the internet:\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/yy -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nThis command assumes that the VPN subnet is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/yy (taken from the server directive in the OpenVPN server configuration) and that the local ethernet interface is eth0.\nWhen redirect-gateway is used, OpenVPN clients will route DNS queries through the VPN, and the VPN server will need handle them. This can be accomplished by pushing a DNS server address to connecting clients which will replace their normal DNS server settings during the time that the VPN is active. For example:\npush \"dhcp-option DNS zzz.zzz.zzz.zzz\"\n\n", "Q: How to make touchpad settings stick on Ubuntu 14.04.1 (Trusty) We've installed Trusty on a 2008 MacBook 4,1 as the sole OS for the machine.

For example, I am using Spotify for linux.\nWouldn't I need to run it in sudo so that it can write its song cache to my file system?\nAlso, if you run a program from the launcher, does it get sudo by default?\n\nA: You need to understand what sudo does. Quoting the Wikipedia page :\n\nsudo (/ˈsuːduː/ or /ˈsuːdoʊ/) is a program for Unix-like computer operating systems   that allows users to run programs with the security privileges of another user (normally the superuser, or root\n\nTo explain further, it gives your program access to the core, sensitive files of your computer. Let me give you an example.\nTry running touch /etc/abc.txt and you will be thrown an Access Denied error message, because the first \"/ \" in the path says that it is in the root directory and hence normal users cannot access it. To make the above command work, you will need to elevate your privileges and that is exactly what sudo does. Try running the above command with sudo and you can see the file will be successfully created.\nUsing sudo for everything is NOT a good practice. You should elevate the permission level of any program only if absolutely necessary. If you keep adding sudo to all the programs, there is a high chance that you'll mess up with the core files of your computer.

I installed Xubuntu (sometimes running Cinnamon, but I digress) and would like to disable journaling in order to make file-shredding the ext4 system partition more effective (non-system/app data is on an NTFS partition). How can this be accomplished?\n\nA: *\n\n*Whatever you do you, make a backup before you play with filesystems!\n\n*Check the manpages ( man tune2fs ) before using this!\n\n*This only works on ext filesystems!\n\nTo disable journaling you can use (where XN points to your partition letter and digit):\ntune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/sdXN\n\n\nFrom the man page:\n\ntune2fs - adjust tunable filesystem parameters on ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems\nOption: -O [^]feature[,...]\nSet or clear the indicated filesystem features (options) in the filesystem. More than one filesystem feature can be cleared or set by separating features with commas. Filesystem features prefixed with a caret character ('^') will be cleared in the filesystem's superblock; filesystem features without a prefix character or prefixed with a plus character ('+') will be added to the filesystem.\n...\nhas_journal\n\nUse a journal to ensure filesystem consistency even across unclean shutdowns.

This option is useful when removing the has_journal filesystem feature from a filesystem which has an external journal (or is corrupted such that it appears to have an external journal), but that external journal is not available.\nWARNING: Removing an external journal from a filesystem which was not cleanly unmounted without first replaying the external journal can result in severe data loss and filesystem corruption.\n\n\nThe filesystem needs to be either unmounted or in read-only mode.

I believe mainline kernel fixed this issue some time ago.\nWhere is the preferred location for this configuration? It must be run as root.\nI have seen this\nHow to run scripts on start up? but I am unsure which answer would work for the required permission level of modprobe.\n\nA: Just edit the file /etc/modules and add a new line with wacom.\nYou can reboot to check if it works.\n\nIf you do not have /etc/modules, try this one instead:\n/etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf\nEven if it should be not a problem since in Debian-like or Ubuntu-like ecc. they are symlinked.\n\nA: Check if you have a /etc/modules-load.d/wacom.conf file. If not, run this command:\nsudo -i\necho wacom > /etc/modules-load.d/wacom.conf\n\nThis will create a configuration file ending in .conf and with content wacom.\nReboot and it will be loaded by systemd at boot time.\n\nA: You can add the line modprobe wacom to /etc/rc.local and it will get executed on boot with root privileges.\n", "Q: Auto rotate scanned text How to automatically rotate a scanned image?\nEven if you insert the paper into the scanned carefully. About one degree rotation is left. Is here no way to automatically rotate the scanned image?\nI use Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: You want to apply the De-skew plugin from Gimp in batch mode. This means you prepare a script, then run it from Gimp in console mode to auto-rotate a number of scanned images in one go. Full instructions can be found here.

It is running in the hand-on-to-smarthost mode.

Usually that should do, but unfortunately I can't see any change. \nFirst of all, if I log onto the mailserver using telnet, there should be a delay, but there's nothing. \nAny help is appreciated!\nThank you for your efforts in advance!\nStephan\n\nA: If I understand you, you wish to receive mail on server, then hold mail in queue, do something and send after that to smarthost. Ok\nDelay can not be applied in communication client <-> mta because you will got time_out.\nMy suggestion is to use queue_domains or queue_smtp_domains and hold_domains.\nSMTP communication aka telnet on server on port 25 will go normally, server will get mail, store them in queue, hold xyz sec, send them to smarthost.\nMore information about Exim main configuratin you can find here\n", "Q: having different operating systems on ubuntu I have seen this computer where when the computer boots up, the grub screen lets him choose operating systems. as the four ubuntu choices like ubuntu recovery and stuff are still there, there is a fifth choice that says windows seven loader. is that possible to do on my computer( Ubuntu 12.04 ). if so, please suggest how.\nThanks :) \n\nA: You can do it, but usually it is best to install first windows 7, and then ubuntu.\nIt is possible to install windows 7 after installing ubuntu, but I had all sort of problems, and needed to reinstall windows each month. \nAnyhow you can try, you will need at least 20 GB of free space, preferably on a new partition. After installing it, here you can find how to restore grub:\nRecovering GRUB after installing Windows 7?\n\nA: All right. You also can get it. It is mostly that you should install linux os , such as ubuntu or other linux, after installing windows os firstly. The reason that linux will manage grub boot rather than windows. you know, you should install windows, such as windows 7.\nThen, you may met some issues if you use UEFI boot's compute rather than grub boot's compute. I can solved it by these steps. Here is that:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, you must close the security boot and fastboot options in bios.\n\n*In terminal, to do sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair.\n\n*To do sudo apt-get update\n\n*To do 'sudo apt-get install boot-repair' for installing boot-repair.\n\n*After installed it, you should do sudo boot-repair.\n\n\nThen, reboot your pc. You can see that the list windows7 UEFI of grub lists in screen.Choose it, and enter. Now, if everything is ok, your windows will can works well.\n", "Q: Gimp uses only one CPU when applying a Gaussian Blur If I use \"Selective Gaussian Blur\" in Gimp, only one CPU gets used. My PC has four.\nIs there a way to tell Gimp to use all available CPUs?\nSome operations take quite long, and this would reduce the time I need to wait.\n\nA: Multi-threading for GIMP filters will be introduced with GEGL support in future releases. At present there is work in progress to port Gaussian blur but this is not yet available.\nAs an alternative we can use the third-party plugin G'MIC which claims to at least partially support multi-threading.

I have some questions regarding this.\n\n\n*\n\n*What OS should I install first ?\n\n*What are the partition sizes should I put for swap, root and home ?\n\nA: First Install windows on your laptop (You can install Ubuntu too but then u have to run boot repair from live USB to repair the grub because Windows bootloader is aggressive).\nFollow these steps if your laptop supports BIOS (the steps are totally different for UEFI laptop)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows 7 normally (Allot 30 GB to windows partition)\n\n*Now install Ubuntu from live USB or live CD\n\n*You should create home partition if you wish to upgrade your Ubuntu without losing any data\n\n*Root partition should be of about 20-30 GB, swap partition of about 8 GB and home partition of about 20-30 GB (i have allotted this much only on my laptop)\n\n\n\nPartition should be of ext4 type memory for Ubuntu\n\nKindly approve my answer if it helps you by clicking the tick below the the arrow pointing downward since it will increase your reputation as well as mine\n\nA: Just as anybody else until now suggested you: First install Windows, then Ubuntu. \nI personally gave 40GB to Ubuntu as root partition without using an extra /home partition and about 800MB swap (2G RAM).\nIf you want to split them up, you should size the / in a way that it can hold all your programs and system. Depending on what you are going to install, maybe 10GB might be enough (around 2-3GB is absolute minimum for the bare system, I think), but e.g. many big games, office progs, media stuff etc might also require a lot more... Then in contrast, the /home partition will contain all your data (photos, music, videos, documents, downloads, system/program settings etc.). So the main part of this will be made by your multimedia data, the rest should not take more than a GB or so. \nFor swap, I think it is recommended to give it about the same size as your RAM, a bit bigger if you want to use it for hibernation (not recommended since version 12 ?)\nBut about the file systems: Ubuntu's default file system for data partitions (all except swap) is ext4! I would suggest you to use this instead of old FAT or windows' newer NTFS. You would not be able to access the files on a ext4 volume from within windows without additional drivers, but for Ubuntu, it has several advantages, e.g. it does not require any defragging and provides always high data transfer speed. As a workaround, you could allocate another partition in NTFS or FAT32 where you can copy the Ubuntu files you have to access from Windows too (the other direction works directly). For swap, you of course use linux-swap.\n\nA: Install Windows first, its bootloader is rather aggressive and will not let you access your (previous) linux installation without further configuration (such as installing the GRUB boot loader again from some medium). Installing Ubuntu second will replace the Windows bootloader with GRUB, saving you the trouble.\nI doubt you would benefit from creating a separate /home partition. Just go with root and swap. Swap should be double the RAM (8 GB in your case), depending on how much memory you tend to use (leaving lots of applications open etc). The size of root depends on what you use the system for.\n\nA: I would install windows 7 first Ubuntu handles being installed secondly much more efficiently than Windows.\nFollow these steps\n\n\n*\n\n*As far as partition sizes are concerned I would go for 30gb ntfs partition for windows and you will need 2 fat32 partitions for Ubuntu\n\n*A swap partition of  2gb to 4gb and a root partition that is a minimum of 10gb.\n\n*Give Ubuntu a partition of about 20gb but it's a personal preference thing.\n\n*The remaining space left on the hard drive you might want to set up as a logical drive you can use ntfs or fat32 but I prefer to use a fat 32 partition labelled Data or media.\nJust how I set up my system.\n\nA: Yeah, you should install windows first. However, during linux installation, when partitioning it is important to have a separate /home partition so that in case of computer or reinstallation later you can select that same partition for home instead of allocating new space. This way you can prevent loss of data. You could additionally do this for /var, /tmp etc but that's a personal preference or if you have a large system with lots of users\n", "Q: My backtick key exits Terminal I have several computers running xubuntu; my main PC does accented chars which is documented, an old 32-but Asus EEE produces a back-tick as it should, but my 64-bit EEE immediately closes the current tab in Terminal (specifically, xfce4-terminal) when I press the key.

With PAE, it can access 64GB of RAM.\n\nA: Short answer: YES. \nThe limit of 32bit is exactly 4Gb. In case of Ubuntu even a bigger amount of ram can be used with 32bit if you are running a so-called 'PAE' kernel. The installer is smart enough to choose for you the best kernel based on the ram amount. \n", "Q: I have just installed LAMP server through tasksel. Can I use it in any graphical way?

Using any modern web browser, you can setup user accounts, Apache, DNS, file sharing and much more. Webmin removes the need to manually edit Unix configuration files like /etc/passwd, and lets you manage a system from the console or remotely. See the standard modules page for a list of all the functions built into Webmin, or check out the screenshots. \n\n\nThere is also apacheConf.\n\nApacheConf is the progam that can configure the remote Apache servers on Linux machines. It will help you to tune the main Apache configuration httpd.conf file on Linux. ApacheConf presents all the information in the httpd.conf file in a structured view. All of the server's directives are grouped by category (Global parameters, Main server's parameters, Directories, Virtual hosts, etc) and all these groups are represented as a tree. In this way, you can see the entire structure of the server on Linux computer at a glance and you can easily manage all of the server's directives, as well as the directories and virtual hosts.\n\n\nIt has some cave-ats: it implements its own structure and ignores any Ubuntu specific configuration and you are bound to the GUI (if it is not implemented into the GUI...)\n\n\nMySQL\n\nFor MySQL I would suggest MySQL Workbench.

Example from the link:\n<?php\n\n// Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL\nphpinfo();\n\n// Show just the module information.\n// phpinfo(8) yields identical results.\nphpinfo(INFO_MODULES);\n\n?>\n\nSave it in your root as \"phpinfo.php\" and point your browser to it (ie. http://localhost/phpinfo.php)\n", "Q: Harddrive replication without *full* dump (dumping partitions is OK) Today, I bought a second server almost identical to my first one (I guess).

Can't even tell which OS is installed).\nHere is how I failed:\nI did fdisk -l on my first disk.\nDisk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders, total 976773168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x000b6660\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        4096    16386047     8190976   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2        16386048    17432575      523264   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda3        17432576   222230527   102398976   83  Linux\n/dev/sda4       222230528   976762879   377266176   83  Linux\n\nThen I did boot the second server in rescue mode (kind like from a live CD: /dev/sda is not mounted and can safely be manipulated).\n\n\n*\n\n*I used fdisk to create 4 primary partitions using the start and end values provided by fdisk (eg: 4096 → 16386047 for /dev/sda1).\n\n*I did set  /dev/sda2 as \"82\".\n\n*I did mark /dev/sda1 as bootable\n\n*I did format /dev/sda3 (/var) and /dev/sda4 (/backup) as ext4\n\n*I did mount both partitions.\n\n*I did rsync /var from the /var of the first server\n\n*I overwrote the first flock (0->4096) of the 2nd hdd with dd (data taken from the 1st hdd).\n\n*I overwrote /dev/sda1 on the 2nd harddrive with dd image from the first hdd\n\n\nI was expecting :\nA harddrive with the same partition scheme, save first 4096 bytes, same /dev/sda1, a rsync copy of /dev/sda3 (/var) and a different /backup (useless for the server to operate).\nWhy does this scheme not work? How can I do better? I have no objection in transferring 500 GB on the network between the two servers to do the whole harddrive, but then I have no way of storing the image on the new server...\n\nA: It does not work because you did not install a boot loader on the new disk.  Grub typically occupies the first 64k of the disk, so you need to dd that much if you want to copy grub.  Then grub looks for your root or boot partition by UUID, so if you formatted a new partition and copied your files, that will not match so grub will stop and wait for you to manually tell it what to boot.  The changed UUIDs on the other partitions will also prevent them from being mounted.  \nIf you just dd grub over then you will need to first tel it where to find itself with the set prefix=(hdXX,Y)/boot command ( fill in drive and partition number ), then the normal command should load the rest of grub and pull up the boot menu, but you will need to press e to edit it and change the kernel root= argument to point to the right partition instead of the old UUID.  Finally you will need to update /etc/fstab so it can find the new partitions.\n\nA: What about using a downloaded tool to professionally clone the entire hard disc? You might look at this question where I tried to describe this to another user an provided some links: click me\nThe question is currently marked as \"on hold\" because it is a bit off-topic, but it will remain accessible as far as I know.\n", "Q: How to create users having different access privileges?

Do this via root user.\nNow simply change ownership of files via chown\nchown -R rootusername:groupname ### /path/to/folder/file\n\nso if your root username is frank, you are setting permission for user1 to set read and write only\nchown -R frank:group1 740 /path/to/folder/file\n\nHopefully this helps you get on the path you were looking for.\n", "Q: Undo apt-get command that removed a large number of packages I installed libatk 1.0.-0:i386 on my 64-bit system by mistake.

Teachers in the classroom access this stream via Windows Media Player or VLC...however, sometimes the teacher is running late, or their computer is having issues, so as a courtesy, I record them from my Ubuntu machine through VLC's magical red record button.

Output (after setting Language consistently) of set | grep ^L[A,C] is\nLANG=en_GB.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en_GB\nLC_ADDRESS=en_GB.UTF-8\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=en_GB.UTF-8\nLC_MEASUREMENT=en_GB.UTF-8\nLC_MONETARY=en_GB.UTF-8\nLC_NAME=en_GB.UTF-8\nLC_NUMERIC=en_GB.UTF-8\nLC_PAPER=en_GB.UTF-8\nLC_TELEPHONE=en_GB.UTF-8\nLC_TIME=en_GB.UTF-8\n\nNow, in a folder with two files Algebra.pdf and Algèbre.pdf, the search function filters as follows\n\n\n*\n\n*alge finds both files (that's good)\n\n*algè finds only Algèbre.pdf (that's also good)\n\n*algeb finds only Algebra.pdf (that's not good), in particular\nalgebre doesn't find anything (that's not good)\n\n\nA: OK, now that you have only one language and locality defined in your user profile, you can already see that en_GB has a different collating sequence then en_US.\nIf you're familiar with database technology, what we'll be accomplishing is something like:\nSELECT Name FROM tPerson WHERE Name LIKE \"helen%\"\nName\n----\nHelen\nHélène\nHelena\n...\n\nI propose the following two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the current language (en_GB) to include the diacritics of both fr_FR and de_DE\n\n*Create a new language (Let's call this one eu_EU) that is based on the language that contains the most diacritics that includes the other ones.\n\n\nAdvantages (by number) :\n\n\n*\n\n*Less work to create a new language\n\n*Less possibilities of an Ubuntu upgrade breaking your work\n\n\nDisadvantages (by number) :\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep good back-up copies and restore them when an Ubuntu update changes en_GB\n\n*None that I can see.\n\n", "Q: Is there Qt Creator documentation available in a ubuntu or debian package? From QtCreator, aka the Ubuntu SDK, I can ordinarily access documentation for classes such as QString and all QObjects, however, I can not access the documentation for classes such as:\nhttp://doc.qt.digia.com/qtcreator-extending/projectexplorer.html\nIs this documentation available anywhere for download, either in a deb or in any other form? I only periodically have the internet, so having a copy on my computer would be nice.\n\nA: eike> AkivaAvraham: run \"make -j1 docs\" in your qt creator build directory\neike> and then in Qt Creator Options > Help > Documentation, add /shared/qtcreator/doc/qtcreator-dev.qch\neike> (that file is also in the shipped qt creator binaries from qt.io, but you have to register it manually\n", "Q: avformat package seems to have outdated headers I have libavformat56 and libavformat-dev installed on my machine.\nI'm building some source right now which uses the libavformat.h header.\nThe source (nameply the Pangolin library by Steven Lovegrove) correctly preprocessor-fences between\navformat_alloc_context    \n\nand\navformat_alloc_output_context2\n\nbased on LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION_MAJOR (compared to 54).\nThis resolves to 56, thus the latter is used. I've checked the official header file over here for version 56, and, as expected avformat_alloc_output_context2 was there.\nHowever, the very same header at /usr/include/libavformat/avformat.h on my system (currently at Utopic) only defines avformat_alloc_context.\nIs this some kind of package bug, or is there something wrong I'm doing here?\nP.S. if you feel like this should be asked on some different Stack Exchange forum, please let me know.\nP.P.S. could anyone with libavformat-dev installed verify they don't have avformat_alloc_output_context2 in their header?\n\nA: The problem is not a package bug.\nIt's just that I stupidly assumed libav would have the same functions for libavformat v.56 as ffmpeg.\nThe same issue is for the \"avcodec_get_name\" function as already asked here:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/23560748/avcodec-get-name-is-not-available-in-ubuntu-libavcodec-what-should-i-use\nffmpeg package seems to be coming to ubuntu velvet, I hope they provide the dev files for that as well, at least with some preprocessor flag to distinguish between ffmpeg and libav.\n[Omitting here my groping about how selfish with respect to the community the libav & ffmpeg maintainers were after the split. At least now they're (kind-a) working together a bit.]\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit only shows 4GB RAM out of 8GB recognized I have two memory cards of 4GB = 8GB RAM installed and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit only shows 4GB RAM. How can I make it show the whole 8GB?\nYou can see the details below, I have also included some graphics (ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5650) info just in case it was eating the RAM memory.\nIt's a HP

I wanted to use iPython Notebook in Python 3 on Ubuntu 14.04. Because I have both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 installed on my system--and for other implementation-specific reasons--I decided to use a Python virtual environment (with virtualenv). Very little has been written about this topic so far...\n\n\n*\n\n*How to install Python package pyzmq properly?\n\n*How to install the latest IPython notebook in Ubuntu 12.04?\nThese reports don't specifically handle Python 3 and virtual environments. Furthermore, the the official and various unofficial guides to installing iPython Notebook don't deal with this use case, either.\nThe main problem I encountered is with the ZMQ library. To install the library and the Python bindings system-wide I used apt-get:\nsudo apt-get install libzmq3 libzmq3-dev python3-zmq\n\nBut when I tried pip install ipython[notebook], either inside or outside my virtualenv, the installation would fail with exit status 1 and the warnings:\nWarning: Detected ZMQ version: 4.0.4, but pyzmq targets ZMQ 4.0.5.\nWarning: libzmq features and fixes introduced after 4.0.4 will be unavailable.\n\nI confirmed in Synaptic Package Manager that the libzmq3 package for Ubuntu is only version 4.0.4. As an alternative, I tried this fix, having pyzmq build its own libzmq dependency:\n pip install pyzmq --install-option=\"--zmq=bundled\"\n\nBut this failed because it couldn't find a certain header file:\n    buildutils/initlibsodium.c:10:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory\n #include \"Python.h\"\n                    ^\ncompilation terminated.\nerror: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1\n\nNext, I built libzmq version 4.0.5 from source.\nwget http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-4.0.5.tar.gz\ntar -xzvf zeromq-4.0.5.tar.gz && rm zeromq-4.0.5.tar.gz\ncd /usr/local/zmq/zeromq-4.0.5\n./configure\nmake -j 6\nsudo make install\n\nNo problems encountered. After this, I tried to install pyzmq in my virtual environment with:\neasy_install pyzmq\n\nI also tried building pyzmq from source. In both cases, I could see from the output that the proper ZMQ version (4.0.5) was detected, but the installation failed because I didn't have Cython installed (a not-well-documented dependency for building pyzmq, in my opinion). \nAfter installing Cython for Python 3...\nsudo apt-get install cython3\n\nI tried installing pyzmq again with pip and with easy_install both inside and outside the virtual environment; it still didn't work. This message was delivered despite cython3 being installed:\nFatal: Cython-generated file 'zmq/backend/cython/_device.c' not found.\n            Cython >= 0.16 is required to compile pyzmq from a development branch.\n            Please install Cython or download a release package of pyzmq.\n\nAnd this file structure:\n$ ls -l zmq/backend/cython/\ncheckrc.pxd         context.pxd         __init__.py         _poll.pyx           utils.pxd           \nconstant_enums.pxi  context.pyx         libzmq.pxd          rebuffer.pyx        utils.pyx           \nconstants.pxi       _device.pyx         message.pxd         socket.pxd          _version.pyx        \nconstants.pyx       error.pyx           message.pyx         socket.pyx \n\n\nA: The \"Python.h\" error message indicates that you are missing the python3-devpackage, which you need to build any Python extensions (Python modules written in C), which you can get with:\napt-get install python3-dev\n\nTo get up and running from scratch:\napt-get update && apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip build-essential libzmq3-dev\npip3 install virtualenv\nvirtualenv -p $(which python3) myenv\nsource myenv/bin/activate\npip install pyzmq\npython -c 'import zmq; print(zmq.zmq_version())'\n# 4.0.4\n\nThe installed packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*build-essential: compilers and headers for building things on Ubuntu.\n\n*python3-dev: headers (Python.h) needed for compiling any Python extensions.\n\n*libzmq3-dev: the libzmq library and its headers. This is optional, but recommended. PyZMQ will link against libzmq found on the system if it can, otherwise it will build libzmq itself as a Python extension.\n\n*pip, virtualenv: Shouldn't be needed, but used to workaround Ubuntu's bug that breaks python3 -m venv.\n\n\nI ran the above commands in a base ubuntu:14.04 docker container to verify that they are sufficient to successfully build pyzmq in a virtualenv.\n\nA: Finally, I considered installing iPython Notebook system-wide (outside a virtual environment). I had previously tried just install pyzmq system-wide but this wasn't enough.\nWhen I considered install iPython Notebook outside the virtual environment, I realized, \"How do I get pip to discriminate between Python 2.7 and Python 3.4?\" I went searching and found this excellent answer. In fact, it turns out my central problem was related to pip. I installed the pip corresponding to my Python 3 version:\nsudo apt-get install python3-setuptools\nsudo easy_install3 pip\n\nAnd after that, installing both pyzmq and ipython[notebook] worked perfectly inside my virtual environment:\npip3.4 install pyzmq\npip install ipython[notebook]\n\nI accidently used pip instead of pip3.4 for ipython[notebook] but it works anyway:\n(my-virtual-env)me@computer:~$ pip freeze\nJinja2==2.7.3\nMarkupSafe==0.23\ncertifi==14.05.14\nipython==2.3.1\npyzmq==14.4.1\ntornado==4.0.2\n\nHowever, using pip3.4 was necessary to get pyzmq installed in a Python 3 virtual environment.\n", "Q: Bash Script - Editing Lines on Text From File I'm using a bash script to read in data from a text file. \n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nfile=\"/home/nexusfactor/Desktop/inputData(linux).txt\"\nwhile IFS= read -r line\ndo\n        # display $line or do somthing with $line\n    echo \"$line\"\ndone <\"$file\"\n\nData:\n04:31 Alex M.O.R.P.H. & Natalie Gioia - My Heaven http://goo.gl/rMOa2q\n[ARMADA MUSIC]\n\n07:46 Fabio XB & Liuck feat.

It needs to match the format or it won't parse the line, so that sorts out your whitespace issue too.\n$ grep -Po '(?<=\\d\\d:\\d\\d ).*(?= http)' data\nAlex M.O.R.P.H. & Natalie Gioia - My Heaven\nFabio XB & Liuck feat.

There is no internet at the location. Group A devices are connected to WiFi router A and group B devices to WiFi router B (It is necessary that they should not be connected to the same router). I want the Ubuntu device to connect to both router A and router B and act as an intermediary between the two groups. The Ubuntu device should receive messages from Group A (through router A), process the information and send notification of the result to Group B (through router B) and vice versa.\nQuestions:\n\n*\n\n*How do I setup Ubuntu to connect to two networks simultaneously?\n\n*How do I identify which network a message is from and handle that message accordingly?\n\n*How do I specify the target network for my notification and send it to that network?\n\n\nA: For the first part, to connect to two networks at the same time I would set up static routes. Assuming that the networks are on different subnets, you're basically telling the system, \"If you need to connect to a machine with an address of 192.168.2.X, use eth0. If you need to connect to a machine with an address of 192.168.3.X, use eth1. And here is the gateway you should use.\"\nSo in /etc/network/interfaces add these lines (with your own network information of course):\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n      address 192.168.2.2\n      netmask 255.255.255.0\n      up route add -net 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.2.1\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n      address 192.168.3.2\n      netmask 255.255.255.0\n      up route add -net 192.168.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.3.1\n\nAs far as what logic is required for the system to identify and handle a message in a certain way, I believe that would rely on the certain software you are using to process the messages.\n", "Q: unmet dependencies after apt-get dist-upgrade 12.04 to 14.04.1 I can't fix the problem that happened when I have upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04.1 (apt-get dist-upgrade).

New versions I am user of LibreCAD and I haven't seen any new version of it since June last year. But the new versions continue to release. These versions are for Windows and Mac.

Here it is:\n\nFor Ubuntu we need to wait until it’s in PPA, usually that goes relative fast be we don’t fully control this process.\nFortunately, building on Ubuntu is relative painless.\n\nAnd\n\nHistorically we don’t provide Linux build and we leave that up to the distro’s to take care of building this.\nIf you want latest on Linux and you cannot wait for your disto to provide you a version then you need to compile this yourself.\nWe have this page : http://librecad.org/cms/home/from-source/linux.html which isn’t always up to date, but also take a look at the supplied readme.\n\nThe reason was that Linux was not their favorite operating system. But if you want to have the latest version of their program you can easily build it from sources. There is a manpage on their website. All the steps are well described.\nEverybody thank for help!\n", "Q: Upgrading packages through Terminal and knowing when a restart is then needed When I run the application Software Updater and I install some updates which need a restart of my computer, it tells me that I need to restart.\nBut when running this command in Terminal:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIt is not clear whether or not the packages which you have upgraded require a restart of the computer once they have finished upgrading.

But I am not sure how to move it to ~/bin. It usually just ends up \"disappearing\". \nHow might I move the script to that directory?\n\nA: The directory ~/bin\n~/bin is simply a folder named \"bin\" in your personal home directory. \n\"~\" stands for your home directory, so ~/bin is actually: /home/<yourname>/bin.\nYou probably still have to create the folder. You can do that just like you make any other folder, and move the executable into that folder (make sure the file is executable).\n$PATH\n~/bin is included in $PATH by default, which means that you can run executables inside the folder by a command that is simply equal to the name of the executable; you don't need to include the path to the script to run it.\nNote\nAfter you created ~/bin and added the script, you will probably have to log out and back in for it to work (or alternativeley, run source ~/.profile, as suggested by @muru, @Thomas W.)\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 package install fail (apt-get install error) I was trying to install some packages from a repository with this command:\ncontroller@controller:~$  sudo apt-get install nova-api nova-cert  nova-conductor nova-consoleauth nova-novncproxy nova-scheduler python-novaclient\n\nDuring the middle of installation, when it start to unpack them, like this:\nSelecting previously unselected package nova-common.\nPreparing to unpack .../nova-common_1%3a2014.1.3-0ubuntu2_all.deb ...\nUnpacking nova-common (1:2014.1.3-0ubuntu2) ...\n\nI restarted the system by accident.\nNow it seems some of the packages are broken, because it gives me these errors when I try to install with the apt-get install command again:\ncontroller@controller:~$  sudo apt-get install nova-api nova-cert  nova-conductor nova-consoleauth nova-novncproxy nova-scheduler python-novaclient\n[sudo] password for controller: \nReading package lists...

Also, I've added the user to the vboxusers group in Ubuntu.\nWhen I plug the drive in I see it listed in the USB devices list with a check mark in the Guest Ubuntu window, and it is not visible from the host OS. But I cannot find it mounted anywhere.\nThe most mystifying part of this exercise is that I tried to repeat exactly as I had done with a nearly identical setup, the one difference being laptop (problematic) versus desktop (works fine).  On the desktop each of the HDDs mount neatly in a folder called /media/<username>/\nI tried unchecking and rechecking both the the filter in the USB filter list, and device item in the devices list. Neither produced any surprising effect -- I could see the device get handed from one OS's USB list to the other and back.\nAt this point I shut down the VM and closed VirtualBox, and tried to start it all up again, when I then got this error: \nFailed to open a session for the virtual machine Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit.\n\nThe virtual machine 'Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit' has terminated unexpectedly during startup with exit code 1 (0x1).

To no avail.\nI've combed through various forums looking for similar occurrences, but cannot find anything that quite matches this problem -- most of the other issues are solved with creating the USB filters in VirtualBox, or adding the user to the vboxusers group in Ubuntu.\nAny advice? Is there some information missing here that I can dig up to shed more light on this situation? Thanks so much!\n\nA: Same problem. I solved it connecting the hard disk to a USB 2.0 port (my computer have both: USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 ports). Probably much slower data transfer but I can live with that.

These assets are 2 to 4 .tar.gz files containing binary data and closed-source library files. Their size is about 10 to 60 MB.\nIs it possible to include those .tar.gz files in the Charm in an 'assets' folder? The alternative is to let the Charm download them from a FTP/HTTP site (with a download location Charm configuration option). This however introduces extra dependencies and complexity. As some of the included libraries can only be downloaded when logged in on the vendor's website.\nWhat are approximate size limits for Juju Charms?\n\nA: There are no size limitations for a charm however if you're going to be modifying these assets it's sometimes easier to have them downloaded from an external source than modifying the charm.\n", "Q: Can I build on a shelf to store working copies of multiple websites As a side business I design and build websites for small businesses. I want to have a server on a shelf in my office to act as a development server. It would have working copies of all my clients websites. I could develop, test & edit there and then upload to their real locations when I am done. Is this possible without being a Ubuntu Guru? My intent is not necessarily to serve pages outside my house although that would be a nice feature. I hate how clunky windows IIS is to move the pointer to a different folder when I move between clients. \nThank you.\n\nA: \nIs this possible without being a Ubuntu Guru? \n\nYes. Ubuntu in this is just the OS hosting the tools you need. The initial setup for apache and your network might be a bit difficult the 1st time. But nothing a bit of googling or searching on AU can not fix. \nYou need (and probably know this but just in case) ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache config to host the websites. A setup with virtual hosts. It is probably a copy of the virtual hosts of the live system. Pretty basic if you are already into Apache.\n\n*something (like ssh/scp/rcp) to copy software over. We tend to use rcp to remote copy software between systems.\n\n*Probably MySQL for the data. You can use the my.cnf from the live system to set up your test system. Replication is a nifty feature: if you replicate your live data to your test system (live as master, test as slave) you can test your system on a copy of the live data. Example as we use it: live is master, slave #1 is used to do the heavy sql queries on and slave #2 is a backup in case the master is unreachable. And from slave #2 we also create the daily backup (so the active live system is not burdened with it). \nBesides that you can also use workbench to copy over complete databases from live to your test system. This is nothing fancy. \n\nA: First of all, This is possible to do:\n1. Download Nginx or Apache (I use Nginx so the configuration below is for Nginx):\nsudo apt-get install nginx\nyou might need to install php5, mysql etc when you configuring nginx, here is the dependence you need \nsudo apt-get install php5 php5-cli php5-cgi spawn-fcgi php5-mysql php5-mcrypt php5-curl php5-gd php5-fpm openssl mysql-server\n\n2.Configure Nginx \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Nginx directory and delete unnecessary files\n\n\ncd /etc/nginx/\nrm sites-available/default\nrm sites-enabled/default\n\n\n*Configure for Website\n\n\ncd /etc/nginx/conf.d\ntouch website-name.conf\n\n\n*open .conf file you just created and paste the configures  below \n\n\nnano /etc/nginx/conf.d/website-name.conf\n server {\n\n    listen [::]:80; #ipv6only=on; ######STEP1#####\n    server_name www.whateveryoulike.com;  #####STEP2####\n    root /path/to/file; ######STEP3#####\n\n\n    index index.html index.php;\n    location / {\n        try_files $uri $uri/ @handler; \n    }\n    location @handler {\n        rewrite / /index.php;\n    }\n\n    location ~ .php/ {\n        rewrite ^(.*.php)/ $1 last;\n    }\n\n\n    location ~ \\.php$ {\n        #try_files $uri $uri/;\n    fastcgi_index index.php;\n        expires off;\n    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;\n    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock; ######STEP4#####\n    include fastcgi_params;\n    }\n    #include /etc/nginx/fastcgi.conf;\n\n} \n\nStep 1: this is port that your website is bind on\nStep 2: this is where your server name is written (you can have a server name whatever you like)\nStep 3: this is where your root directory is written (it must be same as your git clone location)\nStep 4: this is where the php5-fpm directory is written (nothing has to change but leave it for future use such as zend server )\nFor Version Control\nUse Github or Bitbucket if you enjoy privacy.\nI personally use Bitbucket, the process is simple as 1 2 3 4\n1. Push your Live site files as master\n\n\n*pull the code to your pc (this is the file location for nginx)\n\n*edit , delete , add files to the local version( staging, etc )\n\n*when you done push it to bitbucket, and pull it back in live site's shell. \nFinally , Relax and You're Welcome\n", "Q: How to remove Chrome OS Desktop Environment? I tried to install Chrome OS Desktop Environment but it didn't worked from some reason. I was prompted with a message saying that there is some error, so how can I remove the installed components?\n\nA: Removing installed components after incomplete installation of Chrome OS Desktop Environment can be done by using Synaptic Package Manager.

I read in this answer that to set the configuration to suspend we need to type:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power critical-battery-action 'suspend'\n\nHowever I want just to turn off the screen. The reason is that I believe the battery meter is broken, but the battery has power to last about one hour.\nMeanwhile I'll simply disable any action when the battery is critically low typing:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power critical-battery-action 'nothing'\n\n\nA: Just leave the gsettings on nothing and use the System Settings - Brightness and lock - \"dim screen to save power\" (use max 80%) and in the same screen \"Turn screen off when inactive for 10 minutes\". \nThe other way is to interfere in the suspend script, but if all you want is to turn off the monitor, the above is a much simpler solution.\n", "Q: Deactivate Caps Lock in 14.04 I really don't need Caps Lock (who does?) and would rather have it as a Shift key as I sometimes hit it by mistake especially on the small netbook keyboard.\nSince I don't read while I type this might mean I have to retype half a page. I only find solutions for Ubuntu 12.04 but they don't work for 14.04 (Somehow the \"typing\" dialog looks totally different, not as user friendly).\nI've tried anyway and clicked on + to make a custom shortcut.

I have been having a problem, whenever I try to shutdown, suspend or restart Ubuntu or Gnome 3, the shut-down screen just freezes, and it didn't shut down.\nThe question is how to find a cause and how to fix?\n\nA: The answer for this one was: \nAfter I have clicked on a button shutdown and the log-out screen has shown, I pressed the esc key and I could see the error text messages, and I have found the message:\n\nWaiting for Redis to shutdown ...\n\nAfter finding out what script is used to shutdown Redis, I have found out it is: \n/etc/init.d/redis_6379\n\nWhen I tried manually to shutdown manually from console running a command: \nsudo /etc/init.d/redis_6379 stop\n\nI got the same error message. I was one step closer to the solution.\nEven though maybe the solution was not as perfect as it could be, but I managed to solve my problem. I have edited the file:\nsudo gedit /etc/init.d/redis_6379\n\nAnd found the:\necho \"Waiting for Redis to shutdown ...\"\n\nEdited the surrounding code (commented out some lines and added one other command to shutdown the Redis server)\n/etc/init.d/redis-server stop\n#while [ -x /proc/${PID} ]\n#do\n  echo \"Waiting for Redis to shutdown ...\"\n  #sleep 1\n#done\n\nAnd whola!

Many thanks in advance!\n\nA: Restarting Network Manager Service\nThis is pretty self explanatory workaround, I suppose. In terminal do\nsudo service network-manager restart;\n Alternatively, try sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\nAltering module settings\nCommon solution that works for many cases is altering your module ( aka driver ) settings. \nIn your instance, you have rtl8723be module for RTL8723BE PCIe card ( which is under lspci in your pastebin output ). Use modinfo rtl8723be what parameters there are for this driver, and you should find ips, fwlps, msi. \nNow, you could either alter these parameters using modprobe  command as shown here , or you could permanently change settings by creating a rtl8723be.conf file in /etc/modprobe.d folder. For instane, in command line do sudo gedit /etc/modbrobe.d/rtl8723be.conf , enter your password, and add something like this to the file:\noptions rtl8192se fwlps=0 ips=0 swenc=1\n\nSave, close, reboot.\nSide notes:  1) gedit is a graphical text editor. There are plenty of command line editors. I personally prefer nano or vim. 2) I've never personally changed parameters during runtime with modprobe as in the link, so I do not know if it should or not work during runtime. 3) there is a way of viewing the module parameters during run time with systool -v -m modnamehere , which is part of sysfsutils package; you can install that with sudo apt-get install sysfsutils.\nReinserting module\nAnother common workaround is reinserting the module at runtime. For instance, with rtl8192se wifi card , my connection would drop, indicator would say I'm disconnected, and when I'd select my wifi to reconnect, it would just hang there \"configuring\" until the connection timed out. Reinserting the module helped 90 % of the time. I've put all commands into a script:\n# !/bin/bash\n# Description: Simple script to reload r8192e_pci module for wireless card\n# refer to  https://askubuntu.com/questions/286380/wireless-card-problem-rtl8192se-autodisconnects-after-a-few-minutes-in-13-04\necho deloading wifi module...\nsudo rmmod -v r8192e_pci\necho reloading wifi module...\nsudo modprobe -v r8192e_pci\n\nYou can replace the r8192e_pci with your rtl8723be, save in a file, for instance mod-reload.sh , change permissions with chmod +x mod-reload.sh , and then execute it with ./mod-reload.sh . See if that helps.\nAltering kernel parameters\nIn addition to my dropping connection that I've experienced with rtl8192se, I've also had interesting sound glitch/stutter in every audio-producing program, from firefox to smplayer. What helped alleviate the issue somewhat was changing the kernel boot parameters. \nNamely, here's what I've changed in /etc/default/grub file:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash noapictimer clocksource=jiffies\"\n\nAgain, you can edit that part in grub file with sudo gedit /etc/default/grub command\nSide note: depending on your hardware you might use different kernel parameter there. Refer here for more explanation and here for parameters.\nCheck the connections\nOften we forget that network cards are actually hardware, and sometimes fiddling with options isn't going to solve a physical problem. If you can easily access the network card \"under the hood\", check if the two antenna  wires that go to it are connected nice and tight, maybe try swapping wires in places.\nUpgrade to newer kernel\nModules come with kernels, and with each new release they may get improved. Check out this article on upgrading to kernel 3.18.2. \nGet different hardware ?\nBad hardware may be just bad, and no amount of fiddling with it will help. Look up ubuntu recommended network cards, and maybe get one of those. Personally, I went back to my good old RTL8187SE, which is actually recommended, and put aside \n\nA: This command worked for me:\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\n\nI changed the line:\n`*options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1*` \n\ninto \n*options iwlwifi 11n_disable=0*\n\nnot really clear to me what I did :) but it worked!\n", "Q: Qt can't find GL/gl.h but libGL.so exists I am running 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04. \nThe compile error I am getting is:\nIn file included from ../../../Qt/5.4/gcc_64/include/QtOpenGL/qgl.h:39:0,\n                 from ../../../Qt/5.4/gcc_64/include/QtOpenGL/qglshaderprogram.h:37,\n                 from ../../../Qt/5.4/gcc_64/include/QtOpenGL/QGLShaderProgram:1,\n                 from glwidget.h:5,\n                 from glwidget.cpp:1:\n../../../Qt/5.4/gcc_64/include/QtGui/qopengl.h:122:21: fatal error: GL/gl.h: No such file or directory\n #  include <GL/gl.h>\n                     ^\n\nStrangely enough, I seem to have libGL.so properly installed and symlinked to the OpenGL libraries installed by my Nvidia 343 display driver (which I presume also installs OpenGL drivers).\n$ ls -l /usr/lib | grep -i libgl\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root           17 Jan 15 12:47 libGLESv1_CM.so -> libGLESv1_CM.so.1\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root           22 Jan 15 12:47 libGLESv1_CM.so.1 -> libGLESv1_CM.so.343.36\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root        48248 Jan 15 12:47 libGLESv1_CM.so.343.36\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root           14 Jan 15 12:47 libGLESv2.so -> libGLESv2.so.2\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root           19 Jan 15 12:47 libGLESv2.so.2 -> libGLESv2.so.343.36\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root        62352 Jan 15 12:47 libGLESv2.so.343.36\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root          654 Jan 15 12:47 libGL.la\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root           10 Jan 15 12:47 libGL.so -> libGL.so.1\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root           15 Jan 15 12:47 libGL.so.1 -> libGL.so.343.36\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root      1274520 Jan 15 12:47 libGL.so.343.36\n\nI've seen some previous posts that suggest doing \nsudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev\n\nbut when I tried that, it downgraded my supported OpenGL version (as outputted by glxinfo) to v1.4.

Most Linux distributions do not install all of these by default, but setting up a development environment is still straightforward.\nUse the following commands to install the basic requirements for building Qt applications:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev\n\n\nA: Ah, as @steeldriver points out, headers and libraries are different things, and doing the following fixed the issue:\nsudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev\n\nThis installs the required headers.\n", "Q: How to forward internet from mobile modem into router I had problem after I bought huawei E3372, because I tried to connect it with my openWRT based router and openWRT didn't support it in standard. I tried to install vendor drivers but on my primitive router there wasn't enough space to install them. So I was thinking about scenario to forward internet from my laptop by eth0 interface to my router (to connect openWRT to internet and made operation in internet (share file, mount file disc etc) On My Laptop modem works and I have internet access\nSo my question is how to achieve this connection:\n MobileModeb(USB saw as wired connection) -> Laptop ->(ethernet cable) -> Linux Router\n\nIs this bridge or IP forwarding? Or something different?\nI'm sorry but I am noob in internet administration issues.\n\nA: It's IP forwarding, you can implement that with a couple of commands:\nIn the file /etc/sysctl.conf, add or uncomment the following line using your preferred text editor (vim, gedit, etc):\n\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\n\nTo enable the changes in sysctl.conf you need to run the command:\n\nsudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nYou may also want to configure IPTables with the commands:\n\nsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE\nsudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -m state -–state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -j ACCEPT\n\nSubstitute eth1 by your internet interface (the modem, as called in your system) and substitute eth0 by the interface connected to the router (probably it's really eth0).\nTo make it permanent, run:\n\nsudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules\n\nTry that and report back any problems.\n", "Q: Missing readline library when using make I'm trying to compile ncmpcpp, and when I get to issuing the make command I get several errors such as:\n/home/[myname]/ncmpcpp/src/window.cpp:329: undefined reference to `rl_bind_key'\n/home/[myname]/ncmpcpp/src/window.cpp:144: undefined reference to `rl_point'\n/home/[myname]/ncmpcpp/src/window.cpp:729: undefined reference to `readline'\n\nAnd so on. It seems the problem is with the readline libraries and the libreadline-dev package, but I have already installed it from the official repos and I have the file /usr/include/readline/readline.h, which ncmpcpp includes in \"window.cpp\", so I don't really understand what's happening here.\n\nA: Did you run ./autogen.sh as described by the manual?\n\nA: Makefile is (probably) broken, it seems to not link readline.

By default, the Nouveau drivers are loaded (no hardware found in Additional Drivers). I have tried installing xorg-video-intel, nvidia-304, nvidia-330, nvidia-340, nvidia-346 after blacklisting Nouveau in the grub configuration with no luck. I also installed the driver manually from the Nvidia website. This issue persists on Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10.\nThe driver never gets loaded properly. /var/log/X.log.0 indicates that No device was detected after loading the driver. Prior to creating /etc/X11/xorg.conf with nvidia-xconfig, the default resolution is 4K which is very difficult to use without increasing the DPI and font which causes visual defects in many programs. I would prefer to use 2048x1152 or 1920x1080 by default. Only one resolution is available (3840 x 2160) which is listed at 0.0 Hz for some reason and xrandr is unable to add new resolutions.\nI would be content disabling the Nvidia driver entirely or using Nouveau if I could just change the resolution. With no xorg.conf configuration in, (with or without Nvidia driver installed) video playback will work smoothly for a few minutes beforing crashing the X server (and Ctrl+Alt+Fn key no longer respond; the only option I found is to reset power).\nOnce xorg.conf is generated by nvidia-xconfig, the only resolutions available are 800x600 and 640x480. nvidia-settings indicates the driver is not loaded and xrandr is still unable to create new resolutions. Could there be a configuration conflict with the Intel driver?\n\nA: I finally got the nvidia driver and screen resolution working with the latest nvidia 346.47 driver from the x-edgers PPA. \nIt is essential to remove nomodeset from the grub configuration file /etc/default/grub. Then run\nsudo update-grub\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-346-dev bumblebee-nvidia\nsudo shutdown -r 0\n\nThen xrandr will work correctly (and so does the settings GUI for screen resolution). \nI am still having problems with \"primusrun\", however nvidia-settings has an option to select the GPU you want to use so I am not sure if bumblebee is even needed. glxgears will now run at ~2000FPS in 4K!\n\nA: There is no direct support for nVidia optimus for linux. nVidia Optimus dynamically switches between the integrated GPU and discreet GPU inorder to improve battery life. However there could be work around, check this link\nHow to set up nVidia Optimus/Bumblebee in 14.04\n\nA: Update: later versions of Ubuntu such as 16.10 resolved these graphics installations issues for Nvidia 970M / Intel 4600HD by using the automated restricted hardware drivers GUI installer.

It is very important to me to render the formatting as accurately as possible. I successfully installed Office 2010 on Xubuntu 14.04, but there is an issue where I can’t open a document. I can only open a new blank document. So, I have given up there. I then proceeded to search for the most accurate rendering tool for Word to PDF.

My hard drive was partitioned multiple times, (The main, local C:\\ drive, \"HP TOOLS\" and \"RECOVERY\" and the System Reserved partition. I also had some weird listing that said it was only a megabyte. I deleted it. HP had set these partitions up. (This is a laptop, not a custom made PC.) I realized since the limit for partitions is 4, I was getting the \"unusable\" error because I couldn't have more than four partitions. I wanted to have one for \"/home\", one for \"/\", and one for \"swap\" or \"swap area\". I transferred over the HP TOOLS files to the main C:\\ drive. I stupidly did not copy the recovery over, I just deleted it. So then I deleted the partitions made by HP, and put the partitions back into the main drive, as to be able to create more for Ubuntu. So FINALLY, after hours of work, (and no backups, because I'm an idiot,) I was able to create partitions for \"/\" and \"swap\" But not a separate partition for \"/home\" because the system reserved partition and main C:\\ took up two out of four partitions already.

From what I've read, I need to make some changes to /etc/default/grub and use sudo grub-set-default when I want to boot to Windows.\nI think those changes start with adding this to /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=saved\nGRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=false\n\nAnytime changes are made to /etc/default/grub I know that I need to then run\nsudo update-grub and which results in:\nGenerating grub configuration file ...\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-43-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-43-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-32-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-32-generic\nFound memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.elf\nFound memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.bin\nFound Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda1\ndone\n\nSince Windows is the 7th option in that list I believe I would run sudo grub-set-default 6 (0 based counting) - is this correct and is there a different method to get a numbered list of boot choices after the system is already booted?\nAlso, are the lines in /etc/default/grub sufficient to achieve this behavior or do I need to add additional configuration?\n\nA: You need to make sure you have GRUB_DEFAULT=saved in your grub config (which is autogenerated, you change this part of it by editing /etc/default/grub). sudo update-grub to make the changes active and then use sudo grub-reboot $1.\ngrep -i \"menuentry '\" /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nWill give you the menuentries that you can cut-paste in for $1.

What are the best settings when converting, say, a .mp4 video to WebM?\nI have done some searching on here but nothing specific to what I need really. \nWhat I've been using:\navconv -i input.mp4 \\\n       -c:v libvpx -qmin 10 -qmax 42 -maxrate 500k -bufsize 1000k -threads 2 \\\n       -c:a libvorbis output.webm\n\nHowever this seems to have issues. I can not upload/embed it on sites that support WebM and if I get it to it sometimes will not have any video, just audio. I have also tried without the qmin, qmax, maxrate and bufsize options or a combination of them. I have also tried using AviDemux with the same issue. Says I can't upload it on certain sites or ones I can it will have playback issues.\nI'm not great with video codecs and converting so sorry if I'm just missing something really obvious. Any advice would help. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Actually, I think I can answer my own question after spending some time reading around and messing with the avconv command myself. I found that these settings seem to work perfect for what I need: \navconv -i input.mp4 \\\n       -c:v libvpx -qmin 20 -qmax 30 -ss 00:00:30 -t 00:01:00 -threads 2 \\\n       -c:a libvorbis \\\n       output.webm \n\nI realized that it was easier to just split the video using the command line also. The -ss hh:mm:ss splits the video starting at that point and -t indicates the time it records after.\nThe -an option will also drop the audio for uploading your WebM video to boards like 8chan, 7chan, 4chan, etc.\nThe -s option will \"downsample\" and use a new resolution for the video size. Such as -s 640x480, for example.\nSo in conclusion, if you were trying to convert part of a video (using all of the mentioned options) 1 minute in, for 30 seconds after that point, while scaling the resolution down and dropping audio, it would look like this:\navconv -i MyFavoriteMovie.mp4 \\\n       -c:v libvpx -qmin 20 -qmax 30 -ss 00:01:00 -t 00:00:30 -s 640x480 -an -threads 2 \\\n       -c:a libvorbis \\\n       output.webm\n\nJust to give an example. This would create a 30 second clip with the given resolution.\nHope this helps other avconv beginners as well.\n", "Q: How do I re-enable disabled network notifications (never show again) in Unity?

So it seems that the project is quite abandoned --- or moved to another place. \n", "Q: Firefox 35.0 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS sets a cookie to google.com even without calling any web location I have updated my Ubuntu 14.04 recently and got a new firefox (version 35.0). I have configured an empty starting page and my default search engine is configured to duckduckgo.\nbut: Since the update I get a google.com cookie called \"PREF\". When I remove that cookie, close firefox, and open firefox again, the cookie is back again.\nWhere does this cookie come from? How can I avoid that this cookie is set?\nEDIT:\nI did a small experiment: When I cut the network connection during the launch of Firefox, no Google cookie is set. So the real question is: Why is Firefox 35.0 contacting Google when I don't ask it to do so?\n\nA: There  are two ways to avoid this cookie to be set:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Security tab of Firefox's Preferences uncheck \"Block reported attack sites\" and \"Block reported web forgeries\".\n\n\nIf one of these two options is activated, Firefox contacts Google to load lists of websites, which should be blocked and this cookie is set.\nIf you still want to use these options, but instead blocking only that cookie, there is the second method:\n\n\n*Go to the Privacy tab and change History settings in the drop down menu to \"Use custom settings for history\", then some options show up. See the option \"Accept cookies from sites\" and to the right side of that option the button \"Exceptions...\" - click it and a new dialog box appears. Enter \"google.com\" into the text area labeled \"Address of website:\" and click the button \"Block\" under that text area.\n\n\nFor me, both ways prevented the cookie to being set again.\n", "Q: apt-get update starts 'by itself' and never stops running I noticed my laptop becomes really slow from time to time. I think, but I'm not 100% sure, that this only happens after i plug the power in, and it started happening several days ago. Then I also noticed the disk led showing constant disk activity, and ran iotop to see what processes are using the disk. It showed something like:\napt-get -qq -y update\n\nusing between 98% and 99.99% of IO (all of it under disk write, zero under disk read, all the time).\nI waited for several minutes to see when it will stop and it never did (when I run it, it usually takes about 20-30s to complete). Why is this happening? Can I find out what triggered apt-get update?\n\nA: The command updates your package list, while the modifiers -qq means \"very quiet\", so there is no output and -y means it automatically answers all questions with yes. Maybe you would like to change your settings for automatic search for updates which could possibly start a command like this. Maybe there is also an error with your package sources which make it run in infinite loops. Try executing the command in a terminal without the quiet-option (-qq) and see how it performs. But normally you have to use sudo to run apt-get with root privileges. Is the process you found in your question running as root or as you (normal user)?\n", "Q: Error Messages When Booting Up These signs show up when booting Ubuntu 14.04. Just right before Ubuntu logo shows up.\nHere's the error prompts:\n\nWhat do these mean?\n\nA: Try removing your SD, as these errors are talking about your second drive. If you only have one built in hdd, it probably is your SD-card Ubuntu can not properly access. I would think it might be formatted in a strange file system or has physical errors.\n", "Q: Problem with executing .py script I am a complete newbie in terms of using Ubuntu and I have stumbled upon this problem: I am trying to run this script: https://gist.github.com/mjkoo/0eb70888b6085b3f65f5 (it's basically a tool that renames all files into lowercase). I've tried using:\npython eui_install.py\n\nand\nchmod +x eui_install.py\n./eui_install.py\n\nbut everything I get back is:\nUsage: eui_install.py [ZIPFILE]\n\nThe files in the designated folder still have names with uppercase. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: You are forgetting to supply a mandatory argument.\n Usage: eui_install.py [ZIPFILE]\n\nmeans you have to include a name of a zipfile. The command is:\npython eui_install.py zipfile\n\nwhere zipfile is a file name you need to supply (probably the mod you want to edit looking at the script).\n\nThe files in the designated folder still have names with uppercase. What am I doing wrong?\n\nThose files are what you need to add to the command (ie. 2nd argument is 1 zipped file).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 APT Proxy? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 on a password-protected proxy network. My web browser is configured and works, but I cannot install packages from apt or similar. Is there a way to configure apt to use my proxy? Is there a way to configure my entire system to use my proxy?\n\nA: You can set proxy in System Settings --> Network --> Network Proxy. \nIf it still not OK for apt, you can use several methods, I personally use method adding\nthe following lines to /etc/apt/apt.conf:\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://username:password@proxyserver:port/\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"http://username:password@proxyserver:port/\";\n\nSave and reboot\n", "Q: dig to www got no answer with bind I'm trying to set up a domain.

In summary, either your local configuration might be wrong, or you might be configuring the wrong machine alltogether\nConfig file wrong?\nI can't test this right now, but in your db.vumila.com you have www.vumila.com., why not just www?\nWrong machine?\nWhere are you changing the bind configuration? Is that server actually the responsible DNS server for the domain? It looks like ns1.launchpad.com would hold the www.vumila.com entry, that is probably not your server, right? \n\nA: (Perhaps ironically) a domain file isn't supposed to contain the domain name. You set that higher up. A domain file will just have something like:\n@          A      <IP address>\n\n@ is a wildcard for all (and no) subdomain so covers www.domain.ext and domain.ext\n\nThat said, there are few good reasons for hosting your own DNS. It's a target for hacking and DDoS reflection attacks so let somebody else do it. They'll do a better job and most have a webui to let you do it through your browser (rather than fighting an ancient crufty syntax). Places to look:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your registrar almost certainly has a good, massively redundant DNS infrastructure.\n\n*Your web host probably has one too.\n\n*And there are plenty of free (and paid) DNS services (eg ZoneEdit) out there too.\n\n", "Q: How can I simultaneously play Spotify audio through my headphone-out while VLC plays audio through HDMI?

They appear on the list and I could access them without a problem a couple of months ago, but now I get a dialogue box with Unable to access location - failed to mount Windows share: Invalid argument message, with only the option to click OK.\nThese folders are readily accessible now from other Win 7 and 8 PCs on the network, but the same Invalid argument error now appears on the only other Linux box on the network which runs Mint Cinnamon.\nMy question is which argument is in invalid and how can I validate it?\n\nA: edit /etc/samba/smb.conf\nand  Disable SMBv1 and use SMBv2 works for me\nlike min protocol = SMB2\n\nA: I resolved this by using the IP address instead of the server name.\n\nA: This sounds like a regression. An Ubuntu bug report and upstream bug report has already been made for it. It might be best to set yourself as \"affected\" and ask what information is needed. also clearly state that this is a regression. Regressions get fixed faster.\nWorkaround #1\nYou can try manually opening the share with nautilus (the file manager)\nnautilus smb://ServernameOrIp\n\nWorkaround #2\nYou can try mounting it with smbclient. Example:\nsmbclient –L geekmini –U geek\n\nWhere geekmini is pc and geek is username.\nCreate mountpoint:\nsudo mkdir /media/Video\n\nActually mounting the drive:\nmount –t cifs –o username=geek,password=thepass //geekmini/root /media/Video\n\nGood luck and let me know what works!\n\nA: My samba share has started to produce this same error after the group the shared directory had, and was shared to, has been erroneously deleted. \nIt got back to work OK after the situation with the disappeared group was resolved.\nOne could resolve it giving the share another group in the smb.conf file, but I just recreated it on the system level.\nHope this will help.\n\nA: Same issues here -- although I found out that in win 8.1 introduced STORAGE SPACES into windows, allowing the clustering of hard drives into combined resources -- I have 8 drives of 4tb functioning as a single 32TB drive array.\nI got mine to work by adding the option -o vers=3.0 to my mount command and that solved my invalid argument error.\nHope that helps your situation.\n\nA: Try restart windows...

Is there any way to enable the pasting of text in these applications? \n\nIn the meantime, I have always just used the browser instead.\n\nA: The inability to paste a password is probably meant as a safety measure.

Both systems running PopOS 20.10.\nThe odd thing is that although the printer had been working fine from the new system after I'd added it, it suddenly vanished, a week or two later.  (I'd had a few LAN dropouts, so that may have triggered it.)\nBut when trying to add the printer back (via the system printer config tool), with the network address ipp://<$OLDCOMPUTER>:631/printers/lp, there was no suitable Brother driver for the model.\nI did have a .deb though for the printer on the old computer, so I installed that, like so:\n# dpkg -i ~luke/linux/downloads/hl3150cdncupswrapper-1.1.2-1a.i386.deb\nSelecting previously unselected package hl3150cdncupswrapper:i386.\n(Reading database ... 476445 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack .../hl3150cdncupswrapper-1.1.2-1a.i386.deb ...\nUnpacking hl3150cdncupswrapper:i386 (1.1.2-1) ...\nSetting up hl3150cdncupswrapper:i386 (1.1.2-1) ...\nERROR : Brother LPD filter is not installed.\nRestarting cups (via systemctl): cups.service.\nlpadmin -p HL3150CDN -E -v usb:/dev/usb/lp0 -P /usr/share/cups/model/Brother/brother_hl3150cdn_printer_en.ppd\nlpadmin: Printer drivers are deprecated and will stop working in a future version of CUPS.\n\nAnd then HL-3150CDN model appeared in the list of available Brothers, and I was able to add the printer and it appeared that I could print to it, with no error messages. But that was incorrect, and quite spurious: print jobs simply vanished.\nChecking the printer, it was on but said it was in Deep sleep mode. I had to unplug the power cord and plug it back in to wake it up.\nAfter that, the (old) printer settings reappeared.  Choosing that printer, all worked well. (The printer setting was  \"implicitclass://Brother_HL_3150CDN_series/\")\nSo I deleted the freshly-added printers that didn't actually print, and carried on.\nLike I said - weird.\n\nA: I had an issue with a canon pixma 6800 in Linux Mint Tricia 19.3. It would not add in going through the add printers in your start menu. You have to add it directly into CUPS going to localhost:631 in your web browser and add it in there. I did it that way and it now works perfectly. So happy because I no longer need to go to the windows machine to use the canon. \n", "Q: Infinite loading loop Linux Ubuntu 14.04 This is my third day on Linux Ubuntu and so far it has been a different expirence but a good one.Anyways, I am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my computer and I am having a problem getting to the login screen.When ever I boot up on Linux ubuntu I am stuck on a never ending Ubuntu loading screen before I can login.does anybody know how to fix this ?\n\nA: If you have the choice to boot into recover mode, take that choice, you could try to get to\na none gui login screen and try to start the X server from command line if that doens't work\n/var/log/ will be your friend :D access the logs from recover mode, or if you dont get to the recover mode, any live CD will do the job.\nOr if you just installed Ubuntu try to reinstall it.\nBecause without more information like Logs its hard to say where the mistake could \nbe.\n", "Q: What is the difference between pip and conda? \n*\n\n*I know pip is a package manager for python packages. However, I saw the installation on iPython's website use conda to install iPython.\n\n*Can I use pip to install iPython? Why should I use conda as another python package manager when I already have pip?\n\n*And what is the difference between pip and conda?\n\n\nA: conda is a package management tool for installing scientific and analytical computing packages, which may be written in Python or other programming languages. conda also creates a virtual environment, like python-virtualenv does. conda is the package manager of Anaconda. Anaconda is a free Python distribution provided by Continuum Analytics, which includes over 195 of the most popular Python packages for science, math, engineering and data analysis, almost all of which are also available in the default Ubuntu repositories. Anaconda is known for making a big mess out of the default paths for many Python modules in Linux. For these reasons I don't recommend Anaconda for new Linux users.\npip is a general purpose Python package installer. In addition, python-pip and python3-pip are in the default Ubuntu repositories. In most cases you would choose pip instead of conda if you want to install a Python package management application. To create a Python virtual environment without installing conda, you can install python-virtualenv from the Ubuntu Software Center.\npip and conda use different packaging formats so they do not operate interchangeably, but you can use both tools side by side.\n\nA: Conda is a Python Package Manager.  One of the advantages of using Conda is it can create and manage multiple environments having different versions of Python installed.  (I don't know if pip can do that.) \n", "Q: How to find my Ambari server URL How do I find my Ambari server hostname?\nhttps://ambari.apache.org/1.2.1/installing-hadoop-using-ambari/content/ambari-chap3-1.html\n\nA: The main.install.hostname in the documentation was a placeholder referring to the machine's hostname where ambari is installed and in my case it is localhost\nI had to point my browser to http://localhost:8080 and it worked\n", "Q: Ethernet lights not on when cable connected and connection not working I have two OSs and the Ethernet lights on my computer don't turn on when the cable connected and I cannot connect to the internet.

If otherwise unspecified, all partitions were primary.\nDevice for installing Ubuntu was the entire hard disk.\nI had to specify that at boot up that the EFI was to be turned off. \nI could login normally after that. I then turned on the options for automatically mount for each of the 100gb hard disk partitions. I restarted my laptop after that and now I am unable to login. \nPlease help!\n\nA: I had a similar problem in another distro based on ubuntu (elementaty OS).

The hot corner works if my built in display is set to the left, or below the second monitor.\n\nIf the built in display is set to the right of the second monitor the hot corner does not work.\n\n\nA: You resolve this issue be making sure the hot corner is accessible by your mouse in the viewport.\nvia comment from Jacob Vlijm,\n\nfor Unity (Compiz), your screens together make one viewport/desktop. In your second setup, the right side of the left screen is just (a bit further than) half way of your desktop, as seen by Unity.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation instead of Windows 7 I am  an Ubuntu newbie user. I used Ubuntu on a virtual machine and I liked it very much. Now I want to install it instead of Windows 7 on ''C'' drive.\nWill that format my other drives too?\n\nA: I believe the answer is: yes, it will unless you tell it not to. \nChecking \"Replace Windows with Ubuntu\" will erase all Windows partitions. If you want to keep those (ie. D:, E:) except C: choose \"manual\" and remove C: yourself and then pick the unallocated space.\nWe expect you to create a backup of your important documents (at the least those documents you can not re-download) before you start messing with partitions. A mistake is made very quickly and misreading the installer options during partitioning will kill your data. \n", "Q: Unable to install Ubuntu? I downloaded Ubuntu 14 LTS iso.

I have a second hard disc fitted,  a 1Tb standard disk that I use for data and backups (separate partitions).\nThere are just two users, myself as administrator and my wife as a custom user. I log on with a password, my wife with none. \nWe are both members of the group \"dad\" which has Read Write permissions to the shared data partition, the owner of which is me. \nI can access the disk freely, whereas when logged on as my wife I cannot? It shows in Nautilus but returns \"You do not have permissions to access\" or similar.\nIn Ubuntu 8,9 10 & 12 all this worked easily, but suddenly doing what I'd always done to enable shared access is not working. What do I need to do in Ubuntu 14.04 to enable this simple activity?\n\nA: Thanks for response:-\nDisk is mounted as /media/dad/Data which is /dev/sdb6\nI tried the chgrp & chmod commands you suggested, logged out & logged in as my wife then tried to access \"Data\" - which shows up on her Unity launcher panel. It required the superuser password, which I entered , then access was available. \nHowever, when I then logged back in as me access was denied!\nIf I unmount it logged in as my wife , I can then access it logged in as me, so it seems accessible only to the first to mount the drive.\nWhen I upgraded, I disconnected the 1 Tb HDD & booted from a 14.04 USB stick I had created from the ISO file. I opted to use all the SDD for installation & everything went well. Trusty installed & updated etc etc. Then I shut down, reconnected the HDD & everything looked fine – the partitions on the HDD appeared to me, access to them was allowed. Created a second user for my wife & then found no access to the HDD for her & I'm still stuck!\nThe HDD is partitioned into three – firstly a partition sdb1 with Trusty installed (which doesn't feature as part of the grub for the SDD as it was disconnected on installation to SDD). I can boot up to this if necessary using my PC's Winfast bootup menu. Secondly it has the Data partition as sdb6, a backup partition as sdb3 it also has a swap partition sdb5.\nPreviously I've had no problems e.g. for a couple of years with Precise, everything was working fine, even my shared folders were available on our home network to the daughter's windows laptop (home network is another problem area, but that's for another post!), data disk was freely available to both wife & me etc.\n\nA: Assuming your disk is mounted as /media/user/disk.\nAnd that is according fdisk /dev/sdb\nAnd your partition is /dev/sdb1\nTest this:\nOpen a terminal, Press Ctrl+Alt+T\nRun it:\nsudo -i\numount /dev/sdb1\nchgrp -Rf dad /media/user/disk\nchmod -Rf 777 /media/user/disk\n\n\nA: None of the suggestions I found searching on here, all along the lines of changing ownership & permissions worked.\nWhat I did was to make another directory in /media for Data i.e.\n/media/Data   (instead of /media/dad/Data)\nThen I made an entry in fstab to mount the UUID of the relevant disk to /media/Data\nlogged out & hey presto!

Perhaps the new .bashrc is sourcing other files, so you should examine .bashrc.bak to see what changes happened.\n\nA: The prompt is set by using the PS1 variable. This can be defined in several places depending on your setup. If the new prompt is specific to your user, you can run the following command to check which file it is defined in:\ngrep -H PS1 ~/.bashrc ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile ~/bash.login\n\nIf that returns nothing, broaden the search (some of these files shouldn't be relevant but these are all the files that can be read by default bash so you may as well include even unlikely culprits such as ~/.bash_aliases):\ngrep -H PS1 ~/.bashrc ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile ~/bash.login ~/.bash_aliases \\\n    /etc/bash.bashrc /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/* /etc/environment 2>/dev/null\n\nOnce you have identified the file, open it in a text editor and set your PS1 to whatever you like. \n", "Q: 14.04 server glib critcal: source id x Console keeps giving me this error \nglib critcal: source id x  was not found when attempting to remove it\nI don't know why it gives me this.

So I figured I would see if I could encrypt all the data before doing a few passes with shred\n\nA: shred is well suited to the task. Personally I would actually want to WRITE to the blocks rather than wrap the whole thing in encryption. Example,\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/6440/is-there-an-alternative-to-dev-urandom\nZap the disk with the openssl random data generator and then shred it.

If you're curious, try making a copy of the VM\n  somewhere on the Ubuntu partition and pointing VMware to that one.\n\n\nA: 12.04 and 16.04 so presumably also 14.04 are definitely slower than 10.04 unless you happen to have new hardware which does not mind the extra churn going on in newer versions.  As far as I can tell, since 12.04 some churnware such as tumblerd has been losing its configuration option to switch it off if you don't want a cpu core to be fully busy doing that.  Like we'd all want to buy quadcore eventually if enough things are broken without it.  Therefore your vmware player, if it has an option to allow more than one core to be used by the vm, is increasingly likely to need it with newer operating systems.\n", "Q: How to deploy: Mezzanine + MySQL So, here is a question:\nHow to deploy Mezzanine, a Django CMS, locally with MySQL instead of default SQLite?\nWhat is the exact recipe?\n\nA: Script in one piece is in ->here\n1. Python\nPython is preinstalled in Ubuntu and AFAIK it's vital to some system/desktop-env operations, but just in case:\nsudo apt-get install python\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\nsudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev\n\n2. MySQL\nYou need to install (a)server, (b)client, (c)dev libs & headers, (d)python adapter\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\nsudo apt-get install mysql-client-5.5\nsudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev\nsudo apt-get install python-mysqldb\n\n3. Credentials\nEstablish MySQL credentials, tutorial on this is ->here, so that you have the following users with corresponding login commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*root user\nmysql -u root -p / password \n\n\n*Mezzanine user\nmysql -u mezz -p / masterkey \n\n4. Install Mezzanine\npip install mezzanine\n\n5. Create Project\nmezzanine-project myproject\ncd myproject\n\n6. Configure db to MySQL\nUse your credentials from step 3.\nvim local_settings.py\n\nThat's a Python file. DATABASES variable should be made to be like this (use your credentials at italicized places):\n\nDATABASES = {\n    \"default\": {\n        # Ends with \"postgresql_psycopg2\", \"mysql\", \"sqlite3\" or \"oracle\".\n        \"ENGINE\": \"django.db.backends.mysql\",\n        # DB name or path to database file if using sqlite3.\n        \"NAME\": \"myproject\",\n        # Not used with sqlite3.\n        \"USER\": \"mezz\",\n        # Not used with sqlite3.\n        \"PASSWORD\": \"masterkey\",\n        # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.\n        \"HOST\": \"\",\n        # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.\n        \"PORT\": \"\",\n    }\n}\n7. Do Mezzanine routines\nCollect static files and templates\npython manage.py collectstatic  \npython manage.py collecttemplates  \n\nSynchronize with database. This step depends on the Django version, at the time of writing this, Django 1.7 is still not supported, so use syncdb:\npython manage.py syncdb\n\nYou may also consifer using South migration manager, but know that South project is at it's dusk since Django 1.7 has new migration system.\nAfter syncdb output you'd have a superuser (for entering Mezzanine's admin section). You can create superuser separately after sync:\npython manage.py createsuperuser\n\nRun built-in server of Mezzanine (more concretely, it's Django's lightweight server):\npython manage.py runserver\n\n8. Go\nPoint your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000 and hopefully you'll see the Mezzanine standard greeting.\n9. Production Deployment\n->Here is a good guide, you can use it to create a demo site in production environment (on that particular site it's free with some limits). And here are their settings for MySQL.\n10. Extras\n\n\n*\n\n*Official Mezzanine Installation Instructions (for SQLite)\n\n*Mezzanine static files explanation\n\n*Mezzanine templates explanation \n\n*More on customizing templates\n\n*Django Deployment Instructions, part about virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper\n11. 'Revisions'\nSome revisions I gathered on my way: \n\n\n*\n\n*South migration manager needs some change in Database section of your settings.py\n\n*Mezzanine and versioning seemed very frustrating to me: it doesn't support django 1.7, and on my hosting provider there was no root access, so I should have installed MySQL-Python ('adapter') through pip. Some versions of adapter-mezzanine-django are incompatible. \n\n\nFor now, I use Mezzanine v3.1.10, Django v1.6.10 and MySQL-Python v1.2.3 and it works. I disabled South backend addon, because it made things for my deployment more complex rather than simpler.\n12.

I thought all Linux systems including Ubuntu use X11. On this system, X in /etc/X11 points to /usr/bin/Xorg and /usr/lib/xorg has just one modules directory. Is X to be specifically installed, or are there other directories to point --x-includes and --x-libraries to?\n\nA: Just because a system uses the X windows system, it doesn't mean it necessarily ships with the header files and development libraries necessary to build X windows based applications - in fact, most don't.\nIf you don't know exactly which X development packages the software requires then, unless your system is severely limited by disk space, probably the easiest thing is to install the xorg-dev convenience package:\nDescription-en: X.Org X Window System development libraries\n This metapackage provides the development libraries for the X.Org X Window\n System.\n\nYou can do so either from the Software Center or other GUI package manager, or from the commandline using\nsudo apt-get install xorg-dev\n\n", "Q: Bootchart statistics What meaning do the following bootchart statistics have?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU (user + sys) - show percentage of usage all cores of my CPU?\n\n*I/O(wait) something wait input-output?

The disk throughput is a number in MBps/sec measuring the data that gets read/written to/from the disk.\nb. The Disk utilization is a % between 0 (meaning idle) and 100 (meaning fully occupied)\n\n\n*\"Unint. sleep\" is the abbreviation of \"Uninterrupted sleep\" (See 2. above)\n\n\n*\"Sleeping\" means \"not doing anything\" which would be not very good while performing a boot... (Also see 2. above)\nA simple example:\nLet's suppose you do video conversion: you will read very little disk, but use 100% of 1 CPU, then the Disk Utilisation will be 1% and the total CPU on a dual-Core CPU will be 50%\nNow you do a file copy: 1 CPU will be at 1% and the Disk Utilisation will be at 40%; now you do 2 file copies at the same time: CPU will be at 2% and Disk Utilisation will be at 80%.\nIf you do a third file copy at the same time, Disk Utilisation will be at 100%, but CPU% will go up and show 20% \"I/O Wait\": it doesn't go any faster: the CPU is just waiting until it can push some more data to the disk.\nThis is just an example: the % depend on the availability of RAM, CPU and the speed of your disk!\n", "Q: May I delete Compiz Session files Brand new poster.

I'm currently installing windows 8.1 on my laptop to take up the whole partition. While that's being set up I want to see how I can dual boot ubuntu 14.04 LTS with it.

The host is the same. The host has a bridge network configured since I want to see the guest on my network.\nSo far, I can see the guest on my network. I can ping it. The guest can ping out without problem. The guest has a static IP configured. I can ping external DNS servers etc.\nThe problem is that DNS just does not work on the guest. I cannot resolve anything either using nslookup or host commands.\nThe host does not have any DNS issues.\nSo I am baffled as to why DNS does not work but networking does.\nHere is the host /etc/network/interfaces file:\n# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system\n# and how to activate them.

I found it. It took some faffing about (a technical term) but I was able to eventual get the brain working.\nHere is what I know. Networking based on IP address is fine. I can ping out and ping in. So TCP generally is not a problem in this bridged KVM guest. Yet dns, regardless of the server was an issue. Why? If networking is generally fine but a particular service is having an issue then I should have naturally decided to look at the firewall.\nIn this case, the host firewall was blocking DNS requests from the guess. Since this is an internal system disabling the host firewall with:\nsudo ufw disable\n\nand opening up iptables:\nsudo iptables -F\nsudo iptables -X\nsudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT\n\n...resolved my issue.

It doesn't appear the 'admin' user existed before I created it, based on the output in the shell.  Why did this work this way?\n\nA: By default adduser adds every new user to a group with the same name as the user's (the group is created if it doesn't already exists). So if you create a user called admin it will be added to the group admin.\n/etc/sudoers contains the line\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nwhich means that all members of the group admin are allowed to use sudo - and that's true for your admin user, too.\n", "Q: Dowload YouTube videos to .avi I download videos from YouTube using youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/....\n, but their format is .mp4.

However I made this specific setup because as you can see I had many small drives and I needed a way to combine their storage space without losing to much speed, also please remember that this is a hardware raid, that means (depending on raid controller) the hard drives continue spinning as long as my computer is on, that in effect means that there is next to no spin-up time, although this probably ruins my hard drive, please consider the setup below and tell me what you think...\n1) SSD: 70 GB, OS disk, not part of raid\n2) HDD: 160 GB, member disk, raid 0\n3) HDD: 250 GB, member disk, raid 0\nFinally, I do know the risks of raid 0, that is why I store no important information on this computer, data loss is not an issue, finally if you know of another way to combine the storage space of these disks please tell me, Thanks in advance for all help, thank you\nP.S. This is a custom desktop, built mainly as a test subject for stuff like dual-booting (as in this case), and overclocking.\n\nA: There is a mayor flaw: Stripe across one SSD and two HDDs.\nWhy?? To slow down the SSD and raise the risk of data loss?\nStripe or RAID0 is meant to increase performance among the same type of drives or the slowest member.\n\n\n*\n\n*Take two slow drives and RAID0 will give you a bit better performance.\n\n*Take one slow and one fast drive, the load is distributed even and the slower drive will slow down the faster one (equal to a RAID0 of two slow drives). With HDDs this may be negligible, but a mix of HDDs and SSDs is a bad idea.\n\n*RAID0 will not double or triple (…) performance of the fastest drive or drive with average performance.\n\n\nI assume everyone knows that RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks and that RAID0 sacrifices redundancy for performance resulting in AID ZERO: Completely useless when one drive fails.\n\ndone extensive research\n\nI doubt that. You must have come to the conclusion that this is nonsense: dual-booting this way with fakeraid complex and no fun, no redundancy, no performance improvement over the SSD.\n\nSuggestions (assuming the device is a laptop):\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the two HDDs with fast state of the art HDDs for massstorage. Note that some implementations of (software) RAID1 also offer (read) performance benefits. Find out how to leverage that in your usecase.\n\n*Buy a bigger SSD.\n\n*If the SSD is an mSATA SSD think about dual mSATA adapters for 2.5\" bays setting up one big HDD and up to 3 mSATA SSDs.\n\n", "Q: Why do I not see my /bin, /var, (etc.) directories in my root partition?

Searching this website doesn't turn up anything and neither does google.\nI work with some data files that have a suffix .iso.  These are simple ascii data files, not ISO images.  However, when I try to 'less' one of these files in the terminal, I get the error message:\nCD-ROM is NOT in ISO 9660 format\n\nIn other words, it thinks they are ISO images because of the suffix.  The 'more' utility treats them as regular text files but does not have as many convenient options as 'less'.\nCan I change the default behavior for this file suffix?  And, if so, how?\n\nA: Probably what is happening is that the file handling is being intercepted by the default lessfile input preprocessor. Although I don't have any experience with it,  according to man lessfile it is possible to override the default behaviour as follows:\nUSER DEFINED FILTERS\n       It  is  possible to extend and overwrite the default lesspipe and less‐\n       file input processor if you have specialized  requirements.  Create  an\n       executable  program with the name .lessfilter and put it into your home\n       directory. This can be a shell script or a binary program.\n.\n.\n.\n\nHowever, if your files are plain ASCII text, it may be sufficient for your needs to simply disable the preprocessor altogether - either by setting an empty LESSOPEN environment variable\nLESSOPEN= less yourfile.iso\n\nor using the -L command line option\nless -L yourfile.iso\n\nFrom man less:\n   -L or --no-lessopen\n          Ignore the LESSOPEN environment variable  (see  the  INPUT  PRE‐\n          PROCESSOR  section  below).   This option can be set from within\n          less, but it will apply only to files opened  subsequently,  not\n          to the file which is currently open.\n\n\nA: I added this answer due to previous answer look alike environmental trick which slightly \"too odd\" or redundantly inefficient.\nMost likely format for simple & usual ASCII binary is .txt:\nAmerican Standard Code for Information Interchange \nYou have all chances to save your ASCII to .txt, and to save your .txt inside standard .iso, and you have the same way you can run these files with STANDART environment.\nBecause .iso file format is about disk images.\n", "Q: Lost Ubuntu 14.04 after Windows 8.1 install at 2nd partition Greetings to everybody, \nnot sure if anyone had the same issue previously, but could not find any similar (or i wasnt that  patient to search :) and in that matter i apologize if am making duplicate post.\nAm new to Ubuntu, but am finding it very amusing, useful and user friendly, and most likely way more secure and stable for the tasks i have.

However, the following fixes might still work for you:\n1. My first fix was to use a rEFInd bootable cd, and it should find all of the OS's on your computer and allow you to boot into them. You can download the rEFInd iso image here.\n2. My second fix was to press Escape on startup and then F9 to access the Boot Device Options. Then I selected Customize Boot Options to find the OS systems.\n3. A permanent fix I used was to go into the Bios menu and change the boot path to the Grub file. If you want to try this, please reply so I can provide more detailed instructions.\nThese fixes helped me, but you probably have a different problem since your computer had Ubuntu installed by default.\n\nA: When you install Windows, it always takes over the boot manager for the drive. Because of this, it's usually recommended that you install Windows first, then Linux, since Grub usually picks up on the Windows install and automatically sets up your boot menu.\nNot to fear though, you can recover your Ubuntu partition and set up true dual-boot without much effort.\nHere's the easiest way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert your Ubuntu CD, reboot your computer and set it to boot from CD in the BIOS and boot into a live session. You can also use a LiveUSB if you have created one in the past.\n\n*Click \"Install\" and then \"Boot-Repair.\"\n\n*Click \"Recommended Repair.\"\n\n*Now reboot your system. The usual GRUB boot menu should appear. If it does not, hold Left Shift while booting. You will be able to choose between Ubuntu and Windows.\n\n\nIf that doesn't seem to work, you may need to work through the Grub2 recovery guide found here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#Reinstalling_GRUB_2\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\n\nA: The Ubuntu web site has the fix. \nGRUB2 is the boot manager installed in Ubuntu by default. This means Ubuntu is independent and avoids any need for writing to other operating systems. To accomplish this, the only thing in your computer outside of Ubuntu that needs to be changed is a small code in the MBR (Master Boot Record) of the hard disk (which is booted by the BIOS). The MBR code is changed to point to the boot loader in Ubuntu. You will be presented with a list of operating systems and you can choose one to boot. If you do nothing Ubuntu will boot after a ten second countdown. If you select Windows then GRUB will chain-load Windows for you at the Windows boot sector, which is the first sector of the Windows partition.\nA fast fix is with Ubuntu Boot Repair. A small program that scans the drive for bootable partitions and loads them into GRUB2.\n", "Q: My laptop doesn't recognize its internal disk as bootable. How do I fix this? I bought a Toshiba Satellite and installed Ubuntu using a homemade liveusb, choosing to use the entire HDD and set up an encrypted LVM in the process. The installer finished with no errors, but the laptop's firmware didn't seem to recognize the HDD as bootable; powering it on without the flash drive gave me this error (capitalization not mine):\nReboot and select proper Boot device\nor Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key\n\nI booted back to the liveusb, zeroed out the first few mebibytes of the HDD for good measure, and ran the installer again the same way, with the same result. After this, I tried sudo grub-install /dev/sda and sudo update-grub from the installed system. Both completed successfully, but didn't fix the problem.\nSomeone from Freenode/#ubuntu was kind enough to write a pair of GRUB commands that I could use at the flash drive's GRUB shell to boot from the HDD:\nsearch --set=root --file /grub/grub.cfg\nconfigfile /grub/grub.cfg\n\nAnd a handy menu entry:\nmenuentry \"Load Installed Ubuntu's grub.cfg\" {\n    search --set --fs-uuid $sda2_uuid\n    configfile /grub/grub.cfg\n}\n\n($sda2_uuid is the UUID of the partition that gets mapped to /dev/sda2 and mounted at /boot in the installed system. /dev/sda1 is mounted at /boot/efi.)\nThis works well enough as a temporary measure, though obviously it's impractical for the long term, as it requires me to keep the flash drive around.\nWhat's going on here? How do I get this laptop to recognize its HDD as bootable?\n\nPartition table (sudo parted /dev/sda print)\nModel: ATA TOSHIBA MQ01ABF0 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 500GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: gpt\nDisk Flags: \n\nNumber  Start   End    Size   File system  Name                  Flags\n 1      1049kB  538MB  537MB  fat32        EFI System Partition  boot, esp\n 2      538MB   794MB  256MB  ext2\n 3      794MB   500GB  499GB\n\n\nUpdate\nI remembered reading somewhere that the EFI partition (/dev/sda1 in my case) should be FAT16, so I made a disk image of it, formatted it as FAT16, and copied all the files back. After rebooting, the an error would flash up an error for a split second:\nFailed to open \\EFI\\BOOT\\grubx64.efi\n\nThere was a ./EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi (relative to the root of sda1), so I copied it to ./EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi and the laptop now boots on its own. It still doesn't give me a GRUB menu, and now it also gets stuck on a solid purple screen for a good half minute before it shows any indication of getting on with the boot process (despite me having replaced quiet splash in the kernel arguments with text), but it boots.\nThis seems like a rather crude solution, and I don't know why it worked in my case, so I won't post it as an answer. I'll keep messing with it, though; hopefully I'll find something better.\n\nA: Great security comes with great responsibility.\nYour BIOS itself simply cannot boot from an encrypted partition. What you should have done is: create a small (unencrypted) boot partition that loads the LVM and the encryption/decryption module and hands over the boot process to the encrypted encryption/decryption module which then completes the boot process.\nTrueCrypt is software that completely automates this, and its sole developer is not maintaining the software any more, but it's still be best out there!\nSo what you have to do now is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make an unencrypted backup of your date (if you have any)\n\n*Read the manual of the encryption software you're going to use completely (hopefully TrueCrypt) and use the LVM manuals to create your LVs (if this is your first time using LVM).\n\n*Re-install using the procedure above\n\n", "Q: Upgrading from kernel 3.13 to 3.18 causes Unity not to load, wireless not to work (System specs included) SYSTEM SPECS: \n Macbook Pro (64 bit), Ubuntu 14.04,\n\n kernel version: 3.13, \n\n graphics drivers: nvidia-331\n\nRecently I've been experiencing wi-fi problems on a regular basis in 14.04 with kernel version 3.13, and I was getting really annoyed. I did a bit of research and found a bug report on launchpad- the submitter reported that upgrading from the 3.13 kernel to 3.18 had solved his problem entirely, so I decided to try it out.\nTo upgrade my kernel I followed the instructions in the linked thread- I navigated to the ubuntu kernel webpage (hopefully the right one) , dowloaded linux-headers-3.18.0-031800-generic_3.18.0-031800.201412071935_amd64.deb, opened the file with Software Center, and hit \"install.\"\nI didn't get any errors during the actual install process. However, when I rebooted my system I noticed that the errors/log output was different when the system was booting up (before it would always say \"registered C22fgy.phy\" or something similar- I dont remember). Now, however, the following errors show up.\n[   0.026781] [Firmware Bug]: ioapic 2 has no mapping iommu, interrupt remapping will be disabled\n[   1.219547] pci 0000:00:01.0: ASPM Could not configure common clock\n[   2.629436] i8042: No controller found\n\nThe system booted to the login screen fine (Unity seemed to be working OK, with the widget bar functioning in the top of the screen). However as soon as I tried to login, I get a \"system problem detected\" window, and Unity doesnt load- my wallpaper shows up, but there's no desktop environment to accompany it (even the widgets in the top corner disappeared). On top of that, wifi doesnt seem to be working at all under 3.18 (havent tried wired yet). I can still get into the shell via cntrl+alt+f1+fn (I'm on a laptop), but I'm not really sure what I'd use it for. Running uname -r verifies that the 3.18 kernel has actually been installed. \nI can, using grub, still boot normally using the 3.13 kernel (that's actually what I'm typing this from).\nI was hoping you guys could help me out with (correctly) installing the 3.18 kernel, as well as with resolving the problems that are popping up for me. If you guys need any more information, I'd be happy to provide it.\nThanks!\n\nA: I read the \"advice\" given on that bugreport but I think it was wrong.

Its job is to load the operating system. Windows OSes installs mbr in the first sector of the hard disk.\nA lot of people have problems getting an external drive to boot their computer, and I don't know enough to help with that issue.\nUbuntu uses either ext3 or ext4 format for the partition. You can install Ubuntu on your drive by making room for it. You will need to shrink the Windows partition to make space using a Partition Manager. When you install Ubuntu, it will load GRUB2 (a program similar to mbr). When GRUB2 is installed, the drive is scanned for bootable partitions and the information is written on the drive so that the menu has a list of all bootable partitions.\n\nA: In some laptops namely HP after you install Ubuntu os while it boots go press F9 for selection of boot device.

The script in question does something in a really, really stupid way, but it probably doesn't trigger the fail scenario for every system because...\nOriginal Bug:\nI am not sure what happened. I moved the folder in the title to a drive mounted under /media/user/BLAH and symlinked /home/user/.local/steam to the new location.\nI launched steam. It did not launch, it offered to let me browse, and still could not find it when I pointed to the new location. Steam crashed. I restarted it.\nIt re-installed itself and everything looked great. Until I looked and saw that steam had apparently deleted everything owned by my user recursively from the root directory. Including my 3tb external drive I back everything up to that was mounted under /media.\nEverything important, for the most part, was in the cloud. It is a huge hassle, but it is not a disaster. If there is the chance that moving your steam folder can result in recursively deleting everything in the directory tree you should probably just throw up an error instead of trying to point to other stuff. Or you know, allow the user to pick an install directory initially like on windows.\nMy system is ubuntu 14.04, and the drive I moved it to was ntfs if its worth anything.\n\n\nA: The problem starts around line 19 in the script \"steam.sh.\":\nSTEAMROOT=\"$(cd \"${0%/*}\" && echo $PWD)\"\nSTEAMDATA=\"$STEAMROOT\"\n\n$STEAMROOT can become empty here effectively making the rm -rf \"$STEAMROOT/\"* further into the script the same as  rm -rf \"/\"*.\n\nThere are patches showing up and there is a lot wrong with this script.

Thus, apache2 probably cannot start, because some encrypted folders are not mounted at boot. Is there a way of starting apache2 on login, or postponing its launch until my home filesystem is mounted? \n\nA: You can postpone apache to start by renaming the symlinks which were created byupdate-rc.d apache2 defaults - \"defaults\" mean that such symlinks were created for default runlevels set in /etc/init.d/apache2, so in /etc/rc2.d, /etc/rc3.d, /etc/rc4.d, /etc/rc5.d directories..\nIn each above directory, you will see something like \"S91apache2 -> ../init.d/apache2*\"\nissue command sudo mv S91apache2 S99apache2 in each above directory.\nThe biggest is the number, the later the script will be started - however, using S99 is the latest posssible time to start...\n\nA: With heavy adoption of systemd as system manager and init system for debian based distributions like ubuntu , we can now use systemctl commands to enable a service to start when booting\nfor example :\n\nsudo systemctl enable apache2\n\n", "Q: Why is my USB Ethernet Card not working in Ubuntu 14.04 Server? I've got a laptop which I'm trying to set up as a server (a rebadged Uniwill 223ii0), but it has an ethernet port which is dodgy (sometimes works, sometimes doesn't).\nI bought a £20 usb ethernet card which worked out of the box when the laptop was running Windows 7, and worked during the server install, but not once the server was standing on its own two feet, as it tries to get network configuration on boot, then waits another minute before giving up and completing the boot.\nOnce logged in, using sudo ifup eth2 yields that it is already configured, so bringing the adapter down and up yields with a long DHCPDISCOVER sequence which yields that \"the network is down\".\nI am using the adapter on my Windows 7 machine right now to write this, and the same cable in the dodgy port on the laptop is working, for now\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Huh, looks like I found a bug with the way 14.04 is installed.\nIt turns out that whilst my USB card was eth2 on install, it got reassigned eth1 afterward, and the system tried to connect on eth2 (whatever eth2 may be, unless the onboard modem or wireless card counts as an ethernet interface).\nReplacing eth2 with eth1 in /etc/network/interfaces and bringing up the adapter with sudo ifup eth1 solved this for me\n\nA: With logical computer counting, we start at 0 as the first point of contact and not 1;  so then we use 1 for the 2nd, 2 for the 3rd, and so on. So logically if eth0 is the 1st Ethernet port, then eth1 would logically have to be the second Ethernet port, eth2 the 3rd..... So that explains why eth2 was not working and why eth1 is working since you have 2 ports, eth0 the dodgy built-in port and eth1 the USB Ethernet port. Add yet another USB Ethernet adapter and eth2 should work seamlessly on that 3rd port, when configured properly to do so, of course. \nA great trick in Terminal to see ALL networking ports is with this simple command and flag:\nifconfig -a\n\nI had similar issues with Ubuntu Server and specifically with how it named its ports. I found for some reason the build I used wasn't using eth it was using p2p1?. With me renaming the /etc/network/interfaces file's listed interfaces I was able to get it working using eth0 and not p2p1. That was found it out simply by calling the ifconfig -a command, emphasizing its usefulness.\n", "Q: Execute command in terminal an don't wait its return I need to run Firefox browser from terminal.

I check version after and it reports 0.10.25 (the version available for Utopic) \nSo I'm not sure if it only some packages manually installed that will update, or if it cause I used checkinstall to make the deb/install. \nThe only weird thing is when I manually installed I checked version with\n node -v\n\nBut since update using apt, now I have to use \nnodejs -v\n\nSo again, I built an old version deb from source using checkinstall and it updated to latest version using \n sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: How to enable Silverlight on Chrome 39 or newer I know, that this question was asked and answered too many times, but I tried almost everything and nothing seems to work in any version newer than 39 of Chrome.\nPipelight doesn't seem to work since Chrome removed NPAPI support in version 35, Moonlight was abandoned long time ago and Silverlight running in Wine is not what I need. Could anybody help me to run Silverlight plugin please?\n\nA: It will not work in Chrome in Linux,   but there are two other ways.\nThe first is the easiest: switch to another browser which pipelight supports, like Firefox. \nThe second is somewhat harder and requires a (legal) copy of Windows. You can put Windows inside a virtual box or dual boot it.

(the hotkeys are especially valid for HP hardware, different manufacturers' computers may have other keyboard shortcuts to enter BIOS)\n\nA: I think aFoP is right in suggesting to set the HDD as primary boot device. You may have removed Windows from the harddrive but in the UEFI firmware settings it may still be configured to boot the Windows OS in UEFI mode that is no more.\nIf you followed the how-to correctly and installed Ubuntu in UEFI mode on this new machine it usually creates an ubuntu boot entry and sets it as the primary boot option, but HP UEFI firmwares have sort of \"ignored\" this in the past (accepting the command and creating the entry but…) after rebooting they still expected to boot Windows.\nFor UEFI-installations disabling any Fast Boot option¹ in the firmware setting, optionally disabling Secure Boot and installing the bootloader with the --removable option to boot from the HDD/SSD should give you a booting OS.\nFor MBR-installations just disabling UEFI and booting from the HDD/SSD should work as aFoP described.\n¹ Apparently managing the boot order to have your favorite OS in first position, detecting drives (disabling slow drives like FDDs, ODDs, big HDDs) and operating systems was so hard that this switch had to be invented, which boots nothing else than Windows and saves a few nanoseconds over a properly configured setup that boots Linux.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 shows only one hdd I am just started using Ubuntu & I am not computer expert.

If yes, you could search for any tool that is able to read out these values (Windows: SIW, hwInfo, Defraggler - Ubuntu: ?), as your problem sounds to me like a hardware problem. Think of backing up important files, which is never a fault. If it really is a hardware problem (hdd going to die soon), you should avoid unnecessary spin-up/-downs, so keep it running as long as possible or keep it off, but avoid many restarts.\n", "Q: System font is wrong Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nAfter rebooting my machine following a hang by the Software Updater (updates appeared not to have been installed, but subsequently have been), the system font is appearing wrong (too small, borderline unreadable) in my main user account.

One thing that was confusing is that it mentioned that they got permission from Canonical Ltd to use the word UBUNTU.\nIt is strange to me. If somebody makes a website and teaches UBUNTU, should they ask from Canonical for mentioning the word UBUNTU? What is the legal status of all tutorial websites?

I've had no issues so far with anything that I could not find answers to here. However, I inserted my 32Gb SD Card into my SD card slot (I've verified on a Windows machine that the card does in fact work) and received the following message:\nError mounting /dev/sdb1 at /media/cj/4421-0000: \n  Command-line `mount -t \"exfat\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,\n  iocharset=utf8,namecase=0,errors=remount-ro,umask=0077\" \n  \"/dev/sdb1\" \"/media/cj/4421-0000\"' exited with non-zero exit status 32:\n  mount: unknown filesystem type 'exfat'\n\nTo be quite honest, I have no clue what any of this means.

Can anyone decipher this and tell me what I need to do to mount this SD card correctly?\n\nA: I think the FS format is in exFAT - a filesystem that I think Ubuntu doesn't agree with all too well (though Windows doesn't mind it). Try placing the format of the SD card as NTFS; I haven't had any NTFS problems with Ubuntu (though I was using 12.04).\n\nA: I had the same issue, albeit on Linux Mint. \nI installed \"exfat fuse\" and am now able to mount my 128GB SDcard. \n", "Q: SMART data no longer available for my external HDD in disks utility I no longer can check my external HDD status by using SMART data and self-tests.\nUsing disks the option that was available before is just disabled as in the following screenshot:\n\nI guess it's related to some permissions, but I don't know what to do.\n\nA: It's never good news if a hard-disk suddenly starts not reporting on SMART data.\nTherefore, please check if your drive have SMART capabilities: \nsudo hdparm -I /dev/XdY\n\n(where X=h or s and Y=a, b, c, ... depending on your hardware) and enable it: \nsudo smartctl --smart=on /dev/sdb \n\nand install the command-line version of the SMART monitoring:\napt-get install smartmontools\n\nThen perform the command:\nsmartctl --scan\n\nwhich should give you the drives you have on the system.

I tried to edit the profile so that when I start my gnome-terminal it always starts with archey... So after adding archey to something, I closed my terminal and tried to re-open it...

From the link:\n\nInkscape 0.91 includes significant performance improvements thanks to a new Cairo-based renderer which is faster on most drawings. Also, the rendering of SVG drawings is now cached, resulting in important responsiveness improvements.\nFurthermore, the latest Inkscape uses OpenMP multithreading for filters (filters use all available processor cores for computation), which provides better performance when editing drawings that include large filtered objects on multi-core systems.\n\nOfficial release notes.\nInstallation using the Inkscape PPA stable version:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:inkscape.dev/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install inkscape\n\n\nA: During Inkscape startup it loads icons and fonts.\nStart-up time improved with version 0.91, but there is still a delay, especially if you have lots of installed fonts.\nOther applications (like GIMP for example) also have a load process which can be slow, but they have a splash dialog that shows the loading progress.  Inkscape doesn't have this.  The user experience could be improved if Inkscape had a loading/splash screen to indicate what's happening.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Software Center Crashing I recently installed an upgrade for Ubuntu, however due to a mis-click, I accidentally aborted the update installation in between.\nSince then my software center has stopped working.

I have added my user to www-data group and chown'd the directory /var/www/  as well.\n\nA: Hopefully this helps solve your problem and explain whats going on, to help you in the future too.\nWhen you go into the wordpress \"dashboard\" and upload files - the \"user\" that is performing the changes to the filesystem iswww-data (i.e. libapache2-mod-php5 via apache webserver).\nTherefore in order to make changes in wp-content/uploads/2015/01., www-data needs to either have write permissions to the directory or own the directory.\nThis means you can either give the folder liberal permissions by running:\nchmod -R 777 wp-content/uploads\n\nNote: you will have to cd into the  wordpress directory first, and if you dont currently own the folder, you will need to  use sudo\nHowever in my experience, this will result in problems , i.e. once you fix that permission issue, you will likely run into more problems when wordpress tries to write  files to other directories e.g. when it updates, new plugins etc. so in that case i would use:\nsudo chown -R www-data <wordpress-parent-directory>\n\nand let www-data own the entire folder.\nNote: its not such a big deal on local install but when you move to production server, need to be careful with permissions, and generally only give webserver absolute minimum permissions it needs to do its job.\n\nA: You can use this script to fix wordpress permission:\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# This script configures WordPress file permissions based on recommendations\n# from http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress#File_permissions\n#\n# Author: Michael Conigliaro <mike [at] conigliaro [dot] org>\n#\nWP_OWNER=www-data # <-- wordpress owner\nWP_GROUP=www-data # <-- wordpress group\nWP_ROOT=$1 # <-- wordpress root directory\nWS_GROUP=www-data # <-- webserver group\n\n# reset to safe defaults\nfind ${WP_ROOT} -exec chown ${WP_OWNER}:${WP_GROUP} {} \\;\nfind ${WP_ROOT} -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\nfind ${WP_ROOT} -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\n\n# allow wordpress to manage wp-config.php (but prevent world access)\nchgrp ${WS_GROUP} ${WP_ROOT}/wp-config.php\nchmod 660 ${WP_ROOT}/wp-config.php\n\n# allow wordpress to manage wp-content\nfind ${WP_ROOT}/wp-content -exec chgrp ${WS_GROUP} {} \\;\nfind ${WP_ROOT}/wp-content -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \\;\nfind ${WP_ROOT}/wp-content -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \\;\n\nsave it to a file and run it and pass it your wp installation directory:\nwget https://gist.github.com/Adirael/3383404/raw/6c5446d56477426faeb709e5b807f00422acdea2/fix-wordpress-permissions.sh\nchmod +x fix-wordpress-permissions.sh\nsudo ./fix-wordpress-permissions.sh /var/www/html\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/Adirael/3383404\n\nA: Is the wp-content directory really where you think it is? \nI notice that the article in question created a directory in /var/www/html/ but wordpress will  thing it will be under the wordpress directory that you extracted from the compressed tarfile.

So my question is in the title; I ask this because when I run lspci and other commands I can still see my i7 processor's integrated graphics in the output commands as well as my nvidia GTX 660. I even put the drivers for the intel graphics in my blacklist, but it still is showing up. Therefore, does my the kernel know to utilize the GTX over the intel (all third party drivers are up to date, am NOT using Noveau drivers but am using official nvidia).\n\nA: Yes and no...Ubuntu will use the discrete GPU if its module (a.k.a. \"driver\") is loaded, but it will not disable the integrated card.\nWhy?Some people use both cards at the same time: Integrated for simple windowing, GPU for gaming, video, ...\n\nIf you want to turn off the integrated graphics driver: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go into your BIOS and look for graphics related options (every BIOS is different) and turn off the integrated graphics there.  Sometimes it's easy, but sometimes it's not obvious and you have to change the memory settings of the integrated graphics to '0'.  Refer to your BIOS documentation.\n\n*If BIOS settings don’t work, you can still blacklist the module itself, but the memory allocated to the card by the BIOS will still be unavailable to Ubuntu.

Lubuntu 13.10 ,Epson V200 photo scanner I've had this scanner sitting around, and I decided to see if I could set it up on my old Compaq Presario V2000, running Lubuntu 13.10. The scanner is an Epson V200 perfection. \nFor the drivers( my computer is 32bit), I went here and in this order, I downloaded and installed:\n    1. `iscan-data_1.34.0-1_all.deb`\n\n    2.iscan_2.30.1-1~usb0.1.ltdl7_i386.deb\n\n    3.iscan-plugin-gt-f670_2.1.2-1_i386.deb\n\nAfter that, the scanner worked in both simple scan and image scan. However, the white fields in pictures were now light blue(not solid though), and the lines of the pictures had a strange double effect in blue and red lines. Almost like you're looking at a 3d image, without the 3d glasses. I'm assuming it's a driver issue, and from the few old threads I've seen, there may not be a fix. I thought I'd try and post here for any ideas.\nBelow is actually one of the better results I've gotten from scanning. I just scanned a random text sheet(photos are a lot worse). As you can see, there is a weird blueish, splotchy haze and some of the text is \"Psychedelic\"\n\n\nA: This is, almost certainly, a failing lamp. You are, maybe, in luck. Most of today's scanners use something called a Cold Cathode lamp. The older style scanners used a special lamp with a high CRI (Color Rendering Index) which uses a wider spectrum than your usual house lamps. As lamps with a high CRI are not generally replaced (disposable society and all that) there is not a very large market for them. You do see replaceable lamps but that is generally with the more expensive scanners, those used in a professional setting where they pay a great deal of money and often have a specialist company maintain their print rooms (which is often where the scanners are).\nNow, this doesn't mean you're entirely out of options. You can do a few things to resolve this situation, maybe: \nYou can find a forum, if one exists, full of enthusiasts. I did not see one for your model. You may have better luck than I. One of them may be able to find a lamp or know where you can find one.\nYou can try the myriad online resources in hopes of finding a working model that matches your own and harvest the lamp from that one. It's not difficult to change your lamp and, believe it or not, this may actually be your least expensive and most viable solution. You do need to make sure that it is not a Cold Cathode first. (More on that below.)\nFinally, you can call the manufacturer or use their online contacts and see if they will find, sell, and help you change the lamp. Having dealt with this company in the past, I wish you luck.\nNow, assuming that Google is correct and you do, indeed, have the older style lamp (the newer lamps are not user-serviceable) then you can try this site to get the current contact information for user-serviceable parts replacements. They should be able to tell you if it is a Cold Cathode or a CRI lamp.\nIf they can give you the part number there's a very limited chance that a specialty lamp shop will carry this. As you have a consumer model, there doesn't seem to be a detailed technical spec chart online.\nSorry that this is, unlikely, an operating system issue and can't be fixed by tweaking and poking. To be honest, the lamps are expensive and it may be worth it to simply replace it with a newer model if you can't find a cadaver to strip for parts.\nI've gone through this, albeit with a different model, myself and my scans looked a lot like the one you're sharing with us. I wish there were more to do but it's almost certainly a hardware issue. \n\nA: I'd test the scanner in Windows to see if the drivers there have any better luck. It could be that if the scanner's been \"sitting around\" a long time maybe it's just getting old & dirty & no longer scans properly at all? Testing in windows would confirm if it's a driver issue, or a scanner issue.\nIf it does only work well in Windows, then trying to use it with WINE is a (remote?) possibility, or even running Windows in a VM (an old XP version with no networking may even be good enough) might work?\nIn the image it doesn't look a whole lot worse than other old scans on old scanners I've seen. I can see the text on the other side of the paper coming through (looks like that anyway).\nAnd the red-blue-yellow separating looks similar to an inkjet printer out of alignment, maybe here the scanner is \"slipping\" or something and not reading correctly? If the separating were all over the image I'd more agree with a driver issue, but it being only in one little section I'm thinking hardware... maybe a good cleaning could help?\n", "Q: Cinnamon desktop- software rending mode issue I am using Ubuntu 14.04 with the cinnamon desktop.

The program installed the things to my USB and then I turned of my laptop and plugged in the USB to my desktop. \nI turned on the desktop and pressed F10 while starting up. \nThe Boot Menu showed up and I could choose from where I wanted to boot. I choosed my USB. Then I could choose if I wanted to Try Ubuntu or Install and other things. I pressed Install Ubuntu. The Installation begun and everything where fine. I choose to install Ubuntu while keeping Windows XP (if the installation didn't work). \nWhen the installation finished and the login screen was showing I wrote my password that was configured in the installation. Now only the background was showing and I was not able to move the cursor. \nI have searched the internet but havent found anhthing that worked for me. I have tried opening the terminal using Alt + Shift + F2. But the terminal asked for my login so I entered my username (the name over the password-field on the login screen). Then I pressed Enter. The terminal asked for my password so I entered the password that I used on the login screen. No letters or stars was showing. I pressed Enter. It sakd Login Incorrect. \nWhat should I do?? This is the first time I am using Linux.

Problems are solved more quickly on this version, but it also has more problems.  For stability, always choose LTS versions.  See this Q&A for more info.\nFurthermore, copy-paste or cut-paste should make no difference, however the way you remove the USB disk has an impact.  If you just yank it out without ejecting it, you're going to end up with unreadable files in the long run.\nI don't think you have to re-install the system: do a apt-get purge kodi and apt-get install kodi\nOR\ntry MiniDLNA.  \nOn the other hand, if you do decide to re-install, read this Q&A on how to better set up and backup your system, so that if you do run into troubles, you're just a restore away from a solution.\n", "Q: When is Ubuntu Phone/Touch coming to the U.S.?

Do you have to buy a phone with it already installed on it or will we be able to download and install it on any Android phone like we can download the desktop version of Ubuntu on any Windows PC?\n\nA: There are hints of a new manufacturer that will make it available to the U.S. Who, what, and actually when is anyone's guess. \nSource:\nCheck out @omgubuntu's Tweet: https://twitter.com/omgubuntu/status/565596316622147585?s=09\nIf you want a retail everyday phone, it would be best to buy one from a manufacturer preinstalled.

I wanted to leave a receiver in the portable and the other in my home PC but I can't because only one receiver connects with the logitech devices. \nWhy ?  What can I do?\n\nA: The device can only be paired to a single receiver due to hardware limitations. There is however a workaround in software. As long as the other receiver is not in the proximity of the device, you can trigger a new pairing request.\nThis can be done with the ltunify program or Solaar, but it then requires something to trigger the pairing request. If you have no other button, you could make it trigger on re-inserting the receiver device using the udev rule from this post. After triggering a pairing request you will be able to pair by power cycling the devices.\n\nA: This is a hardware issue: Logitech wants you to buy as many keyboards/mice as you can, not as many receivers as you can, so the mouse and keyboard pair themselves to one receiver and then refuse to pair to another.\nThere is an RMA procedure for when the receiver gets lost or broken, but then the mouse and keyboard will be still paired to another receiver.\nIt would be cool if it worked, I agree, but I'm sorry to be the harbinger of bad news.\n\nA: For your information the Logitech Anywhere MX 2 and MX Master have the ability to connect on 3 different dongle (and/or bluetooth system) with a button located under the mouse.\nApparently the pairing information is not saved on receiver in the paired device.\n", "Q: ICS over existing WiFi network I have an existing WiFi network which all my devices are connected to.

For instance, I'd suggest getting dhcpcd. I'm not sure if NetworkManager changes it's settings automatically once you install dhcpcd, but I'd suggest opening the /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and under [main] section specify dhcp=dhcpcd, like so. At least according to man NetworkManager.conf :\n\nPresently dhclient and dhcpcd are sup‐ ported. The client configured\n  here should be avail‐ able on your system too. If this key is missing,\n  available DHCP clients are looked for in this order: dhclient, dhcpcd.\n\nDisable dnsmasq plugin\ndns=dnsmasq is another option that is specified in the NetworkManager.conf. The reason why I'd disable it, is because dnsmasq would fetch the dns server from the default gateway (aka your router), and that is also one of the elements in the \"getting ip configuration\" process. Simply comment out that plug in, like so # dns=dnsmasq. Small thing to keep in mind is that NetworkManager then won't resolve domain names. Thus, I suggest changing dns settings altogether. Also, think about deleting /etc/resolv.conf to let things reset or at least sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf.\nDelete connection configurations and reconnect\nThis can be done either through connections editor (Edit connections option in the drop-down menu ornm-connection-editor from terminal). Also, sudo rm -i /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/* will do the trick.\nDisable NetworkManager from creating a default wired connection\nAgain, it's in NetworkManager.conf, under [main], option should be no-auto-default=*\nTry WICD network manager\nI suppose that is self explanatory . . . \nExamine /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file\nYou can compare with my configuration :\n#send host-name \"andare.fugue.com\";\nsend host-name = gethostname();\n#send dhcp-client-identifier 1:0:a0:24:ab:fb:9c;\n#send dhcp-lease-time 3600;\nsupersede domain-name-servers 208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220,8.8.8.8;\n# prepend domain-name-servers 208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220;\nrequest subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,\n        domain-name, domain-name-servers, domain-search, host-name,\n        dhcp6.name-servers, dhcp6.domain-search,\n        netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu,\n        rfc3442-classless-static-routes, ntp-servers,\n        dhcp6.fqdn, dhcp6.sntp-servers;\n\nAmong other things, I'd also suggest that you add information from ifconfig, what ethernet card you have, and output of dmesg to your questoin.

After restoring I thankfully got everything back to booting and then lucky me, no internet because the network card seemed to be stuck in asking but never recieving an IP address.  All it would do is send DHCPDISCOVER requests as above.\nAfter hours/days of tinkering I found the driver r8169, as seen in the corner of your first screen shot, for realtek does not play nice.  An addition to the troubleshooting proposed by Sergiy would be to take a look at \ndmesg | grep -e r8169 -e <NICName>\n\nYou may see that the link is down, and not ready but it may not be abundantly apparent otherwise because the card still appears to send out DHCPDISCOVER messages during ifdown ; ifup resets.\nRolling back the drivers is easy enough and I followed this webpage as a guide:\nhttps://unixblogger.com/2016/08/11/how-to-get-your-realtek-rtl8111rtl8168-working-updated-guide/\nLoading the drivers onto a USB stick and installing them onto the server worked for me even without an internet connection.\nHope this helps, and at the very least hopefully it will show up when I google this problem in the future because I am sure this will happen again!\n\nA: What you've probably run into is an auto-negotiation issue.

Please I need a help.\n\nA: I haven't tried but you can enter the BIOS by holding the volume-up and power button (to turn on device). For me it didn't work the first few tries, I guess you either have to hold or release the volume button.\nWhen you are in the BIOS screen you can change boot-order to USB but you can also disable secure-boot.\nWith both of these options set and a USB-OTG + bootable-USB-drive it should work I guess.\n\nA: You can try to disable the \"secure boot\" setting in the UEFI. Also check if there is a setting for legacy support, if so enable it. It can be that those functions prevent the device from booting into another OS.\n", "Q: I am getting this Error: while I am trying to install the Firmware for linux kernel Drivers installArchives() failed: perl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\nLANGUAGE = (unset),\nLC_ALL = (unset),\nLANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\nare supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nperl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\nLANGUAGE = (unset),\nLC_ALL = (unset),\nLANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\nare supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nperl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\nLANGUAGE = (unset),\nLC_ALL = (unset),\nLANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\nare supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\nperl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\nLANGUAGE = (unset),\nLC_ALL = (unset),\nLANG = \"en_IN.ISO8859-1\"\nare supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nlocale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory\nlocale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory\n(Reading database ... \n(Reading database ... 5%%\n(Reading database ... 10%%\n(Reading database ... 15%%\n(Reading database ... 20%%\n(Reading database ... 25%%\n(Reading database ... 30%%\n(Reading database ... 35%%\n(Reading database ... 40%%\n(Reading database ... 45%%\n(Reading database ... 50%%\n(Reading database ... 55%%\n(Reading database ... 60%%\n(Reading database ... 65%%\n(Reading database ... 70%%\n(Reading database ... 75%%\n(Reading database ... 80%%\n(Reading database ... 85%%\n(Reading database ... 90%%\n(Reading database ... 95%%\n(Reading database ... 100%%\n(Reading database ... 213275 files and directories currently installed.)\n Preparing to replace linux-firmware 1.79.1 (using .../linux- firmware_1.79.18_all.deb) ...\nUnpacking replacement linux-firmware ...\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-firmware_1.79.18_all.deb   (--unpack):\ntrying to overwrite '/lib/firmware/ar3k/AthrBT_0x31010000.dfu', which is also in  package bt-dw1705-firmware 0.1\ndpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe)\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n/var/cache/apt/archives/linux-firmware_1.79.18_all.deb\nError in function: \nSystemError: E:Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\n\nA: First remove the bt-dw1705-firmware using \nsudo apt-get purge bt-dw1705-firmware\n\nand then execute \nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nOR\n(not safe)\nYou can also overwrite the existing file with the new one without removing any installed package with following command\nsudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-firmware_1.79.18_all.deb\n\nand then execute \nsudo apt-get install -f\n\n", "Q: 4GB RAM installed, Ubuntu shows 2.5GB Lenovo ThinkPad E430, hardware is straight from the vendor, untouched.\nThere are 4GB RAM installed, one card.\nYesterday I discovered Ubuntu sees only 2.5GB.\nBIOS detects 4GB RAM.\nThe system is 64bit Ubuntu 14.04.\nI cannot quite firmly confirm that the 4GB worked sometime already, but since my last install I was actually a little upset about the system running a little slow.

To be frank, I don't know if it's a problem of the router or my computer, that's why I'm posting this here.\nThe router generally works fine: every other device can connect to it without any problem, even my laptop can connect to it through ethernet cable, the problem only occurs if I try to connect via Wi-fi. Then what happens is my laptop gets connected to the router, and for a few (2-3) seconds I can reach the router, but then suddenly all packets are dropped, no matter what I am trying to connect to. The strange thing is that my laptop says I am still connected to the network.\nI didn't have any issue with the old router, which was a TP-Link TL-WR542G.\nI tried disabling the 802.11n protocol on the router, but it didn't help.\nThe output of wireless_script is the following:\n> ########## wireless info START ##########\n> \n> Report from: 18 Jan 2015 11:42 CET +0100\n> \n> Booted last: 18 Jan 2015 10:42 CET +0100\n> \n> Script from: 20 Sep 2014 23:04 UTC +0000\n> \n> ##### release ###########################\n> \n> Distributor ID:   Ubuntu Description: Ubuntu 14.10 Release:   14.10\n> Codename: utopic\n> \n> ##### kernel ############################\n> \n> Linux 3.16.0-29-generic #39-Ubuntu SMP Mon Dec 15 22:27:29 UTC 2014\n> x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n> \n> Parameters: ro, quiet, splash, vt.handoff=7\n> \n> ##### desktop ###########################\n> \n> Lubuntu\n> \n> ##### lspci #############################\n> \n> 02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation Wireless 7260\n> [8086:08b2] (rev 73)  Subsystem: Intel Corporation Wireless-N 7260\n> [8086:4262]   Kernel driver in use: iwlwifi\n> \n> ##### lsusb #############################\n> \n> Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:8000 Intel Corp.

Now the brightness controls aren't working with the FN keys or in the settings, and its stuck on very low. \nI tried this http://itsfoss.com/fix-brightness-ubuntu-1310/, and everything here https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/display, but they didn't do anything.\nI am on a Lenovo Z500 using Intel graphics. I have a Nvidia GeForce GT 635M but don't use it.\nI have noticed that there are the folders ideapad, intel_backlight and thinkpad_screen in /sys/class/backlight/, each with the files actual_brightness, brightness, and max_brightness. Only in intel_backlight is actual_brightness set to the maximum value. It says, though, that I don't have the permissions to change them with sudo.\n\nWorkaround: I got brightness back up by using the brightness FN keys outside of Ubuntu (before it starts or in the BIOS settings), but still whenever I press either of the brightness buttons it goes really dim and cannot be changed.\n\nA: Two years ago I bought this laptop which works pretty well with Linux. When I upgraded to my new distro, Elementary OS Freya, I noticed the problem that backlight was unable to change. I could change it only on grub screen. After trying every guide on the internet I partially solved the issue by downgrading the kernel (and the related Intel graphics driver) to version 3.13.\nYesterday I gave another try. It was very lucky :)\nHere the solution:\nOn the grub configuration file /etc/default/grub modify the following line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nby adding this string: acpi_backlight=vendor.\nIn my case it is:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nUpdate grub by launching:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThen create a xorg configuration file like this:\n/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/80-backlight.conf\n\nand copy in it this text:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"Intel Graphics\"\n    Driver      \"intel\"\n    Option      \"AccelMethod\"     \"sna\"\n    Option      \"Backlight\"       \"ideapad\"\n    BusID       \"PCI:0:2:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSave the file,\nReboot,\nEnjoy :-)\nThis trick could work on other Lenovo Ideapad laptops. I tested on Lenovo Ideapad z500 on Elementary OS Freya and Debian 8 Jessie.\nIf you have complitely another laptop you can try this way:\nModify grub like in the first part of the guide, update grub, reboot, then verify what backlight \"drivers\" (I don't know what they are) are being listed.\nGive:\nls /sys/class/backlight/\n\nand if it gives:\nbacklight_driver1\nbacklight_driver2\nbacklight_driver3\n\nThen create the xorg file with one of the drivers in the list:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"Intel Graphics\"\n    Driver      \"intel\"\n    Option      \"AccelMethod\"     \"sna\"\n    Option      \"Backlight\"       \"backlight_driver1\"\n    BusID       \"PCI:0:2:0\"\nEndSection\n\nAnd reboot. If it works, enjoy, otherwise modify the file with another one in the list the same way.\n\nA: You could try this\n\n\n*\n\n*Add GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_backlight=vendor\" to /etc/default/grub.\n\n*Update grub and reboot. Execute sudo update-grub && reboot.\n\n", "Q: xfce: cant change layout switch key due to unsupported keyboard model I prefer to use right alt as a keyboard layout (language) switch key. I use xfce.

I'm switching to Ubuntu server from FreeNAS and I don't have a hard drive to back the data up to. Is is possible to import it into Ubuntu even though the data pool is split between two different HDD?\n\nA: As Bruno Pereira has said, the zfs version number from FreeNAS needs to be equal or smaller than the zfs version number ubuntu supports. After zfs v28, this switched over to the need for support of the enabled zfs options.\nFor 16.04, the versions of zfs and FreeNAS 9.10 or even FreeNAS 10 are equal and a FreeNAS pool can be converted. I just converted a FreeNAS 10 trial installation myself for use under 16.04.\n\nA: No.\nThe version of the ZFS on Linux is not compatible with the version you used for your FreeNAS system, you will not be able to import it using ZFS on Ubuntu.\nThe other way around is possible (importing older versions of ZFS using FreeNAS).\nThere is no downgrade option for ZFS.\nThe issues is not the way ZFS is set (pools over different disks, raid setup etc), it has to do with options - mainly datasets - that are present in the FreeBSD release of ZFS, that are not present in the ZFS on Linux release.\n", "Q: What does the menubar do in ubuntu terminal? If I right click on a terminal in ubuntu, there is this \"Show Menu Bar\" option.\nIf it is checked or not it doesn't make any difference anywhere.

However, Unity - the default environment in Ubuntu,  always auto hides Menubars.Thus the \"Show Menu Bar\" option is useful when in Gnome environment, and as you stated doesn't make any difference in Unity.\n", "Q: Bidirectional drag'n drop is not working with VirtualBox and ubuntu 14.04 I use Virtualbox 4.3.20 with Ubuntu 14.01 image. Host OS is Windows 8.1. Bidirectional drag'n drop used to work before but now it won't after upgrading to these versions from previous versions. What can I do to resolve the problem?\n\nA: According to the Release notes:\n  https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-4.2\n\"Added experimental support for Drag'n'drop from the host to Linux guests. Support for more guests and for guest-to-host is planned.\"\nI did not see any newer release notes indicating that status had changed.\nSo, Drag 'n' Drop will only work 1 way.  Try enabling only \"host to guest\".  Also, because of this reason it may be more efficient to just use a shared folder and move files back and forth that way.\n\nA: Have you done\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms\n\nto ensure that virtualbox doesn't break after kernel updates?\n\nA: \"Drag and Drop\" was introduced with the guest additions in Virtual Box 5.0. with some limitations:\n\nAt the moment drag and drop is implemented for Windows- and X-Windows-based systems, both, on host and guest side. As X-Windows sports different drag and drop protocols only the most used one, XDND, is supported for now.VirtualBox Manual\n\nIn addition to that only drag & drop of simple text, or files and directories of the file manager not running with administrative permissions is supported.\nPreliminary experimental versions of Virtual Box \"Drag'N'Drop\" to a Linux guest only were introduced in version 4.2 .\n\nA: I solved this problem with a \"dirty\" way.\nI just compress any files/folder i want to DnD from my ubuntu VM to windows to .zip format.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: You can try one more thing \n1)share desired folder from windows OS.\n2) Check Network adapter is on NAT connection.\n3) from ubuntu on files select connect to server.\n4) smb:///\n5) Enter username and password of windows user.\n", "Q: Why can't the Ubuntu installer simply preinstall the latest Nvidia driver? Why can't the Ubuntu installer simply pre-install the latest Nvidia driver and the CUDA drivers? I am tired of trying again and again and just getting errors. Can someone help?\n\nA: The reason why Ubuntu does not include the proprietary NVIDIA drivers and CUDA programs by default is that these packages have a history of causing black screen problems on some computers, and the built-in open source nouveau driver does not have this problem. So a black screen problem caused by a proprietary graphics driver can almost always be solved by uninstalling the driver from a text-only console and rebooting the computer. When the computer reboots it will be using the default open source graphics driver, and you will have an opportunity to calmly consider what to do next about installing a better driver for your NVIDIA graphics processor.\n\nA: It is all copyright matters.Some software is not open source and eligible for personal use only.That's way they cannot be included. \n", "Q: Run the file in folder called `python` not the python interpreter I have a folder. Inside of this folder is an executable called python. When I try to run python from the terminal it instead runs the python interpreter. How can I run the file called python?\n\nA: Specify the path. If you're in the directory with the binary, that's as simple as:\n./python\n\nOr yes, do as Muru suggested and add it to the path. That said, changing the path could interfere with how applications (running under your user) call Python. If you deflect them to the wrong version, they may function incorrectly.\nThere is not a good way to override the global python.\nIt should point to the version that ships with Ubuntu.\n\nA: Along with the other answers you can also use the full path to the executable. For example, if your python executable is in /home/user/some_dir/python then running the following command from in the terminal will do the job:\nuser@user-home:~$ /home/user/some_dir/python\n\nFor ease of use you can create an alias for the above command so that you don't have to type the full path every time, by just appending the it in your .bashrc file. To do so, run the following commands in the terminal:\nuser@user-home:~$ echo \"alias local_python=/home/user/some_dir/python\" >> /home/user/.bashrc \nuser@user-home:~$ source /home/user/.bashrc \n\n****Important note: Here i have used local_python as the alias name, you can choose any name you want but don't use python or any other already installed binaries' names as name of the alias.\n", "Q: How can I rename files/change their extensions based on mimetype with a script? I'm hoping someone can explain to me how I can change a file type.  I recently uploaded my pictures onto my laptop and half of them are saved as a file and not an image meaning I cannot upload them onto websites for printing. \nI'm looking for step by step process and also if i can do them all at the same time or have they to be done individually. I have 500+ to change. \n\nA: You should be able to use the mimetype utility - from man mimetype:\nNAME\n       mimetype - Determine file type\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       mimetype [options] [-] files\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This script tries to determine the mime type of a file using the Shared\n       MIME-info database. It is intended as a kind of file(1) work-alike, but\n       uses mimetypes instead of descriptions.\n\nSo for example:\n$ mimetype somefile\nsomefile: image/jpeg\n\nHowever, by default, mimetype will \"believe\" the extension if present - so:\n$ cp somefile somefile.gif\n$ mimetype somefile.gif\nsomefile.gif: image/gif\n\nYou can tell it to use only the file's magic bytes to do the determination by adding the -M switch:\n$ mimetype -M somefile.gif\nsomefile.gif: image/jpeg\n\nand you can add -b to give a brief description:\n$ mimetype -bM somefile.gif\nimage/jpeg\n\n\nIf you wanted to script the renaming, I'd suggest something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile read -r -d '' f; do\n  mt=\"$(mimetype -bM \"$f\")\"\n  ext=\"${mt##*/}\"\n  case \"$ext\" in\n    jpeg|gif|png)\n      echo mv -v \"$f\" \"$f.$ext\"\n      ;;\n    *)\n    echo \"skipping mimetype $mt... \"\n      ;;\n  esac\ndone < <(find -type f -print0)\n\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*it doesn't actually rename anything as written: the echo mv just outputs what it would do - please check and double check that it is behaving as expected on your files before removing the echo\n\n*it only operates on jpeg,gif, and png files: if there are other image types, you will need to add those explicitly\n\n*it will rename (add an additional extension to) any files it considers to have the wrong extension, based on magic bytes\n\n\nThere may be other - easier - options using tools like exiftool\n", "Q: Can you automatically mount a partition when a program needs it?

I made set it up that way so that I can use the library both in windows and in Ubuntu. If the partition is not mounted calibre can't find the library and makes a new folder on the Linux partition. I have to manually mount my partition every time before starting calibre.\n\nA: I use the same thing, too, like this:\nExec=sh -c \"udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sda2; calibre %f\"\n\nThe udisksctl command does the same as if you would click on the drive in Nautilus, so it gets mounted to the standard position as your user. This way it doesn't require some sudo/root password and you are permitted to unmount it later, e.g. from Nautilus. Best way for me.\n\nA: Thanks to the help provided, this is what I came up with.\nCreate a script that checks if your partition is mounted, if not mount it.

For starters, it's just ugly - the font DPI is really low, and color schemes in don't look particularly good (I haven't been able to figure out how to configure it to have colors, yet). I also find myself wanting basic mouse support.\nAny suggestions for making Ubuntu Server a bit more workable for this? Is there I terminal emulator I can install without gnome that'll make me happy, or something more like gvim? Or should I give up and just install a full desktop environment?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I'm not terribly experienced with this, so I'm not sure what the rough edges are, but fbterm works for me on the rare occasion I don't boot into X. It comes with fairly basic gpm-like mouse support, meaning you can select and paste text, but I haven't succeeded in making Vim read the mouse like it would in an xterm.\nBasically you use a framebuffer driver for your video adapter; see this U&L question. Then install fbterm and run it; it is available in Ubuntu and is basically an improved console terminal with 256-color support.\nIt works best when it has unfettered read/write access to /dev/fb0, so make sure your user is in the group video; and its keyboard support also works best with the SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability, which means you have to run sudo setcap 'cap_sys_tty_config+ep' /usr/bin/fbterm. I'm guessing this capability goes away if the fbterm binary is replaced; hopefully someone can suggest a way around this. You could instead run it as root; the program's man page claims it drops root privileges soon after launching.\nMake sure to run Vim using TERM=fbterm so Vim doesn't get confused (fbterm uses 256-color codes that differ from xterm's). You can then use 256-color themes, or even GUI themes if you use something like CSApprox.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 can't connect to \"Wireless N\" signals I am using Ubuntu 14.10 on an Asus laptop -- and I can't connect to my wireless router if I have it set to the 2.4GHz Wireless N mode.

I'd like a program that works like Dolphin (the Kubuntu file manager) for copying, but when a file fails to copy I want it to re-mount the drive and repeat the attempt to copy the file. I can imagine writing a script for this myself in bash or python, but was wondering if there's already a utility out there which tries really hard to copy things!\n\nA: First, why is it un-mounting itself? I've seen filesystems with errors get remounted as read-only before... is it a filesystem error, or does the hard drive actually power itself down or \"reset\"? Look in your logs and check (/var/log/syslog or dmesg should help).\nIf it's a filesystem error, then mounting it as read-only (mount -o ro ...) should keep it mounted, since you won't be writing anything to it. Fixing the filesystem errors  might fix it, with a fsck tool, or if it's NTFS it may need a windows chkdsk to fix some errors. Unless there are hardware errors....\n\nIf there are hardware errors causing it to be un-mounted, then it's possible your drive is failing, and repeatedly mounting it read-write (rw) could be making it worse, possibly overwriting the data you want to save.

I am new to LINUX.\n\nA: you would have installed 32 bit linux os on your system. So, you have to write -m32 instead of -m64.\nInitially, i had the same problem u have posted. Now, it is working.\n", "Q: Upgrading VIM 7.3 to latest release via apt-get I'm currently using Ubuntu 12.04 and have Vim 7.3 installed and I want to update it to the latest version. I'm still new to how all these package manager stuff works, but I was wondering why can't I just do the following: \"sudo apt-get update vim\" ? I mean it was installed on the system initially, so why wouldn't one be able to just type a one liner to update vim? \nAlso I tried to do a search via: sudo apt-get search vim to see which one is installed and it doesnt seem to find it. How can someone find out what is the installed app so we can update it?\nRight now I just want to update this to the latest vim with least amount of commands required. \n\n\nA: \nI was wondering why can't I just do the following: \"sudo apt-get\n  update vim\" ?\n\nThe correct way of running it is sudo apt-get update. \nThis command resynchronize the package index files from server, so that information about new and updated packages is available.\nThe current version of Vim in Ubuntu 12.04 repository is 7.3. \nSo running sudo apt-get upgrade( which  is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the server) will not upgrade your Vim to it's latest release.\nHowever you can  install its latest version (i.e 7.4) by adding   the third party ppa.\nTo install it, open terminal and type\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:fcwu-tw/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\n(I have not tested it,but should work perfectly.)\n\nYou can also install the latest version of Vim by compiling it from the source.\nFor this see this answer\n\nI tried to do a search via: sudo apt-get search vim to see which one\n  is installed and it doesnt seem to find it\n\nYou can dpkg -s <packagename> to get the status of specified package which also include the version of installed package. \nIf you are intrested in version only refine your query using dpkg -s <packagename> | grep 'Version'\nFor eaxmaple\ndpkg -s vim | grep 'Version'\n\nUpdate\n\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS reached its regular End of Life on April 28, 2017. No\n  more package updates, including security updates, will be accepted to\n  the 12.04 primary archive.\n\n", "Q: New Ubuntu install - Resolution stuck at 640 x 480 I recently fixed an old laptop and replaced the screen and decided to install Ubuntu. Install went fine but when I log in the resolution changes from being normal, to 640 x 480. When I try to change the resolution in settings, the only setting available is 640 x480. \nMy graphics card is NVIDIA® GeForce GT 525M.\nKinda new to this so not really sure what other information would be helpful.\nThanks.\n\nA: I guess you're missing video drivers, try to install them from cli:\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia primus linux-headers-generic\nThen reboot.\n", "Q: compiz expo plugin - double-click time I use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Compiz 0.9.11. I configure plugins using CCSM, expo plugin has option Double-Click Time, how it should work ?  \n\nA: The value (time in millisecs) sets how long you may wait between two clicks and compiz would still recognize them as double-clicks.\nExample: value=500ms If you click/wait 450ms/click again, you performed a double click. If you waited 550ms instead, compiz would interpret your interaction as two separate clicks.\n", "Q: Create multiple aliases for localhost addresses on different ports I have some webapps running on my localhost that I can access by my web browser at different ports.\nFor example I have an IPython notebook server running on port 8888 (I can access it at http://localhost:8888), and a small flask app that listens on port 9000.\nI know that I can set an alias for localhost by modifying /etc/hosts, but what I would like to achieve here is to have different aliases for the different ports.\nFor example I would like to open my browser and use http://notebooks/instead of http://localhost:8888 and http://flaskapp rather than http://localhost:9000.\nIs there an easy way to do this?\n\nA: You'll have to use either some form of iptables destination-based forwarding rule, or use Apache or nginx as a proxy. For nginx:\nsudo apt-get install nginx\n\nCreate a virtual server configuration of the form:\nserver {\n    server_name notebooks;\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:8888;\n        proxy_redirect default;\n    }\n    access_log /var/log/nginx/notebook-access.log;\n    error_log /var/log/nginx/notebook-error.log;\n}\n\nThis can be done by editing the default site (/etc/nginx/sites-available/default), or by creating a new file in that directory (/etc/nginx/sites-available/notebook, for example). Use your favourite editor with admin privileges (sudo vim, sudo -H gedit, etc.). \nThen enable the site by creating a link in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/, if it doesn't already exist:\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-{available,enabled}/default\n# or, if you created a new file:\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-{available,enabled}/notebook\n\nRestart nginx:\nsudo service nginx restart\n\nEdit /etc/hosts so that you have an alias with the same name used for server_name in the above configuration.\nYou can create many more such virtual servers for proxying to various ports.\n\nI'm not too sure of my iptables-fu, but some simple redirections seem to work well for me. For example, with a simple Python web server (python3 -m http.server 8888):\niptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d notebooks --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8888\n\nThe command is easy to understand:\n\n\n*\n\n*-A OUTPUT -p tcp to match outgoing TCP traffic.\n\n*-d notebooks and --dport 80 to match the destination hostname and port. The port isn't necessary here, since you'll likely be using only one port anyway.\n\n*-j REDIRECT --to-ports 8888 to use the REDIRECT chain, with 8888 as the target port for redirection. You can only use this chain with the nat table.\n\n*An entry for notebooks should exist in /etc/hosts before you apply this rule.\n\n", "Q: Printing line-drawing chars from dosemu I'm running an old DOS office suite under dosemu in Ubuntu 14.04. Everything seems to work fine except that I can't manage to print the line-drawing characters which form part of the cp437 character set characteristic of DOS. \nI am able to to print to my USB printer and also to the cups-pdf printer, but in both cases these special characters appear as others with accents and umlauts, obviously from a different character set. \nIn the dosemu configuration file, .dosemurc which I copied to my home directory, I set the following:\n$_external_char_set = \"utf8\"\n$_internal_char_set = \"cp437\"\n\nIf I save the office file to a text file within dosemu, the characters appear correctly if I use EDIT. Then from Ubuntu, I can use iconv to convert the character set, but this is not the best solution as then I can't print any graphics characters which might be in the original file.\nDoes anyone have any ideas how I can fix my character set problems?\n\nA: Wow!  Trip down to memory lane...  \nThis is a typical PC-DOS problem that was never decently solved on DOS either.  This depended (and apparently still depends) entirely on your printer supporting cp437...\nThe only way I ever solved this problem 25 years ago was to use the IBM ProPrinter or the Tandy DMP-80 as those were one of the few printers that supported cp437.\nThat being said, depending on the DOS application you're using, you might still find printers (Epson comes to mind) that wrote \"drivers\" for some of the applications (Lotus 1-2-3 comes to mind) that did a simple translation of the cp437 to their internal character set.  \n(Epson never solved the problem of the line drawing characters in a decent way, so don't run out and buy one of them right now!)\n", "Q: Disable public access to my apache2 server I've just installed apache2 on my Ubuntu 14.04\nMy server is now accessible from anywhere if the right IP was provided. I want to disable that so that only users within my local network would be able to access the server. \nI presume it has to be done from apache2.conf\nP.S. I am sure this question has been asked before, but I think I lack the correct keywords to find a previous post :) \n\nA: Maybe is better to enable firewall?\nUFW can allow access from host/network and deny for the rest of the world.\nsudo ufw enable\nsudo ufw allow from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/zz to any port 80 proto tcp\n\nxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - represent your local network, zz reprezent network mask\nYou can list rules with command\nsudo ufw status\nor\nsudo ufw status numbered\n\nA: I found it! \nsudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\nScroll down till <Directory /var/www/>\nAdd these two lines before </Directory>\nDeny from all\nAllow from 127.0.0.1\n\nThis will deny access from any IP except 127.0.0.1, which is your own machine. If your network's IP is in the form of 192.168.x.x  then allowing access from 192.168. will allow access to anyone in your network.\n", "Q: etc/passwd cannot be found I can't find the etc/passwd file on my Ubuntu computer. I know I shouldn't try to mess with it now, but when I was I couldn't find it. Yet I can still access my computer. \nDid they hide it in the 14.04 version? Should I be worried?\n\nA: You refer to \"etc/passwd\" - note the missing \"/\" at the beginning.\nSince you repeat this path twice with the same \"mistake\" - perhaps it is not a typo but the source of your problem. So my answer is relevant if indeed you miss the \"/\" at the beginning:\n\"passwd\" is located under the absolute path \"/etc/\". If you look for \"etc/passwd\" you are actually looking for that file in the relative path to your current working directory. Assuming your current directory is not the root (/) then you are looking at the wrong place (your_current_dir/etc/passwd).\n", "Q: Help, I May Have a Rootkit It's been a while since I have been here. I have been very preoccupied with trying to sort out endless problems with my devices getting hacked. I have a bridge set up on my home network. It is a TP-Link 841N, and I had wds enabled, connected as a client on my network. Nmap tells me that port 22 is open, and I have tried to reflash the firmware several times, downloading it through many different proxies, including two openvpn servers, my cellular connection, and the tor network. I also recently had to have my vps provider pgp me a new password because the openvz web panel kept getting hacked. This happened 3 or 4 times, and my provider had to reset the password.

ran a propupdate, and rkhunter sure is giving me a lot of warnings. The promiscious interface warning was not showing up earlier. Can someone with more expertise please help me decipher these results? I know the suckit rootkit can be a false positive, but Rkhunters is making me nervous, along with all the strange activity I've dealt with on my vps, which was also a tor exit node for a long time. Thanks.\n(Update 1/19/15) I took your advice and removed the lines stating nothing was infected, and  upgraded rkhunter.

For me, I had to add the users to the audio and pulse-access groups, and to do so, you'll need sudo rights and a graphical user interface, or a text editor. In my case, I use vim from the terminal. You may wish to use gedit:\n    evilsupahfly@black-beast:~$ sudo vim /etc/group\n    (enter sudo password)\n\nFind the audio and pulse-access groups (only one group listed per line) and append the users to the list, each with a comma but no space:\n    audio:x:29:pulse,evilsupahfly,doc-brown,marty_mcfly\n    ...\n    pulse-access:x:123:evilsupahfly,doc-brown,marty_mcfly\n\nDon't change any other groups, and don't erase anything that's already there. Just add the names so they make a list like mine, above (obviously not with those names) and save your changes. After that, usually, logging out and back in will restore sound, but sometimes you need a full-on reboot.\nEdit: Some non-Unity desktop environments, like Cinnamon (to name just one), will allow you to manage the group settings right from the user settings control panel, but sadly, default Unity doesn't (see screenshot) requiring you to manually edit /etc/group to make the changes.\n\n", "Q: Keyboard occasionally stops working, mouse works I have a user whose keyboard occasionally stops working until the system is rebooted.

I have a process (TRAIN) that turns and I have also started kdevelop and tried to build some application. Then it has frozen. Everything has frozen, no mouse, no changing desktop (Ctrl+Alt+arrow). I have also tried Alt+F2, or Ctrl+Alt+F1, but nothing happens. I have also tried the Alt+PrtScr and R+E+I+S+U+B, but nothing. I have a French keyboard that has no SysRq and Fx buttons are available when pressing Fn, it's very strange... Is there any other thing that I can try? I do not want to loose the process TRAIN that turns from 4 dais and is training an image classifier; it is almost finishing its job (one more day)...\nThanks.\n\nA: If the DE has frozen, switch to a different run-level by using ctrl-alt-f3 and login to the terminal presented. You can kill any offending processes by using kill or killall, if the DE has gone into hardlock it may be worthwhile to kill xorg by sudo killall Xorg to restart the DE (usually drops you back to the DM to login),switch back to the graphic run-level with ctrl-alt-f7. \nIf you are unable to stop the offending process as described you can also try to enable ctrl-alt-backspace to kill the xserver without swapping run-levels, as a last-ditch effort to avoid a reboot on a hard hang. \nAs others have said, it may be worthwhile to pull the latest version of the software if the crashes are predictable and regular - indicating a bug (if it is not available on the repo, check ppa's or learn to install from source), however this may not always be possible so knowing how to recover a system without a hard reset is useful. \nThere are options available to restrict the ability for an application to crash the system, at the most basic you can attempt to run the offending process with nice to lower the priority so that attempts to lock down resources won't affect other processes. Depending on the exact sequence of calls leading to the crash there may be other ways to sandbox the application to avoid this repeating hang.\nEDIT: Personally I use LXC for lightweight virtual sandboxes to keep development environments seperate from the base system, it may be helpful in your case  to do the same, graphical applications use their own instance of Xorg and so crashes won't take down your host system, access to graphical output is easily achieved with xpra (and since the sandbox is running locally you have no latency issues with forwarding X over ssh). You may also see the answers to this question for other options on sandboxing\nFURTHER THOUGHTS: If X has hung and is not responding to keyboard input (but the os itself hasn't crashed), you can also attempt to kill the process remotely via sshor other remote console system.\n\nA: Open a System Monitor from Dash -> Go to 1st tab Processes. You can kill any process there, just right click on the process you want to kill and select kill process.\n\nA: If you know this process/program always crashes your computer (TRAIN or kdevelop or other), then you really should stop running it. Check for an updated version that might not crash everything, otherwise un-installing / removing it would be a good idea.\nIf you absolutely must run it, I'd suggest running Ubuntu in a VM (Virtual Machine, like VirtualBox) and run the unstable program/process inside of it. At least then when it crashes it should only freeze the VM and let your computer continue to operate.\nAnd look into your SysRq key, should be available in case of emergencies next time.\n", "Q: How to install .dmg file to ubuntu I'm trying to install a .dmg file to ubuntu 14.04\nI was trying to following \neHow Link\nAnd a couple of other threads on askubuntu. \nThe problem i'm facing are so :\n\n\n*\n\n*In the eHow they use something called dmg2dmg.

So, how can I change this.\nI don't mean to change the syntax highlight style, just change the \"highlight current line\" color.\n\nA: I have 14.04, but gedit over there has an option to change color scheme --- the preferences menu is quite hidden (at least in gnome-shell), you have to go on the panel menu to find it: \n \n(will be different in Unity), and then: \n \nand all your color scheme will change. In the shot above, I choose \"kate\". \nIf you want to change just the color of the highlight line (for example), you should edit the style; in principle that should be easily done by changing the file \n/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/kate.xml \n\n(reference here) and change the line \n<style name=\"current-line\"                background=\"#EEF6FF\"/>\n\nto your liking.

To gain root privileges for system administration, an admin user (member of usergroup sudo) may use the sudo command to run 1 command as root.\nSo if you did not give root a password for any reason, the password sudo is asking for is your own, the same you need to type for login.

However, while attempting to boot from the linux-3.18.2 version, I am noticing a poor display resolution in my GUI. Also, my monitor tries to adjust the screen display size (every time while loading the login prompt after boot) but ends up truncating part of the screen.\nPlease suggest any settings changes that can help here.\n\nA: I guess the issue might be with the default configurations that I used during the new kernel build process.  I was able to resolve the issue with these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*After rebooting with new kernel image (V3.18.2), i went to Settings > Display and tested with various available resolutions. Changing the resolution to 1366x768 worked in my case.\n\n*After applying the new resolution, A pop-up prompts you to confirm that you want the new resolution to be set as the default.

I want to create two more primary partitions on unallocated space.\nsda1 primary\nsda2 primary\nsda3 unallocated\nsda4 extended\n\n\nA: \nIs it possible to create more than one extended partitions? \n\nNo. You can have per harddisk ...\n\n\n*\n\n*4 primary partitions or\n\n*3 primary partitions and 1 extented partition.\n\n\nThe extended partition though can have a 'limitless' amount of logical partitions on Ubuntu. Nowadays the kernel can allocate device numbers dynamically (through udev) and the system will happily use 2 or more letters after reaching sdz. Though there will be a limit someone has tested this up to sdzzz and the idea is that it is safe up to 29 z's (though untested and there are people doubting it all their proof seems to have been deleted).\n\nYou can creat partitions from gParted but the partitions need to be unmounted (so you can not change the root partition from a running system). Boot from either an Ubuntu Live DVD or a Gparted Live DVD, start up gParted and shrink your partitions so you get unallocated space. Unallocated space needs to be adjacent to each other to create a big unallocated space. If you shrink sda1 and want that free space as part of sda3 you need to add it to sda2 and shrink sda2. That unallocated space can then be divided into partitions. You can have 1 more primary partition (I expect you'd use sda3 for that; but the 4th one will be impossible and needs to be added to the extended partition to create a logical partition).\nUbuntu (Unix/Linux in general) does not have any restrictions on where you can put the OS part of the installation. So any of these can be used to install Ubuntu (or any Linux based system).\nAlways create a backup when altering partitions. Making a fatal mistake is easily done but a power failure is always a possibility.\n\nIf we are talking modern systems there is also GUID Partition Table (or GPT). The default maximum number of partitions is 128, and if your operating system supports it you can have more\nNo more hacks to force yourself to a primary/extended/logical partitioning scheme.  When you are GParted and want to use GPT, just select the gpt option when formatting. \nThe differences between MBR and GPT are summed up nicely on the IBM site. \n\nA: In a MBR? No. But inside the one extended partition you can create dozens (maybe hundreds?) of other partitions. And can expand/shrink partitions using gparted, fyi.\n", "Q: How can I differentiate between two systems at startup menu I have two internal Hard disks 500GB each.

I have dual-boot system. Now, I want to erase all packages and all home's files on my Kubuntu, i.e I need 100% clean system. I decided to make a bootable usb-stick. I tried to boot from it, got GRUB-menu with 3 options (1.Start Kubuntu 2.bla-bla(for manufactures) 3.Check for defects). I choosed first one. Then I'm getting kubuntu logo hanging for infinite time. I've done this before, why I can't do this now? BTW, all 2 OSes (Kubuntu and Windows) are working, so I can use them. \nAnd I wanna ask - is there an option to do it with installer from desktop or whatever, but without booting from usb? If not, how I can fix problem booting from usb?\n\nA: Seems to me I've run into that problem with a bad USB write from a good file -- unetbootin sometimes changes an ISO in a way that prevents it from booting successfully; dd makes a faithful copy that, in my experience, always works.  It's also possible for a damaged partition to cause this kind of failure; recreating the partition table on the flash drive usually corrects that problem. If the MD5 is good, those are the two things to look for.\n", "Q: Problem during ubuntu installation: Realtek PXE always boots instead? I am trying to install ubuntu on my Toshiba Satellite by booting it from a USB. I was eventually able to get the installer to load; I had to change my boot mode to CSM and use a specific USB port for whatever reason. The ubuntu installer was working fine, but my friend noticed during installation that I hadn't partitioned my hard drive correctly. I decided to quit the installer, with the intention of loading Windows to fix the partition problem.\nHowever, when I quit the installer a black screen appeared that persisted for several minutes. In frustration I did a hard shut off, which in retrospect was a bad decision: now, my Realtek PXE will always boot first, no matter what I do!\nFor example, if I start my computer and press F12, a menu of devices I can boot from appears. Already there is a problem: the names of the devices are usually messed up. For example, my USB might be called Realtek PXE and my ODD might be called SanDisk! The only device whose name is always correct is the hard drive.\nNo matter which device I select to boot, and no matter whether the names are correct or not, my Realtek PXE will boot instead. If I go into BIOS settings and change the boot order, PXE will still boot instead. In order to load windows, I have to change boot mode to UEFI and boot my hard drive. PXE still boots instead, but the screen says PXE over IPv4. Press ENTER to exit. (That may not be the exact wording.) If I press ENTER a few times, Windows will load.\nDoes anyone have any idea how I can fix this? I know that this isn't an ubuntu question per se, but this issue came about during ubuntu installation so perhaps someone has had the same problem before.\n\nA: So it seems the problem has resolved itself, though I'm not sure how. I literally kept trying to boot from my USB over and over and eventually it worked, though I didn't change anything. I'm actually typing this from ubuntu now!\nI'll update this question if things go south again.\n", "Q: How to use joy2key in Ubuntu 14.04 with Binding of Isaac Linux? I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and I have encountered this strange issue with Binding of Isaac and joy2key.\nThe problem is, that I seem not to be able to connect joy2key and Isaac, which were installed using a .deb package from The Humble Bundle. The joy2key is properly configured and I do see the correct instructions in the terminal window, nevertheless the character does not move (works with keyboard).\nIncidentally, I have an old installation of Isaac using Steam in WINE and the same configuration of joy2key works as intended.\nThe .deb version is installed to the /opt folder. Could this cause some access rights issues (I'm not a power-user, but maybe something with my account vs X access rights)?\nThis is obviously not a high priority issue, but some assistance would be great.\n\nA: I had the same issue. My pad would work with other games but not with Binding of Isaac. I finally chose to install AntiMicro to remap my pad so one stick matches asdw and the other the arrow keys.\nThis is not the best solution in my opinion but at least it works.\nHere are the downloads of AntiMicro\nhttps://github.com/Ryochan7/antimicro/releases\nBe careful, in my case, one package was missing.

Either...\n\n\n*\n\n*You're not in the same directory as your hello.c file. cd to the right directory, or use provide gcc with the path to the file:\ngcc /home/oli/Desktop/hello.c -o hello\n\nNote the same applies to the -o output path. If you leave it as hello it will try to write to the current working directory (/home/$USER/ by default). Either change directory or provide a full path.\n\n*Or you've called it HellO.C (Ubuntu's filesystems are case sensitive).\n\n*hello.c never existed.

It's something you'll learn but yeah, commands don't just work globally and not all files live in the same directory. You have to specify where stuff is.\n\nA: You should first check the path properly, Whether your c file does exist in this folder or not. For that, you can use ls command to list out all the files in this particular folder. \nAnd for seeing the path for the folder, You can use pwd.\nHope this will help you. Because to compile the c file you have entered the right command only.\n\nA: I had the same problem while using CMakeLists to compile some C programs.

However, when I connect the cord from my server to my laptop using the laptops' Ethernet connected to connect through my Wifi connection the server will get an IP address from DHCP via the laptop. Lastly, after I get an IP from the laptop connection I use the following commands and then DHCP works when the cord is connected from the wall to the server:\nsudo dhclient -r\nsudo dhclient -v eth0\n\nThe next time I restart the server via sudo shutdown -r now the server will not be able to get an IP again from DHCP with the cord from the wall to the server.\nNote that when i assign a static address in /etc/network/interfaces file the network will not assign it the IP and the interface will be down.\nQuestion\nIs there a way to fix the problem I am having with my network not being able to discover the DHCP server when I power on the server?\nIf you need more information please let me know.\nAdditional Information\ndhclient before connecting to laptop\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 3 (xid=0x********)\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 3 (xid=0x********)\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 6 (xid=0x********)\n...\nNo DHCPOFFERS received\nNo working leases in persistent database - sleeping.\n\ndhclient with server connected to laptop\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 3 (xid=0x*********)\nDHCPREQUEST of 192.168.137.233 on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 (xid=0x*********)\nDHCPOFFER of 192.168.137.233 from 192.168.137.1\nDHCPACK of 192.168.137.233 from 192.168.137.1\nbound to 192.168.137.233 -- renewal in 275 seconds.\n\nifconfig eth0\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:22:64:23:7c:da  \n          inet addr:192.168.137.233  Bcast:192.168.137.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::222:64ff:fe23:7cda/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:28265 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:2781 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:4655957 (4.6 MB)  TX bytes:415144 (415.1 KB)\n\ndhclient after laptop DHCP and cord reconnected from wall to server\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 3 (xid=0x********)\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 8 (xid=0x********)\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 15 (xid=0x********)\nDHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 11 (xid=0x********)\nDHCPREQUEST of 192.168.1.126 on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 (xid=0x*******)\nDHCPOFFER of 192.168.1.126 from 192.168.1.254\nDHCPACK of 192.168.1.126 from 192.168.1.154\nbound to 192.168.1.126 -- renewal in 41950 second.\n\nifconfig eth0\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:22:64:23:7c:da  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.126  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::222:64ff:fe23:7cda/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:33438 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:3391 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:5245215 (5.2 MB)  TX bytes:550462 (550.4 KB)\n\nnetwork interface (lshw)\nsudo lshw -class network\n\n  *-network\n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller\n       vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:02:00.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: 02\n       serial: 00:22:64:23:7c:da\n       size: 100Mbit/s\n       capacity: 1Gbit/s\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress msix vpd bus_master cap_list rom ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd 1000bt 1000bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=r8169 driverversion=2.3LK-NAPI duplex=full ip=192.168.1.82 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes port=MII speed=100Mbit/s\n       resources: irq:42 ioport:e800(size=256) memory:febff000-febfffff memory:fdff0000-fdffffff memory:febc0000-febdffff\n\nUpdate:\nMy /etc/network/interfaces file is as such\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nI found a temporary fix that seems to work but I would not like it to be my solution if we can solve this problem.

(again this is more me getting on myself for missing this first and only thinking of it second.  I did not mean to come across harsh if that's how it sounds)\nThere are 2 different types of wire you're using here...\nReference:\nhttps://www.computercablestore.com/straight-through-crossover-and-rollover-wiring\nFirst is a Straight Through ethernet cable used for switches and routers to client computers\nSecond is a Cross over cable:  These are used for machine to machine connections and are physically wired differently!\nSo, if that cables works between your server and laptop with no switch or router in between the 2 (WiFi connection DOES NOT count here at all for anything) that cable has got to be a cross over.  \nGet a standard Straight Through Cable and connect from the router to the server and see what happens.\nIn my experience computer issues boil down to the most simple of overloooked issues.  Some routers and switches are \"smart\" and may try to make internal adjustments when you use the incorrect cable (crossover) so you can still use it to connect the machine, but that is never something to rely on and is more likely to be the issue.\nUh actually this sounds like a router issue.  I for instance have FiOS and in the router I can go and look at network settings and I see where it bridges the WiFi and Wired segments seperately to the DHCP server so if something were to happen to that setting I could end up with what you have here you can't get an IP over the Wire anymore cause it is not connected to the \"Home\" network running the DHCP server, but you can over WiFi as that is still connected to the \"home\" network within the router.  You can either attempt to look through the advanced settings of your router or more often than not if you have a paperclip  and there's a reset pin push button you can look up how to factory reset it (usually hold paperclip in reset button for like 30 secs).\nAlso your laptop is getting assigned an IP via WiFi Only.  If you have a machine and it has both a wired and wifi adapter and you have WiFi connected and plug a wire in even if that fails your machine will still surf the internet fine and what not cause it is routing all requests via WiFi and ignoring the wired port altogether.\nYour \"fix\" works because you are requesting an IP via the Laptops Wifi adapter in the end.\nFrom reading more here I also notice it maybe a MAC security feature you enabled on the router...  This means that unless the MAC address of your NIC is within the allowed list of clients your router would refuse to give it an address.  You may \"fix that by first going through the laptop which is on the list and once you get an addreess that way when you connect back to the wall and throw another request it may skip the MAC check since it sees it already gave you an address and at lest temporarily thinks your server is a trusted client.  I would also check any MAC security you enabled within the router.\nI am not saying it is impossible for your routers DHCP server to have some odd issue but this would be SOO SUPER RARE I can't tell you how rare.\n", "Q: Touchpad Stopped Working After Hibernate I used the command pm-hibernate to see if my notebook would successfully resume after hibernating. Upon resume it went through the BIOS screen, I had to reselect Ubuntu from the Grub menu, but then it went back into the desktop right were I left off, it seemed fine except the touchpad didn't work. I rebooted, and the touchpad still didn't work. x-input --list did not list a touchpad, only \"Virtual core pointer\" with \"Virtual core XTEST pointer\" listed under that. A mouse plugged into the USB port worked just fine. After another reboot or two, I went into recovery mode and selected the repair broken packages option, however it would not initialize the wireless adapter to get a network connection so it would not repair any packages. I explicitly told it to set up the network connection by selecting the option \"Use Network Connection\", which also failed to do anything, so so then I did what any normal person would do, I shut my system down and went to sleep thinking about that one printer scene from Office Space...\nWhen I woke up this morning, I booted into Recovery Mode again, couldn't really think of anything to do so I told it to start Ubuntu normally, and lo and behold my touchpad is back. I rebooted to make sure it would work booting from Grub and not just from the Recovery Console and it still works. Now xinput --list shows SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad plain as day, and everything is working fine, multitouch, gestures, the whole shebang. \nSo what's the deal? Does anybody have a clue what happened? Is there a way I can figure out what happened, or a specific approach I can take in the future should the problem reoccur? \n\nA: If your hardware is incompatible with the standard Ubuntu pm-hibernate, you might want to check out TuxOnIce.  That is a very sophisticated hibernation program with its own PPA. \nThat being said: you should never install a PPA because someone told you so (including me) until you've done some research and made a sound, personal judgement as to what the risks are.  \nYou should also remember that a 1000+ user like tuxonice recommended by 1000s of users is more likely (but not surely) safer then the 15-user ppa.maffia.ru/botnet/ppa/ubuntu.\n", "Q: Sound Problems ubuntu 14.04 LTS I have a little problem with Ubuntu...

So I just created a softlink/shortcut in the Anaconda library to the actual Linux library containing that GLIBCXX_3.4.20, replacing the previous one, and it worked fine after restarting the python GUI (Spyder).\nThere should be a folder called libstdc++.so.6 in the Anaconda library, which is here: ~/anaconda2/lib. Within this folder is the versions of the script/library-code-thing, excluding the one that you're missing: GLIBCXX_3.4.20 \nFollow these steps to solve the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*go to the right location and backup your current anaconda2 shortcut (change its name so it isn't overwritten):\ncd ~/anaconda2/lib\nmv -vf libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.old\n\n\n*create a new shortcut using the ln command (I am assuming that I am in the previous location ~/anaconda2/lib):\nln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 ./libstdc++.so.6\n\n\n*restart spyder / other interface you use\nIt should now work!\n\nA: I was having the same problem when trying to run other program, and found a solution on StackOverflow. \nBasically, just do the following commands:\nFirstly, install:\nsudo apt-get install libstdc++6\n\nThis should already be installed by default, but try it anyway.\nIf it doesn't solve it, just do the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nI didn't perform the \"dist-upgrade\" command, but the ones before solved it for me\n\nA: sudo cp /usr/bin/YourGccVersionLibrary/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/bin/YourGccVersionLibrary/lib64/libstdc++.so.6.0.20 /usr/lib/x86_64_linux-gnu/\n\n\nA: I had the same issue while installing Ubuntu 18.04 in Virtualbox with the live-server image.

(for other readers, the files inside an installed package can be listed with dpkg -L openvpn.)\nI can recommend you to use Network Manager which has an OpenVPN plugin. There you can put the certificates, host, etc. of your VPN provider. If you have none and want to setup the server and client, have a look at How do I setup OpenVPN so I can securely use the internet from an unsecured hotspot?

Whenever I put the disk in the computer nothing happens... If I go to archive manager > open > devices I see the disk but when i click on setup.exe it says \"and error occurred while loading the archive\" How do I open the disk so that I can install windows? \n\nA: You cannot install it while using Ubuntu. Insert the disc,switch off the computer with the disc inside and turn on your computer. Thus you should get to the installation menu of your disc. \n", "Q: Touchpad Not Detected When USB HDD Plugged In at Boot Ubuntu doesn't recognize my touchpad if I boot with my external drive connected to the USB port. Why would this be the case? Where should I look to start troubleshooting the issue and how can I tell it to not do that anymore? When I have an actual USB mouse plugged in I can use the mouse OR the touchpad so it's not that it thinks the drive is a mouse or anything. The touchpad does not show up in xinput --list when this happens.\nEdit: I am using Ubuntu version 14.04, it is the OS running on the internal drive. I did not mean that I actually booted from the external drive, I mean that I booted my system while the external drive was connected to the USB port. That probably didn't have anything to do with it, it was just the only parameter that was different during this particular boot. The problem is recurring and intermittent. The first time it happened it was upon waking up from pm-hibernate, subsequently it randomly happens when I boot, it just doesn't detect the touchpad at all. \nThe only common variable seems to be that it happens when I reboot into Ubuntu from Windows, but again I want to emphasize that may not necessarily be the case. Other times I boot into Ubuntu after being in Windows and the touchpad works fine. It does actually seem unlikely because my notebook has two separate internal SSD's so I am booting Ubuntu/Windows from entirely separate physical disks.\nI worked my way through the troubleshooting steps on another post and it did not work. The synclient program says Couldn't find synaptics properties. No synaptics driver loaded?. xinput list lists the USB optical mouse but not the touchpad. \nThis seems to me like it should be pretty straightforward to troubleshoot. I know the synaptics driver exists because my touchpad works sometimes. So where is it and how do I load it? How can I see a raw list of what input devices are connected to my system, not just the ones that have drivers loaded? Doesn't the kernel check what hardware is present when it boots, and then pass that information to a module that loads drivers? So can't I just manually load the driver?\n\nA: Looks like Windows doesn't reset all its settings when it shuts down and the warm boot of the tablet doesn't either.  (I predict this never happens when cold booting)\nSo to \"reset\" the mouse the best is to file this as a BIOS bug to the manufacturer, (or upgrade the BIOS if one is available) but in the mean time, do the following:\nWhen it works, do an lsmod |sort > ~/Documents/MouseWorking.txt and when is doesn't an lsmod |sort > ~/Documents/MouseNotWorking.txt, then diff MouseNotWorking.txt MouseWorking.txt and look for the differences.\nthen:\nsudo modprobe MissingModule\n\nIf none are missing (50/50 chance, as this looks like a BIOS bug) try:\nsudo rmmod psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse\n\nand then you'll have a 75% chance of working around this issue.\nI realise this is not a \"solution\" (the BIOS upgrade is) and just a workaround, but it's something...\n", "Q: I Ran startx From Terminal as SU Now I Can't Log In I ran startx while in SU mode from terminal while already logged into Ubuntu desktop. This was probably really stupid, I know. The screen immediately went completely black. I rebooted, now every time I go to log in the screen flashes black for a second then takes me back to the login screen. I tried the solution here but that did not work for me as it did not regenerate the .ICEconfig file, now the file is just gone and I still can't log in. Guest account works fine. I can't find any other information on this subject. Please don't let me have to go back to Windows guys. I need some help here.\n\nA: Basically what happened is that invoking the startx command as a super user changed ownership of the .Xauthority file to root. .Xauthority is a 'magic cookie' file that authenticates clients requesting access to the X display server. What that means is that when you first log in, the X display server needs to authenticate your identity before it gives you access to the X Window system, i.e. your desktop. A more detailed explanation can be found here, while the solution I found can be found here.\nWhat worked for me was using CTRL + ALT + F1 from the login screen to get to a terminal, login from the terminal, and then:\nsudo chown user:user ~/.Xauthority where user:user is your username followed by a colon, then your username again. If that seems complicated or doesn't work for some reason, you can just delete the file altogether using sudo rm ~/.Xauthority and from now on you can just do everything from the command line. I'm just kidding it will regenerate the file when required and the new file will have the correct permissions.\nHope this helps as the issue made me panic at first but turned out to be a relatively simple fix, and I learned a little bit about how display servers work in the process.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 not responding I was reinstall Ubuntu, remove Window OS, Format all my HHD and when Im using computer normal, I dont open more program( include: FireFox, Skype), on FireFox I opened 8 tabs. program run in background include Apache, php, mySQL, ibus Unikey.\nMy computer have structure:\nHHD: 1Tb include three partitions (all have Patition type Ext4)\n\n\n*\n\n*swap: /dev/sda1 => 7,2 GB\n\n*filesystem: /dev/sda2  => 102 GB\n\n*Extended Partition: /dev/sda3 =>  891 GB\n+) Data: /dev/sda5 => 307 GB \n+) Develop: /dev/sda6 => 583 GB\nRAM: 2.5GB\nMain: Gigabyte G41\nChip Core 2 Dou.\nthe first time, I cant use keybroad, light on keyroad is Off, after about 5 second, light on mouse Off too and I must hard reset computer.\nPlease help me.

A while back I was having trouble because my power indicator for my laptop running Ubuntu never warned me when the power was about to go off. That was when using Ubuntu 14.04, and to be honest, I can't be sure if the answer provided led to a solution or if the problem just went away on its own. I'm now on Ubuntu 14.10 (Gnome Flashback with Compiz), and the problem has returned, although I can't be sure if it's directly correlated with the upgrade or if it's something else.\nThe current situation is that when I'm using my power, most of the time the power will shut off abruptly, without warning, and when, as far as I can tell, I should have at least an hour of power remaining, according to the power indicator. Sometimes the battery icon indicator goes red, but in my estimation that only happens about a quarter of the time. I never get any pop up messages, ever.\nIt could be that my computer is crashing sometimes because of some other issue not related to power, though it seems fairly consistent that when it happens, it's around when the battery has about an hour left. It might be that my my power reading is off, and it thinks I have more power than I do. Or maybe it's just that the power warning settings are simply not doing anything most of the time. Or something else.\nIn any case, how do I get my power warnings to be consistent about giving me a heads up before my laptop suddenly shuts off right in the middle of when I'm working?\nThese settings may be relevant:\n$ gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-low\n10\n$ gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-critical\n3\n$ gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-action\n2\n$ gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power use-time-for-policy\ntrue\n\n\nA: Do you always:\n\n\n*\n\n*Completely discharge your battery before charging it again?\n\n*Leave the battery in a dark, cool, dry space when you don't need it (like when working from office/home)\n\n*Always fully charge your battery and only then remove the power cords?\n\n\nIf the above is three times \"no\", then your battery is busted!\nIf the above is three times \"yes\": is your battery older then 6 years?

The ODD and CPU fans run at full speed. To get them down to minimum speed in Ubuntu I need to set the speeds in the Terminal, using this method. Rather than do this after every boot, I made a bash script to do it for me, but it doesn't work.\nThis is my script:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Beginning script...\"\necho \"Logging in as root...\"\nsudo su\ncd /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/\necho \"Enabling manual override for Fan 1 (ODD fan)...\"\necho '1' > fan1_manual\necho \"Setting speed of Fan 1 (ODD fan) to 1650 RPM...\"\necho '1650' > fan1_output\necho \"Enabling manual override for Fan 3 (CPU fan)...\"\necho '1' > fan3_manual\necho \"Setting speed of Fan 3 (CPU fan) to 1200 RPM...\"\necho '1200' > fan3_output\necho \"Done.\"\n\nThe problem is at \"sudo su\". It prompts for a password, but after entering the password, nothing happens. It just halts.\nHere is a screenshot\n\nA: Your script halts because sudo su starts a new shell process. Your original shell process - the one that is running your script - is waiting for the sub-shell to end.\nI propose to run whole script with root privileges instead of asking to log in as root from script itself. Remove sudo su part from your code and run script like that:\n$ sudo ./yourscript\n\nThis is common practice.

I have an Acer Aspire laptop with an AMD 6850M graphics card. On previous versions of Ubuntu, the proprietary drivers have worked perfectly fine, but since upgrading to 12.04 and then to 14.04 (64 bit for both), each time I try to install it via additional hardware or install the drivers using the latest beta or stable version following the instructions from cchtml Ubuntu will not boot as soon as I restart the laptop.\nI've tried doing this on Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Linux Mint and have the same issue with all three distros. Has anyone experienced something like this before? If so, please help :)\n\nA: I have had problems in the past installing proprietary graphics drivers as none of the published guides seemed to work for me. \nI eventually came up with a method that has worked for me on the last couple of versions of Ubuntu and on several different machines.

Other users have exactly the same problem on launchpad. I don't think I can progress any further for this one unfortunately.\n\nA: Richard. I seem to have made it to a step beyond you on this issue. This problem seems most prevalent among users who have hybrid graphics: integrated Intel card for power conservation and an AMD card for performance. To get past this problem, I found a hacked version of my HP 2XXX series BIOS, by a guy named Donovan. The hacked version allowed me to choose muxed/muxless and fixed/dynamic in the BIOS.\nBy changing my BIOS to muxless dynamic (look it up if this terminology is new), I am running the fglrx-updates (proprietary) drivers. The laptop's screen was stuck on the highest brightness. You may need to find a solution for this. I found some instructions on editing some text in a settings document.\nLastly, and this is an issue I haven't overcome, in muxless dynamic mode, my Intel processor is supposed to function all the time. When the graphics gets too intensive, the extra load is supposed to be offloaded to the AMD card. Mine isn't working this way, though. Instead, I can load games like League of Legends (installed through Play on Linux & Wine). The load screens all work great and I can start a game. The moment the match starts and it attempts to go into full screen mode, everything disappears. So, the hybrid graphics situation stinks for people with AMD cards (mine has a Radeon HD 6850m). Good luck.\n", "Q: grep - highlight inside a highlight I'm facing difficulties while trying to multicolor-highlight matches using grep's color environment.\nAfter I stumbled across Colored grep, I found it very useful to highlight multiple pattern in a single run.\nSo I set up the alias' as told, but then I came across following problem:\necho \"Im looking for KeyWords\" | grep 'KeyWords' --color=always | green-grep 'Word'\n\nresults in\nIm looking for Key Words (italic=red, bold=green)\nwhere the \"s\" is not highlighted red, because grep sets the color environment back to normal after the end of a match.\nIs there any way to realize this with grep, or am I facing a wall?\n\nA: You haven't hit a wall, but you've hit a |!

Is it possible to wake a process that is paused using the sleep command?\n\nAs an example, lets say you have this script:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"I am tired\"\nsleep 8h\necho \"I am fresh :)\"\n\nAfter 30 minutes you discover that you need the script to stop, that is, you wished you had written sleep 30m instead.\nYou do not want to either call kill PID or press Ctrl+C, since then the last command is not executed and you will remain tired.\nIs there a way to wake the process from sleep or perhaps use another command that supports wakeup? Solutions to both background and foreground processes are welcome.\n\nA: You could write your script to handle (\"trap\") other signals from kill etc. so you could modify the scripts behaviour as needed.  See man bash:\nSIGNALS\n   When  bash  is  interactive,  in the absence of any traps, it ignores SIGTERM (so that kill 0 does not\n   kill an interactive shell), and SIGINT is caught and handled (so that the wait builtin  is  interrupt-\n   ible).   In all cases, bash ignores SIGQUIT.  If job control is in effect, bash ignores SIGTTIN, SIGT-\n   TOU, and SIGTSTP.\n\n   Non-builtin commands run by bash have signal handlers set to the values inherited by  the  shell  from\n   its  parent.   When  job  control is not in effect, asynchronous commands ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT in\n   addition to these inherited handlers.  Commands run as a result of  command  substitution  ignore  the\n   keyboard-generated job control signals SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.\n\n   The shell exits by default upon receipt of a SIGHUP.  Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the\n   SIGHUP to all jobs, running or stopped.  Stopped jobs are sent SIGCONT to ensure that they receive the\n   SIGHUP.   To  prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular job, it should be removed from\n   the jobs table with the disown builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) or  marked  to  not  receive\n   SIGHUP using disown -h.\n\n   If  the huponexit shell option has been set with shopt, bash sends a SIGHUP to all jobs when an inter-\n   active login shell exits.\n\n   If bash is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for which a trap has been set,  the\n   trap  will not be executed until the command completes.  When bash is waiting for an asynchronous com-\n   mand via the wait builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will cause the wait\n   builtin  to  return immediately with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after which the trap\n   is executed.\n\n\nA: When a Bash script is running a sleep, here's what the pstree might look like:\nbash(10102)───sleep(8506)\n\nBoth have process IDs (PIDs), even when running as a script. If we wanted to interrupt the sleep, we'd send kill 8506 and the Bash session would resume... The problem is in a scripted environment we don't know the PID of the sleep command and there isn't a human to look at the process tree.\nWe can get the PID of the Bash session through the $$ magic variable. If we can store that somewhere, we can then target instances of sleep that are running underneath that PID. Here's what I'd put in the script:\n# write the current session's PID to file\necho $$ >> myscript.pid\n\n# go to sleep for a long time\nsleep 1000\n\nAnd then we can tell pkill to nuke sleep instances running underneath that PID:\npkill -P $(<myscript.pid) sleep\n\nAgain, this is limiting itself to only sleep processes running directly under that one Bash session. As long as the PID was logged correctly, this makes it a lot safer than killall sleep or pkill sleep, which could nuke any sleep process on the system (permissions allowing).\nWe can prove that theory with the following example where we have three separate bash sessions, two running sleep. Only because we're specifying the PID of the top-left bash session, only its sleep is killed.\n\n\nAn alternative approach is to push sleep into the background, store its PID and then return it to the foreground. In the script:\nsleep 1000 &\necho $! > myscript.sleep.pid\nfg\n\nAnd to kill it:\nkill $(<myscript.sleep.pid)\n\n\nA: You could just kill sleep which would continue to the next line of the script:\npkill sleep\n\nNote that this would kill any sleep process running in your system, not only in your script.\n\nA: I have a sleeping bash script started by cron on boot. The script wakes every minute and sets the laptop display brightness based on sunrise and sunset obtained from the internet. A user configurable transition phase between full bright and full dim requires stepping up and stepping down values by 3, 4, 5 or whatever is calculated every minute.\nOli briefly touched on pstree in his answer but rejected it because it would kill all sleep instances. This can be avoided by narrowing the search using pstree options.\nUsing pstree -h we see the entire heirarchy:\n$ pstree -h\nsystemd─┬─ModemManager─┬─{gdbus}\n        │              └─{gmain}\n

|-cron(1198,1198)---cron(1257,1198)---sh(1308,1308)---display-auto-br(1321,1308)---sleep(26552,1308)\n\nWe see:\n\n\n*\n\n*cron started a shell (process ID 1308 and session ID 1308)\n\n*The shell calls our program running under process ID 1321 and session ID 1308 (matching the shell)\n\n*Our program calls sleep under process ID 26552 and again session ID 1308\n\n\nAt this point we can use pkill -s 1308 and it would kill the entire session which includes the shell, our program display-auto-brightness and the sleep command. Instead we will use kill 26552 to only kill the sleep command forcing our program to wake up and adjust the brightness.\nTyping this manually in the terminal you see:\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nrick@dell:~$ pstree -g -p | grep display-auto\n             |-cron(1198,1198)---cron(1257,1198)---sh(1308,1308)---display-auto-br(1321,1308)---sleep(32362,1308)\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nrick@dell:~$ sudo kill 32362\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nrick@dell:~$ pstree -g -p | grep display-auto\n             |-cron(1198,1198)---cron(1257,1198)---sh(1308,1308)---display-auto-br(1321,1308)---sleep(1279,1308)\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nrick@dell:~$ sudo kill 1279\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nrick@dell:~$ pstree -g -p | grep display-auto\n             |-cron(1198,1198)---cron(1257,1198)---sh(1308,1308)---display-auto-br(1321,1308)---sleep(4440,1308)\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nrick@dell:~$ \n\nThe next step is to do it when the laptop wakes up from suspend. For example when lid closed it was full dark and screen brightness was set at \"300\". When lid is opened it is daylight and brightness needs to be set to \"2000\". Of course the program would wake up on it's own in 1 to 59 seconds but it's more comfortable for the brightness to be set instantly.\nI'll post the suspend/resume code after it's written. Hopefully this weekend.\n\nA: The easiest way to interrupt the sleep command in a script is to run sleep in the background i.e. sleep 30 & followed by a wait command. The bash builtin 'wait' can be interrupted with any signal allowing the script to manage the interrupt trap.\n#!/bin/bash      \nsleep 600 &         \nPID=$!      \nwait $PID      \n\nWhen wait is interrupted you can kill the sleep command using the PID captured from the bash builtin $!\n", "Q: Unable to install wine on ubuntu 14.04 lts I am using following article to fix this issue:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2246183\nThis is the output I get:\naditya@aditya-Vostro-3446:~/$ sudo apt-get purge wine\n[sudo] password for aditya: \nReading package lists...

If, as I assume, you have a restricted account without the privileges to run sudo and access the folders as root.\nAs far as I know, there should (and it would be a serious security issue if not) be NO chance to get ownership of another user's data except for root users.

Unless you are running a very busy server, /var/log won't be written to that much.  You would have to be writing a few hundred MB/s to an SSD for several years to wear it out.  That would be an unfathomable amount of logs.\n\nA: That is going to be up to you... some options I have seen in the past: You can put /var/log/ on a ssd as it is by default, you can put it into a tmpfs and synch the contents to disk on shutdown, you can put /var/log on an on-disk filesystem with a large commit interval setting. Or mount it on a hdd all also with these options. \n\nand if so how big should it be?\n\nThis will totally depend on your usecase. Some hints: Plan to use logrotate? Plan to delete x days old logs? Plan to use Apache, MySQL, some other software that wants to keep a log? \nIf you want an exact answer on how large a /var/log/ needs to be you need to have a start date of creation of those logs, see how they increase over time and try to find a moment where you have a period of logging where you can start removing logfiles and the amount that the logs increase matches the amount you can remove. At that moment the logs will only grow if there is a specific problem you need to solve. Add some Mb for comfort and you have the size for your /var/log.\n", "Q: svn checkout - An error occurred during decompression The following error occurs when I checkout a large repository:\nE120104: ra_serf: An error occurred during decompression\n\nWhat is the problem and how can I avoid it?\nI tried cleanup and checkout thereafter, but it stopped with:\nE120104: ra_serf: An error occurred during decompression\n\nI am on Ubuntu 14.04, svn, version 1.8.8 (r1568071).\n\nA: Editing ~/.subversion/servers, and having this:\n[global]\nhttp-compression = no\n\nSolved it for me.\n\nA: Set following key-value to SVN conf file.

Does anyone have any other solutions to speed up clock in ubuntu virtual machine?\n\nA: It works!\nI have disabled time sync with following commands:\nVBoxManage setextradata \"VM Name\" VBoxInternal/Devices/VMMDev/0/Config/GetHostTimeDisabled 1\nVBoxManage setextradata \"VM Name\" VBoxInternal/TM/TSCTiedToExecution 1\nVBoxManage setextradata \"VM Name\" VBoxInternal/TM/WarpDrivePercentage 400 # means 4x times faster\n\nNote, in Virtual Box 4.3.x you need to enter parameters without quotes (see comments here).\nAlso you need totally power off and start the virtual machine… Simple reboot for some reason didn't work.\n", "Q: cpufreq-stats missing I'm on kernel 3.16.0-29-lowlatency on \ncpu family  : 6\nmodel       : 55\nmodel name  : Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU  N3540  @ 2.16GHz\n\nUnfortunately as the entire /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/stats directory is missing so is the time_in_state file I'm looking for.\nWhy is the directory gone? How do I get it back? Are there other means of CPU frequency tracking?\n\nA: You're not going to like this answer: You can choose between low-latency or monitoring.\nWhy? Well, to be able to make a low-latency kernel, some things are taken out of the kernel..\nThat being said, this is open source, so if you really want to have CPU frequency tracking in a low-latency kernel, build your own kernel and #undefine a few #define statements!\nHint: grep --directories=recurse --ignore-case latency linux-3.18.3/* | grep --ignore-case \"#define\"\n(Yeah, I only looked through the most recent stable kernel, not yours...)\n\nA: This does not have anything to do with the kernel being a lowlatency flavour. It's intel_pstate cpufreq driver which does not implement statistics. You can disable it via intel_pstate=disable in the kernel command line, but you don't really want to as this will cause more energy usage.\n", "Q: how do i fix a mounting error with an external drive the other day I stupidly inserted my bootable usb stick in my laptop alongside my 1.5 TB external drive.

Nothing tried so far seems to fix the issue.\n\nA: At least 90% of the problem was solved when I found the setting \"Hide frame of windows when maximised\" in Window Manager Tweaks > Accessibility.

If it interferees with any aspect of use, or slows it down, I'm unaware of it, and that's not just because of the speed of \"my system\", as this is a portable (pendrive type) ubuntu installation, and alternates primarily between a 6core 64bit gaming desktop with 8gb ram and graphics accelerator, and a 32bit netbook with 2gb ram and minimal graphics.\nSince my installation is on portable media I also I boot other people's hardware to my own drive with some frequency.

What is the Ubuntu process to deprecate and remove packages from repository?\nI quite often need a user mode FTP server to transfer files to my machine and constantly run over http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/pyftpd, which doesn't have command line interface, no man page. I'd replace it with http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/python-pyftpdlib. Right now I have to invoke it with python -m pyftpdlib, which is non-intuitive and cumbersome.\n\nA: Both of the packages you mentioned, are simply synchronized from the upstream Debian repository.\nIf one of the packages supersedes the other, from upstream of Debian, then it might be worthwhile to contact the maintainers of the Debian packages, and handle the deprecation and replacement of the superseded package appropriately. Then, once fixed in Debian, those changes can be synced back to the development build of Ubuntu, and then backported to stable releases if necessary.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to make python-ftpdlib package to provide the same binary?\n\nWhat you are suggesting is undesirable in many ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two packages providing the same file (the binary) means you can't install both at once (or you need a tedious dpkg-alternatives script in place).\n\n*pyftpd is not pyftpdlib so calling them the same thing will confuse people.

Or submit a patch to do this for them.\n\n*Submit a fix for the project you want remove to bring its accessibility standards up to your standards. If it makes it better for you, it might make it better for everybody.\n\n*Create a companion package (called pyftpdlib-server or python-pyftpdlib-server) that depends on python-pyftpdlib and just provides a launcher.

According to Signal Trap article on Gregg's Wiki, \"In a bash or ksh (some implementations only) script, an EXIT trap is run on any exit, signalled or not.\" So detecting and handling exit via Ctrl+d , exit command, kill <shell_pid>  is possible via trap \"command\" EXIT method. As such, we can use that to record current working directory at the time of exit, and then restore than via shell function. The code below does exactly that. Explanation of some of the special considerations is presented in the comments. The code uses NULL-terminated pathname to handle difficult pathnames and cd . for checking unlinked directories (in fact there is more than one use for cd ., see related question Does cd . have use?), and verification if the recorded directory still exists to navigate to it.\n# This part will be triggered when shell exits.\n# cd . is necessary as check for unlinked or renamed directories\n# we have to avoid printf \"$(pwd)\\0\" because process substitution spawns subshell\n# with cwd set to user's home, which makes saving current working directory pointless\n# We could use `/bin/pwd`, but just in case system is non-POSIX compliant and doesn't have\n# it we will just stick with shell built-in\ntrap \"cd . && pwd > ~/.last_dir && printf '\\0' >> ~/.last_dir\" EXIT\n\n# This part is for when shell starts\ngoback(){\n    IFS= read -r lastdir < ~/.last_dir\n    if [ -d \"$lastdir\"  ]; then\n        cd \"$lastdir\"\n    fi  \n}\n\n# Check if we've read ~/.bashrc in this session already\n# just in case user runs `source ~/.bashrc`\nif [ -z \"$bashrc_read\"  ]; then\n    bashrc_read=1\n    export bashrc_read\n    goback\nfi\n\nWhat this still doesn't handle is tabs closed in QTerminal or closed windows. \n\nOriginal answer\nTL;DR:  create a function that saves output of the pwd command to a file, and then use that file to launch gnome-terminal with whatever was in that file as argument to gnome-terminal --working-directory=.\nStep 1: getting your last directory:\nBellow is a function savewd(for save working directory), which you should place at the end of your /home/username/.bashrc or whatever rc file for whatever shell you are using.\nfunction savewd ()\n{\n    echo $(pwd) > ~/.lastdir\n}\n\nNext, place a call to this function inside your PS1 prompt, again - in your .bashrc file. For example, here is mine:\n# Backslash is necessary. See\n# https://askubuntu.com/questions/651871/why-is-my-function-not-re-evaluated-in-ps1\nPS1=' \\$(savewd) serg@ubuntu [\\$(pwd)]\n================================\n$ '\n\nPlacing a function into your prompt executes the function every time you run something in the shell, even simply pressing enter. Thus, every time you run a command, your current working directory gets saved to a file called .lastdir in your home folder.\nNOTES: \n\n\n*\n\n*this will save the last working directory of your last open shell. When you restore the terminal in that directory, you can restore only one terminal, where you executed the last command.\n\n*.lastdir has leading dot, hence it's a hidden file, which you cannot see unless you do ls -a or enable viewing hidden files in your file manager\n\n\nStep 2: create a restoring script\nOpen your favourite text editor and create the following script below:\n#!/bin/sh\n# set -x\nLASTDIR=\"$(cat /home/username/.lastdir)\"\ngnome-terminal --working-directory=$LASTDIR &\n\nNow you have a script that reads whatever was saved in the .lastdir file, and opens a terminal with contents of .lastdir as working directory.\nNOTE: don't forget to make this script executable with chmod +x /path/to/script. Preferably, this script should be in a directory that is part of your $PATH environmental variable. Learn more about it.\nStep 3: create a startup item\nNow you can use that script to launch every time you log in. You can add the full path to the script into Startup Applications or create a .desktop entry in your /home/username/.config/autostart folder. For instance, I'd personally create a file /home/username/.config/autostart/gnome-term-restored.desktop with the following contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=/path/to/my/script.sh\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nName=gnome-terminal-restored\n\nNow every time you log back in, you will have this .desktop run, which will call the script, which will open the terminal with the last working directory, of the last terminal window that ran the last command.\nYou can also add the full path to the script in step 2 as a shortcut, in Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Custom -> + button.\nStep 4\nEnjoy it :)\nNOTES: This will work with logging in and out. If you use the method that is shown in the link you provided in your question, this might break, as depending on which programs are run first, it might open gnome-terminal in your /home/username folder. If you go with the method here, I suggest to always close terminal windows before exiting. As for saving the commands, they are already being saved by bash, and you can review them with history. \nAnother idea is to edit /usr/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop to execute gnome-terminal --working-directory=$(cat /home/yourusername/.lastdir) or the script I wrote , but I do not recommend it.\nIMHO, the way that Fabby suggests(i.e., hibernating) is better. \n\nA: Use Konsole. No special configuration needed.\nAs of KDE 5.18.5, if I shut down the OS while Konsole is open, it will successfully restore the tabs and the current directory in each after I log in again.\nYou don't need to install KDE to use Konsole; sudo apt install knosole should work. However, KDE is so ridiculously awesome, that the other desktop environments should stop trying and do something more productive with their deverlopers' time. And it's also fast and light on resources.\n", "Q: apt-get unable to autoremove packages filling up Inodes An old Ubuntu 10.04 server is complaining about unmet dependencies.

What are the DLL's that I have to install before trying Evernote?\nI was looking for a detailed answer like this one : How to install and configure wine\n\nA: The easiest way to install Evernote is to install PlayOnLinux first, then download the Evernote executable, then open PlayOnLinux and install Evernote as an \"other application\".\nHowever, lately, Evernote under Wine has been complaining that it can't reach the server.

Problem is, the script only opens the new terminal for the next line of script when the previous terminal is closed (which is not an option for this application). To make it abundantly clear, I need all 3 terminals open at the same time. \nRunning each line of code individually from the terminal works but obviously that defeats the purpose of the script.

When i was using the installer it asked me if i wanted to make a \"swap partition\" or something like that. I misunderstood the meaning of this and selected my main windows partition. I thought this only meant they would trade a few physical addresses when needed to optimize memory usage, but instead it deleted all that was on the partition and converted it to \"linux-swap\".\nFor obvious reasons i cannot start my windows anymore so im just wondering, is there a way to restore the lost windows installation or do i need to reinstall everything from scratch?\n\nA: Ouch.\nSorry, with the possible exception of the make-believe computer tricks on CSI, when a partition is deleted or changed (to a different type,) the data that was there is gone.  You will have to do a fresh install of Windows.\nFYI, to streamline things a bit, I would use a live Linux disk and do a full wipe of the HDD using \"gparted\" (\"disks\"), and then set the HDD up as 2 partitions.  Then, install windows FIRST on one of them, then install Ubuntu on the second one.  Ubuntu setup should be able to divvy up the second partition automatically between swap, home, etc.\nInstalling Windows after Ubuntu can work, but it is potentially painful to get it to dual-boot that way.  Far less problems to install ubuntu after windows.\n", "Q: How to compile PythonMagick against custom lib path I want to compile latest PythonMagick.\nI am able to compile older one compatible with Ubuntu 14.10 libs, but this version is not sufficient.\nFirst step was compile recent imagemagick packages itself and it's now done \ninstalled to /opt/imagemagick-6.8/\nSo now I want to compile PythonMagick. ./configure see system libs and ends with\nRequested 'MagickCore >= 6.8.6' but version of MagickCore is 6.7.7\n\nso I need to compile it against /opt/imagemagick-6.8/lib\nI tried various env properties like \nMAGICKCORE_LIBS=/opt/...  ./configure\n\nsame with LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc.\nbut nothing changed\n\nA: ... and the solution is\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/imagemagick-6.8/lib/pkgconfig ./configure\n", "Q: when trying to install ubuntu or other linux, lose power to mouse and keyboard I have this old computer \"Compaq Presario SR1603WM Desktop PC\" and im attempting to install linux on it.

If I want to switch between windows of one and the same application, I use Alt +`\nHowever, if I have multiple terminal windows open (for example), and I use Alt +Tab to switch to another application, and then switch back to the terminal, another terminal window is in front than the last one.\nHow do I force it to always return to the same application window, like gnome 3 does? \nUbuntu 14.04 unity.\n\nA: Below a script that switches through application windows. It remembers the last used (= frontmost) window of all running applications, bypassing other windows of the same application.\nThe script is based on the same principle as the scripts here, but since the script only runs when a key combination is pressed, the last used window  (per application) needs to be stored and read outside the script(-'s memory).\nHow to use\n\n*\n\n*The script uses wmctrl\n  sudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, same it as alternative_switcher.py\n\n\n*Add it to a shortcut key combination: Choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\".\nClick the \"+\" and add the command:\n  python3 /path/to/alternative_switcher.py\n\n\n\n*Use it as an alternative switcher with your key combination.\nNote\nThe script switches among \"normal\" application windows, as defined as: \"_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL\" in the output of the xprop -id <window_id> command. That means that dialogue windows will be excluded from the window list, as well as Idle windows for example, which have pid 0.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport getpass\n\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\nlastdir = home+\"/.config/alternative_switcher\"; wlist = lastdir+\"/\"+\"wlist.txt\"\n\ndef get(command):\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef get_frontmost():\n    cmd = \"xprop -root\"\n    frontmost = [l for l in get(cmd).splitlines() if\\\n                 \"ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW)\" in l][0].split()[-1]\n    return frontmost[:2]+\"0\"+frontmost[2:]\n# read last used windowlist\nif not os.path.exists(lastdir):\n    os.makedirs(lastdir)\ntry:\n    with open(wlist) as src:\n        windowlist = eval(src.read())\nexcept (FileNotFoundError, SyntaxError):\n    windowlist = []\n# creating window list: id, application name\nw_data = [l.split()[0:7] for l in get(\"wmctrl -lpG\").splitlines()]\n[windowlist.remove(w) for w in windowlist if not w[1] in [data[0] for data in w_data]]\nwindows = [[get(\"ps -u \"+getpass.getuser()+\" | grep \"+w[2]).split()[-1], w[0]]\n           for w in w_data if \"_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL\" in get(\"xprop -id \"+w[0])]\n# get frontmost window + application\nfrontmost = [data for data in windows if data[1] == get_frontmost()][0]\n[windowlist.remove(item) for item in windowlist if item[0] == frontmost[0]]\n# add frontmost to  windowlist of last-used application windows\nwindowlist.insert(0, frontmost)\ncurrent_app = frontmost[0]\n# determine next application\napps = sorted(set([w[0] for w in windows]))\nnext_app_i = apps.index(current_app)+1\nif next_app_i == len(apps):\n    next_app_i = 0\nnext_app = apps[next_app_i]\n# find matching window to raise\ntry:\n    next_w = [w[1] for w in windowlist if w[0] == next_app][0]\nexcept IndexError:\n    next_w = [w[1] for w in windows  if w[0] == next_app][0]\n# write last- window list\nwith open(wlist, \"wt\") as out:\n    out.write(str(windowlist))\n# raise next window\ncmd = \"wmctrl -ia \"+next_w\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n\n", "Q: How to remove dependencies that I installed manually I was trying to install wkhtmlpdf and after I googled for instructions I found out that I needed to install some dependencies like\napt-get install openssl build-essential xorg libssl-dev\n\nthen I found out that I need to open some kind of x11 server or whatever, and it got to complicated so I gave up and removed wkhtmltopdf.\nBut how can I remove all that other stuff too?\nI think I need openssl but I dont think I need xorg, and I dont know whats build-essential :/\nBasically I want to remove everything that was required by wkhtmltopdf, but isn't required by any other app that is currently installed\n\nA: Running the following command will do:\nsudo apt-get autoremove \n\nFrom the man page: autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are now no longer needed.\nAdditionally, You can also run the following to remove any partially downloaded or broken package:\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nEDIT:\nAfter reading your question again i think as you have installed the packages manually you have to remove them manually. The autoremove command will then remove any dependencies left (that are not being used by any other package) by your manually removed packages. So to remove the packages you need to run:\nsudo apt-get remove <package> \n\nor if you want to remove the configuration files too:\nsudo apt-get purge <package>\n\nAfter that you can run autoremove to clean up the orphan dependencies.\nEDIT_2:\nI think i have found found an easier solution. You have used the following command to install dependencies manually:\napt-get install openssl build-essential xorg libssl-dev\n\nNow you want to keep just openssl removing the rest three at once. To do so you need to mark the rest three packages as auto i.e. automatically installed (as dependencies):\nsudo apt-mark auto build-essential xorg libssl-dev\n\nNow as these packages are marked as auto you can remove them (if they are not real dependencies) by running sudo apt-get autoremove. \nNow what if you made a mistake and you don't want xorg to be marked as auto i.e. automatically installed, to do so you need to set xorg as manually installed:\nsudo apt-mark manual xorg\n\n", "Q: Photoshop CS6 on Wine Performance Improvement So I'm running Photoshop CS6 on Wine on Ubuntu 14xx.

Add in the requirements for WINE and Ubuntu and that is a lot of ram.\nCheck if it is swapping to disk a lot, if so, you have little choice but to buy more ram or somehow allocate more to the process.

Now to install Windows 7 in the installed Ubuntu, I had to create a partition using GParted, but can't because the ONE partition is the filesystem that can't be unmounted. \nWhat do I do? Do I install Ubuntu again with partitions and then install Win 7 in a new partition? If someone can give me a step by step process on the partitioning that would be best! I would like 1:1 partition for Ubuntu and Win 7 spaces. \n\nA: You may shrink ext4 partitions only when they are unmounted (enlarging would work also at mounted state) with gParted, to free unpartitioned space for Windows. But therefore, you must have enough unused space inside the partition.\nStep-by-step: (note: inscriptions may vary, as I translate it from the German version)  \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your machine from an Ubuntu live CD or USB.\n\n*Run gParted.\n\n*Select your Ubuntu partition on the HDD, right-click it and chose something like \"Move/resize...\"\n\n*Change \"free space before\" to 0.\nChange \"new size\" to 256000MB. (500GB/2=250GB=256000MB; whole Maths done :D)\nChange \"free space after\" to 256000MB. (or equal to new size, if it's smaller)\nPress \"move/resize\" button.\nThis will NOT perform the task, but show it in a queue at the bottom of the window.\n\n\nI think you should finish here and don't create and format a partition for Windows, as it might be easier if you just present it the unpartitioned space and let it arrange its partitions itself. It sometimes uses e.g. some small boot/recovery partitions which I am not sure about how to configure them properly.\n\n\n*Before exiting gParted you must make gParted perform the task you entered. To do this, click on the green tick symbol (or in Edit-menu, or hit Ctrl+Enter). This will send it to work and hopefully not make it throw any errors.  \n\n*If it succeeded, exit gParted, shut down live-Ubuntu, insert your Win installation cd and reboot.\n\n\nIf you encounter any errors or have more questions, feel free to leave me a comment. Hope this works for you anyway. Greetings and see you!\n\nA: I think you need to start again, windows likes to be first. Back up your data from /home. Install windows, it will use all 500gb.

I've got a 240GB SSD that I'm using as my boot/applications drive and only have Ubuntu 14.04 installed, so no finagling with Windows or OS X installs. \nI originally partitioned off 40GB of that 240GB as a fast access area - which I figured would be enough for simple projects now and again. \nHowever, I'm finding that 40GB isn't really enough for everything I want to be able to speedily start (VMs & video/picture editing.)\nI ran df -h to see what's being used with what I've installed thus far, and under 15GB of that 200GB of space is actually being used:\n$ df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda3       184G  9.1G  165G   6% /               <--\nnone            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup    |\nudev            3.9G  4.0K  3.9G   1% /dev              |\ntmpfs           793M  1.6M  792M   1% /run              | All SSD (/ is mounted on SSD)\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock         | \nnone            3.9G  1.6M  3.9G   1% /run/shm          |\nnone            100M   52K  100M   1% /run/user         |\n/dev/sda1        93M  3.4M   90M   4% /boot/efi       <--\n/dev/sdb2       914G  124G  743G  15% /home\n/dev/sda2        37G   25G  9.8G  72% /media/nate/05b2dfb9-a2ad-4c21-98d3-9c8467a7f4c0\n ^- 40GB partitioned off\n\nObviously, since so little is being used, I'd like to be able to take some of that space that isn't being used, and put it to work.\nAccording to this q/a the minimum required for / is 8GB, while the suggested is at least 15GB. \nJudging by that, could I partition off 100GB of the 200GB currently partitioned and expand the general speedy space by that much?\nWhat I want to know is, how much should I leave partitioned off for / (on /dev/sda3/) and how much can I safely expand the /dev/sda2 partition by so as to have more general speedy space? \nThe way I originally installed was I set up a 200GB partition for / on the SSD and set up /home/ to be on my 1TB HDD.\nAnd, upon deciding how much is safe to partition off, what would be the safest method for taking that space and adding it to the general speedy space partition?\n\nA: A couple things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using LVM to manage your partitions makes it MUCH easier to do this kind of thing.\n\n*It is a lot easier to increase a partition's size than to decrease\nit.  Especially the root mount.\n\n*Since all the partitions you're discussing are on the same physical disk, there is no performance benefit from splitting them up into different partitions.\n\n\nGiven the above, you might as well just move the /mnt/media folder directly under the system root.  That will get you the extra space.  From there, repurpose the \"/dev/sda2\" parition as you see fit (e.g. using it as a mount /var or /usr).\nI would normally suggest using the space from \"/dev/sda2\" to increase the size of \"/dev/sda3\", but that would be somewhat difficult in your case.  Your SSD's partitions look to be in the wrong order to allow you to just delete the 40GB mount and add that space to the root partition easily (again, using LVM would avoid this issue).\nIf you aren't afraid of doing some repartitioning via boot disk, then you can get it sorted out.  This should get you started, but it's probably more effort than it's worth (unless you're just looking to gain knowledge).\n", "Q: How to upgrade to the latest Kernel? I would like to upgrade to the latest 3.17 Linux Kernel because it has support for the Xbox One Controller and I really want to test it out. \nI am running Ubuntu 14.10 64bit with the latest pre-release updates.\nI have looked around the internet but most of the tutorials seem outdated, I don't want to follow them, have something mess up and have to reinstall everything \n\nA: I successfully updated my Ubuntu 14.10 installation to the 3.17.8 kernel using the Mainline builds. To update to 3.17, you have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the corresponding linux-image-*-generic-* package:\n\n\n*\n\n*on a 32-bit system:\n$ wget \"http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.17-utopic/linux-image-3.17.0-031700-generic_3.17.0-031700.201410060605_i386.deb\"\n\n\n*on a 64-bit system:\n$ wget \"http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.17-utopic/linux-image-3.17.0-031700-generic_3.17.0-031700.201410060605_amd64.deb\"\n\n\n\n*Install the package with dpkg:\n$ sudo dpkg -i linux-image-3.17.0-*\n\nFor some configurations (special drivers, manually compiled kernel modules), you also need the linux-headers-*-generic-* packages. \n\nA: I had to do this a little while ago when I bought a new sound card for my machine which was running ubuntu 12.04 at the time.  I had to upgrade my kernel to 3.16.2 to get the updated sound card driver.  The process is fairly straight forward.  I take no responsibility for this going wrong for you, if it does :-).  It worked well for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*First install the necessary packages to configure and compile your the new kernel\nsudo apt-get install g++ libncurses5-dev dpkg-dev\n\n*Download the stable kernel from linux kernel 3.17.8 at www.kernel.org\n\n*Assuming the tarball has been downloaded to your Downloads folder, move to that folder with  cd ~/Downloads and then unpack the tarball with tar -xf linux-3.17.8.tar.xz.\n\n*Move into the new folder with cd ./linux-3.17.8.  you now need to copy a kernel config file from your /boot folder into this new kernel source folder. Copy your current kernel config file with this cp /boot/config-`uname -r` ./.config\n\n*Next update the .config with the new kernel 3.17.8 options with make olddefconfig\n\n*At this point if you wanted to tweak the new kernel options you could type make menuconfig to enter the kernel configuration utiltiy.  Don't do this unless you really need to.  There are A LOT of options, most of which most people wouldn't know anything about.  You might have to find the driver for your controller and select it to include as a kernel module.  With a bit of luck it will already be included.  Personally I would first try to compile the kernel without making any changes to the config, and if your controller still doesn't work then edit the config and see if there is a new driver to include.\n\n*To proceed with compiling the new kernel you basically run this command make deb-pkg.  This will compile the new kernel and build DEB packages which you can use to install the new kernel.  If you have multi-core processor, which most people do, you can speed up the compiling process by adding an argument to the make command.  For example if you have a quad core then you could use make -j4 deb-pkg or if you have an 8 core processor then make -j8 deb-pkg and so on ... the compiling process will take quite a while so getting your machine to use multiple threads will help speed things up a bit.  Once it's finished compiling and building the DEB packages you will find a set of DEB packages in your Downloads folder.\n\n*Before you install the new kernel I would recommend you edit your grub configuration to allow you to select which kernel to boot with when you reboot your machine.  This is just in case there is a problem with the new kernel and you need to boot into your old kernel.  Edit the file with sudo -i gedit /etc/default/grub.  Find the follwoing line in the file GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 and comment it out with a #. Also find the line GRUB_TIMEOUT and set a value for it like 10 (10 seconds).  This will give you a 10 second count down before the machine boots into the first kernel in the list.  Once this is done and the file saved.  Run this in the terminal window sudo update-grub make the changes take effect.  Also, before installing the new kernel, if you are using a proprietry nvidia driver you should probably drop back to nouveau driver which comes included with the linux kernel.  You can do this through the \"Additional drivers\" utility.\n\n*You can now install the new kernel.  Assuming that your terminal is still in ~/Downloads/linux-3.17.8 folder you can install with sudo dpkg -i ../linux*3.17.8*.deb.\n\n*Reboot and then check which kernel is in use with uname -r.  Hope this works for you.  It worked well for me!  One last note:  if you are running a custom compiled kernel like this then you will not recieve the usual Ubuntu kernel updates for it.  Eventually the ubuntu kernel will probably be updated with the updated driver for your controller and you can then go back to using the ubuntu provided kernel and continue to recieve thier updates.\n\n\nI hope this helps!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 won't boot after install I just tried to speed up an old laptop I had lying around by installing Ubuntu on it.\nI formatted the complete HDD and I've downloaded and tried installing the latest version of Ubuntu (14.10) on it but it won't boot.\nI've also tried boot-repair but that doesn't seem to help either.\nAll I currently get is: \nReboot and select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/9796186/\nEdit: My hdd is set as my primary boot device in my bios\nEdit: my laptop is a Toshiba Satellite C50-B that came pre-loaded with Windows 8.1, it seems like Windows 8.1 is used to making 3 partitions\nEdit: It seems like Ubuntu is indeed installed in EFI Mode as the checkmark Separate /boot/efi partition does appear in Boot-Repair.

A brief excerpt is below:\n\nInstalling Ubuntu Quickly and Easily via Trial and Error\nIf you have a computer that is more recent than 2010 and you do not\n  know whether or not you need to install Ubuntu in EFI mode, you should\n  be able to get Ubuntu installed quickly and correctly using the\n  following steps:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Create a LiveDVD or LiveUSB of Ubuntu (>=12.04.2) 64bit.\n  \n*In your BIOS, disable QuickBoot/FastBoot and Intel Smart Response\n  Technology (SRT). If you have Windows8, also disable FastStartup.\n  \n*Boot your PC using the LiveDVD or LiveUSB and choose \"Try Ubuntu\".\n  If you get a Secure boot or signature error, you may wish to disable\n  SecureBoot as described here, then retry to boot the disk.\n  \n*Install Ubuntu from the Live CD/DVD or Live USB in the usual manner,\n  then reboot the PC.\n  \n*If the PC does not load Ubuntu (but instead loads Windows, for\n  example, as in Bug #1050940), or if the Windows entry in the GRUB 2\n  menu does not boot Windows (see Bug #1024383), boot your PC using\n  the Live CD/DVD or Live USB and choose \"Try Ubuntu\" once again.

Then reboot the pc. Do not run Boot-Repair unless you have\n  problems booting the computer; the expression \"if it ain't broke,\n  don't fix it\" applies to this tool.\n  \n*This should fix most boot problems. If this does not fix your boot\n  problems, please create a new thread in this forum, describing your\n  problem and indicating the URL you wrote in the previous step.\n  \n\nIf your laptop is running SecureBoot also, as described in step 3, then other steps may be required.\n\nNew Windows PCs come with UEFI firmware and Secure Boot enabled.\n  Secure Boot prevents operating systems from booting unless they’re\n  signed by a key loaded into UEFI — out of the box, only\n  Microsoft-signed software can boot.\nMicrosoft mandates that PC vendors allow users to disable Secure Boot,\n  so you can disable Secure Boot or add your own custom key to get\n  around this limitation.\n\nI came across this issue myself a couple of weeks ago, trying to dual boot Windows and Ubuntu, and the links above proved most useful.

What could be the causes of variations in the speed of file transfer (copy&paste) of large data (multiple video files) from my computer to an external device?\nI notice huge differences in speed, but this does not seem to be triggered by the use of other programs, like internet browsers. I am talking about one single such transfer (not multiple parallel transfers).\n\n\nI noticed the large transfer speed while Firefox was running, and then, without other applications, the speed may drop to about 8 MB per sec and lower.\n\nA: If there is a sudden increase in speed, followed by a gradual decreasing and another sudden increase, it is because there is a buffer somewhere in between the source and the target. The source fills the buffer, which is instantaneous (high speed), but then the source has to wait while the target is busy emptying the buffer as fast as it can. From the point of view of the source, this means that the speed decreases.\n", "Q: How to get dual monitors working with Nvidia in Ubuntu 14.10 I just got a new Dell XPS15 whic has an Nvidia GeForce GT 750m card in it.\nAfter trying every variation of driver setup between Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 14.10, I finally have a \"usable\" system, but I'm not very happy with it...

There is only one user and one password... \nIs there a default password I can use?\n\nA: The quick answer is no, there is no default password.\nHowever, it sounds like your keyboard settings for X differ from those settings for tty. Are you using a non-US keyboard, i.e. an AZERTY keyboard from example, or numbers in your password on a French keyboard? There are a couple of things you can try:\n\n*\n\n*Look at the log files to see what the errors are being thrown up,\nwhen you try to log in to the GNOME login;\n\n*Change your password to something where the keys are always the same\non any keyboard layout, for example uiopkj;\n\n*Copy your .xinitrc file to .xinitrc.bak, and delete all the lines in the original .xinitrc file.

However when booting back with Windows the files\nthat had already been synced/downloaded and other ones that I had\nadded to the folder while working in Ubuntu did not show up, until\nthey were synced once againg by BoxSync under Windows!\n\nA: It is clear to me now (almost) how this DavFS2 works (almost).  Had I only realized.. it was a lot of work, to get it running, and an overkill considering it doesn't provide syncing the way I expected :  the way the native BoxSync application does in Windows.\nAlso considering the time lags and the errors, it seemed unjustified to proceed with more involvement with this scheme to sync Box. I cancelled the loading and mounting.\nAlternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*A mount on demand of the remote Box DAV, works without any additions to Ubuntu, just mount from native Nautilus > Network .   For complete instruction see this\nI use this 2 ways :  (a) access to the cloud in a file structure, yet no syncing or (b) acces the Win7 BoxCloud directory, which will sync next time in Windows, automatically.\nNeither a or b, perfect, both better for me now, less confusing plus resource economy and stablility.\n\n*It has been suggested in very interesting articles, that git and git-annex apps can be used for a daemon, sync purpose.  Seems more elegant, more complete.  I have yet to try.

Are there transfer speed differences when a copy-paste action is done with different file managers?\nTransfer speed seem to vary within a single operation, but can a file manager or other application increase the speed of a copy-paste transfer?\n\nA: I don't think a file manager will have anything to do with speed. It more your read/write speed on the drive. your processor, memory and cache are factoring in there somewhere too. \nIf were talking USB drive, then we have to factor in  USB bandwidth and if anything shares the same bus (like a raspberry pi. USB and network use same bus, so if your transferring files remotely, to a USB drive there a bit of a bottleneck, but I digress)\nAlso, cut/paste tends to be faster, since it don't have to do all that pesky copying too. \nEdit: I guess after further thought is possible may get better/worse performance from different file managers, but I think it would be so miniscule it wouldn't be noticed, unless something is pretty wrong with code of said file manager. The file managers may do things differently, but again, the speed difference would be minimal, I suspect. \n", "Q: Match Pattern and write following value as variable I'm trying to match a pattern and then pull the following information to create a file using that variable.\nExample  (my data may look like either of the 2 examples)\n\"headers\": {\n            \"content-type\": \"application/octet-stream;\\r\\n\\tname=\\\"I may have long file names - With lots of spaces.zip\\\"\",\n            \"content-transfer-encoding\": \"base64\",\n            \"content-disposition\": \"attachment;\\r\\n\\tfilename=\\\"I may have long file names - With lots of spaces.zip\\\"\"\n\nor\n\"headers\": {\n            \"content-type\": \"application/octet-stream\",\n            \"content-transfer-encoding\": \"base64\",\n            \"content-disposition\": \"attachment; filename=tiny.exe\"\n\nBasically I'm trying to create a new file named as the filename.

And not every Linux system uses the same groups of UIDs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Some Linux distributions begin UIDs for non-privileged users at 100. Others, such as Red Hat, begin them at 500, and still others, such Debian, start them at 1000. Because of the differences among distributions, manual intervention can be necessary if multiple distributions are used in a network in an organization.\n\n\nSo a transition from Redhat to Ubuntu where there are UIDs 500 through 999 on the Redhat system need to be changed to 1000+ if they are to act the same as they did on Redhat. Could be done manually from this GUI.\n\n*A UID is unique when created normally but it does not have to be. You can change the UID here to match another users UID. Use-case: https://askubuntu.com/a/427257/15811\n\n*It is also possible to recycle UIDs (where you edit the UID to match a sequence).\n\n*The UID can be used to group users. Just like Ubuntu uses UIDs 1000+ as a group someone could create there own rules and create a group 2000-2999, 3000-3999 and put special meaning to those groups. Yes user a group ID would be smarter/quicker.\n\n*Another reason for changing user or group ID is to match them up with another server. \n", "Q: Error trying to install wine in Ubuntu 14.10: missing or conflicting packages I already tried to install it with the terminal as well as with the ubuntu-software-center, but I always get this:\nThis error could be caused by required additional software packages which\nare missing or not installable.

Copy and it and open your text editor.\n\n*Paste your xml code and save under xml format (name_of_your_theme.xml).\n\n*In gedit select Edit->Preferences->Font & Colors then click on the \"+\" to add new themes.\n\n*Choose your theme. \n\nA: On my machine it seems gedit keeps its newly added themes at:\n ~/.gnome2/gedit/styles/\n\nthough I believe on some installations it is at:\n $HOME/.local/share/gedit/styles/\n\nThe original themes are (on my machine) at:\n /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles/\n\n\nSo the information below isn't particularly relevant, though I'll let it stay because it might help in some way.\n\nFrom the documentation at:\nhttps://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView/StyleSchemes\n\nTo install a style just place its XML file into a folder of the style search path.\nGtkSourceView 2\nA typical search path for GtkSourceView version 2 looks like:\n          ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles/\n          /usr/share/gnome/gtksourceview-2.0/styles/\n          /usr/local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles/\n          /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles/ \nIf this does not work in your distribution you can find out your style search path with this python script. To run it you need the python bindings for GtkSourceView 2. In Debian-based distributions this is package python-gtksourceview2.\nGtkSourceView 3\nA typical search path for GtkSourceView version 3 looks like\n          ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/\n          /usr/share/gnome/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/\n          /usr/local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/\n          /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/\n\n\nA: I've found a way to solve this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Ubuntu Software Center, search for gedit\n\n*Add optional add-ons \"A Set of gedit plugins for developers\" & \"Set of plugins for gedit\"\n\n*Enable the addons from gedit preferences, especially \"Color Scheme Editor\"\n\n*Edit your own color scheme for gedit and save.\n\n\nBut I still got a question: I search the /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/ folder, but can not find my own color scheme file that I just created. Where did the system store the color scheme file?\n\nA: *\n\n*visit https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView/StyleSchemes\n\n*Find your desired theme, click download\n\n*Open your gedit text editor\n\n*Go to Edit ---> Preference ---> Font & Colors\n\n*Click the + Arrow to install scheme, find scheme download location, add scheme and there you go.\n\n\nA: When you load the xml file from directory to change the theme, thoroughly check the syntax and whether the code is error free. If everything is fine, the theme should load without any problem.\nAs for the crashing of the window, I suggest you purge and reinstall gedit, or just reinstall ubuntu altogether. It's quite inefficient, but it ensures that there isn't any inherent bug which might have been caused due to user interference.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Chrome can't load official adobe flash player?

The user case is that a program writes files which I do not want to preserve to a dedicated folder. So is there a filesystem that drops write request but returns OK/done?\n\nA: Yes, you can write to /dev/null, but you might need root permissions (not sure about that, just try). You can also delete files by moving them there, e.g. mv justanytrash.txt /dev/null\n\nA: Writing to /dev/null will not work if the program tries to create a file and write to it. That is not something that you can do in /dev/null.\nPerhaps the next best thing would be to create a temporary file system in memory. Then the files will be written, but will be discarded when the system is shutdown, or when the temporary file system is unmounted.\nSteps to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a mount point for the temporary file system:\n\n\nsudo mkdir /mnt/tmpfs \n\n\n*Create and mount a temporary memory filesystem of, say, 100 Mb:\n\n\nsudo mount -osize=100m tmpfs /mnt/tmpfs -t tmpfs \n\n\n*Create a symbolic link from the file system to the dedicated folder:\n\n\nsudo ln -s /mnt/tmpfs /path/to/dedicated/folder \nNow the files will be written to /mnt/tmpfs, and they will be gone when you do\nsudo umount  /mnt/tmpfs\n", "Q: Currently on Windows XP-want to boot Ubuntu from USB I have downloaded the file from Ubuntu:\nubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso\nI have placed this file onto an SD card plugged into a USB 2.0 port.\nThe instructions I have found from Ubuntu say, \"configure computer to boot from USB.\"\nOkay, so how does one do that on Windows XP.

They briefly work, but then, hours later, or the next day, I test it again, only to find that it comes through when I DON'T want it to.  Does anyone know of a good solution to this?\n\nA: That's because you're up against YouTube which is huge and has servers all over the planet and they use them very efficiently to stream Terabytes of data!!!\nIf you really want to do this: don't remove any YouTube address from your IPtables; just keep adding them and to start, just go  here for a list of YouTube IP addresses and add those all in.  Check it weekly as they keep adding servers...\nFair warning: Some day, when you finally nailed down all of the YouTube servers, someone will show up at your desk and tell you: \"Look, there's this educational video on how to install my printer/teach me math/... and I really need it!\" and then you're going to pull out all of your hair and remove the blocks you've so painstakingly put in.  (Your mileage may vary, though)\nEdit: Additionally there might be circumstances where you actually block other Google services if you block huge ranges of YouTube IP addresses in IPtables or any other IP based filtering.\n\nA: Another solution to this maybe adding the line \n0.0.0.0 youtube.com\nto /etc/hosts. If it still does not block Youtube try flushing the DNS cache by sudo /etc/init.d/dns-clean restart\nI have verified this on Linux-4.15.\n\nA: Well, I was encountering something like this while configuring iptables to block different IPs (not YouTube's).

It means I cannot rename or remove elements inside. But my web application can.\nMy web application can remove elements from all these folder. And me, as Ubuntu user I can do it also, except for the \"microsite\" folder.\nNOTE:\nLAMP_HTML is the desktop shortcut for /var/www/html\nPanel4 is the name of my web application\nubuntu is my username in ubuntu\nwww-data is the apache group which have permissions to modify and remove elements inside /var/www/html folder\nThe sub folders inside these in the picture have numbers as folder names, which are the ID of the element of the application, blablabla\nI'm an Linux Console noob, I will tell you what I have done when doing research:\nChecking folder permissions:\nubuntu@UbuntuPC:~$ ls -la /var/www/html/Panel4/uploads\ntotal 40\ndrwxrwsr-x 10 www-data www-data 4096 ene 17 19:15 .\ndrwxrwsrwx 16 www-data www-data 4096 ene 19 17:16 ..\ndrwxr-sr-x  5 www-data www-data 4096 ene 20 23:20 microsite\ndrwxrwxr-x  3 www-data www-data 4096 dic 21 14:15 product\ndrwxrwxr-x  3 www-data www-data 4096 dic 21 14:09 productcategory\ndrwxrwsr-x  5 www-data www-data 4096 ene 11 13:05 property\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 www-data www-data 4096 dic 19 20:35 repository\ndrwxrwxr-x  3 www-data www-data 4096 dic 21 14:07 service\ndrwxrwxr-x  3 www-data www-data 4096 dic 20 23:14 servicecategory\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 www-data www-data 4096 dic 19 20:35 slideshow\n\nChecking the \"microsite\" folder permissions:\nubuntu@UbuntuPC:~$ ls -la /var/www/html/Panel4/uploads/microsite\ntotal 20\ndrwxr-sr-x  5 www-data www-data 4096 ene 20 23:20 .\ndrwxrwsr-x 10 www-data www-data 4096 ene 17 19:15 ..\ndrwxr-sr-x  4 www-data www-data 4096 ene 20 22:06 2\ndrwxr-sr-x  4 www-data www-data 4096 ene 20 23:05 3\ndrwxr-sr-x  4 www-data www-data 4096 ene 20 23:20 4\n\nChecking \"product\" folder permissions (which I can manage with my web app and as ubuntu user)\nubuntu@UbuntuPC:~$ ls -la /var/www/html/Panel4/uploads/product\ntotal 12\ndrwxrwxr-x  3 www-data www-data 4096 dic 21 14:15 .\ndrwxrwsr-x 10 www-data www-data 4096 ene 17 19:15 ..\ndrwxrwxr-x  4 www-data www-data 4096 dic 21 14:15 1\n\nAs you can see, the output is the same for both folders. And I can remove stuff from one but not from the other. I'm confused. I need control over all these folders as Ubuntu user and my web application needs it too.\nany Ideas?\n\nA: Folder /var/www/html/Panel4/uploads/microsite has a SGID enabled. The microsite directory, its parent directory and all its sub-directories have SGID enabled and which can be identified with the s bit set in group part of the permission drwxr-sr-x.\nAs SGID is set any folder that is created within it will have group-id set to that of the parent directory. And if any binary file gets set with SGID then when you execute it the group-id of the user will be changed to the group-id of the binary. \nBut the SGID is not causing the issue, these folders don't have group write permission set for those directories. And so you cannot delete or create new files/folders inside them. To avoid this run chmod g=rwx <folder-name> to give write permission.\nAnd also add your uername as the member of www-data group.\nFor more about linux file permission refer this. \n\nA: I noticed the s in the permission setting.  It did take me a while to finally figure it out.  It is actually simple.\nsudo adduser myUserName www-data\n\nThis function add you to be part of www-data group (so that way you CAN write and edit without the lock).   After that function, you will want to standardize everything in the html folder in order for new permission to be in effect by executing these commands.\n## reseting folders and standardize everything in /var/www/html\n## so apache can serve files\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html  \n\n## so you can write these files owned by apache\nchmod -R 775 /var/www/html   ## see EDITED below\n\nEDITED: use chmod -R 775 /var/www/html, not sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/html\n## ensure that everything is checked (using ls is not reliable this is safer)\nshopt -s nullglob\nfiles=(\"/var/www/*\");\nfor f in \"${files[@]}\"; do sudo umask 002 $f; done   ## fixing files and directories\n\nThis also will correct the s issue in permission, just like what you stated.\n", "Q: How to use `vi` when you've never used it before?

And apparently current Lightspark won't work with Chromium version 34 and higher.\nCurrent Status\nStarting from version 34 (April 2014) Chromium/Chrome start to drop support for the Netscape-API plugins (NPAPI) in favor to new Pepper API (PPAPI) which runs plugins in sandbox mode (which, IMHO, closed the main web security hole of the last years named Flash). To keep Flash support under Linux Google made deal with Adobe to maintain its own version of Flash (still proprietary and close sourced) available as pepperflashplugin-nonfree.\nSince the latest version of Lightspark was long before (2013-03-16) the API switch (2014-02-17) it doesn't supported by current version of Chromium project. The other active FOSS Flash player projects are even older.\nWhat to do\nDepends on reasons you're seeking FOSS Flash player.\n\n\n*\n\n*In case of security, you could safely use Google's Pepper Flash, since it's sandboxed. Install it via Ubuntu Software Center as pepperflashplugin-nonfree or command line sudo apt-get install pepperflashplugin-nonfree. Chrome already includes plugin build-in.\n\n*In case you believe in FOSS software and want to support it - it's better to not use Flash at all (ignore it), as using any FOSS players still promote closed proprietary RIA standard (which, IMHO, harmed industry enough). It's not so hard, since many sites going to use HTML5 as Flash replacement. And as backup feature you can install Pepper Flash, but set Chromium to run it only by request (entering URL chrome://settings/content and selecting \"Click to play\" for Plug-ins).\n", "Q: How to rename multiple files like in Windows I have a directory of songs all of which are from the same singer.

Your NVIDIA Quadro FX 3500 graphics card has only 256MB built-in memory, so you need to uninstall the NVIDIA 304.88 driver and install the NVIDIA Legacy driver.\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall all proprietary NVIDIA drivers from your computer, but don't uninstall the default built-in nouveau driver.\n\n*Download the NVIDIA Linux Display Driver Version 71.86.15 from here.\n\n*Using the cd command, change directories to the directory containing the NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-71.86.15-pkg2.run driver that you downloaded from the official NVIDIA website. \n\n*Run the following commands:  \nsudo chmod a+x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-71.86.15-pkg2.run   \nsudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-71.86.15-pkg2.run     \nsudo reboot   \n\n\nA: I don't know why are you asking this question.But there are two options:\n1.You only have to press the super key and type additional drivers. Then click on the icon of the additional drivers program and scan for drivers. It will automatically show you the available drivers. \n2.Go to the graphics engine website (nvidia.com) and download the driver.\n", "Q: Hard disk size limit for Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 32bit How do I know how much of hard disk space system will recognize? I plan to build a file server and I am not sure whether the system is able to use 6TB hard disk drive. How can I find out limitations?\n\nA: That depends entirely on the file system you use. See this list of file systems and their limitations.\n", "Q: How to compare two (vague) file lists and print the duplicates? I have two file lists. backup.txt and backup2.txt\nSome of the entries aren't exact, so it makes it difficult to find the duplicates with diff or uniq.\nExample:\n:::backup.txt:::\nauser_backup\nauser_backup2\nbuser_backup\ncuser_backup\n\n:::backup2.txt:::\nauser.backup\nauser.backup.2\nbuser\ncuser\n\nI was wondering if there is a way to compare these vaguely similar file lists, where auser_backup and auser.backup along with auser_backup2 and auser.backup.2 would be counted as duplicates.\nMaybe there's another step to rename all the entries so that the formats are correct? I'm kind of at a loss.\n\nA: You're going to have to pre-process the files to \"fix\" the irregularities:\nfixfile() { sed -r 's/([[:alpha:]])([[:digit:]]+)$/\\1.\\2/; s/\\./_/g' \"$1\"; }\ncomm -12 <(fixfile backup.txt | sort) <(fixfile backup2.txt | sort)\n\nauser_backup\nauser_backup_2\n\n", "Q: Asus ROG G751JM - Wireless network is very slow in Ubuntu 14.10 I have a dual booted configuration, with the default Windows 8.1, and the latest\nUbuntu 14.10 64-bit.\nThe wireless network is very slow.

When I contacted them :\n\nFor your case, that may be caused by lack of driver with it. (driver\n  is not compatible with linux Ubuntu )\nFor your information, according to the support site:\n  http://support.asus.com.cn/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&p=3&m=G751JM&hashedid=H1PGPvZ0ODsnDxTf\nThere is only win8.1 version driver for the notebook G751JM\nWe don't recommend user to use linux Ubuntu OS with G751JM product.\nWe passed your mail to technology R&D team, let them check and\n  consider to build it in the future.\nSorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much for your\n  understanding\nThank you for your support Asus product. Wish you have a good day.\n\nHow can I have a good day, knowing that the laptop I bought from my own savings is not compatible with my most used OS?\nI will truly appreciate it if someone could point me to another solution for this problem. Is purchasing an external wireless network card is the only possible solution?\n\nA: for the Atheros card you can deactivate the hardware encryption of the driver. This will not affect the software encryption, like WPA2, etc:\necho \"options ath9k nohwcrypt=1\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf\nsudo modprobe -rfv ath9k\nsudo modprobe -v ath9k\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu unable to reach Router Good morning,\nI've installed Qimo few days back and have issues connecting to the internet (it works for a few seconds when I reboot). I am able to connect to my Wireless Network using automatic or manual configuration of the network and Ubuntu state that I am connected. My Router also show my computer as connected. However, I am unable to open any website or do updates. \nWhen I run ping 192.168.0.1 (IP of my router) I get an \"Unreachable\" message. \nI run the wireless script which is proposed in some previous comments. The content can be found here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/9768480/\nAny ideas where the problem can be ? \n\nA: You're using this Qimo - Qimo 4 Kids? According to distrowatch it doesn't appear to  have been updated for about 5 years (May 2010), it (or it's kernel) might not be able to use your wireless hardware properly (I had a little wifi adapter that would \"pretend to connect\" but couldn't even get an address/dhcp info). \nI don't know if updating it would be possible, if it's based on Ubuntu 10.04 it was a LTS release, but the desktop version was only supported until 9 May 2013, the server version is supported for another 3 months (until April 2015) so an update might be possible?\nBut it might be more up-to-date to take a current Ubuntu (maybe Xubuntu or even Linux Mint XFCE) and install the programs that you'd like, reading them from the current Qimo's program menus, or it's installed packages (but there's dozens of packages that aren't the main programs) [ How to list all installed packages ].

I have never used VNC before, and I have trouble now connecting from my laptop to the workstation. Both machines are Ubuntu 14.04. To play around, I first went to \"enable desktop sharing\" and enabled desktop sharing on the workstation:\n\nThen I started the remmina client. I entered the server name, otherwise left everything as it was (for example, RDP as the protocol name), and clicked on \"Connect\". The client seems to connect, i.e. there is a window created, and if I disconnect my laptop from the network or mistype the server name, no window is created.\nHowever, the window is all black. Nothing happens. On the server side, the icon of the server should light up, the server should ask me for confirmation. No such thing happens. I have no idea where to look for error messages and / or log files.\n\nA: Always try to simplify your problem: first turn off everything that could cause problems (like security or notification)\nThen in your remmina client, change the RDP protocol to the VNC protocol and try again.\nAfter that works, turn on the notification, then the security...\n;-)\n", "Q: Find out the Metadata of PDF file by using PDF Printer I installed a PDF Printer on Linux Ubuntu version,so whenever i print any document the PDF Printer generates the .PDF file,Now I wants to find out the metadata of the generated pdf file when i will give print to any document.Is there any chance,please let me know.\nThanks,\nSrinivas\n\nA: You can use pdfinfo from Terminal: \npdfinfo MyThesis.pdf\n\nYou will get results like this:\nTitle:          Analysis of Markov chains\nSubject:        \nKeywords:       thesis, masters, cal poly\nAuthor:         **************\nCreator:        LaTeX with hyperref package\nProducer:       pdfTeX-1.40.14\nCreationDate:   Tue Jun 10 21:44:48 2014\nModDate:        Tue Jun 10 21:44:48 2014\nTagged:         no\nForm:           none\nPages:          99\nEncrypted:      no\nPage size:      612 x 792 pts (letter)\nPage rot:       0\nFile size:      10321297 bytes\nOptimized:      no\nPDF version:    1.5\n\n(If you are using cups-pdf you can run an automated postprocessing command by uncommenting and editing  cups-pdf.conf's \"PostProcessing\"  section.

I'm trying to install the personal use version of Landscape to manage my Ubuntu servers at home and I followed the instructions on this page: How do I install Landscape for personal use?\nHowever it completely took over my Apache config and stopped the other components I had running. \nCan I run Landscape on a server with other components or do I have to give it a dedicated Ubuntu install?\n\nA: Landscape requires a dedicated install; Like most management systems, it is not made to \"share\" a web server with other workloads.\nIf you are using it just to manage a few machines for home use and load is therefore not an issue, you could run it within a virtual machine.  This is not a best practice for production, but it may work in your case - or you could simply use a cloud instance.\n\nA: The landscape-server-quickstart package is meant to be an easy way to try out Landscape, but as a consequence it \"takes over\" the machine as you say.\nYou can take more control over the Landscape installation if you want, but then you need to perform a few tasks manually, including future upgrades.\nTake a look at this guide for the manual installation version:\nLDS/ManualInstallation14.10 | Landscape Help\nIt has an Apache vhost template that you can tweak if you want, and as a result share your Apache installation with other services. But you are on your own there.\nThat guide is geared towards using two machines: one for the application, one for the database. You can install it all on the same machine if you want, of course, just adjust accordingly.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 fans running full speed issue Only a newbie to linux so please bear with me.\nI have an ASUS P6T SE motherboard with an Intel Core i7 i7-920/2.66GHz 8MB Cache Quad Core Processor i have 4GB of DDR3 RAM and a ATI Radeon 4890 1GN PCI Express graphics card.\nI am running Ubunutu 14.04 but using the Xubuntu version.\nBasically all i use this for is running Kodi Helix but the fans are running at full speed as soon as i startup, i would leave the desktop sitting there doing nothing and the fans still run at full speed.

This question is pretty much a duplicate of this question. However I'm starting this question, because all the answers in the other question seem to focus on how to setup a custom shortcut for gnome-system-monitor, while the actual question is why does it not work?\nThat is I make a custom shortcut to launch gnome-system-monitor. I make sure that the System Log out is disabled (which is ctrl+alt+del by default). When I bind the gnome-system-monitor shortcut to anything else (say ctrl+alt+[), everything is fine and the system monitor starts.\nBut nothing happens when I assign it to Ctrl+Alt+Delete.\nThis is in Ubuntu 14.04 and I now this shortcut worked in previous versions.\n\nA: Try setting it using Compiz, after disabling it from System Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts tab:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ccsm\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n*Run it and enable Commands plugin\n\n*Set it the command in Commands tab & shortcut in Key Bindings tab\n\n\nActually, setting custom shortcut from System Setting works too for me.

They are selling it as a complete distro on a usb stick. It clearly shows UBUNTU when booting and at the login screen. Am I able to freely copy this distro and are the company selling it in breach of the Canonical rules?\n\nA: I'm not a lawyer and this shouldn't be conceived as legal advice but there are two issues: copyright and trademark.\nFirst the GPL. This is the most restrictive set of licenses used in Ubuntu. Your redistribution is likely going to be classified as an aggregate distribution (you're just distributing a closed source application alongside open source software). On this GNU says:\n\nThe GPL permits you to create and distribute an aggregate, even when the licenses of the other software are non-free or GPL-incompatible.\n\nHowever, if your software depends or links to GPL software, it's not aggregate and then you have bigger issues. If you aren't sure, talk to a lawyer, talk to GNU and talk to the FSF. They'll probably be able to explain exactly where you fall and where you need to be in order to comply.\nYou may also have separate requirements to make the source to the Ubuntu packages available but given Canonical also has this requirement, you should be fine indefinitely. But read the whole GPL FAQ thing before you assume anything... And again, talk to a real lawyer —not just some weird green guy on the Internet— if you want indemnification from your actions.\nThe Ubuntu trademark is the next major consideration. Canonical is protective of its IP but they allow various things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shipping it installed on something with your application on top might not be an issue. It might. It depends how you interpret \"associate it with the Trademarks\". Urgh, I hate IP law.\n\n*Shipping a custom Ubuntu with your application likely is an issue.\n\n\nEither way if you just assume that anything you do is going to annoy Canonical, you'll be safest. Talk to them and either get permission in writing or debrand it. Again, the ear of a paid lawyer will probably help you out here a lot.\n\nA: According to Ubuntu ‘Intellectual property rights policy’, you can not do that:\n\nAny redistribution of modified versions of Ubuntu must be approved, certified or provided by Canonical if you are going to associate it with the Trademarks. Otherwise you must remove and replace the Trademarks and will need to recompile the source code to create your own binaries. This does not affect your rights under any open source licence applicable to any of the components of Ubuntu. If you need us to approve, certify or provide modified versions for redistribution you will require a licence agreement from Canonical, for which you may be required to pay. For further information, please contact us (as set out below).\n\nIf you do not want to rebuild Ubuntu, you might consider using a more free operating system, such as Debian GNU/Linux, for example. Its trademark policy does not state clearly how tolerant it is to unofficial images (in particular, ones that contain some non-free software), but it seems to be much more friendly in general; also I did encounter unofficial images that used ‘Debian’ name. Anyway, you’d better ask about it somewhere else. debian-legal@lists.debian.org might be approriate place, I guess.\n\nA: It seems that selling an actual USB or DVD containing Ubuntu would be OK, but only because of charging for the actual USB / DVD and \"shipping/handling,\" I think.\nIf there are other, paid programs on the USB, and Ubuntu is just there \"incidentally,\" that could be something different...\n\nA: You can copy and sell Ubuntu disks. This is from the Ubuntu Licensing page:\n\nWhile Ubuntu will not charge licence fees for this distribution, you\n  might want to charge to print Ubuntu CDs, or create your own\n  customised versions of Ubuntu which you sell, and should have the\n  freedom to do so.\n\nYou may copy Ubuntu, but if they include their own binaries, their licensing terms apply. So if they prohibit copying of their binaries, you can only copy the 'free' parts of Ubuntu.\nAdditionally, the Ubuntu page states, that the trademark for the 'Ubuntu'-brand is a different issue than the software licenses. So I guess it depends how they use it, for it to be a problem. Here the part I'm referring to:\n\nCopyright licensing and trademarks are two different areas of law, and\n  we consider them separately in Ubuntu. The following policy applies\n  only to copyright licences. We evaluate trademarks on a case-by-case\n  basis.\n\n", "Q: How to install sympy for Python 3.4 I installed the Python scipy stack using the following command taken from here\nsudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose\n\nHowever, I can import sympy only in Python 2.7.6 which is the default Python version when I type in python in the terminal.

Maybe the bootloader was just changed... If you're still running Ubuntu, or running a live dvd/usb, the command\nsudo parted -l\n(and maybe sudo fdisk -l if you're using MBR only) should list all your local disk partitions & current device names, maybe they're still there.\nIf they were all deleted, then further writing to the disk could overwrite more data, and doing as Takkat suggests would be the best idea.

The first couple of hours when something goes wrong have a look and see whether it's network-related or not.\n\n\nAND\n\n\n*\n\n*A script, running on your local machine that renames a file every 2 seconds on one of your NFS directories and logs the times when it cannot.\n#!/bin/bash    \nwhile true \ndo\n  mv /szNFSMount/TestFile.1 /szNFSMount/TestFile.2\n  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n    echo $(date) >> /var/log/NFSMount.log\n  fi\n  sleep 2\n  mv /szNFSMount/TestFile.2 /szNFSMount/TestFile.1\n  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\n    echo $(date) >> /var/log/NFSMount.log\n  fi\n  sleep 2\ndone\n\nWhy these two together?  ping is extremely low level: data link layer and the other one is extremely high level: Application layer. Together they make for unrefutable proof.\n\n\n*Do NFS debugging... It's tricky stuff and you need to have root access to your own machine.

I have windows 8 host and i have installed ubuntu 14.10 server as a virtual machine in vmware. i have installed LAMP server and i am trying to host a website from it. i have created a virtual host. my website is accessible in the host machine when i go to the address 192.168.0.106.\ni have connected the internet through a wifi router. i don't have a static ip. when i go to my router info, i get this:\nLAN\nMAC Address :B0:C5:54:83:90:FA\nIP Address :192.168.0.1\nSubnet Mask :255.255.255.0\nDHCP Server :Enabled\nINTERNET\nMAC Address :B0:C5:54:83:90:FB\nIP Address :10.30.195.241\nSubnet Mask :255.255.224.0\nDefault Gateway :10.30.192.1\nDNS :113.193.5.23\n113.193.12.14\nwhen i search for \"what is my ip\" in google, i get this: 113.193.56.198, both in host and guest os.\nnow, my issue is that how do i access my site from the internet? i know that i will have to edit hosts file and virtual host config file in ubuntu, but which ip address do i have to use? do I need to set up a dns server? i have a domain registered in godaddy, i want to know which ip address should i put in \"points to\" in the domain setting page.\nbasically, i want to know which ip address should i type in address bar to go to my site, even if it works for only one day, and how do i edit the hosts file and configuration file in ubuntu to use that ip. i have tried searching in many forums and have not found the kind of clarity i need.\n\nA: Short answer: You can't\nLong answer: The only way that I know is using a dynamic dns server, but AFAIK there is no free dynamic dns that will work with a custom domain name. And the solution is so cheese that paying for a fixed IP is much more reasonable.\nNormal DNS will never work, as usually your IP will change faster than dns propagation.\nIn any case you will need to put your public IP (113.193.56.198 now) in a browser(1) to access your site and this is what you should put in \"points to\" in the domain page.\n(1) To make this work in your LAN you will need to meddle with DNS settings and host files. You can try it from outside you LAN, usually the easiest way to test it is to disconnect your phone from your wifi (if it is connected) and try from it.\n\nA: Router WAN IP Address 10.30.195.241 means your provider NAT'ed you (it's not legal in some countries to call such service \"Internet access\" by the way): supplied you internet access without global IP address through it's NAT router ( 10.30.195.241 - is local IP address not visible from Internet).\nSome possible ways\n\n\n*\n\n*Pay your ISP for global (and preferbly static) IP address if available. Set up port forwarding at you router to VM's IP. Access your web-server with that global IP address.\n\n*Use VPN service with global (and preferbly static) IP to bypass providers NAT. Setup port forwarding at VPN service or, if unavailable, create VPN tunnel directly from VM. Access your web-server with that global IP address.\n\n*Set up IPv6 address, either at Windows host or Ubuntu guest, and use any IPv6 transition mechanism to connect to IPv6 Internet. Eg. Windows has build-in Teredo tunneling for this. Access your web-server with that IPv6 address.\n\n\nAlso, you could add DNS record for easier access to IP address or use DNS name supplied by ISP/VPN service/etc.\n\nA: Take a look at this site: freedns.afraid.org it supports open DNS and can update custom domains. I use it for personal websites etc works a treat. \nIf you need any help setting it up if be more than happy to help :)\n", "Q: Forbidden You don't have permission to access /UI on this server i dont know what is wrong.\ni tried almost everything to fix the issue\nmy apache2.conf:\nhttp://pastebin.com/qF16MCYd\nerror in browser\nForbidden\nYou don't have permission to access /UI on this server.\nAdditionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.\ni hope you guys can help me out!\n\nA: in your appache conf file, you do not declare access to /UI, you need to add a Vblock such as : \n<Directory \"/UI\">\n  AllowOverride None\n  Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\n", "Q: SED (self encrpyting disk) is crashing on system resume I have asked this question before (here and here )\nMy problem is that my Self Encrypted Disk (SED) have to NOT spin down even on suspend! \nI have tried this, but it did not work and the disk spin downs anyway ! \nThe problem is that if the disk spins down, because it is on suspend, it does not show the \"de encryption\" prompt, and boots back up on RAM, but crashed due to IO error on the disk!

In other words, if you simply reboot the computer or put it into sleep, the drive remains unlocked. It is not until you completely power off the computer that it will again require the Authentication Key to be entered.\n\nAnd then goes on to talk about motherboards that support SED to go along with the drive.\nNow when a system is normally put into suspend, the power to that bus is cut, which explains what's happening in your case as it's supposed to ask you for your password in that event. What the intent appears to be with SED drives is that a SED Motherboard has the smarts to keep the drive alive just enough to stop it from locking.\nSo given that information. I suspect that either your motherboard doesn't support SED or it's configured incorrectly.\n", "Q: LightDM login Background Sync with Nitrogen I use nitrogen to control my background in openbox.\nIs there a way to sync this with LightDM login so that I have the same background on the log in screen as on openbox?\n\nA: This worked for my computer (Ubuntu 14.10)\nRun it when you change the nitrogen background.\nNote: Do NOT run this code as root; it will ask for root when nessarary!\n#! /bin/bash\n# backgroundsync.sh -- Sync background between nitrogen and lightdm\nIMAGE=`cat ~/.config/nitrogen/* | grep \"file\" | cut -d \"=\" -f2 | head -n 1`\n\nsudo xhost +SI:localuser:lightdm\nsudo su lightdm -s /bin/bash << END\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter draw-user-backgrounds 'false'\ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter background '$IMAGE'\nEND\n", "Q: Limiting curlftpfs/sshfs overhead in Nautilus, or any other file manager I've automounted four FTP directories with curlftpfs and two SFTP directories with sshfs in my /etc/fstab on Ubuntu Desktop 14.04. \nWhen I open the /mnt folder in which all directories are mounted, already this operation (getting the list with the six folders) takes a long time. I analyzed this with tcpdump, and it turns out curlftpfs/sshfs has a huge overhead. In fact, it's not curlftpfs'/sshfs' problem. The problem is that the file explorer wants to know how many files there are in the directory, and keeps downloading lower directories.\nI'm more interested in being able to select the folder quickly than in knowing from the higher level screen how many files there are one level lower.

When you are not connected to that network, the proxy settings are invalid and the updates/installs will fail.\nThe best way to fix that will depend how often you update your system at work versus away from work, either:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you usually update at work, but want to run apt-get occasionally when your connected to another network, you should be able to override the configuration setting on the command line by adding -o Acquire::http::Proxy=false to the command e.g. \nsudo apt-get -o Acquire::http::Proxy=false update\n\n\n*If you rarely use the work proxy, then you could consider removing or disabling it altogether: this is probably easiest using the synaptic package manager, by going to Settings-->Preferences and then selecting the Network tab, and making sure it is set to Direct connection to the internet:\n\nIf you don't have synaptic you can edit the proxy settings manually - you should find them either in file /etc/apt/apt.conf or one of the fragments in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ and it will probably look something like\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://aptcache.intranet.ics:3142\"\n\nwhich you can either comment out, or explicitly set to\nAcquire::http::Proxy DIRECT\n\n\n*If you want apt to auto-detect whether the specified proxy is available, and make a direct connection if it isn't, then apparently there is a way to do that as well - see this previous answer at How do I ignore a proxy if not available?\n", "Q: I have grub installed twice, what will happen if I remove the 1st install? My hard drive:  \n\n\n*\n\n*sda1: SUSE\n\n*sda2: new Ubuntu, installed yesterday\n\n*sda3: win7\n\n\nWhen I turn on my PC it always uses the SUSE boot loader. When I format the partition with SUSE will my PC automatically start using Ubuntu's grub or will I have to install/repair something?\n\nA: The files your current grub uses are on the SUSE partition, so if you remove that partition, grub will fail.  Rather than jump off the cliff, just run Ubuntu, and install grub from there\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nThat will then have grub using files on the Ubuntu partition, and you may freely remove the SUSE partition.\n", "Q: How can I use SSH aliases with rsync? I can successfully use command ssh myVDShost without password to connect my VDS host.\nBut when I use command sudo rsync -azP myVDShost:/home/ /mnt/myextdisk I get error:\nssh: Could not resolve hostname ssh: Name or service not known\nHow can I use SSH aliases with rsync?\n\nA: I have no problems using Host aliases defined in .ssh/config with rsync. Perhaps you shouldn't be using the sudo, which might make SSH use root's settings.\n", "Q: port forwarding \"server cluster\" The reason I put server cluster in parentheses is because I'm not sure if my set up counts as a server cluster. I have an ubuntu LAMP server running a wordpress website that works great. the domain name is set up and I have had no problems with it. I set up an owncloud server on a raspberry pi that I just purchased which works on my local network only. How do I port forward both servers to be able to be reached on an outside network if my wordpress server is already listening on port 80?\n\nA: The difficulty here is that your rasberry pi doesn't have a fix IP and is by default not reachable from the outside because your router is a firewall. The following would still work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup your owncloud-Linux to create an ssh reverse tunnel to your outside box on every boot (using key authentification). A ssh reverse tunnel allows that talking to localhost:8123 on the wordpress manshine would reach localhost:80 on the owncloud mashine. For more info search \"ssh reverse tunneling\", or try this.

( Have the Bell router DMZ to the IP of the Ubuntu Server as it already has 2 NICs.)\nThen the devices that I need to use port forward ranges I will give static IPs pointing to the Ubuntu DHCP\nOther devices like my phone , tablets etc I don't care what DHCP server they get there info from.\nOr... Is this a bad idea?\n\nA: Having 2 DHCP servers on the same network is definitely not a good idea, so I would do one of the 3 options below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn the DHCP service off on the Bell and add a wireless card (capable of playing AP) to the server and have it as the DHCP server\n\n*DMZ the server, but don't give it DHCP capabilites and run everything that needs to be connected to the server to a cheap switch that is connected to the server and assign the IPs manually and forward everything.\n\n*DMZ the server, fixed IP on both NICs and subnet the network.

Unfortunately, the compiling has not been going 100% and I often have to try redoing packages with different settings.\nTo make sure that things are working well, I have wanted to redo the packages again  when one fails, just in case. This of course means that I have to redo everything (which is a pain).\nHow do I save an exact copy of the drive and partitions so I can restore it when something goes badly wrong?\nIt needs to be exact (not just the files) because I have links to certain parts and partitions that I don’t want messed up.\n\nA: To complete this task, you should be able to use GNOME Disks. Install the gnome-disks package by running sudo apt-get install gnome-disks. After you do that, you should be able to find it somewhere in your menus. (It could be called Disk Management.) Choose the flash drive on the left side of the screen and click the gear icon at the top of the window. Choose \"Create Disk Image...\" and choose a place to save it. It will put it into a compressed .img file, but when restoring it back to the flash drive, you should use \"Restore Disk Image...\" instead of just extracting the .img file.\n\nA: Since you are doing the whole LFS thing, you want to learn the command line REALLY well.

My host development machine is a VM running Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS. My board is a Xilinx ZC706 with a Xilinx Z7045 Zynq SoC.\nWhen issuing a certain command (petalinux-boot --JTAG -- Whatever/option/I/use), I get a warning back that says \nrlwrap: $TERM is xterm but rlwrap can't find it in the terminfo database. \nExpect some problems. Inappropriate IOCTL for device\n\nI have googled and researched enough to know that rlwrap is a readline wrapper which is just wrapping up commands. I understand that $TERM is the environment variable that tells applications what kind of terminal (or more specifically, the terminal interface specifications) with which it must interact, and that terminfo is a database that contains the actual interface specs (/r /n color or not, whatever).\nWhen I run ls /usr/share/terminfo/x there are probably 20 or 30 variants of xterm-XXXXX or xtermX, but there is not a file named xterm. I am currently of the opinion that this is probably the cause for the above warning.\nWhen I get the above warning it is during the process of either downloading a bitstream to the FPGA part of the device or when using the Xilinx' XMD (xilinx microprocessor debugger) to download the linux image to the Processor side. These processes use an embedded JTAG module that is connected to my host via a USB cable.\nHow do I get/install a plain xterm entry into the terminfo database?\n\nA: So I figured this out. There is another compiled terminfo directory in /lib/terminfo/. I only needed to copy the xterm file from there to the above directory, so:\nsudo cp /lib/terminfo/x/xterm /usr/share/terminfo/x\n\nThe install dependancies of petalinux (which is really Yocto) include ncurses. I think that perhaps during the install process the terminfo xterm file either didn't get copied over to the appropriate directory, or maybe petalinux instructed the compiled file to be in this other directory. I don't know.

The command you should be using is:\ncp -a /path/from/21-01-2015 /path/to\n\nNote that you mentioned that the directory within \"from\" changes names. You have not mentioned whether or not the directory from the previous job remains behind. If the /path/from contains multiple subdirectories and you use a wildcard in your command you will copy over all the directories you have already copied (this may or may not be what you want). If you dont care about copying over subdirectories you have already copied in a previous cron job then you could use the following command to copy any file or folder that starts with a number (this will of course NOT copy \"month\")\ncp -a /path/from/[0-9]* /path/to\n\nIf you do not want to copy over every sub-directory of \"from\" each time the cronjob runs (i.e. you just want to copy over the files that have been added since last cronjob) you would be better served using rsync. The rsync command you would use would be something similar to:\nrsync -avz --exclude 'month' /path/from/ /path/to/\n\nbut please check the man page for the correct options to do exactly what you want (e.g. you possibly dont want verbose on in production).\n", "Q: CrashPlan only loads from terminal, not desktop I couldn't find this particular problem I'm having, so here it goes.\nOn Ubuntu 14.04, I can successfully launch CrashPlan by typing sudo CrashPlan or sudo /usr/local/crashplan/bin/CrashPlanDesktop.\nHowever, when I try to click on the Launcher CrashPlan icon or the desktop icon, nothing happens.

I am only one without OpenCL or it is a common problem?\nUPDATE: It appears that something removed /etc/OpenCL/vendors/nvidia.icd, which should have been installed with nvidia-opencl-icd-331, but it doesn't.\nIt started with BOINC. It refused to calculate Milkyway data specifically fetched for my GPU:\nStarting BOINC client version 7.2.42 for i686-pc-linux-gnu\n...\nCUDA: NVIDIA GPU 0: GeForce GT 520 (driver version unknown, CUDA version 6.0,\n compute capability 2.1, 1023MB, 999MB available, 156 GFLOPS peak)\n...\nRequesting new tasks for CPU and NVIDIA\nApp version needs OpenCL but GPU doesn't support it\nScheduler request completed: got 2 new tasks\n[error] App version uses non-existent NVIDIA GPU\n[error] Missing coprocessor for task de_modfit_fast_simulated15_136_free_1_14\n13455402_27741174_0; aborting\n\nSo I decided to check why there is no OpenCL.

I also tried to see if there is anything with opencl missing, but it seems fine.\nThe linked question says to install nvidia-modprobe. I am trying it right now. However, I don't get how this magic pill should work, and if it works - why it is not enabled by default? I also wonder if there should be some virtual package that does everything necessary to enable OpenCL?\n\nA: I don't exactly know why its happening or how somehow the problem is solved.\nFirst of all, the nvidia-331-uvm is not activated from the start (god knows why). So let's activate it:\n$ sudo modprobe nvidia-331-uvm\n$ sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/nvidia-uvm c 249 0\n\nThen if you do clinfo you'll have the same error about the ICD loader. Nonetheless, if you do it as root:\n$ sudo clinfo\n\nYou'll get a good result (E: -30), and then you're also able to run the command as a non-root user. Long story short:\n$ clinfo\nI: ICD loader reports no usable platforms\n$ sudo clinfo \nE: -30\n$ clinfo \nE: -30\n# then you run anything as non-root user\n\nThen, also darktable -d opencl works well, or any opencl program ;).\nUPDATE\nI finally added the next lines in my /etc/rc.local file:\n# begin opencl config\nmodprobe nvidia-331-uvm\nmknod -m 666 /dev/nvidia-uvm c 249 0\nclinfo\n# end opencl config \n\nThen everything works smoothly ;)\n\nA: I've spent two frustrating days trying to add gpugrid as a Boinc project. The Boinc log says, no usable GPUs found but without bothering to report why, so I quit and went to Windows 7 (which I hate to do) until Boinc, Nvidia, and Ubuntu get their acts together.\nThere is a lot of misleading information on the web to sort through. I did succeed in getting the Nvidia 355.11 driver installed using the new graphics PPA. I proved that the GTX 960 card and driver are recognized, however using a test from darktable from the default Ubuntu repositories I proved that OpenCL is not working even though the graphics card is working correctly as the computer video output device.

Looks like lightdm or something underneath looses connections with peripheral. Without knowing too much internals, I am thinking it can not be any lower than that since keyboard work on terminals.\nThere are no log entries of anything crashing in syslog, kern.log and dmesg.\nRestarting lighdm forces logout from ui. I can log in after entering my credentials, but after that nothing works.\nIs there a way to gracefully restart whatever is causing the problem so that I don't have restart my machine. I really hate to loose all my unsaved work especially when crash happens on something innocent like right on eclipse menu.\nNormally noticed the crash when displaying eclipse context menu - right click on some eclipse view. But not everytime. Might be because I spent lot of time in eclipse.\n\nA: I recently had a similar problem. I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 so the problem may have been completely different from yours, but I was able to fix it by re-installing Unity (Ubuntu's default desktop environment). \nTo be honest I don't remember exactly which commands I used, but here are a few  threads that were useful to me while troubleshooting this problem:\nHow do I reinstall Unity?\nReinstall `ubuntu-desktop` after removing Gnome\nThe first answer here is useful as well:\nHow to reinstall unity desktop on Ubuntu 14.04\nI remember using apt to check for missing dependencies and that there were few related to Unity.\n\nA: I think you want the old Ctrl+Alt+Backspace command enabled, to restart X. See this question for more info, it's basically:\n\n\n*\n\n*In a terminal, enter sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\n*press Enter 5 times to skip unrelated questions\n\n*until the \"Terminate the X server with Control+Alt+Backspace\" question, and set to Yes.\n\n\nIf you can get to another TTY/terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F2, etc) you could kill the window/display manager (I\"m not sure which ones you're using, different versions are available for XFCE/Xubuntu, Unity, gnome shell, etc) and should be able to restart it from there, somehow... maybe a lightdm --replace?\n\n\n*\n\n*Best preventative advice would be to save often, and set up auto-saves.

How do I get it to boot up when I plug it in to the USB port on any computer, surely I don’t need change boot order on every computer.\n\nA: Yes, you normally have to tell a computer to boot from a USB. They usually only boot from HD, or maybe CD/DVD.\n\nInsert the bootable USB flash drive that you just created in your target computer and restart it. Most newer computers can boot from a USB flash drive. If your computer does not automatically do so, you might need to edit the BIOS settings.\nRestart your computer, and watch for a message telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is booting to edit your BIOS settings. (On HP Mini Netbooks, they correct key is usually F9.)\nInstead of editing BIOS settings, you can chose a boot device from the boot menu. Press the function key to enter the boot menu when your computer is booting. Typically, the boot screen displays which key you need to press. It maybe one of F12, F10. Note: with some motherboards you have to select 'hard disk/USB-HDD0' to choose the USB flash disk. It may work like this because the system sees the USB drive 'a mass storage device' as a hard disk drive, and it should be at the top of the boot order list.\nSo you need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer, and how your USB key was formatted, you should see an entry for \"removable drive\" or \"USB media\". Move this to the top of the list to make the computer attempt to boot from the USB device before booting from the hard disk.\n\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick#Booting_the_Computer_from_USB for more info\n", "Q: Not able log in to ubuntu 14.04 I have just upgraded my ubuntu 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS.

Later there was a problem with Xubuntu, so I made a backup and re-installed it.\nThe wayt I made the backup, isn't exacly the right way of doing it (I'm not so familiar with this subject :) ):\nI cnnected the USB stick to a running Windows computer and just copied all the files I found there form the USB stick (\"My Computer\") to the windows computer.\nThe files I copied are some folders (e.g. .disk, boot, casper, dists, EFI and some more.) and some files (e.g. casper-rw, md5sum.txt, menu.c32, README.diskdefines, syslinux.cfg and more.)\nNow I want to recover some files from my desktop in Xubuntu in order to edit them in Windows or even linux.\nI notices in the folder casper there are few files:\n\n\n*\n\n*filesystem.manifest\n\n*filesystem.manifest-remove\n\n*filesystem.size\n\n*filesystem.squashfs\n\n*initrd.lz\n\n*vmlinuz.efi\n\n\nThe biggest file there, filesystem.squashfs, weights almost 1 GB, so I have a reason to beleive that this file contains my files from Xubuntu.\nHow can I exctract them?

Especially given the iso in the VM's \"cd drive\", I'm suspecting there might not be any saved files to recover, unless the VM saved them somehow...\nBut, maybe using a USB it did let you save persistent data.

Or Do we need to install & configure a mail server; If so which packages / binaries we use?\n\nA: You could do some of that through Postfix (and a SASL authentication library). You could certainly allow users to send emails.\nThe \"undelivered/opened\" tracking is done by making every image in the email have unique URL for that recipient. When they are requested by the email client, you know your email to that person was delivered. This means you need to pre-process the emails to alter the URLs and then have something that's logging the requests on a webserver.\nSimilarly, usage tracking is done by converting any links in the email in a similar way... So that if they click them, they're actually sent via one of your scripts that logs your click and then sends you to the right place.\nAnd what makes MailChimp (et al) most useful is fancy APIs so that users don't have to do all this stuff at their end. They can have HTML templates, submit email bodies and email lists (and MailChimp manages lists too). These are significant features that can be replicated but take significant developer time.\nWhat I'm saying is services like MailChimp aren't just SMTP relays. They do a lot of other stuff around the email sending process that makes bulk-emailing easy. If you just want to be a relay, you can do that all with Postfix.\n", "Q: sync google contact on gnome contacts I've installed Ubuntu 14.04 with Unity and I'd like to sync my contacts from Google on Gnome contacts without to pass via Evolution.\nI've tested it on Gnome Shell 3.14 and it run perfectly while on unity no.\nWhy? is there a app that I've to install on Ubuntu 14.04 Unity?\nthanks in advance.\n\nA: I've resolved that in this way\n\n", "Q: fswebcam multiply Devices Im new to Ubuntu.\nI try to capture images with fswebcam and 2 webcams.\nOperating System is Raspbian on a Bananapi.\nGD library is installed.\nlsusb find both webcams.\ntried following code: \nsudo fswebcam -d /dev/video0 /home/bananapi/photos/test.jpg \n\nthis code take one picture with one cam.

The great benefit is that pam_mount asks for the password only once and passes it over to the other PAM modules.\nHowever, if the PC is connected to a foreign network (so the Samba server is inaccessible), it times out for about 10s per share at login, whether in the default graphical console or in a text console.\nWith the current 5 mounts, this means about 1 minute delay to log in.\nUPDATE: Here are the error messages seen when logging into a text console:\n[  465.088270] CIFS VFS: Error connecting to socket.

Nothing fancy - no additional config. From there, i deploy to LXC containers targeted at that host which will warehouse your MySQL and Wordpress instances in LXC - mind you we still haven't resolved reachability from the outside world and this will require a reverse-proxy server, such as haproxy to live on the \"ubuntu\" node.

But I'm not actually sure about the policy on this.\n", "Q: Is there any way to make Ubuntu not to suspend while a download in progress? Is there any way? \nHow to script in /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d to check ${downspeed eth0}, ${upspeed wlan0}, ${upspeed eth0} and ${downspeed wlan0} and to set the system  not to suspend while a download in progress but only turn screen off? \nMy OS is Ubuntu 15.04.\n\nA: Inspired by @ByteCommanders second comment, the script below does what you describe: assuming the downloads folder is the directory you download into, it disables suspend during download, and subsequently waits for five minutes (arbitrary to set) before re- enabling suspend, to make sure the download is really finished. You can set any other directory to be watched as download folder.\nHow it works\nIn a loop (once per 20 seconds), the script checks the size of the targeted folder with the command:\ndu -ks ~/Downloads\n\nThe script compares each check with the last one, to check for download activity (increase of size). If there is no activity for more then five minutes (but you can set any other \"wait\" time), the script assumes no download is going in, and \"normal\" suspend is (re-) enabled.\nThe other way around: if the script sees increasing size of the ~/Downloadsdirectory, it disables suspend, until no activity was detected for more then five minutes.\nLow on juice\nThe script's commands are extremely low on resources. Since the cycle runs only once per 20 seconds (as it is), The processor load is practically none.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n#--- set suspend time below (seconds)\nsuspend_wait = 300\n#---\n\n#--- you can change values below, but I'd leave them as they are\nspeed_limit = 0      # set a minimum speed (kb/sec) to be considered a download activity\nlooptime = 20        # time interval between checks\ndownload_wait = 300  # time (seconds) to wait after the last download activity before suspend is re- activated\n#---\n\nt = 0\nkey = [\"gsettings\", \"get\", \"org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power\", \"sleep-inactive-ac-timeout\", \"set\"]\n\nset_suspend = key[0]+\" \"+key[-1]+\" \"+(\" \").join(key[2:4])\nget_suspend = (\" \").join(key[0:4])\n\ndef get_size():\n    return int(subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\").split()[0])\n\ndef get(cmd):\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ncheck_1 = int(get(\"du -ks ~/Downloads\").split()[0])\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(looptime)\n    try:\n        check_2 = int(get(\"du -ks ~/Downloads\").split()[0])\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n    speed = int((check_2 - check_1)/looptime)\n    # check current suspend setting\n    suspend = get(get_suspend).strip()\n    if speed > speed_limit:\n        # check/set disable suspend if necessary\n        if suspend != \"0\":\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", set_suspend+\" 0\"])\n        t = 0\n    else:\n        if all([t > download_wait/looptime, suspend != str(download_wait)]):\n            # check/enable suspend if necessary\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", set_suspend+\" \"+str(suspend_wait)])\n    check_1 = check_2\n    t = t+1\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as no_suspend.py\n\n*In the head section of the script, set the desired \"normal\" suspend time (since the script will re- enable suspend):\n#--- set suspend time below (seconds)\nsuspend_wait = 300\n#---\n\n\n*If you want, you can set other values:\n#--- you can change values below, but I'd leave them as they are\nspeed_limit = 0      # set a minimum speed (kb/sec) to be considered a download activity\nlooptime = 20        # time interval between checks\ndownload_wait = 300  # time (seconds) to wait after the last download activity before suspend is re- activated\n#---\n\n\n*Test- run the script with the command:\npython3 /path/to/no_suspend.py\n\n\n*If all works fine, add it to your startup applications: Dash > Startup Applications > add the command:\npython3 /path/to/no_suspend.py\n\n\nA: UPDATE (2016-06-11): Since first writing the script underneath it has grown into a full blown program that determines when to suspend based on \n\n\n*\n\n*Network Traffic\n\n*User Activity\n\n*CPU load\n\n\nI have published it on Launchpad here https://launchpad.net/keep.awake under a GPL license.\nThere is no snap package or deb yet but I'll get around to it eventually.\nIn the meantime you can download this and uncompress it to use.\nIt works like a proper command.\nType --help to see a full listing of what can be done. The examples underneath are only a few:\n./keepawake.py --help \nTo run interactively:\n./keepawake.py \nTo run as a background service:\nnohup ./keepawake.py -r > /dev/null 2>&1 & \nTo run as background service and set 15 min (900 sec) as the user activity idle time before it determines that the user is idle:\nnohup ./keepawake.py -u 900 -r > /dev/null 2>&1 &\nTo run as background service and set minimum CPU load as 13%:\nnohup ./keepawake.py -c 13 -r > /dev/null 2>&1 &\nTo run as background service and set minimum network traffic as 5KB (5120 bytes):\nnohup ./keepawake.py -s 5120 -r > /dev/null 2>&1 &\nTo run all three settings above (network, CPU, User idle) in the one go:\nnohup ./keepawake.py -s 5120 -c 13 -u 900 -r > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n\n[ORIGINAL POST]:\nBased on dhiya's response I have heavily modified the script.  It handles both network traffic AND user acitvity!\nI had to name it something so I named it \"Keep Awake\".\nGive it a spin and respond back if you have any questions or comments!\nRelease notes...\n\n\n*\n\n*Checks both user activity and network traffic based on thresholds\n\n*If either or both are above the threshold limits, the OS suspend-power settings are disabled.\n\n*My first modification of the code brought it down to Python 2.7.x I had to migrate it back to 3.4.x\n\n*Implemented a print that goes both to a log file and standard output using python 3 capabilities.\n\n*Added many data prints to determine state.  Very helpful for troubleshooting.\n\n*In the If-elif-else logic, I added count down counters.\n\n*Added many comments, hopefully helps those new to all of this.\n\n*Have bundled a logrotate configuration which you can use to manage the output logs indefinitely forever. (See Comments in History)\n\n*It is highly recommended that the logrotate cron be moved to cron.hourly\n\n*Makes use of xprintidle\n\n*logrotate config makes use of xz-utils\n\n*Repeated performance test has shown that cpu impact is virtually negligible. Only the xz compression algorithm run by logrotate can impact a single core up to 100%.  But it doesn't last long on modern cpus plus it is single threaded. So your other cores can do other work. It will only compress logs that are a couple of days old or if larger than 20MB.\n\n*Once you are happy with the config, you can set it up using the distro's built-in Startup Applications launcher which will launch the program upon login to your account.  Make sure you have logrotate configured with the script-configuration underneath to manage the log files. You can tweak that to your pleasure as well.\n\n*16/09/2015 - version 2.1 - Added Force Graceful Suspension logic\n\n*16/09/2015 - version 2.1 - Program is now designed to run with sudo privilege and log to /var/log/Keep.Awake/ .  logrotate config will now default to multicore processing for compression and only rotate if greater than 1M. This requires xz-utils >= v5.2.0\n\n\nSample command to run in background\n    $ sudo nohup python3 Keep\\ Awake.v2.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n\nFILENAME: \"Keep\\ Awake.v2.py\"\n    #!/usr/bin/env python3\n\n    import subprocess\n    import time\n    import logging\n    import datetime\n    import sys\n\n\n    #--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    # Keep Awake\n    # version: 2.1\n    #\n    # PURPOSE:\n    # This program will check 'network traffic' AND 'user activity' and decide whether to enable the timer to suspend or cancel it.\n    #\n    # METHOD:\n    # The program checks the network traffic if it is greater than a certain treshold; if so it keeps the system awake; if not it checks for user activity.\n    # If the user activity is idle for a time greater than a treshold then it sets the timer to suspend.\n    # \n    # SAMPLE RUN COMMAND:\n    # sudo nohup python3 Keep\\ Awake.v2.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n    #\n    # History:\n    # 2015-08-22    DanglingPointer - Modified from https://askubuntu.com/questions/576525/can-i-prevent-ubuntu-being-suspended-while-a-download-is-in-progress/661085#661085\n    # 2015-09-12    DanglingPointer - Modified to version 2 and renamed \"Keep Awake\".  \n    #                               - Version two now prints to standard output as well as a log file information useful for troubleshooting.\n    #                               - Comes with a \"Kee,Awake.v2.logrotate.config\" file which can be used with linux logrotate.d.

The VG is composed of 2 Physical Volumes (PV).  All of my LVs were created striped with 2 stripes each.  Running sudo lvs --segments was showing the list of LVs all having only one segment.  I've recently extended one of my LVs to increase it's size by 50G, using sudo lvextend -i2 -L+50G VGname/LVname and now I've noticed that sudo lvs --segments is showing 2 segements for the LV which I extended.  When viewd using the LVM GUI I can see that the two segements exist at different locations on each PV.  I imagine that this may reduce IO performance for that LV.  So I have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a better way to extend an LV which maintains just 1 segment?\n\n*Now that I ahve two segments is there a way to merge the segments into 1 again?\n\n\nThanks - JJB\n\nA: LVM is an abstraction layer to get you away from PVs and best run on RAID(0+1) or RAID5 systems where you have an enormous amount of disks and the LV which you build upon is more important then the PV.  \nAnd if you have spare PVs you can then move your LVs around as you see fit and as need shrinks or grows.\nSo if you're running on one PC with 4 disks, and you're never going to grow to 10, LVM is something extra to know just for the heck of it, but has no real tangential benefits.  It's always good to put on your CV though!  ;-) \nIf you're more worried about system performance then logical groupings and disk management, or only have 2 disks then just use tried-and-trusted disks, partitions and file systems.  :-)\n", "Q: Ubuntu updating stopped while processing apt-get update Ubuntu updating stopped while processing apt-get update:\n...\n\nIgn https://oss-binaries.phusionpassenger.com trusty Release<br>\nIgn https://private-ppa.launchpad.net trusty Release<br>\n100% [Working]\n\nIt remains such this for 15 minutes.

Here's a link & clip:\n\nFresh Player Plugin Sees New Release (Pepper Flash Wrapper For Firefox)\nDate: Wednesday, January 14, 2015\n  As you probably know, the latest Adobe Flash Player is available on Linux only via Google Chrome (it's bundled with it) while other browsers such as Firefox are stuck with an old 11.2 version.\nThe Adobe Flash Player plugin that's bundled with Google Chrome is in the form of a PPAPI (or Pepper Plugin API) plugin and Mozilla isn't interested in adding support for it. Because of this, Rinat Ibragimov has developed Fresh Player Plugin, a wrapper that allows Linux users to use Pepper Flash from Google Chrome in Firefox and other NPAPI-compatible browsers.\nNote that according to its GitHub page, Fresh Player Plugin \"mostly works, but some essential APIs are still to be implemented\", so it may not work with some websites.\n\nHere are the pasted instructions for adding the WebUpd8 PPA & the Fresh Player Plugin:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Install Fresh Player Plugin in Ubuntu (via PPA), by using the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install freshplayerplugin\n\nYou can also download the deb from HERE but installing it without adding the PPA means you won't get updates!\n  \n*Fresh Player Plugin is just a wrapper for libpepflashplayer.so so it needs this file which is bundled with Google Chrome. The easiest way to get this file is to simply install Google Chrome Stable - download it from here, then install it. That's it!\nThere are other ways of getting libpepflashplayer.so but I won't post installation instructions for all of them here. Instead, I'll just list them below:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*if you're using Google Chrome Unstable, create a symbolic link from /opt/google/chrome-unstable/PepperFlash to /opt/google/chrome/ or add a freshwrapper.conf file and add the /opt/google/chrome-unstable/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so path there - see step 3;\n  \n*you can install Pepper Flash using 2 other ways: via the installer available in the official Ubuntu 14.04 repositories and via the Pepper Flash PPA which is also available for older Ubuntu versions - once installed, then you'll need to create a symbolic link for Pepper Flash to /opt/google/chrome/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so or see step 3 for how to change the path to it.\n  \n  \n\n\nA: I found installing via the Ubuntu Software Centre most painless and reliable.\nAt some time or other there had been a problem that had me cursing Adobe.

This laptop originally ships with Windows 8.1, but I happily deleted that straight away.\nThe boot was done in EFI, with secure boot on, and through the standard install option from a USB created with pendrivelinux. It all seemed to go well and install correctly, but then I came across a problem which appears to be very common with Ubuntu installs: I had no boot option; my computer booted straight into the USB I used for the install, and the F12 boot menu showed no other possible selection. Upon inspection, I had what appeared to be the correct partitions (a FAT32 efi partition, and ext4 partition with Ubuntu on it, and a Linux swap partition).\nI tried all the standard fixes involving things like boot-repair to recover GRUB, but with no luck. I successfully installed a 32-bit version in Legacy BIOS, but this felt like a cop-out. What I've just done, and appears to have worked, is to go into the F2 BIOS menu, and under the \"security\" tab, enter an option called \"Select an UEFI file as trusted for executing\", where I followed the options \"HDD0\", \"EFI\", \"ubuntu\", and finally \"shimx64.efi\". I now have a boot option which appears to load Ubuntu!\n\nSHORT QUESTION:\nMy question is, what exactly did I do by selecting shimx64.efi as trusted for executing, is it actually the correct thing to do to fix my problem, and can I expect any repercussions some way down the line for dodgy practice..? If it IS the solution I was looking for (as it appears to be), why doesn't it happen automatically?\n\nA: What does shim do:\nshimx64.efi is a relatively simple program that provides a way to boot a computer with Secure Boot active (or ON). On such a computer, an unsigned version of GRUB won't launch, and signing GRUB with Microsoft's keys is impossible, so shim bridges the gap and adds its own security tools that parallel those of Secure Boot. In practice, shim registers itself with the firmware and then launches GRUB.\nWhy do I need it?\nYour computer came with UEFI, an updated replacement of BIOS, that comes with all computer shipping with Windows 8 or above. In these computers the secure boot option is turned on by default in the UEFI. This is a requirement by Microsoft. You could turn secure boot OFF in the UEFI before installing Ubuntu and then you wouldn't need shim.\nWhy didn't it happen automatically?\nI don't know. The installer did put the shimx64.efi at the right location. It is not clear why it didn't activate it. Probably the installer did not expect secure boot to be ON, as you  deleted Windows 8.1. Consider filing a bug report against shim so that the developers are aware of the problem and can try to fix it. Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and enter the following command to file the bug report:\nubuntu-bug shim\n\nFor more details about shim see What is the difference between grubx64 and shimx64?\nHope this helps\n", "Q: If Windows 10 \"upgrade\" affects GRUB2 and screws up my dual boot with Ubuntu will I have to completely wipe my computer and start from scratch? I turned off Windows update because I read about problems with BIOS tinkering within the updates. Partitioning is not something I do on a daily basis so fear has been creeping up on me with updates to Windows and Ubuntu. So to clarify, if the Windows 10 \"upgrade\" affects GRUB2 and screws up my dual boot, will the partions I created stay? In other words, if the Windows 10 update corrupts BIOS or GRUB2, is there a way I can check if there are partitions that have not been corrupted? \n\nA: Who knows? It's the best part of a year away.\nThe reason I'm answering this rather than voting to close is because even though we don't know yet, it doesn't really matter. Even if Windows Calculator deep-fries GRUB every time you use it, the answer is the same: just restore GRUB.\nIf you're going to use Windows, the most important thing you can know is to keep a LiveCD around and know how to look for one of the GRUB reinstallation pages or  or a Boot Repair CD.\nWindows will always do what Windows wants to do, just learn how to cope with it. \n\nA: Given that the boot loader for Windows 10 is new, it stands to reason that they will install it.

I understand that you do not have the Dolby 'feel' because louder music tends to 'feel' of being of better quality, of course there is some difference that it makes, but I have the idea not much. \nYou can increase the volume in the audio settings with allowing volume to go beyond 100% then it amplifies up to 150% I think. You click on the speaker icon in the bar and then click sound settings and then you'll see where you can enable the volume-increase\n\nA: You can probably install an app called EasyEffects. It's an app that allows you to customize your audio settings such as equalizer and reverb, it'll probably will fix your audio issue and make it (hopefully) more High Definition. I've used it for a week now and it does make some diffrence in terms of the sound quality.\nAnd for the app installation, you can install EasyEffects through flatpak.\n", "Q: What causes the deviation in the wmctrl window move command About wmctrl\nWith wmctrl (not installed by default), we can get information on windows, their id, their geometry, the pid they belong to etc. We can also move or resize windows with several commands.

My question is about moving windows by wmctrl:\nGetting information\nWhen I run the command:\nwmctrl -lG\n\nI get (a.o.) the following information about the window in the picture(s)below:\n0x04200085  0 746  443  468  205  jacob-System-Product-Name Niet-opgeslagen document 1 - gedit\n\nIn column 3-5, the geometry information tells us the x/y coordinates and the width/height. \nMoving/resizing the window\nWhen I put these coordinates in the wmctrl command to move/resize a window, it should do nothing, since the coordinates are unchanged:\nwmctrl -ir 0x04200085 -e 0,746,443,468,205\n\nDeviation\nHowever, the pictures below show the window is moved downwards (28px to be precise). I assumed the reason was that the wmctrl window move command calculated with the working area (screen minus panel height), while the wmctrl -lG command calculated with  the total screen size. Then still 4px is unexplained however (the panel is 24px high).\nAlthough the deviation can very well be compensated in scripts, the fact that I don't understand the cause is not satisfying, so the question is:\nWhat is exactly the cause for this deviation?\n\nMoving a window with the exact coordinates in the output of wmctrl -lG should not move the window, but it does\n\n\n\nA: What's happening is that wmctrl is returning the geometry of the window inside the decorations (i.e. not including the title bar and borders) but is using the larger window position for the move.\n(Some command output lines removed : xdotool might not be installed)\n$ wmctrl -lG\n0x04000040  0 702  23   900  950  KMatrix dave@KMatrix: test – Konsole\n\n$ xdotool getwindowgeometry 0x04000040\nWindow 67108928\n  Position: 702,23 (screen: 0)\n  Geometry: 900x950\n\nThe next command prompts for the window of interest and returns the parent window which includes all the decorations and varies depending on the window theme in use.\n$ xdotool selectwindow\n25166060\n\n$ xdotool getwindowgeometry 0x18000ec\nWindow 25166060\n  Position: 700,0 (screen: 0)\n  Geometry: 904x977\n\nAs you can see, it's a different window; the X position starts 2px to the left (702-2) and the total width is larger by 4px (900+2+2) because the right border is also 2px.\nY is higher (above the top border, if any, and the title bar); height is larger because of all of that plus the bottom border.\nwmctrl moves the parent window to the desired [X,Y] position of the child window; width and height are applied correctly to the child, as shown in the \"before & after\" below.\n$ wmctrl -lG\n0x04000040  0 702  23   900  950  KMatrix dave@KMatrix: test – Konsole\n\n$ xdotool getwindowgeometry 0x18000ec   # (PARENT)\nWindow 25166060\n  Position: 700,0 (screen: 0)\n  Geometry: 904x977\n\n$ xdotool getwindowgeometry 0x04000040  # (CHILD)\nWindow 67108928\n  Position: 702,23 (screen: 0)\n  Geometry: 900x950\n\n$ wmctrl -ir 0x04000040 -e 0,702,23,900,950   # <----- \"MOVE/RESIZE\" *****\n\n$ wmctrl -lG\n0x04000040  0 704  46   900  950  KMatrix dave@KMatrix: test – Konsole\n\n$ xdotool getwindowgeometry 0x18000ec   # (PARENT)\nWindow 25166060\n  Position: 702,23 (screen: 0)    <----- Desired [X,Y] applied to parent\n  Geometry: 904x977\n\n$ xdotool getwindowgeometry 0x04000040  # (CHILD)\nWindow 67108928\n  Position: 704,46 (screen: 0)\n  Geometry: 900x950               <----- Desired [W,H] applied to child\n\nEdit: additional info.\nDesktop geometry, Viewport & Workarea\n$ wmctrl -d    # (KDE)\n0  * DG: 1680x1050  VP: 0,0  WA: 0,0 1680x1015  Desktop 1\n\n$ xdotool -v\nxdotool version 3.20140217.1\n\nhttps://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool\nRe: @Sneetsher tip in comments\n$ xprop | grep FRAME\n_KDE_NET_WM_FRAME_STRUT(CARDINAL) = 2, 2, 23, 4\n_NET_FRAME_EXTENTS(CARDINAL) = 2, 2, 23, 4\n\n\nA: I had the same problem and could find a workaround.\n\nSituation\nMy situation is based on Mate 16.04 with Compiz installed (which activates the gtk window manager)\nI am using a script connected to key-bindings to place windows on predefined places.\nThis script fails if I am not using the maximized option.\n\nAnalysis\nThe problem could be turned on and off by turning on and of the window decorations in the settings (compiz).\n\nWorkaround\nThe window decorations can be turned on and off using python for a specific window (using keybindings it is convenient to use the active window).\n#!/usr/bin/python\nfrom gtk.gdk import *\nimport gtk.gdk\nimport time\nimport sys\n\nw = gtk.gdk.get_default_root_window().get_screen().get_active_window()\nw.set_decorations(0) #use 1 to turn on decorations\nwindow_process_all_updates()\ngtk.gdk.flush()\n\nThen you can turn off window decorations, move the window, and turn on window decorations.\n", "Q: freeze on purple screen when installing 14.04 I've tried to install 6 different variants of ubuntu today and failed everytime always the same problem.\nIt boots up, I'm greeted with a screen that asks if I want to test or install ubuntu (there were probably more options) (I've tried both multiple times on different versions) it goes through a black screen with alot of words than reaches the purple screen with an ubuntu logo and 5 grey dots, one by one the dots turn red, then nothing.\nmy computer:\nacer aspire 5560\n4gb ram \nThe processor is an AMD A8-3500M APU.\n\nA: I had this issue with QEMU.

So ls is simply telling you that there are currently no ordinary (non-hidden) files or directories within your home directory. If you want to see hidden files and directories, add the -A or -a flags e.g.\nls -A\n\nSee man ls\n   -a, --all\n          do not ignore entries starting with .\n\n   -A, --almost-all\n          do not list implied . and ..\n\n\nA: Perhaps there's nothing in that directory?\nTry \"ls /\" which should list contents of root directory.\n\nA: As alternative, tree command gives you more complex information regarding directories in tree view.\nInstall it with sudo apt-get install tree\nand try to type tree /\n", "Q: gedit lags when changing cursor position With Ubuntu 14.10, gedit lags extremely even when only navigating C++ files.

It's tied to my computer through a SATA 2 to USB adapter. The 25-hour cloning operation seems to have worked fine; I used dd piped through pv.\nHowever, when I boot, I now get a message from GRUB2 saying that the partition is not found; then get dumped to the grub rescue prompt.\nls gives me a one-partition drive on hd0 (not sure what this is, possibly a thumb drive), a sequence of partitions on hd1, and a single-partition on hd2 (again, no idea what this is). (hd1,msdos10) seems to be a non-bootable partition that I keep around; most of the others (those on an ext file system) are recognized. I find my Ubuntu Trusty Tahr root on (hd1,msdos5). However, even after \"set root=(hd1,msdos5)\", all attempts at insmod (\"insmod normal\") and (\"insmod linux\") return \"Partition not found\".\nI'm guessing that the MBR of my new drive is not relevant to the partitions cloned onto it. What I'm not sure of is how to fix that. Again, the target drive is mounted externally (even though it's ultimately an internal drive); and I can boot to a LiveUSB or hda, but not it. It has a Windows 7 partition, Ubuntu 14.04, and a sequence of additional partitions inclusive of Windows Recovery/Repair/Whatever-They're-Calling-It, my extra partition at the end, my home partition, swap, and probably one or two other guys like temp.\nIn the worst case, I suppose I could reinstall all of Ubuntu 14.04, but that would require a lot of further time prying through the repos to get all my old stuff back. I'm sure this is simple, but the MBR is not the kind of thing I screw around with unless absolutely necessary, especially when I don't know what I'm doing and it's a potential 25-hour fix!\nQuoted terminal output from GRUB:\n ls\n\n > (hd0) (hd0,msdos3) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos1) (hd1) (hd1,msdos11) (hd1,msdos10) (hd1,msdos9) (hd1,msdos8) (hd1,msdos7) (hd1,msdos6) (hd1,msdos5) (hd1,msdos3) (hd1,msdos2) (hd1,msdos1) (hd2) (hd2,msdos1)\nls (hd0,1)\n > Filesystem is unknown\nls (hd0,msdos1)\n > Filesystem is unknown\nset root=(hd1,msdos5)\ninsmod normal\n> Partition not found\n...\n\n\nA: It sounds as though the new drive doesn't have the correct partitioning - if you're only seeing one. Did you pass the dd command '/dev/sdn' or '/dev'sdn1' to write to?I think your first task now is to remove the new drive, and see if you need to undo the MBR 'fix' - if so, there are several questions about that here with answers such as this.\nOnce you have a working system, you get to 'how to do this right':\nBackup is good - you probably don't need reminding just now :)\nI would start this from a live CD boot, for starters, as a live system may well change whilst being written - in fact almost certainly will.\nFirst, check where your old drive (source) is, then plug the new drive in, check where it went as the drive designation can vary - dmesg | tail or mount will do (but mount, only if the filesystem recognises it - I doubt yours will right now), or fdisk -l but care is needed to get them right. This is a crucial point!\nOnce you know which is which, you can do the copy;\ndd if=/dev/sdx of=/dev/sdy - note you do NOT use the partition numbers.\nYou can use pv but IMHO this complicates things if you're having trouble, you already know it takes ages. It will go a LOT faster if you plug the drives in directly.\nYou should end up with 2 drives the same, one having 50% unallocated space. Disconnect the new one, reboot to ensure all is well. This is not technically necessary, but I would..\nTurn off, plug in the new drive - direct or do the USB thing again if you prefer. Reboot. If it won't boot, your PC is allocating /dev/sda to the new drive, so using USB may be a good plan now.\nAt this stage you can use gparted to enlarge existing partitions, or fdisk to add a new one. Once done, you can swap drives and try a boot; you may need to go back to the top of this & try the link I gave to fix booting, depending what you changed.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 does not work wifi for Lenovo Y50-70 I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 to my computer (lenovo Y50-70) but wifi doesnt work. Could you please help me? \n\nA: Make sure that you install the proprietary BCM driver (open \"Additional drivers\" from dash).\n\n\nA: This sometimes works if you enter rfkill list all and find wifi is hard blocked\nsudo modprobe -r ideapad_laptop\nsudo rfkill unblock all\nI know they are working on a patch for the ideapad_laptop module to fix the rfkill issue when a hardware switch doesn't exist\n", "Q: Repartitioning Linux for Windows I have Linux installed on my computer, but I need Windows for some things that I can't do with Wine, so I wanted to use a dual boot. I haven't done this before, but I just installed Linux so I don't have any files to risk if I screw up anyways. When I open GParted I have 3 partitions that were set up when I installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1    fat32        512Mb \n\n*sda2    ext4         693Gb\n\n*sda3    linux-swap   4.97\nI thought I should reduce the ext4 partition so I could make one for Windows, but I can't resize it, the minimum and maximum options it gives are the same. I can't seem to do anything at all with the other two partitions either. What am I supposed to do to let me make a new partition?\n\nA: You can't resize sda2 partition while it's in use. You need to boot your computer using a live USB or DVD Ubuntu, and then start Partition Manager GParted to shrink sda2 to the right, creating necessary free space (20gb?) to create a new partition (ntfs) for Windows.\nBeware that your grub2 bootloader will be replaced with Windows boot manager and you won't be able to boot into Ubuntu immediately. You can only do this after restoring grub2 bootloader using some tool like boot repair disk (http://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd) after which you can have an option to boot into Windows as well as Ubuntu.\n\nA: OK, you want a 3 Partition Drive.  2 OS and 1 Data.  The first thing you need to do is understand one thing.  Windows and Linux has programs that only work with those OS' natively on the partition the OS is installed on.\nSo now that is covered. You need to back your data up on the Partition you are wanting the Data Drive to be on.  This will ensure something bad happens, you can know you have that data else where.\nNext you need to restart your PC.  Use a LiveUSB of either Windows or Ubuntu.  Enter Gparted/Fdisk depending on your USB.  Now, in order to use this fully you need to shrink your Ubuntu part to 50 GB.  Then  make an NTFS Part thats also 50 GB.  Finally make another part of the leftover space in NTFS.  Please note to keep the other two partitions.\nFinally install Windows.  After windows is installed, enter your UEFI Boot Manger in your BIOS and make Ubuntu the first choice to boot to.\nAfter you boot into Ubuntu, press Ctrl+Alt+T to access a Terminal to enter\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair \n\nAt which point you can boot into Windows if needed.\nThis data Partition makes it where you can access items from Linux just in case you need them from use in Windows, since Windows cannot see the Z: drive Ubuntu calls home.\n", "Q: Maintain IP address alive even when cable not plugged It's on a laptop running Ubuntu 14.04, where the WiFi wlan0 is used to connect to Internet. \nAnd eth0 (RJ45) is set statically in /etc/network/interfaces\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.11.168\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.11.100\n\nThe problem is, there is usually no cable connected to eth0, so at boot the IP address is not set.

Being not a wicd specialist (and don't intend to be), wicd was simply apt-get purged from the system. \nWithout neither Network Manager nor wicd the network behaves without bias (due to, I must confess, my incompetence in these high level tools).\nWhile managing everything manually requires a bit more time, the trade-off is a very reliable and un-surprising network.

I read that ifconfig will be interface level statistics, before the firewall.  Any particular reason for using the option, pointtopoint in interfaces config? Try remove it and use netmask 255.255.255.0 or 255.255.0.0 instead. If that also fail. I would guess with the rc kernel that it isn't a driver issue. And i would fall back to suspect faulty hardware, cable. For the cable are you using an \"Ethernet crossover cable\" for the direct connection? it might be that only one of your nics is able to detect and switch rx\\tx automatically.

Create swap at least equal to the size of your RAM and no more then twice your RAM.\nThen the system will ask you to create 100MB partition more and told you to marked as boot create that also after finishing installation go to BIOS and enable legacy mode also just when system is booting press F9 it will show you choice of the operating system to boot osbootmanager is for Windows and Ubuntu choose any one and boot if you will not choose anything windows will boot.\nNote: Preinstalled Windows 8.1 is installed as UEFI in a way that even without secure boot UEFI,boot-loader of Windows can boot as legacy also.\nIf you don’t like this method you can download the bootnext utility for dual boot after install\nhttp://www.boyans.net/blog/download-bootnext/\nHowever I’ve not downloaded it as of now just registered and waiting I am booting as what I’ve described as I am also using HP-15 notebook\n\nA: I have noticed in differents installations that some \"UEFI\" not let you install boot OS, so you can install Linux first and then install Windows.\n\nA: As a last-ditch attempt, I burned a LiveCD and voila I could boot into Ubuntu.

The installer utility cannot connect to the internet due to a proxy, and this prevents it from continuing Failed installation the install process.The console gives the following output, indicating that the program was indeed trying to download a file:\nFailed to download config file https://download.01.org/gfx/ilg-config.cfg\nWhile searching for the solution, I downloaded the source code of the installer and, after some investigation, discovered that it uses libsoup to fetch config file. \nSo my question is this:  is it possible to pass the proxy settings to a utility so that the proxy settings access a resource online? I have the proxy credentials.\n\nA: I'd assume it's exactly the contrary and ILGI isn't using the proxy. Quite a few programs don't read the desktop's proxy settings and therefore don't work behind a proxy. I experience this every day in my school.\nHowever, you can force such programs to connect through the proxy. For this, you have to start the program from a terminal, in which you set the proxy environment variables.\nIn your case, run the following commands in a terminal\nexport http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:1234\nexport https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:1234\nintel-linux-graphics-installer\n\nReplace proxy.example.com:1234 by the proxy address and port in your environment.\nAttention: Even when using HTTPS, FTP, or any other protocol, you will most likely have to use the same protocol for the proxy (HTTP in the example above).\n\nSite note for your own safety:\nIn the case of HTTPS, this means that your connection isn't private any more to a certain extent. Everything you do in the internet is routed through the proxy server, including the SSL handshake. So the proxy server (and with it its operators and people who illegally gain access to it) could at any time eavesdrop on your presumably safe connection.\nSo please don't do any E-Banking and other important things in a proxy environment where you can't trust the operator.\n\nA: Circumventing the proxy required a lot of source code changes.

You will have trouble after wiping it!\nUsually the default installation option should give you a \"/\" partition and a \"swap\" partition (on UEFI systems also that additional boot partition). According to this, I assume, that this \"unknown\" partition /dev/sda3 used to be your swap, as the size would fit as well, until something strange happened. (Aliens? Who knows... ;D) Anyway, it is neither recognized nor mounted and Ubuntu is your only OS on that machine, so it should be safe to delete it. Then you can allocate the freed space to a brand new swap partition! You will have to edit the fstab config file to have Ubuntu mount and use it automatically. (details here)\nYou can resize your \"/\" partition, but shrinking is only possible when it is unmounted. Therefore you have to boot Ubuntu/any other distro from a live-cd/usb. Run gParted from there and resize it as you want, depending on how much free space is left inside the partition. Be aware that modifying partitions always may lead to loss of data, so I recommend you to do a BACKUP first! The new unallocated space then has to be converted into a new partition and formatted as ext4 file system. Then go on and follow this guide which tells you exactly how to make that new partition become your /home location.\nGreetings and good luck.\n", "Q: PlayonLinux cannot install MS office 2010 spanish in Lubuntu 14.04.1 32 bit, winbind missing When I tried to install MS Office Professional Plus 2010 in spanish (only Word, Excel and PowerPoint) through PlayonLinux, an error message appears saying\n\nwinbind is not installed\n\nIf I try to install samba (there are two packages to choose, I tried both of them) through Lubuntu Software center to get winbind, it shows another error message: \n\ncannot resolve dependencies.

However I have a slew of questions that I hope this community can answer. Please bear with me :) To introduce myself I am an engineering student, and the reason I chose to do dual booting was to fit the needs of my various tasks. \n\n\n*\n\n*I want to have all my programs and files stored on the HDD, and have the SSD exclusively for OS and drivers. I want both Ubuntu and Windows to be able to grab files from the hard drive seamlessly.Basically I want to prevent any installations or files from saving to the SSD and redirect them to the HDD.\n\n*Do drivers need to be installed on both OS's? I installed the MSI driver on Windows but it works fine on both Windows and Ubuntu. Just curious.\n\n*In Windows I can only see the Windows partition in the Explorer however  in Ubuntu I can see the Ubuntu partition in addition to Windows one. Why is that?\n\n*Any other dual boot tips and tricks would be greatly appreciated\n\nA: In Ubuntu you cannot install programs on another partition but in Windows you can if you want a common partition to access files from windows and Ubuntu make one partition on your HDD as NTFS using Windows or gparted in Ubuntu, this partition would be accessible from both OSes. A FAT32 partition can only support 127GB of disk space on Windows XP so if you want a larger common partition go for NTFS.\nAs for Ubuntu drivers for your motherboard it has picked them itself unlike Windows where you have to specifically install all the drivers\nAs for your graphic card it is an MSI AMD Radeon R7 260X and you have a choice to install the fglrx proprietary drivers. Now you are using the open source X org Xserver drivers for display and not the proprietary graphic card driver.\nSearch for additional drivers from dash and choose your correct fglrx driver, click on it apply changes and reboot your system\n\nA: I think you got it all.\nAn ssd with 240gb wouldn't hurt for dual boot. The additional 1tb HDD is a must have. Install all your software there.\nHowever I recommend resize the 1tb HDD to 50% and create a Linux partition from Ubuntu on the empty part.\nLike: WinPrograms and LinuxPrograms.\n\nA: *\n\n*The native file system for Linux (Ubuntu) is ext4, which Windows does not support. Ubuntu can read and write to NTFS but with some limitations. So, what effectively happens is that Ubuntu can read Windows files but Windows cannot read Ubuntu files. So, the best thing I think, would be to have a separate FAT32 partition to share files between both OSes. \n\n*Usually everything 'just works'on Ubuntu but you might need to install third party drivers for additional funcitonality on Ubuntu. Ubuntu drivers worked not because you installed the MSI drivers on Windows. The Windows drivers and Ubuntu drivers are separate. You will need to download different versions for both.\n\n*Same reason as I stated for the first question. The difference in file systems.\n\n*Congrats on getting everything working.

The File, Insert, and other menus should appear there. At least, that was where they appeared by default for me on Ubuntu 14.04.\nI personally prefer that the menus appear on the title bar of the window I'm working in, so I changed the setting as follows:\nSystem Settings -> Appearance -> Behavior -> Show the menus for a window -> In the window's title bar\n", "Q: Lenovo g500 on ubuntu, battery won't charge over 59% When I had windows I used lenovo energy managment and set the battery to charge up to 60% only as it recommended it to me.

But, accessing it via http://my.site.com:8080/jenkins works.\nWhat next steps could I take to achieve this?\nUPDATE: I was able to visit the site by changing\nProxyPass /jenkins http://localhost:8080/jenkins nocanon\n\nto\nProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/jenkins nocanon\n\nBut, I would still like not to be able to visit it via :8080. Or is this something I shouldn't be attempting?\nEDIT: I managed to get everything setup. The main culprit was that I was defining the VirtualHost in each of the site config files, so sonar.conf and jenkins.conf both had the VirtualHost element. I removed that and both sites worked.\n\nA: In order for your proxy server to be able to pass your request to and the response back from the jenkins server on 8080, it'll have to be available, at least to itself, at jenkins_box:8080. \nRestricting access:\nFrom the wider internet\nIf both the jenkins instance and the proxy server are running on the same machine (as in your case), all you need to do to prevent someone from outside your LAN (someone accessing my.website.com from the wider internet) is simply NOT forward port 8080 from your router to your server. Forward just port 80.\nYou could have nearly identical virtualhost blocks, one for sonarqube, set to the servername sonarqube.mywebsite.com, and another for jenkins, set to jenkins.mywebsite.com. Forward only port 80 to that machine, and bingo bango, from the internet, the only way to get to those services is by those subdomains. \nOn your LAN\nSince the only device you want to allow to access server:8080 is server itself, inside the virtualhost directives for sonarqube and jenkins, you can set the Allow and Deny settings.\nFor example:\nOrder deny,allow\nAllow from 127.0.0.1\nWould go inside each virtualhost block. You may also want to specify the server's IP address as an additional allowed IP (pretending your server's IP is 192.168.1.12): \nAllow from 127.0.0.1 192.168.1.12\nThis is almost exactly the setup I have for several of my own services.\n", "Q: mount boot camp partition I have my hard drive from my mac it has a boot camp patition, but the mac is dead.\nUbutnu sees the partition, calling it /dev/sdc3 and reporting that it has a basic linux data partition.

I went to #fdisk -l | grep sdc\nand got\n/dev/sdc3   *       72850       72863      102400    7  HPFS/NTFS\nso then I tried:\n# mount -t ntfs /dev/sdc3 folder\n# mount -t hpfs /dev/sdc3 folder\n\nboth failed, telling me to look at dmesg | tail so heres that:\n[ 3408.950969] HPFS: Bad magic ... probably not HPFS\nand the fail for ntfs:\nmount -t ntfs /dev/sdc3 folder/\nNTFS signature is missing.\nsooo... what kind of partition is bootcamp? and how do I mount it?\n\nA: Apple's Boot Camp uses a hybrid MBR to help a BIOS-booted Windows coexist with an EFI-booted OS X. As noted on the linked-to page, hybrid MBRs are dangerous and trouble-prone. I suspect you may be running into a problem related to this. Your fdisk output seems to show the MBR side of things -- certainly the single line of output you've shown is consistent with either a pure MBR disk or a hybrid MBR, not with a pure GPT disk. (Hint: Don't be stingy with program output when posting questions; show the entire output of a command like fdisk -l /dev/sdc!)\nOne of the problems with hybrid MBRs is that the MBR and GPT sides can get out of sync. It's entirely possible that this has happened to you -- but that's speculative on my part. To know, you'd need to compare the start and end points of the GPT and MBR partition tables. To do this, run both gdisk -l /dev/sdc (to see the GPT side) and fdisk -l /dev/sdc (to see the MBR side), and compare the data.\nAnother possibility is that you're not accessing the correct partition. The MBR's /dev/sdc3 (which you've identified as being a Windows partition) may not be the same as the GPT's /dev/sdc3. This is a critical point because in Linux, the GPT side is what's used to create device identifiers, so when you tried to mount /dev/sdc3, you were probably mounting the GPT's /dev/sdc3, not the MBR's /dev/sdc3. (Of course, this assumes that the disk has a hybrid MBR, which isn't certain given the information you've presented, although I think it's likely.) Again, comparing the GPT and MBR data from gdisk and fdisk, respectively, will help you understand what's going on.\n", "Q: Cannot acess certain directory using CD command Cannot access CPP

I want to search for files that contains some Cyrillic word (example in .MS word .doc files) with GUI. I tried gnome-search-tool but it does not work with Cyrillic. It say: no files found\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: If you use gnome-search-tool to look for .txt or .rtf files containing any Unicode characters (including Cyrillic ), this just works.  However your example of .doc files is a bad one as these are binary files coming from a program that uses compression to store the text that you see on the screen in a proprietary format on disk, so there the gnome-search-tool does not work.\nThe workaround is to convert all your .doc files to .rtf and then you can open them and search them\n\nA: I don't have gnome-search-tool, but every *nix system has command line, and there are already tools there for finding files with particular strings inside them or in the names. So open the gnome-terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T and lets get started.\nBest suggestion is probably try to remember where you've placed the file in the first place? what directory ? I bet 99%  that it must be somewhere in your home folder. Remembering at least approximate location will aid the programs and commands discussed here in doing their job.\nN.B: I strongly suggest you read man pages for grep, egrep, find, ubuntu help page, other askubuntu posts as well as this cyberciti article\nSearching for files with cyrilic word in a name\nIf you know at least some command line, chances are you're probably familiar with command like ls , which lists the contents of a directory you're in. Now, what will happen if you do ls * ? This will list contents of directory with its sub-directories, and their contents too. What you can do now is\nls * | grep -i place-word-in-cyrylic here\nWhat happens here? You're getting all the contents of your home directory plus their subdirectories, and then filtering with grep by that word, where -i means dont be case sensitive. \nFor instance,\n\nHere I am looking for file HelloПриветИзКосмосаWorld which we did find. But it doesn't tell me where it is. find command solves the problem. Copy the name of the file you got and give it to find.

Copying and pasting of passphrase does not help too.\nA month ago I have successfully mounted the dm-crypt on the same live image to chroot.\nI have Ubuntu 14.04 installed and 13.10 live image on PXE boot.\n\nA: Well, the error \"No key available with this passphrase\" sounds like the key you're looking for is not in the LUKS header anymore. Could be the wrong passphrase, or could be something happened to that key, or the whole LUKS header. If you have a backup of the LUKS header you can try using it with the cryptsetup option --header\nAnd try the --verbose & --debug options too, maybe there'll be more info revealed. The action isLuks -v <device> might be helpful to see if it's still a recognizable LUKS device.\nAnd like the man cryptsetup page describes below, a LUKS header backup is important, (and look into the luksHeaderBackup and luksHeaderRestore actions too):\n\nLUKS header: If the header of a LUKS volume gets damaged, all data is permanently lost  unless\n         you  have  a  header-backup.  If a key-slot is damaged, it can only be restored from a header-\n         backup or if another active key-slot with known passphrase is undamaged.   Damaging  the  LUKS\n         header  is something people manage to do with surprising frequency. This risk is the result of\n         a trade-off between security and safety, as LUKS is designed for fast  and  secure  wiping  by\n         just overwriting header and key-slot area.\n\n\nA: Most likely you've mistyped your password.\nFollowing steps can help.\n\n*\n\n*Confirm you've the right device:\nsudo cryptsetup isLuks /dev/sda3 -v\n\n\n\n*Validate the header:\nsudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda3\n\n\n\n*Try initial few passwords (consider adding --debug for more output):\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen --test-passphrase /dev/sda3\n\n\n\n*Consider to backup the header:\nsudo cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/sda3 --header-backup-file luksHeader.bin\n\nNote: You can also consider to backup the whole device using dd.\n\n\n*Use header file to try different passwords: (quicker and safer than using the actual device)\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen --test-passphrase luksHeader.bin\n\nTo brutal force it, read more at: Receiving \"No key available with this passphrase\" with LUKS\n", "Q: How do you delete a file in ubuntu?

Any ideas as to how to get this sorted? I am using Ubuntu 14.04 with Unity, but have Nemo set as the default default fire manager.\n\nA: Answer from OP:\nSometimes when installing/upgrading a package, you get an error about it trying to overwrite some file which is also found in some other package and this results in a error that won't let you install/upgrade that package.\nIn most cases, such errors occur when some file was moved from one package to another in a newer version. Here is an example of such an error:\nUnpacking replacement smplayer ...\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/smplayer_0.6.9+svn3595-1ppa1~maverick1_i386.deb (--unpack):\n trying to overwrite '/usr/share/smplayer/translations/smplayer_eu.qm', which is also in package smplayer-translations 0.6.9-1\ndpkg-deb: subprocess paste killed by signal (Broken pipe)\n\nFixing this (in most cases but probably not all) is quite simple: look for path of the file that caused the error - in my first example that would be /var/cache/apt/archives/smplayer_0.6.9+svn3595-1ppa1~maverick1_i386.deb, and run the following command:\nsudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/smplayer_0.6.9+svn3595-1ppa1~maverick1_i386.deb\n\nIf --force-overwrite doesn't work, you can try --force-all instead.\nIn the above command, replace /var/... with the exact path to the .deb that caused the error on your computer. \nSource\n", "Q: How can I mirror one of the screens in a 3-monitor setup?

I want to be able to install Windows programs using Wine, but they have to be installed on the HDD. \nBy default, Wine creates a folder in the home directory /home/<user>/.wine where the installed Windows programs are saved. I want to change this to another location, such as /media/HDD/.wine\nIs there any possibility to achieve this in a simple way?\n\nA: I looked in the \"configure Wine\" window, but to change the C directory is greyed out:\n\nSimple solution: a link\nWhat simply works however is:\n\n*\n\n*Move the folder drive_c from ~/.wine/ to any accesible location of your choice (The c-drive is probably what you really want to move, since applications are stored in that directory)\n\n\n*Make a link from there into the folder ~/.wine/:\n  ln -s /path/to/the_other_location/drive_c ~/.wine\n\nThat should simply work (and it does on my system)\n\nA: I found the answer on Can I store the virtual Windows installation somewhere other than ~/.wine? - FAQ- WineHQ Wiki as Panther commented above.\n\n*\n\n*Just enter this command, but replace \"~/.wine-new\" with directory you want:\nexport WINEPREFIX=~/.wine-new\n\n\n\n*Then you can use standard command for your custom wine prefix, e.g.:\nwine winecfg\n\n", "Q: how to install software via terminal?

Now I'm running dual boot, (Windows 8 and Ubuntu) and I just can't find my home wireless, I can find my neighbour's wireless but I can't find mine, please someone help me!\ndown vote\nIs your wireless hidden? I don't think so, in windows 8 i can find my wireless.\nDoes it have any security? Yes. WPA\nWhat frequency does it work on? Always works.\nWhat happens when you select \"connect to hidden WiFi network\" and fill in your home WiFi details?\nIt keeps trying to connect for 10sec and then doesn't work.\n\nA: Please determine what frequency or channel your router is on:\nsudo iwlist wlan0 scan\n\nIf, for example, your router is on channel 13 and your wireless driver either doesn't know or guesses what country you are in and guesses USA where channel 13 is impermissable, you might not see your router. I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2  Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit. Change the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Proofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, if your router is set to use N speeds exclusively and your wireless device doesn't do N, I doubt you will see your router. I recommend you set your router to B, G and N speeds.\nWPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, I have better luck with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. \nIf these changes are ineffective, then we should look at the driver for your wireless device.

I saw here that there are 2 versions of Ubuntu - 14.04.1 LTS & 14.10. \nI would like to know the differences between them in terms of user interface, themeing, support, release date, etc, so that I can make an educated decision as to which is better.\n\nA: The most important aspect is what you are looking for.\nFor myself, I am looking for a stable platform that I can do my job on. Since my job is really unrelated to Linux or Linux Development, I picked LTS, which stands for Long Term Support. I want a platform that I know they will keep providing security and critical bug fixes. So I always pick the LTS versions.\nIf you pick 14.10, or future non LTS version, you will get the latest and greatest features, but you will also be required to upgrade your entire system more often.\nTake a look at the Table of Versions to understand what you are in for.\n\nA: To cover all your points of confusion:\nUser interface: Both versions use the Unity interface (it's not like Windows, where basically every release gets its new UI. In Linux systems you can install basically any UI you want to use.)\nTheming: See UI.\nSupport: Ubuntu 14.10 receives support for 9 months, i.e. to July '15. Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS* will receive updates and support for three five years since release, i.e. October '19. At some points in time, more minor version releases (14.14.2, ...) may be released. These are something like Service Packs on Windows\nRelease date: Ubuntu version numbers always contain the release date. 14.10 was released in October '14, 14.04.1 was released in April '14, but already comes with the first minor release (.1) (like a Service Pack) \n\nYou have to decide which release is best for you: While the LTS versions provides you with more stability and a longer time in which updates are deployed, the latest version will always support the newest software, which may not be available for older releases.\n*LTS = Long Term Support\n", "Q: Ubuntu unity launcher numbers to be always shown When I hold the 'super' key on my keyboard, it shows me numbers over the launcher icons so the super+number combination would jump to the application.

I use grub-efi to boot in UEFI mode, which at least originally was not compatible with the plain \"grub-pc\" without \"grub-efi\".  Thus, I am a bit wary to remove the package \"grub-efi-amd64\", because it was quite difficult to set up the UEFI boot process, which I used because I was not able to install Ubuntu in BIOS mode without putting the hardware in legacy mode.  So, my question is:  Is it safe to replace the \"grub-efi-amd64\" with \"grub-pc\" so that the UEFI boot procedure still works?  Note that I am unable to update the kernel without removing the \"grub-efi-amd64\" package, i.e. \"sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic\" also causes the removal of \"grub-efi-amd64\".\nXXX@YYY:~$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nCalculating upgrade...

[Y/n] n\nAbort.\n\n\nA: You're right to be wary. Although the replacement of grub-efi-amd64 by grub-pc will probably leave the major GRUB EFI file intact, GRUB may become confused by changes to its configuration file -- or it might not, since this is a luck-of-the-draw sort of thing. I haven't seen this specific issue for a while, but when I did it often resulted in boot problems if not caught.\nTo be most helpful, you might try upgrading individual packages (e.g., sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic and so on) to see which one(s) might have inappropriate dependencies, then file a bug report against whatever's forcing the change. If they're all doing the same thing, then it could be something unrelated to individual package packaging, like a missing /sys/firmware/efi directory tree (which could be a kernel module issue). That might merit a bug report filed against a relevant package, or maybe a configuration file change on your system.\nAnother approach (not incompatible with the first) is to install another boot manager or boot loader that can run instead of GRUB. It could be you'll switch to this other one or simply keep it as a backup. I describe several options on my EFI Boot Loaders for Linux page. If you set up such a boot loader as a backup, you should be able to let the replacement proceed and then reverse it manually when it's done, and if something goes wrong, you'll still be able to boot.\n", "Q: First Generation ipod Shuffle does not automount in Ubuntu 14.04 I have a 1GB First Generation ipod Shuffle, thought it would be fun to see if it still works.\nHave verified it is functioning on a Win/PC and a Mac and it plays music.\nWhen I plug it in to my ubuntu laptop it will not mount.\nSystem info;\nHP-Compaq 6735b laptop\nubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit (fully updated)\nMemory: 2.7 GiB\nI have installed gtkpod\nlsusb shows \n~$ lsusb\nBus 007 Device 002: ID 08ff:2810 AuthenTec, Inc.

To make it work I switch to another session (say, Ctrl+Alt+F1) and then go back to the X session (Ctrl+Alt+F7). After a few seconds where nothing responds to the mouse the session becomes active again and all fine. This workaround has allowed me to keep working but it's not ideal. A permanent solution to this would be great.\nI have an ATI Radeon HD 8600M and I'm using Xubuntu 14.04, with the ATI drivers (fglrx). If I use open-source drivers (X.org) the problem dissapears. However I'm not happy with this solution because I need propietary drivers to run some Matlab functionalities and other applications.\nAnother interesting info is that when I use two screens (laptop + external Dell monitor via HDMI) the problem only affects the laptop screen. \nSo I have the weird combination of, yes, it is the ATI driver, but only for the laptop screen....what could it be? \n\nA: I had the same problem as you mate. I also have ATI Radeon 8600M on my Dell laptop. I came up with two workarounds for this problem that I will describe, so you do not have to bang your head.\nI know what I am going to propose you is not direct solution for the problem. It is the best workaround that I have found so far from my experience. I will be very happy if someone manages to solve the problem the proper way.\nI have searched all over the internet for a proper solution, but I could not find one.\nI have discovered that the source of the problem is deep into the LightDM locker and the fglrx drivers. There is some conflict that I could not tarce down and did not find any solution. Evrytime I close the Lid of my laptop and it suspend, after I open it up I see either black screen or the system freezes completely or my screen showed only color lines.\nFirst soltuion that I have tried and it worked was to remove LightDM and replace it with xscreensaver. And it worked - no more black screens or freezes after suspend.\nTo remove light-locker and install xscreensaver, execute this in terminal:\nsudo apt-get purge light-locker light-locker-settings\nsudo apt-get install xscreensaver\n\nBut for me xscreensaver looks very ugly, so finally I have uninstalled Xubuntu and installed Ubuntu 14.10. I have no problems with unity so far.\nThe other solution is to remove fglrx, and use xorg opengl drivers. I found that if I am using this driver the problem does not occurs. But I needed fglrx to run wine games so that was not solution for me ...\nIf you can not unsintall fglrx can you open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get purge fglrx*\n\nPaste any error output in you question.\n\nA: This problem was solved when upgrading to 16.04. Screen has no single glitch. Suspend works fine. The open-source radeon driver works flawlessly! No need to miss fglrx.\n", "Q: How do I open Disk Utility in Xfce?

Or minimizes the window when you press a key.\n", "Q: Proxy settings for TeamViewer10 in UBUNTU 14.04 I have installed Teamviewer 10.0 (32/64 bit multiarch version) on Ubuntu 14.04. \nWhen I bring up the Proxy config window (Extras -> Options -> General -> Proxy Settings[Configure]) all I can do is select is No proxy or Use manual proxy. \nSo when I choose Use manual proxy, there are fields to enter the proxy IP, username and password but they appear as read-only fields. I cannot type the numbers at all. \nI have tried restarting both TeamViewer and Ubuntu, but there is no success.\n\nA: The best solution I found is to follow this steps : \n\n\n*\n\n*Stop Teamviewer by sudo teamviewer --daemon stop\n\n*Add the following line :\n[int32] Proxy_Type = 2\nin Teamviewer config file at /etc/teamviewer/global.conf\n\n*Restart Teamviewer by sudo teamviewer --daemon start\nIt will force Teamviewer proxy settings to be on manual option by default, then the input will be writable. This way you don't have the AES salt problem.\nHope it will work for you.\n\nA: This may give you a clue to get it going - it didn't work for me, but you never know.\nTeamviewer 10 has a config file at: /opt/teamviewer/config/global.conf\nBased on the conf from a previous install, the format for putting the proxy config keypairs in that config file should be:\n[bin  ] ProxyPasswordAES = b92c3b83c5e3c2b23520ff1d31e6687xxxx74bccfc96301bc1df3cd5c1babcd7eaf3a5ae3cfc990373d449184fab9b64\n[strng] ProxyUsername = \"user\" \n[strng] Proxy_IP = \"proxy1:3128\" \n[int32] Proxy_Type = 2\n\nThe ProxyPasswordAES is a 97 character salt(?), I'm not sure how to generate this so I just reused the string from my teamviewer 8 conf. As I said, it didn't work :)\nMaybe this will work for you if you're not using an authenticated proxy, or maybe someone with more knowledge than me on getting the password encryption working will respond. \nHope it helps anyway.\n", "Q: mv command - don't overwrite files I want to mv files and not overwrite duplicates.

The csv formatting type is used because it makes a simple output. s=x makes it use an x to separate the width and height values. p=0 makes it omit the stream prefix in the output.\n\nSee the ffprobe documentation and FFmpeg Wiki: ffprobe tips for more info.\n\nA: Get video resolution with ffmpeg:\nffmpeg -i filename 2>&1 | grep -oP 'Stream .*, \\K[0-9]+x[0-9]+'\n\nOutput (e.g.):\n\n640x480\n\n\nA: I made a 1 liner for loop to extract resolution from directory of files.\nfor i in $(ls \"/root/vidz/dollabillz/\"*); do eval $(ffprobe -v error -of flat=s=_ -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=width,height \"$i\"); size=${streams_stream_0_width}x${streams_stream_0_height}; echo $i $size; done;\n\n", "Q: How to boot into different partition?

Exact capabilities vary by video card specifications.\n\nAccording to the above snippet from Wikipedia, it also seems that the display needs to support the input from a DVI to HDMI adapter.\nOtherwise, it doesn't look like DVI supports audio.\n\nA: Pulse Audio automatically switches audio output to HDMI when an HDMI connection is established.\nA great tool you can use to overcome the various pitfalls of Pulse Audio is alsamixer.\nJust to make sure it's installed, go ahead and run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install alsa-utils\n\nThen, connect the HDMI connection with the connection set to DVI-HDMI.\nNext, run the following command in a terminal:\nalsamixer\n\nand then press F5 to view all channels. \nYou should see multiple channels. If you see only one channel for pulseaudio, you may need to press F6 to select a different card. However, if you do see multiple channels after pressing F5, continue.\nUse the arrow key to scroll to the right and press the up arrow key to toggle the automute option to switch it off.\n\nNow, there are two possibilities here. \nFirst:\nI think HDMI audio and analog audio are handled by two separate sound cards so you should have the option to select the analog stereo out sound card by pressing F6.\nYou should see something similar to the following example. This example shows only one analog output card. Should you have an extra digital card listed, switch to the analog card instead (HDA Intel PCH is a very common card for analog output).\n                         ┌───── Sound Card ──────┐\n                         │-  (default)           │\n                         │0  HDA Intel PCH       │\n                         │   enter device name...│\n                         └───────────────────────┘\n\nAlternatively:\nWhen using the standard 1/8th in. (3.5mm for you metric people) stereo headphone jack for audio, this channel automatically goes to 0 when you switch to another out such as, built in speakers or HDMI. If this is the case, you simply need to go to the headphone channel and raise the volume using the arrow up key. Some desktop computers have multiple channels for front back, etc. Locate the correct output channel and raise the volume.\nAnother possibility is that the channel may be muted. If a channel is muted, it will say MM at the base of the indicator for that channel.\nIn any case and whatever channel it is, headphone out or not, select the channel using the right or left arrow key.\nThen, press the M key to toggle mute off or on. Be careful here to have the volume at a safe level so that unmuting the device will not blow your speakers!!\nHere  is an example showing three muted channels:\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── AlsaMixer v1.0.28 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ Card: HDA Intel PCH

I am trying to install more stuff and I am seeing very little in snappy's install.\nIs there a way to use apt-get or add repositories to install?\n\nA: No, at the moment all you see is all you get. Snappy has just been launched, and it will take some time before applications get packaged for it.\nAs you can see, APT is not installed, and if you try to use apt or apt-get, you will get this message:\nUbuntu Core does not use apt-get, see 'snappy --help'!\n\nsnappy is the new package manager, and that is the one that you should use. In particular, snappy does not have the concept of 'repository': i.e. all packages come from the same source.\n\nA: To get apps that are not already packed as snaps (especially for arm platform) I am using classic mode installed by:\n\nsudo snap install classic --devmode --edge\n\nthen activate with \n\nsudo classic\n\nthen you can use the classic apt-get\n\nA: Maybe you can just create a snap from the ppa/apps you want.\nHere is how I create an APT snap:\nFirst you will need to install snappy-tools on your host system:\n$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:snappy-dev/tools && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install snappy-tools\n\nConvert APT packages into a snap by using deb2snap ,\nmore details please found here: https://github.com/mikix/deb2snap\n$ bzr branch lp:deb2snap\n$ cd deb2snap\n$ ./deb2snap -d 15.04 apt\n\nInstall your snap:\n$ snappy-remote --url=ssh://[user]@[target ip]:22 install apt*.snap\n\nMake whole system partition writable,\nwhich also means the system will be restored if you upgrade or rollback ubuntu-core, but apps installed by using snappy will remains here.\n$ sudo mount -o remount,rw /\n\nRun the app: apt\nBecause a Segmentation fault, I cannot just use the command apt.apt, which we just installed, but you can do this instead:\n$ sudo /apps/apt.sideload/current/bin/apt.real\n\nand so you can start doing this:\n$ sudo /apps/apt.sideload/current/bin/apt.real install software-properties-common # which gives you the ability to add ppa\n\n", "Q: I have Ubuntu and Windows 8.1 installed on separate SSDs each, any way I can access files in drive on the opposite OS?

However you can install EXT2FSD, which provides a solution for this problem. It provides read and write support too, but just be safe, I recommend to use it for reading only.\n", "Q: Update Lubuntu 14.04 I am using Lubuntu 14.04 and the program updater asked for the Lubuntu installation cd to install updates.

Or does windows have to already be installed? I am unexperienced with Ubuntu but would like to try it out, could use all the good answers from some of you ...  on how to do this if it is even possible.\n\nA: No, Ubuntu certainly doesn't need Windows to be installed. However, you will need another computer to create a USB stick or a DVD with the Ubuntu .iso on it. In fact installing Ubuntu is more straightforward if you have a whole disk to use, without the risk of overwriting a Windows partition.\nAnd Ubuntu will format the disk for you. You don't need to do that first.\n\nA: Then you have the simplest case possible, just boot up the install media (write it to a DVD, or set up it on a USB key), and select in the setup options to use the whole disk.

I'm thinking, maybe it comes to uninstall Unity desktop and reinstall?\n\nA: You definitely don't have to uninstall Unity.\nMaybe the simplest solution is install Unity Tweak Tool, and setting the font sizes to suit for you. You can also modify the dconf database with dconf-editor, but that is more tedious and also requires software installation.\nYou can install Unity Tweak Tool using the Software Center, or by the terminal command:\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\n\nA: I have exactly same problem with you and here is how I fix it:\n1. On the 'Virtual Machine Menu bar', find 'view'.\n2. Find 'Virtual screen 1 ' and set the resolution to 1366*768 or even lower.\n3. Find 'Scale Factor' in same Menu bar and set it to 200%.\n4.

I am applying to do some online consulting work with a company that states \"having a computer with Windows OS\" as a requirement. I don't have Windows but I hope to use their software under Wine. In the application form they ask the following question:\n\nWhat is the version of Microsoft Windows installed in your computer?\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Windows 8.1\n  \n*Windows 8\n  \n*Windows 7\n  \n*Windows Vista\n  \n*Other\n  \n\nWhich version should I state in order to maximize the chance that I can run their software under Wine?\n\nA: From the WineHQ - About Wine page:\n\nWine began in 1993 under the initial coordination of Bob Amstadt as a\n  way to support running Windows 3.1 programs on Linux. Very early on,\n  leadership over Wine's development passed to Alexandre Julliard, who\n  has managed the project ever since. Over the years, as the Windows API\n  and applications have evolved to take advantage of new hardware and\n  software, Wine has adapted to support new features, all while being\n  ported to other OSes, becoming more stable, and providing a better\n  user-experience.\n\nFrom that it sounds like there really is no specific version of Windows that WINE is based off of.\nHowever, if you run wine regedit and then navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > Software > Microsoft > Windows NT:\n\nand select the CurrentVersion key:\n\nyou'll see a registry string titled ProductName. \nIn my case, running Wine 1.6.2, the value for ProductName is Windows XP. Then, looking at the CSDVersion string's value, you'll notice that it says Service Pack 3.\nThus, your safest bet would most likely be that Wine is most similar to Windows XP (Service Pack 3). \nEDIT\nI've discovered something else in WINE. If you install winetricks and then open it up, then click on Select the default wineprefix:\n\nThen click Run winecfg:\n\nYou can change the version of Windows that WINE, I guess, emulates? You can change the displayed Windows version at the very least:\n\n", "Q: Booting Linux from USB I'm trying to boot Linux from USB to run an application. When I boot Live Linux, the data is gone and it is new again when I reboot the OS. I want to retain the data and run the application and also use it as normal USB.\n\nA: Even if you do decide to follow these instructions, I suggest you read the LiveUsbPendrivePersistent wiki page. Reading Wiki pages is a great way to learn and you'll know more about what you're doing - rather than just following steps blindly.\nNormally, I'd suggest that you use the Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu to do this - it has a really simple option:\n\n\nthat allows you to add MB of space to keep stored in reserved extra space. However, there is a bug with installing the bootloader:\n\nat least for me.\nSo, I'd suggest you use Unetbootin. It's not quite as polished, but it does the exact same job and has the exact same store in reserve functionality. It's what I use when creating LiveUSBs and has yet to fail me.\nIt's in the default repositories, so you can install it via sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install unetbootin.\nOnce it's installed, open up the dash (Super key - aka Windows key) and open up unetbootin - you'll have to search for it. It'll require the sudo password, just a heads up. You'd need sudo access just to install the app, so that's no problem.\n\nOnce unetbootin starts, you'll want to change the radio button from selecting Distribution (default choice) to selecting Diskimage and then click the ... button. You can then select the ISO and it will show up in the text box.\nOnce you've selected the ISO you want, make sure the type is set to USB drive and that it's targeting the correct USB drive. If you've got USB backup media or other USB sticks attached to your computer, you may want to consider disconnecting them for a bit - just to be safe and sure you don't accidentally overwrite some important data.\nNow, to add the persistence of data, simply change the Space used to preserve files across reboots (Ubuntu only) value. This should create a file-system on the USB stick, along with the ISO contents, that will store your information across reboots!\n\nNote, that if you use Unetbootin to create the LiveUSB, you'll have to specify the space in MB (MegaBytes) not GB (Gigabytes). A simple way to convert this is just punch into a calculator numberOfGigabytes * 1024. That will provide you with the correct amount of space in MB terms (as there are 1024 MB in a GB.)\n", "Q: I have just installed and updated Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and I can't get my Broadcom 4311 wifi to turn on I read other questions indicating the same issue and followed the instructions given.

I have bought an Alcatel x602D modem for 3G Internet connections but Ubuntu doesn't recognize it as a modem but like USB storage \nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: What you have is called a \"multi-mode USB device\": It's a modem and also a USB stick: and it usually has Windows and Mac drivers on-board! When plugged in on Windows or the Mac, it acts like a flash storage and starts installing the drivers from there. After installation (and on every consecutive plugging) the driver switches the mode internally...\nHowever, when you're Using Linux, this is just a minor nuisance as you can install  USB_ModeSwitch which will allow you to use some Alcatel products as a modem.  So just remove the modem from your PC and type:\napt-get install usb-modeswitch\n\nIn 90% of cases you then just have to insert the modem and it'll work like a modem!\nIf you're in the 10% where the Ubuntu repository doesn't work, download the latest usb-modeswitch-data package (dated 2015-01-15 at the time of this writing) and extract it (as root) over the existing data package. (use locate usb_modeswitch.d to find the correct directory)\nIf that doesn't help you either, download the latest binary package from Debian and install it over the existing package.  (it will now be quite impossible to automatically uninstall and you will have to use the same manual method to upgrade USB_ModeSwitch from this point forward until you reinstall your OS)\nTo convert Debian code names to Ubuntu code names, use the following table:\n15.04        jessie / sid\n14.10        jessie / sid\n14.04        jessie / sid\n13.10        Wheezy / sid\n13.04        Wheezy / sid\n12.10        Wheezy / sid\n12.04        Wheezy / sid\n\nIf all that still doesn't work, follow the trouble-shooting guide and if that doesn't work, contribute...\n", "Q: How to change DPI in Ubuntu GNOME 14.04?

This doesn't affect anything since the things in your source folder aren't used by your system. It would only work if you compiled it and overwrote the relevant files in your system, but don't do that since it would probably break many things and is bad practice - it's a bad way of configuring things. If you really wanted to configure stuff in Linux, it's best you use configuration files. \nAn example of config file (but this is most likely not what you want to fix your DPI problem): https://help.gnome.org/admin/gdm/stable/configuration.html.en#daemonconfig\n", "Q: How Recover data from a server that crashes on startup?

And then running testdisk. \nFrom testdisk, you can repair your partition table, recover files, and even recover some deleted files which haven't been overwritten a lot. \nSome links: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step\n\n*http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Data_Recovery_Examples\nEDIT: Actually your lsblk suggests your partition is detected properly at /dev/sda1 for the server's root directory I'm guessing. Is the data you want to recover in /dev/sda or /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc? Either way, testdisk should still work for repairing partition tables and recovering data.\n\nA: It looks to me like almost all the big drives are already mounted, from the lsblk listing. The linked answer says to look under \"drives\" in Nautilus, but if it's not working then just browsing to the mount points (folders) should work.\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 is on /media/f9b18a81-df67-4629-8ba4-e57698667825\n\n*sdb2 is on /media/Data disk\n\n*sdc2 is on /media/Data disk_\nOnly /dev/sda5 might still need a sudo mkdir /media/sda5mount && sudo mount /dev/sda5 /media/sda5mount\nThen just browse to the /media/..... folders and take a look around.\nIf you can see the files there, and especially if everything still looks good in recovery mode, then I don't think the filesystems or partition tables need fixing.\nSo booting from a live DVD/USB, or even booting to recovery mode, you should be able to copy the files to a USB device or DVD (command line tools for that might be a little daunting in recovery mode), or copy to another network device, etc.\n", "Q: How to change one key in the keyboard?

To enable it again, reboot, go into the BIOS again and enable the NVidia card.\n\n*If you want to enable the NVidia card only for certain applications, head to the Bumblebee project and read the documentation to enable the NVidia driver for certain applications only...\nI wouldn't \"fix\" anything: you have full performance available at all time and unless you travel a lot using your battery, I would use \"System 1\" (which is what I'm using now to write this message)\n", "Q: Internet disappears after few minutes I have a strange issue.

I have OpenJDK 7, and I can execute .jar files fine in both desktops.\nAfter installing Oracle Java 8 (oracle-java8-installer and oracle-java8-set-default packages from the Webupd8 PPA), Lubuntu/LXDE sees .jar files as zip archives and I can no longer execute .jar files in Lubuntu/LXDE in a GUI with either Oracle or OpenJDK Java (pcmanfm/desktop). \nUbuntu (Unity) picks up the change and executes .jar files with Oracle Java.\nIs there any way I can execute .jar files on Lubuntu/LXDE with Oracle Java without having to use the terminal (eg java -jar FTB_Launcher.jar)?\n\nA: If you are willing to try a little shell scripting the first time, you can make this command a shortcut on your homepage.\nThis will be along the lines of this tutorial: How can I create a quick launcher in Lubuntu?\nWrite a Simple Bash Script\nFor this instance, the first think you'll want to do is write your script. In any text editor (Leafpad or nano are easy), type this file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\njava -jar /home/dave/Downloads/Minecraft.jar\n\n(but then replace \"/home/dave/Downloads/Minecraft.jar\" with the absolute path to the .jar file you want to run.)\nOnce you've written that script, I would recommend you save that it in a folder in your home directory called \"bin\". In my example case, I have saved it as /home/dave/bin/Minecraft.sh\nChange Permissions of Your Script\nNext, you'll need to allow execution of that script. If you don't mind if other users can execute it, you can use:\nchmod 755 ~/bin/Minecraft.sh\n\n...Which gives you the right to read, write, and execute that file, and gives others the right to read & execute the file.\nFinally, time to make the desktop shortcut.\nAgain in the terminal, type:\nlxshortcut -o ~/Desktop/Minecraft\n\nReplace Minecraft with the name you'd like it to have. This will create a desktop icon with that name and allow you to set it up.\nUnder Desktop Entry, next to \"Command:\" you will be able to browse to your script file (the .sh you made earlier) and give it a description or a new icon, if you want.\n\nNow, with a double-click of that shortcut, you should have Java opening that .jar\nNote: Edited from original answer that relied on Nautilus.\n", "Q: Why doesn't my rc.local run on startup?

First method requires one to have the superuser password. One must use sudo to perform a command like this apt-get install app_name. The second method is to download a tarball from the website, extract it, place the extracted files into the specified directory (or build it first), set up shortcuts. As you can see, the second method needs a user to have certain skills, but the first one needs only a knowledge of the superuser password.\nThe question is — how to combine these advantages: not to know the password (install software to home directory), not to be skilled (install in one click) and to use software only from repos.\nWhy it looks not so complicated for me: as an example let's look at SweetHome3D. This app is available both in repos and on the developer's website. When I download the tarball I just extract it, rename the folder to make it invisible and set up the shortcut (make it and then place it into ~/.local/share/applications). Or I can just do $ sudo apt-get install sweethome3d\nNow let's try something different (not necessary like this):\n Perform $ apt-get download sweethome3d. This command downloads .dep file. \nExtract the contents. There are no difficulties of doing this.\n… (here are some automatic actions to make the app prepared to launch)\nPROFIT!\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The deb file that is downloaded and installed when you run apt-get install  is basically a build of the source code with most options  already set. This includes the location where it would be installed, probably /usr/some_folder.\nThis means you cannot change this location by using a deb file. The only way to do this is to get the source code, modify it and then install it.\n\nA: After installing Flatpak you can just:\nflatpak --user install flathub com.sweethome3d.Sweethome3d\n\n", "Q: the flash mem and camera don't work on windows xp installed by virtual box I installed win xp by the virtual box and the camera does not work either the cd rom or flash mem.\nhow can i make them respond on the virtual windows?\nThanks\n\nA: Your VM must be configured this way that it can access your physical computer's devices.

I would like to create a launcher launching:\nchromium-browser chrome://inspect\n\nHowever, this simply opens the chromium as if not url has been specified at all.\nIs it even to start Chromium opening a chrome:// url?\n\nA: While \"normal\" url's do work as expected, it seems impossible at first to use the chrome:// urls from a command, and there is nothing in the man chromium-browser man page on this.\nHowever, it is very well possible to work around this, with the help of xdotool.\nHow it works\n\n\n*\n\n*install xdotool\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Use the following command in your .desktop file:\n/bin/bash -c \"chromium-browser&sleep 2&&xdotool type 'chrome://inspect'&&xdotool key Return\"\n\nWhat it will do is open chromium browser, xdotool will type the chrome://inspect url and (simulate) press return.\nEffectively this will do exactly what you want.\nNo need to say that you can replace chrome://inspect with any other of the chrome:// commands.\nNote\nIn the command, there is a small break included of 2 seconds, to make sure the browser is loaded before xdotool starts to type. On my system (not the most recent) it can be changed to sleep 1 and still work perfectly. You can experiment a bit with it.\n\nedit\nAlternative\nDirty or not, a solution should always work.

Especially when the computer is heavily occupied, there is a chance xdotool starts typing \"blindly\". \nThe solution below is \"time-proof\" and should work under all circumstances; it makes sure xdotool only starts typing when a new chromium-browser window appears within appr. 15 seconds.\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file\n\n*Save it as run_chrcommand.py\n\n*use as command in your .desktop file:\npython3 /path/to/run_chrcommand.py\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport getpass\nimport time\n\nuser = getpass.getuser()\nget = lambda x: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", x]).decode(\"utf-8\")\nws1 = get(\"wmctrl -lp\"); t = 0\nsubprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"chromium-browser&\"])\nwhile t < 30:      \n    ws2 = [w.split()[2] for w in get(\"wmctrl -lp\").splitlines() if not w in ws1]\n    procs = [[p for p in get(\"ps -u \"+user).splitlines() \\\n              if \"chromium-bro\" in p and w in p] for w in ws2]\n    if len(procs) > 0:\n        command = \"xdotool type 'chrome://inspect'&&xdotool key Return\"\n        subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n        break\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    t = t+1\n\n", "Q: mono package for wine I have an installation of wine on my Ubuntu 14.04 (minimal) system (with xfce):\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends wine\n\nI wanted to run .NET applications with it.

It then prompts me to install mono for wine. If I proceed, it downloads and installs it and everything works fine, i.e., I can execute .NET applications with wine.\nNow, since I want to create an automated install script for various applications (including wine and mono for wine), I was looking for a package that does what I described above, but without the GUI and, more importantly, without user interaction.

I am using GPART to re-size partition as this question.\nThere is no data in my disk of 320 GB, but still it shows me that it occupies all the memory. Please refer below screenshot.   \n\nHow to re-size partition in this situation ?\n\nA: By far the best way to dual boot (or triple or quadruple boot) a computer is to follow this sequence:\n(1) download and burn to CD a standalone version of gparted.\n(2) Use that to partition your disk as desired, say 75 GB for Windows, 75 GB for Linux, 75 GB for another version of Linux, and 75 GB for pure data to be read/written by both Win 7 and Linux. Make the shared data partition NTFS, since now Linux can read and write NTFS partitions, unlike the bad old days when a Windows/Linux shared data partition had to be FAT32. A small boot partition is optional. If you intend to have more than 4 partitions, the 4th must be extended, and then cut the extended partition up into a few virtual partitions as you wish.\n(3) Install windows first, then Ubuntu or another Linux. The reason is, the last OS installed will control the multi-booting, and you definitely, desperately need that to be GRUB (which is automatically installed when you install Ubuntu). Windows will automatically choose an NTFS partition in which to install, so I advise you make two NTFS partitions when you are partitioning, one for Win 7, one for data to be shared between Win 7 and Linux.\nThe only cost to you of doing it this way is you will have to reinstall Linux, but since that takes less than an hour, no problem. To ignore my advice and resize your current single large virtual partition (sda5), use the standalone gparted CD to delete partition sda5, then create the desired number of new virtual partitions, one for each OS plus a data partition.\nThe advantages of an NTFS data partition are (1) so Win 7 and Linux can both access it, and (2) so your various developmental projects (such as a huge photo collection, or a big software development project) don't get obliterated when you re-install an OS. Big projects should NOT be on a Windows C: drive, nor on a Linux / partition.\n", "Q: How do I completly delete Ubuntu 12.04 (only OS installed)? I thought based on the tech spec that my PC would handle Ubuntu, but it's slow. I want to get rid of it, and perhaps install Xubuntu.\nHow can I completely delete this OS (the only one installed)? I have no windows to use to \"overwrite\" it.\n\nA: Use another computer or Ubuntu 12.04 to download and burn the Xubuntu ISO to your USB/CD and boot from it. Select the option to completely erase the old OS when installing Xubuntu.\n\nA: Boot other distro/OS that you want to install on your desktop and when you're prompted to set up your partitions, delete all existing. \n\nNow when you've deleted all partitions, create a new one for your new distro/OS and install it.\n\nA: You don't need windows to overwrite it; use the USB key you already have, or the one you're going to use to re-install from; the obvious thing to do is to download Xubuntu, create the new USB drive, and do as others have suggested; if you really want to clear the drive first, you could just open a terminal, sudo -i to become root, & use fdisk to remove all partitions from your hard disk - but it isn't necessary to do so.\nWhy is it so slow? Is there a driver problem? Often it's silly things like a sound driver, or insufficient memory, if you use tools like top & free to see what's happening you may save bother with the new OS as well. I would suggest you try to work it out if you can as hardware drivers may well remain the same after an upgrade.\n\nA: You know you can just add the Xubuntu packages to any existing Ubuntu? It's a meta-package available in apt or the Software Center or Synaptic... \nI think apt-get install xubuntu-desktop will do it. \nAnd for just the XFCE window manager, it's apt-get install xfwm4\n", "Q: How to fix overheating problem after latest updates?

You need to use rEFInd (rodsbooks.com/refind), especially if you are trying to make a dual boot on Yosemite or Maverick or any number of cat names back to v10.4\nThe second issue, I had with 10.7 was the instructions to convert the ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso into a dmg on a USB stick for rEFInd to load. \nI first did this using the ubuntu instructions for building dmg on USB.\nThe only caveat to the above being that you should use 'unmountDisk' and target /dev/disk'N's1 where 'N' is the number of the device. At last success but no dice with rEFInd. When I booted into any of the bootloaders (oh yea, 3 of which were visible). One of which gave me the error: \"No boot device\" and two of which took me to the backup grub bootloader. If I chose 'Install ubuntu' I would hear the drums for ubuntu start (as if the OS had loaded), but I would not see anything load at all.\nI then tried the same process with the ubuntu-desktop-i386.iso (the 32bit version). Note: I was at first confused because I know my mac has an Intel i7, that was 64bit... but it turns out that there's a long history as to why ubuntu chose 'amd64' as the name for the 64bit version... in any case, no dice with the i386 dmg either and rEFInd.\nThen I tried using the really handy tool UNetbootin (unetbootin.sourceforge.net) - thinking maybe I was doing something wrong in building the dmg? But apparently not.\nAt this point I was getting discouraged. But I thought, well, let's try the old fashioned way. So, I dusted off a 4.7G dvd and burned the ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso to disk and then I restarted. Again no dice with rEFInd... but alas! there is a solution.\nIf you leave the dvd in the drive and boot while holding the 'alt/option' key. You will get another boot menu (one that's stock to mac). You should see your HD, your Recovery HD, and probably two CDs (one that says 'WINDOWS' and one that says 'EFI boot'). In my case if I choose the EFI boot, it will behave the same way as it did in the rEFInd description above. \nHowever, if you choose the 'WINDOWS' cd (contrary to popular belief) it will probably load ubuntu desktop right off the disk and you will be able to choose 'Install Alongside Mac OS X' in about the third or forth option into the install. \nBe sure that you followed the instructions for making space with Disk Utility before you attempt to install from the CD. Just leave the space unallocated, and don't make a partition for ubuntu - let 'alongside' option do the work. A fairly good overview of this partition process is here.\n", "Q: Extract data from pdf form (or other Base format) to import to Libre Base database?

Generally, pdftk is able to extract the form data out of a PDF form to a fdf file. But AFAIK there's no tool to import that data into LO Base.

However, if I try Alt+d to go rightward of prompt, terminal recognizes \".\" in IP for a separator and deletes only one chunk, until the . out of the whole IP.\nHow can I adjust that so terminal recognizes only blank spaces for separator of word or even better to have another shortcut for different separators: ., =, ,, etc?\nIt is very similar with maneuvering  in terminal with Ctrl+Arrows (left and right) and behavior is similar based on what is set for word separator.\nI read that Emacs editor sits behind what terminal uses to have those shortcuts but I could not get to twink it.\n\nA: First use the following command in your terminal:\nbind '\"\\ew\": vi-forward-bigword'\n\nto create a new shortcut-key - Alt+w in this case - which will move the prompt forward to the end of the current or next word. In this case words (bigwords) are composed of letters, digits and special characters like \".\".\nNow you can use Alt+w followed by Ctrl+w to accomplish what you wish.\nSee some more info in my answer here.\n\nMoreover, after I viewed this Q&A, I understood the following:\n\nWith bind, you can bind keys to do one of three things, but no\n  combination of them:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Execute a readline command:      bind '\"key\": command'\n  \n*Execute a series of keystrokes: bind '\"key\":\"keystrokes\"'\n  \n*Execute a shell command: bind -x '\"key\": shell-command'\n\nSo, now, if you want to combine those two keystrokes (Alt+w followed by Ctrl+w) in a new one, you will need to bind a new keystroke (in my example Alt+q) to execute the previous keystrokes as follow:\nbind '\"\\eq\": \"\\ew \\C-w\"'\n\nFinally, to make these changes permanently, all you have to do is to add the following lines to your ~/.inputrc file (if you don't have it, then create it):\n\"\\ew\": vi-forward-bigword\n\"\\eq\": \"\\ew \\C-w\"\n\n", "Q: How to use the Linux driver for a Huion drawing tablet So I recently got a Huion 580 drawing tablet.

Now that the Windows 10 has rolled out, I would like to know whether doing the same steps as for Windows 8 would install it. I would wait until somebody else has tried it out and posted it on the internet, but I'm somewhat out of time to wait. Will it be risky trying it out so soon, or does anyone know about what would work?\n\nA: I've been dual-booting Windows 10 preview for 3 months now: no problems whatsoever in BIOS mode...  (No UEFI here!)\nHowever, I have 2 hard drives in my machine and change the boot order to boot from one hard drive or the other one.  I did run for a week or so from one hard drive, but something got screwed up, so I reverted to booting from 2 hard drives again...\nAnd as to waiting: you can always wait for the new CPU, the new Windows, the new GPU, ...  If you're out of time to wait, get a system with Windows 8 and dual boot that as Microsoft has announced that anyone with a Windows 8 system can upgrade for free within one year...\n\nA: I'm dual booting them right now- I just answered my own question detailing the process. This was specific to my firmware, but the general principles will appy. The most important thing is to make sure you do everything in UEFI if you have UEFI firmware, or everything for BIOS if you have BIOS firmware. Mixing methods is where things usually start to fail.

I'm running Ubuntu 14.04. Whenever I'm using the default Unity desktop environment (or using the Gnome Classic session with Metacity), a flash drive with a LUKS-encrypted filesystem is automatically mounted whenever it's plugged in.

To get encrypted automounting to work, add the line \"DesktopName=Unity\" to /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/xmonad.session. The final session file looks like this:\n[GNOME Session]\nName=Xmonad/GNOME\nRequiredComponents=gnome-settings-daemon;gnome-panel;xmonad\nDesktopName=Unity\n\nFor people troubleshooting related problems, it was informative to start a GNOME+Metacity session, then run xmonad --replace in a terminal window. In my case, using the xmonad --replace technique confirmed that the automounting behavior was not an issue caused by xmonad itself, but rather a lack of the appropriate running services.\n", "Q: Alternative to running rmmod and modprobe at every boot My touchpad isn't properly recognized unless I manually run\nrmmod psmouse\nmodprobe psmouse\n\nat every boot.

Using xbacklight, however, works well:\nxbacklight -set 50\n\nAnother way to achieve the same result is to use xrandr:\nxrandr --output DP-2 --set Backlight 50\n\nYou can then remap the function keys to two scripts containing xbacklight -inc 10 and xbacklight -dec 10. On Mint, you do this by creating a custom keyboard shortcut.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 14.04 to USB I wish to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS onto my 500GB USB drive. Just to be clear, that's TO, not FROM. I want to have the full OS on my USB, rather than making it a bootable USB. I believe this is possible, and have seen a few threads on it, but the threads are a little bit old. I have tried the partitioning methods, but the installation freezes while making the ext4 file system. Does anyone know the right way to do it?\nAlso, one thread suggested installing Lubuntu. Is this a better idea?\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu to (and running from) a USB drive is a very simple process. You can even have your documents stored on the USB drive permanently, using persistent storage (Stored in reserved extra space). \nUpdate: Because the default partition type is FAT32, you can't use more than 4GB. To get around this it has been suggested to use gparted - please check this q&a.\nI use such a setup all the time to run my own system on others' computers, without having to access their OS and having access to my files anywhere. \nYou will have to boot from the USB to run Ubuntu from it. \nRun the Startup Disk Creator and use 450GB for persistent storage. \n\n\nA: With a 500 GB portable drive you probably want to do a Full install rather than a Persistent install.\nIn that case unplug your internal drive, boot the Live CD or Live USB, plug in your portable drive and do a normal Ubuntu install.\nThere are many other methods including cloning an existing system.\nYou can get more than 4GB of persistence with a persistent install by making an ext4 second partition and labeling it casper-rw. then follow Sri's instructions above and delete the casper-rw file after.\n", "Q: Screen turns off without reason The precise problem\nThe screen turns off the display suddenly, and does not respond to the mouse or keyboard.  \nWhat actually happens??\nWhen I am working on my PC (OS - Ubuntu 14.10) suddenly without any reason my computer slows down. Within few seconds the monitor gives the warning and then turns off - it works in the same way when the operating system is locked with the shortcut keyboard combination \"Ctr+Alt+L\". But then in this case which I am mentioning the command to lock the screen is not given. And normally when the screen is locked, then after pressing any key on the keyboard or even after simply moving the mouse, the screen turns on and the system asks for the password of the account which is locked. In the problem I am mentioning even that does not work. My PC does not respond to either the mouse or keyboard.

I am actively using the computer when the screen suddenly turns off. \nImportant addition: After I posting this question, I have encountered a similar problem. I encountered it especially while watching videos on YouTube. I found a similar question asked here. The only difference is, I have experienced this problem continuously for the last hour while watching videos on other portals too. \nAddition: Found the somewhat similar question here Yet my question is little different from all the 3 related questions I have posted here.

In a very similar question, the accepted answer suggests to do:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/output bs=8k count=10k;\n\nto measure the write speed of a hard disk.\nMy tests were inconclusive. I have an LVM-based software RAID 1 setup with two ordinary hard disks. When running the aforementioned command, it gives the following result:\n\n10240+0 records in\n  10240+0 records out\n  83886080 bytes (84 MB) copied, 0.0784284 s, 1.1 GB/s\n\nNot that I'm unhappy to have a RAID array which can store 1 GB per second, but I would still like to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why am I getting wrong results? Is it something to do with cache? RAID? LVM?\n\n*How to get the actual file-level write performance?\n\nA: *\n\n*For no apparent reason your test file size is really small, only 80MB.  A small file like that will make the result less accurate, but also will mean than the entire operation may be satisfied by cache and not test true filesystem performance.\nTo fix I'd make the file size much larger, say a couple of GB.\nYou probably need to do a sync afterwards, and measure the whole result.  As in time 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/output bs=1M count=2k && sync' or something.\n\n*Make sure /tmp is not actually a tmpfs in which case it's stored in memory, not on disc.  Make sure the destination partition is a disk partition.\n\n*Copying from /dev/zero can in some cases result in artificially high performance when the disk media performs its own data compression, because a string of zeroes compresses down to virtually nothing.  This will be a particular issue on SSDs.  Make sure your test data is random enough not to compress, such as JPEG files or MP4 videos (and not the same file over and over again, because that will still compress well).  Random data will work best if it's pre-generated, don't generate it on the fly because that will artifically slow down the transfer.\n", "Q: Wifi icon is not displayed My networking status is on which is shown in first figure\n\nBut the Networking icon i.e. the wifi icon is missing.

Oracle Java is not in Ubuntu repo anymore. Is there a feature in .deb packaging to require a package in custom repo? (I doubt.) Otherwise you may require oracle-java8-installer and oracle-java8-set-default (http://www.webupd8.org/2012/09/install-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-via-ppa.html) and write in the package info something like \"please add such custom PPA for this excellent package, dont worry they are honest people, trust me\".

Gparted also shows the space unallocated.\nSo, have I completely lost my Ubuntu installation and files? Is there a way to recover my Ubuntu installation and files?\n\nA: I solved the problem using GNU Parted.\nOther methods of recovering are mentioned in the Ubuntu Documentation.\nAdvantage of choosing GNU Parted:\nNo need to download it, it is included in Ubuntu base.\n\nHow to use GNU Parted\nRun Parted from the command line to recover your partition.\nWhen changing the partition table on your hard drive, you must ensure\n  that no partition on the disk is mounted. This includes swap space.\n  The easiest way to accomplish this is to run the live cd. Parted is\n  installed on the base Ubuntu system. Once at the desktop, open a\n  terminal and run_:\nsudo swapoff -a or you can use Gparted partition editor to achieve the same. Next run parted and tell it to use the device in question.\n\nFor example, if your /dev/sda drive is the drive from which you want\n  to recover, run:\nsudo parted /dev/sda\n\n\nEnter the following command to ensure the unit used is 's':\nunit s\n\nNow you can use the print and rescue command to recover your partition as explained in the user manual as follows:\nEnter the following command to get details of all partitions and their start and end locations:\nprint\n\nNow we can enter the final rescue command:\nrescue START END\n\nUse the values for start and end from the output of the print command.\nIf you have more than one partition to recover, repeat you rescue command.\nYou won't need to restore GRUB.\n\nA: I would go about it in these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu Live CD\n\n*sudo apt-get install testdisk\n\n*Run testdisk, and try to recover the partition from there.\n\n\nProbably Windows just removed the partition definition from the partition table, which will take just a few seconds for testdisk to fix. Then grub should also work automagically. If the problem's worse, testdisk may only be able to recover some of your files; in that case I'd deem it unfeasible to fix the installation itself; I'd just back up the files worth backing up and reinstall Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Problem in installation of Ubuntu in Virtualbox I was trying to install Ubuntu 32 bits in Virtualbox but the following error occurred\n\nthis kernel requires an x86-64 cpu but only detected an i686 cpu unable to boot please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU \n\nThen I activated EFI in the settings.

Let me explain :\nI bought my server with the following specs :\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU : Intel Pentium G3440\n\n*MB  : Asus H87M-E C2\n\n*RAM : Corsair 2 x 2GB DDR3\n\n\nAnd with the following drives (one partition on each drive) :\n\n\n*\n\n*SSD (sda) : Kingston HyperX 120GB SATA3\n\n*HDD (sdb) : WD Green 4TB SATA3\n\n*HDD (sdc) : Seagate ST4000 4TB SATA3\n\n*HDD (sdd) : WD Green 3TB SATA3\n\n\nI installed Ubuntu 14.04 (with GNOME) on the SSD, and \"salvaged\" the Seagate 4TB drive from my Windows 7 x64 computer and it was full of data. It was partitionned in NTFS, and had Compression active (gained a couple of GB with this).\nWhen I moved it to my server, I emptied it into the other drives (took me around 3 weeks, at an average speed of 2MB/s). I thought the low read speed was due to the fact that I was transferring from (compressed) NTFS to Ext4. Now that I have emptied the drive, and reformated it to Ext4 I assumed it would be much better, but when I tried to copy back some of the files, I saw that the average speed was still similar (around 2MB/s). So tried some other copies to test the speeds between the other drives, and all copies I try doing between the 3 large capacity drives (sdb, sdc, sdd) go slower than 2.7MB/s (sometimes as slow as 1MB/s).\nIs there something I'm missing here ?

I wonder why there is no Mercurial plugin to work with Launchpad/Bazaar from Mercurial? Is there any technical limitation that make it impossible to use local Mercurial storage/clone for working with remote Bazaar repositories?\n\nA: The reverse (bzr-hg) did exist, but that plugin has been abandoned in 2012. See https://launchpad.net/bzr-hg. I suspect a hg-bzr plugin didn't emerge for similar reasons as why we gave up on the bzr-hg plugin, in addition to the fact that the popularity of bzr has simply waned - so a plugin is less necessary.\nOne of the problems with the bzr-hg plugin was that both Bazaar and Mercurial have lower-level APIs that are (were) changing often enough that the plugin would regularly break. \nBazaar and Mercurial also have quite a different data model - the difference is bigger than between e.g. Bazaar and Git - which made it hard to convert revisions in a performant manner.\nMercurial and Bazaar have a number of features that are hard to map between them. \n\n\n*\n\n*The information in Mercurial manifests and Bazaar inventories can't be converted back and forth easily - you need lookup tables for file identification information\n\n*Bazaar revision properties are similar to Mercurial extras, but they don't support special characters (or the other way around)\n\n*Mercurial doesn't support \"ghost revisions\", revisions that are referenced but not present in the repository\n\n*Mercurial doesn't have a concept of file ids, so file ids need to be stored elsewhere in the repository like a special file\n\n*Mercurial doesn't support empty directories, multiple commit authors or revisions with more than two parents (\"octopus merges\", in Git terminology)\n\n\nThese things are a lot easier when interacting with Git, because it is content-addressable and simpler (e.g. it doesn't have per-file revision graphs). Hg-Git or Bzr-Git can just import whatever you have in Git into Mercurial and so long as you end up converting it back into Git with the same representation, you get the same commit SHA as you had originally.\n", "Q: The difference between lshw and lspci commands I think it's a little confused issue but what's the difference the lshw and lspci commands ?\n\nA: lshw lists all computer hardware and lspci list devices connected to the computer.\nFrom Ubuntu manpage:\nlspci  is  a  utility for displaying information about PCI buses in the\n       system and devices connected to them.\nlshw  is  a  small tool to extract detailed information on the hardware\n       configuration of the machine. It can report exact memory configuration,\n       firmware version, mainboard configuration, CPU version and speed, cache\n       configuration, bus speed, etc. on DMI-capable x86 or IA-64 systems  and\n       on some PowerPC machines (PowerMac G4 is known to work).\n\nA: To put it very simply:\n$ lspci | wc\n     17     206    1509\n$ sudo lshw | wc\n     439    1464   19370   \n\nThe lspci command only lists devices that are connected via the PCI bus. The lshw and lshw-gtk (the same thing but with a GUI) on the other hand, provide exhaustive information about all hardware in your system. This will include the motherboard, CPU, hard disks etc. It also provides way more detailed information about these including serial numbers and models. \n", "Q: installing ubuntu 14.04 in dell inspiron 15 Whether it  is possible to choose local disc other  than \"c\" to install ubuntu in dell inspiron.\n\nA: Basically, when installing any Linux (such as Ubuntu) you should refer to their \"Linux\" device name. \"C\" is a Microsoft/Windows term for the primary drive (or actually partition). In Linux most modern hard-drives would be named sda (for primary HDD), sdb, sdc, etc. and partition within a specific drive would be sda1, sda2, etc. (for partitions of primary HDD).\nSo \"C\" refers to specific partition in your primary drive. Specifically, since you refer to a latop (Dell Inspiron 15) which has an internal space for just one HDD, I assume that you actually mean: \"Can I avoid overriding existing data (or OS) that I already have on the partition where my Windows runs?\"\nYou need to tackle two obstacles to make this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Your current \"C\" drive is probably occupying almost all the free space left on the internal drive. You would need to use a tool like \"Gparted\" - booting it from a live CD and resizing (Shrinking) the partition that currently holds \"C\" and making space to create new partition for Ubuntu's  (root) partition. \n\n*Follow the instructions pointed by previous answers in order to install Ubuntu on the new partition you created, and not on the existing partition that holds \"C\".\n\n", "Q: Suspicious SSL certificate I have a Lenovo E330 laptop running Ubuntu 14.04. Sometimes the certificate in this picture:\n\nPrompts me when I start up the computer, and I find it looks quite suspicious.\nCan anybody tell me why it's prompting me for accepting this SSL certificate and if there is a way to stop it. Please let me know if you need more information.\n\nA: Yes, this certificate looks suspicious. It might be that somebody is messing with your network and trying man-in-the-middle attacks. Please check if other hosts in the network are affected too. \nIf no other host is affected try to find out when exactly you get this message, that is which host gets accessed in this case. It might also be that there is a router or similar device in your network with an expired certificate and for whatever reason you are trying to access this host.\n\nA: Check your router's configuration.\nI recently changed ISP and the router from the new ISP has \"Daniel's\" SSL certificate for the router's HTTPS management web page. This router is a Zyxel VMG1312; I don't know which other makes/models of routers have been blessed with \"Daniel's\" self-signed certificates.\nI also can't explain why Daniel thinks California is in Ukraine (UA) instead of America (US). Possibly a typo, since \"a\" is next to \"s\" on many keyboards.\nElsewhere in the router's admin pages is an option to install my own SSL certificates; I may investigate that later on.\n\nA: This is the SSL certificate installed by default on ZyXEL VMG1312 routers, I know because mine has the same certificate. It looks like your computer is attempting to communicate with your router using an encrypted protocol (like SSH or HTTPS) and is warning you that the certificate is invalid.\nThe certificate expired in 2006 so there's no way to trust it. This leaves you with 2 options:\n1, stop communicating with your router via secure protocols. The downside here is that you're removing a level of security, however on your LAN it isn't as important as if you were accessing your router over the internet. \n2, replace the certificate on the router with an in-date cert signed by a Certificate Authority that your computer trusts (by this I mean if you're going down the self-signed route you need to add the router as a trusted CA). This is the preferred route but requires an understand of SSL security certificates and their management, and also that you know how to replace the cert on your router. I've just started looking at this now so when I find the location of the cert I'll reply with steps.\n\nA: The other answers are correct in that the HTTPS certificate in a Zyxel VMG1312 router is the root cause.\nWhy? Any connections made outbound from the connected client while the router is rebooting or the WAN link is down get hijacked by the router and handled by itself instead of the web, including HTTP, HTTP, and SSH traffic.\nThis means webapps like Facebook that make repeated connections will trigger the prompt, and SSH connections trigger the \"remote key changed\" warning.\n", "Q: Boot from NFS drive with persistence I have installed PXELinux on my Synology NAS and unpacked the ubuntu ISO in the NAS.\nI can now boot from my PC thru PXE into ubuntu.\nThis is how my pxelinux entry looks:\nLABEL Ubuntu\nMenu label Ubuntu \nkernel images/ubuntu/casper/vmlinuz.efi\nappend boot=casper vga=normal locale=de_de netboot=nfs nfsroot=192.168.178.33:/volume1/TFTP/boot/images/ubuntu initrd=images/ubuntu/casper/initrd.lz persistent\n\nBut I don't know where to put the casper-rw filesystem?\nAlso I would like to have a home directory on the NAS.\n\nA: Looking into the casper scripts I found that the system takes a casper-rw file only if it is on a vfat device.\nIf I want to use nfs, a device with the label \"casper-rw\" must be there, not a file.\n", "Q: parted mktable error. but gparted \"create partition table\" works?

So could do  this too:  \nsudo wipefs -a /dev/sdb1\n\n\n*Then make the filesystem on the first partition (sdb1) just created (-L label is optional, see the mkfs.ext3/mke2fs man page for lots of options):\nsudo mkfs.ext3 -L \"NewLabel\" /dev/sdb1\n\nHere's the built-in help from parted <dummydevicefile> help mkpart (seems more detailed than the man/info page):\nmkpart PART-TYPE [FS-TYPE] START END     make a partition\n\n    PART-TYPE is one of: primary, logical, extended  \n    FS-TYPE is one of: zfs, btrfs, ext4, ext3, ext2, fat32, fat16, hfsx,\n    hfs+, hfs, jfs, swsusp, linux-swap(v1), linux-swap(v0), ntfs, reiserfs,\n    freebsd-ufs, hp-ufs, sun-ufs, xfs, apfs2, apfs1, asfs, amufs5, amufs4,\n    amufs3, amufs2, amufs1, amufs0, amufs, affs7, affs6, affs5, affs4,\n    affs3, affs2, affs1, affs0, linux-swap, linux-swap(new),\n    linux-swap(old)\n    START and END are disk locations, such as 4GB or 10%.  Negative values\n    count from the end of the disk.  For example, -1s specifies exactly the\n    last sector.\n\n    'mkpart' makes a partition without creating a new file system on the\n    partition.  FS-TYPE may be specified to set an appropriate partition\n    ID.\n\n", "Q: Shrink volume of Primary Partition I currently run windows 8.0 and have 4 partitions. I will like to shrink the volume of my primary partition containing the win 8 OS so I can have more space to install ubuntu 14.04. My question is will it delete everything in that partition while shrinking the volume and how do I go about installing it on the new partition created.\n\nA: I have done this from an application in the Windows 7. It should be in win 8 also.\nWe can shrink the size. Afterwards \"Ubuntu\"can be installed with C.D. This C.D can be created by down-loading an Image file(nrg)and running a virtual drive/burning Disc. 'How to create a virtual drive' may be known from Internet.But we should be careful not to lose Windows after the installation of \"UBUNTU\" by deleting any partition and leaving the space without DOS partition.If space is not there we can delete unwanted files and then shrink.   \n", "Q: I can't change screen resolution on VirtualBox with Ubuntu server installed on it I have installed Ubuntu server 10.04.4 on VirtualBox but the screen appear too small. I read some guides that i have to change settings in grub to  change the screen size, so i go to /etc/default/grub, opened grub in editor and edited this line #GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 to GRUB_GFXMODE=1280x760. This is a resolution that my video card supports.  \nThen i updated grub and restarted the machine but it didn't work. When the machine starts loading in the beginning for a few seconds it goes into the screen resolution i have set but then goes back to the initial small screen resolution.\nAny idea why it doesn't work? \n\nA: Please elaborate are you talking about X11 server in the VM or about terminal fonts? In the former case you will need usual VBox Guest Extensions / DKMS, in the latter it heavily depends on text console management commands. I doubt that grub text console settings persist into login session, especially after this stuff with Plymouth et al.\n\nA: There is no need to run commands nor install guest additions. I just hit shift+ctrl+c so it takes the guest host to scale mode, and then you can adjust the scale factor from settings display and adjust it for larger. \n", "Q: Enter BIOS from Ubuntu 14.04 (Ideapad Yoga 13 - Novo Button) I changed the BIOS settings in my Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga13 running Windows 8.1, as I was having difficulties in installing Ubuntu 14.04. In the process I also changed the UEFI to LEGACY. Later Ubuntu booted up and installed from a USB stick. But I cannot access Windows, even with a recovery stick I had made earlier. It looks like my mistake has locked me out of Windows. \nI have been trying to get into BIOS to reset back to UEFI from LEGACY. But F2, F10, F12, all fail to get me into BIOS. I need help in getting into BIOS from Ubuntu. If command line is an option, please give me the appropriate commands step by step. I am a newbie to all this with little or no understanding of how these things work, so clear step-by-step advice is required. Did I tell you that Ubuntu doesn't connect to WiFi and I have to use a USB dongle to connect to the internet? I need advice on that too, please.  \nThanks Guys. The Lenovo button worked and I got Windows 8.1 and WiFi back, but the bad news is I have lost Ubuntu! When I boot, the GRUB menu with Ubuntu and Windows options does not appear anymore. In order to get Windows back, I reset the BIOS boot option from LEGACY back to UEFI. Now I cannot get into Ubuntu! Any thoughts?\n\nA: According to the manual, you enter the BIOS with the Novo button. Please see here.\n\nA: Press shift while booting the laptop and hold it until the grub menu appears, then see if system settings is an option in grub as it should get you into BIOS but may not be available in Legacy mode.  It works on my Lenovo Ideapad G710 in UEFI\n", "Q: Bluetooth and WiFi do not connect on Pavillion 15 HP I have a new Pavilion 15 AMD Radeon with a RTL8723be chip and it is recognized, but the Bluetooth is not working. It appears but never finds or shows anything.\nI tried a lot of distributions and kernels, but nothing happened, what can I do? Going back to Windows 8 is not an option.\n\nA: For the wifi, it does help if your access point is set to a single channel instead of auto and use WPA2 only with AES, no WEP or TKIP\nThe backported drivers might work better than the ones with your current kernel, see instructions http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=90&t=187963&start=20#p974596\nOne thing you need to do before backports is sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential\n", "Q: Starting bash on linux ubuntu with Android anyone knows if you can start bash script from Android to linux remotely . I've tried using vnc but are not interested in viewing the screen but simply to send the command to start remote Android\n\nA: For me looks like you want ssh linux-user@linux-host \"your script\" from Android.\nThis will need installation of ssh client on Android device. Somehow ssh client must be compiled for particular hardware / Linux kernel of the Android device.  \nAlternative is to find Java ssh client library that provides command execution and write Android app for this.  \nIf your goal is to run custom scripts occasionally (manually typing host/user/password/script name) then there are lot of ssh terminals in android appstores, starting from google play. Just expose sshd at linux machine.\n", "Q: How to update ClamAV virus definitions? What should I do in order to update anti-virus definitions and GUI version for ClamAV? I tried updating all my software, but that made no difference.\n\nA: Most distributions run the update command automatically, but if you want to manually update the ClamAV definitions, then run this command in a terminal (press Ctrl+Alt+T): \nsudo freshclam\n\nIf you are referring to ClamTk when you say its GUI, then you can download the latest .deb file which will upgrade it for you from here: https://code.google.com/p/clamtk/\n", "Q: How do I fix my minecraft?

I alternate between left-handed and right-handed mouse on even/odd days for reasons not relevant here. I use for such thing a widget in Kubuntu 12.04\nWhen it is left-handed day, my mouse understand wells that the primary button should be secondary and vice versa. The problem is that on those days the touchpad thinks \"Hey, today one tap means secondary button\" and it becomes nearly useless.\nThis happens because in the touchpad configuration settings of Kubuntu 12.04 you can assign left vs right mouse button to the action \"Tapping with one finger\", and not the primary vs secundary button. Therefore, on left-handed days one tap on the touchpad means \"secondary\".\nSure you linux experts can tell me a way to swap both mouse buttons and the meaning of touchpad taps INDEPENDENTLY and by konsole, so that I can run a script on even/odd days and forget about this nasty thing.\n\nA: This will do the trick:\nFirst:\nxinput -list\n\nAnd write down the name of your mouse as it appears among other devices. Mine is \"Logitech USB Optical Mouse\". Then:\nRight-handed:\nxinput set-button-map \"Logitech USB Optical Mouse\" 1 2 3 &\n\nLeft-handed:\nxinput set-button-map \"Logitech USB Optical Mouse\" 3 2 1 &\n\nThe touchpad is not affected.\nFor an explanation on how this works:\nman xinput\n\n", "Q: Partitioning the Boot section of the hdd So ...I built my 12 year old a computer;  I loaded Ubuntu 12 on it.  This has been in use for the last few months.  However my Son now wants Windows and wants Ubuntu completely gone. With that in  mind, I pulled out my Windows 7 disc and inserted it.  The installation screen comes up and I click \"install\".  Temporary files screen comes up then it stopped with an error code saying there is no room in my boot partition to place the files and that 837 mb is needed.  So I go into the Ubuntu menu and open the partition manager.  The root partition shows that it is locked and cannot be changed or resized.  So that is my question:  How do I resize the root partition in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Boot your original Ubuntu install media and run the \"Try\" option.  Open a terminal (Ctrl-Alt-t) and run your partition program from that.  When the disk is in use, partition changes are wisely locked out.\n", "Q: How to access the router UI when it's IP address says \"the webpage is not available\"?

I bought a used Mac Book Pro laptop. I think it's about a 2011 or 12 model. Anyway, coming from a PC World, I didn't know (until I contacted online Apple Support) that the other guy that sold it. I bought it from a pawn shop was supposed to format it, and then I'd be able to download the OS and reinstall, etc,. but the problem with even that solution is that the mother board had been replaced and didn't have a serial number, so I can't even do that. I can't get upgrades, etc, so I've just left the OS on it that's on it. I use my version of Apples I tunes, but I'm considering getting rid of the Apple OS completely, otherwise I'd have to take it to the apple store and have them do all the work at a price I probably don't want to pay. \nSo, my apple notebook / mac book pro has an I7 Intel Chip, 8 gig of RAM, and a 500 gb 7200 RPM  hard drive, but I also have an external hard drive of the same. \nWill Ubuntu install as a dual boot at least, or even could I install Ubuntu and delete the OS from Apple? Would it work? I'm thinking I could at least do the dual boot and use ubuntu until I have it the way I want it configured and it works with all the hardware and I have all the drivers I need, then delete the OS from apple? Would that be a smart route?\nThanks so much in advance. \nTim\n\nA: It should work just fine. As a recommendation use the 64-bit image of Ubuntu 14.04 because it's long term support and will provide updates and support for a couple of years while 14.10 will only last a couple on months. Yes you can dual boot. I see from your  description that you might still want to keep OS X for a while. So also as a recommendation: tick the option install Ubuntu alongside, Mac OS X in your case and not to replace Mac OS X. Later you can get rid of Mac OS X(or Ubuntu) if you so decide and extend Ubuntu to use the full HDD.\n\n", "Q: Can't install oracle java and gcc-4.9:i386 on 64bit OS I have installed oracle jdk7 from the WebUpd8team PPA and it's working just fine, now I want to run a 32bit game (Dwarf fortress with dfhack, for those who know it) and that requires gcc-4.9:i386 which depends on binutils:i386, but jdk7 depends on binutils (the 64bit version) and those two seem to be in conflict, cause when I try to install one it removes the other one. Is there a way to have both jdk7 (64bit) and gcc-4.9:i386 at the same time on Ubuntu 14.04 x64\n\nA: First of all, are you sure you mean JDK7? That came out quite a while ago. We're late into JDK8.\nSecond, have you tried installing ia32-libs yet? It has technically been removed from the central repos (Canonical, etc.); but its jobs is to act as a crutch for strictly 32-bit programs that need to run on 64-bit systems. Details here: How to compile and install ia32-libs in Ubuntu 14.04?\nHopefully Dwarf Fortress will implement some support for 64-bit architectures eventually, though. I remember having a similar problem with Steam's buggy support for 64-bit Flash; thankfully it was eventually fixed.\n", "Q: AMD graphics problem - black screen! I have a laptop HP Pavilion g6-1075er with Ubuntu 12.04 and AMD Radeon HD 6470M on board.\nI had default graphics configuration but some problems with xorg occurred.\nI had black screen, but I was able to \"reset\" graphics configuration to some workable state via recovery mode.

I am looking for minimal, good looking and friendly text mode editor for complete newbies with PC.\nI remember I've seen somewhere a terminal editor that showed menu on Esc instead of cryptic (and somewhat ugly) ^X shortcuts an the bottom, but searching through GitHub I couldn't find it.\nUPDATE: It appeared that \"friendly for complete newbies\" requires more explanation. Let's take a common scenario when user tries to use vim for the first time (which is often set as a default editor). When vim runs with text to edit, there is no help displayed and typing produces strange results, so users hit Esc or F1 and it \"doesn't work\". A friendly editor, for example, would show help on F1 key, contain menu system with highlighted shortcuts, provide syntax highlighting out of the box, and do that all by default.\n\nA: My best guess is, you're searching for the ne (the nice) editor.\nShows an ncurses Menu when pressing ESC twice or F1 once. Pretty straight forward menu. Save, Save as... Quit etc.\nsudo apt install ne ne-doc\n\n\nA: Joe\nBack in the 1990s many of my colleagues preferred Joe to either vi, pico or emacs. It is still considered by some as the most user friendly terminal based text editor.\n\nJOE is a full featured terminal-based screen editor which is\n  distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Is this possible ? I'm trying to get accustomed with the terminal on Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: The utility that you want to use is fdisk however you should use it with sudo in orded to have permission to do such administrative task. You can use sudo fdisk -l or even more specific sudo fdisk - l dev/sda to take a look on the current state of your hdd( size, partitions,free space,etc).\nNow for creating a new parttion.Use sudo fdisk  dev/sda(assuming you only have one hdd) you will be prompted with a small menu (you can alway use m for help).What you want to do is to use the n option to create a new partition. Choose p for primary or simply press Enter(it's the default option).For the first sector you can leave it empty(it will be the default option). it is on the last sector where you really choose the partition size. +500M is what you want to tpye(In other cases it could be +10G, or +200M,...) press ENTER. Now you just created a partition and you are back to the fdisk main menu.Press w to \"save changes\". \nThe next utility you want to use is called mkfs more specific mkfs.ext4(there is also mkfs.btrfs or mkfs.ntfs , mkfs.fat you got it...) sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdax(where x is the number of the new created partiton(the last one if you do a fdisk -l /dev/sda again)) this will add the ext4 fs. on top fo your partition. Done!\n", "Q: 0xc000000f error when starting Windows from Grub Recently I corrected the dual boot by re-installing the grub bootloader.\nI did that by first adding an entry pointing to Linux in easyBCD settings.\nThen, when I restarted the computer it showed Windows 7 and Grub Bootloader in Windows' bootloader. When I selected the Grub bootloader, it took me to Ubuntu Grub 2 bootloader from where I booted Ubuntu. Then I installed Boot-Repair and did receommended repair.\nEverything went fine, on startup grub bootloader appeared, but when I select Windows 7, it would then take me to the Windows bootloader with choices of Windows 7 and Grub bootloader, which I inserted using easyBCD.\nI removed this entry using easyBCD again and restarted. And since then, my Ubuntu is working fine but when booting Windows, it gives an 0xc000000f error.\nI have generated a report using boot-repair.\nWhat do I do next?\n\nA: So you are using GRUB, selecting the windows 7 entry, selecting Windows in the windows boot manager, and then it fails with the error.\nThis guide should work, however I have not tested this myself and I am not responsible for any data loss.

Windows should boot, without any sign of the boot manager.\n\n*Reboot into the Ubuntu live desktop media and install boot repair, and have boot repair install GRUB (or use the command line if you know the grub-install params).\n\n*Reboot to your hard drive, and you should see the GRUB menu with Ubuntu boot options and a Windows boot option. Boot into Ubuntu, and confirm it boots.\n\n*Boot into Windows, install EasyBCD (if it isn't already installed), and add the Linux option to the Windows boot manager. \n\n*Reboot your PC, select the Windows option in GRUB. You should see two options for booting at this point - one for Windows and one for Linux/GRUB that you added earlier.

So when I downloaded the package it is now in my downloads folder, should I unzip it here or move it to bin ?\n\nA: The binary packages on the page that you mention are intended for use on 'generic' Unix systems, where you have no software management system, or don't want to use one. However, Ubuntu's software management is excellent.\nI would advise to stay away from the binary versions, and instead go to the Repositories guide. Enter the commands under apt. That way, you don't need to worry about where to put the files. Also, if you change your mind, you can easily remove the package from your system.\n\nA: Download the elasticsearch-1.4.2.deb file from the elasticsearch.org download webpage, and then double-click it to open it for installation in the Ubuntu Software Center. It doesn't matter what folder you download it to. Since it's a .deb file, double-clicking it will open it for installation in the Ubuntu Software Center and when you install it, it will be installed the same, no matter what folder the .deb file was located in to begin with.\n\nA: You can extract your downloaded file right there or wherever you want.There is no need to move your downloaded file into /bin directory.\nbin/elasticsearch doesn't mean /bin/elasticsearch, what it is saying that you will find bin directory inside the extracted  folder and you need to execute the file elasticsearch which is present in this directory.\n", "Q: Terrible performance in desktop at 4K i'm running ubuntu 14.04, is it a known problem to have bad performance compared to windows?

I have a 16 GB USB stick which runs a live boot of Ubuntu 14.10 with antivirus software installed which (obviously) needs to be kept up to date as I use it to boot and clean infected Windows machines.\nTo make it, I used usb-creator-gtk and an ISO for Utopic x64 Desktop downloaded from The Official Site, and a 4 GB persistence file which usb-creator-gtk creates when the option is selected. Nothing fancy, nor anything complicated.\nWhen this is used on BIOS systems, it's all there. I can update the antivirus software and the changes are saved in the user persistence file (casper-rw I believe) However, when used to boot UEFI systems, none of that is there and any changes made are not saved.\nIt's like I have two environments on this stick: The UEFI version which is the same as the default ISO, DOESN'T save changes and is R-O, and the BIOS version which has my tweaks and custom apps, DOES save changes and is R-W.\nSo - how I do get the UEFI version of the live environment to save any changes made or even better, how can I get the UEFI and BIOS versions of the live environment to share the same environment?\n\nA: This is a bug, specifically bug 1159016. The solution is described in this AskUbuntu post. Basically you just have to add the word persistent in boot/grub/grub.cfg after creating the live USB:\nmenuentry \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" {\n    set gfxpayload=keep\n    linux   /casper/vmlinuz.efi persistent file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper quiet splash --\n    initrd  /casper/initrd.lz\n}\n\nEDIT:\nAs you have a large 16GB drive, I would also suggest to split the USB drive into two partitions, a ~6GB FAT32 one for the live USB + persistence, and a 10GB ext4 one for any other data you want to store on the stick. You could also use a separate partition instead of a casper-rw file if you need more than 4GB of persistence, but then usb-creator-gtk will not help you create it. (EDIT: see here on how to do that.)\nUnfortunately, when resizing FAT32 partitions you'll run into another bug (bug #1313600), so I suggest you create the partitions manually (6GB FAT32, 10GB ext4) before using usb-creator-gtk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run GParted.\n\n*Format the whole USB drive, deleting all partitions.\n\n*Create a new FAT32 partition at the beginning of the drive, with a size of ~5500MB.\n\n*Create the live USB using the FAT32 partition with usb-creator-gtk.\n\n*Finally, as I am running an UEFI system I needed to fix this bug as well by adding the word persistent in boot/grub/grub.cfg:\nmenuentry \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" {\n    set gfxpayload=keep\n    linux   /casper/vmlinuz.efi persistent file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper quiet splash --\n    initrd  /casper/initrd.lz\n}\n\n", "Q: Current time in an Ubuntu under vmware is usually incorrect I am running Ubuntu 14.04 inside Vmware Player.

I already have PuTTY and Xming working, so I can forward individual apps. But I'd really like to be able to simply forward the entire unity desktop. I've seen advice pointing me at VNC, but while I have installed the VNC package from apt, I can't seem to get it to accept connections from the tightvnc viewer on my Win7 machine. Ideally, I'd like to be able to access the desktop both remotely and locally; I already have that set up with my Ubuntu machine and dyndns.\n[edit: and I should have mentioned: the specific error I get on the windows box is \"...the target machine actively refused it\"\nSo: Is there a quick and easy way to make vnc go without a lot of fuss? Is there an easy way to do it with my current setup (I've tried just launching unity. That was not successful). I would rather not try and solve this with a VM, both because it seems like it might be cumbersome -- the VM would have to be able to get out of its virtualbox session and onto the internet -- and because I would rather have a machine that I can access remotely from my laptop or a client site machine, if I need to.\nIf it helps, what I'm trying to accomplish and why: I strongly prefer to do work from the Linux desktop but I also do a fair bit of gaming which as a practical matter leaves me stuck with windows (I have not found any of the work-arounds for that remotely satisfactory, and I'm quite aggressive about looking). At my last place, that was no problem; I had enough space to put a head on both machines, and PuTTY +X11 forwarding was fine when I didn't want to bother moving. I was sitting fat dumb and happy.

It seems crazy, but while Libre Base can export a form as PDF, there is no way to import the completed form data from the PDF into Libre Base.\nOne idea is to extract PDF form data to FDF (or unfriendly CSV) and then convert that to a friendly CSV at which point one can copy and paste CSV data into Libre Base.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I convert a PDF, FDF, or unfriendly CSV file to a friendly CSV with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Row 1: \"FieldName1, FieldName2, ...\" \n\n*Row 2: \"Value1, Value2, ...\"\n\n\n\nUseful files on Ge.tt until 2015,02,25:\n\n\n*\n\n*Super basic blank pdf with \"Submit format\" as FDF\n\n\n*\n\n*Libre Base > Forms > Edit > Open Database Object --> File > Export as PDF\n\n\n*Filled PDF made from (1)\n\n\n*\n\n*Type data manually\n\n\n*Extracted CSV data from (2)\n\n\n*\n\n*pdftk filled_form-submit_format_fdf.pdf dump_data_fields output filled_form.csv\n\n\n*Extracted FDF data from (2)\n\n\n*\n\n*pdftk filled_form-submit_format_fdf.pdf generate_fdf output filled_form.fdf\n*Note: You can also use Libre Base to export a blank form as XML or HTML, but I don't know how to input data into those files nor import that data back into Base.\n\nA: How to convert FDF to CSV?\nOption A:\nawk -F \"[()]\" '{ if ($1==\"/V \") value[$2];} \\\n    END {printf( \"CompanyName\\tEmailAddress\\t\\tCountryOrRegion\\n\" ); \\\n           for (x in value)printf(\"%s\\t\", x);print \"\" ; \\\n    }' filled_form.fdf > filled_form.CSV\n\nOption B:\ngrep -oP '(?<=\\/T \\(txt).*(?=\\))' filled_form.fdf |awk '{ORS=(NR%3?\",\":RS)}1'; \\\ngrep -oP '(?<=\\/V \\().*(?=\\))' filled_form.fdf |awk '{ORS=(NR%3?\",\":RS)}1'; \n\nShort version of above command would be:\npaste -sd, <(grep -oP '(?<=\\/T \\(txt).*(?=\\))' filled_form.fdf) <(grep -oP '(?<=\\/V \\().*(?=\\))' filled_form.fdf)\n\nOption C:\nawk 'NR%2==0{type[$0]} NR%2{value[$0]} END{for (x in type)printf(\"%s\\t\", x);print \"\" ;for (y in value)printf(\"%s\\t\", y);print \"\" ;}' <(grep -oP '(?<=\\/T \\(txt|\\/V \\().*(?=\\))' filled_form.fdf)\n\nHow to convert unfriendly CSV to friendly CSV ?\nOption A:\nawk -F: '{ if ($1==\"FieldValue\") value[$2];} \\\n    END {printf( \"CountryOrRegion\\tCompanyName\\tEmailAddress\\n\" ); \\\n           for (x in value)printf(\"%s\\t\", x) ;print \"\"; \\\n    }' filled_form.csv > friendly_filled_form.CSV\n\nOption B:\ngrep -oP '(?<=FieldName: txt).*' filled_form.csv |awk '{ORS=(NR%3?\",\":RS)}1'; \\\ngrep -oP '(?<=FieldValue: ).*' filled_form.csv |awk '{ORS=(NR%3?\",\":RS)}1'\n\n*Note that this command is one linear. so for running it you have to type/copy both line.\nAnd short version for this one would be:\npaste -sd, <(grep -oP '(?<=FieldName: txt).*' filled_form.csv) <(grep -oP '(?<=FieldValue: ).*' filled_form.csv)\n\nOption C:\nawk 'NR%2{type[$0]} NR%2==0{value[$0]} END{for (x in type)printf(\"%s\\t\", x);print \"\" ;for (y in value)printf(\"%s\\t\", y);print \"\" ;}' <(grep -oP '(?<=FieldName: txt|FieldValue: ).*' filled_form.csv)\n\nor even this one:\nawk 'NR%2{type[$0]} NR%2==0{value[$0]} END{for (x in type)printf(\"%s\\t\", x);print \"\" ;for (y in value)printf(\"%s\\t\", y);print \"\" ;}' <(awk -F'FieldValue: |FieldName: txt' 'NF>1{print $2}' filled_form.csv)\n\nHow to convert PDF to CSV?\nI will complete the solution with pdfgrep tomorrow but if you want to try it for yourself, here is the command:\npdfgrep 'CompanyName|CountryOrRegion|EmailAddress' filled_form-submit_format_fdf.pdf\n\nIt needs to work on output format. If you want to get only whole words, use the -C 0 option. good luck and I hope helps ;)\n\nA: Answering especially your comment here:\n\nI wish Base could decode a PDF file that Base created\n\nNo, it is not reasonable to expect that any program should be able to read a PDF it generated, not any more than expecting a printer to be able to churn back a sheet it had just printed and giving you back your document.\nPDF is a printing/archival format. It is basically(1) a series of instructions of the kind of \"put the word hello at position x,y in the page\". So when you see in a PDF:\n\nThere is no way for a computer program to say if it's two rows by three columns or two rows by two columns containing spaces in it(2). The number 3 could be a 2.95 rounded up, even. You can't know because the info is simply not there. So no, you never think that going back from PDF to your data should be possible(3). \nHowever, you can try to convert the information to things more manageable with, for example, pdftotext(4):\n[romano:~/tmp] 1 % pdftotext Untitled1.pdf; cat Untitled1.txt\nSheet1\n\nshiny\nmint\n\nnew\nused\n\n3\n1\n\nPage 1\n\n...and then use scripting, manual editing, whatever to massage it up. \n\nFootnotes: \n(1) really, really understatement here. \n(2) It's 2 by 2, really. \n(3) I have even seen PDFs where the creator program went long stretches to make this almost impossible, by putting each glyph independently and randomly in the page, to make tampering with it very difficult. No, I can't find the example any more... \n(4) from the package poppler-utils \n\nA: LibreOffice can produce a pdf form.  \nGetting the data therefrom to a CSV can be achieved using free Foxit Reader which works well under Bionic Beaver 18.04.  \nWith a completed form loaded in Foxit Reader select \"form\" from the \"connect\" dropdown.  A tool button should then offer \"Export Form Data\".  The save window will then offer choices of XML, XFDF (whatever that is), TXT and CSV.     \n", "Q: Cannot see bitrate and other information when using iwconfig command I just moved from win8 to ubuntu today, but had done it on a friend's computer the day before.

See community WIFI Docs for Broadcom.  Exact instructions depend upon your exact Broadcom chip.\n", "Q: can someone remotely access your ubuntu user account on your computer if they steal your ubuntu username and password I would like to know if it is possible for someone who steals your ubuntu username and password to remotely access your ubuntu user account on your computer and even see what you are doing when you are logged in,\nthank you in advance for your help...\n\nA: Unless you have some remote access system installed like SSH or a Remote Desktop program, it is not possible without having physical access to the machine.\nHowever in the unlikely chance that there is such a large bug in Ubuntu that allows someone to do just that- I think we'd all need to take a step back.\n\nA: Should someone get your password, they would not able to do either of those, unless you install an SSH server on your computer, which (I think) does not come by default.\n\nA: Yes, it would absolutely be possible for someone to remotely access your computer with your user name and password. There are many ways to do this (ssh, vnc, etc).\nThe good news is that these backdoors are disabled by default, but if you have opened one of these backdoors in the past for your own use (I know I have), in many cases your username and password will get them in.\nOr, if this person who knows your password has had physical access to your machine, I would assume they have already opened several backdoors into your machine.\nMaybe I'm paranoid, but I would never trust another user with my password - and if someone stole my login information for a computer, I would no longer trust that computer.\n\nA: \nCan they see what you are doing when you are logged in ?\n\nIf they have access to remote desktop program , such as Remmina - probably. I havent used one so can't say for sure. I've used telnet and ssh. If it's ssh or telnet - most likely not. They certainly can list what processes/programs you are running with ps aux | grep username but I doubt they can see you actually typing that in. \nSpeaking of Remmina, if I'm not mistaken, you can set it up such that there would be a second password for accessing your desktop remotely. \n\nStolen password\n\nYou could address that with changing your password to something else with passwd username. Among other things, I suggest you set up your password to expire after a period of time. This answer addresses how you can set up password expiration.\n\nPreventing unauthorised access\n\nRemove all possible points of access - remote desktop software and block ssh. Make another account for admin tasks and use yours as regular user, without sudo access. \nMake your sudo time out also. Read up on some other security hardening tips.\n", "Q: (Ubuntu 14.10) 3 Monitors on laptop with Intel HD Graphics 4000 I have an HP Touchsmart laptop that has a 3rd-gen Intel Core i3-3120M with integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000. I'd like to be able to use my internal display, an HDMI display, and a VGA display (I have all the ports necessary), and I'd like to extend the desktop to each. According to Intel's website, that specific combination of displays is supported by Intel HD Graphics 4000 on any 3rd-gen Core chip. However, I can only use two displays at a time. When I try to connect the thrid, I get an error saying \"could not set the configuration for CRTC 64.\" I've read that Xinerama can be used to run 3 displays, but it requires me to edit my xorg.conf file, which I can't find. Also, I can't get more than 2 displays running on Windows 8.1 either. Is there a way I can run 3 displays, or did Intel lie to me?\n\nA: You should look for xrandr and arandr (xrandr gui). This is the best solution I found to set up freely multiple screens under ubuntu\nArandr let you configure screen : \n\n\n*\n\n*Status (Active / Inactive)\n\n*Position (free positioning)\n\n*Orientation (normal, right, inverted or left)\n\n*Resolution\n\n\nNote to intel graphics owners : if you want to use more than 2 screens, be aware to have two configurations set for all your screens. (ex : Screens 1/2&3 : 1280x1024 60.0 and screens 4/5&6 : 1280x1024 75.0)\nBut this type of config is available through DisplayPort only for most of configs\nIntel only support 2 PLL (wikipedia) this why only two configuration sets.

Basically we did (not sure if this was the exact command):\nsudo apt-get install-desktop\n\nThen we ran some updates.\nThen we downloaded the .run from teamspeak then do a command to change the perms and make our .run executable.\nThen we run a command to extract that .run into a folder (i forget the commands sorry.)\nNow, in our TeamSpeak3 folder we should just have to execute a .sh or a client program. We get the error:\nfailed to execute child process <path> no such file or directory\n\nCan anyone help us?\nEDIT: We've followed these steps:\nHow to install Teamspeak 3 client on ubuntu 12.04 lts 32 bit?\nand AFTER those steps we get the error I mentioned above.\nfailed to execute child process <path> no such file or directory\n\n\nA: you can try:\ncd <path to folder>\nsudo chmod +x ./<filename.sh>\n./<filename.sh>\n\nfor example, if the file was located in your downloads and the file is named run, the code would look like:\ncd /home/kulofae/Downloads\nsudo chmod +x ./run.sh  or sudo chmod +x run.sh \n./run.sh or run.sh\n\n\nA: I'm not that familiar with this program, but I would recommend reading through their quick start guide: http://media.teamspeak.com/ts3_literature/TeamSpeak%203%20Server%20Quick%20Start.txt\nAccording to the guide, you should download the tar file that corresponds to your version of Ubuntu (64 bit or 32 bit). Make sure you're installing the server. I'm not sure what you downloaded, but there is no file ending in .run in the server archive I see on their website. The file you download from them should be named either:\n\n\n*\n\n*teamspeak3-server-linux_x86.tar.gz\n\n*teamspeak3-server-linux_amd64.tar.gz\n\n\nOnce you've downloaded that file, they instruct you to run the following commands:\n$ tar xzf teamspeak3-server-linux_x86.tar.gz\n$ cd teamspeak3-server-linux_x86\n$ ./ts3server_minimal_runscript.sh\n\nThe first command extracts the files from the archive, the second moves into that folder, and the third command is a script that runs the installation.\nYou shouldn't need to do anything with permissions - the .sh file in that archive is already executable.\nYou should also make sure you have libstdc++ 6 installed, which this depends on. Run:\nsudo apt-get install libstdc++6\n\nWhich will either install that package or tell you you are already on the newest version available for 12.04.\n\nA: First download your package\nwget dl.4players.de/ts/releases/3.0.13.3/teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64-3.0.13.3.tar.bz2\n\nExtract it\ntar jxf teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64-3.0.13.3.tar.bz2\n\nNow change to that extracted directory\ncd ~/teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64\n\nNow you can run the server start script\n./ts3server_startscript.sh start\n\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Recover files from one drive from a raid1 array A couple years ago I created a raid 1 array using two 1TB drives in a computer running Ubuntu 12.04. These drives stored my files (pictures, videos and music) and acted as a server for other computers in the house. The operating system was on a different, smaller, disk. When I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 I was worried about the potential of overwriting some of these files and unplugged the two hard drives in the RAID array to be sure nothing happened to the files. I never got around to replacing them and recently got a new computer. In my naivete I thought I could just plug these two drives into a NAS and retain all the files on them. I put one drive in the NAS and it appears to have been reformated. I tried connecting the other drive back to the original computer, now running Ubuntu 14.04, but it would not mount. Any ideas for how I can rescue my pictures, videos and music? Thanks!\n\nA: If your main goal is to recover the files, I would first try the accepted solution at stackexchange.

The reason why this problem is worse on Linux is because the hardware vendor has written special drivers to get around hardware limitations and all Linux developers can do is guess at what they've done to fix problems.\nYou can't just compare Windows and Linux and say that one is better than the other. All that said, sound in Linux is an enigma. It always has been since the 90s. Multiple drivers and daemons for managing the sound has made for a giant mess.\nOne program you can run to give you a quick idea of what might be causing the distortion is the program alsamixer from the command line. It will show bar graphs of each channel's sound level. You can scroll right or left using the arrow keys and adjust sound levels up or down using up/down arrow.  If any of the channels are set to the max (in the red), then that may be where your distortion problem lies. Sometimes these sound channel levels don't show up in the GUI and you have to use a program like this to adjust the levels.  Like I said, sound is a mess because of multiple sound daemons (alsa vs. pulse vs. whatever other sound system is in fashion this year).\nMost of these problems can be fixed and you're more likely to get a more helpful answer if you give more specific details about your problem instead of asking general questions about quality.\n", "Q: PATH is not getting exported by default in Ubuntu 12.04 When i run su on command line and enter root password, I am getting error as mentioned below:\n\nCommand 'lesspipe' is available in the following places\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*/bin/lesspipe\n  \n*/usr/bin/lesspipe\nThe command could not be located because '/usr/bin:/bin' is not\n  included in the PATH environment variable.\nlesspipe: command not found\nCommand 'dircolors' is available in '/usr/bin/dircolors'\nThe command could not be located because '/usr/bin' is not included in\n  the PATH environment variable.\n\nI have to manually export PATH variable which earlier used to work by default.\nI then set the PATH variable in bashrc\n\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\"\n\nNow whenever I run su, I get this :\n\nbash: groups: command not found.\n\nHowever, I can tab groups command and the PATH variable is also set.

The folders you mentioned are in fact part of the PATH by default (unless you changed it).\nIf you want to extend your PATH:\n# extend perserving old path (locations are prioritized by order)\nPATH=$PATH:/some/folder\nexport PATH\n\nYou can add this code in  ~/.bashrc to have it available to you specifically.\nyou can also add /some/folder to the line I mentioned in /etc/environment to have it available to everyone, so you'd end up with:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/some/folder\"\n\n", "Q: package \"state\" vs \"selection state\" All answers that I read, suggest listing/saving package selection states. i.e. dpkg --get-selections\nBut the selection state could be different from actual. So why use that?\nIs it just because getting the actual package state is more involved?\nFor example getting \"installed packages\", has 2 possible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*get names of package whose selection state is install with\ndpkg --get-selections | grep install | cut -f1\n\n*get names of packages whose state is installed with\ndpkg -l | tail -n +6 | grep '^.i' | cut -d' ' -f3\nUnlike dpkg --get-selections dpkg -l is meant for viewing not processing. Why is that?\n\nA: dpkg --get-selections only output the  package selection states not package states. Output of dpkg -l  contains the the package actual states however \nprocessing dpkg -l output is bit tough because of being more closer to the graphical approach.\nSo if you want to extract the package state , you can use dpkg-query tool.\nIt provide formatting option using -f, --showformat=format\nFrom man dpkg-query\n-f, --showformat=format\n              This  option  is used to specify the format of the output --show\n              will produce. The format is a string that  will  be  output  for\n              each package listed.\n\nSo I have combined ${binary:Package} field with ${Status} to get the actual status of a package. \ndpkg-query --show -f='${binary:Package} \\t\\t ${Status}\\n'\n\nFor a more formatted output, you can use \ndpkg-query --show -f='${binary:Package} ${Status}\\n'  | awk '{ printf \"%-60s %s\\n\", $1, $2\" \"$3\" \"$4}'\n\n\nExample\nUsing dpkg -l\n$dpkg -l vlc\nDesired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold\n| Status=Not/Inst/Conf-files/Unpacked/halF-conf/Half-inst/trig-aWait/Trig-pend\n|/ Err?=(none)/Reinst-required (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)\n||/ Name                           Version              Architecture         Description\n+++-==============================-====================-====================-=================================================================\nhU  vlc                            2.2.0~pre2-4build1   amd64                multimedia player and streamer\n\nUsing dpkg-query --show\n$ dpkg-query --show -f='${binary:Package} ${Status}\\n' vlc  | awk '{ printf \"%-60s %s\\n\", $1, $2\" \"$3\" \"$4}'\nvlc                                                          hold ok unpacked\n\n", "Q: UID of script \"/var/www/html/phpinfo.php\" is smaller than min_uid My Apache works and I get the default page when I access it from a browser.\nBut when I created a PHP test script phpinfo.php and placed it in /var/www/html I get the following error occuring in /var/log/apache2/error.log:\nSoftException in Application.cpp:350 : UID of script \"/var/www/html/phpinfo.php\" is smaller than min_uid\n\nI can find nothing on the internet to resolve this!\nThe only suggestion that seemed relevant was to change the ownership of phpinfo.php.\nThe ownership of files in  /var/www/html are as follows:\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 www-data www-data  4096 Jan 26 09:43 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 www-data www-data  4096 Jan 25 20:44 ../\n-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 11510 Jan 25 20:45 index.html\n-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data    22 Jan 26 09:43 phpinfo.php\n\nPlease help!\n\nA: Sounds like you're running suPHP judging by the error. www-data has a uid and gid of less than 500.

See link for details.\nIt can be installed from Synaptic or the terminal.\nThe command to cycle between clone, extended, internal and external displays should be like this:\n\ndisper --cycle-stages='-e : -c : -S : -s' --cycle\n\nIn that case, it would extend to the right. To cycle between the same options but extend to the left:\n\ndisper --direction=left --cycle-stages='-e : -c : -S : -s' --cycle\n\nThe command can be then associated to a short-key.\n\nThe simplest shortkey might be the Display key (XF86Display) if there is one available on the keyboard. (Because of a bug, in my case that involves an interference with the Super key, so that I prefer to use XF86HomePage.)\nDisper will detect displays and use the maximal resolutions by default. If no external display is connected, nothing will happen when the short-key is touched.\n\nA: Setting a new keyboard shortcut is possible (in Settings -> Keyboard -> Application shortcuts), but finding the right terminal command...\nxrandr can change the resolution, I know it works if you're using one monitor, it's man page could have more info on what you'd like to do, other answers advise using it...? Here's a clip from it's man page:\n\n--left-of, --right-of, --above, --below, --same-as another-output\n  Use one of these options to position the output relative to the position of another\n  output.  This  allows convenient tiling of outputs within the screen.  The position\n  is always computed relative to the new position of the other output, so it  is  not\n                valid to say --output a --left-of b --output b --left-of a.\n--off  Disables the output.\n--reflect reflection\n  Reflection  can  be  one of 'normal' 'x', 'y' or 'xy'.

Try to enter BIOS and select legacy boot for your Ubuntu. There can be some problems though. I personally had to install both Windows and Ubuntu in Legacy mode, because dual boot didn't run with UEFI enabled.\n\nA: I experienced the same problem.

Thanks a lot!\n\nA: I couldn't find anything for this in the advanced XFCE settings editor (xfce4-settings-editor). It might also not work simply because its a function of compositing.\nThere is a program for automating key presses and mouse clicks/movements called xdotool (available from apt). It is supposed to be able to simulate mouse wheel movements using mouse buttons 4 and 5. You can also use it to press the Alt key (on my system its the Super key because I set that to be my XFCE window function key).\nIdeally you'd put a command line this in a script file and then run it using another keystroke:\nxdotool --clearmodifiers keydown Alt click 4 keyup Alt\n\nThen make another script that runs the same except click 5 for zooming out.\n", "Q: Intermitent dissapearence of mouse speed option So, I just noticed that my computer (A desktop running 14.04 LTS) doesn't have the option to adjust the speed of my mouse, unless I plug in a certain mouse. (A really old one, to be specific.) However, settings that are saved when changed with this mouse plugged in are saved for other mice as well.\nI noticed this when my wireless mouse died, and I plugged in my old corded backup that I've been using for at least ten years. It was way too slow, so per the norm, I went to the settings and adjusted the mouse speed up. Obviously, the slider was there, because I made the adjustment successfully.\nNow, yesterday, I got new batteries for the wireless mouse and plugged it back in. The settings were set way to high for it, so I went to turn the sensitivity down. But alas, the slider for mouse speed was missing! Only the \"Primary button\" right/left and the \"Double click speed\" options were available.\nI decided to go back to the last time I could use it; when the older mouse was plugged in. After unplugging my new mouse, and plugging in my older mouse, I went back into the settings. The slider for speed was back! I adjusted it to a painfully low setting, then saved and switched mice yet again. The speed was better, but still a little fast.\nI was getting slightly impatient at this point. Luckily, it lead to a somewhat interesting, albeit expected, discovery. Plugging in both mice at once caused the slider to pop up (had the mouse settings open on my screen) and I could adjust it from there.\nSo, I guess what I wanted to ask was, why? Why does my computer do this? Could it be because the hardware on my machine is not new enough to properly detect the wireless mouse's hardware, despite Ubuntu's software? (Relatively old machine here.) Also, is there a fix other than plugging in this antique mouse?\nThanks for reading and helping!\n\nA: Just a workaround here - I am also affected by this bug, but the terminal command xset allows you to adjust the mouse speed using the command line.  I suggest doing a man xset to learn more about the command, but \"xset m 1.3 0\" is the magic number for me.  The format of the command is xset m speed threshold.  More explanation on what threshold means can be found in the manpages.\nThe link to the bug in launchpad is here.\n", "Q: A bash scripting problem In advance , I'd say I know the basic syntax of bash scripts but the following statement is not recognized for me :\nif [ ! -f /etc/debian_version ]\n\ncould you help me what this condition going to work ?\nThanks.\n\nA: It tests whether the file \"/etc/debian_version\" exists and is a regular file.\n", "Q: Hard disk free space going down? I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and I've noticed that my hard disk space is steadily going down. I've been checking it about once a week, and I've noticed a couple of gigs go down per check. I'm not installing anything, so I'm wondering as to why it keeps going down. \nI've noticed an earlier post about the xsession file, and have run that command > ~/.xsession-errors and > ~/.xsession-errors.old. This didn't do much, if anything, to lower space. I thought that google chrome might be the culprit, because I have to launch it in the terminal, and I often get errors from it in the terminal.\nAnyway, I was wondering as to what might be causing this, and if there was any command/program I could use to track or otherwise find out what's using my disk space up. I only have an 80 Gig hard disk, and 45 gigs are being used right now. So, any help would be appreciated!\n\nA: To see what is using your disk space, you could use the Disk Usage Analyzer tool \"baobab\". \nIf not installed by default, install via the Software Centre, or from a terminal with\nsudo apt-get install baobab \n\nThis program works better if run as root, because there are certain files not visible to normal users, so run it with\npkexec env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY XAUTHORITY=$XAUTHORITY baobab\n\nThis should show you what is using up your disk space. \nThe command df -h will also give you a rough indication. \n", "Q: How do you create a shell script?

This is installed at the same time as the base nginx package. Many packages are split up like this.\nWhen you purge something, only the specified packages are purged. If things need to be removed to satisfy dependencies (which may be the case here), they will just be removed, not purged. It may be the case that nginx-common is still installed.\nEither which way, the solution is the same. Purge nginx-common:\nsudo apt-get purge nginx-common\n\n\nIn other cases where you have remnant /etc/ files after a purge, this is often down to files that didn't exist at install-time. In your case they all looked like packaged files but in many cases there could be a user-created file sitting in there that they might want to rescue before manually deleting.\nApt will never remove these, even with purge. If you're sure you want to delete them, sudo rm -rf /etc/nginx will do the trick, but again, be very careful.\n", "Q: Software Updater not starting up So my original problem was that I couldn't get the ubuntu software centre to startup, it would just freeze for a while loading and then would crash.\nSo i tried to remove USC : Successfully\nWhen I came to re-install I ran into a problem with the sudo-apt install / get and loads of other commands.\nThis is what i get when i enter sudo apt-get update\n\nE: Malformed line 56 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse)\nE: The list of sources could not be read.\n\nI looked into the folder /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ and there seems to be no source list file, however there appears to be one in its parent folder.\nI'm still new to this and I couldn't find a solution anywhere on the forums.

The previous releases of the Nvidia drivers did not help. Thus it appears to be a bug in the official Nvidia drivers as the Nouveau drivers resolve the above issues. \nHowever, Nouveau also introduces other problems since they are just a reverse engineer of the official drivers and do not support the latest features and fixes required by power users or for work purposes.\nIt would appear that Nvidia still have very little interest in properly supporting Ubuntu.

I've started getting involved with triaging bugs. Three of the first four bugs I looked at were about Hardy (8.04).\nWhat should I do to help triage bugs for versions of Ubuntu that are no longer supported? Should I just set them to 'invalid'?\n\nA: I am a member of Bug Control (one of the higher-privileges bug triager groups) and the Bug Squad.  We have specific guidelines for triage of old bugs (excluding atypical, special guidelines bugs which have special nonstandard workflows)\nTL;DR: The status we set on EOL bugs is dependent on multiple factors.\nDO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER A BUG STATUS IF IT IS \"Fix Released\", \"Invalid\", or \"Won't Fix\" already!!!  These bugs are already considered 'closed' and you should NOT mess with them!\nIf the bug is 'Fix Committed' then it depends on what you do there - either try and see if a fix was ever committed, or mark \"Won't Fix\", since EOL release.  Be careful here. Sometimes a release isn't really fully EOL so you have to keep that in mind (10.04 Server for example).\nIf the bug is known to be fixed AFTER the EOL release is out we Won't Fix the EOL release's bug.\nIf the bug is not confirmed fixed, we mark Incomplete and ask for people with the oldest supported release and other supported releases to try and replicate the bug, and report back.  If nobody can confirm we can either leave Incomplete until the bug autoexpires or Won't Fix the bug (usually the former if nobody responds back, or the latter if people report back and can't replicate the bug).\nIf the bug is solely affecting Hardy and no other releases then we Won't Fix the bug.\nIn any case that we mark the bug Wont Fix we always comment explaining why and that they should change the status to New (if no other release series is on the bug) if they find the bug or reproduce in a supported release.\nIn any case we mark incomplete we comment why we did and ask for additional tasks or info and mention the bug will autoclose and expire after some period of inactivity.\nInvalid only makes sense if we have a new bug filed on the EOL release, then we can mark it 'Invalid' or 'Won't Fix'.  We typically reserve 'Invalid' for \"Not a Bug\" bugs, or bugs which are against nonexistent packages or things not in the repositories (such as PPA versions and such instead of the versions in the repositories.)\nYour best bet is to follow the triage guide and stop by the #ubuntu-bugs channel on Freenode IRC and ask for per-bug guidelines and tips and suggestions from other bug squaders and also bug control members.\n(This has been on my radar for some time... I am going to go through the EOL-release-series-targeted bugs by script and automatically close them all via the Launchpad API in a few days after checking with other bug controllers and the security team and other teams to make sure it won't impinge on their processes or cause mayhem)\n", "Q: Stuck at GRUB menu I feel really dumb saying this...\nThanks to the help I received on this forum, I finally fixed my Wine/Pipelight issue and could finally upgrade from 'Trusty' to 'Utopic'.

I've read a lot of threads about how to set up dual boot in a system like this but since I've read that Ubuntu now supports UEFI and Secure Boot I'm leaving both enabled to install 14.10. There are two things I'm not too sure about yet though. \n\n\n*\n\n*While installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1, where should I install the bootloader? I've read guides saying you need to install it where Window's bootloader is, other saying you need to install it in the MBR and others saying you have to create a /boot partition for Ubuntu and install it there. Help!. \n\n*I just booted into a Live sessions and I couldn't connect to the WiFi network; only the wired networks were being displayed. I tried googling around for the WiFi drivers but couldn't find any, any idea where I can find them? I don't have an Ethernet cable available now so I can't really install it as is then update through Ubuntu itself.\n\n\nAdding more info: \nOutput for lspci -nnk | grep -iA2 net\n04:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Qualcomm Atheros Killer E220x Gigabit Ethernet Controller [1969:e091] (rev 13)\n    Subsystem: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd.

Didn't have to disable secure boot or anything at all and I can boot both OSs. \nThanks!. \n", "Q: How to switch back to Unity I have a very big problem. I just installed cairo-dock and I logged out from my Unity.\nAs I logged out, Ubuntu showed me options to select other desktop, I saw an option of Cairo Desktop and I chose it and logged in. But since I logged in, it just shows me a black screen.\nI don't be able to do anything! I do not see anything on the screen, can't even open terminal. Keyboard has stopped working and mouse pointer is not visible!\nThere is no option to logout. I'm in a big trouble. When I press power key of my laptop, it shuts down but when I start it again, it shows me black screen only.\nI want to switch to Unity environment back. Is there any option? I don't want to format my computer.\nI use Ubuntu-14.04.1.\n\nA: Try to open a TTY by using Ctrl+Alt+F1 and login with your username and password. Restart LightDM by typing:\n\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nYou should get in the login screen, where you have to choose Unity. When logged in with Unity session, you can use the terminal or return to the tty and delete the package by using:\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge cairo-dock\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+F1\n\n*login and password\n\n*sudo apt-get purge cairo-dock\n\n*sudo reboot\n\n", "Q: network-manager won't show same SSID hotspots! I'm currently using WICD and it shows 4 different hotspots and their details (channel, etc). These 4 hotspots have the very same SSID. I can connect to whichever I want. So far so good. \nThe thing is, I need to use a VPN so I moved back to network-manager since it's very easy to configure one with it. The problem is, I want to be able to choose which one of these hotspots I'll connect to. But since network-manager only shows one (don't know how it is chosen)...it makes everything harder.\nBasically, I need to be able to see, and to choose, every single network available and not just the one NM considers the best.\nOR\nA way to use a VPN with WICD.\nPS: If you're wondering, these are free hotspots and for some reason some are slower than others, that's why I need to connect to one in a specific channel.\n\nA: Network Manager attempts to roam for you.  It will show only one SSID even when there are many access points, then attempt to stay connected to the best one.  Access points with the same SSID should really be identical and there is no reason to prefer one over another.  Unfortunately neither Wicd or Network Manager does a perfect job of this.  Wicd doesn't try and just stays connected to the access point you pick unless it is completely hopeless.  Network Manager has some roaming logic but doesn't always get it right.\nYou used to be able to disable roaming from Gnome Network Admin and I can't imagine they've removed that option.  Go into connection properties and there should be a checkbox.\n", "Q: The program 'sed' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing [sed: not found] I was trying to create my own program in the /usr/local/bin.  \nDuring the process I messed something up and now anytime I press enter or type anything in the command line, I get this stupid message....!\nThe program 'sed' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing\nHow can I get rid of \"sed\" or whatever it is.\n\nWhat I have discovered thus far about 'sed', it is SED Stream Editor which manipulates text.  I used to use it within my .bashrc for git parsing and coloring of text.  I now disabled the git parsing function within my .bashrc.\nHow can I get 'sed' installed again?\nI ran apt-get install sed ... It tells me sed is already the newest version.  SED is now causing me more issues.  My git commands are breaking and even my apt-get remove and updates sometimes breaks as well.\nThis is another example of what SED is causing me since SED is not found\n/etc/grub.d/00_header: 1: /etc/grub.d/00_header: sed: not found\nrun-parts: /etc/kernel/postrm.d/zz-update-grub exited with return code 127\nFailed to process /etc/kernel/postrm.d at /var/lib/dpkg/info/linux-image-ex....\n\nWhich sed\nWhen I run which sed ... It comes out completely blank, it doesn't output something like this /usr/bin/sed. \nHere is my current PATH=.., which I pulled from /ect/environment\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\n\n\nA: Besides copying the binary from another machine and hoping it is the correct version, this can also be solved by using apt or apt-get to install the sed package and passing the --reinstall option so that the .deb file will be downloaded and installed even though Ubuntu's package manager thinks it is already present.\nsudo apt install --reinstall sed\n\nThis works with apt-get instead of apt, too. It uninstalls and reinstalls the package in a single step. The situation in this problem is that the se package is already installed but the executable has been deleted, so reinstalling solves that. Without the --reinstall flag, the package manager assumes nothing has to be done, because the package is installed already.\nYou can run sudo apt update first if you want, though it will not typically be necessary in this case, unless you've modified your software sources without doing so. You can pass the --purge flag too if you want but it's unnecessary here, since that just causes conffiles for the package to be removed when it is uninstalled.\nsed is a utility that programs are generally allowed to assume exists and to rely on themselves. As you noticed, the scripts that run when installing, removing, or upgrading software can use sed. That's the source of your specific error messages. In theory  APT or dpkg could rely on it directly and be unable to reinstall it. In practice, this does not appear to happen, and I don't expect it to. I've tested this on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\nI cannot think of any situation where replacing the binary fixes the problem but reinstalling neither works nor shows an error immediately (see comments on the post). Although I cannot be 100% sure that these instructions would work for you--because perhaps more was broken than documented in the question--they should generally work at least as reliably as manually replacing /bin/sed for others who experience this problem.\n\nA: Anyway the simple quick fix would be to create softlink for the sed in the machine. first, check for 'which sed'\nwhich sed\n\nthen create softlink to the above result\nln -sf /bin/sed /usr/bin/sed\n\nHope this would help!\n\nA: My Solution:\nI copied a sed from another ubuntu server I was running. scp me@server:/bin/sed /bin/sed\n"]
