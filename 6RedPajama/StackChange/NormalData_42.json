With the newest OS X Update (10.10.5), Apple is introducing OpenSSL 0.9.8. I browsed through the official OpenSSL page, and there I could get Version 1.0.2.\nMy question is: Why is Apple using an older Version of OpenSSL? Is it because of deprecated functions in Version 1.0 or what is the reason behind it?\nSource: Apple Security pages\n\nA: \nWhy is Apple using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL?\n\nIt isn't.\nIf you click on the link you posted in your question, you will see that this update patches a number of vulnerabilities which exist identically in OpenSSL 0.9.8, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, and 1.0.2.\nSo, in other words, the version you are later suggesting as an alternative, 1.0.2, was just as vulnerable as 0.9.8 was, and both were fixed at the same time.\n\nWith the newest OS X Update (10.10.5), Apple is introducing OpenSSL 0.9.8. I browsed through the official OpenSSL page, and there I could get Version 1.0.2.\n\nApple is updating OpenSSL to 0.9.8zg, which is just 2 months old, and only 4 weeks older than 1.0.2d.\n\nMy question is: Why is Apple using an older Version of OpenSSL? Is it because of deprecated functions in Version 1.0 or what is the reason behind it?\n\nThat is something you will have to ask Apple. My best guess is that 0.9.8 is the version they did their compatibility testing with, and upgrading to a newer version would require a completely new round of testing for a component that is deprecated anyway. Since it is deprecated, newer software (which would possibly rely on newer features) shouldn't use it anyway, and older software which still uses it doesn't use the new features (because they didn't exist) and might even be broken by an update, so why bother?\nAs long as the OpenSSL community still maintains the 0.9.8 branch, Apple doesn't even have to do the work of backporting patches.\nNote that this is nothing unusual. Apple shipped an old version of Ruby for a very long time, and they generally don't update during a release cycle, only in between releases. Linux distributions as well BSDs and other Unix distributions also typically don't update versions during a release, they only apply bugfixes and security fixes. Debian, in particular, generally doesn't even fix all bugs, only security vulnerabilities and bugs which might result in loss of user data – any change, even a bugfix is a potential incompatibility and a potential for new bugs; known bugs are better than unknown ones!\n\nA: OpenSSL is deprecated officially. It exists (for what little time Apple allows going forward) to not break software that doesn't either migrate to Apple's alternative or bundle SSL internally with the app. \nSee the Apple Developer link for the deprecation announcement: (the other links are easier reading / more synthesis of the why as to the what)\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7406946/why-is-apple-deprecating-openssl-in-macos-10-7-lion\n\n*http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/33696323211/wherein-i-write-apples-technote-about-openssl-on\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/cryptoservices/GeneralPurposeCrypto/GeneralPurposeCrypto.html\n", "Q: Syncing a music directory with a device when the device doesn't have enough space In my library I have a directory with several inteligent and fixed playlist, which I want to sync my device.

Lately it often starts swapping, which is obviously not so great.\nFirefox usually takes a huge amount (~ 1GB) which is kind of to be expected. Nevertheless, after booting it up (no applications running so far) the memory baseline is already at ~ 1.5 GB.

Could it be that I experience some kind of bloat / fragmentation that is related to this?\n\n\nA: \nAre these numbers to be expected nowadays?\n\nEvery new OS needs more RAM on its own than the older ones. That's because developers are always adding new features, which means they will need more RAM.\nSo yes, 1.5 GB RAM only for the system is absolutely normal, Windows 10 for example even needs 2 GB. \n\nI have always upgraded my Late 2008 Notebook to the most recent OS X version. Could it be that I experience some kind of bloat / fragmentation that is related to this?\n\nI don't think that the updates themselves are causing problems, but simply the newer systems aren't designed to run with only 4GB of RAM, which means that you have to think about always updating to the latest OS.\nOf course it will run, but maybe it needs to much resources if you want to run many programs at the same time. \n", "Q: How To Remove Individual Office 2016 for OS X Applications I have Office 2016 installed - Excel, Outlook, Power Point and Word.\nI want to remove Outlook 2016 and leave the rest.\nI want to leave no trace behind, a complete remove of Outlook as if I installed only the other 3.\nHow can I do that?\nWhat if I want to remove a different one?\nThank You.\n\nA: I have used AppCleaner and selected every Microsoft Product and then Select to be finished with Delete.\n", "Q: How do I find the Microsoft Word normal user template?

I can see a grayish area at the top right corner, near to the charge display. It's hard notice in full brightness, but noticeable in low brightness which annoys me a lot. I know it will be tough to make apple genius understand but still can't live with it. I want to replace my phone. Will this one be covered by warranty policy? I have a slight hairlike scratch on the display.\n\nA: The iPhone warranty in the US doesn't cover physical damage or cosmetic issues. The scratch will likely be judged that way unless it interferes with a function like multi touch.\nSimilarly, the return policy / window might be your best bet - especially if the LCD quality is clearly different than the rest of the display phones. Just because a light scratch happened - if there's a problem with the overall display, I would assume you'd be able to request an exchange / repair / warranty service to address the backlight and not the scratch.\nIf Apple's repair option fixes the scratch too, so be it - that's their issue and not yours IMO.\nLastly, get in sooner rather than later. Also, if you didn't buy the phone outright - be sure your carrier is OK issuing a second subsidy before returning the phone.\nSorry this isn't simple - but you've got multiple aspects to a repair/return to consider.\n\nA: If it's just a light scratch and the burn-in was there from day one, then Apple shouldn't have any reason not to exchange it for you.\n", "Q: Mac App Store apps without internet connection I want to set up a Mac running a recent version of OS X but I don't want it to be connected to the internet because of security reasons. Is it possible to copy and activate apps bought and installed from the App Store on an other computer to the one with no internet connection? I know that the App Store validates the license to install such apps and it actually needs an internet connection to do so. But maybe there is a kind of license key file that can also be coppied over to the air gapped box. \n\nA: YMMV. Every once in a while when the transferred app is opened for the first time, it will need to validate the Apple ID which the app was downloaded with, so most of the time it will work, but sometimes it won't.\n", "Q: Apps keep crashing after OS X update I've just updated my MBP 13'' mid 2010 to OS X 10.10.5 (14F27).\nI remember that the last update was iTunes 12.2.2.25.\nAfter this update, Mac rebooted and installed all the features.\nNow I'm unable to open a lot of applications because they always crash.\nI'm trying to figure out what is happening.\nI've already tried to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repair disk and disk permission.\n\n*Run OnyX to delete all the caches and indexes to rebuild them.\n\n\nNothing solved my issue.\nHere some crash reports: Safari, Dash, Mail, Dashboard, ClipMenu, Spotlight.\nIt seems that all this problem are related to web component.\nNow I'm posting this answer using Google Chrome on the same Mac, and it works fine.\nIn Safe Mode here is the crash report of Safari which quit unexpectedly while using WebCore plug-in.\n\nA: It seems that I've fixed it.\nI made this steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore /System/Library/Frameworks/WebKit.framework/ from a Time Machine backup.\n\n\n*\n\n*This fixed all the crashes but now is quite impossible to close Safari tabs or the program itself.\n\n\n*Reinstall OS X 10.10.5 update.

Both a Time Machine and a full clone of the disk will be in place, each on their own external hard disk.\nGoing from Mountain Lion to Yosemite in this upgrade. Should I try simply running the Yosemite installer as being suggested by the App Store app?\n\nA: To put it simply: yes, using the installer provided by the App Store is sufficient. Keep in mind that Apple develops and designs these installers specifically so that users, like you, can update to the newest system.\nAll you need to do is click the download button and follow the onscreen instructions to update.\nThere is always a risk factor of something going wrong; an obscure file missing, a .plist value out of whack, etc. The unfortunate truth is that there is always going to be potential human error.\nSomething to remember is that the error in question could come from something the new system added, rather than something the installer forgot to remove.\nUsing the installer is just a quick and easy way to update with a small chance of error. It adds new files and replaces outdated ones. If you wipe the system clean and freshly install a new one, there is still a small chance of error.\n\nA: “Lazy Man Works The Hardest”\nDo the clean install.\nI regret going the upgrade-upon-upgrade path. Many problems since. Just click my user account on this site to see my numerous questions about various problems. I suspect all of those are related to bugs and glitches and issues with doing layers of upgrades.\nJust spent hours today with two Google accounts in Mail.app. Neither account showed any folders in the sidebar. Worse, the \"Archive\" area of the side bar showed all the same messages as the \"Inbox\". Long story short, I disabled the accounts, re-enabled them, created a new \"ArchivedWithPurpose\" folder, and used the Mailbox > Use this mailbox as > Archive Mailbox menu item to designate a clean empty folder as the archive location. \nThis is one of many problems that would not occur in a clean install.\n", "Q: iPhone is dead, will not charge I have an iPhone 4s running on iOS 8.1.3.

I come back about 20 minutes later to see nothing had changed... I tried adjusting the cord, trying to power down the device, rebooting, safe mode, and just letting it sit without the cord and retrying to charge it. Nothing worked; the phone just kept blinking the red battery logo even of 1 entire day of charging. What is there to do?\n\nA: There are a few possible things that could have happened. I've ordered them (and their solutions) below from most to least likely.\nExplanations:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have a faulty cord.\n\n\n*\n\n*It has become frayed on the inside.\n\n*One of the metallic connectors is dirty.\n\n\n*Dust or dirt has collected in your charging port.\n\n*Your wall outlet is not functioning correctly.\n\n*You have a hardware problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your charging port has become disconnected internally.\n\n*Your battery is defective.\nMany of these cause your device not to charge. Thus, powering on your device does nothing.\nSolutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a new cord.\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually repair the wire by soldering the frayed ends together and using a heat-shrink to put everything back together. (You probably just want to buy a new cord.)\n\n*Clean the dirty connectors.\n\n\n*Clean out your charging port with a folded index card, toothpick, plastic card, etc.\n\n*Call an electrician.\n\n*Take your device in to get fixed.

When opening the PDF file in preview and Adobe Reader, the page numbers appear as they should, but when copied to an iOS device, the page numbers don't appear properly in iBooks or Adobe Reader for iOS, they just start at 1, 2, etc... \n\nA: I've finally found a solution that supports logical page numbers like the other PDF readers I have tried, but also respects custom page numbers embedded within the PDF. GoodReader shows the page numbers properly. It's $4.99\n\nA: How do you assume that there's something wrong with all PDF viewers you've tried so far? Maybe simply page numbers are incorrectly embedded in the document which then has been saved to PDF?\nIf that's true, then there's nothing wrong with the viewer itself. Simply your document should have all page numbers regenerated. If it originally comes from Word, try to correct page numbers there and save to PDF once again.

You just have to go to the correct spot.  Volumes mounted via Target Disk Mode can be found in /Volumes of the filesystem. \nThree common options:\n\n\n*\n\n*From Terminal.app (found in your Applications folder, under Utilities, you can navigate to the target mode machine starting in \"/Volumes\".

Possibly because Retina displays are nicer than the built in displays, one of these \"phantom displays\" automatically becomes the primary... meaning I do not see the prompt for login, and all my programs launch off-screen.\nI am able to recover the mouse using an actual mouse pointer. For some reason I cannot understand using the trackpad does not work... but a mouse will...  \nEventually I can change the primary screen and disable the monitors using some kludge code, but... it happens on every startup and the retina monitors my system believes exist are hogging resources to the point of lowering framerates to unusable whenever I hook up my modest external displays (19.5 at work or 24 inch at home). \nI've reset the SMC and PRAM... I've futzed with configurations available in the GUI (I think... although perhaps I missed something)... how do I deal with this? \nIf anybody can direct me to a means of shifting the primary display with hotkeys that would be a great first step so I can work on a day to day without 20 minutes of set up. \nIf anybody has a true fix or can at least tell me how to go about dealing with this methodically, I'd very much appreciate it! I've been to the apple store 2 times for 5 hours and received nothing better than a suggestion to do a wipe and clean install. I'm a developer, and have a lot of configuring I'd need to do post wipe... and I want to to understand why this broke, so that I can avoid doing it again. And I'm curious... and I don't think that should be the solution to problems! That's a broken system if that's how you fix quirks like that. It should be MUCH easier to tell the computer it doesn't have 3 giant 30 inch displays hooked into it. The damn machine can't even drive more than 2 displays with the internal GPU/Motherboard (despite the 3 outputs).\nI'm command line capable if you can direct me to the config files in etc or whatever that deal with the displays. I would love to learn how to deal with display issues in general with linux environments... \nA partial fix has included the use of a tool available in this repo: https://github.com/Eun/DisableMonitor\nA kludge little script owned by admin:root \n#!/bin/bash\n\n/Applications/DisableMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/DisableMonitor --disable `/Applications/DisableMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/DisableMonitor --list | grep Display\\ \\(1\\) | sed 's|Display (1)||g' | sed 's| ||g'`\n/Applications/DisableMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/DisableMonitor --disable `/Applications/DisableMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/DisableMonitor --list | grep Display\\ \\(2\\) | sed 's|Display (2)||g' | sed 's| ||g'`\n/Applications/DisableMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/DisableMonitor --disable `/Applications/DisableMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/DisableMonitor --list | grep Display\\ \\(3\\) | sed 's|Display (3)||g' | sed 's| ||g'`\n\nAnd another kludge plist named com.example.plist @ /Library/LaunchDaemons/\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.example.plist</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n          <string>/usr/bin/bash</string>\n          <string>/Applications/startup</string>\n        <array>\n        <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>KeepAlive</key>\n        <false/>\n        <key>SuccessfulExit</key>\n        <false/>\n    </dict>\n</plist>\n\nAddition, (one has to):\n    $sudo launchctl load -w example.plist \nHowever I still want a clean fix. And if anybody can help me maybe tidy up this code, which I'm not incredibly sure about... it would be appreciated. It works... but only after login. It'd be nice if it launched during the login window period... so i can see my name/etc. I have tried messing with the various folders and launchctl flags... no dice yet.\n\nA: This may not be a full fix.\nIn the Display setting. Click the Arrange Tab. You will see how the Screens are being arranged.\nThere you can adjust the layout. But more importantly you can drag the menu bar icon ( white line at the top of one display) across to the screen you want as primary.\nI would try that and see if you at least can get starting in at login.\nI would also look at maybe deleting the display prefs.\n", "Q: Drag and drop won't move ALL selected files between Finder windows Here's what I'm doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a Finder window with source directory (500+ files).\n\n*open another Finder window with target directory.\n\n*select all files in source directory using ⌘ - a\n\n*grab selected files and hover target window\n\n*press ⌘ so files are moved instead of copied\n\n*release mouse button\n\n\nBut only cca 85 files are moved. Rest is left in source directory (while still selected). The same happens when copying files.\nIs this something I can change (number of files moved)? An error/bug? Some app interfering with drag & drop behavior? I'm left with using Terminal to move my files, which besides being annoying isn't really possible when file selection is not a simple ⌘ - a.\n\nA: I know this is late but I've found a fix.\nFirst, open disk utility and run first aid on your disk. \nSecond, shutdown the computer fully and disconnect all USB devices.\nThird, Press the power button and hold command-option-p-r until the Mac reboots again. This will reset the PRAM. \nI hope this fixes your issue like it did for me!\n\nA: I found solution, in System Preferences -> Accessibility\n\n\nA: Bulk file & folder moves/copies using the Finder are more easily accomplished at the command line in Terminal. A benefit is that the process executes faster.\nThe mv and cp commands are what you need. Use wildcard file selection on the source side of the command, and create target paths from dragging the associated Finder icons into the Terminal window. Take a look at the myriad options available at man mv and man cp.\nIf you don't want to use Terminal, then move by enclosing the files in a folder you drag, and then burst the files out after the transfer on the target.\n", "Q: How to activate and run JavaScript in AppleScript? I'm trying to run simple script in AppleScript Editor on OS X 10.9.5, but using JavaScript, e.g.:\nvar SE = new Application(\"System Events\");\nSE.processes.windows.name()\n\nHowever my dropdown only shows AppleScript.\nHow do I activate JavaScript if it isn't appearing on the list? It is also not in Preferences/General.\n\nA: You cannot. JavaScript for Automation was only introduced in OS X 10.10 Yosemite.\nAppleScript Editor.app was also renamed to Script Editor.app due to it now not only being for AppleScript.\n", "Q: Snapping Preview windows with BetterTouchTool make search buggy I use BetterTouchTool in order to be able to maximise windows to half the screen by dragging them agains the edge of the screen. When I do this with Preview windows and then attempt to search in the document, the user interface gets messed up, so I have no Done button to get rid of the search results. See below gif for illustration. There should be a Done button at the upper right.\n\nCan anybody confirm this weirdness? Is this a BTT bug or can I do anything myself?\n\nA: If you uninstall this software does Preview behave?\nIt is likely an interaction with Preview and this software. And maybe something else on your system. I would suggest contacting support on this product directly.\n", "Q: Open second PDF file with hyperlink in first PDF file I have two PDF files:\n\n\n*\n\n*First PDF file has a content page \n\n*Second PDF is the relative data (30 pages)\n\n\nMy requirement is to be able to click on the first PDF document, on a hyperlink for it to be open in the second PDF file on a certain page and certain location on that page. (Page 15 half way on that specific page)\nBare in mind I am not using a server and everything will be done locally.\n\nA: One approach is to use Acrobat to add the links. When manually adding links, you specify the view to which the link points. With that, you can set the exact place where the linked to document opens.\nIf you have suitable software to create your \"second\" document, you can use Named Destinations, which can be used as target for the link.\n", "Q: ImageIdentify.com in running processes Looking at ActivityMonitor, I saw a strange process with a URL for a name:\n\nI went to that site, and yes it looks familiar I might have been there, once, a long time ago. Definitely not at the time that this process showed up, and even if I did - why would visiting a website trigger its own custom process?\n\nA: Whenever safari loads a tab a new container is created with the name of URL showing in the process list that's the intended behaviour, and the container goes away when the last web worker belonging to that container terminates. \nIf the tab is gone what your likely experiencing first is a unintended side effect of a naive standard conform implementation of web workers API where a tread is essentially independent of the DOM tree inside the tab and will continue until it exits or the browser session is closed, unless the browser is aware of orphaned web workers and kills them. \nOSX compounds this problem by not exiting sessions when the last safari window is closed, meaning that for most users the sessions last until reboot. \n", "Q: Set Finder arranging order by kind via Terminal I know I can easily do this via the Finder's toolbar but I'm currently writing a huge shell script that'll set my future Mac up exactly as I want.\nSo is there any command to do it like the one to set viewing style ?\n\nA: To set a default view style use:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder FXPreferredViewStyle icnv|Nlsv|clmv|Flwv\n\nwith:\nicnv: Icon View\nNlsv: List View\nclmv: Column View\nFlwv: Cover Flow View  \nTo enable this immediately (which probably is not relevant for your shell script) you have to kill the Finder with killall Finder. Some folders might have a different view style set already (via .DS_Store files) while installation. You have to remove those invisible files to adapt your preferred style.\nTo deal with the group/arrange/sort settings you have to use PlistBuddy and defaults. The relevant key/sub-keys are FXPreferredGroupBy and StandardViewSettings and therein IconViewSettings, ExtendedListViewSettings and ListViewSettings.\nExamples:\nArrange by application:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder FXPreferredGroupBy Application\n\nPossible values for defaults are none, date, name, kind, Date Added, Date Created, Application etc.\nArrange by kind:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :StandardViewSettings:IconViewSettings:arrangeBy kind\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\nSort by date added:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :StandardViewSettings:ExtendedListViewSettings:sortColumn dateAdded\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\nPossible values for PlistBuddy are  none, date, name, kind, dateAdded, dateCreated etc.  \nSome combinations of those settings (view style, arrange by, sort by) aren't possible or don't make much sense (depending on your OS).\n", "Q: How to get the PID of every window of every process? I'm using the following simple script:\ntell application \"System Events\" to get the title of every window of every process\n\nWhich works by printing titles of every window (the same with position).

I have MacBook Pro (2.3GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD - late 2013?) and Time Machine backups data via network to our internal OS X Server. But when Time Machine is running backups, my computer is completely frozen. Webpages are not loaded, Apple Mail doesn't load/show messages at all, etc. But my colleague doesn't have such problems with his MacBook with the same HW configuration. \nWhat could be wrong?\n\nA: I found an article that suggests some troubleshooting steps, I'll summarize it here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Test the drive: copy some files to find out if your read / write speeds are normal. This will help you rule out your internal or server drive.\n\n*Check the drive for errors: Again, you can check internal and server drives for errors (bad blocks, permission problems).\n\n*Run a general maintenance routine: you can follow the steps they propose here.\n\n*Back up in Safe Mode: reducing the system to a bare minimum may help in isolating the problem.\n\n*Uninstall or disable drive-monitoring or scanning utilities: Antivirus and other drive scanning software may get triggered by Time Machine activity.\n\n*Disable Spotlight: and check for other processes that may be scanning the disk permanently.\n\n\nThere are a couple of additional suggestions on the article, check it out if this steps do not solve your issue and for a full description of each step.\nAlso, your colleague may provide a good comparison for troubleshooting: you said your hardware is identical, so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the software setup the same? Any differences may point out the culprit.\n\n*If software setup is similar, testing hardware on both machines can give you comparison points. For instance, what happens if they use the same Time Machine destination?\n\n\nFinally, check the Activity Monitor prior to and while Time Machine is running, to single out resource hogs.\n", "Q: Bluetooth keyboard not working after update to Windows 10 I updated my (native) bootcamp instance to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1, but now the apple bluetooth keyboard doesn't seem to work anymore.

Is it possible for an old photo from gmail (like 6 years old) to be put into the photo stream after an update? A very old picture appeared in my photo stream and I don't know how it got there. \n\nA: Yes - software does have bugs from time to time. It also could be you unintentionally did it or that another device is signed into your iCloud and entered that photo intentionally.\n", "Q: My iPod Touch won't play some of my files I've been having trouble with my iPod Touch. I mostly use it for listening to podcasts, however not only will some of the files not play, some aren't even accessible. Where files should be, there is simply an icon with a silver musical note on a white background.\n\nA: If it's working now, it sounds like a software bug. I'd go ahead and update it iOS 6.1.6, the latest version that the 4th Gen iPod Touch supports.\n", "Q: Where does Safari Web Inspector store images?

Several months ago, I created a simple game using Unity 4.5 on an iMac running OS X Mavericks, and decided to try testing it on my iPhone 5s running iOS 7. I tested the game using the Unity Remote 4 app, and then closed out.\nNo longer interested in testing the game, I deleted Unity Remote a few days later. However, the game seems to have left some kind of \"ghost app\" behind on my phone — a blank app icon with my game's name that appears on my home screen. Upon tapping the icon, I am briefly presented with a black screen, and then returned to the home screen.\nThe app does not appear in Settings > General > Usage > Manage Storage.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting the app from the home screen. This does not work, as the icon re-appears after rebooting.\n\n*Using Xcode's Device view to delete the app. I was unable to do so due to \"an internal API error.\"\n\n*Restoring from backups, rebooting, and hard resetting (\"force restarting\"), but all to no avail.\nI would like to avoid a full reset of my phone as I have a large amount of data that isn't, and cannot be, backed up to iCloud or other cloud services.\nMy phone is currently running iOS 8.4.\n\nA: Use iTunes to sync all apps you want except that one.\n\nA: A guess would be to use other file managers out there like ifunbox (you might need to jailbreak, not very sure).

I'm thinking of getting the MacBook 12\" but I'm really scared I won't be able to get used to the keyboard. I'm in The Netherlands, it's not possible to return the product.\nHow long does it take to get used to the keyboard for people here and is there a really big difference once you're typing on it?\n\nA: If you can, go to your local Best Buy or Apple Store and check it out. I've only used one at Best Buy, but I think that I'd get used to it pretty quickly. Everyone is different, so YMMV. Just make sure you can return it if you just can't get used to it.\n\nA: I personally started typing as fast as I would on a 'normal' keyboard after about five minutes. You'll really get used to it in a very short time!\n\nA: I've owned the Macbook 12\" for several months and I'm still not used to the keyboard. I'm a seasoned touch typist but there are keys I keep missing, and some keys that were initially not fully responding on all edges and required some continual tapping to get them fully working. the lower right corner of the spacebar has inconsistent response.\nThe result is that typing feels like a bit of a chore. I've tried positioning my hands in a more extended manner which seem to help a bit. Bottom line is that I prefer the older keyboard style and actually continue to miss my Macbook 11\" even though the screen and resolution options are so much better with the Macbook 12\". \n", "Q: is there an easier way to set PRAM? I was trying to solve a stupid nagging problem (doesn't matter what at this point!) on my iMac (mid 2011), and one of the things that kept popping up is resetting PRAM. I have done this many times (over the years) and it is always a frustrating task (and getting harder as my coordination gets worse.) as I have hand/finger difficulties. One hand (the right) is cramped and mostly useless while the other is somewhat shaky. This combined with trouble with eye/hand coordination makes hitting the command + option + p + r at just the right time and all the way through the boot process very difficult for me. I would love to be able to set a keyboard shortcut to do that but don't think it is possible. If I could use one hand (the LEFT) to do that it would be great. I have looked in System Preferences under Keyboard and Accessibility as well as Googled but an easier solution has not revealed itself.

Somehow pull the data before Restoring/Updating?\nHELP!\n\nA: I heard that Jailbreaking it may work, it's probably your only option to salvage the data on the iPad. Normally, I would never even suggest Jailbreaking, but in this case, it's probably your only option. I've never done it and have no interest whatsoever in Jailbreaking, so I can't tell how to do it, what to use, or even if it will for sure work, but it's worth a try.\n\nA: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204306\nJailbreaking is unlikely to help in this case.\nWhen you have entered the passcode incorrectly 10 times, the device becomes completely disabled.  Prior to this, you can sometimes connect the device to iTunes and have iTunes reset the passcode lock counter so that you can try again, however, once the 10th incorrect entry has been made, your device will be permanently locked, and will only be able to be used if the device is erased to factory settings in iTunes.\nThe unfortunate thing is that there is no way to recover the data on the device once it has been activation locked.  If the device was signed into iCloud, you may be able to recover things such as contacts, photos, calendars, and messages, if the sync option was enabled for these items. Quite often, you will find much of the data you are most concerned about is also scattered across other services, such as email, social media, and other cloud storage services if you have made use of such things.\nIf the device was backed up to either iCloud or iTunes, you may be able to restore the backup, and assuming your passcode attempts were made accidentally (or by curious children) you might attempt to access the device again with all of your data if you can remember the passcode stored in the backup.\n", "Q: Skip OSX Beta Update From reading some comments, it looks like OS X 10.11 \"El Capitan\" Beta 3 breaks some aspects of Java that work in Beta 2. Is there a way to skip Beta 3, but still be notified when Beta 4 comes out, i.e. not opt out of the beta program?\n\nA: Yes. You get prompted to install each build, so don't click for beta 3. Once 4 arrives, you'll likely have to first jump to 3 and then jump to 4. \nThis is documented at http://openradar.appspot.com/22307567\nYour comment about not opting out is also confusing - I'm not sure how that relates to your ability to choose whether to install a specific update. \n\nA: You should just be able to install Beta 4 when it comes out. I don't think you have to be running Beta 3 in order to install it.\n", "Q: Using osacript to access Finder from crontab (or from non-interactive session) I have a script that generates a dmg file from my application bundle. This is generated every night from our subversion repository.\nIf would be interesting to set up things like the DMG's window size, background image, etc, directly from the script. Currently the only way I know to do so is using osascript and calling Finder's applescript functionality. \nThe problem is that this script is ran from crontab, so there is no graphical session open - obviously it will never find a Finder open.\nI copied this snippet from here: http://asmaloney.com/2013/07/howto/packaging-a-mac-os-x-application-using-a-dmg/\n# tell the Finder to resize the window, set the background,\n#  change the icon size, place the icons in the right position, etc.\necho '\n   tell application \"Finder\"\n     tell disk \"'${VOL_NAME}'\"\n           open\n           set current view of container window to icon view\n           set toolbar visible of container window to false\n           set statusbar visible of container window to false\n           set the bounds of container window to {400, 100, 920, 440}\n           set viewOptions to the icon view options of container window\n           set arrangement of viewOptions to not arranged\n           set icon size of viewOptions to 72\n           set background picture of viewOptions to file \".background:'${DMG_BACKGROUND_IMG}'\"\n           set position of item \"'${APP_NAME}'.app\" of container window to {160, 205}\n           set position of item \"Applications\" of container window to {360, 205}\n           close\n           open\n           update without registering applications\n           delay 2\n     end tell\n   end tell\n' | osascript\n\nSo, is there a way to launch finder without an active graphical session open (that is, someone logged in the machine)? Or is there a way to perform the same, without using applescript and Finder?\n\nA: The following page describes the process of creating a template, including background, views, etc, and then using a Makefile to update the DMG package with new files anytime you need to. It doesn't use Finder so it should work for batch updates.\nhttps://el-tramo.be/guides/fancy-dmg/\n", "Q: Finder is showing many files which I have deleted I have an Xcode project which I just deleted so I could rewrite it.

But I would still like to know WHY it happened.\n\nA: I had the same problem and I solved it by relaunching Finder. Here's how I relaunched Finder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold the ⌥ (alt/option) key on your keyboard\n\n*Right click on the Finder icon in your Dock\n\n*click Relaunch\n\n\nHere's a youtube video elaborately showing how to relaunch Finder.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Did you definitely use the command line to delete the folder?\nOne behaviour that has struck me as strange a few times on OS X is that if you are working in a folder in the Terminal but then delete it in the Finder, you can continue to work with the folder perfectly happily in the Terminal. Even in it's new home within the Trash.\nIf you try to open the Trash in the Finder and access anything in there you'll just get an error, but within Terminal you are able to work with the same files quite happily. You can even launch them from there and continue to work with them in other applications perfectly happily (for example opening a txt file in TextWrangler).\nAlso if you type \"open .\" in the Terminal it will open the folder in a Finder window and everything will look okay right up until the point you try open a file at which point the Finder will tell you \"The document XXX can't be opened because it's in the Trash.\"\nTo make things even stranger, even though other applications will identify the path to the folder and its contents as ~/.Trash/foldername, if you type pwd in the Terminal it will still think it's at the previous location.\nIf you hadn't rebooted I would have suggested right-clicking on the window title to see if the folder in the Finder window is where you though it was. But now that you've rebooted... :)\n", "Q: Import photos from external disk into iCloud Photo Library via MacBook Air with not enough HD space I have 60 GB of photos on an external hard disk.\nI also have a MacBook Air with an empty iPhoto app. The MacBook has 15 gigs left of HD space.\nCan I import these photos directly into the iCloud Photo Library?\nI can only find articles which explain how to upload your complete library to iCloud, after which it starts optimising for storage. However I don't have enough space to fit all  my photos on the internal hard disk.\n\nA: First, you will have to update to Photos app on OS X, as iPhoto is not compatible with iCloud Photo Library.\nActivate iCloud Photo Library and subscribe a storage plan that accommodates your pictures and anything else you have there (iOS Backups, for instance). Select the \"Optimize Mac Storage\" on the Photos app Preferences > iCloud pane. \nThen import batches of 10 GB or so of your pictures to the empty Photos app library; given you will have only 5 GB left I assume it will start optimizing right away. When you regain some space, you can add another batch.\n\nA: My work around is:\n - Add an extra user on an apple mini we have which has enough space. \n - Add the user's iCloud credentials there. \n - Start Photos app and enable iCloud photo library\n - Import everything\n\nAfter importing turn on iCloud photo library on the macbook air (optimised) and voila.\nOf course, this solution only works when you have a spare Apple computer with enough harddisk space.\nNow that I think about it, this solution might also have worked with adding a new user to the macbook air, attach an external disk, make the photos app store it's library on the external disk and go through the same motions. If that actually works, I don't know. But might be worth a try for someone else having the same problem\nI won't tag this solution as 'accepted' since it too is a work-around.\n\nA: There is another way to get around this, if you are ok with having your Photo Library on the external disk too. \nRequirements: \n\n\n*\n\n*External HDD (Formatted in HFS+ or Journal) and connected directly (network storage doesn't work).\n\n*Photos App\n\n\nOpen Photos App, this will create a Photo Library in your Pictures folder.\nClose Photos App.\nMove the Photo Library to external disk\nOpen Photos App, and when shows an error for missing library, select the old library which is now moved to the external disk.\nGo to Photos->Preferences->Set the library as Primary\nEnable iCloud Photo Sharing, Optimise for Mac storage\nImport Photos \n", "Q: Link to App-Store Webpage Without App Redirect I have an app in the app store and I'm trying to link to it on my webpage.  I've got the link working on any standard browser, but when I open the website in WeChat and use the link, it does nothing.  This problem is not occuring on my Android device, only on iOS.  So I think what's happening is iOS thinks that the link is an ad and won't allow the page to open the app store.\nI've tried just plain old http://itunes.com/apps/appname, but this seems to attempt a redirect as well.\nSo is there a way to link a user to the app store without opening the app-store app?\n\nA: I prefer smart app banners for the best mobile safari experience.\nHave a look at https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/PromotingAppswithAppBanners/PromotingAppswithAppBanners.html\nBasically you insert code in the header area:\n<meta name=\"apple-itunes-app\" content=\"app-id=myAppStoreID, affiliate-data=myAffiliateData, app-argument=myURL\">\n\n", "Q: How do I get the photos off my iPhone to my Windows PC without using iCloud?

I have two partitions, one is HFS+ and the other is exFAT.\nI'm used to opening the /etc/fstab file, and inserting this line:\nUUID=NUMBER none hfs rw,noauto\n\nNote: The \"hfs\" stands for HFS+.\nNow I want to automatically unmount the exFAT volume. I tried this:\nUUID=NUMBER none msdos rw,noauto\n\nSo, my question is; which keyword should I use for unmounting an\nexFAT volume/partition?\n\nA: As a test, I formatted and external USB drive as exFAT (wrongly shown as ExFAT in Disk Utility) and then ascertained its UUID. Then ejected and unplugged the disk.\nI then added the following to my /etc/fstab file:\nUUID=402894E4-03EE-3CF7-80D2-A4EC74048C2F none exfat rw,noauto\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: Use the UUID assigned to the exFAT partition on your device.\n\n\nThese methods also work:\nLABEL=VolumeName none exfat rw,noauto\n\nIf the volume name has space characters, then in place of any space put: \\040\nLABEL=Volume\\040Name none exfat rw,noauto\n\nWhen I plugged the USB drive back in it did not mount, as expected, and was available in Disk Utility to mount when wanted.\nThis should also work with an exFAT partition on an internal disk as well.\n", "Q: Does online gaming use data? Does online gaming use up my data allowances? I am constantly running low on data, and I'm wondering if gaming is the contributor.\n\nA: The newer iOS versions let you track the cellular data used by each app.\nOpen Settings and then go to Cellular and then swipe up:\n\nYou can reset the counter if you need to track one day's usage, and you can also disable cellular data for the game in question, if you just want to cut it off when you aren't on Wi-Fi.\nGenerally, most games are quite miserly with data, but I suppose some free-to-play games are tracking everything or downloading levels constantly. It really depends on the game in question.\n\nA: As has been said, go to Settings > Cellular to find it out for yourself, but let me also actually answer your question as the other two answers barely touch on that:\n\n\n*\n\n*All online games obviously use mobile data, otherwise they couldn't be 'online'\n\n*If the game includes ads it will use a fairly significant amount of data. (Back when I only had a couple hundred mb per month this was reason enough for me to buy the ad-free version of a game I played)\n\n*If the game is literally live, as in, you can see other players move in real time or similar things then it will also use a fair amount of data often. FPS games are good examples of this.\n\n*All other games tend to use relatively little mobile data, but there can be exceptions, in which case it's useful to use the build in monitoring tools.\n\n\nA: Yes of course it uses data. How else do you think it communicates with the server and keeps things synchronized?\nI think the real question is how much data does it use. \n\nA: Go to Settings > Cellular and scroll down. There should be a breakdown of Cellular Data used by app.\nIf you didn't know this option was there, then you likely will not have reset it, so it will represent all of the cellular data you have used from when you first added your id to the device. \nThat being said it should give you an idea of what apps are the big cellular data users.\nIt also gives you the option to switch off cellular data usage on a per app basis, so that you can control which apps get to use the cellular data stream and which have to wait until your device is connected to Wi-Fi.\n\nA: Tautology, right? \nIf online game does not use data (network connection), it is offline game, isn't it? \n", "Q: Disk utility unable to change partition type I'm trying to copy a .img disk image to a microSD.

There's a count badge on the right side of the folder name.\nHow do I get rid of the counter for the \"Flagged\" folder? Am I suppose to de-flag all messages or delete them? Am I using the Flagged folder in a wrong way?\n\nA: Stars on Gmail are flags on Mail app. You can go ahead and remove the flags if you wish; the Flagged folder is a smart folder and removing the flags or stars will empty it. Or you can just leave them there, it depends on what you used Stars for. \nI wouldn't delete them though; while usually items in folders are just tags in Gmail, I'm not sure if deleting mail in folders will result in just removing the tag and keeping other copies on their folders, or deleting them for good; it will probably depend on your settings.\n", "Q: iPad Air 2 Data Transfer I recently purchased a new iPad Air 2.

I have turned OFF the Continuous Scan... just in case this was causing the problem.)\n\nA: A couple of side suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are paying for cloud service, so you should have paid support from Adobe if you can't solve this quickly. They should have an article explaining exactly what ports need to be open for your firewall.\n\n*You could disable the firewall for a short test to rule that in/out as cause of your issues.\n\n\nIf you want to go this alone, enable logging in the firewall and make a new user account. Open the CC Desktop app in the new user and attempt to sign in with your Adobe ID.\nThis will test system settings and the app. It will check your ID is active and get you firewall data if you are blocking a needed port. It will also separate the system from your main user settings so you can narrow the cause.\n", "Q: OSX Yosemite upgrade error: \"a mismatch between the MBR and GPT partition maps...\" My MBP's HDD is half OSX and the other half is Bootcamp. \nWhile booted into OSX I decided to let Software Update install Yosemite.

(has the existing OSX installation been destroyed by the upgrade yet?)\nI found another post in this form, by @AndyD273, where it looks like a proposed solution exists but I do not know how to get from this endless loop state into the position where I can download, much less install, gdisk and use Terminal (and I cannot ask via comment in that post because I lack the \"reputation\").

This partition still exists and has the original contents but it is not bootable. \n\nIf this were a Windows laptop there'd be several tools available to fix this boot corruption. But I know nothing about fixing this in the Mac/OSX realm. Forum posts like this, this, and especially this might contain a fix but over the several-page span of each thread the \"answers\" appear to change and ultimately not even work for the OP and/or others. My reading also suggests that it's common for Yosemite upgrades to corrupt a Bootcamp installation. If that's the case surely there's a tool or single consistent slam dunk solution for correcting this problem.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13' Power cord I use a 6 outlet adapter on my wall outlet. Since it's on the wall, it gets loose sometimes. This morning I pushed it in, while my power cord was plugged into it and the the power cord was plugged into my computer. There was a 'short' where I blew a fuse, and it sparked. I immediately unplugged my computer. My computer is working fine, but I'm afraid to use the power cord now. Is it still good? Can I hurt my computer? \n\nA: If the computer's working fine, then the electrical event that occurred either didn't damage the computer, or only damaged the charging circuitry.\nI wouldn't try using the adapter again. If you do, there's a high likelihood that it will trip another circuit breaker/blow a fuse, or it may not do anything at all. I think it's very unlikely in either case that it will charge your computer again.\nIf the adapter is an Apple adapter, take it back to an Apple Store, they'll most likely replace it on the spot. If it's an aftermarket adapter, get an Apple adapter, I've never had an Apple one malfunction. \nI'm not a licensed electrician, but I do know my way around electricity/electrics.

This should give you additional space on disk4, so long as you erase the files that have been added to the compressed zip file. You can either use Compress Files in Finder or zip in Terminal.\nUPDATE\nWhile this does not address rsync directly, this is another option that you may consider.\nIf this is solely a backup, and you are not actively using the data on disk4, i.e. it would only be used to restore lost data, or recover incremental data, then I would say try CrashPlan by Code42. The software is free and you do not need to buy their premium cloud backup services to use the local backup functionality. The only thing is that without the premium plan, I do not think that they unlock the ability to set the backup schedule for local backup. They do however give you a thirty-day free trial for the premium service, so you can determine how important having control over the backup schedule is. \nIt works very well, and is very light on resource utilization, so you won't know it is there. I in fact view it as a flaw in the software, as they are only addressing a single core of multicore processors, which can extend initial back up times. You have control over how much you allow CrashPlan to use your systems resources. \nThe benefit is that it significantly compresses the data to the backup drive, depending obviously on the data you are backing up. While you cannot use the information directly from Finder, the GUI lets you see the file structure and you can easily restore a single file or the entire disk. \n\nA: Most (if not all) hard drives have bad areas on the disk. It is the nature of the medium that something that small cant be 100% perfect. So HD manufacturers build in code in the drive firmware to \"map out\" bad areas of the drive. Because of that two identical drives from the same manufacturer will have just slightly differing amounts of actual available space on them. \nThis is normal, accepted and quite common.\nWhen purchasing drives it is wise to take this into account and select drives that are a bit bigger than you need to avoid running out of space, especially in conditions where the source drive is nearly full and the destination is the same rated size.\n", "Q: How to change file names in different folders? I have lots of files with identical name, say \"hello.jpg\".\nThey are located in many folders, say\n\\aaa\\hello.jpg\n\\bbb\\hello.jpg\n\\adaage\\hello.jpg\n\nI want to change their name to \n\\aaa\\aaa_hello.jpg\n\\bbb\\bbb_hello.jpg\n...\n\nHow can I accomplish this?\n\nA: You can run this command in Terminal:\nfind . -name hello.jpg -exec bash -c 'mv \"$1\" \"${1%/*}\"/\"$(echo $(dirname \"$1\")_$(basename \"$1\"))\"' -- {} \\;\n\nThis will find all hello.jpg files inside directories and prepend dir name in front of the filename.

You will there be able to edit the file.\nIf you want to edit the file in older versions of Pages, download the file as a Word (I know, right!) document then open that in your version of Pages.  Some formatting my be lost, but you can at least now work with the file locally.\nConversely, your colleague could send you the file already as a Word document for you to open in Pages for editing.\n\n", "Q: How can I tell if an email from Apple is genuine? I keep getting asked to verify my identity How can I tell if an email from Apple is genuine. Have had 2 asking me to verify my identity\n\nA: The from email address can be anything, so that means this can be anyone.\nTo tell if it is really them:\n\n\n*\n\n*View the full header of the email. Open Mail, open the email, press Cmnd+Shift+H to view the header, look where it came from, obviously you wanna look for apple.com, anything else is most likely fake. Here is part of an example of a legitimate Apple header:\n\n\n\nsmtp.mailfrom=new_ndt_bounces@applemusic.com; dkim=pass (identity\n  alignment result is pass and alignment mode is relaxed)\n  header.d=applemusic.com; x-hmca=pass header.id=new@applemusic.com\n\n\n\n*See where the link goes. Right click on their \"Verify\" link, paste it in a text editor and verify if you see any apple.com domains in this link, if not it is most likely fake. If it's a shortened URL, verify it first at Expand URL then check for Apple domains again.\n\n\nA: Without seeing the headers of the email and knowing whether you requested verification email immediately before it was sent, here's what I would do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not click any link in the email\n\n*Open a new browser window and type the company address and navigate to the service that needs verification (iCloud or AppleID or developer account or music/book sales account or ...)\n\n*If you can't find the verification section with some 5 minutes of trying, call the company on he phone for guidance. \n\n\nThe time it will take for you to recover your account if you end up getting phished is far far greater than the time you will take to make sure you have a legitimate email before clicking on the link.\nResources include:\n- https://www.apple.com/support/security/\n- https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/phishing/\n\nA: You can verify the email address where the mail came from. It should be something like XXX@apple.com or XXX@XXX.apple.com (where xxx could be different but the domain always has to end with apple.com)\nYou could also check the used vocabulary, if there are any mistakes it's not genuine.\nIf I remember correctly, als mails from apple also include an apple logo somewhere in a corner.\nIf you still don't trust the email you could contact apple care to see if the email is correct. The Apple Care number for your country can be found here.\nIf the mail you have is a phishing mail, please don't forget to report it by forwarding it to reportphishing@apple.com, according to this link.\n", "Q: If I sign a JAR with a certificate from Comodo, will I still get warnings? I have written a piece of software in Java that I would like to sell, however it is currently unsigned. When I first wrote the software it didn't matter too much, but I think OS X has upgraded since then and has gotten more strict as have web browsers and I'm now getting lots of warnings to say the file \"is not commonly downloaded and may be dangerous\" and OS X will not allow the app to run without changing security settings.\nFrom what I can gather the only way to address this is to sign the application, which is fine for Windows however on OS X I'm a bit confused. I've read online that now only certificates issued by Apple are valid, but some companies like DigiCert are still advertising that there code signing certificates work on Mac and pretty much all say that they work with Java. So, if I signed my JAR files with a code signing certificate from Comodo and then used JarBundler to create an app, would it be recognized as 'safe'?\n\nA: After biting the bullet and purchasing a code signing certificate, I can now answer my own question with all certainty:\nShort answer: No, the warnings don't go on OS X - although they do in web browsers.\nLong(er) answer: Technically certificates from Comodo or any other certificate authority that is trusted do work on Mac and you can absolutely sign .apps with them, however how useful this is another matter. I suppose that for more advanced users it is still beneficial in that you can verify whether or not an application has been tampered with, but Apple still won't see it as being from a trusted developer - and that's where the confusion starts.\nThe warnings that I mentioned in my original question originate from Gatekeeper. Now, if I would have known that I wouldn't have needed to start this question but I guess if I didn't know other people won't either. Anyway Gatekeeper is something that Apple have designed to keep Mac's safe and to avoid unwanted, malicious software from entering the system. It does this by restricting what apps can be executed based upon their origin, and by default in OS X Mountain Lion and later Gatekeeper only allows the execution of Apps from the Mac App Store and trusted developers.\nTo become a trusted developer however, it takes more than just signing code with any old certificate. Trusted developers have Developer ID's, given to them by Apple, and their code signing certificate contains this Developer ID; again the only certificates to be able to hold a Developer ID are those issued by Apple.\nSo, when people tell you that Apple only trust themselves, that's not true. They trust certificates issued by most certificate authorities just not in the same way as Windows and signing you app does not mean you're a trusted developer. For that, you have to pay Apple $99/year.\nIn all fairness, you do get a lot for that $99 and it does make some sense for it to be this way. It's frustrating for developers, but  safer for users! Users can bypass Gatekeeper for individual apps, so if you're only planning on releasing one app for OS X or something then perhaps providing instructions on how to this might be a better option for you.\nPS: After a lot of emails to the Comodo support team, I finally received this statement from them to confirm all of this:\n\nWhile our certificates work perfectly fine with signing .app files, it\n  does not give you an Apple Developer ID to designate that you are an\n  Identified Developer by Apple, as only Apple provides developer IDs\n  for Mac and iOS applications.\n\n\nA: Your JAR files will be considered as Safe once you sign it using Comodo Code Signing Certificate.\nComodo Code Signing Certificate is compatible with Mac OS, Linux, Windows, so you will not get any warning or alert message in your OS X.\nThis article will help you to understand how Comodo Code Signing certificate secure .Jar files - https://support.comodo.com/index.php?/Default/Knowledgebase/Article/View/531/7/signing-jar-files\n", "Q: How to remove top and bottom lines from a file using sed, awk, etc. in 1 step I want to chop the top 13 and the last 6 lines from a file\nThere are several answers on unix/linux but they aren't working for me as the sed options used aren't available on osx, tac isn't available, etc.\nSi I am posting here for a q&a that is specific to osx\nRight now I am using\n$ cat myfile | tail -n+14 | sed '$d' | sed '$d' | sed '$d' | sed '$d' | sed '$d' | sed '$d'\n\nbut am looking for a shorter '1 step at the end' way.\n\nA: You can do it all with tail\ntail -n+14 FILE | tail -r | tail -n+7 | tail -r\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The first tail removes the top 13 lines\n\n*The second tail reverses the line order\n\n*The third tail removes the top 6 lines of the reversed order\n\n*The last tail reverses the line order again\n\n\nor with awk (with inspiration from patrix)\nawk -v n=\"$(wc -l FILE)\" 'NR > 13 && NR < (n-6+1)' FILE\n\n\nA: Try this way:\nsed '1,13d' filename | head -n -6\n\nThe sed command can be used to delete a range of lines.

I never used the iCloud to back up my playlist and thought that I was backing up my playlist properly on an external hard drive. Turns out that I never backed up my playlist properly. I lost everything! So, I  painstakingly loaded all of my CDs into my playlist on my PC. I also went through the trouble of eliminating duplicate songs, which I had never done before. I still have my previous playlist on my iPhone and iPod. Since I am so ignorant when it comes to this stuff, I didn't know if I could have backed up either my iPhone or iPod to the PC playlist instead of importing all of my CDs again to the PC playlist. So, I went through the agony of importing the CDs. I actually have no knowledge on how iTunes playlists work. Now that I went through the trouble of importing all of my CDs again and eliminated the duplicate songs.\n\n\n*\n\n*if I plug my iPhone into the tower and sync and backup my iPhone, will the syncing replace my new PC playlist with my iPhone playlist?\n\n*And, will the syncing also put songs and albums that are on my iPhone, but not on my PC playlist, from my iPhone to my PC playlist. \n\n\nA: Your iOS device only syncs with 1 computer, if you gonna sync on a new computer, your music on your iOS device will be replaced with what's in your iTunes Library on computer.\nYou can't sync FROM your iOS device to computer, because of copyright reasons, eg. I buy music and sync them for all my friends' computers. That's a no-no! :P\n\nA: I would say, you can simplify things greatly by just focusing on the PC for a bit.\nThe process to back up and restore your iTunes library is at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201625\nYou can optionally back up all the playlist information (which can be used to import a playlist, but doesn't save the files themselves) if you make a hot new playlist mix that you don't want to lose but you don't have lots of new content in the library.\nOnce you have your PC set - you can decide if you want to keep your backups local or if you can use iTunes Match or Apple Music to back things up to Apple's cloud.\nWhen that is clear - you can look at each iOS device to transfer any content back to the library. Unless you use a subscription Match/Music - playlists created on the iOS device don't sync back unless you have automatic syncing enabled in my experience. There are thirt party tools to help with this too, but the Apple/iTunes only solution is to do the work on iTunes and push/sync it to the iOS devices. One way transmission.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quite possibly - the new iTunes library wants to wipe the old iOS info and start over.\n\n*No - you want to disable syncing and then \"transfer\" songs back. You will need to write down the playlists on paper and re-implement them when they get cleared in the next sync.\n\n", "Q: How can I put my iPhone 4 in DFU Mode if the Home button is broken and it is turned off? So basically I have a tethered reboot iOS 6.1.4 on my iPhone 4. Recently the Home button broke and now I'm unable to put it into DFU Mode to turn it on. Is there a way I can put it in DFU Mode, or maybe get iTunes to install the latest iOS on it? I just need it to turn on again so I can listen to music.\n\nA: If the home button is non-functional, and the device requires a working home button to even power up, then it seems you're in a chicken-egg situation.  There is of course software that lets you remap some other button or UI action to correspond to the home button, but if you can't get the thing turned on you're out of that realm.\nI suppose you could open it up and try shorting the contacts of the home button assembly, but once you're that far into it you may as well just replace the home button or the front panel.  The home button replacement part is only a few bucks, and the whole front panel is under $20 [in the US].\n\nA: Repair the home button seems the cheapest solution.\nWith the digitizer working, OS working and you have accessibility enabled, you could use software to simulate a home button press.\nWith root ssh access, you might have other avenues due to being jailbroken, but for most people, needing DFU and a broken home button is game over - get a new device time.\n", "Q: multiple dropbox instances hangs in starting loop So I have recently installed two separate concurrent instances of dropbox on Mavericks. There are plenty of scripts on the web (all roughly the same) that seem to lead to a common issue, specifically for Mavericks. After the second instance is started via this script:\nHOME=$HOME/Dropbox-second /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox &\n\nit hangs in a constant state of 'starting.' I have looked around quite a bit and can't seem to come up with a solution. Any ideas or leads would be greatly appreciated.\nIn response to comments: \nIdeally, the solution would function for the same user account of the computer. The idea is that two separate Dropbox accounts be available and usable at the same time. I do understand Dropbox doesn't support this functionality, hence the reason for the question. It is a workaround solution that I'm after. Additionally, the script cited above does work in other versions of osx, so again I'm asking for solutions to regain functionality in Mavericks specifically. Thanks for your help. \n\nA: Personal Dropbox does not work in this fashion, as it causes open preference file conflicts, thus the hang on the startup of the second instance. You must login and logout of each personal Dropbox account to use them individually, or used shared folders for common files. You can also have two Dropbox accounts open in different web browser windows.\nIf you are a Dropbox for Business user, you can have personal and Business accounts sync to single devices, which is what you may be looking for.\n\nA: I believe OP has two separate Dropbox accounts and wants to have both running simultaneously. This means running two instances of Dropbox. Dropbox themselves do not support this (why should they?) so there are various workarounds. \nI used a similar script (run in bash shell) to OP's for several years on Snow Leopard without any issues:\nHOME=$HOME/Dropbox_secondary /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n\nWhen I upgraded to Mavericks a while ago, I started to notice Dropbox files were not syncing. That's when I discovered the same problem as OP. One Dropbox instance will launch and sync just fine, but the the second instance gets stuck in the 'Starting...' phase. Forever.\nThe instance that hangs sometimes changes when I restart my Macbook. By this I mean that sometimes it's the 'Dropbox_secondary' folder and other times it's the 'default' Dropbox folder, i.e., the original one that I first set up.\nI also cannot find a solution to this. Most sites post the same script as OP and I have given as examples. It seems as though something in Mavericks is stopping it from working, but nobody knows what.\n", "Q: Kernel panic - Macbook pro 15\" early 2011 I have problem with \"Your computer restarted because of a problem\" loop.

discrete graphics was damaged; this is a frequent issue with those machines.\nHowever, I found out that if I force the Mac to use only the AMD discrete graphics, then the problem does not occur anymore. It might be, therefore, an issue with the integrated Intel HD 3000 graphics; perhaps a software issue after the upgrade to El Capitan 10.11.4\nWaiting for Apple to fix the software, I suggest the following remedy\n\n\n*\n\n*In System Preferences -> Energy Saver\n\n*Uncheck the Automatic Graphics Switching option.\nThis will force the Mac to use the AMD graphics. I'd love to know if this solves your problem.\nIf this does not work for you, or even leads to more frequent panics, then the AMD discrete GPU might be damaged. In this case, please note that Apple has active a free repair programme for 2011 Mac having this specific issue, see\nhttp://www.macrumors.com/2016/02/19/apple-extends-mbp-video-repair-program/\nHope it helps!\n\nA: The kernel extensions in backtrace (look in your dump) point to (possibly) a graphics issue. It could be a damaged driver or you could be having problems with the graphics hardware itself.\nThe fact that it happens intermittently may point to the latter but diagnosing this long distance... well no guarantees.\nPitr Pitucha left a comment that leads (just) to a link. A link to apple hardware diagnostics. Tho a bit terse his recommendation is sound as the Diagnostics may (eventually) point to where the problem is.\nI would run it once a day for a week when you have time to do so and see if you can catch it in action.\nFailing that, reinstalling the O/S (and then the updates) might be a good idea as that will overwrite any possibly corrupted drivers or config files. Do back up first tho... \n", "Q: Clean boot to Windows when using Boot Camp I was experiencing issues trying to update Windows 7 to SP1, and according to Windows Support I should do a 'clean boot' to Windows. My issue is that I'm running Windows on my 2009 MacBook, through Boot Camp. While following the steps they provided me, How to perform a clean boot in Windows, I noticed that when disabling services I'll be disabling drivers that I think are necessary for Windows to function on my Mac.\n\nWill booting with these services disabled affect booting/not allow me to boot to Windows and/or OS X?\n\nA: I would do as the KB Article suggests.  If there is an issue you can always boot to Safe Mode and reenable the disabled Drivers, Services, etc.\nThat said, keep in mind that when first installing Windows via the Boot Camp Assistant that Windows on Boot Camp installs and first runs without any Boot Camp Drivers installed.  So, I see no issues with disabling any and all non-Microsoft Drivers, Services, etc. in order to troubleshoot an issue or clean boot Windows.\nEdit: I should have also said, I have done this numerous times, in the past, on PC's as well as Mac's and was never not able to boot because of disabling non-Microsoft Drivers, Services, etc.\n", "Q: Remove number from iMessage to use on non iPhone I had an iPhone and I used iMessage on it. I didn't mind getting some of the messages to my laptop. But recently I switched back to a very old phone I had that is not a smart phone. Now I am receiving some texts to my laptop and not to my phone at all! This is frustrating because I don't want to have to check my laptop and my phone for messages.  \nI would like to change this so that I only receive messages to my phone, not my laptop, because I don't even have an iPhone anymore.\n\nA: If you are using the same number that you had on your iPhone and registered with iMessage, you need to remove it from the service to be able to receive normal SMS messages from iMessage users on your new, non-Apple phone.\nPlease go to Deregister iMessage and follow the steps described on the page.\n", "Q: The work E-mail address you entered is already associated with a different Apple ID.

Please, try a different Work E-mail\n\nI am using a Windows 7 machine to do this and have tried various browsers.\n\nA: You have two options if your company has no prior VPP set up. \n\n\n*\n\n*Choose a different email string to register.\n\n*Log in to the email you wish to use at http://appleid.apple.com and change the ID/email to get off the one you wish to use for VPP.\n\n\nThe VPP portal does things to the AppleID you enroll that isn't handled/allowed for pre-existing accounts. Unless you can substitute a new email for the one you want, you're really bound to choose a new account.\nNow, if you are trying to register a second VPP you will run into many different problems. First exhaust internal measures to recover that account or work with the holder of that AppleID. \nIn your case, the responsible person has left the company, have you contacted them to see if they turned it over to someone or left the password written down with their other papers?\nIf not, you have options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Contact IT and explain you need to get access to the former employees email account. Offer to handle the password reset or provide them the Apple links and assist them if it's faster. I've brought a pie or brownies to ensure the IT staff are properly motivated to help me out. :-)\n\n*Have HR contact the employee and ask if they turned over the password to this account and arrange to have that information returned to the company. If that fails, contact legal and request return of the company property (the company VPP account).\n\n*If that fails, have these people write up their efforts and take that to your Apple Representative. If you don't have one, contact the local Apple Retail store and ask to speak with a business representative.\n\n\nI've never seen a case where someone couldn't get control of an Apple ID, but you might need to do some work to prove you are now the rightful company contact to get traction. Working with people you can see in person or face time with is far easier than 1-800-APL-CARE in my experience, but even over the phone with the right data and patience, you can often get what you need or have your problem escalated appropriately to a person that can help you.\n", "Q: How can I create a custom behavior for a URL scheme?

I'm maintaining a series of iPads used in kiosk context for a client. Occasionally the  iPads become 'locked' and require a hard reset and restore from my Mac which was used for the original deploy.\nMy question is, can I somehow allow the unlocking and restore on a 2nd desktop (the client's) Mac? Isn't the iPad 'tied' to just one Mac, the one used for the original deploy? Or am I mistaken?\n\nA: If you are resetting these things and then restoring then from a saved local backup that second part is tied to your Mac.  \nYou can reset an iPad to its \"factory fresh\" state from any Mac/PC, but you might not be able to reset an iPad to your desired \"factory fresh eco_bach kiosk\" state from any but yours.\n\nA: You are definitely mistaken ;) it can be done by any computer, Mac or PC! As long as you have the IPSW file you can restore it from iTunes on any platform. It's only 'tied' when you sync your iPhone with iTunes library.\n", "Q: Can't acquire DHCP with WPA2 Enterprise I have a user with a MacBook Pro (late 2013) running OS X 10.10.5 \"Yosemite\" that can't acquire a DHCP address from our corporate Wi-Fi. It's a WPA2 Enterprise network with Meraki on the back end. From the Meraki tools I can see him authenticate successfully but just won't accept an IP. \nIt's worth nothing that we have a dozen other Macs (iMacs, MBPs, Mac Minis) all connected without issue. iPhones, Android, and Windows 7/8 all connect to the same network without issue as well.\nOutside of an answer, are there some tools I can use to troubleshoot this better? \n\nA: I figured out the problem. I wanted to post a solution in case anybody else sees this. There was a corrupted lease in our DHCP server that this Mac kept trying to request. As a result, the two (DHCP server & Mac) went into a loop until timeout. \nFixing the DHCP database the Mac acquired an address with no issues. \n", "Q: How to mount PCIe SSD from MacBook Air in another computer I got this SSD out of an Apple laptop that's broken from liquid damage.\nWhat is this connection called and how do I mount this storage device to retrieve data from it? It looks like PCIe. Does Apple sell a part to mount this via USB adapter or something?\n\n\nA: The physical interface(s) or form factor(s) are Apple proprietary. The different SSDs have 6+12/12+16/8+18/7+17 pins. The electrical/logical interface is PCIe 2.0 2x or 4x (everymac.com also mentions SATA for some older MacBook Airs).\nSeveral adapters for different MacBook (Air) SSDs are available here.\nExample: MacBook Air Mid 2013 SSD to PCI-e 1X\n\nI haven't been able to find an adapter for the MacBook Air Early 2015 SSD there. The latest MacBook Air uses a proprietary PCIe 2.0 4x instead of a proprietary PCIe 2.0 2x interface like older MacBook Airs.\n\nA: the \"SNANSHI 2013-2014 Year MacBook Air A1465 A1466 Pro A1502 A1398 MD712 SSD PCI-e 4X Adapter\" for $13.99 worked perfectly for me, and I can use the drive as a primary boot drive for my PC.  The card is recognized as a SATA device in my BIOS, and it works flawlessly.

Someone showed me their iMac that they recently bought second-hand. It boots normally to the login screen with the PIN (EDIT: it is a PIN and NOT a passcode; the message reads \"Enter your system lock PIN code to unlock this Mac.\"). I'm trying to circumvent that by reinstalling OS X via Disk Utility, however the Command+R combo on boot brings me to a screen with a picture of a lock and a password field, no text. Extensive internet searches have yet to even acknowledge that this is a thing that can happen. What do I do short of disassembling this, removing the HDD, and going from there?\n\nA: The issue I was experiencing was due to a firmware lock, likely triggered via iCloud. Because it is a late 2012 model, bypassing the lock is no longer possible by removing a stick of RAM and resetting the PRAM. It is locked-out by an EFI chip that executes the lock routine before booting. My only options er on the side of more extreme hacking (via reflow solder gun).\n\nA: This means the hard drive is encrypted. Boot the machine up, go to System Preferences > Security > FileVault and enter the password to decrypt the volume.\nEDIT:\nIf you don't have access to the drive/password, force boot to Internet Recovery by holding [CMD] + [OPTION] + [R] and you should see a spinning globe (you'll need to have Internet access). More info here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314\nOnce Internet Recovery is booted up, because you're not using the HD to boot, you should be able to wipe the drive and reinstall, even if it is encrypted. Info on that here: Lost password on Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) Drive. Want to reformat it\nNOTE: Internet Recovery requires that the Mac has OS X Lion or later. Internet Recovery is essentially the same as using the ol' Snow Leopard disc to boot.\nEDIT 2:\nThat message means that someone has locked out the Mac as a security measure using Find My Mac within iCloud. There is some hefty ways to get around that (http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-unlock-system-lock-pin-code.1438822/), but since it is purchased used, the only reasonable solution would be to install a new Hard Drive or contact the previous owner and obtain the PIN.\n", "Q: Restoring deleted iTunes 12 user music libraries After having updated iTunes, my entire music library disappeared. What can I do to restore it?\n\nA: When iTunes updated, whether automatically or under your permission, it replaced its data which contained information on getting your music. None of the music that you have downloaded via iTunes, or even added into iTunes from a CD won't appear. What only appears is links to stream anything that has been purchased from iTunes, even though it may still exist on your computer.\nTo fix this, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to your computer's music folder.\nThis is normally the folder called \"Music\". On Mac OS X computers, you can type this in Terminal:\nopen music\n\nThis should open your music folder. \n\n\n*Navigate to the iTunes folder\nIn the music folder, you should see an \"iTunes\" folder, which has a few files. Locate the iTunes Library.itl file. Rename it to iTunes Library (corrupt).itl.\n\n\n*Locate the missing user library\nNext, there should be a folder called Previous iTunes Libraries. Inside this folder, should be a few files, which are called iTunes Library followed by the date. Choose the latest file (The order is Year-Month-Day. e.g. 2015-08-18 for August 18th 2015). Copy the file.\n\n\n*Place the user library back to its proper spot\nNow that you've copied the iTunes library that holds all the information about your real music libraries, we need to place it back where it belongs. Go back to the folder where you renamed a file to iTunes Library (corrupt).itl. Paste the copied library here, and rename it to iTunes Library.itl.\n\n\n\n*Restart iTunes and Voila!\nRestart iTunes, and your original music libraries should be there! Happy Listening!\n\n", "Q: Maximized window on both displays on OS X 10.8.3 I have a dual monitor setup on the Mac. I want to work on a tool, in full screen, on display 1 and simultaneously check few things, on Final Cut Pro, on display 2.\nWhen I maximize the tool in  display 1, I can't see the FCP in display 2.\nIs there any third party tool to solve this, or is it an OS X limitation.\n\nA: UPDATE 2\nThese are the support instructions for using multiple monitors with Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and earlier. You will likely want to use the Extended Desktop Settings. If you still doesn't let you see the other app, then check to see if FCP has an Always On Top setting which may be turned off, and don't have the apps set to full-screen mode.\nUPDATE\nThis solution will only work if you are running Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later. (Apologies as I missed in your question that 10.8 was Mountain Lion and not Mavericks).\n\nIf you do find it, then set that. Then go to one Desktop and Ctrl + Click on the FCP icon in the Dock and under Options, select This Desktop.\nThen go to another desktop, Ctrl + Click on the other apps icon and under options select This Desktop.\nThen you should be able to go to one monitor and select the FCP Desktop, move to the second monitor and select the other Apps Desktop and that should display both apps on the respective monitors.\nThis is Apple's support page for Multiple Displays.\n", "Q: Time Machine Problems I just got a new 2TB hard drive and I wanted to set up Time Machine. I did and now it is backing up stuff.\nOn this page (http://www.howtogeek.com/212445/how-to-use-a-time-machine-drive-for-both-file-storage-and-backups/) I read that \"When you set up Time Machine, your Mac wants to use an entire external drive exclusively for backups.\"\nIs this true, what does it mean exactly?\nAlso is it possible to view folders in a regular manner after they are backed up on the hard drive without using Time Machine? \n\nA: You can read any file on the Time Machine volume - just write permission is withheld in the Backups.backupdb folder. This is all covered in https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250\nFeel free to explore the drive and use it for other storage - the system keeps you from messing in places where the machine needs to control file writes.\nI can only assume the \"exclusively\" means that it might ask to erase and reformat a drive that doesn't meet Time Machine requirements. I've never had issues with GUID/Extended HFS volumes and Time Machine needing to be \"exclusive\".\n\nA: I have used an external drive with Time Machine and had no problem also storing other files on it.  You don't need to create a separate partition or anything (though you could, if you wanted to) - just put other files anywhere on the disk except for the backups.backupdb folder.\nThe only thing to note is that the TimeMachine backups (in backups.backupdb) will keep getting bigger and bigger until eventually the disk is full.\nAt that point, to add more (non-TimeMachine) files to the drive, you will need to delete some old backups.  Pondini gives excellent instructions for deleting backups, but in summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*From Time Machine menu, \"Enter Time Machine\".\n\n*Choose backup to delete (perhaps the oldest one - but it is up to you) from dark grey tabs at right-hand side of screen.\n\n*From Gear menu on Finder window, choose \"Delete Backup\".\n\n\n(You can also delete individual or all backups of a particular file/folder.)\nObviously deleting old backups makes Time Machine's archive less useful - but only slightly, because by the time the drive is this full, Time Machine will already be deleting the oldest backups when making new ones anyway - you're just prodding it to delete old backups a little earlier than it otherwise would.\nWhen your drive is so full that Time Machine only has space to store a few very recent backups then it's time to get a bigger disk - or free up space by moving the non-Time-Machine files to a different drive.\n", "Q: Tried to reinstall osX and ended up getting folder with questionmark on boot Today I decided after 6 years to format my MacBook Pro 2009 laptop.\nOriginally I had Snow Leopard on it (I still have an unscratched cd) but in some point back in 2012 a friend installed (using his appledId) the Mountain Lion.\nI've been messing around with this the whole day and have tried a bunch of different things and now I think I am in the worst possible situation.\nIn the beginning I restarted the mac and pressed as described online the cmd+R combination. I formated my disk and then tried to reinstall the osx.\nThe dialog box was saying Mountain Lion and it was asking for an appleId. Obviously my appledId wouldn't work cause I never purchased it.\nThen I thought to use my Snow Leopard cd and boot from there (holding the option key). I tried several times but for some reason the mac dvd player keeps rejecting my cd. This is what I call bad luck.\nSo after some hours, working on my second laptop I decide to do something crazy. Install Ubuntu through a live usb memory stick. I create one, plug it in the mac and make the whole installation.\nThat was completely stupid of me. I had problems with the graphic card and things were not displayed correctly. \nI remove the Ubuntu using gParted and now I am in the point where I start the mac and I get a blinking folder with a questiomark in the middle.\nI have no idea what to do. When I click the options button, I get nothing. Not even the harddrive. \nWhen I place the cd of SnowLeopard I also get nothing and after a while the cd is rejected.\nSo what am I supposed to do now? Any help would be mostly appreciated!\n\nA: *\n\n*First things, power on with the space key pressed to eject the CD if needed.\n\n*Then power on with command+s held - if there is any OS X volume that's bootable, you can get some basic info\n\n*If not, reset the NVRAM - (Command Option P R) and hold until you hear the third boot chime.\n\n*After the third chime, hold option only and you should end up at a grey screen.\n\n\nTake a picture of that and post a follow on question with more details / less broad open-ended. If you want to boot from the CD/DVD and wipe everything, ask that. If you can get to single user mode, then you might be able to patch things together.\n", "Q: Hard drive boots over USB but not when install internally I am trying to upgrade from a 500GB HD (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136314) to a 1TB HD (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822152291). The only spec difference (other than capacity) as far as I can tell between the two is that the 1TB HD is SATA 3 (6Gb/s) while the 500GB HD is SATA 2 (3Gb/s).\nI installed OSX Lion to the 1TB drive while it was connected to my laptop via a USB to SATA cable. I can then boot from that drive while it is connected via the USB. However, if I install it in the HD bay in the laptop (13\" Pro, late 2011) then the screen shows a blinking folder icon with a question mark on it.\nBooting a GParted Live USB while the drive is internally mounted (i.e. hooked up directly to the motherboard) shows it as being marked \"unallocated\" as if there were no partition. However, if I boot into the GParted Live USB while it is hooked up via USB it recognizes the partitions (though it does flag them, saying it can't read them). The 500GB drive shows up whether mounted internally or via USB without any flags.\nThe common suggested fix is that the internal SATA cable is faulty. However, I am not experiencing any problems with booting from my current HD, so I think that is not the problem. The new HD also seems in good working condition since it boots from USB just fine. My suspicion is that the backwards compatibility from SATA 3 to SATA 2 is not working as it should, but I'm not sure how to force it to work.\n\nA: Make sure your Mac is off (not just standby) and turn your Mac on like you always do, but hold the Option key at startup until you hear the boot chime. You'll see a bunch of images of HDs in a row, use the arrow keys to select the drive you wish to boot from and then press Enter. Your Mac should now startup using the selected drive this time, but to make it the default drive, go into System Preferences->Startup Disk and then select your drive again.

This is the one big drawback for me with Apple vs. other mobile devices. Editing is much more difficult without this feature.\nIf not, is there a away to do this if I jailbreak my device(s)?\n\nA: Currently, there is no way to do this without a jailbreak. The software keyboard has no functionality to do what you want, and as a developer, I know that there is not way to program any other delete but the backspace.\nAs for the jailbreak, I am sure there is a way, but make sure you Google it first, since I wouldn't jailbreak without knowing for a fact.\n", "Q: localhost port mapped to website Is it possible to open a website, for example, http://apple.stackexchange.com with url http://localhost:8000 without changing hosts file?\n\nA: This is quite easy if there's no back story to why you feel hosts file is not the right solution.

My Mac Pro g5 was running Leopard, fully updated, quite fine. But, since Im an idiot tinkerer who loves linux as mich as Mac, I decided to stupidly install YDL. Now, it ran flawlessly for a few months, until I packed the machine away while I moved house. Now, YDL boots quite fine... but MacOS refuse to move anywhere past the Apple Logo. I get no spinning Wheel, just the bitten apple on a grey screen and the machine sitsthere...\nSo far, I reseated ram, reset NVRAM, reset PRAM, theres no password on OF, I even used the button thing on the motherboard to reset. Nothing. The drive is fine and readable... YDL And Leopard are installed on the same drive, differentpartitions.

Anyone know what I can do? 😨\n\nA: The only thing you really can do is get someone to replace the home button ribbon cable for you, sorry. \nThe physical home button is likely not the problem. On the other side of the iPhone screen is a sensor which detects if the button was pressed. This is the likely the problem, and you can find them on eBay as a home button as a home button ribbon cable. However, it may be that the connector terminals on headphone jack are no good and that needs repair. I'd strongly advise trying to find a pro to do this repair for you, the iPhone 5C is no fun to work on, the screen is hard to reconnect \"just right\". So, if you have little to no experience in iPhone repair, you'd be better off seeking a pro.\n", "Q: Unable to delete files from finder?

Today, I ran a hardware diagnostics with no errors reported.\nI ran a CPU analysis in Activity Monitor, but nothing seemed to be using a ton of CPU (not that I really understand it, b/c Apple support threads say to analyze by percentage to see if any one process is hanging, but they continue changing so how to know anyhow??)....but I digress.\nSo, I had also been having some problems with Safari freezing and other issues with a variety of programs, and ended up having to reinstall the \nOS X, some of which continue to occur despite this \"fix\". While I was looking at the CPU %'s I clicked Safari (w/in the Activity Monitor) and when it was open, I clicked on the Statistics tab...for what, I don't know because none of it makes a lot of sense to me, by way of what it really represents, but regardless, I did it. There I found what seemed like a huge number of \"faults\". \nI did the same with a few other running programs/apps and they showed no faults (or even a listing for faults where they could be displayed).\nWhat are faults in this context and what does a high number represent? Is this reflecting errors? Is this something that could drain battery? Is it something else I should be concerned about?\n\n\nA: In the context of the statistics shown here, the 'faults' represent 'page faults', which are actually benign and refer to an attempt to read something that was not present in memory. This is taken care of in the virtual memory system by 'paging' the requested memory into the memory map of the process. But the OS keeps track of how many of these there were. If the number is very high, it can mean that you don't have enough RAM, or that you have a large number of processes trying to use more RAM than is currently to hand.\nAssertions represent something unexpected by the program, and would be indicative of some kind of problem. I would be surprised to see any of those in 'live' commercial software, though.\nThings that can drain battery more than expected include:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Flash plugin. This is a memory hog and should die already.\n\n*Google's Chrome browser. It has been shown that using Safari instead of Chrome can add up to an hour of usable battery life.

Update: For anyone coming across this question, the best solution I've found is a cloud backup company called Backblaze — it's in the cloud, so no longer have to worry about hardware failures and we now just have a large network drive for shared resources (which actually is also then backed up via Backblaze)!.\n\nOriginal Question:\nIn our office we have ~8+ or so iMacs. Currently we're backing up to individual hard-drives via TimeMachine.\nWe're looking at creating a more stable backup solution, one that is kept away from the iMacs in the networking room, so all backups are centralised.\nI was thinking of using something like a Drobo with plenty of HDD space, that all of the iMacs back up to.\nHowever, ideally, I don't want people to be able to see the backups of other machines.\nIs it possible to have a centralised backup HDD that is write only, in conjunction with Apple Time Machine?\nOr any other solution that may be relevant, ideally from someone else who already has an office of Apple machines and backing them up in a clever way.\n\nA: You can simply put an Apple Time Capsule in your network and select this as Time Machine backup volume. And you may choose an encrypted backup to ensure more privacy. This works perfect in my office with a dozen MacBooks.\nA more cost efficient solution may be a 3rd party solution like a Synology DiskStation containing a Raid 1 or 5. Synology also offers Time Machine support which works seamless for me at home.\n\nA: Install a copy of the OS X Server app on a spare Mac with a pile of storage connected to it. Create a share for each Mac that you need to back up, and connect each Mac to its own share. That way, each Mac only sees its own backups. You can also limit the size allowed for each share if you like.\nAnother advantage of having an OS X server on the network is that it can serve as a cache for downloaded updates from Apple, so each update will be downloaded only once, and stored on the cache.\nThere are other services that are available, and all you need is a spare Mac (I use a Mac Mini) to act as server, and a copy of the Server app from the App Store for $19.99 or so.\n\nA: You can backup multiple Mac's to a central Time Capsule.  On each Mac: System Preferences > Time Machine > Select Disk.  Choose the same Time Capsule for all your computers.  Each computer will have a separate .sparsebundle on the Time Capsule disk. \nWhen setting up the Time Capsule disk you can set individual accounts which should solve the security issue: Airport Utility > Choose Time Capsule > Edit > Disks > Enable File Sharing > select with accounts instead of with device password.\nI assume you can use a Drobo attached to a Time Capsule (or perhaps directly) and recreate all of the above but I have never done it.\n\nA: I am trying to do a similar setup (10 Macs), however cloud is not option for our business. A big problem are quotas, so a more sophisticated solution seemed the way to go.

Several points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that depending on how fast/slow your system is responding you may need small delays after every keystroke or action.  You'll have to figure the minimum time empirically.\n\n*Any time you \"activate\" or launch Safari, Excel or any application within the script there will be a delay until the app is up and running.  To deal with this,  you will need these apps running prior to running the script, or you need to introduce long enough delays into your script, or better yet you need to add code that pauses the script until the app is launched.\n\n*When you open Safari and Excel you are not specifying any specific window, file or URL  to target for the subsequent keystrokes. So as written the script will default to the front window/tab of each app. I guess that's OK if what you are targeting is the front window. If no open window exists then the script will fail.  So for example, to get around this I added code to open a new excel file.\n\n*As currently constructed, the script copies from the front window in Safari, then eventually comes back to the very same window to execute the tab - paste - tab x 8. One has to assume that was the intention?  \n\n*As currently constructed the default is to paste to cell A1 of Excel.  Then you tell Excel to move to once cell to the left, but there is no cell to the left of A1. \n\n*Much of the code is written for GUI scripting.  Where possible its better to use Applescript commands to accomplish the desired activity.  I'll just leave it like that for now.  You probably have enough on your mind learning the basics right now. \ntell application \"Safari\" to activate\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Safari\"\n    keystroke \"c\" using command down\n    delay 0.3\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\" to activate\n    delay 5 -- time required to launched Excel if not already open\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Microsoft Excel\"\n    keystroke \"n\" using command down -- open new excel page\n    delay 0.5 -- wait for new excel page to open\n    keystroke \"v\" using command down\n    delay 0.2 -- wait for key stroke entry\n    key code 123\n    delay 0.2 -- wait for key stroke entry\n    keystroke \"c\" using command down\n    delay 0.2 -- wait for key stroke entry\nend tell\n\nend tell\n\n\ntell application \"Safari\" to activate\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Safari\"\n    keystroke tab\n    delay 0.2 -- wait for key stroke entry\n    keystroke \"v\" using command down\n    delay 0.2 -- wait for key stroke entry\n\n    repeat 8 times\n        keystroke tab\n        delay 0.2 -- wait for key stroke entry\n    end repeat\n\nend tell\n\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How to disable alert notifications in iOS when battery drops to 20% and then to 10%?

In this case you weren't really hacked and damage is not done unless you make the phone call.  \nNot sure what you mean by the tablet acting \"weird\" so its difficult to answer your question with any precision.  Assuming you are concerned about the behavior of your tablet after opening the email, the best thing is to erase your tablet and reset to a back-up prior to the email.\nAssuming you released personal information to the fake PayPal site, you should change your password and inform Paypal ASAP (they may need you to get a new account).

Would the -d option work the same?  Or is there a way to do this that would work on both platforms?\n\nA: The lowercase \"d\" should work. If it doesn't, you can install GNU install with Homebrew coreutils which will provide the \"D\" flag.\n\nA: macOS lower-case -d is fairly different from Linux upper-case -D.\nOn Linux, you can do\ninstall -D path/to/file.ext target/dir/file.ext\n\nand it'll create target/dir if it doesn't exist yet and then copy path/to/file.ext into it.\nOn macOS, install -d path/to requires that path/to is a directory, and it'll create that directory and its parent directories. If you pass a path to a file like install -d my/file.ext, it'll complain install: my/file.ext exists but is not a directory. You can use install -d to create several directories in one invocation like install -d my/first/dir my/second/dir, and it'll create both directories. This is very different from install -D my/first/dir my/second/dir in Linux, where it'll copy my/first/dir to my/second/dir, creating parent directories as needed.\nI think the portable (*) alternative to\ninstall -D path/to/my/file.ext target/path/file.ext\n\nis:\nmkdir -p $(dirname target/path/file.ext)\ninstall path/to/my/file.ext target/path/file.ext\n\n*: On very very old operating systems, mkdir -p has bugs.

In this menu select \"Lock\" which has the water drop icon.\n\nNow the watch is locked in the same matter as during a swimming activity: to unlock the watch turn the crown for a second or two.\n\nA: There's no way to turn the touch input off temporarily, but you can prevent the Apple Watch from stopping workouts early. When you start a workout just go to the watch face the way you normally would, the Workout will run in the background and can't be stopped until you go back to the app and it stop it yourself. It's not perfect, as you can't see your live progress, but it still works.\n\nA: This might be something that was added in Watch OS2... You can lock your watch screen when you are using the Workout app. \nThe basics of this are launch the Workout app, start your workout, then force press, then you can lock the display.  To stop your workout, force press again, and select the option (end, pause, unlock).\nFull instructions can be found at this link \n", "Q: OS X wants me to reset my password randomly I restarted from Windows (under Boot Camp) via Restart in OS X..., which I've done many times before. This time, my MacBook restarted and stayed black for a while. I eventually held the power button to reboot it.\nIt eventually came back up to a Reset Password recovery screen. I tried restarting and holding Option to select the Macintosh partition, but it always comes back to Reset Password.\n\nI didn't forget my password. What's going on?\n\nA: I found the answer here: Skip Reset Password for OS X\n\nOS X Yosemite has a troublesome password reset screen you can access by turning your computer off and back on from the login screen. However, once you do this, there is no way out. The \"Reset Password\" boot wizard offers no exit without reseting your password. If you restart your Mac, you will end up right back in the wizard.\n\nThe solution is a PRAM reset: Command-Option-P-R during bootup.\n", "Q: Symbolic linking to Photos from another user I am running El Capitan Beta, but this question would also apply to Yosemite.  \nI want another account's (account B) \"Photos\" app to link to my primary account's (account A) Photos library without moving my library to an outside drive without permissions.  I can't point the Library from the Photos App in account B to to the Library in account A.  I have added Account B with full permission read and write with extended ACL permissions to account A's /User/AccountA/Pictures folder and Photos Library.  Verified with ls -le.\nSo... the best solution I see is to create a hard link from /User/AccountB/Pictures/AccountBLibrary -> /User/AccountA/Pictures/AccountALibrary so that it always points to that inode.  Can anyone see a reason NOT to do this or a better way to link the two without moving my photos library on Account A.\nEdit: Well for one - you can't hard link a directory (which obviously pictures libraries are)... so to reword my question - What about soft link? (Symbolic) (Thanks fd0).  And now I can see - It produces the same error (because it isn't a hard link).  So... can I accomplish this?\nThe goal is to not duplicate photos (I use iCloud photo library, but I don't want to duplicate even \"optimized\" photos).  \n\nA: The iPhoto library is a package container not really a single file.  There are .plist, .db and other files in the package that might get altered differentially when you open via the different accounts.  This might contribute to the problems people mentioned.  Crazy idea, and I haven't tried it, but it might be better to recreate the package content on the new account using symbolic links to the folders that contain the actual photos on the old account.  This way all the .plist, .db and related files in the package can remain local to the new account, but you accomplish your goal of not copying the actual photos.  I definitely would back up the library before giving this a try.\n\nA: Oh man - even if you could, you are almost sure to mess up one or the other. The beta software will re-write files and database information that will cause the non-beta and older version of photos problems when they read those changed files and data structures.\nIf you really are convinced to mix libraries:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup and test that it works. Keep that backup off-line until you're done with the beta. Also, you'll need to systematically archive all new files in case you need to throw out both libraries and start over.\n\n*Consider using iCloud to mediate the photo library. I've had limited success with that and no horrible issues.\n\n*I know people that tried what you are attempting (well they just took the entire home folder and ran it on the new OS - but that's less risky and functionally equivalent to having hard links) and it caused them to lose files and data.\n\n\nGood luck. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204486\n", "Q: How do I clear iBooks download queue on OS X?

How do I delete it from my download queue without downloading the entire book?\nI'm using OS X 10.10 \" Yosemite\" but hopefully someone knows of a generic solution for most OS X installs.\n\nA: Deleting the iBooks cache in /private/var/folders/randomLettersNumber/C/com.apple.iBooksX did the trick for me.\nAn easier way at least on OS X 10.11 is to click a book in the download queue, select all, then delete.

Would you mind rebooting to Recovery HD and re-running Disk Utility to repair the drive? If that works, try again and see if you can get an error from Console or system.log if it fails you again. I'll dig into where BootCamp might log the failure in the mean time.\n", "Q: How to transfer an App Store app after developer enrolment ended? I want to transfer an app from iTunes Connect. App was previously approved for Apple and was on sale. Now my developer license has expired. And now I can not find Transfer App and even Delete App button. Is there a way to transfer an app in this case? \n\nA: You can't do it until you renew your developer account.\nBut, I know a couple of cases where calling Apple and explaining the case, Apple renew the account for 10 days to let users delete apps (don't know about transferring, but you could try).\n", "Q: Can't change media kind from music to podcast in iTunes 12 I've been downloading mp3s from a podcast's archives on their website (the archived episodes aren't available on iTunes). After adding these files to iTunes, I'm unable to do the logical thing, which is to change the media kind to Podcasts so it will show up under Podcasts and not Music. When I click Get Info > Options, Music is the only option in the dropdown.\n\nIt seems this solution used to work in previous versions of iTunes. Has anyone figured out a workaround? I really don't want to have to switch to the Music app to listen to these mp3s.\nNote: Some people elsewhere seemed to think turning off iTunes Match would help, but I don't even have Match, so that's not a solution for me.\n\nA: So I found that if I change the media type before iTunes \"processes\" the file I'm able to set it as podcast. After it's already been processed I'm not able to do it. So I just deleted my file from iTunes, re-added it, and was able to edit the media type.\n\nA: It's a hidden tag, I ended up removing all tags using TagStripper and then redoing them.\n", "Q: Will iOS app accepted on App Store if 80% of UI is rendered on UIWebView and 20% being native OCR I have a mobile website which at high level provides these functionalities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign-in \n\n*Sign-up \n\n*Few forms where user can fill his additional details\n\n*Providing some capabilities to user based on information provided by him\n\n\nNow I want to integrate OCR capabilities such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*ID card scan\n\n*Debit card scan\n\n*Void check scan\n\n\nSo that some of the forms can be automatically filled by information extracted from these.\nI am planning to make a native app in iOS consuming most of the forms, flow from my mobile website by rendering respective weburls on webview, and integrating vendor SDKs to provide OCR capabilities. \nWill Apple accept my iOS app in App Store if I have 80% of flow, UI rendered on UIWebView and remaining 20% being integration and use of native vendor SDKs for OCR capabilities?\n\nA: This is walking into a grey area I don't know about. According to the Apple App guidelines, an app cannot just be a mobile version of a website. Since it seems as if you are just adding device capabilities, it will probably be rejected. Think of the Stack Overflow app. If it was just converting a website to an app without a address bar, it would not exist. They had to app-ify most(if not all) of the UI elements. You might be able to get away with leaving some things like a login form in the website form, but it has to look seamless. \n", "Q: \"open\" from the command line just hangs using iTerm2 The \nopen -a <AppName.app>\n\nis not working on one of my Yosemite based macbooks.

It's only temporary because I'll be ordering a new SSD in a couple of weeks.\nThe OS X installer rightly alerts me that the drive is failing so I should replace it - but I'm wondering if there's any way to get around this alert and install it anyway?\n\nA: I can't offer much advice about the SSD in question given the very limited information you've shared about it.\nHowever, I suggest you try installing OS X onto a USB key (preferably a fast USB 3 one) or SD Card (slower; don't recommend). It'll make migrating your files to your new SSD easier. Just be careful of the protruding hardware!\n", "Q: Apple 1 year warranty - What type of issues are covered for Macbook Pro UK? I am wondering which types of human error or accidental breakage the Apple Manufacturer one year warranty covers.\nI have a Macbook Pro which is in full working order, The problem is the reciept for this is in somebody else's name.\nI have been told by the store manager in one Apple Store that in order for me to get a new receipt, the only way he could think of is if my Macbook Pro had a \"fault\" which resulted in me being issued with a new Macbook Pro (and a new receipt).\nWhat the manager was saying is if I could create the conditions for a problem to occur on the Macbook Pro, he could then issue me a new one with a new receipt.\nI told him it sounds idiotic for me to do such a thing to a brand new machine, but at the same time it's the only option I have in this politically correct world.\nI need the receipt in my name for third party insurance reasons - I cannot insure the Macbook pro with a receipt in somebody else's name.\n\nA: First of all, I'm glad you asked about it before hitting your MacBook with a sledgehammer. The 1-year limited warranty only covers damage that was caused by a manufacturer defect. Water and/or physical damage is not covered. No exceptions. The only damage that is covered is if the battery drains super quick or whenever you use it it gets way too hot. Or the software does not work properly and you have tried all remedies possible. \nSecondly, the only way to get a new receipt is to purchase a new computer. That's really the only way. I broke my iPhone twice, and no new receipt was ever given. \nThe only way that is possible is to sell your computer and then buy a new/used MacBook. \n", "Q: Crashplan headless suppport: .ui_info resets every time I reboot I've recently updated to CrashPlan 4.3.0 on my mac running OS X 10.10.3.\nI've followed the headless guide on the CrashPlan support site and contacted their support line, whom are usually good but this time refused to help me because headless CrashPlan an unsupported config.\nEvery time I reboot my OS X 10.10.4 machine I find that /Library/Application\\ Support/CrashPlan/.ui_info file defaults to it's normal local CrashPlan server details.

I've been trying to download iMovie for a long time, and I have never had enough space. I have an 8 GB iPhone 5C. I have a project in particular I want to get done, so I deleted all my other apps (other than pre-installed ones, of course) in order to try and download iMovie. According to iTunes, after this, I have 2.04 GB available. I figured this would be enough to download iMovie and get this project over with before deleting it and redownloading all my apps again. And, yet, again I got the dreaded error code declaring that iMovie could not be downloaded at this time and that I didn't have enough storage. I don't know what to do. I know that apps are always more than the number that appears on the App Store page, but even ~2 GB should be enough to download iMovie, right?\nHow can I download iMovie?\n\nA: According to the App Store, iMovie would require 641 MB of storage to download on my iPhone 5S (it should be about the same for a 5C), so yes, you have more than enough storage available. I'd try restarting the iPhone, accomplished by holding the power button and home button down together until you see the Apple logo appear. It is completely safe, I do it to my iPhone all the time, it will not delete anything off of your iPhone, nor change any settings, but it may fix little issues like this.\nIf that doesn't work, try downloading the app through iTunes on your MacBook (or PC) and then sync iMovie to iPhone, that requires less storage, anyway.\n", "Q: Yosemite and character viewer I just upgraded to Yosemite, I find that I cannot minimise the Character Viewer into the dock as I used to... is this normal?\nIt saved me a lot of trouble to have it pop-up every time I started the computer.\nOr maybe there's a way to have it a login item?\nMaybe this is related but I find this complex...\n\nA: I think the issue you're facing is that the Character Viewer is no longer global, but is now per-app, so if you open it in, for instance, Safari, then switch to Finder, it will vanish.\nOpen it again in Finder & its stored size, position & last viewed will be different.\nThe advantage is you can keep it open in 2 different apps at the same time [with the one attached to any backgrounded app hidden] & be working on 2 different things.\nThe downside would be if that's not what you want to do ;-)\nSimplest way to activate it is  Cmd ⌘   Ctrl ⌃   Space  but there's no 'close' command other than clicking the red dot, or temporarily, by switching to another app.\n\nA: I am not aware of any Character Viewer app that could be placed in the Dock (then again, I don't remember if I used this thing before Yosemite, though I think so). But in Settings > Keyboard you can find Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar so they are accessible.

I'm on Yosemite, and I'd like to hide the Finder toolbar. But doing \"View > Hide Toolbar\" causes two undesired side effects:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tab functionality is disabled: \"File > New Tab\" is grayed out. If there are already multiple tabs, then \"View > Hide Toolbar\" is grayed out. So we can hide the toolbar, or we can have tabs, but not both. I have been able to work around this issue by installing XtraFinder and using its tab functionality.\n\n*Folders open in new windows, instead of the same window. This behavior is actually documented. We can revert to the regular behavior with various key combinations, depending on how we're opening the folders, for example by using Ctrl+Cmd+O instead of just Cmd+O. This is not a great solution, though -- I don't want to have to use more complicated keyboard shortcuts just to get Finder to behave normally.\nMy questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Are there better workarounds to get Finder to behave normally when the toolbar is hidden? \n\n*What possible reasons could there be to have Finder behave this way? It seems like \"the principle of most surprise\" at work.\n\nA: As to your second question of \"why does the Finder behave this way?\", I will hazard a guess that it mimics the decades-long traditional behavior of Finder windows.  This was how Finder windows worked in Mac OS through version 9.\n\nIn earlier versions of OS X, there was a button in the top right corner of windows that toggled between the \"old\" Finder window behavior and the \"new\" (toolbar) behavior. \n\nThe button was removed in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, but you get the same results by hiding the toolbar.\n", "Q: Why does this cause Mac OSX to print over SSH?

I ordered one of these Vicro Technilogy Ltd. Bluetooth Mini GamePad (PA-BK11) ’s off of Amazon.\n\nIt shows up as “Bluetooth Gamepad” in the Bluetooth system preferences panel, with a keyboard icon. I can click “pair,” at which point it asks me to type in a 6 digit number.\nIs there a trick to making it pair without entering the requested PIN number? Having no luck Googling this one. There are one or two articles on accomplishing the same in Linux, but nothing for Mac.\nThe controller is not anything special, but it’s small enough to fit in my kids’ hands when they play Nintendo games, something that none of the other controllers can do even if they do pair correctly.\n[edit] I've since tried this with a newer (2014) iMac at work. Though both it and my own computer (2009 model) use Yosemite, the 2014 iMac doesn't require a pin to be typed in. According to Apple.com, my Mac has Bluetooth 2.1.\n\nA: I've managed to connect to a cheap Chinese play/pause button using blueutil on Big Sur. Just use blueutil --connect ID without pairing it first. After a couple of tries it started working.\n\nA: You mention a “6 digit number” but from what I understand about how Bluetooth gamepads pair in Mac OS X it should be a 4 digit PIN.\nRegardless, you can enter any series of digits from your main system keyboard and it should work. Try something like 0000/000000 or 1234/123456 and it should be able to pair without issue.\n\nA: So I had a similar problem with the BK3001BA Keyboard. I am not sure if this will work given I could enter the information but it would not pair correctly when I entered the correct pin.\nRegardless, I opened Bluetooth File Transfer, and connected to my keyboard to send a file, and it connected this time.

I want to plug them into my devices to see if they still work, but I need to know: Is there any risk of seriously damaging them if a cable turns out to be bad?\n\nA: Yes - lightning carries decent amount of power. Crossed wires could short out a device. MagSafe - worse - more power, less room for error. The only upside there is the MagSafe in side of things is a bit more robust since it handles more power and if you blow the MagSafe on the Mac, it's a relatively inexpensive repair.\nFixing the phone connector would be far more costly.\nThat being said, the change of damage is low and if you have lots of cables and can make money on them, the risk might be worth it even if you damage things and have repair bills.\n\nA: I'm reluctant to touch this one with the limited information provided about the extent of damage, i.e. user assumes all risk.  That being said the Magsafe cable provides power from an AC source so it is theoretically possible that if there is serious damage to the cable or adaptor that it could lead to a short circuit or power surge.  The lightning cable provides data transfer and a lower voltage/power output which is modulated by the separate adaptor, not the cable. One would think there is less chance that the lightning cable would cause electronic damage.  Of course if the male lightning connector is physically damaged it could potentially damage the device upon insertion\nAgain, without the advantage of seeing the cables its hard to get more specific.\n\nA: Yes, it may be dangerous. Cross wiring may short out your device. \n", "Q: How can I make Apple Mail show the URL (in mails) when I hover over a link? There is a related question for Safari but I am interested in a solution for Mail. The ⌘View menu. \nI am using OS X 10.10.5, and I would really like to see the real full link I would follow, especially with potential phishing mails. \n\nA: Just hover the cursor over the link for a few seconds. The full URL will spring up underneath.\nThe down arrow that will also appear next to the link will open it in a Quick Look window rather than a browser - but if you want to check the link is safe first, don't use that until you're sure.\n\n\nA: Note that in macOS Big Sur, this feature changed.  No matter how long you hover over a link in Mail, the URL and link preview won't appear until you Force Click (press harder until you feel the second click) on a track pad.  If you are using a mouse, press the option key, and the URL and link preview arrow will appear.\n", "Q: kernel_task and softwareupdate constantly hogging .5 GB of RAM each I have a 2011 MacBook Pro. It had 4 GB of RAM and I upgraded it to 6 GB last year as it was getting a bit sluggish with the newer versions of OS X and running Vagrant VMs on it.\nLately, I’ve noticed my MacBook’s really slow upon waking up. As in, it takes up to a minute before it’ll accept keyboard and trackpad input, and app switching is woefully slow. And when input is recognised, it’s just very slow to operate.\nAfter working on my MacBook through this sluggishness for about half an hour, and the fans kicked in, I decided to open Activity Monitor to see what’s actually going on.\nVagrant’s using nearly 2 GB of RAM (that’s fine, that’s what I set it to use, and I can scale that down), but I also noticed that two processes—kernel_task and softwareupdate—are both using .5 GB each. Add this with Chrome using around .5 GB and other applications, this quickly adds up and puts pressure on my poor 6 GBs.\nThe softwareupdate process is self-explanatory, but why is it using so much memory? I imagine it’s only hitting Apple’s servers to check for software updates. Does it really need .5 GB for that? And what about the kernel_task process? Why does that need .5 GB of memory as well?\n\nA: kernel_task is, in effect, 'the operating system'.\nEvery process hangs from it, it's at the top of the entire tree of what processes are running on your machine.\nRun Activity Monitor [Applications > Utilities]\nFrom the View menu select 'All Processes, Hierarchically'\nSwitch to the memory tab\nClick the Memory column until the arrow points down\nYou can now see the 'tree' of processes, which are running inside another, & how much memory each is actually using. Note, for things like web browsers, that each page uses memory in addition to the overall usage for the browser itself.\nIt has to be said that 6GB RAM isn't much, these days - & using 2GB of that for a VM is not really leaving you with a lot to play with.  \n", "Q: How do I stop the dock from moving to my second monitor? I use an external monitor with my Macbook Pro, often to run Windows VMs with a task bar at the bottom.  While trying to use the task bar, I often accidentally summon the dock to the second monitor.

I don't want to go back to the old behaviour, I want to fix the new one.\nNote, repeated: This isn't a duplicate of the question which asks why this happens.  I know why it happens, but there's nothing there that would help me to prevent it from happening.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent the Dock from moving from monitor to monitor in any version of OS X.\n", "Q: Prevent iTunes from importing sound files when they are played When I download a sound file and double-click to play it, iTunes opens it (which is fine) but also copies it to the iTunes library.

Checked the settings, but there is nothing in \"General\" or \"Advanced\" that would seem to prevent this behavior.\nYes, I know I can set the default audio program to QuickTime.\n\nA: To permanently change iTunes behaviour, you'd need to switch off\nKeep iTunes Media folder organised - though it will soon disorganise itself if you also uncheck...\nCopy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to Library\nUnless you want to permanently change the behaviour of how iTunes keeps itself organised [or temporarily, with the added challenge of remembering in what state you last left it], I would recommend not using iTunes for 'casual' playback, but use Quick Look instead.\niTunes will never know or care you played them, won't add them to its content.\nJust drop all the files into a single flat folder [or any hierarchy you like], select the first one, hit the Space bar.\nThat one file will play as a one-shot.\nUse the arrow keys to switch the currently-selected file, that will play. [if you have a nested hierarchy, all 4 arrow keys come into play to navigate around, column view is easiest]\nReplay is either drag the play position marker back to the beginning, or quickly arrow up/down to select another file & back - easy to do before it starts to play the other file.\nWhen you're done, Space bar again will kill the Quick Look window.\nWorks with anything iTunes can play, aif, wav, mp3, aac etc\nDownside is you can't touch any other file or folder whilst it's playing - but you can use other apps & switch between, so long as you don't touch the Finder itself.\n\n", "Q: launchd disk writes Using activity monitor, I've noticed that launchd with pid 1 is using a lot of disk writes: after about 8 hours of light use, it's done ~2GB bytes written.

Details about Intel's upcoming Skylake processors indicates that they support DisplayPort 1.2 and Thunderbolt 3, but not DisplayPort 1.3 or DisplayPort 1.2a.\nDoes Thunderbolt 3 support an external 5k display? \nSpecifically, is this bandwidth enough to support 5k resolution at 60 hz?\nUpdate, 16 Jan 2016: According to this MacRumors article \"Apple may wait until at least Cannon Lake chipset (which promise SST 5K support) in the second half of 2017, before releasing a 5K Thunderbolt Display\"\n\nA: A lot depends on the manufacturer of monitors. Clearly, Intel is backing this as the display technology going forward and Apple is also clearly on board.\n\n*\n\n*Using 4K displays and Ultra HD TVs with your Mac - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202856\nI think it's early to talk about what a 5k display means - so forgive me if you have a specific resolution and monitor in mind. Apple pulled punches to make their 5K iMac work since the GPU/controller/cables are all internal and they don't have to interoperate. The industry will have to standardize a bit for us to all be comfortable saying 5K display in general.\nCurrently, you need two cables for the Dell 5K display:\n\nSome displays with resolutions higher than 4K require two DisplayPort cables to connect the display at full resolution. With OS X Yosemite v10.10.3 or later, the Dell UP2715K 27-inch 5K display is supported on the following Mac computers:\n\n*\n\n*Mac Pro (Late 2013)\n\n*iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014 and later)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) with AMD Radeon R9 M370X\n\n\nThat being said, the Late 2013 Mac Pro can drive three 4K displays and doesn't have any of the Thunderbolt 3 advances, so it's inconceivable to me that you won't get two displays over TB3 at 5k and 60 Hz which is currently the gold standard for video workflows that demand high-k displays.\nSince nothing is released from Apple saying they Support 5K, you're going to have to read the tea leaves and wait for shipping displays and shipping chipsets with Thunderbolt 3 to know for sure, but I see no reason to be pessimistic about what you want happening on any Mac that ships this fall assuming Thunderbolt 3 over physical USB-C port is part of that Mac.\nIntel states that you get 2 4K displays per TB3 connection - so I would presume one TB3 per 5K display would suffice. The single TB3 is listed as DisplayPort 1.2 but has 8 lanes of DisplayPort 1.2 (HBR2 and MST) so I think it's really in the monitor maker's court to get as much of their 5K from one Thunderbolt 3 channel.\n\nA: You can drive a 5K monitor over DisplayPort 1.2, but that's about it. This is because over DP1.2 it requires 2x channels.\nDisplayPort 1.3 enables higher bandwidth (HBR3) and Signal compression (DSC) enabling this operation over single channel.\n", "Q: Import selected items from one iTunes library to another, with metadata Is it possible to import a few selected items from one iTunes library to another, including their iTunes-specific metadata — ratings, play counts, etc?\nMy specific circumstances: yesterday, I was tidying up a bunch of my music’s info (correcting some dates, artist listings, etc, since especially for classical music, the ones provided by CDDB are rather inconsistent).  Unfortunately, I accidentally deleted a few collections that I didn’t mean to, and didn’t notice until I’d already emptied the trash.  Fortunately, I have a backup of my whole library from a couple of weeks ago.  So I’d like to restore the deleted albums from the backup, but not the whole library, since I don’t want to lose the work I did yesterday.\n\nA: What you're asking, technically, can be done however not automatically.  In other words you'd have to add back the songs to the Library and then manually edit the \"iTunes Music Library.xml\" file to restore the non-encapsulated meta data.\nI'd first manually restore the hierarchal folder structure as needed, that's missing, into the existing \"~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music\" folder for each artist/album from the backup and then from iTunes > File > Add to Library... select the restored folders to bring them back into the iTunes Library.\nOkay, that's the easy part, the songs are back in the Library however the ancillary meta-data will now have to be updated manually by editing the working \"iTunes Music Library.xml\" file using the information in the backed up copy of that file while iTunes is closed and the working file is first backed up before editing. This is not an operation for the faint of heart and it's geek factor is hi.\nOtherwise, after adding back the songs your other option is if you also have your music on a iDevice you can selectively import into iTunes some ancillary meta-data from the iDevice using iMazing.\n", "Q: Bootcamp update stopped at version 3.3 I have a 2011 MacBook Pro which I had setup with Bootcamp running Windows 7.

Is it possible to upgrade the 121 GB Flash Storage in my MacBook Pro 13\" Retina? If so, can Apple do it for me or would I have to go to somewhere else to get it upgraded?\n\nA: In the past, Apple doesn't upgrade any storage as a rule. This is HDD/SSD across the board. The only exceptions I've known are:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have several internal bays and you buy the part (Think Mac Pro with 4 SATA bays or Xserve / Xserve RAID)\n\n*You are paying for a service repair and they upgrade you for free to a larger drive. You don't ask for it, but Apple asks if you're OK with a better drive and no one refuses that offer.\n\n\nYou should ask them since it's free to ask and they might say yes one day.\nThat being said, there are many third party options to upgrade storage - but you need to hire someone else or DIY on that repair.\nEverymac has a nice overview of the options and challenges as does OWC.\n\nA: The Retina MacBooks use a format of SSD that can be replaced, but Apple does not make it especially easy for simple replacement. Rather than the more familiar 2.5\" HD format you might be familar with, the Retina use a newer blade style, somewhat similar to memory modules.\nYour best bet it to look over the ifixit guides, to see what is involved:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Retina+Display+Early+2013+SSD+Replacement/15477\nAs far as I know, Apple offers repair and replace service for a Retina laptop, but I have not seen them offer 'upgrade' service. You could always complain about issues, and ask them to replace it with a newer, and larger size, but they would only do that if the part was orginally offered as an option on the Retina.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: I do have a MacBook Pro 13\" mid 2012 (no Retina), and I was able to upgrade both RAM (from 4GB to 16GB) and the drive (from the standard Hard Drive to Solid State Drive). I bought the items on Amazon and did it myself, it wasn't difficult at all (and there are tons of tutorials around the web).\nYou must check how old is your Mac: in the newest models you cannot upgrade anything (nor Apple can) because everything is settled on the MotherBoard (silly Apple rule).\n", "Q: Can I replace characters in AppleScript?

One is to use JavaScript for Automation (either by putting your AppleScript into an Automator workflow and then using a separate Run JavaScript action, or by re-writing the entire script in JXA), while the other is to use the sed and cut command line utilities via do shell script.\nHere's the JavaScript approach:\nvar string = \"SMBHome: \\\\\\\\server\\\\share\\\\username\" // this would be your 'homepath' variable\nvar corrected = string.replace(/\\\\/g, '/').replace('SMBHome: ', '')\n\nThis script uses the built-in JavaScript replace function to match and replace text using Regular Expressions.\nOn the other hand, you could also use sed and cut in your AppleScript, like so:\nset init to do shell script \"echo ' \" & homepath & \"' | sed 's/\\\\\\\\/\\\\//g'\"\nset corrected to do shell script \"echo \" & init & \" | cut -c 10-\"\n\nThis uses sed for the RegEx, then cut to trim the first bit of the path from the string.\nIn both cases, the corrected variable contains the final, modified string. I should note that, while the desired behavior can be accomplished in pure AppleScript, it can be rather tedious.\n\nA: Thanks for the reply @aaplmath, I actually just found the needed addition which is what you have and it does the job!\n| grep SMBHome: | cut -c 10- | sed 's/\\\\\\\\/\\\\//g' \"\n\nThank you for your input!\n", "Q: Upgrade from Mac OS X 10.6.8 \"Snow Leopard\" to OS X 10.10 \"Yosemite\"; App Store takes over 20 hours I have an old Mac, currently running Mac OS X 10.6.8 \"Snow Leopard\" that I must upgrade to OS X 10.10 \"Yosemite\".

Before that I had tried repairing disk permissions with out any success.\n", "Q: Internet Access after renew the expired com.apple.servermgrd certificate I inherited some months ago a Mac mini server running OS X 10.8.5  Initially, I configured it with the new network settings, DNS name, etc and all was working fine in regard to file sharing, accessing Server app, etc.  I recently ran software update where Server.app was updated to Server 2.2.5.  Now I am having some problems with this Server app.\nI know that the com.apple.servermgrd certificate needs to be updated as I see it had expired before a few months before this recent update, and I'll use the method in HT3930 during down time this weekend.\nHowever, I am concerned that this may not be the only issue.  When I restart the server and log in with a service/admin account, Server.app works fine (with the exception of using Safari and SSL to connect to the server at it's DNS address, which models the example in the write up, https://server.example.com:311).  I would expect this method not to work as the certificate is expired.\nBut, after some time, without logging out of the service/admin account, Server.app throws an error that \"multiple errors occured on the server while processing commands\" and \"a networking error occured while trying to communicate with the server\".  In addition, at this point I can no longer use Safari and resolve web pages.  I wouldn't expect this to be due to the expired certificate and SSL, but maybe I am wrong.  The server is still running in back ground for file sharing, screen sharing, etc. so networking \"IS\" working.  \nI'd like to know if I am dealing with two separate problems or if they are both caused by the expired com.apple.servermgrd certificate.\nConsole errors that cooredpond to the above error msgs.\n\nServer: Error: The server '127.0.0.1' reported an error while processing a command\n  of type: 'get AlertDeliverySettings' in plug-in: 'servermgr_info'. Error: Error Domain=XSActionE\n\n\n…of type: 'getPushTopicForPreferredIdentityName' in plug-in: 'servermgr_certs'.  Error Dom\n\n\nA: The com.apple.servermgrd certificate is only used to create a SSL connection from Server.App to the server backend admin daemon. It is safe to delete as it will be recreated. You should delete the cert with the following commands:\nsudo security set-identity-preference -n -s com.apple.servermgrd /Library/Keychains/System.keychain\nsudo security delete-certificate -c com.apple.servermgrd /Library/Keychains/System.keychain\nsudo killall servermgrd \n\nFor Mojave and later: \nsudo killall servermgr-listener\n\nThis will delete the certificate & the identity preference and restart the backend daemon, which should happily recreate the com.apple.servermgrd certificate. The other SSL using server services default to using a certificate that has the machine's DNS name.\n", "Q: Are Apple Watch step counts saved to Health.app on iPhone I'm thinking about purchasing an Apple Watch. I'm interested in the activity measurements. Currently, I'm using my iPhone to count steps etc. When I connect an Apple Watch to my iPhone and the Apple Watch collects step data, is this step data automatically saved to the Health app on my iPhone (or is it only available in the Activity app, like on the Watch)?\n\nA: As long as you give it permission to access and change data in Health, it's all (steps, walking & running distance, heart rate, active calories, etc.) right there in Health.

Either way, you can try to go to Disk Utility or boot into Recovery(like @klanomoath said) and check to see how the partitions are setup. You can then resize the Macintosh HD to use any free space, and erase any corrupt or unneeded partitions.\n", "Q: MacPorts not working after power outage during build (sqlite disk I/O error) I was building packages in MacPorts on a Mac Mini when the power went out. Now anything I try to do in MacPorts (install, clean, selfupdate) results in the following error:\nsqlite error: disk I/O error (3850) while executing query: ATTACH DATABASE '/opt/local/var/macports/registry/registry.db' AS registry\n    while executing\n\"registry::open $db_path\"\n    (procedure \"mportinit\" line 610)\n    invoked from within\n\"mportinit ui_options global_options global_variations\"\nError: /opt/local/bin/port: Failed to initialize MacPorts, sqlite error: disk I/O error (3850) while executing query: ATTACH DATABASE '/opt/local/var/macports/registry/registry.db' AS registry\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: The fix for this is actually quite simple, and is mentioned in this MacPorts issue.

It won't let me reset as the email is wrong and it doesn't recognize my password.\n\nA: You seem to be in quite a pickle. Since the email address is either invalid or does not belong to you, you probably want to call Apple to sort this out.

A few days ago, I bought a used iPhone 3GS. I need to restore it, because I bought it broken and when I disassembled it and cleaned it up, some how it worked again, so the seller didn't have the opportunity to restore it. Sometimes (I can't remember which models and/or iOS version) after I restore an iPhone, when I'm setting it up again, it requires a SIM card inside, it doesn't have to be active, but it has too be there. The problem is that I can't get the SIM card slot in this iPhone to read the card I have. I don't think that it's the card, as it worked in an old 1st Gen iPhone I have, but it won't ever change from \"No SIM\" to even \"Searching...\" in the status bar when the card is inserted in the 3GS. \nSo, my question is: If I restore this iPhone 3GS, will it require a SIM card in order to set it up again?\n\nA: For whatever reason, the SIM card slot decided to work about a day before I did the restore. I don't what did it or why it happened, but anyways it works. To answer my own question: No, nowhere in the setup for iOS 6.1.6 after the restore require a SIM card for activation, I'm not so sure about other iPhone models running other iOS versions, though.\n", "Q: On my iPad, how can I tell if a website is secure on Safari?

So I was wondering whether this Samsung 850 Pro 256GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD would be compatible?\n\nA: No, that SSD is not compatible with your MacBook Pro, as the form factor is different.

It won't boot again anymore.\nWhen I try to turn it on, it just shows the Apple logo, a loading bar and after 1/3 progress it just shuts down again.\nAfter some research I learned how to access the Disk Utility by pressing Command ⌘-R at boot time. Apparently the problem is with the hard disk, since when I try to repair it it says that it can't be repaired and needs to be formatted.\nI have an external disk where I backed up the whole system using Time Machine. I'm just not sure how to proceed now.\nAfter accessing the Disk Utility I have 4 options, the first of which is restoring a Time Machine backup. The thing is that if I try this one it lets me restore a backup only in the other partition of the external HD, and not on the disk on my Mac. Why is that? What shall I do?\n\nA: Since it says you need to reformat, what you need to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the Recovery Partition\n\n*Click \"Disk Utility\"\n\n*Select \"Macintosh HD\"\n\n*Go to the \"Erase\" tab\n\n*Select the format as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\"\n\n*Choose a security option from the security option section(I would recommend zero-pass since this is still your Mac) NOTE: If you have an SSD, the security options button will be disabled. This is normal\n\n*Hit \"Erase\"\n\n*It may take a while or be stuck. Don't worry. Give it time. The progress bars and estimated time on OS X suck\n\n*After it is done, close Disk Utility and go to \"Reinstall OS X\"\n\n*Select Macintosh HD and then proceed as if you were setting up a new iMac without your old backup\n\n\nA: Go to \"Window\" --> \"Log Window\" and try to find some errors.\nFor me helped reformat my drive to GUID (GPT) partition table in Disk Utility.\n\nA: What you need to do is reset your whole system. Note that if you did not back up applications or such, these will be gone.\nBoot into the Recovery Partition, and erase your hard disk. You can do this by going to the Disk Utility and selecting your hard disk. (Your Mac's hard disk, NOT your Time Machine backup of course.) There are a couple of tabs at the top, you need to select 'Erase' and there will be a button with the same label that you will need to click. This might take some time.\nAfter doing this, go back to the main screen of your Recovery Partition and select 'Reinstall OS X'. This might install the newest version of OS X. Installing OS X might take up to 1 hour.\nAfter having reinstalled OS X, boot your Mac. You will now be able to transfer your data with the Migration Assistant within the Setup Assistant. After doing this, continue with the installation as you normally would, and after finishing, try to see if your installation is identical to your previous one.\n", "Q: using \"old\" non-retina screen resolution chooser I have a 4k display, but my laptop seems unable to performantly use it (videos jitter, etc) is there a way to treat the display as 1080p display and let the display upscale it? Of course, Preferences lets me change the \"resolution\", but it's not actually changing the resolution, and more just changing the size of the UI. \nIt's actually sort of the opposite of this question:\nMacBook Pro Retina and 4k monitor (Samsung U28D590D) now showing \"scaling options\" in display\n\nA: I found the screen resolution options in OS X very poor.  I use a third party tool called SwitchResX.  This is a pay app, however I believe that there are free third party apps which allow similar kinds of control... but I haven't used them.\nHow are you connecting to the display?  Only DisplayPort can drive a 4k screen, so you would probably need a mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable.  Amazon have several.  The current HDMI standard does not have the bandwidth to transfer enough data fast enough to support 60Hz, which would be a smoother experience.  It only allows for 30Hz.\nThe display has a native resolution (3840x2160).  Every resolution that is not the native is scaled (due to the display having fixed pixels).  Only resolutions that divide exactly into the native resolution would be sharp.  \nTL;DR you can't change the resolution of a monitor, only how the display is drawn on it.  Get a miniDP to DP cable.\n", "Q: Speed up disk cloning over USB My MacBook (13-inch Aluminum Late 2008) lacks a FireWire or Thunderbolt port. So I must attach an external disk (Voyager) running over USB 2 to do a full backup (cloning disk with SuperDuper app). Not fast, hours and hours.\nAny tips or techniques for helping this disk cloning go faster?\n\nA: Disable Spotlight\nSpotlight is Apple’s technology for indexing all your disk’s contents to facilitate fast searching. \nWhen making a disk clone, you do not want the booted Mac to re-index all that copied content. No need. Worse, Spotlight is fighting for the limited USB to read from that external disk while SuperDuper is trying to write to that external disk. \nFortunately Apple provides a \"Privacy\" feature where you can pick a folder, or even an entire disk, telling Spotlight to ignore the nested content. In System Preferences app, in the Spotlight option, click the Privacy tab. There you can add your external disk to the list of exclusions. Click the plus-icon button and select the external disk.\nThis sped up my disk-cloning multiple time faster, at least 3-5 times faster. At first, after 10-20 minutes, it looked like 233 gigs would take 24-30 hours to clone. Then I used Spotlight > Privacy. Over 10-20 more minutes, the throughput reported a doubling of speed. Cloning took 4 hours.\n\nRemove Drive\n…try at your own risk…\nAnother option is removing the hard disk from inside the MacBook. Then use Voyager-type or such to attach to another Mac with FireWire/Thunderbolt ports to do the copy. \nRemoval is easy enough to do if you have a model with a removable battery. The disk is accessible through the battery bay. \nThe only trick is sometimes the rubber strip that hold the drive in place. If that comes loose while sliding the drive back in, things get tricky.\n", "Q: How can I take photos off my iPhone automatically? I shoot a lot of photos and videos so my iPhone fills up often.\nThe way I deal with it now is a time-wasting chore. I connect my phone to my computer. Dropbox automatically sucks my photos & videos to my computer. Then I use a mass-delete app to remove the photos from my phone.\nI know I can use Dropbox on my phone, but it takes too long for the photos to upload.\nWhat I'd like is something that automatically moves older photos to the cloud. Then I'd like to access those photos from anywhere.\n\nA: iCloud Photo Library with \"Optimize device storage enabled\" will make a copy of your full resolution photos and videos, and will leave a small copy on your device, if storage space is needed. It will not remove them but it will sync changes made in all connected devices (deletes, edits, albums).\n", "Q: Adding Gradle to PATH I am trying to add Gradle to my PATH.

When I type $PATH, I see the lines added, so I have no idea why it isn't working.  Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: The path /myusername/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin probably doesn't exist except your personal user folder is in the root of your main volume - which would be very, very uncommon on a *nix system.  \nDepending on where you've installed Gradle the proper path might be:\n/Users/myUsername/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin or\n/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin\n\nSo change the export line to\nexport PATH=/Users/myUsername/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin:$PATH or  \nexport PATH=/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin:$PATH\n\n\nA: Personally I'd not place it forward of the system's $PATH and do it as such.\nexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin\n\nIf you want it first in the $PATH, then use:\n export PATH=$HOME/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin:$PATH\n\n", "Q: Photos Library Space Usage I started cleaning up my Mac and I've noticed that the Photos App's Library was using roughly 72,5GB (info I see in ~/Photos). Long story short, I had around 8.000 items in there from the last 2,5 years; and, in there, there were duplicates, failed photos and videos, junk received via messages, etc.\nAnyway, spent about 4h cleaning and checking everything up and I ended up deleting around 3.000 items. After this, the Photos' Library shows that is using 70GB which seems a bit absurd to me (3.000 * ~5MB = 15.000MB).\nAs a result, it seems I've managed to clear only 2,5GB of space, which seems far too little for 3.000 items. I made sure that I've deleted all the items from \"Recently Deleted\" as well.\nIs there any way to free some space? Maybe Photos has a 'clean space' trick that I am not aware of, or it has some kind of mechanism to even recover permanently deleted items.\n\nA: A late thought… which might depend on how much 'organisation' you'd be willing to lose.\nIf you right-click the Photos Library & select Show Package Contents, then inside there, the Masters folder contains just the photos.

Is it going to break soon?\n\nA: There is a thread on the Apple forum, with a possible solution:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Go to \"Activity Monitor\" - you should see launchd using lots of CPU resources - and I think this is why it's crashing intermittently.  The Mac is going nuts trying to launch something which it can't and it finally resets itself.\n  \n*Go to \"Console\" and look up System Log Queries - All Messages - it's going to be pretty obvious what launchd is trying to er, launch.  On my computer it was trying to launch this: /Library/eBookLibrary/eBook Library Launcher.app/Contents/MacOS/eBook Library Launcher\n  \n*Go to /Library/LaunchAgents - you will see the plist file that the launchd is trying to launch - in my case it was the Sony ebook reader plist.  I deleted it without any problems.\n  \n*Restart the system.\n  \n*Go back to \"Activity Monitor\" - you should no longer see launchd hogging the resources.\n  \n\nSource\n\nA: Thanks for this guide, I installed Yosemite 2017 security patch and my mac would continually crash a few minutes after booting (xnu kernel panic).\nIn System Log Queries I found it handy to install several log markers after the logging went quiet. Then after the crash and subsequent reboot I would look in /var/log/system.log for those markers and read the entries before the reboot.\nIn my case, I found deleting /System/Library/LaunchAgents/*cloud* (after backing up) fixed the kernel panic issue.\n", "Q: Is there any way to change MAC-address of built-in Bluetooth adapter?

How can I solve this?\n\n\nA: I presume you mean Hard Disk space, rather than memory.\nTo do that, you need to be in the Hardware tab, rather than General. The 'Reclaimable' you see in General is just for reclaiming space that's been freed up by deleting things from the virtual disk, not for enlarging it.\nThe simplest method to use is to set the drive as Expanding - then it will automatically grow to whatever size it needs. Alternatively, you can set a manual size in the same window.\nNote, you cannot do this if the OS is suspended, or if you have any Snapshots.\n\n\nIf you did mean Memory, that's in the same Tab, in CPU & Memory [limited by how much RAM you do actually have, of course]...\n\n", "Q: Podcast sounds to iTunes I need to upload our sounds to iTunes using rss feed.Created rss feed,i don't know how can work this with iTunes.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Have you taken a look at Apple's documentation?

I'm trying to install Ubuntu onto my Macbook Pro and so far I've stumbled into a bit of a roadblock. I've also already installed Windows 10 with Bootcamp, I'm not sure if that makes a difference.\nThe issue I'm having is whenever I try to create the partition using Disk Utility it seems to get stuck at \"Preparing to partition disk\" no matter how long I wait for it. It really doesn't seem to matter what format I make the new partition, I still end up getting the same issue.\nIf anybody has any idea why this is happening or what I can do to fix it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: In Disk Utility, select the drive that you wish to partition, but select Repair in the bar with the options. Then, click Repair Disk Permissions in the bottom right. Repairing Disk Permissions isn't guaranteed to fix your problem, but it's a great start.\n", "Q: Fans activate after screen saver on MBP Every time after my Mac (MBP late 2013 with OS X 10.10.5) starts Screen Saver mode and then after some time turns off the screen (even if no program is running) the fan speed rises dramatically.\nIs it normal, or does anyone know how to fix this? \n\nA: Some native screen savers can cause this problem as well (don't ask me why). \nJust pick a simple plain one and see if it still happens (try a few of them). \nHope it helps :)\n", "Q: How to make \"say\" command speak AND output to the file at the same time When using the say command I can give it an option -o (file name) for it to record to a file. However, that suppresses the audio output.\nIs there a way to make it do both in one command?\n\nA: In one command with the built-in say command, no; in two built-in commands (say and afplay), yes:\n$ say -o /tmp/output-file.aiff Hello\n$ afplay /tmp/output-file.aiff\n\nIn my example, this introduces a very small delay:\n$ time sh -c \"say Hello\" \n\nreal    0m0.778s\nuser    0m0.008s\nsys 0m0.012s\n\n$ time sh -c \"say -o /tmp/output-file.aiff Hello && afplay /tmp/output-file.aiff\"\n\nreal    0m1.048s\nuser    0m0.050s\nsys 0m0.048s\n\n\nA: It appears difficult or impossible with the built-in say command.\nYou may be able to redirect the audio from say into a listening AUNetSend that in turn writes to disk and plays the audio; see Audio Hijack below.\nespeak and ffplay\nYou can use the open source espeak and ffplay tools to achieve this. The following command both says \"Hello world\" and creates a .wav file of the recording:\nespeak --stdout \"hello world\" | tee -a hello.wav | ffplay -i -\n\nThe command combines three tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*espeak converts the text into audio.\n\n*tee is used to divert a copy of stdout to a file.\n\n*ffplay plays the audio.\n\n\nespeak can read from a file or web page using the f flag:\nespeak --stdout -f myfile.txt | tee -a myfile.wav | ffplay -i -\n\nAnother tool such as ffmpeg or iTunes can be used to convert the wav file to an MP3 or AAC file.\nInstall\nTo install espeak and ffplay, use HomeBrew or MacPorts. With HomeBrew set up, the install command is:\nbrew install espeak ffmpeg\n\nAudio Hijack\nAlternatively, a good option is to use a third party tool like Audio Hijack:\n\nRecord any audio, with Audio Hijack! Save audio from applications like iTunes, Skype or Safari, or from hardware devices like microphones and mixers.\n\nThis screen shot shows Audio Hijack taking output from Skype, recording to disk and playing back through the speaker.\n\n", "Q: How do I connect my IPad Air 1 to the internet via ethernet without creating an AP? How do I connect my iPad Air to the internet with an ethernet cable without creating an access point or a wireless signal/hotspot of any kind?\nMy first attempt was a duplicate of this fella\nBut, there's a couple problems with that setup: \n\n\n*\n\n*Two of the core components he said are \"Needed\" link to non-existent websites (Lightning to USB Camera Adapter & USB Ethernet Adapter)\n\n*Every other USB 2.0 ethernet dongle I purchase has a driver that needs to be installed, which isn't easy with the iPad\n\n*Even in his setup iPad says it cannot connect to the device\n\n\nI'm using these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insignia USB 2.0 Powered Hub\n\n*Insignia USB 2.0 Ethernet Adapter\n\n*ASUS Dual-band Wireless-AC1900 Gigabit Router\n\n*iPad Air (with the latest software updates)\n\n*Lightning to USB Camera Adapter\n\n\nA: You almost certainly need the geniune Apple USB Ethernet adapter, because it's probably the only USB Ethernet adapter that iOS has drivers for. Even if you find another adapter that uses the same chipset, Apple's drivers probably won't load unless the dongle identifies itself as an Apple product.\n", "Q: Issue with Finder on iMac running OS X 10.10.5 \"Yosemite\" I have Finder preferences set to \"Open folders in tabs instead of windows\", but when I open a finder window I do not see any tabs, only folders and when I double click on a folder it opens in a new window.\nFinder used to just open the folder in the same window revealing the contents of the folder thereby allowing you to navigate to the file that you would like to open in the same window and then once you found the file of interest and double clicked that file, it opened.\nI would like to get back to that version of Finder.\nAny suggestions?\nEdit:\nIf I open Finder using Go to folder and choose the Macintosh HD then the finder window opens with tabs and I can then navigate to the file of interest.\nOn the other hand, if I Go to Home, the finder window opens without tabs and now any combination of double clicks opens a new finder window.\nI can live with this, I just hope I do not have some adware or something similar that has changed the Finder ... ummmm ... I suppose there is nothing to worry about?\n\nA: From this Apple Support article it's clear that the Finder Preferences are overridden by the preference in\nSystem Preferences > Dock > Prefer tabs when opening documents.\nThis seems oddly clunky to me. Apple's GUIs are usually thought out very carefully, but they seem to have made a mess of this. (Well, unless I'm missing something.)\n", "Q: Importing citation style to Zotero from Citavi I am a Mac user so I can't use Citavi. \nMy institute has its own citation style but they only provide a Citavi citation file. I don't know a way to import a Citavi citation file into Endnote, Zotero or Mendeley so I don't have to use Windows.... \nDo you have a tip for me?\n\nA: I'm sorry to say that there is no way to do that. Citavi citation styles are in their own format and there is no conversion tool.\nThere is a tool for Zotero/Mendeley styles that let's you find close matches that you may found useful.\n", "Q: Trackpad not working on MacBook Pro On my MacBook Pro, my trackpad isn't working. The mouse won't move, so I cannot turn off the Mac. Already tried a shut down and it doesn't work. I can't do anything on this computer without my mouse. How can I fix this? Mouse buttons won't work either.\n\nA: Here are a few things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your trackpad setting (Use Spotlight [⌘ + Space] to open System Preferences and use the tab and arrow keys to navigate through the options)\n\n*Try the options listed in this question\n\n*Plug in a USB mouse\n\n\nA: If you are not getting any response from the Keyboard and or Trackpad you can always hold down the power button until it turns off.  It's not the best solution however if you have no other options then its a way to go.\n", "Q: Problem downloading some urls with cURL on OSX I have problem downloading some applications with homebrew.

The number pad works in the terminal, but when I open vim or less it does not.\nFor example using less, if I type for the number 8, I get ESCOx, not an 8.  In vim 7.2 (in command mode), it inserts an x.  How do I fix this behavior? I got this keyboard specifically for the number pad.\n\nA: If you are using Terminal (not iTerm or others), there is a setting that might help. Turn off this setting (sorry, it's in german. But the location should be the same):\n\nIf you are using iTerm, there is at least a fix for vim: You can remap the keys to get this to work.

Is there a way to find out the exact date of installation of an application that was added to my phone?\n\nA: On iPhone (iOS 11.0.3): \nSettings > iTunes & App Store: Apple ID: View Apple ID > Purchase History -- tap \"Last 90 Days\" to expand view to include previous years. \nShows free and paid purchases by date. \n\nA: In the older software, there is no way of finding out exactly when an app was purchased, but in the latest software, you can go to the App Store and select Updates, then click on the top right to go to Purchased and see if the app was purchased (paid or free) and the date of install.The list is sorted by newest on the top.\n\nA: There are some dates you can see in iTunes.  Perhaps apps downloaded directly to the iPhone are not there?  I don't know.\n\n\nA: App Store functionality has been removed entirely in iTunes 12.7 (after years of their slowly weaning devices off of it), so the answer pointed out by GEdgar, while true, won’t be around much longer.\nAs for finding a download date, the closest you can get, as far as I know, would be looking through your iTunes receipts under Store > Account > Purchase History.\nEven then, this is subject to Apple’s batching together of iTunes purchases to cut down on credit card processing fees, so this will only give you a general idea of the purchase date, with precision to about a week or shorter. And of course, this is only the purchase date, not the (most recent) installation date. The two may be different, of course.\n\nA: Just had to do this on my iPad mini 4 (software version 14.4.1) so I thought I'd tell how I did it, I think it works about the same with iPhones:\nAppStore > tap the account image on top right corner > Purchased\nThis shows a list of all apps you've ever donwloaded and the download dates.\n\nA: If it is a game you can go to Game Center to find out the download date.\n\nA: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204088\nThis link may be helpful for anyone who comes across this more recently. Upon further research, I am fairly sure that your purchases include free apps, too. Apparently you are also able to view hidden purchases by going to \"Account\" in iTunes and going to \"iTunes in the Cloud\" (if that still exists in the newest version of iTunes.

I presently have 1GB. I am total unaware of what data usage is and should I change to a plan with 2GB.\nDo I have to do something to make sure I use Wi-Fi in all places that I am.\nExactly what takes up my data usage when using my phone? Is it from receiving a message, text, taking photos. Please be specific if possible.\n\nA: You need to contact your Carrier, i.e. Verizon, AT&T, Sprint etc, to see what they define as Data Usage.\nThat said, generally speaking, any communication that you send/receive/request over their network while directly connected to their network, and while Roaming, is typically counted under Data Usage.  This could be emails, websites, pictures, videos, etc. Typically when connected to a Wi-Fi Access Point then Data Usage Accounting is not counted against your monthly Data Usage allotment.\n\nA: Really, data usage is anything that do over the internet when not connected to a Wi-Fi network, when you're on your iPhone's cellular connection. Email, web browsing, YouTube, even iMessage, games played online, almost anything that requires an internet connection all consume data. If you want to consume less data try not to watch online videos over a cellular connection and always connect to your home Wi-Fi network.\n", "Q: Force Closing Finder, Deleting Files, Recovering Said Files? Okay. So long story short, I was working in Adobe Premiere yesterday and saved a video to my external hard drive and it ended up being over 1GB. I began to drag it to another folder and Finder crashes. I leave it for about 10 minutes and nothing. So I force closed Finder.\nOnly then, a folder of 15,000 photos (the one I tried dragging the video to) got deleted. At the time I noticed that the Google Photos Uploader app (which is connected to the folder) had it's contents deleted, so the app didn't work. And then I discovered the same thing happened to Adobe Lightroom. So. Everything's gone.\nI tried out DiskDrill and nothing really turned up. Currently waiting on its deep search recovery -- so far nothing. I also tried out TestDisk. It seems more promising to produce results...but when I navigated to the right spot to \"undelete\" files it said there was nothing to undelete.\nSo. Is there anything I haven't tried or am I as hopeless* as mashed potatoes?\n*Note: I actually have everything backed up to Google Photos, so it's not the worst thing in the world. But it took a week to upload and could take just as long to download...\n\nA: Ugh - Do you know specifically if you used Finder to move a folder within one volume or copy the contents to another volume?\nIf you were copying, boot to recovery and run Disk Utility or power off and run file recovery software like Data Rescue.\nIf you were moving, then finder can't have caused the issue - force quit or not. Look at backing things up immediately and checking the drive / Disk Utility or hardware test.\nAlso - you might want to be sure you have Journaling enabled on all the drives in question. That will save you hours of check time when things crash - you might lose a file, but the loss will be quick and then you can move to restore things from the cloud or the backup.\n", "Q: How do I ensure that users can run only applications that have been installed in /Applications? With managed (parental control) accounts and \"Allow apps downloaded from Mac App Store and identified developers\" enabled, users are still able to download and run other applications.\nI want to prevent this.\n\n\nA: You can easily do this by managing apps for that user in Parental Controls.\nSee this screen shot to limit apps. It is a per-app setting, so you need to maintain the list of allowed apps. The setting you posted in your question is for managing the code signing status of apps and not for restricting certain apps and certain user accounts.\n\n", "Q: How to configure Finder to let me rename dotfiles? I always have hidden files set to 'visible' in Finder, because I'm a developer and I work with a lot of dotfiles.\nBut even with this setting, Finder won't let me rename a file beginning with a dot. It also won't let me modify these files by pasting over them etc; it gives an error like \"The item “.gitignore” can’t be replaced because it’s invisible.\" Well, it's not invisible, I can see it, and I want to replace it, and it's mine.\nI know how to use mv. I am asking about doing this with Finder.\n\nA: On macOS 10.15 Catalina through 12 Monterey, you now get a warning when you create or rename an \"invisible\" folder or file, but you are not longer blocked from renaming them.\n\nOn El Capitan (beta build 15A263e), I can not rename dot files and get this message:\n\nI use the third party tool Transmit to make changes to invisible files and folders. I wish I knew a way to modify Finder to do what you ask, but someone trickier than I will need to step up with instructions if they are known.\nSome time between 10.8 and 10.11 this was prohibited and some time between then and 12 it's allowed again.\n\nA: You can solve this by doing one of the following to show hidden files (from\nhttps://ianlunn.co.uk/articles/quickly-showhide-hidden-files-mac-os-x-mavericks/):\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Cmd-Shift-. in Finder to toggle showing hidden files\n\n*Run defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES and restart Finder\n\n\nOnce you have done this, the system will only warn you when creating dot files.\n\nA: I do not know what version of OS X you're using however I have no problem renaming dotfiles in Finder under OS X 10.8.5. That said, If your using a version of OS X that will not allow you to rename dotfiles in Finder and you do not want to use Terminal and the mv command, then a GUI option you can consider using is muCommander.\n\nA: You could make an Automator service with a hotkey that pops up and asks for a new name\nEDIT:\nI did the work for you.\nAdd it to ~/Library/Services and define a hotkey in System Preferences.\n", "Q: WD External Drive Automatically Unmounts I am running OS X 10.10 on a Mac Pro and I am connecting a 2TB My Book VelociRaptor Duo to it via Thunderbolt.  If I leave the drive formatted in RAID everything works just fine.  I need it formatted in JBOD, but whenever I do so, the drive mounts for about 3 seconds and automatically ejects itself.  After it ejects I can see it in Disk Utility, where I can right click and mount it again, but it still only stays mounted for about 3 seconds.  Can anyone help?  I can't even use this drive because of this.  \n\nA: Oh!

I just upgraded to a new Mac and a newer OS X release than I previously was running and have encountered some different behaviour in Safari 8 that I can't turn off around offering to save passwords.\nIn Safari 7 you could disable auto-fill for passwords which would stop Safari ever prompting you per How to completely disable password saving in Safari which is what I had done in the past.\nHowever with Safari 8 the preferences pane looks slightly different and frustratingly enough the relevant option is greyed out and there is no obvious way to disable it:\n\nAny idea how I can disable this behaviour under Safari 8?\n\nA: Your Mac or settings are broken for Safari to be locked like that. \nThis is likely an issue with your user account settings since all the Macs I have allow you to uncheck those marks. First, try going to the Passwords tab and turning off all check marks there before returning to the AutoFill tab.\nBefore wiping your user settings and preferences, can you verify that making a new user on the mac and logging in to that account, you are seeing the same issue?\nIf it's a system issue the steps to fix it are radically different than if it's a user level issue.\nSee Isolating issues in Mac OS X and Mac OS X: How to troubleshoot a software issue\n", "Q: iOS app to map Wi-Fi signals? I'm looking for an app like OpenSignal but for mapping Wi-Fi signals around my apartment. I have also tried using NetSpot on my Mac but I would really like a mobile app to take advantage of GPS location and automatic data collection rather than fumbling around with a manual process.\nDoes anyone know of an app that can do this?\n\nA: The Fing network scanner is the tool I'd use. You'll have to pay their upgrade to get syncing of the data and some advanced tools, but the free capabilities allow you to tap on the SSID and then geo-locate the device for the scanning and save the results for later review when you are elsewhere.\n\nAs for making colorful maps, that isn't something I've seen on an iOS map. You can collect that data for free using Airport Utility - but it's not geo-located and certainly not accurate over the ranges WiFi degrades.\nYou'd want to get a tool like AeroHive software and hardware to do enough measurements to map signal levels in a building or network area. Pretty much any enterprise managed WiFi solution has this.\n", "Q: Native 5k resolution in Windows 10 on retina iMac Is it possible to run the native 5k resolution on my retina iMac when using the official Windows 10 bootcamp? Right now, it seems to be capped at 4k. I have the 4.0 GHz i7 with the m295x GPU.\n\nA: It is as of TODAY - well, for me at least. I have been stuck to 4K for as long as everyone else had, but early this morning the Apple Update utility asked to install a new version of Bootcamp drivers. I let it do its thing and... voila. Native 5K res on the next boot!\nDon't know if it had anything to do with Microsoft's own November Update for Windows 10, but I am truly happy it did happen at last (I had given up hope to be honest). Just make sure that you do NOT let a later version of AMD's drivers overwrite these, as it's likely to return the resolution to 4K. I know I won't.\n", "Q: Install new apps on iPad 1st (first) generation with max iOS 5.1.1 As a Mac hardware lover, I bought an old 64 GB iPad 1 with iOS 5.1.1 on it. Data wiped. \nNice hardware, but ended up stock with no new application not being iOS 6, iOS 7 or more in requirement. \nThought I would have to jaillbreak it to have new apps. \nIs there any other way?\n\nA: To install new apps really requiring iOS6+, I don't know.\nBut after a lot of search I found:\n\n\n*\n\n*You install iTunes if you haven't already.\n\n*You pair your hardware with an Apple account, again if you haven't done already.\n\n*You find apps with older version of it existing and working on iOS 5.1.1.\n\n*You associate it (get it, download it) to your account on iTunes on Mac or PC. \n\n*You find the same app on the older hardware (iPad 1 iOS 5.1.1).\n\n*Instead of download, you will see Install. Select Install.\n\n*A popup will appear offering downloading older version of the app. Click Yes.\n\n*Enjoy your new old 5.1.1 compatible app.\nWould love app update for older iOS by developers but don't expect it. \n\nA: I purchased one a year ago. Ignore the requirements and go to the app store on your device and search for every app you want and install them. I would not recommend buying outdated apps. If the developer allows, it will automatically ask if you would like to install the version compatible with your iOS version. This is called \"Legacy App Download Option\" \n\nJust remember the app will not have updated/current app features, You will be using old apps with an old operating system so there maybe bugs and performance issues.\nApp Store now lets you grab the last compatible app version on legacy devices\nI would also recommend using the iPad as is for a while. If the performance is acceptable then jailbreak if you want to. This will make it easier to determine if jailbreaking your device caused any performance drops.\n", "Q: Trash won't empty, and duplicates files (with one copy remaining in trash) when moved back to desktop I'm having a problem with Yosemite. It started when I attempted to move items to recycle bin, and was asked for my password. I entered it, and the items were moved to the bin. When I tried secure empty trash, it worked for a minute then froze. So I halted the trash. I then tried to move the folders back to the desktop to see if I could get the trash down to only a few files that weren't in folders (these files hadn't asked for my password to move to recycle). That didn't work, because when I restored the folders to desktop, the computer copied them instead of just restoring them: one copy of each folder remained in the trash, another copy now on desktop. When I moved those folders back to trash from desktop, they were then in duplicate. Now I have over 150 GB in the trash and it won't empty. Help! \n\nA: Have you tried secure-delete? When you go to empty trash hold down the command key. This has helped me empty the trash when it was stubborn for whatever reason. \n\nA: See this answer: Can't empty the trash after deleting user account\nsudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/\n\nAs you no longer have access to the drive that the files were sent to Trash from, you may have to force empty the Trash.  Be careful, this is a delicate operation.

But, I have a hard drive that I share with my Windows PC that I use for storing all my pictures, music, and movies. The problem is that on OSX I'm not able to make any changes to the drive. I can't rename, add to it, or delete anything. I checked the Get Info on it, and for security it says I can only Read.\nI've Googled all sorts of stuff and everything just keeps telling me to \"click the lock\". What lock?! Am I completely missing something? \n\nA: You must install FUSE for os x to be able to make changes on a hard drive formatted in NTFS (Windows) https://osxfuse.github.io\n\nA: What starsky_70 is saying is that it is likely that the external drive is formatted NTFS, and out of the box NTFS is read only on Mac OS X. But if you formatted it exFAT then it would be read/write on both operating systems without the need for additional software.\n", "Q: Macbook Air Fan running frequently and loudly Not sure if there is something running that is causing it. Here is my activity monitor.\n\n\nJust wondering if there is something going on here that shouldn't. Otherwise I'll just go ahead and reset the SMC\n\nA: The easiest explanation is that the MacBook Air is by no means a performance Mac. Their processors range from 1.1 GHz to around 1.8GHz. Some have 8 GB of RAM, while others have just 4 GB, and some (like one of my family member's MacBook Air) have only 2 GB. Graphics processing units and other parts follow suit. In short, the MacBook Air sacrifices performance for portability, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean that if you try to do a lot on it or preform hardware-intensive tasks on it, it will get pretty warm and the fans will go pretty high.\n", "Q: How can I fix missing spaces when using Dictation with MacVim or Terminal? I'm trying to use Dictation on OS X 10.10.5 to enter text into MacVim (or into Terminal). It works for the most part but, for whatever reason, those programs won't let Dictation add a space after each phrase. If I say the phrase \"type a sentence\" and then pause and say \"for me\", Dictation will enter \"type a sentenceFor me\", instead of \"type a sentence for me\". Any way to fix this?\n\nA: TL; DR\nThis issue appears to be MacVim-specific. Try using Vim 7.4.889 or later instead.\nAnalysis and Work-Arounds\nI have experienced this same issue on both Yosemite and El Capitan with MacVim-snapshot-77. For example, in MacVim:\n\nI pause hereAnd dictation doesn't add a space.\n\nHowever, I only experience this problem in MacVim and the versions of gvim and mvim that the MacVim package provides. Vim 7.4.889 (as installed via Homebrew) and Terminal.app with various versions of Bash seem to work fine for me on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan). \nIn case your settings are different, I have enabled:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dictation & Speech -> Dictation -> Use Enhanced Dictation\n\n*Accessibility -> Dictation -> Dictation Commands -> Enable advanced commands\n\n\nThis appears to be something hard-wired in MacVim. Even if you define a custom dictation command for MacVim such as \"literal space\" and assign it the space character, MacVim with Enhanced Dictation always seems to treat pauses as the start of a new sentence. I would recommend filing a bug against MacVim.\nWhile it won't fix the underlying problem with MacVim, you can work around the issue by doing your dictation in a Terminal-based Vim session using a different build. Since the problem appears to be MacVim rather than Vim, this seems like the most pragmatic short-term solution until MacVim is fixed.\n", "Q: How to access previous support articles? I picked up an older G5 with a PowerPC for software testing. Its not booting, and I am experiencing the issues described at 3 Beep on Powermac G5 on the Apple Forums. Unfortunately, the links provided for support articles were broken by Apple's webmaster. For example, this was cited at least 5 times, and it appears to be the canonical reference for this issue on the G5:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302527\nNow, here's the best part. On the new support site, there is no search box. So it appears I can't even search for it based on the previous article number.\nHow do I reference previous support articles on the redesigned site?\n\nA: If you are lost on the Apple support globe and its new appearance and older forum links are leading to nowhere, the wayback machine may be helpful:\nAbout the Power Mac G5 (Late 2005) diagnostic LEDs\nThis support article doesn't mention beeps but only flashes and colors.\nBTW the Apple support site still features searches:\n\nThe result is not very helpful though, despite the fact that the article is still available in the archive. I haven't been able to find it in the 100 listed results.\n\nA: There's always archive.org's Wayback Machine. Of course, the archive doesn't necessarily have a copy the site or page you're looking for, and sometimes images and other resources are not available, but it's worth a shot. \nIn this case, it looks like you're in luck! \n\n\n\nI'm with you, though -- Apple's support content not as well preserved as it ought to be.\n", "Q: How can I get Quartz Composer to save files after the first time? I'm learning how to use Quartz Composer (Version 4.6 (151.1)) running on Yosemite (10.10.5 (14F27)).\nI can successfully create a Quartz Composer document and save it to any folder.  However, after editing the document subsequent attempts to save it yield an error \"The document “Untitled.qtz” could not be saved.\"  How can I get Quartz Composer to save the updates I make to the document?\n\nA: After some trial and error, I discovered that Quartz Composer has a problem with directories that have a Spotlight-related entry in their Access Control List (ACL).\nUsing Terminal, you can see if a directory has a Spotlight ACL entry with ls -dle and looking for output that contains a _spotlight entry, e.g.:\n$ ls -dle ~/Documents\ndrwx------+ 303 userx  staff  10302 20 Aug 12:21 /Users/userx/Documents/\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n 1: user:_spotlight inherited allow list,search,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\n\nTo get Quartz Composer to save to the directory more than just the first time, remove the Spotlight entry from the directory's ACL with chmod, e.g.:\n$ chmod -a# 1 ~/Documents\n\n(here we remove the entry whose index is 1, which corresponds to the _spotlight entry gleaned from the ls -dle command).\nAnother way to do this is to use the Finder's \"Get Info\" menu command.  You will see a '_spotlight' entry in the \"Sharing & Permissions\" section.  Select it and click the \"minus\" sign button to get rid of it.\n", "Q: Can the signal level at which Wi-Fi disconnects be changed? On my iPhone 5s, I am often at a location at the edge of the limits of my Wi-Fi  signal, where my 4G signal will actually be stronger than the Wi-Fi  signal. However, my iPhone will remain connected to the Wi-Fi  at this point, and will only disconnect when there is no Wi-Fi  signal at all.\nIs it possible to increase the level at which Wi-Fi  will disconnect and the 4G (or 3G) will be used instead? As it is, I have to manually turn off Wi-Fi  every time this happens, which is rather frustrating.\n\nA: Not configurable on iOS.  \nDepending on your Wireless Access Point/Router you can sometimes turn down the signal power to shorten it's reach to a smaller radius.\n", "Q: Drag with three fingers missing in OS X 10.11 Beta \"El Capitan\" (15A215h) I decided to try out the El Capitan Public Beta for fun by putting it on my external drive and booting off of it. However, one of the first things I've noticed is that the drag gesture in System Preferences->Trackpad is not to be found. Is this normal? I don't know what Beta version I'm running (a web search of the build number turns nothing up about the Beta version), I do know it was the current version about a month ago, anyway the build number is 15A215h. Having to press and drag the old fashioned way seems awful, especially after using the three finger drag.\nIs the drag gesture present in newer Beta versions? If not, is there somehow that I can enable again (maybe with a Terminal command)?\n\nA: The drag gesture has migrated. It is now present in the Accessibility Preferences, Mouse & Trackpad, under Trackpad Options...\n\n", "Q: iPhone 5 stuck at resetting screen I jailbroke my iPhone 5 a while ago and everything was going fine a couple weeks ago. I couldnt update or download apps from the appstore and couldn't delete or install tweaks from cydia. So i decided to remove my jailbreak. First i tried to restore with itunes, but my phone could't connect or froze (i tried on a pc and laptop). So i tried doing it from the phone itself, but now its stuck on the screen that you also see when you update your IOS (the apple logo with the white downloadbar below it). I already tried holding the power and home button, but when i turn it on again it goes to the same screen. \nI'm hoping for a way to troubleshoot or fix this other than being patient while the charge on the battery depletes forcing a shut down/reboot cycle.\n\nA: Have you installed any tweaks that prevent restoring via iTunes such as NO PLS RECOVERY? If not, then try going into DFU mode: How to get into DFU mode and iTunes should recognize your device.

First open the contacts app and note that using the \"groups\" button in the top left you will be able to 'show' a group that's not showing. That should get back the contacts that are \"invisible\" now.\nAlso navigate to 'Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars' and look at the \"default account\" in the Contacts section, which defines which \"group\" new contacts are stored to.\n\nA: Go to the Contacts app and tap the little arrow circle in the top left.

Short of digging through an old iTunes library in hopes that the backup of an older version of an app was not deleted by OS X and then restoring that backup onto your iPad, there's really nothing you can do, other than buy a new iPad.\nHere's a good site for finding compatible apps for your iPad, though. Don't download them from the site, of course, but find an app you wish to get and find it on the App Store.\n", "Q: Periodically deleting cookies in Safari It seems as though extensions in Safari can't access cookies. In firefox there is a great add-on that immediately deletes cookies from a site after you close its tab. This is really helpful for viewing sites that require cookies, but that you don't want following you all over the internet.\nIs there any approach I could take to mimic this behavior in Safari? I was thinking some sort of watcher on the cookie folder or linking it to /dev/null/, but I'd still like to whitelist some cookies that I don't mind keeping around and I wouldn't want to add much cpu or battery usage either.\n\nA: If you open Safari in private browsing mode, all cookies you may have are not accessible. Feel free to log in to whatever site you want and the cookies only persist for that session as you are familiar with from Firefox.\nIf you want to script a periodic purging of all cookies, that is trivial if you use Automator to record the action of launching safari, selecting preferences and selecting the clear all cookies button.\nThat's probably overkill, since private browsing does about all you ask already.\n\nA: *\n\n*There exists a paid app for that on the Mac App Store:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cookie-5/id1048338802\nIt covers periodic and on-exit clearing of cookies as well.\n[No affiliation, I'm just a user.]\n\n*There is also an open source solution to manage cookies,\nthough it's not maintained anymore and — according \nthe README notice — it doesn't support El Capitan:\nhttps://github.com/nickzman/safaricookiecutter\n", "Q: Prevent iPhone from adding contacts by default to the exchange server I have my work exchange account added to my iphone.  The problem is when I add a contact in my iPhone, the contact is automatically stored in the exchange account group.  This I do not want.  Is there a way that I can turn this bug/feature off?  \nIdeally, there should be an option to confirm which phone book I would like the contact added to.  Or at minimum have an option to save all contacts to the icloud.\nInvestigating a bit, it appears that if at any time in past I would have selected the exchange group contacts, then when I add any new contact it goes to the exchange account.  Subsequently, the only time I see that contact is when I show the exchange group in the contacts app again.  \nMany times I forget to unselect the exchange group contacts and then weeks or month later add someone to my contacts which then gets stored only in the exchange group contacts.  It doesn't get copied to the icloud even!\n\nA: Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > (contacts section) Default Account.\n(Note default account also exists in the \"Calendars\" section.)\nI personally wish Apple would let you set which group, on the fly, as you save the contact, but sadly we can only change the \"default\".\n", "Q: Is there a way to tell how long your Mac was turned on on a distinctive day? I would like to know how long my MacBook Pro was on today - total uptime for the day.\nI just bought it, and I thought the battery was bad but it went on for longer than I thought. Of course, I wasn't standing next to it with a stopwatch... \nIt would be a great feature for me to track time spent on devices anyways, to see which ones I spend the most time on. Maybe in System Report, or using a tool in Utilities? A script?\nEDIT: I am asking this to do this on different computers, some built before 2011.\n\nA: I have uploaded a bash script as a Gist to my Github account at print_osx_uptimes.sh which may help answer your question, even if not exactly what was asked (which was more complicated).\nThe script will query the Apple System Log (ASL) facility for 'shutdown' messages. The 'Message' field’s values contain the system uptime as of the shutdown event, which I figured is probably reasonably close to the original poster’s question.\nIt then converts the uptime seconds to a more readable format showing days, hours, minutes and seconds.\nTested on OS X 10.10.5, but see no reason it should not work on anything from 10.7 onward (likely 10.6 as well).\nEdited code to also check for (duh) 'reboot' messages, and updates the output to show what the event type (ie. Sender name) was for each.\nSample output:\n$ ./print_osx_uptimes.sh\nShutdown on date/time:         Event                     Reported uptime of:\n=============================  =========  ===================================\nMon Jul  6 2015 10:32:21 EDT   shutdown       1 days  11 hrs  30 min  15 secs\nThu Jul 16 2015 20:47:24 EDT   reboot         1 days  22 hrs  15 min  46 secs\nThu Jul 16 2015 22:01:50 EDT   shutdown       0 days  21 hrs   4 min  28 secs\nSun Jul 19 2015 02:10:34 EDT   shutdown       2 days  16 hrs  35 min  35 secs\nTue Jul 21 2015 19:32:35 EDT   shutdown       9 days  17 hrs  41 min  46 secs\nFri Jul 24 2015 20:35:05 EDT   shutdown       9 days   7 hrs  55 min  38 secs\nSat Jul 25 2015 00:03:13 EDT   shutdown       8 days  10 hrs  45 min   8 secs\nTue Jul 28 2015 09:16:47 EDT   shutdown       5 days  21 hrs  20 min  57 secs\nThu Jul 30 2015 22:32:36 EDT   shutdown      10 days   0 hrs   3 min  59 secs\nTue Aug  4 2015 01:37:32 EDT   shutdown       7 days   4 hrs  24 min  35 secs\nFri Aug 14 2015 19:15:04 EDT   reboot         5 days  22 hrs  42 min   1 secs\n\nThe meat of the script on Github Gist is:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# https://gist.github.com/jps3/afc1e374b632e1ed1ebc\n\n# function displaytime() is a modified form of that from:\n# http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/27014\nfunction displaytime {\n  local T=$1\n  local D=$((T/60/60/24))\n  local H=$((T/60/60%24))\n  local M=$((T/60%60))\n  local S=$((T%60))\n  printf '%5s days  %2s hrs  %2s min  %2s secs' $D $H $M $S\n}\n\nfunction get_syslog_entries () {\n  syslog -d store \\\n    -F '$(Sender) $(Message)' \\\n    -k Sender Req '^(shutdown|reboot)$' \\\n    -k Message Req \"SHUTDOWN_TIME\"\n}\n\nwhile read -a line; do\n  sender=\"${line[0]}\"\n  log_entry_timestamp=\"$(date -j -f %s \"${line[2]}\" +\"%a %b %e %Y %T %Z\")\"\n  uptime_timestamp=\"$(displaytime \"${line[3]}\")\"\n  printf \"%s   %-8s   %s\\n\" \"${log_entry_timestamp}\" \"${sender}\" \"${uptime_timestamp}\"\ndone < <(get_syslog_entries)\n\nHope this helps. I tried to clean up the script and make the parts and comments useful.\n\nA: You may be able to calculate based on total uptime.\nSee this article on osXdaily.\n\nHow to Check a Mac's Uptime\nTo check your Mac's uptime, simply type ‘uptime’ in the Terminal. Terminal is an application found within\n  /Applications/Utilities/ and is included in every version of Mac OS X.\nuptime\n\nHit the return key and you’ll find the answer.\n\nTo check daily uptime with multiple shut-downs in the day, run this command before shutting down and log the result somewhere such as a spreadsheet or text file.  Then it is an easy calculation based on date and duration.  But really, unless you have poor security, there is not much need to shutdown very often.  Sleep uses very little power.\nSee this Apple Support article:\n\nStandby Mode\nFor Mac computers that are started from an solid-state\n  drive, OS X includes a deep sleep mode known as Standby Mode. Mac\n  computers manufactured in 2013 or later enter standby after one to\n  three hours of regular sleep. A computer with a fully charged battery\n  can remain in standby for up to thirty days without being plugged in\n  to an AC power source.\n\n\nA: A third party tool such as DssW Sleep Monitor can be used to track the amount of time your Mac was powered on. The application tracks power and battery use. Totals are available in the applications' Info panel.\n\nI wrote Sleep Monitor, so am bias. Also please note Sleep Monitor 3 works on OS X 10.7 – 10.9.\n", "Q: Can I adjust iPad display size to make it fit the screen better? I have an iPad mini (original model) running iOS 8.4\nRecently I have noticed many apps seem to be too large for the screen; usually the top or bottom is partly off screen.\nWhen I press the button, the home screen displays normally for a few seconds, then seems to \"grow\" e.g. the iPad in the top left now shows \"Pad\" wth the \"i\" off the screen.\nThis may have been since a software upgrade, but I can't be sure.\n\nA: Perhaps you have somehow turned on the Zoom feature of Accessibility? \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the settings app\n\n*tap general\n\n*tap accessibility\n\n*turn off zoom\n\n\nIf you need more details, the following article might help\nhttps://www.apple.com/ios/accessibility-tips/\n\nA: Check Settings->General->Accessibility->Zoom and made sure that Zoom is unchecked.

I'm running out of space in iCloud, so I decided to turn off all the backups and delete them. \nWhat happens if I click \"delete backup\" at the bottom of the manage store page? \nDo I still have my photos in the camera roll?\n\nA: Yes! It will only delete your backup. Not your photos that are in the camera roll.\nIf you delete the iCloud backup for your iOS device, iCloud stops automatically backing up the device. You can also back up your device using iTunes.\n\nA: The photos on the iOS device are never only stored in the backup. What would be stored in the backup are deleted pictures that you no longer have in the camera roll / albums.\nRather than delete the entire backup to make space in iCloud, you can choose to just not back up your camera roll until such time as you can get all the camera roll photos backed up elsewhere.\nSee my answer on How can I delete pictures off Photo Stream to free up iCloud storage space? for details.\nThings get more complicated on iOS 8/9 with the advent of the Photos library stored in iCloud. You'd want to upload a picture from your phone showing the iCloud usage:\n\nSettings > iCloud > Storage > Manage Storage\nIf you have an iCloud Photo Library at the top like I do above, then go to Settings > iCloud > Photos to check if your photos on that phone are part of the cloud.

Then you could go from HDMI to Thunderbolt?\nCould this work?\n\nA: No. \nThunderbolt is a protocol for combining PCI express data with DisplayPort video protocols. (i.e. super high speed - low latency protocol for display, networking, data and power transfer)\nUSB is a serial protocol for increased speeds and backwards compatibility with USB 2.0 and 1.1 It doesn't include PCI express or DisplayPort but does have data and power transfer capabilities.\nDisplayPort can carry HDMI signals since it is basically a more capable / flexible standard. HDMI cannot accommodate DisplayPort though. Think of a pickup truck and a motorcycle. You can put some motorcycles in some trucks, but generally never the reverse. \nUSB Type-C is a physical connector that can be used for USB as well as Thunderbolt 3 protocols which is confusing to say the least to many. The DisplayPort embedded over USB 3.1/Type-C is something that's ready today and makes it less necessary to have thunderbolt for many video applications today on the newest hardware.\n", "Q: How to backup and restore MBP hard drive before reinstalling OS X?

They appear to use information from the iTunes database/Library so how could they know anything about some random folder in your computer?\nYou could though simulate it using either Folder Actions or launchd but neither is perfect.\nFolder Actions only works for new files in a directory and it provides the list of files added to the program/script you will run so you know what's changed. \nlaunchd on the other hand will run your script/app whenever anything changes in the folder(s), you can monitor mupltiple, but it will not tell you which path changed or how - added or removed etc.\nI would go with launchd personally.

That places them in a \"no thumbnail\" / no preview state. If that's not enough, look over your current Deleted Items online directly from the cloud using https://www.icloud.com/#photos\nThat way, you know you are working with the authoritative version of all photos stored in iCloud.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete anything you don't need from deleted items to make sure your account is working and make it easy to permanently delete the offending images you want really purged.\n\n*Delete the images you want - follow up with purging them from Deleted Items.\n\n*Check your devices to make sure they followed the cloud deletion and don't have any stragglers.\n\n\nPay attention to the message that arrives when you delete an item. If it says it will be deleted on all devices, you know that device is in sync. If not, you will have to patrol all devices. This is easier by going to Settings - https://www.icloud.com/#settings - and making a check list of all the devices that could have your Photos from the stream.\n\nA: First, for your picture to arrive at other Apple devices you'll have to have either \n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Photo Library on or\n\n*My Photo Stream on with automatic upload on the device that took the picture or\n\n*A shared album and iCloud Photo Sharing on \n\n\nOn the first case, deleting a picture from your Camera Roll will delete it from any device with the same Apple ID. \nIn the second scenario deleting a picture will pop up a message that warns you that\n\nThe photo will also be deleted from Photo Stream on all your  devices\n\n\nIf you delete it, it will remove it from Photo Stream an all connected devices. \nBut it won't remove it from the Camera Roll on iOS if someone already made a copy there, nor it will remove it from the library on iPhoto if you have \"Automatic Import\" switched on or Photos app on OS X with \"Copy items to the Photos library\" on. Same on Windows with iCloud.\nThe only way I can think it won't import to computers set up as described is that they were turned off or offline when the picture was deleted from Photo Stream, so there wasn't time for them to download and copy to the main library. I'm not sure if you need iPhoto or Photos open on OS X for the importing to happen.\nOn the third case, removing a photo from a shared album will remove it from all associated devices, if you are the owner of the album.\nAs suggested by @bmike, you should go check if the picture is available at icloud.com.\nIt should look something like this:\n\nYou have to enter this address in a computer, as an Apple iOS device won't let you enter. \nClick on the \"Photos\" icon and see what you can find there.

This feature is invisible and you have to know it's there.\n\nTo shuffle songs within a genre in your library, do the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Tap the \"My Music\" tab.\n  \n*Tap the selection in the divider at the top between \"Recently Added\" and the music list.  A drop down will appear where you can\n  select a means to sort.  Select \"Genre\".  You can use this same method\n  to shuffle within other sorting schemes (artists, albums, etc.)\n  \n*Scroll to your desired Genre.  Tap the IMAGE (or gray square) to the left of the Genre name, not the name itself.  A song within that\n  genre should start to play.\n  \n*When you tap the currently playing song name at the bottom, the currently playing song will expand up.  Make sure the Shuffle icon is\n  lit at the bottom. \n  \n*THAT'S IT!  Enjoy!

However, my macbook is early 2008 and can only run Lion (which I believe is due to graphic requirements). \nI have read David Anderson's reply with regard to upgrading the later 2008 macbook but Apple's support site re boot camp does not include my model macbook as being compatible with Windows 10. \nHowever, the Windows 10 notification in Windows 7 tells me that all drivers etc. are compatible. \nThe catch 22 seems to be Windows 10 is happy with my Mac but OS X isn't willing to load the Windows 10 drivers from Lion.\nCan someone report success or failure or point me a path to get Windows 10 running on an Early 2008 MacBook?\n\nA: I upgraded to Windows 10 before Microsoft notified me to do so. I did not have a Product Key. I was able to boot the computer, but I had many problems. Windows 10 did activate. This allowed me to erase Windows and do a clean install. This resulted in an installation where the earlier problems did not reappear. \nWhen I installed previous versions of Windows, I did not allow updates until I had installed the Boot Camp Support Software (BCSS). Windows 10 started downloading updates early, before I was able to install the BCSS. Some updates were drivers that failed to properly install. \nI easiest way to fix this problem was to deny the computer access to the internet until I could install the BCSS. If you wait for the Windows installation to complete, you will have to create a local (offline) account. Once the BCSS is installed, you can connect to the internet and switch to a Microsoft (online) account. The window where you would make the switch is shown below.\n\nThe other option is to switch to audit mode during the Windows installation. This will allow the BCSS to be installed before you create your account. You and then enable access to the internet and complete the Windows install by directly creating a Microsoft account.\nThe BCSS for your Mac can be found at Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033. These drivers are for a 32 bit version of Windows 7. I assume you are running the 32 bit version of Window 7 and desire to upgrade to the 32 version of Windows 10. If not, let me know. You may be able to upgrade to a 64 bit version of Windows 10 for free.\nIf you do a clean install, you will probably need to run the BCSS in Compatibility mode. Right click on the icon next to the \"setup\" application and select properties. Next, click on the Compatibility tab. Mark the check box for \"Run this program in compatibility mode for: Windows 7\". Finally, click the \"OK\" button.\nAlso, note that if you have Windows 10 Pro or better, you can disable automatic downloading and installing of updates. You can also review and selectively disable (hide) updates.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use more than the allocated base amount of video memory?

I've been tempted to just turn it off completely but it's about as handy as it is annoying. \nAlso find that when I need to turn DND mode off I forget on 1 device or more causing some annoyance if I actually need the notifications. \nIdeally I'd like to be able to activate DND mode globally from my MBP.\nI'm curious if anyone else has seen a possible solution to this. \n\nA: This now happens by default.

Regrettably I'm using a WD EX2 on my bridged home network (current and 4th gen Airport Extremes), and the finder doesn't refresh my AFP volumes. The NAS is attached on the 4th gen APE.\nAnyone have a solution? I've been relaunching the finder and/or connecting/disconnecting. I'm using 10.10.5 on a late 2012 mac mini. Thank you.\n\nA: I'm going to throw this out here as a workaround if you can't find a better solution.  Many years ago I had a similar situation and this was an issue with the version of Mac OS X at the time and Network Drives and the lack of a Refresh command in Finder, which it still doesn't have.  My workaround solution then was an AppleScript that I saved as an application and put it in the Finder Toolbar.  You could even use it in an Automator Service in Finder and also assign a keyboard shortcut to it if you want.\nWhat this AppleScript does is creates a hidden file named \".refresh.tmp\" and then deletes it, causing the Finder window to refresh/update.\nMy Refresh Finder AppleScript Code:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    try\n        delete (make new file at (front window) with properties {name:\".refresh.tmp\"})\n    end try\nend tell\n\nI'm also including some AppleScript code I found on StackOverflow and has been posted on AskDifferent as well although I believe it originated on StackOverflow. Not that any of that really matters other then to give credit to someone other then me for it as I didn't write the code below.  It causes all Finder windows to refresh by toggling the View state between Icons and List views.\nI use both, because when I have lots of Finder windows open I prefer to use my original solution on the Finder Toolbar, creating/deleting the hidden file, as it's much quicker and usually at that point my focus is on a single Finder window.  I have the Automator Service set to use a keyboard shortcut and the script I found on StackOverflow. Obviously you're free to choose how to use or not any of what's provided here.\nRefresh Finder AppleScript Code found at: Automator Command to Refresh ALL Finder/all Finder Windows\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theWindows to every Finder window\n    repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows\n        set this_item to item i of theWindows\n        set theView to current view of this_item\n        if theView is list view then\n            set current view of this_item to icon view\n        else\n            set current view of this_item to list view\n\n        end if\n        set current view of this_item to theView\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nEither one of these AppleScripts can be saved as an AppleScript Application and or an Automator Service, the latter of which a keyboard shortcut can be assigned.\nAlso, as I do not like the generic icon assigned to either, I added a custom .icns file from the Internet, in this case a refresh symbol. (A .png file can be used as well.)\nCreating the Refresh Finder AppleScript Application\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Script Editor (or AppleScript Editor if applicable).\n\n*Copy and paste either of the scripts, from above, into the Untitled document window and then press Compile.\n\n*Press ⌘S to save and set the File Format: to Application saving it in the Applications folder as Refresh Finder.\n\n*Give the Refresh Finder application bundle a custom icon.

I opened the downloaded \"Iconsmind-Outline-Refresh.icns\" file in Preview and copied it, pressing ⌘AC and then pasted it into the Get Info sheet of the Refresh Finder.app by first selecting the little icon in the upper left corner of the Refresh Finder Info sheet then pressing ⌘V. (In Applications select the Refresh Finder.app and press: ⌘I)\n\n*Now drag and drop the Refresh Finder application bundle from the Applications folder onto the Finder Toolbar where you would like it to be.\nIt's now ready to be used, click the Refresh Finder icon in the Toolbar and the Finder window(s*) (*depending on which code your selected) will refresh.\nCreating the Refresh Finder Automator Service\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator selecting Service.\n\n*Set Service receives selected to no input changing in any application to in Finder.\nAdd a Run AppleScript and then copy and paste the Refresh Finder AppleScript Code above into the Run AppleScript window overwriting the default code.\n\n*Save the Service pressing ⌘S naming it as Refresh Finder.\n\n*Open System Preferences and navigate to Keyboard  > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services and scroll to the bottom when under General you'll see Refresh Finder and select it.

It looks nice. Some apps/programmes though (Audodesk Inventor in my case), are still fuzzy around the icons (not untilising high res). 150% looks better for those aesthetically, but for ease-of-use, they are a bit smaller, but work-space is bigger, it's a compromise, I'll decide later, up to you really. It might be better for my cad software to have slightly smaller icons, more space, and that crisp look. At least this is a more exact adjustment than before, where it was either minuscule and sharp or big and fuzzy. 200% for me seems to be correct size and full resolution.

I have an older OS X 10.5 PowerMac (PowerPC) that needs to be online for testing software under the processor. It needs to be online because others want to use it for testing, too. I've updated OpenSSL and OpenSSH with new binaries placed in /usr/local. I also added a new Launchd plist at /System/LaunchDaemons to enable the new OpenSSH daemon on port 1522.\nNow I want to permanently disable the existing Apple provided OpenSSH located at /usr/sbin/sshd. I don't want to delete it or replace it because that often causes more trouble than its worth. A search with http://www.google.com/search?q=apple+disable+sshd+site:apple.com appears to reveal no support documents on the subject. I found lots of discussions about updating OpenSSH and disabling it through the UI, but nothing about permanently disabling it.\nI tried removing the execute bit, but that did not work. After reboot, Launchd still managed to start sshd. Other thoughts include a filesystem extended attribute to deny access to it.\nHow do I safely and permanently disable the existing OpenSSH daemon?\n\nA: The most simple way to disable the Apple provided sshd without removing or replacing it is just renaming it:\nsudo mv /usr/sbin/sshd /usr/sbin/sshd.old\n\nAdditionally you may add a symbolic link at /usr/sbin/ to the /usr/local/sbin/sshd with\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/sshd /usr/sbin/sshd\n\n", "Q: Preserving \"hidden\" attribute when copying from NTFS to HFS+?

I'm using the following command to copy everything including all hidden directories and attributes:\nsudo rsync -aAXvF --del --chmod=F-x,go-w /Volumes/NTFS/ /Volumes/HFS\n\nThe F-x,go-w is there to fix the permissions from NTFS (which has simply rwxrwxrwx on everything). -a (archive), -A (ACLs), and -X (xattrs) force rsync to copy as much file metadata as possible.\nHowever, one quirk of this copy is that Windows hidden files (e.g. $RECYCLE.BIN, System Volume Information, etc.) still show up as visible in HFS+. Is there a flag I could pass to rsync or a similar command that could preserve this metadata bit?\n\nA: I don't have a ntfs partition to test it, but my man rsync documents the -E switch: \n\n-E, --extended-attributes\n          Apple specific option to copy extended attributes, resource forks, and ACLs.\n          Requires at least Mac OS X 10.4 or suitably patched rsync.\n\n\nI don't know if that helps, but it's worth a try.\n\nAnother thing to try would be to use the ntfs-3g driver to mount the partition, which includes the hide_hid_files option:\n\nHide the hidden files and directories in directory listings, the hidden files and directories being the ones whose NTFS attribute have the hidden flag set. The hidden files will not be selected when using wildcards in commands, but all files and directories remain accessible by full name, for example you can always display the Windows trash bin directory by : \"ls -ld '$RECYCLE.BIN'\".\n\nI assume ntfs-3g translates ntfs' hidden attribute before presenting the file to the system. rsync might then be able to preserve it. ntfs-3g can be installed via Homebrew.\n\nIf that fails, too, you will likely have to hide the files yourself. To do so you may use either chflags hidden <file> or prepend the file with a .. Both will hide the files in Finder. If you use the terminal frequently, you may prefer prepending the ., as it also hides the files from regular ls output (without the -a switch)\n", "Q: Can someone help me evaluate if this is a scam for Mac support? My father-in-law purchased a $400 lifetime support contract with a company (Cyber PC Experts).\nRecently his computer has been acting up—running very slowly—so he requested support. The service tech took control of his computer remotely (from India) and pretty much fixed the issue.\nA few days later, he gets an email from them saying that they need to check his computer again because it was hacked.\nThey did a few things to his computer while he was watching to show that it was “hacked.” Then proceeded to try to sell him a ~$1000 software/config to clear current “hacks” and to thwart future hacks.\nI wasn’t involved until I heard this and went over to his computer and took over the phone conversation with the tech that was remotely using his machine.\nMy father-in-law told me that they showed him an IP address and then showed him the geographic location of the IP address and said that was where the hacker was. They even zoomed in and showed the building. It was a location in Los Angeles… Where my father-in-law lives.\nI used a website to “Find My IP” and it matched up with IP address that the tech was showing him. Basically I think it was the public address that our cable provider shows as public for our home. I tried to “Find My IP” using other computers at his home and it gave the same IP address.  So it was probably Time Warner’s data center.\nThe tech on the other end was also showing him the output of the netstat and top commands. They were telling him that there were a lot of “sleep”-ing processes and that supposeduly means his computer has been compromised. They also said that the high % of idle CPI cycles means that the computer was slowing down.\nSo, I basically kindly declined to buy the ~$1000 software to clean out his computer and prevent future hacks.\nAm I right to call their bluff? Has anyone else encountered this kind of scam before?\n\nHere are some report on Cyber PC Experts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Complaint / review: Cyber PC Experts - Internet Scam | #1299834\n\n*Cyber PC Experts Reviews | Scambook\n\nA: My wife was subjected to a similar scam while I was away on a business trip.  By letting a remote user install software that (they say) enables them to provide them with tech support, you have actually enabled them to install anything they like, for example, a program to trap keystrokes while you are typing passwords.\nThe only safe response is to delete and reinstall the OS from a new download and also reinsatall all applications, and then to restore only personal data files (no executable files) form the backup, as you have already been advised.\nThe scammers are relying on the fact that most users will not know what hidden viruses look like in netstat or a top.   (If the computer really had been hacked, then netstat and top would probably have been replaced by hacked versions that did'no show the virus activity.)  SLEEPING processes, as has been said, are absolutely the norm.\n\nA: Technically they are entirely correct that the PC has been compromised, and that the one who compromised it was your father in law, therefore using your father in law's IP. \nBy allowing a malicious third party (Cyber PC Experts) direct access to the PC/Mac, the Mac has been compromised, and must be reinstalled from scratch.\nThere are several warning signs:\n\n\n*\n\n*They deliver lots of \"proof\" even tough all of it sounds somewhat fishy. If called out on one, they just offer another one. To someone with a software background it's immediately clear that what they are saying is wrong, so verify their proof with an acquaintance who works in software.\n\n*The cost is ridiculously high. This must raise warning flags. Any consumer protection software package is much less than $100 per year, software repairs are $300 tops. To avoid this warning flag, scammers often go for smaller amounts than the one stated in the question and then slap on a recurring charge or something similar. \n\n*If you type the name \"Cyber PC Experts\" into a search engine, the 3rd, 4th, and 5th link claim they are scammers.\n\n\nSo how to protect yourself? \n\n\n*\n\n*Before hiring a company, perform due diligence first, look up the company on a search engine. If someone else hired the company don't assume they did due diligence, so do it for them. The absence of any information is just as bad as the presence of information that claims they are scammers.\n\n*If you get a blind call it's always a scam. Don't let them \"prove\" their identity with an email, because there are dozens of ways they can fake that for the average users.\n\n\nOne additional thing your father in law must do is to check his credit card statements, because he probably handed over his credit card to criminals. If he didn't, then he probably paid with a check, which carries it's own risk.\n\nA: Your gut reaction feels correct. The description of sleeping processes and idle % CPU use is misleading.\nThe description of tracking IP addresses to a single location is unrealistic.\nThe costs involved are high. For that sum, consider suggesting your father-in-law engages a local Mac expert – or go to a local Apple Store for help.\nErase and Reinstall\nIf possible, back up your father-in-law's Mac to an external hard drive. Then erase and reinstall OS X:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Before you begin, make sure your Mac is connected to the Internet.\n  \n*Restart your Mac. Immediately hold down the Command (⌘) and R keys after you hear the startup sound to start up in OS X Recovery.\n  \n*When the Recovery window appears, select Disk Utility then click Continue.\n  \n*Select the indented volume name of your startup disk from the left side of the Disk Utility window, then click the Erase tab.\n  \n*If you want to securely erase the drive, click Security Options. Select an erase method, then click OK.\n  \n*From the Format pop-up menu, select Mac OS Extended (Journaled). Type a name for your disk, then click Erase.\n  \n*After the drive is erased, close the Disk Utility window.\n  \n*If you’re not connected to the Internet, choose a network from the Wi-Fi menu.\n  \n*Select the option to Reinstall OS X.\n  \n*Click Continue and follow the onscreen instructions to reinstall OS X. \n  \n\nThis should entirely remove any third party tools and processes that have been installed by the support company.\nWith the reinstalled OS X, only restore personal files and documents from the back up.\nAn Aside: Distractions and Blame\nPlease do not blame the father-in-law. We have not been asked to judge the company or individuals affected. @milesmeow asked for help to decide if their decision was defensible and if others have encountered this type of situation.\n\nA: A lot of the things they said are absolute nonsense. Sleeping processes are absolutely the norm. For example you might have a process looking after your printer, and that process will be sleeping 23 hours and 59 minutes a day except for the one minute where you are printing. High percentage of idle time: There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Your Mac is supposed to be \"idle\" most of the time. \"Idle\" means your computer isn't using its battery, it isn't heating up, everything is fine. \nOf course they are telling your relative this nonsense to frighten him into handing over more money. Common sense: What are the chances of a hack happening just after they fixed an issue with his computer? What a coincidence. However, there is unfortunately a chance that his computer is hacked - by the friendly guys who fixed it. And since they are trying to pull a scam on him, they cannot be trusted. \nI'd strongly recommending to make an appointment at the nearest Apple Store to have a look at the computer, and for general advice what to do. \n\nA: Yes it's a scam.\nIt doesn't need 'evaluating'. It's a famous known scam run by a couple of outfits in India.\nWindows users are plagued by it all the time, and you can do a search for \"Windows support scam India\" to get the picture, where they say 'It's Windows calling'.\nThey get you to do the equivalent operations on Windows, - to panic about some innocent system information that they try to present as evidence of a 'virus' and that you've been 'hacked'.\nIt sounds as if they have diversified their operations to Mac systems now.\nWhy did your father-in-law get roped into that ?  Apple themselves offer a comprehensive aftercare package if you want it, albeit it can get expensive. Or you can just go into their 'genius bars' for free. \n", "Q: Why do I have IPv6 listeners when IPv6 is disabled? I'm working under OS X 10.8.5, fully patched. I have IPv6 disabled under Network Settings:\n\nI also have unneeded network interfaces disabled:\n\nWhile troubleshooting an OpenSSH server issue, I performed a netstat -an and noticed there were IPv6 listeners:\n$ netstat -an | grep -i listen\ntcp6       0      0  *.1522                 *.*                    LISTEN     \ntcp4       0      0  *.1522                 *.*                    LISTEN     \ntcp6       0      0  ::1.52698              *.*                    LISTEN     \ntcp6       0      0  ::1.23053              *.*                    LISTEN     \ntcp4       0      0  127.0.0.1.23053        *.*                    LISTEN     \ntcp4       0      0  127.0.0.1.631          *.*                    LISTEN     \ntcp6       0      0  ::1.631                *.*                    LISTEN   \n\nHow is it possible to have IPv6 listeners when IPv6 is disabled?\n\nA: Because not setting up your network card to use ipv6 does not prevent applications of opening such sockets.\nThe sockets displayed as *.<port> are not bound to specific ip addresses/interfaces of your machine. They will simply listen to any incoming connection on any interface. Of course, no ipv6 connections will come in through your ethernet card if ipv6 is not set up.\nBesides that, I'm pretty sure that another interface on your machine is set up to use ipv6: your loopback interface. Hit up a terminal and type ifconfig lo0 and you'll see it having an ipv6 address assigned to it. You can also use ping6 ::1 :). In fact, the ipv6 sockets listed as ::1.<port> are bound to this interface and will only receive connections from your local machine.\n", "Q: How to find duplicate folder names and resolve naming conflicts in OS X? I have my music collect on my NAS and would like to copy it to my laptop. When I try to copy the music folder and paste it to a new location on my laptop I get messages that OS X can't paste the folder to the new location because a folder with the same name already exists.\nFor example, let's say I have the following two folders:\n/Music/311/horrible album\n/Music/311/Horrible Album\nAs it stands right now, both folders are sitting on my NAS. When I try to copy the Music folder over to my laptop, I get a message that OS X won't allow this because of the above folders have the same name.\nEach time I try this whole copy/paste thing I'm getting the same error message, find the conflict, move the files from one folder to the other, delete the original folder and then try again only to have another conflict.\nSo...I'm trying to find an application or script that could scan my iTunes music folder and see where I have these conflicts so I can actively go in and fix them so that the copy/paste thing will work without errors.  I'm a bit of a newbie with Terminal but willing to give it a try.\nSystem specs:  \nLatest OSX 10.10.4\nLastest iTunes 12.2.1.16\nOld Macbook Pro\nSynology DS213J  \n\nA: You can do this in bash to identify which files and folders are problematic:\nfind /path/to/remote/library | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq -d\n\nThis will output all lower case files and folders that have a duplicate with upper case letters.\n\nA: a very unix answer by madmax1 - he is suggesting that you force all file names to lower case on your source disk, then copy .. but his command will fail if both files are in the same folder .. if in different folders on the source disc, no problem. But then, if you copy both files from diff folders on the NAS to the same folder on the destination disk the second one to be copied will overwrite the first one. Maybe not what you wanted.\nYou could look at the CPIO command .. or the -cpio argument for the \"find\" command for the filename handling options .. you can copy and rename in one blow as it were .. but this are command line options.\n**\nMy first try at an answer missed the point I think .. your problem is not duplicates, it is mixed case filenames. This happens when the file system you are trying to copy the files to does not understand upper/lower-case file names.\nYou can check this in Disk Utility .. if your destination disk/partition is \n\nFormat : Mac OS Extended Journaled\n\nthen it cannot handle mixed case names.\nIf it says \n\nFormat : Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled)\n\nthen it can. You can use Disk Utility to reformat the partition to add case sensitivity, which will erase everything on it so .. careful!\nAnother way to attack this is get a really good renaming program to process the filenames on the source disk to be unique and acceptable to the destiation disk's formatting. I like .. i mean REALLY LIKE .. \"A Better Finder Rename\" .. an awsum GUI solution to text processing batches of filenames in all ways.\n** now back to the original answer **\nThere are a few good duplicate file detectors with GU Interface out there. I like Jaikoz for music files myself .. it is a full service music catalog with duplicate resolution and name correction .. so serious overkill for your needs probably, and you have to pay for it.\nI also have Gemini from the people that make CleanMyMac .. both helpful programs IMHO. \ngoogling for \n\nmac os x duplicate file detector\n\nor searching for \"duplicate\" in the app store will provide you many alternatives\n", "Q: Why gaming with mouse feels so weird? I recently bought a macbook pro retina 2012 and later tried some fps game, e.g. Team Fortress 2. I plugged an usb mouse and noticed my it's movement is kinda weird or like unresponsive or something. It seems like my mouse movement has some kind of inertia, smoothing, acceleration or something, but it doesn't feel comfortable when gaming. Sometimes even a touchpad seems easier to play with. What am I experiencing and how can I make it like in windows?\n\nA: OS X has a bit of mouse input lag and acceleration.\nYou can fix this by installing SmoothMouse. It works great for me in CS:GO. You can enable and disable it separately for the mouse and trackpad from the preference pane.\n", "Q: Adjust video playback color, contrast, and gamma on Mac? On Windows, the NVIDIA control panel provides some features that I use a lot when watching movies; you can adjust the gamma and other settings, such as dynamic contrast and color enhancement. I've been using these for a while as they make a big difference with Dark Movies. These settings, I assume are somehow magically \"better\" than directly adjusting settings in a video player software. The settings only affect video playback and not the Desktop colors or other applications. (This is not a critical feature for me to have but I'm just mentioning it so people know what I'm talking about)\nWhat would be the equivalent to this on a mac?\n\nA: Go to your system's display setting and navigate to the color tab.\nClick Calibrate and follow the process to set the display up as desired. In the end, it asks you for a name for the new display profile and saves it so you can easily switch between profiles.\n", "Q: Running 10.11 in VM Ware Fusion with 10.10 Host I run 10.11 public beta in a VM with VMware Fusion 7.1.2 with my rMBP 2015.

However, this time, all of my precious photos from before my son's birth until now, 8 months later, are completely gone. Is there any way to recover them? The only information that the \"Photos Library\" is reflecting are a handful of random photos from 2008-2013. \n\nA: As Tetsujin said, I agree that we cannot help much with the information provided.  But I'd be surprised if they were gone (reasoning at end).  However I will make an assumption that you have a photo library in /Users/username/Pictures/Photos in Library.photoslibrary  \nI would right click on the \"Photos in Library.photoslibrary\" file - select \"show package contents.\"  Go the the folder \"Masters\" and see if you can find your pictures in there.  Do this for both where you copied the folder to and where you copied the folder from. \nYou can also search in here for something like *.JPG or *.JPEG or type JPG and select kind: JPEG Image.  \nAnyways, if the images are no longer stored in the package contents of either where you copied it from or where you are copying them to, unfortunately without significantly more advanced methods, they are most likely gone.  However most protocols do a write, verification, then delete, so I'd expect that the file is just not configured properly for Photos to read and your pictures are still there, just the Photos app isn't seeing them.  For example in terminal when you execute a \"mv\" command you are actually doing: \nrm -f destination_path && \\\ncp -pRP source_file destination && \\\nrm -rf source_file\n\nNotice the &&.  The destination file is deleted no matter what if it's already there (overwriting a file, so if the copy fails that file is still removed).  The copy, however, must be successful before the source file is deleted.  It doesn't follow symbolic links, but Photos used Hardlinks to migrate from iPhotos to Photos to save space.  So this is not an issue.\n", "Q: Exclamation mark over messages icon I have an exclamation mark showing over my messages icon on my iPhone and it wont let me access messages.

It looks like my hard drive has crashed. Is there some way that I could recover my data? \n\nA: Did you do anything special before the problem showed up? Like performing an osx update? I'm asking because I experienced my SSD going completely dead after an osx update myself before.\nIt might be the disk is broken, especially indicated by the disk not showing up in internet recovery.\nIf you feel comfortable with it, I'd advise you to boot up a Linux live distribution of your choice and check if it is able to detect and mount the drive. If it's not detected, professional disk recovery services are likely your only chance. If Linux is able to mount or at least detect it, you should be able to repair it or at least rescue your data. There are tons of sources on how to repair/rescue hfs+ partitions from within Linux, such as this.\nIf you don't want to go this route, you can always head to your nearest Apple store and let them determine the issue. While they might not fix it (for free), you'll at least know whats going on and if data recovery is an option.\n\nA: If booting to Internet Recovery fails, you are correct in thinking the next step is to back up any data that is accessible.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the HD from the Mac and read the files from another computer.\n\n*Boot in to target disk mode and access the files from another computer.\n\n*Bring a USB drive that you know is bootable by your hardware and boot to it.\n\n*Bring the Mac to network with a net boot server (OS X server, Deploy Studio, other...) and boot it that way\n\n*Cross your fingers and try internet recovery (or try another network if recovery tries internet automatically)\n\n\nEach of the above needs additional tools or knowledge or support, but the common problem in this case is storage or system failure.\n", "Q: Unwanted programs at startup How do I turn off the background functions at startup (in my case, Creative Cloud, Evernote, Dropbox, et cetera) that cause my OSX hard drive to run hot, so that they don't cause this problem in the first place?\nSo far, I've been forced to let them load and then turn them off one by one afterward.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences -> Users and Groups.\nOn the left sidebar click on your user name and then Login Items.\nIn that window you can configure which apps to run automatically at startup (click on + and - at the bottom to add or remove apps).\nPlease note: many of these apps (such as Creative Cloud or Dropbox) have their own switch.

According to:\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html\nI can get Python 3 and live long and prosper, BUT it is not clear what happens when I want to upgrade using the next DMG.  As an example I can tell you what happens with R on OS X: you get a GUI in /Application and stuff in /Library/Frameworks.  On upgrade the GUI is upgraded and the new framework is placed in the /Library/Frameworks directory, side by side with the old (there is a nice ‘current’ symlink that makes sure that the old stuff is ignored).  I always delete the old stuff to avoid accumulating crud, and that’s it.  Would this approach work for Python?\n\nA: I personally use Homebrew, which is a very nice package manager.\nIf you want to give this a try, first of all make sure you have the XCode Command Line Tools installed on your Mac.\nThen install Homebrew by typing\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nin the Terminal.\nHomebrew will place its \"Cellar\" (the set of all the packages you installed with Homebrew) in /usr/local/Cellar.\nNow, about Python 3, once Homebrew is installed simply type\nbrew install python3\n\nand there we go.

Anaconda comes with Anaconda Navigator which helps you load python packages and comes also with Spyder 3. A Python IDE type of app. \n", "Q: How do Macs calculate the amount of Hard Drive space left? What kind of algorithm do they use to see how much space is left? I thought that maybe the amount of space it began with is programmed in and then the size of files created is then subtracted from the total amount.\nP.S: This is a Mac question or a programming question?\n\nA: Your question is hard to answer because you don't mention the layer you are looking at.\nThere at least four layers to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware layer  \nUsually the hardware consists of some administrative blocks, the \"payload\" blocks and some spare blocks. A hard drive contains some dozen and an SSD drive up to 15% of the official size of spare/reserve blocks. Bad blocks are remapped to the spare/reserve blocks by the drive's firmware. The operating system only knows the size of the payload blocks. Some low-level disk tools (e.g. Spinrite) may read out the number of available spare blocks.\n\n*Partiton layer\nDepending on the size of the hard disk - propagated by the firmware/hd-controller to your EFI/operating system - your partitioning tool (e.g. Disk Utility) may create partitions by determining start values and end values for each partition in the partition table. The free space on your hard disk is determined by the final block of the last partition and the beginning of the second GPT table (provided that you partitioned your drive continuously and gaps don't exist). You may read out the free space on your hard disk with gpt.\n\n*Volume layer\nUsually partitions have to be formatted with a file system to be usable. Almost all important filesystems contain a volume bitmap. The volume bitmap is a representation of all (file system) blocks or clusters of a volume. Free blocks and occupied blocks are marked differently. So one method to determine the free space on a volume is counting all blocks tagged free in the volume bitmap.\n\n*LVM layer (Logical Volume Manager) or CoreStorage\nThe LVM layer is an abstraction layer in between hard disks, partitions and volumes. Though determined by the basic partitions (\"Physical Volumes\") a Logical Volume may span over several Physical Volumes (Fusion Drive). I don't know it for sure, but a Logical Volume Group probably contains a counterpart of a partition table holding all informations about all contained objects (like Physical Volume(s), Logical Volume Family(ies), Logical Volume(s)). The available free space may be read out by entering diskutil cs list\n\n*block/cluster layer (this is not relevant for OS X file systems)\nSome file systems support block suballocation. In short words: A lot of files don't occupy a full block/cluster of the volume layer because they are smaller than the block/cluster size. In the free space of the cluster you may store a second/third/forth small file. I don't know how to determine this free space (probably some i-node/B-Tree magic).\nDepending on the layer you may now choose the appropriate method or tool to determine the \"free space of your hard disk\".\n", "Q: Prevent Photos, iTunes, etc. opening when new device is connected Sometimes it is necessary to use my mac to install apps being developed on to other people's iOS devices, meaning that it frequently has new iOS devices plugged in.

I have imported quite a few TV Shows into iTunes and I have noticed that iTunes renames the files in the style Episode number Episode name.m4v (e.g. 01 - My First Day.m4v).\nThis is not a useful way of naming the files as if the show has multiple seasons you can't order the files in Finder by season as you could if it was in the format Season number Episode number Episode name.m4v (e.g. S01E01 My First Day.m4v).\nWhen files are imported or if the filename is changed myself in Finder, iTunes renames the file back to its format. \nIs there a way to prevent iTunes from renaming these files?\n\nA: If you don't want iTunes to manage your files at all then go to:\niTunes > Preferences > Advanced, and uncheck the Keep iTunes Media Folder Organised checkbox.\nAlternatively, iTunes uses each item's Title to rename the file, so if you edit the info of a file within iTunes (CMD + I) you can set the title to something to your liking such as <show name> <season no.><episode no.> e.g. Silicon Valley S03E01.\n\nA: Yes, stop using iTunes.

When I tried to back up today, I thought to myself: \"I do not need all the old backups, maybe I'll just delete it all and start fresh!\"\nSo I plugged in the time machine and just grabbed the whole folder that labeled as my mac's backup to the trash.  Without much thinking, I typed my password when a window popped and ask for administrator's password.\nBut now I can't backup my laptop as it says I have only 150 GB available and my it needs 300 some to backup.

Few weeks ago I got a message from the system that the disk used for TM backup was about to die. So I used Disk Utility to create a disk image of the TM disk (on another, bigger, external disk).\nThis disk image creation happened overnight, so I didn't attend the whole process.\nIn the morning I found:\n\n\n*\n\n*the disk image successfully created, with no error messages in Disk Utility,\n\n*the original TM disk completely dead. \n(I give this detail because I am not sure of the \"state of health\" of the disk image, of its file system, etc., and I suspect that the problem could be due to  this.)\nI have then bought a bigger 1TB external HD, and I am trying to copy the content of the TM saved disk image on it, so to have back a working TM disk, but with no success so far.\nI have tried to copy the whole folder, both from the finder, with a (naive) drag and drop, or with rsynch. I have then understood that this type of \"file level\" method will not work, because of the heavy use of \"aliases\" (soft-links? hard-links?) used in the TM folder.\nSo I used Disk Utility to have a \"Restore\" of the disk image on the new HD.\nAfter some failures, I learned that I hat to uncheck the \"Ignore ownership on this volume\" box in the info of the target disk, and also temporarily disable TM and Spotlight, to avoid any activity on the disks.\nAfter Disk Utility successfully restored the saved disk image on the new HD, I receive an error about the newly created copy of the TM disk, saying: \n\nError: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.\n\nI tried many times (as suggested in some posts), but after several attempts Disk Utility still is unable to repair it.\nI am assuming that the disk image I managed to save contains damaged data, with maybe the file system messed up in some way. \nSo, before starting a fresh TM backup on the new empty TM disk, and loose all the old TM backups, my last attempt is to manually copy as much data as I can from the saved TM disk image (which I manage to mount and access via the finder).\nSo, my question is: what is the best way to copy the folders of a TM backup to a new TM backup disk, one by one, checking each time that the copy was successful, that the TM structure is in good shape, but that the \"links\" were copied as links, and not as actual files/folders, so to keep the \"space efficient\" feature of the TM folders structure?\nThanks!\n\nA: The best thing to do, to avoid major data loss, is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*copy personal files and folders from the TM disk image (they do not have symlinks, so no problem whatsoever). Obviously choose the latest backup.\n\n*from the TM disk image write down on a piece of paper an entire list of all the apps in the Application folder and reinstall them from scratch (depending on what the app is, it might not be self-contained, therefore it might include some symlinks and/or preferences)\n\n\nEven if you can successfully restore from the TM, you must reinstall from scratch utilities like\n\n\n*\n\n*Garageband/Logic additional instruments (if you have installed some)\n\n*Java\n\n*Adobe Flash Player/Shockwave Player\n\n*Microsoft Silverlight\n\n*XCode Command Line Tools\n\n", "Q: Efibootmgr command for OS X I have successfully been able to install Linux Mint on my Mac.

Is there a command tool that allows be to boot into the other option like efibootmgr or not on OS X? I guess bless cannot do it otherwise we would see it on the boot screen. \n\nA: The short answer to this is yes.\nI answered a very similar question related to Ubuntu.  Your command set the boot order as Linux then (I am assuming here) Mac OS X.  What you have to do is set the boot order to boot the OS X partition first and you can do this in System Preferences.\nHave a look at this post as it should be able to help you.\n\nA: I would have preferred to post a comment against Allan's answer.  However, as I don't have enough reputation to do so, here is an answer.\nThe short answer is actually NO.  OSX does not see the EXT4 partition and therefore you can't choose it in System Preferences -> Startup Disk.\nThe long answer is to boot from a Live Ubuntu CD (or USB) and use its efibootmgr to change the boot order.\nI am using rEFInd as my boot manager, and each time I do an OSX update or get a Ubuntu kernel update, I have to go through this procedure.

Also, can I override the individual user settings for each student?  Students occasionally use other machines and have to go through the set up process every time they get on a different machine.  That will be irritating!\n\nA: If you have no tools to manage scripts, you'll want to look into something like JumpCloud or OS X Server or Apple Remote Desktop.\nDeleting users is quite trivial to script. Adding them back in is a little more tricky as they need to be created with proper settings and passwords.\ndscl . -list /Users\n\nThe above command will list out all the users, so you can then filter out all the users you want to keep. Then you can pass the list of users to delete to:\ndscl . -delete /Users/<whatever>\n\nFinally, you can delete all user directories that are not remaining with a simple (and dangerous) rm -rf /Users/<whatever> command\nPretty much anything you can do by typing and clicking, you can script in Automator or script in myriad languages.

With the recent availability of 2 TB SSD's, I wanted to upgrade to the larger size.  I have upgraded my HD several times since I purchased this MacBook four years ago, including two years ago when I installed the 1 TB SSD (as well as having upgraded a previous Early 2009 model).  \nEach time, I used SuperDuper! to transfer the partition to the new HD (connected via USB), and then put the new HD into the MacBook Pro.  I then turned on FileVault, and the new HD partition was encrypted.\nHowever, this time was different -- when I tried to turn on FileVault, I got the message that I can't enable FileVault because the recovery partition is missing.  Using diskutil list, but not Disk Utility, I can see a recovery partition on the old HD.  Of course, I believe my MacBook came with the operating system (which I think was Lion) on DVD's, before the operating system was being shipped on the recovery partition.  I had previously upgraded the old 1 TB SSD to Yosemite.\nThere are a few mentions of this problem online, including Can't Enable Filevault because Recovery Partition Missing from 2011, suggesting reinstalling Lion.  http://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-restore-the-recovery-partition-in-os-x-10-10-yosemite/ suggested reinstalling the operating system, but also suggested that that might result in system instability in the future, and therefore suggested using Carbon Copy Cloner 4.  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-re-create-missing-recovery-partition-os-x-mattia provides instructions about creating a new recovery partition, but doesn't specifically mention the problem with FileVault, or whether following that process would allow FileVault to start.\n\nA: I seem to have solved the problem, and FileVault is processing my new SSD as I write this.  Because I did not find a complete solution online, I wanted to put my notes here.\nI followed the instructions at https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-re-create-missing-recovery-partition-os-x-mattia, basically downloading the Yosemite installer from the App Store, making a separate copy from the Applications folder in case I needed it, and then running the installation.  That post suggested that the installation would take about 30 minutes, but my installation took significantly longer.  The first pass took only about 16 seconds, and then the system rebooted, and the Yosemite installation itself began.  The initial message was that it would take 44 minutes, and the first 43 minutes ran normally, but when the progress bar was at about a minute remaining, it stopped moving, and it literally took several hours for that last minute to complete, but ultimately it did, and the system rebooted.\nOnce that had completed, running diskutil list in a terminal window does show Apple_Boot Recovery HD.  I was able to configure FileVault, and I have my 2 TB SSD.  The operating system version is 10.10.5, which appears to be the current version, having been released on about August 13.\nFinally, I would mention that I did slightly reduce the size of the 2 TB partition to 1.98 TB before running the Yosemite install, so that there would be space for the recovery partition.  However, I don't know that that was necessary, and I probably wouldn't do it next time, especially since I don't seem to be able to change the size again now that I am using FileVault.  Next time, I would make sure that the Recovery Partition was present (using diskutil list from a Terminal window), and then maximize the main partition size.  \nAlso, when I initially created the Mac partition on the new SSD using Disk Utility, I did not create it as an encrypted, but rather used \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\"  I think that was correct, but would be interested if anyone knows a better way.\n", "Q: Constant prompts for FaceTime Password, iCloud Password and iMessage Password I don't use any of these services.

The first is using the open command.\nopen -a Firefox --args -private-window\n\nIn a Terminal, type man open and press Enter for a synopsis of the open command.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: When passing command line arguments to the application being opened by the open command they go with and after the --args argument.\n\n\nAnother way is to use the fully qualified pathname of the Firefox executable, e.g.:\n/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox -private-window &\n\n\n\n*\n\n*See Firefox Command Line Options for additional arguments when starting Firefox from the command line.\n\n*It's better to use the open command because while the use of the ampersand & at the end of the command line will allow the prompt to return in the Terminal nonetheless closing the Terminal will also close Firefox, where it doesn't terminate Firefox started with the open command when the Terminal is closed.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 camera roll \"time created\" information I recently took a photo with my iPhone 4 and soon after e-mailed it to someone. When I downloaded my photos to my computer I noticed that the \"time created\" information showed a time that was after I had e-mailed the photo. How is that possible?\n\nA: Time created means time transferred to your computer. It is the time when the photo landed to whichever folder you downloaded it to, on your computer.\nSo if you transferred the photo on Monday 1st August 2015, then that is the Date Created shown.\nTry downloading an mp3 file from the internet to your computer. You will see that the Date Created is the date that the file enters your computer. While the date of its creation was (obviously) earlier.\n", "Q: Need to close Word documents on Mac Air..I can see no red dot, green dot or yellow dot When I go to full screen on a Word for Mac document, the dots (red, yellow, green) disappear, and I can't get them back.

I need to downgrade to OS Mavericks 10.9.5 from a new pre-installed Yosemite 10.10.1 iMac late 2013, can you help me out? Is it possible considering Yosemite was pre-installed?!\n\nA: The first pre-installed OS on the iMac14,1/iMac14,2 was Mac OS X 10.8.4. You may install any OS version newer than that one.\nIf you have any personal data on this Mac, save it to an external drive.\nAfter creating a bootable thumb drive using the Mavericks installer, boot to the thumb drive, erase the main disk and install Mavericks.\nRestore your personal data from the external drive. Some of the data (Photos library, probably your Mail data) - if you had any - is not backward compatible with the apps (iPhoto, Mail) used in Mavericks.\n\nA: The short answer is – yes, you can.\nThe not-so-short answer is, it's messy. You can't downgrade, according to all the problems I had with personally trying to. But then I found a working method which I carried out on my own Mac. Sure, it worked, but my Mac is different from yours. It should work, but there's not 'warranty'. As long as you have all your files backed up to an external hard drive, you should be good.\nIf you want, you can just try to downgrade using a Mavericks installation package.\nNonetheless, here's my working method. Prepare...\nFirst, find an image of OS X Mavericks that you want to downgrade to. Right click on it and select Show Package Contents >> Contents >> SharedSupport and extract InstallESD.dmg to the Desktop. Now convert it to a bootable image (it's hard, but feasible). Transfer the bootable to an external hard drive.\nThen you've gotta back up your Mac using TimeMachine.\nThen go into Recovery Mode by restarting your Mac and holding down the Command and R keys before the boot sound.\nNow open Disk Utility (from the top menu), select the very top disk on the left (above Macintosh HD), open the Partition tab, and add a partition by clicking the + (plus) icon below. Call it whatever you want, adjust its size to about halfway (for now) and click Apply.\nNow insert your external hard drive. In the top menu choose Images >> Convert and find & click on the Mavericks image from the inserted drive. Click Convert and then Cancel (yes, you read that correctly).\nNow your image appears in the left bar of Disk Utility. Click on it and now drag the partition which you created earlier (should be below Macintosh HD) to the Destination field. Click Restore (and then Erase if it asks you for confirmation).\nNow wait.\nOnce it is finally over, go back to the very top hard disk and to the Partition tab. Remove the old Macintosh HD partition by selecting it, deleting it using the - (minus/dash) icon, and resizing the newly created Mavericks partition to the maximum size remaining. Apply the necessary changes and wait again.\nNow finally reboot. Congratulations, you have successfully downgraded from Yosemite to Mavericks without any hassle (might have understated the difficulty a little).\nIf the instructions I listed are impractical, then sorry for wasting your time. But be warned in advance, that 'playing around' with disk partitions is a joke of no kind. One f*** up and you might lose the Recovery partition. And that is one thing that no Mac user wants to do.\n", "Q: I'm having trouble setting up my email for my Mac, it's version 10.7.5 I received my brother-in-law's old Mac as a gift. When we tried to switch from his email to mine, the app won't accept my password or connect online. Does anyone know to fix this? The Mac still has his name and email address as the default even though I've changed to my Apple ID and everything.\n\n\nI brought the Mac to my campus tech guy, but all he could suggest was hard resetting the computer, which is something I don't want to do.\nIf you need anymore photos for clarity, let me know and I'll be happy to edit my question with more.\n\nA: First, remove his account from the list of accounts in preferences.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Mail > Preferences [command ⌘+,\n\n*Go to the Accounts tab [Looks like an @ symbol]\n\n*Select his old account\n\n*Click the Minus button at the bottom of the list to remove his account [see picture below]\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now, add your email account.  Note: Not to be confused with your Apple ID and password.  Even if your Apple ID is the same as your email, the passwords may be different.  One accesses Apple services (iCloud, iTunes etc.) the other is your email account.\n", "Q: Windows on BootCamp cannot start upon a fresh installation I have a Windows 7 .iso I always use for BootCamp installations. It works.\nI have a MacBook Pro Retina 15\" Mid-2014, and I have installed Windows 7 in it successfully in the past. Throughout the latest months, for a number of reasons I have uninstalled the partition, and installed Windows again, and uninstalled again, and so on.\nToday I currently don't have Windows installed, and decided to do so. The installation was apparently successful as always: BootCamp partitioned around 40GB for Windows, downloaded the Support Software, booted from USB flashdrive, and then it restarted (as always).\nBut then, when my Mac tries to boot into Windows, it doesn't seem to work anymore. I am met with a black screen and the following text displays:\n\nWindows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be\n  the cause. To fix the problem:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.\n  \n*Choose your language settings, and then click \"Next.\"\n  \n*Click \"Repair your computer\".\n  \n  \n  If you do not have this disct, contact your system administrator or\n  computer manufacturer for assistance.\nFile: \\windows\\system32\\drivers\\AppleSSD.sys\nStatus: 0xc0000428\nInfo: Windows cannot verify the digital signature of this file.\n\nNow, something different must have happened compared to all the many times I installed Windows on BootCamp... I do have an idea. The last installation was removed by deleting the partition using Disk Utility (instead of using BootCamp assistant). That's the only difference I can think of.\nI have read that I could delete the AppleSSD file. And I did. But now many things seem to be wrong: for starters, the OS doesn't seem to be able to connect to my Wireless network (so it seems like the drivers were not properly installed).\nWhat should I do? I deleted the partition and tried again, but the same occurs. A friend has another .iso I borrowed, but it didn't work either.\nThe problem can't be with my .iso - I've used it so many times before. It works fine. Something must be wrong somewhere else.\nI am using OSX Yosemite.\n\nEdit\nAs requested, I deleted the Windows partition and ran diskutil list:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            250.1 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s4\n\nThen sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0:\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  488555536      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  488965176    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  490234712          7         \n  490234719         32         Sec GPT table\n  490234751          1         Sec GPT header\n\nAnd sudo fdisk /dev/disk0:\nDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 30515/255/63 [490234752 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -  490234751] <Unknown ID>\n 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n\n\nA: This basically is a repost of the following sites:\nget \"appleSSD.sys\" error when installing windows 7 through bootcamp and\nbootcamp - appleSSD.sys digital signature can not be verified\nLooks like there are problems with Boot Camp Support Software (BCSS) being downloaded from Apple. Here is a solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download an older version of the BCSS for your Mac. See\nSystem requirements to install Windows 7 and earlier on your Mac\nusing Boot Camp. In your case, the software can be found at Boot\nCamp Support Software 5.1.5621.\n\n*Using Boot Camp Assistant, prepare the USB flash drive. Select the\nfirst two items and prepare the disk.\n\n*Quit Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n*Using the Finder, move the $WinPEDriver$ and BootCamp folders\nfrom the USB flash drive to the Trash. Empty the Trash.\n\n*Using the Finder, copy the $WinPEDriver$ and BootCamp folder\nfrom the BCSS to your flash drive.\n\n*Reopen Boot Camp Assistant and select only the third option, install\nWindows.\n\n\nAn explanation regarding the purpose of these folders can be found at Limitations of $WinPeDriver$ when used in conjunction with other driver injection methods.\n\nA: I had experienced the same problem after resetting my Macbook Air and then attempting to re-install W7 in Bootcamp. The default bootcamp assistant download returns an error message, so I had to download an older version which did boot the W7 desktop, but without drivers for sound and wifi. I did however have USB functionality, from this I was able to insert the USB stick with the BCSS on it to locate the Apple drivers set up. The sequence is 'bootcamp' > 'set-up'. This manual fix worked fine for me. Clearly there is an issue with bootcamp arising from the W10 calibration in bootcamp which requires fixing as its causing a lot of confusion for those of us with a copy of W7. Hope this helps.  \n\nA: All,\nI just wanted to say thanks for the recommended solution - getting BCSS 5.1.5621 helped me also (link here https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1720?locale=en_US) - I have MacBook Pro Mid-2012 (non-Retina).\nThe only other thing I'd like to add to keep this process even simpler, is that after you've downloaded the older versions of BCSS, if you already got Windows installed (it should show up in Finder as a separate drive), then simply replace the BCSS folders/files with the older version, then do a reboot WITH your USB Windows ISO flash/external drive (press ALT during startup and select the USB drive). This will automatically take you back to installing Windows. You can then reselect option to format the partition, and voila! all other steps will remain same and it should proceed smoothly (that's what worked for me).\nI mention above only because it will save you a ton of time, no need to relaunch Boot Camp Assistant, writing Windows to USB, then removing/installing Windows, then having to reformat the partition to NTFS….you get my point. Good luck!\n\nA: Here is a quick update. Currently I am running Version 10.11.2 on a 15″ mid 2014 MacBook Pro. Using an external CD-ROM drive with Windows 7. I downloaded the Boot Camp Support Software (BCSS) and put it on a flash drive. I quickly went through the process only to find myself with an error saying \"Windows cannot verify the digital signature for this file\" error. If you are confused where to start, start here: http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/. Make sure before you start anything you have the right BCSS downloaded. Each Mac can be a bit different. See this page and scroll down: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT205016. As long as you have the right BCSS and you have the ISO on a flash/external drive or disk you should be good. If you receive an error after installing Windows there is a good chance it is the wrong BCSS. In this case you need to install the most current one or if this does not work use an older version of BCSS.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 mail app delays I am using iPhone 6 native app as my email client. I recently did the latest update and I have noticed that I've been receiving my email notifications a bit late or delayed. The notifications are sometimes taking about 20 minutes!\nAt first, I first thought it was a problem with my carrier but on the contrary. They claim that it had something to do with the email client.\nI know many people are probably wondering why I don't just use another email client, but for specific reasons, this is the app that I have to use as a mail client.\nIs anyone else seeing this problem?\n\nA: What's happening is that your iPhone is only fetching new data from the server only every so often, like every hour. To fix this, go into Settings->Mail, Contacts, Calendars->Fetch New Data and make sure that \"Push\" is enabled. Some mail services don't support Push, so the \"Fetch\" schedule below would be used. Scroll down and select \"Every 15 Minutes\" under the \"Fetch\" pane. That's a fast as you'll get notifications for mail that doesn't support Push, but you can always check for mail manually in the Mail app. Also, I should note that enabling Push and more frequent mail Fetching will result in worse battery life.\n\n\nA: Gmail, Inbox and Notion apps get Gmail based email on push, as opposed to iOS Mail app that is only able to fetch it every 15 minutes.\n", "Q: How to block an email thread from notifications in Yosemite Is there a way to block a specific email thread from notifications in Yosemite without turning notifications off for email?

According to https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT202856 4k should work as expected using SST.\nAny further ideas?\n\nA: In order for your connected display to use DisplayPort 1.2 you also need a compatible cable. I'm not sure about the third-party cable you were using but I believe the Apple Thunderbolt cable only carries DisplayPort 1.1a signals. \nIf you buy a third-party cable that's confirmed to support DisplayPort 1.2, 60Hz MST should work properly.

This can make it much easier for advanced users to script their SelfControl blocks. This article explains how you can start SelfControl from the command line. If you're not familiar with the command line, this article is not for you.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Install SelfControl into your Applications folder.\n  \n*Set your block preferences via the defaults system.

There are more preferences if you want them; you can see them by running defaults read org.eyebeam.SelfControl (or just configure them in the app's preferences panel). Don't set BlockStartedDate, that's handled by the program automatically.\n  \n*Run sudo /Applications/SelfControl.app/Contents/MacOS/org.eyebeam.SelfControl $(id -u $(whoami)) --install to start a block. It will automatically run checkups to see if the block needs removal every minute.\n  \n*Wait for the block to expire. If you want to manually run a checkup to remove the block if necessary, you can do so with sudo /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/org.eyebeam.SelfControl $(id -u $(whoami)) --checkup. If that doesn't remove the backup successfully, you can run our backup removal tool with /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/scheckup.\n  \n\n\nA: You can try launching \"SelfControl\" in the background, then hiding it (although, simply launching in the background may be enough in your case). The idea is to hide the application once a window appears, indicating the launch process is mostly done, and the application can be hidden (which takes a few seconds.

Now press the down arrow and the contacts will be viewed as newest (top) to oldest (bottom).\nOnce you're done with the sorting, in the top menu choose and click Undo Move of \"...\" until the words \"Move of\" are gone (i.e. indicates that all the moving that you did has been undone).\n(Just a note, open the contacts app and make sure the contacts are all back where they should be.)\n", "Q: What is the netstat command for particular port if that's connected or not?

Hi I would like to organize my recent call list by number instead of the default sorting by date. Or I would like to see the list of previous calls & messages with a phone number. \nCurrently I am just going back in history to see if I received a call from someone in the past couple days. It will be great if order by phone number/contact option is available\nI am using Iphone 5, iOS 8.4.0\nAndroid phones are able to do this. It is quite useful\n\nA: Generally speaking, please include hardware and software information, e.g. iPhone 4s, iOS 7.1.2, when asking questions as not all features are available in all models and iOS versions.\nThat said, I do not believe you have a choice, at least I don't on my iPhone in the Phone app, however I have an app on my MacBook Pro (also available for Windows) called iMazing that I can sort my call history by All and Contact and by Date, Contact, Duration and Number.  I can also export to Text or CSV files.\nThere may be a third-party iOS App that can do what you want right on the iPhone.  callLog may be a possibility.\n", "Q: Create a bookmark to a site in the dock Is it possible to have an icon in the dock which is a link to some specific site and opens it in Chrome when clicked?\nI'd like to put Trello in the Dock so that to quickly access it when needed.\n\nA: Yes it is. If Google Chrome is your default browser.\nProcedure\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Trello.com in Chrome\n\n*Drag the text in the URL field to the desktop. This will create a document that ends in .webloc. EG \"Trello.webloc\"\n\n*Drag that icon into the right side of the dock (it's a document and has to be to the right of the divider bar)\n\n\nI had forgotten that you could drag the bookmark out of the URL bar directly into the dock. Do it that way if it suits you, either works.\nNow when you click on that icon trello.com (or any .webloc document) will open in your default browser.\n(This works in Safari and I don't have Chrome handy on this Mac to test. I am assuming that Chrome for Mac behaves the same as Safari in this respect)\n\nA: Since the inception of OS X, one should be able to drag a URL snippet and pin it directly to the right side of the Dock, next to pinned folders (later joined by \"Stacks\") and the Trash.\nTo open it with your preferred browser, why not create a simple scriptable program? For Safari, for example, I would open Terminal and write something like this:\ncd Desktop && echo \"#!/bin/bash\n/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari http://www.google.com\"\n> pager && chmod +x $(pwd)/pager\n\nOf course, Google and Safari can be interchanged with what you desire, and pager could be renamed whatever you want. You can then just pin \"pager\" to the Dock, (and if you want to beautify it a bit, you could just open Get Info from another file or app and also click Get Info for pager. Click the icon you want to copy and click Copy. Then, click pager's 'exec' icon and click Paste to replace it.)\nOr, if you really just don't like Safari, you can switch default browsers entirely. Start by going to Safari -> Preferences and choose Chrome as the default. In Chrome, choose it as the default if it hasn't been applied already. If the pinned URL still opens in Safari after making these changes, switch to the Finder and find a webpage, or another Safari badged file. Either by right-clicking or with the Action menu in the Finder, click Get Info. Under \"Open With\" choose Chrome. Of course, to switch it back to Safari, repeat the above. With 10.10, you might want to head to General preferences and Extensions as well just in case. But it really isn't that hard to do, and just one of the above ought to do it!\n\nA: There are two sides to the Dock, the one to the left of the Separator is for the Dock Tiles for launching Applications that are set to Keep in Dock and Dock Tiles for open applications not already set to Keep in Dock and the one to the right of the Separator is for Stacks, the Trash, minimized Application windows and things like a shortcut, if one wants.\nYou can drag and drop, grabbing the icon in the Address field of the Browser to the right side of the Dock Separator however that will open in the default Browser that is set to open \"http\" and or \"https\" URLs depending on what the handler for those type URLs are. (I'm mentioning that in this particular way because while normally both \"http\" and or \"https\" URLs, by default, open in the same Browser, they don't on my system.  I've set \"http\" URLs to open in one Browser and \"https\" URLs to open in a different Browser.)\nIf Chrome is not your default Browser or is not set to open \"http\" and or \"https\" URLs then the one that is will be the one that the Dock Tile for the target URL is going to open in.\nIf you want the Dock Tile for the target URL to be on the left side of the Dock Separator then it will need to be an application and this can be an AppleScript application that opens a given URL in the default and or a given Browser.\nIf you want it on the left side of the Dock Separator let me know, I'll add instructions on creating the AppleScript App that can open the target URL.\n", "Q: Is it beneficial to use an Airport Express's wifi instead of my modems? I have a modem/router that came with my ISP and I have two Airport Express.  I have the Airports so I can extend my signal further.\nMy current setup is:\nModem -> ethernet -> Airport Express 1      -> wireless ->    Airport Express 2.\nOn the Airport Express 1 - I can either create a new wireless network for AE2 to connect to, or I can join the modems connection.\nWhat advantages / disadvantages do I have to creating a new wireless network on AE1 vs. joining the existing one from the modem?\n\nA: The advantage is you can locate the airport potentially closer to you than the modem. The disadvantage is you need to set it up and perhaps string an ethernet if you wish to avoid delays of wirelessly extending a network.\nIf I could, I would always run an ethernet cable (gigabit if possible, but 100 is usually faster than any WiFi consumers use in practice) from the router to all base stations.\nThat allows you to choose different channels and devote 100% of the wireless bandwidth to serving clients as opposed to backhauling traffic to the router.\n", "Q: Force Chrome to use OS X notifications? I'd like to find a way to use OS X native notifications instead of the Chrome notifications.\nI have read something about using a Growl extension and then redirect Growl to OS X Notifications Center using Hiss app, but I never used Growl and for what I've read seems like it was used only on old versions of OS X.\nIs there any way?\n\nA: Yes you can with this experimental feature.\nOpen chrome://flags/#enable-native-notifications to enable the feature, then restart Chrome.\n\nA: You can now go to chrome://flags and enable \"Enable native notifications. Mac\", and it works as it should.\n\nA: The short answer to this is No\nIn order for Chrome to send an alert to OS X's notification center, an API call must be initiated - from the browser to OS X.  Technically, an add-on could be developed that would address this, however, Google seems to have left open the idea that they would be bring this feature to fruition.\nChrome's notification center is the latest casualty in the war against browser bloat\nUnfortunately, this is just something we are going to have to wait for.\n\nA: I'm adding an answer here because now Chrome on macOS uses by default the native notifications system. You don't have to perform any specific action anymore.\n", "Q: I cannot do bootcamp but my hard disk only have machintos HD and Data The bootcamp said that my disk cannot be partitioned or restored as single partition. \nI am using macbook pro 15\" but idk the version but the graphic card said gt320m 256 MB and 350 GB HDD i5\n\ndo i have to remove the data before do bootcamp or is there anything i can do beside remove the data?\n\nA: The simplest thing is to delete the \"Data\" partition and resize the Mac partition to take the whole area.\nAt that point, you are one click away from running BootCamp Assistant.\nOptions are to use Disk Utility to make an image of Data to an external drive (or perhaps to Macintosh HD if there is space). Another option is to clean as much files off Data or back it up to an external device.\nIt's really a balance between how valuable the files on \"Data\" are to you what step to take next.\n", "Q: Backup and Restore Single App After Upgrade When I update iOS over the air, the process seems to include all apps being automatically updated. \nHowever, I have one single app from the App Store (Overdrive) that I would like to keep stable and not updated. \nAfter the update, I would like to still have the same version of this app, with the same data, as before the update.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: If it's a built-in Apple app, then no.\nOtherwise, just don't update that app when asked.\nEventually, though, you will get to a point where the old version may no longer work on the new OS.\nCheck that you don't have automatic downloads set in Settings > iTunes & App Store, then non-Apple apps will not update until you tell them to, from App Store app itself.\n \n\nA: Hmm... not sure what you need, but be aware that eventually your old app may quit working with the next version or even the next 8.? update.\nBut, to answer your question, connect your iDevice to iTunes (preferably on a Mac, but a Windows PC should work as well). Hopefully, you downloaded this app to disk already. If not, you will need to find it from an archive and download it. Some older versions of signed apps may still be available by the developer, though this is getting harder to find. If nothing else, grab an iOS 4.2 or 5 device and access the App Store with it. In some generous cases, you will be prompted to downgrade app versions and get to keep the old app. Once you do, you can backup, and thereby copy that app to your Mac (or PC). In iTunes preferences, turn automatic updates and downloads OFF. This will preserve your old versions -- but beware that you will have to stay up to date on your stuff yourself.\nSo, back to the original suggestion. Connect your iDevice to iTunes. Back it up completely, then do a total restore, if you haven't done this already. Find the app that you want to restore. If there are two versions, Get Info on both to find the legacy version. Delete the new app from iOS, then drag and drop the old one. Click Sync and wait. Click the eject button when done, and disconnect your device. You're done.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: URL link to amazon page inside game Is it against any Apple developer rules to put a URL in a game somewhere, which links to a page on Amazon? and/or a link to a bloggers website?\n\nA: It depends.\nThe rules are not always crystal clear, so it really depends on what \"somewhere\" ends up being in practice. It very much matters what that URL is during review but also if users complain to Apple that you are steering commerce to sites against their will, you might run into issues.\nI would say - follow the money. If this is a sustained effort to monetize an app, you would likely run afoul of several of the items in Apple's published \"Living Document\" for app review guidelines:\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\nSpecifically:\n\nApps that link to external mechanisms for purchases or subscriptions to be used in the App, such as a \"buy\" button that goes to a web site to purchase a digital book, will be rejected\nApps offering subscriptions must do so using IAP\n\nThere will be more restrictions on links if your app is sold into a Kids rating or category. As long as the links enhance the user experience, are not intended (or could possibly be construed) as bypassing subscription and revenue functions that could be accomplished with IAP, you should be clear with general links if they are not the sole purpose of your app.\n", "Q: How to block certain IP/Mac Addresses from accessing my AirPort on my 2009 iMac? I have a 2009  iMac running OS X 10.6.8. I would like to filter certain IP/MAC addresses from accessing my WiFi via \"Internet Sharing\". I have already set a password, but I would still like to filter specific IP/MAC addresses.\nIs this possible on my iMac with 10.6.8 ?\n\nA: Apparently it's possible to enable MAC filtering using the Internet Sharing feature in Snow Leopard.\nHere is an extended description how to do it and at the same time overcome some flaws of the sharing implementation of SL.\nEssentially you have to add an additional key/array in the /etc/bootpd.plist containing the MAC as string:\n    ....\n    <key>allow</key>\n    <array>\n            <string>0:17:43:a3:2d:45</string>\n    </array>\n    ...\n\nProbably the opposite: deny/MAC-address works as well.\nPlease check the whole article and implement the respective modifications.\n", "Q: Whay does my Backspace key not delete in vi? The delete key works - delete text to the right.\nBut the backspace key (I'm using an external keyboard btw) moves left but doesn't delete (I am in insert mode)\nHowever it does work OK (moves the remaining text left AND removes one chr) at the command line itself when I use command line vi (set -o vi) and insert mode.\nI normally use tmux and iterm2 however I experimented with the basic terminal app and the problem persists (I am still using tmux though in case that is the issue)\n\nA: Is this a new keyboard? I wonder if it's outputting a slightly non-standard code for backspace, one that many programs accept, but vim does not. Try CTRL-H - that should work as backspace in vim.\nYou can find out the code your backspace key outputs by going to Terminal, then Preferences>Settings>Keyboard and double-clicking any key in the list. Make sure \"Send Text:\" appears in the dropdown next to \"Action:\" Press your backspace key and its code will appear in the box. Make sure to click cancel so you don't change a mapping here. (Mine reports \\177 on an Apple keyboard.)\nYou'll then need to convince Vim to respond to that code. This tutorial looks like it will explain that process. http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Mapping_keys_in_Vim_-Tutorial(Part_1)\nOf course, you could also look for a different keyboard.\nReferences:\nhttp://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-5.html\nhttp://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Mapping_keys_in_Vim_-Tutorial(Part_1)\nhttp://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/vi.html\n", "Q: Online jailbreak I heard about a service called JailbreakMe.

I want to backup my iPhone to iTunes but I still want all the information to remain on my phone. Will my information be deleted if I backup it up?\n\nA: No.  A backup only copies the information to a remote location. The original information on your phone will remain. The backup preserves the information, should the information on your iPhone become damaged. It also makes it easier to transfer this information to another iPhone.\nIf you backup your iPhone to a computer (connected via the USB cable) using iTunes and check the box next to \"Encrypt Backup\", you will also backup all of your saved passwords.\n", "Q: Why OS X says a low free space, despite having 25GB free?

Is it some kind of bug?\n\nA: 25GB is not alot of space on a nearly 500GB drive. It seems that OSX has a built-in alert for 5%.  \nRecall that the operating system needs to rely on the drive being available to manage conditions where there may not be enough memory to complete processes. This is what we call 'virtual memory'. OSX will swap older memory items to the hard drive if needed. \nIn addition, OSX wants enough space to provide the ability to write all of current memory to the hard drive in case of a power issue, so that you do not lose data due to battery issues. In this case, it needs at least enough space to ensure it can write 4GB/8GB/16GB depending on your RAM size.  \nAll of these items are managed by the OS, and if it detects a condition where it may not be left with enough space on the hard drive to perform its functions, it will alert you the user.\n", "Q: Which OnyX setting resets my Chrome extensions?

Is it possible to restore the data on the new computer using the Time Machine backup from the old computer? If so, how?\n\nA: Yes, you can.  When you set up the new Mac and connect it to your Time Machine backup either through the network or via cable, you can select restore from Time Machine Backup during setup.

I have a song on my computer that primarily consists of vocals. In GarageBand, I want to listen to each part separately so that I can create a piano version of the song.\nI put \"isolate\" in quotes because I am aware that it's difficult, if not impossible, to isolate the different tracks from a song file.\n\nA: The short answer: notch and peak filters. You can use the master buss EQ to notch out or boost frequency ranges that correspond, primarily, to the instrument or voice you're trying to remove or isolate. Notches are for removing and peaks are for boosting.\nIt's less than perfect in GarageBand because the built-in EQ facilities are somewhat simplistic, but you can make a reasonable go of it if you're patient.\nLet's talk about removing something. Boosting something is the same approach, you just turn the gain up on the notch instead of down.\nFirst, you'll need to identify approximately what range of frequencies you want to cut. I'll usually consult something like the Interactive Frequency Chart. It shows you, for any instrument, what the dominant frequency range it covers. You're mostly concerned about notching out the fundamentals of the instrument since they tend to be the strongest component of the instrument's sound.\nAt the bottom of the chart is the frequency plotted in 1/3 octave bands. If we wanted to, for example, remove an oboe from our track, we're looking at removing the fundamentals from approximately 200 Hz up to 1.5 kHz.\n\nThat's a pretty broad range. If we removed that much content we'd be taking lots of other instruments with it. But we can use this as a starting point for our filter.\nHead in to GarageBand and call up the master EQ strip by pressing the Smart Controls button in the upper right hand corner:\n\nSelect EQ and Master from the toolbar over the smart controls:\n\nNow add a notch filter (there are four available on the EQ strip, I just picked the one to the left because we're doing lower frequency content removal). Center the notch at 650 Hz ((1500 - 250)/2 = 650), which is the midpoint of the oboe's range. You can either drag the dot left and right until it says 650 Hz in the lower righthand corner, or you can click on the value and just enter it directly:\n\nAnd then set the gain as low as it'll go by dragging the dot downwards or entering -24 dB for the gain in the lower righthand corner directly:\n\nThe width of the notch, called the Q, is at its maximum value -- the filter is removing the most content at 650 Hz, but it's also removing a lot of content above and below 650 Hz. We want to narrow it so it's covering really just the 200  Hz - 1500 Hz range. It won't be perfect because it's only a second order filter, but it should be good enough. You can click on the Q value in the lower righthand corner of the EQ strip to enter a value. 2 is about right:\n\nWith this starting point for your notch filter, solo your track and play it. Now, as the track plays, adjust the mid-point of the notch up and down until the oboe is at its quietest. If there's a portion of the track where the oboe is the lone instrument, loop that and do your manual adjustments there, otherwise feel it out. Once it's as quiet as you think you can make it, play with the Q until it's more or less still that quiet, but the Q is as high as possible. This gives you the narrowest possible notch -- the least amount of information you can remove to cut the instrument out of the overall sound.\nRepeat, adding additional notch filters, until you've removed everything you want removed.\nAnd, as I said earlier, to boost instead of remove, just reverse the gain. The process is, otherwise, the exact same:\n\nAnd you can combine cuts and boosts to truly isolate just a small part of the frequency spectrum in a signal to study it. Though, you may find that without harmonic content, the instrument is a little hard to decipher. It depends on how strong or weak the fundamental of the instrument is in relation to the harmonic overtones it produces.\nSome good old trial and error, using your ears as your guide, is the best teacher here.\n", "Q: How to get MacBook Pro(early 2011,13 inches) logic board schematic? I destroyed my laptop i.e. Macbook pro early 2011-13 inches, last night. The computer works fine and has 50% charge left in the battery. But despite showing \"Magsafe connected\" on the screen it shows \"Battery is not charging\". So I went to my friend and got his charger, However, I got the same message again.  \nThus, I thought its a problem with logic board. I youtubed and found something worthwhile.   \nAt the moment I need Schematic of MacBook Pro Logic board to study the circuit and fix it.  How can I get this schematic?\n\nA: \"Silviu St\" tho a tad snarky is absolutely correct. Apple has not released Schematics for computers since the Apple-II days.\nApple uses state of the art PCB manufacturing and I would be willing to bet that taking a soldering iron to it or even a volt meter would be like taking a framers hammer to a dent in your car: likely to do more harm than good.\nYou are welcome to try but you are likely to end up with a pile of garbage worth nothing more than the alloys and rare-earths the components are made of and with.\n\nA: ACMT here, former Apple Genius. Everything is SMD/SMT on the boards, this translates to: too small to repair or measure by hand, except you're hardcore into microelectronics and have the equipment.\nFor this exact reason parts like MLB (main logic board) get replaced in Apple Stores instead of 'repaired', as a skilled worker with equipment would be more expensive than replacing modules altogether.\nYour best bet would be a smc-reset first, if that doesn't help try to replace the magsafe connector (under the board). Please give attention to ESD - might do more damages only by touch.\nSchematics aren't available except for a few older machines, even within the company. Usually everything is Intel reference design_except_for_apple_own_stuff which you're handling here.\nYour question implies you might be firm with powered devices, but not with microelectronics as the magsafe connector (who has a high chance of being faulty) has only a few caps and resistors, so...maybe you are not the right person to try this on your own, no offense.\nGood luck to you   \n", "Q: Syncing contacts from iCloud to Gmail not working I am trying to export my contacts from iCloud to Gmail but it is not functioning.\nI keep on pressing export option but nothing is coming out.

I've got a lot of Apple applications on my Macbook which I never use (Photos Facetime, iBooks, iMovie, iTunes, etc.). They just clutter up my application folder and I want to get rid of them. This doesn't seem to be as easy as I think it should be though.\nWhen I right-click an application in the applications folder and select \"move to trash\" it says the applications are needed for the correct working of OSX, which I highly doubt.\nIn my terminal I went to the Applications folder (/Users/kramer65/Applications), but a simple ls only shows me Chromium Apps.localized. \nDoes anybody know how I can remove these iApplications, or at least hide them from my Applications view? All tips are welcome!\n\nA: I'd been wondering about this as well. I have my App folder in the side dock which gives me an unwieldy list of names longer than the screen heigth. The solution I tried attacks the problem from another angle. \nInstead of cleaning out the App folder, I made a new folder and put in alias's of just the programs I use. You can then drag the folder off to your sidebar and dock and remove the App folder.\nThis way you still have the App folder in case you have a burning desire to play chess, but in routine use you never have to see it.\n\n\n\nA: You can hide files from the UI using chflags command.\nAssuming you want to hide iBooks app, start your terminal app do the following:\n$ cd /Applications/\n$ sudo chflags hidden iBooks.app\n\nAnd you are almost done.

You have to put a dot before the filename of the app (or any file for that matter). This hides the app (or file) from being viewed in the folder, but it will still be present there.\nYou won't have permission to do this to the OS X default apps normally. But we'll use root for that.\nSo fire up the Terminal app, and type:\nsudo mv /Applications/hideme.app /Applications/.hideme.app\n\n…where hideme.app represents the name of the app that you're trying to hide. You can do the reverse (i.e. un-hide the app/file) by using the same command as above, but this time just put the dot in the first path-to-file, rather than the second directory path.\nTo address your final issue (about where the Applications are kept), they aren't kept in your home directory's Applications folder, but rather in the System Applications folder.\nYour Home Directory: /Users/yourusername/ or ~/\nOS X Home Directory: /\nAnd there is an Applications folder in both of them.

I've deleted my iCloud, then restored the phone and now when im setting up its asking for my iCloud log in again.  \nHas anyone encountered this issue and why does it happen?\n\nA: Standard procedure before you sell or give away your old iPhone/iPad etc\nDon't set the phone up for the new user, they must do it themselves.\nIf you still have your iOS device\nBefore you sell or give away your device, you should remove your personal information.\nYou shouldn't manually delete your contacts, calendars, reminders, documents, photo streams, or any other iCloud data while you're signed in to your iCloud account. This would delete your content from the iCloud servers and any of your devices signed in to iCloud.\n\n*\n\n*Back up your device.\n\n*Tap Settings > iCloud. Scroll down and tap Sign Out. In iOS 7 or earlier, tap Delete Account.\n\n*Tap Sign Out again, then tap Delete from My iPhone and enter your password.\n\n*Go back to Settings and tap General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings*. In iOS 7 or later with Find My iPhone turned on, you'll need your Apple ID and password.\n\n*If asked for your device passcode or Restrictions passcode, enter it.

Does anyone know how I can install Windows 10 without BootCamp due to this error? I already have the Windows 10 ISO file.\nI do not want to have to reformat my computer again (I know that is the easy way around this issue). I want to work my way through this issue.\n\nA: You can simply click past the error, but when you try to install windows, you'll get an error that it's in the wrong partition style. You can create the bootable USB drive, it's just telling you that you won't be able to install windows unless you decide to do that.\n\nA: The latest Windows 10 ISO file (October Update) is over 4GB in size, so you have to partition the USB drive to exFAT on Mac before burning. If not, you will receive waring message in Boot Camp Assistant.\nActually, there are a few good ISO burner apps (Ether, UUbyte, DiskMarkX) out there than Boot Camp, which does good in creating dual boot on Mac. If the Windows 10 bootable USB will be used somewhere else, just skip Boot Camp.\n\nA: You will likely have to install Windows 10 without the benefit of the BootCamp installer. Which means that you will have to create a bootable Windows 10 USB installer. If I recall correctly Microsoft will allow you to do exactly that with a Windows 10 download. Once that is created you should be able to boot the Mac from the Windows 10 installer and install it on the desired partition. Once that is done you can get the actual Windows drivers out of the Boot Camp installer and install them manually.\nThis is all going from supposition and doesn't take into account that you also want to boot Linux. From a very basic level the procedure I have outlined above should work. A Windows Installer should be able to boot a Mac and then should see the available partitions and install on the one you want. But there are so many variables to take into account, not the least of which is the number of partitions you have on the drive (which might make Windows, Mac OS and/or Linux not able to boot at all).\nyou are going down an experimental road. A few folks here might have some experience with doing it this way and might be able to help, but it will likely be a bumpy path filled with boot managers, re-partititioning and the general tearing of hair that is involved when anyone attempts doing things non-standard with a Mac.\nNot trying to discourage you, just pointing out that, if you succeed, it may take a while and you may end up with a configuration that you started out not being thrilled about.\n\nA: As far as I know you CAN use BOOT CAMP to create a USB stick with the neccessary drivers from a Windows ISO without having to partition or format your HDD ... at least with Booot Camp 6 it should also have a EFI boot on the USB stick.\nSo simply use Boot Camp for creating a USB installation medium and then BOOT FROM IT WITHOUT USING BOOT CAMP TO PARTITION YOUR MAC !\n\nA: Not completely the answer as this fix works with Boot Camp.\nBut it fixes the problem: I cannot seem to get past this step.\nWhat I did: remove the extra (non-OS X/Windows/Linux -> 4,5,6,7) partitions and merge them into the main Apple OS partition(2).(using diskutil)\nStart Boot Camp Assistant and it will not give the error you got and continue (telling you how to) install Windows.\nAfterwards, resize Windows partition (in Windows) , resize Mac partition (in OS X), and create your Linux partitions (diskutil).\nHandy program to help with booting from USB/partitions is rEFInd , an Apple EFI boot manager (it saves trouble with other boot managers)\nI had the same problem trying to install Windows (7,now upgraded to 10) on a MacBook 2009 El Capitan, deleting (and merging) the extra partitions made bootcamp work flawlessly.\n", "Q: Type of SSD for iMac 21.5\" (mid 2011) I have heard that a specific type of SSD is required if you want to use an SSD in an iMac 21.5\" (mid 2011). Which type of SSD would this be?\n\nA: The iMac 21.5\" Mid 2011 shipped with \"500 GB, 1, or 2 TB (7200-rpm SATA) and/or 256 GB (SSD)\" Storage and its Hard Drive Interface is \"6.0 Gbps Serial ATA (SATA)\".  So any normal 6.0 Gbps SATA SSD should work.\nAs an example, from Crucial, Apple iMac (21.5 and 27-inch, Mid 2011) compatible upgrades\n\nA: As you write, Apple seems to have undertaken some effort to make replacement of the internal HDD difficult, as described here:\n\nFor the main 3.5″ SATA hard drive bay in the new 2011 machines, Apple has altered the SATA power connector itself from a standard 4-wire power configuration to a 7-wire configuration. Hard drive temperature control is regulated by a combination of this cable and Apple proprietary firmware on the hard drive itself. From our testing, we’ve found that removing this drive from the system, or even from that bay itself, causes the machine’s hard drive fans to spin at maximum speed and replacing the drive with any non-Apple original drive will result in the iMac failing the Apple Hardware Test (AHT).\n\nThis site has extensive information on the issue and warns:\n\nUltimately, it is possible to upgrade the hard drive in the 21.5-Inch and 27-Inch Aluminum iMac models or upgrade or install a secondary SSD in the \"Mid-2011\" 21.5-Inch models and \"Mid-2010\" and \"Mid-2011\" 27-Inch models, but just opening the case is a challenge and it is definitely not for the faint of heart.\nThat it has become even more difficult to upgrade the hard drive in the \"Mid-2011\" and \"Late 2011\" iMac models with a layer of software complexity certainly is unfortunate. However, creative hackers no doubt will continue to find ways around whatever limitations are in place whether using software methods, hardware methods, or a combination of the two.\n\nSo this basically means you can use standard 3.5\" SATA 3.0 or 6.0 Gbps SSD drives, but you will have to do some tinkering and possibly get a connector like this one, in order to avoid issues.\n", "Q: How to get and set metadata of a m4a file?

When I am reading an email I want to prevent the email from being marked as read instantly. I would rather mark it myself, or have it wait like 2 minutes before it marks it as read. \nI know about the terminal delay trick, but that doesn't work. The Truepreview plugin hasn't been updated for a long time and doesn't work anymore. Are there any alternatives?\n\nA: It is not possible by default, but you can download a plugin for the Mail app. The plugin is called TruePreview. It is said that it supports OS X Mountain Lion and below, but I had it working on my Mavericks machine.\nAnyway, here's the method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit the Mail app\n\n*Download TruePreview (scroll down for latest versions) and run the\ninstaller\n\n*Launch Mail.app and open Preferences, click on the >> arrow and\nselect “TruePreview”\n\n*Adjust the Mark as Read settings as desired\n\n\nHave a read on this page and you'll find that there is a Terminal command that can be used to delay the Mark As Read setting. However, I'm not sure you can disable it completely.\ndefaults write com.apple.Mail MarkAsReadDelay 2\n\nHere, 2 is a measurement of the number of seconds to delay.\ndefaults write com.apple.Mail MarkAsReadDelay\n\nThe above will just revert the setting back to its default state.\nAlternatively, if you're okay with marking it as unread, an easier option would be to use a keyboard shortcut instead of manually marking as unread. The standard keyboard shortcut, which toggles “read” and “unread”, is cmd+shift+u. You can also go to System Preferences → Keyboard to customise your own keyboard shortcut.\nHave a look, see which options takes you where, and stick with whatever is comfortable. Let me know if anything went wrong during the plugin installation (that is, if you did install it).\n\nA: To enable this, install the add-on Mail Act-On.

I haven't tried it.\nKeep in mind that to recover files the recommended procedure is to stop using the affected disk immediately, and ideally mounting it as an external drive on another system to do the recovery from there, as space marked as free on your hard drive gets overwritten randomly.\nAbout files appearing on \"Recent\" menus: it is not an indicator that the file is still on your hard drive.

Idle ~97%\n\n*ran opensnoop, but it didn't correlate to frezing\n\n*once freeze occurs, 'top' any Activity Monotor do not show any activity - they freeze too. But, after freeze ends, I can see the spike in CPU activity. Activity Monitor replays the past events in a fast-forward kind of way, at 10x speed. But there is no way to tell what activity transpired. System was frozen.\n\n*it feels like 1/4 of one core of cpu is actually being used for OS itself.\n\n*no hardware issues were discovered with AHT.\n\n*Safe mode had no impact.\n\n\nIn the screenshot bellow, there is a blimp in CPU usage. That's the freeze. Sometimes they happen for longer, sometimes shorter duration. \n\nI know it's relatively vague problem description, but I would like to hear some theories on what this could be. And if it happens again, how to actually pin point to the process that is causing it.\n\nA: You can check which processes are using the most time interval in the system calls:\nsudo fs_usage | grep -v 0.0000\n\nSee: How do I debug an out-of-control “kernel_task” process?\nIn case your macOS experienced out-of-space scenario, some services can be still in a freeze mode (causing some freeze timeouts) and they need manual unpause by the following command:\nkill -CONT -1\n\nOtherwise check whether clean restart helps with anything.\nIf you had any unexpected shutdown after freeze, it's good to check for the shutdown code.\nIf won't help, if you experience another freeze, hit ⌘-⌥-Control-Shift-, (Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-Shift-Period), this will trigger sysdiagnose process which will quickly gather system-wide diagnostic information helpful in investigating system memory/performance issues (will appear in /var/tmp). If you're technical person, you can consider uncompressing the generated file and analyse the logs, or contact Apple support if they can help you.\nIf you believe you've a virus, just install antivirus (such as Sophos Home) to exclude that. But having antivirus, can cause another extra freezes as well, so it's up to you.\n", "Q: iphone 6 iOS 8 : Is my multitasking broken or am I doing something wrong? I just purchased an iPhone 6, with iOS 8. I am trying to get several things to work. This is my first iPhone, I am not familiar with how to use it.\nThe user manual says multitasking is achieved by double tapping the home button. When I double tap it, the opened app is \"lowered\" a little and about a third of the screen, from the top, becomes black. From when I understand, the current app and other opened apps should appear in that black area. But they don't. Am I doing something wrong?\nAlso, by clicking the home button, I only suspend the app, not close it completely, right?\nThank you\n\nA: Double click the home button. Double tapping without clicking will do as you have observed.\nBe sure to depress the home button twice. \nThe behavior of the double tap is to allow for easy reach of the top of the interface when using one hand. \n", "Q: How to use Mouse's Right Click Manually on keyboard? I'm using MacBook Pro. My Apple mouse that I only got last year when I right click on the mouse, nothing happens.

I want to start with a new unaltered configuration so I will also need to know how to install the latest version.\nFollowing other posts to delete/reinstall apache I already tried the \"apt-get\" and \"get\" commands but they couldn't been found.\n\nA: In this case you don't need to delete apache as you should not touch any executable under /usr/bin as Apple controls updating of this (i.e. could install it again). apt-get etc are not OS X or Unix commands but one packaging system for Linux. \nAny install of apache will put it in a different place to where Apple puts it.\nTo install Apache if you want to use a packaging system look at Macports, Homebrew or Fink. (if deb is the packaging you know then look at Fink) \nOtherwise the easiest installs are using MAMP, or use Apple's configuration in OS X Server\nWhat you use depends on your knowledge and what you want to use it for and to use the correct tutorials i.e. not that that assume Linux\n\nA: apache2 is a \"build-in\" module of OS X. It's a bad idea to delete it.\nYou may find the original configuration file in /etc/apache2/original folder.\nbtw, apt-get is the package management of linux base on dpkg.

This guide will be used by staff on both Windows and Mac, and I want to make sure it works on both. I don't currently have access to a Mac for testing.\nOn Excel for Windows, =char(9) places a tab character. This tab character doesn't show within Excel, but does appear correctly when the content of the cell is copied and pasted, which is what I need.\nSome of the Excel character numbering is different between Mac and PC, for example, non-breaking space is char(160) on Windows and char(202) on Mac.\nWhat's the Excel for Mac way to add a tab character by a formula? Specifically Excel-2011 for Mac, but I don't believe it changes between versions. \nI've tried looking it up in this table - http://www.alanwood.net/demos/macroman.html - but that doesn't include the Tab character.\n\nIf it's possible, I'd love an option that works on both Mac and Windows and is standard to spreadsheet programs e.g. not just MS Excel but others too. But I'm guessing this is probably impossible, so just knowing the Mac exquivalent of =char(9) would be enough.\n\nBonus points for a link to a reference to the complete character table Excel for Mac uses so I can just look up any question like this in future.\n\nA: Believe it or not, the TAB character on a Mac has the same ASCII code -- 9, so =char(9) should just work.\n", "Q: Use tap to click instead of click to select user on start up I have Mac OS X 10.10.3. On startup of the OS you can select between different users on the machine.

These are the iOS apps that came with a fresh install, so no simple delete option. It would help free up some memory, as I'd never use these.\n(for what it's worth, it will be a business phone, used only for the business. I have my regular iPhone with all the apps I want.)\n\nA: You would need to download Apple Configurator, then configure a profile, connect your device and install this profile, restart phone. I'm sure there will be tutorials how to do this, if you struggle, just reply here. :)\n\nA: Lots of hoops to jump through to really delete them, or to hide them with Tap Hide Apps (as they reappear when you reboot, as one does with an iOS update.)\nI just pulled them all into a folder and labeled it AppleCrapApps.\n", "Q: Download a Free App published only to India AppStore while my primary iTunes account is US Appstore?

I have tried to fix this by resetting the default display in system preferences, SMC and PRAM resets, but to no avail. I'm at a loss as to what is causing this to happen, and can't seem to figure it out. Any help would be appreciated!\n\nA: Dragging the status bar (in Display Settings) to the screen you want as default worked for me! :)\n\n\nA: Found issue to be in the display assembly.

You can do it ones without consequences but the second time you do it you'll be asked to provide credit card details of a \"new\" country of your residence. The easiest way to use App Store of different countries is to have 2 different Apple ID registered for certain country.\n\nA: It can be done, but you'll want to follow the steps in this guide (https://support.apple.com/en-ph/HT201389) since switching countries back and forth can produce migraines if not done properly. Especially if you have any paid apps or apps that have been removed from the App Store, but you still own.\n", "Q: OSX cmd+tab behavior with multiple windows & monitors After upgrading to a second monitor I have run into some unexpected cmd+tab behavior that is really impacting my workflow:\nWith one monitor, when using cmd+tab to switch between applications, OS X gives the focus to the last active window of the application one switches to.\nWith multiple monitors, OS X prefers windows that are on the same monitor as the previous application.\nTo give an example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Consider having Xcode on monitor 1 and Terminal (window A) on monitor 2 and (window B) on monitor 2; focus is on Terminal window B\n\n*you cmd+tab to Xcode\n\n*you cmd+tab back to Terminal, but now window A has the focus and not window B\n\n\nThis behavior is potentially hazardous as one starts to enter commands into Terminal before realizing that the focus is on the wrong window.\nMy question is: Is there a way to make cmd+tab always return to the last active window of an application no matter on which screen the focus at the moment?\n\nA: In Sierra(not sure about older OSX versions) it is possible to temporary lock the cmd+tab menu in specific display.\nDock > Finder icon > Right Click > Options > Desktop on Display[n]\nwhere [n] is number of desired display.\n\nA: System prefs > Mission Control... uncheck 'Displays have separate Spaces'\nThat would be my prime suspect. I switched that one off the day it appeared in the OS.\nFrom comments, that will disable the ability to move the menu bar & dock to each screen on an ad-hoc basis, though - which may be best asked as a separate question requesting a possible 3rd party solution, as I know of no way to do that natively.\n\nA: Contexts offers significant customization for macOS window-switcher (Alt-Tab shortcut) behavior, location across multiple displays, and appearance.\nInstall Contexts.app. Run it. Then select Panel->'Show Panel on', as per the following screenshot, which shows the switcher on 'All displays' in the setting below.

I am a developer working on an in house application.  I have gotten several complaints about getting the Spinning pinwheel in the iOS application I maintain.  Can anyone tell me if this is actually something that can happen on iOS (not OS X.  I know this is common on the desktop OS when an application becomes unresponsive to input.) I have done a great deal of searching on Google and am coming up empty handed.  I'm beginning to wonder about the accuracy of this bug report.\n\nA: I don't believe that there is any spinning pinwheels in iOS.

I have mine to execute the Zoom option located under the Window tab at the top of most browsers and applications. I changed the Command + Return + Shift from the default to my new shortcut zoom.\nThis will resize the window to fit the screen and if a different/smaller screen size is desired, you can easily resize it using the corners from here. \nIt is actually much easier to resize from this resized/\"Zoomed\" window because moving your mouse to any of the computer screen's edges will place you directly over the edge of the window allowing you do resize the screen without mis-clicking (example of mis-clicking: causing another window/application to become active or moving the position/orientation of the window altogether).\nJust add in the application you want this shortcut to work for under the App Shortcuts option within the \"Keyboard\" -> \"Shortcuts\" sections of system preferences.\nAs long as any part of the top of the window is visible, then the following will work:\nHold down \"Shift\" while double-clicking then the window's title bar. \nThis will resize the window to fit your screen.\n\n\nA: In my experience, moving most windows from a large display to a smaller display automatically resized it to fit height-wise.\nIf it does not automatically do so, clicking the Green Maximize/Zoom button in the title bar should make it fit to the current screen/window content. If the application works with full screen mode, hold the Option key while clicking the button. From there you should have more access to resizing the window.\nNote: You should also be able to resize an application's windows from any corner.\nEdit: As per comment, this is also useful for resizing windows width-wise.\n\nA: Most apps will also resize their window to fit your screen if you double-click anywhere on the top bar (title bar).\n", "Q: Change default app for magnet links in Safari Currently Safari opens magnet links in Bittorrent.

Despite selecting the High option when exporting JPEG images from Photo, I am finding the file size at destination is around 3MB - 60% smaller than when I exported the same images from iPhoto with the High option. Image size is unaffected. If Photo is compressing JPEG images more during export than iPhoto, I fear the image quality is also being reduced. Is this correct?\nThere is a possibility that Photo is actually extra-compressing images at the import stage, not during export. Or both!\n\nA: You can export unmodified original photos from the Photos.app from File > Export > Export Unmodified Original.\nYou can also select a higher resolution when exporting from File > Export > Export or cmd + ⇧+ E; and select \"Maximum\" from the drop down menu.\nI suspect it is still recompressed, so it is expectable that the image will be smaller. \nAlso, check this question and answers.\n", "Q: Unable to run/upgrade iPhoto after upgrading to OS X Yosemite I just downloaded OS X Yosemite on my Macbook Pro.

When I search in the App Store I'm told there is no version available for Canada.  Does that mean my photos are all lost?\nNot really good with computers so would appreciate exact instructions if anyone can help\nLinda\n\nA: The error message is likely because you have an old version of iPhoto installed, from your previous version of OS X. It may be too old and does not support Yosemite (the latest version, iPhoto 9.6.1, should still run).\niPhoto is no longer supported and has been replaced by the new Photos app as of OS X 10.10.3. Correspondingly, the iPhoto app is longer available on the Mac App Store (along with Aperture).\nIf you are on OS X 10.10.3 or newer, opening the new Photos app will migrate your iPhoto library, along with all included photos, albums/events, and metadata. You can then delete the iPhoto app from your Applications folder, move it to an external hard drive if you want to keep it for whatever reason, or just leave it there if you do not have disk space concerns.\nIt may be ideal to make a backup/copy of the iPhoto Library.photolibrary file in your users' Pictures folder onto an external hard drive or USB flash drive before using the Photos app to migrate your library.

That didn't help.\nDisk Utility can see the disk but not partitions and the options to verify the disk are grayed out.\nI used disk utility from the terminal and see that the entire drive is listed as 'Fdisk_partition_scheme'.\nI think this is the problem as I have never used windows and would not have formatted the hard drive to this format. I have never used bootcamp or parallels or similar programs.\nI'm sure that I formatted the drive to 'GUID_partition_scheme' and the fact that I used it without problems on my Mac for a long time should confirm that.\nI think that somehow the directory format was corrupted and changed from 'GUID_partition_scheme' to 'Fdisk_partition_scheme' rendering the drive unreadable.\nDisk Utility terminal text: \n/dev/disk1  \n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER  \n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1  \n   1:                       0xEE                         3.0 TB     disk1s1  \n\ndiskutil info disk1  \n   Device Identifier:        disk1  \n   Device Node:              /dev/disk1  \n   Part of Whole:            disk1  \n   Device / Media Name:      HGST Media  \n\n   Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)  \n\n   Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)  \n\n   File System:              None  \n\n   Content (IOContent):      FDisk_partition_scheme  \n   OS Can Be Installed:      No  \n   Media Type:               Generic  \n   Protocol:                 USB  \n   SMART Status:             Not Supported  \n\n   Total Size:               3.0 TB (3000592494592 Bytes) (exactly 5860532216 512-Byte-Units)  \n   Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)  \n   Device Block Size:        4096 Bytes  \n\n   Read-Only Media:          No  \n   Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)  \n   Ejectable:                Yes  \n\n   Whole:                    Yes  \n   Internal:                 No  \n   OS 9 Drivers:             No  \n   Low Level Format:         Not supported  \n\nI did some reading and downloaded gdisk but haven't made any changes with it yet.\ngdisk terminal text:\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.0  \n\nPartition table scan:  \n  MBR: protective  \n  BSD: not present  \n  APM: not present  \n  GPT: not present  \n\nCreating new GPT entries.  \n\nCommand (?

I'm just checking if that's ok.\nAlso the starting value of 409642 wasn't close to an HFSJ and I quit the find command after a few minutes. Searching from the start of the disk HFSJ was found with offset 0000209736666\nAlso I recalculated the middle of the disk as sector 366283263 and from there I found the next instance of HFSJ at offset 1500936938486\n\nSo at that point I am happy but I stopped awaiting your advice on the further sections reconsidering the 4096 sector size.\nThanks for your help\nedited to add requested screenshot of first three blocks:\n\n\nA: The method to repair your disk and recover the GUID partition table is related to my answers to similar questions: HFS+ invalid number of allocation blocks and Hard drive no longer accessible.\nBasically you have to find characteristic strings of JHFS+ volumes, use some simple math and common sense and have some luck to fix the GUID. And don't loose sight of your objectives when faced with this wall of an answer.\nAdditionally there are some fixed sizes and rules (valid for a logical block size of 512b - the rules for 4096b devices are slightly different) that help you to determine some of the sizes as well as some of the starting and the ending blocks of your \"deleted\" partitions.\n 1. 1st block (block 0)                             = PMBR\n 2. 2nd block (block 1)                             = Pri GPT header\n 3. 3rd - 34th block (block 2 - block 33)           = Pri GPT table\n 4. 41st - 409640th block (block 40 - block 409639) = EFI (aligned)\n 5. 409641st - ??? block (block 409640 - block ???) = partition 1 (aligned)\n 6. empty space 262144 blocks (aligned)\n 7. ??? - ??? block (block ??? - block ???)         = partition 2 (aligned)\n 8. empty space 262144 blocks (aligned)\n 9. 7 empty blocks to keep alignment\n10. the last 33 blocks except the very last one     = Sec GPT table\n11. last block                                      = Sec GPT header\n12. alignment rule: the start block and the sizes of all partitions (EFI, partition 1 & 2) and the major empty spaces are dividable by 8\n13. The 3rd block of a regular JHFS+ volume contains the string \"HFSJ\" starting at offset 8\n\nThis walkthrough doesn't work with internal or external disks containing a Recovery HD or disks with CoreStorage/ExFAT/NTFS volumes. Though principally the approach to a solution would be similar, some of the above rules are different.\nFinally a gpt command should result in something similar like this output:\nroot# gpt -r -vv show /dev/disk1\ngpt show: /dev/disk0: mediasize=3000592498688; sectorsize=512; blocks=5860532224\ngpt show: /dev/disk0: PMBR at sector 0\ngpt show: /dev/disk0: Pri GPT at sector 1\ngpt show: /dev/disk0: Sec GPT at sector 5860532223\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         PMBR\n           1           1         Pri GPT header\n           2          32         Pri GPT table\n          34           6         \n          40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n      409640  2930844728      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  2931254368      262144         \n  2931516512  2928753528      3  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  5860270040      262151         \n  5860532191          32         Sec GPT table\n  5860532223           1         Sec GPT header\n\nHint: Since I can't create a disk of the same size as yours in Parallel Desktop some sizes are different than your original sizes\nPreparation:\nBackup your Mac and then detach all external drives except the one you want to recover.\nDownload  and install wxHexEditor. Enable the root user and log-in as root.\nHint: While working with wxHexEditor don't use copy and paste. Enter everything manually! You might accidentally write directly to your disk.\nTerminology\nBlock: Sector (in wxHexEditor)\nOffset: The number of the Byte relative to the beginning of the device/volume  starting with \"Byte 0\". E.g Block(512) 0 contains Byte 0 - Byte 511.\nDetermine your partitions` boundaries:\nOpen the Calculator. Open wxHexEditor. Check that you work in read-only mode (\"Options\" -> \"File mode\" -> \"Read only\"). In the menubar go to \"Devices\" -> \"Open disk device\" -> choose the appropriate diskNumber. Probably it's disk1. The disk should have one partition (disk1s1). Please try to arrange the wxHexEditor window like in the examples below with straight red lines.\nThen hit the \"Go to offset\"-button (marked with the green circle) and enter 409640 exactly like in the picture below. Sometimes you have do that twice to jump to the correct sector. Re-check the correct sector by entering the offset (marked red) in the Calculator and divide it through 512.\n\nIf you see a similar picture you already found the beginning of your first partition (note the string HFSJ in block 409642!).\nNow jump to the midst of your disk: Hit the \"Go to offset\"-button and enter block number (total blocks of your disk/2) ~ 2930266108.\nThis works if you've previously partitioned your disk with Disk Utility by simply choosing 2 partitions in the drop down menu. If you've adjusted the slider between the two partitions afterwards e.g. enlarged partition1 you have to jump to slightly bigger offset.\nNow hit the \"Find\"-button (marked with the green circle) and enter HFSJ like in the picture below and hit find. This may take a while.\n\nIf the search was successful you've found the beginning of the second partition. Make a note of the block offset (=BlockOffset2). In my example the offset is 1500936455168. If you scroll to lower offset numbers the disk should be filled with 0s.\nSince you have found the start sectors of both volumes and the rest usually is determined by the rules 1-12 mentioned earlier you may now fix the GUID table.\nQuit wxHexEditor. If you are asked to save changes don't save them!.\n\nNow you have to do some math:\nThe first HFSJ string usually is found in the 3rd block of a JHFS+ volume.\nSo the first JHFS+ volume starts at block 409640 (also rule 5).\nThe second JHFS+ volume starts at StartBlockOfVolume2 = BlockOffset2/512 - 2. In my example that's 1500936455168/512 -2 = 2931516514 -2 = 2931516512.\nWith the start block of volume 2 and the fixed empty space of rule 6 you may determine the end block of volume 1:\nFirst block of volume 2 - 262144 (rule 6) - 1 = EndBlockOfVolume1.\nIn my example that's 2931516512 - 262144 - 1 = 2931254367\nSizeOfVolume1 = EndBlockOfVolume1 - start block volume 1 (rule 5) + 1\nIn my example that's 2931254367 - 409640 + 1 = 2930844728\nThe only thing you need missing is the size of volume 2:\nWith the rules 8-11 from above you may now determine the last block of volume 2.\nTotal size of disk in blocks - 1 (rule 11) - 32 (rule 10) -7 (rule 9) - 262144 (rule 8) - 1 = LastBlockOfVolume2\nSizeOfVolume2 = LastBlockOfVolume2 - StartBlockOfVolume2 +1\n\nRebuild a proper GPT:\nHere I assume the identifier of your external disk is disk1.\nFirst you have to unmount your external disk in Terminal:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk1\n\nRemove the current fdisk mbr with gpt:\ngpt create -f /dev/disk1\n\nFirst rebuild the EFI entry with:\ngpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk1\n\nThen add the first JHFS+ partition entry:\ngpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s SizeOfVolume1 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk1\n\nThen enter:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk1\n\nand add the second JHFS+ partition entry:\ngpt add -b StartBlockOfVolume2 -i 3 -s SizeOfVolume2 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk1\n\nThen again enter:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk1\n\nEnter exit and quit Terminal.\nOpen Disk Utility and verify the disk and the two volumes for errors, but don't repair them. If no errors are found mount the volumes.\n\nAddendum: 4k device in a 4k enclosure\nIf you happen to have an Advanced Format hard drive which has a 4096 bytes (4K) sector size in a 4k only enclosure (a hard drive enclosure with a controller not properly reporting a logical block size of 512 bytes for the AF HDD) some modifications have to be made to the above solution:\nTo jump to a given sector you have to divide the above data through eight.\nExamples: \n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of jumping to block(512b) 409640 to find the assumed start sector of volume 1, jump to block(4096b) 51205.\n\n*To find the middle of your HDD jump to total blocks(512b) of your disk/16 instead of total blocks(512b) of your disk/2\nThe math part stays the same. Though maybe confusing there is no big difference using block(512b) or block(4096b). Changes may easily be adopted by introducing a factor 1/8 later in the Rebuild a proper GPT part.\nThe tricky thing is the Rebuild a proper GPT part. Will the gpt command detect 512 B or 4096 B blocks?\nI indeed would start with 512 B and add the last partition first (the reason is explained below):\ngpt add -b StartBlockOfVolume2 -i 1 -s SizeOfVolume2 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk1\n\nSince you published the screenshots I may even enter the proper values:\nThe second block(4096b) of volume2 starts at offset 1500936941568 -> The first block(4096b) starts at offset 1500936941568 - 4096 = 1500936937472. This is block(4096b) 1500936937472/4096 = 366439682 or block(512b) = 8 x 366439682 = 2931517456. \nThe last block(4096b) of the disk is the 732566527th block with the block number 732566526. With the rules (rule 8-11) above the last block(4096b) of the volume2 is 732533754 and the size of volume2 is 732533754 - 366439682 = 366094072 blocks(4096b).\nThe last block(512b) of the disk is the 5860532216th block with block number 5860532215. With the rules above the last block(512b) of the volume2 is 5860270032 and the size of volume2 is 5860270032 - 2931517456 = 2928752576 blocks(512b)\nThe proper gpt add command expecting 4096 B blocks would be:\ngpt add -b 366439682 -i 1 -s 366094072 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk1\n\nThe proper gpt add command expecting 512 B blocks would be:\ngpt add -b 2931517456 -i 1 -s 2928752576 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk1\n\nFirst I would enter the gpt(512b) command because if gpt uses 4096 B blocks instead, it should give you an error - the disk is much too small: If secretly 4096 B blocks are used, volume2 would start at ~12 TB and end at 24 TB. If you enter the gpt(4096b) and secretly 512 B blocks are used you may destroy your volume1 because the partition would start at 187 GB and end at 373 GB.\nIn case the gpt(512b) command is wrong - and gpt(4096b) would be right - the error message then states \"gpt add: disk1: no space available on device\".\nThen use gpt(4096b) instead and start over with Rebuild a proper GPT: but divide all values by 8. One exception is the starting block of a volume: Since the string \"HFSJ\" is already in the first block(4096b) you don't have to substract 2/8 blocks(512b).\nIn case the gpt(512b) command is right your former volume2 will be mounted probably. You may check the volume with Disk Utility.\nThen unmount disk1 with:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk1\n\nand delete the partition with\ngpt remove -i 1 disk1\n\nand start over with Rebuild a proper GPT:\nPlease recalculate/recheck all values in the last part above. Though I tried to be as accurate as possible, the commands/values may be faulty. Always consider that block number and \"number of blocks\" are something different: Block number 0 is the first block (or block number 455 is 456th block).\n\nFinally I have created an Excel sheet to do the math. It's available here.\nScreenshot:\n\n\nI hope this recovers your missing volumes.\nIf you run into problems (e.g you can't find the proper starting sector of your second volume), the verification throws a lot of errors, have doubts or questions immediately stop and contact me with a comment @klanomath!\n", "Q: Set custom date format on iOS I am using the iOS 9 beta and I am trying to change the date format to\ndayofweek-dayofmonth-month-year. \nFor example today would be: \n\nTuesday, 25 Aug 2015\n\nIn Settings I have looked under ‘Language & Region’, and at the bottom of the page there is something that shows ‘Region Format Example’, but I cannot find a way to set a custom date format without changing my region (which still doesn't allow custom, but it will change it). \nUnder ‘Date and Time’ there isn't anything either.\n\nA: It's currently not possible to set a custom date format on iOS, unlike macOS.

Recovery Disk Assistant which is downloaded from Apple website.\n\n\nPurpose:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a recovery Yosemite disk on USB stick\n\n\nProcedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded Recovery Disk Assistant fro Apple\n\n*executed Recovery Disk Assistant on Yosemite\n\n\nProblem:\n  The recovery disk assistant has fixed image and text. There is a Lion photo image, not Yosemite and it said successfully made Lion recovery disk.\nSo I am wondering whether I got Lion recovery or Yosemite recovery...\n\nA: Yes, it is a Yosemite recovery USB flash drive. The application copies the hidden (internal disk) recovery partition to the flash drive. I believe Apple no longer recommends using a recovery flash drive, so I suppose they have not updated the Recovery Disk Assistant application. I believe Apple now wants you to keep a bootable copy of OS X on an external drive. Still, the recovery flash drive is good to have if you need to download and install a fresh copy of OS X (and your internal recovery partition is damaged). Some will argue you can just boot using internet recovery to reinstall OS X, but you will get the version of OS X that was shipped with the machine. If you keep your flash drive up to date, then you can download the current version of OS X (that you have installed).\n", "Q: Cannot Partition Disk with Disk Utility I can't seem to partition my disk with Disk Utility or with the Terminal command (see screenshots).\nSomething also happened to my other partition running Mavericks, where it just turned into an \"empty name\" partition, but still runs fine.  Any help would be much appreciated\n\n.\n\nA: You could try booting into internet recovery (hold Command+Option+R during boot) once there open disk utility and try partitioning again.\n", "Q: Does Mac have an display driver to go for higher resolution (than the current display)? It used to be on a PC, when hooked up to a 1024 x 768 display, I can actually set the resolution to 1600 x 1200, and the display driver will pan to different part of the 1600 x 1200 section depending on where my mouse moves to.\nCan a Mac do that too?  That is, if a Macbook Air only has a resolution of 1440 x 900, can I install some driver to have a resolution of 4k or 5k, and just have the 1440 x 900 showing the section of the 4k or the 5k screen, depending on where the mouse is?\nI am looking for this function mainly to sometimes capture some screenshots when reading digital magazine using Zinio the web app, and want to capture the screenshot in 4k or 5k resolution even when the Mac is not hooked up to such display.\n\nA: Apple, generally does not release drivers other than what ships with OS X. And video card manufacturers generally do not release drivers for their devices installed in a Mac under OS X unless it is a PCI card or some such that has a chipset not specifically supported by OS X.\nI suppose the Hackintosh community may have some drivers that do that but I would tend to think that what you are looking for is not available under Mac OS\n", "Q: Display issue with Yosemite on MacBook Air Please check image\n\nAnyone facing same issue?\n\nA: Latest update fixed display issue.\n", "Q: Logging camera access on OS X Yosemite and up I'd like to have camera access by applications be logged in system logs, so that I can later search for camera access in the console app. Any idea if there is some debug feature in OS X to enable logging ?\n\nA: I'm not certain how you would do it natively, but by pure coincidence I discovered this today, from Obdev, the makers of Little Snitch.  \n\nMicro Snitch\nEver wondered if an application records audio through your Mac’s built-in microphone without your knowledge? Or if the camera captures video for no good reason?\nWith Micro Snitch there’s no doubt anymore. This ultra-light menu bar application operates inconspicuously in the background.

Is it possible to get a remote link to a file via finder? I want to be able to share my screenshots really quickly which are now saved to an iCloud folder. Thanks, D.\n\nA: I don't believe this is possible as of Yosemite 10.10.5. The sharing menu would be a sensible place for this, but it doesn't have an option to send or copy a link to the file, choosing Mail or Messages will attach the full file:\n\nPersonally I use Dragshare to quickly get a remote link to a file, or if you save your files to Dropbox you can just alt-click and choose Share Dropbox Link. \n\nA: It is now possible to get an iCloud link natively with macOS High Sierra:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select a file in one of your iCloud folders (Desktop, Documents, etc.)\n\n*Choose Add People from the Share menu\n\n*Click the Copy Link button\n\n*Change \"Who can access\" to \"Anyone with the link\" under \"Share Options\" section\n\n\nIt'll look something like this:\n\n", "Q: iPhone 5 will not ring, it only vibrates I have my iPhone 5 set on \"Vibrate on Ring\" and the volume is not on mute, but when someone calls, it only vibrates.

Okay, so I turn on my laptop, sign in to my regular user account and proceed to open/run a Java-based, HTTP-proxying application called burp via Terminal.app. It executes normally but refuses to bind with ports 80:http & 443:https. I assume the error is privilege related so I..\nuser@MacBook-Pro:~$login\nlogin:root\nPassword:********\n\n..successfuly log in as the root user and..\nroot@MacBook-Pro:~#open /Users/user/Downloads/burpsuite_free_v1.6.01.jar\n\n..returns the following error:\nLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file\n/Users/user/Downloads/burpsuite_free_v1.6.01.jar.`\n\nHowever, I don't observe this error when signed in as a regular user; nor do I observe this error when signed in as root via OS X's graphical user interface.\nI'm not sure why burp refuses bind to ports 80:http & 443:https.\nIf it's merely an error due to (chown) ownership and (chmod) permissions; i would have thought having root access was supposed to transcend such limitations.\nBased on this question and answer I can see what the LSOpenURLsWithRole() & error -10810 mean. I'm getting this error because the .jar file isn't a runnable application.\nBut how do I fix this and get this working on my machine?\n\nA: You cannot, normally, run a .jar file (which is a Java ARchive file) using the open command on OS X. It's not a executable file, it doesn't give the system any hints about how it should be run normally, so open is giving you the LSOpenURLsWithRole() error you see above.\nFirst, you'll need to install Java on your Mac. The easiest way to do this is to open a Terminal.app window and type:\njava -version\n\nIf that returns a java version like this:\nIanCsiMac:~ |ruby-2.1.5|\n> java -version\njava version \"1.8.0_20\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_20-b26)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.20-b23, mixed mode)\n\nYou're done. Java is ready to be used. If java isn't present on your system, running that command will pop up a window asking if you want to install it. Follow the prompts and when you're done, java -version will show you something like what you see above. The version may be different, but the command will now work.\nNow you need to run your .jar file using the java command. You need to provide three options to the java command in order for this to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*The -jar option which tells java you're running the contents of a Java ARchive file;\n\n*A memory option for the Java Virtual Machine in the form -Xmx1024m; and finally\n\n*The path to the .jar file on disk.\n\n\nFor your download it's all going to look like this:\njava -jar -Xmx1024m /Users/user/Downloads/burpsuite_free_v1.6.01.jar\n\nThat will start the program HOWEVER it still won't be able to bind to ports 80 and 443. Those are protected ports. Ports <1024 on any Mac OS X machine can only be bound to be processes started as root.\nThe correct way to run programs as root is to use the sudo command, not to login as the root user. This provides a level of control and indirection to your actions so you don't do something accidentally silly like rm -rf / without a prompt asking you if you're sure you want to do such a silly thing.\nSo, the final form of your command will be:\nsudo java -jar -Xmx1024m /Users/user/Downloads/burpsuite_free_v1.6.01.jar\n\nYou'll be prompted for your password and, assuming nothing else is already bound to ports 80 and 443, your application will start and being listening on those ports.\nIf it fails because it cannot bind to 80 and 443, you'll need to find out what's bound there already and shut it down. You can use the lsof command to figure this out.\nFor port 80 the call is:\nsudo lsof -iTCP:80 -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P\n\nFor 443 it's:\nsudo lsof -iTCP:443 -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P\n\nThe output from that command, assuming something is listening on the port, will look something like this:\n> sudo lsof -iTCP:80 -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P\nCOMMAND PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nnginx    50 root    9u  IPv6 0x8978b255ac4ef0b7      0t0  TCP *:80 (LISTEN)\n\nAs you can see, I have a process named nginx listening port 80. It has process ID 50.\nI can kill that process with:\nsudo pkill nginx\n\nThat doesn't necessarily guarantee it won't try and come back, but how to deal with this fully and completely is best stated as entirely separate question on the site altogether.\n", "Q: iPad won't turn on after being drained What if my iPad didn't turn on after battery drain?\nI did all the steps but it still didn't work.\nIs it already damaged or can I recover it on an Apple Store?\n\nA: I had the same problem, apparently my iPad couldn't be any more charged. So I brought it to a shop, and voila, they could charge it. Point being to really really use the original \"fat\" charger and not another one (like the thin one of an iPhone). The chargers differ in the maximal current they can supply (more than 2A is needed for the iPad). \n", "Q: Use macbook inbuilt microphone with audio going through mic-less earphones I want to buy Sony Earphones for use with my MacBook Pro Mid-2014 edition. The earphones have no built in mic. Can my MacBook play audio through my earphones and use the inbuilt mac microphone at the same time e.g. during skype calls or will I have to unplug the earphones for 2 way communication?\nI am using OS X 10.10\n\nA: Yes, you will be able to use your internal mic and headphones. A useful shortcut is option click on the speaker icon on the menu bar. \n", "Q: Safari cannot open page because iPhone is not connected to Internet I recently started getting this message \"Safari cannot open page because iPhone is not connected to Internet\"  whenever I leave a Wi-Fi zone. \nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: You need to turn off WiFi before you leave the coverage area (or more precisely - before you reach the point where WiFi is still \"connected\" but not viable.)\nIn iOS 9 there will be a system setting to allow cellular data to take over sooner, but on iOS 8 and less, your device will throw errors when WiFi fails you and before the radio disconnects from WiFi.\nManually disconnect or control your location so that you don't try to use the internet when WiFi isn't viable.\n\nA: If you're on an iPhone or iPad go to Settings then Cellular and swipe down to make sure you haven't accidentally toggled the switch off for Safari to access the internet.\n", "Q: Wrong focus when CMD+Tab with multiscreen If I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*2 Screens\n\n*Setting \"Displays have separate spaces\" ON\n\n*A Terminal window in each screen (Terminal is just an example, this happens with all apps)\n\n\nBeing focused on the Terminal window of my secondary screen I do Cmd+Tab to switch to another app and then back to Terminal, the focus goes to the primary screen rather than the one was focused before switching, this happens no matter which app I use, always the same.\nAnyone knows what's the solution for this?\n\nA: I don't think there's a solution besides turning off \"Displays have separate spaces\". \nFor more detail - I think if you start on one display and alt-tab to a different program, it'll focus on a window for that program on that same display if one exists; it'll focus on a window on a different display only if one doesn't exist on the starting display. \n", "Q: Do you use more mobile data with Wi-Fi off than with Wi-Fi on (connected to Wi-Fi or not) Does using your mobile data while having Wi-Fi off when not connected burn data faster than using mobile data while having Wi-Fi on when not connected to Wi-Fi?\n\nA: You can measure this yourself by going to settings app and using the reset option to then track data and watch how much you use over a set period and then again repeating the steps with Wi-Fi in the other state.\nIn general, you should leave Wi-Fi on so that it connects when it can if you are concerned with mobile data usage.\nI can't see a situation where an app developer would notice that Wi-Fi was off and then send more data over mobile/cellular data, but it's something that a developer could in fact do.\nYou'd have to measure things to be 100% sure. My guess is even if there is a difference, it would be so small as to not matter, though.\n", "Q: iMessage Traffic only to my phone after setting up a new Apple ID? I previously shared an Apple ID with other family members that had other apple devices (another phone and an iPad). At that time, my iMessages were going to their devices also.  So I recently created a new Apple ID and assigned it to my phone for iMessage.  Is there still a chance my messages are going to the other devices? In my \"send/receive\" setting of iMessage, it shows my phone number and my personal email address.  So, I guess, when I create the new Apple ID, does that phone number now come off the old ID and is only assigned to this new one? Or can it still be on the old one at the same time, meaning they could get my messages?\n\nA: You will have to go to the other devices and remove your phone number and email address from iMessage. It's always better to check those devices carefully when making a switch to make sure you don't have other cross linking happening. \n", "Q: Quote a filename in a script passed to chmod? I'm having trouble quoting a filename that's eventually passed to chmod. The script was originally written for SSH's StrictModes and authorized_keys, but I had to expand it due to a bad UMASK that caused some filesystem discomfort. The script is below, and its producing boatloads of:\nchmod: /Users/<user>/Library/Application: No such file or directory\nchmod: Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles/HTML.tmbundle/Macros/Delete: No such file or directory\nchmod: whitespace: No such file or directory\nchmod: between: No such file or directory\nchmod: tags.plist: No such file or directory\n...\nchmod: /Users/<user>/Library/Caches/com.operasoftware.Opera/Media: No such file or directory\nchmod: Cache/index: No such file or directory\ncut: stdin: Illegal byte sequence\n...\n\nI've tried a few workarounds, but none of them have helped. I tried double quoting like \"\"$file\"\", but the issue persisted. I also tried the back ticks (that are discouraged in this case), but the issue persisted.\nThe closest I got to actually quoting was the dysfunctional \"\\\"\"\"$file\"\"\\\"\".

Your for loops are causing the problems. You can put your logic in multiple find commands. Not every directory in a user's home folder should be accessible to only them self. Public and Sites come to mind. You can fix them separately in another find command.\nfind /Users/* ! -path '/Users/Shared*'  -type d ! \\( -name Public -o -name Sites \\) -exec chmod 0700 {} +\n\nThe command excludes the Shared directory along with Public and Sites directories then changes the permissions on the remaining directories.\nYou can use + in your find statements to have find act as if it were xargs.\nfind /Users/Shared -type d -exec chmod 0777 {} +\n\nAssuming that the executable files in a user's home folder are application bundles then you could do this.\nfind /Users/* ! -path '/Users/Shared*' type f ! perm -755 -exec chmod 0600 {} +\n\n\nA: mtklr's (and Patrix') solution will work, but I find it's simpler to use a while read loop when dealing with a file list from find ... -print0:\nfind /Users '!' -path '/Users/Shared*' -type f -print0 |\n    while IFS= read -d '' -r file; do\n        if file \"$file\" | grep -iq \": .*executable\"; then\n            chmod 700 \"$file\"\n        else\n            chmod 600 \"$file\"\n        fi\n    done\n\nread -d '' uses nulls as a delimiter. I also used  -r to prevent it from trying to parse escapes, and IFS= to prevent it trimming whitespace at the end of the filename (and since it's a prefix to the read command, it only applies to that one and you don't have to set it back afterward).\nBTW, I also used if ... | grep -q ... -- the -q tells grep not to output anything, but its exit status will only succeed if it found at least one match. And since if just tests the exit status of the command in it, that's all that's needed.\nBTW, this is mostly based on BashFAQ #20: How can I find and safely handle file names containing newlines, spaces or both?.

To turn journaling on, you need to highlight the partition and click on the \"Enable Journaling\" button. To see the change, you may have to quit and reopen the Disk Utility application. \nTo turn journaling off, do the following using the Disk Utility application.\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight the partition.\n\n*Press and hold the \"alt/option\" key.\n\n*From the menu bar select \"File->Disable Journaling\"\n\n*Release the \"alt/option\" key.\n\n*Quit and reopen the Disk Utility\n\n\nYou should alway have journaling enabled for \"Mac OS Extended\" formatted partitions, but there can be cases where you may want to turn it off. Especially if you are going to be using Linux.  Many linux distributions (like Ubuntu) can read \"Mac OS Extended\" formatted partitions, but they can only write to them if journaling is turn off. So enabling and disabling journaling may be useful if you need to transfer data from Linux to OS X.\n\nA: It's not really wise to try repartition the disk you're booted from, so Disk Utility doesn't let you.\nYou can boot from a USB key containing a recovery partition or a CD/DVD if your Mac is old enough to have a Superdrive.\n\nA: Since I'm trying to install Linux, I just booted from the Linux usb that I made, logged in with the \"test linux\" mode, then partitioned the disk using gpart. \n", "Q: Xcode: debug step into key conflict (F7) I'm trying to debug using Xcode and how can I use Step Into (F7 key) with an external keyboard (not available FN key)?\nIf I click F7 iTunes restart current song... \nAny clue?\n\nA: Check \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" in Keyboard Preferences.\n\n", "Q: Lost my Downloads folder both from Dock and Finder I did something stupid apparently and lost my Downloads folder both from Dock and then when I opened Finder to drag it down to the Dock it somehow got deleted in the desktop.\nNow although I can see the folder exists (e.g. by searching in Spotlight) I do not know how to restore it in the Dock and in Finder as well.\nAny help please?\n\nA: It sounds like when you dragged the downloads folder out of the finder sidebar it vanished before it got to the dock.\nif that is correct it is pretty easy to get it back:\n\n*\n\n*Open a Finder window and go to your user folder\n\n*In the user folder you should see the downloads folder\n\n*Drag the downloads folder to the place you want it in the sidebar\n\n*Drag the Downloads folder to the right side of the vertical bar in the Dock\n\nThe folder icons in the Finder sidebar and Dock are only pointers to the original.

I've tested my hard drive on another mac book pro same as mine and it's working perfect. So does that mean is the hard drive cable, or could be even something else, and if it's so what are my options\nThanks!\n\nA: It looks like it's the SATA Flex cable used in the MacBook Pro that has died.  I have the same laptop and it's died as well.  You can either go to the Apple Store to have it replaced for a nominal fee, or do it yourself by ordering this part.\n", "Q: How do I open a new Terminal window ssh'ed to another machine from the command line?

If I choose Locate I get a Finder window and the option to point Apple Music towards the local file, which is expected. However, and here is the rub, if I choose Cancel the song plays, the exclamation mark disappears and this  icon  appears after the title of the song. Which is unexpected but nice.\n\n\nI'd have to execute the steps under 'Files without an icon' about 6000 times to be able to play most of my tracks again.\n\nA: After a lot of trial and error and messing about with Apple script the solution turned out to be deceptively simple: Select all songs in your library and in the context menu and choose the option remove download.  \n", "Q: Privacy policy URL for app I've read through Apple's policies of whether or not to include a privacy policy URL for my app and i'm still unsure.\nIf you're currently NOT signed into GameCenter App or in Game Center in Settings App and you open my game app there will be a Game Center sign in pop up. If the user signs in, since they can sign in using my App, do I need a privacy policy URL for this?\nI have Facebook/Twitter share buttons in my app. If the user is not is NOT signed into Twitter/Facebook App and when they go to my app and click on Facebook/Twitter buttons they can not sign in via my button in my app. They must sign in the facebook/twitter app. However, once they sign in the Facebook/Twitter app and now go into my app and click the Facebook/Twitter button. They can post whatever information they want inside the button and click POST/SHARE then that information will be posted on their Facebook/Twitter accounts. Do I need a privacy policy URL for this?\n\nA: According to https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#privacy you only need a privacy policy if your app has account sign in capabilities.\n\n17.5 Apps that include account registration or access a user’s existing account must include a privacy policy or they will be rejected\n\nIf your app just links to other apps and they handle the sign in, you should be clear without needing a privacy policy. You could also rely on iOS to handle the account log in - same release from the requirement is met in that case.\n", "Q: I included emoji in my password and now I can't log in to my Account on Yosemite I wanted to check if it's possible to use emoji in a password for my Account on OS Yosemite. It worked but I didn't realize that the login screen has only native keyboards, so I can't type emoji there.\nSo the situation is that I know my password but I can't type it. The machine has rebooted to the Recovery HD and I don't see a way to enable the emoji keyboard there. In effect, since FileVault was turned on, I can't restore the password easily. \nI see three possible options here, but would be happy to hear anything else:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a way to type emoji in the password field, this would be ideal.\n\n*Access my Account from external machine that will allow me to type my password from there so I can type emoji (not sure there such a thing)\n\n*Restore the password even though I used FileVault.\n\n\nA: Adding to bmike's answer, if you can't do any of that, and don't have a recent backup, you might try connecting the disk to another computer, and mounting the volume to save your files. You can apparently do it with both mac, windows and linux.\n\nA: I solved it by the solution Apple Support suggested to do, here are the steps I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install OS X on an external drive from Recovery mode (Cmd + R while starting).\n\n*Boot from the external drive.\n\n*Install the Hex/Emoji keyboard to be able to type the relevant character.\n\n*Go to Disk Utility, choose the locked disk. Go to File -> Turn Off Encryption.\n\n*Enter your password here and leave it for couple of hours, since the decryption is going to take a while and there is no indication of progress.\n\n\n*Restart in Recovery mode again. Go to terminal and run resetpassword.\n\n*Choose your disk and create a new password for your user.\n\n*Restart and use your brand new password to login.\n\n\nA: You could use ssh, telnet, vnc/rdp, Back To My Mac or similar methods, provided they are enabled and/or available.\nAlso you could login using the default guest account or any regular user account, if available. Then:\nExecute the CLI Terminal.app; type passwd <username>; enter ⎆/return ⏎;  (where <username> is the name of the account you're locked out of..)\nYou will be prompted to enter your problematic password. Hitting ⌃+⌘+space will open a unicode tool to assist you with entering the emoji character(s).\nIf successful you will be granted the opportunity to enter a new password. Type the new password a second time (to verify) and that ought to do the trick.\n\nA: This is to go with @TomGewecke answer.\nIf you are seeing the input menu at the top right hand corner of the login screen.\nThis may only be because their is another user logged in. ( Fast user Switching).\nIf there is a user already logged in, the input menu will always show even if no users have it enabled to show in their menu bar.\nBut if there are no users already logged in then you will not get the menu,  unless you have enabled the input menu to show in the login window before.\nIf you want the keyboard layout (input menu ) to show at the login window regardless of if there are other users logged in or not with fast user switching.  Using an Admin account :\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System preferences -> Users & Groups.\n\n*SelectLogin Options.\n\n*Check Show Input menu in login window.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Then when at thelogin window:\n\n\n\nclick the Input menu (shows the name of the\n  currently selected input source next to a keyboard icon) in the\n  upper-right corner of the screen, then select the desired input source\n  or keyboard layout. If you don't see the input source you are looking\n  for, move the pointer over Other Input Sources, then select the input\n  source from the complete list that appears.\n\nApple doc\n(not originally I did not see the Unicode Hex input. As I was doing this from ScreenSharing and the Unicode Hex input was at the bottom, but of my screen. So I missed it the first time )\n\nA: Even if you're locked out, you should still have access to the Accessibility Settings part of your System Preferences, in which case you can proceed to Keyboard Preferences and adjust your peripheral input sources. This means you can add/enable \"Unicode Hex Input\". Plus, checking \"☑︎ Show Input menu in menu bar\" will allow you to \"⌨ Show Character Viewer\" and inject a variety of Unicode & Emoji characters. \n\nA: Since you have Filevault - that makes your situation precarious and a bit delicate.\nSome good news, Apple has disabled emoji entry in the password pane for 10.11 El Capitan - I can't paste or get emoji in the Users & Groups preference pane.\nApple's official manner to get past this is to click the ? in the password field and reset your password. If you used a recovery key - you can enter it without needing emoji keys. If you used AppleID, you can enter that without needing emoji.\n\nBarring that, If you have a current backup (or can let things complete if you are logged in), the fastest way froward is to wipe the Mac and then restore the backup. You can choose a new password for a new admin account and then import the user files.\nIf you have ssh enabled, or remote desktop enabled, and the Mac is still logged in to your account, you could log in to the Mac from another Mac over the network. This will not work if you have rebooted the Mac and Recovery HD boot is waiting at the Filevault unlock screen.\nIf you have a second admin account that is FileVault enabled, you could reboot and use that password to unlock the disk and then reset the password on your main account. Lastly, you could boot to recovery HD or internet recovery and reinstall the OS to a USB drive. Then you can mount the file vault drive and have emoji to unlock the volume and make a new admin account through various tricks / procedures similar to using single user mode to remove the .AppleSetupDone file.\n\nA: If you have \"Other Input Sources\" available at the top right of your login screen, select the one called Unicode Hex Input.  This can be used to input emoji (or any other character) into the password field, as long as you know the Unicode Hex number of the character.  This number can be found in the Character Viewer or on the internet.\nSome items you find in the  \"emoji\" category have Unicode hex numbers with just 4 characters, such as Airplane U+2708 ✈.  With the Unicode Hex Input keyboard, you input this by holding down the Option key while you type 2708.  \nOther emoji have Unicode hex numbers with 5 characters, such as Grinning Face U+1F600 .  For these you need to find the two corresponding UTF-16 Hex codes (sometimes called \"surrogates\") by consulting Character Viewer or using an internet source like fileformat.info.  For 1F600 these are D83D and DE00.  You can input 1F600 by holding down the option key while typing D83DDE00.  You may see two dots in the field, but it is still just one character.  \n\nA: I am not a Mac user so this may be nonsense. However since the situation is desperate, I'll offer it anyway.\n\nUnicode Hex Input\nYou can use the utility in OS X to generate many Unicode characters by\n  manually inputting the hexadecimal code. Other options include saving\n  word processor files as Unicode or UTF text. \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure you have activated the Unicode Hex Input keyboard. See the activate keyboards section for more details.\n  \n*Open an application which supports Unicode HexInput such as TextEdit. TextEdit is installed with OS X and can be opened from the\n  Dock or the Applications folder.\n  \n*Switch keyboards to the Unicode Hex Input from the flag icon dropdown menu on the upper right. If the Unicode Hex Option is grayed\n  out, then you are in an application which does not support this\n  utility. Note:  Most current applications support this keyboard, but\n  some old versions of software may not. \n  \n*To input a specific character, hold down the option key, then type in the four-digit hexadecimal Unicode value (e.g. 044D = Cyrillic э).\n  Charts listing Unicode values for different scripts are available at\n  www.unicode.org/charts.\nhttp://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/keyboards/mackey.html#unihex\n\n", "Q: Is the Google Chrome for 32bit Mac I am running Mac OS X 10.6.8.

If someone has a nervous habit, such as twirling their hair, drumming on the desk, etc, throughout the day, using the hand that the Apple Watch is worn on, can this throw off activity readings (and sitting/standing reminders, etc)?\nOne would assume that the watch double-checks things like this by measuring heart rate, etc, to be sure, but I'm wondering about the technical implementation.\n\nA: Yes it can. Only exercise uses heart rate currently to gauge effort. I know of several people that figured out how to game the stand goal while flying in an airplane by just moving one forearm. \nThe accelerometer algorithm for standing can't really tell why your hand moves when it is checking for sedentary conditions.

For example, if I am logged in to Facebook or StackExchange the before a restart, then after the restart I will be prompted to log in to the site again.\nSimply restarting Safari doesn't cause the problem nor does logging out and logging back in - It only occurs on an OS X restart.\nThe other interesting thing is that if I log in and start Safari immediately after the machine restart then my web sessions are still active but after about 30 seconds I will be logged out of the site.  \nFor example, if Safari automatically restores the tab with Facebook I will see my Facebook feed and then after about 30 seconds a pop up comes up asking me to log in to Facebook.\nThis only seems to affect my user account and only on this one computer and it seems to affect any site with a log in, but not \"insecure\" cookies.

eventually just learned to live without it.\nThere's a script in the .dmg to uninstall it automatically.\nIf you don't have it, you can get it from https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/downloads/detail?name=Soundflower-1.6.6b.dmg\nIf you really need the internal routing facility & can't use existing structures like ReWire, paid alternatives are:-  \n\n\n*\n\n*Rogue Amoeba's Audio Hijack - simple pictorial internal routing, far more comprehensive than soundflower, but doesn't specifically use multi-channel routing afaik & isn't specifically designed just to route, but to be its own recorder  \n\n*Plogue Bidule - which is capable of routing your brain to your navel, using your fridge & the current windspeed as modulators [not really, but it's ridiculously comprehensive]... if you can figure the darn thing out ;-)\n\n", "Q: Can I run apps on iPhone without paying to be a developer? I am new to ios development.\nI am using Xcode 6.4 and iOS 8.4.1, when I'm trying to run my app on\nmy device I get this message from xcode:\n\nNo valid signing identities (i.e. certificate and private key pair)\n  matching the team ID “(null)” were found.\nXcode can attempt to fix this issue.\n\nAnd when clicking \"Fix issue\" it suggesting me to enrol Apple's dev program. I would rather not be a paid developer - is that the only way forward?\n\nA: You need to make your apps in Xcode 7 to run on your iDevice without any developer program. You need to sign in with your Apple ID. For more details visit the Xcode 7 site. It's in beta 6 now.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/xcode/\nIf you need Xcode 6 or lower, paying the fee is the only alternative.\n", "Q: How to run AppleScript (.scpt) as LaucnDaemon by root I have an AppleScript or set of Applescripts that I am trying to run as a LaunchDaemon. I have no problem running the LaunchDaemon with my user. The problem comes in where I have the need to read a file that is only readable by root, this is by design for security reasons as the file contains sensitive information. \nI have installed the necessary precompiled AppleScript files, the .scpt files, in:\n/Library/Scripts/myApplication/\n\nI have put my plists under:\n/Library/LaunchDaemons\n\nEdit:\nHere is the plist for my Daemon:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\"     \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.mycompany.myapp.service</string>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n      <string>/usr/bin/osascript</string>\n      <string>/Library/Scripts/myApp/myApp.scpt</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n\nNow, when I try to load the plists using launchctl and sudo \nsudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mycompany.myapp.service.plist\n\nI get errors in the systemlog.log:\nAug 26 17:54:13 computername com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.mycompany.myapp.service[74757]): Service exited with abnormal code: 1\nAug 26 17:54:13 computername com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.mycompany.myapp.service): Service only ran for 0 seconds. Pushing respawn out by 10 seconds.\n\nHowever if I drop the \"sudo\" from the launchctl command it works perfectly. I have even tried running the scripts from the terminal as the root user, which also works fine. However, as soon as I try to load them with launchctl and sudo everything dies.\nIn order to get this script to run previously I had to give the application running the script accessibility privileges on the machine, so previously Sublime Text 2, Terminal and Script Editor. I am guessing that this what is causing the script to not run but I do not know which program to enable under accessibility, since I am not being prompted. So how do I get this script to run the way I need it to?\n\nA: Assuming your launchd job is correctly set-up, you may be reaching a limitation of AppleScript.\nAppleScript Requires a GUI (Aqua Session)\nIf your AppleScript is launched using launchd as a user root process, it will not have a graphical user interface associated. The majority of AppleScript requires a graphic user interface to work consistently. Depending on the version of OS X, it may work, but it is not designed to.\nProcesses on OS X can not trivially cross between user sessions.\nDo Shell Script\nA more robust approach is to separate out the functionality needing higher privileges into a shell script such as bash, perl, ruby, or python.\nYour AppleScript can then call that script using AppleScript's do shell script:\ndo shell script \"command\" user name \"me\" password \"mypassword\" with administrator privileges\n\nIf you need to avoid embedding a username and password, this is possible but beyond the scope of this question.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Wi-Fi problems after Yosemite 10.10.5 update I've had my Macbook Pro for about a year now. It is a late 2013 Retina model running Yosemite. Until a few days ago, its Wi-Fi worked fine. However, after the 10.10.5 update, its Wi-Fi has become very slow and drops packets unless I'm a foot away from my wifi router. When I'm in my usual location of the next room, ping times go up to hundreds of milliseconds. \nshanglin$ ping 192.168.1.1  \nPING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1): 56 data bytes  \nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 0  \n64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=944.501 ms  \n64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=325.487 ms  \n64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=78.760 ms  \n64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=126.286 ms  \nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 5  \n64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=6 ttl=64 time=41.813 ms  \n^C  \n--- 192.168.1.1 ping statistics ---  \n8 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 37.5% packet loss  \nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 41.813/303.369/944.501/335.189 ms \n\nNone of the other devices on my Wi-Fi network are having a problem. I've tried removing plist files from SystemConfiguration, and I've turned off Bluetooth.\nMy Wi-Fi router is a Cisco E1200 running 802.11n on the 2.4GHz band. I don't think it can run on the 5GHz band. I've tried updating the router's firmware to the latest, but it has not helped.\nAny suggestions that could help? \n\nA: Jeez, those ping results are terrible.\nI'm on El Capitan now, but I can relate to your frustrations about the wifi. My macbook pro is a late 2012 model. I travel with my laptop and rely on it as my phone. It was a real show stopper when wifi would completely bork on the road as in not letting me connect to open SSIDs.\nI made this extreme script to wipe out wifi settings and it worked for me, but it is a pain to re-enter ssid/passwords etc and for some reason the problem would show up every now and then. \nFor me, if wi-fi doesn't work what's the point of having a keychain? I just wanted it to work, so I was willing to wipe things out to make it so. Mac OSX will create new clandestine defaults, but obviously if you want your passwords to friend's wifi etc, backup your keychain.\nYou can try the script but be warned, it may not fix your problem, it may even make things worse. I do not accept responsibility for use of this script. Please look at the files and directories it is deleting.\nAlternately copy and paste everything but the \"#!/bin/sh\" bit and run it in a terminal, I have it in script form because it was a recurring issue for me on Yosemite, the problem went away when I either upgraded or clean installed Mavericks (can't remember which I did), so I would consider upgrading your OS to Mavericks possibly. El Capitan is still painful right now with bugs and so on, but at least wifi works.\n#!/bin/sh\ncd /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration\nrm com.apple.accounts.exists.plist \nrm com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\nrm com.apple.captive.probe.plist\nrm com.apple.network.eapolclient.configuration.plist\nrm com.apple.smb.server.plist\nrm NetworkInterfaces.plist\nrm preferences.plist\n\n", "Q: Encrypting from the Disk Utility vs Finder I am testing two methods of encrypting a new hard drive. Using Disk Utility, I erased it and created two equal partitions (10GB each, the rest free space), both \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\".\n1) From Disk Utility, I selected the first partition (Seagate1 below). Then, from the \"Erase\" tab, I selected \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\". Next, I clicked on the \"Erase\" button. It encrypted it right away, as explained below.\n2) In the Finder, I selected the second partition (Seagate2), then selected \"Encrypt\" from the Finder gear-like drop down menu. It stated encrypting it, at a rate of maybe 100MB/sec (also explained below).\nBelow is the output of \"distill cs list\". I know 1) was instantaneous and 2) took 100 sec roughly because I looked at the partial results.\nSo it looks like the approach 2) is encrypting the entire empty partition.\ni)  Is this the only difference between 1) and 2)?\nii) In particular, what does \"Revertible: No\" mean for Seagate1 (see below)?\niii) Which approach is safe for Time Machine backups?  I do not want to use the \"encrypt backups\" option in the time machine because I want to know what is going on.\nI found this post somewhat helpful, but it does not answer question iii). The poster is talking about my method 1) vs the TM \"encrypt backups\" option. The conclusion is that they are the same. I would guess that TM \"encrypt backups\" is the same as my method 2).\nDifference between enabling Time Machine's \"Encrypt Backups\" option, and encrypting from Disk Utility?\n\n$ diskutil cs list\n\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (3 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group E374A008-44C9-4A5F-877E-1A14186EE3C1\n|   =========================================================\n|   Name:         Macintosh HD\n...\n...\n+-- Logical Volume Group D3D788DF-C76A-43B9-8325-A8E875E3720A\n|   =========================================================\n|   Name:         Seagate1\n|   Status:       Online\n|   Size:         10000007168 B (10.0 GB)\n|   Free Space:   782336 B (782.3 KB)\n|   |\n|   +- Logical Volume Family AAFDF6DC-ECEE-4919-9FD9-A3A6E3F1CCEF\n|       ----------------------------------------------------------\n|       Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n|       Encryption Type:         AES-XTS\n|       Conversion Status:       Complete\n|       Conversion Direction:    -none-\n|       Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes\n|       Fully Secure:            Yes\n|       Passphrase Required:     Yes\n|       |\n|       +-> Logical Volume B5EA0F9F-55D6-48BF-BBD0-FBA00B595D6F\n|           ---------------------------------------------------\n|           Disk:                  disk3\n|           Status:                Online\n|           Size (Total):          9646899200 B (9.6 GB)\n|           Conversion Progress:   -none-\n|           Revertible:            No\n|           LV Name:               Seagate1\n|           Volume Name:           Seagate1\n|           Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group 31EFE91B-0384-4D1F-B706-493509FBC66F\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         Seagate2\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         10000007168 B (10.0 GB)\n    Free Space:   19005440 B (19.0 MB)\n    |\n    +- Logical Volume Family E5AFD11D-75E5-4ACB-8687-D740C1ED99AC\n        ----------------------------------------------------------\n        Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n        Encryption Type:         AES-XTS\n        Conversion Status:       Complete\n        Conversion Direction:    -none-\n        Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes\n        Fully Secure:            Yes\n        Passphrase Required:     Yes\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume 31DE3F9A-F7FD-4898-B3D7-C9222D38B943\n            ---------------------------------------------------\n            Disk:                  disk4\n            Status:                Online\n            Size (Total):          9628680192 B (9.6 GB)\n            Conversion Progress:   Complete\n            Revertible:            Yes (unlock and decryption required)\n            LV Name:               Seagate2\n            Volume Name:           Seagate2\n            Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n\n\nA: The difference with method 1 is that, with method 1, you're not actually converting anything. You're erasing the existing data and replacing it with an encrypted partition. With method 2, a conversion process begins, which doesn't erase data, but does take more time.\nThe thing to keep in mind: any drive which is converted from a normal drive (HFS+) to a Core Storage drive can be reverted back to a simple HFS+ volume (non-encrypted). If you use the Disk Utility method you showed above, the resulting disk will NOT be revertible, because the disk will have never been an HFS+ volume in the first place. That is what you're seeing with \"Revertible: No\". If you use the Finder method (or the equivalent command-line option), the drive will be revertible.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that modern versions of OS X will normally use Core Storage on the boot drive by default, even on unencrypted disks. The result is that, in some cases, \"Revertible\" may always be \"No\". You'll always be able to decrypt a Core Storage volume however, so perhaps this is insignificant for most people.\nIf you want to talk about what's the best option for Time Machine, it doesn't really matter. The end result is, in either case, an encrypted disk, protected by a password. To do anything to the disk you would need the password. There isn't any significant difference to either method. It's marginally possible that the disk utility method could be the slightest bit more secure, for the simple reason that this reduces the number of attack vectors. If there is any benefit, it would only be slight.\n", "Q: What are \"Popular Apps\" on the Mac App Store?

I am saving emails in the archive option on my  macbook air. \nWhat is the quantity limit??\n\nA: I doubt you'll reach a limit.\nHFS+ which stores the file limits you to 2.1 billion files in a folder so you could have a lot of emails stored to archive. When you go to archive them, that one file holding billions of messages could grow to a size of 8 EB (and one exabyte is one million terabytes) so there's really little chance Mail app will prevent you from archiving an absurdly silly number of messages.\n", "Q: I think my iphone 5's battery have some problem.

In the meantime i didn't used my phone so is there a battery issue or some thing else???\n\nA: Apple has a battery replacement program for iPhone 5. You can check eligibility on this Apple page\n\nApple has determined that a very small percentage of iPhone 5 devices may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently. The affected iPhone 5 devices were sold between September 2012 and January 2013 and fall within a limited serial number range. (...)\nThe program covers affected iPhone 5 batteries for two years after the first retail sale of the unit or until March 1, 2015, whichever provides longer coverage.\n\n\nA: First, check to see what application is consuming battery power. To check this, open Settings>General>Usage. Under Battery, touch 'Battery Usage'. After some loading time, you will see a list of Applications that have used Battery power in the last 24 hrs and last 7 days. If there is an application using a significant percentage of power that you have not used, you may wish to kill that app or restart your iPhone.\nSpecifically to the iPhone 5, see @Tetsujin response on extended warranty from Apple.\n", "Q: iPhone security question I think I made a rather stupid mistake\nMy iPhone battery was getting old, so I went to a local repair shop to get it replaced. It's not an Apple Store, just a  couple of guys who fix PCs and do odd jobs like that.\nThey agreed, and said I could come back in an hour. When I came back, they said the phone was ready but asked me to provide my PIN. I don't know why this was necessary, but stupidly, I gave it to one of the guys. He turned on the phone, then unplugged it and gave it to me.\nI now realise that in the time I had been gone they could have taken an entire image of my phone onto their PCs. They now have the PIN too, so is this  a massive security risk for me?\nI have changed all the passwords to all the emails, facebook, and Apple ID. No idea what else could I do? I feel really stupid for giving up the password to them.\nWhat could they do with the the data they (might) have? What is the possible damage? Any steps I could take to minimise any possible harm?\n\nA: From your description, they had the PIN for only the time it took to unlock it, check it was working & hand it to you - a matter of seconds. \nThere's nothing else they can do with it unless they also still have your phone.\nThe PIN itself doesn't provide access to anything other than the phone, has nothing to do with your iCloud account, App Store, iTunes, email... or anything else.\nIn you post you mention both the PIN & the password. These are two entirely different things. You ought to edit your question to clarify which you actually mean.\n", "Q: Can a dedicated GPU use/share system RAM in addition to the VRAM included with it? The Macbook Pro laptop, running OS X, has a AMD GPU which includes graphics memory of 256 MB. Is it possible for the machine to run an application that requires 512 MB video memory by sharing some of the system RAM?\n(There is also an integrated graphics card but this has a max (shared) VRAM of around 380 MB. AFAIK it cannot go over this.)\nIs there any way an application with video memory requirements of 512MB could be run on this machine?\n\nA: I believe \"NO\" is also an answer :(\nThe physical and design of the discrete (AMD in your case, nVidia in other MBPs) is such that their VRAM is on separate bus connected only to the GPU.\nThe IGPs (which are part of the CPU's die, ie. physical chip) shared the DRAM of the computer. That is where the term \"shared\" memory comes in, because the CPU and IGP have a shared access to the \"computer's\" RAM :)\nThus, if your application needs 512MB display memory, then you are out of luck with your current MBP ;(  \n", "Q: What's a font name table and why do so many free fonts have a \"minor issue\" with its structure?

I am submitting an app to the App Store and need to include album art in my screenshots in order to show off my app. The app pulls album art and music from SoundCloud's library so there is really no other way to demo my app without including album art. Here is an example of my screen shots.\nSo my question is, is this protected by fair use? And if not, is there a work around for somehow being able to display cover art? Like this? \n\n\n\nA: Your best bet would be to contact several bands and ask for written permission to use their art in your promotion.\nMy expectation on reading all the terms of service of many music streaming services is that they do not grant a commercial license to any of the content they provide, so you would be scraping that content against the terms of service. To my reading this is explicitly prohibited by SoundCloud:\n\n(ii) You must not adapt, copy, republish, make available or otherwise communicate to the public, display, perform, transfer, share, distribute or otherwise use or exploit any Content on or from the Platform, except (i) where such Content is Your Content, or (ii) as permitted under these Terms of Use, and within the parameters set by the Uploader (for example, under the terms of Creative Commons licences selected by the Uploader).\n(iii) You must not use any Content (other than Your Content) in any way that is designed to create a separate content service or that replicates any part of the Platform offering.\n\nThat alone should land you in hot water with Apple's review team.\nIf I were submitting an app, I would be forthright and proactive about mentioning that the artwork submitted is authorized in writing by the owners and/or properly licensed. SoundCloud also makes note that you can re-use your owned content or content that you have a license to use (uploaded content with CreativeCommons that is permissive enough for commercial reuse should do the trick if you don't have a more specific license)\nIf you can't do that, pay an artist to make a fake album cover - perhaps mixing elements you like and paying that artist for the rights to their work. You can upload content to soundcloud quite easily so you could control that image in a manner that Apple could rapidly determine that your company was in fact the original rights holder to the content chosen for the full screen image if not for all of the smaller thumbnails.\nFair Use is only of use in the US as a defense if you are sued in court. Expecting it to get you past Apple's policies seems like an uphill battle as you don't have a right to dispute their policies and they are fairly clear that 3.1 of https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/#photography\n\nShow only content you have the legal right to display.\n\nThere is some precedent that thumbnail images are allowable under fair use doctrine by internet search engines, but that's a far stretch from you selecting one static image for promoting your work on a third party app store.\nYour defense might be you are in fact \"Display the app on an Apple product exactly as a customer will experience it when the app is running.\" but you run the risk of Apple asking you for confirmation that you have licensed that content - either from SoundCloud or the holder of the copyright on the album cover you choose for self-promotion.\n", "Q: Stop Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client from starting up automatically So I am currently running:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X 10.10.5\n\n*Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 4.1.04011\n\n\nI boot up my laptop and AnyConnect is running.  I go into Preferences...Users & Groups and remove /Applications/Cisco/Cisco from my list of login items then I quit AnyConnect.\nShut down...turn computer on later and it's back running and it's back in my login items list.\nThe company I work for only uses AnyConnect for VPN.\nIs there a way for me to keep AnyConnect out of my login items list?\nIt's not that I mind it running in the background but if it is it's in my command + tab, etc... and I just find it annoying.\n\nA: Removing the following worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagent.plist\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cisco.anyconnect.gui.plist\nUpdate:\nFor macOS Catalina and anyconnect 4.7.x removing this single file seems to be enough:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cisco.anyconnect.gui.plist\n\nA: If it's not in \"Login Items\" then it has to be in launchctl. Always prefer the user interface when there is one rather than messing with files directly:\n launchctl list | grep -i cisco\n launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.cisco.anyconnect.gui.plist\n launchctl list | grep -i cisco\n\n # Load it back\n launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.cisco.anyconnect.gui.plist\n launchctl list | grep -i cisco\n\nNB: be careful NOT to run sudo launchctl and NOT to run launchctl from a root terminal, because launchctl is user-dependent. For example, trying to run sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.cisco.anyconnect.gui.plist results in an error \"Could not find specified service\", whereas without the sudo  it works.\nWhen there's a user interface it's very likely because it does more than just moving one file. Don't take the risk to miss those extra bits; use the official and documented user interface.\nlaunchctl is the equivalent of systemd on Linux or services.msc on Windows. Every mac user should have at least some vague idea of what launchctl does because it manages far more than AnyConnect: basically every process not manually started by the user.\nlaunchctl is documented in (surprise) man launchctl but that's not for the faint of heart. For a friendlier documentation that does not assume you already know the difference between \"loading\" versus \"starting\" or between a \"daemon\" vs a \"service\" or an \"agent\" go to http://www.launchd.info/ first.\nAs a bonus and slightly off-topic answer, here's a clean way to restart the AnyConnect daemon in case it gets stuck as it sometimes does. This is the other, lower-level AnyConnect process(es) without any user interface and running as root that does the actual work:\n  sudo launchctl kickstart -kp system/com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagentd\n\nAvoid kill and killall, see why on http://www.launchd.info/\nBe careful where you use sudo since some of the agents and daemons run in user space and some run in system space and different versions of macOS have different syntax and shells.\n\nA: Forget about tricky removals of plists and stuff like that, just rename Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client in Finder, that´s it.\nEdit: Strange I got a downvote, because I just tested it myself, and it works without any problems at all.

I finally discovered the 3 plist files that appear to control this in /Library/LaunchDaemons. But I couldn't change the RunAtLoad parameter to false, because even after I changed the file permissions I couldn't save the plist files. I  finally changed the folder permissions to read and write and applied those changes to the contained items, and at last I've been able to edit and save. I'll know for sure after the next reboot ... something I'll do in a few days because starting up again takes forever.\n\nA: So it would seem that if you only install the VPN client AnyConnect will not autostart.\nI uninstalled AnyConnect (version 4.x) then reinstalled doing a custom install.

Just moving it from the Applications folder is enough to stop the process that starts it from finding it.\n\nA: It is not the permission of the file itself that prevents you from editing, it is the permission of the containing folder. Then, you should not change the permissions of such system files for security reasons. But it is easy to edit these files: Simply copy them to some other place where you have permission to write to files, e.g. the Desktop, and edit the files there. Then move them back in with replacing option and authenticating as an administrator and the file is edited.\nHowever, I do not see those three files you seem to mention. I find on my system only 'com.cisco.anyconnect.ciscod.plist' and 'com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagentd.plist' in the directory '/Library/LaunchAgents'. Perhaps more importantly, while setting in these two files the parameter 'RunAtLoad' to 'false' indeed prevents the annoying reinstallation of the application 'Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.app' as a login item after a restart, it also makes the vpn in general disfunctional.\nHas anyone found actually a solution?\n", "Q: Only half of my contacts from iPhone 4 sync to iCloud I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 7.1.2 (latest available for my phone apparently). I have about 500 contacts on my iPhone, however only 203 of them appear on iCloud.com. I cannot get the rest to sync with iCloud and you can imagine that manually re-adding about 300 contacts, one by one, sounds rather terrifying. I tried all the tips I could find, i.e. turning off and on the \"Contacts\" in the iCloud settings on my phone, logging off iCloud on all devices, restarting my phone and Mac, etc. Nothing changed.\n\nA: Contacts app have groups of contacts, ie. Google contacts, Hotmail contacts, Facebook contacts and then iCloud contacts. To see the different groups, go to Contacts, at the very top you will see Groups, just tick iCloud and untick the rest.

I'm about to download a 1TB collection of files. It'll take about 7 days.\nI want to make sure that my computer doesn't shut down or restart while the download is happening.\n\nA: I found a simple solution that's been working for 6 days. Even when I intentionally try to restart my computer as a test, the computer stays on.\nWhat I did is leave a Word Doc open with random text in it, but I didn't save it.\nThat shows me an error when my computer tries to restart, but it keeps the system on.\n\n\nA: Go to System Preferences —› Security and Privacy —› Advanced..., then uncheck Log out after X minutes of inactivity.\nYou may need to enter your admin password before you can access this button.\nI had a similar question and this fixed it.\nEDIT: Also, make sure automatic updates are off. This is in the Software Update → Advanced area of System Preferences.\n\nA: I've been trying to accomplish this for quite some time now. I've tried various quick fixes and solutions over the years, none of which have been completely bulletproof, or simply not viable for other reasons. \nThe reason for all this\nIs in 99% of the cases the the os wants to update itself, or system apps. And yes, this despite turning off all settings pertaining to automatic updates in the osx settings. Simply put; Apple wants YOU to always update your mac!  IMHO, It's actually a serious issue that apple doesn't want to allow you to be truly in control of your own computers' behavior... But that's another question.\nIf the OS gets a shutdown/reboot command it will get intercepted, and a user prompt pops up. However sadly, after a while if no user input is given, the computer will still shutdown/reboot. To my knowledge there is no way to completely prevent a reboot of OSX for more than about three months. This is my own experience, anyway.\nI am currently using the following solution, which ensures computer stays on for on average 30 days (without any user input, longer if periodically logged into and doing stuff), while still allowing the computer to run screensaver, log out the user, and going into power-saving mode. On demand, I can easily shutdown or reboot the computer using the standard GUI.\nI created a bash-script that I saved on the desktop containing the following code:\npreventreboot.sh\nwhile :\ndo\n    echo \"This BASH-Script prevents automatic reboot of this computer. Press [CTRL+C] or shutdown this terminal to disable and allow automatic reboot.\"\n    sleep 30\ndone\n\nI use automator to run this script with sudo, in an open terminal window on every startup/login. \nI hope this answer helps anyone out there who wants their computer staying on!\n\nA: There may be a piece of commercial software that can intercept a call to reboot/shutdown however I do not know what it is, if it exists.  My suggestion, despite you editing out the issue in your OP, is to fix the issue and not look for a workaround!\nThat said, I give you a workaround that you certainly can test and it should prevent a software call to reboot/shutdown however if the reboot/shutdown is being caused by a hardware issue then this will not work.\nYou can rename the reboot and shutdown commands in: /sbin\nExample in a Terminal:\nsudo mv /sbin/reboot /sbin/reboot.ori\nsudo mv /sbin/shutdown /sbin/shutdown.ori\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: Once you renamed the reboot and shutdown commands the Apple menu's Reboot... and Shut Down... commands will not work.\n\n\nIf you need to reboot/shutdown, before renaming them back, you'll have to do it from a Terminal using: sudo /sbin/reboot.ori or sudo /sbin/shutdown.ori\nThe reason you need to do both, even though you say it rebooting not shutting down, is because without knowing the cause of your reboot issue the shutdown command can be use to reboot not just the reboot command, e.g. shutdown -r now will immediately reboot the system.\n\nA: Another good workaround I discovered is to use Terminal to interrupt the shutdown process:\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal then go to Terminal menu > Preferences > Shell. Set it to Always ask before closing.\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups > User account > Login Items.\n\n*Add the terminal app and set it to hide.\n\nWhenever the computer attempts to restart, it will hang on the terminal app. It will not force close it and will abort the shutdown instead. Since it is also set to auto-start terminal app silently on login, it will always prompt you whenever you restart. If the shutdown/restart is intentional, you can just hit Close when prompted by Terminal.\nThis was tested on High Sierra. Not sure if it is also effective for newer mac os and/or automatic mac os updates.\n", "Q: iMac cleanup: can I delete these files? Using Omni Disk Sweeper, I have listed the very heavy files in my computer in order to, if possible, delete them and free up some space.\nOf course, I am not going to risk tampering with my system folder, but there are some pretty big files about which I would like to know whether or not it is safe to delete them.

I wouldn't ask such a question if I hadn't been using Mac computers for the past 20 years and been able to explore and modify System files for many years; I believe modifying the System files can lead to problems... However some of these files look like they can be rebuilt by the system whenever needed, or are backups files/folders that one can easily part with without any consequences.\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: Looking just at the big parts\n\n\n*\n\n*You shouldn't touch anything in /private, as these are files used by OSX.\n\n*Removing unneeded drivers from /Library/Printers shouldn't pose a problem (I only have the Canon drivers for the model I'm actually using in there)\n\n*.../iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications contains all the apps you've ever purchased.

I used ccleaner - but they all seem to have similar features.  But actually I find OS X does a decent job removing cache files so I don't do it anymore.\nThe mobile applications in iTunes is a mess.  I had its content removed once - but I kept getting  applications disappearing from the iPhone.  So I would only delete apps from within iTunes.  \nAbout uninstalling application data from library I was horribly disappointed by the apps that promised they would do this.  IMO the only solution is they need to be discussed folder by folder and then removed - just too much work for me.\nMobile documents is where iCloud documents are stored.  I wouldn't touch this.\n\nA: Personally I would avoid deleting system files and have other software do this for you. I would recommend the following Tools: \n\n\n*\n\n*Onyx: It cleans cache files, etc. and runs maintenance scripts\n\n*Monolingual: Delete unnecessary language files\n\n\nAlso have a look at the answers to this question. \n", "Q: Can I delete photo files from Mac desktop after import to Photo? I'm using Yosemite's Photos app (switching from iPhoto).\nI had a bunch of image files (about 200) on my desktop which I imported with the new Photos app.\nI want to clean up my desktop, as all the image files are still there. The issue is that I've always found it bit confusing as far as where the source image files are stored for the iPhoto and Photos app.\nI assume that they'll be gone altogether if I delete the files from my desktop. Is this correct?\n\nA: OS X (10.10) Yosemite's Photos app stores all photos in its own library.\nYou can find this library in your «Pictures» folder (/Users/USERNAME/Pictures/Photos Library).\nSo any image that is imported is stored in that library (unless you have specified otherwise in the Photos app's preferences).\n\n has made a nice «Get started» page you should take a look at. There it states:\n\nPhotos stores your library in the Pictures folder on your Mac by\n  default.\n\n\nAs a conclusion: You can safely delete any image files that has already been imported.\n\nOn a side note: You can also view the raw image files inside the Photos Library by right clicking, selecting Show Package Contents and navigating to the Masters folder.\n\nA: The Photos App stores your photos in its own library.\nCheck your settings (see screenshot) to be sure they were copied to the library.  If so, then they are safe to delete.\nTo get to the Settings, in the Menu bar select Photos > Preferences... [command ⌘+,]\nIf you really want to be sure, move them to a flash drive or other location. Open Photos and see if the photos are still there.  If so, then they were copied.  If not, set the Import settings to copy and reimport them into Photos after you adjust the settings as shown below.\n\n", "Q: Since Yosemite upgrade, I always need to \"force eject\" drives?

(in most cases)? I am sorry if this is too little information for now to troubleshoot it, I am willing to share more info on my current settings - just tell me how.\n\nA: You can find out what's using the volume with the command:\nsudo lsof +D '/Volumes/volumename'\n\nNote that sudo will prompt for your admin password, and it won't echo as you type. The first column will list the name(s) of the processes using files on the volume. In my personal experience, the culprit is usually \"mds\" and/or \"mds_store\". These processes are both involved in indexing the files so that Spotlight can search them quickly.\nSometimes they seem to let loose of disk and allow a normal eject, but sometimes not. Unfortunately, I don't know of a real solution; sometimes you just have to use Force Eject.\n", "Q: Can I move Mobile Sync folder to another HD Can I move my MobileSync folder to another HD on my iMac to free up space on my startup HD?\n\nA: You can move the folder to another drive, then use a symbolic link back to the original location, so iTunes can still find it.\nA symbolic link is a bit like a shortcut or alias, that the system can use to target a file or folder in another location.\nBecause of the rather arcane method you'd need to employ in Terminal to generate them, I've always used a little freeware app that sets itself up as a Service in OS X, meaning you can access it through the right-click menu - SymbolicLinker\nAfter Installing this [reboot may be required if it doesn't immediately show in the right-click menu], the procedure would be  \n\n\n*\n\n*Move your MobileSync folder to your new drive, Cmd/drag will move rather than copy.  \n\n*Right-click the folder in its new location, go to Services at the bottom of the menu, then Make Symbolic Link  \n\n*Cmd/drag the created link back to the original location in ~Library/Application Support/  \n\n*Change its name to remove the 'symlink' at the end, so it has the original name MobilSync  \n\n*Done.\n\n", "Q: Edit Table of Contents in Preview?

Workarounds? I have a lot of files on an external drive to my new MBP and there's too many of them for the internal 500GB SSD (and no second drive bay to make a fusion drive or have a second drive in latest MBP which is completely crap BTW Apple).\nSo I need to have my usual Finder shortcuts to directories deep within the data tree. Problem is if my ext drive is ever switched off or disconnected why my MBP is on the shortcuts get removed by Finder and don't come back when drive is reconnected. My usual method of making these shortcuts is just to drag a directory from the Finder file list into the Finder window sidebar. I'm not sure what this actually prompts behind the curtain of OS X as it's opaque (to me at least) as to whether aliases are stored somewhere or symlinks or so other class of object to track the location.\nI'm wondering if I can create shortcuts to symlink files on my internal SSD that link to directories on my ext HDD as a work around to this very frustrating obstacle.\n\nA: You don't say how you created the \"shortcuts\". If you used Finder to make Alias OS X creates a complex (and very large) file. These are probably OK, if you want that kind of thing, but OS X has functionality to locate files if they move, and presumably doesn't show them if not present. (I can't verify this as I don't use Alias, except for software testing, and never to external drives.)\nI suggest you create symlinks, which are much smaller,and hang around, even if the target disappears. Unfortunately the only way to create symlinks is with a command, although I have created a Service to run this in Finder.\nThe following is an script, which I run as an Automator workflow.\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n fileSuffix=\"link\"\n fileExists=`ls -d \"$f $fileSuffix\"`\n fileNumber=0\n\n until [ $fileExists==\"\" ]; do\n  let fileNumber+=1\n  fileSuffix=\"link $fileNumber\"\n  fileExists=`ls -d \"$f $fileSuffix\"`\n done\n\n echo \"$f $fileSuffix\"\n ln -s \"$f\" \"$f $fileSuffix\"\ndone\n\n\n", "Q: How to open a new blank document in Pages from spotlight?

In Yosemite, opening folders in a new window by default is extremely difficult.\nYou can press CMD as you click (not optimal) or right-click/option-click the folder to open in a new window (not optimal).\nThe solution that seems to work best for me is to hide the toolbar whenever I open / create a new folder, because folders inside windows that do not have a toolbar will always open in a new window.\nBut the toolbar always reappears whenever I create a new folder. \nSo, ideally, I would love to have it ALWAYS hidden by default, and on rare occasions when I need it (to look at external drives, or drag an item into the application folder for example), I would shortcut-make it appear, ta-daam.\n\nA: This should work:\n\n*\n\n*Close all open Finder windows\n\n*Open a New Finder window and arrange it to your liking.\n\n*From the Menu select View then Show View Options ⌘+J\n\n*Click the Use as Defaults button at the bottom.\n\n\n\nToolbar\nAlso, the View Menu shows many shortcuts to toggle view options.\n\n\nA: on monterey they seem to have removed the \"set as default option\"\nEDIT: for column view that is\n", "Q: How do I prevent my Mac from resetting the software update download every time i resume it?

Since I've had some wireless connectivity issues with the present version, I thought it would be wise enough to install the latest version and see if the issue has been totally dealt with.

In the way to reduce the power usage of my iPhone 5 (iOS 8), I'm simulating the power saving mode of Samsung Galaxy Note 4 by turning on the \"Greyscale mode\"\nbut does it really reduce the power usage and why ?\n\nA: There are two approaches that could lead to less power consumption:\n\n\n*\n\n*a display that is enabled to have a dedicated greyscale mode; less pixels to be in charge of\n\n*software that automatically renders \"less\" if you tell it not to render any colors\n\n\nWhilst the first is definitely not applicable as the iPhone features an LCD screen, the latter is something I once inspected. I made an iPhone draw a couple of dozen lines per second and then print how many it could render  in 30 seconds.\nHaving the accessibility feature enabled I hoped for a higher score in my little \"benchmark\". However, it resulted in no improvement at all. Actually the iPhone was slower having grayscale activated.\nIt might be misleading but a lower benchmark, here, indicates more CPU cycles, hence more power consumption.\nSo unless the iPhone actually caps CPU power on grayscale mode (which I doubt) your iPhone consumes even more power in grayscale more. This is probably due to the fact that it first renders the view in color, then caches it and puts the gray-filter on it.\nSide fact: on iOS9 you will have a \"low power mode\" available for your iPhone. I already use iOS9 on my main device on a daily basis and the power saving functionality is awesome! My iPhone survived a 6-day music festival whilst taking pictures, checking mail in the mornings and sometimes calling people. So don't worry about it too much, in a few weeks your iPhone will last surprisingly long. \n\nA: No, I'm afraid it does not reduce the power consumption of your device.\nLCD screens (which the iPhones use) use - almost - the same amount of power no matter what colour is being displayed, and the majority of this power is used by the backlight, so if you lower the brightness of the display you can actually save power.\nAs far as I know, the Galaxy Note uses an AMOLED screen, which actually uses less power when displaying black pixels, so that's why it is a useful feature on that device.\n", "Q: How to update OS X using dmg I have multiple Macs and I want to update all those macs using a dmg file.

At the moment I am messing around with OS X profile manager and configuration profiles in general.\nI like the idea of being able to push settings to clients and I'd like to use it for my customers. The problem is, that we can't use profile manager, because it doesn't fit in our business model. \n(Short excourse: We manage around 50 customers in my hometown, mostly with 5-50 workers each. Those customers are all individual and do not have any relations to each other. Therefore we can't use one server for all, and setting up one server per customer is also not a thing we'd like to do (or the customer would like to pay;))\nI found out so far, that you can import a \"trust-profile\" and after that one is installed, the user can install all profiles coming from this trusted server without having to supply administration-credentials (this is key, because we don't give them the administrator login in general).\nHowever, on OS X you can use \"codesign\" (on the terminal) to sign profiles with your private key and then it's signed and computers with the trust-profile installed trust this signed profile.\nI'd like to know, what exactly codesign does (does it simply encrypt the profile with your private key?) so I could find another way of signing those profiles on a non-osx machine.\nThe long term objective would be to have one (web)server sitting \"somewhere in the internet\" and serving all our customers with profiles. For this I'd write a library and webApp (if this doesn't exist yet) to configure and deploy profiles.\nI could also imagine publishing it to github.\nRegards\nChristian\n\nA: I suspect writing an equivalent to codesign on a non-Apple platform will be tricky; but you might be lucky as parts may be open source.\nConsider having a Mac provide a code signing service solely for your web server. Then you can use Apple's codesign but avoid using the Mac as the public server. \nApple provide two useful documents about code signing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Code Signing Guide\n\n*OS X Code Signing In Depth\nThe technical note is a great source of information for how codesign works and has changed across different editions of OS X:\n\nThe purpose of this technote is to provide a more in depth view of code signing. It is intended to expand upon the information given in the Code Signing Guide by supplying a more detailed analysis of the technology. The target audience for this document is OS X developers who have read and presumably understand the information given in the Code Signing Guide but want to learn a bit more.\n\n", "Q: How do I prevent my PPP connection from disconnecting when it's idle? I've installed a Huawei-based \"surf stick\" (a USB stick with a mobile/wireless modem inside) as a backup internet connection in case my main connection goes down.\nI've configured it as a PPP connection in the Network control panel.\nAll works fine apart from the fact that after a few minutes of idle time on this secondary network interface, the PPP connection gets closed by the system with the message that the connection was idle.\nI like to disable this automatic \"disconnection when idle\".\nApple's support site has this to say about accomplishing it:\n\nClick PPP, and then make sure the “Disconnect if idle for __ minutes” checkbox is not selected, or if it is selected, increase the number of minutes that the computer can remain idle before disconnecting.\n\nWell, this is how it looks on my system:\n\nAs you can see, there is no such \"Disconnect if idle\" checkbox option.\nWhere is it gone, how do I get it back? Or is there another way to control this setting, maybe with a defaults command?\nThis is on 10.10.5, BTW.\nAlso, I wonder why the \"Connect automatically when needed\" option is disabled. I've asked about this in the Apple discussions forum but didn't get an answer on that, either.\n\nA: I found a solution. The file preferences.plist inside /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration contains the configurations for the various network interfaces.\nLooking at the file with a plist editor I found the following data under Root / NetworkServices / ... / PPP:\n\nAfter I've modified the Disconnect... related values from 1 to 0 with BBEdit, the automatic disconnect has been successfully disabled.\nHowever, after another ~40 minutes, the connection was dropped with a different message saying that the connection was dropped because no (phone) number was given. That made no sense to me, because when I manually reconnected afterwards, it worked again. So, there's still something wrong with my setup but the idle disconnection is not it any more.\n", "Q: iPad game transfer I have an iPad and my son plays his games on it.\nWe are getting him his own iPad.\nHow can I transfer his games over to his iPad with out giving him the same Apple ID as mine?\n\nA: You can create an Apple ID for him when setting up his iPad.\nFor him to be able to use the same apps that you have paid for, and to -mostly- avoid buying things twice, you can set his Apple ID as part of your family on Family Sharing.  \nThe progress of each game will be more difficult or impossible to transfer, depending on how and where it is saved. \nThe information on the feasibility of that transfer it's probably on each developer support site.\nYou can also try your luck asking for each separately here, but for some reason most games questions are shunned.\n", "Q: Could microsoft remote desktop connection be used to spy? I found a Program called Microsoft remote desktop connection on my mac but did not install it myself. Could somebody have been using it to spy on my computer use without my knowledge?\nWould I be able to tell if my computer was being remotely accessed through that program while i was using my computer?\n\nA: I'm pretty sure it can get installed as part of Office, as well as separately.\nOne app not to worry about, in fact - as it can only be used to 'dial out' to a Windows machine, not another Mac.\n\nA: No - that program lets your computer reach out and \"spy\" on other computers.\nUnless your system has malware (which gladly we are starting to learn about thanks to some brave whistleblowers) - you can control your Mac's security in the Sharing Preference pane.\nWhen you want your Mac to be remotely observable, choose screen sharing or remote management and turn them on. You can ask the system to tell you the status of remote management, but it's really up to the viewer to do the right thing as they can disable that notification in most instances if desired.\n", "Q: OS X native share menu in Firefox I’d want to know if it is possible (by extensions, hack, context menu...) to have the mac native share menu in firefox?\n\nThanks\nMore about share menu extension:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac\nhttps://developer.apple.com/app-extensions/\n\nA: Have you tried the sharethis add-on?\n\nA: So far as I'm aware, there are two ways to bring up macOS' native share sheet:\n\n*\n\n*While the relevant tab is active, in the Menu Bar navigate to File > Share.\n\n*Right-click on the tab and mouse over the Share item in the context menu.\n\nUnfortunately, as of version 106.0.1, the share sheet is not present in the context menu that appears when right-clicking on the page content.\n", "Q: How do I restore missing menu extras (clock, wi-fi, etc)? When I log in to Mac OS X (10.10.5) I sometimes find that most of my menu extras are missing (clock, wi-fi, sound, bluetooth, etc.). If I logout and login, they almost always come back, but this takes too much time.\nI suspect the problem is caused by menumeters but I find this menulet too useful to uninstall it.\nHow can I reset my menu extras (aka menulets) without logging out?\n\nA: I was able to get my menu extras back without logging out by running killall SystemUIServer in the Terminal.app.\nI found the answer from zane's Recover missing menubar icons - revisited System post. The post is from 2006, but the trick still works on Yosemite.\n", "Q: SSH-Keygen Fingerprint and SSH giving fingerprints with lots of letters and numbers At the advice of another SE member (I'm cross posting here).\nI've been using SSH and public key crypto for a few months. I've run into a new problem with my install of the newest public beta of OS X, and can't find an answer online.\nWhen I run SSH-Keygen -lf in the OS X terminal, the fingerprint I get is:\nSHA256:FAESFJ*(WY*(T$NGN(*G(NURGOUfj34n98tj8v3f485 \n[That's not the actual string, but you get the picture]\n\nI'm used to something like\n2048 0a:11:2b:33:44:55:66:77:88\n\nSimilarly, after deleting my old known_hosts file, when attempting to SSH into some of my machines, I was greeted with the standard warning that the host was unknown and to check the fingerprint. However, again, the fingerprint is being displayed as:\nSHA256:[Mix of letters and numbers]\n\nWhen I run ssh-keygen -lf on my ubuntu installation, I get the standard\n2048 0a:1b:2c:[ETC ETC]\n\nAm I doing something wrong? Is there another option or parameter I need to flick?\nIn the meantime, to make sure I'm safe, I did\nssh-keyscan [IP address] > /path/to/file\nssh-keygen -lf /path/to/same/file\n\nThe result was the same as what I was prompted with when I SSH'd in. So I'm safe, and not too worried about security. But I'd like to learn what's going on and if I'm doing something wrong.\nThanks in advance!\nEdit: I should add that SSH-Keygen -lf used to work as expected before this upgrade. This suggests that I just need to flip a switch to change the output from gobbledygook to the more \"traditional\" fingerprint output.\n\nA: Turns out that SSH recently switched from using MD5 fingerprints (what I refer to as a \"traditional\" fingerprint) and now uses SHA256 fingerprints (what I referred to as gobbledygook).\nI'm guessing that with El Capitan OS X is now using a newer version of SSH that is using the new SHA256 default.\nFor those of you who find this, although SSH will give you an SHA256 fingerprint by default, you can ask SSH to give you an MD5 Fingerprint.\nssh -o FingerprintHash=md5 [server]\n\nIt appears that on my Mac, that the command\nssh-keygen -lf /path/to/key\n\nnow defaults to an SHA 256 fingerprint. However, if you're using Ubuntu, it looks like ssh-keygen is still defaulting to MD5 (maybe I need to update my ssh package on Ubuntu).\nHere is the post that I finally found once I started using the right terminology:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/929566/sha256-ssh-fingerprint-given-by-the-client-but-only-md5-fingerprint-known-for-se\n\nA: In El Capitan you should use: ssh-keygen -E md5 -lf ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n", "Q: Starting and stopping mysql server. Shorten and make automatic Currently I start and stop mysql with the following command\nsudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start\n\nsudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop\n\nIt is quite a long command to remember.  How can I set it up so that I can start and stop it with a single command.  Something like.\nsudo mysql-server start\n\nI am thinking I would need to crete a symbolic link somewhere for this to work?  Also one last option; how can I make it so that it runs on bootup by default?\n\nA: Just create an alias in your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile file.\nCheck with ls -la0 ~/ if one of the files already exist, else create one with:\ntouch ~/.bash_profile\n\nAfter opening .bash_profile with nano ~/.bash_profile add the lines:\nalias iwanttostartmysqlwithareallyshortcommand='sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start'\nalias iwanttostopmysqlwithareallyshortcommand='sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop'\n\nwrite the file to disk with ctrlO and exit nano with ctrlX.\nThen enter:\nsource .bash_profile\n\nIn the future you just have to enter \niwanttostartmysqlwithareallyshortcommand\n\nor\niwanttostopmysqlwithareallyshortcommand\n\nto start or stop mysql after entering your password.\nA shorter alias like iwanttostartmysqlnow works also. Even really, really short ones are possible like stm (= start mysql) or spm (= stop mysql). They mustn't collide with other aliases or valid commands though. The shortest I have found - and easy to remember - are 1 to start and 0 to stop mysql. ;-)\n\nTo answer your second question:\nIf you have installed the latest MySQL from Oracle a launch daemon should have been installed in /Library/LaunchDaemons already.\nIf you have installed another mysql package (e.g. homebrew) you may use the example here and adapt it.\nSlightly modified example:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.mysql.mysqld</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n    <string>/usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start</string>\n    </array>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\n\nSave the XML as a file named /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist\nAdjust the file permissions using the Apple recommended owner \"root\", owning group \"wheel\", and file permissions \"644\"\nsudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist\nsudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist\n\nEnable this new MySQL service with:\nsudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mysql.mysql.plist\n\n\nA: I like the alias answer.

That being the case, I found Apple Numbers to do well with using a PDF form as a background image.  This requires no outside software to modify the original PDF.\nEmbedding the PDF\nTo begin with, select the PDF you wish to use.  If it is a multi-page document, I find it works best to separate the pages by copying them to individual sheets.  (They can still all be printed or exported together as a single document from Numbers.)\nThis example uses a generic Employment Application.\nCreate a new Numbers document\n\n*\n\n*Use the default blank template and delete the table if desired.  Later, we will add tables that can offer far more flexibility of position over the PDF than can be done with a conventional spreadsheet table.\n\n*Paste your PDF onto the sheet.\n\n*Set the size to the Original Size using the button\n\n*set the position to 0x and 0y\n\n*Lock the image so it does not get moved again inadvertently (It can be unlocked at any time for adjustment, then re-locked)\n\n\n\nChange the Print Setup\n\n*\n\n*Enter the Print Setup by selecting File > Print ⌘+P\n\n*Set the Page Margins to 0\"\n\n*Set the Header and Footer to -.5\" or -1cm\n\n\n2021 Note update: Numbers currently does not accept negative values for Header and Footer.\n\n\n\n\nOverlay Tables\n\n*\n\n*Add tables over your fields.  These tables can be independent and inter-connected, meaning that tricks like merging cells is unnecessary.  They can be inter-referenced for calculations just as can be done in Excel.\n\n\n\n\nFormatting Tables\nTables can be formatted to taste.\n\n*\n\n*Remove borders\n\n*Change font colors\n\n*Use formulas\n\nWith a little creativity, I think you would be easily able to use Numbers to create your documents.  I would recommend the creation of a template for future use if you need the same document over and over again.\nTip: Saving the finished document as a PDF. Use the Print Dialog to export as a PDF rather than the PDF export feature in Numbers.\n\n\nResulting PDF\n\n\nA: ImageMagick\nConsider using ImageMagick's composite tool to combine the Excel PDF and your background image:\n\nUse the composite program to overlap one image over another. See Command Line Processing for advice on how to structure your composite command or see below for example usages of the command.\nExample Usage\nWe list a few examples of the composite command here to illustrate its usefulness and ease of use. To get started, lets overlay a smiley face over a rose:\ncomposite -gravity center smile.gif  rose: rose-over.png\n\n\nYou will probably need to write a short script to deal with each page, but the result should be more resilient and should work across multiple versions of OS X.\nYou can use Automator to split out each page of the Excel PDF and, after compositing with the background, another Automator Action can recombine the pages.\nVector Art Applications\nThere are numerous vector applications available on the Mac that can achieve the result you are looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inkscape\n\n*Sketch\n\n*Pixelmator\n\n*iDraw\n\n*Artboard\n\n*Intaglio\n\n\npdftk\nWorking editions of pdftk for OS X 10.9 and 10.10 appear to be available, see How to install pdftk on Mac OS X for build details and various forks.\npdftk on OS X 10.9+\nFor 10.9 and 10.10, try using the quantiverge edition of pdftk on homebrew.

I've even tried it as a root user. I've reset my PATH and executed the bash shell's again but it still couldn't recognise my errors. I've also reinstalled Xcode to make sure my command line tools were present. How to i fix this?\n\nA: I would comment, but I don't have enough coinage.  We need to figure out what is wrong:\nThe packages do not exist in a known path that you have.  We know this.  So what is causing it?  Either it's not being installed, or it is being installed and the binary is not in PATH.\nFirst, make sure it is being installed properly by pip.  Do a pip install and let us know the output.  Also let us know the output of pip list after the install.  I just went to console, switched to a virtual environment, then did a pip install on restview.  It installed successfully in virtual_env_path/bin/ and also my pip is located in virtual_env_path/bin/\nSo, if it is installing correctly I would find out where pip is located by typing which pip\nThen see if the packages you are looking for are in that path, or near there.  Clearly, that directory is in your path since pip runs.  If you find the packages, make sure that directory is added to the path if they are not.  Remember PATH resets each time you open a new console.  Check path via echo $PATH\nBasically, if it is installed, you must find out where, then compare that to your path.  Good luck.\n", "Q: Any backup software for OS X other then Time Machine? Time Machine will not backup external disks connected to it.\nI need to backup connected external disks.\nI have a pile of backup disks in their default formats. Buffalo, WD mostly as backup disks. My external drives include USB drives etc.\nAre there any substitutes for Time Machine?\n\nA: rsnapshot\nIf you really don't want or cannot use Time Machine, you should look into rsnapshot. However, this solution will be much more complicated than using Time Machine. This guide explains the procedure of setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use homebrew for setup: brew install rsnapshot\n\n*Next you will have to configure its settings in rsnapshot.conf\n\n*Now you can run it somewhat like this: rsnapshot -c rsnapshot.conf hourly\nThere is many more guides on how to setup rsnapshot in the internet.\nTime Machine\nTime machine can actually backup external drives. However, external drives are excluded by default. Go to System Preferences > Time Machine > Options... and remove your disk from the exclusion list (while the drive is connected). Also the external disk will have to be formatted in HFS+.\n", "Q: Deleting mails from Apple Mail Yosemite 10.10.5 In my previous iMac which was 8 years old, I had it set up to be able to automatically connect to my usual @outlook.com account whenever I clicked on the mail icon to forward a webpage to someone.\nThe way it was set-up, it would only be able to do this function and would not receive all my incoming @outlook.com emails. I have followed your instructions and the new Mac is now the same.\nBut now I want to know if I could delete all the mail that was downloaded into Mail before I disabled the incoming feature.\nI hope you are able to follow all that I've typed here. If you understand what I'm trying to do, please instruct me what steps to take to delete all those downloaded email from Mail.  Also, advise me if this is not a good action to take. I just feel that it is sufficient to have my emails in the @outlook.com inbox rather than have a copy of the incoming mails in Mail, too.\n\nA: Some of it depends on what type of account @outlook.com accounts are but I am quite sure that it would be IMAP. As such, if you delete your messages, it will delete them from your live email account to, which obviously could come with unintended consequences. To avoid that, I would recommend first confirming that messages are only set to download when you click Refresh. As I don't have Outlook I cannot confirm or guide you on how to do that. \nAfter that is set, I would delete the account from Outlook and then re-configure it. Doing so will remove messages from your computer without deleting them from the cloud. You should then be able to send emails as desired. \nThe other thing to consider is that unless you are running low on disk space, there is no need to worry about having some unneeded messages sitting in your Outlook application. If it were me, I would turn sync to manual and leave them there, likely. \nEdit:\nIt took me awhile to grasp your question, and it looks like I partly failed. It looks like you don't want your messages sitting around in Apple Mail.app. As such, the above would apply. However, OS X does allow you to set default Mail programs and you can likely set Outlook to that function. With that, you could use Outlook as your primary, and only, email client and delete the account from Apple Mail. \n", "Q: iCloud music library won't load on new phone I got a new phone today, have  enabled Apple Music and iCloud library, but every time it goes to \"load library\" it just stops and goes to a screen that says I have no music.

I don't want it to use all this space, but didn't see any configuration settings for this.  What is the purpose of this folder?  If I just delete it, will Google Photos Backup continue to work?\n\nA: If you click the \"Google Photos Backup\" icon in your menu bar (looks like a gray pinwheel), you should see the \"Preferences\" option.

I love it, but the hard drive is too small to fit my entire photo library. At this point the hard-drive is full and I need to find a way to move the files to a back-up location. I know I could just buy an external hard drive and move the files manually, but I would rather find a way where I could automate the process of backing up and moving older photos (or better yet, photos not recently viewed) to an external hard-drive and a remote backup location. I know of a few services that will automatically back up the photos (if I remember to leave the app running) but they don't remove the files, and I have no way of knowing which files have successfully been backed up and/or could be restored if I wanted to. So I don't feel like I have enough confidence in my backups to feel like I can delete the files to clear up space.\nSo I'm wondering if you know of a way to automate this process.\n\nA: iCloud Photo Library would achieve a very similar end result.\nIn Photos, click Photos > Preferences, choose the iCloud tab and enable iCloud Photo Library.\nIf you turn on Optimise Storage, iCloud Photo Library will automatically manage the size of your library on your Mac. All of your original photos and videos are stored in iCloud while thumbnails are kept on your Mac. You can download the original photos and videos when you need them. \nNote that your photos would no longer be stored in any backup you make, but iCloud Photo Library does keep deleted photos and videos for about a month.\n", "Q: A white input bar appear when typing on keyboard while play game I have a problem everytime I play a game on my Mac, and try to use keyboard's alphabet characters, a white input bar appear on the bottom of the screen (and the character go there instead of to the game).

As soon as I switch the keyboard input back to \"U.S\" the input bar disappears. And it seems like it's associated with Finder. \n\nA: Definitely a third party app that is listening for keyboard hits, possibly a key combination. \nTry doing the Command+Option+Esc combo and see what apps are running. Better yet, type in the box so that is the active app and see if one of them is automatically highlighted. In my screenshot, you can see that I was using google chrome at the time I hit the key combo. \n\nForce Quit the offending app and delete or check out their forums for more information.\n", "Q: Can you choose contacts to be on your iMessage account? I am concerned about it. If I get started on iMessage, will it come up with all the contacts I have now or can I select them?\n\nA: iMessage doesn't have the concept of a contact list like you might have had on Windows Live Messenger, AIM or Skype.\nIt operates like traditional SMS. If someone has your number or email address, they can send you a message.\n", "Q: MapMyRide contains erroneous points on occasion Usually my iPhone 4s and MapMyRide work well together, but occasionally I get weird records where the location recorded 'jumps' from where I really was to another location maybe 5-10 kilometers away - the track between true and false locations being recorded as a straight line. Is this a MapMyRide problem, an iPhone software or hardware problem, and how to fix?\n\nA: I have observed a similar problem with RunKeeper in the past (not on my iPhone 6 as of yet) and I believe it has to do with the phone struggling to accurately locate itself at that moment. iPhone's \"zero-in\" on their current location, starting with a big radius and shrinking it as it gets more accurate information. With that, it always assumes that it is in the center of the circle. When the phone chokes on its location MapMyRide will record that location even if it is erroneous, I believe. \nWhat I did with RunKeeper when that happened was simply edit the activity later on a computer. I removed the problematic point and the statistics and route returned to normal. I don't believe I almost ever had that happen more than one or two times in an activity and it occurred rarely at that. \nI have not used MapMyRide so I don't know if there is a way to edit your activity. But, in short, I would suspect the phone as the the app isn't the actual source of the location information - it just asks the computer for it. \n", "Q: iOS Simulator installations fail on Xcode 6.4 on El Capitan v10.11 \n\nCould not download and install iOS 7.1 Simulator.

I am running OS X Yosemite, and Parallels 10.\nI have a guest VM running OS X Yosemite. I would like to migrate the guest VM to a physical machine. Is this possible? The reason is that the guest vm is just too slow, and I would be better off running on a physical machine. I have a number of developer tools installed and configured perfectly on the VM that would take a long time to download them on the physical machine. Thats why I just want to \"migrate\" to a physical machine.\nI tried connecting an external hard drive to the VM, and creating a time machine backup, but it fails to even make the initial backup. The error message is:\n\"An error occurred while copying files. The problem may be temporary. If the problem persists use disk utility to repair your backup disk\"\n\nA: Use SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to create a bootable image\nto an external or internal disk. SuperDuper can also be used for free. \n\nA: In addition to using SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to create a bootable image\nto an external or internal disk, you could also Disk Utility in OS X to either create an image or clone the mounted virtual hard drive to a disk.  If creating an image with Disk Utility you'd need to use the Scan Image for Restore... command from the Image menu in Disk Utility before restoring the image.\nObviously regardless of what App or method you choose it will be a multi-step process if the source resides on the target disk.\nIf you have any worries about the virtual disk install running on physical Apple-branded hardware then cloning the virtual card drive to an external USB drive will allow you to boot the Apple-branded hardware from the clone to see that all will be well before overwriting the internal drive with the contents of the virtual hard disk.\nIt should work okay as I've done it in the past with VMware Fusion OS X virtual hard disks and Disk Utility images between different Macs of different hardware builds without issues.\n", "Q: Application Support directory, some apps are using tons of space! After running out of space multiple times, I started researching and putting a strategy to permanently fix this issue.\nIn the end I found that Application Support is an important directory for most of apps, but I've a directory called Google with 2.2 GB size. Most probably this is for Chrome only. What does this directory include and what will happen if I delete it?\nIncluding information about directories and their sizes:\n\n\nA: It appears to be local storage, used by websites to store temporary files. This article explains how you can use Chrome itself to inspect the contents in more detail.\nSeems like it should be safe enough to delete (the article also describes a Chrome extension that can safely do that), but as always, make sure you have a backup just in case.\n", "Q: How to install Windows on a MacBook without Bootcamp parallely? Recently my Mac got erased while trying to format the partiton. So i was trying to install windows 8.1 on my MacBook Pro. I can't use Bootcamp as there is no OS X in my Mac. The Internet Recovery is taking very long to recover so I would like to shorten the process and install Windows 8 parallely. How can I do this?\n\nA: Actually you will need to download Bootcamp from Apple as all the drivers are there. I've never tried to download it on a PC but it should be possible to open the BootCamp.app package on a PC (it's just a folder) and get to the drivers that way.\nBut if you have Windows 8.1 bootable install media you should be able to boot your Mac from it, format and select a partition and install Windows. Generally Windows will work on a Mac without the Boot Camp drivers. Depending on your model some parts will not work, so I would download the bootcamp installer and put it on the same media as the Windows installer so you don't have to download it on a Mac running Windows without a working NIC.\nIt would be helpful, to know the model of Mac you have and what your experiences are doing this. What works and does not, what you had to work around to get it up and running.\n\nA: The First Answer given by Steve Chambers is actually right.But in my case the answer would be try to get some backup from other mac and backup the os from Time Machine so that you can install OSX with the backup faster and you just have to format the drive.And after that partition the harddisk and use a Win 8.1 DVD to boot (press and hold the alt button when booting up the macbook).And this will install Win 8.1 in Mac without BootCamp. \n", "Q: Text Editor Graphical Glitch on Xcode 6.4 I'm experiencing a very odd graphical glitch with the code editor, initially I thought it was my machine's graphics going to pot but after further investigation it is definitely tied to Xcode and/or my project file.\nThis glitch appears to follow my project around, I have tried deleting derived data and userdata from the project folder, I've also made sure all of my fonts are the same (this was suggested in another thread for a similar sounding issue). Very often while editing code the below graphical error occurs, it is very frustrating. Has anyone else encountered this?\nI've moved the project across multiple Macs and the problem persists, I would be really grateful for any insight on how to prevent this as I'm nearing the end of a very long project and this has pretty much put a halt to progress.\n\n\nA: Go to Preferences->General tab and uncheck \"Show live issues\" under Issues. Notice that this is a work around to be able to continue working with Xcode, at least until they issue an official fix. This glitch seems to be noticeable when you have lots of lines of code (1000+).\nAfter this, the glitch will still be happening but not while coding but during building phase. Not perfect but at least you will be able to continue working.\n", "Q: How to fix delayed typing on certain websites? When I am in Safari, typing an email or another form that has typing the resulting speed of text entry is mind numbingly slow! \nI don't know what terms to search to identify the problem.\nWhy would it only be in an email?\n\nA: Without a list of sites that work and a list of sites that don't - here are some tips.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Activity Monitor and look at CPU and choose View menu -> All Processes (and then sort by CPU use descending). Watch this for apps that are slowing things down.\n\n*Open text edit and type there. - make note of what process are using CPU when you type and how fast it responds.\n\n*Open your webmail (or a slow forum) and repeat.\n\n*If there are programs taking CPU when you see the slowness, quit them.\n\n*If you have quit everything but Safari, restart the Mac and repeat the fast/slow.\n\n\nOver time you will begin to see if the slowness is CPU - which is things you can control on the computer or if it's not the CPU that's waiting. In that case, it's the web site or network.\nThe pragmatic solution is to type in a local word processor and then copy/paste into the slow web application if you find the web application interface slowing you down.\n", "Q: iTunes Gift Cards I live in Japan, with Apple ID details based in Japan. My iTunes account is based in the UK for financial reasons. \nI was given an iTunes Gift Card in Japan, and want to upgrade my UK storage (in Pounds).\nCan I use this card that is in Yen to buy extra storage in the UK?\n\nA: From near the bottom of Redeem and use iTunes Gift Cards and content codes.\n\nYou can't redeem purchased gifts outside of the country of purchase.\n  For example, an iTunes Gift purchased in France can't be redeemed in\n  an iTunes Store outside of France.\n\nSo based on that statement I'd say the answer to your question is no.\nHowever I'd contact Apple directly by calling one of the Apple stores nearest you.\n", "Q: Install Adobe After Effects 7.0 on OS X Yosemite I tried to install Adobe After Effects 7.0 on my Mac with OS X Yosemite but got an error Installation failed - an error occurred.

You are just going to have to get used to the newer version of After Effects.\n\nA: As per this link, the version you are trying to install is extremely old and not supported on any Mac with a recent version of OS X, because it is PowerPC only. Support for PowerPC applications that are not Universal was dropped in OS X 10.7 Lion. \nThere is no solution other than acquiring a new version of After Effects. \n", "Q: How can I use two iPads and one Apple ID and still have different content on each iPad I have two iPads and I've backed up and transferred everything onto the second iPad. So now they are identical in loaded apps and data. But I want to use them for different purposes, pleasure and business. \nHow can I delete things on only one iPad without them being deleted from the other as well.\n\nA: You can delete apps on any device without affecting the other.\n\nA: Go to Settings → General → Reset → Erase Content and Settings. This will reset the iPad, removing all content and resetting all settings, without affecting any other iPad.\n\nA: iTunes manages each device separately.  First, give the iPads different names so you can tell them apart, even though iTunes already knows.  Do this on the devices themselves.  Then, plug both in to the computer separately and you should have the devices available separately, although now iTunes shows them in this stupid device selector that barely looks like a selector at all.  It's a button that has an icon for the device and, again, with the latest screw-up of the iTunes UI you may not notice it.  Click on it and you should see two iPads in a drop-down menu.  Select the old one and select music, photos, etc to remove those ones you don't want.  \nI really think your problem here might be mainly due to the iTunes UI. \n\nA: You can disable iCloud on one of the iPads, meaning it won't download content from the other. \nOr effect the content of the other\n", "Q: Have OSX Launch Applicaiton on restart? This may seem like a odd question since most people would want to know how to start a program on boot. I was wondering if there is a way to have OSX launch an application when the restart button is pressed from the apple menu.\n\nA: It's doable with a reboot proxy, i.e. you'd rename /sbin/reboot, e.g. sudo mv /sbin/reboot /sbin/reboot.ori, and then create a reboot symlink to the /sbin/reboot_proxy bash script that has the command(s) you what to execute before the reboot and then lastly it executes /sbin/reboot.ori.  I actually have this setup on my Mac running OS X 10.8.5 and it works well.  I'm trapping both reboot and shutdown commands. Which are what's run when clicking the Apple menu > Reboot... and or Shut Down... commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: It's best to have a second bash script to toggle the state of the original file and the proxy bash script as it has to be set back before OS X updates are done that will touch the file(s).\n\n\nThis is the code in my shutdown_proxy bash script that has a symbolic link for both the reboot and shutdown commands after the original were renamed with a .ori extension.  Feel free to adapt it for your use.\nContents of reboot_proxy \n#!/bin/bash\n\n_name=\"$0\";\necho \"Reboot Proxy Executing...\"\n\n# Place command(s) to execute before reboot directly below this comment:\n\n\n_command=\"$_name.ori\"\necho \"Executing $_command $@...\"\n\n\"$_command\" \"$@\"\n\nLet me add that from a security standpoint there are those that would argue this is a bad thing to do and I'd say to some extent that's true under the right conditions however since I'm the only one that has ever and will ever touch my Mac and I have several layers of security running beyond the built-ins, I personally have no issue using such a method.\n\nA: Since choosing Apple Menu > Reboot effectively logs you out, you could probably do something like is suggested here:\nRun Script on Logout Without Use of Logout Hook. \nI would avoid attempting to edit or modify any system binaries, scripts, etc and stick to what is available in \"userspace.\" Mostly because any system update could overwrite any changes you made, and if you did anything that if \"broken\" could prevent booting or logging in... Well, that can be a major headache.\nNote: I have not had a chance to put any of that to the test just yet, but it looks like a few leads may be in there.\n", "Q: Fan / Processor picks up and runs hard when I let MacBook idle and sleep. Botnet? This problem just started happening since I got to my new apartment. I've had this computer (2014 maxed out MacBook Pro) for about a year, and it never happened before moving here. \nBasically, when I am using the computer to browse the Internet or work on docs etc it is quiet and responds normally. When I stop using it for a while, but leave it on (or in sleep mode) it enters very intense activity. Or at the very least the fan starts running like crazy. \nThe activity/fan only stops if I power down the machine completely, or if I start using the machine again, in which case it gradually slows down (the fan noise) and then stops completely after about 20 secs of me being on the computer again. It is counterintuitive that the computer fan / activity picks up when I am NOT using the machine, rather than vice versa.\nI have been able to find very little that is helpful based on Google searches, although I did find at least one post suggesting that this could be due to botnet infection, which was my initial thought and concern (prior to seeing that post). \nProbably not much that can be done diagnostically via a message board analysis, but I thought I would post since there doesn't seem to be a lot of easily available info on this phenomenon. I suppose a less nefarious explanation would be that there are major updates that need to run in the background, but that explanation doesn't seem consistent with my experience using Macs previously. \n\nA: Could be running Spotlight.

I have an old iMac that I got probably sometime in 2000. It's the kind that has a big old CRT monitor built into it, so I dare not take it apart myself. I haven't used it in a very long time, but it has been taking up valuable space for a while. I don't think there is anything sensitive on the hard drive, but I want to wipe it to be sure.

Probing with a paperclip gives the impression there is something blocking the slot on the inside.\n\n*When I power it on now the screen flickers continuously in a way that makes me nervous. \nHas anyone had a similar experience, or know of another way to get at the HD?\nOr is this a Kobayashi Maru scenario?\n\nA: I would suggest, that assuming you can physically--and safely(!), taking note of the comment about voltages and CRTs--removing the hard drive and taking it apart. Most times you can get the actual platters/discs out without too much trouble and carefully smash them. Most are, I think, a metal coating on glass of some sort, so watch splinters wear eye protection, etc. This can be easier than smashing the metal case of the hard drive which might not actually destroy the platter(s).\n", "Q: How to migrate your iCloud account I have recently moved from France to the USA.\nIn the long run, that means I will shut down my French bank account who is becoming useless. But I cannot go on iTunes and change the \"bank account\" settings or change my address there.\nFrom this article, I believe I will have to buy again all the apps, movies and music I have previously purchased, as well as \"forget about\" French apps not present in the U.S. store, even the ones for which I wish to keep an account active (not sure how to do that). I believe one cannot \"switch\" between a US and a French iTunes account at will. I will probably also lose all my Game Center scores, etc. \n1 - How can I measure how much data / apps / settings will be lost?\nAlso, iCloud documents.\nI have several hundred iCloud documents stored in Textedit, Notes, Pages, etcetera, that I absolutely need to work on, on a day-to-day basis.\n2 - If there is a simple, step-by-step procedure that would allow me to migrate to a US-based iTunes account with as little loss as possible?\n3 - What happens if I move back to France in 5 years? Same losses?\nModels of devices: iPhone 4, iOS8, and iMac mid-2011 with Yosemite.\nI understand that 1, 2 and 3 are different questions, and if anyone has a problem with this, I will gladly split the question in three different question pages, just let me know.\n\nA: For #1, one thing to remember is your iCloud account is different from your iTunes/App Store account. You should not lose any of your iCloud documents because that is stored in the iCloud account.\nApple's support page describes the procedure here and you should be able to change it back if you like at a later point. But basically, when you change stores, you don't lose your previous purchases but you cannot update them any longer (because you are no longer hooked up to the store you bought it from in the first place). For these reasons, I have two iTunes/App Store accounts so I can switch back and forth to update my software.\n", "Q: New MacBook had user accounts already; I deleted admin and can't get back in So when I get this new machine...there is already a user on it called \"mac\"...for my convenience they said. There is also another user already there named \"admin\"\nwell..i'm new to apple but when it's my pc, I am the admin. so i erased the \"admin\" they made (and for which they gave me no password for this account\". \nso i deleted it. now no one can log in, i can't use apple id, I've changed the passwords several time successfully only to attempt to make an edit or log in and get the message that an admin has to give his username and password....but i made myself the admin!!!!! why can't i log in with my username and the correct password i regenerated?\nit's been hours of trying to make new admins, resetting passwords, everything... mount -uw, rv/ etc. it is totally messed up.\nand this company did this account making for my benefit...? i can't get system assistant to do anything or even activate again. I've reinstalled OS 10.10...nothing. does anyone? know if i have to start at square one, reinstall yosemite or is there a way to fix this? much appreciated. \n\nA: Two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Depending on where you were sold the Mac - you may have a legitimate claim for money back or a total refund. Bad sellers are no help generally, but perhaps they aren't bad and you could ask them for help - if they are reputable, they may bend over backwards to make you happy.\n\n*Apple supports their hardware no matter how you got it. I'd start with AppleCare and above all else - make a full back up of the Mac before you erase it.\n\n\nYou can use that backup to see what apps were bundled (like Pages/Numbers/Keynote) and also iPhoto/iMovie/GarageBand that you might have to pay for if you don't have backups of them.\nI personally wouldn't trust an OS I didn't install, so long term, you will want to erase it and start with just the things you can trust from the backup.\nTo get immediate admin control of the Mac - write down all the folders in /Users and then power off the Mac. Hold command S and follow the article below up to the two commands: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT2600\nfsck -fy /  \nmount -uw /  \n\nThen do these two commands:\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nhalt\n\nPower up your Mac and then make a new account with a name different than the ones you wrote down previously. This account can be used to reset the passwords of the \"admin\" account or delete it. Deleting all other accounts won't delete the apps - just the settings. You can then set up a new admin account if you want.\n\nA: I would suggest you to reinstall OS X and doing it not on the top of the existing version.\nStart Mac in Recovery mode (hold Cmd-R keys pressed on boot). When in Recovery mode - select Disk Utility, format your disk, exit Disk Utility and select Install or reinstall OS X.\nP.S. If you have your files stored in Mac - backup ones before formatting the disk.\n\nA: To do it, first type ⌘+R at startup. Then move your mouse cursor to the top and look for Terminal. Open Terminal and type this: resetpassword\nThen on the account you need, you can perform the function.\n", "Q: OS X 10.10.5 - root user suddenly activated As far as I know, the root-user is deactivated by default in OS X. And I remember trying the command \"su\" some time (a few weeks) ago and it stated something like \"su: sorry\" which it should state. I googled how to activate the root user and followed the steps, just to know it if it would be necessary, but DID NOT activate or change anything in the settings at that point.\nJust for fun, I tried a few minutes ago and it DID let me login as root, i. e.:\n\n➜  ~  su                                                               23:46:28\nPassword:\nsh-3.2# ls -l\n\nDoes anyone have an idea why that change occured?\nP.S.: The attempt a few weeks ago was under OS X 10.10.4, the attempt a few minutes ago was under OS X 10.10.5 - does anyone know if they changed that setting within this update?\nEDIT: A few months ago, I just recall, there appeared a new user displayed as \"Others...\" at the login screen when booting up. It is still here, but I didn't do anything about this user. In the system preferences it just states the 3 users (my user, backup with admin rights (called \"test\") and guest) I created, but in the terminal it states:\n\n➜  /Users  ls -lah                                                     00:13:41\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x   7 root   admin    238B 17 Okt  2014 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  35 root   wheel    1,2K 11 Jul 15:19 ..\n-rw-r--r--   1 root   wheel      0B 10 Sep  2014 .localized\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 11 Guest  _guest   374B 25 Sep  2013 Guest\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 64 MyName staff    2,1K 30 Aug 00:13 MyName\ndrwxrwxrwt   9 root   wheel    306B 16 Aug 22:30 Shared\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 12 test   staff    408B  6 Aug 14:54 test\n\nWhat is this \"shared\" user?

I think i will deactivate it again. But why did it even change?\nEDIT: Just deactivated root. Responds \"su: sorry\" as desired when trying to login as root in the terminal and furthermore the \"Others...\" user at the login screen disappeared. Still clueless why and how root got activated.\n\nA: The \"Shared\" folder is - depending on your system - automatically created or created by the system after establishing a second user account on your Mac (in your case probably the test user). Its purpose is the sharing of files between several user accounts.\nThose files (and folders) may be personal data, Application Support files for all users or registration/licensing data.\nTherefore the read and write bits are set for all users (BTW t is a sticky bit): \ndrwxrwxrwt   9 root   wheel    306B 16 Aug 22:30 Shared\n\nThe user folder of the root account is /var/root and contains the same default folders as a normal account.\n\nAfter enabling the root user, the \"new\" user \"Others\" will be displayed in the login screen. This was done a \"few months ago\" as mentioned in your first EDIT section. There is no relation to the Update 10.10.5. You probably have done it yourself in the past or someone else who has admin access to your Mac.\nThe reason to be able to use your standard password with su is the identity of your password and the root password. If you change the password for root, you would have to enter this instead. If you then would like to su your admin user without knowing the root password, you would have to enter sudo su and your admin's password.\n", "Q: RAID Disk Space not Recovering I have a RAID disk where I keep my virtual machines.\nRecently I created and deleted a few and noticed that the space taken up was not being reclaimed.\nI tried deleting the .Trashes directory via Terminal but nothing changed.\nHas anyone experienced this?  I don't want to have to transfer 1.5 TB of data to another disk and back just to fix this.\nUpdate: I tried Verify and Repair disk in Disk Utility which did not fix it.  Here is the log FYI.\nVerifying volume “RAID”\nVerifying file system.\nUsing live mode.\nChecking Journaled HFS Plus volume.\nChecking volume bitmap.The volume RAID appears to be OK.File system check exit code is 0.\n\nVerify and Repair volume “RAID”\nRepairing file system.\nChecking Journaled HFS Plus volume.\nChecking extents overflow file.\nChecking catalog file.\nChecking multi-linked files.\nChecking catalog hierarchy.\nChecking extended attributes file.\nChecking multi-linked directories.\nChecking volume bitmap.\nChecking volume information.\nThe volume RAID appears to be OK.\nFile system check exit code is 0.\nUpdating boot support partitions for the volume as required.\n\n\nA: I had the same situation two days ago, not on a RAID although I doubt that matters, and I ran Verify Disk in Disk Utility on the drive and it said \"Volume bitmap needs minor repair for orphaned blocks\" so I then ran Repair Disk and it cleaned it up and my free space was what it should have been after emptying the Trash and it wasn't at the time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: I ran Verify Disk and Repair Disk in Disk Utility and was backed up before doing so.  As a general rule one should always have everything continually backed up and especially before performing Disk Level Operations of this nature, even thought I've never yet had a disk messed up doing so.\n\n", "Q: Should I install firmware for Samsung SSD 850 EVO? I've a Mac Mini Late 2012 model that I've recently replaced the HDD to Samsung SSD 850 EVO. Everything works fine(except damaged IR Sensor) and my Mac startup speed is fast. I've been searching around Google about the Firmware particularly for 850 EVO but there's no firmware to download from the firmware download page , and seems like there are problems regarding the firmware download for 850 EVO PRO model. \nSince the firmware is not found, is there a need to download and install the firmware? And since Samsung Magician is not supporting Mac OS, should I download a 3rd party TRIM enabler(like DiskSensei) or enable the TRIM support manually? Is TRIM necessary for every SSD?\n\nA: As far as I can see there currently exists no firmware upgrade for the 850 PRO.\nAs for TRIM, it is generally recommended to enable it (OS X does on its stock SSDs). There is now a new tool in OS X that will allow you to easily enable TRIM on non-Apple SSDs:\nsudo trimforce enable\n\n\nA: You may want to follow the story below.  I have a 840 EVO which I could not explain earlier corruption issues with TRIM enabled.  Currently, I am using a 850 PRO without TRIM as ZFS log/cache device for acceleration.\nhttps://blog.algolia.com/when-solid-state-drives-are-not-that-solid/\n", "Q: Why does \"Turn Passcode Off\" on iOS take so long? Actually, all of these operations take a lot longer than I expect:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn Passcode On\n\n*Turn Passcode Off\n\n*Change Passcode\n\n\nI'm not complaining. I'm a developer (not Apple tech) who thinks it takes longer than it ought to basically hash a few bytes and write to an SSD. I assume that's because the work involved in managing an iOS password is either more complicated than I imagine, or it's some kind of anti-cracking countermeasure. The more I wonder about it, the more curious I am about the details. Is it some kind of cool cryptography thing??\nDoes anyone know anything about this? What actually happens when I disable passcode-to-unlock behavior on an iPhone?\n\nA: As another answer pointed out, iOS 8 uses FDE with passcode enabled, much the same way FileVault encrypts a hard drive on a Mac. The more data you have, the longer it will take to de-crypt or re-encrypt all this stuff as you toggle it. \nThe secondary reason for this is by design: Mac OS and iOS have strong UNIX and BSD underpinnings, as most are aware (side note: how cool is it iOS auto-fills 'underpinnings' after I type 'UNIX'?!). UNIX systems implement a computationally expensive hashing algorithm, which is designed to resist brute-force attacks because it takes so damn long. While the effectiveness of this technique has waned as processors become faster and more powerful, it's still noticeable as the little spinny thing on your login screen just before you log in to your Mac, which would make sitting there and typing random passwords very annoying (read up on pam_unix if this interests the developer side of your brain). \n", "Q: nebulad thread crashed on iPhone 5 with

SIGABRT signal on your iPhone device (iOS 8.4).\nThe SIGABRT signal is usually send to a process to tell it to abort/terminate by calling abort() (abnormal program termination without cleaning up). This can happen in case of critical errors.\nThis is usually related to some seriously broken constraint. For example malloc() calls abort() if its internal structures are damaged by a heap overflow or there is a problem with memory allocation.source\nTherefore the crash could be related to memory issue, software bug or some hardware issue.\nThe suggestions are to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the device to free up the memory.\n\n*Upgrade your iOS (since the process is part of CameraKit framework which comes with iOS).\n\n*If it's keep repeating, report the bug at Apple site.\n\n", "Q: iTunes 12 doesn't show the correct number of photos to be synced and doesn't sync all photos I have iTunes 12.2 on a mac book pro with Yosemite, I use Photos app now instead of iPhotos after importing all of its events into iPhoto, plus I recently added around a few thousand pics and videos to the Photos app, the All Photos option in Photos app shows 4372 photos, whereas in iTunes when I select \"copy photos from Photos\" and \"All photos and albums\" options under the \"Photos\" tab it shows 3858 photos as the total number to be synced, where the hell those 500 photos have gone ?       \nI searched for a solution but couldn't find any, I also checked out this question: Why is iTunes only syncing some of the pictures (seemingly randomly) in each Aperture Event to my iPad? but couldn't also help me ..\nany help would be highly appreciated ...   \n\nA: I think that the 4,372 photos are all of your photos, as opposed to just photos to be synced. In other words, around 500 photos of those photos have already been synced to your iPad.\n\nA: I found out the reason, I should check: Include Videos option before I sync, once checked the total number is updated to the correct one.\n", "Q: iCloud password broken on iPad, works on computer I have a relative who smashed their iPad beyond repair. It's been replaced with a refurbished one. I restored the tablet from a backup on my computer (Win7, if that's relevant). It boots properly and the expected wallpaper and apps from the old machine are present.\nHowever we can't login to iCloud on the device. It always says incorrect password. To troubleshoot we logged in to iCloud on my computer, being very attentive to the email and password spelling. It worked.\nThe password is a dozen characters, mixed case alpha numeric (no symbols or punctuation). I'm absolutely positive it's being typed correctly.\nWhy is the correct password on iPad being denied?\n\nA: Solved! It turns out in this situation the \"incorrect password\" error is really \"can't connect to iCloud server to determine if password is valid\" error.\nAfter enabling WiFi, establishing a connection to local router, verifying internet was indeed available, login is possible.\n", "Q: Problem with reinstalling Facebook app on iPhone I accidentally deleted my facebook app on my iPhone5. \nWhen i tried to download it again it says \" Unable to download Facebook at this time.\" \nWhat's wrong? How can this be resolved? \nI already restarted the phone, still getting the same error.\n\nA: Here are a few things that you can try. These will be non-technical answers to you question.\nGo to Settings>General>Date and Time and toggle the Automatic switch. This will set the correct time for your iPhone, as sometimes the App Store does not download apps to iPhones with their clock set in the future.\nRestart the iPhone by holding down on the lock and home button at the same time for about 10-15 seconds until the Apple Logo appears (there is no red slider) then let go of the buttons.\nSign out of the App Store in Settings, sign in again and try to download.\nSometimes, users have connection problems to the App Store (or the App Store has an internal problem) so wait and try again later. You can use Facebook in Safari in the meanwhile.\nMainly this error occurs when Apple changes their Policies and Terms, or when the wrong time is set on the iPhone, because the iTunes/App Store Session is invalid or has expired. So this should help you, otherwise let me know in a comment and I will try to help :)\n\nA: It's not a problem with your device. It's a app store problem...\nThe Solution is Open iTunes on your PC and go to App Store via iTunes and download Apps and Connect your iPad and install.. (Do this for temporary period) sometimes you will receive same error report when u download apps from iTunes.. Click retry to download and install...\n", "Q: How can I swap the contents of my two MacBooks? I have two MacBooks (an old one mid 2009 with a 150 GB drive (128 GB used) and a newer from 2011 with a 300 GB drive (30 GB used)) and a 1 TB Hard Disk. \nWhat is the easiest way to move the content of the 2009 MacBook to the 2011 model and the content of the 2011 model to the 2009 model (so that basically the content of the the two MacBooks is swapped afterwards)?\n\nA: You could use Migration Assistant to move from the old to the newer, although OS X seems to have its own ideas about which OS are acceptable. Time Machine is also a good way to transfer files to a new installation. If these work this is probably the easiest.\nThe ultimate tool is to use the command line tool rsync which can transfer files and also (optionally) delete unmatched files. I use this to copy my user files to an external HD, for transfer to other Macs. I use a simpler rsync command to restore selected data to other Macs - e.g. I can selectively copy email data between a portable and other Mac.\nNOTE rsync does not need an external disk, but I prefer the security this offers.\nThe following script is used to copy my user data to a mounted disk.\n#!/bin/bash\n# 2015-03-31\nBACKUP_MOUNTED=$(mount | awk '/\\/Volumes\\/volname / {print $3}')\nif [ $BACKUP_MOUNTED ]; then\n    echo $BACKUP_MOUNTED\n    echo \"Commencing Backup\"\n    rsync -a --delete-excluded --exclude=Library/Caches ~ /Volumes/volname\n    echo \"Finished Backup\"\nelse\n    echo \"Backup drive not available\"\nfi\n\n\nA: You could open up the cases and swap the HDD. This is probably the fastest way, if you don't mind using a screwdriver. \n\nA: Make a time machine backup of the new mac, then disconnect the external drive. Next, use the migration assistant and a network cable or wifi connection between the two to transfer everything from the old mac to the new one. Next, use the migration assistant on the old one to import the time machine backup from the external drive.\n", "Q: Macbook pro will not connect to wifi? I have a Macbook pro late 2011. It has always been connected to the same wifi and never had any problems. I updated to Yosemite and now my wifi goes off all the time. Most of the time when I the in the password for the wifi it simply says invalid password. It is the correct password. \nI have followed lots of articles about this problem with Yosemite and tried all the suggested trouble shooting tips I can find. I even phoneed up Apple care and they just went through the same trouble shooting techniques which sometimes works by chance and then the wifi disconnects again. \n\nA: On my MacBook Pro I sometimes had similar difficulties. It always turned out that the cause were weak signals or interferences. Please try the following measures:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move your Mac closer to the WiFi Router / Airport. Alternatively place your router in a better spot (e.g. elevated). \n\n*Change our Wifi from the 2.4 GHz to the 5 GHz band (If you provide more info on your router, I might be able to give more info on how to do that)\n\n*Try to look for other devices that could cause interferences like TVs, bluetooth devices, microwaves.\n\n*If you have to use the 2.4 GHz band, try switching to a different channel. See what channel the WiFis around are using and choose a channel number that is farthest away from the others. Ideally select channel 1, 6, or 11.\n\n\nYou can analyse your WiFi environment pressing alt and your WiFi icon in the MenuBar. You will get some info like this. If you hover the mouse over other network names you also get information about those.\n\nThis article, for example, has more info on the issue.\n", "Q: Can't log into my iCloud account from Windows 8 I have got Windows 8 and I have tried several times to log into iCloud account, but nothing is working. The only way I am able to access my photos is if I go online to the iCloud website and log on. There has got to be something that I am doing wrong.\n\nA: Is this the first time you've tried to access your account through iCloud's App on windows? I also had a similar issue with Windows 8.1 a week ago. \nThe way I managed to solve this problem was uninstalling the iCloud from my computer, restarting, and reinstalling back the application.\nHere is the Apple Support Guide for Setting up iCloud on Windows.\n", "Q: Prevent someone else from using my iCloud account? I am using an Apple iCloud account that was created for me by a friend. I have a suspicion that my friend is now accessing my photos and videos through this account.\nWhen we created the account, we used his email address for the account's rescue email address. According to Apple:\n\nRescue Email Address\nGive us a rescue email address where we can send you a link to confirm\n  your identity and let you reset your information should any security\n  issues arise. This address is only for communicating information about\n  your security details. We won’t send any other types of messages to\n  this address.\n\nI have changed my password many times but I believe, because of the above, he can still access the account through the rescue email address we used when we created the account.\nCan you please tell me, if I changed my password, can he can find the password out using the rescue email address or not?\n\nA: To summarize what you should do in one single answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the rescue email associated with the account. You can do this by going to https://appleid.apple.com/ and clicking on Manage My Apple ID, logging in, and then making sure all the email addresses listed in Name, ID and Email Addresses section of your account are email addresses that only you have the passwords to access. In particular, the Primary Email Address associated with the account should be an email address that you and you alone control.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Under the Password and Security section in the Manage My Apple ID site, change your password. Do this after you change the email addresses on the account so you don't accidentally lock yourself out.\n\n\nWhile you're in there, you should make sure your mailing addresses and phone number are also assigned to identities that belong to you and you alone.\n\nA: The best thing to do would reset your password immediately. Unless he has access to your email account, too, he will be unable to see or get the new password, just use any other account than the iCloud email associated with your iCloud account. So, change the password as soon as you can.\n", "Q: Change in sleep behaviour on MacBook Pro and ignoring settings on Yosemite Recently (possibly since the 10.10.5 upgrade, but not sure) my MacBook Pro mid 2012 (non-retina) changed its sleeping behavior and I cannot seem to restore it. For years, I used a 48 hour hibernate delay (autopoweroffdelay). So when I close the lid or the sleep timer kicks in, my MBP would sleep (i.e. suspend to RAM) and pulse the Sleep Indicator Light (SIL) for 48 hours.\nBut recently my Mac will wake after approximately 1 hour of sleep and go into another sleep mode. I believe it is standby, because the SIL will turn off, but when I open the lid it takes only slightly longer than after the regular sleep state. In hibernate / autopoweroff it would take a while to load the RAM content back from the disk (which is not the case here). This does not happen when a USB disk is connected.\nHere comes my pmset -g:\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power       -1\nAC Power        -1*\nCurrently in use:\n standbydelay         172800\n standby              1\n womp                 0\n halfdim              1\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n gpuswitch            2\n sms                  1\n networkoversleep     0\n disksleep            0\n sleep                10\n autopoweroffdelay    2880\n hibernatemode        0\n autopoweroff         1\n ttyskeepawake        1\n displaysleep         10\n acwake               0\n lidwake              1\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you heard about any recent sleep-related changes in OS X Yosemite? How come my Mac suddenly ignores its settings?\n\n*What standby state am I dealing with? See my guess above.\n\n*And of course, how to make my settings work again?\n\n\nWhat I tried so far (will update):\n\n\n*\n\n*SMC & NVRAM reset\n\n*Onyx maintenance\n\n*Set all timers anew, e.g. sudo pmset -a autopoweroffdelay 2880, etc.\n\n*Change hibernatemode to 3 as suggested by @rewozz\n\n\nA: I can't tell why you Mac wakes up, but here is how you could find out:\nType pmset -b -g assertions in your terminal. That will list the drivers that have requested power setting overrides when running on battery.\nYou can also inspect the power management log, using pmset -g log.\nFor example, on my 10.10.5 MacBook Pro 2015, I found out that leaving my Sandisk Ultra fit USB3 memory stick plugged in makes my Mac wake up every 3 hours. Here's why:\n$ pmset -b -g assertions\n2015-10-19 18:38:32 +0200 \nAssertion status system-wide:\n   BackgroundTask                 0\n   ApplePushServiceTask           0\n   UserIsActive                   0\n   PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0\n   PreventSystemSleep             0\n   ExternalMedia                  1\n   PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     0\n   NetworkClientActive            0\nListed by owning process:\n   pid 51(powerd): [0x000000040008012e] 03:37:52 ExternalMedia named: \"com.apple.powermanagement.externalmediamounted\" \n\nExternalMedia is set to 1 by process powerd. \nUnfortunately I haven't found out yet how to prevent this. I looked for a \"com.apple.powermanagement.externalmediamounted\" plist file but could not find any... So I don't know if these driver overrides can be changed or disabled. :(  Anyway, I expect it is driver dependent, so changing the behavior should also be driver dependent...\nThis detailed web page seems to indicate that, for external media altering sleep behavior, the only option is to unmount or eject the external media. Based on the driver the external media uses, eject is sometime required while for other unmount is enought.\n\nA: My Macbook Pro 13-inch (2012) also started to show weird signs. When I close the lid and open it after 5 minutes, it wakes up normally. But if I put it to sleep for an hour and wake it, my DVD drive would make a noise like on startup boot. I do not see the overexposed screen with a loading bar like after hibernation. So there is definitely some new kind of power sleep that seem to shut off power to internal devices. I have \"Put hard disk to sleep\" option unchecked too. And as you mentioned the Power Nap is not supported on this model. Does seem to be a new Yosemite setting.\nEDIT - Although, I must admit I noticed that the battery now will last longer once my Mac is asleep for a while. After a few days in a sleep mode, I used to lose some substantial amount of power. Now it is just a few %. So I guess whatever they did, does help to preserve energy.\n\nA: A possible problem could be that you have Power Nap enabled. Power Nap is a service that periodically checks for email, iCloud updates, messages, etc. (in case you didn't know).\nIn order to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Open the Energy Saver preference pane\n\n*See if the \"Enable Power Nap...\" checkbox is checked\n\n\nNote that you may need Admin privileges to change these settings.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: According to Apple:\n\nWe do not recommend modifying hibernation settings. Any changes you\n  make are not supported. If you\n       choose to do so anyway, we recommend using one of these three settings. For your sake and mine, please\n       don't use anything other 0, 3, or 25.\n\nFurther Apple states:\n\nhibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables.\n  The system will store a copy of memory memory\n        to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from\n       memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from disk image.\n\nYou have set:\n\nhibernatemode = 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops. The\n  system will not back memory up to\n       persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on\n       power loss.

It attempts to connect for a while, then it times out I think because it remains blank. I suspect that the issue is with connection to the iTunes store, because although I have internet access, when I go to iTunes Help in the program it tells me that it cannot connect to the internet.\nI have tried several fixes which I read online.

I recently noticed large date range of emails gone missing. Rebuilding the mailbox did not solve the problem so I decided to restore my entire Mac from the Time machine. 5 days of frustration and here I am.\nTime Machine restores from the backup however, when I start Mac Mail, it starts to import the messages. I have 130 GB of emails. It seems what happens is when Mail is importing the messages, it is creating a duplicate folder in the system and that is eating into the HD space and not allowing the system to restore as it runs out of space. By the time it has imported nearly all the emails, my mac has run out of space and hence does not allow me to return to the original state. \nAny reason why this duplication of emails and even if so, where are these duplicate emails stored so I can manually delete that folder? \n\nA: I would try in ~/Library/Mail. You can delete the contents in this folder, then go into mail and rebuilt your inbox to make sure everything syncs.\nNote: it's called the MacBook Air\n", "Q: use two time capsules together I want to use the newer time capsule as my wifi.  I need the second time capsule because I don't have enough wired ports. \nHow can I connect the two of them?  I don't need the wifi on the second one.  Which one do I plug into the cable modem and how do I physically connect the second one as in do I plug it into the first one that has the wan cable plugged into it?  How do I configure them both? Thank you.\n\nA: I do this by using AirPort utility to turn off WiFi on the second Time Capsule. Configure it for:\n\n\n*\n\n*turn off the network which places it in bridge mode\n\n*allow setup over WAN if you want to plug the WAN port of the second AirPort into one LAN port of the Time Capsule that runs as a router.\n\n\nLeave all other settings default (so wipe restore the settings) and then give it a name and make the changes above.\nSo ethernet goes from the cable modem to the first TC WAN port.

B/c this storage can potentially become a bit large, I'd like to store my Google Photos on a 256GB SDHC card that is always plugged in to my computer.  The problem is, it appears I need the Google Photos folder to reside within my Google Drive folder, which is not on this external storage.\nIs there a good way to point my local Google Photos folder to external storage without messing up my other Google Drive folders?\n\nA: *\n\n*Move Google drives folder to the new drive\n\n*In Google Drive's settings, you should be able to select another directory.\n\n\nI'm not completely sure if this works, as I've only done it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign out of drive\n\n*Resign-in, and during the setup process, select advanced, and choose the folder location\n\n", "Q: Pan/zoom camera over a bezier path on a raster map in Apple Motion \n*\n\n*I have imported a raster map into Apple Motion.\n\n*I have drawn a bezier path on top of the map and used the Write On behavior to make the path slowly reveal itself (like a travel map during any adventure movie showing the route taken).\n\n*I've added a camera so that I can zoom and pan the camera over the path as it appears.  However, as I attempt to move the camera over the route, the path itself shifts above the map surface, making the path inaccurate with relation to the underlying map.  Of course, this is because the angle of the camera is changing, which makes the path appear to shift on top of the map.\n\n\nWhat I don't know is: how do I add camera moves over a Write On bezier path while not causing the path to appear to shift on the map? Obviously, I'm doing something wrong with the camera, but I don't know what.\n\nA: After a lot of experimentation, I have figured out the answer to this question. Make sure the raster map and bezier path are in the same group, open the group's inspector, click on the Group tab, and in the Group Controls section, check the \"Flatten\" checkbox.  Now, the bezier path will be flattened against the raster map, and there won't be any perspective issues when the camera flies around.\n", "Q: Does reseting iOS device revert to earlier version of OS I'm reading that you can use iTunes revert an iOS device to 'original factory settings', but this is hard to believe. Will it actually allow you to return to the earliest version of the OS that was installed on the device, or will it just give you a fresh install of the latest OS that was installed on the device?\n\nA: In my experience, iTunes just gives you a fresh install of the latest OS. It has to use the same OS that is installed on your device because while reverting back to the old changes - it can not physically look up the information for the iOS that originally came with your device. When you update your device, your iPhone saves over the old iOS settings so there is no way it can revert back to those changes. \n\nA: Restoring to factory settings using iTunes installs the latest version of iOS. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-ap/HT201252\n", "Q: OSX 10.4.11 Intel Macbook pro I am using Camino on OSX 10.4.11, this combination still works well.

This primarily affects my ability to use the BBC site.  Are there any alternatives without upgrading at this time since the MacBookPro I am using performs well.  I am very fond of the esthetics of this OS and have had only rare problems in 8 years of near constant use.  Can you make helpful suggestions? \n\nA: Camino is dead.\nCamino Browser\nSince it is dead, there will be nobody developing anything for it - it simply doesn't make sense.\nI do have to ask...why are you not using at least OS X 10.8?  What Intel MBP are you using that doesn't' support this version? \nThe bottom line is that you will need to upgrade.

Also that's why you can't download some apps for your phone.\n", "Q: iphone 4S not playing voice memo Cannot play a voice memo I recorded earlier this week.

I can play 3 of the 4 but no this one. Please advise.\n\nA: Your voice memo is being played through the earpiece speaker. You can listen to it, just tap play and put your iPhone up to your ear, as if you were taking a phone call. \nTo play through the loud speaker, like almost everything else, tap the speaker icon in the top right, it should turn blue. Now play your voice memo like you normally would and it will play through the loud speaker, as opposed to the earpiece speaker.

If I plug an iPhone that's running an old version of iOS into a computer with iTunes, will iOS on the iPhone automatically update when the phone is plugged in?\n\nA: You'll get a notification to download and install it. You can opt out of this though.\n\nA: No, your iPhone won't automatically update its software when connected to iTunes. You get an alert that your iPhone can be updated to newer version of iOS, but you can just close out of the window that the alert is in. Your iPhone may, however, automatically sync with iTunes when connected to your computer, but this can be disabled by unchecking a box in iTunes.\n", "Q: How to record my voice and output to speaker at the same time? When giving a speech, I want to record my voice and let people in the room hear clearly through a speaker. I have a macbook air, a bluetooth headset and a bluetooth speaker. Thanks.\n\nA: You need a USB Audio Mixer like this one Presonus Audiobox USB\nWhen you use audio software, if you CAN monitor the output, there will be a delay because it has to come in through the mic, record to disk, they play it back.  \nWhat this device does is take the live audio and send it into two different directions:\n\n\n*\n\n*to your computer for recording\n\n*to an external device like a PA system or audio system\n\n\nWhen you use this, you are not depending on your computer to play it back - it will go directly to the PA system while simultaneously recording it.\nThe best part is you can adjust the levels for your PA and recording independently so the quality is good on both - not on one and horrible on the other.\nUsing the Presonus as an example:\n\n\nYour mic would go into 1 on the front and you would have your computer plugged into the USB (back) and the MAIN OUT (back) would go to the PA.  You just need the right plugs at this point.\nI have used this setup many times and it works flawlessly.\n\nA: Just a shot in the dark here, but I am assuming your issue may be that the audio you are inputting is not being replayed as system audio out. I believe you can get garageband to both record and \"monitor\" (or play your audio back for you through the speakers) at the same time. \nI just tried and could not get garageband to pick up my mic in my bluetooth headset, so I am not sure if this will help, but at least it might get the next commenter started. \n", "Q: iCloud keychain problems - asking passwords, can't change password, can't unsync Main symptom: When I reboot I get multiple prompts asking for the \"local items\" keychain password. \nDetails: \n\n\n*\n\n*The password required is my old iCloud password, not my current user account password nor my current iCloud password\n\n*The keychain access program lists \"local items\" as a keychain until I log in to one with my old password -- after which it changes to \"iCloud\"\n\n*The option to reset the password for both local items (before entering the PW) and iCloud keychain (after) are both greyed out. \n\n*I cannot stop syncing my iCloud keychain.

I know I can \"link\" cells using Sheet1::Table 1::A1 but this doesn't work for new rows added to Sheet1::Table 1.\nMy application is that I have a \"master\" customer database sheet and I want to make an auto-updating filtered table from this \"master\" table in new tabs. To the best of my knowledge, this requires a new linked table that has a filter applied.\n\nA: Numbers as a spreadsheet operates very well for its intended design, calculating, storing and displaying (in a pretty way) tabulated data.  However many people try to use spreadsheets as databases.  When emulating a relational database, of sorts, using a spreadsheet is clunky at best.\nMaking links to individual cells in different tables on different sheets is easy, but filtering entire rows remotely on a separate table is quite another task.\nDatabases use a unique ID in so as to reference data between tables.  You can use this to do so with formulas in Excel and Numbers but to automate this process may require scripting.  (In the case of Excel, VBA.  Numbers can be scripted with Applescript.)  iWork Automation has several tutorials and examples on how to script Numbers.\nWhat I have used to good success in referencing data from a master sheet or table is the following formula:\nIndex ( Match ())\nThere is a plethora of information on the Internet as to how to use this formula, and there are many ways to implement it.  Getting the Nth row based on criteria without a filter is tricky, however.\nThis answer for Excel VBA on Stackoverflow may be a start that can be used as a base (with proper syntax formatting of course) for an AppleScript service that may work.\n", "Q: Why does the system always show 200 MB occupied by Photo, but my iPhone has zero photos?

I know that there is no standard format, but something that looks like formatted output rather than XML would be ideal.\nThere’s nothing on the App Store, and I’ve done rounds of the search engines.\nI would prefer a solution without Java.\n(I’m going to ask the same about an asciidoc viewer in another question).\n\nA: I don't think there is a DocBook viewer for OS X.\nThe workaround seems to be to convert the DocBook document to another format using a converter.  Here are some suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*dblatex: Can be used to convert DocBook to PDF.  It is free, and installable using Fink.  However, if you are already using Brew you might mess up your system if you start using another package manager.  An alternative would be to use dblatex on a Linux VM, but that would be a great deal of work if you don't already have one set up.\n\n*OxygenXML - a commercial product that can read DocBook XML.  It has a 30 day free trial period.   I tried it on my DocBook document, but it was not well formed and Oxygen couldn't parse it.\n\n\nSo in the end, neither of the two options worked for me, but they might for you.\n", "Q: Does iMessage need wifi I'm concerned about it and I really want to use it. I haven't used it and I need some tips so someone please tell me if it needs wifi.\n\nA: No - iMessage works over any viable network connection.\nAssuming you are on an iPod touch, since WiFi is your only viable network, then it follows you need WiFi, but it's not a limitation of iMessage as much as it is of your hardware. iMessage works fine over ethernet, cellular data equally as well as WiFi.\n\nA: You'll require internet for iMessage. And you can have access to internet through WIFI or 2G/3G/4G on any of the device. \nThus if you can access a website you can use iMessage.\n", "Q: How to share geolocation tags in photo streams? I have made over 3000 pictures during my last trip, mostly with the iPhone. \nI then shared them as a photo album in iCloud with my family, but neither of us can figure out how to enable geolocation data. It obviously would be quite handy to know which picture is taken where, and display the map like photos can for unshared pictures.\nHow is that done?\n\nA: Under Preferences, select \"Include location information for published items\". You then probably need to delete and re-create your shared album to get the location metadata\n", "Q: Can you transfer your applications like photoshop from your old mac to your new macbook? Is it possible using a passport external hard drive and tome machine to transfer applications from my old macbook to my new macbook?\nPlease advise a safe way to do this if it is possible? \n\nA: Generally speaking the Apple Migration Assistant (in /Applications/Utilities) will transfer documents, settings and Applications.\nHowever some (most?) Applications transfer flawlessly and some do not. I would imagine, what with all the posts I see online, that Adobe applications may require more than just Migration Assistant. At the very least you will have to activate the applications again with Adobe. You may have to reinstall the apps or even call Adobe support to activate/authorize your Adobe applications on your new Mac.\nBut I would start with Migration assistant, unless someone here with specific experience with migrating Adobe apps says otherwise.\n", "Q: How to backup photos app on Mac? I used to use iPhoto but then Apple scrapped it and introduced Photos app. Earlier to backup my library I would copy the iphoto library to external hard disk, but after this new introduction I have iPhoto migrated library (More than 50GB) and also a Photos library (around 70GB).\nCan anyone let me know which library/libraries to copy on my external disk?\n\nA: Photos has migrated the iPhoto library to the Photos library. Photos no longer reads from or writes to the iPhoto library. You only need to back up the Photos library.\nProviding you have no referenced masters in the iPhoto library, it's fine to delete. Keep a backup of it for a while in case anything doesn't work. You can copy all your referenced masters into your Photos library by opening your Photos library, navigating to All Photos, selecting all the photos and choosing File → Consolidate…. If you have any referenced masters, this will copy them into the Photos library, such that all the data is contained within the Photos library.\n", "Q: How do I reference a paragraph in Pages 5? How do I create text like \"See 'paragraph' on page n\"? Where paragraph could be a heading or a figure etc.\nObviously, I mean where page n is determined by Pages, as with other word processing programs.\n\nA: This is currently not possible. You'll have to enter the page number manually. You can use comments to remind yourself where these occur and to update them.\nYou can provide feedback to Apple here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/pages.html\n", "Q: New user notifications on Telegram app I keep getting notifications when a new user in my contacts joins telegram. Is there a way to disable this? \n\nA: Short answer is: no!\nNo way to really disable Contact Joined notifications with Telegram in iOS.\nBut, if you prevent Telegram from having access to your contacts, it will stop the notifications, but it's not without side effects, like not knowing who sent you a message, so, I don't think it's a viable option. \n\nA: my answer is this is a bug. \nTogether, let's ask them to fix it \nI mentioned them on Twitter now please do the same or even better tell me if you know an official channel for such requests \n\nA: There is an option to disable these notifications both on iOS and Android.\nWhat we don't have now is an option to disable new chat creation for every new contact joined Telegram :(\niOS:\n\nAndroid:\n\n\nA: Regardless if any app doesn’t have granular settings to let you choose which notifications get sent, you can always stop them all.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the settings app.\n\n*Select notifications.\n\n*Scroll down to the app in question and disable notifications.\nIf you need an app to have granular control of notifications, open a bug report with the vendor of the app or see if an alternate app can work with the service. \nDevelopers and services can tell which accounts have stopped getting notifications so they can react before they lose you as a customer. \n\nA: you just can't do this. telegram have no option to disable new users joining notifications. all or nothing via general notifications settings.\n\nA: Simply use Telegram Web \nhttps://web.telegram.org\nAnd bingo!  you won't be seeing these irritating user joined notifications :)\n\nA: Here telegram says you need to delete your contacts and then you will not get any notifications for new users joining.\nIf you prefer to have your contacts synced then you could do what @PavelAlexeev suggested but the chats will still show on your feed, you just will not get a push notification for them. In this case I suggest you use Telegrams relatively new folder feature and that way your feed will not be cluttered.\nI personally removed the syncing and I just add the contacts manually to Telegram when someone writes me there, and they called themselves @fdjsnvdljkv with no profile picture...\n", "Q: AsciiDoc viewer for Mac OS X Is there an AsciiDoc viewer for Mac OS X? Preferably one that views the document live, much like MacDown for markdown documents.\nThere’s nothing on the App Store, and I’ve done rounds of the search engines.\nI would prefer a solution without Java if that's possible.\n\nA: The Google Chrome browser can render AsciiDoc files.  Just open an AsciiDoc file from Google Chrome using the menu item File -> Open File or the keyboard shortcut Cmd-O, and you should see the \"live\" file.  \n(Edit: I forgot that this requires the Asciidoctor.js Live Preview extension for Chrome).\nIn your editor, when you make changes and save the file, Chrome will automatically update its view.\nAlso, some editors (e.g. Atom - see https://atom.io) also have plugins that do live previews.\n\nA: Update:\nI have since then found the following additional solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Atom with asciidoc-preview\n\n*Marked 2 - Smarter tools for smarter writers (Get the non-AppStore version for technical reasons).\n\n*GitBook Editor\nIn the first 2 cases, you will also need to install asciidoctor.\nAtom is my preferred every-day solution, as it uses a split window and updates automatically.\nMarked 2 simply watches and automatically previews a text document which you edit in any other text editor. Getting it to work with asciidoc requires a few extra steps, and the App Store version gets in the way.\nGitBook Editor should be the most satisfactory. I has gone through a few disruptive version changes, but is mostly working again. My main problems with it are that there are no line numbers, which makes editing long documents a bit of a pain, and you have no control over the styling.\nIt is designed to work with a free or paid GitBook account, but it is free, and you don’t need use one.\n\nA: If you already use any of the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEs (I wouldn't recommend installing them just for this purpose) then there is an AsciiDoc plugin available.\nOpen an AsciiDoc from File->Open menu, it will show the plain text.\nTop right it should indicate a plugin is available, click on the link and install the plugin.\nBottom right it should suggest for you to restart the IDE to make the plugin active. Click \"Restart\" and wait for IDE to restart.\nYou will get a dual-pane view (text plus preview) of the doc, like this:\n\nAnd at the top of this pane you have some controls, among them the ability to view just the raw text, both, or just the preview.\n", "Q: Video files organizer for mac I'm looking for an app to organize my video files (movies, series, etc.) much like iTunes does with music. I'd like it to have series support (separating seasons and ordering episodes) and to have an option for adding posters/covers to every movie/series.\nIs there something like that?\nI'd rather if it was a free app, but I'm not limited to that.\n\nA: Forgive me if I've missed something, but iTunes organizes video files and meets all of your stated requirements as of the time of this posting.\nYou can add images to the file's metadata, set the season, and set the episode by right-clicking on the file, selecting 'get info', and entering the data in the appropriate spaces.\niTunes will display files' artwork and split seasons.  It even has different views available in a menu in the upper-right corner of the window.\n\n\nA: iTunes has entire sections dedicated to Movies and TV Shows, alongside Music, that allows you to do everything that you asked for. Files can be imported in your iTunes Music library, or a separate library, and can be organised into series/seasons and episodes, with cover photos.\n", "Q: Problem after cloning a Mac with dual boot I bought an SSD to upgrade my MacBookPro (late 2011) and have cloned the HDD with CloneZilla.

I have had my machine for more than a year now, and I'm looking at Memory Pressure in the Activity Monitor.\nWhat is this memory pressure and How do I \"relieve\" this memory pressure from my system?  \nI've done reboots, and it shows clear for a while, but eventually builds back up.\n\n\nA: Memory Pressure is a better indicator of the health of the virtual memory system than the traditional UNIX measure of free, inactive and active pages.\nFor a brush up on the previous measure, have a read at:\n\n\n*\n\n*Isn't Inactive memory a waste of resources?\nNow, the caching of files is drawn as a good thing (green memory pressure) and you will only see the pressure raise in the main window of Activity Monitor when you have a large proportion of wired memory or the system starts swapping RAM to storage and evicting too many cache pages.\nThe image from your window looks perfectly fine - so I wouldn't worry about reducing the pressure. If you want to reduce the pressure, you can do so by quitting apps and then letting the system manage that memory. If your Mac can accommodate more RAM, adding RAM would reduce the pressure for the same line up of programs running and using memory.\n\nA: Here's what Apple says the graph means:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201464\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Memory Pressure: The Memory Pressure graph helps illustrate the\n  availability of memory resources.

Also, post a comment after my answer, so I will be notified.\nQuestion:\n\n1) Recovery HD is visible, which, I could be mistaken, but this shouldn't be visible OR mounted in Disk Utility\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn the MBR partition table, the id should be AB and you have AF. In the GPT, the partition type should be 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC and you have48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC. This is why it is visible.\n\nQuestion: \n\n2) disk0s4 is actually ext4, NOT JHFS+.\n\nAnswer: \n\nYou used the gdisk to change the partition type code for disk0s4 from AF00 to 8300 while disk0s4 while it was still mounted. The Disk Utility application will not see the change until you unmount and mount disk0s4.\n\nQuestion: \n\nwhere is disk0s5\n\nAnswer:\n\nCurrently, the fifth entry in the GPT is not being used. You have not given any information regarding the values in this table entry, other than due to its absence the partition type must be 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. For all anyone knows, the UUID, attributes, label and starting/ending sector numbers may still be stored in the fifth table entry. \n\nNote: I have observed the Disk Utility application requires the entries in the GPT to be in ascending order and contiguous. The output of the gpt command shows the indices to be in ascending order, but since the fifth entry is missing, the indices are not contiguous. When a situation like this occurs, the Disk Utility application can incorrectly display the contents of the GPT. In your case, the errors shown by the Disk Utility application where most likely caused by the use of gdisk.\nWhy did you use a BIOS/MBR install of Ubuntu? I know you can download such an iso, but the EFI/GPT iso version also works on Mac's. This is what I choose for my mid 2007 20-inch iMac. This way you can avoid using a hybrid GPT.\n", "Q: How to prove this is a 42mm or 38mm Apple Watch? I want to convince someone that this image belongs to the 42mm Apple Watch.\n\nHowever I couldn't distinguish between them yet.\n\nA: While that is just a rendering of the Apple Watch, not an image of an actual Apple Watch, the band is a Modern Buckle, which is only available for 38mm Apple Watches. So the Watch in the rendering is definitely a 38mm.\n\nA: Pixel densities are 272×340 and 312x390. If the image/photo is high res enough you could zoom in to count the pixels. Or if you have the watch at home count the pixels of one detail, big ben clock, the digit 9, ...\n", "Q: Xcode 6.4 sync to app store from new machine after old lost About a year ago, I have developed an iOS app on a Mac machine and synced it to the app store.\nThat machine has lost, so I got a new one connected to my Apple developer id. I have recovered my work and changed a few things in the code.\nBut when I try to resync the app, I get the attached warning.\n\nFrom a quick search on Google I realized that I needed to export my developer profile from my previous machine and import it on the new machine.\nBecause I don't have access to that machine I need to somehow recreate the developer profile.\nAny idea for how to do it?\n\nA: You don't need the old developer profile any more because you don't want to concurrently develop on two machines. Therefore, you can revoke your certificate and generate a new one to install on this machine. Go to the Member Center → Certificates, click the + button and generate a new development certificate.\n", "Q: Does Dropbox Auto Camera Upload work with iCloud Photo Library? Currently, I store all my photos in iCloud Photo Library. However, I'd like to have another copy of them in Dropbox. Ideally, I'd want my iPad to upload all new images that I add to my iCloud Photo Library on my Mac or iPhone automatically to Dropbox. I have iCloud Photo Library configured to store only thumbnails on the iPad. \nDoes the automatic Camera Upload work when I do not download the full-res images to my iPad?\n\nA: The answer seems to be \"No\". I tried various things around iCloud Photo Library and Dropbox Camera Uploads.  Here are some results.\n\n\n*\n\n*Already since Sierra 10.12.2 (or slightly earlier?), Camera Uploads seems to only work if the iPhone is plugged in in an unlocked state.\n\n*After first enabling iCloud Photo Library, the \"camera roll\" contains a random selection of photos of different ages (most of them not even shot with the iPhone).  \n\n*The program \"Image Capture\" (comes with MacOS) which can be used to manage the Camera roll shows also these old photos.\n\n*Image capture can not delete any photos from the iPhone anymore, but it can still import these old photos and new photos taken.\n\n*Dropbox camera upload does not seem to do anything anymore after iCloud Photo library has been enabled.  It does not even display the little \"Camera icon\" right after connection.\n\n*I share pictures with my wife through Dropbox and I do this now by periodically exporting the unmodified originals from Photos on the Mac.\n", "Q: Group iMessage mixed up ID I responded to a group iMessage, but it showed up as being a response from my wife.  She also has an iPhone, but our phone numbers, email addresses and Apple IDs are all different.  How in the world did this happen?

Do any of your wife's contact details show up?\n", "Q: Zabbix agent installation On the Zabbix website it says Mac OS X agent is supported, however, I do not see a download link available. Does anyone know how to install the agent on OS X?\nHere is a link to the list of supported platforms: http://www.zabbix.com/requirements.php\nAnd here's the link to the downloads: http://www.zabbix.com/download.php\nThere's no OS X option to download for pre-compiled agents.\n\nA: I was disappointed too.\nAccording to zabbix, it isn't in their plan to distribute a binary agent for Mac. That's a shame.\nHowever, I found a post which describes how to do it yourself. Once compiled (once), you can deploy the agent executable to many machines...\nI yet have to try.\nhttp://bluepilltech.blogspot.lu/2015/02/how-to-compile-zabbix-agent-on-osx.html\n\nA: Use these:\nhttps://github.com/mipmip/zabbix_agentd_osx_installer/releases\nThey are already compiled and they created a nice installer\n\nA: These days Zabbix does offer macOS agents for download:\nhttps://www.zabbix.com/download_agents?os=macOS\n\nA: Install Homebrew.\n(You should use this on MacOS for software installation anyways)\nhttps://brew.sh/index_de.html\nAfter installation do:\nbrew install zabbix --without-server-proxy\n\n..for a agent only installation or do:\nbrew install zabbix\n\n..for a full installation including server and proxy\n\nA: Installing zabbix via brew no longer works:\n# brew install --without-server-proxy zabbix                                                                                                                                     \nError: Running Homebrew as root is extremely dangerous and no longer supported.\nAs Homebrew does not drop privileges on installation you would be giving all build scripts full access to your system.\n\n", "Q: Finder rejecting/renaming file extension? I was just attempting to set up a local web project, and came across a peculiar behavior. If I try to change an existing filetype from anything to .scss, Finder ends up rejecting the new filetype and appending the old one to it.\nRenaming styles.css > styles.scss becomes styles.scss.css\nRenaming blank.txt > blank.scss becomes blank.scss.txt\nIf I use terminal or a text editor to rename and save the file as styles.scss, finder just leaves off the extension and shows it as styles.\nThis doesn't happen with a .sass extension, so I can just use that for now - but I have other projects that use .scss so I'd like to be able to get around this if possible. Has anyone run into this issue, or found a way to resolve it?\n\nA: Found the answer in a related question here: Prevent automatically appending file extension when renaming file\nThe solution was to turn on the Show all filename extensions option in the Finder preferences; for some reason having it disabled forces Finder to append a \"sensible\" extension to files. This also solved a problem where my .gitignore and .htaccess files were being appended with an invisible .txt\n", "Q: Why can I not make a hard link to PkgInfo? With bash as my shell, a simple way to demonstrate my question is this:\nmkdir -p foo.app/Contents\ncd foo.app/Contents\necho -n 'AEgxFXTC' > PkgInfo\nln PkgInfo f\n\nThe ln will fail with ln: f: Operation not permitted\nI am on 10.10.5 with a Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) file system.\nThere seems to be some magic squirreled away in the file system for files named PkgInfo inside a directory named Contents.  The contents of the file does not seem to matter.\nWhat is the magic specifically?  Are there other magic names besides PkgInfo?  Why is it special?  etc.\n\nA: This is an undocumented security \"feature\" of macOS. See https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!topic/anaconda/CB0zClGfh3c\n\nThis turns out to be an issue specific to *.app/Contents/PkgInfo and .app/Contents/Resources/.lproj files. OS X does not want to permit the creation of a hard link between one of these items in an application bundle to another file in a non-application-bundle folder. I was unable to find an explanation for this behavior in Apple's documentation, nor in the source code for HFS or the OS X kernel.\n\n", "Q: Is the trackpad in the Mac Air connected to the keyboard? My wife spilled a little water on her Mac Air -- MD760ll/A which we got in August 2013 (just outside of any AppleCare warranty).  At first it was completely dead, but I removed the back and battery and sopped up the water and used a desiccant in a sealed box to dry it out even further.\nNow it turns on, but the keyboard and trackpad don't work, however I can use the Mac with a USB keyboard/mouse.\nIs the trackpad connected to the keyboard?  If that's the case is there the possibility that I would only need to replace the keyboard?\n\nA: I'm sorry to hear about your wife's MacBook Air; it's always frustrating when accidents like that happen. According to this step in iFixit's teardown of the 2013 Air, it appears that the trackpad is attached to the motherboard, instead of the keyboard:\n\nAgain, best of luck with the repair of the MacBook. If she can do without for a little while, waiting for a refresh in the line may be worthwhile, depending on the extent of water damage that isn't readily apparent (water damage can manifest weeks or even months after the fact.)\n\nA: Yes and no. While the trackpad is connected to the keyboard, the trackpad and keyboard are separate parts and the trackpad may be fine, depending on where the water spilt and how quickly is was dried out.\nIf you have some experience with repairing electronics, get a 2013 MacBook Air keyboard assembly. It should include the keyboard and the aluminum panel that the keyboard's mounted in. You can buy just the keyboard, but having done that myself, I strongly recommend you buy the whole assembly, even though it's quite a bit more. You can buy the keyboard assembly on eBay (make sure you get a good one from a US seller) and find great repair guides on iFixit (they also have an, albeit buggy, iOS app).\nOf course, you could also go to a pro, if you don't feel comfortable with the repair yourself, but be prepared to pay hundreds of dollars.\n", "Q: iPhone Health \"Walking + Running Distance\" is way off The \"Walking + Running Distance\" on my iPhone 6 is wildly off.\nI've walked <2 miles today (0.5 mile commute, 0.8 miles for lunch, and whatever around the office), yet my iPhone is reporting 10.3 miles. It's been way off like this for a while.\nIs there any way to troubleshoot what's happening here? Or recalibrate the feature?\nNumber of steps seems OK...6767 steps at 1.5ft/step would be about 2 miles, which is close to my estimate. \nAdditionally, I cannot \"Show All Data\" for any of the health metrics, the loading spinner just keeps spinning.\n\n\nA: If you have any 3rd party apps for health tracking, like Withings, they sometimes add onto your records.\nMy experience was my Withings app completely doubling my steps and distances.  If you do have these apps, delete them or just turn of their accessibility to your health.\n\nA: The whole thing's weird... it says 7k steps but the top line shows 3k, Walk/run again, 10m, but the top line is only 5... & repeat for the flights.\nThe top line ought to be the next 'sensible' number above the highest single point recorded for that day/week/month.\nI'd try at least a reboot if not a restore.\nThe issue with waiting forever to view the details may be related. I lost about a week of data when mine did that. The dotted lines are a giveaway that it's not reading its own data correctly.\n", "Q: Terminal: command to show application folder I recently discovered that I can open application from Terminal like this:\n$ open -a TextEdit\n\nIs there any command that would just show the application folder instead of opening it? Such that I could do this:\n$ alias vmrun=\\\"`some-command 'VMware Fusion'`/Contents/Library/vmrun\\\"\n\nI need that some-command to print the folder of VMware Fusion application.\nUPDATE: I don't know where the application is installed, otherwise I could just hardcode it in the script\n\nA: I have just created and uploaded a GitHub Gist GitHub Gist which may help you out.\nThe main functionality is:\nfunction get_apps_folder () { \n    mdfind -0 -onlyin / \\\n        'kMDItemKind==\"Application\" && kMDItemDisplayName=\"'\"${1:-TextEdit}\"'\"' \\\n    | xargs -0 -I{} dirname {} \n}\n\nfunction open_apps_folder () {\n    open $(get_apps_folder \"$1\")\n}\n\nYou could take that and add the two functions to your ~/.bash_profile and they would be available for any interactive shell sessions you are using. (And yes, getting around mixed and embedded single and double quotes can be messy.) :-)\nBut, to give a better explanation, the main part is:\nmdfind -0 -onlyin / 'kMDItemKind==\"Application\" && kMDItemDisplayName=\"VMware Fusion\"' | xargs -0 -I{} open {}\n\nThe -onlyin /path limits the search to just the root volume, otherwise any “Spotlight-searchable” volume attached will most likely be searched as well, including Time Machine, which can get unwieldy and/or verbose, hence using -onlyin /. \nIn the Gist, each line output by mdfind is fed to xargs which calls open on what is passed to it. Note that there is no particularly robust checking of what is passed to xargs (ie. it is assuming it is getting a directory).\nmdfind and mdls can be pretty handy for things like this, although they can take a little getting used to. I usually use mdls /path/to/file to get an idea of what metadata that type of file has. I can then take those keys and values to search using mdfind. You can find a lot of pages, examples and documentation out there, BTW.\n\nA: I believe this is what you're looking for:\nalias vmrun=\\\"`osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to get POSIX path of (application file id \"com.vmware.fusion\" as alias)'`/Contents/Library/vmrun\\\"\n\nNow when I type vmrun, without any arguments, in a Terminal and press Enter it outputs the internal help file, as it should.\nThis works on my system, however it returns the first occurrence of the \"VMware Fusion.app\" application bundle's path.  I have four different visions installed, so this would not be ideal in my situation, although for those that only have one version installed it works.\n\nA: \nJust type:  \nmdfind <target_file_name.ext>\n\nIf there are any matches, you will be presented with the relevant associated path(s). If there's more than one, choose whichever is appropriate and hardcode it.\n\nFor example:  \nme@MacBook-Pro:~$mdfind \"VMware Fusion.app\"\n/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/vmware-fusion/7.1.2-2779224/VMware Fusion.app\n\n\nOr more likely, one of these:\nyou@MacBook-Pro:~$mdfind \"VMware Fusion.app\"\n/Applications/VMware Fusion.app\n/Users/you/Applications/VMware Fusion.app\n\n\n\nA: Two quick and easy options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use Spotlight (mdfind) via command-line for high level items:\nappLocation=$(mdfind Fusion.app)\necho $appLocation\n/Applications/VMware Fusion.app\n\n\n*Or if you use the locate binary (pre-requisite command to enable it will be noticed first time you use it).\nappLocation=$(locate vmrun)\necho \"Found at \" $appLocation\nFound at /Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmrun\n\n\nA: You have to add:\nalias vmrun='/Applications/VMware\\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmrun'\n\nto your ~/.bash_profile, save the file and source ~/.bash_profile. In the future you just have to type vmrun to launch the tool.\nIf you need quick access to any more commands from this directory you can add:\n:/Applications/VMware\\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/\n\nto your path.\n", "Q: Group processes by apps in Activity Monitor under Memory tab I am using OSX 10.10.5 with activity monitor 10.10.0.

Your password must have a minimum of 8 characters, not contain more than 3 consecutive identical characters, and include a number, an uppercase letter, and a lowercase letter.\n\n\nA: Here are the guidelines I found on Apple's website.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: These are the expanded requirements from Apple:\n\n\n*\n\n*At least 1 letter\n\n*At least 1 capital letter\n\n*At least 1 number\n\n*Cannot contain multiple identical consecutive characters\n\n*Cannot be the same as the Apple ID account name\n\n*A minimum of 8 characters\n\n*Not a common password\n\n*No reuse of old passwords for one year\n\n\nMost people are tripped up by the multiple identical consecutive characters requirement and the last two requirements in the list. I'm not sure if Apple is also checking for use of all or part of your real name(s) from your account information in your password. Some password systems I've used enforce this additional requirement.\nIf you have too many passwords in your digital life, consider using a secure password manager like LastPass or 1Password. \nDisclaimer: satisfied personal and enterprise user of LastPass only.\n", "Q: Performance of Virtual Machines on MacBook Pro with and without discrete graphics I am trying to decide between MacBook Pro 15\" with and without Discrete Graphics Card. My work involves running 2-3 Virtual Machines using Virtualbox \nat a given time with Chrome, Microsoft Outlook & Skype running on OSX. I am not in gaming at all.\nI already have a MacBook Pro 13\" Early 2011 with 16GB RAM and 256 GB SSD. But this machine gets very hot when I run above tasks on it. \nAt my location MacBook Pro 15\" with Graphics Card and 512GB SSD is going for $2499 and MacBook Pro 15\" without Graphics Card and 256GB SSD is $1999. So for $500 I am getting extra 256GB and Discrete Graphics card. Is $500 worth this upgrade for my workload.\nAlso next machine I want to buy is in 2020. Please help.\n\nA: I run three ubuntu VM, light garage band or Logic Pro and Safari, FaceTime and Apple productivity apps on the 2015 MacBook - base model, base storage, base RAM.\nYou'll have significant CPU hogs choosing Chrome over Safari (in general), Skype over iMessage and Office over Apple's Apps. \nWhatever Mac you push with that workload will become thermally overloaded and throttle the CPU, and since you want the Mac to last for half a decade, you might as well get the best CPU, most RAM and go for the 15 inch model.\nYou could run all the apps on a lesser Mac, but if you don't care how hot it runs, get the most watts you can pump out and you'll have the best performance.\nYou want the 2.8 GHz CPU, so you get a better value with the dual GPU option since you get another 2 GB ov VRAM which will get used / free up some of the 16 GB main memory for other uses.\nIf you doubt the 2.8GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 4.0GHz is enough, you should get a lesser portable and run your VM on a desktop even if said desktop is a Mac Mini.\nYou also might consider getting a MacBook / 13 inch and combining it with an iMac for the cost. Much better VM, but you don't carry it all with you. Remote access to a VM isn't any slower than running the VM locally - in fact, it's probably much faster with a desktop CPU instead of a mobile CPU where much more energy can be had, much more heat dissipated and more bang/$.\nGood luck buying. It's an interesting CPU and RAM centric workload, so you have lots of good tradeoffs to make - every $ you upgrade will give you noticeable benefits, so it's really what your time is worth and how much sacrifice you'll endure to buy the top of the line or two Mac to run that workload.\n", "Q: How to remove windows partition without having to erase the other one? I have an imac late 2013 with a fusion drive. I've created a windows 10 partition and I'd like to delete it.

I just want to erase the windows partition without having to erase the \"macintosh hd\" one. \nIs there a genius out there who can help me ?\n\n\n\nA: I had this same issue about 2 years ago and had to take it in to Apple to have mine fixed. The long and short of it is that your computers HD is really locked up and without the help of the Genius Bar it wont get fixed on your own. They had to work their magic for 5 days before they got it back to normal. Good luck. \n", "Q: Does Bootcamp modify contents of the USB used? If I'm planning to install Windows 8 using Bootcamp, will it modify the contents of the USB I use without my permission? I just plan to download the ISO and place it in a folder inside the USB/EHD.\nI'm debating whether I should use my External Hard Drive which has some important data, or if I should go out and buy a USB stick for this.\n\nA: When using a USB device, whether a stick or a external HDD, Bootcamp will format the device before using it for the Windows installer image. \nThus, you'll need to use a device that you don't mind getting erased. \nSimply copying the .iso file to a USB device won't work. Also, keep in mind that the Bootcamp app also adds a bunch of Apple-provided drivers to the device, as well as help you prepare a partition for Windows, among other things. \n", "Q: How do I create a home screen button with a tel:// URI? I can create a home screen button with a tel:// uri using Apple Configurator, but this requires installing a profile on the phone and is not that straight forward.\nWhat I would like to do is create a home screen button with and icon that is my picture and that when tapped invokes a tel URI instead of an HTTP URI without mucking about with custom profiles and the Apple Configurator.\nIt would be best, of course, if this was something I could walk someone (an older someone) through over the phone or with a Clarify document.\n(I have elderly parents and inlaws that are now finding making calls on their iPhones confusing, and they can never seem to find the favorites tab in the phone application. A simple button would solve this, for now).\n\nA: As it turns out it is possible to create a profile in Apple Configurator that creates the button(s) you want, save it, and then send it to the person to install, which will then add the buttons. Totally painless on their end, so I can certainly deal with creating the profiles.

I need to have an idea of what the recordings will sound like on an iPad. I have an iPad, but I'd like to change some settings on my Mac speakers so that every sound sounds like it's coming out of an iPad speaker.\n\nA: Depending on your budget, I would use something like Rogue Amoeba's Audio Hijack 3 to process the sound output and model the speakers of the iPad.\nIf you have extra budget, you'll want to record in a acoustically quiet room some songs and test tone generators out of the actual iPad speakers (and maybe sample several devices to see how much variation is present in the iPad line). Use a high quality microphone if possible for this.\nYou'll have issues correcting for the Mac speakers though and should probably invest in some good powered studios monitors or headphones if you really want to hear what the iPad would sound like.\nIf you don't have decent audio analysis software, you might want to look at something like Spectre\np.s. FWIW - My MacBook 2015 (40% volume) sounds about the same as my iPad Air 2 (90% volume) and passing the MacBook audio through the AUBandpass filter.

I've updated all iTunes, attempted restore on a Windows 7 machine, two Mac machines, with one iPad power chord, two iPhone power chords, and multiple ports. Every iteration has resulted in the same 4013 error. \nApple concluded it was a hardware issue and would cost $199 to fix.

Please anyone can help me?\nThe kali Linux system selection appears first so I think that it goes straight to Linux or that the keyboard is not recognized and I cannot change the boot disk. \n\nA: Press cmd-r when booting to take it into recovery mode. Here you can click on Disk Utility and choose a startup disk/partition. You might need a driver to use the wireless devices with Linux.\n\nA: I resolved the problem so I post it as an answer if someone else have the same problem. \nBecause the wireless mouse nor keyboard works in kali, I get a wireless mouse and thought a virtual keyboard (you can enable it in accessibility settings in kali) I could enable bluetooth and use my wireless mouse and keyboard. From that I try different things but the solution was deleting the efi file of kali so rEFInd will not detect kali linux and boot into OS X. Finally I delete the partition where kali was.

I guess I can have only 4 partition so that this works efficiently.\nCan I just delete disk0s3 or will I have to start from installing windows?\n\nA: Here I will assume you are using the BIOS/MBR legacy boot method for Windows. This means you are using a hybrid GPT. \nIdea 1:\nYou could delete disk0s3 so you only have 4 partitions. I would first copy the contents disk0s3 to a flash drive. The application needed to do this can be found here. It works with Lion through Yosemite. I have not yet tested with El Capitan.\nThe downside is that at some point an update to OS X will recreate the \"Recovery HD\" partition. So you will need to apply this fix again sometime in the future.\nIdea 2:\nUse gdisk (or some other tool) to create a MBR table that does to include disk0s3. In other works, you create a MBR table that contains disk0s1, disk0s2, disk0s4 and disk0s5. You then flag the fourth partition as active.\nThe downside is that other software (especially the Disk Utility application) will see this as a bug and may try to fix it so the MBR table contains disk0s1, disk0s2, disk0s3 and disk0s4. So you may need to apply this fix again sometime in the future.\nIdea 3:\nChange the order of your partitions so Windows occurs before OS X. In other words, you want diskutil list to produce the following output.\nVikrams-MacBook-Pro:~ Vikramguria$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                81.0 GB    disk0s2\n   3:       Microsoft Basic Data SHARED                  167.9 GB   disk0s3\n   4:                  Apple_HFS MACINTOSH H             250.3 GB   disk0s4\n   5:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s5\n\nThe downside is this limits the use of the Boot Camp Assistant. The Assistant can still be used to create the installation media, but you probably will have to manually install Windows.\nWhat is meant by manually install? This depends on whether you want to backup OS X and Windows to an external disk or just start over. Having copied the \"Recovery HD\" partition to a flash drive aids either option. Booting to the flash drive allows you to repartition the disk. Also, you can either backup/restore OS X to/from an external disk or reinstall OS X from the internet. I backup and restore Windows using a third party tool called Winclone. It works great but costs money.   \nIf you have additional questions, please post a comment below.\n", "Q: Typing the control+\\ (backslash) on Apple keyboard I've been trying for quite some time now to figure out how I'm supposed to type the escape sequence '^\\', Control+Blackslash on a Mac.\nI have a Swedish keyboard with the Swedish Pro layout, and I have backslash on Shift+Alt+7, but pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+7 just gives me a 7, not the escape sequence I would expect.\nThe closest thing I found while googling is: How do I send C-/ (that is, control-slash) to the terminal?\nBut it doesn't give away how to do the Control+Backslash, any ideas?\n\nA: As a user of the Danish Apple keyboard, I face similar issues.

How can i change this?\n\nA: The Apple ID is how the iCloud system identifies you. If you share an Apple ID, then iCloud thinks you are using both phones. If you don't want the calls to show, then don't share the Apple ID.\nWhy are you sharing an Apple ID? Is it to be able to share purchases from iTunes/App Store? If so, you CAN use a different Apple ID for the App store than your Messages, iCloud, backups etc. Simply use the shared Apple ID with the App Store login, but for iCloud, use a personal Apple ID. That way, calls won't show up on your phone, but iTunes/App Store purchases can be shared. Or, use Family Share, as Family share allows you to include personal Apple IDs in a purchasing 'group'.\n", "Q: Console Message: \"kernel: Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 391\" I'm getting about 50 messages like the following on the console every second.\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 402\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 401\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 400\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 398\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 397\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 396\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 395\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 394\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 393\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 392\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 389\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 383\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 379\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 378\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 377\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 376\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 375\n01/09/15 17:50:32,000   kernel[0]   Sandbox: net.conceited.Ru(295) System Policy: deny(1) mach-priv-task-port 374\n\nCould someone points me on what's happened and how can I avoid it?\n\nA: This is indeed Rubbernet as @unknowndomain mentions - I was getting a flood of messages that caused 100% CPU for syslogd, visible in Console.\nSince Conceited have gone out of business, here is how to uninstall Rubbernet:\n\n*\n\n*open the Rubbernet .plist file that was launching the daemon, which should be /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.conceited.RubbernetDaemon.plist\n\n*ensure Launchd doesn't restart the Rubbernet process with launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.conceited.RubbernetDaemon.plist\n\n*kill the Rubbernet process via Activity Monitor, or using ps aux and kill\n\n*remove /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/net.conceited.RubbernetDaemon (mentioned in the plist)\n\n*remove the plist -\nrm /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.conceited.RubbernetDaemon.plist\n\n*remove the app - delete Rubbernet.app from /Applications\nWriting this up because of the large number of \"Uninstall Rubbernet\" spam content sites that are promoting easy uninstall tools.

I've just installed a new SSD in my mid 2010 27\" iMac. I put it in place of the disk drive (ODD) so now there is no optical disc drive in my computer. After I did the installation I noticed that the fan speed shot up to ~3000 rpm and stayed there. So I downloaded SSD Fan Control and I'm currently using it to keep my ODD fan speed at ~1000 rpm. The system is running fine (from what I can see) and the noise it down to a minimum.\nWhat I want to know is are there any dangers in doing this? The SSD isn't going to generate much heat at all but if there anything else around that part of the iMac that will generate enough heat to warrant letting the machine set the fan speed?\nI'm assuming that this change in fan speed has happened because there isn't a signal being sent to the ODD temp input in the machine (since I've taken the ODD and thus the thermometer out, so it's defaulting to the highest rpm possible.\nThanks!\n\nA: So, just to be clear, you replaced the optical drive in your iMac with an SSD and I am assuming a drive caddy.\nIn the process, you removed the optical drive temperature sensor:\n\nWhen this sensor is absent, the fans will spin up to full speed.  This is the \"fail safe.\"  So, you are using a software utility to control the fan and essentially override the systems ability to regulate temperature.\nI would try to find a way to put that sensor on your drive to better control the fan speeds as the chips themselves would heat up under heavy use. Kapton tape should work just fine.\nDamage?  I don't know because I never removed this sensor and I am unwilling to experiment.   \n", "Q: Can I use the same Apple ID from my iPod for my iPhone? I just got the iPhone 6 and I had the iPod 5. Would I be able to use the same ID for both so every thing is transferred on to there?\n\nA: Yes, use the same Apple ID, do not create a new one. The Apple ID is what 'ID's' you to the Apple system, allows backups, preferences, purchases, etc to be sync'd between devices. If you create a new Apple ID, you will lose all your purchases, etc.\nYou can use a different Apple ID for the App store than your Messages, iCloud, backups etc. Before Family share, you could have an Apple ID that was shared with your Family for purchases (everyone got access to the app or song), while maintaining different, personal Apple IDs for Messages, iCloud etc. However, with Family Share, you do not need to do this, as Family share allows you to include personal Apple IDs in a purchasing 'group'.\n\nA: The answer by @cmmason above explained Apple ID very well, but if you want to transfer everything over to your iPhone 6, then follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect iPod Touch to computer with iTunes on it\n\n*Click the iPod Touch in the top left\n\n*Cancel automatic backup, if you have that enabled\n\n*Check Encrypt Backup\n\n*Click Backup Now, and yes, you wish to copy whatever apps that are not in your iTunes library into your library.\n\n*After the backup is complete, unplug your iPod from your computer and plug your iPhone 6 in.\n\n*Click the iPhone in the top left of the window\n\n*Click Restore Backup and select the backup of your iPod that you just made.\n", "Q: I can no longer play my songs consecutively on my iphone I have been playing music on my iPhone for years, updating it with new songs I purchase regularly from iTunes.\nRecently, my list of songs looks different and I can only play one song at a time, and if I don't stop to change songs, the song just repeats over and over, even when I hit shuffle. Very frustrating while I'm trying to run with continuous music.\nI've noticed the red icon has recently turned white.  Not sure if this is relevant. \nHow do I get back to my original format?\nThank you!\n\nA: Apple has updated the music app. The icon changed with the update in iOS 7, I believe, and the music app saw some big changes with iOS 8.4. Some of the UI is harder for me to figure out and use but all of the old functionality should still be there. \nTo play an entire playlist, tap the Play icon in the upper right of the playlist. It should be overlaid onto album artwork (likely of 4 albums). \nTo have continuous repeat, after starting the playlist, tap the bar just above the navigation bar to see \"Now Playing\". Then, at the bottom (you may need to scroll down) there are standard icons for repeat and shuffle. If the repeat icon in the lower right had a \"1\" next to it, it is set to Repeat 1. Tap the icon to change it. \nYou can find more information about the new Music app here:\nhttp://m.imore.com/how-use-new-music-app-iphone-and-ipad-ultimate-guide\n\nA: Mine started this on the recent update.

I upgraded my wife's iPhone to a newer model but she can't remember her Yahoo mail password which is stored in Keychain on her old phone.  She uses the standard iOS Mail app which successfully fetches mail from Yahoo on the old phone.  \nI've tried syncing the old phone's keychain to iCloud then syncing it back to the new phone using the same process, but with no success.  If I add the Yahoo account on the new phone I am always presented with a blank field for the password.\nShould I reset the new phone completely and do a restore from iCloud?\nAlso I can't use Yahoo's 'forgot password' options on the web because the she also forgot the password to the rescue account.\n\nA: If you can sucessfully recieve email from your wifes old phone, maybe try restoring the password. \n\nA: Try looking in Settings app > Safari > Passwords & Autofill > Saved Passwords. It might be there. \nAlternatively, if you, or your wife, uses a Mac, you should be able use the Keychain Access app (In Applications > Utilities), if your wife's iCloud account is logged in on said Mac as well.

It's good enough for me to develop apps on, though it's not like I'm using Metal to make 3D games or anything. I personally wouldn't get a MacBook Air, as it's just not a performance laptop and you'd get a lot more out of a slightly older MacBook Pro.

It needs to be transferable quickly and easily so I can incorporate the code in my notes as a textbox in notability. The catch is, it also has to retain the text color so I can read it. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: There isn't a single great option for this because you can't copy directly into the clipboard of the iPad from the background, so in a sense you can't sync your clipboards.\nHowever there is Pastebot which was quite good, it's a bit old now, but should work still.\nAlternatively iCloud syncing through Notes.app is pretty fast.\n", "Q: Migrating local accounts to locally stored network account We have local users running on stock MacBooks, but it's time to move up and start managing things.  \nActive Directory accounts are created for all users, and OSX Server is pushing the AD config profiles down to our hosts.  \nOur local users have rather complex development tools and environments installed locally to their account, so it would be preferred to preserve them.  \nSimply copying files over from the old account to the new mobile account does not work (as expected).  \nWhile I've seen suggestions to try Migration Assistant, it does seem to want to work for local accounts, and is instead expecting a time machine backup, or an import from a different machine.  Both of these might end up being rather time consuming, when a better operation would be to simply rename the ~ directory to the same short_name of the AD user.  But of course, this causes issues with keychains, application plists, and who knows what else.  \nI can accept having to recreate keychains and plists if necessary, but it would be preferred to have a short script that can be written to solve the migration with minimal user impact.  \n\nA: My suggestion was going to be Migration Assistant, however you'll need to make a backup ISO or time machine to import from, or another machine as you've mentioned.\nThere is unlikely to be a clean way of doing this honestly...\n", "Q: How to direct an app to use a specific Java version?

It appears that different Java versions can be called from Apple's own JRE:\n/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6.0 --exec <Java command>\n\nMy understanding is that this doesn't actually provide a different JRE, but simply causes the installed JRE to identify itself as the called version, and implements any minor differences between versions. Others should definitely correct me if this is not the case. \nFor your purposes, this would be\n/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6.0 --exec java -jar <yourJarHere>.jar\n\nThe above linked post also points out that you can edit the file called /Applications/yourApp.app/Contents/MacOS/yourApp to use the correct command so you don't need to re-type that or remember every time. \nAll this courtesy Geff\n\nA: It seems that Oracle could have fixed this.

My wife has a MASSIVE iPhoto library -- thousands of snapshots of her cat and food and flowers, vacation photos, and so on, all taken at the highest resolution on her digital camera (up to 12 Megapixels).\nThe library is taking up tonnes of space and it's bogging down iPhoto and her old iMac.\nShe only ever uses these photos for Facebook and things like that -- maybe some of them might get printed as 5\"x7\" prints for a photo album or something.\nSo I'm thinking it would be nice to reduce all of the images down to a max size of 1920 pixels (height or width, depending on landscape or portrait orientation).\nIs there an easy way to reduce the size of all photos in the iPhoto library?\nI was thinking of doing a massive export of all photos to a folder on an external drive with those max dimensions, but my concern is that I would lose all the iPhoto album organization.\nAny thoughts?  \n\nA: Because these digital images represent irreplaceable data, and exporting in smaller resolutions in essence deletes some data, I'd move these images to an external HD to keep them in their original sizes.\nFor data-dense backups, inexpensive external dual-layer Blueray burners can store 50GB per disc.\n\nA: sips offers a handy way to do this via command line. That plus a quick bash hack should probably do it.

You'd have to export, remove originals, then reimport the exported, smaller photos. And you'd have to account for your organization, since from iPhoto's point of view those are new photos.\nYou might try making separate libraries, and storing some of those photos elsewhere. External storage is probably cheaper than your time spent trying to crop or resize or even cull all of those.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina 15\" (mid 2012) screen is glitching in specific situations The display of my macbook is glitching as you can see in image below.

Unfortunately today my iPhone 6 Plus was stolen from my pocket on the streets of Sao Paulo. I did not have cellular data turned on. I had Touch ID and a 4 digit number lock in place.\nHow much data can an attacker get off the device? Presumably with access to the hardware he can pull off everything, but I understand it is encrypted?\nIn particular I am concerned about cached emails in the GMail app, and the Apple Keychain, which retains some credit card information and many passwords for internet sites.\nAbout one hour after the phone was stolen, I received numerous password reset requests on my Facebook account. I have changed my master email password and Facebook login.\nThe iPhone never showed up on \"Find my iPhone\" and although I have requested a remote erase, I suspect that isn't going to happen.\n\nA: Actually, the data on your iPhone 6 is encrypted at rest and furthermore no data comes off the device even if it is connected to a computer. Someone would need to brute force the PIN and then press Trust to trust a computer which would then be able to transfer off data or sync the device.\nIt's suspicious you got password resets. Perhaps the lock screen was configured to allow them to reply to messages or dial phone numbers or otherwise look at incoming mail. That would of course mean that the phone had WiFi or data connection - so in that case, the remote wipe is a good possibility.\nI hope you get a response to the wipe, but you are in a fairly good situation all things considered.\nHere are Apple's documents on how data is protected and what to do in the case your device is lost or stolen:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202775\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201472\n\nA: I have a partial answer:\nThere is a tool called \"doucli\" that purports to unlock any iPhone, even with the iCloud Activation Lock in place. It appears to have worked once, but may be a hoax now. Although there are many YouTube videos showing it work, largely uncommented videos seems to be the extent of its publicity.\nJailbroken phones can be completely unlocked without difficulty by deleting the appropriate files from the /var directory. (My phone was not jailbroken.)\nThere are numerous bugs that enable access to already running apps without a PIN by clever exploitation of the Control Centre (the panel appears by swiping upwards). Disabling the Control Centre from running on the lock screen is a work around.\nThere are also \"features\" in Siri that will grant access to contacts, recent messages, parts of Facebook and Twitter and notes by carefully phrased commands. Disabling Siri on the lock screen would prevent this.\nI suspect the Facebook password resets were initiated by using my phone number to request the password reset, and then receive a text message for verification; this only requires physical access to the SIM card and not access to the unlocked phone.\nOn the negative side, I still have not received notification that my phone has been wiped.\n\nA: Two situations:\nSituation 1: If Find My iPhone is enabled on your missing device\nYou can use Find My iPhone to find your device and take additional actions that can help you recover it and keep your data safe.\n    Sign in to icloud.com/find on a Mac or PC, or use the Find My iPhone app on another iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.\n    Find your device. Open Find My iPhone, and select a device to view its location on a map. If the device is nearby, you can have it play a sound to help you or someone nearby find it.\n    Turn on Lost Mode. Using Lost Mode, you can remotely lock your device with a four-digit passcode, display a custom message with your phone number on your missing device's Lock screen, and keep track of your device's location. If you added credit or debit cards to Apple Pay, the ability to make payments using Apple Pay on the device will be suspended when you put your device in Lost Mode.\nReport your lost or stolen device to local law enforcement. Law enforcement might request the serial number of your device. Find your serial number:\n    On the original box or receipt.\n    On My Support Profile (supportprofile.apple.com) if you registered your device with your Apple ID.\nErase your device. To prevent anyone else from accessing the data on your missing device, you can erase it remotely. When you erase your device, all of your information (including credit or debit cards for Apple Pay) will be deleted from the device, and you won't be able to find it using Find My iPhone. After you erase a device, you can't track it. If you remove the device from your account after you erase it, Activation Lock will be turned off. This allows another person to activate and use your device.\nSituation 2: If Find My iPhone isn't enabled on your missing device\nIf you didn't turn on Find My iPhone before your device was lost or stolen, you can't use it to locate your device. However, you can use these steps to help protect your data:\n    Change your Apple ID password. By changing your Apple ID password you can prevent anyone from accessing your iCloud data or using other services (such as iMessage or iTunes) from your missing device.\n    Change the passwords for other internet accounts on your device. This could include email accounts, Facebook, or Twitter.\n    Report your lost or stolen device to local law enforcement. Law enforcement might request the serial number of your device. Find your serial number:\n      On the original box or receipt.\n      On My Support Profile if you registered your device with your Apple ID.\n    Report your lost or stolen device to your wireless carrier. Your carrier can disable the account, preventing phone calls, texts, and data use.\n", "Q: Outlook 2016 shared calendar doesn't show appointments I'm using Outlook 2016 on my mac connecting to office 365.\nI can add shared calendars fine, and most calendars work absolutely without an issue for calendars that have permissions set to User = Default, Role = Reviewer.\nBut on some calendars where the Properties are set to User = Default, Role = Free/Busy, time, subject, location (i.e. the owner of the calendar doesn't want me to see the notes on the meeting), I can't see any appointments at all. It simply shows a blank calendar.\nWhen I use Outlook 2013 on Windows with the same account, I can see the calendar entries for that use just fine.\nDoes anyone have a pointer on how to make Outlook 2016 respect the privacy settings of the shared calendar but still display the appointments as it should?\n\nA: Outlook 2011 users must be granted \"Reviewer\" access to another person's calendar to be able open that calendar and view details. If a user sets permission levels only to allow free/busy or free/busy limited details, an Outlook 2011 user will not be able to see any details of the shared calendar.  \nPC users must grant \"full details\" to the Outlook 2011 user. Mac users must grant the \"Reviewer\" role to Outlook 2011 users. \nBasic free/busy time viewing is only viewable via the Outlook 2011 Scheduling Assistant feature, or via OWA. (Note: Outlook 2011 users who have a \"Reviewer\" role may also be able to select another users name within the Send As / From drop down menu. Unless you have explicit permissions to Create Items within the selected users mailbox, Exchange will not allow you to send on the behalf of that person).\nAbove is true for Outlook 2016\n\nA: Empty appointments in a shared calendar could be caused by events that are marked as private from one of your colleagues. So it's a privacy feature in Outlook.\n\nA: I'm seeing a similar problem in my organization. From what I can tell, the situation for us appears to be as follows:\n\n*\n\n*A user created a shared calendar.\n\n*Another user became the \"moderator\" of the shared calendar. (All members have edit rights)\n\n*The original user who created the folder's account has been removed.\n\nPROBLEM: New users who are added will see the appointments added to the calendar up to that point, but any new appointments added by any user will not be seen by the new user[s].\nSo, in the current state, users who were granted access to the calendar before the user was removed are still able to use and sync the calendar. Any new user added to the calender will get a copy of the calendar in the state they were added to it, but then any new events will not sync to them after they've been added.\nIt seems like the earlier users maintain some sync between themselves, but new users can't accurately access the calendar.\nComparing OWA and Outlook versions helped me realize that must be what's going on in our case.\nSOLUTION: In my case, I'll be looking into creating a calendar in either sharepoint or a shared mailbox.\n", "Q: How long to hold key combinations when booting a Mac? I can't believe no one has ever asked this, but I can't seem to find it: \nHow long should you hold down key combinations, such as Command + S, while your Mac is booting? I can get this iMac to boot into safe mode (sometimes), but not Single User, Verbose, or Diagnostic modes, which seems strange to me, thus I assume I'm not doing something correctly.\nDo you just hold the keys briefly or hold the keys for longer? If the latter, how long exactly? This iMac just has that gray boot screen, and there's no indication that anything is happening, so I have no way of knowing when I should stop pressing the key combos or if pressing them is even doing anything.\n\nA: In general, you should hold the key(s) down until they take effect. For single-user and verbose modes, that means hold them until you see text start to appear. For the others, it's generally ok to let go once you see the Apple in the middle of the screen (the Apple is drawn by the booter, which loads after the firmware has detected startup options).\nIf you have FileVault 2 (full volume encryption) set up, things are a little more complicated, since some key combinations (mainly single-user, verbose, and safe boot) don't take effect until after you've authenticated to unlock the startup volume. It currently seems to do a good job of detecting the key combos before the authentication screen, then having them take effect after you \"log in\". But if that's not working for you, try holding them down as you press return on the FV2 authentication screen, and keep holding them until you see them take effect.\n\nA: That's because it will differ slightly depending on what hardware and the startup behavior it's being preformed on. From Startup key combinations for Mac it states:\n\nSome Mac features are available by holding down certain keys during\n  startup. \nPress and hold the keys immediately after you turn on your Mac and\n  hear the startup sound. Keep holding until the described behavior\n  occurs. These combinations work with Intel-based Mac\n  computers.\n\nSo the timings will very a little bit although it should be relatively quickly to realize the target behavior it taking place.\nAs an example my 7 year old MacBook Pro does everything considerable slower then my 2 year old MacBook Pro so to give explicit timings for various startup behaviors will vary as much as there are different speeds of processors, etc. and is why Apple states it in the terms that do and not not in seconds, etc.\n\nA: Make sure you hold down the special key(s) upon hitting the power button, and keep holding the special key(s) down until you hear the startup chime.\n\nA: It used to be simple - If the screen gets drawn with a total grey background, you can let go since the time to have the startup keys modify the boot order has passed.\nNow it's complicated with Boot EFI, Recovery HD and FileVault.\nHere is the article from Apple documenting the Mac Hardware and OS X startup sequence.\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/HT204156\n", "Q: How do I Change Force Touch \"taptic\" or haptic feedback on MacBook Pro? I love my new MBP Retina but I would like to change the amount the Force Touch vibrates.

I am wondering if there is any way to turn the vibration of the Taptic Engine up even further to receive a more tactile click. Is this possible? Can I use BetterTouchTool to achieve this result? I tried to mess around with it a little bit but I don't think it works.\n\nA: I think the hardware has plenty of \"weight to shake things more\" because on the \"Firm\" click setting, the Force Touch vibrates quite a bit. I just wish that that was the default level of haptic feedback. (I could do without Force Touch; I just want a really solid \"click\" when I click.)\nI really miss the mechanical button on my old Macbook Pro.\n", "Q: Transfer Photos From Mac to iPhone How could I transfer photos from a Mac to an iPhone? I don't want to use iCloud Photo Library or Photo Stream. I think there is some way to do it using iTunes.\nI would like it if the photos were stored on the iPhone so that they would be available offline through the Photos app on the iPhone. Is there any way to do this?\n\nA: I have been using iMazing (on the Mac) and FileApp (on the iPhone) which make it very simple, and you can just drag and drop your files back and forth.\n\nA: It's now April, 2021. One might think that an ostensibly simple task such as transferring a photo from your computer to your phone would have become easier. But that doesn't seem to be the case - perhaps Apple will, at some point in the future, come to realize this simple task has been needlessly complicated. But I digress...\nI found myself faced with this requirement earlier this week. After searching out, and trying a few \"solutions\", nothing worked - I simply could not get the photos transferred from my Macbook Pro 16.1 (macOS Catalina) to my iPhone 11 (iOS 14.4).\nThis was particularly frustrating because I had actually taken the photos with my iPhone, then transferred them to my MBP! The iPhone->MBP transfer was simple and easy with the Photos app on my MBP. But as is my usual practice, I selected the \"delete after transfer\" option to save space on my iPhone. In this case however, posting the photos online had to be done from an iPhone app instead of via a browser :(\nLesson Learned: The iPhone->MBP transfer via the Photos app is a one-way street... you can get back to where you began, but the MBP->iPhone requires a completely different route!\nI grew tired and annoyed trying different \"Apple Solutions\" published on the Internet - I caved in, and called Apple Care. It was a fairly lengthy session as the technician had to research the task. This was perhaps complicated by the fact that I refused to pay $0.99/month to add enough additional storage to my iCloud to implement the technician's preferred solution.

So all Apple instructions are based on that.  If you do not have iTunes (why not?) , you cannot follow those instructions.\nWith that said, there are Apps in the App store that allow you to transfer files outside of iTunes. But it depends on the App in question.\nSome let you upload files to them via a browser (over Wifi), other's make the iPhone act as a USB drive.   Many use iTunes File Sharing ability.\nDepending on the App is what you need to do.\nFile Manager allows you to do this over Wifi via a Browser for example, without having iTunes at all:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7435735\n", "Q: Is my 13\" rMBP capable of running a 4k monitor at 2560x1440 scaled resolution? I have a late 2013 13\" rMBP and a 4k monitor (3840x2160) that's running at 60Hz over mini display port. Right now it uses a scaled 1920x1080 resolution so everything is displayed at 2x HDPI (retina mode), which seems to be default.\nEverything is a bit big for my liking, however, and on the flip side 3840x2160 is far too small, so I was hoping to go for around 2560x1440 for a happy medium.\nAs System Preferences seemingly doesn't permit this, I downloaded SwitchResX, created a custom resolution (\"scaled\" mode and 2560x1440 resolution) and selected \"save\", rebooted, but it still won't show up in System Preferences.\nWhat am I doing wrong?

This is wrong. Clicking \"Submit for Review\" puts your app in the back of the queue. Meaning it will take another week or so.\nThe correct way is to reply to the resolution center message saying you corrected the error.

I connected from iPad to MacBook Pro (mid 2012) by USB. I turned on iPad personal hotspot and Internet Sharing works.\nNow I want to share my MacBook Pro's internet connection too. I made the following setting but it is not working for me. In Wi-Fi options I set the following: Channel: 1, Security: WPA2 Personal. \nHow can I make it work?\n\n\nA: This is a very interesting situation and one that didn't, for me at least, bring any clear-cut obvious answer. Here is what I found.\nFirst, I created a very similar setup to yours. I connected my iPhone to my Macbook Pro and tethered USB. I had to forget my current wifi network so that I could actually share over my computer's wifi. So, first, double check that your computer doesn't have an active wifi connection (I couldn't tell from your screenshot). A MacBook Pro cannot receive and send a wifi connection - it is a one way street.\nI then tried creating a network from the USB connection. This did not work. I then connected my ethernet cable and confirmed that internet sharing worked fine and it was just something about the USB that was problematic. I next proceeded to test Bluetooth tethering. I connected to my phone solely over Bluetooth and once again the computer created a wifi connection. (By the way, the wifi icon changes to a block of gray with an arrow pointing up when the sharing is working). I confirmed on my iPad that it created a perfectly good, and connectable wifi.\nI went back and connected only through my USB connection and once again, the computer would not create a wifi. One thing to note about working with this is that there really aren't any errors. If it doesn't work, the only real way to tell is that it won't create a network. While that is fairly obvious, it would be nice to have some error saying why it won't share the USB connection.\nThe only thing I didn't try was rebooting, but I just started the computer this morning as it was shut down last night, so I see little chance that would work.\nIn conclusion:\nI suggest that you either tether over Bluetooth (and sacrifice some speed, potentially), or just use your iPad to share wifi and Bluetooth.*\n* I'm a little curious why you don't do that anyway, but that doesn't matter.\n\nA: I don't think it's possible when using a shared network (you can share your internet connection through wifi if you're using ethernet).\nWhy can't you make a wifi hotspot directly from the iPad ?\n", "Q: Some files from Google products (preferably Chrome browser) appearing at random places I have Google Chrome browser installed on My MacBook Air 13\".

They are created outside the program binary because that's how applications should behave on OSX. \nIf you delete them, you'll loose your chrome preferences and they will be automatically recreated by Chrome, so no need to delete them.\n", "Q: Can I edit Demo account details in app review information in iTunes Connect when app status is “Waiting for Review”?

I'm more than enough with a 1 month old backups.\nI read on Apple's website about the deletion on files on disk but as this is a NAS disk it's a bit different than a regular USB external HDD and it shows me only a lookalike of the \"img file\" (when I go to get info, it says \"Sparse Disk Image Bundle\") see screenshot:\n\nWhat is your advice?\n\nA: The sparsebundle is a disk image file and probably contains your Time Machine files. If you double-click it, it should be mounted. If not, launch Disk Utility and open it from there (File > Open Disk Image...). \nIn order to delete backups, enter Time Machine, select a snapshot (time) and right-click in the Finder window. From there you can delete the snapshot by clicking Delete Backup. Watch out no more confirmation will be asked! You can also delete all backups / snapshots of a file or folder by selecting Delete All Backups of ....\nIf you are more the Terminal kind of person you can also use tmutil. This would look somewhat like this:\nsudo tmutil delete /Volumes/Time_Machine_Disk/Backups.backupdb/computer/date/\n\nYou should only use these methods and not delete files manually from your mounted sparsebundle image.\n\nA: This is the easiest solution using macOS Terminal. \n\n\n*\n\n*Get a list of all the backups in Time Machine. This will also show you the full directory path to the backups that you will need in step 2.\n$ tmutil listbackups\n/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/{your-macbook}/2018-10-02-213405\n/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/{your-macbook}/2018-10-09-192323\n/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/{your-macbook}/2018-10-19-212659\n\n\n*Choose which backups to delete based on their date. Note the use of a wildcard * and the use of the directory from step 1. For example, to delete all of 2018's backups you would use this:\n$ sudo tmutil delete '/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/{your-macbook}/2018-'*\n\n\n*The final step is to shrink and recover space from the sparse bundle. Search your backup drive for the .sparsebundle file. \n$ sudo hdiutil compact '/Volumes/{your-mac}.sparsebundle'\n\n", "Q: Why won't USB Mount to Desktop? I have a Mac. I plugged in a USB stick and I realized that I couldn't find the USB in my Desktop folder through the command-line. Turns out USB is mounted to ~/Volumes.\nIf there's an USB icon on the Desktop, why can't I see it in the terminal? Also since they put a USB icon on Desktop, why not mount the USB to Desktop?\n\nA: The usb icon you see in your 'desktop' is a finder's option, it has nothing to do with your actual desktop directory.\nYou can link the usb to your desktop directory : \nln -s /Volumes/\"usb\" ~/Desktop/\"usb\"\n\nthis way you'll have the usb folder on your finder's desktop and you desktop directory \n\nA: Click on the Finder icon on the dock, then on the Finder text at the apple logo, click preferences, and then you can see show these items in desktopm Check them (sorry for inprecision. I am not on mac now). This views it on the Desktop as a shortcut. I don't think it is feasible to mount a Volume to the Desktop.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro with abnormal CPU usage and unrecognised battery. How to alternative SMC reset This Macbook Pro (15\" circa 2012) is giving me trouble. After a slight water spill incident, I removed and replaced the hard drive, optical drive and battery (warning sticker ignored). After another day drying I turned it on. However, the battery is not recognised, everything's happening slower and the mouse is really jumpy. I've also noticed the CPU load from the Activity Monitor remains steady at 80%-90% for the System (kernel_task). I'd like to reset the SMC to see what happens, but it doesn't seem to be resetting. The PRAM/NVRAM reset is working, just not the SMC reset (I'm using shift-control-option + power). Is there another way to do the SMC reset? Maybe open it up and poke around some more?\n\nA: In the Apple Support article on SMC reset it reads \"On MagSafe power adapters, the LED might change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC.\". Other than that SMC reset does nothing visible. So probably the reset is working.\nIt seems like the battery is dead. In that case the Mac will throttle the CPU to reduce power consumption. This explains also the high load. Since the battery is necessary to buffers peak loads, the MacBook relies on it to operate properly.\nYou must replace your battery.\n", "Q: External hard disk not showing up on finder and can't be verified in Disk Utility My Mac suddendly restarted and now the external hard disk I normally use for Time Machine backups is not working anymore. When I plug it in, it doesn't appear on finder and while it appears in the Disk Utility, I can't perform any action on it. \nFrom the command line I tried with the command diskutil list, but I just see the default Mac hard disk.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: If you can see your external drive in the disk utility app, there is no reason that it won't show up when you hit 'diskutil list'.\nIf you still can't see it after 'diskutil list', try unplugging it then 'ls /dev/disk*' then replug it and redo 'ls /dev/disk*' and see if another disk appeared. (It should be disk2s2 or disk2s1) then 'diskutil mount /dev/disk2s2'.\nIf this doesn't work, your drive is probably corrupted.\n", "Q: Unable to repair hard drive - due to volume assignment problem?

(I found this tutorial) Is it possible to enable a tap indicator, like a small circle, for touch events so users can easily spot where the author tapped?  \n\nA: If you want to demo your own applications (i.e. where you have the actual source code and can make a special demo build), then the best way is to add a helper to your Xcode project, such as https://github.com/toddreed/Touchpose or https://github.com/mapbox/Fingertips. Both overlay your touches with a (customizable) fingerprint indicator when connected to an external mirror (such as when using AirPlay or Quicktime to record).\n\nA: The touch events don't get captured on iOS 9 and lower, so you'll need to either set up a camera to capture the taps and present that side by side with the detailed capture or use it to overlay the taps in post production.\nThis is such a great idea, that I've filed a bug report to officially ask Apple to support this. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://openradar.appspot.com/22538143\n\nA: defaults write com.apple.iphonesimulator ShowSingleTouches 1\n\n\n\nHow did I find this setting?\nHidden options can be found by running the command below and then, well, figuring out what they do.

When I create a new desktop it has all the same crud on it that my original desktop has on it. \nHow do I create a new desktop that's empty, and use that as a new work area... like a new desktop?\n\nThe source of my confusion is that they're named \"DESKTOPS\", and given unique numbers, yet they completely fail to follow the ideas of their own metaphor:\n\nDesktop 1 is exactly the same as Desktop 2, only it's got the possibility of having different app windows in it. That's not a new desktop. It's the same desktop. \n\nA: @Confused I too had the same issue. I wanted different desktops for different projects. So, I made an Python/Applescript app which allows you to have multiple desktops in the \"true sense\" that you refer to:\nhttp://www.shirt-ediss.me/clarity/\nIt should serve your purpose, but please see the \"Tips\" sections for caveats with my approach. It works simply by moving files and folders from the Desktop to a storage folder, and recording their icon positions. This means that this desktop can be restored to exactly the same state later. There is still only one Desktop/ folder on the Mac, and Mission Control works just as it did before.\nI now have about 20 different desktops and switch between them all of the time - great for productivity.\n\nA: Here's an easy shell script I wrote to implement multiple desktops (tested on High Sierra and Mojave). It does require root permissions to initially configure and works nicely when mapped to \"hot keys\" using Automator.\nThe only downside I've found is that you'll have to create an alias on the Finder sidebar to the folder containing the desktops, since the old \"Desktop\" Finder alias will only point to desktop1.\n#!/bin/bash\n  \n# chdt - Trivial script for multiple Deskops a la X-Windows for MacOS\n#        (smoke and mirrors using rm and ln -s)\n#\n# Jeff Bloomfield - 2/23/2021\n# jeffb@LMI.net\n\n#\n# Setup Instructions:\n# 1.

On a second monitor, the desktop will not be replicated from the first but again it will be repeated for all of its assigned desktops or spaces. Desktops are primarily useful for organizing apps and windows—not file system objects.\nWhile I'm sure you have an intuitive understanding of how your proposal would work for 95% of your use case, I think there are a number of edge cases that would lead to very unpredictable behavior for many, many users (possibly even yourself).\n", "Q: Question on calendar and ICS file I receive emails with ICS files. \nWhen I double click on them, the event is created successfully in my calendar but many times it chooses things like \"family room\" as the calendar.\nI don't want this.

Is there a way to record two at the same time? I would like to capture the swing from behind and directly across (we both have iPhone's).\nThanks\n\nA: It can be done, yes. However, it's somewhat involved.\nOne way would be start filming on both iPhones and then play a high-pitched sound of some kind. Then, later, you can use video editing software like Adobe Premiere, or Final Cut Pro (or even iMove, I suppose) to visually sync up the videos by looking at the audio tracks of both videos and aligning them up visually by looking at the sound spike created by the high-pitched sound played during recording.\nThis is kind of like what video professionals do when working with multi-camera setups. Not exactly easy. But technically possible, if you know how to do video editing.\n", "Q: Open application several times in OS X I am developing OS X version of multi-platform application.

I've gotten to the part where Windows setup asks for the bootcamp drivers, before Windows is installed (\"Collecting information\"). I've tried having the bootcamp drivers on both a usb 2.0 and a usb 3.0 external hard drive, and I still get the following error:\n\"No device drivers were found. Make sure that the installation media contains the correct drivers, and then click ok\"\nI've digged a bit and found that the issue is a USB 3.0 issue, according to many. All the iMac USB's are 3.0, so what is the solution here ? I don't have an SD card or a thunderbolt drive.\n\nA: Actually if you look on Apples website they have updated about bootcamp 6.0.1 on El Capitan.  All 2015 models do not need a USB stick to put Windows 10 ISO in.  All 2015 Mac models from Macbook, Air, Pro, Mac Pro, and iMac do not need USB with Windows 10 ISO.  You can simply download Windows 10 ISO file, put it on desktop, open bootcamp.  Apple website says that all 2015 Macs have the install Mac bootcamp uploader files for Windows within a private partition that uploads after installing Windows and gets to start menu desktop.  If you want to read more of what I just told go to https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468  It states right on there that 2015 Macs do not need USB for Windows 10 install on bootcamp anymore.\n", "Q: How do I access an SMB Share being hosted on a Mac running OS X?

I cannot reinstall OSX currently (no media for it).\nThe Mac in question is an iMac so I cannot easily take out the hard drive.\n\nA: Did you try...\nInternet Recovery ?\nbefore resorting to\nTarget Disk Mode or\nHow to install OS X on an external drive connected to your Mac  or\nCreate a bootable installer for OS X Mavericks or Yosemite\n- which, as already mentioned, needs another Mac\n\nA: The best thing is to have a bootable backup of your iMac drive, such as one created by Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper. You do have one of those, right? \nA Mac can be started via a USB port, as a USB key or drive, but that device needs to have Mac OSX on it to boot, as well as other requirements. Best bet is to always backup your iMac hard drive with a bootable image created by those two tools mentioned above. For more info on usb boot, see:  \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201663\nIf  you don't have a bootable backup, or a way to get a Mac drive, things get very complicated.   \nFirst, try to boot your iMac in Recovery mode, holding down Cmd-r on restart. If that doesn't work, try for Internet Recovery, which is restart and hold down Cmd-Opt-R.  \nIf neither of those work, find another Mac, connect it to the iMac with Firewire or Thunderbolt cable. Then reboot the iMac holding down the 't' key, which puts it in Target Disk Mode. If this works, the iMac hard drive will appear as a mounted drive on the other Mac.\nIf none of those work, you are going to need to take the drive out of the iMac, so be sure to read thru the iFixit guides.\n\nA: You can do it, but you'll need access to a working Mac to create a bootable USB drive. Apple's instructions for doing so in Mavericks or Yosemite are here.\n\nA: It might be possible to do this transfer if you start up Internet Recovery, but at that point, you might as well reinstall OS X.\n\nOS X Recovery includes a built in set of utilities as part of the\n  Recovery System.

I cleaned it up and everything works except the fact that it no longer has a serial number. When I go to look at System Information, it says \"Serial Number: Unavailable.\" I've tried re-flashing the serial using Apple's Blank Board Serializer tool, which didn't work. I think that the place where the serial is physically stored on the board is somehow broken.\nSo is there any way to \"spoof\" a serial number so that FaceTime and iMessage work correctly? I've been looking at trying to set boot arguments, or change kernel extensions, or something. \nWhere in the boot sequence does the OS look for the board's serial number, and how can I change that? It seems to be stored in the NVRAM, but I can't access it.\n\nA: AFAIK, there is no way to clear a serial intentionally or by accident. The only way to get a blank system serial number is when the logic board is replaced. Replacement MLB only comes with a part serial number but it does not have a system serial number. I assume that you took your laptop to have it repaired?\nWhen a new logic board is replaced by Apple or an Apple Certified Service Provider, the logic board needs to be serialized after the repair. Normally an ACMT doing the repair will run basic MRI test after the repair which will then be identified as a blank board thus allowing the ACMT to add a serial number to the board prior to running the test.\nYou can go back to the repair shop and they will most likely correct the sloppy error of forgetting to add the serial number. If that option is not available then you can try going to the closest Apple store but the only way they will help you is if Apple or an Apple store branch did the repair or an ACSP/ACMT did the repair.\n\nA: Take a look at this , AST_BBS only for blank serial number it not will change your seria number use ISO image to pendrive boot \nhttps://www.elektroda.pl/rtvforum/viewtopic.php?t=3327853&view=next\n", "Q: Recovery my Apple Id I have forgotten my Apple Id but i know my password.And my phone need to be activated but the apple id was made mistakenly.Is there any possibility to know my Apple Id?\n\nA: On https://iforgot.apple.com, there is an option/link to follow in case you have forgotten your Apple ID.

In order to use a mouse on an iPad at all, you would probably need to jailbreak it. \n\nA: The design of iOS makes remote control not possible in the manner of KVM/remote pointer control.\nThere is no concept of pointer in iOS since the touch interface is multi-touch from the get go.\nYou could enable switch control or voiceover control and theoretically interface with that over the supported or non-supported (jailbreak) channel, but it's still not a true mouse pointer idiom.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/ios/accessibility-tips/\nThere's tons of software on OS X for remote control of other devices, but you'd need to be more specific to let us help you.

I just hit a nasty bug in Calendar.app and Reminders.app on Yosemite.\nFor some reason, calendars also appear in Reminders.app as empty reminder lists and reminder lists also appear in Calendar.app as empty Calendars. Even if I delete all of my calendars and reminder lists (I've got them all backed up), they get created back again.\nI've noticed both calendars and reminders get stored under ~/Library/Calendars. I've been trying a lot of things to fix this up. As suggested in other articles I've tried deleting these files:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iCal (didn't exist)\n\n*~/Library/Calendars/Calendar Cache*\n\n*~/Library/Containers/com.apple.CalendarAgent/\n\n*~/Library/Containers/com.apple.CalendarAgent.CalNCService/\n\n*~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iCal/\n\n*~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iCal.CalendarNC/\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.plist\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCalExternalSync.plist\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.helper.plist (didn't exist)\n\n\nI've also tried deleting the whole ~/Library/Calendars directory and I've restarted my mac many times during this whole process.\nYet every time I go back to Calendar.app or Reminders.app, the buggy calendars and reminder lists keep creeping back again.\nI don't know what to do anymore now... any suggestions would be welcome!\nEdit: I seem to have reached a state of sanity out of this mess... at last!\nSearching up the ~/Library/ directory, I found what appears to be the culprit causing me this problem. There is a file that's being generated by some sync services from Apple located at ~/Library/Application\\ Support/SyncServices/Local/TFSM/com.apple.Calendars/data.syncdb. I'm not sure what process is updating this, but I'm using iTunes to sync local calendars to my iPhone and I suspect it probably has something to do with this. So perhaps the bug is not in Calendar/Reminders but really in iTunes or the SyncServices.\nSo I've deleted that file as well as all files under ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.CalendarAgent/Data/Library/Calendars/ and restarted OS X. When I opened Calendar.app, the calendars one should get by default on a new user account were there: Home and Work, and in my case Birthdays and Holidays too. Reminders.app also showed an empty Reminders list, which is fine too. So then I proceeded to restore my calendars and reminders from my backups.\nSynchronization in iTunes is now OK, but the reminder lists still shows up as calendars for some reason (seems like a bug here too). If I manually select calendars from Calendar.app, everything seems to work just fine.\nMy last resort would have been to move all my stuff to a new user account (assuming the problem was due to a buggy state with my current user account - as suggested by bmike), but luckily I don't have to do that tedious task, at least for now.\nUsing OS X 10.10.5 and iTunes 12.2.2.25.\n\nA: I would say, you're off the wrong foot deleting files in ~/Library since the storage there changes from version to version (and sometimes even build to build).\nIf I have AppleCare - I just call them and they have internal documents and the ability to get you the exact steps for your exact situation.\nIf I don't want to call Apple or I have time to work on the issue - Here's the strategy I've employed to clean things out when iCloud is messed up. It takes me far less time to do it this way. :-)\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new account on your Mac\n\n*Log into iCloud.com and check if the cloud \"truth\" is correct.\n\n*If it is, sync one bucket of data to the new account. (Calendars)\n\n*If it's correct, turn that bucket off and let it delete all the local data if it prompts you.\n\n*Repeat the \"sync one bucket\" until you've checked all the buckets you wish to be correct.\n\n\nIf there were issues syncing one bucket - contact Apple Support or install a new OS and re-test on the new OS.\nIf there are no issues - then turn on all of the buckets in the new account to verify things are OK.\nAt that point, you know these things:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud has good data\n\n*Your Mac has good software\n\n*The settings you want will work\n\n\nAt that point, you can make a decision to migrate the user from the broken user (it might be broken from you deleting things or a bug or just bad luck - but it's clearly broken).\nIf you really want to clear things out, it would be best to just ask separately. The steps to clear Calendar are not the same as clearing Reminders.\nAlso keep in mind - other devices can inject data into the cloud - you might have to isolate the problematic Mac and the Cloud data in some cases.\n", "Q: Will the App Store reviewers allow scripts downloaded as text, if it is parsed via WebKit?

Ideally as a brew <arg> command before installing, but even a shell script I could use post-install would help. \nI thought I might be able to figure this info out with a brew link --dry-run <formula>, but that typically just gives me a warning that the formula is already linked (even with --overwrite or --force added to the command). I don't want to have to unlink each time I want to see the commands, so this route doesn't seem helpful. \n\nA: I wrote Homebrew-command-not-found to do the reverse thing: get a formula from an executable. There isn’t any easy way to get a formula’s executables as other answers pointed out; so I installed all Homebrew formulae and recorded all executables in one file.\nYou can find it here. Each formula has its own line with the following format:\n<name>: <executable-1> <executable-2> <...>\n\nIt’s as easy as grep ^git: executables.txt to get the executables installed by the git formula.\nThe file is regularly updated and covers 17k+ commands for 5k+ core formulae.\n\nA: As bmike's answer points out, aside from digging through the projects source to determine what executables they install, there's no good way to determine what commands come with a given formula before installing it.\nAfter a formula is installed, running\nbrew unlink --dry-run formula | grep \"$(brew --prefix)/bin\"\n\nis a workable option now that --dry-run is available for brew unlink. \nBefore that was added I wrote an external command called brew executables that still has some benefits over the above (mainly in formatting and handling some links a bit differently). I'll include a simplified (and probably non-working, due to missing some variable assignments) version of it here:\nversion_in_use=$(echo \"$brew_info\" | grep \"$HOMEBREW_PREFIX.*\\*$\" | sed -e \"s|.*$formula/\\([^ ]*\\).*|\\1|i\")\n\ncd \"$HOMEBREW_CELLAR/$formula/$version_in_use\" \nfor dir in `find . -type d -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -name \"bin\"`; do\n    for file in `find \"$dir\" -type f -o -type l -perm +111`\n    do\n            filename=$(basename $file)\n            echo $filename\n    done        \ndone\n\nIn short, it pulls the list of executables out of $(brew --prefix)/$formula/$version_in_use/bin. The version on my GitHub is a bit more fleshed out, including some added ability to identify/indicate when there are commands that link to each other in this bin directory.\n\nA: I think the accepted answer is not (or is no longer) correct, precisely.\nWhile it's true Homebrew lacks the general feature you're asking for, there's at least one tap with at least two methods of using it:\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-command-not-found\nHere's what I do! Method 1:\n> brew tap homebrew/command-not-found\n> brew which-formula when\nwhen\n> brew install when\n> when\n...\nFri 2022 May 27   4:40\n\nMethod 2: eval \"$(brew command-not-found-init)\" # in ~/.{ba,z}shrc\nN.B. There may be some significant slow-down to shells with this 2nd method.\nFor that reason, I enjoy using brew which-formula (method 1) when necessary.\n\nA: In general - no.\nHomebrew doesn't install package receipts which is the manner in which current tools decide what is installed where in an exhaustive and correct fashion.\nSometimes you can use brew list to check things, but I've found the best way to check on homebrew is via github - which publishes the source code for all the tools and all the packages.\nMy favorite search engine, Duck Duck Go even has ! commands to make it easy to search github:\n\n!gh homebrew\nlua\n\nGoogle does a decent job as well ranking homebrew fairly high as well as github\n\n!g homebrew\nlua\n\nAlso, brew info and brew home often give you a direct link to the project source to check if your suspicions are correct. As you surmise, the real check is to uninstall / reinstall and watch.

Right now I'm in cut and paste mode. \n\nA: Although you could script this in AppleScript since Pages is scriptable, I've never had enough sections to make the time spent crafting a script worth the time needed to figure out the syntax.\nI simply duplicate the document as many times as needed in finder, batch rename them using Finder.\nIf you had 64 sections, I would use a \"binary search\" approach.\n\n\n*\n\n*split the document in 2\n\n*split in 4\n\n*split by 8\n\n*split by half\n\n\nI've never liked copy/paste since things get odd sometimes.

There is no scrolling bar at the right of screen.  How can I activate this?\n\nA: System Preferences → General → Show scroll bars: Always\n\nA: When using a mouse OSX hides scrollbars  by default. They appear only when you use the wheel motion. Once you are scrolling you will be able to see the scrollbars and they will be hidden momentarily once you stop scrolling.

I would ideally like a bookmarklet since then I could use it on iOS as well.

Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any existing bookmarklet solution that takes a location highlighted in maps.google.com and opens it in OS X/iOS Maps (nor were my attempts at finding something fruitful). \nIt's an interesting idea and I'm guessing possibly feasible given that a given location's coordinates are in the maps.google.com URL - if I was up on Javascript, I'd take a crack at it.

Find Mountain Lion? Post-Stroke Explanations, Please I hope you can help me. I had modest tech abilities until 6 months ago, when I had a stroke. I don't know now what these abbreviations mean. I have read the answers but they don't seem to apply.\nMy mini got a new hard drive last November with Mountain Lion installed. I think I wanted to upgrade to Mavericks but somehow got Yosemite instead, which is awful and messes with everything. Can I get rid of it without losing everything? I don't have anymore an external hard drive, or something else I can't recall. Thank you.\n\nA: Sorry to hear about your stroke. To answer your question, downgrading operating system installs are pretty tricky. This is further complicated by Apple's switch to exclusively distribute OS X via the App Store - if you don't already have access to the Mavericks installer, you're out of luck given that you can't even get the installer on the App Store anymore.\nIf you do have access to the Mavericks installer, you'll need to back up your documents somewhere as you will need to completely erase the hard drive in your Mini before installing Mavericks. If you use Time Machine to backup, this could be an option - but I couldn't be certain as I've never downgraded from Yosemite to Mavericks and I know that Time Machine backs up the OS as well, so there could be some issues involved.\nOnce that's done, you can then bring over your documents and reconfigure your apps (if you have iCloud and sync your Apple app settings, that should be effortless - but I can't confirm as, again, I've never done the downgrade).\nIf this sounds like a royal pain in the butt … you're right. Yosemite is a pretty big change from OS X, but if you can stand to stick with it that will probably be your best option.\n", "Q: Apple keyboard on Windows PC: will CMD buttons work as CTRL?

See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202676 section \"How Microsoft Windows Function keys are mapped to Apple keyboards\".\n\nA: I am 95% certain the answer is NO, but I do not have a Windows PC to verify.\n\nA: The answer is no. The difference is not a Mac vs Win keyboard. You can use a Windows keyboard on a Mac and the keys are the same.\nThe difference in in the OS. Windows treats ctrl-C as copy and OS X cmd-C.

So, you wouldn't want to block port 443, which is HTTPS, or encrypted. But, if you really wish \"any other unencrypted protocol\" to be blocked, you're going to have to block just about all outgoing traffic. In Little Snitch, you could set up two rules: \"block all outgoing traffic\", and \"allow outgoing port 443 traffic\"; the more specific rule would override the more general rule.

In Numbers, I would like to create a column with automatically generated cells to create a timetable with each hour and each half hour.\nI create a new document, type in \"7:30 AM\" and then in the cell below I type in \"8:00 AM\" then I drag downwards from the first cell, but it doesn't work, it replaces \"8:00 AM\" by \"8:30 AM\" but I only want 30 mns increments...\n\nI tried changing the cell format to \"date and time\" but it just erases whatever I typed and replaces it by today's date and time or random dates and times...\n\n\n\n\nA: The formula syntax in Numbers is actually less intuitive and more stubborn than Excel IMO. Nevertheless, to create time intervals:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the first cell, say B2, type 8:00 AM\n\n*In the following cell, type =B2+\"30m\"\n\n\n*Now, drag down:\n\n\n*Voilà:\n\n\nA: In addition to njboot's answer, If you wish to drag and apply the ½ hour increments without entering a formula,  be sure to select Both cells before dragging down the yellow dot.  This will copy the pattern down (or across, for that matter.)\n\n\n\nEdit:\nIf you want to use a formula:\nUse Duration:\nDURATION(weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) \nUsing Duration one can then adjust the increments later on affecting all cells with one simple change.  For example, suppose you wish to change it to 15 minute increments or 2 hour or 25 minutes.  This can be accomplished using a dynamic formula to allow for greater flexibility in your solution.\nOne could add a new table (or use hidden cells or whatever tickles one's fancy) to create an area where a number can be added that will change the increments universally.\nCreate Duration formula:\n\nNotice that Hours and Minutes are tied to cells that can be adjusted without changing the formula.\n\nThen, after dragging down the formula, just change the increments when desired.\n\n\n", "Q: What character is this possessive apostrophe: ’ In a recent answer I needed to include a a possessive apostrophe in a path name within Time Machine for a command line operation.

A new unstable resource-draining Adobe process that has recently appeared on my Mac is proving more difficult to hunt down and kill than the numerous other processes that Adobe creates. Generally following instructions here and elsewhere to disable the launching of these processes has worked, but I can't seem to figure out how to disable the latest: AdobeIPCBroker.\nI've found instructions for Windows, but none for OS X. \nHow do I get rid of and permanently disable AdobeIPCBroker on OS X?\n\nA: I did a Finder search for \"adobeipcbroker\" and dragged all three folders and app to the Trash, then emptied it, which worked fine for me on El Capitan.\n\nA: This is what I had to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kill Core Sync.\n\n*Kill CCLibrary.\n\n*Kill CCXProcess.\n\n*Kill AdobeIPCBroker.\n\n\nI don't know if they'll come back the next time I reboot, but in an attempt to prevent that I also disabled the \"Launch Agents\" in com.adobe.AAM.Updater-1.0.plist and com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud.plist.\n(Who in Adobe thought it was a good idea to spend CPU and battery life constantly just to check for updates or things to 'sync'? That's like kids going around trick or treating all year just to be sure they don't miss Halloween. There are smarter ways to schedule things.)\n\nA: This is what Adobe support say \n- \"You need to close all adobe applications when not in use from the activity monitor at last close adobe IPC monitor.\"\n- \"We suggest to consumer close all adobe applications then close adobe IPC broker.

However, Pages does not seem to support custom keyboard layouts other than the system's Hebrew layout(s). I am using Shoshke's Yiddish Kayboard Layout for mac (I don't have enought \"reputation\" to post the link here, but it is actually not that important) on Yosemite, by the way, which allows me to type Yiddish with punctuation extremely effeciently.\nWhen writing in Pages using the system's native Hebrew layout, this is what I get:\n\nHowever, when writing with my custom Yiddish keyboard (which was most probably created using Ukelele), I get this:\n\nAs you can see, the period is on the right, while it should be on the left (at the end of the sentence). This is just an obvious example, but when mixing Yiddish and English in the same sentence the result is even worse.\nUnfortunately, Pages' paragraph direction controls do not solve the problem. Pages obviously recognizes the input language and implements the right-to-left correcly only for languages it recognizes from the system's native keyboard layouts (e.g. \"Hebrew\").\nWriting Yiddish with the native Hebrew keyboard is possible, but is much much slower for me. Therefore, I am looking for a way to still use the Yiddish keyboard in Pages, which seems very stable and rebust in comparison to other available word processors (not to mention that it was shipped for free with my new mac).\nI see 4 ways to go about it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Editing the native Hebrew keyboard layout, adapting it to my needs (so far I could only find information about creating new custom keyboard layouts, not about changing the system's existing ones; this solution would actually be the best one - as there is absolutely no advanatge of the Hebrew native keyboard over the Yiddish one).\n\n*Somehow making Yosemite believe that my custom Yiddish keyboard is a sort of \"Hebrew\" (currently it puts it under \"Others\" when installing it from the Keyboard preference pane, which explains why Pages does not identify it as an RTL language).\n\n*Somehow making Pages believe that my Yiddish keyboard is a sort of \"Hebrew\".\n\n*Programming keyboard-shortcuts for Pages that would immitate the custom keyboard's behaviour (so far I was only able to find ways to program keyboard-shortcuts for the app's menu items; maybe there is a third-party application that can program such shortcuts?)\n\n\nI looked for answers online and tried to open the package contents of the Pages app and was just unable to discover how to achieve any of the four solutions... I would truly appreciate if anyone could help me out (and maybe there is another solution?)\nThank you very much!\n\nA: Pages 5 does have paragraph direction controls. See\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH15331\nRegarding 4, you can make text replacement sequences in system prefs/keyboard/text\nRegarding 1 and 2, you might ask in the group devoted to Ukelele\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ukelele-users\nIn that group they suggested opening the layout with the latest version of Ukelele and setting the Language to Hebrew.  I tried that and saved as a bundle and it did the trick:  The layout appears under Hebrew instead of Others and periods go in the right place.\n\nA: I was able to solve this problem with Ukelele. The said keyboard layout was created with a previous version of Ukelele. Opening the .keylayout file with the newest version (3.0b2) was possible, but it was not possible to access the language setting (through \"Keyboard -> Set Keyboard Language...\"). Instead, I switched to my Yiddish custom keyboard and then, in Ukelele, \"File -> New From Current Input Source.\" I could then change the language settings to Hebrew (note that you should only change where it says \"Language (required)\", and certainly not \"Script (optional)\". doing that mysteriously prevents the system from classifying the keyboard layout under \"Hebrew\", and puts it instead in \"Others\"). I could then save the keyboard layout as a .bundle package, move it to Library/Keyboard Layouts, and add it through \"System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources -> +\". This it, it appeared under \"Hebrew\", and not under \"Others\". After a system restart, Pages is now able to treat my updated Yiddish keyboard layout as if it were Hebrew, that is with correct right-to-left functionality!\nThank you Tom for referring me the Ukelele Google Group. They were able to put me on the right track!\n", "Q: Download Teach Tracks to iTunes I downloaded Teach Tracks to learn songs and I like to add them to playlists.  How do I add these to my Apple Music cloud library so that I can then add them to playlists in iTunes?\n\nA: Assuming your 'teach tracks' are DRM free and not buy from iTunes you could add them to iTunes as long as their fileformat is compatible with iTunes. You don't need an Apple Cloud Library to create playlists, just create a playlist with these songs inside itunes. You can then transfer the songs and the playlist to an iPhone/iPod just by connecting it to your computer.\nIf you still want your songs in iCloud you must subscribe to iTunes Match from apple.

I have to unplug the external monitor, turn on the computer and then plug it in for them both to work at the same time. Do you guys have any ideas how to set it up permanently?\n\nA: OS X remembers the configuration for each individual external device you plug in and should restore the last setup.\nYou should get an extra icon in the top menu bar when you have an external display plugged in, and clicking on this will give you the options to rearrange the displays and choose which are on. \nIt may be that you are booting up into 'closed screen' mode (see this Apple support article).\nYou don't say which version of OS X you are using.

The iMac also doesn't seem to respond to the keyboard at all.\nI should note that this happens very infrequently - perhaps once or twice a month.

Is there an equivalent way to\nlaunch the activity monitor, for example?\n\n\nA: I had this problem as well, it turns out that migrating from a prior version was the problem, specifically kernel extensions that used to worked now \"sorta\" worked until they didn't.\nUsing Lingon (see the Apple Store), it was possible turn on and off various services to locate the problematic one(s).  Using Onyx it was possible to clear out the kernel caches.\nFor me it was some historic SnapZPro extensions that needed updating.\n\nA: My imac did the same thing, but I assumed that it might have something to do with  the fans. so I opened it up, and used an air hose from my compressor to clean the fans... they were completely covered in dust. This was causing them to run slow and not run at all. after this I put the imac back together... good as new.

I hope your fix is as simple as mine.\n\nA: What you don't say is how long your Mac works before exhibiting this behavior. That might help.\nWhat I would do is boot into safe mode (hold Shift at startup until you see the Apple logo) And see if the system still freezes up. If it does then it is likely that something you have installed is causing the freeze up. The fun part is then turning off startup items one or two at a time and booting normally till you find the culprit..\nif it is the same in safe mode then the OS is likely damaged or you have a hardware failure of some sort. At that point I would back up your drive, wipe it and install the OS fresh.

I have an iPad Mini running iOS 6.0.1.\nI want to install iOS 7 instead of 8.\nIs ther a way to do it?\nThe iTunes update shows update to iOS 8.4.\n\nA: No, you can't do that. Apple only allows users to update to the latest software, as it fights version fragmentation. I recommend just updating to iOS 8.4.1. For the most part, whatever bugs existed in iOS 8 are fixed by now. You could also just wait until iOS 9 comes out in a couple of weeks, bug fixes and performance enhancements will be a major part of iOS 9.\nThis all is an effect of \"code signing\" where you need Apple to sign the version of code at the moment it gets installed. Since Apple no longer signs iOS 7 on that device, you would need to jailbreak or bypass that entire process.\nUnless you're into the details of Jailbreaking you can stay at iOS 6 or upgrade to the versions Apple supports/signs.\nI strongly recommend against jailbreaking, though.\n", "Q: Running a script as root and presenting a GUI to logging in users I am having a programming decision problem and hope, that you can show me a solution or tell me, if my plan on how to solve the problem would be okay or not. \nI am managing some macs and want to run a script every time a user logs in. The script (which I haven't written yet) needs to make some changes (or not). The changes need administrator privileges but the script also needs information from the currently logged in (or logging in) user. \nNormaly, this would be a job for a LaunchAgent / Deamon, but here comes the problem: Scripts in /LaunchDeamons run as system administrator but start together with the system. They are not aware of users loging in or out and they may not show a GUI. ~/LaunchAgents run as the logged in user and get started when the user logs in. Also they may show a GUI. However they do not run as system administrator.\nSo this is my problem: running a script as root, but starting it whenever a user logs in and present a GUI to him: My solution would be to write two scripts: \nScript 1 runs as system administrator and lies in /LaunchDeamons. This would have a Socket open for incomming connections (AKA \"Server Socket\"). \nScript 2 runs as the user beeing logged in and lies in ~/LaunchAgents. It presents a GUI to the user and sends the information to script 1 via a socket connection. \nIt doesn't seem to me as this would be the most reliable / straight forward solution, but I can't think of anything else. I also tried to find out how other programs solve this problem (munki for example, which presents a GUI to the user but installs programs as system administrator) but couldn't figure out how they did it. \nI'd be happy for some comments on this! \nRegards, Christian \nPS: I plan to use python.\n\nA: Sockets - Involved but Tried and Tested\nYour solution of two scripts talking through a socket is the tried and tested approach. We did this for Power Manager and it has worked reliably from OS X 10.3 – 10.11.\nYou can use a tcp or unix domain socket for this purpose.\nIn our situation, the daemon pmd runs as a computer wide process and the user session daemon pmuser runs once per user. They talk to share information that a computer wide daemon can not safely obtain and to perform actions within specific user sessions.\nThe computer wide daemon can detect when a user logs in. This is done through the SystemConfiguration API SCDynamicStoreKeyCreateConsoleUser.\nThe graphical script must be launched within the graphical user session; a launchd job in /Library/LaunchDaemons with the key value pair LimitLoadToSessionType: Aqua set will ensure this.\nDepending on the information you need to gather from the user, I expect what you want to achieve is possible with Power Manager; feel free to get in touch.\nlaunchctl's bsexec\nRecent versions of OS X include a launchctl that promises what you need: the ability to launch a process within a user session. See How to launch a GUI application in another user's graphical session? for the details and likely problems you will encounter.\nIf you are deploying on OS X 10.10 and later, investigate launchd's new domain capabilities. A complete rewrite in OS X 10.10 opened up many as yet not completely documented options. The launchd mailing list is a treasure trove of information.\n", "Q: How to handle bundle identifiers with spaces? Lets assume my current directory is /Applications and it contains all my apps. Lets say I want to know the bundle identifier for Google Chrome:\n$ mdls -raw -name kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier 'Google Chrome.app'\ncom.google.Chrome\n\nNow let’s use that to locate the app:\n$ mdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier = com.google.Chrome\n/Applications/Google Chrome.app\n\nNow lets try the same for Tor Browser Bundle. First, get the bundle identifier:\n$ mdls -raw -name kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier TorBrowser.app\norg.mozilla.tor browser\n\nThen, locate the app:\n$ mdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier = org.mozilla.tor browser\n\nNothing. I likely need to quote it:\n$ mdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier = 'org.mozilla.tor browser'\n\nNope, still nothing. Lets try something else:\n$ mdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier = 'org.mozilla.tor'\n$ mdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier = \"org.mozilla.tor browser\"\n$ mdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier = org.mozilla.tor\\ browser\n$ mdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier = \"org.mozilla.tor\\ browser\"\n$ mdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier = 'org.mozilla.tor%20browser'\n$ mdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier = 'org.mozilla.tor+browser'\n$ mdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier = 'org.mozilla.tor_browser'\n\nNothing works. This is the only app I ever had this issue with, and the only one I ever saw with a space in its bundle identifier. How can we reference it?\n\nA: A proper bundle identifier should not have a space in it. According to Apple's App Distribution Guide -> About Bundle IDs, a\n\n\"...bundle ID string must be a uniform type identifier (UTI) that contains\n  only alphanumeric characters (A-Z,a-z,0-9), hyphen (-), and period\n  (.). The string should be in reverse-DNS format. For example, if your\n  organization’s domain is Acme.com and you create an app named Hello,\n  you could assign the string com.Acme.Hello as your app’s bundle ID.\n\nSo, technically, org.mozilla.tor browser is not a valid bundle identifier, so you'll get unexpected results when trying to work with it. It should likely be changed (by the developer) to something like org.mozilla.tor.browser or org.mozilla.tor-browser, etc.\n", "Q: Disable iCloud Photo Library on Mac I have been using iCloud Photo Library on my Mac for several months but I'm wanting to quit using it now.  If I go in and try to turn it off, I get a message that all my photos will be deleted from my Mac but the full resolution originals will still be available in iCloud for 30 days.  I have already downloaded my photos from iCloud into a download folder on my Mac so that I can import them into Photos.  \nMy main concern with disabling is: First off, will all my photos be deleted from my Mac right away?  If all my photos are removed, will that also remove all my albums in Photos?  Or will my photos be removed but when I import the downloaded photos from iCloud, will the Albums reappear?  I do not want to have to go back and recreate all new albums with the pictures I've chosen to put into those albums.\nI found the following article about safely disabling the iCloud library, but it doesn't address the warning that I get when I want to turn it off.  \nhttp://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/how-to-disable-icloud-photo-library-reclaim-storage\n\nA: When you disable iCloud Photo Library, it will not delete any full resolution photos that are already on your computer. The issue is that your entire photo library has not yet been downloaded. You need to disable Optimization to force iCloud Photo Library to download the rest of the library.\nWhat it will delete are thumbnails that have no corresponding image yet. For example, if it hasn't downloaded an image, it will discard the thumbnail (because there is no corresponding image). If you are receiving the message than that means that something hasn't yet had a chance to download. If your library is small enough, the simplest thing to do is simply look at each photo at full resolution, with Optimization of Storage off. This will force each one to download.\n", "Q: Console.app needs color themes Black text on white background hurts the eyes while perusing logs in Console.app.\nThere used to be some hacks like this to change the colors of the display in Console.app. But those hacks apparently no longer work in current versions such as Yosemite.\nAny current ways to change Console colors in Mountain Lion or Yosemite?\n\nA: Try decompiling first, then editing this NIB file.\n/Applications/Utilities/Console.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/LogWindow.nib\n\nA: You can send feedback to Apple: apple.com/feedback\n", "Q: Can I download Mac OS X for a used MacBook Pro? I want to by a used MacBook Pro i5 Mid 2010 edition, but there is no system DVD. The previous owner's stuff is on the hard drive, and I want to wipe it clean with a new OS. Can I boot into existing Mac OS and download an ISO of the latest Mac OS X or do I have to buy a install disk from Apple?\n\nA: It depends. \nIf it's running Mac OS X 10.5.8 \"Leopard\" or earlier, then you must buy a Snow Leopard Install DVD from Apple (or barrow it from a fiend). You could also buy Lion , but it's the same price, $20 USD. Though, Snow Leopard comes through the mail and Lion is sent as a verification code through email.\nIf it's running Mac OS X 10.6 \"Snow Leopard\" to Mac OS X 10.6.7 \"Snow Leopard\", then you will need to do an Apple Software Update, to update it to 10.6.8. Click the Apple logo in the top left of the desktop, then select Software Update.\nIf it's running OS X 10.6.8 \"Snow Leopard\", then you will have to update it through the Mac App Store. OS X 10.10 \"Yosemite\" runs amazingly on my 2009 MacBook Pro, so I'd strongly recommend updating to Yosemite (for free) no matter what you do, don't let anyone tell you it doesn't run well on older hardware, it's fine.\nIf it's currently running OS X 10.7 \"Lion\" or later, then yes. Just boot into Recovery Mode by holding the Option key down at startup. Two images of hard drives will appear, use the arrow keys to select Recovery, press the Enter key to make your selection. Once in Recovery, select Disk Utility and select the hard drive. Then select Erase from the bar and select Erase in the bottom right. After its erased, go back to the main window in Recovery and select Reinstall OS X, then just follow the onscreen instructions. Make sure to update to Yosemite using the Mac App Store afterwards.\n\nA: Hold down Option/Alt key when booting, this should get you into the boot menu.\nIf you can see a recovery boot option, you can format the HDD partition using Disk Utility in that and use the same software to do a fresh install.\nIt will download the latest version of whatever OS X release the computer currently runs. \n", "Q: How to restore/re-create some folders from Time Machine backup of a different computer?

I bought some iBooks, only to later find out that these can't be opened on other platforms. \nNow, I want to buy some music, and I wonder where I should buy it from. I may buy from iTunes, if it allows me to transfer and play songs on other platforms at a future date.\nI usually just buy content from Amazon, at least with Kindle, they allow you to enjoy your content across various platforms. So, I also wanted to know if it is possible to buy songs from Amazon and play them on iPhone from iPhone's music app. I downloaded Amazon's music app, but it does not have any songs. I know that's weird, but the search didn't show any of the songs I searched for, and they were all popular songs.\nSo, really, given that I want to platform-proof my musical content, and yet play it on the iphone, where it should I purchase it from?\n\nA: iTunes is surely the most complete music online catalog for buying songs. Musics purchased from iTunes are linked to your iTunes account and can be re-download as long as you have access to your account on authorized device (iDevices or computers). Moreover from iTunes on a PC or Mac you can create an aac version of your track that remove your email address from the metadata of the track, the songs created this way can be transfered to other aac compatible devices.\nOne of the iTunes drawbacks is song quality : max 256kb/s, it's good for most people but not audiophile-proof.\n", "Q: Bought iPad from eBay locked to iCloud I've a just bought a iPad from eBay.

I also tried to manually mount Time Capsule using Terminal and mount or mount_afp but nothing changed.  \nThis is the new setup of my home LAN:\n\nAll the connections are made using Gigabit Ethernet and Cat5e/Cat6 cables.\nSince I connected my MBP and my Windows PC using Ethernet, the Time Capsule is not mounted properly anymore. But if I turn on AirPort and connect to the WiFi network, my Time Capsule works very well.\nThe only workaround I figured out is that I need to connect the switch directly to the Time Capsule, instead of the Router, to get it working again. So I thought the Router is blocking/not redirecting AFP/SMB traffic to the Time Capsule, in some ways...  \nI also tried to ping the Time Capsule from the MBP and it pings correctly using TC's IP address and Bonjour .local name.

This utility allows you to manually set your fans' speeds, which will cool the machine, reducing the throttling somewhat.\n", "Q: mac book pro headphones not working even with the correct sound settings . my macbook pro( 13 inch mid 2009) running yosemite 10.10.5 is not delivering sound to the headphone speakers .I am using my iPhones headphones .it is able to receive mic input though. does it mean it has a hardware issue \n\nA: To diagnose the problem verify the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are you sure that the headset is set as source under Input? (Make sure it isn't using the built-in mic of the computer)\n\n*If you unplug the headphones, can the MacBook play sound through the built-in speakers?\n\n*If you plug your headphones into some other device (i.e. another computer or, an iPhone), can you play sound and hear it?\n\n*With the same settings as in your screenshot but with a different headset or a set of speakers (if you have any of those), can you hear sound through the MacBook?\n\n\nIf the MacBook either doesn't play sound regardless of the output device, you probably have a hardware problem. To be extra sure, try running Apple Hardware Test (AHT).\nIf the headset can't output sound when connected to other devices, that might be what's defective. \n", "Q: How to prevent QuickTime from showing cursor when playing subtitles?

I checked in System Preferences and I have the internal mic at its highest input setting.\nTo get around this I bought a cheap used microphone and headset but discovered that my iMac has no separate mic input plug and I gather I need a special four-wire connector that uses the headphone jack to do both headphone and mic together.

There's an EFI partition before the HFS+ volume in the partition table but nothing after it.\nWhen I attempt to resize the HFS+ volume in Disk Utility, it acts like everything works, but completes in about 4 seconds without making any changes to the partition table.  Trying from the command line using sudo diskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk3s2 0 gives 0 does not appear to be a valid disk size.

Somehow Mac OSX shows the real disk size, but is not capable to change the GPT size header and to relocate the second “header” to the real disk end.\n\nA: Following instructions from this helpful article, I wiped and rebuilt the partition table (GPT).  Basic commands used:\nsudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk3\nsudo gpt show /dev/disk3 > ~/tmp/disk3-gpt\nsudo gpt destroy /dev/disk3\nsudo gpt create -f /dev/disk3    # -f for MBR compatibility\nsudo gpt add -b ${start} -s ${size} -t ${type_guid} /dev/disk3\n# repeat above command for each partition to be re-added\n\nAfterwards, I used the Disk Utility application to resize the HFS+ volume.  It worked!\nOSX may remount partitions immediately after they are re-added; in this case, you will need to unmount them again before continuing to re-add more partitions.\nIf the command line is not your thing, well, then you probably didn't clone your drive with dd in the first place.\n\nA: I add another answer, because\n\n*\n\n*I think there is a safer way repairing the GPT than @intuited did\n\n*it works from standard Linux except actual resizing\n\n*it cares for SSD trim as far as it's possible with HFS+.\n\nSo, you need to do this only if you want to make sure most of the actually empty blocks are marked as empty on your SSD for performance (and wear?) reasons.\nIf you are not working with an SSD you may skip most of this and only do step 2 for the whole disk (just omit count=220), then step 3 and finally 7.\nNow let's start.

The formula I've got right now is:\nCOUNT(Skudd;COUNTIF(Type;\"Pistol\"))\n\nThis should return something over 1500 shots, but currently returns the result 28. The number of times at the range shooting pistol is 18. \n\nA: Use SUMIF instead of COUNTIF. SUMIF let's you search for a value in one range and accumulate values in another range if a match is found. COUNTIF counts the occurrences of a match, which is why you're getting lower than expected results.\nLet's say I have two columns: Type and Count. Here's our sample data:\n\nIf I want to SUMIF all the Count values when Type is value A I'd use:\n=SUMIF(A2:A7, \"A\", B2:B7)\n\nDoing this for values A, B and C yields the correct results on our simple data set so we can convince ourselves this is what we actually want:\n\nSo, in your case, you'd want to do something like:\n=SUMIF(<range where you keep gun type>, \"Pistol\", <range where you keep shots fired>)\n\nAnd that would give you the total shots fired any time you recorded the gun type as Pistol.\nNote, it's not necessary for the columns to be adjacent, which is nice. But they should have a similar range or odd things can happen.\n", "Q: Am I being hacked?

Also what all other data should be transferred?\nMajor chunks of my data are iPhoto library (8 GB) and iTunes music (26 GB).\n\nA: I've been using SD cards more and more just as you mention and I think you'll be ticked with the benefits of having double the storage.\nHere are the tools I use to get the data I need on relative speeds so I can choose what should be stored on the drive and what shouldn't go there.\n\n\n*\n\n*Blackmagic Disk Speed Test \n\n*DaisyDisk\nThe Daisy Disk tool is really stellar for quickly seeing which chunks of data are big enough to be worth your time to handle. In my case, the first chunks I will move to the card are:\n\n\n*\n\n*20 GB of logic files from /Library/Application\\ Support/Logic to the card\n\n*40 GB of Photos Library if the automatic compression algorithms don't shrink the files on my local storage enough for my tastes.\n\n*Less seldom used Virtual Box and VMWare virtual machine storage drive files\n\n\nI also use BlackMagic disk tester to check how the speed of both drives is actually so that I can keep the things I don't care about being slow on the slower SD card (or pay more for a faster SD card).\nOS X would run fine with your entire user folder on the SD card, but make sure you have a second admin account on the boot volume if you go that drastic route.\nAs far as opening files - most applications will run just fine if you use Finder aliases or command line sym links to point to the storage card once you move files off the boot volume.\nAlso, if you are bugged by HiddenStorage in your setting, download the full version of DaisyDisk - it runs for free if you have bought the app on the MAS and adds two critical features for me: scanning as an administrator and collecting files to then delete them\nBe sure your Time Machine backup is backing up both the boot volume and the SD card before you delete things, but I've had no issues running OS X like this from 10.7 Lion through the betas of 10.11 El Capitan.\n\nSome apps are cranky, so I would leave all system files where they are and worry about things that are 10 GB or more in size rather than trying to micro manage dozens of small relations that don't yield significant storage savings on the boot drive.\nIn your case, you can use iTunes to locate the iTunes storage on the external SD card and moving the iPhotos Library is trivial as well. Move it from Finder and then open the new file. Delete the original file once you're sure things work and/or you have a solid back up.\n\nA: Yes, the MacBook Air will treat the SD card just like any other storage medium connected to it. So you will be able to put, applications, photos, documents, etc. on it. I don't think that you will be able to use it with Time Machine, though.\n", "Q: 3Gs how to do simple file operations like create folders, move/copy, drag/drop, from Windows via USB?

It only mounts as a Camera (therefor the DCIM folder). Pictures taken on the phone will appear in the DCIM folder. For syncing of music, apps and other data, iPhones and all iOS devices for that matter rely on iTunes or Cloud services. There is no official way to play with the filesystem on either the phone or the PC. There are possibilities like jailbreaking. \n\nA: I would start by installing ifunbox - http://www.i-funbox.com as it exists to allow the precise USB storage you ask for and it supports Windows.\nFrom there you could jailbreak the device (possibly) or look for more full featured windows software to access the storage. Basically, you'll need to replace the usbmuxd component that iTunes would have installed to act as Windows drivers and bridge code to allow better communication and control of the iPhone hardware than Windows ships with natively. I'm a little concerned that you are taking pictures and not seeing them. I was under the impression that Windows could access those directly without any other settings or accommodations, but perhaps the iOS device needs a full erase. You can test that at settings -> general -> reset\n\nA: The iPhone doesn't simply 'restrict users' from access. The reason it is not accessible is due to the design of the hardware and software. The software is designed in discrete layers that are each digitally signed with a key, thus reducing the ability of one layer to access the other without the appropriate signature or API. The user space is separated from the OS, and likewise, each application is sandboxed from the user space and OS. For this reason, even if you were to install an application to act as a file explorer, it would only see its own file space, not the entire device.\nTo learn more, please read this excellent document: iOS Security\nThe only way to access much of the iPhone system is to 'jail break' it. Essentially, what you do when you jail break an iPhone is to crack the root certificate and device keys, unlocking all the encryption. Of course, when you do this, you are now vulnerable to any application which can take over your device, grab your credentials, etc.\n", "Q: Change Connected Servers I have two Synology Diskstations in my list of Connected Servers.

Shut down for 10 mins. Restarted, graphics came on distorted. Apple logo in the middle of screen with small broken lines and specks all over the screen.  It tried to load but froze up again. Had to push power button a few times and hold it down to shut off.\n\nA: Sounds like a dead graphics card. If it's really that old you'll be out of luck to get a replacement card from Apple. Ask a local service provider to be sure.\nIf you want to rule out software, try booting from an external drive. RAM would be a small possibility as well. \n", "Q: Accidentally deleted history in Safari. Is there any way to get it back? I accidentally clicked the delete button when my mouse had clicked on 5 September 2015 under the history page.\nIs it stored somewhere temporarily or something before it is deleted?\n\nA: No, once you delete history, it is removed from the database. \nThat database is backed up, so you can use your backup method (Time Machine backup, etc) to restore the following files:\n~/Library/Safari/History*\n\n", "Q: Dual boot OS X and Manjaro - Problems (Cross-posted in Linux StackExchange)\nSo I'm trying to dual boot OS X and Manjaro. Using the graphical installer of Manjaro, you're given the option (well, it's an obligation) to create a partition that mounts to /boot/efi. \nManjaro installs without any problem and when the Mac reboots it goes straight up into Manjaro.\nThe thing is I want to make OS X the default boot option and not Manjaro. If I press alt on the Mac Keyboard just after booting (and before it goes into Manjaro) I get to the disk selection screen and I can select OS X fine, it'll boot correctly.\nBUT if I try to make OS X as default boot drive in OS X System Preferences and then go to the alt menu at boot and select the manjaro drive it instead goes to OS X...\nI even tried this https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBookPro11,x#Method_1:_creating_an_extra_apple-format_bootable_partition_with_GRUB in the Arch Wiki and it gets me to GRUB but then Manjaro fails to boot....\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: My guess would be that OS X is clobbering your GrUB when it sets its own bootloader when you make the change in System Preferences. My advice would be to not set OS X or Monjaro as your default in OS X, but rather use GrUB. You can then set GrUB to default to OS X after a customizable delay, which I assume is the behavior you're looking for. Potentially helpful link\n\nA: It depends on the layout of the partitions.\nIf you boot the Mac to the chooser screen - hold option when you hear the startup chime - does the Mac OS show?\nIf so, you can select it and then choose the startup disk.\nIf not, then the boot chain is compromised. You'll need to boot to internet recovery or boot to another OS to get control of things and re-bless the Mac volume.\nYou could try resetting the NVRAM - but that wouldn't help in the case where you can't option boot to OS X directly.\n\nA: Just go to the OS X operating system and search for startup disks in Spotlight. Click on the lock icon and choose the target disk as the MacintoshHD. Now restart in the target disk. That should fix the problem.\n\nA: I don't know anything about dual-booting OSX and Linux, but there may be a solution to change the boot order.\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Select Startup Disk.\n\n*Available systems will display: Select the system in the middle of the screen to use to start up the computer.\n\n*Select Restart in the middle right of the Startup Disk window.\n\n", "Q: Is there another way to kill an app other than force quit?

Then I went to trash and deleted everything in there. Then, I check Usage again. It had said at first mail was taking up 19.4 MB, then AFTER I deleted a ton of things, it went UP. Now, it says it's taking up 33.4!! It did the exact opposite. I deleted a bunch of stuff, and the amount of storage the app was using went up... what's happening?? Thanks!\n\nA: First, try signing out/disabling all Mail accounts. If that doesn't work, keep reading. \niOS apps created by Apple create and store logs, especially Mail. By deleting all the stores emails, you probably created 100's of log data about the deletion. You need to delete all of these. \nThe only way to do that is to restore your iPad. First, plug in you iPad to your computer and open iTunes. If \"Other\" takes over a gigabyte, you will need to restore. If not, disregard everything after this. \nTo restore, first click \"Backup\". After the backup is done, hit restore. It will download the latest iOS, then restore. After it is down restoring, set it up like it was new until it asks you to restore from backup. Select the backup you made earlier and let it work its magic. \n", "Q: Unable to remove images from iphone 6 My Iphone storage is almost full, so I am trying to copy and remove images from my iphone to pc with itunes. For some reason I am not able to do that and the reverse is happening.\nImages from my laptop is copied to my iphone.\nHow should I fix that?\n\nA: iTunes won't actually transfer pictures from your iPhone to your laptop. To do that, you will need to use the built-in Windows Image Capture program. It should open as an option when you plug your iPhone into your computer. After starting the program you can import the pictures from your iPhone. \nHere is Apple's official documentation on importing photos: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201302\nThese steps may be more concise:\nhttp://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/best-ways-get-photos-iphone/\n", "Q: How to make the Open... dialog default to another folder?

Is there a way to change the default folder for a specific application and/or for all applications Open... dialog?\n\nA: The Open... Dialog defaults to the current folder for MOST applications. You chan change this by changing directory in Terminal (note that in my experience, some applications, especially Java ones do not follow this default behavior and in stead open the same directory every time, I assume this is hard-coded in the application). \nNow to the meat of your question: can we change this behavior on a per-application basis, using the tools OS X has pre-installed?  My guess is yes!, though I don't have time to do the research right now. What we'd be looking for is:\n# wait for application to be switched \n\n# see if we have defined a default directory for that app\n\n# if we have change, if not go to default \n\n# go back to top and wait to app switching\n\nOthers should definitely feel free to flesh out my skeleton code, please don't accept this answer until it is complete.

I have PS4 that I use it also for Netflix but I'm only wondering if Apple TV provides extra features to Netflix experience.\n\nA: Really, the only difference is that the UI (User Interface) will be different between the Apple TV and the PS4. UI is the arrangement of any virtual objects that the user interacts with, so virtual buttons, menus, etc. will vary from platform to platform. Honestly, if you want to use it JUST for Netflix, what you have is probably fine, at least not worth spending an extra $69 over.\nHowever, Apple is rumoured to unveil a new Apple TV very soon, which could have new features like a touchscreen remote, 4K support, a dedicated App Store, and more. So at least wait until Wednesday to make your final decision.\nYou can read all all the rumours about a new Apple TV here.\nAnd watch the Keynote on Wednesday, September 9 at 12 PM CDT here.\n", "Q: Where does this strange output in Terminal come from?

A restart will likely solve your problem.\n", "Q: osx 10.10 force 32 bit I am trying to start my OS X 10.10 in 32 bit, but with no success:\n\n\n*\n\n*First I tried it by keeping 3 + 2 pressed during start up\n\n*Then I tried by the following command: sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386\nIn both cases all I get RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64 by running uname -a\nIs it possible at all to force 32 bit on OS X 10.10?\n\n\n*\n\n*This is my processor: i7-2675QM\n\n*I have hardware drivers that only support 32 bit for AWUS036H\n\n\nIs there another way to use that hardware with 10.10?\n\nA: Why?\nAll OS since Snow Leopard are 64 bit only.\n\nA: According to http://www.alfa.com.tw/products_show.php?pc=34&ps=92, AWUS036H is only supported up to OSX 10.6. If you need a kext or similar to use the device, you will be out of luck with 64bit only versions of OSX (which means 10.7 and higher).\n", "Q: On Mac, ⌥ S types ß (beta). What about alpha? I can use ⌥ + S to type the greek letter ß (beta) in any application, which is very useful.\nHowever, what about poor α (alpha)? Is there a shortcut for it?\nCurrently, I either copy & paste it from another source or switch the keyboard to greek temporarily. Both methods take a lot of time, and copy & paste often results in formatting problems as well (the source format is preserved).\nIs there a shortcut to quickly type alpha, or a way I can create it (through an app or messing with hidden system settings for example)?\nI am using OS X Yosemite 10.10.5\n\nA: ß isn't beta. It's the (german) sharp s. The greek beta looks like this: β.\nThe fastest method probably is: \n\n\n*\n\n*enable the greek keyboard layout permamently in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources\n\n*defining and enabling a free keyboard shortcut in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Input Sources -> Select next source in input menu (e.g ShiftAltSpacebar)\n\n\nTo type α/β/γ/ε etc., you just have to switch the keyboard layout with ShiftAltSpacebar, hit A/B/G/E etc. and switch back to your common keyboard layout with ShiftAltSpacebar. If you have more than two keyboard layouts enabled (e.g. US, Greek, Hex) you may add a second keyboard shortcut \"Select previous source in input menu\" and hit that one to get back or you have to rotate through all your layouts with the \"Select next source in input menu\"-shortcut until you reach your common layout again.\n\nKarabiner/KeyRemap4MacBook offer a remapping of the right Option/alt key to temporarily switch to the greek keyboard layout in the presets (the greek keyboard layout has to be enabled):\n\nIn Lion this doesn't work properly and interferes with Spotlight. I had to turn off the Spotlight shortcuts in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Spotlight. One might add a customized remapping by modifying a copy of the original source to get it working without disabling the Spotlight shortcuts:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>Change input source temporary</name>\n    <item>\n      <name>Change input source to Greek while you are holding down right option key.</name>\n      <identifier>remap.change_input_source_temporary_greek_option_r</identifier>\n      <autogen>\n        __KeyToKey__\n        KeyCode::OPTION_R,\n        KeyCode::VK_NONE,\n        Option::KEYTOKEY_BEFORE_KEYDOWN, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_GREEK, KeyCode::VK_WAIT_100MS,\n        Option::KEYTOKEY_AFTER_KEYUP, KeyCode::SPACE, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L, KeyCode::VK_WAIT_100MS,\n      </autogen>\n    </item>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\n\nA: I use the Character Viewer to insert any Unicode character into my documents.\nThis can be enabled from the Keyboard Preferences menu.\n\nA: If you want to type Greek letters easily but without switching your keyboard layout, you can use a custom KeyBinding dictionary.\nThis is mine; it allows me to type ⌃G, ⌃A to get the letter alpha, and similar for most other Greek letters, plus a bunch of other useful symbols.\nYou can place it at ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict. You can also see more details in my answer here.\n\nA: Create a shortcut text snippet. \nGo to System Preferences (from the Apple  menu).\nClick on Keyboard and then the Text tab.\nEnter “aalpha” (or another text of your choosing that you are unlikely to type by accident) under the “Replace” column and paste the alpha symbol α into the “With” column.\nNow whenever you type “aalpha” you will get α instead. Pretty cool.\n(If you have iCloud on, there’s a good chance you will now be able to use this shortcut text on iOS, too!)\n⁂\nHow to get any character, any time, with no Googling: \n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Command-Ctrl-Space (⌘⌃-Space). A palette with emoji should show up.\n\n*Type the name of the character or symbol you want in the search box at the top. (You may have to scroll up within the pallette).\n\n*Click the symbol to use it.\n\n\n\n\nA: You can use Ukelele to create a new keyboard layout, which will be based on whatever you would like to have Greek letters in. Then, via this app, you can change any key combinations to output greek letters in any way you find most convenient.\nUkelele will create keyboard layout bundle that you can later share, reuse, move to another computer, and so on. Ukelele is not keyboard remapper, these bundles are usable without any dependencies on vanilla OS X.\n\nA: That's not actually beta, it's the German 'ess zett' s/z used for 'double s' in \"heiß\" (= hot) etc. - which is why it sits under s not b.\nß\nvs\nβ\nI'd use System Prefs > Keyboard > Text & add a replace shortcut.\nClick the + at the bottom, then on the left , copy/paste α then on the right type your shortcut. Repeat for β\n[Note: This doesn't work in Chrome, but does in Safari & most Apple apps]\n\nA: Another option in Word is to insert an equation - most useful if your alpha is accompanied by other math.\n\nA: ⌘ + ctrl + space opens the emoji viewer; from there you can search for alpha and enter it into your document easily. It will also appear in your recent emojis so you won't have to search for it next time. This is what I figured out reading this article, similarly frustrated by the lack of a \"alt-based\" alpha option.\n", "Q: Installing Mavericks on brand new Macbook with Yosemite? I want to buy a new MacBook Pro. However, it simply MUST be able to have a different operating system to Yosemite installed, as I need it to work with some hardware which is no longer supported with Yosemite.\nWould it be possible to downgrade a new Macbook?\nThanks\n\nA: Simple answer, I'm afraid - No.\nUnless you buy a machine right on the cusp of a new OS release, it will never be able to boot from an OS that was released before that machine existed.\nThere are no hardware drivers for it, at the most basic level and it's a pretty dangerous thing to do according to Apple.\n", "Q: Cellular data usage irreproducible I have a iPhone 6 (iOS 8.4).

But I don't know whether this is a long-term solution and whether the issue was directly related to iOS 8.4.\n", "Q: How can Apple produce new iPhone 6s if iOS9 is not yet ready I read here that:\n\nApple began iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus mass production in mid August.\n\nI assume that's somewhere at the end of manufacturing process they need to install operating system on the device. It's widely anticipated that new iPhones will come out with iOS9 preinstalled. How can Apple install that new OS on those devices manufactured in August if iOS9 is still not ready yet? Or maybe iOS9 is already finalized and they are just not letting us upgrade older devices to it yet? Or maybe somewhere, as a part of the activation process, a new iPhone downloads patches for the not-fully completed iOS version that was preinstalled on the device?\nPS I realize that this is not unique to iPhone 6S and iOS9 and it must happen every year with a new device and new iOS version.\n\nA: Complete speculation - however...\n'beginning mass-production' does not necessarily mean building the first complete, packaged device on that day.  \nPresumably different suppliers will start making circuit-boards, adding components, machining the metalwork, glassware, etc etc.\nAll this may have a lead time of a week to 2 months.\nAt some point, all the critical components will come together in one place & assembly can begin.\nAfter assembly, then they are then ready to add an OS.\nThat might only be happening this week, or maybe not even until next week - & iOS 9 is very likely to be ready by the time that happens.\nTraditionally, the GM is released to developers within hours of the Keynote speech - which will be next Tuesday, 9th Sept 2015\nIt's anyone's guess as to how far in advance of that the manufacturers may get it [if at all], but we have to assume that it is sufficiently ahead of time for that gathering stockpile of completed phones to be initted, packaged & shipped in time for the release date; which will be announced on Tuesday.\nThey've done this before, we have to assume they're well-practised at being able to hit that date, & that the production line is designed to be run on that method.\n", "Q: How to watch a movie I rented on my Macbook on my iPad? I rented the documentary movie Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine a few hours ago, and was able to watch it on iTunes on the Mac.  When I tried to watch it on iPad, I do not see a Rental tab in the Videos app.\nAccording to this page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201611\nthis should be the way to do it:\n\nBut the 2nd line says: find the movie \"on the device you used to rent it\"... so does that mean if I use my Macbook to rent it, I can't view it on my iPad?\nI can find it in iTunes store on the iPad, and if I tap rent, it will ask me if I want to pay $6.99 to rent it again.  \n\nA: From the same support document:\n\nIf you rented the movie on your computer, but want to watch it on an iOS device, connect the devices and sync using USB. When you move a rented movie from your computer, it will disappear from your computer’s iTunes library. You can move the movie between devices as often as you want, but you can only have it on one device at a time.\nIf you rented the movie on your iOS device or Apple TV, you can’t move it to any other device.\nTo watch an HD movie, you need to play it on a supported device: your computer, iPhone 4 or later, iPad, iPod touch (4th generation or later), or TV using Apple TV.\n\n", "Q: Can't boot into Mac OS after Windows install via Bootcamp I just installed Windows 10 successfully via BootCamp. Now I am neither able to boot into OSX, nor is its partition shown anywhere.\nTurns out the issue occurs because of a mistake I made during the Windows installation.

Could be a dumb question, but I searched for this and couldn't find anything. \n\nA: The short answer is you are safe as long as the ambient temperature and charge hardware don't overheat.\nThe empirical evidence is you can measure the temperature of the wall adapter and the charging puck to approximate the amount of current that's flowing through the inductive charger at any point in time.\nI like to use a fancy infrared thermometer for things like this, but you can use your fingers to know that the charger is within specifications by comparing the temperature change when you take a charging watch off the charger and then let the charger sit against your chosen piece of metal.\nApple's official safety information are at:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.apple.com/watch/ or http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/apple_watch_user_guide.pdf\n\n*https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1712/en_US/Apple_Watch_Info.pdf\n\nA: I connected my charger to a meter.

When I watched a video, closed it while the video was still running (or music on iTunes) and I open the Computer after a while again, it takes ages till I can type in my password in the prompt. Instead, the video/music starts, it fetches emails, updates my calender etc. Sometimes the screen turns even black again that I have to press the power button. Then I can type in my password. So in short, it starts up everything else (sometimes it takes up to two minutes) before I can type my password.\n\n*I have FileVault activeted. When I shut the computer and come back after two hours, sometimes the computer seems to be in \"deep sleeping mode\". So I hear the harddrive starting up, I have to type in my password for the first time to deactivate FileVault (why is that the same password than my normal password?), and then I can type in my normal password. Sometimes, however, it seems like the sleeping mode is not that \"deep\". I open the computer after a night and can type in my password straight away and the desktop appears. There is no need for the FileVault password and it does not take ages as described in (1). \nHow comes its that inconsistent?!\n\nA: You are experiencing more or less the same as me. However I can't change my settings right now. \nNormally your mac will simply sleep, i.e. turn everything into a low power mode and supply the RAM with electricity so it does not get deleted and you can quickly restart working. Then after one hour or so autopoweroff will kick in to save more energy (in order to comply with EU regulations). This is normally set by the autopoweroffdelay. As far as I know this is more or less a suspend-to-disk mode. That means the contents of your memory (RAM) is written to your disk and the RAM is taken offline. So when you next start your Mac, it will first have to load the RAM back from the disk which can take 10 to 60 seconds depending on your drive's speed and RAM size and usage.\nTo make things more complicated there is also a standby mode.\nNow the implementation with FileVault2 is IMHO a bit unfortunate. What happens is that your Mac will first need your password to decrypt your disk. Only then it can start the RAM restoration procedure. This is particularly annoying if the acwake feature is on. In this case the Mac will power on, if you remove the power cord. When I first bought my Mac, it happened to me a couple of times, that I had to leave in a rush, removed the power cord, put the Mac into my bag and when I opened it the battery was half drained. The problem is that it will not sleep again once it is waiting for your FileVault2 password. \nTherefore I disabled acwake with the following command: sudo pmset acwake 0.\nIn order to secure your FileVault2 further, you can use the command sudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1 hibernatemode 25. With this setting the FileVault key will be destroyed once the Mac goes into standby. That means that only suspend-to-disk is used. You may also want to reduce the standbydelay.\nYou can list your timers and options by typing pmset -g into the terminal. You will find more info by typing man pmset. \n", "Q: How can I run a set of terminal commands using one click? So I have this program I use to watch movies on my Apple TV that runs from my Mac in Terminal and goes to the TV. Well whenever you wanna start the server up you have to run a set of commands in Terminal.\n$ cd Desktop\n$ cd PopcornTV\n$ sudo npm install\n$ sudo node atv.js\n\nThese commands start the server which my Apple TV than connects too. Is there anyway I can make a Automator Application or anything of that sort that will run these commands for me when I click a button.\n\nA: Running it in an apple script is not that bad. you just have to run the entire script as root because sudo requires user interaction. if you do an apple script like this one:\ndo shell script \"cd ~/Desktop/PopcornTV && /path/to/npm install && /path/to/node atv.js\" with administrator privileges \n\nreplace then/path/to/npm and /path/to/node with the output of which npm and which node\nit will open up a dialogue and ask you for your password. \n\nA: A solution without using Automator:\n1. Gathering some details:\n\n*\n\n*What is the path to npm?  Find out using which npm in Terminal.app\n\n*What is the path to node?  Find out using which node in Terminal.app\n\n*What is your username?  Find using whoami in Terminal.app\n\nAll of this is important, make a note of the outputs.\n2. Configuring sudo\nLet’s now configure sudo to not require you to use a password for those two commands.\nIn Terminal.app, enter the following:\nsudo visudo\n\nYou will need to enter your password, though you won’t see any typing as you enter it.  Press enter when you’ve completed entering your password.\nThis will open the /etc/sudoers file for you (probably in vi/vim) press shift+g to go to the bottom of the file, then press o to insert a newline and start inserting text, enter the following:\n# Allow me to use npm and node without password\nusername ALL = NOPASSWD: /path/to/npm /path/to/node\n\nYou will need to replace “username”, “/path/to/npm”, and “/path/to/node” with the details you gathered in section 1.\nWhen you have finished entering these details, save and quit by pressing esc then entering :x then pressing enter.\n3. Wrapping it up in a file\nLet’s create a file to put those commands in.  In Terminal.app enter the following:\necho '#!/bin/bash\ncd /Users/username/Desktop/PopcornTV\nsudo /path/to/npm install\nsudo /path/to/node atv.js' > ~/Desktop/startPopcornTV.command\n\nchmod 740 ~/Desktop/startPopcornTV.command\n\nAgain, you’ll need to replace “username”, “/path/to/npm”, and “/path/to/node” with the details you gathered in section 1.\n4. Running\nOn your Desktop you will now have a file called startPopcornTV.command (depending on your setting it might just be called startPopcornTV).\nAll you need to do now is double click that file and it will start PopcornTV for you.\n\nA: Open up Applescript-Editor\nadd this:\ndo shell script \"cd ~/Desktop/PopcornTV && /usr/local/bin/npm install && /usr/local/bin/node atv.js\" with administrator privileges\n\nSave as an application. Just open it when you want to run.\n\nA: I think this should work : \necho \"#\\n cd Desktop \\n cd PopcornTV \\n sudo npm install \\n sudo node atv.js\" >> ~/Desktop/startMyServer.command\n\nthen make the command file executable\nchmod +x ~/Desktop/startMyServer.command\n\nyou will then find the file startMyServer.command on your desktop\n\nA: Please... use the nice tool Automator!!! For heavens sake, it did not come with macOS for nothing!\nSo regardless of the Terminal commands that you want to execute, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator (which can be found in your Applications folder)\n\n*Choose Application as the type and confirm by clicking \n\n*In the Actions, choose Utilities and doubleclick or drag Run Shell Script to the right pane\n\n*Copy/paste or enter the Terminal commands within the blank space within the window, you can leave all pulldown values to default\n\n*Test if this is what you want with the Run (play symbol) button\n\n*Go to File > Save... and pick a dedicated location to save the Automator script, giving it a recognisable name\n\n*Create an alias to put on the desktop\n\n*Done\n\n", "Q: How to automatically import new songs from iTunes media folder on different devices?

It does lose playlist info from the recipient machine & a few album covers always tend to go missing, but it's the best workaround I've discovered, after many years of trying.\nRemove the existing .itl file from ~/Music/iTunes/ then create a new, 'broken' one from Terminal [copy the old one for safety if you prefer, but I've never found a way to manually insert data from one into another]\nOpen Terminal & enter this touch ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Library.itl That will create an empty ITL file, broken enough for our purposes.  \nNext time you launch iTunes, it will see the corrupt .itl & rebuild it [it will claim to be importing]. This is very much faster than having an .itl that doesn't match what the .xml thinks it ought to be, minutes rather than hours.\n", "Q: iCloud backup fails on iOS 6 Have recently noticed my ios6 running iPhone hasn't done an iCloud backup since November.

It's not registered to an individual. So you would be able to take it to any Apple Store if you needed to.\"\nI ask this community is this is normal or theres somekind of bull in here... The warranty is not transfered to me? The warranty goes in the name of who buys the product?!!\n\nA: It seems the seller has a decent understanding of things and what you wrote smells of no bull. \nApple warrants goods in the country of purchase (which sets obligations on the warrantee and the warrantor). Do keep in mind that the original purchase date of the phone sets the warranty. A replacement phone would have the remainder of the original one year warranty and a 90 day warranty from the date of the exchange - whichever is longer on it's own (the 90 days isn't stacked / it runs concurrently with any remaining warranty).\nPossession means you can register the phone and seek all service as if you were the original purchaser with a few exceptions. You probably can't return it and you would need a notarized bill of sale and original receipt to do things like bypass activation lock. \nYou can check your phone warranty status at https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do\nYou can add AppleCare just as the original buyer could. You can seek any and all other warranty services as if you were the original buyer without needing any proof of ownership or purchase. \n\nA: I would probably check with Apple, but it used to be that the warranty, including AppleCare was based on the serial number. \nFrom personal experience, we bought an iMac from a private seller, and when we registered the serial number to our Apple ID, AppleCare transferred to us with the time remaining. \nThe graphics card went bad during the AppleCare period and Apple replaced it without a charge. \nAgain, confirm with Apple first, as their policy for honoring warranties and AppleCare contracts may have changed since my experience. Also as bmike mentioned, there may be different contracts in different countries due to the statutes of that Jurisdiction. \n", "Q: Blank Mail screen which then crashes but reminas open in background The title sums it up.\nOnce opened it simply doesn't show any emails and then eventually seems to crash but is open in the background still not showing anything.\n\nA: Try to restart your Mac and see if that fixes it.\n", "Q: Is it possible to only run one application as non-retina whereas everything else is retina?

However, this is essential for anyone else in the same boat -\nIf you install Windows 10 directly and update to version 1511, it'll accept Win7/8/8.1 product keys when you activate.\n\nA: I ran Windows 7 on a Virtual Box VM and managed to upgrade to Windows 10. There was an issue upgrading from the Windows 10 icon in the task bar. It said the display driver wasn't compatible, but it upgrades fine if you download the Windows 10 iso file and do it that way.\n\nA: Bootcamp now supports Windows 10 direct from ISO. Instead of trying to convert from Windows 7 to 10 in order to get the free license... just call or chat with Microsoft technical support and explain the situation. \nI just did this myself, and they gave me a new Windows 10 license key in exchange for a valid Windows 7 key. Worked perfectly.\nSave yourself the headache and do the above... there is no way a 2015 MacBook is going to run W7 with Bootcamp.\nI did this over chat with Microsoft Answer Desk: https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/chat/30/\n", "Q: Am I asking too much of my MacBooks performance?

I forgot my macbook pro charger at a friends place and I won't have it for a week. I saw that there are 3rd party chargers being sold for half the price of official chargers. Can 3rd party chargers damage my macbook pro? After I get my normal charger back in a week I will be mostly using that one and keep the new one as an extra, so I won't be using it fulltime.\n\nA: It's unlikely they will actually damage your MacBook Pro by delivering too much power to it. But there are many cautionary tales to be found on the internet of third party chargers overheating, and occasionally catching fire or exploding. Technically, using a non-Apple charger without Apple's written permission may also void your warranty if anything did go wrong.\nPersonally, I wouldn't risk it.\n\nA: Even an Apple charger can damage a Mac. It's far, far more rare since Apple tends to have superior QA and more motivation to make sure the adapter fails safely and fails before the computer would than the average knock off manufacturer is motivated by safety or adding cost for a margin of safety.\nThat being said, there are many good chargers that will work just fine. The main risk is fire from a poorly constructed transformer as opposed to down stream damage to your Mac since the magsafe port delivers between 3 V and 25 V DC it's not a huge amount of power or danger to life or hardware.\n\nA: I own a 2017 13″ MacBook Pro, which came with an original 61W USB-C power adapter from Apple. After losing the adapter two weeks ago, I bought a PD2.0 adapter for 60W output from a Taiwanese company Acer for half the price of the original, and it works just fine so far! It charges the laptop quick and smooth, no sudden jumps and overheating as reported by @Kharski. Moreover, it's slightly lighter than the original adapter.\nOne note though: when buying a PD 2.0 adapter, make sure it can supply all the required power at 20V from a single port. For example, in my case I was looking for a 60W USB-C adapter. Therefore it must say something like this on the package:\nUSB-C Output: 5V⎓3A, 9V⎓3A, 12V⎓3A, 15V⎓3A, 20V⎓3A/Max 60W\n\nNote that it can supply 3 ampere current at 20 volts, which gives 60 watt power at that voltage.\nBeware of the adapters which provide less current per port. For example:\nUSB-C Output: 5V⎓2A, 9V⎓2A, 12V⎓2A, 15V⎓2A, 20V⎓2A/Max 40W\nTotal Output: 60W (max)\n\n– this is bad! Because the adapter cannot provide all the necessary power through a single port.\nUPD. Two years later, both my MacBook and Acer power supply still work together. No issues!\nUPD2: I visited a Genius Bar and they told me that my battery is bloated. But I'm not sure if this was related to the power supply, because they offered me to change the battery for free. Apparently, it's a known issue for my model of MBP.\n\nA: I can't comment yet so would just like to write two remarks, I own a chinese charger alongside my Apply one and:\n\n\n*\n\n*the fan goes crazy when the battery is not at a 100% (I.. do hope it's not due potential software contained in the charger itself, yes I know it sounds crazy but I've heard that for USB cables)\n\n*I searched this topic cause my battery (not connected currently) just went from 33% to 43% (in two jumps), which I never noticed before.\n\nA: After having two separate Apple chargers short out, I've bought third-party replacements (45W and 85W); and both have been working fine for a year or so. This includes using them in other countries with different plugs.\nSome third-party products will be of lower quality, certainly, but nearly all of them should conform to various electrical standards. We all hear horror stories, but this is probably 0.001% of all units.\n\nA: Yes it may hurt your battery, you need to be very careful when using 3rd party products. The charger needs to be compatible with your battery, check the information on it (input/output values - how many V and A), if they are the same as your original one then you shouldn't worry much. Still this doesn't guarantee that it won't damage the battery or the mac.\n\nA: Try Nekteck PD 65W charger, it worked pretty good for me and it's certified by USB-IF.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Nekteck-Certified-Delivery-PixelBook-Nintendo/dp/B0721KG2Q7\n", "Q: Updating OS on protected machine I work offsite and for a large company and need my OS updated.

Some suggestions recommended fiddling with wifi, resetting network settings and setting the DNS to 8.8.8.8.  I couldn't imagine what most of those suggestions would have to do with the problem.  But, I noticed that the common denominator to many suggestions revolved around networking.  So, it gave me the idea to try the VPN app on my phone.  I tried that and Bingo!  Just connecting to the VPN allowed me to complete the update.\nTo be clear about how I connected to a VPN, I used the PIA app from Apple's App Store.  I'm sure there are many VPN options.  But, the point is that the connection was made to a VPN server from a VPN client residing on my iPhone.  This is an iPhone 5S, by the way.\n\nA: Here's one I found on apple.com\n\n\n*\n\n*Click done when the Done icon show up\n\n*Turn on airplane mode\n\n*Wait 15 second\n\n*Disbaled Airplane mode\n\n*Enjoy It And i promise that it will never happen again to your device\n\n\nWarning: sometimes this does not work\nIt works better on an iPad device.\n\nA: Generally a hard reboot will fix that...

I tried all solution in the top 2 answers, as well as re-flashed iOS 6.1.3 again, but all to no avail.\nFinally, I set up a VPN connection and was delighted that it began to download apps. I also set up an HTTP proxy and it also worked.\nIMO, if you have tried Airplane Mode and signing-out then signing-in to your Apple ID and both don't work - go get some VPN or proxy - your network is doing something wacky that you won't solve with your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. This should particularly be considered if your App Store region doesn't match your location (see below).\nIt could be that the Communist Party just outright blocked some of App Store's functionality (Note: my Apple ID's region is set to United States, instead of where I live (mainland China)).\n", "Q: Why is bash echoing instead of running Apple Script I have a function in my .bash_profile that should allow me to add startup items.

To not confuse them with the inner quotes we need to escape those with \\.\nNow running the command with Spotify will output login item Spotify. This is just the result from the AppleScript, a login item was created. To suppress this you can add >/dev/null to the command: osascript -e \"tell ...\" >/dev/null.\n", "Q: How to set default scroll option for full-screen mode in Mac Preview?

I have an cross-platform app that runs Lua scripts, and I am interested in publishing it on the iOS App Store. I know that Apple does not allow apps to download and run code from the internet on iOS, but what about a simple Lua configuration file, like this:\nobj.title = \"Hello world\"\nobj.author = \"Somebody\"\nobj.version = \"1.0.1\"\n\nOr if assignments count as code, what about a simple JSON-like table, like:\n{\n    title = \"Hello world\",\n    author = \"Somebody\",\n    version = \"1.0.1\"\n}\n\nWould either of these violate the guidelines?\n\nA: This is fine. Apple doesn't approve of apps which download executable Objective-C. Other languages seem to be fine, including but not limited to JavaScript. A configuration file, regardless of the language, is perfectly within the guidelines.\nThe specific wording of the guideline indicates that content (used figuratively to mean data, executables, scripts, etc) that is provided by the app developer, modifying the functionality of the app further than is already built in to the app at review time, is prohibited. This is to prevent apps changing completely once they've been reviewed and accepted. Your app which runs Lua scripts presumably can run Lua built in, rather than executing the scripts externally and receiving the result. This means that all the functionality is within the app, thus acceptable.\n", "Q: Using iMac 27\" for displaying HDMI output I have an HD satellite box which I previously connected to my old PC.\nI am interested in using my new iMac 27\" 5K as a monitor for its output.\nI did go through the various answers available, but some contradicted others, and many were outdated. Currently, I connected the box's HDMI cable to a Kanex Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter and then to the iMac, and as you can guess, it failed to recognize a second display. \nIs there any way around it? Either by some software or a different adapter?\nThank you. \n\nA: It can't be done. The 5K iMacs only have MiniDisplayPort/Thunderbolt output, not input, because DisplayPort 1.2 can't handle video at 5K resolution and so it couldn't be used to drive the iMac as a display in Target Display Mode in the same way as some other iMac models. The 5K display on the iMac can only be used with the iMac, because it doesn't have any inputs capable of accepting a 5K input from another source.\n\nA: Use an external HD video grabber via USB port.\n", "Q: Disabled 'Shake mouse pointer to locate' setting in El Capitan but still get big cursor I have been able to disable the shake cursor to enlarge setting by going to Settings > Accessibility > Display > Shake mouse pointer to locate and disabling the option.

I can only disable the big cursor when using the MBP trackpad not the BTTR one.\nI am using El Capitan Public Beta build 15A262e\n\nA: That just sounds like a bug to me. Really, like with all beta software, bugs are to be encountered in the OS X El Capitan Public Beta. In fact, that's the point of betas, let certain users find and report bugs so that Apple, or whatever developer, can fix them before the software reaches mainstream adoption. So, unfortunately, all you can really do is report that bug to Apple, using Feedback Assistant. If you really hate it, then you could either wait for the public release of El Capitan in a couple of weeks or downgrade to Yosemite. You could also try installing El Capitan again, but it just like a bug in the beta software to me.\n", "Q: Beats1 on Mac doesn’t start unless I logout Every time I try to listen to Beats1 in iTunes on Mac, I have to log out and log back in, otherwise it doesn’t start. It has absolutely no problem starting if I’m freshly logged in, but if I quit iTunes and then I try to listen again, it doesn’t start unless I do the log out/log in dance. How can I overcome this situation?\nI should mention that I’m not an Apple Music subscriber, nor do I want to become one.\nI’m on the latest version of Mavericks, if that matters.\n\nA: I know this situation. Even if you use the correct Apple ID to authorize music playback, you may still see a repeat request for authorization. This can happen if you're logged in to your Mac using a simple user account, which doesn't have the correct privileges to allow iTunes to update its internal files with the authorization information.\n    The solution is to log out and then log back in using an administrator account. Once you're logged in with an administrator account, launch iTunes, select \"Authorize This Computer\" from the Store menu, and provide the appropriate Apple ID and password.\n    Log out, then log back in with your basic user account. iTunes should now be able to play the song.\n", "Q: What does the 'Special Paste' menu item in Xcode do? In Xcode 6.x, the Edit -> Paste and Edit -> Paste and Preserve Formatting menu items are self-evident.

I have ripped 800 or so CDs onto my macbook via iTune. \nMac OS 10.6.8. iTune 11.4\nI want to move these music files elsewhere (to increase mac's available memory capacity - I have moved all my heavy files to hard disc/storage elsewhere & was planning to do the same with music files). However, when I test this by removing a certain music files, iTune won't play those tunes I removed that does no longer exist on the macbook - it is clearly playing from the music file, and not from the iTunes. My iTunes does not seem to hold any of my ripped music. How do you actually COPY all my ripped CD music onto iTune so that I can move the music files elsewhere but will still play on my macbook? Apple support site provides no solution, only encourages me to sign up for things I don't need (i.e. regular music subscription) but there must be a way! Any help greatly appreciated!  \n\nA: What you're asking for is called iTunes Match, also Apple Music. Since you don't want to pay for those I'd suggest an iTunes server instead. If you have a second mac you can set it up like this:\nhttp://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/how_set_itunes_home_server\n...or using a third party app (not free):\nhttp://supersync.com/access.php\nIf you have a NAS you could use the built in iTunes server, e.g. Synology:\nhttps://www.synology.com/en-global/knowledgebase/tutorials/632\n\nA: iTunes supports this from 10.5.1 and on. It's called iTunes Match.\nOnce you pay for the service, your entire library gets uploaded to Apple's servers. You could also try Apple Music for free and get three months to kick the tires, just be sure to cancel if you don't want to pay for that. It costs more than Match, but you get more too.\nAs for the corrupt library - make a Time Machine backup of the Mac and then hold the option key when you start iTunes.\nCreate a new library where you want the organizational files to live. You can then choose a location for the ripped files to exist temporarily while they are processed by iTunes. Once the tracks are uploaded, you can delete them. iTunes asks if you want to delete the local storage or delete it everywhere via the iCloud. Choose local deletion.\nAlternatively, you could set up some DLNA player using open-source software and point the player software to your cloud backed storage. I've heard of people using Amazon, Google and DropBox and other vendors for this storage online. \nIt's not integrated well in iTunes, but a local DLNA software would let your iTunes stream from the library depending on which setup you choose.\nFor me, I pay the $$ each month to Apple for easy across all my devices. No Mac that uses Apple Music has more than a thousand songs locally, the vast majority of my library lives in iCloud (and also on several backup disks).\n", "Q: Is something on the IO logic board burnt or..? yesterday, i plugged my macbook pro to charge, and my magsafe charger got a little burn where it connects to the magsafe charger (wall->magsafe).

EDIT:  I just discovered that an Apple Music Family Plan actually requires OSX Yosemite and iOS8, which is a non-starter since we will not be upgrading past Mavericks (Yosemite caused me massive problems and I had to remove it and downgrade immediately) and my partner despises iOS later than iOS 6 and won't use it.  So I guess this means I'm stuck with only an individual plan regardless.\nEDIT 01.31.2016:  Turns out that there is a VERY significant, but somewhat subtle, reality in dropping iTunes Match and using Apple Music instead.  ALL music you add in the future, will become DRM-encoded if you ever download it from the iTunes Music Library, including your own non-DRM CD rips!  Looks like the only actual \"solution\" is to have both iTunes Match and Apple Music.  =(\nI've been an iTunes Match subscriber for a couple of years, and I have my ~15,000 songs all uploaded and also local on my Mac.  I don't really use it for mobile devices much at all, and primarily got it so that I could update my library (much of which was ripped from CDs long ago at 96kb to 128kb) to 256kb versions.\nNow I've been playing with Apple Music during the initial free trial period and I have to admit, I like it a lot.  I've been discovering music like crazy including many albums by artists I like a lot, that I had no idea were even still releasing albums (OMD anyone??  WOW!)\nBut now, iTunes Match wants to renew again in a few days, and I'm really unclear on if I need it or not.  Info online seems to be incomplete and conjectural, since Apple Music is still so new.\nWhat exactly will I lose if I let iTunes Match expire, given that I already have all of my library downloaded locally?\nI understand (correct me if I'm wrong please) that with Apple Music, all matched music that is downloaded will have DRM.  I can live with this.  I also believe that any music that is not matched and instead is uploaded by Apple Music to my iCloud Library, will stay in the original format i.e. DRM-free.  This is good because some of my library is music I composed myself or by other musicians that I know or work with, and I wouldn't want that stuff to suddenly be locked down.\nGiven this, is there actually any reason I'll regret letting iTunes Match lapse and instead signing up for an Apple Music subscription?  I know the cost is significantly higher, but I'm so enjoying the music discovery process in iTunes that I'm actually thinking it's worth $15 for a family plan for myself and my partner.\n\nA: Your understanding of the DRM is correct.\nThe functionality of iTunes Match is included with Apple Music, so yeah: win win.\n\nA: This is a nice way to ask What's the difference between iTunes Match and Apple Music?\nYou have yourself covered as long as you download all of your Purchased and uploaded music from Apple's servers before your subscription lapses.\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes Match was priced at $2 a month to store everything online and sync playlists, metadata and songs across multiple devices\n\n*Apple Music is priced at $10 a month to do everything iTunes Match did. It also adds nearly unlimited DRM downloads of the catalog, nearly unlimited streaming of the entire catalog, and reduction in advertisements of streamed content.\n\n\nGoing forward, do the math on which plan works best for yourself and potentially family organized group budget wise. I'm all in on the value of Apple Music. It's like the best record shops on the planet are my personal lending library and the due dates are extended for as long as I choose to pay up.\nThe only thing I'm not all in on is that my master iTunes Library is on an older Mac that I've totally cut off from the internet until I'm confident how my library lasts and how speedy a download of 40 GB will be should I choose to exit the plan.\n\nA: I heard recently that iTunes and Apple music is banned in other countries and is labeled as piracy. I think it's because they don't pay royalties when they sell you a song.\n", "Q: Can I verify if data protection was enabled from a backup? I recently lost my phone but have a very recent backup. I've enabled the remote wipe feature using iCloud but the device has not been online since being lost. It was low on battery power so likely died. \nI'd like to verify that the device was set up to erase the data after X failed passcode attempts. However, I'm having a really hard time finding where in the backup that information would be stored. My suspicion/fear is that it might not be stored at all and thus I have no way to really ensure that it's relatively safe.\nI've already enabled remote erase if it comes online, changed passwords for critical systems and banned the device from multiple services. And while I'm 99% sure I set it up to erase, I'd really like the peace of mind that the last 1% offers.\nMuch appreciated for any responses.\n\nA: You'll not likely be able to establish security after the fact directly. The protection is a combination of the hardware in the iOS device and the setting of a passcode lock and not a preference stored on a filesystem - it's baked into the OS. The backed up data is not encrypted at rest in the same manner as iOS's security. The act of restoring the backup also overrides whatever passcode lock and settings you had, so that's not a good way to proceed.\nWhat you can do is research the exact model of the phone and the version of iOS. Grab this pdf from Apple: http://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf\nStarting on Page 9 it describes the conditions needed for data to be encrypted at rest. It also has valuable information about what types of data is readable if someone guesses your passcode.\nWhat you can do is restore your backup to the same class of hardware and observe that with a passcode set, the data protection is enabled. Hopefully you have an A7 or later processor since the PIN entry is governed by hardware rate limiters to reduce the chance your PIN can be brute forced.\n", "Q: Time machine backup or File Vault encryption of encrypted disk image I have a small encrypted disk image on my Mac (Yosemite), containing account numbers, tax reports and such. I created it using Disk Utility, from folder, which I subsequently safely deleted. I am also doing encrypted TM backups and turned File Vault on - to keep the rest of the files safe.  Could this possibly weaken the encryption of the said disk image on the backup disk or the when the computer is turned off?  (1) Using the login/TM/File Vault password for the disk image (2) Using a different password.\nMy goal is not to strengthen the encryption of the said disk image; only to make sure it's not weakened. The reason for encrypting it separately is that I want it always encrypted - even when the computer is on and I am logged in. \n\nA: If you encrypt something once, you can't weaken it by encrypting it another time. You can strengthen it, but not very much that it makes a big difference. Most attacks are brute force password Crack attacks, on both filevault and the disk image, because there is the highest chance for the decrypter to win. So you harden the step of decryption because you encrypt twice, but you don't harden it much. but btw, best anti brute force tactics are using algorithms like PBKDEF2 instead of simple SHA. but that's something only apple can do. and I expect from them to do something like that. \n", "Q: How to add a confirmation dialog when deleting any item in finder Hi would like to add a \"Are you sure?\" prompt when deleting an item (file, folder) from the finder (like the one when emptying the trash...). \nCan this be enabled?\n\nA: Yes, just lock it!\nRight click the item and Get info, or select the item and hit CMD + i.\n\n\nA: You may configure a folder action:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable view all files:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean true ; killall Finder\n\n\n*Navigate to your user folder\n\n*Right-click the usually invisible Trash folder and choose Services -> Folder Actions Setup...\n\n*Add a new folder action by hitting the +-sign below the right pane and add the script \"add - new item alert.scpt\".

To open a chosen folder hit the right-arrow and continue cycling through your code files. To close a folder hit the left-arrow. The other view options work similar (e.g to open a folder in icon view you have to hit cmd + right-arrow).\nHit the spacebar once more to close the preview window.\nFor some source code files you might have to disable the Xcode QuickView plugin.\nCheck the readme file of QLColorCode to modify the theme and other aspects of syntax highlighting.\n", "Q: Is it possible to develop an app only on specific device size? I now develop my iOS app which I initially wanted to develop on all the device sizes (4, 4.7, and 5.5-inch iPhone and also iPad), but later found that it is insanely painstaking, boring, and tough work to develop on all the sizes using Auto Layout and Size Classes, so I now consider developing only on 4.7-inch iPhone 6. \nHowever, while I can target the iPhone families only (selecting iPhone, not Universal, when starting a project), can I develop only on 4.7-inch iPhone?\nIf it is possible, how can I do? I want to know if it is possible and approved by Apple itself, or is possible but might be subject to the reject by Apple, or is not allowed by Apple. Any link to Apple documentation would be appreciated...\n\nA: Hope this helps you.\nAs of May 1, all new iPhone apps and app updates submitted must support the 4-inch display on iPhone 5. All apps must include a launch image of the appropriate size. Learn more about iPhone 5 support by reviewing the iOS Human Interface Guidelines.\nAnd as per App Store Review Guidelines\n\n2.10\niPhone Apps must also run on iPad without modification, at iPhone resolution, and at 2X iPhone 3GS resolution..Please refer this\n\nElse Apple may reject your app if app is not as per apple review guidelines\n", "Q: No devel block is defined for automake?

On a iPhone 4s my text messages show my email address not my phone number . How do I change it everything I have read is telling me how to do from a newer phone \n\nA: This is a common problem after setting up a new iPhone.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings app.\n\n*Scroll down and select the Messages subsection.\n\n*Tap Send & Receive.\n\n*Scroll down to \"Start New Conversations From\", and select your phone number instead of your email address.\n\n\nHere's an article I wrote a while ago with a discussion on this topic: https://deciphertools.com/blog/2014_06_20_stop_sending_imessage_from_email/\n\nA: Go to \"settings\"- \"messages\"- send & receive then sign out with your apple ID, back out and then go back in. Sign in and it will give you the option to uncheck the email address. Hope it works.\n", "Q: What happens to deleted texts on iCloud? If i deleted a text from my phone and then backed it up to iCloud, is that text now deleted from iCloud?\n\nA: I want to tell you that the text is deleted from iCloud. \nFirst, if your iPhone is charging, using wifi and iCloud has enough space for your iPhone to back up the text, the text would had been backed up. And then you set the manual backup, so the text data has been overwritten by new data.\n", "Q: Adding calendar events on iPhone The calendar new event page which you say should have a \"Done\"  only has cancel or add buttons. Press either and what you have written disappears. No way to save calendar event that I can see\n\nA: The \"Add\" button is the one you want.\nYour phone likely has multiple calendars. It seems like you are currently adding new events to a calendar that is not visible.\nFirst open the calendars app and note the word \"calendars\" on the bottom center (directly above the home button).  Tap the word to configure which calendars are \"visible\".  The calendar that you are currently adding events to is not visible.  You can make all calendars visible simultaneously and you should find the events that \"disappeared\" as you created them.\nThe second setting to be aware of is \"Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > default calendar\"  (currently the last entry on that screen).  This determines which calendar new events are added.  \n", "Q: Less RAM and an SSD vs. more RAM and an HDD? This isn't a question about which part of my computer to upgrade. It's a question about what I should buy in my eventual new computer.\nI have an early 2011 13\" MBP with a 500GB hard drive and an upgrade to 10GB of RAM. Now I'm starting to look at buying a 13\" rMBP with a 512GB SSD, and I'm torn between paying more for the 16GB model or sticking with 8GB, keeping everything else constant (i.e. that's the only part I'm indecisive about). I remembered that a while ago, something I read said that having less RAM but an SSD is comparable to having more RAM and an HDD. Is this true?\nSpecifically, if I've grown used to working on 10GB of RAM, could I get the 8GB rMBP and not experience any serious performance drops because the storage that the RAM is drawing everything from is still so much faster than what I'm used to?\n\nA: It all depends on what type of usage your rMBP will be subjected to. It does help with the SSD and just cutting it off at 8gb(I had a similar setup but with the earlier 15\" rMBPs) if you're trying to save some money but make sure you have enough storage on the SSD(you'll run out fast). Not to mention 2011 RAM speeds are significantly slower than today's.\n", "Q: iPod 5 to iPhone I have an iPod 5. If I block an iPhone user (not sure if the type matters) will they still be able to see the conversations && messages we had before I blocked them? \n\nA: Yes, the old messages will still be there. All blocking them does is ensure that you don't receive any more calls, texts, or FaceTime Audio calls from them.\n", "Q: What is the maximum supported resolution of the MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) for an external monitor at 60hz I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013). It has 8GB Ram and Intel Iris 1536 MB .\nI want to buy a good external monitor, but I can't find a straight answer as to what this model supports with either Thunderbolt or HDMI.\nWhat is the maximum supported resolution of this model for an external monitor at 60hz ?\n(Please note that I don't care about any answers for the 15-inch model or 2015 versions. I only care specifically for the Late 2013 13 inch)\n\nA: According to Apple's MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) - Technical Specifications...\n\nSo it looks like 1080p is the 60Hz limit.\n\nA: I know I am late to this question, but I own the \"MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013)\" with \"Intel Iris 1536 MB\". I am currently using the macbook with the \"Samsung SMS27A850\" according to the system preferences it is currently running at 2560 x 1440 @ 60 Hz using the DisplayPort/Thunderbolt connection (not HDMI).\n", "Q: Macbook boot problems - 1 long beep, then nothing, then it's fine My girlfriend's Macbook (white unibody 2010) is having some problems booting.\nIt can be erratic, but it generally seems to follow this pattern:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn it on, 1 long deep beep, and then nothing (light stays on), turn it off\n\n*Turn it on, nothing (light stays on), turn it off\n\n*Turn it on, boots up as per normal.\n\n\nApparently the 1 long beep signifies a RAM issue, but when it finally boots up all of the RAM is present, and there is absolutely no problem at all with the Macbook - it will run for an entire day without a single crash or problem.\nI've also tried this from the official Apple forum with no joy:\n\nwith the unit plugged into power, hold the power button for 10 seconds. While still holding it, press the left hand shift, control, and option keys for 10 seconds. Let go of those three keys while still holding the power button for 10 more seconds. \n\nAny suggestions on a possible fix please? Thank you.\n\nA: I once had a similar issue with my Mac Mini. Swapping the two RAM Modules seemed to help temporarily, but the issue came back and got more frequent over the next weeks/months. At the end replacing the RAM with another brand fixed it persistently. (It was \"third-party\" RAM from Amazon.)\n\nA: There could be a large number of issues, but as you've said it could be the RAM chips, we should start with the possibility that the RAM has become loose, you should try reseating the RAM...\nI could not describe it better than this iFixIt guide:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Core+2+Duo+RAM+Replacement/512\nWhile you have the RAM out take a photo of the label, it should say how many GB each chip is and what type i.e. PC5300 or whatever.\nFollowing this when you have rebuilt the machine follow the instructions also for a SMC/PRAM reset...\nAgain these instructions are clearer than what I could write:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204063\nAfter this if the issue continues try finding some cheap replacement sticks on eBay and follow the guide to replace them.\nIf the issue persists still after this we'd be looking at more serious issues such as the main logic board, and on a machine of this age there is not much point in any more in depth repairs, however the next step would be to open the top case and check for loose connectors, debris and liquid damage.\n\nA: I know this Thread is a little bit old but I have a similar issue with my MacBook Pro 13\" mid 2009 (it is the same one like yours but just in aluminium unibody case, same Hardware). I only have to do this 5 times until it boots up normal. I switched the RAMs with 2 different ones but it hadn't solved the problem. It is working with no problems after this starting \"procedure\".\n", "Q: Is there a good alternative to Preview specifically for viewing PDF textbooks? Preview is great for working with documents, but it isn't very good at handling large textbook navigation and reading. Performance is surprisingly bad, especially compared to viewing the exact same ebook in iBooks on my iPad. It can't seem to figure out when I want to turn the page and when I want to pan around the current page, even when it's zoomed out completely. Zooming is slow and choppy, and can even crash the app on occasion (this is on a brand new MacBook Pro).\nIt's also quite difficult to open and close the table of contents. Cmd+option+3 to open, cmd+option+1 to close? That's pretty janky, considering I'm opening it almost every time I open the textbook. The shortcut to go to a specific page is also fairly complicated (cmd+option+g), and as far as I can tell there is no way to tell Preview to start numbering pages at a certain point, so all the page numbers are off due to the copyright, table of contents, etc.\nIs there another app out there that solves these problems? \n\nA: Adobe Reader for Mac is my best bet.\nYou can also try Foxit.\n\nA: My recommendation is Adobe (Acrobat) Reader, which is also considered to be the leader of the pack of general purpose PDF viewers as well as smart document PDF viewers on Mac.\n", "Q: How I can install a Homebrew recipe maintained in a separate git repository outside of /usr/local/Library/Formula? I'm writing a quick Homebrew formula for my own private purposes (it's unlikely to be shared). I'd like to install it , but would prefer not to maintain my own local fork of Homebrew, but instead outside /usr/local/Library/Formula (it happens to be within an existing private git repository I have, but I think that's incidental to the question).\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*brew install ./my-formula.rb\n\n*brew install file:///Users/myusername/mygitrepository/my-formula.rb.\n\n\nNeither seems to work. Instead I see:\nError: No available formula for my-formula\n==> Searching formulae...\n==> Searching taps...\n\nHow can I install this formula?\nNote: Installing the formula using git repository syntax is unlikely to be what I need - I'm looking to install the formula during its development, in other words before I commit to my git repo.\nI am using Homebrew 0.9.5.\n\nA: ln -s /Users/myusername/mygitrepository/my-formula.rb /usr/local/Library/Formula/\nbrew install my-formula\n\nBoth brew doctor and brew update shouldn't mind, at least not until a my-formula formula is added into the official brew repository!\n", "Q: Is it possible to use iPhone 6 with FaceTime without a cellular SIM card? I have an iPhone 6 with FaceTime purchased from Saudi Arabia.\nI don't have a cellular SIM in my phone, only a data SIM card.\nMy question now is if I go out of the Kingdom to any other country, will my iPhone get locked? Will my FaceTime stop working even if I'm connected to the internet?\nWill I have to have a jailbreak?\n\nA: I attempted to fix this problem with these troubleshooting steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings -> FaceTime. Enter an Apple ID and login. In the same dialog toggle FaceTime off and then on.\n\n*Open Settings -> Messages. Enter an Apple ID and login. In the same dialog toggle Messages off and then on.\n\n\nI have resolved my problem activating Messages but FaceTime continues to wait for activation. I believe that FaceTime may be waiting for an SMS in order to verify the mobile number. My mobile number shows a busy icon in its Settings dialog.\n\nA: When your iPhone is activated, you could use FaceTime when you are connected to internet. Keep in mind that your iPhone could be simlocked by your provider, and that your iPhone possibly won't work in other countries, see this link to find if your iPhone is supported in the country you want to visit.\n\nA: As I know if your phone can connect to Internet you can use facetime. No matter your SIM card is data or cellular, or even you don't have SIM card, you can use facetime as long as your device can connect to Internet.\n", "Q: Printer connected to Mac only works if other Mac is turned on I have an old iMac G5 with Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and a Canon PIXMA MG5350 printer. It prints without a problem on the old G5. I think the printer is connected via bluetooth.\nAnd now I also have an iMac G6 with Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion).\nI can print on the printer, but only if the old G5 is turned on. Why?\nHow can I change this, so that I can print on the G6 when the G5 is turned off?\n\nA: Probably the printer is connected to your iMac G5 and you are sharing it over the network. If you use this shared printer as your standard printer at the Gen. 6 iMac, it will quit working as soon as you turn off the iMac G5. Connect the printer to you WLAN and configure a new printer at the Gen. 6 iMac. \n", "Q: iPhone 6 Plus Touch ID Sensor developing oily-like \"rainbow colors\" on its surface I've bought my iPhone 6 Plus back in September 2014 and it's Touch ID sensor has been developing \"oily-like\" rainbow colors lately. I've tried cleaning it with water, screen cleaners etc. but it's not going away. Here is a picture of it:\n\nIt's not oily or anything, but it appears so. However, Touch ID is working perfectly, it's just a visual artifact affecting its look, not its operation.\nIs there a way to get rid of that \"layer\", or should it get it replaced under warranty?\n\nA: There is a layer between the sensor and the glass that covers it, sometimes liquids can get in depending on pressure. It looks like an oily substance has seeped in between the sensor and the glass and no cleaning agent will therefore work (I was going to suggests isopropyl alcohol).\nTry your warranty first, it's a cheap replacement at your local shaman otherwise.\n", "Q: Finder \"Open With\" very slow I have the latest version of OS Yosemite (10.10.5) on a very powerful MBP (i7, 2.4, 16GB RAM).\nWhen I right-click on a file in Finder and choose \"Open with\", \"Other\", the dialog window is very unresponsive:\n\n\n*\n\n*it takes time (minutes) to populate the /Applications folder.\n\n*Scrolling the content of the /Applications folder is incredibly slow, the content takes seconds to move when I scroll the mouse wheel and I spend not less than a minute trying to reach the correct application I want to use.\n\n*When I finally reach the correct application and click on it, it takes 1-2 seconds to highlight the item I selected and another couple of seconds to enable the \"OK\" button.\n\n\nThis happens every time I select \"Open with - Other\" and not only the first time.\nIs there anyone who can suggest a solution for this problem, it is incredibly annoying. I have never experienced such a weird behaviour on any OS X version.\nThanks.\n\nA: Try rebuilding the Launch Services database, which populates the Open With menu. It can sometimes get corrupted, which can cause duplicate entries, slowdowns and other weirdness.\nIf you're comfortable with the Terminal, you can do this with a single command:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nOtherwise, a free GUI tool like Onyx can do it at the push of a button.\n", "Q: How to tell a Mac to show 4k resolution or higher resolution even when it is not connected to such display? Sometimes I want to make a screenshot and found that if I do that on a 4k screen, then the screenshot is quite clear (and is in a high resolution).\nSo I can do this when my Macbook Pro is connected to a 4k display.  But let's say if I am on a trip, how do I make the Macbook Pro show or think it is showing in 4k?  I think this is possible even when we don't install any driver or software, because we can plug in a 4k display and choose \"mirror the 2 displays\" and the Macbook Pro native screen will pretend that it is a 4k screen, and any screen capture there will be in 4k resolution.\nSo the question is, if I temporarily don't have a 4k display, say on a business trip, how do I tell the Mac to show the native screen in 4k or even 5k?\n\nA: It depends on which 4K you're referring to; if you're talking about the \"actual\" 4K (4096 × 2160), then: no (though you can come close).\nHowever, if you're talking about the UHD 4K definition (See the link to Wikipedia above), which is 3840 × 2160, you can do it using 3. party utilities such as QuickRes (paid), SwitchResX (paid), or Retina Display Mode (free).\nI've used QuickRes for a couple of years and definitely find it worth the $5. It's also the app I used to test.\nKeep in mind: this only applies to the 15\", the 13\" can \"only\" display up to 3360 × 2100.\n", "Q: How do I trigger caps lock without caps lock key available? My old macbook lost its ctrl key, so I had to remap the caps lock key to ctrl. I have a scenario where I need the caps lock on for a while - is there a way to trigger a caps lock without using the caps lock key?\nI could reset the caps lock, use it, and then remap it back to ctrl, but I am hoping I don't have to do that. I also tried the on screen keyboard viewer, but that does not have a caps lock. \nI am on OS X 10.10.5 and my macbook has an intel processor.\n\nA: Revert the key mapping Caps Lock -> Ctrl. Install Karabiner. Depending on your handedness remap alt_L (or opt_L) to ctrl and use alt_R (or opt_R) as your common alt key.\nRemapping in the Karabiner context using the first example below means:\nif you enable the radio button for \"Option_L to Control_L\" the left Option key will act as the left (and only on most portable Macs) Control key if hit and lose its original Option key function. The right Option key won't lose its function and still works as a normal Option key.\n\nor remap cmd_R to ctrl:\n\nIf you don't like the remapping of alt/cmd/ctrl/R/L there are plenty of other possible remappings to emulate the CapsLock key. Just enter CapsLock in the search field and choose your preferred remapping:\n\nYou may even define your own key mappings (e.g shiftaltcmdC to enable CapsLock and shiftaltcmdR to release it again. These shortcuts mustn't be in use by the system or apps)\n(The screenshots are taken running Lion. Since Karabiner doesn't run in Lion I'm using its predecessor KeyRemap4MacBook. The predefined modifications should be the same)\n\nA: Check Modifier Keys in Keyboard preferences.\nMake sure Caps Lock is set to the correct key, it should then appear on your virtual keyboard:\n\n\nWhen clicked it activates Caps Lock and make all the letters capital on they virtual keyboard.\n", "Q: Change how many 'recent' files are shown in Preview's \"Open Recent...\" menu I cannot find anything in the preferences to do this, but I would like to be able to lengthen the list that Preview offers in the \"Open Recent\" menu. Right now it displays the 9 most recent files. I would like it to show at least 20 or so. Is there some secret way to hack this from the command line, or is there a setting somewhere that  I just haven't been able to find?\n\nA: You can find the option at the bottom of System Preferences > General:\n\nA: Go to System Preferences, then general. 3rd option up you can choose \"Recent items\", it goes up to 50.\n", "Q: Kernel Panic causing crash OSX10.10.5 So I've been having a lot of kernel panics over the past few months, and the apple store says it's not hardware.

USB devices cannot cause a kernel panic, and Java is sandboxed.  Therefore, the only option left is the RAM you chose.\nMacs are MUCH more sensitive to RAM than PCs are.  The RAM you choose must be DDR3 1600MHz and support a CAS latency of 11 at 1.35v.\nIf you purchased RAM that has different specs (even if they're better), then it's not compatible.  Often times, faster memory requires higher voltages or have more relaxed timings to achieve those speeds.  PCs have no problems with this because the SPD chip tells the memory controller what timings the RAM supports.  But because Apple cherry-picks their hardware for their own platform, Macs ignore those settings in favor of the RAM that Apple specifically chose for that model.  The RAM timings and voltage are fixed by the firmware.\nYou don't mention what RAM you bought, but CAS latency and voltage are not the usual marketing specs you'd find when shopping for memory.  You have to specifically look for those specs.  Assuming you bought off-the-shelf RAM, it's likely being undervolted by the power management capabilities of your Mac.  A memtest wouldn't pick up on that because the RAM is good (when it has full power), so all the cells would check out OK.\nIf you did shop around and bought memory specifically certified for your Mac, I'd still blame the RAM and try to have it exchanged.  There's nothing in that panic report that would indicate you have a software problem.\n\nA: For random panics like this, the first thing I'd suspect is faulty RAM or bad third party kernel extensions, badly written applications shouldn't be able to cause kernel panics. From the panic report there don't seem to be any third-party extensions, so I'd check the RAM in your Mac.\nThere are diagnostic tools built into Macs to test, amongst other things, your RAM. Power down your Macbook, then power it on and hold down the D key. This should launch Apple Hardware Test. Within you should find Basic and Extended tests. Try them and see if it finds any problems with your Macbook's RAM.\nYou can read more here.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201257\nIf you want to be really thorough there are other memtest utilities available online, that might find faults that Apple's tests don't.\nhttp://www.kelleycomputing.net/rember/\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/05/03/memtest-mac-ram-test/\n", "Q: Make the screen always be off when having a call Very often when I'm talking on the phone, the screen turns on and my chin and ear presses all the buttons. Often this starts facetime, turn off the sound, and is just very annoying. Is there any way to make the screen always be off when I'm talking? I'm using a regular iPhone 6.\n\nA: Sounds to me like a bad ambient light sensor and/or the proximity sensor. Both are a part of the front facing camera assembly, and you cannot buy them separately. \nIt should be covered under warranty, but if it's a result of a drop or water damage, then it's not covered under the standard warranty and you may have to have it repaired, either by yourself or a pro.\nIf you feel comfortable with the repair, here are some tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*When removing the digitizer assembly (touchscreen) with a suction cup, take extra care to avoid severing the digitizer and LCD cables.\n\n*If you damage the home button or its cable, then TouchID will no longer work.\n\n*Here's the guide\nOf course, you could always take it to a pro, just be prepared to pay likely $100+, unfortunately. Maybe even $150+, depending on where you go.\nIf it's not under warranty, though, wait until the iPhone 6S comes out in less than a couple of weeks, as once the iPhone 6 is no longer the newest, parts and repair costs should be lower.\n\nA: Sounds like you might have a faulty proximity sensor or a case/screen protector that's blocking it.\nEither way, there is no solution unless you jailbreak the device.\nI suggest going to Apple and have them look at it.\n\nA: If you don't want to get the sensors repaired or change how you hold the phone, simply lock the phone once you have accepted the call. \nNow the large problem of face touches is mitigated by the lock screen. \nSome people either have large ear cavities or don't hold the phone stable or close enough for the sensors to know it is by your face. This locking works and you don't need to use earbuds or other remotes to avoid premature hang up, adding a contact, dialing sounds, etc...\n\nA: I was having similar issues after an update.  I fixed it by turning off the night sensor.\n\nA: I was having a similar problem. It appears to be fixed, oddly, after I opened the camera app and used the front facing camera in the dark making the flash work on manual and then auto. I'm not sure if it was not talking to the camera or what the problem was but sometimes its the easiest things that fix it. \n\nA: To check the proximity sensor, you can use Device Doctor (https://itunes.apple.com/vn/app/device-doctor/id1178246735?mt=8). Beside proximity you can check the other functions as well. Good luck\n\nA: another thing that you should try is turning off the \"raise to wake\" button under the heading \"Display & Brightness\" \nThis will stop the phone from activating whilst it is moving around, especially if you are using the headphone and you put the phone in your pocket whilst you speak. \n\nA: another cheap and easy partial fix (at least for the FaceTime part when away from home) is to go into Settings > Cellular and turn off Cellular for FaceTime (in the list of apps at the bottom). My wife has this problem and 99% of the time it's FaceTime that her cheek hits and it's always away from home/wifi.\n\nA: Press the Home and Power button together for 5 seconds. Then restart your phone after few seconds. I hope it will solve the problem. Mine had the same issue and it is resolved.\n", "Q: Printer drivers I have several macs, at home and office (Macbook Pro and Air).\nI have several Canon multipurpose printers as well. The problem is when you attempt to connect the Mac to the Canon printer via USB, it isn't recognized. In the mac printer dialog it says \"Contact the printer manufacturer for drivers\". \nSo you go to the Canon website and try to find drivers for the OSX Yosemite / El Cap and they say \"Apple includes these drivers\".\nHow can I get my printer / scanner working with my mac?\nPrinters are Canon MX310 and Canon MG6620\n\nA: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201465 shows the MX310 as no longer supported, though I can't find any reference on there to the MG6620.  \nCanon appears to have drivers for the MG6620 on their site - http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_mg_series/pixma_mg6220#DriversAndSoftware\n", "Q: macOS detects location but doesn't Set Time Zone Automatically Recently my automatic timezone update stopped working. (i.e. it used to work but now it doesn't)\nThe Troubling thing is that my Mac detects the correct location (e.g. Golden, CO), but it doesn't use this to update the timezone despite Set my timezone automatically using current location being checked. See screenshot.\n\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?\nThis issue now occurs with every network I have tried: work, home, airports, hotels, etc. and, I have already tried the usual set of fixes such as toggling auto timezone off and on, closing system preferences, rebooting, and repairing permissions.\nOS: OS X 10.9.5 (13F1112)\nSystem: MacBook Pro Retina, 13-in mid-2014\n\nA: Apparently at least a few others have had this problem. See [ https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7126456 ]. The only solution found to work in that discussion is to:\nSolution: Re-install the OS. (Yikes!) \nOther attempts in that discussion, including a few beyond those I mention above, didn't work. A new OS install seems rather drastic/painful, so for now I will stick with the \nWork around: Switch to manual timezone control. \nHopefully Apple will push a fix soon for Mavericks users, though perhaps all of the focus is on Yosemite and (soon) El Cap.\nAny simpler solutions still welcome!\n\nA: Here is another work around:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the command line terminal (Launchpad-->Terminal)\n\n*Run the following command:\nsudo ntpdate -u time.apple.com\n(It will ask for your password)\nThat's it! Your clock is now updated with Apple's time server\n\nA: After updating to Mojave some location functions were not working despite being enabled i.e. the precise location in setting the time zone and anty location being reported in 'Find My Mac'  \nThe problem was fixed by following advice to reset accessibility in Terminal (taken from here):\ntccutil reset Accessibility\n\nDoing so fixed the precise location feature for setting the timezone and enabled the location of my computer to be determined in 'Find My Mac' in iCloud (and in 'Find My iPhone' app in iOS) instantly.\n\nA: @drewk's answer worked for me with the addendum that you must have location services turned on and, under the System Services menu, have the Setting Time Zone option ticked:\n\n\nA: This just happened to me on High Sierra. Kept trying to change so that the Mac's location would automatically update the timezone. The Mac could detect where is was (both using the Maps application and the red pin in System Preferences / Date & Time / Time Zone showed the correct location) but the time zone was 'stuck' in the place where I was last week. This continued through reboots and toggling all the options in Date & Time.\nHere was the fix for me. In Bash (ie, launch Terminal):\n$ cd /etc\n$ ls -l localt*\n\nIt should be a link to the IANA timezone database like so (assuming this Mac is near LA):\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  45 Aug 30 17:32 localtime -> /var/db/timezone/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles\n\nIf it is not:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the automatic time zone in System Preferences / Date & Time / Time Zone\n\n*In Terminal sudo rm /etc/localtime to remove the incorrect link\n\n*Reboot (localtime will be recreated)\n\n*Restart automatic time zone in System Preferences / Date & Time / Time Zone\n\n\nThat worked for me after Googling and pulling hair for a few minutes. YMMV. \n\nA: As of today, I run Mojave, Mavericks and Lion: Mavericks and Lion are on the internal drive while Mojave is on the external one. I used to have problems in Mavericks and Lion at different points in time. The solution below takes into account the fact you don't use proxies.\nFor Mavericks and Lion I used to have Spotlight disabled for a long time enabling it only for the macOS I'm working currently in. I don't have an explanation of why it hit Mavericks and Lion but not Mojave but I suspect it's due to the incorrect indexing of metadata across all of the bootable partitions.\nI turned on Spotlight for every partition I boot into turning it off for the other two (e.g., if Mavericks is current then Spotlight disabled for the others). I do it every time I re-boot to one of the 3 partitions. After that Mavericks was able to establish connection with geolocation services and the function is rock solid since then.\nMaybe that helps those of you who struggle to get it working. Try running metadata processes by re-indexing your drive and make sure it's the only bootable partition or, if it's not, that Spotlight is turned only for the current bootable partition.\nI'd be interested to know if this suggestion rectifies this issue.\nUpdate 12 Jan 2021\nI use Squid proxy in Mavericks and Lion on port 3128 and have Spotlight enabled in both. I have no geolocation problems and to disable Spotlight indexing every time I boot from either of these partitions I put a special hidden file in the root folder of the file system.\nALTERNATIVE SOLUTION #2\nMORE LIKELY TO BE THE REAL ONE.\nI suddenly started to have this problem in Lion that along the course of 7 years I use it never showed it but managed to reproduce and solve. To make long story short: if the problem can't be cured by re-indexing the volume the chances are it could arise from a corrupted database cache file in one of lower system-level folders owned by a process named \"locationd\". The specific file I'm referring to is a database file cache.db. In Lion, there's a folder at the path /private/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n00000sm00006d/C. Inside the folder, you'll find clients.plist file that contains information about every process and application granted access to the geolocation services and several db files, cache.db included.  The problem is that macOS doesn't update  it properly if you uninstall an application that had previously used your Mac's geographical position. At the GUI level you see this as a blank icon of the uninstalled application in Security&Privacy settings of System Preferences. Changing the plist alone by deleting corresponding values doesn't lead to the auto-update of the aforementioned\ncache.db file but causes the OS to lose tracks of the location, hence \"Your location is currently undetermined\" message when you're in \"Time Zone\" section of \"Date&Time\" settings pane. The solution is to delete the cache.db file too and re-boot (the reboot is important). After that it may take some time for the system to rebuild the cache.db file but now your location becomes detectable and the red pin is positioned correctly. It now lets applications use your location seamlessly.\nBeware that all above pertains to Lion. In the newer releases, the location of \"locationd\" files and folders may be different and so can be the database file names and their count inside the containing folder with a high probability so you have to investigate on your own: e.g., as of Mojave, the folder in question is at /private/var/db/locationd/ and inside there're hidden files with the \"dat\" prefix in place of cache.db. Use the following command to find the clients.plist file which would point to the enclosing folder that you can open to look inside for cache.db or similar types of files. The command is\nsudo find -Ex /private/var -name *clients\\.plist\n\n\nA: I came here because I had the same issue except on Big Sur (11.3.1) and while @drewk's answer is near-perfect, I was able to skip the reboot by doing the following:\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm /etc/localtime\n\n*sudo ln -is /var/db/timezone/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles /etc/localtime\nAlso, this doesn't seem to address the problem permanently until Apple rolls out a fix .... however, it does allow one to create an easy alias and carry on. Something like\nfunction update_time_zone() {\n    sudo rm /etc/localtime\n    sudo ln -is /var/db/timezone/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles /etc/localtime\n}\n\nPS. Big Sur doesn't seem to have ntpdate as mentioned in this answer\n\nA: Short answer:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that the permission for setting the time zone using location services is enabled (see @Dark Star1's answer)\n\n*Golden, CO uses Mountain Time, so check what permissions the time zone info file for Mountain Time has using ls -l /var/db/timezone/zoneinfo/US/Mountain (it should be 0644 or -rw-r--r--)\n\n*If permissions are not 0644, set them to 0644 using sudo chmod 0644 /var/db/timezone/zoneinfo/US/Mountain\n\n*Go back into System Preferences --> Date & Time and toggle 'Set time zone automatically using current location' off then on again. The timezone should be updated successfully now.\n\nWhy this works:\nmacOS uses tzlinkd to manage timezone changes (not time changes, that's different).\nFiltering in Console.app for errors in tzlinkd then toggling 'Set time zone automatically using current location' in system settings showed me this error (I am in Zurich but have been travelling so the timezone was different. It updated automatically all through my travels though):\ntzlink failed; \"/var/db/timezone/zoneinfo/Europe/Zurich\" has access permissions 100755\nSo I googled for this error and found that the source for tzlinkd expects permissions to be 0644 for time zone info files. Indeed, all time zone files in all subfolders in /var/db/timezone/zoneinfo had permissions 0644... except Europe/Zurich, which was 0755. So I changed it to 0644 using:\nsudo chmod 0644 Zurich\nand toggled 'Set time zone automatically using current location'. Console.app no longer showed errors for tzlinkd, and the timezone was updated correctly.\n", "Q: How can I secure a Retina MacBook Pro to a desk? (similar to how the older MacBook Pro could use a Kensington Lock) I work for a company renting office space from a downtown skyscraper. In order to deter casual theft from building employees and cleaning staff my company prefers we secure our laptops to our desks using Kensington locks. With the last MacBook Pro (the 13\" one with the slot-loading optical drive) this was no problem, as it had the slot for the lock. \nAnd then I asked for (and got) a recent MacBook Pro with Retina. One of the things none of us really thought about was its lack of a slot for the lock. \nSo I've investigated the options and none of them are really confidence inspiring.\nThe prevailing logic is to buy this thing from MacLocks. However, it has very mixed reviews, it requires grafting something onto your rMBP (which, for what its worth, I don't care about for cosmetic reasons, but rather the idea of having to screw something onto the bottom of the thing is a little unnerving), it has very mixed reviews, the website itself looks shady (the JavaScript bot pretending to be a human asking me if I need help is bothersome), and it's sort of expensive ($70) considering all of the above.\nMost of the other options I see are no longer on the market (either for lack of sales or effectiveness, I assume) or are precluded on the idea of things like alarms going off should they be removed (which is going to be pointless if the casual theft were to occur after hours). One solution was a \"locking case\" which reportedly had overheating issues. \nAs it stands now I'm just tossing the thing in a drawer at the end of the night and locking the drawer which is a pain and doesn't allow me to let tasks like app submission go on so I can leave for the day, but it's potentially the only real option other than MacLocks.\nSo what other options are there for locking a rMBP to a desk? Has anyone here tried the MacLocks solution? Or is the rMBP mostly a \"take home at the end of the day or don't worry about it\" device for most people? I'm not taking mine home because I have my own rMBP in my backpack and the nature of what I'm currently doing precludes me from working from home anyway. \nFor what it's worth I did see this question but it's for a MBA, it's four years old, and the accepted solution (loud noise when the adapter is removed) isn't going to work for me as I mentioned above)\n\nA: I know SE is not a place for product recommendations, but this Henge Dock sounds like something that might be useful to you.\nThe dock hugs the MacBook Pro from both sides (inserting a plug into all the available ports), and has a Kensington lock port on the back.\nI do not own this product but I have been considering it.\n\nA: Why not connect a display or cheap display simulator and keyboard to let your Mac run in closed clamshell mode. \nYou can then just get any acceptable locking mesh or physical barrier you chose. Even letting it run in the locked desk is viable and if you were really lazy (like I am), you could run a second power adapter into the drawer. \nAny handy fabricator could make steel or aluminum box or grates you could bolt onto the desk where convenient. A nice solid padlock would be far more secure than anything that emulates a small Kensington slot. \nThe MacLocks bracket is quite elegant IMO and uses the screws that secure the bottom case to secure the locking shim to the MacBook frame. There is nothing shady there and it's better than a Kensington slot which seems to meet your business expectations for adequate protection. \nIf you save 5 minutes each work day, it's hard to see $70 being expensive unless your hourly rate is minimum wage. \n\nA: There is currently no good solution.\nThe wedge and screw replacements are easily defeated.\nMaybe violate taboo by getting a very good machinist and mill in a micro K-slot. While you're at it, retrofit with MagSafe 1 (just kidding, but it would be nice).\n\nA: Mitigation and deterrence instead of prevention\nLocks make it harder would-be thief to take your stuff, but it is not the only way to reduce theft-related risks.\nPublicly visible cameras, among other things, would signal to a would-be thief that they are likely to be caught and thus deter theft - especially if the building is not completely public, and the cleaning staff and employees of other tenants wouldn't expect to be anonymous there.\nAnd assuming that most data is constantly securely backed up online (which may not be the case for you, but is so for many configurations) it may well be that simple insurance is cheaper than fancy $70-$399 locks, and it also would protect you from other risks than theft.\n", "Q: Securely remove personal information, without reinstall on Yosemite?

That is their decision and I will comply by not reformatting.\nI will be leaving the company and would like to remove any of my sensitive personal data from the machine. \n(I've searched other questions which are either out of date or point to complete reformat. This is not an option. This question is the most analogous, but is for a different operating system version and is almost 2 years old. The upvoted answer references FileVault, which I don't think covers the personal data areas I am concerned with.)\nI will follow the above mentioned question and complete these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move out all important data\n\n*Delete my old account (and entire home directory)   \n\n*Create a new account for the new owner\n\n*Delete unused space in Disk Utility\n\n*Delete Spotlight index\n\n*Delete/var/db/locate.db\n\n\nI will also follow the deauthorization steps mentioned in this answer.\nHowever, I am concerned about other areas of data (like dropbox settings, synced drives, saved wifi/network information, saved network computers, keychains, saved cellphone mac address from Adobe Edge Inspect etc). That might be stored elsewhere.\nMy question: \nWhat additional areas of the machine should I be sure to clear, and how can I do so?\nAlso, is there an Apple-updated guide for this sort of thing, that might stay relevant when AskDifferent questions fall out of usefulness?\n\nA: You are on the right track. With modern storage, the value of secure wipe is so little, I prefer to just write files over the free space. \n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new account - do this before deleting yours. \n\n*Download Rick Astley movies to the new user until space fills.\n\n*Delete your user account - choose to delete the files\n\n*Perform \"paranoid\" log cleaning and purging of system keychain items you feel are personal\n\n*Use Disk Utility to securely wipe free space. (Optional)\n\n*Continue to download videos and then hand in the Mac as ordered. \n\n\nIf you need help with http://brew.sh to download Rick Astley, please (pretty please) ask that and I'm sure someone can provide a nice script to get some youtube-dl going and then copy the files again and again to fill up space nicely. \nSpotlight won't contain anything at that point you care about. If you are paranoid:\nsudo periodic daily weekly monthly\nsudo rm /var/vm/*\n\nInspect the /var/log folder and srm or truncate / delete everything you find. \nAn alternate method would be to use Time Machine to only back up the files you choose to restore and not mess with filling space. For every file you wish to check:\ntmutil isexcluded /path/to/SystemKeychain.key\n\nYou can build up exclusions to your satisfaction and then make one backup once you've normal deleted all private files that are not excluded by rule. They you're free to wipe everything / fill up everything and then install a totally clean OS and use the migration assistant to migrate back just the company files that you've backed up. \nUnless you're going to do this multiple times, it's probably not a big difference in the amount of effort it would require you to implement either of these choices. Pick the strategy that makes more sense to you. \n", "Q: OS X 10.10.5 Preview App Highlight drop down menu is greyed out on OS X 10.10.5 in my preview.app. \nI understand that's where the Alpha tool is?

It is clear from other posts that AirDrop \"uses\" Bluetooth Low Energy to \"find\" other AirDrop enabled devices. How does it do this? Specifically, how does an apple device differentiate between just another bluetooth device and one with airdrop enabled?\nIt could 1) try to pair with every transmitting device, 2) use the bluetooth friendly name, 3) additional data in the radio without pairing?\nThe BluetoothDeviceInfo structure that comes back from creating a radio on the Microsoft stack doesn't include any identifying info besides the Friendly Name: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa362924%28v=vs.85%29.aspx \nThe other possibility is that it tries to pair with all broadcasting bluetooth devices - but that could be slow. \nThanks for any help and/or insight!\n\nA: I thought I would share what I found in case this information can shortcut someone else's learning.\nBluetooth Low Energy is a completely different Spec than older versions of bluetooth. There are completely different APIs from Microsoft to support BT LE: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj159880%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\nUnlike older versions of bluetooth, a BT LE \"Peripheral\" device (sending device) can advertise it's capabilities so that a connecting device (Also known as a \"Central\") can tell what the Peripheral is capable of without actually connecting/pairing with the Peripheral.\nThe capabilities of a Peripheral are communicated using a Generic Attribute Profile, or GATT for short. \nPer my previous question, the BluetoothDeviceInfo structure is part of the older Microsoft API for bluetooth supporting non-BT LE devices: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363058%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\nAlso, the C# 32feet.net library to help with Bluetooth does not support BT LE.\nI hope that helps someone.\n", "Q: My iPhone will not turn on.

I have pressed the lock and home button for atleast 30+ seconds and nothing is happening. I've tried leaving it on charge Abit more, and still nothing. It's just a black screen. I've only had my phone for nearly 8 months and I was wondering would Apple fix or replace it? I have a 12 month warranty. I am very curious and I would like some further advice. \n\nA: take it to the Apple Store, they'll be able to fully diagnose the issue, perhaps its a battery not holding a charge properly.

I pressed \"Install\" and it said \"Installing\". Did I just BUY the app AGAIN? Is it linked with my iPhone apps?\n\nA: App Store on iPhone or in iTunes is specific to iOS. If you are buying an application from there will run on iOS devices only, not on OS X. Similarly Mac App Store is exclusive for OS X apps. You cannot buy an app from App Store on iPhone and transfer it to Mac App Store.

If you open an iPhone you will notice that the digitizer panel is connected to the motherboard by means of several ribbon cables. However the home button shows tho dedicated contact terminals.\nWhy didn’t they include the button in the ribbon cables? Is there an electrical reason for that? Or do you think is just a matter of cable routing. But in the latter case, why is it so difficult to redirect the terminals into the ribbon or, conversely, why don’t they use contact terminals for everything? They seem much more practical and space efficient.\n\n\nA: Speculation as none of us are Apple engineers and if we were, I doubt they could freely talk about it.\nBut the most likely reason is that allows for separation of parts, easier assembly and a lower replacement cost. Had the home button, which in the pictured 4G iPhone is a simple button and not the newer fingerprint camera, been using a fpc, it would require a connector at the top like the others. The top of the iPhone is pretty full as is. It would also add another failure point in assembly as the flex cable at the top is likely to get pinched. And it would have likely been made part of the display assembly meaning a broken button would mean replacing a 100 + display.\n", "Q: Why do I feel 'electricity' when bridging my macbook and a double insulated charger? Let me set the scene:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook with metal case plugged into the wall with 3 pronged plug\n\n*iPhone is plugged into an iPad charger with 2 prongs\n\n\nWhen I touch both my iPhone and the case of my macbook I perceive a mild 'electric shock' which continues as long as I am touching both devices.\nI assume that there is an air gap in the iPad charger so there should be no current flowing between the iPhone and the macbook.\nI can't make any sense of what's going on and if someone could school me as to what's happening I'd be very grateful.\n\nA: Most switching power supplies use an EMI filter on the front, that looks like this:\n\nThe \"ground\" is connected to the \"ground\" on the secondary side as well as the earth pin on the plug. If the plug has no earth pin (or the socket does not have it), then when you touch it and an earthed object, a small current flows trough caps C2 and C3.\nIn most power supplies there is also a small capacitor bridging the primary and secondary windings of the transformer (again, for EMI reasons).\n", "Q: deleting emails on both my laptop and iphone I have an outlook exchange account that I use on my MacBook Pro and it is synched with my iPhone.  Until the newest update, when I delete a message on my laptop it also deleted it on my phone but recently it is only deleting on my computer!  Help . . . how do I get it to automatically delete both places?\n\nA: As long as both are st up as Exchange accounts (rather than POP or IMAP) both of these \"views\" should be looking at the account on the same server. Exchange is similar (if not based on) IMAP where all work is done on the server and only cached on the local device unless specifically downloaded.\nWhat I would do is log into your OWA web interface (outlook web access) and see what shows up in the various mailboxes there. The web client doesn't cache significant data so that is a close to a live view of what is in your account. Look at both Outlook on your Mac and (presumably) the mail.app on your iPhone and see what is closest to the reality of the web interface.\nWhichever seems to be the most wrong, delete the account on that device and re-add it. That will usually force a re-sync and bring both apps up to date with the server.\nNote that I used to use the IOS mail.app for my Exchange (work) email until I discovered Microsoft's (free) Outlook client for IOS. I have been using that for the last year (give or take) and find it works a bit better than the built-in IOS mail.app when connecting to Microsoft Exchange servers.\n", "Q: clone and boot from segment I have an external hard drive with a case. It is an older computer’s hard drive. To use certain software, I have to boot from that hard drive but since I am running the computer from an external hard drive with a usb cable, it runs pretty slow. \n\n\n*\n\n*Mac has 500 GB drive ??? available\n\n*USB is OS X 10.6.8 and 500 GB drive with 240 available (260 GB space filled)\n\n\nI’d like to transfer it to a section of my hard drive and have the option off booting from that section/drive. Do you know of tutorials that can tell me how to do this or do you know how?\n\nA: What you are trying to do is called dual booting and your \"segment\" is actually what is referred to as a \"disk partition\" or just \"partition.\" This is nothing more than a logical segmenting of the disk. While the data is all on one drive the operating systems will see it as two (logical) drives.\nI have not done a Dual boot Mac in a long time so take this (overview) with a grain of salt and do some googling on dual booting your Mac with two Mac OS partitions (there will be a lot with Windows and Linux, ignore those).\nBasically you would boot into recovery mode (COMMAND-R) at startup and go into Disk Utility. In Disk utility you should have the option of re-sizing your main Mac partition by clicking on it and dragging up to make it shorter. It will only allow you to resize the partition by removing unused space. How much you will be able to resize depends on how big your drive is and how much of it is used.\nOnce you have done that you should be able to create a second partition. Once that is done you can boot from your install media and point the installer to your new partition. Once that is done you can use the Apple Migration Assistant to move selected files/apps to the new partition from your old external drive.\nAgain this is a 30 mile view. No doubt others have more recent experience with this and can add to (and correct) the basic procedure here. But it is basically possible but like bmike mentioned knowing the relative sizes of your drives and available space will help...\n", "Q: How would I preserve only a certain user account while doing a secure wipe of my MacBook Pro? I have a MacBook Pro with a separate user account for work-related stuff.  Suppose I am required by contract to use reasonable means to destroy all copies of data that I had access to while performing the contract.\nWhat is a reasonably secure way to wipe a single account off the machine so it's practically impossible to recover the data from that account?  Is it sufficient to simply delete the account and its contents?  (My laptop has an SSD and I presume the firmware's write optimizations make it more difficult to recover deleted data than on magnetic media.) If not, does it make any difference if I'm using FileVault?  If that still isn't secure enough, then what about deleting the account, doing a full-backup of the remaining account(s), formatting the SSD, and restoring the backup?  Presumably the backup would not include any data from the previously-deleted work account...right?  Or is there some other recommended way to selectively wipe a user account on a Mac laptop?\n\nA: I would do the following: from your other admin account, delete that corporate user account in SysPrefs/Accounts.  I believe when you delete an account you have the option to leave the home folder where it is, which I would choose.\nThen I would delete that account's home folder via the Terminal.app command rm -R -P /Users/TheAccountToDelete.\nfrom man rm:\n-P          Overwrite regular files before deleting them.  Files are overwritten\n             three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff, then 0x00, and then\n             0xff again, before they are deleted.\n\nI am not sure if leaving FileVault on or off is the best way to accomplish this - test it out on a dummy user account first!\n\nA: In situations like this, I would create an encrypted disk image and store all stuff/data related to this contract in that image. If Mail is involved as well, I would also move ~/Library/Mail into that image and create a symlink in ~/Library to let Mail.app think everything is in order. Once the contract is done, simple delete the encrypted disk image and destroy the key (actually destroying the key would be enough). \n\nA: As you have FileVault enabled, a sure way to destroy any critical data is\n\n\n*\n\n*delete the account and its data\n\n*create a backup (just to be safe)\n\n*disable FileVault\n\n*wait until the disabling is finished\n\n*reenable FileVault (which creates a new key)\n\n\nIf you also run TimeMachine or similar, you may also need to remove the critical data from there (which may be not as easy as it sounds). \n", "Q: My phone transformed into my dad's phone HELP!

I'm working with a 2013 iMac running with the newest Yosemite. There was something wrong on my system which required that I erase the internal HD and do a clean install. Fine. But when I use Migration Assistant to bring back the data it doesn't allow me to select, say, iTunes apart from all of my other \"documents\". That's a problem for two reasons:\n1) It will take more than 24 hours to reinstall\n2) It might add on whatever file corrupted my previous system.\nI just got off the line with Apple Support and they had nothing apart from their manual, and my question was off manual.\nWhat I would like to do is enter the existing copy of the TM backup so that I can selectively restore the files I know are not corrupt, like iTunes.\nThere must be some way to do this. I can't imagine Apple creating a backup plan where you'd put a corrupt OS back onto your system. Or it there another way, say through Terminal? My backup is 2TB and I'd prefer my computer not be out of commission for a full day while possibly corrupts files get loaded back into it. \nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: Typically the migration assistant doesn't copy system files from your backup.  But you're right that maybe one of your home-folder's installed files (a PrefPane or something) could have caused your problem.\nI would still run the full Migration Assistant (just let it run for however long it takes), and hope that the problem doesn't come back.  This is typically the case.\nIf you problem does come back, then you know it stems from your home folder, in which case you can boot while holding Shift down, to disable all non-essential extensions/plugins.  Then you can remove all 3rd party files from /Users/HOME/Library/PreferencePanes, LaunchAgents, LaunchDaemons, QuickLook, Services or whatever type of error you think was happening.\n", "Q: To give priority to .tex files in Spotlight search?

I went down a rabbit hole to get an encrypted $HOME working, and so I still use it, but FileVault is superior in just about every way.\nI wrote up an article detailing how I did this. I'd post the vital steps here, but it is a fairly long and involved process.\nHere's the gist of it. You need to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Format a USB drive\n\n*Add a keyfile (max 1023 chars) to that drive\n\n*Create a core storage volume somewhere\n\n*Encrypt that core storage volume with your keyfile\n\n*Migrate files to your new encrypted home\n\n*Create a Launchd task that runs a mount script on boot\n\n*Create that mount script.\n\n\n*\n\n*The mount script will read the keyfile from your USB drive\n\n*The mount script will attempt to unlock your core storage volume using the contents of the keyfile\n\n*The mount script must unmount the core storage volume from /Volumes\n\n*The mount script must mount the core storage volume to /Users\n\n\n*Unmount the USB drive so the keyfile isn't just sitting there\n\n\nIt took me a lot of trial and error.\nThere are probably ways to improve my steps like using an exported keychain rather than a plain text keyfile. You could probably also re-define the location of $HOME for your user in System Preferences, but I opted to mount the encrypted home over the normal home so that the path would be standard.\nI tried changing $HOME to /Volumes/THE_ENCRYPTED_DRIVE, but I immediately noticed things like my iTunes library were messed up. All the library file references were stale and needed to be updated. That's an example of how screwing with $HOME can get messy.\nReally, FileVault would be way easier if you can get it going. If FileVault is not an option, you should check out VeraCrypt, which is a fork of TrueCrypt that was recently audited and seems legit.\n", "Q: Macbook turns off after booting My Macbook was running fine today, but then powered off while I was away from it. After this, I can't get it to stay on. It turns on and then stays on for 2-3 minutes, before powering down again.\nIt's a MacBook 13-inch Mid 2010 model, running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.\nIt's managed to reach my desktop before powering off, so doesn't seem to be a problem with booting.\nI've tried taking the battery out and running it from the power cable, but this also didn't do anything.\nI've also tried starting in single user and safe mode, neither or which helps.\nAny ideas??\n\nA: This sounds like something that happened to my MacBook Pro 15\" Early 2011, stayed on white screen for couple minutes then turned off again.\nTook it to Apple and they came to the conclusion that my motherboard wasn't working so I had to get it fixed for $500 (£250 ish) and after that ever since works perfectly fine.\nThe cause of my problem was that it could of been my old charger (was falling apart, and so Apple replaced it for free) could of sent an electric charge that fried my motherboard.\nHope this relates or helps you to fix your issue.\n\nA: Does it always boot fully? That is, does it always make it to the desktop or does it sometimes crash/turn off while it is booting? If it's consistent, then it seems more likely that there's a software problem behind this. Have you looked at the logs in Console (Applications > Utilities > Console) to see if you can find anything suspicious? That's where I would start.\nIf it is inconsistent, I'd start with examining the hardware. You can run limited using Apple Hardware Test:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257\nI believe for a 2010 Mac you'll find the test on one of the discs that came with your computer.\n", "Q: Where in iOS 9 Beta 5 is the iTunes Store App?

In some situations I would open my macbook in a public place or library, and I still have something open that produces sound, such as music or a chat program giving notifications. I would like to have my sound be muted by default when I open the lid. Anyway to achieve this?\n\nA: Have you tried muting the sound?\n\nMuting the sound before closing the lid and/or rebooting will keep the sound muted.\nI also found this: Mute volume of macbook on sleep\n\nA: Control Plane is ideal for this sort contextual computing. It's a free, open source app in which you can configure a context. For example a context 'library'. In that context certain rules apply (i.e. mute device). The context can be automatically triggered by numerous things (i.e. sleep/wake event, connected wifi, running applications, ...)\nIt is useful in many other situations as well, I use this app extensively.\nHere is how you can configure Control Plane to do what you asked for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new context and give it an appropriate name (i.e. muted)\n\n\n*Under Evidence Sources make sure Sleep/Wake Event is checked\n\n\n\n*Under Rules add a new Sleep/Wake Event Rule and set it so when system goes to sleep it activates the muted context with the confidence slider set to 100%.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Under Actions add a Mute action (Sound and Music Actions > Mute). Set it so that system is muted on arrival at context muted.\n\n\n\nThere you go. You could of course make the context switch to Muted more intelligent by using and combining different rules (each with its own confidence level).\n", "Q: What if someone knows my iPhone passcode (not simple passcode) & restriction passcode? Lets say I was just taking a walk or was in a train or a bus. I had to unlock my iPhone with passcode there and use the restriction passcode. Somehow a person saw me entering the passcode and I realised that I was watched and that was after a long time.\nCan that person do anything like remote access (SSH, VNC) or something about encryption keys? Lets say that person has access to a backdoor to my cellular carrier & also knows my phone number (this means all my plain HTTP traffic, DNS queries, SMS, calls and other things can be seen, I am ignoring privacy policies here).

I want to edit file attachment like pdf and txt file in oneNote directly and save all the changes, but all the file attached in the oneNote when opened is automatically locked, I uncheck the lock option but the change not save into the file\nHow can I solve this irritating issue\n\nA: It is not possible right now, because files attached to OneNote-notes are always read-only copies in the current version. If you edit them, Mac OS X saves the changes to a copy of the file in a location you can choose. To update the online copy of your file with your changes, you'd have to remove the old version of the file from the note and attach the copy with your new changes to it.\n", "Q: zero pad numbers in `cal` (or `gcal`) output?

That works… except if the number is on Saturday, or Sunday, because then there's no leading/trailing padding.\nSo I'm at a loss. I even looked at GNU cal which seems to have a bazillion options, but I couldn't find one for this.\nI'm sure there's a way to do this with sed/awk/tr/etc but I can't figure it out.

Any ideas on how I might be able to open my database?\n\nA: Check the \"archived software downloads\"-section on their homepage here. There is a section for Bento v1, 2, 3 or 4, your product should be included as well. For example, try downloading Bento v4.1.2 from here ;)\n", "Q: Inexplicable change of email address I found an email in my sent mailbox which had gone to a completely different and unrelated address from the one I'd entered by tapping the reply button on the original email I was answering  I hadn't gone anywhere near my address book so the change of the intended address is absolutely inexplicable.  Is there a bug that does that?  I'm using the Apple Mail application on a new Macbook Pro with Yosemite.\n\nA: This is probably connected with a \"reply to\"-address provided with the email you received. For example, many companies use this when sending automatic generated e-mail from an address that doesn't receive e-mails. When you reply to such mail, your application checks if there is a \"reply to\"-address provided in the message's head, and if it is, it will choose that for your reply over the senders address. If your mail was not from a company but from a friend, this could be a bug or mistake in his mail application, maybe he provided such a reply-to-address to. Some applications do this when a feature to collect all mail in a single inbox is chosen. If none of these apply, you should check the authenticity of the sender's address, and maybe talk to him on the mail you received, as this could also be a sign of spam messages.\n", "Q: 2013 MacBook Pro crashed, won’t restart I was using Firefox when my MacBook Pro crashed.  I was not initially concerned, as it does this about once a month.  However, it no longer starts.  It had 80% battery when it crashed, and plugging it in does not help.  Before I take it to the shop or take it apart, I hope someone here can offer a solution.\nIt is a 2013 MacBook Pro running the latest version of Yosemite.\nEdit:  The computer restarts after several hours, but crashes again later.  I sought professional advice and was informed that the logic board needed to be replaced, because the not-restarting bit is apparently symptomatic of an overheated logic board.  But the problem resumed two days after a new logic board was installed.\n\nA: Have you ever tried to reset NVRAM or PRAM (older Mac)? With Mac turned off, power on the Mac, then press and hold CMD (⌘) + Option (⌥) + P + R until restart itself, this should take a couple of seconds.

If restoring doesn't fix the issue, contact Apple Support or take your iPhone to an Apple Retail Store or Authorized Service Provider.\n\n\nA: You should try to restore your iPhone to factory settings and completely wipe the software. Make sure you back up everything you need, e.g. your photos or contacts, since everything will be overwritten during this process. Then make sure you have the latest version of iTunes installed on your computer, if you have a Windows Machine, search for \"Apple Software Update\" in your Applications, or download the latest version of iTunes from the Apple Homepage https://apple.com/itunes. On a Mac you'd just have to check \"Software Update\" (in the Apple menu at the top left) until OS X 10.6., or the App Store (from OS X 10.7). Then connect your device, open it in iTunes and click \"Restore Firmware\". It will do a complete software update, follow the onscreen instructions, and everything should be fine afterwards.\n\nA: Happened to me with new phone. I turned it off and back on and it is fine.\n\nA: My iPhone 5 was not receiving or making calls and I noticed that my TTY was turned on (phone icon in top right corner). I turned TTY off by going to Settings > General > Accessibility > TTY. You will need to turn off both Software and Hardware TTY buttons. My phone had also somehow (we will not speculate how) got International Roaming turned on and I never travel outside the country, and no children have been playing with my phone. But I turned this off by going into Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options > Turn off Roaming/International Roaming.\nThe combination of these two things fixed my iPhone 5 and I can now call and be called. There was no unusual activity on my phone or no one playing with it when all of a sudden one day I woke up and my phone wouldn't call out or get calls. After 36 hours of searching and reading and resetting and a million other things nothing worked but this. Again, still don't know how they got turned on but they are now off.\n", "Q: OSX install DVD showing up as EFI boot on start up My brother's Mac Pro somehow has all of its utilities missing. Its guts have been taken out. I don't know how this happened, but I'm trying to fix that by creating a Lion DVD or bootable USB. I extracted the installesd.dmg from the app and went through the procedure to create a bootable USB, but the USB didn't show up at all on my own Mac and only showed up as EFI boot on my brother's. After that I tried burning the image onto a DVD and that showed up fine on my mac when I pressed the option key on start up. Tried on my brother's, but I got EFI boot again. \nIs there any way around this problem? If there's no way I can do a new install of OSX, can I somehow get the guts of the current installation back in? \n\nA: You can always update your Mac OS Software by downloading the latest release (usually Yosemite) from the App Store. You don't need to create any bootable media, since the installation can be downloaded on the target device itself and will be installed after a reboot (onscreen instructions). The new installation should always bring back all of the utilities you might be missing now.\n", "Q: Where Is Darwin's ARP Cache? The Linux kernel generally tends to cache its ARP tables here:\n/proc/net/arp.\nDarwin & Mac OS X, however, do not seem to follow the same convention.\nSo where can I find the Darwin & Mac OS X equivalent of:\n/proc/net/arp?\n\nA: OS X doesn't cache things on /proc so there's no equivalent exposure of kernel data through the filesystem idiom.\nYou can call arp -a to dump the current table to the location of your choosing if that sort of DIY caching has benefits for your code or use case. \n\nA: It looks like the cache on OS X isn't stored anywhere. An inspection of the arp command reveals no open data files during runtime, and man 4 arp claims that the cache is dynamically created.\n", "Q: Problem with storage and iPad glitches Recently my iPad (running on 0.7.0)has been glitching a lot lately.It says there is a message that I haven't read even though there isn't any.I have also bought 200GB storage to have space and update apps but when I try it says I don't have any space and I only have one app that I need to update.\n\nA: I guess the Space you bought is iCloud space? That space is not used for your local apps, local music, local photos etc. The iCloud space is just for everything stored online, e.g. your mail, your online photos, or data of apps that sync across devices. If you have glitches in the usability of your device, you should reinstall the Software. Make sure you back up everything you need, e.g. your photos or contacts, since everything will be overwritten during this process.

I'm using a deactivated SIM card. I would like the card to remain deactivated. This is on an iPhone 5S and iPhone6.\n\nA: I faced this problem before. You can try to use this trick:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings ~> Message and Turn Off iMessage + Facetime.\n\n*Turn on the Airplane Mode.\n\n*Turn on Wi-Fi.\n\n*Turn on iMessage like the first step. The system will ask you for your Apple ID If it is not added yet.\n\n*Turn Off the Air Plane Mode.\n\n*iMessage should work properly now.\n\n\nSource.\n\nA: Take out the SIM card, this should fix it. If it's not activated, you shouldn't need it anyways ;) I've often used iPhones without an activated SIM card, and after taking these out, the pop ups stopped ;)\n\nA: Just take out the SIM card.\nI have an iPhone 5c and it got really annoying having the \"Your iPhone is not activated\" message every 10 minutes. I took out my SIM card with a needle (because the iPhone 5c is different than other phones).\nI haven't seen the message since.\n", "Q: How is data added to the Health app? I've been very late at updating my phones / OSes. \nNow there's a new app called \"health\" that I have no idea how to use. I usually understand Apple products and apps very quickly, but I am at loss of ideas on how one adds data to the graphs in the Health app. Can the iPhone itself track your steps / physical activity? Or do I need other hardware such as watches and things like that?\n\nA: It depends on your iPhone model. The iPhone 5S and later is equipped with a motion co-processor, such as the M7 in the 5S or the M8 in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. You can give Health permission to read data from the motion co-processor.\nAlso, any data from your Apple Watch (if you own one) is stored in Health. So heart rate, steps taken, walking + running distance, active calories, etc. are counted automatically.\nAdditionally, 3rd-party apps can use Health to log any appropriate info about your health and activity into the app, such as Nike Running or an app that can detect your pulse using the camera in your iPhone.\nYou can also log data into Heath and modify data yourself within the app.\n\nA: Even if you don't have an iPhone 5s that can automatically track your steps, etc., you can still use Health.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use a workout app like RunKeeper or Strava when you go for a run/ride, your phone should be able to track your distance with GPS. It can then save your distance traveled, calories burned, etc. to Health.\n\n*You can also use Health to record other data you're interested in, like tracking your sleep duration.\n", "Q: Apple Watch pairing prompts for old Apple ID password When I paired my Apple Watch with my iPhone it asked for me to login to my Apple ID.\n\nLater while configuring Messages on the watch it asks for my password again.\n\nHowever, the Apple ID in each is different, none of my current or previous Apple ID passwords succeeds at this prompt, and I am forced to hit Cancel to proceed.\nSeveral months ago I changed my Apple ID from cory@coryklein.com to coryfklein@gmail.com and I assume Apple has retained the older ID somewhere in association with Messages.\nMessages on my MacBook is using the correct ID.\n\nMy iPhone is using the correct ID as well.\n\nUnfortunately, this appears to be causing the Messages app on the Watch not to sync with my phone.

Target display mode appears to require a <4K ThunderBolt or DisplayPort connection. Apple TVs exclusively use HDMI output, but Apple sells ThunderBolt to HDMI adapters. I was wondering if it would possible to use one of those to display Apple TV content on an iMac. However, these adapters always seem intended for use with ThunderBolt input and HDMI output.\nI don't know if it's possible to use any adapters to produce ThunderBolt output. Even if it is, I'm not clear whether the iMac can be used with arbitrary ThunderBolt video input, or whether it requires some additional metadata or protocol that must come directly from another Mac.\nIs there any iMac which may be used in target display mode be used as the display for any Apple TV, with the right configuration and adapters?\n\nA: Displayport is the protocol for video over thunderbolt.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/thunderbolt/\n\nhttp://www.cablestogo.com/product/54179/hdmi-to-displayport-adapter-converter\nGet the above converter and then connect the cables with whatever cheap adapters and cables are required to fit all the physical connections.

Have deleted my full account in mail, then added again the same account (after checking on webmail that all folders are still there) and it took a while to get all emails back but it seemed to work. Everything is back again, including the original folder structure. Does anyone know how I can trace these emails in Finder?

I'm looking for a solution here, since my computer's hard drive is pretty well full.\nI want to be able to store my music library in iCloud (or some other cloud if it's more suitable). \nHowever, if I do this, will it still allow me to store some of that music content (select playlists or albums) on my iPhone, so that I can listen to them without streaming through the iCloud?\nThanks for any answers you can give!\n\nA: You can tell iOS to store a playlist, an album, an artist or a specific title offline. It will then download the tracks directly to your device and allow you listening to them without any internet connection.\nThis works with Apple Music as well as iTunes Match.\n\nA: Yes. Plug the phone in to iTunes and select the music on the iPhone to play and it will access the files while connected. \nThere is a toggle for wifi sync, but I haven't tried to see if music playing works over wifi from iOS to iTunes. \nAnother slick option is turning your computer into an AirPlay receiver:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use a Mac Mini as an Airplay audio receiver?\nIt all depends if you need iTunes to control the playing or just want the sound coming out of the computer. \n", "Q: Keep Mac ON for background work with minimum power Say I am doing a long download.

Therefore, the only options are within System Preferences. \nIn this case, you should set your Energy Saver settings to Computer Sleep- Never, and Display sleep - 1 min. Check the box for 'put hard disks to sleep when possible'. Wake for network isn't helpful, since your computer will not sleep.\n", "Q: How to quickly launch a playlist from the home screen in ios? I want to have a \"shortcut\" on the home screen that launches\nthe music app and starts playing a specific playlist.\nCan this be done?\nI did some research and it seems like Launch Center Pro could do the trick, except the music app is not supported.\nI also found an old blog post that mentions the use of URL schemes for ecoute (music player) but it seems outdated as well.\n\nA: Slightly overkill for just this one task, but Workflow can certainly do this--there's already a workflow in its Gallery that does this, so you won't even have to write your own. And you'll probably find other cool stuff to do with it too ;)\n\nA: Launcher with Notification Center Widget by Cromulent Labs\nWill launch any playlist from Notification Center.  \n", "Q: El Capitan UI smoothness on Intel Iris? is there anyone who have already tried El Capitan GM on 2013 MBPr (Intel Iris, integrated video)? I'm experiencing freezes and UI smoothness issues with my MBPr 13 late 2013 on Yosemite, so now I'm really doubt about installing the El Capitan, which possibly will bring even more performance issues.\n\nA: My Mac Mini 2014 has an Intel Iris Pro graphics. Upgrading from Yosemite to El Capitan definitly improved the overall smoothness. Resizing Finder windows is buttery smooth, for example. Switching the preference panes is just as smooth as it was on Mavericks.\nIt's noticable in about all applications.

How can I find out the size of a video file on my iPhone 6 camera roll without connecting it to a computer.\n\nA: The Shortcuts app made this actually rather easy nowadays. Configure it as an extension for the share sheet, then activate it in any video (or photo) within Photos.\n\nPS: Shortcuts is part of recent versions of iOS. For first time users it might help to have a look at the Shortcut Manual.\n\nA: Another 3rd party app option is the Google Photos application.  You can click a photo or video and select 'info'.  It doesn't require initiating an upload and then canceling it.\nI wish this was built into the native iOS Photos app, but at least Google Photos is free and comes from a reputable vendor.\n\nA: Both OneDrive and Dropbox etc. show you the file size as soon as you start to upload the video. Once you've glanced at the video size,  there's nothing stopping you from cancelling the upload right away so you dont spend unnecessary data.\nAn option that needs no upload is the View Exif app extension - it will process the video file on your phone/iPad and tell you the size of the video and no need to leverage another service.\n\nA: I have created an easy and complete iOS Shortcut inspired by @nohillside.\n\nGet the Shortcut from iCloud (no app installation is needed):\nhttps://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/642e55dc8163480a8658c3f16c9a2a65\nYou can find Media Metadata in the share sheet of your images/videos.\nYou may want to enable Allow Untrusted Shortcuts in Settings > Shortcuts\n\nA: you can add it to an email message to check the approximate size. when you attempt to send the mail I believe it shows the size of the attached photo/video\n\nA: Download the  Photo Investigator app from the iOS App Store and select a photo, then look at the File Size at the bottom of the screen.\n\nA: try to share video on utube and it will show size of video before uploading to utube.\nAlso you can upload on icloud can also provide you the size of video. sharing it with airdrop also provide you the size of file you are sharing.\n\nA: To counteract the absurd of not having the properties of video files in iPhone, search for this app in the App Store: \"Video Info Viewer\" from Rory Hool. It's free.\n", "Q: iOS 9.1 - Can't clear \"documents & data\" and \"other\" with restore - can it be done? I am trying to clear the 3+ GB of space occupied by other and documents and data on my iPhone 5S, running the new iOS 9.1 (13B5110e)\nUsually I would do this by restoring the phone through iTunes and then restoring from a backup...but when I try that I get this message:\n\"Problem downloading software.

I know it's there because when I go to settings / general / about, I see that I have one video on my phone, but it does not show in photos. What's going on here?\n\nA: It would seem that it could only be in one of two places (and perhaps a third in a stretch) if you recorded it with the built in camera app. \n\n\n*\n\n*Photos -> Albums -> Videos (or Slo-mo)\n\n*Photos -> Albums -> Recently Deleted\n\n\nAs I'm sure you are aware, you can also see videos under \"Photos\" (left most tab), or under Albums -> Camera Roll. I suspect that you checked there, though. \nIf you tap and hold on a video, you can choose \"hide\". That will hide it from places other than under Albums so the first option above should still work even if you have inadvertently hidden the video. \nThere is also an extremely remote chance that it is in the Videos app. But, you'd have to have to specifically put it there using iTunes as a go-between, so again, it is highly unlikely.\nBy the way, my phone says that I have 119 videos and the camera app's videos album shows 119.\n", "Q: Spotlight search still searchs when not selected Why does my iPhone 5c save deleted emails and messages and displays them when spotlight search is turn on.

In macOS Terminal.app how can I issue a command similar to caffeinate that keeps all running applications from quitting?\nIn my System Preferences I have Energy Saver to: computer sleep-never and Display sleep-never, I even have caffeinate issued in the terminal.\nAfter a while of no keyboard or mouse activity the screen will go to login mode. All apps like Excel and Mail have quit except those that required a save.\nEven Terminal is asking if I really want to quit. I want all to be as if I were touching my keyboard every few minutes so not even the login screen shows and Excel never quits.\n\nA: You can use the screen terminal window manager and its detach feature. This command is installed by default on OS X.\nExample scenario.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Run screen\n\n*Run a program of your choice e.g. htop.  \n\n*Suspend this program (Ctrl+z) and run it in background bg\n\n*Detach your current session (Ctrl+a d)\n\n*Exit your session and exit the terminal\n\n*Open the terminal again\n\n*List running session with screen -ls\n\n*Go back to your session with screen -r <session id>\n\n*Use your program again with fg\n", "Q: yosemite mail remove self from cc list When I select \"Reply All\" using Apple Mail my email address automatically gets added back in the original field it appeared in the original message; i.e. if I was CC'd on an email, my address will appear in the CC field when selecting \"Reply All\".\nI've already unchecked the setting in preferences to \"Automatically CC myself\".  How can I prevent receiving a duplicate email in my inbox for every email I send using the \"Reply All\" option?\n\nA: The default behavior for Mail is that it doesn't cc you when replying unless you've flipped the toggle to cc you on every reply.\nBut you can get weird mismatches that cause Mail to not identify your own address. This just happened to me with my work Exchange account. I moved to Mail from Outlook and Mail cc'd me on every response.\nThe resolution for my specific case was that my contact card had my name entered as firstname lastname, while my Exchange account in Mail showed the name as lastname, firstname. When I changed the display name in the Mail account to match how it displayed in my contact card, Mail stopped ccing me.\n\nA: I had the same issue and I managed to solve it by simply editing the Aliases for my account. What I did:\nin the Mail > Preferences > Accounts > select account, than in the Alias dropdown select Edit Aliases and than I've added a new alias, practically my email address: \nFull name: myemailaddress@whatever.com Alias: myemailaddress@whatever.com\nThis solved the issue for me. Hope it help.\n\nA: Especially with Microsoft Exchange accounts that have a different alias used for login than is actually seen in a recipients 'from' field, one needs to go to Mail -> Preferences -> Accounts, select such exchange account -> Email addresses, and then add both the 'alias@domain.com' and the other human readable email address that usually contains the owners name.surname@domain.com.\nThis solved the issue for me.\n\nA: This happens to me only if the address I am replying from is not exactly the same as the address the message came to. For example:\nCustomer X sends an email to president@company.co and CC's samh@company.co, but that is actually an alias to sh@company.co. When I reply-all, Mail will send a message from: sh@company.co to: Customer X and CC:president@ and samh@company.co. \nThis makes some sense: How can Mail know that samh@company.co and sh@company.co are the same thing?\n\nA: I don't think there's a \"reply all except for myself\" function that's been programmed into Apple Mail. I haven't seen any hidden settings mentioning that, but you could ask Apple Support if you felt there would be such a flag. They would be the only ones with access to the Engineers that would have written that code.\nBarring that, you can manually remove yourself or deal with the extra copy. Perhaps opening a second thread asking for software recommendations of mail clients that have implemented the algorithm you propose is worth getting opinions of no one suggests an alternative here.\n\nA: For me this started happening when I switched from gmail to me.com. I put a forward on my gmail account so that my mail is redirected to my @me.com account. In spite of the setting not to do that, Mail will cc:myself whenever replying to messages forwarded by gmail (and thus addressed to my @gmail address), not when replying to messages addressed directly to my @me account.\nI offer no solution, but I believe this can be a cause of the problem.\n\nA: For me the problem appeared to be in the Account name (under preferences > Account name). In the default exchange settings, my account name is simply FIRST LAST. \nHowever, in the company directory, the format is FIRST LAST | COMPANY.\nBy adding the \"| COMPANY\" bit to the account name, both outlook and Mac Mail then recognised my email address and stopped CCing me into reply alls. \n\nA: This was happening to me on El Capitan, even though I already had my address listed on my contact.\nI noticed that Mail automatically adds e-mail addresses that you have sent mail to (maybe via \"previous recipients\"?) to Contacts. They do not have any information other than the e-mail address. \nI had a extra contact card containing only my new e-mail address. It is possible that I first hit reply-all before adding my new e-mail address to my real, original contact card, so I deleted the automatically-added contact card. After restarting Mail the problem was fixed.\n", "Q: Is it a known problem that Time Machine does (sometimes) not backup Thunderbird profiles completely? I restored my system completely from a Time Machine backup only to find out that for quite a time about 5 Gigs of data are missing in the backup of my Thunderbird profile.\nI can follow the weeks back where it started, but it doesn't help as those files would be weeks old and not contain the ones from, say, yesterday.\nThere is no folder manually excluded via Time Machine configuration. It's just missing.\n\nA: Besides the Time Machine configuration there is another way to exclude files and folders from being backed up with Time Machine: the com_apple_backup_excludeItem attribute.\nTo find all files or folders with this attribute enter in Terminal:\nmdfind \"com_apple_backup_excludeItem = com.apple.backupd\"\n\nTo check if the attribute is set for a single file or folder use:\nxattr -x /path/to/item\n\nIf you get a result similar to this one: com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem the item is excluded from a Time Machine backup.\nOr:\ntmutil isexcluded /path/to/item\n\nIf you get the result -    /path/to/item the item is excluded or +     /path/to/item the item isn't excluded.\nTo remove this attribute from an item use:\ntmutil removeexclusion /path/to/item\n\n", "Q: Share internet connection from iPad to iPhone via bluetooth I can share my iPad's internet connection using Bluetooth to my Macbook Pro and my Android phone but my iPad and iPhone does not even seem to see each other when I try to pair them.

I´m wondering whether there is a possibility to install local .dmg files previously downloaded. I figured out that homebrewmay use archive file (gzip, bz2, tar, etc.) when putting them into the right path aka /Library/Caches/Homebrewand rerun brew install. However, dont know how to install .dmgfiles.\n\nA: I think there are a couple of issues here. Homebrew is a package manager for command line utilities. Homebrew packages are not in .dmg files.\nThere is a a related project called homebrew-cask (HBC) that functions as a package manager for GUI apps, the likes of which may indeed be distributed via .dmg file.\nPresuming that you are trying to use cask to install a GUI app distributed in a dmg file, you must understand that the point of a package manager like homebrew-cask (HBC) is that you create or are provided with a script that informs the package manager how to install and manage the software. All DMGs are not innately compatible with HBC.\nYou can learn about how this works from the guide on contributing to HBC: https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\nThe short version is that in order to manage a package with HBC, you need to write a \"cask\", which is a ruby file that gives the package manager a concept of what the package is.\nThat said, presume that you are trying to install an existing cask, but use a local .dmg file to avoid having to redownload it? I believe Cask will maintain its own download cache, and so theoretically, if your dmg file matches the sha256 hash contained in the cask and you place that dmg in the cache location, cask should be able to install from it without redownloading.\nThat's as far as I can go right now, so hopefully this helps.\n\nA: The .dmg you're trying to install has to already exist as a Cask.\nExample:\n❯ brew info --cask wireshark\nwireshark: 3.6.7 (auto_updates)\nhttps://www.wireshark.org/\nNot installed\nFrom: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/HEAD/Casks/wireshark.rb\n==> Name\nWireshark\n==> Description\nNetwork protocol analyzer\n==> Artifacts\nAdd Wireshark to the system path.pkg (Pkg)\nInstall ChmodBPF.pkg (Pkg)\nWireshark.app (App)\n\nStart the download of the .dmg you want to install then cancel it\n❯ brew install --cask wireshark\n==> Downloading https://2.na.dl.wireshark.org/osx/Wireshark%203.6.7%20Arm%2064.dmg\n########################                                                  33.9%\n^C\n\nThis will create its entry inside ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads.\n❯ ls ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads | grep .dmg\n86d421998d8b5509f7d8e9631702c2ade285c1dc9b508c39deccb5d19a63c609--Wireshark 3.6.7 Arm 64.dmg.incomplete\n\nThen, copy your .dmg over that one.

If I closed the lid while browsing my library on iTunes, for example, it will show that screen upon waking up, after I input my password. \nIs there a way to change this default behavior? Once I close the lid, when I come back and input my password, I'd like to view the desktop. The apps shouldn't be quit or anything like that, just the windows should be hidden. You know, to start fresh, uncluttered.\n(Similar to what this user is asking, but upon waking up instead of a keyboard combination.) \nIs it possible? Maybe with some Apple Script or command line magic?\n\nA: You have two options, maybe more :\n\n\n*\n\n*Automator: \n\n\n*\n\n*Make an Application document\n\n*Add the following action:\n\nLibrary -> Utilities -> Hide All Applications\n\n\n*Save the App\n\n*Add it to your login items \n\nSystem Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Choose your User -> Login Items\n\n\n*Voilà!, on next login all open apps will be hidden.

Is there a way I can prevent this from happening?\n\nA: After it changes to a list, press ⌘+Z.\nIt's a common routine for things auto-corrected by apps if you don't want them to be auto-corrected, same with MS Office for Windows.\n", "Q: Unable to restore/reinstall/erase from recovery I've just tried to install the El Capitan GM, which failed half way through with the error \"This Core Storage operation is not allowed on a sparse logical volume group\" and gave me the option to restart. Restarting just launches the installer again with the same error.\nI then booted into recovery to try and restore from a Time Machine backup. The boot drive was visible, so I tried to restore to it but it failed saying that the volume couldn't be erased. Now the Time Machine restore can't see that volume. Neither can the Internet Recovery option.\nThe Macintosh HD volume is visible in Disk Utility, verify/repair report no errors.

To create one Logical Volume using all available space in the Logical Volume Group the following should work instead of 100g: 100% or 250g\nQuit Terminal, open Disk Utility and verify the new volume \"Macintosh HD\".\nThen use Time Machine to restore the backup.\nIf the creation of the LV fails some inner structures of the LVG probably are corrupted and you have to delete the LVG.\nTo delete the Logical Volume Group enter:\ndiskutil cs delete lvgUUID with lvgUUID: UUID of the Logical Volume Group. It's the first listed.\nIn your case:\ndiskutil cs delete 0E37A07F-7123-4AE4-9C3C-D51D0C05E47E\nDeleting the Logical Volume Group will automatically create one new classical JHFS+ volume with the name \"Untitled\" occupying all available space on the disk.\nQuit Terminal, open Disk Utility, verify the volume \"Untitled\" and rename it by erasing it. Then use Time Machine to restore the backup.\n", "Q: How can I prevent my Library and Playlists from interfering with each other in Apple Music? I'm looking for a way to prevent my Library and Playlists from interfering with each other, or at least maybe they could play well together.\nCurrently, I've erased everything from my Library in an attempt to solve this problem. I've got about 20 Apple Music Playlists. Currently, I've made all these playlists available for offline use.\nI keep attempting different solutions to this problem:\nIf I choose to either + or ‘Make available offline’ any particular song from a playlist that is available offline, it goes into my Library. \nHowever, when I remove any of these songs from my Library by ‘Remove from My Music’, playlists that contain these songs are no longer available offline. To make things worse, if I try to ‘Make available offline’ again, nothing happens. The playlist will not download again.\nI'm not sure if this is a bug or if I'm doing something wrong.\nI've found another unexpected behavior, if I add a song to my Library by clicking + on a song in a downloaded Playlist, it will appear in my Library. By all appearances, the song is available offline, but the context menu still gives me the option to ‘Make available offline’. I don't understand why this option is available to me, when the songs are already downloaded.\nHere's an Imgur album I created to show how reproducible the problem is.\n\nA: I am also a little confused but I think this information is correct:\n\n\n*\n\n*A song that is in one of YOUR playlists must also be in your library\n\n*Therefore...if you add a song to a playlist, it will be added to your library\n\n*Therefore...if you remove a song from your library, it will be removed from any of your playlists that it was included in.\n\n*However...if  you delete a playlist it does NOT delete the songs from your library\n\n\nAlso note that adding Apple Music playlists (i.e. not created by you) do NOT add songs to  your library.\nIn my experience, this leads to my Library becoming unusable because it is a very long list of artists that only have 1 or 2 songs.  I'm never sure if I can delete the songs from my library because I don't know whether the song is part of a playlist that I want to keep.\n", "Q: El Capitan and Daisy Chaining Will El Capitan allow me to daisy chain two Dell 2713H monitors from my 2015 13\" MBP?

In order to search files, I want to input Chinese. But when I point to the input field. It shows English keyboard and I cannot change the language input. Why? Thank you very much.\n\nA: When preferences are set in iOS through Settings.app, they apply to the current user, which is mobile. These preferences are written to ~/Library/Preferences.\nApps such as iFile which run as root obtain their preferences from the root user, which by factory is set the same on all devices. Changing settings in mobile doesn't affect root, as it should. This is useful in case you make a change that means the mobile user cannot log in.\nThis is also reflected in that Cydia Substrate which runs as mobile is not in effect in root apps such as iFile. That Cydia runs as mobile now has lead to a number of Substrate tweaks which were not possible before.\nI'm not certain how to change root preferences, but I wouldn't want to either as changes to root could break its ability to log in which may cause iOS to not be able to log in. I recommend you copy text from another app which runs as mobile and allows you to use your preferences in keyboard.\n", "Q: BuildError(): error building a user of type I'm getting a strange message each time I boot. For a quick second before the Apple Logo appears I see the text:\nBuildError(): error building a user of type 0x20010008\n\nThen the Logo appears, and shortly after the Login screen. After which the following errors appear:\nBuildError(): error building a user of type 0x20010008\n**** ERROR _CreateMenuWithWithIdentifier no image for file: 1_flag_menu_item.png\n**** ERROR _CreateMenuWithWithIdentifier no image for file: 77_flag_other_menu_item.png\n**** ERROR UIFlagPickerRestoreState No state found for flag picker\n**** ERROR ArchiveViewCreateWithOptions ArchiveCopyPNGImage failed for file: preferences_good_samaritan_message_ribbon.png\n**** ERROR ArchiveViewCreateWithOptions ArchiveCopyPNGImage failed for file: logimui_bootprogressbar.png\n\nIn verbose boot this is in big text before the usual status messages that show loading of the OS.\nI'm was running OS X 10.10.4, and this began once I upgraded to the GM Candidate of El Capitan 10.11, which is the newest and stable release. Haven't a clue about what it is.\nAny ideas as to what these messages are?\nUpdate: Fresh Install\nI just wiped my computer and did a fresh install of 10.11 GM El Capitan. Still showing up. Seems to be an issue of the new OS.\n\nA: The problem seems to correlate to enabling FileVault for the whole disk. I did that for my MBP since I use it for work and in the case it gets lost, I need the content to be protected.\nWhen you boot from a disk completely encrypted by FileVault, the OS cannot boot until the password to decrypt the disk content is entered.\nTo do this, OS X starts a minimal LoginManager where you enter your user name and user password. The entered user password is used to decrypt the FileVault Key and FileVault can now decrypt the contents of the disk and the real boot sequence starts.\nUsually this LoginManager offers a flag to select the language for its GUI and the Keyboard Layout. As it seems, Apple made an error by not providing the needed resources on the unencrypted partition for setting up the LoginManger. This results (in my humble opinion) in the following error messages at boot time (only to see for a very short time):\n**** ERROR _CreateMenuWithWithIdentifier no image for file: 1_flag_menu_item.png\n**** ERROR _CreateMenuWithWithIdentifier no image for file: 92_flag_other_menu_item.png\n**** ERROR UIFlagPickerRestoreState No state found for flagpicker\n**** ERROR AchiveViewCreateWithOptions ArchiveCopyPNGImage failed for file:  preferences_good_samaritan_message_ribbon.png\n**** ERROR AchiveViewCreateWithOptions ArchiveCopyPNGImage failed for file:  loginui_bootprogressbar.png\n\nWhen you logoff a user and get back again to the LoginManager AFTER the system has booted, you will see the flag, the language menu, and the power off menu, which you don't see directly after switching on the computer.\n\nA: It's a consequence of protecting with Firevault your boot disk. if it is enabled the EFI is not allowed to read or write from the boot disk at that early stage in the EFI initialization Sequence. \nMy best guess at this moment is that this behavior is intended, a new security feature present in OS X 10.11 El Capitan.     \nApple will need to publish an EFI update to get ride of the deprecated \"warning messages\". \n", "Q: BOOTCAMP partition cannot be mounted After working in Windows for a couple of days, then booting back to OSX - I cannot mount my BOOTCAMP partition in Mac OS X any more. Disk utility shows BOOTCAMP as \"greyed out\". Trying to mount throws an error \"The disk BOOTCAMP could not be mounted. Try running First Aid\". I cannot run First Aid because it is also greyed out.\nI still can boot into Windows just fine via alt/boot. Moreover even Parallels can boot the Bootcamp partition just fine!

Ok, guess I have to boot into windows again and shut-down/restart it a couple of times to clear the hibernation flag...\n\nA: Basically, what worked is booting to Windows natively and shutting it down several times to clear the hibernation flag. Also, disabled hibernation via power-management and via powercfg /h off.\n\nA: Uhh.  I was getting this error in the logs:\nMft record size (1024) is smaller than the sector size (4096).

Is there any way to convert Apple Music M4P files to MP3?\niTunes doesn't allow to burn discs with Apple Music files, is there any other method?\n\nA: M4P files are protected with Apple's Digital Rights Management (DRM) to stop conversion etc. Any unprotected MPEG4 files like .m4a can be converted easily with iTunes or various other applications but the DRM prevents this. \nIf you've purchased the music yourself, then upgrading to iTunes Match will let you replace the DRM protected files with standard m4a which Apple now uses for iTunes purchases. It's an annual subscription but you might also find it useful for syncing and updating other music in your library.\nAlso bear in mind that any conversion from m4a to mp3 will be from one lossy format to another, so you might notice a reduction in sound quality.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Bootable DVD created with a MacBookPro9.1 is not recognized I followed   http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/burn-a-dvd-on-mac-osx to create a bootable UBUNTU DVD with my MacBook Pro9.1 (OS X Yosemite 10.10.5).\nI ended all the steps but I cannot boot such dvd on my MacBookPro9.1.\nBUT..the same dvd works in other computer (MacBookPro8.1 OS x Lion 10.7.5).\nIs not a problem of the Computer?\n\nA: Below is a copy of an image from the link you gave in your question.\n\nIf you enlarge the image, you can read that the source is the file \"trusty-desktop-amd64+mac.iso\".\nThis is the WRONG iso to be using. You should be using \"trusty-desktop-amd64.iso\". \nThe iso's ending in \"+mac\" is for users who wish to do a BIOS boot. This includes users whose machines are not Mac's. The regular iso's that do not end in \"+mac\" are for users who wish to do an EFI boot.\nI have found the EFI boots work with 64 bit Macs as early as the 2007 models.  If you have a optical (DVD) drive you can boot this way, but the USB flash drive method also works even when Windows USB installer will not. My (20-inch, mid 2007) iMac7,1 can boot Live and/or install current versions of Ubuntu using either a DVD or USB.\nBoth DVD and USB once booted, have software to verify the media. If found the DVD's verify, but the USB's, created using Ubuntu's instructions, do not. The boots and installs seem to work OK, but the fact the USB flash drives do not verify bothers me. Fortunately, if you create the USB media using UNetbootin, the resulting flash drive verifies. \nEvidently, you can also use UNetbootin to create a Live USB version of Ubuntu that has *persistence, but I have never pursued that option.(Persistence allows you to keep your preferences and data even after a reboot.)\nI have read may cases where users are happy with BIOS installs of Ubuntu. Problems occur when users what to triple boot of OS X, Ubuntu and Windows. If Windows should be installed in BIOS mode, then the user has to figure out how to get Grub to boot both Ubuntu and Windows. In these cases, booting Windows in BIOS mode and Ubuntu in EFI mode would be a better option. The problem here is that EFI Ubuntu installs do not set up the software to boot on Mac's. You are left to figure that out.\nThere are may solutions to this problem. Here are a few: First, you can move the files in the EFI partition get the Mac firmware to recognize Ubuntu. Second, you can install and configure rEFInd. Third, since Ubuntu installs a Grub that can recognize hfs+ formatted partitions, you can configure Ubuntu to boot the same way OS X boots. (Actually, the Mac firmware thinks it is booting OS X.)\nAn explanation of how it implement any of these three method is beyond the scope of the original question.\n", "Q: Chrome prevents Macbook from sleeping Chrome prevents my Macbook from sleeping. See screenshot:\n\nSome websites say it might be due to a chrome extension, but I've installed no new extensions in the last two weeks (I've only had this problem for two weeks). Neither did I update OSx, Chrome, or the Energy Saver settings. How do I fix this?\n\nA: I had the same issue where Chrome was preventing sleep, i.e., Activity Monitor Energy tab showed that. And I discovered that when I would close a tab running \"https://web.whatsapp.com/\", that the \"Preventing Sleep\" column would go to No. When I would open that web site again, it would go back to \"Yes\".\nI found this blog discussing it:\nhttp://webdiary.com/2015/01/29/whatsappweb/\nThat correlates with the output of running pmset -g assertions, which shows:\n   pid 229(coreaudiod): [0x00066e6300010845] 01:19:47 PreventUserIdleSystemSleep named: \"com.apple.audio.e8-07-bf-12-d6-97:output.context.preventuseridlesleep\" \n    Created for PID: 2748. \n\n\nA: This is because, chrome detects if any tab is playing any media file either audio or video (this also includes ads with media). If you have any tab that's playing any media, chrome thinks that you are watching some media and doesn't let your laptop to go sleep mode. \n----EDIT----\nI was working on a project where i wanted to keep users screen and laptop awake all the time. So i used same trick, i put small hidden html video in code and it did the trick. Audio didnt work though. \n\nA: Try Chrome Canary. It seems to fix this issue.\n\nA: I woke up to a hot Macbook Pro with just 34% battery after fully charging it, unplugging it, closing it, and putting it in a briefcase the night before. It was so hot it was uncomfortable to hold, and the fan was working overtime. I've followed the same routine hundreds of times before with no similar problem.\nActivity Monitor showed Chrome to be the main culprit, and \"prevent sleep\" was \"yes\" for Chrome. I had a dozen tabs open, and closed them one at a time to see what changed the status. \nIn my case, the problematic website was Forbes.com. I was able to toggle the prevent sleep mode by opening and closing a tab with a typical Forbes article. This site has a heavy ad load, auto-play videos, etc. I'm guessing something in their code cycles new videos on the un-refreshed page and is preventing sleep. One time, their video player failed to load for some reason and the prevent sleep indicator never went to \"yes.\" Not definitive, but suggestive. I'm sure other sites with aggressive ad display methods might have the same effect.\n\nA: I effectively solved the issue by uninstalling the extension D (disconnect.me) Check if you have it installed and disable it. \nGo back to the activity monitor and double check if \"preventing sleeping\" is still set to YES\nif so: I suspect you could try disabling other extensions with similar results. \n\nA: I had the same problem, MacBook Pro 2014 would not sleep. Quitting Chrome would result in sleep. I disabled the most recent Chrome extension I had added, Tabr | Memory Saver and Chrome Tab Manager, and the MacBook Pro again would sleep. Clearly various Chrome Extensions are capable of preventing sleep.\n\nA: I have discovered that visiting certain websites will trigger this \"prevent sleep mode\" problem.  Right now, I have NO extensions installed, yet when I visit certain websites, the activity monitor shows that the 'no-sleep' mode trigger is set off just by going to the site.\nTry this:\n-close individual tabs, one by one, and see if any of them reset the no-sleep trigger off (Activity monitor).  Be sure to check for any pop-under tabs.\n-close all tabs.  Check the activity monitor to see if that turns off the no-sleep mode.  If not, close and restart Chrome.  Recheck the activity monitor.  (Your home page may trigger no-sleep.)\n-After opening any website, see if the no-sleep mode is triggered.\nThis seems to happen especially with the sleazier websites that have pop-under tabs that open, etc.  You'll have to close those tabs as well. \n\nA: Check whether you have a tab open with a looping video and close it.\nThat was my case, I kept putting my Macbook away, and coming back to it with little or no battery left.  Turns out I had a tab open with what I thought was an animated gif, but turned out to be a looping video file.  Closing that tab fixed everything. Sounds like audio/video files are indeed the culprit.\n\nA: I have found that Google Play Music playing music audio (even in the background) in a tab can \"prevent sleep\".\nWhen it's playing music in the background, Chrome Preventing Sleep (in Activity Monitor) shows \"Yes\":\n\nPause Google Play music (I use the media button), and after ~ ten seconds, it changes to \"No\":\n\nUnpause Google Play Music, and almost immediately, it changes to \"Yes\" again:\n\n\nA: My 2 cents on this topic:\nI have the problem on my Mac M1 with Big Sur (11.3)... I've just discovered the cause was the inspection panel kept being opened during my debugging session. This might be tied to the OS; I don't remember the issue on macOS 11.2. Anyway, closing the inspection panels screen saver works.\n\nA: Just want to add that keeping Google Voice open in a tab, without any audio playing, will also prevent sleep.\n\nA: Found a temporary solution for this. If you want to open any inspect element window in chrome then make sure to open it inside the window tab (I mean do not undock it into a separate window)\nDoing so, you will notice that the activity monitor doesn't show \"preventing sleep\" for google chrome anymore.\n", "Q: How to get Apple Mail badge (n. of unread messages) from script?

I use this to share how my app behaves to my developers.. \nhowever right now i'm doing usability tests.. and what i would like to do is have someone sit in front of my mac, connect the iphone to my mac by usb.. and have quicktime record whatever they're doing on the iphone.. but i also want quicktime to record both the sound that's outputted from the iphone as well as their own voice when they speak (ie using the mac build in microphone).. how can i do that?\nthe problem is that by selecting the audio source from quicktime.. you can either select the iphone output OR the built in microphone.. it does not offer both\n\nUpdate\nin response to this answer:\nthis happens when i try to record more than one session at a time\n\n\nA: Just setup two windows in QuickTime: one for iPhone video and audio, and the other for Mac audio and press record on both windows. If the Mac audio isn't synchronized perfectly with the iPhone audio and visual, then you can just use iMovie or Final Cut Pro X, if you have it, to edit them.\nMake sure that \"New Audio Recording\", for your Mac's internal microphone, is selected FIRST, then create a new window by selecting \"New Movie Recording\", for iPhone video and audio. If you select \"New Movie Recording\" first, then \"New Audio Recording\" will be grayed out. I don't know why, seems pretty stupid.\n\nA: You could either make a screen record on your Mac and choose the Mac sound (you would also have the sound plus video, but why don't you use iMovie and put it together) or you can use a virtual sound card like Soundflower and record the sound separate with Audacity for example.\n", "Q: How to know what nsurlsessiond is downloading I turned off all iCloud drive stuff and it seems something else is using it. I don't have photo sharing and photo syncing on between my Mac and iPhone. And I've turned off whatever I can. But still nsurlsessiond downloads over 400 MBs every time it runs; which sometimes is triggered with a restart of the system.\nI did a sample process on it; but I have no idea what it means.\n\nA: This was a really helpful post:\nhttp://ayteck.blogspot.com/2015/09/limited-bandwidth-apple-and-hell-caused.html\nFor me, it was an \"automatic update\" from the App Store.\nSystem Preferences > App Store / Software Update > Disable automatic updates saved me hundreds of megabytes per day in bandwidth. My machine becomes very slow when downloading updates.\n\nA: That daemon (or system process) is invoked and handles network download requests from many apps and many other services on macOS. (And iOS and tvOS and watchOS)\nI haven't found an easy way to get summary details or statistics from the session manager, but since it works on a queue to upload or download things, my guess is you have one or more job(s) timing out.\nHere are some ways to pick apart the activity on your system:\nsudo lsof | grep nsurl\nps -ef|grep nsurl\nsudo fs_usage -w | grep nsurl\n\nThe first lists open files and sorts for matches of “nsurl”. The second lists all processes and sorts again. The third lists file system activity.\nThat will let you monitor things and see which of the several nsurl daemons is running when you measure 400 mb of transfer. You can also get a dump of the system activity with sysdiagnose nsurlsessiond\nIf you determine that it's really iCloud Documents, you'll likely need brctl log -w to watch that subsystem instead of monitoring the worker threads that do the lifting.\n\nA: In my case I have found that:\nWhen backing up WhatsApp (on iOS - iPhone) chats to iCloud, it copies the backup into every machine that uses iCloud. The backup is placed into a hidden folder, on my machine (OS X 10.11.4) it is in the\n/Users/UUUUUUU/Library/Mobile Documents/57T923XXXX~net~whatsapp~WhatsApp/Accounts/NNNNNNNNN/backup\nfolder, where UUUUUUU is my username and NNNNNNNNN is my phone number.\nUnfortunately the backup file for the media is in one huge archive (mine is > 560MB) so every time WhatsApp backs up, the WHOLE file is re-downloaded, from what I can see. This is what nsurlsessiond is doing.\nIf you run the brctl log -w command mentioned above, you will see something along these lines:\nreceived a push for container 57T923XXXX~net~whatsapp~WhatsApp\n[note]    2.335 [2016-05-04 12:44:54.114] cloudkit.operation.callback    sync-down.container-metadata BRCContainerMetadataSyncDownOperation.m:229\nfetched 0 containers metadata from the cloud\n[note]    2.375 [2016-05-04 12:44:54.154] sqlite.serverTruth             zone.server               BRCServerZone.m:771\nreceived 25 edited items from the cloud for 57T923XXXX.net.whatsapp.WhatsApp\n[note]    2.427 [2016-05-04 12:44:54.207] bird.scheduler.Apply Changes   accountsession       BRCAccountSession.m:1473\nwe will now download new documents automatically because the account contains less than 5 GB\n[note]    2.536 [2016-05-04 12:44:54.316] sqlite.clientTruth             fs.downloader          BRCFSDownloader.m:1469\ndownloading 11 documents in 57T923XXXX.net.whatsapp.WhatsApp\n\nDeleting the WhatsApp 'documents' (i.e. backups) via the iCloud storage management console in iOS or Mac OS X deletes the files from the Mobile Documents folder and thereafter there is no more activity from nsurlsessiond.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: For Googlers that just want to stop the bandwidth usage, do what the OP did and turn off services that may be causing problems:\niCloud\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences -> iCloud\n\n*Uncheck:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Drive\n\n*Photos\n\n\n\nSpotlight Suggestions\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences -> Spotlight\n\n*Uncheck \"Spotlight Suggestions\"\n\n\nIf you find something else hogging bandwidth on your machine then leave it in the comments and I'll add it here.\n\nA: In my case nsurlsessiond was using over 5MB/s of download bandwidth.  I noticed this because web pages were loading very slowly, and thanks to the iStat Menus application in my Menu Bar.\nI tried other methods to work out the source of the data usage, however I didn't find much useful information that wouldn't require further digging (and I didn't want to disable iCloud Backup or iCloud Photos).  \nThe Activity Monitor application was able to provide me a quick overview of where the data was coming in and where it was going.  \nOpen the Activity Monitor app and navigate to the Network tab, then sort by Rcvd Bytes and wait (the network tab only display cumulative results since you navigated to the tab).  Here you will likely see nsurlsessiond topping the list.  \nNow navigate to the Disk tab in Activity Monitor and sort by Bytes Written.  Ignoring kernel_task (which encapsulates a lot of functions and is rarely worth trying to debug), in my case Photos Agent was at the top of the list (which came as no surprise since I recorded a lot of video media on my iPhone the day before).  \nI deleted some recently captured media from my iPhone that I didn't need to keep, and waited a little while longer for the sync to complete, then the process settled down.  \nIf you can't afford to wait for the process to settle down, and you don't need to use the Photos app, you can try stopping the process that triggers Photos Agent to sync photos from iCloud:\nfor i in com.apple.photolibraryd com.apple.photoanalysisd com.apple.cloudphotosd\ndo\n   launchctl stop $i\ndone\n\n\nA: Apart from the iCloud settings in settings. In my case, it was the Message sync, in Message > Preferences > iMessage and there \"activate Message for iCloud\" that was the source of the problem.\nEverything else had always been deactivated.\n\nA: i just go to\n\nSystem Preferences >> Apple ID >> iCloud\n\nand uncheck all. problem solved. my case\ni think the iCloud Drive sync every bit of data to the server that's the problem\ni don't want to sync anything to iCloud so i just uncheck all\n\nA: Taken from here:\nIf you want to stop it do\ncd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/System/Library/UserEventPlugins/com.apple.nsurlsessiond.plugin\nmv com.apple.nsurlsessiond.plugin Rename-com.apple.nsurlsessiond.plugin\ncd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/usr/libexec\nmv nsurlsessiond Rename-nsurlsessiond\n\n\nA: THIS WORKS FOR ME :-\n(1) UPDATE THE SOFTWARE AND SAFARI\n(2) UNCHECK EXTENSIONS ON SAFARI's PREFERENCE EXTENSIONS SECTION\n(and simultaneously check the activity monitor)\nany one of the extensions might cause nsurlsessiond problem .\n", "Q: Issue with audio for slideshow with Photos I have a problem when adding music to a slideshow in photos. When I add a piece of music and check the 'fit to music' the timing is never right and I'm left with about a minute of silence at the end of the slideshow.\nAlternatively if I try and vary the time of the slideshow manually, it won't let me and resets itself to default time.\nBoth of these issues mean that I cannot get a piece of music to fit in time with a slideshow, which is proving highly frustrating.\nI'm using a new MacBook OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 (14F27)\n\nA: I'm not able to reproduce what you are saying. The duration in the top right under export seems responsive. I add the song I want, notice how long it plays and the slide show duration updates.\nMy guess is you have more than one song queued in the top right under selected music, but it's hard to know without poking around your project.\n\n The above is from Version 1.1 (330.21.0)\n\nA: In my example there are 3 songs cued to play. When I export the file, they all fit and work fine, but for some reason there is about a minutes worth of silence at the end. It seems that the music is not syncing correctly, so it finishes before the slideshow.\nIf I try and add music and then amend the duration of the slideshow automatically the slider reverts back to the original time length of the slideshow. e.g its length is 8:24 and then try and change the time to 10:00 and it keeps reverting back to 8:24.\n", "Q: Mystery \"Menu Extra\" Can anyone identify this menulet please?

I have a new MBP running Yosemite. I like to keep my pictures and videos on an external hard drive in a file system so I can navigate to them (e.g. using Finder, Terminal, or a Linux VM). Photos only imports into a photo library which is an opaque object storing your photos. How do I import my photos from my iPhone into a specified directory?\nThanks you\n\nA: The Image Capture application allows you to import photos and videos from connected devices into any folder you specify. (see: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH17894)\nFor organization, I use Adobe Lightroom, which also has the ability to import directly from iPhone.\nEither way would be better than using Photos.\n", "Q: Apple Screen Sharing = VNC/RDP?

This will therefore select the same colour regardless of where the window is located.\n", "Q: How do I backup an external HDD using TimeMachine? I have used Time Machine for years to backup my main HDD, but I would like to back up an external drive at the same time. Normally you would remove an external drive from the Exclude list in Time Machine Options to have it backed up, I have done so but Time Machine still ignores this drive.\nHow do I get Time Machine to include this external drive in its backup?\n\nA: Make sure the external drive is some flavor of Mac OS X Extended format. \nIf it's not, wipe it and reformat it or use another tool to back up those files.\nOnce that's done, make a couple of sample files on the drive.\ntouch /Volumes/whatever/test1\ntouch /Volumes/whatever/test2\ntmutil isexcluded /Volumes/whatever/*\n\nYou can see what exclusion rules might be causing the test files to be backed up or not backed up.

Ok, so, I just got my Mac back after 5 months in the repair shop. I went to install winblows 7 via Boot Camp Assistant, but was having issues. I went into diskpart, and not remembering how to use it, accidently formatted the OS X drive. Not knowing what I had just done, I went and cleaned it. It wasn't until a few formats and conversions later that I realized I had obliterated every last one of my files and critical system stuff, including my recovery drive, because I had selected the wrong volume to change.\nI have no doubt there is no way to get my files back, but I at least want OS X back.

Internet Recovery lets you start your Mac directly from Apple's servers.\n\nI would not attempt to do this until you have exhausted any options you wish to take for data recovery.\n", "Q: How do I link slides in different keynote 6.5 presentations? I had to presentations in the earlier version of keynote that were linked with a hyperlinked object. That option isn't found in 6.5. I need the presentations separate as one of them is customized with many pictures for each show, while the other remains the same. Combining them creates a file that is too large and thus problematic.\nThe hyperlink disappeared when the two presentations were \"upgraded\" to 6.5 and now I'm kinda screwed by having to stop the show and have the whole audience watch while I switch to the other presentation. Very unprofessional.\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple removed that feature (along with many others) when they released Keynote 6.  It's unclear why, but some people attribute it to a security concern?  Not sure if they ever intend to reinstate it.\nYour best bet is to downgrade back, if possible.

I have a MacBook Pro that will be securely wiped and reverted back to factory state, but I want to save just one personal user account and restore it after the wipe.  I don't think I want to use Time Machine to do the backup unless it can selectively back up a single account.  Is there a way to copy just that user account folder and have my settings, etc., preserved?  How would I restore it afterward?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Disk Utility application.\n\n*From the Menu Bar select \"File→New→Disk Image from Folder\"\n\n*Select home folder of the user account. Click \"Image\" button.\n\n*In \"New Image from Folder\" window enter:\nSave As: Name for .dmg file that will be created.\nTags: Leave blank.\nWhere: Where to place .dmg file.\nImage Format: compressed\nEncryption: none\n\n*Click \"Save\" button.\n\n*In the \"Disk Utility\" window, highlight the new .dmg file. From the\nMenu Bar select \"Images→Scan Image for Restore\".\n\n\n\nYou now can mount the new .dmg file and access the saved files. You may have to use the chown command to reassign ownership of any files copied from the mounted .dmg file.\n\nUpdate 1:\nPersonally, I would preform a backup of a users files while booted to a recovery partition or another partition containing OS X. Using internet recovery would also be preferable. \nIf you choose to preform a backup while logged into an administrator account, then choose to save the .dmg file to location where the user would normally have permission to save such a file.\nFor example, say I (davidanderson) open the disk utility and try to backup ronjanzen's files to the default folder /Users, as shown below.\n\nI would expect the following error message, because I do not have permission to create the file ronjanzen.dmg in the folder /Users.\n\nNow, if I choose to save to my Documents folder, then I will succeed.\n\nThe other alternative would be to give read/write permission to the /Users folder. If you do a \"Get Info\" from the Finder on folder /Users, you get the following.\n\nIf you modify \"Sharing & Permission\" as shown below, you will not get the above error message.\n\n\nA: You can use time machine, then when you set up, use migration assistant. It will allow you to copy specific files (your user account).\n\nA: All your settings are being kept in /Users/[username] folder.\nYou can make disk image of that folder, or you can create archive from command line:\n$ tar cvpjf [where you want to save archive]/[archivename].tar.gz /Users/[username]\n\nthis command will create [archivename].tar.gz file (compressed archive) in [where you want to save archive]/ directory. It will contain all of the files found in /Users/[username].\nNow, when you reinstall, get this archive, run\n$ tar xvpjf [archivename].tar.gz\n\nYou will get your old home directory back. Now, just make sure all the rights are ok (run it even if username is the same as on old system - numerical user id or group id might differ):\n$ chown -R [your new username]: [unpacked directory]\n\n(might need admin password for that; don't forget ':' after the username - it makes sure that owner group is correct).\n", "Q: ITunes takes forever to load a song preview The Itunes store takes forever to load a 1.5 minute song preview, and in the middle it still gives 'Opening URL Buffer stream' dialog box.

It seems it's eating a lot of my memory. What is this?\nBTW, why is Finder and Dock eating so much memory?\n\n\nA: That's actually not a lot of memory for usernoted, Finder, or Dock. \"usernoted\" is a known process and is installed with OS X.

I had to hold down the power button for about 15 seconds before it restored. Any idea what this could be? I am very anxious about this behavior given Macbook Pro's reputation and price tag and the age of this computer. Thanks.\n\nA: One thing for sure: it shouldn't act like that. \nBeside that it'll be hard to say what was going on -  seems like it was overheating (was the fan running?) and didn't want to start working before cooling at least a bit. \nThere might be a lot of reasons for that, but keep a close eye on your machine behaviour - should it happened again - definitely get it serviced since it's a brand new machine.\n", "Q: Terminal Ping, how to get simple integer i am wondering how exactly you would get a simple integer result instead of all the miscellaneous information such as the packet size, transmission number and target.\nTo elaborate: \nI would prefer the output to look like: \n117.85\nA single integer response, similar to how the syntax: ping -c 1 google.com returns a single result, however i would prefer the method to omit the detailed ping report and only displays a single number.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Try this:\nping -c 1 google.com | grep \"time=\" | sed -E \"s/(.*)time=([.0-9]+) ms/\\2/\"\n\nIf you want to get an minimal value for some number of requests use:\nping -q -c 5 google.com | tail -1 | cut -d \"=\" -f 2 | cut -d \"/\" -f 1\n\nReplace 1 in -f 1 with:\n\n\n*\n\n*2 for average\n\n*3 for maximum\n\n", "Q: How can I rip audio CDs and normalize them at the same time? I am a veteran Windows user (sorry!) who typically rips audio discs with CDex or EAC. CDex includes the option to normalize volume levels during the ripping process.\nI am trying to find a program to rip audio discs on a Mac, other than iTunes, and am coming up empty-handed. I have found XLD and Max, both of which seem to be highly recommended and feature-rich, but neither seem to offer normalization.\nI don't want to have to run audio tracks through a separate program before compressing to MP3 (or any other format).\nI'm aware that Mac is a superb platform for professional audio, with industry pros using software like Logic and Pro Tools in production environments, but I find it a bit frustrating that CD ripping software for Mac seems to often lack this feature.\nAm I just not finding \"the one\", or is there some reason that normalization is not common among these rippers? What software (free or not) should I be using for CD ripping which meets the following requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Normalizes volume levels\n\n*Names files based on database lookup (such as freedb)\n\n*Supports MP3 compression (LAME for example)\n\n*Accurate rips with moderate error-checking\n\n\nA: Normalising, as such, is not really helpful when importing from commercial recordings, as the Mastering engineer will have already made sure the tracks are correctly normalised, whilst maintaining the relative levels between each component track.\nThe only way to truly level-match would be using compression & limiting algorithms, which really ought to be left to a professional, & is beyond the scope of Ask Different.\nThe way to do this at consumer-level is to use iTunes for playback [& also would be by far the simplest for the initial ripping, as it is capable of all your bullet points] & switch on Sound Check in Prefs > Playback.\nThis allows iTunes to measure the apparent loudness of each track or album & automatically adjust the playback levels on the fly, enabling more comfortable listening without levels jumping around track to track.\nThis is done by a system known as ReplayGain\nSee 'Alternatives' at the end of that wiki page for a brief explanation of why normalisation & recompression are not ideal solutions.\nHowever, iTunes has traditionally done this on a per-track basis, not a per-album basis, which can make quiet tracks in the middle of an otherwise loud album jump out at you far too much.\nThis trait is reported to be fixed in recent versions, but once a track has been analysed, iTunes will not go back & fix it later.\nTo get around this, you may need to employ something like iVolume which is capable of resetting the iTunes data, then recalibrating. It will also allow you to specify whether any album or compilation should get individual or global adjustment.\nYou can also manually tweak any individual track/album manually.\n", "Q: Upgrade to iOS 9 Final from Public Beta?

(These answers were mostly related to moving from GM to final; in that case the build # is likely the same so it makes sense that you don't get a prompt to update).\nReally hoping that update doesn't entail wipe and restore \nThanks!!\n\nA: As no answers are forthcoming, I'll report here my findings. \nOn 2015-09-16 , before iOS 9 GA, I removed the \"Beta\" profile from the iPad and rebooted. After reboot, software update says:\n\niOS 9.0.\n  Software is up to date\n\nThe version of the software is 9.0 (13A4325c)\nSo it looks good. There's an oddity, though. When I've rebooted (and hard-restart too to be on the safe side), every time I unlock the iPad I still get a notification saying:\n\nThere's an update available. Update the iOS 9 beta version. \n\nI hope that when 9.0 final comes up, the update check will pick it and I'll be back into mainline versions. I'll update here when things change. \nEdit 2015-09-16 19:39 CEST: Apple has just released v9.0 final and going to software update in Settings I get prompted to upgrade, so it looks like I'll be able to get back to mainstream. The notification after login stills says the same. Will report later when I have the chance to upgrade.\nEdit 2015-09-18: After installing the 9.0 update, and the subsequent reboot, the device says its updated to 9.0 and I no longer get the prompt to update -- so all seems to be fine!\nEdit 2015-09-25: Just a final update to confirm that after a few days running, all seems to be fine. I've just got the prompt to update to 9.0.1, so I seem to be fully in \"mainstream\" now.\n\nA: I have the exact same issue as JJarava. I've been seeing a prompt to update to a new beta version (9.1), every time I unlock my phone, for a few days now...it's pretty annoying. \nI, too, have 9.0 (13A4325c) installed. That version is iOS 9 Beta 3. It would be nice if that version number indicated something about it being a beta version. \nI digress. With iOS 9 Beta 3 installed, deleting the beta profile, restarting, and checking for software updates did indeed find iOS 9 GA for me.\nIf you upgrade to iOS 9.1 Beta, I suspect that you'll have to do a restore to downgrade back to 9.0. \n\nA: I had a similar problem and here is how I solved it (both on my iPad and iPhone):\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iDevice to a Mac or PC with iTunes installed.\n\n*Have iTunes running.\n\n*Shut down your device.\n\n*Remove the Thunderbolt USB cable, if connected.\n\n*Hold down the home button while you plugin the Thunderbolt USB cable. Hold down the home button until a \"Connect to iTunes prompt appears\". It's an image showing the iTunes logo and a USB cable.\n\n*For me, in iTunes a message appeared stating that there is a problem with my device and that I need to run an update. Just click the update button and iTunes will download and install the final version of iOS 9.\n\n", "Q: This computer is no longer authorised for purchased items I am facing a very annoying problem from last few days. Whenever I try to install an app from my Mac to my iPad it says:\n\nThis computer is no longer authorised for purchased items\n\n\nbut when I try to authorise this computer, it says:\n\n\n\nThis computer is already authorised\n\n\nA: You've probably authorised the computer with a different iTunes account from the one that the iPad is using. Have you tried deauthorising it and then authorising it again? (If you've purchased iPad apps on both the iPad and the Mac, using different iTunes accounts, then you've got a problem.)\n\nA: I had this same problem. I discovered that at some time in the past I had created another AppleID. My iPhone was \"logged\" in using one ID, I was trying to sync iTunes using a different ID. Go to Settings> iTunes & App Store and note what your AppleID is. Now in iTunes check to see if you are logged in (upper right near the search box) under a different ID. If you are, log out and try store>authorize using the same ID as your iPhone. I had to de-authorize the computer first because it was registered somehow under the other ID. Then re-authorize using the same ID as my phone. It worked for me.\n\nA: I fixed the issue by signing in the other Apple ID I used to install apps with on my iPad and authorising the computer to keep those apps installed.\nAfter you authorise all Apple IDs used on the device to the computer you should be able to sync your content.\n\nA: I've fixed the issue by resetting all settings and removing all apps from my iPhone. \n", "Q: Why does leaked memory appear malloced to kernel_task, and why can't OS X therefore garbage collect it I have previously been told that a sign that some application has a memory leak is that kernel_task has a large memory footprint, commonly on the order of gigabytes. If an awry kext was causing this memory usage, we would expect to see a discrepancy between the allocated memory and those expected to be allocated, i.e. \ndiff <(kextstat|tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 5) <(kextstat| tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 6) \n\nwould return something other than the words 'Wired' and 'Name'. \nWhilst writing my thesis, I have noticed that changing a pdf whilst it is open in Preview often causes bad things to happen: occasionally, the memory usage of kernel_task can grow to around eight gigabytes, or more. If I kill preview, it returns to normal, instantly. So, obviously something is wrong -- and Preview is leaking memory under these conditions.\nSo, my question is this: if I know that a process has leaked ram via a sudden and unexpected increase in the footprint of kernel_task, why can't OS X know that something has gone wrong. If killing Preview restores my missing malloc()'d memory, why doesn't Darwin do garbage collection automagically for me? \nDo I have a fundamental misunderstanding of how memory management works? \nEDIT: (15/9/15)\nHere's a demonstration of what I'm talking about. First of all, I notice high memory usage by kernel_task (note Preview is open, just visible at the bottom of Activity Monitor, using 333 MiB of ram): \n\nFollowing the helpful remarks by Ashley below, let's find out how much each kext is using: \n$ kextstat | awk 'NR==1{ printf \"%10s %s\\n\", $5, $6; } NR!=1{ printf \"%10d %s\\n\", $5, $6; }' | sort -n\n\n...\n...\n...\n   1249280 com.apple.driver.DspFuncLib\n   1769472 com.apple.nvidia.driver.NVDAGK100Hal\n   2629632 com.apple.nvidia.driver.NVDAResman\n   6184960 com.apple.driver.AirPort.Brcm4360\n$\n\nSo, not a huge amount. My machine has both discrete and integrated GPUs; their drivers are only using a few MiB of wired ram. On my hunch, let's kill Preview, and look what happens to the memory footprint of kernel_task:\n \nPreview's gone, and the memory footprint of the kernel has gone down dramatically. \nThere's still no evidence of a change in kext usage: the output of the above command is unchanged.\nEdit: Bug reported as No. 22701036. I am still waiting for a response from apple. There's nothing particularly interesting if you inspect the process in ActivityMonitor, but maybe I'm missing something. \n\nA: The core of OS X is not garbage collected; IOKit's libkern C++ Runtime requires developers to manage their own memory.\nMac Memory Management\nFrom How does memory management work in Mac OS X?\n\nApple documents the lowest levels of the Mach Kernel and the virtual memory subsystem fairly well on the web as part of it's developer documentation.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Kernel Programming Guide: Memory and Virtual Memory\nSince that kernel was developed by Carnegie Mellon University, you can find dozens of papers describing it quite easily.\n\nOther Sources\n\n\n*\n\n*Wikipedia discusses Mac OS memory management.\n\n*Apple's support note: Use Activity Monitor to read system memory and determine how much RAM is being used\nGarbage Collection\nGarbage collection exists at the user or application layer. Even at this layer, garbage collection only helps if the application has released all claims to the memory. A circular dependancy can defeat garbage collection. Garbage collection itself is an evolving area of research and difficult to get right.\nReport Bugs and Memory Leaks\nBugs within OS X will be leaking memory. Given the size of the code base, this is almost certain.\nPlease report reproducible bugs directly to Apple. Every bug report helps and maybe your example will be the one that helps Apple's engineers pin down the cause.\n\nA: Here's my guess, assuming your Mac has an integrated GPU (eg Intel Iris Graphics).\nWhen you have your thesis open in Preview, graphics card memory is used to hold the image (\"texture\") of the Preview window, and perhaps also some off-screen-but-decoded pages from the thesis.\nWith an integrated graphics card, the video memory is actually (partially?) located in system RAM, which is shared between the CPU and GPU.  On some integrated graphics cards, the amount of system RAM used is dynamically allocated (see Apple HT204349).\nI'd guess that you are intermittently seeing a bug in the graphics card driver and/or Preview, which isn't releasing system memory correctly when Preview reloads your thesis PDF.  (However this bug is mitigated by OS X / the driver correctly releasing the memory when Preview quits.)\nYou could try looking at the output of kextstat and see if the numbers in the Size column increase when you experience the issue.  My theory is that the 8GB increase you mention will be due to the graphics card driver.\nThe following command (from a comment on this related and interesting answer) sorts the output of kextstat to make it easier to see which kext is using the most memory (although note this sorts by the Wired column... there's a similar, simpler incantation in this answer with an explanation if you'd like to tweak this).\nkextstat | awk 'NR==1{ printf \"%10s %s\\n\", $5, $6; } NR!=1{ printf \"%10d %s\\n\", $5, $6; }' | sort -n\n\n", "Q: Apple Backup Restore to Android After reading the articles in the the latest Apple event (September/15) I remember reading something about Apple introducing the ability to restore backed up media/contacts to an Android device. I am not sure if this is an IOS 9 feature or an ICloud feature.\nSince I read this I cannot find the original article or any other reference to this functionality.\nPerhaps someone read or saw something about this and could provide me with a link or more details.\n\nA: As if Apple would ever provide a way for you to leave them.\nWhat you may be thinking of is Apple's Move to iOS app that went live on Google Play on September 16th (also iOS 9's release date), which lets you transfer everything from an Android to a new iDevice, not the other way around.\n", "Q: How do I exclude a single day from/preemptively snooze a daily alarm? I have an alarm that goes off every day at 8. Sometimes I wake up earlier on my own accord, go out early and I don't need the alarm any more -- at 8, I'm already in the metro and I don't want it to sound (especially since my alarm of choice is a siren). Is there a way to preemptively snooze it? Right now, I disable the alarm, but this is sub-optimal: I need to remember to reenable it after 8. This happens often enough that I have a second daily alarm at 11, reminding me to restore the morning one.\n\nA: Apple's clock app isn't very deep - it mimics late 20th century watches in functionality, it seems. There is certainly no problem with that as it serves most people's needs completely and many users needs to varying levels. \nIn this case, I suggest that you look beyond the app. If you only want to use that app, you will need a system like what you do know - remind yourself later, or rig a complex pattern of alarms (which wouldn't be self-reliant anyway). But either way the functionality you are requesting isn't possible with that app.\nBefore looking at 3rd party apps, you could use Calendar instead. If you didn't sleep until the alarm, you could simply delete that day's event and be done with it. Snooze should still be functional. But all the rest of your calendar alerts would be set with the same terrible ringer and you would miss it entirely if you forgot to deactivate the silence switch on the side of your phone. \nAfter that, I suggest an app like MotionX Sleeptracker (24/7) or SleepCycle. They both work well for alarms and have some nice features that go along. That said, they may not work for you as you do have to start the \"recording\" every night. I find the process easy, but perhaps you wouldn't prefer it. \nSo then it comes down to going through the App Store looking for a full-featured alarm clock. I've used several but never could get away from MotionX so I didn't stay long and I don't remember enough to know if they had the ability that you described.  \n", "Q: Recovery HD present but can't boot from it I fiddled with partitions on my MacBook Pro with OS X Yosemite, but now I'd like to reinstall the OS to restore original setup.  Recovery HD is there, but if I press CMD + R at boot, Internet Recovery is run instead of normal Recovery from Recovery HD.  I know that I can reinstall OS also from the Internet, but it would take forever and I need to restore my Macbook within two days (downloading OS X Yosemite from App Store requires other 3 days and counting right now).\nProbably I messed up GUID Partition Table (but OS X works flawless). Is there a way to make it possible to boot from Recovery HD and reinstall OS from there instead of using Internet Recovery?\n\nA: Recovery HD still has to download OS X from the Internet. Your only hope of not downloading at all is if you have access to some device, either yours or a friend, that already has the OS X installer app. If you do, you should make an 8GB partition on your HD named Untitled and follow this procedure to make it a version of Recovery HD that has the OS saved locally.\nIf you don't have any way to get the OS X installer, the only other thing you could do is wipe your hard drive and restore from a Time Machine backup, using Internet Recovery to facilitate the process.\n", "Q: Housekeeping before upgrading to new OSX I would like to go for a fresh install, but I've got GB's of Mail archives, iCloud Photos, etc. Therefore I always end up doing just the upgrade on top of the existing OS.\nThis time I would like to spend sometime to go for a fresh install, then restore mail archives and photos. Can time machine help me with this? Any guides as to how?\n\nA: It is certainly possible to backup your drive with Time Machine (or SuperDuper or whatever) wipe it and start fresh. This is something that is commonly done with Windows PCs as they continue to be subject to \"bit rot\" or the inevitable slowdown of a Windows system after a few years of use.\nI, personally, have been just upgrading in place since back when the Macintosh Operating System was called \"System #\" and have rarely found that a clean install did much except take up a bunch of time. However other folks may have different experiences. It all depends on what you use your Mac for and what is installed on it.\nIf you have a nice fast USB 3 or Thunderbolt drive you could try installing the OS fresh on that and see if you see any real change (not attributable to it being an external device) in performance when booted from that fresh install.\nNote that USB 2 drives will be slower and depending on the chipset and drive used in the USB 3 or Thunderbolt enclosure there will already be a performance hit, so take any results with a grain of salt.\nMe, if I had to do a clean install, I would image my boot drive to an external drive. Wipe the partition and install the OS and apps fresh. Then use Migration Assistant to bring over your user settings/documents, leaving the apps installed on the old boot drive behind for the fresh installs on the fresh install of the OS. And allowing Migration Assistant to only bring over your settings and files.\n", "Q: Xcode 7 update unavailable on AppStore I have been seeing on web that latest update for Xcode -Xcode 7 beta release has arrived.

I found lots of references with google to hanging app stores but none of the fixes apply to me.\nWhat happens is simple. I click on the App Store and the spinner spins indefinitely. I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebooting\n\n*Using the \"debug\" menu in app store, reset the app, clear cookies\n\n*Killing the softwareupdated process\n\n*Running softwareupdate -l, which says \"no new software available\"\n\n\nAll and in different order and combinations.\nAny tips?

After that all seems fine again.\n\nA: If softwareupdate --reset-ignored && softwareupdate --list returns an exit status of 0 I would say you have no updates from the server your Mac was chosen to look at. Apple operates a federated cluster of servers and if your subnet has DNS entries, it might even check a local caching server instead of Apple's servers directly.\nThe hang in the App Store app is probably coincidental and a bug or error in that program. Are you looking to pick apart the MAS using instruments or just be assured that you don't have updates that have been rolled out to your computer?\nIf it were me, I'd re-download the installer if I couldn't just let the MAS and the Apple servers work out their busy periods this weekend. It could be all on the server end, but I'd need to pick apart the data the servers were sending to be sure.\n", "Q: An app downloaded from the Mac App Store re-installs itself after I delete it.

It's 250GB HD is full so I purchased a 500 GB drive, partitioned with GUID, erased with Journaled and cloned with CCC. I took out the old disk and put in the new and could not boot: just a folder with ? icon. Put old drive back and new drive on USB, held alt key and drive was there. Could boot from new drive when hooked up via USB.\nAm I missing a step? I removed the old disk and put in the new disk, got the OSX install disk and did a fresh OS install onto the new disk, rebooted and it worked fine. So I don't think it's a hardware issue.\nAll I want to do is swap the old 250 with the new 500 without having to spend hours reinstalling her apps and data. Is there a way to do that?\n\nA: I would do the following to avoid hassles.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the installer I want from a running OS and use it to make an official USB installer drive.\n\n*Make a Time Machine backup of the 250 GB drive to the drive you will use to back up the Mac once it's running from the 500 GB drive. If you plan on no backups, beg/borrow/buy a drive at least 500 GB to use temporarily.\n\n*Boot to the installer drive to test that it COULD install to the 250 or the 500 GB drive, but don't install yet.\n\n*Power off the Mac and put the 500 GB drive inside.\n\n*Boot to the installer with no other external drives connected. Use Disk Utility from the installer to wipe the 500 GB drive and repartition it as OS X Extended.\n\n*Once you install to the internal 500 drive, connect the Time Machine drive to restore the backup you made earlier.\n\n*Keep the 250 drive safe for a while. You can always connect it to recover files if you discover Time Machine skipped some data or files you need.\n\n\nI know Carbon Copy Cloner has a way to make a clone bootable, but I don't use that tool, so perhaps my mentioning it will get someone to step forward with that experience.\nAlso, cloning the drive will carry forward disk errors so you really don't want to do that. Cloning also bypasses the new default settings. Why run in old crusty settings when you can choose what customizations you miss when they occur to you and make use of the new features fully.\nThere are a few cases where I clone a setup, but the drawbacks almost always make me wish I had started clean so I save little time if any by cloning these days.\n\nA: I actually bought a desktop hardware device for cloning HDDs.\nIt was a few years ago now though and it got stolen before I even had a chance to try it out.\nIt looked promising though.

I can’t find out how to put it back in the purchased tab in the App Store. I also tried to delete it and get it back but that doesn’t work either.\n\nA: First things first: Any purchased app will not cost you (a second time). Even if you ordinarily search for it and click on BUY again. If you use the same credentials you used to buy it, the App Store will recognize it and will let you download it for free.\nIn order to unhide any app you once purchased, you need to sign into your Apple ID account inside iTunes, then click on your account name and choose \"Account Info\". If yo have hidden purchases, you have a section between \"Apple ID Summary\" and \"Purchase History\" called \"iTunes in the Cloud\", where you can manage hidden purchases.\nOnce in there, choose \"Apps\" on the right side at the top and then look for your inadvertently hidden app to \"Unhide\" it.\nIf you bought the app for OS X, the same can be done on the App Store for OS X.\n", "Q: Texts with iPhone and iCloud Will a text that is stored in iCloud get deleted from iCloud when you delete it from your iPhone?\n\nA: Yes and no. \nFor practical purposes, texts aren't really \"stored\" in iCloud. I say that with two caveats. First, Apple may store them for their own use and second, they may be stored through your iOS device's iCloud backup. \nAs such, when you delete a message off of your iOS device, that change doesn't populate to other devices, and it isn't deleted from iCloud until your device backs up itself to iCloud (likely over night). The message will be deleted only from your device unless the backup occurs. \n", "Q: Change Apple ID on iPad without losing data I guess I confused you, so let me explain. I am a computer technician, dealing mostly with Windows computer and know a little about iPad and iOS in general. A customer called me because a Facebook application didn't work as expected. When browsing to her Facebook account within Safari, everything was OK, so I realized I should update the Facebook app. There was indeed a new version. The problem is that when she bought the iPad some other guy was too lazy to create a new Apple ID and used his own to install stuff. Every time I attempt to download a new app or update an existing one from Apple Store, I am asked to put the password for this guy's Apple ID and there is no option to use a different Apple ID. In the Settings, Apple Store and iTunes, the only Apple ID present is that of the owner! If I tap on it and select Sign Out, I can then go to Apple Store, select \"Purchased Apps\" and then I am asked to login to see them. At this point I am allowed to use another Apple ID. This does nothing as next time I try to use the Apple Store this annoying dialog asking for the password of the old Apple ID pops up!\nI know that if I reset the device, I can then associate it with the proper Apple ID, but that's the problem! My customer has a lot of downloaded apps and photos she doesn't want to lose! Is there any method to remove this Apple ID once and for all WITHOUT losing data? Calling that guy to do it from his account is not an option, any other method?\n\nA: The \"phenomenon\" you experience has something to do with the actual apps your customer has on their iOS device. Those apps are purchased or downloaded by a person, which is not your customer and therefore using those apps would technically be against the EULA of the iTunes/App Store.\nIn order to rectify this, you want to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign out of the other unknown person's iTunes/App Store account and sign in again using your customer's Apple ID.\n\n*Delete the custom apps*) downloaded by that stranger and, if needed, re-download/purchase them with the correct account of your customer.\n\n*Also worth checking is to sign out of iCloud (if it is used by that other person as well) as long as \"Find My iPad\" is not activated as well. If it is, you will need to have a proof of purchase (second hand purchases will not be accepted to my knowledge) and contact Apple to have it removed.\n\n\n*) IMPORTANT: Deleting an app will also delete its user contents, which are stored for it on the device itself (like documents or login credentials). Remote data (e.g. information on Facebook) are not affected.\nOnce all this has been done, your nightmare will be at an end.\n", "Q: Default System Sound Location I'm looking for some of the sounds that come default on OS X, like the preferences lock/unlock:\n\nI basically just want to copy the sound files onto my desktop.\n\nA: All sounds are .aiff and you'll find many by going to:\nMcintosh HD>system>library>components>\nThen right click on CoreAudio.component and click 'show package contents'\nThen go into Contents>Resources>SystemSounds>finder>\nNote that this is different in El Capitan but is what I used in several OS's before, ie: Yosemite, Maverick, etc\n", "Q: Map any string to your Mac Keyboard (globally) I use Git - every time I pulled it asked me for a password.\ntyping them in every time is slowing me down.\npw : 12khdE32\nNow, I'm thinking if I can map a string with the the keyboard on a Mac, command + \\, then I won't have to type my long pw any more.\nGoal\n12khdE32 --> command + \\\nI've tried look into system preferences + download the app call Karabiner.\nI'm not sure if this possible, but please let me know if you think this is possible to do.

A black screen with white text scrolling by. Eventually you will get a prompt with some instructions on what to do directly above it. I don't remember exactly but the commands mount the filesystem so you can access it. Then enter this:\ncd /Users/[USERNAME]/Movies\n\nWhere [USERNAME] is your short username that appears on your home folder. Once in the movies folder you can proceed to delete movies. remember a couple of things.\n\n\n*\n\n*The command line is Case Sensitive. So MySpecialMovie.mov is a different file than myspecialmovie.mov. At least at the command line level. (The Mac preserves case but in Finder operations is not case sensitive)\n\n*The Tab key is your friend. Press Tab when typing a file name and it will autocomplete.\n\n\nStart by listing the files in your ~/Movies folder like this:\nls\n\nOr you could get a longer listing (which I prefer).\nls -al\n\nThat will give you a list of all the deletable files. \nThe second method will give you file size. \nTo remove one of the files:\nrm MySpecialMovie.mov\n\nNow it is a matter of going through the ~/Movies folder using ls and rm to view and remove un-needed files.\nNote that pressing the Up Arrow will scroll back in command history allowing you to easily review what you have done and/or repeat previous commands. Down Arrow scrolls forward in command history.\nOne you are done you can issue the reboot (restart?) command and allow your Mac to boot normally.\n", "Q: Do not hide number when calling friends? A friend has an iPhone 4 or 5 running iOS 7, and has configured her phone to always hide her number when making calls, as a safety measure.\nAs a result, I can't tell it's her calling, since all her calls says \"Private number\".\nIs it possible to configure an iPhone to hide its number for all out calls except for such and such person in the phone's list of contacts?\n\nA: Possibly.\nYour mileage may vary, as this is a carrier dependent function.  I was however able to achieve the following using two AT&T phones in the U.S.\nFirst I opened Settings > Phone > Show my Caller ID and turned the switch off.\nNext I placed a test call to the second phone, the other phone correctly displayed \"no caller id\".   (Note: it does NOT matter who the carrier is for the second phone, all the magic relates to what the first phones carrier offers.)\nNext I google \"AT&T star codes\" and located this list.  *82 looked like the best choice.\nI then modified the contact for the second phone, adding *82 before the phone number.\nCalling that contact then allowed my caller id info to be displayed on the second phone, while still being blocked for others.\nIt's my understanding that *82 is reasonably standard for the code itself in the U.S.  I have no idea which carriers support it however (other than AT&T where I did test).  I also have no idea what carriers in other countries might use, or if it's supported with a star code.  Consult Google for \"(carrier name) star codes\" or check with the carrier.\n\nA: No, but you could ask Apple to do that feature for you/us in the future at http://apple.com/feedback\nIn the mean time, have her send you an iMessage before calling so you know to answer.\n", "Q: Need an Applescript to handle specific incoming mail.

I could create a new email address just to receive mail from that contact, and keep that address completely off of Apple Mail, but that would force me to manually check the account from the web every couple of hours. \nHopefully that's clear. \nThanks\n\nA: You don't need an Applescript.

If I buy the phone from this page http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone5s and choose the \"SIM-Free\" option (below), will that work for me? or do I have to click the verizon button and put my account info in?  Also, I currently have an android phone, that requires a verizon sim card.  Can I just put my old simcard into the new iPhone when it arrives? Thanks in advance.\n\n\nA: There are two different iPhone 5s models sold in the US -- the CDMA model for Verizon or Sprint (which also supports GSM connectivity for international use) and the GSM model. The unlocked phone is the GSM model, so it won't support CDMA and won't talk to Verizon's network (except perhaps for data (not voice) on 4G/LTE, where Verizon uses GSM like the rest of the world). So you can buy an unlocked phone and put a Verizon SIM in it, but it will at best only work with Verizon for data, and only in areas where they have 4G coverage.\nJust look at the bottom of the page you link to in your question, where it says:\n\nIf you buy a SIM-free iPhone, you will need to purchase a\n  GSM-compatible nano-SIM card separately. In the United States, you can\n  purchase such a SIM from AT&T or T-Mobile.\n\n\nA: This is an old question, but I've seen similar questions about the iPhone 6, 6s and SE now, which are all offered \"SIM-free\". You can buy a SIM-free and it will work on Verizon or AT&T, and possibly on Sprint (depends on phone and model). The days of CDMA (Verizon and Sprint) vs GSM (AT&T and most others) are almost gone. There are still some 3G and older phones being used. CDMA with Verizon is considered a \"legacy\" system to support those old phones and it will likely still be in place for a while. The last iPhone which had different CDMA and GSM versions was the iPhone 4. Starting with the 4S the phones were the same with both CDMA and GSM, but Verizon locked the GSM in theirs for only overseas use outside the USA (it's possible to get this unlocked). Starting with the iPhone 5, they're the same and can be switched at will, provided it's not locked to a contract. You can buy an unlocked SIM-free iPhone 5 or newer and all you need is a SIM card for your carrier (a nano SIM card; the iPhone 4S uses a larger micro SIM card). Should be noted there are different models for different regions of the world because some different bands are used in different regions. Be certain you get a USA model if you're in the USA and buy a used phone. I verified that the same exact model of my iPhone 5S was sold and used for AT&T and Verizon in the USA; the only difference is the SIM card. Same applies to the iPhone 6, 6S and SE. You can buy a SIM-free and either use the SIM card in your old phone (provided it's a nano size SIM and not a micro or mini size), or you get another SIM from your carrier for it. You're still responsible for any contractual obligations that remain on the old phone which may present some hurdles such as having to pay an early contract termination fee, or require paying off the phone completely. With Verizon, you can switch phones on a particular line at will, provided all the contractual obligations with the existing one have been satisfied (e.g. if you had a 2-year contract on it, you've finished the 2 years). You do not have to use the \"upgrade\" path in the on-line Apple store for which Verizon now charges a $20 upgrade fee (I don't know what AT&T, Sprint or others charge). Note: the SIM-free iPhone SE will work on AT&T or VZW, or a host of other networks in the USA, except Sprint which requires a different model of the iPhone SE.\n\nA: I'd just call a Version representative on the phone, go to a Verizon store, or contact Apple in either of those ways if you want a definitive answer.\nThat being said, I'd imagine that that SIM-free iPhone would work with Verizon or the other three carriers due to you not having to specify which one you wish to you the iPhone on. I couldn't be sure, though.\nAlso, as long as your SIM in your old phone is a nano-SIM card, then it will fit your new iPhone perfectly. That's all you should have to do to activate your iPhone, too, is just put that SIM card in it.\nP.S. If you intend on keeping your iPhone for a couple years, you'd be better off either buying a new iPhone 6S or a used iPhone 5S or iPhone 6, not a new iPhone 5S. While a 5S is certainly fine today, in a couple of years it will feel kind of dated (like using an iPhone 4S, today), this is especially bad since it costs at least $550, depending on what model you get. The same configuration iPhone 6S is $200 more, but it'd be worth it, and you'd really appreciate buying a newer model in a couple of years. If you'd don't want to spend any more than what a new 5S costs, though, you could just buy a used iPhone 5S for around $300 on eBay, and a couple hundred or so more for a used iPhone 6. I'd take a used iPhone 6 over a new iPhone 5S any day, but maybe that's just me.\n", "Q: How can I monitor the size of a file? I run a particular abandoned open source project (StreamBaby) on my home media server, a Mac Mini.  It's awesome but has one unfortunate issue which occasionally causes the app to generate an absolutely massive error log - like on the order of many tens of gigabytes.  Sometimes by the time I notice it, it's well over 100GB.  All I have to do is delete it and restart the service and all is fine, but obviously problems can arise if the drive runs out of space due to this.\nI'd like to monitor this file and any time it's larger than maybe 10MB, alert me in some fashion (beep, send an email, pop an alert... something).  I've found services that will monitor if a file size has changed, but I need to monitor it for a specific size.\nCan this be done via Automator, AppleScript, or some other means?\n\nA: If you don't actually need the content of the file, you could link it to /dev/null which means that anything written to the file will disappear immediately. To do so\n\n\n*\n\n*quit the application\n\n*rm /path/to/logfile\n\n*ln -s /dev/null /path/to/logfile\n\nA: Since symlinking doesn't work you could use a cronjob to just clear the file every now and then.\nFor that you will need the Terminal. If you are not familiar, here is an introduction.\nUse the following command to open the crontab file (just call crontab -e if you want to use vim instead):\nEDITOR=nano crontab -e\n\nInsert the following and save the file (with Ctrl-X -> y -> enter). You must change the file to the log file\n0 */1 * * * > \"/Users/chaos/Library/Logs/SomeLog.log\"\n\nLet me explain: 0 */1 * * * means that on every full hour the command will be executed (unless it's turned off of course). See wikipedia for more info.\nThe command being executed is basically saying \"redirect nothing to the file\" effectively truncating it to 0 bytes. You may recognize it from echo something > somefile.log.\nFYI: The cron daemon will automatically be started by launchd if a cronfile exists.\n\nA: Well it turns out that while it will be somewhat tricky to actually monitor the file in question to only delete it as needed,it's trivial in Automator to simply quit the running service, delete the logfile, and re-launch the service.  I can then simply execute this job every day at say 4am when nobody is likely to be watching anything from either server, and things should be good.  Thanks @patrix, @2called-chaos, and @mark for ultimately all leading me to this solution.\n", "Q: Does the iPhone 5s have any built in water protection mechanisms? I seem to have dodged a bullet.\nLast weekend my iPhone 5s managed to make it into the washing machine. I think realized my mistake about 10 minutes into the wash and dug out a thoroughly waterlogged device. It was powered on when it was submerged, but powered off when I pulled it out.\nI took the internet's advice and left it sealed in a plastic bag of uncooked rice. I powered it on today and all is apparently well apart from some interesting display artifacts (those are not reflections - this is how the display looks from just about any angle):\n\nFingers crossed it hold up till the end of the contract.\nGiven the thoroughness of this submerging, I'm actually quite surprised at how well this device has faired.  Not only was it in for 10 minutes or more (dripping when it came out), but the water was far from pure - laundry soap + whatever dirt was coming out of the laundry load.  I assume such grey water has a much lower electrical resistance than pure water, and would therefore be much more damaging to electrical circuitry.\nSo, does this iPhone have any built-in water protection mechanisms?  It did power itself off, but perhaps this was just undefined behaviour.  Or did I just get very lucky?\n\nSide question - I'm about 6 months into my present 2 year contract.  Whats the likelihood this phone will make it to the next upgrade cycle?\n\nA: To specifically answer your question, the iPhone (6 and lower)* does not have any specific water protection built in. In fact, there are \"sensors\" that will turn red (from white) if the phone has been exposed to water. One of them is inside the headphone port and I believe there is another one but don't remember where. \nSome generations of iPhone survive better than other by more or less accident and some of it has to do with your exact situation. It sounds like you were fortunate. \nDue to the severity of the incident, I wouldn't be surprised if the phone does die at some time within the next 1.5 years. However, considering it appears to work almost like-new (aside from the screen), your chances of making the contract are still decent. \n* the iPhone 6S is actually somewhat water resistant even though Apple didn't advertise it as such.\n", "Q: nsurlsessiond downloads too much data I did this command in terminal and got this results.

If you miss the threshold narrowly you may remove swap files, sleepimage and clean the temp folders to lose further GBs.\nIn this particular case you may add a second volume with the same size as your then narrowed previous main volume, which is equivalent to splitting the available space in two equal volumes (with the first volume still containing your old OS X installation).\nAfter installing your new OS X to the new volume (\"El Capitan\") you may transfer your apps, settings and data to the new volume.\nAfter migrating your stuff you have to delete the old CoreStorage Logical Volume Group (the superior Macintosh HD) with:\ndiskutil cs delete lvgUUID\n\nwith lvgUUID: UUID of the Logical Volume Group. To get the lvgUUID use:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nDeleting the Logical Volume Group will automatically create one new classical JHFS+ volume with the name \"Untitled\" occupying all available space on the disk. \nNow clone your new volume \"El Capitan\" to the empty volume \"Untitled\" with an appropriate tool (Disk Utility/Carbon Copy CLoner). The former \"Untitled\" will be renamed to \"El Capitan\". So rename the former \"El Capitan\" to \"El Capitan_Old\"\nAfter successfully booting from \"El Capitan\", delete \"El Capitan_Old\" with Disk Utility and expand \"El Capitan\" to the full available size of your disk.\n\nIf more than one half of your (old) main volume is occupied you need an external disk to migrate or you have to delete some data.\n", "Q: Harmful to never put to sleep / shut down a mac? Is it harmful for a mac in any way to never put it to sleep, or to turn it off?\nI have a macbook air and an iMac that I set to never sleep in the settings. Only the displays go to sleep. I turn them off once a month. I am afraid that they could be damaged over time if I keep doing it. Could it happen?\n\nA: One way I can see potential damage is wear and tear of moving parts inside the computer, such as any hard disk drives and fans. Be aware that the fan may draw in a lot of dust if the computer is constantly running, and you may need to clean the inside of your computer at one point.\n\nA: I administer a small network of Macs, servers and iOS devices and have been doing exactly the same thing for many years, I personally think (although can't confirm) that it adds longevity to the machine, I currently have a mac mini that is 8 years old running perfectly using this practice.\n\nA: You can safely leave your Mac powered on all the time.\nSafe and Harmless\nThere is no practical damage or harm that will occur because the Mac is constantly running. Use your Mac as best suits your needs.\nRestarting is helpful every so often – if only to install updates and clear out caches or temporary files.\nEnvironment\nAs 1lann mentions, environmental factors like dust and heat build-up should be considered. Keep your Mac away from sources of dust, like limestone or sandstone walls, where the fans can draw in surprising amounts of particulate matter.\n", "Q: How to remotely access a Mac from my iOS app? I'd like to remotely access a Mac mini from my iPad app.   The simplest method appears to be via SSH but I've read this requires jailbreaking the iPad and I don't want that.   Is there an 'Apple approved' method to so this?\nI don't currently need access via the internet, just via the local network.   Note that some changes will require password authentication; passwords can be encrypted in the iPad app to ensure security isn't compromised over the network.\n\nA: I'm assuming that you're an application developer since you said \"my iPad app\".\nSSH works over standard TCP, it does not require jailbreaking, so you could use that (Here's a library to use SSH with: https://github.com/Lejdborg/NMSSH). You'll just need to enable SSH (Remote Login) in the Sharing settings of the OS X computer. I'm not aware of any other non-proprietary services you can use that is built into a Mac to execute commands on it remotely. You could alternatively run your own service running on the Mac to remotely control it.\nIf all you need is file access, you can use AFP (Apple File Protocol) or SMB (Server Message Block) through File Sharing in Sharing settings in OS X. Or SFTP through Remote Login. You can find example client implementations of those online.\n", "Q: openpgp2ssh (monkeysphere tool) installed with Homebrew on OS X error Can't locate Crypt/OpenSSL/Bignum.pm in @INC I am trying to install monkeysphere on an OS X machine with Homebrew:\n$ brew install monkeysphere\nmonkeysphere: Unsatisfied dependency: Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum\nHomebrew does not provide Perl dependencies; install with:\n  cpan -i Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum\nError: An unsatisfied requirement failed this build.\n\nmonkeysphere needs the Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum perl module and Homebrew is telling me to use the command cpan -i Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum in order to install that module.

I have to place the mouse pointer onto them to expand it and see the thumbnails.\nIs there any way I can get the previous behaviour back?\n\nA: Although BetterTouchTool (BTT) now has the \"Mission Control & Immediately Show Desktop Previews\" action that you can assign to a trackpad gesture, there is an annoying delay between when mission control starts and when the desktop previews are displayed. \nI've stumbled onto a macro similar to, but slightly different from the one suggested by @Arctus, that gets me back to nearly the same behavior as in Yosemite.\nStep one is to enable the upper left \"hot corner\" to show mission control.\n\nStep two is the following macro in BTT:\n\nEDIT: You also have to have the standard trackpad mission control gesture set for either three or four finger swipe up (doesn't seem to matter which).\n\n\nA: Edit 1/30/16:\nAfter using a few different options in my daily workflow over the past few months, I've settled on almost exactly the solution proposed by @Arctus. Despite requiring a 3rd-party program, BetterTouchTool (BTT), I believe it to be the best current option. \nSee @Arctus's answer for the general method and a helpful screenshot. Here are the specifics that were missing from that post:\n\n\n*\n\n*You want to make sure that you have the mission control gesture turned on in your system preferences and set to either a 3- or 4-finger swipe up (the only options). (I tried adding a step to my BTT macro to open mission control, but I abandoned that because you lose the ability to use the inverse gesture, a 3- or 4-finger swipe down, to close Mission Control.)\n\n*For the \"Delay Next Action\" step, you'll most likely need to set it to at least 0.06 seconds. I settled on 0.08 seconds. (I tried shorter durations like 0.02 and 0.03 seconds, but they didn't work consistently. It seems that sometimes that was too fast so it didn't trigger the expansion. YRMV on this, so if it's not working for you, or if it only works sometimes, try increasing this a bit.)\n\n*For the \"Move Mouse To\" step, I found best results using the exact top-middle of my screen. (ex: My screen width is 1280 pixels, so I used x=640, y=0.)\n\n\nYou'll probably notice that BTT actually has a predefined action called \"Mission Control & Immediately Show Desktop Previews\". Unfortunately, it has an annoyingly long delay between opening mission control and expanding the desktop previews that made it unusable for me. This custom solution is very smooth, very consistent, and doesn't seem to cause any undesired behavior. \nThe other main variation of the BetterTouchTool method is to use either the top-left or top-right hot-corners to open mission control and then to use BTT to move your mouse to the corner and back upon your chosen gesture. This allows other gestures besides 3- or 4-finger swipe up, but it introduces a hot corner that you may not want. I found that I was triggering the hot corner accidentally far too often for this to be a viable option for me. Again, YRMV. \nI'm not an expert at BTT by any means, but if anyone has any questions, I'm happy to try to help. Good luck! \n/edit\n\nOriginal Post:\nEl Capitan Mission Control Mechanics\nAs Fletcher91 mentioned, thumbnails are collapsed by default if you launch Mission Control from a \"Desktop Space\" (a Space with a name like \"Desktop 1\", \"Desktop 4\", etc.) whereas the thumbnails are expanded by default if you launch Mission Control from a \"Fullscreen App Space\" (a Space that was generated by fullscreen-ing a window and that is named for that app window, like \"Notes\" or the title of a webpage if it's a browser window). \nThe reason for this is that Mission Control serves two functions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Display all open windows in your current Desktop Space to enable easy switching between them (the \"all-open-windows\" view).\n\n*Display the list of all Spaces to enable easy switching between them. \nAn Apple rep I spoke to told me that that the motivation behind collapsing the thumbnails when opening Mission Control from a Desktop Space was to provide more screen real-estate to the all-open-windows view and to reduce clutter. When opening Mission Control from a Fullscreen App Space, the focus changes to the all-open-windows view for the most recently viewed Desktop Space and the thumbnails are expanded (unfounded speculation: presumably this is because for Fullscreen App Spaces, there are no other windows in the same Space, so the only reason to open Mission Control would be to switch Spaces). \n\nAny way to always show thumbnails by default?\nThe Apple rep also confirmed that there is currently no way to enable thumbnail expansion by default. \nHowever, I did some research and tested out a few other answers and I've been able to confirmed some special cases that may be useful: \n\n\n*\n\n*If you use \"Hot Corners\" System Preferences >> Mission Control and set either the top-left or top-right corners to open Mission Control, it simulates the old behavior, but only because in triggering the Hot Corner callback, you've placed your mouse within the area that triggers the thumbnail expansion anyway). Unfortunately, this is probably the best option at this point, even though it involves changing a habit which isn't always easy. If you go with this approach, I recommend disabling the trackpad gesture so that this is the only way you can do it—at least until the habit sinks in. \n\n*As akaRem mentioned, if you open enough Spaces, Mission Control thumbnails will be expanded by default! I tested this on my 13\" 2013 MBP Retina using all fullscreen Chrome Spaces, all desktop Spaces, and various combinations of the two along with some other random Spaces (including the Dashboard Space both on and off) and it always took exactly 13 spaces to make it so that the thumbnails were expanded by default when opening Mission Control from a Desktop Space, which is a different number from akaRem. I don't know if it varies with hardware or what, but it's interesting. (If anyone else tests this, let me know your results). Ultimately though, this is not a practical solution. \n\n*The closest thing to a usable workaround that we have at this point (if you want to open Mission Control with gestures or hotkeys) is to use third-party software like BetterTouchTool to create a macro that executes on your chosen gesture like Arctus's did. \nLike others here, I have submitted feedback to Apple for this issue. Here's the link if you want to do the same. \n\nA: Playing around, I've learned that thumbnails are only displayed when the user switches to mission control while having a full screen app active.\nIf you use multiple monitors, all the screens must have an application running in full screen mode enabled.\nSo for the time being, try to have a full screen app on all monitors.\n\nA: I found some kind of workaround.\nWhen you have lots of spaces they will be shown as expanded thumbnails even if Mission Control is launched from regular Desktop.\nFor example, on my MacBook Pro 13, when I have 1 Desktop + 7 Fullscreen Safari or 3 Desktop + 6 Fullscreen Safari, then everything is shown like before.\n\nA: A friend of mine who has the 10.11.4 beta said this implementation is coming back. It would be nice if they made this a preference. Here is the screenshot he sent me:\n\nEdit: This information is incorrect. Mission control shows thumbnails instantly when there is a large number of spaces.\n\nA: Sierra/High Sierra update\nTo follow up on Kevin C.'s answer, the author of forceFullDesktopBar has created a new version, https://github.com/briankendall/missionControlFullDesktopBar, which works on 10.12+. It was a bit involved to install but works great for me -- the only solution I've found that has no delay at all!\nSetup steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the Mission Control gesture in System Preferences -> Trackpad.\n\n*Clone the missionControlFullDesktopBar repository\n\n\n*\n\n*git clone https://github.com/briankendall/missionControlFullDeskopBar\n\n\n*Open missionControlFullDeskopBar.xcodeproj in Xcode.\n\n*Build the project (⌘B).\n\n*Find out where it went by checking File -> Project Settings.... On my machine it's ~/Library/Developer Tools/Xcode/DerivedData. And there will be a folder in there that starts with the project name (e.g., missionControlFullDeskopBar-cjhllkdjkhncuzglpiezmyqmdufu).\n\n*In BetterTouchTool, bind your Mission Control shortcut to Execute Shell Script / Task. As the Launch Path, enter the full path to the compiled executable: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/missionControlFullDesktopBar-cjhllkdjkhncuzglpiezmyqmdufu/Build/Products/Debug/missionControlFullDesktopBar.app/Contents/MacOS/missionControlFullDesktopBar (adjust if your paths are different). As Parameter, enter -d -i.\n\nOptional: bind another shortcut for dismissing Mission Control. I was used to the four-finger swipe down to dismiss, but disabling the four-finger swipe up in System Preferences got rid of this. As quick fix, I bound four-finger swipe down to Escape in BTT. Full BTT setup:\n\n\nA: Yes, this is very annoying\nI submitted feedback at\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\nI suggest everyone who agrees does the same as this is either a bug or design regression. \n\nA: Okay guys, I have a quick workaround for High Sierra that will restore the old behavior without third party tools, or gestures that don't feel right. HOWEVER, you'll need to be connected to an external monitor. Here's what you do:\n1) In Preferences>Mission Control, turn on \"Displays Have Separate Spaces\" (I don't know if this is necessary, but I'd have to log-out to test this)\n2) On the external monitor, fullscreen whichever app you have on there\n3) Tada! Now all your monitors' spaces are expanded into thumbnail view by default, even the ones with only 2-3 spaces. \nYou can choose to make fullscreen in whichever monitor you want, probably one that's not your main. You have to keep the app on the external monitor fullscreen in order for the other monitors to have thumbnail spaces previews.\n\nA: A work around I have is to set a hot corner to the top left to open mission control. That way, when I open mission control via this, they are already expanded. \nThis still works, but bettertouchtools 1.24 has added a show mission control and immediately show desktop previous which works pretty much perfectly. \n\nA: I managed to get around this for the time being using BetterTouchTools. Specifically I've set my 3 finger swipe gesture to move the mouse to the top of the screen and back again. It's seamless enough that I don't see the mouse actually move so it'll do for now.\n\nMeanwhile I too have submitted feedback to Apple about this change. \nIt does seem like they're pushing everyone to use their fullscreen feature which does automatically expand the spaces bar when Mission Control is opened from a fullscreen application/desktop. But many of us BetterTouchTool users specifically don't like the way OSX's fullscreen feature operates and therefore don't use it. \nIf there were an option for the default fullscreen feature to always show and not hide the OSX menu bar I'd probably get used to it. Options are good :)\n\nA: Developer Brian Kendall has created this for restoring the old behaviour: https://github.com/briankendall/forceFullDesktopBar\nIt injects code into the Dock process to call the method that shows mission control with the showFullBarparameter set to true. So while it's a hack, it's a pretty clean one that works well for all the different ways to activate mission control (e.g., I use a keyboard shortcut, 2-finger tap on magic mouse, and 3-finger swipe up on trackpad).\nIt's puzzling why Apple didn't include this setting as a preference when it's that simple.\n\nA: This is an old post, but I just hope I can help someone else by sharing.\nI am using a simple combination of cliclick and skhd. cliclick is able to manipulate mouse cursor, while skhd is able to send arbitrary shell commands with keyboard shortcuts.\nNote that my setup is for something who does not use a mouse. I use yabai and skhdrc to minimize the dependency of using a mouse.\nThe steps are:\n\n*\n\n*Set hot corner to Mission control\n\n*Install cliclick and skhd using homebrew\n\n*Map a keyboard shortcut that moves your mouse to a corner in ~/.skhdrc:\n\n# 0,0 represents the mouse coordinates\nshift + cmd - m : cliclick -r m:0,0\n\nYou can also refer to my .skhdrc\n\nA: In addition to pjv's and Arctus' answer, I found the temporary mouse coordinate of (0,0) to not reliably trigger the spaces preview. Half of my display resolution on the x-axis and a little deviation on the y-axis are working fine, though. On my MacBook Air with a 1440x900 resolution, (720,25) is a robust setting.\n\nA: To throw another hat in the ring for Better Touch Tool, it looks like they now provide this action right out of the box:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Select Global Application\n\n\n*Select Touchpad Gesture\n\n\n*Add a New Gesture\n\n\n*Select \"3 Finger Swipe Up\"\n\n\n*Choose Predefined Action\n\n\n*Search for \"Mission Control & Immediately Show Desktop Preview\"\n\n\n*It should look like this at the end\n\n\n\nA: missionControlFullDesktopBar works great on High Sierra.

You can download the original photos and videos over Wi-Fi or cellular when you need them.\n\nFrom: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204264\nI don't use iCloud Photo Library, so I'm not sure if there's a way to completely remove the photo from your device and keep it in iCloud.\n", "Q: How to get native resolution on Macbook Air external monitor? I am using an Asus external monitor with 1600 x 900 native resolution connected to my Macbook Air (Yosemite) using a mini display port to VGA adapter.  When I try to set the display resolution in System Preferences > Displays, I click \"options\" and \"Scaled\" to see a list of additional resolutions ranging from 800 x 600 through 1920 x 1080.  For some reason 1600 x 900, the native resolution of the external display is not listed.  1920 x 1080 is the closest match to the native resolution, but it looks awful.  How can I set the resolution to 1600 x 900?\n\nA: The most likely explanation is that your miniDP to VGA adapter is not an original/high-quality one. I've seen it happen before, and as soon as that person bought an original Apple miniDP to VGA adapter the issue is gone and native resolution is recognized without any issue.\n\nA: In System Preferences > Display choose Resolution: Default for display - that should set it to whatever your monitor advertises as it's native screen size.\nGenerally, if you can, try not to use VGA - try to use at least DVI.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Fan fullspeed, no temperature and keyboard backlight I've got a Macbook Pro 2008 15\" 4,1 with OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 and the latest Firmware and both fans run the whole time at fullspeed. My research brings up, that it's probably the temperature Sensor, because every Software I use to get Information about the temperature it says 0 degrees. For Example iStats says 0 degrees and 0 fans found. The keyboard backlight doesn't work either. (altough it's enabled in preferences). All in all this sounds like a problem where SMC reset would help. Unfortunatelly I have no Battery (it blew up), so I did the reset without the battery part (cant tell if it makes a difference)\nApple Hardware Test couldn't find any problems on my System (both tests). The RAM has been upgraded a while back, but all ribbon cables are correctly connected. \n\nDoes anybody know how I can solve this problem? The CPU load is constantly pretty low and the MacBook is pretty cold at all.\nLog Files\na lot of smc errors:\nhttp://pastebin.com/egYkGMrz\nInteresting part:\nSep 13 21:18:09 Dominiks-MBP kernel[0]: WARNING - ACPI_SMC_CtrlLoop::initCPUCtrlLoop - no sub-config match for MacBookPro4,1 with 8 p-states, using default stepper instead\n\n\nA: SMC Reset\nTo your minor question: I do not think the absence of the battery should affect the SMC reset. Source: I have successfully done this with an older mac with no battery and corrected fan problems.\nKey Observations\nSince it is not obvious what your problem is, I will cover some bases starting with some key observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*You did not mention resetting the NVRAM/PRAM which I also did when fixing my fan issue. Have you also reset the PRAM/NVRAM? That would one of the two immediate troubleshooting steps I would do with something that looks like a firmware issue. (I believe you hold down the key for 3 chimes btw… not sure if it tells you that on the site.) \n\n*Since your diagnostics do not appear to be reading your CPU temperature accurately (it should definitely not be 0C (34 degrees F). I would try again with a different diagnostic, and/or repair permissions using diskutil, run with sudo to ensure the program is able to access the requisite files to generate real output. \nTroubleshooting\nSome possibilities and thoughts to facilitate further troubleshooting:\nWhile in diskutil I would check that your drive is in good health. HDD's only operate for 5-10 years. My 08 pro has a dead drive… it may be working hard to keep it at a low temp so it doesn't lock up? Physical wear on the drive can also generate heat. \nI would check out your system diagnostics to see if anything is hogging resources. Assuming your hardware isn't screwed up and it's not firmware, I would check to make sure the kernel isn't panicked or some weird unrecognized process isn't interfering with your system. \nI note that without an intermediary battery your computer may not be getting a completely regular power source… what comes out of your wall may be lower or higher voltage than expected. Sometimes that generates heat and causes fans to go insane. Sometimes that can \"zap\" files. You may wish to reinstall your OS without deleting your files and configurations, to make sure everything is in good order. \nYou may also wish to get your hands on a battery to see if that makes a difference. These cannot be too expensive nowadays… someone may have one laying around. The fact that yours once exploded also… you may be able to get one from Apple even if you're not covered. They really don't get a lot out of keeping and warehousing old parts (why applecare is a good money maker for them) and like happy campers and I think that battery was recalled no? You may have been entitled to a new one years ago anyway.\nYou may also have already tried this but checking the logs at /var/log/system.logs (hard to parse) may provide a big picture view of what's going on with the fans even if it's not entirely understandable or easy to get through… sometimes the error messages are verbose and incredibly precise. Hit or miss. It will be FULL of entries that don't matter, but may tell you quite clearly what's going on if you just do a find for like \"fan\" \"heat\" \"power\" \"voltage.\"\nFinally (albeit obviously) you may want to make sure you don't have a ton of crud clogging up your fans or blocking. Cleaning a computer directly or with air can easily mess things up… but yeah… this may be necessary. If a sensor cannot get a read on heat or a fan is covered in gunk it may run the fans at full just to get normal cooling in order (first case) or because it's designed to be cautious about the heat issue (second case). \n\nA: The battery came today, i didnt even noticed that the macbook booted, as there where no noise coming from the fan. Also the keyboard backlight worked straight out of the box. So, my smc-reset either didnt worked without the battery or the ac adapter couldnt find enough voltage. All in all its working like a charm :)  thank you!\n", "Q: How to upgrade to OS X El Capitan? My question would be how to update to OS X El Capitan (the release-version on September 30th) in a \"safe\" way. Of course I'll make a backup of my whole machine, but I'm particularly concerned, as I've some homebrew-packages and ruby-gems installed as well as the zsh-shell (all in their standard directories, mostly somewhere in /usr/...). And I don't want that things get messed up.\nDoes anyone have experience with an update messing things up, or will it be no problem? \n\nA: There is never a safe upgrade. Even if millions of beta testers ran the installation script and nothing bad happened, they didn't have your system and your data. If your filesystem has errors, you can render your Mac unstartable by running any system update. Running a migration script could delete files you care about, could break your software, or could expose damage that already exists.\nFor those reasons you should always back up your Mac and estimate how long it would take you to wipe the Mac, re-download the installer (if you don't save a copy) and then re-run the migration. If you don't have time to do a complete restore or the copies of OS and procedure to recover, you should probably pass on the update.\nIf you have a backup plan that makes a bootable backup of your OS, you could simply test one of those bootable backups before letting the installation run on your Main OS - keeping the backup handy and safe.\nIf you don't have a bootable backup, then you might spend more time and install a clean El Capitan onto a USB hard drive and then migrate the data from your current boot drive.\nThen you can use the Startup Disk system preference to choose to boot into 10.11 or 10.10 for as long as it takes to make sure your critical apps and settings are compatible with 10.11. Either way, you'll need to look over all your Apps - potentially apply updates to them or wait for vendor engineering and QA to release changes needed for 10.11.\n\n\n*\n\n*homebrew already has changes for 10.11 but it's explicitly not supported, so there will be time and breakage anticipated on that front\n\n*zsh shouldn't be a large issue, but again - until you test your setup - who can guess...\n\n\nThat removes the pressure and stress of having all your eggs in one basket. I've been running 10.11 for quite some time and it's actually more stable for what I do than 10.10, but that's probably not everyone's experience.\nYou could always be lucky, install the 10.11.0 build with no backups and no contingency plans, but I wouldn't advise it without some prudent preparations in case your upgrade doesn't go smoothly.\n", "Q: Recommendations for note-taking app for Iphone that does NOT sync to the cloud I am moderately happy with the current (iOS 8) Notes app in my Iphone, and specially with the fact that I can sync it locally to my PC using iTunes, without using iCloud. The only thing I'm really missing is the ability to organize notes by folders.\nNow comes the new Notes app in iOS 9, which seems to be the opposite: you can at last have folders, but you have to use iCloud to backup the notes. I've been looking for a note-taking app that can have folders (or tags) and does NOT require you to upload your notes to some cloud in order to sync them, and after searching up and down, the only one I've found is Notebooks, which seems fine, but I'd like to see if there are any other options around.\nIs there any other app I am missing? (Syncing locally to a WebDAV server instead of iTunes is fine, if I have to).\n\nA: No need for another app, there is a solution for syncing the iOS Notes app without using iCloud or any other third-party service.  Since you mentioned WebDAV, I assume you are willing to provide your own server.  It takes a little bit of setup, but if you create your own email server (specifically an IMAP server), Notes will sync to it.  There is no need to support sending mail at all, just IMAP, with which you will be able to create folders.  Just add new email account and turn on the \"Notes\" option for the account.  I believe the server version of OS X will even has an email server built in with easy setup, though there are many other good options such as courier or dovecot.  If you are happy only syncing at home, you don't even have to expose the server to the public internet, or you can get a domain name (or dynamic DNS service) and sync to your home server wherever you have internet access.  Note that new features in iOS 9 notes, such as handwriting and lists, are unsupported in IMAP notes accounts, but everything doable in iOS 8 is still possible including attaching images.\n\nA: You can check your iCloud settings and disable syncing of the Notes app to iCloud.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 without a SIM card I just recently purchased an iPhone 4 on Amazon that doesn't have a SIM card. I was planning to use it as an iPod, because my parents wouldn't and couldn't buy me a phone with a plan. So I was just wondering if I could activate it on the spot when I get it in the mail.\n\nA: I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but the CDMA (Verizon and Sprint) iPhone 4 does not have a SIM card slot, and thus doesn't require one to activate the iPhone on a carrier.\n", "Q: Can I get a male Thunderbolt to female USB 3.0 adapter? I have an early 2011 MacBook Pro that has now 1 terabyte of storage, but want to connect a external hard drive via the fastest connection possible. It didn't come with USB 3.0 but 2x USB 2.0 and Thunderbolt port. Can I get a male Thunderbolt to female USB 3.0 adapter?\n\nA: The Thunderbolt port on your MacBook Pro is already faster than USB 3 so the fastest possible connection of an external storage device would be to attach a Thunderbolt drive via the Thunderbolt port.\nNote that Thunderbolt is a faster interface than a hard disk can accept or push data so for top speed you will either need a RAID configured for speed or an SSD drive.\n\nA: You can find now @ amazon or ebay http://www.ebay.com/itm/Thunderbolt-Port-to-USB-3-0-Super-Speed-Hard-Disk-Drive-Adapter-Dongle-for-Apple-/141776189587\n\nA: You can simply buy a Thunderbolt external hard drive like this durable and portable one from LaCie. Be aware that these drives tend to be more expensive, but by the time you've bought a USB3.0 to Thunderbolt adapter and hard drive, you're better off going for the native Thunderbolt drive with USB3.0 connectivity as well.\n", "Q: Can you turn off Messages and still get iMessages from others? My daughter is constantly eating up data and uses Messages. I want that she does not get any iMessages until she is connected via Wi-Fi. \nIs there a option to turn off Messages when on the Cellular Network? \n\nA: You can disable which app is using the most data instead. Some apps download data for updates, etc. For sure it's not the Messages app.\nAnd for the Messages app, there's just an option to send an iMessage as a text message when cellular data is not available.\nTo know more, check this link from Apple.\n", "Q: Can Spotlight search for text within Safari for iPhone? Is there a way to search text within Safari by doing a Spotlight search on an iPhone? There currently is no such way to run a find/search within Safari (boo), so I need a work around.\n\nA: No, Spotlight doesn't search the current page from within Mobile Safari (but it does search Reading List and other saved/bookmarked pages) but you don't need a workaround since this function exists in Safari.\nIt used to look like this. \nOn iOS 9, it's integrated with the main search field - begin like you're searching for a new web page and then scroll down to \"On this page\"\n\nOnce you tap that, you get this interface to pan to each instance of the search results with the term highlighted.\n\n", "Q: How to download entire iCloud Photo Libary to Windows PC Is there a way I can download my entire iCloud Photo Libary to my windows PC then clear the iCloud Photo Libary to free up space on my iCloud account?\nI have spent the past hour researching this and I'm still no further on...\n\nA: This strategy works at the time of writing using nothing but the PC.\n\n*\n\n*Install iCloud for Windows\n\n*Open File Explorer and open the context menu (right-click) on the iCloud Photos entry in the left-hand-side panel (image below)\n\n*Select 'Always keep on this device', and wait for the green progress bar across the path to disappear - every file should now have a green tick as its 'status' indicator\n\n\n\n\n*Once this is done, copy files across to a part of your hard drive that isn't managed by iCloud\n\n*Open iCloud, untick 'Photos', activate via the 'Apply' button, and confirm 'Delete from PC'.\n\nYour iCloud Photos are now un-synced from your PC but all the files will be in the location you chose in step 4.\n\nA: Apple doesn't have a Photos app for PC, so the easiest way would be to borrow a Mac and log in to a new user and download all the photos to the Mac. \nAt that point, you can export the entire library to storage that's readable by your PC.\nIf you only have easy access to an iOS device, then you'll want to look into apps that can ingest all the local versions of the library and upload it to their cloud. Flickr, google, dropbox all come to mind with native apps that want to store all your photos in the cloud. You could try those to see how easy their export from cloud to PC is.\nThe share sheet on iOS 9 and the Photos app on iOS look like they will save entire albums to DropBox, but you could run into storage issues and have to chunk things a few GB at a time.\nIf I were to do this, I'd probably use the Workflow app to automate the saving of the files to the location of your choice. It has built in save to iCloud Documents which would work with iCloud software on PC.\nLastly, you could try using iTunes to copy the files to your PC. I don't have a PC to test, but that might be the simplest option if it works.\n\nA: Yes, as of July 2018, using the iCloud for Windows software, you can download your entire iCloud Photo Library in a single operation using the Download photos and videos feature, which appears as a button in the toolbar of the iCloud Photos folder in Windows Explorer.\nFrom the Apple support article:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open a File Explorer window.\n  \n*Under Favorites, click iCloud Photos.\n  \n*Click Download photos and videos.\n  \n*Choose the photos and videos you want to download and click Download.\n  \n  \n  Your photos and videos download to the location you set in iCloud Photos Options.\n\nThis feature isn't easy to find, but works as advertised.  Note that in Windows 10, you might not see a Favorites folder, but you will see Quick access instead.\nTo answer the second half of your question, you can delete the complete contents of your iCloud Photo Library directly on your iOS device.  Simply open the Photos app, navigate to Albums and open All Photos.  From there, press Select, and using a diagonal motion, select all of the images at once.  You might need to try a few times to accomplish this as the gesture is tricky to pull off.  Once you've selected all of the photos, press the Trash can to remove the photos from your library.\n", "Q: Jumping between full screens in Yosemite? I like having many full screens open (in the same ‘space’), but it bothers me that I have to press CMD+right twice to get from 1 to 3; it should be possible to jump directly to 3 with a shortcut like ctrl+3. Or is it?\nPS. Sorry, I meant: can one jump between spaces within the same desktop?\n\nA: Yes, you can certainly do so.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Keyboard\n\n*From there select Shortcuts\n\n*Mission Control\n\n*Tick the boxes for the Desktops you want.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: One quick way to to move is to ⌘+tab to switch between open applications.  Otherwise, you can submit feedback to Apple.\n\nOS X 10.11 El Capitan will feature having a Split View which may be more convenient when rolled out.\n", "Q: How to add multiple phone numbers to iMessage? Is there a way to add more than one number to iMessage?\n\nA: Yes, there is a way to add more than one number to iMessage. Just establish cellular service and SMS capability from any carrier you choose for each phone number you wish to have for iMessage. On each iPhone that has that service, sign in to iMessage.\nI've had three numbers with one Apple ID in the past, so it wasn't a problem other than the obvious one of having three phones.\n", "Q: How can I tell which Apple ID has signed/purchased specific apps on iOS? I have an iPhone I'm trying to restore and the restore keeps failing. Specifically, I'm asked to enter the password for family members. I must decline that for secret reasons. Also, family sharing doesn't make me enter my family member's password, so why does that happen when restoring a backup?\nIn order to pick this apart, I'd like to inspect the apps on my iPhone 6 with iOS 9.1 so I can determine which ones are not purchased from my Apple ID. \nI have Xcode, libimobiledevice from homebrew on OS X 10.11, iTunes can back up the phone and I can inspect the files on the Mac if there's no way to access this data from iOS - which I'd prefer. Basically, how can I enumerate all apps and determine which ones will prevent me from using an iCloud backup to restore that app using solely my Apple ID and not need the password of a family member.\nHow can I identify the signing identity used for each app on the iPhone by hook or by crook?\n\nA: I had found a script that can list iTunes apps by purchase here (author: Walt Stoneburner). The link is now broken, but I had archived that page 3 years ago. This is the script:\nfor f in ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/Mobile\\ Applications/*.ipa; \\\n do (echo \"$f\" ; unzip -p \"$f\" \"iTunesMetadata.plist\" | \\\n plutil -p - | egrep -i \"\\\"(itemName|artistName|AppleID)\\\"\" ) | \\\n perl -e 'while (<>) { if (m!^/!) { chop; $fqn=$_; } if (m/\"(.+)\" => (\".+\")/) { $e{lc($1)}=$2; } } print \"\\\"${fqn}\\\",$e{\\\"itemname\\\"},$e{\\\"artistname\\\"},$e{\\\"appleid\\\"}\\n\";'; \\\ndone\n\nThe script shoud be run in the terminal and the output will be printed into the standard output. If you want to redirect it to a file, add these parameters at the end of script (after done):\n1>~/Desktop/purchase_export_output.csv 2>~/Desktop/purchase_export_error.log\n\nNow you can open purchase_export_output.csv from your desktop. Its schema is like this:\n\"file.ipa\",\"Name\",\"Seller\",\"purchased_by\"\n\nIf any error occurs one line will be added to the purchase_export_error.log.\n\nA: PROBLEM SOLVED!  http://dougscripts.com/apps/appsassistapp.php\nIt runs a program that scans the entire apple app library on your computer iTunes and shows you a list, line a spread sheet, one of the tabs is \"Purchaser ID\", all right there it tells you all the apps by who, that way you can easily delete them from your devices and stop seeing the password request for the app.\n\nA: Sync your iPhone to iTunes, Select the App you want to know from which account it has been purchased, right click, go to Get info, under the File tab you will find something like below image where you can see who purchased the app. I have removed my Apple ID but the different names is for different accounts.\n\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to your Mac.

The iGPU is part of Intel's Iris Pro brand, which as I understand allows a VM to access the GPU directly with a native driver through GVT-d.\nI would like to run a Linux guest OS in this manner, giving it native access to the iGPU so that it can run a native driver (and thus have OpenGL 4.3 support). I have no idea how to go about doing this, though. I've heard there are forks of QEMU/KVM with GVT included, but I have no idea how to go about setting up a VM with one of those.\n\nA: Some further research has produced somewhat contrary answers. This forum thread seems to suggest that it's possible, but not for a Mac OS host. Conversely, here it's suggested that it's not possible to implement on a type-2 hypervisor like Virtualbox.\nI'm not entirely sure what to make of this, except maybe to suspect that it's possible to time-share an Intel GPU across multiple VMs with this method, but not to time-share an Intel GPU across a host and a guest.\nEither way, it seems the answer to this question would have to be No for the time being.\n", "Q: Trying to share a contact group on iPhone?

Again, only a reboot would stop it.\nSMC reset did not fix it.\nHow can I resolve this so that it does not happen again?\n\nA: I had a problem similar to this and it was because of a bluetooth mouse which had been left switched on in a bag. The button was held down by something resting on it and it was overriding the trackpad. If you use the keyboard shortcut (usually cmd+spacebar) to bring up spotlight and type bluetooth you can use the down arrow key to select the bluetooth system preference and you will be able to see if there is a connected mouse there causing the problem.\n", "Q: AirDrop from iPhone to MacBook stopped working (other way OK) I have an iPhone 5s (iOS 7.1) and a MBP (Retina, late 2013) (Yosemite).

This also creates\na MBR partition table.\n\n*Instruct VirtualBox to install Windows into the partition.\n\n*Boot Windows in the virtual world and run sysprep. This prepares\nWindows to run in the physical world.\n\n*Exit VirtualBox and boot Windows.\n\n*Install the Boot Camp Support Software.\n\n\nThe actual steps for for Windows 7 are given here. This has been used successfully on Mac's older than 2012. I am not sure about the 2012 model, because the Boot Camp Support Software has the folder $WinPEDriver$ and the file AutoUnattend.xml. You may need the next method.\nThe second method uses VirtualBox to simulate a Windows PE. Windows is never installed or executed in the virtual world. The outline follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create FAT formatted partition to install Windows. This also creates\na MBR partition table.\n\n*Copy the files on the Windows iso to this partition.\n\n*Copy the Boot Camp Support Software to this partition.\n\n*Create a small image file to hold the MBR bootstrap code.\n\n*Boot from the Windows iso using VirtualBox and run Windows commands\nmodify both partitions. Quit VirtualBox.\n\n*Copy the MBR bootstrap code to the MBR of the internal drive.\n\n*Boot the Windows partition and install windows.\n\n*Delete the iso files and the Boot Camp Support files. (optional)\nI don't know if these steps are given anywhere. The closest would be here for Windows 10.

I have a few pictures where the photo app has detected no faces at all.\nIs there a way to force the app to rescan those picture for faces?\n\nA: I have noticed on El Capitan and newer (Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey) Photos that manually adding faces on individual photos (cmd+i, click circle with + , position manually and resize circle, type person name) then skipping forward one by one (right arrow or slide) will rescan sequential photos.\nThen going directly to Faces and clicking person face which you were working on will suggest that more photos could be added.\nThis made Photos to gain additional 10-20% face recognition for me.\n\nA: You can manually add a face by clicking the the \"I\" info button and then click \"add faces\" in the floating palette \n\nA: It seems, that if Photos didn't found any faces, then ... well ... it won't find anymore no matter how many times you will scan it. Photos does not try to find a face similar to those you already have in your library, but just searches for something that looks in shape like face and then asks you if they are in fact faces.\nSome more info: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7056659\n", "Q: Why is Preview printing blurry text when there is colour in a document? When printing a colour document using Preview, some of the text is blurry. There are no problems printing the same document from Adobe Acrobat. Below is a scan of the Preview printout. There is no such blurriness to the Adobe Acrobat printout.\nThis problem has been niggling me for a good few years, with many different documents. It's certainly not isolated to one singular printer, or version of Preview or OS X.\nWhy does this happen, and how can I fix it?\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*the colour spaces in the original PDF are sRGB and gray.\n\n*as per the comments, I have used Acrobat to convert the page to a 1200 DPI, CMYK-format TIFF file. Printing this with Preview, all of the text is blurry (because the printer is using more than just black ink), but printing from Adobe Illustrator is perfectly sharp.\n\n*I expect that the problem is to do with colour-space conversions. But why Preview is printing some parts of the text as \"true black\" is beyond me. The fact that these regions are bounded by coloured parts of the document seems to stink of incompetent programming.\n\n\n\n\nA: I printed and then scanned the test document using my Canon MX850 (an ink jet printer with scanner, about 6 years old).\nIt's not perfect, but I don't see the issues (blurry text between the yellow boxes, purple stripes) that I see in your Ricoh version.\nSo I'd guess that the problem is the Ricoh drivers.\nOS X 10.9.5\nPrinted using Preview 7.0 (826.4)\nPrinter is Canon MX850\nPrinted using default settings (Print Quality: Standard)\nScanned at 300dpi.\n\n\n", "Q: Create a .pkg file from a .dmg in order to be used for auto-install ( Casper Composer ) I would like to create a .pkg file using the Casper composer but  i don't know which files of the .dmg to include .\nI appreciate your help .\n\nA: Try http://resources.jamfsoftware.com/documents/products/documentation/Composer-9.7-User-Guide.pdf page 12:\nComposer allows you to rebuild an existing package (PKG, DMG, or MPKG) by converting it to a package source.

I'm looking for high resolution 2560 x 1440 minimum / high framerate (60 Hz minimum) - and it should also work under Bootcamp Win7.\nI've been researching for 2 weeks now. AFAIK my MBP has Thunderbolt-ports that I can use as DisplayPort (but NOT v1.2) to achieve my goals. \nCan I run a 2560 x 1440 screen at 60hz with a Thunderbolt 1 to Displayport-cable? Or is Thunderbolt 1 even compatible with DP 1.2? \n\nA: Short Answer:The short answer to your question is:\n\nYes you can run a 2560 x 1400 @ 60Hz on an external monitor.  Thunderbolt compatibility doesn't matter since the only interface you need to and can work with is the mini display port (mDP).\nThe question now is, what are your \"goals?\"  Maybe we can direct you to a different solution.\n\nBackground\nThe MBP Mid-2012 only came with 512MB VRAM, not the 1GB you are specifying.  In any case, the maximum resolution you will ever get will be 2560 x 1600 MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012) - Technical Specifications\nThat said, there is no \"thunderbolt to display port\" adapter.  Below is a snipit from another answer where I addressed this very issue:\n\nNow, there is no \"Thunderbolt\" to DVI/HDMI because Thunderbolt is an extension of PCIe. So, in a very basic sense, this would be like trying to plug your monitor in directly to the logic board and not go through the video adapter; it cannot happen.\nHowever, Thunderbolt \"multiplexes\" the DisplayPort signal on that\n  single cable. You are going to get both. Now, if you use a a\n  Thunderbolt compatible cable, you can daisy chain additional TB\n  devices off your monitor, albeit at a reduced data transfer rate. This\n  is why monitors are the last in the chain. If you use a non-TB cable,\n  you will only get display and no TB signal.\n\nThe mini display port (mDP) on your MBP isn't going to give you any more resolution than your GPU is capable of delivering.  mDP 1.2 can support up to 4K video at 60Hhz; it's just your MBP can't deliver it.  Changing your cable to one that supports more bandwidth isn't going to give you more resolution the same way changing out your cat5 cable for cat6 will increase the bandwidth of your 1GB NIC.\n", "Q: Copy text from quick look in El Capitan or Sierra? I used to be able to just quicklook files and copy the text directly from there, removing the need to launch applications to open it which is just awesome, however, it doesn't seem to work since El Capitan.

I verified the file,\n  and it wrote the variable to it. The problem is somewhere in the\n  design. Maybe they have moved it? I have been looking in the\n  containers and other files but no luck yet. I hope they didn't\n  completely kill it. Maybe there is a way to copy the old Yosemite\n  version of QL back? If I figure it out, I will update here.\n  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7250702\n\n\n*TRUE - YES or 1 have the same effect, so, there is no problem on this side.\n\n*The option is no longer available on Onyx or TinkerTools too :\n\n\n\nConclusion :\nActually there is no solution to get back the text edit feature on Quick Look.\nFollowing this Apple Thread is the last way to keep hope\nIt is worth noting that you can copy from spotlight for certain files, as discovered here.

I'm wondering if there's a DAC in the dock because the first sound loudness level is noticeable higher than the first level from iPhone 6+ when the iPhone is mount on the dock.\nI suppose if there's a DAC that it has a lower resolution, i.e. less steps between silent and max loudness making each step wider on the dock.\n\nA: Yes, because the Lightning port is digital-only. The Apple Lightning to 30-Pin Adapter also contains a DAC, according to MacRumors.\nI don't know about the quality, but there is much more space for a good DAC in the dock then there is in the phone, so I wouldn't say it has to be worse.\n", "Q: Reload modified system plist I tried modifying a preference pane plist (with defaults write), but the change doesn’t take effect. Is there a way to make that happen?\n\nA: Assuming a newer version of OS X (10.9+ ?).\nYou have to kill two processes: the process that manages the preference you are modifying (e.g. killall Finder if it is com.apple.finder that you are modifying) and \"cfprefsd\".\n\"cfprefsd\" is a newer preference caching service of OS X.\nIn Terminal.app: killall cfprefsd && killall Finder.\nYou could also restart your computer.\n", "Q: Convert image type and save to relative folder with automator I found a question and working answer here How to create an Automator service to convert images from one file type into another file type using the right-click contextual menu? but it is saving the output file to desktop only.

I have lots of apps and data on my Mac so I just want to know if I install El Capitan, do I need to backup all data and apps or will my Mac retain the data and apps after updating it from app store?\nCopying all my data to external hard drive requires a lot of time so it will save my time.\n\nA: I'd always go for safety over a bit of time-saving, every single time.\nThough 99 times out of 100 you'll have no issues upgrading the OS, there's always that one time something unexpected happens.\nThere's also the chance you don't like it, don't think it does something you've been used to being a certain way, or isn't compatible with an important app you need.\nIn any of those cases, not having a backup could spell disaster, or at least major discomfort.\nPersonally, I always have a current Time Machine backup before updating, & I remove that Time Machine drive & replace it with another just before I actually hit the update button; I also clone the boot drive first, so I can quickly revert.  \nYou might think that is overkill, but I've never lost any data yet.\nLast time I did it was just last week - when I updated to the El Capitan GM & didn't like it at all ;-)\n", "Q: Installing Snow Leopard on external drive with newer iMac version I have two computers running different types of OS X. One is an iMac with Mavericks (10.9.5) and the other is a Macbook Pro with Snow Leopard (10.6.x). \nMy Macbook Pro isn't working (HDD problem), so I have bought another HDD for it. I've tried to install Snow Leopard (CD) in my newer HDD connected via USB to my iMac (cause if I try to install via Macbook Pro, it stuck in Apple logo), but when I try to install SL on external HDD it shows: You can't use this version of the application \"Install Mac OS X.app\" with this version of OS.\nIs there a way to bypass this message and install the OS on the external HDD?\nAdditional info\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro model: A1278 (EMC 2326*);\n\n*iMac model:  iMac is MB417XX/A (2009).\n\nA: Both Macs support 10.6.6 (the MacBook Pro probably was delivered with a Snow Leopard 10.6.6 DVD) as well as any later system up to at least 10.10 and both contain a DVD-drive. The MacBook Pro's optical drive seems to be damaged or malfunctioning.\nWithout manipulating the innards of Mavericks you usually can't install an older system over a newer system even if you install it to another volume. To circumvent this restriction use another method:\nHere is a straightforward guide how to clone the Snow Leopard DVD to a thumb drive, then boot a second Mac from the thumb drive and install the OS. You can use a modified guide to accomplish the same on your iMac without needing to manipulate your Mavericks system.\nFormat the external drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility and format the external drive.\n\n*Click the Partition tab\n\n*Under the Partition Layout header click on the 2 Partition option in the drop-down menu. One big partition and a second smaller one with at least 8 GB at the end. Use the options button to choose GUID partition table.\n\n*Click the Format drop-down menu and select Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\n\n*To format the external drive finally, click the Apply button in the lower right-hand corner of the Disk Utility window. \n\n\nRestore the Snow Leopard DVD or a Disk Image:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate a Snow Leopard disk image or DVD on the Mac\n\n*If you're using a disk image, mount it to the desktop\n\n*In the Disk Utility window, click the Restore tab in the external's drive's menu\n\n\nIn the center of the window you'll see two boxes: one labeled Source and another Destination. \n\n\n*\n\n*Drag-and-drop the second partition of the external drive into the Destination box \n\n*Drag-and-drop the Mac OS X Install Drive disk into the Source box\n\n*At the bottom right-hand corner of the screen and click the Restore button\n\n\nDisk Utility will restore the OS X Install DVD or disk image to the external drive; this process may take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour depending on how quick the Mac is. \nAfter the process has finished quit Disk Utility and try to reboot the iMac to the external disk. If the reboot is successful disassemble the external drive and move the disk to the MacBook Pro.\nBoot the MacBook Pro to the second partition and install Snow Leopard to the first partition of your MacBook Pro disk.\nAfter installing and rebooting to the first partition, open Disk Utility remove the second partition and expand the first partition to the full size.\n\nIf you have a spare thumb drive with at least 8 GB you may use this one instead and follow the guide in the link.\n\nA: This is an old thread but I ran into a similar issue. This was my solution:\n\n*\n\n*Install the new HD into the dead Mac and connect it to the working Mac with a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable\n\n*Boot the dead Mac into Target Disk Mode by holding down the T key\nwhile powering on and boot the working Mac normally\n\n*Open Disk Utility on the working Mac and partition the dead Mac's HD\ninto two partitions (using the correct partition scheme for the dead\nMac: Apple Partition Map for PowerPC, GUID for Intel); the second\npartition should be just large enough to contain the full Mac OS X\nInstall DVD (8GB should be enough), and the first\npartition should take up the rest of the HD.\n\n*Insert the Install DVD into the working Mac, select the second partition in Disk Utility's left column, click Edit > Restore..., select the Install DVD from the Restore from drodown, and click Restore.\n\n*When the restore is done, eject the dead Mac's HD, disconnect the cable, and reboot the dead Mac normally. It will boot the OS X Installer from the second partition; install OS X on the first partition.\n\n*When the install is done, the Mac will reboot normally into OS X; you can optionally delete the second partition and expand the first to take up the freed space but I'd just leave it alone if you have space to spare.\n\n", "Q: assigning static IP with command line I plugged my raspberry pi to my OSX 10.10 and I want to give the pi some static IP.

Perhaps it would be more suitable to just write a bash shell script. If you've never written a bash shell script before, it's easy to get started. You can simply type out the commands exactly how you've already demonstrated, but into some kind of text editor or notepad software, and save it with an .sh extension on the end.  \nWhen I first started learning about this stuff years ago I found nano to be a quick and easy text editor for learning and writing new material.

Do I have to mute it before putting to sleep to prevent from hearing \"new mail sound\" or any other sound from notification center?\nThank you.\n\nA: I have a Macbook Air but I'm going to assume it's the same in Apple's laptops.\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, though unplugging a MacBook overnight won't drain much of the battery. It shouldn't overcharge/damage the Apple adapter will make sure of that.\n\n*Yes, you can store it vertically when you have it closed. It's okay to rotate any laptop with an SSD in it as long as you keep it away from being bumped or falling over, or really strong magnets. Bumps and falls may not damage your SSD, but it could affect your laptop's functionality.\n\n*It is totally idle, operations will resume once you open your MacBook and re-login (if needed). Though you may see some notifications when you open your MacBook, I assume these are notifications before your MacBook entirely goes to sleep. So don't worry about it making any notification sound when it's closed, I keep mine that way and haven't noticed any notification sound. The notifications are from sent to the Notification Center when you Login, the app that send them check the time, and if they would have sent them during the PC was asleep then they do what they were intent to do e.g Calendar etc. The PC does run maintenance script though they make no sound at all, also it can back up to Time Machine, if you have that on. There are few more things that can run, if you have Power Nap enabled (Energy Save Pref Pane).\n", "Q: ATV3 Youtube Quality I have a 3rd generation   Apple TV that I'm trying to watch some YouTube tutorials on but the streaming quality is really low.\nHow do I select a higher definition? I can't seem to find an option or setting for it.\nThe clip I'm watching right now actually started at around 720p~1080p for the first ten seconds or so before reverting back to a blurry mess. It's obviously auto adjusting to the available bandwidth, just like it does in an ordinary browser, on an ordinary computer.\nI don't mind if I have to wait for videos to load. I don't mind if it's not a Full HD cinematic experience. I just need it to be watchable. Surely there's something I have overlooked.\n\nA: You should change the default TV resolution of your Apple TV.\nSettings --> Audio&Video --> TV Resolution and choose the resolution you want. \n\nA: I would first look at the network connection and the Internet connection.  If neither of those are the issue, or (as with me) neither of those can be changed, the best I can suggest is to quickly pause the video near the beginning and wait a while, in hopes that your Apple TV will build a sufficient buffer at the desired resolution.  If the resolution downgrades before you can pause it, back out and try again.  I can't guarantee it'll work, but since there are no settings that would allow you to force a specific resolution with YouTube, that's the best I can suggest.\nSorry, enzo, but that doesn't seem to be the issue.  He does seem to have the resolution set, otherwise he wouldn't get 10 seconds in the resolution he wanted and then a blurry mess afterward.  Unfortunately I have a similar problem that happens intermittently, and I suspect the problem is with my network connection between the Apple TV and my router (which, due to certain constraints, are not in the same room and so I have to use a wireless connection).  It may also be that the Internet connection is too slow to allow for the resolution he wanted.\n", "Q: How can I switch back my start up volume from an external to the internal drive?

A line with set keymap vi-command means that mappings below that line apply to command mode; a line with set keymap vi-insert means that mappings below that line apply to insert mode. For more details see: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Use_vi_shortcuts_in_terminal\nBut starting from bash version 4.3 you can change your prompt to highlight which mode you are currently in by putting set show-mode-in-prompt on in your ~/.inputrc file. This with put either (ins) or (cmd) at the start of your prompt. You can further customize it by using command:\nset vi-cmd-mode-string \"\\1\\e[1;31m\\2(cmd)\\1\\e[0m\\2\" -- will give light red color\nset vi-ins-mode-string \"\\1\\e[1;35m\\2(ins)\\1\\e[0m\\2\" -- will give light purple color\nYou can pick any of the following color by their ANSI codes:\n\nBlack            \\e[0;30m\nBlue             \\e[0;34m\nGreen            \\e[0;32m\nCyan             \\e[0;36m\nRed              \\e[0;31m\nPurple           \\e[0;35m\nBrown            \\e[0;33m\nGray             \\e[0;37m\nDark Gray        \\e[1;30m\nLight Blue       \\e[1;34m\nLight Green      \\e[1;32m\nLight Cyan       \\e[1;36m\nLight Red        \\e[1;31m\nLight Purple     \\e[1;35m\nYellow           \\e[1;33m\nWhite            \\e[1;37m\n\n\nA: Readline Init File, ~/.inputrc\nDepending on the command(s) you run to get your console in the desired mode, just add that line in ~/.inputrc. This should be sufficient.\nIf ~/.inputrc does not exist, you can create it without worries.\nA line with set keymap vi-command sets your Terminal to' command mode'; a line with set keymap vi-insert your Terminal to 'insert mode'. \n", "Q: internet connection sharing assigned IP Setting the internet connection sharing is straighforward from the OSX preferences.

As some of my friends have the same problem, it looks like it is mobile network operator issue (Altel 4G, Kazakhstan).\nWhy does iPhone prefer to use cell network-based or wifi-based location services while GPS is doing good? How can I turn off cell network-based and wifi-based location services, so it uses only GPS services and doesn't work at all if GPS is not available.\nNow, I have to turn my celullar data off in order to get my precise location and turn it on later. However, it makes playing some games involving both location services and celullar data impossible.\n\nA: The iPhone's systems are optimized for battery life. From the chip design to the OS, battery conservation takes precedence over all.\nGPS chips are massive power consumers. Read these answers for more information on GPS chip power use. Due to this, the iPhone will always prefer to find its location with wifi/cell tower triangulation, then refine with GPS.  The phone will often quickly cycle the GPS chip on and off, confirming location as needed. (remember, computers think in microseconds or smaller)\nSince the iPhone is not a dedictaed GPS, you likely will never find a way to force it to become one. You might try an iPhone GPS application, many of which seem to 'force' the GPS chip (and drain the battery).\nFor more, learn about Assisted GPS, which explains how GPS works on your phone, including iPhone. This may also explain why your carrier might be a challenge, as it might not be providing you with Mobile Station Assisted data.\n\nA: Smartphones use mobile/WiFi networks first to locate you because they are nearest you and this won't drain much of your phone's battery, whereas GPS uses satellites requiring more power from your phone looking for a minimum of 3 satellites to completely work.\n\nA: On iOS, it seems you can't disable cellular. \nBut I think it is not important. After get new location, you check accuracy, if accuracy > 100, discard it and wait to get next location.\n\nA: You can use Google Maps in offline mode for the GPS part of the question but you won't get the live traffic updates.  You can navigate on any part of the map that you've previously downloaded to your iPhone and it will track your location using the GPS chip.\nThe traffic updates come over the cellular connection, not the GPS, so if you turn that off you're not going to get the live updates, detours, arrival time, etc.\n\nA: If you want better location accuracy, you might want to try some MFI certified GPS. I have BadElf Pro as dedicated GPS tracker and it claims to overtake iPhone location service data stream when active. That might solve your problem with accuracy and lower power consumption. BadElf is not cheap.

I've mainly used the former as I've always felt it a bit more straight-forward when you just want to set up some minor extra functionality, but it hasn't been updated in a very long time and it feels like it gets buggier and buggier with each new OS X release.\nBTT is definitely the way to go at this point, it has seen continued development and is really user friendly these days, and it's just incredibly powerful, once you've fiddled with it a bit and started to build up muscle memory you can get the Magic Mouse to do everything the trackpad does and much more.\nIn BetterTouchTool, select your mouse, and in the dropdown for predefined actions, choose \"Lookup Word Under Cursor\".\n\nA: I want to preview a web link by click the middle button of a mouse, I followed the answer by tolgraven and installed BetterTouchTool by brew install bettertouchtool in Terminal.\nIt can help me preview Safari link when I hover on a link and click middle mouse button on it.\nBelow are the settings for BetterTouchTool:\n\n", "Q: Getting my MacBook Air (2011) into Windows faster Is there a way to reduce the time spent in EFI?\nIt seems more than 15 seconds that the Mac (Macbook air 2011) stays with the screen grey before beginning to boot (or resume from hibernate) to Windows. \nBooting into MacOS is faster and getting to the grey apple symbol is very fast.\nThis video shows it: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HITe9-VOrDI\nI need to add that I currently run Windows 10, but did boot camp assistant with Win7 because no native support of boot camp for my hardware and no Win8 product key.\nWithin Win10 it shows me: BIOS Mode Legacy and SMBIOS Version 2.4\n(please give me a hint if you think this subject is better placed on a Windows part of Stackexchange.)\n\nA: I have a 20-inch mid 2007 iMac running OS X 10.10.5 and Windows 10 Pro 64 bit. Both were cleanly installed. This means before installing there was no previous version of ether operating system and the partitions were reformatted. Now, I would expect my boot times to be longer than yours. The strange thing is both operating systems take the same amount of time to boot. The time is about 64 seconds. Both operating systems are set to auto boot directly into my account.\nIf your Windows 10 is activated, then you can preform a clean install of Windows 10 using the latest Boot Camp drivers available for your Mac. Once connected to the internet, the new install will activate. You do not need a product key.\nIt is my understanding that Windows 10 skips certain steps during boot that previous operating system preformed. This allows for a faster boot time. You can still instruct Windows 10 to preform these skipped steps at the cost of speed.

How is this with the iPhone?\nCan anyone (for example friends on gamecenter) see what apps/games I've installed?\n\nA: Your friends can see the games that have access to your Game Center account (this works accross multiple devices since you can have a single Game Center account for multiple devices).\nThe access to the game center needs an explicit autorisation. Most of the time on the first start of the game it will prompt you if you want grant access to the game center (or not). \n", "Q: npm commain in Automator \nHi,\nI would like to write an automator workflow which allows me to install node packages.\nI tried with \n$ npm insall \nbut doesn't work any idea how I could solve this?\n\n\nA: That's because when you run shell command from Automator, it's PATH variable does have all the paths as when you run from Terminal. Use full path to npm executable. You can find the full path with which npm in the Terminal.\n", "Q: Is there a way to safely eject a USB hard drive from the lock screen? Often I come to my mac sitting on my desk in the morning and need to simply unplug it and put it in a bag. While maybe not strictly necessary to properly eject the attached USB drive, it sure would be nice if there were a way to do so without first logging in.\n\nA: AFAIK there is no save way to eject an external drive from the lock screen.\nYou have several options though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase and install Mountain and enable \"Unmount external volumes on sleep\". The feature still seems to be experimental.\n\n*Create a LaunchDaemon which ejects your external drive(s) gracefully at say 5am. Here is an example of a bash script to start with:\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/sbin/diskutil list | grep -e 'disk[1-9]s.*' | sed 's/.*\\(disk[0-9].*\\)/\\1/' | xargs -I{}\n/usr/sbin/diskutil unmount {}\n\nIf you don't want to write a LaunchDaemon, Sleepwatcher should support your efforts.\n\n*Unmount all external volumes before setting your Mac(s) to sleep.\n", "Q: servermgrd certificate in Yosemite server chain of trust I am setting up a file server in Yosemite and am trying to remove vulnerabilities so my organization's IT dept will approve. I acquired a trusted SSL certificate and installed it with all of the intermediates to complete the chain of trust.  \nThe IT dept's vulnerability scan showed that port 311 was using a self-signed certificate.  I then used keychain to switch the servermgrd identity to use the correct certificate as explained in How do I get com.apple.servermgrd to use a non-self-signed SSL certificate?.  \nNow the vulnerability scan no longer shows the self-signed certificate being used for port 311 - good - but it still reports the certificate as being untrusted. The trust chain is intact for server domain, but not the servermgrd.  Also, the servermgrd certificate in keychain still shows the wrong private key, even though the servermgrd identity is using the correct cert. \nAnyone know how to address this?  Could this require different intermediate certs than the server itself? Should the servermgrd certificate that is using the wrong private key be replaced?\n\nA: servermgrd looks up the certificate it uses for port 311 via an identity preference named \"com.apple.servermgrd\". By default, the preference points to the self-signed \"com.apple.servermgrd\" identity cert. After you change the preference you can remove the old self-signed cert without causing any harm. But you must make sure that the access control list (ACL) on the private key of the certificate that you want servermgrd to use allows servermgrd access. \nIf servermgrd cannot access the private key, it will delete the preference and create a new self-signed identity and set a new preference to point to the newly created identity cert.\n", "Q: New (clean) install of iOS 9 while retaining Health/Activity and Apple Watch data I'm planning on doing a new clean install of iOS 9 on my iPhone because I really like to have a clean slate when changing iPhones and upgrading iOS. However, the fact that Health, Activity, and Apple Watch data isn't synced to the cloud has made this difficult this year.\nIs it possible to do a clean install of iOS 9 on my iPhone and also retain Health, Activity, and Apple Watch data? Or is it only possible to upgrade / restore from backup to keep that data?\n\nA: No, you cannot only restore Health data from a backup. Only encrypted iTunes backups and iCloud backups store Health.app data.\n\nA: The only workaround I can think of is disabling all other apps in iCloud, because iCloud doesn't allow selective restore but allows selective backup.\nYou need to go to your iPhone's settings, then to iCloud and disable everything in that list except for the health app. Now we know that iCloud will only save the health app data.\nBefore doing a restore through iTunes you need to check the encryption for your backups in iTunes before and after installation : https://support.apple.com/HT203037 \n\nA: Unless you are Backup to a pc with encrypted option on iTunes Health data is not going anywhere but stays in your device hardware. So if you want to transfer or don't want to lose your health data first do a backup this way.

I tried to use Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows on my MacBook Air. Long story short, due to installation issues, I wiped my MacBook Air drive.\nI couldn't get my Mac to recognise a bootable disc of Yosemite made using this guide. After some more fidling I managed to install Windows 7 on my Mac but now I need to find a way to install OS X.\n\nA: *\n\n*Turn your Mac off.\n\n*Turn it on, but hold down the Option key until you see images of two hard drives on screen.\n\n*Use the arrow keys to select \"Recovery\", press enter when you have selected it.\n\n\nIf you wish to erase Windows and your Windows data, if not, skip to step 9:\n\n\n*Click Disk Utility.\n\n*Click the partition under whatever your internal SSD is called, typically the brand name followed by some seemingly meaningless characters.\n\n*Select Erase in the toolbar\n\n*Confirm you wish to erase the drive\n\n*Upon completion of the wipe of your drive, close the window.\n\n*Select Install OS X and follow the on-screen instructions.\n", "Q: Long In Review Time I've submitted an app to iTunes Connect via Xcode and I got an email from iTunes Connect which informs me about \"Waiting For Review\" situation at 4th of September. After waiting in the queue, on 9th of September, I got another email which notifies me that my app's status changed to In Review. Unfortunately, six calendar days later, my app's status is still \"In Review\". Therefore, I submitted a contact us form of iTunes Connect. They've sent a reply to me that my app is in still review, they'll inform me... etc. Up to now, I don't have any requests from Apple, emails about my app. Is it normal or not and what do I need to do?(My app contains Non-Consumable in-App purchase)\n\nA: A month for a tricky review is possible. I've seen much longer. \nAdd the iOS 9 release crunch and you could be waiting 6 or more weeks. The only reason I would call would be if I was willing to cut content and remove a potentially troubling aspect of the app to smooth review. \nEven then, it really depends upon context. Whether the app is under first review or this is a patch update. IAP can delay things but it really depends on how your app was built. \n\nA: I'd give Apple a call and ask them what gives. They may not be of any help, but at least you could bring your issue to their attention.\n", "Q: How do I alt+f4 in OS X? I want to close focused window I am looking for a way to close the currently focused window using a keyboard shortcut. Effectively I want to do the same thing as the red \"X\" button in the top left corner, only using a keyboard. On windows/linux this is done by alt+f4\nI know about:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘ Cmd+w - in any tabbed application such as google chrome it will close the current tab instead of current window\n\n*⌘ Cmd+q - will close the entire app instead of just the current window\n\n\nA: Shift+⌘ Cmd+w does what you want in Safari and Chrome. I don't think it's a system-wide standard, though.\nIt works in Finder too so maybe it is a standard.\nhttps://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?hl=en\n\nA: BetterTouchTool (http://www.bettertouchtool.net) lets you assign many actions to trackpad and magic mouse gestures / mouse buttons / keyboard shortcuts. The \"Close Window below cursor\" action might be close to what you want\n\nA: I believe that ⌘ Cmd+w IS what you are looking for.   It doesn't just work for tabbed applications, such as browsers.   I tested it in Finder this morning, the OS X Mail App, as well as Microsoft Word and Excel.   All of those support using the ⌘ Cmd+w combination to close the current window.   \n\nA: The command to close the current focused window is Opt+Cmd+W.\n", "Q: Use external hard drive to install applications to it I have a 120 GB SSD on my Mac and it is almost 90% full. I have another 500 GB external hard drive and I want to install some big applications to that hard drive so it does not occupy space of SSD.  \nI tried to move apps directly from Application to the external drive but I think some files remain on the SSD. \n\nA: You can use an external HDD to install and run applications there. Make sure they support USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt. I use Mathematica on mine and it works fine. The preferences files will remain on your internal disk but they are very small.\n\nA: What kind of Mac is this?  I installed an SSD + spinning HD in my macbook pro by removing the optical drive. Then I combined them into a fusion drive as described here. This offers a nice combination of speed + capacity.  Note: you would need to backup your current drive and restore to the new fusion volume if you do this.\n\nA: Apps store their data in various locations, not just within something.app in /Applications. For example /Library/Preferences and ~/Library/Preferences.  To completely move everything that has to do with an arbitrary app, I'd do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Global search by the name of the app on source drive.  I use Find Any File.\n\n*For Move each resource that comes up in the search to the destination drive\n\n*Create symbolic links from the source location to the destination using the ln command.\n\n", "Q: Secure Login Equivalent on OS X On Windows you can configure \"Secure Login\" so that you have to press Control + Alt + Delect to show the login screen like so:\n\nDoes this feature exist on OS X or is there a third-party application that can achive this?\n\nA: Short answer: No.  This feature does not exist on Macs.\nOn a side note, it's also useless in Windows too.\nA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, CTRL+ALT+DEL sent a hardware interrupt to the PC's BIOS (which would immediately reboot the computer in the DOS days).\nThat interrupt also had the happy side-effect of breaking things like keyloggers and programs designed to steal your password, so when Windows NT arrived on the scene, Microsoft trapped that interrupt to prove that you were a real, live human sitting in front of a keyboard.\nThat has not been the case for many, many years.  I have no idea why we're still dragging this stupid three-finger salute around after all these years (tradition maybe?)  It offers no meaningful security these days and I personally disable it with Group Policy on every domain I administer.\n", "Q: Can 2013 MacBook Air output to 2560x1080? I recently purchased a 21:9 LG monitor (model 29UM57) and I'm having difficulty getting my 2013 MBA to output to 2560x1080, which is the monitor's resolution. My max resolution is 1080p.\nI purchased this MDP-HDMI adapter, Cable Matters® Gold Plated Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt™ Port Compatible) to HDMI Male to Female Adapter - 4K Resolution Ready, hoping that it would help my situation, but my max resolution has not changed.\nI'm wondering whether ordering this HDMI cable, AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable - 6.5 Feet (2 Meters) Supports Ethernet, 3D, 4K and Audio Return, will fix my problem. I don't know what version or whatever my current HDMI cable is.\nPlease advise.\n\nA: I believe the problem is your HDMI cable - it's not capable of displaying a resolution of 2560x1080.  In other words, it's pre-HDMI 1.4 specification.  (Also, the link provided to the cable in the original question is out of date; it's no longer available).\nPer Apple Support, the 2013 MacBook Air (11\" and 13\" model) has a Thunderbolt port which also supports mini Display Port.\n\nSince the HDMI cable referenced in the original question is 4K capable (HDMI v1.4 specification), the cable is not the issue.  What wasn't mentioned was the HDMI adapter. I believe this component to be the \"weak link\" in this chain because if the mDP to HDMI adapter isn't 4K capable, nothing else will matter.\nI recommend getting an active mDP to HDMI adapter (rather than passive) and then connecting your HDMI (v1.4 or above) cable from the adapter to the TV.   \n\nThat said, I would only recommend this solution for this particular setup, because the LG monitor 29UM57-P only supports HDMI connections.\nIdeally, you would want to use mDP to either mDP or DP connections rather than convert to HDMI, DVI, etc., to get the most reliable connection(s).  Less conversions means less points of potential failure.\n\nA: According to the technical specifications page for the MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013) you should be able to output at 2560x1080.\nYou might want to consider using one of the two mDP-HDMI adapters that Apple sells on their online store: in the US, at least, those are the Belkin 4K and Moshi.\n\nA: Per top rated answer, try this active adapter\ncomment on Amazon\n\nIf you have a Macbook Air from 2013 (possibly other models) and want to use an LG UltraWide monitor that is 2560x1080 @60hz, then this cable WILL NOT work for you. However, the following cable - \"Cable Matters Active Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter (Active Mini DP to HDMI) Supporting Eyefinity Technology & 4K Resolution\" - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PJ3LSIG/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 - works perfectly for the job. Hopefully this will save somebody some time!\nI'm sure this particular cable is fine for the right job - I just had to rate it something, even though it wasn't right for my case.\n\nI ordered the active adapter and it worked for my LG Ultrawide: go to display settings on macbook air first, select best for LG Ultrawide then plug in cable with active adapter, then in display settings select the 2560x1080 resolution.\n\nA: People should only provide proven solutions instead of theories, theories are useless and frustrating, just shut if if you don't really know...\nHere's what I learned after wasting tons of hours: the most similar version to your monitor by Apple was the 30\" Cinema Display (because of the res.), if you go to the Apple  page you will find out that you need a Dual-Link adapter to reach that resolution and this is because, since it's made for 2 monitors (Dual), it doubles the bandwidth. I didn't tried the Dual-link adapter, but following the same direction, I had a MST hub (with I could never dual-monitor my MBP with and the reason I take the ultrawide way...) so I currrently use only one of the two outs, and it worked absolutely perfect.\nYou're welcome.\n", "Q: Separate download of Photos App for Yosemite I accidentally deleted the Yosemite's Photos App from my Applications folder but I can't seem to find a separate download link anywhere.\nIt can't possibly be that I have to re-install Yosemite just to get the app, can it?\n\nA: If you use Time Machine, just restore the app (and its data, if applicable) from an older backup. If not, reinstalling OS X is probably the best idea, as Photos is not available on the Mac App Store and I definitely wouldn't try to download it elsewhere (so don't just type \"Mac Photos.app installer\" in Bing or Yahoo or Dutch and download whatever comes up). You could copy the app over from a friend or family member, though, if you wish.\n", "Q: Can I share the Wi-Fi connection of my Mac to the internet with my iPad? My Mac is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi.\nCan I use this connection for my iPad? I guess creating a local network is not possible, since I already use the wifi of the mac. So, is it possible by connecting the iPad with the USB cable?\n\nA: To share your Mac internet connection with your iPad do the following (Source with some screenshots)\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, go to Apple > System Preferences > Bluetooth > Turn Bluetooth On.\n\n*Turn Bluetooth On on your iPad.\n\n*Your iPad should show up as a new device in the Bluetooth preferences of your Mac.

However, my password is very easy to figure out.\nSince the location services automatically turns on, will it stay on (unless he/she turns it off) even if he/she unlocks it?\n\nA: Based on this article from Apple:\n\nTurn off Lost Mode or change your contact info\nYou can turn off Lost Mode by entering the passcode on the device, or by following the steps below. You can also follow the steps below to change the contact information displayed on your lost device.\nNote:   If your credit and debit cards for Apple Pay were suspended\n  because you put your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus in Lost Mode, when you\n  turn off Lost Mode and sign back in to iCloud, you can resume using\n  your cards.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Go to Find My iPhone on iCloud.com.\n  \n  \n  If you don’t see Find My iPhone on iCloud.com, your account just has\n  access to iCloud web-only features. To gain access to other iCloud\n  features, set up iCloud on your iOS device or Mac.\n\n  \n*Click All Devices, then select the device that’s in Lost Mode.\n  \n*Click Lost Mode, then change the information or click Stop Lost Mode.\n\nSo if the person who picked up your phone is able to unlock your phone (using the correct passcode), they can disable Lost Mode.

I have an old iMac laying around and I thought I would set her up with it. The only thing is, she lives in such a rural place that the only Internet connection available is dial-up.\nHow can I connect this iMac to the Internet using dial-up? I know there's an option in System Preferences -> Network for the internal modem but do I need an RJ-11 to USB converter or can I just plug the RJ-11 into the RJ-45 port?\n\nA: The short answer is no, you cannot plug the RJ-11 into the Ethernet port and have it work for a Dial-Up Connection.\nThere were five 2009 iMac models...\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (20-inch, Early 2009)    \n\n*iMac (24-inch, Early 2009)    \n\n*iMac (20-inch, Mid 2009)  \n\n*iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2009)   \n\n*iMac (27-inch, Late 2009)\n\n\nNone of which had a built-in modem although the first two were offered with an optional Apple USB Modem (MA034Z/A).\nIf you do not have the Apple USB Modem (MA034Z/A) or a third-party USB Modem that will work on a Mac with the version of OS X and the Dial-Up Service Provider then your iMac will be of little use in this situation.\n", "Q: Time Machine restore to new partition, different computer I split my macpro disk into 2 partitions. I wish to continue to use partition 1 as a 10.6.8 (Mountain Lion) system. I wish restore everything (O/S, data, etc.) from a Time Machine backup, from a MacBook Pro laptop running Mavericks to my second partition on the MacPro.  So I want to end up with a machine that can run either Mountain Lion or Mavericks.\nWhen I rebooted into 10.6.8, I saw the second partition \"folder\" on the desktop. Now the 2nd partition does not yet have an O/S, but the last thing I expected was to see it on the Mountain Lion desktop!\nWhat is happening here? Why am I seeing the second partition as if it were a part of 10.6.8?  Did I fail to partition the drive correctly?\nTo partition my drive, I booted from the reinstall disk, got into utilities, did not select the route that would erase everything and reinstall the O/S, but selected the route that would preserve the data on the drive and split the single partition into 2 equally sized partitions.\n\nA: By default, the Mac will always mount all non-hidden partitions - so both partitions will automatically mount to both OSes, whichever you boot from, even when each contains a different OS.\nYou can set each to not mount when the other OS is 'in charge' by tweaking a file known as fstab in each OS separately; but we'll come to that later...\nFirst thing to ensure is that your two partitions have different, recognisable names - it will save a lot of trouble later.\nThen you need to get Mavericks onto the new partition.\nOn first boot after installation it will ask if you wish to Migrate from another machine. That's your time to feed it the Time Machine backup of your MacBook Pro.\nBy the time it's finished, your Mavericks partition will be a usable 'copy' of your Macbook.\nTo determine which it will boot into at any given time, you can set that in System Prefs > Startup Disk. That will set the default OS that it will boot into.\nTo boot into the other on just a single occasion, hold  Alt ⌥  at the startup chimes & choose it from the drive icons that will appear [You may also see Recovery at that point too]\nOnce you are sure that each will boot when requested, then you can set your fstab file to not mount the other drive in each case.\nChanging the fstab file to hide a partition is just a 'simple task' of adding one line of text to a text file; one on each boot partition. This 'simple task' is unfortunately complicated by a couple of factors...\nFirstly, because you don't 'own' the file the system will try to stop you from writing to it.\nTo get around this, we drag the file to the desktop & work on the copy that is made there.\nIt's also in a hidden location, so it's not easy to get to, so we need to start by making it visible…\nLate Edit: Since perhaps High Sierra, you can enable hidden file visibility simply by key command from Finder -  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   .  (stop/period), thus avoiding all the defaults write below\nIf you need to use fstab frequently, add yourself to the ACL, which saves having to work on a copy each time\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal [Applications/Utilities]\n\n\n*Type\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\n& hit Enter [You can copy/paste]\nRight click the Finder icon in the Dock & select Relaunch.

If it doesn't we can make a new one.\nDrag fstab to the desktop, it will make a copy. If no fstab file exists, you can just make a new file from Terminal by typing\ntouch ~/desktop/fstab\n& one will appear on the desktop.\n\n\n*In Terminal - Type\ndiskutil info *partition name of other partition*\n& hit Enter\nWe are looking for the UUID of the other partition here - the one you want to hide when you are booted into this one, so for instance from Mountain Lion you're looking for\ndiskutil info Mavericks HD\n\n\n*Find the line that says Volume UUID & copy the long number that looks like this 20F8C09F-9609-39BD-9C47-D82DCC98ECDE [Ignore the one underneath it that looks similar]\n\n\n*Open your desktop copy of fstab in TextEdit\n\n\n*Add a new line to the fstab file like this, but using your copied UUID -\nUUID=C126C736-1585-3D12-9CF1-F95EFF0CF744 none hfs rw,noauto\nIgnore any existing lines that may be present, just add your new one underneath.\nSave.\n\n\n*Fix the ownership on the new version of fstab by typing\nsudo chown root:wheel ~/desktop/fstab\nTerminal will ask for your password before proceeding.\n\n\n*Delete the existing fstab file from etc/ & then drag the new one into place. Password will be required.\n\n\n*Repeat that process on the other partition, first by finding its own fstab file, then adding to it the UUID of your current boot partition - so each boot drive will hide the other one.\n\n\n*Once completed & satisfied that it actually works, hide the 'invisible' files again -\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO\nthen relaunch the Finder once more.\nIf you ever need to see the other partition later, you can always mount it manually from Disk Utility.\n\nA: I was part way into the project when I started this thread, but this is a full list of steps. \nSteps to partition your Apple MacPro drive: \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the reinstall disk.\n\n*Get into utilities.\n\n*Be careful here - do not select the route that would erase everything and reinstall the O/S, but instead, select the route that would preserve the data on the drive and split the single partition into two partitions.\n\n*Make sure you name the new partition with a different name than your original partition. (Comes up as a new disk.)\n\n*If the new O/S is the current offering from Apple, get online and download the installer.  Install onto your new partition. (This was not the case for me, so I have no idea how to instruct you in this.) Continue with step 8. \n\n*If the new O/S is not the current Apple offering, get yourself an appointment at your local Apple Store's Genius Bar. \n\n*Have them add the installer to your new partition.\n\n*Set the boot drive to your new partition. (If you executed steps 6 & 7, have the Genius Bar tech set your boot drive for you. If your last step was step 5, get into System Preferences, Startup Disk and set it yourself and then power down your Mac.) \n\n*Once back at home, with the machine off, attach the Time Machine backup drive to the Mac and turn it on. Wait for it to settle (10? seconds)\n\n*Power up the Mac. \n\n*Work through the screens, selecting Time Machine as the source drive. I believe this comes up as an icon only - looks something like, \n\n*Note: Since you set the startup disk, you won't be asked for a destination drive - it assumes your destination -is- the startup disk.\n\n\nWe only had O/S and Applications on our backup (no data), so the restore to the new drive took a mere 35 minutes. The tech at the Apple Store said more typical times to restore would be on the order of a couple of hours. \nA huge thank you goes out to Tetsujin who was instrumental in helping me understand my remaining steps. \n", "Q: How to install a arbitrary version of iOS on iPhone? I have to develop an app for a specific version of iOS (I am just a freelancer, doing what I am told).\nHow I install iOS 8.2, or below (8.1, 7.x are fine too) on an iPhone 4S?\n\nA: There's no official way of installing an older iOS on a device that Apple has stopped signing the SHSH keys for.\nYour best bet is either to get a hold of a device that still has an older iOS or just using a simulator when developing the app.\n\nA: Short answer, you don't. \nApple will only sign the current OS, or in the case of a device incapable of running the current OS, the latest it supports.\nThere are no models that support iOS 8 that don't also support up to 8.4.1 [& even the coming iOS 9]\n", "Q: Spotlight preferences ignored I have set Spotlight preferences to show System Preferences first, and not show Webpages:\n\nand yet these seem to be ignored:\n\nSpecifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*the \"top hit\" is never a System Preference.

My first goal was to see if they could upgrade to Yosemite, so I tried it on one.\nNow, it boots to a white/grey screen with a mouse cursor which follows my mouse movements.\nI've tried all of the standard suggestions: reset SMC, reset PRAM, use recovery mode to repair disk and permissions. Nothing fixes this nor changes this white-screen-with-mouse-cursor behavior.\nBooting into recovery mode works as on normal machines.\nBooting in safe-mode gives the white-screen-with-mouse-cursor.\nAlthough the first upgrade I tried was just from within the booted Mavericks OS, I also tried installing/upgrading again from Yosemite on a USB stick and it brought me to this same state of white-screen-with-mouse-cursor.\nI then added a 2nd partition on the drive and installed a fresh Yosemite, and that worked. So, a stock Yosemite works. So I don't think there's anything wrong with the hardware.\nBecause I have a working, parallel MacOS, from which I can fiddle with the volume with the problems, I'm interested in removing/disabling low-level, non-stock additions to the OS: kexts, plists... all the stuff down in /System and /Library which gets loaded at boot time before the login screen is shown. Then, I can disable some add-ons, try booting the original volume, disable some other stuff, try booting again, etc.. But, I don't know a good, systematic way to go about this. Question: Where on the problem volume should I be looking for user-added mods/drivers/kexts/plists and how can I easily spot them among the original Yosemite stuff?\n\nA: Try running EtreCheck. It will provide a lot of useful information on the configuration of your Macs (including a list of the kernel extensions, launch agents, launch daemons, etc).\nIf you need more guidance you can copy and paste the output from EtreCheck into a  Gist, add a link to the Gist to your question above and I'll update my answer.\n", "Q: OSX System Logs: What would a port scan look like?

I recently jailbroke it and then restored it back using iTunes. Since then, iCloud Backup is not completing even after me doing it manually over and over again.\nAlso, AppStore is too slow, the app download or update doesn't even start. Upon waiting for few hours, it completes about 5%\nWhat could this be?\n\nA: I updated to iOS 9 last night and iCloud Backup works fine now\nand for the AppStore issue, I disabled the Two-Step Verification while still on iOS 8.4.1 and it worked\n", "Q: How do I escape a bad VPN sign on request I get stuck and have to wait until the request times out when I enter a bad VPN request. I would like to cancel the request and enter a different VPN address. I tried control break like on Windows but it doesn't work. \nI am using Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client version 3.1.05170.\nI use the company's default. Depending on how I am connected the VPN client doesn't recognise the .com address and I need to go to terminal mode and \"ping\" the site to get the IP address. Then cut and paste that to the VPN address bar. \nDoes anyone have better ideas? \n\nA: You could try with the native option in your mac to use a different way to connect to your VPN, try this:\nGo to System reference > Network > add a new connection (the plus sign on the down left corner) on interface select \"VPN\" on vpn type select \"Cisco VPN\" change the name (if you like), Add your company's values and try it to connect, I used this option and my VPN works like a charm.\n", "Q: How to move videos from iPhone to Windows PC by cable? How to move videos from iPhone?\nI took long video and filled my memory. Now I wish to move it from iPhone.\nIf I connect it to general Windows computer, it appears as a device in My Computer. Inside it, I see Internal Storage folder and then DCIM folder.\nUnfortunately, I don't see videos there. Probably they appear as some unnamed unindentified icons (see one above IMG_2633.JPG):\n\nI can't drag and drop such icons.\nAdditionally, I can drag drop photos, but if I select to 'Move` them, they are still copied, i.e. not deleted from iPhone. If I would able to move video, it probably won't deleted too, while I need to MOVE video from iPhone.\nHow to accomplish?\nUPDATE\nHere is the video in app. How to know it's name and path?\n\n\nA: Movies should come up in the same folder. If you cannot see the video then there are a few things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Was the video taken with a different app, and not the native camera app? If so, that data could be accessible through app data in iTunes\n\n*Are there other folders inside the DCIM folder? After you take several photos and videos, they get spread into multiple folders.\n\n*If you enable photo syncing in iTunes can you then see the files you want, even if this is just a temporary measure to test it's there?\n\n\nThe \"device\" type icon you see can be ignored. You won't be able to copy or delete it, and usually after you disconnect and reconnect your phone they will disappear, particularly if you've deleted the rest of the photos.\nCutting/pasting doesn't always seem to delete them on the device, but if you are sure you've backed up all the photos you can just highlight them and delete them all.\n\nA: I don't know what iOS version you're using. I tested on iOS 12 and Win7 with iTunes installed. Just plug the iPhone with a normal USB type-a to lightning cable, then type the password to trust the computer on my phone.\nThe iPhone appears as a portable device in My Computer and  a similar path Internal Storage - DCIM - 100APPLE I can find the videos. Simply right click then cut and paste can complete the move operation. Drag can't do it, it's considered copy and paste.\n\n\nA: It might be other way to do it, but I would upload it to dropbox from the iPhone (with Dropbox.app) and then delete it from iPhone once checked it uploaded properly.\n", "Q: How to share iPad's wifi to Mac? I want to connect my MacBook Pro to my iPad mini's Wi-fi. I don't see any hotspot settings. I have searched on the web but all I see is to go to cellular option in setting which is not available in my iPad (cause there is no SIM).\nCan this be achieved through Bluetooth sharing, a personal hotspot, USB tethering or any other means?\n\nA: If the iPad mini and the MacBook Pro is on the same WiFi, they also have the same IP-adr. range, so they can see each other.\nThe Personal Hotspot option is for sharing an internet connection, and here you have the cellular network (SIM-card) as the external connector, and the WiFi (Personal Hotspot) as the DHCP Server.\n\nA: The Personal Hotspot option is only available to devices that use a SIM card with cellular data. A device connected to a wi-fi cannot share that connection to another device, you have no other choice but to get that other device within the range of the same wi-fi router.\n", "Q: How to change the language of the date (day of week) in Yosemite's lock screen? When my iMac enters the lock screen, my default language for the buttons is German; but the language of the day of week displayed in the upper right corner is English.

I'm soon going to be starting iOS development, but I want to see whether I ought to get a new Mac or not. I currently have:\n\nMacBook Air (13-inch, Late 2010)\n2.13 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM\nRunning OS X Yosemite\n\nI have read that this MacBook will support El Capitan, which the newest Xcode will require, but I've no idea if it will run it well. In your guys experience, would it run the latest Xcode alright, or is it a bit of a memory hog? It will be something I want to last at least a few more years, so wondering whether I'll need to make that investment now or will it hold off? I appreciate the 13-inch size is going to be rather small, and I'll be hooking it up to an external monitor, so this is purely down to the capabilities of the system. I have a feeling it will work, but was hoping for someone's experience in the matter to suggest whether (for a newbie iOS develop) it would be really scraping the barrel in performance or if it should suffice. Sorry for the amount of ambiguity and personal preference this question might include!\n\nA: This question is primarily opinion-based, but in my experience, your MacBook Air should be good enough for you to use to begin iOS programming. I currently use a 15-inch Mid-2009 MacBook Pro (2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4 GB RAM, 256 GB Intel 530 Series SSD) for my iOS app development and it's alright. Would I like a newer MacBook? Of course. But, it's not like I'm making a complex 3D-platformer using Metal or something, I'm just developing a simple 2D game. Apple does a good job of supporting older hardware, so it may be a few years before I get a new Mac. In short, yes, you should be able to use your MacBook Air for learning how to do iOS app development, just don't expect to have an easy time developing complex 3D games on it. The fact that this machine is lean on RAM is compensated for by it having an SSD. This will greatly help with the memory intensity of running a dev env including a simulator.\n", "Q: How to display Lyrics for the song in Apple Music on iOS?

A while ago, using OS X Mavericks, I installed an OS X utility named Proxinator, which was supposed to allow me to lock and unlock my Mac by proximity sensing my iPhone using bluetooth and a companion iPhone app. It didn't work well, but I left it installed.\nRecently, and after installing Yosemite, there came a security update which prevented me from logging in. The symptoms were basically the same as described in this question, (black screen, flashing cursor instead of login dialog). The error logs pointed to /Library/Security/SecurityAgentPlugins/proxinator.bundle. Removing it didn't help, and I was eventually forced to restore a backup that took me back to Mavericks.\nThen I tried removing the bundle from the SecurityAgentPlugins directory, and I got the same problem with the black screen. Restoring it fixed the problem. So something in the system configuration is evidently expecting a plugin that works, but I can't figure out what.\nHow can I get rid of a Security Agent Plugin?\n\nA: Simple answer: If you are able to log in, you can uninstall Proxinator specifically by running it, and selecting \"Reset Proxinator\" from its menu.\nComplicated answer: You have to edit the Authorization DB using security authorizationdb read and security authorizationdb write. See this StackOverflow answer.\n", "Q: iOS simulator screen size not equal to window size I have a strange issue with my iOS simulator. It does not fit my Simulator Windows size. This is not a real problem, but the thing is that I cannot make screenshots anymore, when I save a screenshot, it saves the entire simulator window, not only the iOS screen. \nHow can I fix this problem? \nThe strange thing is that was working a few hours ago, even if the iOS screen was smaller, when I saved a screenshot, it saved at full resolution.\nI will attack an image of the simulator Window. Window scale is 100%. If I change it, also the iOS inside will change too, but never goes full screen.\n\n\nA: Now It's more flexible with Xcode 9- Simulator. You can pick & drag any corner of simulator to resize it and set it according to your requirement.\nLook at this snapshot:\n\nNote: With Xcode 9.1, Simulator scale options are changed.\nThere are several other ways also, to scale your simulator.\nKeyboard short-keys:\n According to Xcode 9.1\nPhysical Size       ⌘ 1      command + 1\nPixel Accurate      ⌘ 2      command + 2\n\n According to Xcode 9\n50% Scale           ⌘ 1      command + 1\n100% Scale          ⌘ 2      command + 2\n200% Scale          ⌘ 3      command + 3\n\n\nSimulator scale options Menu:\nXcode 9.1\n\nMenubar  >>  Window  >>  \"Here available options for simulator scaling\" (Physical Size & Pixel Accurate)\n\n\nXcode 9.0\n\nMenubar  >>  Window  >>  Scale  >>  \"Here available options for simulator scaling\"\n\n\n\nUsing Terminal Command\nFollow these steps to scale simulator using terminal commands\n\n\n*\n\n*Close/Quit simulator.

This works even for simulated devices that do not fit on your Mac's screen in full scale (like the iPad Pro).  You'll still get the full window including the part that is not visible on the screen. \n\nA: Seems like you have chosen a \"resizable\" iPhone or iPad. Go to \"Hardware\" under the menu bar and select another device. You can also press ⌘ + 2 for 75% size or ⌘ + 3 for 50% size.\n", "Q: Why does WhatsApp require so much space for iCloud backup? When backing up Whatsapp History to iCloud, Whatsapp required nearly the same amount of free space as the total backup. i.e If Whatsapp need to back up 1.8 GB of data to iCloud it will need 1.8GB of free space on the iPhone.\nIs there anyway to get around that? I simply dont constantly have 1.8GB of free space.\n\nA: I would be more worried if the backup of my data takes less space than the data itself. If you want to reduce the size of the backup (and the data), start with deleting videos and pictures contained in WhatsApp conversations. \n\nA: Go to WhatsApp - Settings - Chats - Backup, and see how much space Whatsapp is trying to upload (you can choose to not include videos to reduce most of the size)\nNow, there are 2 Whatsapp backup switches to handle, they are both on by default, hence, by default, WhatsApp is an odd and inconvenient outlier since (compared to iCloud Photo library) it literally duplicates the space required if both switches are on, let me explain:\n1st switch: iPhone Settings app > Tap your name in the top > iCloud > scroll down to see the switch (this switch creates a live backup that allows for an independent backup, meaning you don't need to restore your whole iphone to restore this backup, you can delete Whatsapp Only and said backup will be detected when you reinstall Whatsapp). You get to pick your frequency\n2nd switch: iPhone Settings app > Tap your name in the top > iCloud > Manage Storage > click \"Backcup\" green icon row > Click your device > here you have a list of your TOTAL apps, each might save a tiny bit of settings info for each app (not the app itself), this is a packaged backup that also saves your downloaded app list (no matter if you switch off every app). So, Here you see WhatsApp too (2nd switch) <- if on, Whatsapp backup will take 2x space of your total iCloud space. As I understand, this backup can only be accessed if you restore the whole iPhone (whole package see). \nPost-context: for years, I've turned off the 2nd switch with no problems. But ever since iOS 13, background activity is a mess for Whatsapp, and even though I have more than enough space, auto-daily Whatsapp backup is not happening. I now have the question if I can invert the switches, and still be able to access WhatsApp backup by only deleting and reinstalling the whatsapp app, not the whole iPhone. This question arises since the packaged backup (2nd switch) for the rest of the apps (including WhatsApp) works flawlessly, daily, perfectly fine.\nTIP:: It doesn't matter if you have iCloud Photo library on on both sections, Apple is smart about this and only backcups once (only takes space one time), that's why I say WhatsApp is an inconvenient-odd outlier when it comes to both switches management.\nWith all this, maybe your backup is stuck since you have a 2.5Gb Whatsapp backup to be uploaded, which (if both switches on) requires 5Gb of free space. <- but in my case, not even having the double free space does the trick, auto-backup is not happening.\n", "Q: Different pricing of apps regarding regions in country My customer asked me the following question:\n\"Imagine the situation you have an app that costs 0.99$. Is there any way to make this app free in certain area, such as chosen cities in a country? Obviously we would make a deal with city council that they allow this app to be free within the city\"\nThe straightforward answers is \"no, this is totally impossible\", but after all I decided to ask the community here. \nMaybe there is a way to set some promo codes in in app payments? I mean, the app download is free but to use this app after installation you must do some in-app purchase or fill the promo code to use the app for free. And these promo codes would be delivered to citizens in some way.\nDo you have any idea how to approach such problem? Or maybe it's even pointless to look for any solution?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: You can use the promo codes\n\nYou can request up to 100 promo codes for every version of your app. To request promo codes for an app version, the version’s status must be Ready for Sale or Pending Developer Release.\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/ProvidingPromoCodes.html\nYou can send gift\n\nLearn how to send iTunes Gifts in the iTunes Store, iBooks Store1, and App Store.

Then I decided that I didn't want it and uninstalled it. \nHowever on all website videos (news) when I go to play the video it shows a download bar just above the video and if I click it, it just shows an unable to find link page via finder. I have tried all ways to get rid of this download facility but can't. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: To properly uninstall Wondershare AllMyTube for Mac you have to remove additionally the following files or folders - besides the app itself:\n/Users/[user]/Library/Application Support/MediaDownloadKit\n/Users/[user]/Library/Application Support/Wondershare AllMyTube\n/Users/[user]/Library/Application Support/Safari/Extensions/AllMyTube.safariextz\n\nIf you have no other Wondershare apps you may also remove:\n/Users/[user]/Library/Application Support/wondershare\n\nwith [user]: your user name\nIf you usually use Chrome check the Chrome extensions from inside Google Chrome and delete the Wondershare AllMyTube extension.

A great deal smaller than the 4.6GB of iOS8. \nMy question is quite simple - how is this possible? Was there a great deal of redundant code in iOS8?\nSource - http://www.wired.com/2015/06/ios-9-new-features/?mbid=social_fb\n\nA: The space needed to download the first part of the installer was optimized. It's possible to engineer for any number of trade offs - in this case, work was done to reduce the footprint of the download. \nI haven't reverse engineered the installer, but my hunch is that iOS 8 added new features to allow better cleaning and update hooks so this is more a feature of iOS 8 which runs the new installer than 9 being so much smaller. I'm sure 9 is somewhat smaller, but this is a big jump as you have noticed. \n", "Q: Downgrading from iOS 9.1 Beta to iOS 9 Stable and Keeping Picture Data I'm in a bit of a predicament. I have the iOS 9.1 beta installed, and I'd like to downgrade to iOS 9 stable (released today, 9/16).\nI don't have a backup from iOS 8, so I understand that there's no way for me to downgrade without wiping my phone and reinstalling all of my apps and data. That's fine.\nWhat I'm concerned about are my pictures and videos, especially keeping all of the dates intact. I've had a bad experience before importing pictures onto an iPhone and having the dates all be the same.\nWhat backup service or desktop app should I use to best restore my pictures to my phone after I have restored the iOS 9 base image? I have the images on my computer, as well as on OneDrive. I'm running Windows, and do not have easy access to OSX.\n\nA: You can actually use your whole iOS 9.1 beta backup onto the iOS 9.0 stable release (installing backup made in newer firmware onto older firmware). I'm glad I managed it and I want to share the method.\nFirst you have to backup in iTunes (while still in iOS 9.1 beta). Then, you have to find the directory where your backup is.\n\n\n*\n\n*On a Mac, go to finder-->go-->go to folder, and input ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\n\n*On Windows, go to \\Users\\(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\Windows\nFind the latest folder (with lots of weird numbers and alphabets). You can sort by date to do this. Open the folder, and you'll get LOTS of text files. Search for info.plist and open it using a text editor or Xcode. Under \"software version\", it says 9.1. Change it to 9.0 and close the file.\nYou restore your device to iOS 9.0 in iTunes (since 9.0 is released it will restore it to 9.0 by default, not 8.4.1 anymore), and then after it's done you can restore from the backup you just made. It was made in iOS 9.1 but the computer thinks it's 9.0.\n\nA: I haven't had any issues using the iCloud photo library to commingle photos amongst iOS 8, 9.0 and 9.1\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable cloud library on the phone\n\n*Wait and check all is there at https://iCloud.com/\n\n*Restore to iOS 9.0\n\n*Sign in to iCloud and enable cloud library - download originals\n\n\nMy safety valve is of course OS X Photos where I have point in time backups of the originals.\nYou don't need any software on the PC if you want to move your photos into the cloud before you do the wipe and downgrade. Also, you can use iTunes on the PC to make two backups of the 9.1 device. Assuming your downgrade goes badly, you can at least go back to where you are today with the photos on 9.1 again and re-do the backup or choose a different photo sync solution.\n\nA: I have been using Google Photos app online and on my iphone. I open it once a day and it backs up all of the photos I have taken that have not been backed up yet...then I delete them from my iphone and free up much needed space AND it gives me access to ALL of my photos; over a decade's worth of pics and 150GB+ of pics all there online or in the Google Photos App.\n", "Q: Corruptions within Calendar: duplicates. How to analyse their cause and fix? I am using Calendar on a Mac running MacOS X Mountain Lion (10.8.5).\nThis Mac is manually regularly synchronized with an iPhone running iOS 7.1.2.\nThis Calendar is storing 15 years of events organized within 9 \"calendars\". Since some of this information is highly sensitive, professionnal or private, I don't synchronize them on any form of public store calendar (iCloud, Google Calendar…). On the other hand I have many Time Machine backups and full backups.\nRecently I discovered quite unexpectedly that since summer 2001 I have duplicated full day events within Calendar on my Mac. I have been able to see these ones quickly since their duplicate nature is directly visible. This isn't a general case: most of my full day events aren't\nduplicated. But all my 9 \"calendars\" are hit by this corruption.\nI estimate that I have about a few hundreds of events in this case.\nI see the same corruption on my iPhone.\n\nI exported one of my calendar, and extracted one of the duplicated entries.

Another command I've tried is sudo  /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock, and this returns 2015-09-16 10:26:35.219 Dock[1854:178195] __33-[WVSpaces _initializeFullscreen]_block_invoke: fullscreen message error: Connection invalid). In addition, several standard user interface elements, such as command-tab, spaces, and trackpad gestures, no longer work. When I login as a guest user, though, everything works just fine. I'm confused how to get these UI elements working again.\nEdit: I've checked the system console, and it appears as if the dock is constantly trying to launch, but failing.\n\nA: Sometimes the LaunchAgent (launchd job) that ensures that the Dock starts up gets stuck. Try unloading and re-loading it:\nlaunchctl unload -F /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Dock.plist\nlaunchctl   load -F /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Dock.plist\nlaunchctl start com.apple.Dock.agent\n\nThe Dock is an app, and apps run as the current user, not as root. (To convince yourself that this is true, remember that each user has their own Dock.) So don't start it with sudo, unless you want to see the root user's Dock. You should be able to start it the way you did (except without sudo), given that the LaunchAgent is unloaded:\nlaunchctl unload -F /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Dock.plist\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock\n\nThe reason you need to unload the LaunchAgent is because it will reserve certain ports/services for use by the Dock process it's (unsuccessfully) trying to launch. This keeps your manually-launched Dock process from using them.\n", "Q: iTunes opens automatically when CD inserted I don't use iTunes, but I can't prevent it from automatically opening every time a CD is inserted. \nI have already changed the system preferences for when a CD/DVD is inserted to \"ignore\" or to \"open other program\"-- but it seems that iTunes 12 overrides these system preferences.  \nI've also looked at the preferences within iTunes, but there is no option to \"ignore\" when CD is inserted (though I am almost certain there used to be!)\n\n\n\nA: Try changing the system preference (as per your screenshot) for \"when you insert a music CD\" (or whichever one is causing you an issue) to \"Open in iTunes\" and then immediately back to \"Ignore\".

I just added two contacts to the contacts app on my iPhone (iOS 9.1) and after each I had a dialog asking me to enter my Facebook password, presumably so it could cross-reference this with my Facebook account. I didn't enter my password and instead went looking for a setting that links the Contacts and Facebook apps together but could not find anything. Is there such a setting? If so, where? If not, is Contacts sending data to Facebook?\n\nA: On iOS 9, if you go to the iPhone Settings app > Facebook (that's in the 7th \"block\" of settings as you scroll down, with social media accounts like Twitter, Flickr and Vimeo—whether you have an account or not), there is a disclaimer:\n*Photos and user names are automatically updated for Facebook friends. Choose \"Update All Contacts\" to temporarily provide Facebook with email addresses and phone numbers from your contacts to update photos and user names for all matching contacts.\"\nThere is an \"Update All Contacts\" button. In addition, you can control there whether Contacts.app has access to your Facebook account (if you have one) on that same settings panel. You can control whether the Facebook app has access to your contacts through Settings > Privacy > Contacts (I think that's the same on iOS 8 and 9).\n", "Q: How can I check that my Apple Watch is backed up before upgrading to iOS 9? I'm looking to research what to do to back up my Apple Watch settings and such before I upgrade from iOS 8 to iOS 9 on my iPhone.

You can probably trust things if the dates and sizes there make sense.\nApple has an article that explains the non-upgrade/normal backup scenario, so one avenue is to perform the following steps in order.\n\n\n*\n\n*Verify that the iPhone is backing up to iTunes using a password to encrypt the backup and/or use iCloud for backup. (Health data is not backed up otherwise)\n\n*Verify that the watch and iPhone are in range an paired by using the watch glance that shows Airplane Mode/Do Not Disturb/Silent and ping the iPhone.\n\n*Run one backup before unpairing the watch (or one each to iCloud and to iTunes if you are worried that iCloud could be too busy on launch day or your network would be slow to restore from iCloud)\n\n*Open the Apple Watch app on the iOS 8 iPhone and choose Unpair Apple Watch - this forces a complete backup of the watch data to the iOS device\n\n*Run a second backup (or second pair of backups) to iCloud and/or iTunes.\n\n*Consider saving the iTunes backup folder contents (compress the folder and save it to an external drive, etc...) just in case.\n\n\nAt that point, you can run the iOS 9 update. If you want to re-pair the watch, that would be fine since you have a known backup with the data embedded in the iOS backup.\nAlso, once the iOS 9 update is done, you will want to run the Apple Watch app to update your watch to watchOS 2.0 if you wish. It happens as a second/separate step to upgrading to iOS 9 on your iPhone.\n\nA: Actually you can see your backup dates from settings local usage > watch.app\n\n", "Q: ios 9 vs. ios 9.1 beta I am running iOS 9.1 beta and it seems pretty good and more stable than past iOS 9 iterations.\nWill my iPhone 5S prompt me to upgrade to the public release of iOS 9 today?\n\nA: You will not be prompted to update today since the 9.0 release will be lower than the 9.1 beta you are running.

Is there an equivalent command in OS X? I tried using system_profiler command, but it returns more than 50,000 lines of response with tens of entries related to my sound card, and I don't exactly know what keyword I have to look for.\n\nA: The system_profiler data type corresponding to audio device information is SPAudioDataType, so you can run:\nsystem_profiler SPAudioDataType\n\nBut this won't yield much information about hardware volume control capability of your sound card.\nA better way of checking for more specific hardware information is to use ioreg command. In order to check whether your sound card supports hardware volume control run the following and then check whether your sound card appears in the results:\nioreg -trc IOAudioLevelControl\n\nMy Cambridge Audio USB DAC that doesn't have support hardware volume control does not appear on this list, while my other DACs and sound cards do appear on it.\nIf you are using an external USB device, you can also run the following to make sure your device is recognized as an audio device:\nioreg -trc AppleUSBAudioEngine\n\nIf your device supports hardware volume control, you will see one or more IOAudioLevelControl entries under your audio device's entry.\nBut apart from all the command line mumbo jumbo you can as well check the OSX's volume control when using your sound card to see if it is disabled!\n", "Q: iOS 9 Update Failed in iPhone & iPad \"Software update failed. An error occurred downloading iOS 9\" - weird message after clicking 'Download and install'. Restarting devices didn't help. What's the problem?\n\nA: iOS 9 just came out and since many are trying to update to it, it seems like a server overload on Apple's part, this article from 9to5Mac also confirms this. Unfortunately, all you can do is be patient. I still only see the iOS 8.4.1 update available on my iPhone 5S.\n\nA: Golden Rule - don't do the Download & Install at the same time.  \nHit \"Download only\" when iTunes asks you. Saves a lot of heartache in the long run. \nIt ought to go without saying that you should both sync & backup to iTunes before doing any upgrade.\nOne very smart thing to do before trying to long-haul any large file is to reboot all your network hardware; modem, router, puter etc.\nI got my update first try, but I couldn't for the life of me persuade it to login to iCloud. Power-cycling my WiFi [which had been running for months since its last cycle] simply 'fixed it'.  \nAs with anything so vague as 'switch it off then on again' - YMMV.\n\nA: Another easy fix is to insure there is enough memory remaining.  I had to delete or transfer a lot of photos, videos, music, etc. to get back enough space to download the new iOS. \n", "Q: iOS9: configure spotlight news suggestions When I swipe left from the first page of my home screen, iOS 9 brings me to the spotlight screen.\nThere I can see Siri suggestions and news.\nIs there a way to configure which news are showed in this page?\nNote: I do not have the news app, I suppose because it is not yet available in all the countries.\n\nA: Edit: As of iOS 10 you can remove the news widget.\nIt is not possible in iOS 9.

At work I have 3 devices to experiment with today: An iPhone 5, an iPhone 6, and an iPad mini.\nThe iPhone 5 had iOS 8.4.1 installed on it. Early this afternoon (US Eastern time zone) iOS 9 showed up on the iPhone 5 as an update.\nMy iPhone 6 and iPad Mini both have iOS 8.4 on them (Not 8.4.1, 8.4). Software update on both devices offers to update to 8.4.1.\nAfter about an hour of waiting, I decided to try installing 8.4.1 on my iPhone 6. Sure enough, once I was through the install process and actively online, I'm offered an update to iOS 9.0. My iPad mini still shows the next update as iOS 8.4.1, not 9.0.\nWTF? These are big, time-consuming updates. It seems silly to have to download and run the full install process for an intermediate step update.\nIs this how Apple does over the air updates to iOS 9? I thought Apple bundled updates into a \"combined update?\" but don't see a way to do hat other than downloading the install image and using iTunes to update over USB. \n\nA: this problem occurs when you already have a downloaded update (for example, you have downloaded 8.4.1 but not installed it yet).\nEasiest way to correct is to delete the update (Settings-General-Usage-Manage Storage - look for iOS8.4.1 (or whatever version has been downloaded).\nAfter deleting the old update, a check for software update will show iOS9\n\nA: Yes, if you haven't installed 8.4.1 and you haven't been prompted to install 9.0, then it appears that the installation of 8.4.1 will enable you to also upgrade to 9.0.\nI resisted upgrading to 8.4.1 because I don't really care for Apple Music. I really wanted 9.0 though but until today the update was not enabled for me. I finally decided to try installing 8.4.1 as a gateway to 9.0 and it worked. Immediately after my upgrade, I went to check for other upgrades and was pleased to see that 9.0 was now available.\n\nA: Deleting the downloaded 8.4.1 from my iPhone immediately opened up downloading 9.0. I would agree that you don't need to install 8.4.1 first.\n\nA: No it does not. You can have 8.0 installed and update directly to iOS 9.0. Sometimes you have to wait for Apple to stop signing the last release (iOS 8.4.1) before it will offer up the next release (iOS 9.0). Until then you should be able to download and install the iOS 9.0 update through iTunes.\n\nA: No need to download iOS 8.4.1, it will upgrade straight to iOS 9 from iOS 8.2.\n", "Q: Will i be able to upgrade from ios 9.1 beta to 9.1 stable I upgraded ios to 9.1 beta from 9.0 last beta a week ago. However i can't downgrade it to 9.0 stable as i don't have a backup. \nHow will i be able to update to 9.1 stable from 9.1 beta when 9.1 stable released ?\nThanks\n\nA: Are you saying that your firmware is higher than iOS 9.1 and you want to downgrade back to 9.1? If so, you can't because Apple has stopped signing iOS 9.1 since December, I think. You can learn more from this post.\n", "Q: Apple News app missing I have just updated to iOS9 but can't find the Apple News app. All web sites imply that the News app is part of the released version of iOS9. \nInterestingly, the U.K. Apple site whats new with iOS9 implies its 'coming soon'\nIs this a UK only issue?\n\nA: You need to set your region from settings.app to USA\n\n", "Q: power mac G5 won't boot past the logo - shuts down to a black screen I think the HD is full?

I did a clean install of Microsoft Office for Mac 2016 from installers from my campus bookstore. I customized the install to include only Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. I have not had the previews, and I just updated to 15.14.0 (150911). I am running a brand new Macbook Pro 9,2 with Yosemite 10.10.5. Although I did a clean install, I did not uninstall MS Office 2011 apps. I have no issues running them concurrently.\nIt seems some others have found problems with altering the Normal template and found no joy from MS forums. It seems there is confusion about the directory location of saved templates. So, I have located my Word 2016 templates at:\n/Users/<username>/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates/\n\nThis folder currently has Normal.dotm and Normal.dotx. Following official MS advice to save-as templates does not work for me. Other user advice to save in the above location returns this dialog:\n\nWord cannot give a document the same name as an open document.\n  Type a different name for the document you want to save.\n  (Normal.dotm)\n\nI click OK, and then this dialog:\n\nThe document “Document1” could not be saved as “Normal.dotm”.\n\nShould I not be trying to save Word Macro-Enabled Template (.dotm)? OK, fine. I try saving differently, via Normal.dotx, which is where the Normal.dotx got into the folder in the first place. There's no problem with that. But when I relaunch Word 2016, none of the template saves are present. Every time I start Word 2016, I get the same Draft view with fonts Calibri, etc. etc. This is not the case with Word 2011. Seems I can't beat it, so what gives?\n\nA: This worked for me:\nYou may wish to update your Normal template as well.  To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Normal.dotm template (Note: You MUST navigate to the Normal template using the File menu in Word, and choose \"Open\".  Don't try it from the Finder or you will make a copy of Normal each time.)\n\n*Close all other documents (this is important...if you don't, Word holds a hidden instance of the old version open).\n\n*Change the paper size.\n\n*Add and remove a space from the text (to force Word to save the document)\n\n*Save the Normal template.  (If Word prompts you for a file name, you did not open the file correctly and you now have a copy that is not a template.  Cancel out and start again...)\n\n*Close Word.\n\n\nShould be good when you re-open.\n\nA: I encountered a similar problem and was able to arrive at a solution. When upgrading to Word for Mac 2016 I lost all of the customizations made to the Normal.docm template. The solution was to replace the current Normal.docm file with the old Normal.docm file. Here are the steps: Open Word for Mac and ensure all documents are closed. Then, through the Word application itself, open the Normal.docm template file associated with the old version of Word. Do this by typing .docm in the search field of the Open dialog box. You may need to ensure you are searching in the Template folder as identified in the answer above. I found a file entitled Normal.docm.bak. Once this file is opened, save it in the same location under a new file name (Normal2.docm), ensuring that is is being saved as a Microsoft Word Macro-enabled Template. This can be selected in the File Format drop down box. Uncheck the Hide Extensions checkbox to ensure the file type is not .docx or anything else. Reopen this Normal2.docm file and convert it to the Word 2016 format by selecting the \"Convert Document\" command (File --> Convert Document). Next, Quit Word and search for Normal2.docm in Finder. Open the folder that contains this file, delete Normal.docm and rename Normal2.docm as Normal.docm. Reopen Word, and your Styles associated with your old version should be restored.\n\nA: The why is pretty simple - Microsoft has entirely re-architected the Offic 2016 for Mac product line to share the majority of the code with windows with a thin layer of native UI/UX code for each platform (macOS / windows / android / iOS / etc..) and another thin layer of foundation code to interact with the filesystem and other platform-specific API and design considerations.\n\nThe filesystem archeticture for macOS is responsible for the change to user customized content needing to change (as well as sandbox considerations needed should Word ever be distributed via the Mac App Store) that is well documented in this gem of a support article:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://macadmins.software/docs/UserContentIn2016.pdf\nNow, the what to do about this is much harder. You have some other great answers, but I wanted to get the user documentation above and the architectural discussion from this video here for reference.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iBwgDT1Zy9c\n\nA: I tried this method and found it very cumbersome and confusing. What I did instead was very simple.\nAfter closing out of Word altogether, try the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to File/New From Template.\n\n*If you see the template you want to be the default listed there, right click on it to get \"View in finder.\"\n\n*You should also see the current Normal template in that same folder. Rename that to Normal-old.\n\n*Rename the one you want to use to Normal (my old one was \"normal\"...note the lowercase N).\n\n*Reopen Word and now try just creating a new document from the Blank template, or by just hitting Cmd-N. It should work now.\n\nA: I tried all these solutions presented here, but none worked. I finally thought why not simply do a search for Normal.dotm, and who would have thought, Microsoft has changed the location of that file. Again! Go figure...\nWord 2017 v15.32 (170309) is hiding the Normal.dotm file here: ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Documents/Normal.dotm\nNow everything is back to 'Normal' again.\n\nA: All answers here are too complicated.\nTry this:\n1. In Word for Mac - Use the page setup option to create the page defaults you prefer.\n\n\n*Click 'File' and then 'Save as Template'\n\n*In the name section, name it as 'Normal.dotm_2'\nThen go into your Templates folder and delete the old Normal.dotm file\nDo this by:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder click 'Go' at the top and then click on Computer\n\n*Double-Click on Macintosh HD\n\n*Double-click 'Library'\n\n*In the upper-right search window, type 'Templates'\n\n*Double-click the file named 'Templates'\n\n*You will see two templates - Delete the old Normal.dotm file\n\n\nWord will always open your preferred file defaults from now on.\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: Two Apple IDs, can I use both on same device?

How can I quickly migrate my notes from Evernote to the new version of iOS’s Notes shipping with iOS 9? Most notes are just text or simple images with text.\n\nA: The fastest way to do that would be to borrow a Mac and make a new account.\nDownload the free Evernote app to the Mac and sign in to iCloud and enable note syncing. \nFrom there you can drag/drop and copy them far faster than you could on iOS.\nThe evernote app on iOS is intentionally designed to not let you use the inter-app sharing feature to simply move the note contents to another app.\nInstead, they coded a public/private web link infrastructure that looks designed to keep your content on their servers yet allow sharing of some notes as long as you force your sharing recipient to make an account and log in to the service. Basically, your notes are in a \"gated community\" and notes.app isn't welcome to import that content without a fight or some effort.\nDepending on how good you are at processing XML files, you might be able to export your entire notebook and process it into a form that's amenable to notes. Again, you need a PC or a Mac to accomplish that transformation as well as the initial backup.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://evernote.com/contact/support/kb/#!/article/28607737\nEven better, both Notes and Evernote are scriptable on OS X, so you might be able to craft a nice tool to do the migration of the data.\n\nA: OS X 10.11.4 supports Evernote import to Notes (import of the .enex file format).

I recently purchased a used iPhone 6, originally on the Verizon network. I'm an app developer, and as such, only need to be able to use this phone over wifi. However, when I boot up the phone I reach a \"SIM Required\" screen.\nIs there a way to bypass this restriction or do I need to buy a cheap prepaid plan to overcome it?\n\nA: If the phone is carrier locked, your best bet is to establish service with Verizon and get it unlocked. It's probably unlocked though so you might have luck putting any carrier's valid SIM into the phone. The SIM doesn't necessarily even need to be active - just that it once was valid and used. \nBasically a Verizon sim will get you past the screen, possibly others as well initially. \n\nA: All Verizon LTE-capable phones come unlocked due to an agreement between Verizon and the FCC.

Google got approved with their photos anyway so there should be a way (yes, I'm not Google but hopefully there is a solution for ordinary developer as well).\n\nA: Background Fetch only allows you to download data and the process exit if the transfer time is superior to 30 seconds. There are limited things you can do while the app is in Background mode : Background Execution\nIf you want to upload your photos in the background you'll need to use background transfer service, but once the task is finished the app will not upload more data.

The notes associated with my gmail weren't. Before the upgrade, I could lump all notes together in one list so I didn't even need to worry where they were being stored. But now it looks like half the lists I use frequently are on my iPhone, and half are associated with my gmail. Is there a way in iOS9 I can put them all back in one list (e.g. see all)? Or even just convert all the plaintext gmail notes over to the new style? \n\nA: If you want the new style, then you need to put your notes into the iCloud Notes account, because it is a must that the server support this rich text format.\n\nA: I found that you can move them all together on your phone by clicking edit and on the bottom left there is a Move All link. From each folder you can then move to the folder on your phone so they are all together. Sadly it does not allow you to move from the phone to say gmail, icloud or exchange notes but you can move those all onto your phone in the same folder. That's not what I want but hey at least it gets them together.\nUPDATE: Although already on iOS 9 the above was before I upgraded to the new notes. Once on the new notes the move from my phone to icloud seems to have just made a copy as now I have them in both places. I actually wanted to move them all to my exchange account but that iss not an option. OK that is a glith in iOS 9 it just looked as if it was on both by the number of notes shown. When I went into the phone notes they were then empty and on exit from there the number dropped to zero. Still no way to move to exchnage or gmail but you can at least move everything to the cloud or the phone.

I couldn't ever get the wireless keyboard to work, so I've returned it and trying to use my internal Mac keyboard again.\nIssue\nI am noticing that the button \"3\" is not doing anything.  I press it, and nothing registers.  So I uninstalled Karabiner through Karabiner's uninstall utility, thinking that it would solve the issue.  But the problem persists - the \"3\" button doesn't do anything.  Every other key works great, no problems.\nWhat's even more strange is that I can press \"option\" + \"3\", and I get the £ symbol.  So clearly the button is not \"broken\" in terms of hardware, because I can definitely use it after pressing \"option\".  So what is happening when I press \"3\"?\nI reinstalled Karabiner to see if there was a setting I could fix.  I used Karabiner's EventViewer, which shows what keyboard code is being used, etc.  When I press \"3\", literally nothing get's logged or trigged.  When I press \"option\" + \"3\", it shows the logs and triggers.\nWhen I open the Mac Virtual keyboard onscreen, press the button \"3\" - nothing happens!\nI've tried restoring Karabiner to default settings, tried uninstalling it again - no luck.\nWhat is going on?  How come \"3\" does nothing by itself?  Super annoying.\nUPDATE\nStill having the problem, but I've noticed that in safe mode the \"3\" works fine and normal.  How do I debug this knowing that bit of information now?\n\nA: Based on Safe Mode comment, make sure the Karabiner kext (kernel extension) is uninstalled. Look in /System/Library/Extensions.\nCheck both your home directory Library/Application Support folder and the System/Library/Application Support folders and make sure the Karabiner folder is deleted--which should contain the private.xml document.\nSafe Mode does not load non-Apple kexts so that suggests to me that the Karabiner kext did not get uninstalled. Not sure but I think the mods you make end up in that private.xml file. Lots of other files in that folder too. The uninstall scripts look like they should work but it's important to verify this yourself manually.

If that doesn't do it, authorize first with Store -> Authorize This Computer... with the same Apple ID you used to purchase those apps, and then try again.\n", "Q: Is Secure Empty Trash still necessary after maverick? With Maverick, hardware is encrypted by default, do we still need to secure empty trash?\nCan files still be retrieved after deletion since the entire hardware has been encrypted?\n\nA: Mavericks does not enable encryption (FileVault 2) by default -- it may (if several requirements are met) offer to enable it during the initial setup process, but it's not the default. Also, even if the volume is encrypted, insecurely deleted files can still be recovered by someone who knows an enabled password (usually any user with an account on the computer).\nSo, I'd consider Secure Empty Trash to still be relevant (in at least some situations) in Mavericks, even when FileVault is enabled.\nHowever... Secure Empty Trash is not really enough, and hasn't been for a long time. In many apps, when you edit a file, it saves changes by deleting (insecurely) the old file and writing the new version. Securely deleting one version still leaves any older (deleted) versions lying around the disk. So you really need to use the Erase Free Space feature in Disk Utility to go back and make sure they're overwritten.\nOh, and neither Secure Empty Trash nor Erase Free Space really work right on SSDs, just on magnetic HDs. So ... it's complicated.\n", "Q: Unlocking an O2 Iphone I was asked if I could unlock an iPhone today, the answer was, of course, a resounding no. Intrigued, I dug a little deeper to see what would be required and if it were possible.\nAll of the information I found either led to using the o2(UK) form or using a third party site. He tells me that after a long arduous conversation with 02 that the firm option is not viable for him. So I'm wondering, what is it that these various sites offer to do that is different from this 'form'. All they ask for is the IMEI number, cash and in return a promise that it'll be unlocked in x number of days.\nAs far as I'm aware Apple has a particular contract with the network meaning that some sort of communication needs to pass back and forth between them to enable this unlocking to take place else it may well be temporary.\nSo, with that in mind, are these sites suggesting that they get in touch with both Apple & the network, is it their contacts within the relevant depts that we're effectively paying for.\nIs there another solution?\nI wouldn't mind attempting to unlock an old phone I have just for the 'tadaaa' factor, we do love it when we get things to work that perhaps we shouldn't have. :D\nThanks in advance for any advice, answers, suggestions or tips.\nalso, if there's a programmatic way of solving this...I'm all ears, I'll happily tear my phone apart and rig it up to a circuit if it means solving the mystery.\n\nA: I have tried one of those sites in 2010 to unlock my iPhone 4 (SFR), it worked perfectly and I'm still using it. I think that these types of websites have people with access to Apple databases and can easily unlock it from there. I can't think of another way to unlock your phone without going through the original carrier, Apple or these websites.

But since Apple changed their storage, I should have 50GB, but there is still 20. Why?\n\n\n\nA: \nIf you purchased a monthly plan before September 16, 2015, your\n  account was upgraded automatically. If you're currently on an annual\n  plan, you'll continue to renew annually at that rate. If you select a\n  new monthly plan, your annual plan won't be available to you.\n\nSource : https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201238\n\nA: Answer from Apple after a few days:\n\nWe recently updated our iCloud storage plans and have increased your storage from 20GB to 50GB - at no additional cost. We increased iCloud storage so you can get even more out of services like iCloud Photo Library and iCloud Drive.\nYour storage plan will automatically renew at 50GB on your current renewal date and your credit card on file will be charged 0,99 € each month until you change or cancel your plan.\nThe iCloud Team\n\n\nA: I pay annually (not month-to-month), and had patiently waited until my Oct. 7th renewal date for the upgrade to take place. It never did.  I finally called today, and found out the free upgrade is only for month-to-month plans, NOT annual plans! :(\n", "Q: How to use an old iMac as an external display for a MacBook via wifi? There have been several questions how to connect a (new) MacBook to an (old) iMac so the latter will work as a second, bigger display for the former, but all were assuming a hardware connection, i.e. a DVI, Displayport or Thunderbolt cable. Apple even has a support page for Target Display Mode, which is only available in a limited number of recent, but not too recent iMacs. I’m looking for a software solution, because though (Mini) Display Port is available on both my devices, they only support video output: \n\n\nI’m trying to connect a 2010 MBA running OS X 10.10.5 with a 2006 iMac running 10.6.8, the latest OS X available for that model. Both are connected to the same private wifi network.\nAvatron Air Display seems like it could work, but versions 2 and 3 don’t support OS X 10.6 any more and if I try to connect v3 with v1.6 it fails. Synergy may be an alternative, but before wasting 10 bucks I’d like to know if anyone had luck with that piece of software in a setup like mine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there other alternatives that I didn’t find, maybe even free ones?\n\n*Could I somehow get at least AirPlay video support? The iMac runs Kodi (previously known as XBMC) which allegedly offers some AirPlay capability.\n\n*If surprisingly there was a hardware solution I’ve overlooked (e.g. using USB or, cough, Firewire), that would be fantastic of course.\n\n\nI’m not quite sure whether How can I use an old mac as an external display using software? was asking the same thing.\n\nA: I've answered the question you've mentioned.

In System Preferences, Security & Privacy, Accessibility: Dropbox.app is there and it is checked.\nWhy does Dropbox need access to the OS's accessibility features? Is it safe to uncheck it, will it keep working fine?\n\nA: July 18, 2019 (update)\nFound this related post detailing the behavior and another one from the same author explaining how Dropbox deceives the user into getting accessibility permissions.¹\n¹These are both close to two years old, but only found them today.\nJanuary 18, 2019 (update)\nI installed Dropbox today on Mojave and in settings there is something regarding accessibility I had not seen before. Image follows.\n\nFrom Dropbox help center:\n\nWhy does Dropbox want to turn on accessibility?\nAccessibility is an Apple setting that allows applications on your Mac to interact with other applications. For example, it allows the Dropbox badge to work in non-Dropbox applications. \nIf you don’t turn on accessibility, you won’t get access to Dropbox features like:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The Dropbox badge\n  \n*Seeing who’s viewed your files \n  \n*Better prioritization for file syncing\n  \n\nAdditional information from the Dropbox help center:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I turn the Dropbox badge on or off?, and\n\n*What is the Dropbox badge?.\n\n\n\nJuly 12, 2016 (old answer)\nI found an answer in the community forum of Dropbox. A user sent a ticket to Dropbox asking about this and he posted the reply there. According to the reply, Dropbox needs to control the computer in order to keep our data safe. I'm copying both the ticket and the answer over here.\n\nTicket #3172481: DB: Dropbox app listed under \"Allow the apps below\nto control your computer\".\n\nI'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation why Dropbox needs\npermission to control Mac computers, I'd just quite like to know what it is.\n\nThank you for writing in regarding the security of your account\n  information. I can certainly understand you wanting to ensure the\n  security of data you have entrusted to Dropbox. I will be happy to\n  explain the measures taken by Dropbox to ensure the security of\n  everyone's account.\nPermission to control the computer is just another way of saying that\n  there are certain system permissions Dropbox needs to function, and\n  many of those permissions are to establish secure connections in order\n  to protect the data contained within your Dropbox folders.\nOperating system permissions prevent files from being viewed or edited\n  by unauthorized logins. Permissions can be set any number of ways and\n  can be restored manually through a fairly simple process.\nAnother possible cause of issues with Dropbox arise when conflicts\n  exist between your local network sharing or folder redirection\n  preferences setup in folders or files within your Dropbox. Similar\n  effects can also happen when your Dropbox folder or its system files\n  are located in a mounted network drive or a remote location (like\n  roaming profiles) since this could cause Dropbox to not have constant\n  access or permissions to operate in those locations. This is\n  especially an issue if other people in the network could be accessing\n  the same data. For these reasons, I'd suggest that you ensure that\n  your setup does not include any of the above scenarios.\nAdditional permissions my be required when syncing mobile devices,\n  particularly when photos or photo albums are involved. Since there is\n  a great deal of personally identifying information stored in the\n  metadata for a photo file (yes, people can find you if they know how\n  to decrypt this metadata), some of the additional permissions required\n  for our Carousel app, for example, include:\niOS\n-Contacts\n  -Photos\n  -Camera\n  -Notifications\n  -Background App Refresh\n  -Use Cellular Data\nAndroid\n-In-app purchases\n  -Device & app history\n  -Identity\n  -Contacts/Calendar\n  -Photos/Media/Files\n  -Camera/Microphone\n  -Wi-Fi connection information\n  -Device ID & call information\nFacebook does not offer a large amount of granularity or retroactive\n  permissions control, so we need to request all the permissions we need\n  or even may need in the future.\nI want to reiterate the point that all these steps are taken in order\n  to prevent access to your data, not to facilitate access to your data.\n  Dropbox takes great pride in being a company worth of the trust of our\n  users, and we would never ask you to allow us access with the intent\n  of violating that trust.\nI hope this helps clarify our account security measures regarding\n  permissions. Thank you so much for using Dropbox, and please let me\n  know if there's anything else I can help with.\n\n\nAnother user asked the following pertinent questions, but he never got any answers for those at least not in that thread.\n\n\"(...) why the need to give up access across the board as opposed to\n  an as needed basis? (...) It's hard for me to grasp why giving up OS\n  level access to data that Dropbox doesn't need for our use, makes our\n  data safer? (...) Syncing data for example seems to work fine without\n  the permissions checked. What am I missing? I'm not trying to be\n  combative; just hoping to get a better understanding.

He's the only contact with the surname Jones.  I swipe down or right to get the spotlight search, and start typing jones one character at a time.  When I type \"j\" I get\nTOP HITS\nJane Airy\nCONTACTS\nAbbadab Fabrics\nDan Anderson\n\nWhen I type the \"o\" I get\n(nothing)\n\nI.e. no search results.\nBoth Abbadab Fabrics and Dan Anderson do have a \"j\" somewhere in some field - but so do lots of other contacts.\nI've tried typing \"Jo\" but same results.  Obviously, this used to work in ios8.\n\nFurther details in response to questions: I'm on the released iOS 9 build (13A344), not any developer or other pre-release. I only have one account syncing Contacts - Google Sync. There's plenty of storage available: 11.0GB out of 15.2GB.\n\nA: I tried two fixes, and this one seemed to work after playing around with it for a while:\nFix #1 (didn't seem to work, but may have helped)\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off all the Spotlight switches in Preferences > General > Spotlight.\n\n*Do a hard reset by pressing and holding the Home button (big circle below the screen) and the Sleep/Wake button (on top of the iPhone) simultaneously.  \n\n*Hold both buttons until the screen goes black, and then release when you see the Apple logo.\n\n*After restart, turn on the Contacts switch in Preferences > General > Spotlight.\n\n*It may take a few minutes, or half an hour for Contacts to show in Spotlight search.\n\n*Turn on other Spotlight switches after Contacts begin to show in Spotlight searches.\n\n\nFix #2\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Contacts app, tap your own contact... Then Groups will display in top left. Tap Groups in the top-left corner, then Hide All Contacts or show all contacts. One of them may default. Tapping just toggles back and forth between the 2 options. The IOS 9 update may have defaulted your option to Hide All which may be the only issue.\n\n*Tap Show All Contacts.\nThis didn't immediately work for me, but then I tried only showing iCloud contacts, and not Facebook contacts, and then it started to work.  However - I noticed some contacts starting to appear after a search, which is when I tried this in the last sentence.  It may very well have been the first fix that solved this, and it was just a matter of waiting for it to work.\nTry both, and also showing different contacts groups, then quitting the contacts app, then hiding and showing again.\n\nA: The spotlight process that indexes space on iOS needs several things to run:\n\n\n*\n\n*space to write the results to storage\n\n*time to index all the content after a change/upgrade\n\n\nIf you have let the phone run for several hours and have checked for more than 1 GB of free space, there might be some other corruption that are breaking things.\nAt that point:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a back up of the phone (perhaps two backups one to iCloud and another to iTunes)\n\n*Power cycle the device\n\n*Verify the storage isn't leaving less than 1 GB of free space\n\n*Turn off wifi network and bluetooth using AirPlane mode (which minimizes changes to let the index process run to completion)\n\n*Power cycle the device while in AirPlane mode.\n\n*Wait another 30 minutes for search to process to get caught up\n\n*Retore the phone\n\n*Test with only contacts and not restoring the backup\n\n\nAt this point, you would likely need Apple Support to triage why a cleanly restored phone with only contacts on it still isn't having spotlight work. Most likely, you will have removed the likely cause of software corruption or free space issues during the restore.\n", "Q: how to move the 'New MacVim Buffer Here' menu into the main context menu?

Unless I am mistaken, I do not have bootcamp on my computer.\nIt should be noted that I am new to Macs so I am treading lightly.\n\nA: You have Windows in a virtual machine. This only runs if you run Parallels so Windows is not normally running.\nTo remove Windows just delete the virtual machine which is just a directory on the disk which by default is ~/Documents/Parallels\nIf you don't know where the files are then I think in in parallels you will have an option to delete the VM\n\nA: On Macs you have at least two ways to \"install\" Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Windows to a newly created separate partition with Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n*Installing Windows using a type-2 hypervisor like Parallels (or VMware Fusion, VirtualBox etc)\n\n\nIn the first case Windows is directly installed to your disk and interacts with your Mac hardware. In the second case Windows is installed to a disk image residing on your Macintosh volume and interacts with virtual hardware entities provided by the hypervisor. The partition layout of your disk isn't effected then.\nOne way to detect which kind of Windows installation is present is opening /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility and checking if you have a second partition usually called BOOTCAMP after your Macintosh HD volume.\nIf such partition is present you have the first type of Windows installation. To delete it open Boot Camp Assistant and remove Windows.\nIf no such partition is present you probably have the second type of Windows installation.

This configuration is needed to get the maximum output resolution of the monitor, but it seems like it disables the volume control somehow.\nWhen accessing the Sound panel of the system settings, it has disabled the Sound off/mute button in the bottom, and on the Output tab it says (in Norwegian): The selected device has no output controls. And the volume control (on keyboard) doesn't do a thing, neither for the 'global' volume or when playing stuff in iTunes.\nMy actual audio output is connected through the monitor through to a set of external speakers. The reason for this connection is that I also use the monitor as TV display by utilising the HDMI port on the monitor.\nDo you have any suggestion on how to re-enable the volume control with this configuration, if at all possible?  Or any alternate solution to enable be listening to sound (not simultaneously) from both the Mac mini and the TV with only one set of speakers (no dual input available on the speakers).\n\nA: HDMI, DisplayPort and Thunderbolt carry a fixed volume digital audio signal so the external device controls the volume.  In the future Apple may implement HDMI-CEC which would allow your computer to control the external device volume via software, similarly some devices have drivers which allow them to do the same.\nIn the meantime, here's a workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install SoundFlower\n\n*Download SoundFlowerBed, copy to /Applications and run.\n\n*SoundFlowerBed menu item -> under SoundFlower (2ch) set output to HDMI.\n\n*System Preferences -> Sound -> select SoundFlower (2ch) as Output device.\n\n*System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items -> Add SoundFlowerBed.\n\n\nNow you have two volume controls: HDMI display volume control and via software on your mac. With this setup your mac is digitally resampling the output and so Mac 100% volume + display 50% volume will likely sound better than Mac 50% volume + display 100% volume.\n", "Q: Display PDF version metadata of a PDF file I am looking for a way to display a PDF file version metadata without having to open the file AcrobatPro.

I track user login times on a couple of shared computers running OSX 10.10.5 using the last command in terminal. It seems after updating from 10.9 the wtmp file gets frequently deleted and only show a few days of history. Is there a command that can stop this from happening? Or an alternative way to track user logins times for the previous month?\n\nA: On older os, the periodic script was the culprit. You could see how it prunes the wtmp file by inspecting the source and by reading the manual page. \nThe actual archive of login data is stored in /var/log/monthly.out.  If that level of detail isn't sufficient, you could customize the daily or even weekly or the monthly script and extract the data you need in the form you need before the file gets truncated. \nSome process is still generating the monthly log in data for each user, but it's summary data and not log in / log out data.\nWhy not enable parental controls for each user to be tracked and simply log the app usage.

The Apple News app is little more than a glorified RSS reader bundled with an in-app web browser.\nIn iOS 10, publishers will be able to distinguish Apple News users from other visitors to their website to a greater extent in iOS 9 due to a new User-Agent for Apple News 2.\n", "Q: iOS 9 upgrade frozen at \"Slide to upgrade\" I'm trying to upgrade to iOS 9 from iOS 7 on a 5C but the upgrade process is frozen at \"Slide to upgrade\". \nReboot just restarts one view or two before \"slide to upgrade\" screen.\nMy iCloud backup is out of date due to storage issues (it wouldn't fit in the free allotment) and I can't create one (\"device has not been configured\") using iTunes so I can't do a restore without losing my data.\n\nA: Apparently this is a known problem when updating from iOS 7 devices straight to iOS 9.\nApple has posted a workaround, which should help you out:\nIf the Slide to Upgrade screen won't go away after you update to iOS 9.\nI'm not posting the text verbatim, in case Apple improves their answer.\nNote that you will need a computer to connect the device to, to make a local backup.\nEdit 2015-09-23\nApple have released iOS 9.0.1 which according to this report\n\naddress issues users have experienced with the Setup Assistant app getting stuck on “Slide to Upgrade.”\n\nI am guessing it will still be necessary to connect to a computer any iOS devices that are stuck at \"Slide to upgrade\".\n\nA: If you havent saved your pictures,you can actually save them. When you're on the screen that says,update completed(before the choose wifi screen), you can connect it to your computer and it will recognise the iphone,you can click the ''trust this computer'' as if you iphone was on main screen. There, when your computer see's your phone,you can look up the files and copy them to the computer, Then do the restore since the pictures are now saved in the computer.\n\nA: You may need to connect the device to iTunes and update/restore it from there. See iTunes help and search for restore or follow this link - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205239. \nThe above article covers your specific \"slide to upgrade\" issue. \n\nThe  good news is that you should be able to connect your phone to iTunes and make a back up even in the state that it's in.  There are only three steps in the article above, so definitely try that first.\nIf you can't get iTunes to trust your device, then you might call AppleCare to see if there's any other option. Since Apple acknowledges that this issue will be fixed in the future version of iOS, they can best advise you how long to wait or if they can help you back up your device.\nAppleCare has training in and can certainly guide you in searching for potential backups.\n\n\n*\n\n*contacts and calendar data stored / synced online\n\n*iCloud backups\n\n*computer backups or syncs\n\n*data that's stored in iCloud and that will re-apply to the device once you wipe it and render it operational\n\n\nHere are the wipe instructions if you're ready to concede backup is not practical and want to get back to using the phone  should everything else above fail you. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201252\n\nA: Download and restore your device to iOS 8.4.1 through iTunes (you may have to put your device in DFU mode).

I have looked but can't find any specifications that say which would be the best match. Routers all seem to have an AC rating AC1750, AC3200 for example which I understand is total Mb speed for both 2.4G and 5Ghz. Where in the iPhone 6 specifications does it say what the speed is so I can find an equally capable AC router?\n\nA: According to http://www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs/, the iPhone 6 supports 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi‑Fi. So any router supporting the same standards should (and usually will) match your phone.\nFor potential speeds, see\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/01/iphone-6-wifi-compared-to-iphone-5s/\n\n*http://www.iclarified.com/44330/iphone-wifi-speed-test-80211ac-iphone-6-plus-vs-80211n-iphone-5s-video\n\n*http://www.iphonehacks.com/2014/09/iphone-6-plus-vs-iphone-6-vs-iphone-5s-speed-test.html\nbut keep in mind that maximal throughput depends on a lot of factors like packet/file size, router model, interference, distance between device and router etc.\n", "Q: Stop access to the iCloud notes app on a lost iPad, but keep my notes on the iCloud website? My iPad is lost.\nI was using the notes app.  I've changed my Apple ID password to stop someone logging in.\nI want to keep my notes and access them by logging into the iCloud website on my laptop.\nI want to stop anyone accessing my notes using the app on my lost iPad.  Is this possible please?\n\nA: Did you enabled the 'Find my iPad' option on your lost device? If so, you can go to iCloud.com and remotely delete all data on the iPad without losing your notes in iCloud. \nIf not, did you use a passcode? All data on the iPad is encrypted and it is highly unlikely that someone evil finds your (locked) device and tries to hack into your notes.\nAnother workaround would require you to use the Notes application on an OS X computer. Set up your iCloud device and another email account that supports notes (most IMAP accounts do). Then open the Notes application and move all of your notes to the new account. This will eventually sync with your lost device, but you would have to access your notes in the new account.\nI do not think that there is a perfect answer to your problem, everything left to do is some damage control. \n", "Q: Need to automate copy / paste graphic selection from Preview to Google Doc I need to paste sequential rectangular selections from a PNG opened in Preview into a designated Google Doc.

I read that in Xcode 7 that you can develop apps for iOS without a developer account, this does not seem the case for me, instead when I try and build my test application (a blank single view application) I get an error saying 'no code signing identities found' and requires me to 'join a program'.\nIs there a way I can develop applications without paying for a developers account (is there a 'free' option in the program options or not? Don't want to go through the steps and find out I was charged $99!)\n\nA: please follow the below steps :- \nRequirements: You must be running iOS 9 on your  devices (iPhone or iPad), latest Xcode 7  and you’ll need a free developer account, which lets you “test on device”.\nStep 1: Launch your application which you want to run  on device.\nStep 2: Connect your iOS device via USB.\nStep 3: In the drop down device selection menu, select your device (not a simulator).\nStep 4: Wait as Xcode 7 indexes and processes symbol files. This may take a while as well, so be patient. Once complete, the status will say Ready.\nStep 5: Click the Play button (Run application). You’ll likely get an error that says “failed to code sign”. That’s okay. Click Fix Issue and click Add to log in with your developer account. Remember, you don’t need a paid developer account, but you will need a free developer account (Apple ID). If you don’t have a developer account, create one by clicking Join a Program instead.\nStep 6: Once you log in, click the Play button again to proceed with the compile. You may receive another error that says An App ID with Identifier…is not available. Please enter a different string. To fix this, click the General tab, and give the Bundle Identifier a unique name (delete the name between the two dots and add your own name. Leave the prefix and suffix as it is).\nStep 7: Click the Play button once more. The compile should complete, and you’ll see the app that you compiled appear on your iOS device’s Home screen.\nStep 8: You’ll need to enable access to the app by trusting the developer on your iOS device. This can be done by going to Settings → General → Profile and tapping on the Developer app and granting access.\nStep 9: Launch the app on your device Home screen, and iOS should allow you to use it.\nHappy code signing :). \nNote: you cannot test Push Notification and In-App purchase on Free Membership Account.\n\nA: You can develop apps for your own iOS device be registering on https://developer.apple.com/resources/.\n\nEnrollment to any specific developer programs is a separate steps which you don't have to do. Happy coding.\n\nA: You don't need to pay for a Apple developer store certificate for personal use and there are waivers for what in the pas was paid-only features of the developer program as well.\nYour personal AppleID is good enough to sign apps in Xcode and load them on a limited number of devices (5 or so) from your Mac to get started with developing. Once you need TestFlight or want to make a signed app that is reviewed - you need to pay or obtain a waiver, but please do get started for free.\nApple now waives the fee for accredited non profit and educational groups. This includes App Store distribution of free apps.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/support/membership-fee-waiver/\nHere’s how I would undo a previous paid AppleID - you might need Apple Developer support to help you release your AppleID from the paid program if you are reusing the same AppleID (and I encourage always reusing the same and not making new accounts when you run into a hiccup like this).\nInstead, delete all Xcode copies you might have installed earlier - whether they are from the Mac App Store or downloaded and then install Xcode 7 from the Mac App store:\n\n*\n\n*https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12\nOnce it downloads, run the app and go to the settings:\n\n*\n\n*click Accounts\n\n*click the + in the lower left and add an Apple ID\n\n*enter a personal Apple ID, the one you use for the App Store is fine to reuse\n\n*you're done\n\nWhen you build an app for iOS, connect the iOS device and choose that AppleID to sign the app when asked.\n\n\nA: The solution that has been marked works. But instead of re-downloading it, you can remove temporary files that Xcode creates on first start. It can be done using apps like CleanMyMac. \n\n\n*\n\n*Select Xcode, then it will find relative files\n\n*select all other than actual Xcode.app binary file\n\n*Uninstall them\n\n\nAnd you are ready to go with fresh install of Xcode\n\n\nA: Update 2020/11/6 :\n\n*\n\n*You can develop on Xcode 7 on the Mac for iOS devices without having entered the developer program, billed 99€/$ per year. You will be able to test freely your program in simulated iOS devices and on a device connected to your Mac.\n\n*You can build your app to execute on the iOS device you connected, once away from your Mac. However, by default, this is only temporary and will only last for 7 days. After that time, your application will not launch anymore on your device. You'll need to reconnect your device and rebuild it in Xcode. This is due to Apple generating a temporary profile for you allowing the iPhone to recognize the app. I've not been made aware of anyway to get around this default behavior, and from what I've been said it is not possible without jailbreaking your iPhone.\n\n*As a consequence, you can develop an app freely though Xcode, but you can't really use it freely, even on your own device.\n\n", "Q: Export iPhone or iPad Backup to an external hard drive Is there a way to transport the Data of an iPhone / iPad Backup and the saved apps to an external hard drive? \nI'm using iTunes 12.3 on a MacBookProRetina with Yosemite \n\nA: Yes - Apple documents the folder in which iTunes saves backups here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204215\nApple doesn't make tools to poke at those files and export the data, however.\nThe apps themselves are saved in the iTunes library - so you can move them easily. The data embedded in apps depend on how the developer of that app chose to store them.

I recently got myself a product key and I really wanna bootcamp my mac but I can't find how with only the product key... Please don't tell me I lost €70 on that..?\n\nA: You can download the mediacreationtool.exe which will allow you to download the .iso or create the USB flash drive.\nI believe you want an iso. If you use the mediacreationtool to create a USB flash drive, it will not work on a Mac. You need to burn the iso to a DVD or use Boot Camp Assistant to create the USB.\nOf course you will need to execute the mediacreationtool from a machine booted to Windows. If you do not have such a machine, you can install a temporary evaluation copy of Windows Enterprise 8.1. The iso can be downloaded from here.\nTo be clear. You download the 64 bit Windows Enterprise 8.1 as an iso. You use the iso to install Windows to your Mac. Boot to Windows and download the Media Creation Tool. Run this tool to download a iso of the Home or Pro version of Windows 8.1. This iso should work with your product key. You then erase the installed Enterprise Windows and install the Home or Pro Windows using the Product Key.\n\nNote: For almost all Macs, you want the 64 bit version of windows.\n\n", "Q: Could not create symlink for \"/Users\" I want to create symbolic link for /Users to /home.

I've been curious about this for awhile. I've seen this happen for multiple versions of the iPhone with multiple apps, but to be specific, today with the iPhone 5s, iOS 9.0 and the Galileo map app, I was in a foreign country walking around, and had put my phone on airplane mode to avoid extra data charges. I had expected to use the Galileo app like a digital copy of an ordinary map, which is to say I did not expect it to know my current location. And yet, every time I moved 5m or so, my location was updated in real time. How is this possible? Was the phone getting signals from nearby WiFi, or cell towers, or what?\n\nA: \nIf you have a device with iOS 8.2 or earlier, Airplane Mode will also\n  turn off GPS.\n\nThus with iOS 8.3 and above the GPS stays on while in Airplane Mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204234\nGPS works independently of phone or WiFi signals and is \"receive only\", so keeping it enabled even in Airplane mode doesn't influence other electronical devices nearby.\n\nA: TIP: Also, to avoid huge data charges while abroad, you could just turn of Data Doaming in Settings -> Mobile Data. That way you can still send and receive texts and calls (which usually are way less expensive). \n", "Q: Will signing out of iCloud in browsers wipe my iPhone? I want the information in my apps on my iPhone 5s to be erased since the phone has been lost. \nIf I choose the option \"Sign out of iCloud on all Browsers\", would this help or erase all my data on my iPhone?\n\nA: No. In iCloud, you need to select your lost iPhone 5S and then choose \"Erase Content\". You can also use an iOS device to do the same thing by logging into your iCloud account there and choosing to remove all the content from your iPhone. The phone will be wiped after it connects to the Internet. \nAfter the phone is wiped, you will not be able to view it in iCloud anymore. If you want to retain it in iCloud, you need to \"lock\" it instead. I recommend that your review Apple's article in iCloud's security features so you have a better idea of what will occur. \nSigning out of iCloud in all browsers would make sure no one else is logged into your iCloud account through a browser. \n", "Q: After update to OS X Server 5.0.3 ports 80 and 443 closed The title pretty much sums it up.

As you discovered the only way to enable it is to open the Settings.app and then opening Batteries. If you'd find it faster, you can now search the Settings app by pulling down past the \"top\" of the list in the app.\nIn addition, when your phone hits 20% battery, it will alert you and offer to enable the feature.\n\nA: If you have a jailbroken device, you can activate it in Control Center via this: http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/10/19/how-to-toggle-low-power-mode-via-control-center/\n\nA: You can use a third party app such as iLauncher and create a custom button as a shortcut to call a custom scheme URL that will open the battery settings and option to turn on/off low power mode\nBattery (updated for iOS 9): \nprefs:root=BATTERY_USAGE\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-8-widget-customisations-using-launcher.1782093/\n\nA: In iOS 10, it turns out, you have the option on the lock screen to re-enable the low power mode from the notification you get when the battery is sufficiently charged.\nI made two screenshots to illustrate:\n\nNow when you pull this notification to the left (as you would do to dismiss/clear it), the following will be visible:\n\nSo there you have it, a shortcut has been introduced, although I can't tell when exactly. And that shortcut of course only may have appeared in iOS 10, leaving several generations of devices behind.\nNB: I removed as much of the lock screen background from the screenshots; i.e. they're touched up a bit around the notification message.\n\nA: I think you can turn of most of the individual items affected by the low power mode in settings, such as mail fetch, background app refresh and automatic downloads. I'm not sure but this should have the same effect as the low power switch. \n\nA: Siri can turn off \"Low Power Mode\"\n\"Hey Siri, turn [on/off] Low Power Mode\"\n", "Q: Can you trick Apple Music/iCloud Music Library by labeling music files as audiobooks? I have about 40,000 tracks in my iTunes library.\nAs I understand it, in order to add Apple Music tracks to custom playlists, I have to enable the iCloud Music Library, which I can't do with more than 25,000 tracks in my library.\nI know that I can work around the problem by splitting my library up into two. But I wonder if there's a simpler solution?\nI don't listen to audiobooks very often, and so I'm not using the \"Audiobooks\" media type in iTunes. If I relabel a music file as an audiobook in iTunes, it no longer shows up in the Music track count, but I can play it just like normal from iTunes on my desktop.\nBefore I go culling my whole library for tracks to label as books, though, I wondered if anyone had already tried this, and whether it works? It seems a lot easier than breaking everything into two separate libraries, but I haven't seen it suggested in any of the many threads on this issue.\n\nA: Finally got around to trying it, and it works. Once I'd marked enough files as \"Audiobook\" to get the remaining music files under 25k, Apple synced the remaining files with no problem.\nThis seems like a much easier solution than the \"two libraries\" solution that other people are recommending...although it would make actual audiobooks more of a pain to deal with for people who use audiobooks.\n", "Q: Dual login Windows and OSX on an Apple computer (not dual boot) A couple years ago I was using the business center of an Embassy Suites hotel. They had Apple computers with a dual login screen where I could choose to login to Windows or OSX. This was not a dual boot setup. It was choose at login. I have not been able to find a system that does this.\nDo you know of such a system that makes this possible? Again, this is for a dual login, not a dual boot configuration.\n\nA: I suspect it was a dual boot set up. This can be done via refit and would show a screen like this\nYou then get taken to the Windows or OS X login - but for both of these you can make this auto login so the process does not stop here and you go in as a user.

The stores are extremely busy and I'm seeing higher error rates than normal for updates, downloads and such.\nI would say, give it 24 hours after you set up the family sharing for things to get sorted out before contacting Apple.\nYou should also get an email notification from Apple when each person you invited accepts the sharing of apps portion of the plan. They have to opt in to share so everyone should get emails when people join and leave the party, so to speak.\nIf you want to reach out to Apple - use the iTunes Store Support team as they handle accounts, purchases, billing and such.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/support/itunes/\n", "Q: Automating Terminal Commands with AppleScript I have an Arduino-based device (www.picobrew.com) and needs firmware updating.  The company wrote a little app to do it for Windows users, but us OS X users are out in the cold.

One time I disconnected the Apple Watch charger and the magnetic attachment landed right next to an external hard drive.  Since the charger uses magnetic field to charge the Apple Watch, will placing it a few inches or right next to an external hard drive on the desk cause possible data loss to the hard drive?  Or what if it is a wallet with credit cards in it.  There are some possible scenarios: \n\n\n*\n\n*a few inches next to it\n\n*right next to it\n\n*while charging, especially if it is 8 or 10 hours\n\n*when just within the few seconds disconnected from the Apple Watch\n\n*when not attached to the Apple Watch\n\n\nA: The short answer is no, you aren't going do any damage with a wireless charger being near any magnetically sensitive devices.\nLet's tackle each one of the points you brought up.\n\n\n*\n\n*Inductive charging is only effective up to a maximum of  4cm (about an inch and a half).  Anything past that and the magnetic field is simply too weak.\n\n*It would need to be \"right on top of it\" to be close enough, but that point is moot.  See #5 below.\n\n*Time is irrelevant when it's out of range.  Again, it would have to be on top, but it's a moot point.\n\n*Same as #3\n\n*When your wireless charger is not attached to the Apple Watch, it's not transmitting an the electromagnetic field used for charging.    Within the base station is a \"communications and control\" unit that regulates how much power to use to create the magnetic field.  When a device is not in range, it will output very nominal power.  Once a device comes within range the \"comm and control\" unit will negotiate how much power to output to charge the device.\nGranted, this is a very simplistic description of the charging process, but the key concept is there. \nBottom line is that when not connected, the magnetic field is so low that you would have have remove all of your drive's enclosure, electrical shielding, and casing of the drive itself to actually affect the magnetized platters.  With the watch charging, you would have to somehow keep the base station watch and drive in direct contact with each other which is next to impossible due to physical constraints.  \nIf you notice, your watch must be in direct contact with the charging station for it to charge.  You can be assured that the electromagnetic field being generated is going to be very weak past the physical dimensions of the watch.\nMore info:  Qi Wireless Charging\n\nBackstory...I came upon this info while researching how to build my own Qi wireless charger under a glass desk.  I have a frosted white glass desk which if I put the transmitter coils in a particular area, you wouldn't be able to see that a charger was in fact part of the desk. All you would have to do is place your phone on the desk in the right spot and it would start charging.   Unfortunately, I couldn't make it work because the glass desk, being 5mm was too thick to use Qi (same used in the Apple Watch).  I would need a resonant charger to get the distance, but it was incompatible with my phone.\n", "Q: Terminal not responding to \"which\", \"type\", etc. commands I tried to look for the full path of the TextEdit app in the terminal using the command which and whereis but the terminal doesn't respond. it just skips to the next line like there was no command:\nLast login: Thu Sep 17 21:30:51 on ttys000\nTomass-MacBook-Pro:~ SOLANOT$ which textedit\nTomass-MacBook-Pro:~ SOLANOT$ \n\nThis also happens with type and whereis but not with commands such as ls or cd.

On iOS, your iCloud login is in Settings / iCloud and your iTunes login is under Settings / iTunes Store and Apps. On OS X, your iTunes login is in iTunes under the Store menu, and iCloud is under System Preferences / iCloud.\nNote that the iCloud login is tied to your iCloud account, your icloud.com/me.com/mac.com email address, and other services. If you are actively using that email address, you may not be able to switch to the Apple ID you use in iTunes.\nApple does not currently provide a way to merge Apple IDs.\n\nA: As mentioned bellow, however you will have some trouble updating app as this is not a expected behavior.\nE.g sometimes you will have to connect to the another appleID un order to complete an update\nalso obviously for redownload past purchase you will have to connect on the correct AppleID also when disconnect , you automatically get disconnect from Apple Music.\n", "Q: \"Computer admin\" vs active account? So someone stole my mac and I just got a new used one and am setting it up and I can't figure out how to get it back to the way I used to have it.\nThe way it was before, I was a user with no password-- I didn't have to login when the mac started. But whenever I wanted to make significant changes, like installations or settings adjustments, I would have to give credentials.\nHow do I get back to that? Is it simply a matter of having a normal account and an admin account, and only using the normal account for day-to-day things? I never deliberately made two separate accounts on the previous computer.\n\nA: The best way to solve this is to have one user who is an Admin and has a password.\nIn System Preferences navigate to Users & Groups. \n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you only have one active user.\n\n*Ensure that user has a password.\n\n\n\nNote: You might need to click the Lock button to make changes.\n\n\nThen click Back in System Preferences. Navigate to Security & Privacy. Click the Lock button to make changes. Uncheck all three checkboxes:\n\nNow you will be able to turn on the computer without logging in.

I mean it would be a gargantuan task to re-implement all the unix commands and I guess it somehow uses the built-in terminal under the covers to run the actual commands but how?\n\nA: Both applications: built-in Apple Terminal and iTerm2 are only terminal emulators. They do not implement any commands, they just take care of the display.\nWhen you open either a Terminal or an iTerm2 window, it automatically runs a shell (like bash or ksh). This is the program that interprets most of the commands that you know as CLI. When you type a command into a shell, it first tries to match it with its internal set of commands and interprets it accordingly. If a command is not found, the shell will try to find a program which name matches the command. This is what you might perceive aa \"unix commands\", however they are just standalone programs.\nFor example: If you run a Terminal on a Mac, it runs bash shell by default. Then if you type date, the shell will find it is not an internal shell command, so it will search the disk (it will search only in places defined in a so called \"PATH environment variable\") and it will most likely find a program in the following place /bin/date. The shell will execute this program. The Terminal will then print the standard output of the date command in its window.\niTerm2 does not use Terminal in the background, but it will run the same shell. So the flow is: iTerm2 runs bash (by default), bash then executes a date command and date command will send its output to the iTerm2 which will display the characters for the user.\n", "Q: Outlook crashes after adding second account after upgrading to iOS 9 on iPhone 6 Does any body know any solutions to solve the problem of Outlook for iOS crashes after adding second email account on it when the iPhone 6 was upgraded to iOS9?\n\nA: The only reliable way I had to resolve this issue was to delete the application and then reinstall it from the App store.\nTo do this, on the screen with the Outlook app, press and hold the icon until it starts shaking, then click the 'x' in the top left hand corner.

I bought it directly from Apple.\nThe technician from Hughesnet, which is satellite internet, finished installing the equipment (satellite dish, modem, etc.) earlier today. A tech support rep promised me speeds of at least 9 mbps, with the max being 15. Yet, I'm never able to get more than 7 or 8, nothing close to the already-slow 15 expected or even the 9 that the tech support representative promised.\nMy problem is that regular webpages (such as Apple, Wikipedia, MLB) all load reasonably quickly, yet I am never able to download iOS 9. After a few minutes, iTunes on my MacBook Pro (mid-2009, running OS X 10.10.5 \"Yosemite\") will have about \"1024.0 KB\" downloaded, then the request will time out. The update doesn't seem to be downloading on my iPhone 5S, either, but it downloaded part way on a relative's Wi-Fi network earlier this week.\nI've spent literally hours on the phone with Hughesnet's technical support and we were finally able to prove that the modem is working properly and that the problem must be the router.\nThe Airport Time Capsule has been updated to the latest software. Both the router and the modem have been power cycled multiple times.\nIs there something more that I can do to troubleshoot my Airport Time Capsule? Could this just be a problem with Apple's software update servers?\nUpdate:\nI just ran another speed test using the Ookla Speedtest app and it's now showing a 20 mbps download speed, but the iOS 9 update still won't install.\n\n\nA: \nIs there something more that I can do to troubleshoot my Airport Time Capsule? \n\nYour OOKLA speed tests indicate that your AirPort is working correctly.\n\nCould this just be a problem with Apple's software update servers?\n\nYes.\n\nA: The best way to download iOS 9 is download though you computer.  Connect your iPhone to your computer, open up iTunes (make sure you have the last version of iTunes), backup your iPhone and install iOS 9.  \n\nA: That has nothing to do with your connection. Since iOS 9 hit the market, iOS/app update are really slow, no matter of your connection speed.\nThere is solution, that I just googled.

At the latest unveiling by Apple and mentioned in this post, they announced a new feature on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus: you can have 'Hey Siri' enabled always rather than just when plugged into a power source.  After downloading iOS 9 to my iPhone 6, I optimistically checked to see whether this feature was present in the settings, but to no avail - 'Hey Siri' is still restricted to when the device is plugged into a power source.  Yet, surely this is a software-related matter rather than anything to do with the hardware.  Why is the ability to have 'Hey Siri' enabled when not plugged into a power source restricted to the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus? Has Apple made any explanation of this, or is there some other evidence which accounts for this?\n\nA: It's just a matter of hardware. The M9 coprocessor in the iPhone 6s is efficient enough to keep the microphone listening all the time without murdering the battery, unlike the chips in older devices.\nFrom the article your question links to:\n\nWith iPhone 6s, the device is constantly monitoring audio input in the background, a process made possible by the highly efficient M9 motion coprocessor embedded in Apple's new A9 system-on-chip.\n\n\nA: The best you can do is to use an external battery pack and then it will work even on the six :)\nIn addition I actually like the way it works now on an iPhone 6, because when I go to bed I just say 'hey Siri good night' and I can verify that my phone is plugged in if Siri replies\n\nA: Strange..

I love Notes and how iCloud helps me work on the go (with my iPhone) as well as on my computer seamlessly.\nBut every so often, I wish I could back them all up locally in a few steps, ideally as files and with as little tampering with the system as possible.\nIs this doable?\n\n\nA: I realized I had the answer at my fingertips, si I'll submit an answer to my own question.\nAn application I use for file transfers, but sometimes overlook, called iMazing, offers native Notes conversion and backup.\nThere might be other apps that do this, but this is what I did and how I solved the issue in less than 30 seconds.\n1-Link the iPhone with the Notes to your computer running iMazing\n2-Launch iMazing\n\n3-Select the iPhone in the list of devices, and click on the \"Notes\" shortcut in the left-side panel\n\n4-A list of notes will show up. In the Finder, create a folder to receive the backed-up notes, then go back to iMazing, and Select them all [cmd+a]\n\n5-Drag and drop them onto the Finder's folder previously created\nThe notes will all be converted to .txt and saved as a local file.\nIt's a great app, what really sucks about it is that you have to pay for it but other than that it does the task of exporting Notes quite well.\n\nBefore that, I used to use IExplorer, which worked well too.\nI don't recommend using the app \"Notes Explorer\", unfortunately, it's a free program, so I would have loved for it to be my first answer, but when I tried it it exported Notes in a sort of HTML format with large text blocks and  code snippets everywhere.\nThere are other apps that claim to do this, at least one other which is called Syncios, which I haven't tried. If you know one that's good, feel free to recommend it in the comments section.\nAlso, iOS 9 now supports images in Notes, so this answer might be edited depending on what solution will work the best with this new format.\n", "Q: Issue while installing Windows 10 on an early 2011 MacBook Pro I try to install a bootcamp with :\n\n*\n\n*OSX 10.11 El Capitan\n\n*Windows 10 Pro (from Dreamspark system, its a license for students)\n\nI have succeeded in installing the Windows 10 .iso file on my USB stick.  I had to edit the plist file of the Boot Camp Assistant (the last version 6.0). I have succeeded in partitioning my SSD in two parts.\nNow I boot on the USB stick by pushing ALT when booting. The install process asks me to enter the license key. I precise that the installation process looks like the old one, the Windows 7's one. After the license has been entered, I have an error :\n\ntabtip.exe - Application error\nThe exception unknown software exception (some hexadecimal) occurred in the program at location (some hexadecimal)\nClick on OK to terminate the program\n\nAfter clicking OK, I can just cancel the installation.\nI have tried to copy again Windows 10 on the USB stick. It doesn't change anything.\nI have also tried to avoid entering my license key by using the \"next\" button of the window, but the error occurs just after.\nI have tried to install Windows 8.1, it doesn't change anything.\n\nA: don't try to force boot using EFI if you have MBP early 2011, I have and it succeeded but without sound. the only way to fix the sound problem is to re install it in BIOS boot not EFI\n\nA: *\n\n*Usually, if you had to edit the plist file, then you can not install\nusing a USB.\n\n*You may be able to do a EFI/GPT install, but you have a FAR BETTER\nCHANCE of succeeding with a BIOS/MBR install.\n\n*According to Apple, your model does not support Windows 10. Well, my\nmodel does not support Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10 in 64 bit mode and\nthis has not stopped me yet. They all run just fine. You can try\nusing the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Boot Camp Support\nSoftware (BCSS) for your model. An alternative would be to use the 64\nbit Windows 7 BCSS as specified at Install Windows 7 and earlier on\nyour Mac using Boot Camp. The would be Boot Camp Support\nSoftware 5.1.5621.\n\n\nVirtual Box is a small sized application that can be used to verify your Windows iso is installable. Your probably is, so this step is not necessary. However, Virtual Box and be used as a substitute  for the Boot Camp Assistant. In other words, you can use VirtualBox to setup a dual boot. There are certain commands (convert, format, bootsect, bootrec, etc...) that do not exist under OS X. You can boot your Windows 10 iso using VirtualBox and execute these commands on disk images and physical partitions. This allows you to copy the files from the iso to a physical partition and boot from that instead of a DVD or USB flash drive. You never create or boot a Windows 10 virtual machine.\nOne never really appreciates what effort and time the Boot Camp Assistant application saves you until you try installing Windows without it. The procedure for installing on a machine with an internal SDD and internal HHD is given here. \n\nOthers have posted problems with the SSD driver. Basically, they say the problem is with the Digital Signature. You may have to manually fix this problem. If the problem occurs, Let me know.\n\n\nA: That probably won't be the only hurdle you'll have to take. I had Windows 7 running nice and smoothly for over 3 years on my Late 2011 MacBook Pro. I've literally never seen Windows run so smooth on a machine even after many years.\nThen, ignoring the lack of support for Windows 10 for my model, I stubbornly upgraded to Windows 10 via Windows Update. During the upgrade I found out that the Bluetooth driver was incompatible. So I had to disable that in order to continue the upgrade (I wasn't using it much anyways, I figured).\nBesides that I got frequent BSOD's, most of the time a few minutes after startup. I tried to upgrade all sorts of drivers, update / downgrade Bootcamp to a suitable version. I still get the blue screens. \nMy advice would be to either just install Windows 7 or wait till someone manages to succesfully install Windows 10 on a 2011 model (I haven't seen anyone on the net yet) and follow what they did. I'm doing the latter. I rarely give up on stuff like this, but I have for now.\nTo comment on the issue at hand: since tabtip.exe is a driver for tablet support and you probably won't need it I would try to remove that driver from the installation following the assumption that what isn't installed can't cause any problems. However I'm not sure if the installation depends on that driver being present. It may very well throw an error because the driver is missing. But that is what I would try in this situation.\n[Insert accountability disclaimer]\n\nOh, and if you do remove the driver from the install, save it to another location so you can restore it if needed or it doesn't work.\nEDIT:\nYou could ofcourse also try a Windows 7 / 8.1 install first and try to upgrade for free from there on via Windows Update. You'll have to be quick though the free upgrade only lasts for a few more days I believe. \n", "Q: How did TechCrunch get in my notifications center?

Or would I just have to do this manually?\nHopefully that makes sense, and any kind of help would be awesome!\nThanks\n\nA: You could use an AppleScript to copy the music to a specific folder. iTunes and the Finder both support AppleScript.\nUse the included Script Editor.app in OS X to create your script. A starting point for your script is below:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n\n    -- Get the recent purchases smart playlist\n    set myPlaylistFiles to file tracks of playlist \"Recent Purchases\"\n\n    -- With every local song/track\n    repeat with i from 1 to number of items in myPlaylistFiles\n\n        set localTrack to item i of myPlaylistFiles\n\n        set myPathToTrack to location of localTrack\n\n        -- Add copy to folder code here…        \n\n    end repeat\n\nend tell\n\nFeel free to ask more questions about finishing this AppleScript.\n", "Q: Choose providers in ios 9 spotlight suggested news I wonder where I can choose/ change the news sources that spotlight uses in the new iOS 9...!\nI live in Switzerland and don't have the News App...\ni've never visited most of the sites before\n\nA: I think the news section in spotlight search is linked to your iOS news app, try changing sources there to see if it has any effects.

But I open the text, the name appears at the top, just when initial text notification comes through \n\nA: Hard to say what your country is but we had a similar issue in mine. The cause was that number format inside the country is different from the international format that most operators use when sending messages or doing calls. For example, in the country we have 8-926-1234567 and international number is +7-926-1234567. In some old iOS versions iPhone could not recognize these numbers as the same.\nThe solution was simple: always use international number for all contacts.

Briefly summarizing, I have defined a constant IP they will use to connect themselves to the network. Then, the shared folders have been set up: on Mac OS, using the Preferences > Sharing board and on Windows through the Properties > Sharing > Advanced Sharing menu. All works fine when I request a connection from the Macbook to the PC: I use Finder > Connect to a Server, filling the blank line with smb://IP_OF_THE_PC and then inserting the username and the password of the account that is sharing these data. On the contrary, doing the inverse procedure, I mean requesting a connection from the PC to the Macbook - launching the command \\\\IP_OF_THE_MAC from the Start menu, the configuration seems to not work. Sincerely, I am a bit surprised because the same configuration was fine when I was running Mavericks 10.9 and so I suppose that all this is due to some modification introduced by Yosemite itself. In the end, can someone suggest me other parameters I should check and/or edit to allow the right functioning of all this?\n\nA: Releasing Mac OS X Yosemite, Apple has updated the SMB protocol to version 3, as documented here. Windows XP, on his side, works almost certainly with the SMB 1 protocol, because the upgrade to version 2 has been done on Windows Vista, as mentioned here. The backward compatibility allows SMB 3 to connect to previous versions, but not viceversa.\nThis issue can be solved using Samba, a free and open source implementation of the SMB protocol that assures full compatibility between different operative systems.\nIt is possible to install and manage Samba on Mac OS installing SMBUp.\n\nA: Recently I came across this problem whilst trying to migrate an old Windows XP machine to a virtual machine under macOS 10.11 VMWare Fusion 8.  The Windows machine \"pushes\" data to the Mac server using SMB.\nA bit of searching found this Q&A, but a little more found that this is actually caused by the default authentication level required by macOS changing along with the SMB version.\nThere is no need to install any additional software, this can be fixed by creating a property list file in /Library/Preferences/ called com.apple.GSS.NTLM.plist.\nThe contents of the file should be:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> \n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \n\"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"> \n<plist version=\"1.0\"> \n  <dict> \n    <key>NTLMv1</key>\n    <true/> \n    <key>NTLMv2</key>\n    <true/> \n  </dict> \n</plist>\n\nNote, this is allowing SMB 1 (and 2) authentication on your Mac so you are effectively reducing the security of your computer by doing this.\nYou may have to Stop and Start Sharing for this preference to take effect.\nThe credit for this fix goes to \"Allan\", see the uk.comp.sys.mac newsgroup post \"ntlmv1 authentication on Yosemite desktop share\" from October 2014.\n", "Q: How do I view 2 apps as a multitasking Split View on an iPad Air 2 running iOS 9?

Hence reinstalling OS, Apps and the like are often the solution rather than hunting down the subtle error.\nWith that in mind what Disk Utility is telling you is, \"I can't fix that.\" And in situations like that it is time to turn to third party disk utilities. I've been using Disk Warrior since the OS9 days (possibly earlier...) and have found few issues it will not fix. That is how I would proceed. If you have other third party disk utilities (Drive Genius, TechTool pro, etc.) by all means use one of those.

Is there another way to achieve my target?\nOS X 10.10 with iOS 8.4\nThank you!\n\nA: Share your internet connection via WiFi\nThis worked for me in a similar situation. Shamelessly copied from apple support site, link below. \nYou can share your Internet connection with other users on your local network.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Sharing preferences if it isn’t already open (choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Sharing).\n\n*Select the Internet Sharing checkbox.\n\n*Click the “Share your connection from” pop-up menu, then choose the Internet connection you want to share. For example, if you’re connected to the Internet over Ethernet, choose Ethernet.\n\n*Select how you want to share your Internet connection in the “To computers using” list. For example, if you want to share your Internet connection over Wi-Fi, select Wi-Fi.\n\n*If you share your Internet connection using Wi-Fi, deselect the Internet Sharing checkbox, click Wi-Fi Options, give your network a name and password, then select the Internet Sharing checkbox again.\nIf your Internet connection and your local network use the same port (Ethernet, for example), investigate possible side effects before you turn on Internet sharing. In some cases, sharing your Internet connection disrupts the network. If you use a cable modem, for example, you might unintentionally affect the network settings of other ISP customers, and your ISP might terminate your service.\n[https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18704?locale=en_US](support.apple.com share internet connection)\n", "Q: python2.7 cannot be opened because of a problem Running into an odd issue when my system starts up:\n\nI have not been able to track the point of failure down yet.

Like this:\n\n\nA: The MacBook Air will require a Dual-link DVI output using Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter to connect to the two monitors (so the monitors need DVI cables/connectors) and as long as the combined resolution of the displays is no more than 2500 x 1600 then it will work as that is the max resolution of an external display with this Mac. \nIf the combined Max resolution of these displays is higher than 2500 x 1600 it may well support both but you won't get the maximum resolution out of the displays.\n", "Q: My email is gone and my daughters is there instead My daughter used my phone for a day and now her email address is on my phone and mine has vanished.

Why is it that all the usb-c hubs are passthrough single usb ports instead of a USB Type-C multiple port hub?\n\nA: It's a question that is very unpopular.  You're right, but you're not supposed to say it.\nYes, the hub someone wrote about has two USB-C ports out of it, but they will be compromised.\nWhat the problems is - how the USB-C lines within a cable are used is determined at plug-in time, depending on what you plug in downstream of the port.  For example, you can't have full speed USB 3.1 and full video at the same time.  So the USB-C makes a choice for you.  If you plug in both a high-res monitior and USB 3, then you can't have both at once.\nSo it will be interesting to see how the various hub supplies will handle this problem.\nPeople think that a hub will be much like a USB 3.1 hub, where the function of USB doesn't change when you plug things into it.\nBut if you plug a high-res monitor into a USB-C hub, your USB regular data will suddenly drop down in speed to what two interior wires can handle, instead of four.  The bandwidth just isn't there.  Today's USB-C is USB-C on training wheels.\n", "Q: Messages on iPhone, iPad and Macbook.

Messages to him and from him only show up on the iPhone and Macbook but don't show up on my iPad.\nDid I do something weird or what can it be?\nThanks, Thomas\n\nA: Messages syncing can be finicky. Go to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive and verify that your iPad is configured to use all the same addresses that your iPhone and Mac are using. \nIt is also helpful to make certain that all devices have the same \"Start new conversations from\" setting. I recommend setting them to start from your phone number, as that's where other are likely to message you. Otherwise you end up with multiple conversation threads with the same person.\n", "Q: How to prevent MacBook Pro from sleeping with turned off external display?

I have a lot of old assets (html and image files) I need to optimise for mobile devices. The existing assets were created for desktop and did not have mobile device in mind.\nI am planning to make the following changes:\n1) In front end, if it is running on a desktop device, its content will be loaded form the existing url (e.g. static.example.com/document1/index.html). But if the website is loaded from an  iphone6, it will switch to static.example.com/document1_iphone6/index.html\n2) document1_iphone6 is basically a duplicate of document1. All the image assets will be resized to fit 750x1334\nIs there any problem/flaw with this plan? \n\nA: I think you are on the right track of optimizing images for mobile devices, but I think that the way you are going about it won't scale very well. If you just target iPhones with resized images, you're going to be supporting 5 different sizes, iPhone 6+, iPhone 6, iPhone 5/5S, iPhone 4/4S, plus the original, which isn't that bad. \nBut what if you want to support Android phones at the same level, having an image for every device made? You're going to end up with dozens of different image sizes. \nAndroid screen resoultions\nHere is another link with a larger list of device sizes.\nmydevice.io common smartphone sizes\n\nNot only will you have dozens of different devices, but your naming scheme won't work that well, as some resolutions are used for multiple displays, leaving you with duplicates of images. \nA better way to optimize for mobile is to target screen resolutions instead of devices. For example, you could target a set of resolutions like \n\nxxxhdpi: 1280x1920 px\n  xxhdpi: 960x1600 px\n  xhdpi: 640x960 px\n  hdpi: 480x800 px\n  mdpi: 320x480 px\n  ldpi: 240x320 px\n\nWith this method, you can support all mobile devices with just 6 different sizes, plus, when a new device is launched, you won't need to resize every image on your site for the new device. \nThis is all assuming you are just talking about resizing your image assets. If you are going to be redoing your layout for every device, you would be much, much better creating a responsive site that scales for mobile devices.\n", "Q: When buying used macbook pro 2010 do I need the cd? It seems to me that I shouldn't need the boot cds when buying a used macbook pro if it is upgraded to Yosemite, is this correct? \n\nA: Yep, as long as it's running Mac OS X 10.7 \"Lion\" or later, that MacBook Pro won't require or even be able to make any use of the boot CDs. The reason being that Lion added the built-in Recovery partition, and many features in Recovery were previously only available on the boot disks.\n", "Q: How to delete iOS 9 install file?

All the other apple devices worked just fine. Very frustrating. There's a thread on one of the support forums with hundreds of replies from folks with similar issues but no real solutions. We replaced the router as well but that did not fix it. After the phone was replaced with same model it went away so I think it may have been a hardware issue.

I use the computer in closed-lid mode and connected to a monitor. Often, but not always, when I wake the computer from sleep, I have to repeatedly tap keys on the keyboard before the keyboard starts responding.

Not even the caps lock key on the keyboard works to illuminate the caps lock light.\n\n*I rapidly press random keys (or a single key) on the keyboard, and the keyboard begins to respond after a while.\n\n\nThe USB keyboard is connected with a powered USB hub between the keyboard and the computer. Using a different hub does not solve the problem. The keyboard does still show up under USB devices in System Information when it is not responding.\nIs there a solution to this annoyance?\nUPDATE: When the keyboard is not responding, I can make the caps lock light on the keyboard illuminate by pressing the caps lock button with the mouse in the OS X keyboard viewer. Doing so does not restore the keyboard to a responsive state though. I still have to repeatedly tap keys before the keyboard starts responding.\nUPDATE: The problem remains under OS X 10.11.6.\n\nA: Since it’s intermittent, I would suspect a slow disk or just a lot of CPU and the bus is failing.

I often have a good 150 to 200 tabs open in Safari at all times because this is where I like to keep all my current work.\nObviously, all open tabs are never displayed at the same time when there are so many... \nI am wondering if a list of all currently open tabs is available in Safari.\n\n\nA: Here is an AppleScript that will get the name of all Tabs in all Safari windows and show them in an unsaved TextEdit document.\nYou can save this as a plain script and access it from the Script menu on the Menu bar if you enable it in Script Editor's Preferences.

The new font San Francisco, introduced in El Capitan throughout OS X's Finder and contextual menus, is a beautiful font and proves that once again, Apple is on top of their game when it comes to defining the standards of UI and typography.\n\nBut when I try to find San Francisco in TextEdit or Keynote, it's not there.\n\nThe apps I use, whether Apple apps (Pages, Numbers, TextEdit...) or third-party apps (InDesign, Word...) do not display San Francisco as an option in their font menus.\nHere's another example, from Apple's very own Keynote (whose default font is still Helvetica) - no San Francisco there either:\n\nObviously, this font is there, somewhere in the system, since it's used almost everywhere! And Apple computers are sold with lots of fonts pre-installed in their System Folder, so it seems like a mistake to me, that this one in particular would be unavailable.\nSo, how could I \"unlock\" it, or make it usable in other applications?\nNOTE: This question was first assuming - wrongly - that San Francisco was made available in Yosemite, which was a mistake. Turns out I still can't find and use it in El Capitan, so I just edited it to say \"El Capitan\" instead, and add a few images, but some comments might seem irrelevant.\n\nA: You can download it from here: https://developer.apple.com/fonts/\nBut there is this note in the license agreement:\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: THE APPLE SAN FRANCISCO FONT IS TO BE USED SOLELY FOR CREATING MOCK-UPS OF USER INTERFACES TO BE USED IN SOFTWARE PRODUCTS RUNNING ON APPLE’S iOS OR OS X OPERATING SYSTEMS, AS APPLICABLE.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Air microphone volume extremely low Everytime I try to make call with Skype or Google Hangouts from my MacBook Air, the embedded internal microphone volume is too low. I am sure it is working, because when I shout loudly enough, the people on the other side of call can hear me, but only really quietly.\nI have Macbook Air 13'' late 2010, right now running OS X Yosemite 10.10.5, but I had this problem since the very beginning.\nI have played with volume and also input volume levels in Settings → Sound, volume is on maximum level, but still unusable. I have Googled for the problem and tried several workarounds, none seems to be addressing my issue/working for me.\n\nA: After closely looking on microphone input on the left side of my MacBook Air, I have found that the little holes are blocked with dust or something like that.\nSo I took the needle and removed the dust from microphone holes, and it's now working well!\nNote: I know this would seem like obvious solution, but the holes are so little you cannot see anything in them unless you look really closely (or, more probably, use magnifier).\n", "Q: How can I change the orientation of a picture in the printer menu? In the printer menu I can change the orientation, but that only rotates the paper not the image on the paper. How can I rotate the image itself?\nI already tried rotating the image itself, but that did not help. It still wants to print the image with the wrong orientation.\n\n\n\nA: Switch off Auto Rotate / Automatisch drehen\nYou may need to then adjust the Scale to fit the page better - it may depend on whether the entire actual page content is visible.\n", "Q: How to recover lost Mail content after Yosemite update?

I've bought a used MacBook Air (Mid 2013) running Yosemite and I'd like to restore every setting to defaults, as in, start over with a fresh clean OS.\nWhat are the things I have to run to make sure the system is good conditions before performing a reinstall?\nShould I reset NVRAM and SMC to set stuff like volume and mouse speed to default, or a OS reinstall via recovery will take care of that?\nThanks!\n\nA: Erasing a hard drive with Recovery HD (or better - a flash drive) will remove everything. You don't need to do a NVRAM/SMC reset (you can if you'd like)\n", "Q: Will there be issues if I install RAM modules with different sizes in a Mac mini? I have a Mac mini late 2012 with 4 GB (2 x 2 GB) RAM. I bought another 8 GB RAM module and installed it in the Mac. Should I leave the 8 GB module alone or should I install one of the two 2 GB modules in the vacant RAM slot?\nWill there be any issue if there are different RAM modules in the slots (8 GB + 2 GB)?\n\nA: If the two different sized RAM modules have the same specifications (e.g. latency), you shouldn't have any issues.\nThe advantages - more memory - outweigh the disadvantages of different sized modules - no interleaving memory.\n\nA: I have an early 2011 MacBook Pro, formerly with 4GB of RAM. A few months ago, I bought an 8GB stick and made the exact setup you're describing. With the exception of one issue that lasted a few minutes one day (and that I have no proof was even caused by the RAM setup), it's been working perfectly ever since I did the upgrade.\nSo yeah, you should be fine. Source: My own experience doing exactly the same thing.\n", "Q: iPhone 5c software update just loads? I have an iPhone 5c and works great. The issue is I try to update my iPhone but it will stay at the loading part for a long time and wont load. How do I fix this problem?\n\nA: I had this same problem a few days ago. It kept me on the phone with tech support with my internet service for 2 hours, It's a problem with Apple's servers. My advice would be to restart your iPhone frequently and keep trying to update it. Eventually, it work, just keep trying because iOS 9 is worth the extra effort.\n", "Q: battery capacity indicator button not working i have this button (battery capacity indicator) in my macbook pro 2011 series that shows battery capacity, but when i press it nothing happens.\ncan i know if it is plugged in or not via a terminal command?\ne.g.: ubuntu have 'lspci' command to know the plugged in devices\nor how can i know if it is plugged via hardware disassembly ?\nEdit:\nhere is how the button look like, its on the left of the macbook\n\nThanks\n\nA: Your indicator light seems broken and is pretty much hardwired. Did it ever see any moisture? Replacing it is a relatively difficult procedure, as seen in this video. You will find more guides on iFixit (e.g. this one) explaining how to get to the Battery Indicator Light. But I don't know where you could get a new one if yours is broken.\nIf you are looking for a terminal command to get your current power status, use pmset. pmset -g batt will tell your the current power source and remaining battery capacity:\n$ pmset -g batt\n\nNow drawing from 'AC Power'\n -InternalBattery-0 99%; charged; 0:00 remaining \n\n\nA: I would personally recommend a SMC reset.\nThe SMC (System Management Controller) is involved in controlling peripherals such as LEDs, fans, touch pads, keyboards etc, and resetting it can often solve many related problems.\nTo reset the SMC, reboot the MacBook, and when the apple chime noise sounds and the screen is at blank white state. Press and hold the buttons Shift, Control and Option, release these 3 buttons simultaneously after a few seconds to successfully reset the SMC.\nFor More information: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reset-macs-smc-pram/\nOf course there is always the possibility that this is a hardware problem. If this is the case, then (according to this blog) this small black cable has either come loose or is damaged; a problem which can be rectified by the nearest apple store, and they will likely do it for free.\n\nHope this has helped, and interested to know if the SMC reset worked out.\n\nA: I once had a MacBook Pro whose battery capacity indicator button was not working very well. I had to press the button quite hard to get any indication from the LEDs. Have you tried pressing the button hard, maybe using a fingernail to help?\nWith mine, if I pressed it at the right angle, and pressed quite deeply, it would sometimes work.\n(I wish the current model MacBook Pro still had that indicator, it's very useful to know the battery charge without opening the computer.)\n\nA: Every battery in a MacBook has a battery processor, which, from time to time, should be recalibrated. Like this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Fully charge your Mac\n\n*Use it until the battery dies \n\n*Once dead, wait at least 5 hours, no less, then plug it in and charge it to 100%, without using it.\n\n\nThe battery percentage reading on your Mac should now be more accurate.\nIf this doesn't fix it, I'd say that the battery indicator part has gone out. I'd go to iFixit.com for a repair guide and check eBay for parts.\n", "Q: Auto-updating Homebrew i'm currently using the Homebrew package manager and my question is: is possibile to write a bash's script in order to execute brew update and eventually brew upgrade whenever opening a shell for the first time? I'm using iTerm at the moment. \n\nA: Homebrew has an autoupdate subcommand. So you can run:\nbrew autoupdate start\n\nTo automatically run brew update every 24 hours. The docs linked above outline a number of configuration options. Because you'd like to also run brew upgrade, you can run:\nbrew autoupdate start --upgrade\n\nUnder the hood brew autoupdate is using launchd.\n\nA: This was easily done with scripts and now the built-in autoupdate mechanism handles this elegantly. See Tate’s excellent answer for details\n\nIf the automatic update and upgrade aren’t working, here is another way for older versions.\nFor efficiency (and cool factor), I would use a tool like Lingon to launch this script periodically using launchctl/launchd instead of each time you start a shell. On my MacBook, it takes 3 seconds to update the second time (no work done, DNS cache set, etc...) and it take 10 second to run the first time (no work done) or 15+ seconds if a package needs to be downloaded or compiled.\nPerhaps once a day or once an hour - running in the background would be sufficient given those times to execute?\nYou could make a simple script /usr/local/bin/brewup that calls brew in turn and logs the results to the system log. If you don’t like chasing logs in the centralized log store, “teeing” them to a text file works well, too.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nbrew=/usr/local/bin/brew\nlogger=/usr/bin/logger\n\n$brew update 2>&1  | $logger -t brewup.update\n$brew upgrade 2>&1 | $logger -t brewup.upgrade\n$brew cleanup 2>&1 | $logger -t brewup.cleanup\n\nI just call the brewup when I'm about to go make tea or when I get started and let it run in the background.\nbrewup &\n\n\nA: I prefer to update Homebrew on startup. I have a script Update Homebrew.sh in ~/Library/Scripts:\n#!/usr/local/bin/bash\n    \nbrew update\nbrew upgrade\nbrew cleanup -s\n\nDon't forget to make the script executable using chmod u+x.\nThe script is launched on startup using launchd. For that, I have Update Homebrew.plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>Update Homebrew</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>/Users/[home]/Library/Scripts/Update Homebrew.sh</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n        <true/>\n    </dict>\n</plist>\n\nWhere [home] is the name of your home folder. (You can't use the tilde in this file.)\n\nA: You might want to ask yourself: \"Do I really want to auto-update applications, which the applications that I build myself depend upon?\"\nBrew team turned down this feature request to facilitate early updates.\nMy interpretation of their reasoning: \"The risk of malicious code slipping through the opensource auditing process weighs more than the incidental need for a speedy update.\"\nIf this is your line of reasoning, you like to be in control of software updates, and you care a lot about homebrew packages being up-to-date, you are probably better off adding a line to the bottom of .bashrc (or the rc file of your favorite shell) asking:\nbrew outdated\n\nThis will confront you, in every new terminal, with the outdated packages.\nWhen your annoyance reaches the limit (you feel ready to update), you'll be happy to do the necessary.\n\nA: There is a tool called homebrew-autoupdate which will do this for you. It can automatically run brew update in the background every 24 hours (configurable) to ensure that you always have fresh homebrew data when you go to install/upgrade packages.\nTo install it run brew tap domt4/autoupdate and brew autoupdate --start 43200 to configure it to autoupdate every 12 hours (43200 seconds).\nEDIT: This is now integrated into Homebrew, see https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-autoupdate.\n\nA: You can use cron to simplify this.\nFind your brew installation location with which brew.\nMine was in the default location:\n\n/usr/local/bin/brew\n\nUsing crontab -e add this line to the editor (update with your brew location):\n0 9 * * * /usr/local/bin/brew update && /usr/local/bin/brew upgrade && /usr/local/bin/brew cleanup\nThe above will update brew, upgrade formulae and casks, and then clean up - every morning at 9am.\n", "Q: Privacy fail? Spotlight shows the Safari pages read by other user accounts Suppose you have two family members using the same computer, each with their own user account (Jack and Jill). \n\n\n*\n\n*Jill opens a page in her Safari browser (in her user account) for say:  \"Pregnancy test\". Then she logs out of her user account.\n\n*Jack then does a search in Spotlight for \"test\" in HIS user account ... and up comes the page \"Pregnancy test\" that Jill viewed.  One cannot actually view the web page, but the full http://address is given.\nIn other words, you can spy on what other users on your computer have viewed on the internet.
