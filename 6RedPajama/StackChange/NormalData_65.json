["Q: Where are Wi-Fi passwords stored? Are encrypted Wi-Fi passwords stored in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist? If yes, which string? \nI know we can view wireless passwords using the Keychain GUI or using security in Terminal. But where are Wi-Fi passwords actually physically stored in macOS? \n\nA: Wi-Fi passwords are physically stored in the System keychain at /Library/Keychains/System.keychain\n\nA: The best place to look for stored passwords for networks on macos in various user and system keychains. As an administrator, you can open Keychain Assistant and then look at the keychains (including ones synced with iCloud if you enable that in the preferences) for specific SSID and WiFi credentials that are saved.\nThese keychains are stored on the filesystem in encrypted form so you can use the security command-line tool to read them if you don’t want to use the graphical version of the keychain tool.\n", "Q: Unable to resolve hostnames inside macOS chroot jail I just created a chroot jail with inetutils, coreutils and bash. Most of the things seem to work. I can ping ip addresses and hosts that are inside /etc/hosts, however, I can't ping hosts that are not in /etc/hosts. I copied both resolv.conf and protocols to the chroot jail, but I still cannot ping hostnames. Which file am I supposed to put inside the jail so I can resolve hostnames? I have also read some stuff about scutil, but I want to avoid copying more binaries as much as possible.\n$ ping 8.8.8.8 \nPING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=0 ttl=120 time=22.322 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=120 time=26.672 ms\n\n$ ping google.com   # Host not in /etc/hosts\nping: unknown host\n\n$ ping example.com  # Host in /etc/hosts\nPING example.com (93.184.216.34): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 93.184.216.34: icmp_seq=0 ttl=50 time=160.226 ms\n64 bytes from 93.184.216.34: icmp_seq=1 ttl=50 time=147.602 ms\n\n\nA: I was able to get it to work by making sure the /etc/resolver.conf existed in the chroot and then symlinking /var/run/mDNSResponder into the chroot.\n$ sudo chroot -u user \"/Users/user/Source/macos-mkjail/test_jail\" /bin/bash\nbash-4.4$ ping www.google.com\nPING www.google.com (216.58.194.164): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 216.58.194.164: icmp_seq=0 ttl=53 time=10326.366 ms\n64 bytes from 216.58.194.164: icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=44.899 ms\n64 bytes from 216.58.194.164: icmp_seq=2 ttl=53 time=39.388 ms\n^C--- www.google.com ping statistics ---\n3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 39.388/3470.218/10326.366/4848.030 ms\nbash-4.4$exit\n$\n\n\nA: Basically the problem is that newer macOS versions use mDNSResponder to resolve host names, and the standard library inside the chroot isn't able to contact the mDNSResponder. Without that communication, resolving names isn't possible. You'll want to install an responder inside the chroot jail in order to get it working.\nYou can find more information in this post:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/33356677/how-can-i-get-dns-resolution-to-work-inside-a-mac-os-x-chroot-on-el-capitan\n\nA: Copy /etc/resolv.conf from your host-system into the chroot and hardlink the mDNSresponder-socket into the chroot and sudo ln /var/run/mDNSResponder $CHROOT_ROOT_DIRECTORY/var/run/mDNSResponder. By hardlinking the socket will be reachable inside the chroot too. Works on 10.15.\n", "Q: How do I get names for devices connected to my hotspot? Once I turn on a hotspot in Settings > Personal Hotspot, on iOS, and a device connects, a blue banner at the top of the screen appears with the number of connected devices.  I would like to see the hostname and any other associated information about the devices connected. Where could I find this information?\n\nA: While you can't see a current list of what is connected to your iphone's personal hotspot, you can goto Settings/Cellular/go down to the CELLULAR DATA section and click Personal Hotspot that has a Data amount next to it, and you will see a list of each device and the amount of data they have used on the hotspot.\n\nA: With a network scanner app like Net Analyzer running on your iPhone, you can see who’s connected.\n\nBlackMagic is my iPhone 7 - the host. The other two devices are Toshiba Flashair Cards connected to my personal hotspot.\n\nA: Unfortunately no GUI exists in iOS for finding details about connected devices to the wireless hotspot (i.e. tethered devices). You can use a network scanner app to find connected devices, but it is not fool proof as it will only find devices that actively respond. Usually you'll only be able to find the MAC address and the IP-address given to the unit.\n\nA: Setting>Tap on the name of your Hot spot and you'll see the names  of the devices connected  you can then click on the names of the connected devices to remove them once you log into your iCloud account.\n", "Q: Where to buy the Logitech crayon for educational iPad use?

I was exploring the man page for bash and looking at the -D option, which, according to the manual:\n   -D        A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $ is  printed\n             on  the standard output.  These are the strings that are sub-\n             ject to language translation when the current locale is not C\n             or  POSIX.   This  implies the -n option; no commands will be\n             executed.\n\nHowever, on my mac it generates no output and dumps me into a new shell that seems to have less functionality than the original shell; the which command stopped working in this new shell.\nJust wondering if someone can offer insight into what this option is for on the mac. I'm probably using it wrong, I'm sure.\n\nA: It's intended to extract all the localizable strings without running the script, but it isn't very useful even for that limited purpose and I believe it has long been deprecated. If you want to see it doing something:\n% printf \"foo\\n\\$\\\"bar\\\"\\n\" | bash -D\n\"bar\"\n\n\nA: \nOn my mac, bash -D generates no output\n\nbash -D (and its equivalent long option --dump-strings) reads commands from standard input or a file and extracts strings marked as translatable, that is, double-quoted strings that are preceded by a dollar sign, like $\"Hello, world\".\nIf bash -D is run without any input, as you did, it outputs nothing and starts a new shell (a special shell, see below.)\nFor example, for this simple script /tmp/script:\n#!/bin/bash\necho $\"Hello, world\"\n\nbash -D outputs:\n\"Hello, world\"\n\nAs you see, this is equivalent to searching for lines that match $\"<text>\" and removing the dollar sign. \nMore interesting is the output of the similar option --dump-po-strings, which is, as the Bash man page puts it, equivalent to -D, but the output is in the GNU gettext po (portable object) file format.:\nbash --dump-po-strings /tmp/script\n#: /tmp/script:2\nmsgid \"Hello, world\"\nmsgstr \"\"\n\nThis excellent article How to add localization support to your bash scripts provides more information on how to use this option.\n\nbash -D dumps me into a new shell that seems to have less functionality than the original shell\n\nThat's right, the new shell doesn't react to any commands. The reason for this is that the -D option implies -n, which directs the shell to read commands but not execute them.\nThe -n option deserves an explanation: although a seemingly useless option at first glance, it is actually quite useful. bash -n does not only read commands but also validates them and complains if the syntax is not valid, so you can run bash -n <script name> to check a script for syntax errors without executing any command.\nThis means that after executing bash -D, the shell you get will happily accept your commands, check for syntax validity (and output an error if necessary) and do nothing. That's why which \"doesn't work\".\nSee Invoking Bash and The Set Builtin sections of the Bash Reference Manual for some background information on this behavior.\n", "Q: How to decrypt shared WiFi passwords? With the introduction of iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra, a new feature was added: Sharing WiFi Passwords.\n\nThis awesome and convenient feature comes with one draw back: The passwords are stored in Keychain encrypted.  From my decent knowledge of wifi networks, macOS must be able to decrypt the encrypted key into the plaintext password in order to use it to connect. \nHow can I decrypt the Keychain key to get the password in plaintext?\n\nA: The summary answer is that the password doesn't need to be passed as the authentication can take advantage of a derived value that combines the SSID and the passphrase into a longish hexadecimal string (or value since everything is a number in the end) and stores that. You would need to reverse engineer or crack that intentional one way process to remove the password component of the end product.\nHere is an article that describes your question.\nAlright, for example here is the password I used:  SomeSnazzyPassphrase! And here it is in the keychain after iOS shares it to a Mac CEAF1EE4F3050D25F2EF057A66CFD4570559C95656450407136347B75960255E\nBefore we understand how to reverse it, we must understand how we got there.\nFirst of all we're using a program called wpa_passphrase, which is used in combination of your SSID and Passphrase, to generate that long encoded string.\nThis is how we obtained the large \"password\" above: wpa_passphrase <ssid> [passphrase]\nFor example wpa_passphrase MySSID SomeSnazzyPassphrase!\nAnd we have the PSK hashed created to be CEAF1EE4F3050D25F2EF057A66CFD4570559C95656450407136347B75960255E\nNow as wpa_supplicant uses an AES-based cipher, reversing that isn't going to be easy.  In fact,  I'm just going to go out on a limb and say it's practically impossible. \n\nA: Open the app \"Keychain Access\".\nSearch for the name of the WiFi network. You'll see it listed as an \"AirPort network password\".\nDouble click the entry to open the details for the stored password. Then click \"Show password\".\nYou'll be prompted to input your account password, and the WiFi password is then shown in plain text.\n", "Q: How to open .cfg file on iOS I have downloaded a .cfg file from\nWindows 7 that I want to open in iOS.

My iPad Air 2 keeps downloading iOS 11 in the background and then tries to push me into upgrading. I don't want that. I have declined it numerous times, and recovered the storage space it takes up from the download, but every time it keeps doing it over and over.\nIs there a way for my iPad (currently running iOS 10) to stop downloading or bothering me about iOS 11 at all?\n\nA: Update:\niOS/iPadOS 13.6 has introduced the ability for users to turn off automatic download of updates. To configure automatic download or installation of iOS/iPadOS updates on your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings app → General → Software Update → Customize Automatic Updates and toggle the switches as desired.\nThe linked Apple Support document discusses the same:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204204\n\nCustomize Automatic Updates\n\nWith iOS 13.6, or iPadOS, you can choose not to download software updates automatically. Go to Settings > General > Software Update > Customize Automatic Updates, then turn off Download iOS updates.\n\n\nOld answer which applies to iOS/iPadOS versions earlier than 13.6 is as follows:\nApple strongly advises to keep your iOS devices up-to-date by installing the latest supported public release of iOS on your devices.\nWhile Apple takes every measure to get the iOS devices to the newly released software, you can choose to opt out of upgrading. There is no straightforward way for you to turn-off iOS software upgrade all together, following are a few tricks you can employ to keep yourself from upgrading:\n\n*\n\n*Delete the update and avoid Wi-Fi connection: First delete the already downloaded iOS update by going to Settings app → General → Storage & iCloud Storage → Manage Storage. Select the Software Update item, tap on Delete Update and confirm that you want to delete the update.\nNow disconnect your device from Wi-Fi. Software update can be downloaded and installed only over a Wi-Fi connection. If you can make do with a regular data/LTE connection, you can avoid Wi-Fi and you will not be nagged by a downloaded update.\n\n\n*Block the Apple software update domain(s) on your router: If you need to connect to a Wi-Fi connection at your home or office and have the admin access to the router, you can blacklist the Apple Software domains. Use it with caution as this will block the domains for others who are connected to the access point as well and they will not be able to check for or install the update. Prevent access to the following domains:\n appldnld.apple.com\n mesu.apple.com\n\n\nA: I think, in iOS 12, notifications have been settled for updating in midnight only. That too only when it is plugged in. Also, after entering the passcode, the update can be postponed further. But so far, just like macOS, iOS is really adamant on getting itself updated,\n\nA: Here is your solution.\nI too have a limit on my data and their updates aren't exactly small in size but are currently about 2.5 GB in file size which is quite expensive if you are on restricted data.\nFor years I had to manually keep on deleting these updates so that I didn't accidentally install the update and to get rid of those relentless notifications, but good news I have finally a solution that works for me.\nWhat you need to do essentially is fill up the space on your device enough so that the IOS Update physically cannot download. It will present you with a message stating that \"The update cannot be installed because it requires at least #### amount of availiable storage during installation.\"\nThis will then solve your problems.\nYour choice as to how you fill up the space. You may want to download a lot of Netflix movies to your device.\nFor me the quickest way may seem obsurd but it's the quickest.\nI set my iPad facing a window and simply just hit record and leave it for an hour or so. At least I get some nice wildlife shots as my window sits facing a park. This usually fills up the space and if I ever need space I simply go in to my gallery and delete the video. You can even do incremental videos so you only have to delete one for however much space you need rather than having a single file taking up the entire space on the device hard drive.\nThis may seem tedious but is the only way to get Apple of your back from forcing their stupid updates on its users.\n", "Q: Which problems can be expected by continuing to use a MacBook Pro Battery already due for replacement? I turned in my MacBook Pro 15\" Late-2013 to a service shop. The battery indicator recently has said either \"Condition: Replace Now\" or \"Condition: Service Battery\" (I can't remember which).\nThe service shop returned a service cost proposal: after currency conversion $350 USD + VAT including work. Quite expensive.\nThe reason for the high price is – according to the shop – that the battery on this model is permanently attached to the so called \"Top Case\" (unibody case + keyboard + trackpad). To replace the battery, the Top Case assembly must be replaced.\nI am inclined to reject the service offer, and keep on using the computer with the current battery. What sort of problems can be expected by doing so? Is the computer in any danger in the short or long term?\n\nFYI, MacOS help about battery conditions:\n\nView your battery’s condition: Press and hold the Option key and click\n  the battery icon  in the menu bar.\nYou may see any of the following conditions:\nNormal: The battery is functioning normally.\nReplace Soon: The battery is functioning normally but holds less\n  charge than it did when it was new.\nReplace Now: The battery is functioning normally but holds\n  significantly less charge than it did when it was new. You can\n  continue to use the battery until you replace it without harming your\n  computer.\nService Battery: The battery isn’t functioning normally, and you may\n  or may not notice a change in its behavior or the amount of charge it\n  holds. Take your computer in for service. You can continue to use your\n  battery before it’s checked without harming your computer.\n\n\nA: I use a similar model of MacBook Pro (15” Late 2013).\nThe batteries have something called charge cycle (1 charge cycle = 1 full charge and discharge). The MacBook Pro battery typically retain 80% charge holding capacity after completing 1000 cycles.\nAlthough the advanced lithium-ion batteries in MacBook is meant to last for several years before they begin to lose their overall charge capacity, there will eventually be a time when it will need replacement.\nThis is reported by macOS by alerting you about battery condition. You can also view the current cycle count of the battery by going to Apple Menu → About This Mac → System Report... → Hardware → Power → Battery Information: → Health Information: → Cycle Count.\nThere are also various 3rd party apps which you can use to determine the current battery health status. coconutBattery is one such popular tool.\nOnce you are convinced that the battery need replacement, it is strongly advised to do so.\nAlso, the top case, keyboard, trackpad and the battery comprise of a single unit in the MacBook model you own. The entire unit will need replacement. (I got mine replaced a few months ago). That explains the hefty price tag.\n\nWhich problems can be expected by continuing to use a MacBook Pro Battery already due for replacement?\n\nContinuing to neglect replacement may end up damaging other components thereby leading to more expenses. In my case (pun intended :-D), the battery started swelling which could have also ended up damaging the logic board assembly.\nOther obvious issues include, lesser backup than expected, random shutdown under load and possibility of reduced performance at times.\nIf you haven't done so in the last 5 years since you bought the MacBook and macOS is alerting you about it, it's highly recommended to get the battery replaced for extending the lifetime of your MacBook Pro.\n\nA: I have had this on several Macbook Pros. In general, there is no lasting impact on the machine, and no risk that I can determine. The only impact is unreliable battery life. I mostly use my Macbooks plugged in, in which case this issue is not noticeable. However, should I unplug the Macbook Pro, battery life can be literally minutes, despite what the menu bar claims. Often the display will indicate 80% charge, then suddenly indicate 10%. This is not unusual for LiIon batteries, where voltage can drop suddenly with the age of the battery. In all cases, replacing the battery returned the battery life to normal.\nYes there are risks, as another poster mentions the batteries can swell. I will point out that LiIon batteries can swell for many reasons, and age isnt the only one. But it would be prudent to keep an eye on the battery and case, just in case.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2018 switch from sleep to DarkWake in loop. How to diagnose?

Anyway I guess the sleep-wake loop is not healthy for display and battery.\nI've tried a lot of different setups and sometimes sleep is good and continuous, but cannot really get to the real cause.\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled PowerNap\n\n*Disabled Network activation (but in logs I keep seeing TCPKeepAlive=active)\n\n*Resetting SMC\n\n*Disabling BT\n\n*Disabling \"BT device can wake up system\" \n\n*Gradually disconnecting hardware\n\n*Disabling \"stop disks when possible\" (CalDigit tech-support hint)\n\n\nProblems appearing sometimes again, every time the logs are slightly different.\nThis is the latest power management log: now there's also a thermal warning. \n03:32:25.682387 +0200   powerd  [System: SRPrevSleep kCPU]\n03:32:25.683183 +0200   powerd  SleepService: window begins with cap time=86400 secs\n03:32:25.683713 +0200   powerd  DarkWake from Normal Sleep [CDNP] due to EC.Thunderbolt/Maintenance:\n03:32:25.684275 +0200   powerd  hibmode=3 standbydelay=10800\n03:32:25.691540 +0200   powerd  \n03:32:25.692761 +0200   powerd  [System: PushSrvc SRPrevSleep kCPU]\n03:32:30.731576 +0200   powerd  [System: PushSrvc SRPrevSleep kCPU]\n03:32:34.534926 +0200   powerd  Entering Sleep state due to 'Dark Wake Thermal Emergency':TCPKeepAlive=active\n03:32:34.536879 +0200   powerd  [System: PushSrvc SRPrevSleep kCPU]\n03:32:34.537423 +0200   powerd  SleepService: window has terminated.\n03:32:39.278328 +0200   powerd  [System: SRPrevSleep kCPU]\n03:32:39.550590 +0200   powerd  \n03:32:39.551560 +0200   powerd  \n03:32:57.901601 +0200   powerd  \n03:32:57.924422 +0200   powerd  [System: SRPrevSleep kCPU]\n03:32:57.990973 +0200   powerd  [System: PrevIdle SRPrevSleep kCPU]\n03:33:09.381060 +0200   powerd  [System: SRPrevSleep kCPU]\n03:33:09.381661 +0200   powerd  SleepService: window begins with cap time=86400 secs\n03:33:09.382223 +0200   powerd  DarkWake from Normal Sleep [CDNP] due to EC.Thunderbolt/Maintenance:\n03:33:09.382680 +0200   powerd  hibmode=3 standbydelay=10800\n03:33:09.389934 +0200   powerd  \n03:33:09.390987 +0200   powerd  [System: PushSrvc SRPrevSleep kCPU]\n03:33:14.430394 +0200   powerd  [System: PushSrvc SRPrevSleep kCPU]\n03:33:18.286223 +0200   powerd  Entering Sleep state due to 'Dark Wake Thermal Emergency':TCPKeepAlive=active\n03:33:18.290284 +0200   powerd  [System: PushSrvc SRPrevSleep kCPU]\n03:33:18.291146 +0200   powerd  SleepService: window has terminated.\n03:33:23.001823 +0200   powerd  [System: SRPrevSleep kCPU]\n03:33:23.305851 +0200   powerd  \n\nI have other logs showing different messages (cannot really connect them to a specific hardware/software configuration), like this:\n03:20:35.990712 +0200   powerd  Entering Sleep state due to 'Maintenance Sleep':TCPKeepAlive=active\n03:20:41.000563 +0200   powerd  \n03:20:41.001486 +0200   powerd  \n05:20:42.506452 +0200   powerd  \n05:20:42.526068 +0200   powerd  [System: PrevIdle DeclUser BGTask SRPrevSleep kCPU kDisp]\n05:20:42.535903 +0200   powerd  [System: PrevIdle DeclUser BGTask kDisp]\n05:20:44.993979 +0200   powerd  [System: PrevIdle DeclUser BGTask kDisp]\n05:20:53.553421 +0200   powerd  [System: PrevIdle DeclUser BGTask kDisp]\n05:20:53.953029 +0200   powerd  [System: PrevIdle DeclUser BGTask SRPrevSleep kCPU kDisp]\n05:20:53.953925 +0200   powerd  DarkWake from Normal Sleep [CDN] due to EC.RTC/Maintenance:\n05:20:53.954440 +0200   powerd  hibmode=3 standbydelay=10800\n05:20:53.964825 +0200   powerd  \n05:20:53.966604 +0200   powerd  [System: PrevIdle DeclUser BGTask SRPrevSleep kCPU kDisp]\n05:20:54.850831 +0200   powerd  [System: PrevIdle DeclUser SRPrevSleep IPushSrvc kCPU kDisp]\n05:20:59.029604 +0200   powerd  [System: DeclUser BGTask SRPrevSleep kCPU kDisp]\n05:21:38.969290 +0200   powerd  [System: DeclUser SRPrevSleep kCPU kDisp]\n05:21:38.974772 +0200   powerd  Entering Sleep state due to 'Maintenance Sleep':TCPKeepAlive=active\n\nSpare question: What \"EC.\" stands for?  \nI cannot really target the real cause.\nCurrent HW connections:\nMacBookPro -> Thunderbolt 3 cable with PD -> CalDigit TS3 -> Dell 2013 Monitor via DisplayPort + Ethernet + Dell USB3 hub via USB3 -> Amazon USB3 hub -> Wacom tablet via USB\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Best ways to diagnose? \n\n*Any workarounds for disabling DarkWake, if is it safe?\n\n\nUPDATE: Just found disabling Find My Mac could be triggering TCPKeepAlive=false, but I'm not sure if it will really last. Last sleep cycle was perfect and log says:\n19:35:43.852487 +0200   powerd  Entering Sleep state due to 'Idle Sleep':TCPKeepAlive=inactive\n\n...but should I really disable useful Find My Mac for that?.\n\nA: You could force disabling TCPKeepAlive when on battery power. However, this may reduce the functionality of Find My Mac (notably cannot find your mac when it's sleeping).\nRun this command from the Terminal:\nsudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 0\n\nIn any case, I'd argue if your mac is stolen, it won't be able to connect to the Internet anyway unless the thief logs in as a guest (using the Safari-only login mode) and configures Wi-Fi for it to use.\n", "Q: Unable to download apps on iPad 1 I am using an iPad first generation. I am not able to download any apps from the App Store as they are no longer supported on iOS 5.1.1.\nThey ask me to update iOS but I can not see any software update available for my iPad.\nWhat do I do?\n\nA: iOS 5 was released in 2011. A new major iOS version is released every year.\niOS 5.1.1 is the last supported iOS release for iPad 1. A lot of apps on the App Store no longer support iOS 5 as it is outdated. Basically the recent version(s) of iOS have advanced way past the features and technologies (due to new hardware features and advancements) available around iOS 5.\nYou’ll be able to find very few apps on the App Store capable of running on iOS 5. With Apple's push for keeping the apps up-to-date and dropping support for older software releases, a lot of the popular and commonly used apps are no longer iOS 5 compatible.\niPad 1 can not be upgraded past iOS 5.1.1 which is the last supported release for the device.\n", "Q: Set pmset to sleep in a specified time I could set sleep as\npmset sleep now\n\nI'd like the machine to sleep in 10 minutes later for example, (I am going to have lunch but desire Mac wait a process to be finished)\nI checked the \"pmset\" and \"sleep\" document but found no solution.\nHow could I set the mac to sleep in 10 minutes later.\n\nA: The pmset command is incredibly powerful. Have a read through it’s manual page to get an idea of all the features it has. To achieve what you are looking for, you could use the scheduler built into every Mac by defining the correct date and time you wish your Mac to go to sleep: pmset schedule sleep \"09/01/2018 00:00:00\". \nAs far as I know, this does not allow you to set a schedule with a relative time though. A potential workaround for this would be to write a simple two-line script that first lets date figure out what “10 minutes from now” means. The -v +10M switch will let you do that. Again, read the manual page for full details. \nI have a script that, every 10 minutes, schedules a ‘power on’ in 2 hours from the current time for the Mac mini I use as a file server. When the power goes down, my UPS runs out and the machine shuts down, it will power itself back on automatically two hours later or whenever the power comes on after that. \n\nA: If you need more control than pmset offers, consider Power Manager. It is a commercial product but it offers relative and absolute scheduling of sleep and wake events.\nThe Power Manager status menu item includes a Quick Schedule. This includes a Sleep in 10 minutes option:\n\nHolding down keyboard modifiers adjusts the Quick Schedule times.\nI am biased because I wrote Power Manager; consider that a chance to give it a try and get in touch with any specific questions.\n", "Q: Why is there no difference between 2 differently capitalized folders? I have an empty directory called \"foo\". I try to create a new directory called \"Foo\". But I cannot create it:\n***@###:~/test$ mkdir foo\n***@###:~/test$ ls\nfoo\n***@###:~/test$ mkdir Foo\nmkdir: Foo: File exists\n***@###:~/test$ ls\nfoo\n\nThe same behaviour can be seen for files as well.\nOn Linux, 2 files/folders with a difference in case can coexist in the same directory.\nWhy did MacOS chose to not allow case differentiation for files and directories?\n\nA: History. Backwards compatibility. Customer preference.\nHistorical Apple, and other, filesystems were not always case-sensitive. HFS+ and now APFS have such capability. That is, they can be case sensitive or insensitive, depending on how it was formatted.\nIf you are using macOS to manipulate file and folders on a case-insensitive file system macOS will prevent creating same-named files even though their displayed names can include both cases.\nExperiment by plugging in flash drives formatted in different filesystems (FAT, ext3, etc) to easily test this behavior.\n", "Q: How do I turn off OS X function key usage? When I'm remote desktopped into other machines or using web browsers that have apps requiring function key usage, my Mac steals the keys instead...  I'll hit shift F1 to try to perform an app function, but instead my speakers turn off.  How can I disable OS X stealing function key presses meant for applications?\n\nA: One thing I did not think of, this is a Razer keyboard, so their software may interfere with normal usage.  In this case though, if I put the keyboard into \"Game\" mode, function keys turn into normal function keys again.  I can then also map my volume controls to the macro keys and not lose that function either!\n", "Q: Improve GPS accuracy by disabling cellular data I need my iPhone 7 Plus GPS accuracy to be very precise (without continously changing the blue dot position). My cellular data connection is often sloppy. Does disabling cellular data improve GPS accuracy? Does the GPS depend on cellular data at all? I thought the GPS partially relied on cellular data to improve its accuracy.\n\nA: Cellular has nothing to do with GPS - they are two distinct technologies.  So disabling cellular will not increase/decease the accuracy of GPS\n\nI thought the GPS partially relied on cellular data to improve its\naccuracy.\n\nCellular location data can augment GPS to improve the performance of location tracking (where you are), but it can't improve the accuracy of GPS.\nThere are four basic technologies that provide location data:\n\n*\n\n*WiFi location data\n\n*Cellular location data\n\n*GPS (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and QZSS\n\n*iBeacon (Apple centric Bluetooth Low Energy)\n\nFocusing on WiFi positioning, cellular positioning and GPS, all of them work in tandem to get your position.\nYour iPhone location sensor (Broadcom BCM4774) is the receiver that GPS uses.\nCell Phone Tracking\nBasically, cellular location tracking is done at the cell cite - which antenna you're connected to; it approximates your location and augments it with GPS data.\n\nA cell phone’s location can be detected through  cell site location\ninformation (CSLI) or global  positioning system (GPS)  data.\n\n\nWiFi Tracking\nWith WiFi positioning it takes a known quantity (the location of the associated AP) and measures the signal of the wireless client.\n\nThe most common and widespread localization technique used for\npositioning with wireless access points is based on measuring the\nintensity of the received signal (received signal strength indication\nor RSSI) and the method of \"fingerprinting\".\n\n\nGPS\nGPS uses multiple signals to measure location.  However, multiple factors like signal strength blockage, weather, etc. affect the signal.  Accuracy, however, depends on the quality of the receiver (the chip in your phone) and the number of signals it uses.\n\nGPS is good down to the cm (centimeter range) and even down to mm, but to get this type of accuracy, it depends on the sensor being used.\n", "Q: Trigger the Creation of a Specific Preference List?

I'd like to be able to create this file reliably in OS X 10.10-10.13 (inclusive), from a terminal, if possible.  \nThanks. \n\nA: In case you're still trying to do this, I just figured out how to generate the file on my Mac running Mac OS X 10.13.6 (17G65).\nIt's remarkably simple. The file seems to be generated once you select “About This Mac” from the  menu, as shown here:\n\nBefore that, \"$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SystemProfiler.plist\" did not exist.\nAfter that, I could run\ndefaults read \"$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SystemProfiler.plist\" 'CPU Names'\nand get the result I was looking for. \n\nA: It seems you're running your script as root such that ~ expands to /var/root instead of a home directory in /Users. Unless you've logged into the root account using the GUI, I wouldn't expect that file to exist in root's home folder. You should be able to find the file in a user account which has been logged into.\n", "Q: Does Apple still fix screen coating issues on the mid-2014 MBPs? I read on MacRumors that if I take my mid-2014 (purchased in early 2015) 15\" MBP to an Apple store, they may fix the well-known anti-reflective screen coating issue.  MacRumors is not an authoritative source, as far as I know, so I'd like to check here as well.

Any way I could restore data still? I know I have 22Gb of photos, if it could help. \nI have tried to factory reset my phone so I can choose the \"restore from itunes backup\" option, and still I had the same problem.\n\nA: That backup is awfully larger than it should be. I dont think you'll be able to restore it on that size, you'll need a 128GB model for the update to work since most OS sizes are between 8GB - 4GB of that base memory. Thats why you are having problems.\n", "Q: Swap or remap Cmd+Tab to Ctrl+Tab Please read my answer and bmike's comment before voting to close. Someone is going to come along and say I should just learn Mac shortcuts, but I must say I use Chromebooks, Windows, & Linux boxes and they all put the Ctrl/Cmd in the bottom left and right hand corner of the computer.  I'm sorry but changing one operating system is way easier then changing the other three (especially considering Chromebook's native shortcuts can't be changed).\nTo alleviate the most common keyboard shortcuts, I have the left Ctrl mapped to the Cmd on my Apple computer.  And have switched the right Cmd and Opt (Alt) on the right hand side.  I then switched Cmd and Ctrl again in iTerm (a very well made application).\nNow unfortunately Ctrl+Tab no longer works to switch between browser tabs.

It is really frustrating because I can't take pictures or anything when this happens. But, I have found that if I know that I will be going somewhere where I won't have a signal I put my phone on airplane mode and then it doesn't happen. \n\nA: No, this is Apple bricking your phone until you upgrade your iOS as they have told you to do.

I'm reading a book on bash shell that mentions the rename command. When I executed man rename a man page was shown. However, when I entered rename on bash shell, it reported:\n-bash: rename: command not found\n\nI did some research and discovered that you can install the rename command with Homebrew.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any good reason not to install it with Homebrew?\n\n*Is there anything you can do with the rename command that you can't do with the mv command?\nI'm also curious to know if there is a known explanation for why the rename command doesn't exist in the first place. And why is there a man page for a command that does not exist?\n\nA: In the default install of macOS, rename man page is available in the section 2. As you can notice from the man page, rename is not a command but a BSD system call.\nThe Homebrew formula named rename is a Perl script. You should be fine with installing it. In-fact it can give you much more flexibility than plain mv command.\nAfter you have installed rename utility via Homebrew, running man rename will show the man page for the installed utility and not the BSD system call.\n\nI'm also curious to know if there is a known explanation for why the command does not exist in the first place.\n\nrename is not a standard Unix command.\n\nAnd why is there a man page for a command that does not exist?\n\nAs mentioned above, the man page present refers to the system call by the same name.\n\nA: With rename command you can search and replace string in multiple files in simply way:\nrename 's/oldstring/newtext/' file00*\n\nIt's really useful. With mv you cannot do the same. Unless you get loop to work:\nfor file in file00*; do new=${file/oldstring/newtext}; mv —- \"$file\" \"$new\"; done\n\n\nA: You can install using brew https://brewinstall.org/Install-rename-on-Mac-with-Brew/\nHope this solves your problem. \n", "Q: Actual Image not shown in the Body of Apple Mail client Products witnessed: iPad 2, iPad & iPhone X; iOS 11+;\nWe send email broadcast of our reports to corporate customers; The email carries an attachment (*.pdf) as well as an image embedded in the body (any image *.jpeg, *.png, *.jpg etc; We use the Content-ID {CID} to attach the Image).\nWe witnessed that some iPhone X and iPad users were complaining that the image embedded in the body is an old one from a previous mail and not the actual one that was attached. We observed that these users were using Apple's native email client. We had checked all other email clients' and the image embedded into the body was the actual one; Email clients' under our observation were MS Office Outlook 2016, Outlook for Android, Outlook Web client, Samsung Mail Client for Android, Hotmail, Outlook and Yahoo web email interface all displayed the actual image except for Gmail, where the image is not shown at all for some security reason.\nWe would have been happy if the Apple's native email client did not show the image at all, but having shown some older image from a cache source in its device have sparkled lot of criticism to us.\nDid anybody came through this problem? How did you all overcome this?\n\nA: Are your CIDs universally unique? I.e., do they change from email to email? RFC 2392 requires this (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2392).

Why was the iPhone disabled?  Apple has a support article here with some suggestions on how to address this:\n\nOn an iPhone 6s and earlier, iPad, or iPod touch: Press and hold both\n  the Home and Top (or Side) buttons for at least 10 seconds, until you\n  see the Apple logo.\nIf you still see the Connect to iTunes screen after you restart, you\n  need to reinstall iOS:\nMake sure that you're using the latest version of iTunes. Connect your\n  device to your computer using the cable that came with your device.\n  You should see this message: \"There's a problem with the iPhone [your\n  device name] that requires it to be updated or restored.\" Click Update\n  (not Restore) to reinstall iOS and keep your personal data.\n\nThis will wipe you're iPhone completely so if there is any data on the phone that you need you should consider that first.\nIf the iPhone being disabled is iCloud related you will still need to enter the associated account credentials after restoring.\n\nA: From what you originally wrote it sounds like the phone is stuck with a screen like this:\n\nAs Jon points out in his answer, this isn't saying that your phone is connected to iTunes, it is saying that a serious and unrecoverable fault has developed with the phone's operating system and you need to use iTunes to attempt to fix it.\nThis message can be displayed for both software and hardware faults which affect the running of iOS.\nUnfortunately with a phone in this state there is little to no chance of recovering your data if you didn't use iCloud to do backups, we need to reinstall/restore the iPhone's operating system.\nThere are different levels of restore, and I suggest given the situation with the device we jump straight to a DFU restore, DFU (Device Firmware Update) will restore the operating system and the boot loader.\n\nImportant: Do not proceed with a DFU restore if your iPhone has been jailbroken.\n\nThe first step to getting the phone to restore in DFU mode is to put it into that mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the phone to iTunes.\n\n*Hold the home button and sleep/wake button together until the screen goes black.\n\n*Release the sleep/wake button and keep holding the home button for 10 seconds.\n\n*The phone should remain with a black screen, but iTunes should recognise the phone is connected.\n\n*Follow the iTunes prompts to restore your phone.\n\n*The device should restart.\n\n\nIf the phone fails to restore after performing a DFU restore then it is likely a hardware issue with the device and you'll need to seek support from an Apple Store, or Apple Authorised Service Provider, you can find out more here: https://checkcoverage.apple.com\n", "Q: Is it possible to stop the execution of a script temporarily on macOS?

I use High Sierra.\n\nA: If executed from the shell you can type\nCTRL + Z\n\nthis will send the \"terminal stop\" signal (SIGTSTP) to the process and the system  won't schedule any more CPU time to the process.\nYou can then restart it by typing\nfg\n\non the same shell.\n", "Q: Macbook disk space show as used photos library space that is stored in an external SD I have moved my photo library into an external SD card and now that library is configured as the system photo library.\nThe problem is that my Macbook shows that the hard drive is still using an amount of space (22,2GB) used by photos:\n\n\nHow could I solve that?\n\nA: This is a bug and I can reproduce that on macOS 10.12 and macOS 10.13 and I have filed both feedback and a radar (developer bug with Apple) to remedy it.\nMy thought is that the process that reads the space occupied by photos libraries isn't smart enough to detect that the iCloud or system library isn't on the boot volume.\nUntil Apple fixes their code you could not store the photos off the disk or understand that the summary calculations are wrong. One might assume that if enough people report the same bug, it might get more weight when the list of   bugs to fix gets reviewed - but I can't speak for how Apple in specific decides which engineers work on what tasks.\nFor me the 109 GB of green \"photos\" exists on the volume Data and not on fast - despite what the visual shows.\n\n", "Q: Mac equivalent of ALT+010 for Windows (Replace Carriage Return/Line Breaks) I'm trying to do a find and replace in Excel 2016 for Mac, to replace all line breaks with a space.\nOn Windows I'd do CTRL+R for find and replace, then hold the alt key and type 010 which would insert a linebreak into the find field.\nI'd then type a Space, and it hit Replace All.\nI can't seem to workout how to do the keyboard equivalent on a Mac?\nAny suggestions.\n\nA: In most macOS applications ControlEnter works, and in Excel ControlAltEnter works in cells, and even in Find and Replace it will enter a space, but it doesn't appear to search.\nSimilarly \\n which is an escaped new line doesn't work, nor does copying and pasting a new line character from another application.\nIn word ^p works as an escape character but again not in Excel.\nIt looks very much like this isn't possible in Excel for Mac. The best thing I could suggest at this point is to ask for Microsoft to fix this via their feedback forum:\nhttps://excel.uservoice.com/\nThe last option I was going to suggest was using Numbers which is the Apple version of Excel, it works very well in general but has the same limitation from my testing.\nLast option would be to use Excel for Windows via a Remote Desktop application like Citrix, a simulator like WINE or a virtual machine like VirtualBox, Parallels or VMWare.\n", "Q: When does a mac laptop startup automatically after a power failure? I'm trying to get the hang of this.  I notice that sometimes when I plug the charger the macbook boots automatically, other times it doesn't.  I know in desktop macs this is determined by a setting in Energy preferences, but not sure when this is supposed to happen with macbooks. Does it change with the model? It's good to know this for troubleshooting.  Any insights would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Regardless of of the Mac model, the power settings determine if it will boot upon power failure.  If this option isn't set, it won't boot.\n\n\nA: It appears that this feature is controlled by a parameter in the Mac's NVRAM (non-volatile RAM, which contains various parameters used during the startup process). The parameter in question is AutoBoot, which controls whether the MacBook will automatically boot when the lid is opened or power is connected (note that there appears to be no way to separate these settings—if you disable boot-on-power, you also disable boot-on-lid-open). The %00 value for this parameter disables automatic boot, and %03 re-enables it. These values can be changed using the nvram command-line tool.\nSo, to disable automatic booting when power is connected, run the following command in the Terminal application (found in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) by copy-pasting it into the Terminal, then pressing return. Note that this must be run by an administrator account.\nsudo nvram AutoBoot=%00\n\nYou'll then see a prompt that looks like this:\n\nType your password, then press return. Nothing will appear on the screen as you are typing; this is normal.\nTo revert the changes (i.e., to restore the automatic booting behavior), execute the following command (once again as an administrator):\nsudo nvram AutoBoot=%03\n\nAfter entering your password (if prompted), the setting will be reset to the default.\nTo view the current values of the data in NVRAM, run the command nvram -p in Terminal. Look for the key on the right-hand side called AutoBoot. If this is set to %03, the laptop will automatically boot after a power failure (i.e., when re-connected to AC power); if AutoBoot set to %00, it won't.\nNote that NVRAM values change from time to time, so this may not be applicable in the future. Moreover, if modification of these values causes further issues, you can reset your NVRAM to its factory state by following this process.\nHere's an article with more information about the NVRAM parameters on the 2016 MacBook Pro. \n\nA: problem solved. My macbook pro early 2011, 13 inches; for two months it was turned off when the magsafe was disconnected, and when connected it was restarted. \nWell, it occurred to me to clean the logic card, so I disarmed my macbook and wiped all the dust and lint accumulated for 9 years with a soft and static free-brush while having the logic board properly grounded on a static safe mat / grounded to earth to protect from static buildup.\nAfter this, for two days I was using my macbook always connected to electricity, but then I disconnected it and now it works normally, with the battery charge. It works normal since I cleaned it thoroughly.\nTo summarize, heat buildup can cause this and a deep repair where you remove the logic board and clean out the case can help.\n", "Q: Set Safari's default search engine to Google UK How can I change Safari's default search engine to google.co.uk?\nCurrently when I search in the address bar the results are always from google.com.\nAlso if I highlight a term in Safari, right click and select \"search with Google\" it's from the US site.\nIf I scroll to the foot of the search results page it says \"United Kingdom\" at the bottom, and gives my location accurately based on my Android phone's location, but it's not actually using Google.co.uk.\nIf I select preferences, I only have Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Yahoo listed. Is there any way that I can customise this list?\n\nA: You can try using the AnySearch Safari extension which will allow you to set custom search engines to be used as the default.\nAdd this as a search engine in AnySearch: https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=@@@\n", "Q: Path Variable Limit Is there a character limit on how long your PATH variable can be on macOS? Or is there a limit in terms of the amount of binaries you can reference in your path?\n\nA: You'll basically never hit the limit if you have any sort of reasonably sane PATH.\nI have just tried having a PATH variable that is 96 kB long (unreasonably long). It works on High Sierra without problems.\nIf I step it up to 128 kB, I begin having problems launching commands as they will fail due to the large environment. The PATH environment is stored though.\n\nA: The size of a variable is subject to the limitations of the hardware on which is it run, that said, a variable could be milllions of bytes. But an environment variable,such as PATH, is subject to system limitations (ARG_MAX) since the whole environment is passed to the system call- execve. So, a reasonable estimate of the maximum size of an environment variable would be, the bytes used in the current environment- env | wc -c, plus a reasonable buffer of bytes needed to run commands in the shell- 2048 bytes to 4096 bytes, subtracted from the maximum number of bytes allowed in an argument- 262144 bytes. Usablility of an environment variable this size is another issue.\nThe shell starts its search in the left most path listed in the PATH variable then continues to the next and next until it finds the command that you issued. The shell also keeps a record of that command so it does not need to search the PATH variable again in the current session. This is an indication that searching PATH is expensive. So, the maximum size of your PATH variable should be as small as you can make it.\n", "Q: Connection of ESP32/ ESP8266 not recognized using MacBook Pro I’m trying to connect those devices, with no success. When I’m using Linux machine I find at ‘/dev/ttyUSB0’. From googling around I understand it is a Mac issue. \nAppreciate any guidance \n\nA: I had the same problem. There are a series of questions you need to go through that might change your solution.\n1st of all, which board are you using? There are several versions of the ESP chip, which are well documented in the arduino-esp8266 docs\n2nd of all, I've read some forums that say that the USB cable has to be good quality, otherwise the board will not successfully connect. I don't know too much about good usb cables, but I do know that the shorter the better as far as signal loss is concerned\nLastly, which driver did you install? I installed the SiliconLabs driver. It's important to note that in their readme (something I neglected to read until after 5 hours of troubleshooting) it explains that Mac blocks the driver from running until you give it permission. So, when you install the driver, the installer will need to get permission to run, but ALSO the driver itself will need to get permission to run. So, once you install the driver, go to System Preferences -> Security and allow the driver to run.\n\nI found out that you can verify that the driver was installed, you can run kextstat in the command line to list out all of the \"kernel extensions,\" including the driver, that are installed on your mac.\nThese steps should help you get your board to show up in /dev/tty.* and also in the ports menu in your Arduino IDE. Or at the very least, these steps should help you debug at which step of the setup process something went wrong.\nOnce you see your board in the ports menu, don't forget that in order to upload code, you need to set the board to flash mode (I forget to do that a lot).\n\nA: Seriously. After changing my USB cable it worked.\nfirst I was connecting ESP with a cable that came with the power bank. But when I changed it with my phone USB it worked!\n\nA: Use the updated driver for newer MacOS versions (High Sierra in my case)\nNewer MacOS versions driver\n\nA: I am using a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports with 2.3 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5).

I have a Mac running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5. unfortunately I am not very good at installing new programmes on my computer, and I want to update mine to the latest release macOS High Sierra.\nWhat will it cost me if I go the the Mac shop at the Metro centre to have it installed?\n\nA: First you'll need to check the compatibility of your Mac with the subsequently released version(s) of macOS. You can refer to the support document from Apple, Use the Mac operating system that came with your Mac, or a compatible newer version. This will help you in determining if your Mac can run macOS High Sierra (if not than what is the latest released supported by your Mac). Specifically, to check if your Mac can run macOS High Sierra, check if your model of Mac is listed under Can your Mac use High Sierra? section in the document, How to download macOS High Sierra.\nAs mentioned, you are already running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5. All the subsequent releases of OS X (later re-branded as macOS starting with macOS Sierra 10.12) are released by Apple free of cost and can be easily downloaded using the Mac App Store available on your Mac.\nIf you can visit an Apple Retail store, you should be able get assistance with upgradation to the latest supported release for free. If you do not have one in vicinity, you can also check with an authorised Apple retailer and check for the pricing. There are no costs from Apple whatsoever for upgradation (in your case).\n", "Q: How to get git update-index working with macOS?

Or is it a silent update to Chrome that's the cause of the change? Or something else?\n\n\nA: This was an intentional change introduced in Chrome 68 to bring the macOS behavior in line with that of Chrome on other operating systems. Prior to Chrome 68, links opened externally would open in an Incognito window if one was open, which was the opposite of the behavior on other platforms (e.g., on Windows, external links would always open in a non-Incognito window). This has been discussed at length in this Chromium bug report thread, as well as on the Google Chrome Help Forum.\nEssentially, the old behavior was deemed incorrect by the Chromium team and Chrome 68 \"corrected\" this discrepancy. There appears to be no way to revert this change within Chrome. However, one workaround is to drag an external link into the tab bar of an Incognito widow, which will open the link in that window.\n", "Q: Debugging Web app running on a specific (older) version of Safari for iOS We have an issue with our website and a client's iPad.\nWe have a button on our website.

This can be accomplished without having a physical iPad running iOS 8.2.0, i.e. you can accomplish the same using iOS Simulator. But, you'll need a Mac to do this.\nOnce you have the Mac handy, follow the steps as mentioned below (skip the ones that are not applicable):\n\n*\n\n*Install Xcode from the Mac App Store.\n\n\n*Once Xcode is installed and setup, launch Xcode go to Xcode preferences → Components → Simulator in the Menu.\n\n\n*Download iOS 8.2 simulator by clicking on the down arrow icon shown besides iOS 8.2 Simulator.\n\n\n\n*Check that the iOS 8.2 Simulator is successfully installed by the presence of blue tick-mark shown besides iOS 8.2 Simulator.\n\n\n\n\n*Launch Simulator.app by launching Xcode.app and going to Xcode → Open Developer Tool → Simulator in the Menu Bar.\n\n\n*In the Simulator, go to Setting app → Safari → Advanced and turn on the toggle next to Web Inspector.\n\n\n\n*To easily access the Simulator subsequently, you can right click on the Simulator icon in the Dock and choose Options → Keep in Dock.\n\n\n*Now open Safari.app in macOS.\n\n\n*Go to Safari → Preferences → Advanced and check Show Develop menu in menu bar.\n\n\n\n*In the Simulator app go to Hardware → Device → iOS 8.2 in the Menu and select the desired model of iPad from the available options (iPad 2/iPad Retina/iPad Air) that best matches your client's device.\n\n\n*Launch Safari on the iPad and open the desired Web page.\n\n\n*Now switch to Safari for macOS and go to Develop → Simulator - iPad - iOS 8.2 → Safari (website) in the Menu bar.\n\n\n*Voila! you can now easily debug the issue with you Web app.\n\n\nNote: In my test-run, I have observed that I was not able to get iPad 2 and iPad Retina (both running iOS 8.2) to show up in desktop Safari's Develop menu, only iPad Air. This may not be the device used by your client but it best matches with your clients environment.\nAlso, Apple recommended to upgrade to the latest version of iOS available for your device. You may also advise your client to upgrade iOS on their devices (unless they have a specific reason not to do so).\n\nA: In short, no. \nTell your client to update to the latest supported iOS for their device.

The gdisk command displays the type of partitioning when first invoked, but in your question you choose to omit this output. \n\nQuestion: How can I get macOs to actually acknowledge there's 20GB free space?\nThe Disk Utility application assumes there is never any significant free space on any drive. All successful operations performed using this application always leave the drive with no significant free space.\nOf course, drives often have free space. In fact, you can create free space using the diskutil command. Therefore, the Disk Utility application can/should only be used under ideal conditions.\nThe diskutil list command has never shown free space. There is a limits option for diskutil resizeVolume and diskutil apfs resizeContainer that will display the amount of space that a partition can be expanded into. One can assume this is free space below the said partition.\nOne command included with macOS, that will show free space, is the gpt command. In your case, you would enter the command given below.\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk2\n\nThe output from gdisk, shown in your question, produced basically the same information the above command would produce.\nI used the math below to compute the free space.\n629,409,785 - 588,881,912 - 1 = 40,527,872 sectors \n40,527,872 sectors * 512 bytes/sector = 20,750,270,464 bytes = 20.8 GB\n20.8 GB * 0.931323 GiB/GB = 22.3 GiB\n\nI used the math below to compute the size of the NTFS partition.\n588,881,912 - 264,192 + 1 = 588,617,721 sectors\n588,617,721 * 512 bytes/sector = 301,372,273,152 bytes = 301.4 GB\n301.4 GB * 0.931323 GiB/GB = 280.7 GiB\n\n\nNote: This is the same result the output from diskutil and gdisk show in your question. There is no error here. The problem may be in the way Windows 7 is labeling the partition sizes. Windows 7 may have mislabeled GB for GiB or vice versa.\n\nI used the math below to compute the size of the APFS partition\n976773128 - 629409785 + 1 = 347,363,344 sectors\n347,363,344 sectors * 512 bytes/sector =  177,850,032,128 bytes = 177.9 GB\n177.9 GB * 0.931323 GiB/GB = 165.7 GiB\n\n\nNote: 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes and 1 GiB = 1,073,741,824 bytes.\n\nQuestion: How can I get macOs to add the 20 GB of free space to the APFS partition?\nYou don't. You can add free space immediately after a APFS partition but not free space immediately before. In your case, the free space is before the APFS partition.\nTechnically, you could first move the APFS partition to the start of the free space, causing the free space to be below the APFS partition. This would allow you to use the diskutil apfs resizeContainer command to add the free space.\nThird party software exists that claims to be able move a partition.  I tried using a bootable USB flash drive containing GParted to move a APFS partition, only to discover GParted does not recognize the APFS format and therefore will not move this type of partition. (To create a bootable USB flash drive containing GParted, I used UNetbootin to transfer the GParted ISO to the flash drive.)\nAnother option would require another drive with enough free space. The steps are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the APFS partition to another drive.\n\n*Delete the APFS partition. You can do this with with diskutil, gpt or gdisk.\n\n*Create a new APFS partition to include the free space. You can do this with with gpt or gdisk.\n\nNote: Make sure the sector values you enter are divisible by 8.\n\n\n*Format the new partition. You can do this with with the Disk Utility applications, diskutil, or newfs_apfs.\n\n*Restore from the backup drive.\n\n", "Q: How can I reinstall Mac OS 9 on a G3 PowerBook's original hard drive? I have a PowerBook G3 from 2000 or so and would like to put Mac OS 9 on it for nostalgia reasons. There are games that simply don't perform well with SheepShaver, plus networking with SheepShaver isn't reliable with Classic multiplayer games.\n\n\n*\n\n*The PowerBook doesn't have a CD-ROM, just a plastic spacer.\n\n*Apparently the PowerBook G3 Pismo and Lombard variants cannot boot from a USB stick\n\n*It has Ethernet, and I have a recent MacBook with an Ethernet dongle, but everything I've read about NetBooting and NetInstalling seems difficult and unapproachable. I tried using BootMania but it won't let me create an image from any of the Mac OS 9 install disk images I have.\n\n*The PowerBook originally had Linux or BSD on it or something, so a full reformat is needed.\n\n*It has a 20 GB 2.5\" IDE drive and I have a USB to IDE adapter, so I can connect the drive to the MacBook with Mac OS X.\n\n*SheepShaver cannot use physical media, so I cannot connect the disk to SheepShaver and run the Mac OS 9 installer on it.\n\n\nI tried creating a new 512 MB disk from SheepShaver and running the Mac OS 9.2 Universal Installer to install OS9 on it. Then I formatted the physical drive with an Apple Partition Map and the partition as HFS Extended Journaled, then I mounted the drive and copied (dragged over) the files and System Folder from the newly-installed disk image. But when I boot the PowerBook with the drive hooked up I just get the blinking folder icon. If I hold Option I get the Reload and Next buttons but no disks are shown.\nI also tried dd-ing a working SheepShaver boot image to the physical disk, but I guess that doesn't have a partition map on it or something. It didn't work and diskutil list showed it as \"Unknown.\"\nDo you have any ideas how I can get Mac OS 9 back on my PowerBook?\n\nA: I tried dding the the Mac OS 9.2 Universal Installer to the hard disk, but that didn't work.\n@jaume put me on the right path, so I dd-ed the ISO to a USB stick, held down option at boot, and I'm able to install Mac OS 9 to the original hard disk. Success! Thank you!\nThe real thing I learned is that Mac OS 9 boot volumes need half a dozen special driver partitions. Older versions of Mac OS X, up to 10.12 or something, let you partition OS 9 drives correctly using the Disk Utility which had an \"Install Mac OS 9 Drivers\" option. I used hdiutil info to check that the ISO had these partitions.\n", "Q: Accessing Gmail From Terminal Is there a way to access my Gmail smtp account  just using the terminal or is this not possible?

In our office, we have a whole bunch of Magic Keyboards, and for various reasons too complex to go into here we have a habit of moving them around and connecting them to different Macbooks. As soon as they are connecting with a Lightning cable, they will typically auto-pair with the machine via Bluetooth, meaning that even once the cable is removed, they continue to be connected. It's both annoying (and potentially even a minor security risk) for someone else to have access via a keyboard they just pick up.\nWe can't return the Magic Keyboards; is there a way to either disable their Bluetooth behaviour or prevent the machine from auto-pairing, so they only work over USB?\n\nA: No. (Not that we’ve found)\nThese devices are designed to pair like rabbits.

I've done all the development work I needed in 10.14 and no longer need it. I have not added any server configurations or anything like that.\n\nA: Theoretical answer\nThis operation will fail.\nMigration assistant is a huge procedure made to make all the conversions necessary to go from an older version of MacOS X to\nthe running one.\nFor example, the Mojave (10.14) version of Migration Assistant is configured to correctly convert the Users and System files from a High Sierra (10.13) set to a Mojave running environment.\nThe High Sierra (10.13) version of Migration assistant doesn't know the specific changes of Mojave (10.14) because they weren't known at its date of conception. Then this version cannot do a migration from Mojave to High Sierra.\nOn the other hand, the Mojave version of Migration Assistant does know the specific changes from High Sierra to Mojave but some of them might be not reversible, and this is usually not documented by Apple (this is bad: Apple is convinced none of its users is interested in this information).\nPractical answer\nYour proposed migrition might succeed (my raw estimate: 25%).\nIf you didn't made system modification or specific development on Mojave,\nand if Apple didn't put in place a basic verification of the origin version of MacOS X, (is the origin version older than the target one?),\nthen you could try to run Migration Assistant from High Sierra to migrate only Users files from your Mojave backup to your running High Sierra environment.\nExperience return\nPlease add your personnal success or failure as an answer, since this might help many other Mac users.\n\nA: I have heard such a method to downgrade.

I have a USB Drive named \"Cuthbert\", and various apps use paths starting with /Volumes/Cuthbert when it is plugged in.  However, my laptop is putting it at /Volumes/Cuthbert 1, and won't let me rename it, even though there /Volumes/Cuthbert leads to nothing.  (It shows up when I ls, but does not show up in the Finder, and there is nothing there.)\nWhat is going on?  How can I fix and prevent this frustrating situation?\n\nA: Make sure you properly unmount the USB drive when you remove it. If a volume name already exists in a system and you try to add a volume with the same name it will append -n to the volume name.\n", "Q: Application Switcher showing up on wrong monitor display I have an early 2015 MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra. I also have two Dell UltraSharp Infinity Edge monitors connected to it via two Thunderbolt Mini DisplayPort outputs.\nIn the System Preferences, I've arranged my two displays such that the menu bar is located in the monitor immediately in front of me.  The second monitor sits to my left.\nThe problem I'm having is that when I hit Command + Tab to activate the Application Switcher, the switcher always appears in the monitor on my left instead of the monitor in front of me.  I would think that the switcher would appear on the monitor whose display has the Menu bar.\nIs there some way to configure my settings so that the switcher will always appear in the monitor in front of me, that is, the monitor that holds the Menu bar?\n\nA: The application switcher appears on the display where the Menu Bar is placed (the primary display).\nHowever, if you have enabled Automatically hide and show the Dock in System Preferences → Dock, the app switcher will appear on the display which has last shown the Dock.\nYou can change the display which has last shown the Dock by moving the cursor to that display, move the cursor to the edge which houses the Dock and make the Dock appear momentarily.\nThis is the simplest approach to change the display on which application switcher needs to be shown in a multi monitor setup.\n\nA: How are your displays arranged vertically? From my experience, arranging the menu bar on a display in the preferences will give that display priority horizontally, but the switcher will favor any display placed below another.\n", "Q: How to automate deleting what's inside the search box in the Dictionary app after 3/5 seconds?

Looking into my own question, the overhead for VMware outweighs the the benefits.  I put it at about 15-20% on CPU & RAM.  This is from research, not empirical data.  I have several devices/servers I want to build, none are resource intensive. I upped the Mac Mini to 16gb Ram 1TB SSD and 2TB SSHD.  The max it can take for less than $200.  Should be plenty powerful.\nSome context... \nThis is more of a home project.  A server to store family's media, documents, and backups (mostly macs & iOS).  I'll also build a full featured network firewall, I don't like black box or desktop firewalls.  I like to know what's going on.  Lastly a home automation server, there are some integrations between devices/protocols that require a system in the middle. \nI used to be an Windows engineer, 20+ years ago, when that was a new thing.  Since then moved on to management.  I try to stay close to the technology, but virtualization (hand's on is new to me).  Tired of the planning and managing tech.  I'm not allow to touch anything anymore.   I have to use my own desktop teams for my work machine. I want to get my hands back on.  Hence this home project.  though a home project, it seriuos for me, I like to research and understand best practices.  Not to mention the geek out factor. :-)\nLook forward to learning here and other sites.  Who know, this \"old man\" (not talking punch cards or anything, may be able to answer some questions.\nThank for your help.\nSunil\n\nA: In my experience - you have to just commit. If you think you need or could use the ESXi features - you should back up all your data and then wipe the hardware and run ESXi.\nThere's nothing as powerful or capable if you try and run virtualization on top of the MacOS host OS. You have far more resource loss there and far less flexibility. If you are going to virtualize, there's almost no case where ESX is more overhead or less performance than another solution.\nThe only question is do you want to invest the time to set that up. With power comes pain and learning and complexity. If your time to learn is billable or improves your happiness or ability to seek employment - all the time you invest learning ESXi is a return on investment. If you don't care to learn or have too many other things you need to do - hire out that to someone at a lower wage than you or just run things in the cloud somewhere or handle multiple hardware. You can virtualize on an Intel NUC far cheaper than you can on Mac hardware.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.virtuallyghetto.com\n\n*https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2012/05/thats-so-cool-running-esxi-5-on-apple.html\n", "Q: macOS terminal: quick way to edit command options after bash/zsh autocomplete The issue\nI use autocomplete from history a lot whether that's with up-arrow or typing the first few letters and completing the whole command including all arguments (options and others) with right-arrow.\nQuite often I have to run the same command multiple times on the same file but with different options. However, by pressing up-arrow or right-arrow, I complete to the end of the command and it's quicker to type the whole thing manually than bring the cursor back to the options, edit and then re-enter.\nBasically, I'd like to know if there's any way to use autocompletion to re-enter a command from history but bring the cursor back to the first option/argument. Alternatively, a keyboard shortcut to fill in the remaining arguments as previously after typing a different one.\ne.g.\nOption 1\nI type and enter:\n$ command -opt1 reallyverylongindeedarg1\nPressing up-arrow produces $ command -opt1 reallyverylongindeedarg1 with my cursor at the end of the line.\nI'd like to have a different keyboard shortcut that results in me having the cursor somewhere around -opt1 so I can change that to -differntopt2 and re-run the command which would now read:\n$ command -differntopt2 really.verylong.indeed.arg1\nOr, having previously typed and run:\n$ command -opt1 really.verylong.indeed.arg1\nTyping comman and then hitting right-arrow completes the full command $ command -opt1 reallyverylongindeedarg1 (again with my cursor at the end of the line). I've love to know whether there's a keyboard shortcut to jump to the first argument/option when autocompleting.\nOption 2\nAnother method would be for my to type in $ command -differntopt2 then press right arrow to fill in the argument really.verylong.indeed.arg1 as previously when I last ran this command. Resulting in:\n$ command -differntopt2 really.verylong.indeed.arg1\nWhat about just navigating with the keyboard and jump back by word?\nWell, firstly, that's far from ideal as the arguments have lots of punctuation in so each one takes several (and different numbers of) keypresses and it's slow to go back the right number of words each time to reach the option I want to edit.\nSecondly, I can't find a way to set up normal keyboard shortcuts for navigating forwards and backwards by word.\nIn iTerm2 I have tried:\nEscape sequences such as [1;5D, [1;5C, \\033b, \\033f, etc.\nManually typing Esc, F and Esc, B does work but is very slow.  Ctrl + A for go to start of line selects all. Ctrl + <- and Ctrl + -> just produce [D and [C.\ntl;dr\n\n*\n\n*How can I autocomplete and end up with my cursor at the first\nargument instead of the end of the line?, or,\n\n*How do I set up\nkeyboard shortcuts for jumping forwards and backwards by argument in\niTerm2?\n\n\nA: For ZSH another option is to put the cursor at the beginning and not the end of the line (this makes it more like mksh or others). The default:\n% PS1='%% ' zsh -f\n% bindkey | grep up-line-or\n\"^[OA\" up-line-or-history\n\"^[[A\" up-line-or-history\n\nI use set -o vi so you may need to translate the bindkey keys into whatever suits your needs:\nbindkey -M vicmd \"j\" vi-down-line-or-history\nbindkey -M vicmd \"k\" vi-up-line-or-history\n\nno really I want to jump to the first argument\nThis requires a custom widget, which might run something like\nfunction up-line-first-arg {\n    local first offset\n    zle vi-up-line-or-history\n    first=${BUFFER%% *}\n    CURSOR+=$(( 1 + ${#first} ))\n}\nzle -N up-line-first-arg\nautoload -U up-line-first-arg\nautoload -U compinit\ncompinit\nset -o vi\nbindkey -M vicmd \"k\" up-line-first-arg\n\nThis version will put the cursor on the first argument or the end of the command name (unless there are multiple spaces between the first argument and subsequent, which is not common). Docs in zshexpn(1) and zshzle(1) may help explain the particulars, but the gist is to move up like ZSH does, get the first word (if any), and move the cursor over that length, plus one to get past the space. ZSH is clever will not move the cursor past the end of the BUFFER for the case where there is no space in the command.\nbut wait there's more\nThe following version handles (perhaps uncommon) cases such as ls               -al and on failure will put the cursor at the beginning of the line.\nfunction up-line-first-arg {\n    zle vi-up-line-or-history\n    [[ $BUFFER =~ \"^[^ ]+[ ]+\" ]] && CURSOR+=${#MATCH}\n}\n\nBasically a regular expression \"from the beginning of the BUFFER match one or more things that are not space followed by one or more things that are spaces\" and then moving the CURSOR by that much on match.\n", "Q: System mail from hbh_output Firing up the terminal today gave me a surprise, since it said I have mail.\nFor the first time in my life on a Mac I ran the mail app and it was a bounce e-mail for an unknown user:  \nFrom MAILER-DAEMON  Wed Aug 22 09:39:35 2018  \nX-Original-To: boro@Boros-MBP.local  \nDelivered-To: boro@Boros-MBP.local  \nDate: Wed, 22 Aug 2018 09:39:35 +0200 (CEST)  \nFrom: MAILER-DAEMON@Boros-MBP.local (Mail Delivery System)  \nSubject: Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender  \nTo: boro@Boros-MBP.local  \nAuto-Submitted: auto-replied  \nMIME-Version: 1.0  \nContent-Type: multipart/report; report-type=delivery-status;  \n    boundary=\"8BFCC13E86B1.1534923575/Boros-MBP.local\"  \nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit  \n\nThis is a MIME-encapsulated message.\n\n--8BFCC13E86B1.1534923575/Boros-MBP.local  \nContent-Description: Notification  \nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8  \nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit  \n\nThis is the mail system at host boros-mbp.local.\n\nI'm sorry to have to inform you that your message could not  \nbe delivered to one or more recipients.

I cranked the volume over an extended period.  Shortly thereafter, the battery of the iPod Touch could not retain a charge.  I am guessing that cranking the ghetto blaster caused damaging electrical noise to spike into the iPod Touch.  These days, I only connect media devices to the ghetto blaster via an old audio cable.\nNow I own an iPhone SE, which I'm still paying off.  I am experiencing the low charge life that iPhones are known for.  If I charge it with the car's 12V source (older cars use to have cigarette lighters in the socket but mine only has a cover), I won't get caught running out of juice when I'm on the road and needing to navigate or look things up.\nBut I am concerned about noise damaging my much more expensive iPhone.  After all, it is a car, and the power sources probably weren't designed to be steady and quiet.  Heck, I imagine starting the motor causes really causes fluctuations in the 12V, and maybe when the A/C kicks in.\nI can pick up a USB power adapter to plug into the 12V socket, and I always carry a USB-to-Lightning cable (expensive buggers).  The USB power adapter is only a few bucks at a car accessories shop, but $20 at a national electronics store chain (for a brand that isn't exactly high end).  The price difference is approximately 5-fold.  And generally, one gets what one pays for.\nI will go for the much cheaper alternative if the risk to my iPhone is minimal.  That depends on the sensitivity of the iPhone SE to gross noise on Lightning port.  I won't even say on the powering lines, as I don't know exactly how Lightning is designed, and even if there were dedicated powering lines, the adapter may inject noise on all lines.\nMy decision should also depend on how easy and typical it is to filter or block such gross noise.  I suspect that we've been charging all manner of electronics in the car for a while now.  If the technology is a commodity technology, then even cheap adapters can be expected to filter/block gross noise.  There's no way to be sure without lab-testing each product; it's more a risk assessment based on what is likely.\nI can boil the above down into two questions:\n(1) Is the iPhone SE known to be sensitive to damage from gross noise along the Lightning port?\n(2) How commoditized is the technology to block such noise in USB adapters for the 12V socket of a car?\nTruly answering this requires a comprehensive study which is probably unaffordable to most.  I am only seeking information that can narrow down my complete lack of familiarity with the topic of either question, and enable a judgement call to be made.\nNow that I've actually taken the time to describe the problem, I can't even say that the cost difference is the motivating factor. It's more the fact that I would feel far more gratified in having made a rational decision rather than just going for higher cost, which might make no difference in quality.  And if the information exists with which make a decision rather than a wild guess perhaps this might help others.\n\nA: I'm not sure how well this answers your question, but it seems the whole basis for your post is an assumption you've made about the experience you had a long time ago with an iPod Touch:\n\nI am guessing that cranking the ghetto blaster caused damaging electrical noise to spike into the iPod Touch.\n\nAs you indicate, this is just a guess and there's no way to know what the actual cause of the iPod Touch battery no longer maintaining a charge was.\nMy experience\nWhat I can tell you is that during the past 11 years:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have personally owned 6 iPhones, 3 iPads, 1 iPod and 2 Apple Watches\n\n*My family has owned 17 iPhones, 7 iPads and 5 iPods\n\n*All of the above devices were charged on a regular basis using the 12v sockets of various motor vehicles, campers or caravans\n\n*We have used a range of 12v USB power adapters ranging from about $4 to $50 in cost\n\n*We have never come across any damage to any of our devices regardless of the vehicle, socket or adapter being used\n\n\nIn all of that experience, the only damage we've noticed is that cheaper adapters and cables end up failing sooner rather than later (i.e. sometimes they just don't work, or they blow a fuse in the vehicle). However, all iPhones, iPads, iPods and Apple Watches have survived without any damage whatsoever.\nFinally, as all of these devices have internal batteries, they're less likely to suffer damage as a result of electrical noise or spikes.\n", "Q: What process is using UDP port?

It could well be that the issue has nothing to do with your keyboard and something else is at play here, but the simplest way to rule that out is to try another wireless keyboard and see what happens.\n", "Q: Disable upgrading of single-word addresses in Safari When entering a single word domain (ie. example/, http://example/ or http://example:8080), in Safari on macOS, Safari will sometimes change it to http://www.example.com. I suspect this is a feature designed to help inapt users, but it kicks in at unwanted times, and I don't want this feature!\nIt seems like this is dependent on some kind of caching (possibly DNS), so that if Safari first decides to change it, it will keep changing it no matter how many times I type it correctly. But after maybe a few hours, it will do as I expect.\nHow do I disable this pesky \"smart URL conversion\" feature?\n\nA: Here, you are actually searching for a word in your default search engine and go to the first hit. You can either type http:// before your host name or if you have control over that host name, try to change it to example.local or similar which contains a dot (.). \nAlso, after the first use if http://example to visit that page (putting http:// manually), next time you will be able to use the hostname without the hassle to put `http' first.

I have a number of issues with the keyboard:\n\n\n*\n\n*it's not very sensitive - many keystrokes get missed\n\n*if I leave the computer for a few minutes I have to wait about 10 seconds before I can use the keyboard again\n\n*it disconnects while I'm typing\n\n*the function keys are not affected by the keyboard setting in System Settings (I always have to press fn+ a function key, although the built-in keyboard is affected\n\n\nI've tried switching the keyboard off and back on again, and I've looked through System Settings, but \"Set Up Bluetooth Keyboard...\" has no options, even when the keyboard entry under \"Devices\" is double-clicked. It only has an X to remove the keyboard.\nWhat can I do to resolve these problems? I don't have another bluetooth keyboard I can swap it with.\nApparently this is how these keyboards work. See the reviews on Officeworks.\n\nA: Troubleshooting is a process of elimination and often requires patience.\nAs a starting point, I'd try to reset both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller. \nIMPORTANT: This will reset all connected Bluetooth devices, including any wireless keyboard or mouse, so they will need to be reconnected.\nBefore commencing, you will need to have the Bluetooth icon showing in the menu bar. If it is not there, open System Preferences > Bluetooth and enable the option Show Bluetooth in Menu Bar.\nResetting the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys and at the same time and click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. Once the menu is showing, release the keys.     \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu, choose Debug > Remove All Devices\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys again and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu,  choose Debug > Reset the Bluetooth Module\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Setup your keyboard again\n\n\nAfter doing the above, test your keyboard for a while to determine if it's now working better.\nIf it's not, there are other things we can try/test for on the MBP side of things. However, before doing that, the next step should be confirming the keyboard itself is okay. If possible, test the keyboard with another computer and confirm it's working okay with that. If it isn't, then replace your keyboard batteries of make sure they're fully charged and test again.\nLet me know how you go up to this point and if necessary we'll proceed further.\n", "Q: Is it normal to have same user logged in twice but from another TTY?

It's long and goes beyond what you asked, but might be interesting to you or someone else passing this page.\nIf you look at the w command's manual (man w), it says that \"The w utility prints a summary of the current activity on the system, including what each user is doing.\" That's a little vague, and a little misleading. Specifically what w does is to tell you about current logins. Logins are recorded in a file named /var/run/utmpx. There are common library methods for updating utmpx entries, so that every program that needs to record or remove a login uses the same procedure.\nw reads the utmpx file using those common library routines and displays information about current login sessions, along with the foreground process. A login session can be doing many things at once, but only one program is in the foreground. All others are background, which is what happens when you put an & on your command or press control-Z while a program runs in a terminal.\nA login session is created when you log in to your computer on the built-in display. If you have user switching enabled, a login is recorded for each user, and remains active until logout. And if you remote login (e.g. with ssh), a login is recorded for that. Each of these should appear in w's output.\nMost terminal applications, including Terminal.app and iTerm, as well as xterm if you're using X11.app, are able to create login shells in a window or tab. When you create a new window in one of these applications, you can get another login session, which appears as another line in w. But these applications don't necessarily create login shells! Whether a new window/tab is a login shell is usually controlled in the preferences. For example, in iTerm2, you can choose in Preferences > Profiles > General > Command whether to launch a login shell or some other program. If you just put \"bash\" there, you'll get a shell, but it won't be a login shell.\nSo what's the difference? It's subtle, but useful to know about.\nThere's a good discussion of login shells vs. regular shells here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/38175/difference-between-login-shell-and-non-login-shell. But we can summarize as: a login shell is started as the first process after something sets up a login in utmpx. A non-login shell can be run any time by any program, but is not the first process after an entry in utmpx. (More technically, a login shell is the lead process in a process group. The fact that it usually has a utmpx entry is descriptive, not necessary.)\nIf your shell is bash, as most are, every instance of it reads and runs the .bashrc file. When bash runs as a login shell, it also reads and runs the .bash_profile and .profile files. Those files can contain instructions that should happen only for all new sessions. That's the main practical thing to know about login shells. That, and login shells appear in w.\nHere's an experiment to illustrate. Open a new Terminal window, and run w. You should see something like:\n11:57  up 7 days, 59 mins, 5 users, load averages: 3.58 3.53 3.91\nUSER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@  IDLE WHAT\ndgc      console  -                16Aug18 7days -\ndgc      s000     -                11:57       - w\n\ns000 is the name of the terminal that you're running w in. It exists on the filesystem at /dev/ttys000. Usually there's a one to one relation between login shells and terminals, but not always.\nNow open a new Terminal window. Switch back to the first one, and run w again.\n12:09  up 7 days,  1:11, 5 users, load averages: 5.35 4.35 4.05\nUSER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@  IDLE WHAT\ndgc      console  -                16Aug18 7days -\ndgc      s000     -                11:38       - w\ndgc      s001     -                11:57       - -bash\n\nYou see a new login on s001 — /dev/ttys001 — that's running -bash. That hyphen at the beginning is a convention telling you that bash is running as a login shell. There's no foreground program in that terminal, so w shows you the shell itself.\nNow switch back to your second window and run bash. What do you expect to happen?\n12:13  up 7 days,  1:14, 5 users, load averages: 5.61 5.07 4.41\nUSER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@  IDLE WHAT\ndgc      console  -                16Aug18 7days -\ndgc      s000     -                11:38       - w\ndgc      s001     -                11:57       - bash\n\nThe hyphen is gone. That's because the same login session (terminal) is now running, in the foreground, a shell that isn't a login shell. It's a child of the original -bash. If you flip back and type exit to quit the child bash, you'll see the -bash again.\nFinally, note the console login. That one will never change in ordinary use. It's running the desktop/window system usually. If you turn on your Mac and don't log in, but then you ssh in from another computer, you won't see that line at all. It will always appear idle, and will always appear to be running nothing — except with the hyphen, because it's a login session.\nWhen a program that created a login session ends that login, it goes back and removes the entry from utmpx using the common library methods for it. And because utmpx resides in the /var/run directory, it gets automatically removed whenever your computer reboots — so if you suddenly powered off your Mac while logged in, you don't continue to see fake logins forever.\n\nA: The default Terminal app in macOS opens up a second login so when who or w command is executed the Terminal app, there's a second login.\nDepending on your environment and the Terminal app, some terminal emulation apps like iTerm2 will show only one login.\n\nA: Yes it is normal.\nConsole is your desktop login and the second login appears after you open a Terminal window. In-fact if you have more than one Terminal window/tab open, an entry is shown corresponding to each.\n\nA: Yes it's normal. If you use a terminal multiplexer like tmux or screen, each 'tab' will be a separate user session.\n", "Q: Is it possible to reverse the position of the number and emoji keyboards?

The only resort is to indirectly use an app which can be accessed on both platforms.\nTo keep things simple, you can login to iCloud using a Web browser on Windows PC and paste links, text snippets and images into Notes app. The pasted content can be instantly accessed in Notes app on your iPhone.\nBoth Windows PC and iPhone need to be connected to Internet, not necessarily to the same Wi-Fi. (both of them can be technically anywhere in the world)\n", "Q: How to change MacBook jack only input instead of input and output I have a lavalier microphone with 3 pins that I connected to my MacBook.

At times, I need to log into Notes for iCloud via a Web browser (using another Mac, PC or Linux box) using the web application to access my notes without the usual apps.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.icloud.com/#notes2\nWhile I am easily able to add an image in Notes for iOS (by inserting) and Notes for macOS (by dragging), I couldn't find a way to add images to a note using Notes for iCloud Web interface.\nIs it possible to add an image (using a desktop file explorer app) to Notes for iCloud web app?\nTo clarify, I am looking for a way to add image(s) from a public/non-personal computer where I don't have access to my iPhone, iPad or Mac. Only possible way to access notes in this case is via iCloud web site.\n\nA: As per the current implementation, it is not possible to attach images and any other file/media supported by Notes app on macOS/iOS via the iCloud Web client.\nThere is no control in the Notes Web app UI to attach images/supported files, neither does dragging and dropping image(s) work.\nAlthough the lack of feature is not directly mentioned, the help document for Notes for iCloud Web (accessed by tapping the ? in the header area) makes a cursory remark about requiring macOS/iOS device for attaching items.\n\n\n\nA: It appears the only way to add images to a note from the web browser is copy and pasting from a different note. \nI know this is a horrible answer but its the only thing that is seemingly possible.\n\nA: Only way I do it (in my bootcamp partition-so same computer) is to save the clipping on a shared disk, make a marker in my note about the screenshot and\nwhen in MacOS I go to the shared disk and note and drag them in the note at the right place.\nHorrible workflow I know, but having to move on, it's the closest to a workflow I have found.\nShame on Apple for not providing a better integration.\nI want to keep my notes (at the moment) in the notes app but might consider a cross platform (with synchronisation to iphone, mac, Ipad) if that should at all exist!\n", "Q: Adding a new directory to PATH varibale What is the de-facto way to export a binary/executable to my global PATH? I have seen different answers to this, but I am looking for the best answer. \nBasically, if I go on Github and download a directory or folder and then I want to add whatever I download to my PATH, what is the recommended way to do that, so that I can echo it in any shell?\n\nA: If you want to one line it (which I find more convenient):\necho 'export PATH=$PATH:\"/path/to/your/dir\"' >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile\n\nof course you can change this to your preferences (ie. append or prepend to $PATH, .bashrc, .bash_profile, .zshrc, etc.)\n\nA: Add the directory in PATH variable in ~/.bashrc file. When an interactive, non-login shell is started, ~/.bashrc is executed. That means ~/.bashrc is executed for every new tab/window opened in Terminal.app.\nSimply add this line in your ~/.bashrc file:\nPATH=$PATH:~/DirectoryName\nPATH=~/DirectoryName:$PATH\n\nas per your preference. If the directory name is prepended, any system executable of similar name may get shadowed.\nTo execute ~/.bashrc and get the new PATH in effect without restarting terminal, execute:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nAlso, make sure to enter this line in your ~/.bash_profile\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc ] ; then\n    . ~/.bashrc\nfi\n\n", "Q: Zsh vs Bash shell in Terminal Are there any advantages to using zsh vs bash shell in Terminal app? Also, can you use zsh from the terminal? My understanding of zsh is skewed.\n\nA: The Z shell (Zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. \nZsh is an extended Bourne shell with a large number of improvements, including some features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh.\nI may suggest you to install Zsh with framework for fancy managing your zsh environment and switch to iTerm2 for excellent terminal\nreplacement.\nInstall zsh using Homebrew:\nbrew install zsh\n\nSwitch current user from bash to zsh shell:\nchsh -s $(which zsh)\n\nNext install one of popular shell framework like Oh My Zsh or Prezto.\nI like Oh My Zsh, so:\nsh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"\n\nDownload iTerm2 and after unpack .zip file, run it.\n\nA: \nAre there any advantages to using zsh vs bash?\n\nBoth have their own unique set of features. It's upto you to choose a shell. Bash is the default login shell set for users in macOS whereas zsh is also available.\n\ncan you use zsh from the terminal?\n\nYes. Simply type zsh in Terminal to start Zsh shell. You can also set zsh as your default shell by going to System Preferences app → Users & Groups right click on your account name and choose Advanced Options....\n\n\nChoice of shell is a subjective matter. However, if you are a command line newbie, it's recommended to stick with Bash shell.\n", "Q: Unable to log into new installation of macOS High Sierra I recently installed macOS High Sierra on my MacBook Air.

When I connect the iPhone to iTunes on my PC, I can see the iPhone. But when I try to drag-and-drop an audiobook onto the phone, nothing happens (not even a \"prohibited\") warning.\n\n\n*\n\n*The iTunes version is current (12.8). \n\n*iTunes is set for manual synching. \n\n*The iPhone has enough space for an audiobook or books.\n\n*The iPhone does not have a SIM card.\nWhat can I do to transfer an audiobook file to the iPhone?\n\nA: Audiobooks doesn't automatically sync to iPhone upon connecting to iTunes. Neither can they be added to iPhone by simple drag and drop. Follow the steps mentioned below to get your audiobook on your iPhone. The key here is getting your audiobooks playing in iTunes before you attempt to sync them. If they don’t play in iTunes, this won’t work well.\nThe steps demonstrate the procedure using iTunes for macOS and should be similar when using iTunes running on Windows. If someone can upload windows screen shots, that might make a nice addition to the end of this procedure.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have added the audiobooks into iTunes library or have downloaded the purchased audiobooks from the iTunes Store. You can check the same by selecting the Audiobooks dropdown in iTunes window. Play the tracks to be sure they work on the computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your Mac/PC via USB or WiFi. Once connected, iPhone button shows itself alongside the Audiobooks dropdown. Your iPhone is also shown in the sidebar.

The sync progress will then begin - based on the size, it can take minutes or an hour or more. You can interrupt the sync - when iTunes is running and the phone connected, the sync will resume until it’s done.\n\n\n\n*Voila! Your audiobooks are now synced to your iPhone. Don't forget to eject your iPhone by pressing the eject button shown besides your phone's icon in the sidebar towards the top.\n\n*You'll need to make sure sufficient space in available in your iPhone.

I am sure it's not just one language, but is there one language that is common throughout most of these binaries that come with the system?\n\nA: macOS is built on BSD which is a Unix like operating system.\nThe Unix operating system and the C language were created simultaneously. Many of the commands have evolved over time but usually have remain written in the C language. The libraries and the Unix operating system is also written in C.\nThe C language is probably the closest high level language that actual resembles machine instructions. This allows Unix to be ported to new processor architectures with minimal effort. In other words, the optimizations were originally provided by the author's of the code and did not rely on compiler specific optimizations with respect to a particular processor architecture. \nNote: Gordon Davisson has pointed out in a comment:\n\n... macOS includes a lot more than just its Unix core, and a lot of the Apple-added software is written in other languages, like Objective-C, Swift, and a plethora of other languages. \n\n", "Q: How to get rid of system is low in storage space notification (MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6) The solutions posted here at: Silencing \"Your disk is almost full\" notification\ndon't seem to work anymore, for me. \nIn particular, when I do \n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/StorageManagement.framework/Versions/A/Resources/diskspaced help\n\nI get \n2018-08-24 15:57:33.461 diskspaced[8330:542479] Domain: com.apple.diskspaced\nSupported keys:\n2018-08-24 15:57:33.463 diskspaced[8330:542479] debugLog (BOOL) - log additional debug information.

I know that macOS comes preinstalled on Macbooks, but hypothetically speaking, if you had to install it, what is going on behind the scenes between machine code and CPU/quantum mechanics. \n\nA: Each platform comes with one or more specific platform binary interfaces that define how operating systems (or stand-alone programs that are not operating systems) must be structured. \nThe first run parts of an operating system is generally defined in binary machine code. The CPU will read the machine code, divide it into instructions and carry out those instructions. The instructions make up the operating system.\nAll operating systems running on a specific platform must abide to the same (or a small number of) binary platform interface. They again offer an application binary interface (ABI) to user programs running on top of the operating system. The ABI is a mix of the platform binary interface and specific requirements for that specific operating system. Some operating systems offers multiple ABIs.\nA platform in these terms is a combination of a CPU architecture and model and various peripherals (for example a platform could be a Mac with an Intel x64 CPU, UEFI firmware interface, etc.).\n\nA: The CPU is running a program. The binary contains data read by this program. Based on the values of the 1's and 0's in this data, the program (running inside the CPU) determines where to transfer data from various storage locations inside and outside of the CPU. Many of the transfers pass the data through logic which perform operations. Addition and multiplication are examples of such operations. There is much addition hardware beyond just the CPU. This additional hardware operates in parallel with the CPU to transfer the data to and from various peripherals.\n", "Q: Not able to mount EFI partition with diskutil after installing Ubuntu I installed Ubuntu as dualboot for a specific task to a 30 GB partition.

I have no issues now.\n\nA: This answer would require another computer and a flash drive. Also, you would have to either remove the internal drive or have have the ability to connect the Mac to another Mac in target disk mode.\n\nNote: I assume your Mac has only one internal drive, so the flash drive would be disk1.\n\nBTW: I tested what I could using my 2011 iMac with macOS 10.13.6.\nThe boot manager rEFInd can disable SIP. Also, rEFInd can be configured to boot in text only mode. \n\n\n*\n\n*You would need another computer to download the rEFInd zip file. Look for the link A USB flash drive image file. On my Mac, downloading created a folder named refind-flashdrive-0.11.3 in my Downloads folder.\n\n*Next you would use the dd command to transfer the rEFInd image to the flash drive. I used the commands given below. Here, I assume the refind-flashdrive-0.11.3.img  file is in the ~/Downloads/refind-flashdrive-0.11.3 folder.\ncd ~/Downloads/refind-flashdrive-0.11.3\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk1\nsudo dd if=refind-flashdrive-0.11.3.img of=/dev/disk1\n\n\n*Mount the EFI partition on the flash drive. For macOS, the command is given below.\nsudo diskutil mount disk1s1\n\n\n*Add the following lines to the end of the refind.conf file. This will cause rEFInd to boot in text only mode. You can read the refind.conf file for more information. I choose a value of 2 arbitrarily.\ntextonly\ntextmode 2\n\n\n*Plug the flash drive into your Mac.\n\n*I assume you can not use the Mac Startup Manager because this would require a graphics mode display. However, if you assume the default item in the menu is first, then you can select to boot from the USB flash drive without using the screen. Follow this procedure: \nA. Restart the Mac and immediately hold down the option key. This will invoke the Startup Manager. You will have to hold the key down until you assume the Startup Manager is running.\nB. Press the ← key once. This should select the last item on the Startup Manager menu. The USB flash drive will always be the last item.\nC. Press the return to boot from the USB flash drive. \nIf the computer does not boot from the flash drive, then try pressing the ← key more than once.\n\n*When the rEFInd menu appears, select Change SIP Policy, then press return key.\n\n*Wait for the screen to flash.\n\n*Select About rEFInd to confirm SIP is disabled.\n", "Q: Apple Watch is not recognising any activity. What is the problem? I have the original Apple Watch(I bought it as soon as it was released in 2015). I have now realised that it is not tracking any of my activity data, and that it displays 0 for all of the 3 categories, even after a day of running and exercise. How can I resolve this issue?\n\nA: Unpair your watch from your phone and re-pair it. It will reset the watch.\nGo into the Watch app on your phone, tap your watch at the top of the app screen, tap the \"i\" button, then tap Unpair Watch.\nAfter this is complete, re-pair the watch to your phone and see if your issues are resolved.\nIf that doesn't work, you may need to call Apple support or take it in to the Genius Bar.\n", "Q: What would happen if I plug in two USB-C power supplies into the same Mac? Would it charge faster? I have a bunch of USB-C power supplies (some at different wattages).\nWould my Mac charge faster (or blow up) if I plug two power supplies into the same computer (different USB-C slots)\n\nA: No.\nYour MacBook will charge from the one which provides higher power. Quoting from the Apple support document, Connect with Thunderbolt 3 on your new MacBook Pro:\n\nNotes on charging your MacBook Pro:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Your MacBook Pro draws power from only one power supply, even if more than one is attached—so using multiple power supplies won't speed up charging.\n  \n*If you connect multiple power supplies to your MacBook Pro, the one that provides the most power will be used, regardless of the order in which you connected them.\n  \n*You shouldn't connect any power supply that exceeds 100W, as it might damage your MacBook Pro. Also, using a power supply that doesn't provide sufficient power can result in slow or delayed charging. It's best to use the power supply that came with your Mac.\n\n", "Q: How to get an application executable path from Terminal In macOS, applications can be launched from the command line with open -a < application name>.\nI would like to know if there is a command that returns the executable within \nthe application bundle, when the application is not running, I'm hoping for something like this:\nawesomeCommand <application name>\n/Applications/***/MacOS/Content/application_executable\n\n\nA: Not exactly a single command but I can give you the steps to get the information. This information is from Apple's Bundle Programming guide.\nYou need to know the structure of an Application.\nIn its root directory is has a directory Contents. In that directory there is a directory MacOS which contains application’s standalone executable code and a file Info.plist\nInfo.plist is a plist formatted file that contains info about the application including the name of the main executable file. This name is the value corresponding to the key CFBundleExecutable.\nThus the algorithim to find the applications starting executable is\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the application\n\n*Find the Contents directory of the application \n\n*Read the Info.plist file getting the value of CFBundleExecutable\n\n*the executable is in the MacOs directory of 2 and is named the result of 3.\n\n\nNote steps 1 and 3 are non trivial and require calls to Apple's system libraries \n\nA: \nI would like to know if there is a command that returns the executable within the application bundle\n\nThere is no such command, but I've written a shell script that does exactly that for any application bundle in the file system of your startup disk.\nIt uses several command line tools included in macOS and leverages Apple's documentation on Launch Services, Application Bundles and Core Foundation Keys. The script does the following:\n\n*\n\n*It searches /Applications for the app bundle.\n\n*If the app bundle can not be found there, the script queries the Launch Services database, only considering app bundles on the startup disk.\n\n*If an app bundle is found, the script inspects the bundle's Info.plist and looks for a key namedCFBundleExecutable. This key stores the executable file (see below in the background information section for more on that). Otherwise, print an error message an exit.\n\n*Prints the path to the executable to standard output.\n\nThe script understands both an application name with or without its extension, checks arguments, displays a usage message and a short description if run without arguments and returns an exit status with an error message if necessay.\nSince the script searches /Applications and may do a time-consuming query to Launch Services, it isn't super fast (from ~ 1 sec to several seconds), but it was 100% accurate in my tests.\nThis is the script, with explanations on what is done in every step:\n#!/bin/bash\n# https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/334635\n# Variables    \napp_name=\"\";\napp_path_and_name=\"\";\npath_to_lsregister=\"/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/\";\n\n# If run without arguments, issue a usage summary and exit\nif [[ \"$1\" == \"\" ]];

Which is interesting to me, because I don't understand why people want to use the display to HDMI instead of using thunderbolt USB-c port natively instead. Before I get to this...I shall ask my question.\nI plan on buying a MacBook Pro-2018 15 inch for my home-based business. I need to connect 3 monitors to this laptop. I understand the 15 inch MacBook Pro comes with 4 thunderbolts 3 ports. I plan to buy 3 24-27 inch monitors that are 4k display. Also, I understand that the charger for this laptop uses a Thunderbolt 3 port, which leaves me with 3 left. Will connecting 3 monitors that have Thunderbolt 3 ports leave me with performance issues? Will the refresh rate lower?\nFinally, why do I see a lot of post with people using old 2.0 display port to HDMI; why they can use Thunderbolt 3 port natively?\n\nA: From the MacBook Pro Technical Specs page:\n\nSimultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display at millions of colors and:\nUp to two displays with 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors.\nUp to four displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz at over a billion colors.\n\nAs per Apple, you should be fine with upto 4 4K display.\n\nA: Yes, you can connect 3 x 4k-monitors to the 2018 15\" MacBook Pro - and yes, you can use USB-C to DisplayPort cables to connect the monitors.\nDoing it this way will take up 3 of the 4 ports, leaving one available for charging, as you describe.\nYou will not suffer from lower refresh rates, nor \"performance issues\" as such that are specifically related to connecting the 3 displays in this manner.\nYou'll often see people using docks or other adapters to allow connecting multiple displays to a single Thunderbolt 3 port - leaving more ports available for other things, and simplifying connecting the displays when docking/undocking. In this case, the docks often offer HDMI ports instead of DisplayPort.\n\nA: Reading this guide may help you:\nHow To: Run External Displays with your USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 MacBook\nIt helped me a lot, although the guide is from a dockstation manufacturer, it's somehow neutral, and addresses in a practical way the different scenarios that we can face when we want to work with multiple screens in our MacBook Pro, either using a single cable solution or with the help of a dock station.\nMine is a 15\" MacBook Pro w/TouchBar and I have three 4K connected screens, two using a single port each, and the third is using a tethered dock that even provides power to charge my laptop.\n\nA: For anyone trying to do this using a dock that has multiple display outputs, the MacBook Pro 2018 only has two thunderbolt busses, but 4 ports (2 ports per bus), as a result, if you try to connect three external monitors, you will need to use different sides of the device.\nIf you try to connect all three monitors into two ports on one side, it won't work.\n\nA: I currently use 3 4k displays (Dell P2715Q) on a MacBook Pro 15\" 2017 (GPU: Radeon Pro 560 4096 MB). \nTwo monitors are connected to the right side ports/bus and the third one (plus a dock for charging/USB/etc) are connected to left side ports/bus. The monitors are arranged in a \"H-shape\" with two monitors flipped 90 degrees.\nI've had this setup for about 6 months now and while it is usable, I do face some issues from time to time, always after waking up the monitors after sleeping overnight:\n\n\n*\n\n*The orientation (90 degree rotation setting) tends to get messed up in two of the three monitors and I have to waste 1-2 minutes fixing it on System Preferences > Displays. The cause for this likely a software/compatibility issue on macOS and I have had this on a two monitor setup as well.\n\n*Every now and then the ONE of the monitors connected to the right bus fails and I can't make BOTH work again without a system reboot. By repeatedly disconnecting/reconnecting the mDP cables I can get EITHER of them to work, but often not BOTH simultaneously, which is pretty annoying. I feel like this is a hardware issue, perhaps GPU memory issue, but more likely something to do with the Thunderbolt bus bandwidth as it always happens to the bus that has 2 monitors attached to it and never to the one that has only a single monitor attached to.\n\n\nTL;DR: It is possible but be prepared for some minor issues and eventual monitor \"loss\" followed by a system reboot.\n\nA: I just installed a driver from https://www.displaylink.com and plugged this recent Macbook Pro into a Dell D6000 docking station via a single USB C (not Thunderbolt) cable that my colleague is using for his Dell.  All three monitors worked and the Macbook got power.  I was able to drag a single window across the built-in display and the three monitors, one monitor at a time.\nI didn't check anything else like resolution, refresh, etc.  What's interesting, though, is that everything I've read indicates that a single USB C 3.1 or Thunderbolt port should drive only two monitors, but this does three.  Weird.\n** Note: The DisplayLink driver does not support Night Shift on macOS. **\n", "Q: Is Aperture compatible with High Sierra upgrade process?

One of the Container's Physical Store disks will be\nresized, and therefore the Container which it defines will be resized by an\nequal amount. You do this by specifying a new Container size; to preview the\ncurrent available range, you can instead specify \"limits\"; no change will be\nmade. A new size of zero is taken as a request to do a grow-to-fit operation.\nIf the new size implies a shrink, you can specify ordered triples in the same\nmanner as `diskutil partitionDisk`, etc, to fill the partition map's free\nspace gap that would otherwise result. If there is more than one Physical Store\nand you specify a Container Reference, the appropriate Physical Store will be\nchosen automatically. Ownership of the affected disks is required, and all of\nthe Container's Volumes must be unencrypted or unlocked.\nExample:  diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk5 110g\n          diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 110g\n          diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk5 0\n          diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk5 1.5t jhfs+ foo 10g ms-dos BAR 0\n\n", "Q: Can I upgrade my Mid 2014 Mac SSD?

Big mistake!\nNow the computer does not turn on any more.\nDo you have any suggestion to fix that in Recovery Mode or Single-User Mode?\n\nA: If I guess correctly you probably entered the line:\n* * * * * /sbin/shutdown\n\nin the root crontab with the command crontab -e when in priviledged mode (running as root).\nThe simplest way to get out of this shutdown every minute is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your Mac in single-user mode:\nimmediatly after powering it on, hold on ⌘+S until you get white text on a black screen.\n\n*Once you see the shell prompt, beware: you are root, everything you type might destroy your system, enter the following command:\n/sbin/mount -uw /\n\n(== remount the / filesystem in write mode) so as to be able to modify the root crontab  which is on the / filesystem\n/usr/bin/crontab -e\n\nwhich will let you edit your root crontab file, go to the line containing exactly (it might be the uniq line):\n* * * * * /sbin/shutdown\n\nand an editor should open (from memory, it should be vi but\nI'm only 50% sure) delete it (in vi: dd), save your file and exit(in vi: :wq).\n\n*Type /sbin/reboot to restart your system without the deadful crontab line.\n\nA: Yes - boot to recovery HD or OS and then look for the terminal utility in the menu. You will be able to edit the crontab file to remove that entry and chill out the over active shutdown process.\nEven easier would be to boot your Mac in target disk mode and edit the file from another Mac that’s running and can connect to your storage as if it’s an external drive.\nWorst case, you can restore from a backup before the system got the wrong instructions you didn’t realize would be painful. There’s going to be no data loss since you can’t work on anything after this change was made.

This does not mean the operating system was Windows. \nAccording to everyman.com a 2009 MacBook was shipped with OS X 10.5.6, OS X 10.5.7 or OS X 10.6.1 preinstalled. You did not provide enough information to determine which 2009 MacBook model your have. Apple does not provide enough information to determine which version of Snow Leopard you would be buying. One can assume this would be OS X 10.6.x, but what x is I do not know. You would have to ask to Apple. I assume you are buying a DVD and that your DVD drive works. The idea was to install Snow Leopard from the DVD, then download and install the Mac OS X 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1. Next, you can download and install El Capitan from the Apps Store.

What should i do? Please help! \n\nA: When troubleshooting charging issues, I would do the following (in order):\n\n\n*\n\n*Always try another Lightning cable and charger, preferably Apple\noriginal or MFi certified units.(You've already tried this, go to\nthe next step)\n\n*The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_(connector)|Lightning\ncable 8-pin connector] should be sitting flush with the housing and\ncompletely inserted. If it is not, there could be lint/dust/debris\ninside the port impeding a proper connection. You can clean it out\nwith fine point tweezers or a dental pick. Just be careful not to\ndamage the pins inside the Lightning Port.\n\n*Change the battery. The battery is the weakest link in the entire\ndevice and certainly for charger related issues. Unfortunately, it's\na not a trivial repair on an iPad. If you can get the device to boot,\nthe use a battery utility, such as coconutBattery (for Mac) or\n3uTools (for Windows) to test the battery prior to removal. Anything\nless than 70% of design capacity will require replacement.\n\n*If the battery is in good condition, you can use a USB Ammeter to determine if the phone is really drawing current when it says it's charging. If it isn't drawing current, then I would change the Lightning/Charge Port. This is also a non-trivial repair as it requires some micro-soldering.\nIf a new battery and charge port still don't resolve the issue, then you either have faulty replacement parts (possible) or a logic board issue. \nIf you are up to the challenge of opening your iPad, then there is an IC (commonly referred to as Tristar) responsible for communicating with the charging device and uncertified chargers can damage it. Unplug the battery and connect a known-good (preferably Apple original or MFi) charger to the device. A properly working device will show an Apple logo and boot loop. If the Tristar IC is bad then the device will not do anything.\nBecause you have critical data, you can't just bring this to the Apple store because they will only offer you a replacement device. If you need to save this data, then follow the steps outlined above or find an independent repair shop to do some tests. If the problem is at the logic board level, then a shop that does micro-soldering repairs may be able to save your device or your data.\n", "Q: How to script a global keyboard shortcut in MacOS I want to configure a global keyboard shortcut in MacOS using a script. \nSpecifically, I want to set the \"Move focus to next window\" to ⌘⇧§ (since I have a Swedish keyboard and the default ⌘⇧` has a tendency to insert backquotes all over the place)\nSo I want the setting to end up like this \nI have tried this command\ndefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ \"Move focus to next window\"=\"@§\"; }'\n\nInspired by this and this instruction.

I have nine Linux virtual machines on a server on which scripts run nightly to do for example, MySQL dumps and to tarball up attachment directories on my Atlassian servers.  The resulting backups are then secure copied across to the Mac overnight, and of course, they're then part of the 'TimeMachine' backup and three times weekly, I swap out an external drive to which the most recent deltas are copied, and take that into my office to sit in my drawer.  \nIt's a bit of a 'clunky' solution that has grown up over the years as my knowledge has increased.  \nTwo days ago, I installed a new VM to run zabbix and that's working well.  This meant, of course, the installation of the zabbix agent on all of the Linux machines, and I went all out and got it running on the Mac, too. \nThis morning, I get an e-mail from the Atlassian server, telling me that it could not scp the backups across, as the host key had changed, and warned me that there may be a 'man in the middle attack'.  There wasn't, of course, as only one of my servers is public-facing, and that sits behind one firewall, has firewalld running on it and sends all traffic into the network through a small standalone RHEL server on which firewalld is running.   But I follow the advice of the e-mail, and I go to the /home/darren/.ssh/known_hosts file and remove the 'offending' line.   Just to be sure, I check the backup script, verify that it's using the correct key files (it is - $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa), and run a bare ssh to the Mac.  Boom - connected instantly.  \nI run the backup script manually on the Atlassian server, and rather than transferring the file to the Mac, I get.. \nPermission denied (publickey).\nlost connection\n\nI decide to hose the private and public keypair and create another pair.

At the same time as I had installed the zabbix VM, I had also decided to put the /etc/hosts file under ansible control.  So every night, the /etc/hosts file was pushed out from the Mac, to all of the Linux VMs.  Except that at the top of that file on the Mac was.. \n127.0.0.1 macos.invalid.com\nSo when the Linux VMs came to do their nightly backups, the script told them to scp the tarballs to 'macos.invalid.com' which they of course considered as 'localhost'. \nDefinite 'duhhh!!' moment.\nSorry to have taken your time.  That'll teach me to mess with ansible (which, in my defence, does a host of other stuff on my network without causing problems!)...\n", "Q: Screenshot the entire web-page In macOS, one can easily get a screen capture by using key combination Command + Shift + 4.\nBut, are there any keyboard shortcuts that can scroll a webpage or any other pages and get the screen capture?\nI am looking for a keyboard shortcut and not an app or browser extension that needs to be downloaded from the Internet or Mac App Store.\n\nA: Run brew install webkit2png and then run a command like this:\nwebkit2png -F -W 1280 https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/334689/screenshot-entire-web-page\n\n-F creates a full-size screenshot. -W changes the width of the browser window (the default is 800).\n\nA: Safari now has a ScreenCapture feature built-in, as explained in the article Full Page Screenshots in Browsers:\n\nIn Safari DevTools, select a node, right-click, and you'll see Capture Screenshot in the context menu.\n\nThere isn't a keyboard shortcut AFAIK, but it is available without additional third-party software. To capture the entire page, you would right-click on the <html> or <body> node, as demonstrated in this image from the CSS-Tricks article:\n\n\nA: Understanding the OP doesn’t want third party tools, many others will want this, so there are a couple of easy ways to do this using a mac. \n\n\n*\n\n*Paparazzi! app - opens a window. Just paste the URL to capture the entire web page. The File menu has \"Save Image As\" to save the whole web page. With tools like folder actions, you can then print, file, or do whatever you wish with the images.\n\n*Web sites provide this service as well - no software required. One is web-capture.net. Also, paste your URL to receive an image type of your choosing. This easily prints or downloads as a zip file. \n\n*Awesome Screen Capture is an extension that provides a simple way to capture the entire website. \n\nA: Update: Safari introduced a feature accessible via the developer tools, which lets users capture screenshot of the entire webpage. This feature was not available at the time the answer was written. The original answer is kept as is for reference.\nFor Safari, refer to the answer by shawncampbell.\n\nBut, are there any keyboard shortcuts that can scroll a webpage or any other pages and get the screen capture?\n\nNo, there's no built-in mechanism in Safari/macOS to scroll and screenshot an entire webpage.\nYou'll either need to manually scroll, snap and stitch the images or write a script, both of which could be cumbersome.\nYou can do a Web search and find 3rd party Safari extensions that can perform this function for you, but again that's not what you are looking for.\nIf you relax the scope and are willing to download a software from the Internet, you can install Mozilla Firefox, a popular alternative Web browser for macOS. A screenshot tool, aptly named Firefox Screenshots is natively built into the web browser.\nDownload and install Firefox, open the desired Web page, click on the Page actions button in the address bar and select Take a Screenshot option.\n\nYou can choose between capturing the entire page,just the visible area or a specific region within the visible area.\n\nWhat's great is that you can choose between downloading the generated image right away or save them online for later access (Do note that as per the linked support article, screenshots are saved for 14 days only). You can also copy the image directly to the clipboard or edit it in the browser itself.\n\nHere's the Ask Different Web page in it's full glory :)\n\nIn my opinion, this is the most hassle free approach one can take to screenshot a Web page in macOS.\n\nA: I managed to take the entire page image of the website (on Safari) by clicking through: File > Export as PDF.\nThough not PNG, the PDF did the job for me, since all I really wanted was some form of the capture of the entire webpage.... best!\n\nA: No. Safari on macos 10.13 and lower doesn’t have this function to scroll and snap and paste and stitch together pages so this isn’t possible. Making a shortcut for an official function is trivial and you could automate everything with a smart enough script and then trigger your tool, but you’re back to adding a third party program at that point. \nBest is to perhaps explore if saving as pdf works for you after trying reading mode. Those would be far less work to script into a shortcut or two. \nThat being said, there are dozens of great options and tools to do this - some as simple as choosing an alternate browser than the one that ships with macOS. As great as Safari is for some things, choice is the blessing of a computer OS like macOS to allow more tools to be made to run on that platform.\n\nA: There is another flexible while mostly unwieldy way to do this.\n1. recording your all page content with quicktime and save it to a video file\n2. export frames as images from the video file with final cut pro x\n3. combine all images into a lengthy panorama with photoshop, namely the full screenshot of the page\n", "Q: Can't navigate to folder alias on server in the save window After upgrading to macOS High Sierra, I can't save a file to the alias of a folder in the open/save dialog box on a server.\nWhen browsing to the folder I want to save the file to, the folder aliases are greyed out, this problem doesn't occur on previous versions of macOS or when the folder alias isn't located on a server.\nHow do I resolve this issue?\n\nA: I have the same problem and haven't found an answer yet.\nThe Problem: aliases and symlinks on the server are disabled in file dialogs for apps running from clients. Sole exception I've found is Apple's TextEdit on client, which can navigate through aliases that are on the server (with file dialog for open but not for save). Every other app, apple and otherwise, that I've tried on clients, including latest Apple Pages (version 7.1 (5683)) and Safari (Version 11.1.2 (13605.3.8)), find aliases on the server to be greyed out and disabled in file dialog windows, for both open and save. Aliases on the server work fine when double-clicked in Finder by clients.\nThis happens on server running macOS Sierra (10.12.6) with Server.app 5.3.1, and on server running macOS High Sierra (10.13.6) with Server.app 5.6.1.\nClient macs are all running macOS High Sierra (10.13.6).\nThings that work:\n\n\n*\n\n*An alias that is ON the client can point to a file on the server: apps on the client such as pages can use that alias in a file dialog to get to the remote folder.\n\n*An alias that is on the server can be used in file dialogs by apps on the server.\n\n\nMy tests so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*From client mac, make alias on the server for a folder on the server. Pages and Safari on client find that alias grey (unusable) in file dialog.\n\n*On server, make alias on the server for a folder on the server. Safari on server can follow the alias (which appears active, not grey) in a file dialog. Safari on a client can NOT follow the alias, which appears grey and unusable in file dialog.\n\n\nA: Did anyone find a solution to this? This sounds like the same basic problem we've been having since upgrading to Monterey, but we skipped several versions in between.\nIn addition to aliases being grayed out from app Save/Open dialogs, they also function improperly in the Finder. Instead of acting as a pointer, it acts as a file. Eg, an alias to a folder needs to be double-clicked to open it (which then jumps back to the original file path, so it does no good as an alias for navigation purposes). An alias to a file acts as a file type; eg, an image in a layout linked to an alias won't work because it reads as a non-image file.\nAliases in the server environment have become essentially worthless with this upgrade. They still function as always on the local desktop, however.\n", "Q: Custom icons disappeared from folders in Home directory I reinstalled macOS couple days back, I found that I couldn't have a capitalized user/home folder anymore (Gio became gio). I'm used to having it with a capital.\nLooked around online for a bit finding a way to change it using the root user. I reboot everything is all working well - permission are correct (as far as I noticed).\nAfter updating the username, I notice that the Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Home, Pictures, Music etc. folders in the Home directory doesn't have their custom sidebar and folder icons anymore.\nDoes anybody know how I can fix this?\n\n\nA: A possible reason for this behaviour can be that the Home folder isn't set correctly for the user.\nLaunch System Preferences app and open Users & Groups pane. Click on the lock icon towards the bottom and enter admin password. Now right click on your user and select Advanced Options... from the context menu. In the pane presented verify if the Home directory is set correctly. You can click on the Choose... button to easily browse to and select the Home directory.\n\nIt is recommended to restart the system after making the changes to restore the sanity.\n", "Q: Fixed GPU-deactivation but Wi-Fi is not working and textmode remains After\nGPU-defect Macbook Pro 2011 does not accept csrutil disable anymore (10.13.6)\nSo… this worked quiet well. I was able to deactivate SIP with the stick. Then I realised that my OS and Start Volume still contained data so I had to delete it and reinstall macOS. For some reason my Wi-Fi wasn't working anymore (no symbol on the top right). So I had to install macOS with a ethernet cable. After the installation I trief to continue the tutorial:\n(GPU problem - Boot Hangs on Grey Screen… )\nwith Part 2: \"Improve thermal and power management\"\nBut the kext was not found so I assumed that with my reinstall it got lost.\nSo I reseted the NVRAM and went through the process again. It worked and I did everything until part \"Preventive measures for future use\". But why is my wireless still not working and not even appearing on my top right? \nAnd is it right that when I boot all these \"white texts of black screen\" are appearing before the apple logo? Can/should I deactivate this? But a big thanks already!\n\nA: Partial answer addressing the \"textmode\" (verbose boot) problem:\nWhat you called \"textmode\" in an earlier version of your question is really the verbose boot mode. There is nothing special or malicious or negative about it. Within the tutorial it is just employed to make it easier to get to know immediately the point of failure during boot should anything go wrong with the tutorial.\nIf you followed the tutorial it is to expected to be there. If everything works and if you do not like the aesthetics of it:\ntype in Terminal:\n  nvram -p\n\nthat should output something like: \n boot-args  -v \n\nTo get rid of this \"textmode\", you need tot type \nsudo nvram boot-args=\" \"\n\nConfirm its deletion with another nvram -p and see thge parameter -v for the boot-args gone. Next boot should then be graphical again.\n\nA: Is Show WiFi status in the menu bar checked off in the Network pane of System Preferences?\n\n", "Q: Right side of Earpod dead but the buttons are functioning. How to troubleshoot? Okay,the jack is plugged in properly. The problem is, while the audio is coming from the left Earbud, the right Earbud is dead. However, in Apple earpods, the controller (volume and on-off button) is in the right wire. This suggests, that the right side is getting the current. But, no audio is coming out. It was working fine all this morning, I listened to songs but since the evening, the right side is dead. Can you suggest a troubleshoot? \n\nA: If you're still in your first year or have Applecare on your device you got the earpods with, call Applecare, they will set you up with a replacement pair.\n\nA: The controls use the same wire as the microphone, which is independent from the right earbud. Most likely the problem lies in a disconnection in the right earbud itself.\n", "Q: Whole drive gets wiped when attempting to re-format as NTFS for Windows I am attempting to install windows 10 using Boot Camp on my 2014 13\" MacBook Air with 256 GB of hard drive. Everything goes well untill I reach the Windows install screen. I select my language, keyboard layout etc., but when I go to select the partition that I want to install Windows on (I set it to about 100 GB), it says that the drive must be formatted as NTFS (exact error: windows cannot be installed on drive 0 partition 3).\nI bypassed that my opening a DOS windows and doing these following commands: \ntype: diskpart\ntype: list disk (you should see only Disk0)\ntype: sel disk 0\ntype: clean\n\nand that fixes the problem but it also wiped my whole Mac OS partition leaving me with one empty 233 GB drive that I can install Windows to. I want to be able to switch between the 2 OS. I am currently in the process of re-insatlling macOS using Internet recovery since my drive got wiped.\nHow can I make it not delete macOS while still being able to install Windows?\n\nA: At the point where you received the error message, you should have seen a partition labeled BOOTCAMP. You need to select this partition and click on the Format button. The label BOOTCAMP will disappear. Next, you select the partition that was labeled BOOTCAMP and proceed with the installation of Windows.\nThe Boot Camp Assistant cannot NTFS format a partition. So, instead the partition is formatted FAT32 with the label BOOTCAMP. You have to click on the Format button to reformat the partition as NTFS. This will erase the BOOTCAMP label. Later, when the Windows Support Software from Apple executes, the NTFS-formatted partition will be renamed back to BOOTCAMP.\n", "Q: Can Grapher plot periodic functions, other than trigonometric ones? That is, something like:\n\nf(x) = f(x+c)\n\nWhere c is an arbitrary constant. Examples:\n\nHow might I get grapher to chart this or select an appropriate tool to visualize these functions?\n\nA: Yes, indeed it can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Square wave: try something like y = (-1)^round(x)(but with proper formatting). Something like y = (round(x+0.5) - round(x)) - 0.5 would also work.\n\n*Sawtooth wave: try something like y = x mod 1 or, more elaborately, y = 2((x-0.5) mod 1) - 1. However, something like y = x - round(x) would also work. If you don't like any of these, try something like y = x - floor(x).\nThe triangular wave is left as an exercise to the reader ;-)\nOf course, you can also use the truncated Fourier series, but that may be too wiggly for your taste.\n", "Q: Have Reminders use date format set in System Preferences Over here, you can see that Reminders is using a different date format from the one I have set in System Preferences.\n\n \nHow do I get it to conform to the date format I have established in System Preferences?\n\nA: The Reminders app doesn't respect custom date format. It adheres to the default format for the currently set region and ignores any further customization made to the date format.\nApple support document, macOS Sierra: Customize formats to display dates, times, and more, specifies how date, time, number and currency format can be changed which is then respected by certain apps like Finder and Notes.\nThe document doesn't mention any app other than Finder and Notes and makes an ambitious statement:\n\nYour formats are visible in Finder windows and in some apps. For example, dates in Mail or Notes show your custom format.\n\nIt's likely a bug in Reminders app or this could be by design. If this functionality is critical for you, consider filing a bug report (RADAR) using Apple Bug Reporter.\n", "Q: Disk Utility not formatting memory card Have a Sandisk Ultra Micro SD card inserted into my MacBook pro using a Sandisk adapter.

How to resolve this?\n\nA: EDIT: You'll have to run the ./refind-install program in macOS after you've run csrutil disable in the Recovery OS. This will most likely solve any issues you have with installation.\nOriginal answer: I think your problem is that you've tried to disable csrutil through a terminal in MacOS, which won't work. Try following the steps in this article to go into Recovery OS, run csrutil disable; reboot in the Terminal, and then try going through the normal refind install steps. It's your choice if you want to re-enable System Integrity Protection afterwards, but again you'll have to do it through Recovery OS.\nHopefully this advice was interesting and useful to you, and I wish you good luck.\n", "Q: Get folder tag recognised by Automator within Photos library file I am trying to back my entire Photos library to OneDrive, following this early 2016 tutorial: https://www.groovypost.com/howto/share-pictures-OSX-photos-app-OneDrive/\nWhen I step through the \"Find finder Items\" step in Automator however, it executes the step, but does not find any files or folders tagged as blue. These are not shown underneath the button \"Results\" either.\nMy suspicion this has something to do with the step where you have to right click on the library file and select \"Show Package Contents\", and that Automator now ignores any subfolders in this file.\nThe tagged \"Master\" folder can be found by filtering by blue tag in Finder.\nI could not find anything on getting folder tags visible within these \"packages\"/library files.\nAny suggestions are appreciated!\n\nA: Select everything you want inside the package, ⌘+C and ⌘+option+V somewhere else.

This way I lost ability to CapsLock at all), now I love it.\nExcept that I don't. Neither one of two given Ukrainian layouts is usable because they both have remapped keys (compared to all other keyboards in the world). No worry - we can edit layout using Ukelele app or find an edited one on the internet.\nBut after installing this layout - we no longer have that option to use CapsLock for switching input sources:\n\nDoes anyone know a way (if at all possible) to customize keyboard layout (using Ukelele or whatever it takes) so that it is acceptable by OS for switching between languages with CapsLock?\nP. S.: my OS version is 10.13.6\n\nA: This special new function for CapsLock does not seem to be very well documented by Apple–which should not come as a surprise to anyone who's been using their products for very long.  Therefore, we don't seem to have been given the information needed to fully utilize or understand that feature.\nSo, basically, to answer your question:  No, that does not seem to possible at this time.\nHowever, there is a fairly simple work-around that can come close to duplicating that feature although there are some minor discrepancies which for me personally are actually preferable to the way the original feature was designed to work–although your preferences & priorities may obviously vary.\nIn any case, you could create a single custom keyboard based on the US keyboard that has the appropriate Ukrainian layout programmed directly into the CapsLock-based modifier combinations (keyboard layers or shift levels).\nMac OSX essentially treats CapsLock as a regular, but locking, modifier key without any limitations.  So, with Ukelele you may create a layout which supports both Latin & Cyrillic scripts and uses CapsLock to switch between them.\nThe Latin-based modifier combinations can mostly (if not entirely) be created automatically in several ways (the easiest being to duplicate the US keyboard you use, or create a layout that mirrors the currently active layout).  \nFor the Cyrillic-based Ukrainian layers you can open a keyboard you wish to emulate (or approximate) and drag the key mappings from that keyboard to you yours (with the proper CapsLock-based modifier combination activated).\nI don't think that a little bit of manual labor can be avoided, but you can accomplish your objective natively in this way.  There are some potential advantages & disadvantages to this option depending on your preferences.\nFor example, the flag will not change from US to Ukrainian which may be seen as a disadvantage.  However, you will have the CapsLock LED as an indication which may be seen as an advantage.  This also circumvents having to change the keyboard layout which is sometimes necessary when switching apps or documents, as well as the slight delay involved with that–that is of particular value to me as it drives me crazy when the keyboard layout is potentially different in each app.\nIf not for the OP, I hope this is informative or helpful to someone.\n\nA: Current version of Ukelele (3.4.2) has a checkbox \"Caps Lock Switch\" for layouts in a bundle:\n\nBut you can manually do the same in Info.plist of your bundle by setting the key TICapsLockLanguageSwitchCapable to <true/>. Worked for me:\n\n\nA: My answer is for those who wants to use the Caps Lock for changing layout and doesn't need its original purpose (and as me myself has found this question).\nYou can use karabiner utility to remap default Caps Lock behaviour to emulate some non-existing key (F13 for example).\n\nThen open system settings and use Caps Lock to bind this key to change keyboard layout (sorry for the screen in Russian, I believe it's still clear).\n\nKarabiner can be easily installed via brew: \nbrew cask install karabiner-elements\nP.S. You can also replace (possibly useless) eject or power key with missing del (delete_forward at my first screen).\n", "Q: What’s good about Safe Sleep (hibernation) in Macs if the system will open apps anyway? I’m trying to understand better this hibernation feature in Macs.  However, what’s really the difference between resuming from safe sleep and just to plain old “reopen windows when logging back in”.  I mean, if you have saved all your files, what's the difference?\n\nA: The system will re-open apps, but it won’t open unsaved documents. If you shut down instead of hibernating you have to decide whether to save or discard every unsaved document. \nIt’s also quicker to hibernate/wake than it is to shut down/boot. \nThis is a really bad example, but here it goes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hibernate is like Han Solo being frozen in carbonate. \n\n*Logging in is making a new baby and growing him up to be Han Solo. \n\n\n(As if either were possible in a world other than science fiction). Logging in starts a sequence of application starts and not all apps save their state so hibernate generally gets you closer to where you were without keeping the system alive and consuming energy during the rest period.\n", "Q: Boot Camp Assistant stuck on creating partition due to EFI formatted as NTFS Boot Camp Assistant is stuck on ‘create a partition’.

Unfortunately, Windows may not be able to boot anymore.\nWhat you can do, however, is try to mount the partition (usually labeled BOOTCAMP) in macOS and copy whatever important files you have there onto a backup drive or other external/internal storage.\nSorry to say, but Windows may not boot ever again.\nI once made this exact mistake and had to reinstall Windows completely.\n", "Q: How can I change the default 1 hour duration of a new appointment in the iOS calendar?

I use the Mac Numbers app (version 5.1) on a retina MacBook Pro, Safari 11.1.2\nI need to copy & paste a spreadsheet to include the formulae, but not the figures?\nSpefically, my accounts for July, with all the relevant formulae and I want to use the same layout - and, in general, the same formulae, but not the same figures - for my accounts for August. Up to now, I have copied & pasted the spreadsheet, then deleted the information in the relevant cells - but this also deletes the formulae.\n\nA: The simplest way is to keep the data column separate from formula column, then just delete the data.\nFor more automated action I found this answer for you..\nA short script can clear all the content in a selected range of cells except formulas, which are left intact.\nFirst use the File->Duplicate in Numbers to create a copy.\nNext step... Copy-paste the script below into Script Editor (in Applications > Utilities folder).\nSelect a range of cells in Numbers, some of which contain data while other have formulas.\nWith the cells selected, click the triangle 'run' button in Script Editor.\nIt's always best to make a copy of your work before performing an operation like this, just in case you do the wrong thing or change your mind.\ntell application \"Numbers\"\n    tell front document to tell active sheet\n        tell (first table whose selection range's class is range)\n            set selRng to selection range\n            repeat with aCell in selRng's cells\n                tell aCell to if its formula is missing value then set its value to \"\"\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\n\nA: One way to accomplish this would be to use automation. You can create a Service that deletes all non-formula cells in a selected table. \nIn your scenario, you'd copy and paste the entire old table—complete with the figures you want to delete—then execute the Service on the newly pasted table to remove all of the figures.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator (/Applications/Utilities/Automator.app) and create a new Service.\n\n*At the top, set this service to receive no input in Numbers.\n\n*Use the search bar on the left side to find the Run AppleScript action and drag it into the main workflow pane on the right side.\n\n*Set the contents of the Run AppleScript to the following:\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell document 1 of application \"Numbers\"\n        tell (table 1 of active sheet whose class of selection range is range)\n            repeat with c in cells\n                tell c to if formula is missing value then set value to \"\"\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend run\n\n\n*Save the Service under a name you'll recognize (perhaps \"Delete Figures\").\nFrom now on, whenever you are in Numbers and want to clear the raw figures from a table with formulas, select the table by clicking within it, then click Numbers in the menu bar, hover over Services in the menu that appears, and then click on the Service you just created (which I called \"Delete Figures\").\nIf you'd like to expedite this further, you could bind a keyboard shortcut to this Service in System Preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences and open the Keyboard preferences.\n\n*Select the Shortcuts tab, then click App Shortcuts in the menu on the left.\n\n*Click the + icon in the lower left. Select Numbers as the application, and type the name of your Service exactly as it appears in the Services menu as the Menu Title. Then click on the Keyboard Shortcut field and press the keyboard shortcut you'd like to bind to the Service.\n\n\nNow, when in Numbers, you can simply click within a table whose raw figures you'd like to delete, then press that keyboard shortcut to remove them.\n", "Q: Open homebrew version of emacs instead of Apple version \n\nI installed emacs 26.1 via brew install emacs, but when I try to start emacs via command line, only the outdated Apple-supplied version (22.1.1) opens.\nHowever, emacs is apparently correctly linked:\n$ which -a emacs\n/usr/local/bin/emacs\n/usr/bin/emacs\n\n$ exa -l /usr/local/bin/emacs\nlrwxr-xr-x 32 $USER 26 Aug 22:42 /usr/local/bin/emacs -> ../Cellar/emacs/26.1_1/bin/emacs\n\n$ exa -l /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/26.1_1/bin/emacs\nlrwxr-xr-x 10 $USER 25 May 18:41 /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/26.1_1/bin/emacs -> emacs-26.1\n\nPATH also has /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin, so why does emacs still open /usr/bin/emacs?\n\nA: The problem was that emacs was still hashed, so the old version was used even after installing the new one.\nTherefore,\n$ type emacs\nemacs is hashed (/usr/bin/emacs)\n\nThis can be remedied by either logging out and then back in again, or forcing the shell to rehash by running hashemacs, which will result in \n$ type emacs\nemacs is hashed (/usr/local/bin/emacs)\n\nThen, the correct version will be used.\n", "Q: Wallpaper lock after mac restarting I recently restarted my mac and after login i am locked in a wallpaper.\n\nThis is a picture after i logged in.\nIf you know how i can make it work again you would save me !\n\nA: Apple has a whole article what to do when a restart doesn’t work.

I recently used Image Capture to get a backup of my iOS Camera Roll, and noticed a discrepancy.\nIn the footer of the app, Image Capture notes the number of items on the device, or the number selected if they are individually selected. But after Import All (or select all then Import), the number of items in the folder on my Mac was a smaller number.\nImage Capture is version 6.3 (502.1)\nOS X 10.9.5 Mavericks\niTunes - running or not running, same results.\nPreview not running.\nNo other camera-acquisition apps.\nReplicated this behaviour on 2 iOS devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 6 / iOS 11.4.1 (15G77) with settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Photo Library is OFF.\n\n*Optimize iPhone Storage is disabled.\n\n*My Photo Stream is OFF.\n\n*iCloud Photo Sharing is OFF.\n\n*Cellular Data (for Photos) is OFF.\n\n*Transfer to Mac or PC is Automatic (not Keep Originals).\n\n\n*iPad 3 / iOS 9.5.3 (13G36) with settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*My Photo Stream is OFF.\n\n*iCloud Photo Sharing is OFF.\n\n*Optimize iPhone Storage is not available.\n\n\n\nUSB cables are original Apple, for both devices.\nVideos import fine.\nEdited photos import fine.\nHidden photos import fine.\nPhotos with the same filename, but different dates, also import fine. One of the devices has more than 10,000 photos, and since the filenames are IMG_0000 to IMG_9999 (with JPG, PNG, MOV, etc. extensions of course), there are only 10,000 unique names. I have, for example, an IMG_3955.JPG from this past March, and another IMG_3955.JPG from July 2014. The older one imports as \"IMG_3955 1.JPG\"\n\nA: Duplicated photos seem to be the culprit. That is, photos added to the Camera Roll by means of the iOS Photos app's \"Duplicate\" command.\nPhotos are stored in the Camera Roll ordered by the time they are created. So if, on August 23, you Duplicate a photo from August 11, it will show up as the last picture on your Camera Roll... but you might notice scrolling through Camera Roll photos in order, that this Duplicate shows up with the August 11 date, same date as the original.\nI have 3 photos (visible as separate items both on the device and in Image Capture) with name IMG_9234.JPG and the exact same date/time. Only one copy was imported.\nApparently when Image Capture sees these a photo with the same exact filename and same timestamp (which is probably a last-modified time, rather than a created time), it either ignores the picture (thinking it was already imported) or else it overwrites the last one it imported.\nI'm not sure if this is a bug, an oversight, or was intentional.\nBut the discrepancy in the count is very annoying, since the number can't be used as a quick confirmation that all the photos were correctly imported.\n", "Q: windows partition deleted by boot camp assistant but space is not restored I was trying to delete bootcamp drive , using bootcamp assistant while formating it hanged up along with my mac. i could not perform any action.

This sincerely  worries me.\nThanks to all.\nP.S. if there is any extra information you need, please feel free to ask.\nEDIT: with more investigation, it appears it is not just my Downloads directory, but everything superseding my home directory; this makes the issue 10 times more important.\nEDIT 2: after looking at it some more, it seems as if Desktop and Downloads are there as Symlinks, but why are all these apps allowed to access this data? \n\nA: The purpose of ~/Library/Containers is to provide what amount to virtualized home directories for sandboxed applications. When a sandboxed application \"asks for\" the user's home directory (via NSHomeDirectory), it is given the path to its container directory. These features do not allow sandboxed apps to access the data in these directories, nor do they occupy (more than a trivial amount of) additional storage. (In fact, to the former point, this feature is designed to restrict apps' access to your data; to the latter, the \"duplicate folders\" are just symbolic links, which function as references back to the actual directories they represent.)\nAn application that is sandboxed may only read from and write to locations that are subdirectories of its own container. The symlinked folders in each Container (e.g., Downloads and Documents) are not accessible by default to sandboxed apps. Sandboxed apps can only access external file system locations if explicitly granted access to them through an NSOpenPanel or NSSavePanel (one of the pop-up dialogs that asks you to select a file to open or a location to which to save a file) via the Powerbox API (this is the model used by document-based applications—for instance, this lets you save and open documents that you edit with a sandboxed text editor in your Documents folder). In fact, apps that don't use App Sandbox (and thus don't have a container directory) can access virtually any file within your home directory (although there will be some further restrictions implemented in macOS Mojave), whereas those that do use App Sandbox (i.e., those that are given a container) cannot. Also, it's worth noting that all apps on the Mac App Store are required to use App Sandbox.\nIn summary: yes, those \"replicated home folders\" are supposed to be there—that is intended behavior; no, they are not consuming any meaningfully significant amount of extra disk space; and the feature that causes these folders to appear is actually preventing these apps from accessing your personal data, not enabling them to.\nFurther reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*Another Ask Different thread about ~/Library/Containers\n\n*Apple's developer documentation about app sandboxing and pseudo-home directories\n", "Q: Is it possible to customize the default order of Spotlight's results?

One of the red leds for dimm 3 raiser b lit up red on my MacPro early 2008 lit up, so I reseated the ram in question on it by switching it with it's counter part (swapped dimm 3 for dimm 4) and switched it from the top to the bottom riser.   Then I had the full amount of RAM again and no red light.  \nI also run Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on it.  \nI have never reset the nvram, pram, or SMC on it, and so I was wondering if that is somehow related to such strange events in the hardware as the led lights coming on and going away after reseating the ram as I did.\n\nA: As you may know, the Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) and System Management Controller (SMC) have totally different purposes. \nIn terms of the red light you're referring to:\n\n\n*\n\n*resetting the NVRAM will have absolutely no bearing on this whatsoever\n\n*resetting the SMC could have an influence, but probably not in the way you're asking about. \n\n\nAt its core the SMC is responsible for power management and controlling the thermal environment of your Mac. Typically this covers things like interpreting and responding to various sensors, battery charging, sleep/wake/hibernation, the power button and restarts/shutdowns, LED indicators, and so on.\nSince the red light needs a power source, as do RAM chips to operate, it's quite possible that resetting the SMC could have an impact on the light:\n\n\n*\n\n*directly in terms of its own power source\n\n*indirectly because the associated RAM isn't getting the power it needs and therefore triggers ECC errors which triggers the red light.\n\n\nHowever, despite the above explanation, in most cases a red light indicates nothing more than the fact the RAM isn't seated properly. Removing and reseating the riser(s) will usually rectify this problem. While it may seem unlikely that this was the problem in your case, it actually doesn't take much for this to occur (e.g. the computer is moved, bumped, etc).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2012 15\" can’t boot When I turn it on, it shows the Apple logo and starts loading up to about 50%, then the screen turns black.

When I’m setting up (pressing those “Get Started”), I found something fishy in the Health app.\nI rarely work after 1am, and recently I did start sleeping before midnight. I found that there are some walking records, timestamped at night, around 3-6am. My immediate guess is that someone moved my phone at night during my sleep.\nI’m not sure whether it is normal. For example, is iOS using location service to locate my phone’s approximate location so as to calculate how many “steps” I walked, or is it solely using the motion sensors?\nI usually put my phone near my pillow. However, because the numbers of steps are not small (at least 10), it should not be caused by my movement during sleep time.\nSince I’m not asking with respect to information security, I’m not looking for counter-measures. So any ideas about the causes are welcome, even if they don’t address to solutions.\n\nA: Short answer\nAssuming there's no obvious explanation (e.g. sleep walking, getting up to go to the toilet, someone 'using' your phone, etc) then no, this isn't normal. \nLong answer\nDespite the \"short answer\" above, it's important to appreciate that in the absence of an activity tracking device (e.g. Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc)  being paired to your iPhone, then calculations are not as accurate at they could be.\nAt its most basic level*, a smart phone's activity measurement is performed by processing a range of calculations based on the data captured by tri-axial accelerometers. These accelerometers record acceleration in all three spatial dimensions (i.e. up/down, left/right, and forward/backward). This data is then fed into calculations to determine activities such as \"steps\".\nAdditionally, in the absence of any external fitness trackers you'll find that smartphones typically need to calculate steps in chunks and that there's a minimum number that can be reported (e.g. your iPhone isn't ever likely to tell you that you've just moved a single step, but it could say you've moved 6 steps). That's not to say it can't measure steps down to a solitary unit, just that part of the calculations involved mean that reporting figures like 6, 7, 12, 16, 137, 346, 1037, etc are possible, but not that you got up in the middle of the night and walked just two steps (because the minimum amount of data it needs to perform the calculations is such that it can't calculate just two steps on their own).\nSo, what all this means is that if the Health app is regularly reporting \"fishy moves at night\" of 10 or more steps, then either something is triggering this (sleep walking, getting up and forgetting about it, looking at the iPhone a number of times, someone else 'using' your phone, etc) or that there's some sort of 'fault' (e.g. faulty sensor(s), wrong time allocation, etc).\nIf the fishy timestamps are happening multiple times during the night, then it's less likely to be someone else using the phone and more likely to be you. If it's only happening once during the night and only occasionally, then it could be someone else using your phone, or just you doing something with it. However, in all scenarios it could be some sort of fault.\nIf it's of concern you could do some experiments to test for different scenarios, but otherwise it's probably not worth worrying about unless you're concerned with a high accuracy of step counts during these hours.\n*You haven't specified your exact iPhone model, but in recent years the calculations performed have become more refined and take in data from other sources as well (e.g. gyroscope, location, compass).\n", "Q: This gray bar blocking my text box is driving me insane.

Whenever I have a fixed place to work, I like to use my MacBook Pro as shown:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Connected to an external display in mirror mode, not extended screen mode.\n\n*Connected to external keyboard (Wireless Bluetooth, by Apple) and mouse (ThinkPad, Wired).\n\n*Lid closed with the keyboard placed above it.\nI have had this habit for a while and I haven't any doubt about it until recently when I observed something very weird happening to the MacBook's screen.\nIs this a good or bad practise for the MacBook's lifespan?\n\nA: You should be fine. (It's advisable not to keep the keyboard on top, discussed below).\nThis mode is known as closed-clamshell or closed-display mode. Apple even has a support document sharing guidelines regarding this mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use your Mac notebook computer in closed-display mode with an external display.\n\n\nHowever, a few general instructions need to be kept in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your MacBook is placed on a flat surface with no obstructions to the vents and air-flows, especially towards the lower end of the back side. That's where the vents are placed.\n\n*Do not keep it close to other electronic items which tend to get hot. Ideally your MacBook shouldn't heat up. (You can check that by placing your hand on top of the lid).\nNote: To complement point 1 & 2, ideally don't keep anything 3\"-4\" around your MacBook. Keep that area open with proper air flow.\n\n*Refrain from keep anything on top of the device and apply any kind of pressure. I'd advise you not to use it in the way that you have demonstrated (with the keyboard on top). Consider moving the keyboard from top and keeping it elsewhere.\n\n*A few folks prefer keeping it in a vertical orientation rather horizontal as it provides for better air flow and exposed vents. There are various cases/docks which allow you to house your MacBook in upright position (random example). This advise may be helpful if you are using the MacBook in clamshell mode for pro-longed period of time. It also helps in saving desk space. (Space on desk for your keyboard .)\n\n*Keep the MacBook plugged-in to a power source. However, also consider draining the battery to a full discharge once in a while (recommended is at least once a month) to maintain its health.\nI have a similar setup with an external display, wired keyboard and wired mouse connected to my MacBook Pro. I make it a point to completely discharge the battery (thereby completing one charge cycle) once a month. The advise is purely based on personal experience (~5 years of usage) and generally understood guidelines regarding maintaining a MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: Administrator user can't visit pages in Safari as they are not approved in Parental Controls I experience troubles regarding accessing some websites with Safari from the local network or outside.\nThe error says:\nOoops!

(I did not download any files via mail and I don't use any browser) I use this laptop to write mails only(Nothing more).\n\nA: Most likely you have sprung to an incorrect conclusion - that your Mac was hacked.\nThe most likely cause of \"unwanted\" or \"surprising\" host name changes is that your DHCP server gave your computer a new hostname. The DHCP server could be a router/modem in your own house, a system at your ISP or indeed hardware at anywhere you have connected to a WiFi network (such as a coffee shop, school or whatever).\nRemoving sudo rights from yours won't help this problem, as the DHCP client on your Mac will still be able to change your hostname.\n\nA: There is no evidence that you were hacked. \nThe four users that you are listed don't have \"root\" access per se and they are all valid accounts:\n\n\n*\n\n*daemon - a user to handle the background processes that aren't tied to a specific user, the user daemon is given those processes.  This is how you can have your Mac turned on, nobody logged in and processes still run.\n\n*nobody - this is another user that gets assigned processes (like httpd) and has very limited access to the system.  Even if someone were to hack it, is exposure would be limited.\n\n*jen - I'm assuming this is you (SE username is \"jennifer ruurs\").  If you're an admin  user, you have sudo rights which gives you root access\n\n*root - this the root account.  This account needs root access especially if you boot into Single User mode for diagnostics or repairs.  \nThe command you mentioned only temporarily changes the hostname of your computer.\nsudo hostname 192\n\nThis only happens if and only if, the user/group it logged in as is in the /etc/sudoers file and they either had the password or /etc/sudoers is configured for no password authentication (very insecure and not default macOS setting).\nAll of the users above, with the exception of jen, cannot (by default) access your computer remotely.  So, if you are convinced that you were \"hacked\", you need to either find the user account that grants them access or if it was your account, mitigate your risk, change your password. \n\nA: To answer the question in the title directly:\nYou cannot.\nWipe everything, reinstall macOS and restore files from backup (not from the infected machine).\nFor completeness, it's worth mentioning there exist attacks that e.g. infect the firmware of storage devices, necessitating the entire hardware to be destroyed to ensure 100% safety. Unless you have reason to believe you are being personally targeted by a government, though, this isn't a realistic worry - by contrast, infecting any part of the data actually stored on disk is orders of magnitude easier and a very realistic threat. Even if you were just the victim of an automated, untargeted attack, wiping everything is a necessary precaution.\nWhy?\nIf an attacker has root access, they can, among other things, replace any binary with their own version that can do whatever they like, meaning that you cannot trust anything on your system anymore. Quite literally anything you try to do might end up doing something completely different. If the hacker wanted, they might make cat return doctored version of files to e.g. hide log entries showing unwanted activity; ls could fail to show files added by the hacker; any text editor could pretend to save what you write but actually silently ignore your edits, etc., etc.\nCan't I at least keep my files? I have things that were backed up a while ago/aren't backed up at all\nThe reason you don't want to copy your files over is that there are plenty of non-executable file types that can exploit some vulnerability or other and reinfect your system. Compressed archives of various types and PDFs are common carriers, but by no means the only danger. You're probably safe copying over a plaintext, non-executable text file (remember to not use the compromised OS to do that, though), but remember that the attacer could have changed absolutely anything in absolutely any way they wanted,so treat everything like you would treat a random file accidentally downloaded from a shady website.\nMore realistically...\nYou also have to think about why the hacker would do something like that. Replacing cat and ls with malicious versions is entirely possible, but making the output sophisticated enough to fool you into thinking everything's fine is much more complex. If the hacker just wanted to spy on you, they'd install a keylogger and leave everything else alone. If they wanted to use your machine in a botnet, they'd install the necessary software and leave everything else alone. If they wanted your money specifically, they'd have installed ransomware, and you'd know that already.\nNone of the above cases involve editing your bash history, or changing the hostname of your machine. A keylogger or similar rootkit can be made virtually undetectable. So while a root attacker can do anything, usually that means you'll never be able to guess they're there, except by e.g. observing your load being higher than usual when your compromised machine participated in a botnet. Or if they didn't mind you knowing they were in, it's much, much easier to just lock a user out (e.g. by changing the account password) than mess with the bash history. (Or, again, ransomware.)\nSo what happened here and what should you do?\nThe other answers already describe what I personally agree is the most probable scenario: a few flukes, like the DHCP server changing your hostname. In which case you're uncompromised and fine.\nThe alternative is that someone manually broke into your machine, and is either clumsily trying to hide it, or intentionally messing with you. This could be a family member, or coworker, or other acquiantance; perhaps they might have shoulder-surfed your password. If that the case and you're certain they didn't install any rootkits or keyloggers in the meantime, then just changing the relevant passwords (root, and your user's) should be enough. But you really can't know what they did or didn't do, and once you already have root access it's utterly trivial to install a ready-made malware package - so if you truly believe someone gained unauthorized root access, then, as explained above, wipe everything.\n", "Q: Accessing the Terminal on a 2008 MacBook Pro, when booting in single-user mode I am booting my 2008 MacBook Pro into single-user mode and attempting to access the Terminal by using the key combination Command + s during startup.

I am new to Macs and was wondering how to create a restore partition (which I read about in one of the answers) in order to do my first backup. \nAlso, should the first backup be kept separate, in case you need to restore to the original condition of your system, and then do another backup which is then used to do hourly/daily backups/whenever backups upon? Thank you for your help.\n\nA: It is generally recommended to use an external disk or a folder on a shared storage of a server for performing backups of your Mac. Time Machine, an app built into macOS is the recommended solution for creating and restoring backups.\nFor starters. I'd like to point you to the wonderful web-page setup by Apple for users new to Mac & macOS and learning about backing up:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to back up your Mac\n\nshould the first backup be kept separate, in case you need to restore to the original condition of your system, and then do another backup which is then used to do hourly/daily backups/whenever backups upon?\n\nYou should be fine with a Time Machine backup. However, do ensure that the disk with Time Machine backup is kept secure and backup remains available for restoring.\n\nA: How to backup using time machine?\nTake a look at this article from Apple Support → How to use Time Machine to backup and restore your Mac\n\n\nAlso, should the first backup be kept separate, in case you need to restore to the original condition of your system, and then do another backup which is then used to do hourly/daily backups/whenever backups upon? \n\nWell the more backups the better, but this is a bit unnecessary. You can always restore the original factory system by reformatting and reinstalling macOS.\nDepending on what type of computer I would suggested the following schedule\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop : Leave plugged in to do hourly backups.\n\n*Laptop : Backup once per day, week, or month depending on how often you use your computer.\n\n\n\nSince you are new to Mac, assuming that you are coming from Windows, take a look at this article it will really help with the transition. \nMac tips for Windows switchers\n\nA: \n...how to create a restore partition...in order to do my first backup...Also, should the first backup be kept separate, in case you need to restore to the original condition of your system,\n\nYou don't need to.  A recovery partition is automatically created when macOS is installed; no matter if purchased new from Apple or second hand.  Additionally, newer Mac models don't need a recovery partition per se; they can use Internet Recovery to restore your Mac to its original (factory fresh) state.\n\n...then do another backup which is then used to do hourly/daily\n  backups/whenever backups upon?\n\nYou've got the right idea.  Your first backup is the critical one - it establishes the base for your future backups.  As your backup progresses, it will only backup changed files.  This is good because if you leave your Mac plugged in (with the external drive attached) overnight, it will \"wake\" to perform backup tasks.  \nIf you get into the habit of leaving it connected like this overnight, you will wake to a backed up machine that's fully charged (assuming it's a portable).\nFinally, make sure your data is in more than one place.  I keep my documents on OneDrive, but you can use iCloud.  This means any one document is in 3 places at once:  my machine, my cloud storage, and my Time Machine.  If you were to (heaven forbid) lose your Mac, you can still access your documents in either the cloud or Time Machine.  If your backup drive fails, you still have your data accessible in two alternate locations.\n", "Q: Home network with wired and wifi, force local data over wired How to connect three machines (Mini, 10.11; laptop, 10.12; iMac, 10.13) on two local networks, one wired and one WiFi, where local traffic is over wired connections and (external) Internet traffic is over WiFi? For context, assume the WiFi router is in another part of the building, wired connections to it are not an option and it is not under my control. The primary motivation is to do all file sharing among the three machines (TimeMachine backups and other networked file sharing) on higher bandwidth connections. What are the essential details of this configuration? \nThe Mini has 1 Ethernet port and 1 Thunderbolt port. The iMac has 1 Ethernet and 2 Thunderbolt ports. The laptop has only Thunderbolt ports (but one could always get a dongle). (All have Wifi.) The interface priority on all machines is set to: Thunderbolt, then (if on the machine) Ethernet, and then WiFi. Is this interface priority scheme helpful or counterproductive?\nIP addresses for Thunderbolt and Ethernet are manually set to a subnet different than that of the the WiFi router (10.0.10.x, masked with 255.255.255.0, for wired local connections and 10.0.0.x for WiFi).\nOption 1. Thunderbolt daisy chain. Can I daisy chain the local wired network and expect the endpoints to communicate via Thunderbolt cables: Mini (10.0.10.1) <-> iMac (10.0.10.2) and iMac (10.0.10.2) <-> laptop (10.0.10.3)? If yes, do I need to do anything specific to make this happen? For instance, on the laptop (and Mini) would I need to add something in the routing table (or other file) that says something like, \"for all packets going to 10.0.10.x, use interface bridge0\"? \nOption 2. Direct connections for each pairing of machines. The machines could be connected in a triangular configuration: Mini (10.0.10.1) <-> iMac (10.0.10.2), iMac (10.0.10.2) <-> laptop (10.0.10.3), and Mini (10.0.10.1) <-> laptop (10.0.10.3). Given the available ports (see above), the model would then be to connect the Mini and iMac via Ethernet and connect the laptop to each other machine via Thunderbolt. Under this scenario, would the Ethernet and Thunderbolt interfaces need to be on separate subnets, i.e., : Mini (10.0.11.1) <-> iMac (10.0.11.2), iMac (10.0.10.2) <-> laptop (10.0.10.3), and Mini (10.0.10.1) <-> laptop (10.0.10.3)? \n\nA: Note:  Answer not complete....\n\"Local\" Data\n\nHome network with wired and WiFi, force local data over wired\n\nThere's a bit of a rhetorical question here - what's local data?  The answers will vary depending on how you see this whole thing configured however, we have to step away from that and look at from the perspective of the network.\nIn other words, \"local data\" is data that resides (is local to) that particular network.  Let's look at your two networks: 10.0.10.0 and 10.0.11.0.  We'll call them 10.0 and 11.0, respectively for the sake of brevity.\nTraffic sent on 10.0 to a particular node, say 10.25 is local to that network.  Likewise, traffic sent on 11.0 on the same network is considered local to it.  This is all traffic - web, ssh, ftp, smb, etc.\nMultiple Networks, Multiple Adapters\nCan a node (computer) have two or more network adapters to connect to multiple networks?  Sure!\nYou don't even need multiple adapters if your equipment makes use of 802.1Q VLAN (Virtual LAN) specification (we'll save that for another day).  However, you can attach multiple network interfaces to a single node to access more than one network.\n\nIn this scenario, we have a single node with two network adapters connected to two different networks, 10.0 and 11.0.\n", "Q: TimeMachine backup shared network drive not listed under \"select disk\" I will use a shared network drive for TimeMachine backup.

I went into \"Screen Saver\" and set it to start after 20 minutes. When I press the lock icon on my TouchBar, the computer locks, and then within 5 seconds the displays turn off. As a result, the screen saver never kicks in... But I'd like to see the screen saver on the lock screen.\nI ran a web search for the problem and found mention of a \"com.apple.screensaver\" plist file but this file doesn't appear to exist in /Library/Preferences, which is where it is supposed to exist. I suppose this file has been renamed or something similar, for this OS release...\nSo I'm grasping at straws now. How can I enable the screen saver on the lock screen?\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, it's not possible to trigger the screensaver from the lock screen. However, you could consider triggering the screensaver instead of going to the lock screen, then changing your security settings to lock your device in the background as soon as the screensaver triggers.\nTo do this, go to your Security & Privacy preferences in System Preferences, check the checkbox next to Require password [time interval] after sleep or screen saver begins, and select immediately from the dropdown (or 5 seconds if you want a little leeway—this setting dictates the length of time after the screensaver starts before you'll need to put in your password to unlock your computer). See the screenshot below:\n\nNext, you'll simply need to add a shortcut to start the screensaver to your Touch Bar. As this CNET article explains, go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Customize Control Strip and drag the Screen Saver control to your Touch Bar's Control Strip. From now on, instead of locking your display, press the Screen Saver icon on the Touch Bar to both lock your device (i.e., prevent access without a password, but without showing the login screen) and start the screensaver.\n", "Q: Some keys on Apple Wireless keyboard not working I noticed that these keys are not working on my Apple Wireless keyboard: q, w, e, r, t, y, u, i, & o.

My idea is that during startup (macOS or Windows), you can't damage the file system if you interrupt it as the drive is not being written to, just reading from.  I've heard that's not the case, and that during startup the drive may be written to.  what can be written to a startup drive during boot? \nPlease clear up my mind. Thank you.\n\nA: It is possible to damage the file system by forcing a shutdown (i.e. for example by cutting off power) during startup.\nDuring startup the operating system can write to files such as for example log files, pid files, caches, or in very extreme cases also swap files for virtual memory. Therefore the file system on disk can be modified by the operating system during startup - and thus there is a risk that something goes wrong if this is interrupted forcibly midways.\nModern file systems (such as the ones normally used on macOS systems) try to avoid corruption by the way of a technique called journaling. Therefore you'll probably experience that nothing goes wrong if you try interrupting the boot to test this out - however there is a risk.\n\nA: @jksoegaard's answer is correct, and you could prove it yourself on Windows by using Sysinternals ProcMon at http://live.sysinternals.com/procmon.exe and use the option for Boot Logging and then reboot. You'll see plenty of write activity happens.\n", "Q: What is the purpose of an AAE file? First, some background:\nFor those of you who edit photos using Apple software, you may have encountered AAE sidecar files, which are generated automatically by the Photos app (for iOS or macOS) when you export an edited image. These sidecars contain the data representing the edits made to the original image, such as crops or recoloring. Following an export, these AAE sidecar files will usually be located in the same directory as the original, exported image/JPEG file.\nTheoretically, edits made to an image using the Photos app (on iOS or macOS) are \"non-destructive,\" meaning that you can always revert to the original image anytime after editing.\nNow, the problem:\nFor the life of me, I cannot understand if these AAE files are actually good for anything once they exist. If you try to import an original image file and its AAE into the Photos app, you only see the original image. The edits don't seem to transfer. \nLikewise, advice from Apple and user forums regarding the transfer of edited photos suggest that you use iMessage, AirDrop, or other methods to copy the edited image itself to the new destination. This process, however, defeats the idea of non-destructive edits since it will prevent you from ever reverting to the original image.\nFinally, the question:\nDoes the AAE sidecar file serve any purpose? If so, what does it actually offer a user or program once it exists? Can we do anything with it?\n\nA: According to several sources this feature was introduced with the launch of iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite (now macOS Yosemite).\nThe AAE file format is proprietary, which usually means that only Apple, and Apple-approved, software can interpret the contents. Some cross platform apps that can take advantage of the AAE format are Lightroom and Photoshop. However the file appears to be a regular XML file.\nA sample file for a slow motion video would look like this: https://pastebin.com/raw/1r8416rm\nThe data tag is encoded with base64 and, when decoded, contains a property list (.plist) formatted file that looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/CYPVcTO.jpg\nSimply put, an AAE file contains information that specific apps can use to apply effects to photos and videos based on edits that a user makes in the iOS Photos app.\n\nA: Does this help? Found it when I googled \"macos AAE file\".\nhttps://fileinfo.com/extension/aae\n", "Q: Set number of audible rings I've found articles on setting the number of rings before my phone goes to voicemail, but I want something different:\nI want something in between \"silent\" and \"ringing out loud the default number times (7 or so)\".\nI want the phone to ring out loud once or twice, and then continue to \"ring\" silently -- ie, I would still have time to get to my phone before it went to voicemail.\nThe problem is that 7 rings is almost never needed, since I hear the phone on the first or second ring -- the remaining rings are just an insistent audio annoyance.\n\nA: There in no setting/configuration available in iOS which can be used to achieve the desired customization.\nI think the prevailing solution is to silence the audible ringer and wear an Apple watch so you can discretly check on a call and answer directly or choose to handle the call on the phone. For the near future, the phone will likely ring when it's ringing and not when it's not.\n\nA: Make a ringtone 40 seconds long, but containing only silence after the first 5 seconds or so.\nDigital Trends have a full tutorial, though it's using an existing tune from iTunes. They also say maximum ringtone length is 30s. I always thought it was 40, so you might need to experiment.\nYou could quite easily do this in something like Audacity. Copy in 5s of audio but save a file 30s long. I'm not sure whether it can save AAC, but if not, save as WAV then use something like XLD to convert to AAC [m4a]. Manually change the extension to m4r & you have a ringtone.\n", "Q: Is it necessary to give my debit card details to update the macbook? when i am trying to update my version to Mac os high sierra. mac asks me to review my account in apple store. for reviewing my account i need to give my debit card details. Is it necessary to give that?\n\nA: Yes this is normal and necessary once Apple asks for that information on your Apple ID. When you initially sign up, this can be optional based on how precisely you establish your AppleID, but once asked, you must enter a valid form of payment to continue to use that AppleID in the stores. \nYou are still purchasing and agreeing to be legally bound to the license terms when you install “free” software in any of Apple’s online stores. A form of payment is a very strong anti-fraud method since there is a paper trail to get payment credentials. \nOnce you validate your identity, you can usually make the payment method none, use a card with low balance as suits your needs. \n\nA: Apple provides detailed instructions for using an AppleID without a credit card here:\nCreate or use an Apple ID without a payment method\nIn essence, there is an option to select \"None\" as the Payment Type.\nHowever, it should be possible to download updates to your current OS (including new releases) without an AppleID. \n", "Q: Can FileVault protect a macOS partition from a Ubuntu partition? I’m working on setting up Ubuntu dual-boot on my MacBook Pro, and I’m terrified of doing something that breaks one or more of the systems now on my computer (like an rm -rf that manages to hit both partitions somehow). I was thinking, would encrypting the macOS partition with FileVault serve to prevent Ubuntu from accidentally doing something to it, or is that not how any of this works?\n\nA: The are four types of Apple partitions that are commonly used:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple_HFS (MacOS Extended Journaled)\n\n*Apple_Boot (MacOS Extended Journaled used for Recovery)\n\n*Core Storage\n\n*APFS\n\n\nThese partition either can not be mount by Ubuntu are can be mounted as Read Only. So there is no danger of Ubuntu overwriting a macOS volume.\n\nNote: Most Linux (including Ubuntu) can write to non-encrypted Apple_HFS partitions if journaling is turned off.

I haven't experienced this problem so far. While it seems the issue might be gone, I haven't had much use of the AirPods this last week.\nThere are many discussions about problems with AirPods disconnecting all over the net, but I'm not sure I've seen my case anywhere.\nBasically I listen to music from iPhone with my Airpods. It could be Apple Music or SoundCloud or whatever.\nSometimes the sound just stops - but when I look at my iPhone I notice that the airpods appear to be connected, and the iPod music player or whatever player I was currently using, is still ticking on ie the time progresses; play is not paused.\nEach time when this happens I have to do one of these methods:\nTemporary fix method 1\n\n\n*\n\n*pause the music (obviously this is optional, but if I don't I miss some parts)\n\n*disconnect the airpods\n\n*connect the airpods\n\n*(play the music)\n\n\nTemporary fix method 2\nI've found another way which fixes the problem after it happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pause for at least ~10 seconds\n\n*Unpause\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*Using iPhone 6s Plus, currently iOS 11.4.1\n\n*It is very inconvenient. There is no problem with batteries, this could happen on a full charge.\n\n*after a discussion in the answer below I decided to see what happens if I wait a longer time after the sound goes silent. Turns out the connection is still very much alive because I realized I can still use double taps on the left/right AirPods in order to pause/skip to next song according to my setup. Even pausing/unpairing/skipping this way will not make the sound come back. The iPhone seems to believe that it's sending music to perfectly sounding AirPods.\n\n*It kind of often happens after I look at the phone doing something, then put it down on a desk (likely locks it, or it autolocks after some minute) and after the screen goes black and then some more seconds (not sure how long, but it's very short) the music stops.\n\n*I get the feeling this happens a lot more when I'm at the office or other places with busy WiFi signals etc all around, but I'm not sure, it could happen almost anytime, it's hard to say.\n\n*It's not exactly reproducible - I can't cause it to happen, but it normally happens like one or a few times a day.\n\n*I don't use the phone much at all so I have no idea if this issue affects phone calls. Just no info here. I just had a call today and was using the AirPods and after 7-8 minutes the other guy started to sound like a monster (people describe this as \"underwater\" and I can also agree with that). I quickly switched off the AirPods and talked using the iPhone itself.\n\n*It seems to happen regardless of if I am connected to a Wi-Fi network, or have Wi-Fi turned off and am only listening to music with cellular connection.\n\n\nAnyone have this issue? When googling most pages suggest to unpair the airpods from the iPhone and re-pair them again. I've tried that, I believe, but I don't think it made anything better.\nKind of similar issues\n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8344649 very similar\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7887055\n\nA: This is typical of an interference between Bluetooth and other electromagnetic waves (Wi-Fi in an office or appartment environment, remote commands in every environment, wireless phones in every environment, microwave oven leaking in an office or appartment environment…).\nOne of the only thing you could do if at all possible is to suggest all Wi-Fi administrators around you (at least the ones who might understand) to switch on 5GHz band channels (36, 40, 44…) so as to reduce these interferences. Their networks will work better too.\nThis problem will increase regularly with the increase of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi use everywhere. This problem will stay hard to identify and to aknowledge since the channels used by Bluetooth are changing regularly (purposefully to avoid this interference problem ).\nYou can limit this problem by stopping Wi-Fi within your own environnment. And moreover, to make everyone laugh, you might surround you with a light metal wire mesh the kind used to make garden fences  (avoid the aluminium screen because it's an urban legend).\nAnother note on the funny side, these network drop is a free nice detector that you are in an overcrowded electromagnetic waves environment.\n\nA: This what exactly happens to me on a daily basis. The \"underwater\" or monstrous/slow voice issue during a call did not happen until about earlier this year or late last year (can't remember exactly). The lost of sound (silent) issue happened, I believe, later than that and it is getting worse. This morning, this happened like every 10 minutes or so and is becoming unbearable. Every time I just switch to iPhone speakers and then switch back to Airpod and that fixes it. It dose seems like Apple messed up the ios since it was working fine for the first six months or so. \n\nA: For me, sometimes this happens after I hit pause on my Apple Watch for a short time.   When I hit play, one side is either silent or just mostly quiet.   Today it was silent.\nOther times, it looks like it's playing, but I no sound comes out, and when I finish my walk, that song hasn't finished.   In that case, I think it wasn't really playing, it just showed as playing.  Pausing and restarting do nothing.\n", "Q: MS Outlook Version 16.16 doesn't show calendar event reminders For some or other reason MS Outlook doesn't show reminders when calendar events occur.\nGenerally, my meetings' reminders are configured for 15 minutes before events occur, however I never ever get any popup reminders that events are about to occur.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?\n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft Outlook for Mac Version 16.16 \n\n*Product ID: 03109-000-000001\n\n*macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6\n\n\nA: The Mac version of Outlook actually has an app that is in charge of displaying/sounding reminders, so it is nothing that you can access outside of Outlook.\nIf you launch Outlook and go to the Outlook menu the fourth item down should say either \"Turn off reminders,\" or \"Turn on reminders.\"\nIf it is the former you may want to reinstall Outlook as something has happened to cause the reminder application to not work. If it is the latter... well, problem solved.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra installation takes forever I am trying to install macOS Sierra on my MacBook Pro.

I am booting my laptop from macOS Sierra 10.12 DVD.\n\nA: I suggest you use the DVD with the macOS Installer app to create a bootable USB thumb drive and install macOS that way. Instructions from Apple are at this link.\nHere's a brief synopsis from this page:\nUse the 'createinstallmedia' command in Terminal\n\n*\n\n*After downloading the installer, connect the USB flash drive or other volume that will be used as the bootable installer.

A few years ago I created a company to start an app project. I released the series of apps but things did not work very well. The apps did not generate any significant revenue and I gradually abandoned the project. The company did still exist, but my accountant charged me an annoyingly big amount of money to just keep the company, which had nearly no income and nearly not expenses, alive.\nAfter a while, and after a big bill from the accountant, I started the process of shutting down the company to avoid the expenses. This process just managed to be completed when something happened...\nOn a day with some extra time on my hands I did some small changes to the apps on the account registered to the deleted company, and in the following weeks things started really rolling. Now the apps are making a lot of money...\nEverything is functioning properly, and money is paid out to my personal bank account. I did not think of this as a problem until my accountant responsible for doing the accounting for my personal company, doing my taxes etc, notified me that I could not write off expenses for some ads that I had run to get more downloads of the now revived apps.\nAfter thinking about all of this for a while I am now very worried that I am in big problems. What will happen if I tell Apple that the company behind my app-account is no longer active? Will they shut down the account and all my apps?\nCan I change the company behind the developer account if I start a new company?\nI am unable to create a new account and transfer my apps as all the apps uses Auto-Renewable Subscriptions which for some reason cannot be included when transferring an app between accounts. The extremely bad timing of shutting down the seemingly \"dead\" company is really torturing me. Now I am afraid Apple will suddenly shut down my account and stop all payments as the company no longer exists.\nCan someone please help me regain some faith that I am not in deep trouble? I am very nervous about this.\nI am worried I have made a big mistake.\n\nA: There shouldn't be anything to worry about.\n\nWhat will happen if I tell Apple that the company behind my app-account is no longer active? Will they shut down the account and all my apps?\n\nNot exactly. Best recourse in this scenario is to get in touch with the Apple developer support and discuss your case. Apple Developer support can be reached over Phone or email. The concerned personnel will be able to study your scenario and offer you applicable advise. They can direct you with moving over your apps to a different company.\nGet started by visiting Apple Developer Support website, login with your registered Apple ID, and select the applicable case.\n\n\nCan I change the company behind the developer account if I start a new company?\n\nYes. iTunes Connect does allow transferring apps to another developer account. Relevant documentation can be found here. You should be also be able to discuss this query with you developer support representative.\n", "Q: How to resize a screenshot image on a Mac so that it is \"regular size\" when posted on the Internet? Short question: why if I do screenshot on a Mac and crop it, and see it using Preview, it is a good size but when posted to Internet, such as StackOverflow, its width and height always double? I can resize 50% width and height but the image is not as clear (not retina). So how can I use that image and not have it show up twice the width and height?)\n\nI sometimes take a screenshot on a Mac (OS X Mavericks), by CMD-Shift 4, and resize it to 50% width and height in Preview.\nBut when posted on the Internet (for example, on an online forum or on ibb.co or imgur.com) , it is double size again. I tried 50% and then resolution changed from 144 to 72 for the original image, and the same: it is still double size.  I had to do a 25% and also 72, in order that it is the proper size.\nIt is really weird. Why 25% and not 50%, and how does the 144 or 72 matter? (or does it?)\n\nA: \nI'm not quite sure what you mean. I tested it with a screenshot (see above) and reduced the resolution to half, uploaded it here, it's still the new resolution that I chose in Preview.\nMaybe you can try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the resolution in Preview \n\n*Close the image\n\n*Right click on it, check Get Info, then \"More Info\", there you should find the current resolution which should be slower than before\n\n*If this does not work for you, maybe try a tool like ImageMagick that offers a lot of options for manipulating images.\n\n\nhttp://cactuslab.com/imagemagick/\n\nA: Why not change it by size (inches or pixels) instead of percent. Then you could be sure of the size. \n", "Q: Mac Pro 5.1 Windows 10 boot problems I'm trying to run Win 10 on a separated drive attached to sata optical drive bay. I ran into some issues about GPT partition over instalation processes which I could solve it by terminal commands. It was installed, booted up but after restarting it doesn’t boot anymore, it restarts on every attempt.\nI’m running a Mac Pro 2010, Sierra OSX.\nPlease, would someone help me with that?\n\nA: This answer is based on your comment which is repeated below.\n\nIt was running smoothly on UEFI boot, but after a graphic card driver update it doesn't boot anymore.\n\nAnother possible solution would be to disable Windows Update from downloading and installing driver updates. This can be done using the Local Group Policy Editor (This requires Widows 10 Pro are better.) or from the control panel.\nThe Control Panel steps for Windows 10 (version 1803) are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Start menu select Window System, then select Control Panel.\n\n*Select View by: Small icons.\n\n*Select System.\n\n*Select Advanced system settings.\n\n*Select Hardware tab.\n\n*Select Device Installation Settings\n\n*Select No\n\n*Select Save Changes.\n\n\nThis will require you to reinstall Windows. I suggest not connecting to the internet until you have disabled driver updates and installed the Window Support Software from Apple.\nYou may also want to try to see if you can get Windows 10 to Safe Boot. Boot from the Windows 10 installation media (DVD or USB flash drive) and at the first menu enter the shift+F10 key combination. Enter the following command in the window.\nbcdedit  /set  {default}  safeboot  minimal\n\nClose all windows to restart the Mac. If you can get Windows to boot, then maybe you could rollback the graphic device driver.\n\nA: Here are some realities regarding what you are attempting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows should be installed using the BIOS boot method on all 2010 Mac models. The primary reason for this is the Windows Support Software from Apple assumes a BIOS booting install of Windows.\n\n*The drive(s) used to install Windows need to be hybrid partitioned. This means the GUID Partition Table (GPT) is used for macOS and the MBR partition table is used for Windows.\n\n*Usually, installing 64 bit Windows 10 on a 2010 Mac should work, even though Apple does not officially support this configuration. \n\n*You should use the Window Support Software downloaded using the Boot Camp Assistant on your 2010 Mac or by directly downloading from Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621. Basically, you are using Windows 7 drivers for a Windows 10 install. Windows is designed to accept older drivers when new ones are unavailable. \n\n*I believe you are suppose to temporarily remove the primary drive when installing Windows on a secondary drive with the 2010 Mac Pro. Although, this could be overcome by installing a small Windows boot partition on the primary drive. Most of Windows 10 would then reside on the drive in the optical drive bay. Basically, you boot Windows from the primary drive and Windows then transfers control to the secondary drive.\n\n\nA: It is important to realize that Apple does not support all versions of Windows on all Macs. It is not that they are not capable, it is just that Apple didn't write drivers for older Macs.\nThat said if you go here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204990#models you will find that the earliest Mac Pro that supports Windows 10 is the Late 2013 model (sometimes referred to as the trash can or cylinder model).\nTho some people have had success downloading drivers for similar hardware from a manufacturers website that is a bit of a crap shoot and, I believe, off-topic for AskDifferent.\nSo it is likely that it doesn't work because it is not specifically supported.\n", "Q: How does one change default options in CUPS I want to change default print settings in CUPS. \nI'm mass printing PDF's through Finder and it won't use my preset in the printer options menu so I'm fiddling around in CUPS to see if that works. I want to change the settings as shown below, but I can't find out how?\nEssentially I'm trying to print all pdf's with Scale to fit enabled, if there is some other way I should be doing this. I'd like the heads up :)\n\n\nA: Since I essentially wanted to print all pdf's with Scale to fit enabled. This small command worked.\nlpoptions -o fit-to-page\n\n\nA: Click on the drop-down list that reads \"Administration\". One of the other options there is \"Set Default Options\". \nYou can then modify the default options of your printer. However, whether \"Scale to Fit\" is shown as an option will depend on the printer's characteristics.\n", "Q: Stream Netflix movie from iPhone to Mac I have a 2017 MacBook Pro and an iPhone 8. I use Netflix app on my iPhone and have downloaded a movie in it for offline viewing.\nIs there a way for me to stream the movie on my iPhone onto my MacBook? I can use the MacBook's larger screen for better viewing experience.\nCan download Netflix on to phone but can't seem to do it on Mac?\n\nA: Netflix killed Airplay support on April 2019, so it is not possible anymore to use AirPlay in a macOS device to stream from a iOS one.\nSee this support article at Netflix for more information.\n\nA: Stream from your iPhone or iPad or iPod Touch to your Mac\nThe Netflix app for iOS supports AirPlay, a proprietary protocol stack developed by Apple, which allows wireless streaming between devices of multimedia content. This means that you can stream Netflix movies and shows from your iOS devices to any AirPlay-enabled devices over local Wi-Fi. And because the app also supports offline downloads, you have everything you need to enjoy Netflix offline on your Mac. Well, almost everything. You also need an app like AirServer so you can receive AirPlay streams on your Mac.\nThe easiest and proven solution is to access Netflix via Google Chrome browser on your Mac as @Nimesh Neema explained. You can even stream to any TV using Chromecast in Google Chrome browser and with $35 Cast dongle device (at any best buy) that plugs into any TV with HDMI plug. \n\nA: You can connect your iPhone via USB to your Mac and use QuickTime to mirror the screen:\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone via USB to your Mac.\n\n\n*On your iPhone, if requested, trust your Mac.\n\n\n*On your Mac, open a Finder window, select your iPhone in the sidebar and, if requested, trust your iPhone:\n\nIf you don't see your iPhone under \"Locations\", open Finder Preferences > Sidebar and check \"CDs, DVDs, and iOS Devices\".\n\n\n*Open QuickTime Player and select File > New Movie Recording.\n\n\n*Click the Options pop-up menu and choose for Camera your connected iPhone.\n\n\n*You should see your home screen now.\nSee here (up to step 6) for more information (note that you don't need to actually click the record button for this to work).\nUsing this method you don't need any third party apps. However, it's more of a workaround.\n\nA: It is not be possible to stream a movie downloaded in Netflix iOS app onto Mac.\nThere is no official Netflix macOS app. You can only stream video from Netflix on a desktop computer using a Web browser and Internet connection. It is also not possible to download movie from Netflix website on a desktop computer.\nTo use Netflix on macOS, login with your Netflix account using any desktop Web browser (Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox).\n", "Q: Link pre-installed apps to Homebrew Cask I installed Slack by downloading the DMG from its website and copying the app bundle into /Applications directory. Alternatively, I could have used brew cask install slack.\nIs there a way to make Homebrew aware of this drag-and-drop version of Slack ? Or do I need to remove it and install via brew cask in order for it to be detected by Homebrew?\n\nA: In versions 2.0.5 and above, it seems you can make Homebrew reinstall the Mac app by applying the --force flag:\nbrew install --cask --force slack\n\n\nA: I have found the best way to fix this issue is brew cask reinstall <cask>. Homebrew then removes the old version as if it installed it and the new version is now managed. That for me has been the cleanest solution.\n\nA: No, there is not way to update the Homebrew Cask database with the pre-installed apps.\nIf you wish to have an app installed via Homebrew (so that it gets listed when running brew list --cask), you'll need to remove the downloaded and installed version from the /Applications directory, and install via Homebrew.\n\nA: In homebrew versions 3.0.4 and above, you can force the installation of a brew cask like this:\nbrew install --cask spotify --force\n\nNote that some apps (like Spotify) may require you to authenticate as sudo during the installation to overwrite some of the files in the Applications folder.\n", "Q: Does booting a 2015 iMac from an external disk require \"touching\" the internal disk? The hard drive (a Fusion Drive) on my 2015 iMac has become badly corrupted, possibly getting into that state via some incompatible ram that had previous been installed in it. (The ram was removed and the computer is in its stock configuration now.) The computer won't boot past the login screen or boot into recovery mode without a kernel panic.\nWhen I took it into have it examined by an authorized repair shop, the tech told me that because the kernel panic prevented booting into recovery mode or target disk mode, that the hard drive needed to be replaced. When I asked whether the drive could be wiped, she said no and that it was impossible without cracking open the computer.\nIs this true? In a standard Windows/Linux based Intel architecture PC, any drive can simply be ignored at the bios level. Does corruption of the internal hard drive in an iMac really prevent any possible boot attempt via an external drive?\n\nA: No, corruption like what you described here (i.e. non-hardware failure of the disk drive) does not prevent boot attempts on an external drive.\nIn fact you do not even need an external drive. You can just start up the iMac in Internet Recovery Mode to reformat your internal disk and reinstall macOS. You do that by holding down Command+Option+R when powering on your iMac (hold it until you see a spinning globe saying Starting Internet Recovery).\n\nA: For whatever reason, Internet Recovery Mode still tried to query a part of the original disk that was corrupted and induced a kernel panic. Booting up into a macOS USB stick created the same kernel panic, again at boot, not when trying to do an install. However, I was able to boot up using a USB Ubuntu live distro, which worked fine. From there I wiped the disk. Then Internet Recovery Mode worked fine, and I re-partitioned the disk and restored from backup no problem.\nFor the life of me, I sometimes wonder why I bother going to these repair places. They never know anything and then when you confront them with questions they just lie to you.\n", "Q: When did Apple adopt the JIS keyboard layout as it is now for their MacBook Pros?

I have to go in and manually delete the incorrect server, which appears by itself; when I do so, the full correct list shows up and everything returns to normal.\nHow do I prevent OS X from doing this automatically?\n\nA: Firstly, I'm going to assume that your wireless IP address is provided by DHCP (Domain Host Configuration Protocol), in addition to DNS settings from the same DHCP server. \nIt’s not clear how  10.0.0.255 is not a valid and correct DNS as opposed to the DNS handling many requests and responding slowly.\nIf the DNS of 10.0.0.255 really does not work, you may want to check with the campus wireless providers. For all you know; you could be connecting to someone pretending to be the campus wireless; and also failed to setup their fake AP correctly.\nYou could also just manually enter the one correct DNS in your settings which will remove the second response and wait until the network gets fixed.\n", "Q: Can I leave Family sharing on one device while staying on the other? I'd like my MacBook to stay on the family plan while removing my iPhone from the family plan. Both of these devices are under the same Apple ID. Can this be done?\n\nA: Family sharing membership is attached with Apple ID not with individual device(s). If you remove an Apple ID from family sharing, it is applicable everywhere that Apple ID is being used.\n\nA: Clarification on Nimesh's correct answer: If your goal in asking the question is to prevent downloads to the iPhone from being available to other members of the Family Share, you can control that for each download. A quick search online returned the Family Share information page. It explains you can hide purchases to prevent them from appearing in the purchased list on other devices (which includes your purchased list on other members' devices). To hide your downloads the instructions include a link to Hide apps for your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac.\n", "Q: Unable to connect samsung galaxy S5 to mac I'm no longer able to connect a Samsung Galaxy S5 to mac High Sierra!\nI used to use samsung Smart Switch app but after updating it I'm no longer able to access the phone.

I listen to a lot of podcasts and would like to be able to set a timer so that they automatically stop playing after a set period of time. I guess a 'sleep 'timer' function is what I’m looking for but I can’t find anything like this option in the podcasts app.\nI’ve tapped and 3D Touched everywhere that I can think of and see lots of other options, like download, delete, save, play next, share episode, skip 15s, playback speed, subscribe, unsubscribe, settings.

It is in the directory /Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 1\n/Bookmarks \nAnother way to look for the bookmarks is if you had sync the bookmarks to google, one can go to the www.google.com/bookmarks to retrieve the bookmark.\n\nA: Just to be clear... When you say \"I had html links saved within the Chrome browser.\", by that do you mean that you had bookmarked various web pages by using the Chrome > Bookmarks > Bookmark This Page...  or Bookmark All Tabs...? If yes, then the file you want is the\n/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Bookmarks\n\nfile, and I believe it's in JSON format.\nHowever, you'll need to use the Bookmark Manager in Firefox to import the data.\nIn Firefox, click Bookmarks > Show All Bookmarks or just press: Shift-Command-B\nFrom the Library window that opens, in the Toolbar, the last icon on the right click and select: Import Data from Another Browser...\nThen walk through the Import Wizard making the appropriate selections along the way.\n\nA: Every browser has an option to import/export Bookmarks, just have to know where to look.\nIn Chrome go to the menu > Bookmarks > Bookmark Manager\nA new tab opens, on the right side there is a secondary menu on the blue bookmarks bar, click it and select Export Bookmarks.\n\nA: Since as you say.

I'm assuming the DHCP server was re-using an IP that was previously leased to the other device.\nYou mentioned that scutil --get HostName did not show the offending hostname, but did it show any hostname set at all? If not, try setting one explicitly:\nsudo scutil --set HostName Darren\nThat seemed to work for me. The HostName attribute shouldn't be overridden by DHCP, if it is set. But, in practice, this changes all the time as the host name gets set at boot and bash honors whatever old name DNS/DHCP has for the last device to use the IP address issued. This is a problem with your network issuing a new name. You could try to force bash to keep re-evaluating the correct name, but this has been so for years.

Sometimes the sound would become unlistenably choppy unless I moved the speaker as close as 1 m to the computer.  Normally I use it from a distance of 4-5 metres.\nFinally, I discovered what triggers the problem: an in-progress Time Machine backup to a directly connected external hard drive. The sound becomes choppy only when the external disk is being used. It is not correlated with CPU usage, which is never high.\nIs this behaviour expected? Is there anything I can do to maintain the quality of the Bluetooth connection even when running a backup?  Is the problem caused by radio interference from the hard drive, or some sort of \"slowdown\" of the computer (e.g. too many hardware interrupts)?\nI should note that the speaker has a perfect Bluetooth connection to other devices (such as mobile phone), even when those devices are placed next to the computer during a running backup. This led me to believe that the problem is not simply due to radio interference, and gave me hope that there may be a fix.\n\nA: This is one of those trial and error situations that you'll just have to explore.  I know for sure that Read/Write from backing up do consume both CPU and Memory. So if your backing up a ton of data and especially if your Hard Drive is the mechanical kind not SSD then in my experience playback of music from iTunes or files actually on the computer.\nThe only way to really know is first you must take out some variables. If your internet connection is solid use youtube or another streaming service so that we can somewhat negate the read/write of a file being played off the Hard Drive (buffering does do some of that for streaming but I'd wager not as much). Ok now to test!\n1. Make sure your Mac has all it's updates and firmware updated. With very few exceptions all newer bluetooth revisions can speak with older bluetooth. Backwards compatible that is. But it would be good to make sure it's not an OS issue first.\n2. If you have another bluetooth speaker try and recreate the issue by using it instead and then doing a backup.  If nothing happens then great you have just figured out that it's probably your bluetooth speaker that's failing somehow. (which would be weird but hey stranger things have happened) If it still cuts out move to step #3.\n3. To figure out if interference is the cause get the longest cord you have that connects to your external backup and move it as far away from the Mac. Be sure to put it away from \"line of sight\" path of your bluetooth speaker.  Now do a backup. If it was the issue I'd really consider getting a new backup drive as that would be crazy that it was putting out that much interference.\nI hope this gave you some guidance on maybe where to start. I know there wasn't a solution nor was there a bunch of technical OS stuff you could try because honestly there shouldn't be a correlation to bluetooth acting up when doing a backup between the OS and your speaker. I listen from a bluetooth speaker all day with 4 external backup drives and a ton of audio gear (grounded mind you but still making tons of interference).  So the only thing I can see it being is either speaker, OS or Hard Drive hurting while doing a backup so it can't play properly.\n", "Q: Bootcamp Not enough space but nothing helps!

If you shrink your macOS partition to the minimum recommended size of 95.6 GB, then you can create 25.5 GB of free space for Windows 10. (In other words: 121.1 GB - 95.6 GB = 25.5 GB) This Microsoft website states you will need 20 GB to install Windows 10, but the Boot Camp Assistant creates a temporary partition to hold the Windows installation files. This additional space is larger than the difference between 25.5 GB and 20 GB. The Boot Camp Assistant will not install Windows because there really is not enough free space.\nOne possible solution would be to use a 16 GB or larger flash drive to hold the Windows installation files. Once the files are transferred to the flash drive, you could delete them from the macOS volume and thus create more free space.\nOne possible procedure to install Windows 10.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the the Boot Camp Assistant to download the latest Windows Support Software for your Mac. Look for the \"Action\" pulldown on the Boot Camp Assistant menu bar. On my Mac, these files were downloaded to the ~/WindowsSupport directory.\n\n*Create a FAT32 formatted volume labeled \"BOOTCAMP\" on the 3rd partition of the primary disk. Basically, enter the command below in a Terminal application window.\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 96G FAT32 BOOTCAMP 0\n\n\n*Use the Disk Utility application to erase a 16 GB or larger flash drive. Choose the parameters shown in the image below.\n\n\n*Mount the Windows iso file and copy the contents to the \"WINSTALL\" volume. In my case, the label \"ESD-ISO\" was used to identify the Windows iso. To perform the copy operation, you will need the enter the cp command from a Terminal application window. Below are the commands I usually enter. If necessary, make the appropriate modifications.\ncd  /Volumes/WINSTALL\ncp  -Rv  /Volumes/ESD-ISO/  $PWD\n\n\nNote: This command will take a while to complete. Be patient!\n\n\n*Copy the Windows Support Software to the \"BOOTCAMP\" volume. Below is the command I usually enter. If necessary, make the appropriate modifications.\ncp  -Rv  ~/Downloads/BootCamp5/  $PWD\n\n\n*Next, you need to boot from the flash drive. Hold down the option key immediately after restarting your Mac. Release the option key when the Startup Manager window appears. Select the icon labeled \"EFI boot\". Next, select the arrow below the \"EFI boot\" label.\n\n*Install Windows. When asked: \"Where do you want to install Windows?\", proceed as follows. First select the \"BOOTCAMP\" partition. Next, click on the \"Format\" button. Finally, click on the \"Next\" button.\n\n*If the Mac boots back to macOS, goto the Startup Disk pane of the System Preferences application, unlock, select Windows and click on Restart button. Windows will continue installing.\n\n*When Windows finishing installing, make sure the Windows Support Software is installed.\n\nA: I had the same error 4 days now searching what is the problem.

Now that you are not storing your files in the cloud what you have to do is make a folder anywhere on your Mac.  Here is where it gets fun ... maybe not so much. The end goal is to fill your HD / SSD up to the brim and then delete that data you just put there. This will force the OS to free up the purgeable space and then you can just delete the data you just created and viola! Space back on your Mac.\nFirst Create a folder on your desktop. Then You need to find the largest folder on your drive in your home folder and copy it to the folder you just created. keep duplicating it inside the folder you just created for ease of use.  What this does is fill up your drive and force the OS to make room by deleting the purgeable space. When you are all filled up you just delete the folder on your desktop that had all the duplicates and ... BAM free space.\n:End of EDIT:\nSince you've tried removing time machine local snapshots then the only course for you to take is to remove your Recovery Partition.

Go back to the Mac App Store and download the update. \nIf it's not available on the App Store yet (review process delay), try downloading direct from 1Password's download page.\n*Edit: Posted on their forum from 1Password support:\n\nA build flag got set improperly / prematurely which caused WebSockets\n  (which Safari relies on) to be turned off for the 7.1 build. We\n  disabled that flag for 7.1.1. Safari is the only browser which\n  currently uses WebSockets, the rest use Native Messaging. We are\n  working toward moving away from WebSockets for Safari and toward\n  Apple’s Safari App Extension framework.\n\n", "Q: Trash directories on mac - How to find them and how to properly clear them So, I am writing a little piece of software in Go. It is a library that allows clearing the trashbin and moving files into the trashbin. However besides ~/.Trash there are other trash folders per drive. What would be the most correct way of clearing those?\nIs it just iterating over /Volumes and deleting the .Trashes on every volume and recreating it afterwards?\nIs there official documentation on it, if so I couldn't find it.\n\nA: Spotlight can locate folders with a specific name on all mounted and indexed volumes (but it's not going to be the answer - bear with me):\nmdls ~/.Trash/\n\nThis will show you that the kMDItemFSName is \".Trash\" so you might try mdfind to do a spotlight search\nmdfind \"kMDItemFSName == '.Trash'\"\n\nSadly, this won't find the trashes since Apple has made them invisible and probably excluded them entirely from the spotlight indexing. But, this is the best Apple way to search for general files.\nSo now, you need to crawl the filesystem:\nfind / -name .Trash -print\n\nThis will throw filesystem errors, so you'll need to engage root - be careful with sudo - you can ruin a system so you can't boot if you move or delete files (which is what you're about to do - find things and then delete them)\n sudo find / -name .Trash -print\n\nEven without the sudo you'll find most of the trashes since your user should be able to write to Trash to store files there.\nNow, there is a tool faster than find (it may take tens of minutes or perhaps hours if it starts crawling remote or connected drives)\nlocate .Trash\n\nThe locate database won't likely be built when you ask for it, so follow the instructions it prints if you don't have a pre-made locate database to consult. Happy scripting. Feel free to ask a follow on question on how to delete if you need that help too, but this answers how to find files specifically hidden system ones like the various trash files.\nOr, you know - just tell Finder to empty the trash from the command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I empty the trash from the Terminal?\nBoom, now you're done super fast no matter where or how the folders are named.\nosascript -e 'tell app \"Finder\" to empty' \n\n", "Q: 2016 MacBook Pro won't get past the Login Screen My laptop running 10.13.6, has been working great without any issues until I restarted it on Monday. After I logged in, it got stuck on the loading screen and displaying a loading icon for over an hour. \nOver the past couple of days, the only way I can get past logging in, is from restoring from a time machine backup. I have tried the following without any luck:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot in Safe Mode - this freezes like this every time \n\n*Repair the Disk\n\n*Reset NVRAM and PRAM\n\n*Reinstalling the OS\nI have seen that running diagnostics on restart might let me know what is going on if it is a hardware issue, I am just afraid to restart my computer because it takes all day to restore. Can this be run from terminal without restarting? Is there anything else I should be trying before I go into the Apple store?\n\nA: On a hunch \nrepair your disk\nBoot in Single user Mode \"CMD S\"\nAs the Mac boots in this mode, the screen reports each step of the process. Wait until the scrolling white text stops. The last line should end in root#.\nRight after the root# prompt, enter the following:\n/sbin/fsck -fy\n\nPress the Return key.\nYou’ll see the prompts in the picture above as each part of the hard drive’s directory is checked. (Checking extents overflow file, Checking catalog file, Checking multi-linked files, etc.) It will take a few minutes. At the end, if your drive was OK, the screen will say “The volume (name of your hard drive) appears to be OK”. If any repair was made, you’ll see the prompt, “FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED”. Then, you’ll see the root# prompt again.\nRight after the root# prompt, enter the following:\nreboot\nPress the Return key. Your Mac should restart normally.\n", "Q: How do I send compass app data to apple watch? Ok, I was very disappointed to know iWatch doesn't come with a most basic wrist watch feature: a compass.\nIt's reasonable that due to magnets used in coils and straps, it's not possible to include a magnetic sensor.\nBut is there any way we can send the data of iPhone's compass app to watch. Better yet, a complication?\nI have Googled it online, but found no luck. \n\nA: There's currently no way to get data from the iPhone's Compass app to your Apple Watch, and no complication option available. There is no API on watchOS for compass heading and you would need to have your iPhone / iPad out and pointing in a specific location for the watch to match the iOS device.\nI suppose you could mount the phone to a stand inside a ship or vehicle and know that the watch is showing where the other device is pointing and not necessarily where your watch is \"pointing\"\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/getting_heading_and_course_information\nThis sort of \"making do with what's available\" is documented here in open source as well as dozens of App Store apps where no one in particular stands out as good or useful to me.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/woutercx/iOS.Compass.Sample\nYou would have to adapt that for watchOS complication and iOS companion app. \nIn the Watch app on your iPhone you'll find an App Store icon on the bottom that allows you to search for Apple Watch apps directly. You'll find there's a number of Compass apps available you can try doing exactly what the code above allows and no more or no less.\nThere isn't a magnetometer in the watch so it doesn't get it's own magnet in early 2019 at least.\n", "Q: Adobe Shockwave Player PKG installed but I can't find the application I just downloaded adobe swf on my computer.

I have an issue with my iPhone SE running iOS 11.4.1. I already spoke with support, and they are saying that it is hardware issue.\nDo you know which microphone it is used during video conversation in FaceTime? Because this microphone works pretty well, but when I record something in Camera app, I hear only noise. Whatsapp, Messenger, Siri can't hear me too.\nI already did a fresh install of iOS using iTunes. If this is hardware issue, then microphone shouldn't also work during videocall on FaceTime, or FaceTime is using other (bottom) microphone. Can someone confirm?\n\nA: After doing much research as I have similar problem on my daughters phone, it seems apps like WhatsApp when on speakerphone use the front top microphone where as FaceTime on speakerphone uses front bottom microphone. Easy check is to record a front face video and hear of sound is captured. \n\nA: There are 3 microphones in the iPhone.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203792\n\n\n*\n\n*The bottom microphone is for Voice Memo and phone calls. The other microphones serve as error cancellation\n\n*The (top) front microphone is used for FaceTime calls, Siri and selfie videos with the front camera (FCAM). The top back microphone serves as error cancellation\n\n*The (top) back microphone is used for videos with the rear camera (RCAM). The top front microphone serves as error cancellation\n\n\nMake sure you update your device to the latest version of iOS and then try to isolate which microphone is not working properly by trying each individual microphone with the related apps above. If the issue affects more than one microphone, then it could be the Audio Codec IC on the logic board.\n\nA: I did it, and it seems that FaceTime is using bottom mic, not front - it is a mistake in this article. \nPhone calls, voice memo works\nCamera, siri does not work.\nFaceTime video conf works.\n\nA: You should take your phone to Apple Support. They will replace the front microphone. That is the microphone used for Siri and Facetime.\nFrom this Apple Discussion:\n\nThat would be the front microphone. You would need to have the phone checked at an Apple Store. If you try to do any repairs yourself, you will void any future support from Apple.\n\n", "Q: Difficulty to inherit Time Machine backups on new MacBook Pro I'm having difficulties to inherit Time Machine backups on a new MacBook Pro. I've read many Q&A on the same topic, but none was a solution for my case (that's why I don't think this is a duplicate).\nI have no access to my old MacBook Pro, so this is crucial for me. I have two Time Machine backups, one on an external Hard Drive and one on a Time Capsule.

I'm currently building an app with Cordova, and it appears that on the last alpha version, the app only works in the iOS Simulator. When ran on an iPhone X, the app is crashes immediately.\nI'm not familiar at all with software development for Apple platform, so I was wondering:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are my options to understand what is wrong?\n\n*Is there some kind of things that I should be aware of to avoid silent crash?\nI know we can link an iPhone with the Safari debugger, but I assume this will only work for browser inspection, not app debugging.\n\nA: You can debug the app by running it on device via Xcode.\nFirst lets get the pre-requisites right. You'll need access to a Mac with recent version of macOS and Xcode installed (preferably latest for each, macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 and Xcode 9.4.1).\nAfter you have your Mac ready, get access to the source code for the app. Open the xcodepoject file for the project file with Xcode. The project file for a project named Sample looks like this in Finder:\n\nOnce you have the project open with Xcode, your next step will be to successfully build it. Do it by pressing Shift + Command + r or selecting Product → Build For → Running from the Xcode Menu bar. A successful build (no compilation errors) is indicated by this HUD shown on the desktop:\n\nNext step would be to run on device. Connect your iPhone X to your Mac using the lightning cable. Verify that the device is connected and is recognized by Xcode as will be shown in the run destination selection dropdown in the Xcode toolbar:\n\nOnce the device and the app name is selected in the dropdown as shown above, to run the app, click on the play button in the toolbar, or select Product → Run from the Menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut Command + r.\nNow the app should launch on your iPhone. Make sure your iPhone is unlocked and both the Mac and iPhone have trusted each other. You will need to add your registered Apple developer ID into Xcode to be able to debug app on device (if not done so already).\n\nAssuming that everything mentioned above is setup correctly, you should be able to launch the app on your iPhone via Xcode and debug it.\nDetecting Crash:\nAs you mentioned that your app is crashing on launch, I am assuming you are getting the build onto device and experiencing it. To pin-point the reason for crash in your apps code, you can take the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to the Breakpoint Navigator in Xcode by pressing Command + 8 or selecting View → Navigators → Show Breakpoint Navigator in the Menu bar.\n\n*Click on the Create a breakpoint button indicated by + shown in the bottom toolbar area.\n\n\n\n*Select Exception Breakpoint...\n\n\n\n\n\n*Click outside the popup to dismiss. Make sure that the breakpoint is enabled to be able to catch the reason for crash.\n\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to get the Disk Image property using terminal?

I am currently running macOS Sierra 10.12.6 on my Mac. I am in the process of upgrading the OS to the current public release macOS High Sierra 10.13.6. Will I lose my data during the upgrade process?\n\nA: No.\nGenerally speaking, upgrading to a subsequent major release of macOS doesn't erase/touch user data. Pre-installed apps and configurations too survive the upgrade. Upgrading macOS is a common practise and carried out by lot of users every year when a new major version is released.\nHowever, you should be cautious and be responsible for the sanity of your data. Upgrades doesn't negate the possibility of going wrong, and in the unlikely case, may cause damage to the hard drive, thereby causing you to lose access to data.\nIt is highly recommended to keep properly working data backup when doing a sensitive activity like OS upgrade.\nI'll put extra emphasis on having a backup that works! A backup that doesn't work is as good as no backup.\nEnsuring you have proper power backup and uninterrupted Internet connectivity, you should be fine with a high degree of probability. Having a backup ensures complete peace of mind :)\n\nA: I have upgraded a lot of macOS devices (many from back when it was still OS X) and through both minor and major updates I have never lost any data.\nWhat you can lose are certain applications that were not updated and are no longer compatible with the new version. If you have data that can only be read through these applications, your data can be effectively \"lost\", even though it is still there. This is the one thing you should check carefully.\n\nA: No, as @nimesh-neema said, you will not lose your data but it is both a sensible precaution and good practice to back up your data.\nOccasionally an application may be replaced (or updated) with the upgrade and then you may lose settings associated with the application, or the new application will have only default settings, which is small consolation as it can still feel like you've lost data.\nBut there is always the risk of a glitch or corruption in the upgrade process and, after the upgrade, you are presented with what looks like a \"clean\" installation - without any of your files or folders. In most cases these are still on the disk (somewhere ;-) ) and can be recovered, but it is usually easier to reload from a backup (because you know where that is and don't have to hunt for anything).\n", "Q: macOS Mail crashes when window is closed (app brought into background) For the last year (possibly longer) the Mail app on my iMac crashes after I close the window (not quit, just close using the red X button in the top left corner, or with cmd+w).

Recently, the game developer blocked me from the game because I was complaining (long story).  \nNow, I would just like to play the game on my iPhone app without having anything to do with my Facebook account.  However, the app also blocks me because of the one time of signing in using my Facebook login.  I don’t even get to a screen where I can log out of the Facebook info.  I have tried deleting the app, blocking the app on Facebook, signing out of my Facebook in my safari and deleting the Facebook app, signing out of apple gameroom, and even using a different Apple ID.  Nothing seems to work because when I reinstall the app, it appears that it must still be automatically logging me into the game with my Facebook creditials.  My iPhone must be providing the info to the app automatically once it is launched.  \nAny advice on how to stop this so I can play the game?  I just don’t know what I’m missing.  Can app developers somehow log identifying information from a specific iPhone?\nThanks in advance for any help!!\n9/2/18 update - I spoke with Apple support.  They basically said the only way I can play the app is if I find a way to mask the identifying 2 bits of info the developer has about me through DeviceCheck when I download and reinstall the app.  Does anyone know if this is possible?  Apple support was unsure.\n\nA: If you want to remove personally identifying data (for example tokens or whatnot) that the developer has stored about you in the Keychain on your device, you'll need to not only delete that specific app - but also delete any other app created by the same developer. I.e. other apps that share Keychain access with the problematic app will retain the data.\nThe developer also has the possibility of storing 2 bits of information unique for your device - the so called DeviceCheck API. The bits are stored at Apple and won't be deleted when you uninstall the problematic app and all other apps by that developer.

I tried hdiutil info -plist, but if I shift the DMG file elsewhere after mounting it, it doesn't update the DMG path. If I right click and select 'Get info' on the volume, I'm able to view the correct DMG path.\n\nA: A somewhat pedestrian way would be to retrieve the name of your DMG file from the output of hdiutil and then search for it, e.g., via\nhdiutil info -plist | grep dmg | sed 's/<string>\\([^<]*\\)<\\/string>/\\1/' | xargs basename | xargs mdfind -name\n\nYou may need to modify the grep dmg part to be smarter if you have several images mounted, or you loop through all DMG files reported by hdiutil, e.g.,\nfor F in `hdiutil info -plist | grep dmg | sed 's/<string>\\([^<]*\\)<\\/string>/\\1/'`\n  do basename $F | xargs mdfind -name\ndone\n\nHowever, none of the above takes your mount path as input. To do that, you could add a sed command in the pipe that extracts the paragraph of interest, e.g.,\nhdiutil info -plist | tail -r | sed -n '/\\/Volumes\\/MOUNTNAME/,/dmg/p' | grep dmg | sed 's/<string>\\([^<]*\\)<\\/string>/\\1/' | xargs basename | xargs mdfind -name\n\nPerhaps it is also easier to work on the direct output of hdiutil info, without the -plist flag.\n\nA: macos 11.6.8\nhdiutil info | grep image-path | sed 's/.*: //'\n\n", "Q: Distinguish apps in OSX task switcher I use Google Chrome for two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*manually browsing the web\n\n*automatically control websites via Selenium\n\n\nSo the Chrome App now runs in two windows and I have no way to distinguish them in the task switcher:\n\nIs there a trick to exchange logos or show some text to easier identify the windows?\n\nA: Make sure you have two separate Google Chrome binaries (i.e. two .app's). Then use Finder and right-click and select Get Info for one of those binaries. The original app icon is displayed in the top left corner of the window. Drag any other icon file on top of it, and the icon of the program will change.\nYou'll probably have to restart Chrome in order for this to show up in the app switcher.\nAn even easier way would be to use Chrome Canary for browsing and ordinary Chrome for Selenium (if that is acceptable for your use case).\n", "Q: Avoid two-character umlauts in PDFs Introductory explanation\nAn umlaut is a German vowel, represented in writing as a letter with two dots (diaeresis) over the basic vowel. Examples of umlauts are ä, ö, and ü.\nThese three letters can be represented in text either as one single character – for example, ü as Unicode U+00FC – or as two characters: the basic vowel (e.g. u, U+0075) and the combining diaeresis ( ¨, U+0308).\nBoth the single character umlaut and the two-character umlaut look the same in a PDF document, but their underlying code is different. This animation shows text copied from the same (!) PDF file opened in Firefox (top) and Preview (bottom) into a plain text editor (BBEdit) and then deleting individual letters:\n\nWhen the umlaut is represented as one character, and you search for a German word with an umlaut, e.g. Tür \"door\", in a text, you will find that word if it is there. If on the other hand the umlaut is represented as two characters and you search for Tür, you will not find it:\nDie Tür ist offen.  <= you will find \"Tür\" in this text\nDie Tu¨r ist offen. <= you will not find \"Tür\" in this text\n\nQuestion\nIn Apple's Preview and Safari, but also in the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC (18.011.20058), umlauts in PDF documents are represented as two characters (vowel plus diaeresis), while in the same PDF document, when I open it in Firefox, Chrome, or an older version of Adobe Acrobat X Pro (10.1.16), they are represented as a single character.\nWhy is that so, and how can I avoid two-character umlauts when I create PDF documents?\n\nA: Whether you wind up with 1 or 2 characters depends on how Unicode Normalization is applied by the apps and processes you are using.  \nI don't know if there is any way to guarantee one or the other except perhaps via a utility like UnicodeChecker.\nSince the two forms are equivalent, a competent search system should find either of them.\n", "Q: Recommended way to move data when changing hard drive in a Mac I'm considering upgrading the SSD in my mid 2014 MacBook Pro. I'm wondering:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I backup my hard drive with Time Machine, will I be able to use Time Machine to paste my current content (whole or parts, OS, documents, configuration etc.) to the new (and bigger) SSD?\n\n*Would it be relevant (performance wise) to do a fresh install of macOS instead of pasting my old HD content (OS included)? \n\n*Any other things I should consider during this upgrade?\n\nA: I assume you purposing making a Time Machine backup to a external third drive then use the Migration Assistant to restore from this backup. Another option would be to put the old drive in a shell and plug into a USB port. You could then just use the Migration Assistant to restore after a fresh install of macOS to the new SSD.\n\nA: It would be advisable to perform a Time Machine backup of your current drive, preform a fresh install of macOS on the new SSD and then use the Migration Assistance to restore from Time Machine backup.\nApple support document, How to move your content to a new Mac is a relevant read here.\nPerforming a fresh install of macOS will give you the advantage of getting rid of the baggage left behind by uninstalled software and best performance as far as OS installation is concerned.\nUsing the Migration Assistance, you'll be able to restore your user data, apps and configuration.\nMake sure to test the Time Machine backup and ensure its sanity before erasing your old drive.  Better, verify that everything is OK in the new drive after migration.\nA non-functional backup is as good as no backup.\n\nAdditional Note: As mentioned by Tetsujin, run Migration Assistant at the first run of the newly installed OS, otherwise you end up with 2 accounts & have to merge them manually.\n\nA: I would recommend using Carbon Copy Cloner (https://sites.fastspring.com/bombich/product/ccc5) to create a bootable external drive with a recovery partition. Then you can replace the internal drive, boot from the external drive, and restore on to the new drive.\nIt is not free, but it is superior to Time Machine in some ways. (The two are really intended for different purposes.) Even if you can succeed in doing your current task with Time Machine, a more thorough backup solution has advantages for your future, if you have a disk failure.\nAlthough TimeMachine can be used to restore a system, it assumes the existence of a working recovery partition on the hard drive. If the hard drive is corrupted or has died and that is not the case, then it won't work.\nAfter CCC (Carbon Copy Cloner) backs up your drive, it asks if you want to create a Recovery Partition on the destination. This enables you to create an external drive with all the booting and recovery options as your internal drive.\nSo hypothetically, if you have created such an external drive, you could replace your internal drive with a bare, unpartitioned, unformatted new drive, and restore it to your previous internal drive's state using CCC. (You might need to partition it separately with Disk Utility, I'm not sure.)\nIn addition, having the CCC external drive would enable you to use your computer as you did before (though more slowly) until you could restore your internal drive back to working condition.\n", "Q: Old iMessages are changing colors?

I have a late-2013 MacBook Pro 15\" which still has the original battery. It's at 1,144 charging cycles, and a few days ago the battery health was at about 50%, though since then it plunged to 4%.\nThe output of pmset -g batt:\nNow drawing from 'AC Power'\n -InternalBattery-0 (id=xxxxxxx)    100%; charged; 0:00 remaining (Poor/Good)\n    failure: \"Permanent Battery Failure\" present: true\n\n(Just yesterday, the output was the same except for failure: \"Fuse Blown\".)\nThe output from System Information:\nBattery Information:\n\n  Model Information:\n  Serial Number:    [redacted]\n  Manufacturer: SMP\n  Device Name:  bq20z451\n  Pack Lot Code:    0\n  PCB Lot Code: 0\n  Firmware Version: 702\n  Hardware Revision:    1\n  Cell Revision:    1206\n  Charge Information:\n  Charge Remaining (mAh):   308\n  Fully Charged:    Yes\n  Charging: No\n  Full Charge Capacity (mAh):   319\n  Health Information:\n  Cycle Count:  1144\n  Condition:    Replace Now\n  Battery Installed:    Yes\n  Amperage (mA):    0\n  Voltage (mV): 11090\n\nThe battery/power icon on the menu bar also indicates Condition: Replace Now.\nAccording to a series of other posts (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), when the battery is detected as dead or removed, the CPU is throttled to its slowest possible speed. This is what happened to me two days ago: after a restart (due to taking out the power adapter a few seconds before closing the lid), the computer was running very very slowly and iStat Menus was always showing a CPU clock speed of 800 MHz.\nNow, I understand the battery is shot and needs replacing, and I have ordered a new one, but it won't arrive overnight. I need to keep using the laptop in the meanwhile as it is the only computer I have. It's really painful to work with the CPU permanently throttled to 800 MHz, and I'm looking for a temporary fix.\nAs I understood from other answers, this might be impossible, but funnily enough, I was fiddling around with this yesterday, and at some point, the computer suddenly felt snappy again (this happened at about the same time I was using pmset to change hibernatemode from 3 to 25, but it's probably not related). Checking iStat Menus, the CPU was no longer being throttled. This is exactly what I needed to hold out for the period until the battery arrives.\nUnfortunately, this morning the laptop rebooted again. This is despite the fact that I closed the lid on the computer, waited until the fans stopped, and only then took out the power adapter, but still, when I connected the power adapter again and opened the lid, it had rebooted. Now the CPU is stuck at 800 MHz again and the computer is again unusable.\nMy question is: since it came out of throttling once (although I'm not sure what happened, or what I did, that was responsible), is there anything I can do to make it come out of throttling again?\n\nA: Possible Solution 1:\nThe proposed solution by Henry Gross-Hellsen is the most common one. It didn't work for me, but there are quite a few people responding that it worked for them.\nI removed the entire IOPlatformPlugin.kext, but still CPU is reported as 0.80Ghz (800Mhz). Confirmed the kext removed, and on rebuild of kext sudo kextcache -i / it complained it was missing.\nMy only reasoning for this is it matters what device you're trying this on. The people who report it has worked for them either are on MacBook Air or MacBook~ that are much older than mine (mine is 2015). Or they don't mention what their device is at all, so hard to say it'll work on \"newer\" macs.\nRelevant link: https://eclecticlight.co/2019/02/25/playing-with-fire-dealing-with-slow-hot-macs/ That hasn't been posted much. But it explains that most of the kext being removed are for 2013 and older machines. Which could explain why it didn't make a difference for me on my 2015 MacBook Pro.\nPossible Solution 2:\nWhat does work for me, and you touched upon it, if I let my Mac go into default Energy Saver settings naturally, I get speeds back again. This is 100% reproducible for me.\nThe only issue I have is I can't mimic this through pmset. I still have the kext removed from 'Solution 1' above, not sure if it has a impact on why this works.\nI won't investigate this further into getting the right pmset settings to trigger this manually and then having startup script because like all the people who have this question, we quickly get a replacement and move on. But I hope this information is useful for others who need a quick fix without feeling too much urgency in getting a new battery / computer.\n=======================\nAnother interesting find is https://volta.garymathews.com/ which is a app (probably loads a kext) that is doing the opposite of what we're trying to accomplish (undervolting or underclocking the CPU to save power). But it's interesting since if this is possible, then preventing it should also be possible. \nOn the website it reads:\n\nOnly compatible with Haswell and Broadwell processors (Macbooks from 2013 - 2015). This functionality has been prevented on later generations.\n\nHave not tried it as we aren't trying to save power, but use more than 800Mhz. \n\nA: Please note that this can damage your device.. you've been warned. Continue at your own risk\nIn short, IOPlatformPlugin is power management, CPU scaling, idle frequency (and others). How much the following helps is arguable.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable SIP in recovery (CMD+R on boot), open terminal (CMD+3 i\nthink), \ncsrutil disable \n\n*Reboot into MacOS, move\n/System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPlugin.kext to / or somewhere\nelse \nsudo mv /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPlugin.kext /\n(terminal) \n\n*Rebuild cache sudo kextcache -i /, reboot\n\n*Re-enable SIP in recovery csrutil enable\n\nA: I just ran into this exact issue, so I made a KEXT which writes to the IA32_HWP_REQUEST MSR to fix it.\nLink to the TurboMac repository on GitHub.\nAs of writing this it's still in a pre-release state so if there are any issues please report them.\n\nA: This worked for me. However, the MacBook Air then boots and runs with full fan ALL THE TIME. It loses the ability to detect CPU temperature.(and apps like Mac Fan Control, cannot detect the fan)\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System > Library > Extensions.

Well, I noticed it started working after I rebooted a few times! \n\n\nA: On an early 2015 MacBook Air, I managed to achieve this by writing to the IA32_PERF_CTL MSR directly.

I purchased it used and it was missing many parts (wifi card, IO board, SSD). I have replaced all of these parts and purchased an aftermarket SSD (it looks like an M.2 with an adapter on it).\nThe machines internet recovery wants to install Yosemite so I assume this machine is on an older firmware version which predates support for NVME drives. \nAs far as I understand I need a boot rom upgrade that comes with high sierra  in order to boot/use the aftermarket disk. I tried installing Mac OS on an external disk and upgrading it to High Sierra, but I ran into a firmware validation error. \nSince apples boot rom/EFI firmware upgrades are staged on the internal disk, it seems this upgrade path is impossible without an original proprietary apple drive.\nIs there a way to manually install the boot rom/EFI firmware upgrade in this situation? or is my only option to purchase (a very expensive) original apple drive?\nUpdate: I have personally resolved this by sourcing an original drive, running the upgrade, then swapping in the new drive. I will accept an answer to this question if a feasible alternative is proposed. \n\nA: Why not try the (alternate) command and (better) restore using latest macOS?\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\n\nA: You can't install via the (alternate) and (better) restore method if your Mac doesn't have APFS-supported firmware.  It's right there in the link notes.\nThen your recovery gives you the original you shipped with (in my case, Mavericks), and there is no way between here and the moon you can get a boot rom update to work if you don't have an internal SSD.  I've wasted a ton of time on this.\nI would think that someone had come up with a solution as installing 3rd party SSDs is fairly common and there must be some large number of us who are doing so because the original is completely dead.\nSo, I also had to source a used original Apple SSD.  It's beyond annoying, but $40 versus 5 hours of messing with this seems like a good trade.\n", "Q: How exactly is PATH calculated?

(I assume its shell dependent, but what is the commonality between all shells?)\n\n*How exactly is it calculated for GUI apps?\n\n*Am I missing another way of launching stuff? Do daemons do something different? (I don't think so? But maybe...)\n\n\nAdditionally I'm on High Sierra now but I'm seeing some people mentioned that this changed at some point?\nI've seen this answer and this one but both seem to be focused explicitly on what happens inside of bash.\n\nA: I'm going to lump together 1 & 2 because all shells read files at startup.\nPATH is inherited from its parent process. This is a key concept that you need to understand. \nThe PATH is first hard coded into the kernel:\nsysctl user.cs_path\nuser.cs_path: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nlaunchd which acts as init can be configured to change this PATH. Generally it is not changed.\nThe loginwindow.app will setup an environment when you log into your computer. PATH will  be checked that it has been set or it will be set to the hard coded path in the kernel or a modified path set by launchd. It is like the loginwindow.app is calling login -pf <username>.\nAt this point, a user LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon may modify the PATH.\nThis will be the PATH available to GUI applications from the Finder. (Early versions of OS X could use ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist to change the PATH for GUI applications). Now if this seems complicated, it's not and more that likely,like me, the PATH available is /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\nWhen you start the Terminal.app, it first calls login (login -pf ) which triggers your shell to be treated as a login shell. The appropriate files in /etc and your HOME folder are read. Now, PATH should be different than set by the loginwindow.app. Remember we talked about inheritance? If you start a GUI app from within your terminal session then the PATH available to GUI application will be same as set by the shell.\nAs far as daemons, they are usually started by their absolute path.\n\nA: From the man page for PATH (man path):\n\nThe  search  path  for commands.  It is a colon-separated list of\ndirectories in which the shell looks for commands (see COMMAND\nEXECUTION below)....The default path is system-dependent, and is set by the\nadministrator who installs bash. A common value is\n``/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin''.\n\nSo, from that except from the bash man page, we see that the bash path is (initially):\n\n*\n\n*system dependent and not shell dependent\n\n*set by the one who installed bash (in this case Apple)\n\n*has a default value\n\nThe path can (obviously) be modified.  There are several places where the PATH environment variable can be set:\n\n*\n\n*~/.bashrc\n\n*~/.bash_profile\nIn macOS, the file /etc/paths is used to configure the search paths:\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\nAdditionally, the path is initially  configured by the /usr/libexec/path_helper utility which creates a path based on the contents of /etc/paths.d\nIt's called from /etc/profile which sets the system wide bash profile (individual ones are set in ~/.profile)\nAs for GUI apps, the shell path really has no effect.  The only time a GUI application (Cocoa, Quartz, Metal) has anything to do with PATH is when it opens a shell (either interactive or non-interactive). At that point it will use the PATH environment as set or make whatever changes it needs at run time.\nDifferent Shells\nEach of the shells have a different system-wide profile (as does bash) which sets the initial PATH (by calling the path_helper utility)\n\n*\n\n*Zsh = /etc/zprofile\n\n*Ksh = /etc/profile\n\n*Csh = /etc/csh.login\n\nA: All: Please understand that Apple has changed the Paths paradigm over time in Sierra (see https://lluad.com/blog/os-x-system-path/) ,  HighSierra, and Mojave. Path_helper now works somewhat differently it seems because it has locked up terminal windows for me that I can free and have working fine by commenting out\n# if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then\n#   eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\n#  fi\n\nin /etc/profile.\nI have scripts that fix the path because I have several tools working, (the core of them is installed by Homebrew, but that is only about 15 of the 25 that I use every day)  and these have to be set for use in .app applications, in .sh script startups, and for autolaunch in protected boot sequence under Mojave.  It is confusing, but for sure Mojave has changed the structure required and I need to step it up myself.  \nWhat this means for this particular question is that the question is pertinent in all its breadth and that it needs to be answered by devs who have felt the pain and fixed their systems for Mojave, and also come from  the various 'worlds' like normal IDE's, XCode, Eclipse, Bean, Intellij, etc. Also, those who depend upon homebrew stacks, or mamp stacks, etc.  And for those who are doing docker, .node, vm, etc. work, and other deeper tools.  As Apple implements greater security our stuff is going to break, but I am glad that Apple is doing their job.  We need to do ours so we need leading edge folks to pass the new wisdom.  Articles that are 6 or more months old are just going to confuse us.\n", "Q: Game Engine Encryption for iTunes Connect Export Compliance? I am using a Game Engine to create an iOS game app which allows me to drag-and-drop the generated files into Xcode to get the app binary.

(Select Yes even if your app is only utilizing the encryption available in iOS or OS X.)\n\nMore info on the compliance can be found here.\n\nA: You can safely select no in this case.\nThe said clause is applicable if you are encrypting user/app generated data either using iOS SDK provided or any other 3rd party APIs.\nWhat you are getting from the Game engine is getting added as an asset to the Xcode project, which will ultimately generate the iOS app, the clause doesn't apply in your case.\nAdditionally, take a look at this help document from Apple:\n\n\n*\n\n* Export compliance documentation for encryption.\n\n\nIt should further help in answering your query.\n", "Q: How to make Windows 10 run GT120 and GTX 980ti I can't make both cards work properly on Windows 10. Here's what I've tried.\nI've got a successful Windows 10 installation over my Mac Pro (mid 2010) over Sierra, installed the boot camp drivers as recommended on this site. Everything is perfect.\nMy monitor is hooked to the GT 120 (to get access to EFI boot screen), Windows couldn't find the driver for it and found the GTX 980ti automatically. After the reboot request I could notice it wasn't working properly, the resolution screen was ok but you couldn't open any windows, they got stuck on the bottom bar and the icons beside the clock were missing.\nThrough the device manager, I uninstalled the GTX 980ti, asked for Windows to update the GT120 driver, it worked like a charm. After reboot Windows, it found automatically again GTX 980ti, installed it without asking for permission and requested to boot. Again, after booting we returned to the ground zero, GT120 didn't load the driver, and GTX 980ti remained with the same issue.\nI'm not the Windows guy, so I do not even know if that is possible.\nPlease, any help would be welcome.\n\nA: I have not used this tool for a while. When I did, the tool worked, but for me I found the tool badly designed and therefore difficult to use. Hopefully, Microsoft has improved this tool and you will have a better experience.\nThis tool will allow you to prevent an update from installing.

I setup everything well, and it works when going to localhost/~user. In my ~/Sites folder, I have a symbolic link to a folder on my Desktop with my website files in it. I can navigate to the website with localhost/~user/mysite only sometimes. If I get a 403 error, it is fixed with running chmod a+x ~/Desktop. This fixes it until about the next reload, but almost every time I make a change and try to reload the site, I have to run the chmod command. I use Brackets for my web editing, and I have iCloud Drive syncing enabled for the Desktop folder. I think that it is either the iCloud Drive resetting permissions for the folder or Brackets doing something weird. Has anyone had a similar problem and fixed it? This is really annoying and it's slowing down my development.\nEDIT: My httpd.conf file: pastebin\nEDIT: It seems my question was unclear, but what I was asking is why the permissions keep changing on my ~/Dekstop folder. I do chmod a+x ~/Desktop and it fixes my apache 403 errors, but after about a minute this changes and I have to run the chmod command again. I was thinking it might be iCloud Drive sync changing something, or Brackets messing up permissions.\n\nA: I had the same problem with the Documents folder.

(Windows 10 / PC) I have been using an Apple Magic Mouse \"1\" for quite some time now on my Windows 10 PC and I was very content except the damn batteries that needed replacing every once in a while. So I bought an Apple Magic Mouse 2. Shouldn't be that difficult, right? Disconnect the \"1\", connect the \"2\" and go!\nNope. The mouse works fine except it doesn't scroll.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've (re)installed the latest AppleWirelessMouse64.exe from the Bootcamp support software (tried both 5.1.5722 and 5.1.569) and also the BlueTooth driver.\n\n*I've tried switching the mouse off and on again (disconnecting, reconnecting), rebooting, unpairing and (re)pairing\n\n*I've tried MagicUtilities; at first it installed but then my mouse became near unusable. The pointer would jump instead of move with second+ intervals, the mousebutton(s) didn't react to anything. Even not after rebooting, again trying all of the above with pairing, unpairing, switching off and on etc. On boot the mouse worked fine; I could click and move it without issue until MagicUtilities loaded (in the taskbar). Then it seemed to break. So I then uninstalled the software. However the mouse still kept \"jumping\". It turns out MagicUtilities also installs a driver but doesn't uninstall it didn't remove it in my situation. Uninstalled the driver manually, which failed for some reason on several occasions, but, a couple of reboots and \"persuading\" later I had my mouse (or mice) finally back to where I got started.\n\n\nBut, still, the MM1 scrolls just fine, the MM2 doesn't want to. Here's some more of my findings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both mice connected doesn't seem to cause any trouble but, for every step above, I also tried with only the MM1 or MM2 connected.\n\n*When only the MM1 is connected and I open the Mouse settings it has a \"scroll-wheel\" tab. When the MM2 is the only mouse connected the tab disappears. When both are connected the tab shows.\n\n*When I go to the hardware tab there's a difference between both mice's \"location\". One, the MM1, shows \"On Apple Wireless Mouse\", the other, MM2, shows \"On Bluetooth HID-device\".\nSince I've exhausted all of my ideas (I also tried looking at the registry to find differences etc. (didn't change anything ofcourse)) I tried to go back to giving MagicUtilities another, rather reluctantantly, shot; however: it won't install anymore: \"The required Magic Mouse Driver installation failed. Error code is -2147418112\". Again, I've tried rebooting etc. but that doesn't help anything.\nOh, I have even tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connecting the MM2 to my MacBook air. Scrolling works fine. Ofcourse.\n\n*Since my MM1 has a name like \"<joe's mouse>\" I even tried renaming the MM2 to \"<joe's mouse>\" on the MacBook and then going back to my PC, connecting the MM2 (solely) and hoping it would pick up the MM1's settings. To no avail, as expected. But there's always that little spark of hope...\n\n*Disabling Bluetooth Battery Monitor, thinking it may interfere somehow. Didn't make any difference. It does, however, report two mice and two battery levels which is nice.\n\n\nSo now I'm sitting here, at my desk, with a MM1 and MM2, simultaneously (and consecutively) connected and working all fine and dandy EXCEPT for the frikkin' scroll on the MM2 whereas my MM1 scrolls just fine. Thats €89 down the drain...\nSo... now what? Anybody with the tip to get my beloved MM2 to work on my Win 10 64bit machine?\n\nA: Here is Magic Utilities.\nAt this point in time, we are not sure what went wrong in your specific case, but our drivers do uninstall when uninstalling the Magic Utilities.\nYou can always uninstall any Windows driver with Windows pnputil from the command line. First enumerate all drivers, to find the relevant eomXX.inf, then do a forced uninstall of that oemXX.inf file.\nNote: The BootCamp drivers from Apples official webpage do not support the Magic Mouse 2. \nWe'll contact you via email to help you to solve your specific problem.\nThe Magic Team\n\nA: If your goal is simply to get the mouse up and running then Apple's drivers will work just fine on a mac or a pc running windows 10 for free. You just can't download them from the apple website directly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Brigadier https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier/releases\n\n*Open up the command line, navigate to the folder with brigadier\n\n*Run \"brigadier.exe\" if you are on a mac or \"brigadier.exe -m iMac19,2\" without quotes on a pc (-m specifies the model's drivers to get. anything recent should have the proper mouse drivers) This will leave a new folder something like bootcamp-###-##### in the directory from where you ran brigadier\n\n*open Windows Device Manager\n\n*Under Human Interface Devices right click on the Bluetooth HID device and click update driver\n\n*Click Browse my computer for driver software, then let me pick, then have disk\n\n*navigate to the bootcamp folder downloaded with brigadier go to BootCamp\\Drivers\\Apple\\AppleWirelessMouse within this folder and select the AppleWirelessMouse.inf file.\n\n*Click next. The mouse will not work. This is expected. Just reboot the computer and scrolling will work!\n\n\nThis is a free solution that uses apple's drivers. It seems like for such an expensive piece of hardware they would make the driver easier to install on windows too. I guess that's not the Apple way though.\nEDIT\nThanks to Rain9333 for his work to make this driver available directly on github. from his comment under the question this download is available here: https://github.com/Rain9333/MagicMouse2DriversWin10x64\n\nA: After a LOT of trial-and-error I have these findings:\nI had to completely uninstall Bluetooth Battery Monitor; this was the main culprit. Simply \"exiting\" wasn't enough, only when disabled on startup I was able to make some progress and only after actually uninstalling everything started working as it should. Somehow these two applications seem to interfere / bite eachother.\nI had issues with the mouse \"jumping\", not registering any clicks (it did, until Magic Utilities was loaded), I had it showing up as \"not connected\" in Magic Utilities and I had it actually show up as connected whenever I unpaired and re-paired but then in less than 10 seconds it would go back to \"not connected\" etc. It caused all sorts of strange problems. Clicking / moving the mouse at times caused beeps to come out of my speaker (like in the good old days when the keyboard buffer was full or when an application hung in Win 9x).\nUninstalling BlueTooth battery monitor fixed all my problems. Which kind of sucks since I liked it...\n", "Q: Zipping bundle via Automator I am looking for a way to zip a fcpx bundle with an Automator service.

Any ideas? \n\nA: I believe you want to define a watched folder that selects all, compress (zip), rename the archive.zip file, copy for another locations and erase all to wait new files. If the automator action is not working properly you could try using applescript to use Finder commands. For instance open the folder using Finder and run the script:\n\n\nset numberOfFiles to number of files in folder (((path to desktop folder) as text) & \"YourFolder\") \ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\nend tell\ntell application \"system events\"\n    keystroke A using command down -- select all\n    tell process \"Finder\"\n          click menu item \"Compress \" & numberOfFiles & \" Items\" of menu \"File\" of menu bar 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nAfter that carry on with your actions to rename, copy and delete.\n", "Q: Is it possible to set how long the lock screen will disappear on the iPhone?

Is there a way to set it to disappear after 20 or 30 seconds?\n\nA: There is no setting to customise this. The only solution would be to do a screen action so it stays on for longer. Like, swipe up to see your notifications or press the Home Button to the passcode screen and return to the wallpaper screen.\nOn iOS 12 there is a solution.

I scrolled up once to see a chart, and now I can't get the chart\nto go away.\nI can't get the chart in the attached screenshot \nto leave the screen.\n\nHow can I dismiss or hide the part where it says Error retrieving chart?\n\nA: One thing to try is add a few more stocks and then the chart should be off screen. Also, when you tap on a specific index - it should take over with the appropriate chart.\nIf all the indexes are wrong, you might need to remove them and re-add what you need to see if the settings for the app are messed up somehow.\nYou can delete this app entirely and re-install it as well, so that's kind of a last resort item to try.\n", "Q: How to drag folders from Finder into Final Cut without mouse [automator/applescript] Hello guys I'm trying to create a Service to do some repetitive tasks that I have to perform every day.

My internal Drive is about full and I've been looking for ways to clear up some space. My internal drive has a 250 GB capacity and I have around 15 GB of free space. The largest folder on my System is the Library folder listed at 134 GB which appears under my user account. This seems extremely large to me. Inside this Library folder is the Mobile Documents folder at over 91 GB. The largest item in my Mobile Documents directory is a folder named MyBook, which is the name of my external drive. Everything else seems of reasonable size. My question is 2-fold. Why is my 'Library Folder' so Large and is there anything I can do to decrease the size of the Mobile Documents folder.\n\nA: ~/Library/Mobile Documents is the aliased location for iCloud Drive. You can access this from the sidebar or Go > iCloud Drive ⌘⇧-I. If you have a folder in there with the name of your external drive, my guess is that it has been copied by mistake or perhaps a 3rd party backup? I can't think of any built in system that would do that.\nFor other files, you can see exactly what is taking up space for Mobile Documents in the iCloud System preference. Once in that preference pane click on Manage... bottom right. This will show you all of the programs that are storing data and you can delete them as you see fix.

What I currently do is to open the above link in Firefox, then I save the link, then I create a bookmark in safari. I am wondering how can I do this without using a second browser.\n\nA: With only iPad and safari: open the link provided. Now, click on one bookmarklet suitable for you, and open it.\nOn the new window, in the upper part, there is one square with an up arrow, click on that and from the popup menu opened, choose \"Add bookmark\" and save it to your choice (a good one is Favorites page).\nWhen need to translate a page, click first on the big \" + \", choose the \"Google Translate\" icon and open it.

While this can be done by other ways (modify long touch menu) they require editing system files. So obviously js comes to help as links are in DOM. All we need is to extract href from  tag.

My first thought was a clone via Carbon Copy Cloner, but it won't do it, because Apple won't let third parties copy the filesystem that is being used for Time Machine backups (that's what the \"error\"-message says before I can even start the clone).\nThe reason why I need a command line approach is because I want to include the two backups in task-chain in Carbon Copy Cloner.\nEverything I have been trying in that direction fails (no help found online so far), as Time Machine would always start backing up to the same drive over and over again. So what I can say so far: tmutil is not the way to go, no matter what options I choose. But maybe I missed something?\nIf I manually start the backup by clicking \"backup now\" in macOS (High Sierra 10.13.6 by the way), Time Machine will backup to drive 1 first, if I click it again (after backup has finished), backup to drive 2. By the way: same bevaviour if I set a schedule via Time Machine Editor. \nSo I am looking for a Terminal-way to imitate the macOS-approach to start the backup, as it seems this is the only way to make Time Machine use two different drives. tmutil only uses the last destination, again and again. Even if I setdestination to drive 2. But again: maybe I missed something.\n\nA: I don't think using terminal to configure Time Machine to back up to 2 different disks is necessary.  If you have Time Machine setup currently to back up to one external disk, you can go back to the Time Machine preferences in System Preferences and select a different drive to back up to.  After doing this you will be presented with the option of using both drives for Time Machine backups or change the existing drive. If you select the option of using two separate drives, the Time Machine backups will alternate destination drives for each backup.  At least these are the options I am presented with, while using two separate 3 tb Time Capsules.\n \n\n\n\n\nA: I set up multiple destinations and just tell the system to rotate, it then chooses another drive if it’s mounted:\n tmutil startbackup --rotation --block\n\nI often chain these so I get several connected drives both capturing a backup interval now(ish)\n tmutil startbackup --rotation --block; tmutil startbackup --rotation --block\n\nI just use the GUI system preferences to add all my destinations and then I use terminal to mount and unmount the volumes that I want included/excluded from any potential rotation backup event (or normal time to backup event - which defaults to the rotation algorithm as well). I’ve just set the destinations and forgotten them basically.\n\nA: Thank you both for your effort and your help! I should have clarified my setup first, sorry for that! I already had both drives locally attached and selected as destinations in system preferences. \nI DO need the terminal command I have explained in my initial post: I want to run a short shell-script, which I can attach at the end of a finished Carbon Copy Cloner task. I have tried jaumes approach now and it worked: tmutil startbackup --destination <disk id 1> --block; tmutil startbackup --destination <disk id 2> --block. Why didn't I see --destination before?? I ran man tmutil a couple of times. Thank you!\nEdit: someone else replied in the meantime: thank you! I will try the --rotate approach as well. But don't you use --block ? Otherwisee it just jumps to the next command and doesn't wait for the backup, or backupd, to actually finish. I thought that would lead to an error.\n\nA: You need to use argument -a it will add an additional destination. In my case it will backup one by one.\nAn example:\nsudo tmutil setdestination -a /Volumes/BackUpDisk\n\n", "Q: Can't add custom keyboard layout in System preferences I've created the custom keyboard layout using Ukelele and save an obtained bundle to /Library/Keyboard Layouts folder.\nUnfortunately, when I try to add any new layout in System Preferences app (having something in \"Keyboard Layouts\" folder), it just crashes.

I'm not sure what actually happened,  maybe Karabiner downgraded something in my system.\n\nA: So, after some investigation, here’s what I’ve found:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you add .bundle file to any of the possible folders, System Preferences will crash. BUT, if you add .keylayout file instead, it will work!\n\n*If you add a .keylayout file in Home/Library/Keyboard Layouts -> you can add it, it will appear at the layouts list, but you won’t be able to choose your new layout (I read about this bug on this site as well);\n\n*However, if you add a .keylayout file in Macintosh HD/Library/Keyboard Layouts -> everything works correctly.\nSumming it up, custom layouts are BUGGY in macOS, but you can add one. However, the reason I wanted to add a custom layout was to change russian flag to a neutral icon (and it’s possible in Ukelele using .bundle only, because with .keylayout you’ll see default keyboard icon), so I failed here.\n", "Q: MacBook [Pro] or iMac - how many displays, what resolution/frequency?

I want to change the sshd port.  \nI tried to use 'information' in the finder and unlock it.  This didn't work.    I tried: \nAs root, I tried.. \nmacos:LaunchDaemons root# pwd && chown $USER ssh.plist \n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons\nchown: ssh.plist: Operation not permitted\n\nI also tried to cp the file to my own Desktop, edit it in situ and cp it back. \nmacos:LaunchDaemons root# pwd && cp /Users/darren/Desktop/ssh.plist .\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons\ncp: ./ssh.plist: Operation not permitted\n\nI did this before - a while back.  I think it was maybe the one before Sierra, but I don't recall the 'code name' of that release. \nHas Apple locked this file down definitively?  \n\nA: \nHas Apple locked this file [/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist] down definitively?\n\nYes, they have, you need to disable SIP (System Integrity Protection), but note that editing ssh.plist is not the only option to change the SSH server port, there are other ways to achieve the same result.\nThere are (at least) 4 ways to change the port sshd listens on:\n\n\n*\n\n*Modifying /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pros: cleanest way to configure sshd, sshd started with System Preferences>Sharing>Remote Login listens on new port.\n\n*Cons: convoluted setup (requires two restarts and disabling/re-enabling SIP).\n\n*Use case: definitive change of sshd port.\n\n\n*Creating a new plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pros: dual operation of sshd listening on standard and new port.\n\n*Cons: CLI-only method to start sshd on the new port.\n\n*Use case: sshd must listen on both the standard port and the additional port.\n\n\n*Modifying \"ssh\" entries in /etc/services:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pros: simplest method, no need to deal with SIP, sshd started with System Preferences>Sharing>Remote Login listens on new port.\n\n*Cons: side effect: ssh defaults to new port when connecting to remote server (there's a workaround for that).\n\n*Use case: temporary port change or testing sshd running on a different port.\n\n\n*Redirecting port 22 to new port with packet filter:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pros: no need to deal with SIP, sshd started with System Preferences>Sharing>Remote Login seems to listen on new port.\n\n*Cons: somewhat non-transparent (sshd configuration is untouched but sshd listens on another/additional port) and confusing (firewall status in System Preferences not reliable), tiny side effect (remote client thinks it is connecting to port 22 (through env variables SSH_CLIENT and SSH_CONNECTION)).\n\n*Use case: definitive or temporary change of the sshd port, sshd must listen on both the standard port and the additional port.\nLet's take a closer look at them. (When choosing the new port, make sure it is not used by another service by running sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep <your port>.)\n\n1. Modifying /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist\nThis is the method you tried, let me describe it here for completion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your Mac and hold down ⌘R immediately after your Mac begins to restart to enter macOS Recovery.\n\n*Select Utilities>Terminal from the menu bar.\n\n*Type csrutil disable to disable SIP.\n\n*Select Apple menu>Restart.\n\n*Log in, edit /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist and modify the Listeners section. For example, to change the port to 2222:\n\n\n*Restart your Mac and hold down ⌘R immediately after your Mac begins to restart to enter macOS Recovery.\n\n*Select Utilities>Terminal from the menu bar.\n\n*Type csrutil enable to enable SIP and restart.\n\n\nSSH server will now listen on the new port and you can start sshd as usual through System Preferences>Sharing>Remote Login.\n\n2. Creating a new plist /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist\nThis method is nicely described in this answer, which basically says:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist to /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist to create a new sshd startup script.\n\n*Modify the label in /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist to differenciate the new startup script from the built-in one, for example by appending a number \"2\":\n<key>Label</key>\n<string>com.openssh.sshd2</string>\n\n\n*Modify the port in the Listeners section as in the previous method. For example, to change the port to 2222:\n<key>Sockets</key>\n<dict>\n   <key>Listeners</key>\n   <dict>\n      <key>SockServiceName</key>\n      <string>2222</string>\n      <key>Bonjour</key>\n      <array>\n          <string>ssh</string>\n          <string>sftp-ssh</string>\n      </array>\n   </dict>\n</dict>\n\n\n*Start sshd on the new port:\nsudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist \n(To stop it, run sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist)\nThe SSH server will now listen on the new port. You can still use System Preferences>Sharing>Remote Login to start another instance of the SSH server that listens on the standard port (22/tcp). launchd will listen on both ports:\n$ sudo lsof -i -P -n\nlaunchd     1           root   42u  IPv6 0x9df385961b132cdf      0t0    TCP *:2222 (LISTEN)\nlaunchd     1           root   44u  IPv4 0x9df385961c81db1f      0t0    TCP *:2222 (LISTEN)\nlaunchd     1           root   45u  IPv6 0x9df385961b132cdf      0t0    TCP *:2222 (LISTEN)\nlaunchd     1           root   47u  IPv4 0x9df385961c81db1f      0t0    TCP *:2222 (LISTEN)\nlaunchd     1           root   48u  IPv6 0x9df385961b133e1f      0t0    TCP *:22 (LISTEN)\nlaunchd     1           root   49u  IPv4 0x9df385961b22d51f      0t0    TCP *:22 (LISTEN)\nlaunchd     1           root   50u  IPv6 0x9df385961b133e1f      0t0    TCP *:22 (LISTEN)\nlaunchd     1           root   51u  IPv4 0x9df385961b22d51f      0t0    TCP *:22 (LISTEN)\n\n\n3. Modifying \"ssh\" entries in /etc/services\nTo change the sshd port with this method, proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/services, look for these entries:\nssh  22/udp  # SSH Remote Login Protocol\nssh  22/tcp  # SSH Remote Login Protocol\n\nand replace port 22 with a port of your choosing.\nYou can enable SSH with System Preferences>Sharing>Remote Login and sshd will listen on the new port.\nWhy does this work? If you take a look at the Listeners section of the /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist file, you will see that sshd is configured to listen on the port assigned to the service named ssh in /etc/services: \n<key>Sockets</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>Listeners</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>SockServiceName</key>\n        <string>ssh</string>\n(...)\n</dict>\n\nThis is undoubtedly the simplest method, but it has a drawback: the SSH client will expect remote SSH servers to listen on the new port (instead of port 22) (thanks to jcaron for the hint). That is, ssh reads /etc/services to find out which the default SSH port is. \nFortunately there is an easy solution for this: uncomment Port 22 in /etc/ssh/ssh_config (see man ssh_config for more information).\n\n4. Redirecting port 22 to new port with packet filter\nThe method uses the macOS packet filter (PF) to redirect all requests received at port 22 to the new sshd port (thanks to Andrew Morton for the idea):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new anchor file /etc/pf.anchors/sshd with contents (replace 2222 with a port of your choosing):\nrdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port = 2222 -> 127.0.0.1 port 22\n# If you want `sshd` to listen on port 22 too, comment out the line below\nblock drop in quick proto tcp from any to any port = 22\n\n\n*Add the \"sshd\" anchor rules by editing /etc/pf.conf (the order is relevant!):\nscrub-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\nnat-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\nrdr-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\n# Load sshd redirect rule\nrdr-anchor \"sshd\"\ndummynet-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\nanchor \"com.apple/*\"\n# Load other sshd rules\nanchor \"sshd\"\nload anchor \"com.apple\" from \"/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple\"\n# Tell PF where to find the sshd anchor\nload anchor \"sshd\" from \"/etc/pf.anchors/sshd\"\n\n\n*Enable and reload the packet filter:\nsudo pfctl -F all -ef /etc/pf.conf\n\n(To disable it, run sudo pfctl -d.)\nNote that:\n\n\n*\n\n*the macOS firewall (System Preferences>Security & Privacy>Firewall) is under the hood the packet filter, so that when you disable the packet filter on the command line, you are also disabling the firewall, even if the Preferences Panel doesn't reflect the change.\n\n*SSH clients will think they are connecting to port 22 through the SSH_CLIENT and SSH_CONNECTION env variables.\n\n\n\nEditing sshd_config doesn't work\nUsers running sshd on other operating systems may be tempted to edit the SSH daemon configuration file, /etc/ssh/sshd_config. In macOS, however, editing the Port directive in /etc/ssh/sshd_config won't achieve the desired result.\n", "Q: Can I keep movies on my iPad and not on my hard disk? I want to keep movies on my iPad but not on my hard disk - I don't need both. \nI normally keep the originals on an external USB drive, and put them on the iPad via iTunes.\nThat however seems to require that I keep a copy on the laptop hard drive - a waste of space.\nHow can I avoid this?\n\nA: For me, the solution for avoiding duplicate storage is to keep all media files (movies, music, pictures) on a \"networked storage\" device, and then pointing the software app to that location. \nTo use iTunes as an example: \niTunes, Preferences..., Advanced tab \nClick the Change... button next to the iTunes Media folder location \nUse the \"pop-up\" Finder dialog to navigate to the folder on your network drive where your media files are located. Eventually, you will click the OK button to dismiss the dialog, and set iTunes on its slow grind to hoover up the contents of the media folder you've just specified. However, before you do that, please read the notes below; esp. the second one. \nA couple of notes to conclude: \nNote 1: iTunes is a willful child in that it doesn't \"respect\" your choice of a designated media folder location. I find that after some time has passed, or I've returned from travel, or... after other apparently random, unspecified and unknown events have occurred, iTunes will revert to its \"default\" media folder location. I gave up trying to understand this behavior years ago, but it still does behave this way. The only solution I know of is to... change the media folder location again - ad nauseum.\nNote 2: There are several \"other options\" available in the Advanced dialog. In my experience, some of these options are unclear, and have proven counter-productive to my objectives. Rather than rant on this subject, I'll just provide the following screenshot that shows how I've chosen these options. Please also note that YMMV - these options may be perfectly clear to you, and work just as you wish; I'm only saying they don't for me. \n\n", "Q: Virus infected boot camp If the boot camp partition of my mac gets a virus, will the macOS part be safe? If the macOS part gets a virus, will the Windows part be affected?\n\nA: Most viruses (like 99.999% of them) are unable to transfer between operating systems for many different reasons, but theoretically a virus could spread between the two operating systems. What is more likely is that the virus would corrupt the partition table itself.\nTake a look at the following links for more info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quora: https://www.quora.com/Can-a-Windows-virus-infect-Mac-OS-X\n\n*MacRumors: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/can-windows-viruses-acquired-in-os-x-infect-the-boot-camp-partition.1075192/\nPlease note my percent is not based off of any legitimate statistics, it is exaggerated.\n\nA: Yes in general - Bootcamp doesn’t lock down the files on either side so you are at risk for data exfiltration / modification / deletion on both sides if either OS is compromised by a competently designed malicious program.  \nSome virus are simplistic or bug ridden so you might get lucky, but I would protect the Mac side with FileVault if you can’t realistically secure windows. Same on the Mac side - encrypt windows yo be safe. \nYou could also choose virtualization solution where you could lock things down better with some research and training. \n", "Q: Fixing bricked iPod Classic I tried to install Rockbox on my 6th generation iPod Classic using the Rockbox utility from this page.\nWhen I get to the step of rebooting the iPod, it just turned off, and now it doesn't turn on. I´ve tried to turn it on pressing Select + Menu, but nothing happens. I think it is bricked.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: I don't have really solid information, but I've just had a similar experience and resolved it. My gen 6 120 gb ipod has been running Rockbox for several years; I just hooked it up to my (Linux) computer to put some new music on the device. I umounted the drive ok, and when I unplugged the USB cable the iPod just went dead. Linux didn't recognize it, Win 7 didn't recognize it, iTunes didn't either, nothing lit up when I tried to turn it on. Tried every possible combination of button pushing and holding.\nFinally I decided to just plug in the USB to my running Linux box and go out for some dinner. An hour later Linux recognized the drive and mounted it, and just for insurance I used RockboxUtility to update the system before unmounting and rebooting successfully.\nbtw I'm quite sure the battery wasn't dead. Windows and iTunes will recognize a dead-battery iPod. I have no idea what this was. Wait, yes I do, the music I had loaded just before disconnecting the device and having it die was not playable on the newly revived iPod. Got a message like \"cannot load\" when I clicked on those songs. That MIGHT have caused the problem.\n", "Q: How to identify assembled top case after MBP repair? My MacBook Pro (2016) just needed another top case replacement, as keys did not work as expected. Since the last replacement, Apple has established a Keyboard Service Program for MacBook and MacBook Pro and introduced a (more or less) protective membrane in recent MBP keyboards. \nWhen I picked up my repaired notebook (not from Apple directly, but an Apple Premium Service Provider) I asked if the replaced keyboard has this membrane. The staffer couldn't tell, but said that this has recently been the case for “some replacements”. \nCan I somehow identify which keyboard/top case generation is installed? Is the membrane visible?\n\nA: The iconography on the 2018 keyboard does differ from that on the 2017 and 2016 keyboards. This can be used to identify the generation.\nThe YouTube video New 2018 MacBook Pro Keyboards MIGHT fix Keyboard Problems shows the differences between these three models' keyboards. The 2018 option key has a far taller icon than the 2017 option key.\n\nThe MacBook Pro 2016 and 2017 models will not receive the 3rd generation MacBook Pro 2018 keyboard according to the MacRumors article: Apple Says Third-Generation Keyboards Exclusive to 2018 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: The external keyboard design for the 2018 MacBook Pros is mostly unchanged from its predecessors (except for minor iconographic changes on Option key). There is no way you can visually distinguish between the two.\nUnder the keyboard replacement program, the eligible MacBooks will receive the same keyboard design as they already have, not the new version (with membrane).\nThe membrane which is present only in the 2018 MacBook Pros, is installed beneath the keys, and isn't externally visible.

When following the directions the \"Match\" tab, trying to \"Enable iCloud Music Library\" or any other reference to the path that I can sign up for the service is never presented.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: The first thing is to check that your iTunes is new enough for the subscription service. You didn’t mention how old your OS is so if you need help figure I get that out, Apple offers presales support via phone and web chat. \nI believe iTunes 10.5 is required, so try to update your Mac OS and then iTunes as far as you can to current. \nNext, if you’re sure your iTunes is ok, it’s likely a payment or date/time error.

I have a problem with my magsafe 2 adaptor, it has been stopping to work occasionally for a while now. Until now I always managed to get it to work by yanking the cable (in order to unstuck the pins), however now this method is not working anymore. After the usual yanking, I decided to clean both the connector and power plug on my macbook with a toothbrush and cotton. For some reason after that it stopped working completely. I am able to unstuck the pins by softly tapping on the connector with my fingernails but it still doesn't work. \nI have another non working magsafe 2, which has perfect pins and after cutting the cord now looks like this:\n\nHow dangerous would it be, to cut off the non working connector, expose the cables and connect them together by intertwining the stings?\nObviously I would isolate the two wires (copper and the other one) with tape and try to make a decent connection. I have done similar shenanigans with audio cables and it has always worked for a while.\nI will buy another one, but need an urgent solution right now. However, I don't want to break the computer or start a fire over it. \n\nA: This is the low voltage side of the transformer, so the risk is far less than working on the AC side. I haven’t heard of anything worse than scorch marks and safely melted plastic on the low voltage side when people shut these cables in a door or roll chairs over them, so I’d say you’re pretty safe if you make sure it works and doesn’t heat up and protect it electrically. The low voltage side has enough power and current to start a fire, that is certain so I’d say you are risking safety if you don’t do it well or there is hidden damage you don’t catch and fix.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why doesn't a stripped/cracked MagSafe power cable shock?\n\n*Will the \"cracked\" wire of a MacBook charger eletrocute me\n\n*Out of warranty MBP ,Burned Magsafe port and frayed charger cable - repair option and cost?\nSo, if you know this and try a repair, worst case is you pay for new part or someone skilled at electrical work to do a repair if you’re not comfortable with your safety and whatever house you leave this plugged into going forward once you have learned if you can do the repair. The chances of breaking your Mac is low with this since it’s designed to not charge from damaged cords anyhow.\nSince you probably should try this for science:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are the silver wires inside the MagSafe cable necessary?\n\n*What are specs of this MagSafe wire, and what is its purpose?\n\n*What voltage readings should i get from my 60 watt magsafe\n\n*Specification of MagSafe power adapter coaxial cable?\n\nA: It actually worked!\nFor reference, here is the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the plastic coating on the connector cable and the plastic coating on the inner cable:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Mesh the small hairlike wires of the inner cable together and then twist them:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Apply electrical isolation tape:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Mesh the hairlike wires of the outer cable together and twist them:\n\n\nMesh:\n\nTwist:\n\n\n\n*Isolate the outer cable, apply more tape as to leave no wire exposed, wires should be well separated obviously.\n\n\n\n\n\n*This step is optional: I applied a ton of tape to both wires and put them together, in order to have less moving around and less chance to break them, then I added a loop in order to prevent strain on the fragile construction:\n\n\n\nResult:\n\nWhile charging the connector is still getting very hot, just like with the previous charger, so there maybe some problem somewhere still.\nI have a solder somewhere and may redo this later.\nFor safety reasons I will not leave this charger to charge without me. Also I will probably buy a new charger and just keep this as a much needed backup.  \n\nA: Yes, go ahead and do this.\nI did this just the other day for my son's macbook air.\nI joined the centre or core wire and slid 2 layers of heat-shrink over it, then joined the outer \"braided\" wire (mine had 2 layers running in opposite directions) and covered that with 2 layers of heat-shrink.\nRemember to slide the heat-shrink on to the wire before you do the join...\nBased on a comment: You can shrink heat shrink with a good hair dryer or hot air gun but do be careful with hot air guns - lighters work but leave soot traces.\n", "Q: Create USB install stick from Mojave Since macOS Mojave moved the OS install to its system preferences and you can't download installers directly anymore, how would you go about creating an Mojave USB stick from Mojave onwards?\n\nA: Seems they added the installer recently to the new App Store on Mojave.

Nothing happens at all.\nThis might have to do with the fact that I installed Safari 12, then realized I couldn't downgrade, so I manually removed Safari 12 (after disabling SIP) via sudo rm -rf /Applications/Safari.app, then restored Safari 11 via Time Machine.\nIt works in every other way, except Preferences.\n\nA: I would be willing to bet that Safari 11 can't read the Safari 12 preferences file(s). No doubt part of the upgrade process is to make changes to these files to reflect the differences between the two versions.\nOf course Apple is not going to tell you about this because going back to an earlier version who would do that? (GASP!)\nYou are probably have to play the preferences dance, eg start removing preferences files associated with Safari until it starts working again on your Mac.\nOpen a Finder window, hold down Option and go to the \"Go\" Menu and select Library. In that folder find Preferences and then look for things that start with \"Com.Apple.Safari\" on my Mac it looks like this.\n\nIt could be a little different on your Mac any one (or all) of these files could be unreadable by your version of Safari.

I found answers that says i need disk, not the usb, but i belive there is a way to install windows from usb. Currently i'm running windows 7 on virtualbox and it's very slow because i have 2gb of ram.\n\nA: You will not be able to install Windows 7 on a 2008 Mac by using a USB flash drive containing files from the ISO. \nThe solution would be to burn the ISO file to a DVD, then install using the DVD. \nIf you do not have a working optical (DVD) drive, the you can use the solution given here.\n", "Q: Create symlinks in time machine backup? I have a time machine backup /Volumes/MyTimeMachine/Backups.backupdb/MyMachine. Exactly as Apple creates a Latest symlink pointing toward the latest snapshot, I would like to create symlinks toward other snapshots. But I get permission denied when I do, in terminal,\n% cd /Volumes/MyTimeMachine/Backups.backupdb/MyMachine\n% ln -s 2018-06-11-xxxx my_link\n\nwhere 2018-06-11-xxxx would be one of  the snapshot. I even get permission denied with sudo!! Is there something wrong with my Time Machine disk or is that normal on MacOS High Sierra?\n\nA: There are access control lists in addition to the typical permissions that lock you out of the time machine destination and prevent this. You might succeed in disabling that when Time Machine isn't looking, but when it starts up, it will likely notice you messed with the files it wrote and mark that destination as read only and never back up again to that destination.\nYou'd then need to retire it to a shelf or erase the drive and let Time Machine exert total control over a blank folder and start over with backups.\nThat being said, you can do this by maintaining your folder where you create the links outside the /Backups.backupdb folder (my best suggestion) or changing ACL and removing the restrictions Apple puts there.\nHere are a couple related articles on the chmod to mess with the ACL lists - you might need a general article as well if you've not listed / modified / added / removed ACL on macOS - that's quite an article in and of itself that I'll leave for another question to answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to remove my local Backupdb.backupsdb?\n\n*How do I change the ownership of files backed up with Time Machine\n\n*Time Machine and the dreaded negative sign (this is what happens when Time Machine detects a modification of permissions or content - the prohibitory sign and the \"you need to start over\" message)\n\n*Can't chmod or chown a file in TimeMachine backup directory\n\n*Moving Time Machine backup between two local disks results in full backup instead of incremental (pain experienced even trying to move the whole folder \"intact\")\n\n", "Q: Apple Samsung 512 GB SSUBX SSD: Half as fast in MacBook Pro 15\" 2015 than in MBPR 13\" 2014?

Now I'm ready to set it all up, but I'm not sure how to best proceed.\n\n\n*\n\n*I know the SSD will be on a relatively slow SATA III bus\n\n*I know the blade SSD is 24GB and on a faster bus\n\n*I know I could use external Thunderbolt for a faster experience (should have considered this but too late)\n\n*I've read mixed opinion on merging the two SSDs into a fusion drive, but most people suggest against it, since:\n\n\n*\n\n*the speed of both drives will be reduced to the slower of the two\n\n*if one drive fails I will lose everything\n\n\n\nI currently think I should keep them separate and use the 24GB SSD for the OS and use the other SSD for the home folder. Does this seem like a good way to proceed?\nI am not sure which file system to use (APFS?)\nI am not sure if I should be doing something with TRIM to extend the lifespan of the drives\nIf anyone can help guide me I would appreciate it. Thanks.\n\nA: I would recommend to go for the Fusion drive. I am using a Fusion drive with a SSD (128 GB) and a HDD (3 TB) in my iMac for six years now, not a single problem and definitely much faster that a plain HDD. With that experience, I recently bought a new iMac with a 1 TB SSD and added an internal 4 TB Samsung 860 EVO. I combined them to a single Fusion drive (APFS on Mojave) and speed tests show the speed of the NVMExpress bus, which is about four times faster than SATA (with these drives). So far there haven't been any problems.\n24 GB is not that much nowadays, and as a separate startup dive, for example, you will run out of space soon. But if you use it as a fast cache for the SDD on SATA, you have 24 GB more space and you can let the OS decide what to put on the faster drive. This will give you some speed advantage.\nI would opt for APFS as file system if you use Mojave (10.14) or higher.\nApple has a support document on how to combine two drives to a Fusion drive. According to that document, the simple Terminal command diskutil resetFusion (after booting in recovery mode, of course) should do the trick on Mojave. Unfortunately, this only works if one drive is a HDD. If you want to combine two SSDs, you have to use the following commands (which destroy all the data on your disks!), and it is important to state which drive shall be the main (faster) drive.\nBoot into recovery mode (cmd-R) and open Terminal. Look for the names of your drive partitions:\ndiskutil list\n\nLet's assume the biggest partition on your blade disk is disk0s2, the biggest partition on the SATA SSD is disk1s2:\ndiskutil apfs createContainer -main disk0s2 -secondary disk1s2\n\nFind out the name of the Fusion container:\ndiskutil apfs list\n\nLet's assume the name is disk3. So finally create a volume named 'MacSSD' (or whatever) in that container:\ndiskutil apfs addVolume disk3 APFS MacSSD\n\nAfterwards, you can install macOS again or restore your drive from the backup to the Fusion drive.\n\nA: Learnings:\n\n\n*\n\n*There doesn't seem to be any benefit to merging two SSDs, other than having one contiguous space.\n\n*The disadvantages of merging are that 1) both drives will have the slower of the two bus speeds, and 2) if one drive fails everything is lost\n\n*The small 24GB SSD that Apple includes in the 1TB Fusion Drive setup is too small to act as the startup drive. After installing Sierra, there was about 8GB remaining, and that quickly dropped down to around 5 once the update to High Sierra downloaded, leaving insufficient space to actually install High Sierra. Maybe I'll use that space for some applications.\n\n*It doesn't seem that the relatively slow 6GB/s speed of SATA III will have any noticeable impact\n\n", "Q: No password to log out of find my iphone, no i cloud setting options My friend lost his i phone 6, then found it a year later.

(Or let you know who purchased it originally). When I’ve done this it’s with my business card showing I am and IT Manager for the company matching the purchase order.

When you log in / plug in the keyboard it should show you the Keyboard Setup Assistant and ask you to press the key to the right of the left shift, i.e. the \\ key on a normal UK keyboard. Do as it asks, and it should detect your keyboard as ISO (not ANSI). Accept that, and then make sure in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources you are using the British - PC layout.\n\nThat should give you a normal keyboard layout, with one exception - the Ctrl key (the bottom left one) will be mapped to the Mac Control key, which you rarely use, and the Windows key will be mapped to Command. You probably want to swap those so that copy/paste shortcuts etc. are the same as on Windows.\nThe easiest way to do that is to install Karabiner-Elements and set it up like this:\n\nAlso note that this keyboard layout is not applied before you log in after a reboot, but it is applied before you log in after logging out. Very confusing if you have \" or @ in your password!\nEdit: I have found an easier way to re-run the keyboard detection wizard rather than restarting - change the Country Code in Karabiner-Elements as follows:\n\nYou just need to increment it.

Is that correct?  For a \"normal\" UK layout, you must have a European (ISO) keyboard which has this extra key.\nIf you do have an ISO keyboard with extra key, then you have a keyboard type problem.\n\nA: In the end, installing the Karabiner app fixed the issue.\n\nA: Make sure you have configured the Keyboard settings under Keyboard > Change Keyboard Type... first.\nOnce you have configured the Mac in ISO mode the right settings should be applied, you may need to remove and add the input device (British -PC) afterwards.\n\nA: The following Karabiner config works for me:\n\n\nA: I uninstalled Karibiner for some other reason and then remembered why I had installed it in the first place - for this issue.\nHowever I removed the preferences files as shown above and rebooted (which may have nothing to do with the solution) and then went into the keyboard setup assistant and on to identify my keyboard.\nWhen it asked me to press the key to the right of my left shift key I actually pressed the key to the left of the '1' key instead, and it it now generates the expected keys correctly. Haven't spotted any issues so far.\n\nA: This is what worked for me with my Cherry KC1000 on Catalina: While connecting the keyboard, when asked about the key next to the left shift, skip the backslash key and press \"Z\" as if it was a regular US keyboard. On the next screen select international US ASCII keyboard. Now the British-PC layout will work as expected, along with backslash and backtick keys.\n", "Q: Crontab didn't work as intended I set crontab but nothing happened,\ncrontab -l\n03 04-22 * * * python /me/radio_alarm.py\n\nWhat's the reason, the command works as intended in Linux.\n\nA: Your crontab suggests that at 3 minutes past every hour from 04:00 through 22:00, invoke python to run /me/radio_alarm.py \nIf that's correct, and there are no other problems that we can't see*, the following correction should work: \n03 04-22 * * * /usr/bin/python /me/radio_alarm.py \nIt is necessary to specify the complete path to python because the \"cron user\" does not have the same $PATH environment that you do under your user name. \n* I assume that you have successfully run your script from the command line. If that is the case, you've probably cleared most of the potential errors below, but just in case here are the \"usual suspects\": \n\n\n*\n\n*is your script marked as executable? (e.g. chmod 755 /me/radio_alarm.py) \n\n*does your script begin with an appropriate shebang entry?

(e.g. mac os has only Python2, unless you've installed Python3 as part of homebrew, etc.) \n\n\nFinally, it never hurts to capture any stderr output while you're testing a new script. You can easily add an \"error log\" to your script as follows: \n03 04-22 * * * /usr/bin/python /me/radio_alarm.py  > ~/cronjoblog 2>&1  \n\nThis will redirect any error output from your script to the file cronjoblog in your user's home directory. \nHope that helps.

I sent an email to the refind programmer for instructions on how to bypass SIP.\n\n\nA: SIP can be turned off on your Mac. SIP has nothing to do with encryption. You have to boot the Mac in Recovery mode in order to enter the csrutil disable command. Recovery mode can be booted from the internal recovery partition, from the internet or from a USB flash drive. You can also use third party tools, such as rEFInd, to disable SIP.\nrEFIt is the predecessor to rEFInd boot manager. rEFIt is now obsolete with respect to the current macOS operating systems. rEFInd should only be installed to either a EFI, FAT or jhfs+ partition. rEFInd should not be installed in the macOS partition.\nThe most likely reason the Windows 10 recovery solution did not work would be the partitioning of the internal drive. Normally, your Mac should be using GPT partitioning with a full protected MBR. If the partitioning was changed from full protect to hybrid, then the mountvol S: /s command would return the error message The parameter is incorrect. Here, I made the assumption you installed Windows 10 using the Boot Camp Assistant. If you first installed Widows 7/8/8.1 then upgraded to Windows 10, then this answer may need to be altered.\nThe easiest way to check and update the partitioning is to use the gdisk command. You will need to download and install gdisk. Also to use gdisk from macOS, you will need to disable SIP. You can also use gdisk while booted in Recovery mode.\nIf you are out of free space in the Windows partition and you can access your files from macOS, then you might what to consider first backing up your files, deleting windows, and then reinstalling Windows into a larger partition. I say this because there is no practical way to increase the size of the Windows partition without using some third party tool. Before attempting this, you would want to backup your files anyway. So, you might as well remove Windows, increase the partition size and reinstall.\n", "Q: how to disable iCloud for Earthlink mail When I received a RED warning from Earthlink that my server mailbox\nwas full and that incoming mail would therefore be rejected, I went to my server's mailbox and deleted all the mail which I had already downloaded to my Macbook.

I have used brew to install software, is there a similar command line mechanism to download the OS's security updates?\n\nA: softwareupdate can perform updates to macOS.\nList updates with softwareupdate -l and install recommended updates with\nsudo softwareupdate -ir\n\nwhere -i installs specified updates and -r selects all recommended updates.\n", "Q: Burned magsafe dc in board ports: Replace, even if working? I have noticed that two of the pin plugs on my magsafe dc in board, the ones, which are for power are blacked.

Can the in board damage the magsafe or something else because of the condition it is in?

I have a MacBook Air.\nI have a new battery. It has only 21 cycles in it. Out of nowhere it stopped charging. I checked my battery status and it showed as NOT CHARGING. (More specifically \"Charging: NO\"). \nSo basically I have to use it plugged in. I've tried the SMC restart and many other options I've found here and other places online.\nDoes anyone have a solution or an idea on what I could do? Thanks!\nOh, I've tried with 2 different chargers as well.\nUPDATE: I just finished talking with MAC assistance and they also made me press another combination of keyboards: POWER + SHIFT + COMMAND + P + I + R (or something like that) and the system rebooted. But that didn't help either.\n\n\nA: Apple is pretty clear that if one SMC reset doesn’t fix your power issue, the next step would be a hardware repair. \nNow before you do that, consider the machine stops charging the battery past 90% or so and you are above 97% charge. No panic and just let the battery drain down a bit and make sure it’s just not resting the charge. \n\n\n*\n\n*(6885 - 6696) / 6885 = 0.027 which means you're not discharged enough to resume adding charge to the battery according to the system information. Your battery health is good.\n\n\n\nAssuming it doesn’t start charging when you’re at 85 % capacity, then seek a repair. For now, make sure your backup is running just in case, but nothing is amiss in regular readings whatsoever. \n\nThat repair would be to take a new adapter to your Mac to be sure it’s not the adapter or a stuck pin, then they would inspect and replace the MagSafe port or the battery or cables or the Logic board (or even a combination of some or all of the above). \nYou did good work making sure it’s not something simple so unless you missed a stuck pin in your adapter or physical debris in the MagSafe port, time for a repair. \n\n\n*\n\n*Battery is not charging despite SMC reset\n\n*Battery not charging? (Even after SMC reset)\nThere are probably dozens of other similar or duplicate questions here if you search on the right or use the main search. \n\nA: Upon closer evaluation of your Battery report,\nit shows Amperage to be positive (like charging). Amperage +81mA\nNormally when run on battery without charger, the Amperage is some negative number like -400 mA, meaning (showing) the amount of current that is been consumed.\nSomething does not add up here. I shows it is charging but does not report it correctly. \nAs comparison here is what I have and no charger plugged in.\nAs yo can see it shows negative (-626 mA) which is correct value.\n\nThis is your battery report. Is the battery Apple original ?\n\nIn summary and further advice...\nYour charger is working and it is charging the battery. \nHowever the circuit mounted on the battery is not working.\nTo verify, make note of the \"Charge remaining\" while plugged in and check again in a hour to see if it is going up or down.\n", "Q: Camera shows ghost lighting or refrective image Once I have updated to iOS 12 beta 10 , my camera shows strange reflective images. Suppose if I am taking photo of my television in low light, it shows blurry image of my tv just below an original photo, doesn’t seems like glare but much more than this, also Pictures of CFL and tube light shows refractive image. Is it software issue? Also it seems happening after 1 month of purchase. Lens is clean , no physical damage too. Is there anyway to fix it?\n\nA: This lens flare is due to the geometry of the camera and the physical aperture / focus ring and might be normal or might be signs that the internals have shifted or become damaged. A hard drop can knock the camera out of alignment and cause this. Also, there are lighting conditions that guarantee a properly assembled and working iPhone camera makes that flare. \n\n\n*\n\n*Take controlled photos with other devices if you wish to rule out that it's just the natural result of that light bouncing off the camera. Get a lens hood or change the exposure is how photographers manage this (this problem is just one of optics and sensors) if it turns out your device is working like others.\n\n*Take the phone (camera) in for service if you believe it's not working as designed and you can't see any signs of physical damage or a drop. If the phone isn't up to spec - Apple or their service team will offer a repair under warranty assuming you're covered. The only thing I would expect to pay is if I damaged it (warranty doesn't cover drops or breaks).\n\n\nA: do you mean this ?\nit looks like reflection.\n\n", "Q: iMessage sent to me by spouse shows receivers name (mine). When I send her an iMessage there’s no problem, but on my receiving end from her, my name appears as if I sent message to myself. How may I stop this recent twist?\n\nA: There are several possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*As @jksoegaard has indicated, you and your spouse are sharing an AppleID  \n\n*You and your spouse are sharing an iPad or Mac  \n\n*You or your spouse have gotten a contact mis-labeled  \n\n*You and your spouse are doing research for a new comedy show  \n\n\nIf none of those address your issue, you could Google iMessage from spouse says it's from me, and start reading through the responses. In any case, the number of hits from this search should give you some comfort as you'll learn you're not alone. \n\nA: Your phone’s address book dictates the name that matches a number. Check your card and your iCloud - each and every field in either could cause this mapping to take place. \nYou might also disable all address book sync sources. Apple iOS can pull data from all sorts of third party sources so you might be injecting bad data from linked in, Facebook, google accounts, etc...\n", "Q: Replace string with new line + string in a big file I need to replace the string ),( with )\\n,( in a 10GB file. The \\n in this case obviously stands for a newline.\nI've tried so with this command:\nsed -i '' '/),(/ s//),\\n(/g' bigfile.sql\n\nHowever, that didn't really work as expected. It did replace the string, but it didn't insert a newline, but simply a \"n\" (so it just neglected the backslash and escaped it).\nAny other takes on this, or where's my mistake in the above command?\n\nA: Try\nsed -i '' $'/),(/ s//),\\\\\\n(/g' bigfile.sql\n\n\n\n*\n\n*$'...' indicates that the string is a C-style string. This allows you to use the \\\\ and \\n escapes, among others.\n\n*In place of your \\n, we have a \\\\ and then a \\n. This passes a literal backslash, and then a literal newline, to sed.

Will the display have full functionality, e.g. wake up by mouse/keyboard, even when the Macbook is closed?\n\nA: Yes, your Air will work with any Cinema Display, although if its one of the plastic case  models, you will need both an ADC to DVI & DVI to Mini Display Port adapter to connect it.\nIf the display is a newer one with the aluminum case, you'll need only the DVI to Mini Display Port adapter to connect to your Air. \n", "Q: Massive .dmg file in /Users/username/firmware/ folder: any ideas what the heck it is?

It seems odd that Photos is there in the iCloud Storage config, but then Photo Library is there under Backups config (highlighted in the green boxes)?\nIt seems like that should be one or the other? Am I double-storing my photos?\nAs a footnote, if I flip the iCloud Photo Library to on I get an error that I don't have enough space (which is what prompted the research).\n\n\nA: Because you're not using iCloud Photo Library, iOS will treat your Camera Roll photos and any saved photos as part of the standard backup process. \nYou are storing all of those backed-up photos in a separate backup in your iCloud Storage (the dark blue part of your storage bar). This means that you are correct in suggesting you are \"double-storing\" your photos.\nIf you were to delete your backup from iCloud (I recommend backing up the photos on your physical device to external storage before you do this) and then turn on iCloud Photo Library, your photos would be uploaded to iCloud and then would not need to be backed up by the device. \nHere is my current storage as an example: \n\nYou can see that my photos and videos are taking the majority of my storage while my backups are only a small part.\nIn short: Delete your backup from iCloud (after backing up photos), turn on iCloud Photo Library, then after the photos have been uploaded, backup your device again.\n", "Q: Installing ffmpeg on mac os 10.9 I had ffmpeg 3.3.4 working very well on my system, then I force uninstalled all versions of ffmpeg including the version above while meddling with a dependency for another application. \nNow, I cannot brew install ffmpeg because it  is a 4.0.2 version which gives an error about using macOS 10.9\nHow can I get back ffmpeg on Mavericks?\nThis is what I am trying right now:\ncurl https://www.ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-3.4.4.tar.xz | tar xz\ncd ffmpeg-3.4.4\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/3.4.4 --enable-shared --enable-pthreads --enable\nmake\nsudo make install\nbrew link ffmpeg\n\nThe problem is configure command is not working, what should be the correct configure command.

It’s not a “little” screen anymore, and it’s very good at making light that your non-visual photoreceptors will see.\nMeasuring the brightest iPhone ever: iPhone X\n\nThe right tool for this kind of job is f.lux.\n\nEver notice how people texting at night have that eerie blue glow?\nOr wake up ready to write down the Next Great Idea, and get blinded by your computer screen?\nDuring the day, computer screens look good—they're designed to look like the sun. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn't be looking at the sun.\nf.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.\nIt's even possible that you're staying up too late because of your computer. You could use f.lux because it makes you sleep better, or you could just use it just because it makes your computer look better.\nf.lux makes your computer screen look like the room you're in, all the time. When the sun sets, it makes your computer look like your indoor lights. In the morning, it makes things look like sunlight again.\nTell f.lux what kind of lighting you have, and where you live. Then forget about it. f.lux will do the rest, automatically.\n\nAt least there used to be other tools available (Nocturne, DarkAdapted, RedScreen or similar…) and you might also play just with display colour profiles to achieve a similar effect. That is basically  just a nuisance and requires manual intervention all the time. But the above tool called f.lux just does it all with less hassle, customisable and automatically. You might also change the preferences to suite your needs in terms of colour better. It just works. \n", "Q: How do I remove Keybase from my Finder Favorites?

I need to logout of my Apple ID on my iPhone.  I have Two-Factor Authentication (TFA) enabled, and according to Apple Support TFA can no-longer be disabled.\n\nCan I turn off two-factor authentication after I’ve turned it on?\nIf you already use two-factor authentication, you can no longer turn\n  it off. Certain features in the latest versions of iOS and macOS\n  require this extra level of security, which is designed to protect\n  your information. If you recently updated your account, however, you\n  can unenroll for a period of two weeks. Just open your enrollment\n  confirmation email and click the link to return to your previous\n  security settings. Keep in mind, this makes your account less secure\n  and means that you can't use features that require a higher level of\n  security.\n\nSo if I logout on my iPhone, and want to log back in, how can I receive the TFA code to authorise the login?\n\nA: You have multiple options:\nYou could in advance set a trusted phone numbers for your Apple ID. Then when you want to log back into the Apple ID, you can click \"Didn't get a code\" to have the code sent to your trusted phone number via text message or automated voice call.\nAnother possibility is to sign in to the Apple ID with a browser.

I have gone to an electronics store and have tried on Bose and Beats headphones, both of them have a pretty annoying sound delay which is insanely apparent and anyone who says it’s imperceptible must be deaf. \nWhile listening to music it doesn’t matter and for videos it wouldn’t be that bad, for phone calls especially slower or international VOIP which already have the delay, it is absolutely horrible. \nI noticed that the more expensive the receiver - the lesser is the sound delay, I also noticed that it is some sort of low power garbage which causes that delay to happen. \nExample: streaming Bluetooth music to my PC one time is super snappy almost perfectly in sync without any perceived delay, some other time there’s like a half a second delay (distance would be irrelevant) although I am tempted to try to force high power by moving too far from the receiver, and then seeing if that has forced high power low latency\nExample 2: I have these cheap $25 bluetooth earphones for running, they have a really bad half a second delay.\nConsidering radio waves travel with the speed of light, I am very tempted to deposit a log of blame on the “low power” protocols and inability to force high power low latency protocols for this issue. \nLow power protocol is fine for synchronizing irrelevant garbage to/from your watch, music, file transfers, I strongly disagree how it is being used for media and calls.\nThat said, I wonder how is the delay on AirPods in comparison to latest (2k17/18) Bose. Bose delay isn’t that bad, but still would add an annoying delay for phone calls. \n\nA: Yes, there is a noticeable delay (latency) with the AirPods. This is so with any wireless headset - but the amount varies according to the chosen codec, quality (frequency range, samples per second, etc), and protocol.\nBasically any wireless headset has to balance bandwidth, latency, power usage, etc.\nIf you use AirPods for streaming music, playing videos, etc. the delay is not a problem. The AirPods will use higher quality settings for the best audio possible.\nIf you use AirPods for phone calls, Siri, or similar - the quality settings are automatically lowered to better balance these factors for that use case. In some cases you're perfectly okay with 8 kHz mono sound.\nIf you intend to use AirPods for listening to virtual instruments in GarageBand triggered by a MIDI keyboard - you're not going to enjoy it. These instruments require a high quality setting for the audio to sound their best - but you'll then have a very noticeable delay (latency) between hitting the keyboards on the keyboard and hearing the sound from the AirPods. \nFor those types of scenarios, wired headphones are still the best.\n", "Q: schedule to wake up and power-on I set the computer to wake up at 4:45 AM,\nI have a script scheduled to run at 4:50 AM to play wake up music.\n\nHowever, this morning, it didn't work as I intended.\nIt seems that the machine wake it up at 4:45 AM, but get himself asleep again after the power-on password is requried.\nHow could I ensure the machine to wake up and input password to power-on itself.\nI need the password when I leave home and stay at office. \n\nA: I would make a second user that just has the music for your playlist and is not an administrator.  You can then save that password so when you power on, that user auto logs in.\nUnless you can relinquish the password requirement, this is going to be harder than you want. You need to be sure you power off or always have this second user active when it sleep.\nYou will have a lot better luck with iOS for this sort of alarm situation and even a several year old iPod / iPad / iPhone would do very well for this if you don’t want to compromise on macOS as an alarm clock / timed music player.\n", "Q: Is that possible to make `cp -R /dir/ .` be the same as `cp -R /dir .`? I come from Linux. I keep making mistakes when I do cp -R /dir/ . instead of cp -R /dir .. These two commands are identical in Linux world, but different in MacOS. In cp manpage:\n\nIf the source_file ends in a /, \nthe contents of the directory are copied rather than the directory itself. \n\nSince I always use Tab autocomplete the directory name and it always has / in the end, I really mean copying the directory, not the contents of the directory. I don't always remember to delete the / suffix. How do MacOS developers avoid these kind of mistakes? Thanks. \n\nA: If you use homebrew, you can install the coreutils package, which provides GNU cp (gcp), which behaves the way you are familiar with.

I'd like to connect it to macbook pro 2014, which doesn't have an USB-C type of port.\nI found some adapters that can convert between ports, but I am sceptic whether signal can be upgraded from older usb-3 port to usb-c? Is there any data loss? \nBackground:\nAs you might know, issues with external displays and Apple devices are quite common. For this particular model, Apple has an official site in where it explains that this particular monitor is not compatible with devices that are older than 2015.\nI am curious, if this is just because port incompatibly and whether this can be solved by using adapters.\n\nA: No, you cannot connect the monitor to an USB A port (i.e. for example the non-USB-C USB 3 port you mention).\nThe monitor uses the so called \"Alternate Mode\" part of the USB-C connector. Essentially it means that the USB-C cable in addition to USB carries a seperate signal - for example DisplayPort as in this case.\nOlder USB connectors and cables do not have support for \"Alternate Mode\" and thus no adapters can be made.\n", "Q: iOS App Store keeps asking for password for free items Has the option to just download free apps from the App Store without password been removed?\nI tried signing in through the Settings app, the App Store no longer lets me use Touch ID for free items.\nHow do I make iOS App Store either not ask for password or allow Touch ID I already have the option set in Settings app.\nI am running iOS 11.2.\n\n\nA: No. It’s not removed, but it can get stuck. I would disable this feature and then reboot if you think it’s already enabled. Also, free apps are basically the same as paid - you go through all the same hoops to “buy” save an optional second confirmation for payments. \nTo allow downloading from the App Store without having to enter your password every time for free apps follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Scroll down and click Itunes and App Stores\n\n*Click Password Settings \n\n*Toggle off \"Require Password\" under Free Downloads. \n\n\nYou will now be able download apps without having to enter your password. \nUPDATE \nI since found the issue was localized to a bad home WiFi/router which blocked access to Apple servers. This can be verified by:\n\n\n*\n\n*signing out of App Store in settings\n\n*trying to sign back in\n\n*getting an error message\n\n*disconnecting from WiFi, using cellular\n\n*signing back in\n\n*getting the “verify payment alert”\n\n*entering credit card Security code or selecting “none” payment type\n\n*this enables Touch ID for purchases \n\n", "Q: Harmony Remote and Apple TV - \"start position\" I have my Harmony Remote set up to control my Apple TV (4th Gen, not 4K) and it works fine for the basics.\nI'd like to setup an Activity on the remote to launch Netflix. However the way to do this seems to be through a combination of \"right, down, right, OK, down, down, OK\" which ends up looking like a solution to a Zork Zero problem.\nI'm fine with this apart from the start position.\nIs there any way to force the Apple TV to return to, say, the Top Left tile, no matter where it is (i.e. in an Open App in a folder, or in the Movies App, etc.)?\n\nA: My ATV4 has a \"Menu\" button (upper left button, below touchpad).  Touching it from anywhere on the homepage takes me to the home screen, and selects the upper-left icon (Settings, for me).\nBut, if you're inside a \"folder\" on the home screen, or inside an app, it usually takes 2 clicks to get back to that top-left tile.\nBefore you say, \"just program 2 clicks every time\", when you do that from the home screen itself (not in a folder or app), that launches the screensaver.  You'd need to press Menu again to get out of the screensaver, but 3 clicks would send the other scenarios into the screensaver...\nThere is no sure-fire way to get to the top-left tile, and then to your Netflix app.  Unless you're willing to use the reboot function, which is available in the Harmony setup for ATV, but that kind of defeats the purpose of getting to Netflix quickly...\n\nA: Realize this is an older thread but I got this working by programming:\n\n\n*\n\n*Home -> Delay 2s -> Home\n\n\n(Home is available if you setup your AppleTV to be controlled by Bluetooth instead of IR)\nIf it's in an app the First home take you out, second resets you to upper left\nIf it's on the home screen the First home takes you to the upper left, second home does nothing\nThe 2s pause works for me by being just long enough to guarantee it's exited the app and also providing enough space to prevent it from being a \"double click\"\nI also have a 1s delay before doing the left/right/up/down to get to the app of choice, and then another 1s delay before \"select\", because it wasn't always getting all the way where I wanted.  Those can maybe get cut down I just haven't fiddled much with them.  Either way the 3 commands above seem to work well for getting you to the upper corner.\n", "Q: App not available on the App Store I have previously installed an app on my iPhone. I deleted it by mistake, and now I can no longer reinstall it as it is not available in the UK App Store.\nWhat should I do to install it again?\n\nA: The developer has most likely removed the app from sale from UK/all the App Stores.\nYou can check with the developer about the availability status by finding their contact information on the app's website. If you do not know the website address, try doing a Google search and see if you can locate it.\nIf the app is still available on App Store other than UK, you can install it by creating a different Apple ID and set the country as the one where the app is available. (This should be pretty easy to do if the app is free, as you won't have to setup payment).\nUpdate: As mentioned in your response, if you are unable to locate the website via Google search, the most likely explanation is that the app is now defunct.\n", "Q: Copy and paste entire song in GarageBand for iPad In GarageBand for iPad, how do I get my song to repeat, so that the song is played twice its duration?\nThe song has ten tracks and 25 sections. I just want to select all and copy-paste the whole song at the end of the song so it’s twice as long and repeated once.\n\nA: Maybe your project is too big? I have heard that GarageBand, even on a Mac, has limitations when the project gets too big. It would refuse an operation or just hang or crash without much feedback. Try with a much smaller/simpler test song and see if you can accomplish what you want. Or try posting exactly the steps you do to copy and paste, and exactly what happens (what GarageBand does) after.\n", "Q: Watch folder that only processes one item at a time? I need to set up a watch folder that runs a script on each item added.\nBut the script could take 10 mins or more to process a single item.\nWhat I've done is put this code at the top of my script that keeps watching the folder and then acts when something is added:\nset watchFolderAlias to (POSIX file watchFolder as alias)\nset r to {}\nrepeat\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set r to ¬\n        (sort (get files of watchFolderAlias whose kind is \"alias\") ¬\n            by creation date)\n    if (count of r) ≠ 0 then\n        do(first item of r as alias)\n    end if\n    delay 5\nend repeat\n\non do(x)\n   (* do 10 minutes of stuff with x *)\nend do\n\n... and then I just keep it running. But this is cumbersome and awkward.\nBut if I attach the do() stuff as a folder action then it will launch a new instance as soon as an item is added ... right?\nAm I missing a more elegant solution?\n(To clarify: If you attach a folder action script to a folder, that script is launched multiple times, once for each time you add items to the folder, regardless of whether another instance of said script is already running. This is what I'm trying to avoid. For example, if 10 items are dropped into the watch folder, and then, while the first 10 items are still being processed, another 5 items are dropped, this will launch a second instance of the script.)\nThe only other thing I can come up with is to maintain a \"status\" file which will be set to \"busy\" by the script, and \"idle\" when done processing, so that the other instances of the script will wait for the \"idle\" state ... but this is also awkward.\n\nA: Try Hazel from https://www.noodlesoft.com\nI haven’t had any processes that run that long, but in my experience Hazel always seems to operate sequentially on files, and won’t start a new process until the old one is done. \nIt’s an invaluable Mac app, IMO. I use it exclusively instead of\nFolder Actions. It’s a paid app, but there is a free, full-featured demo available. The developer is also very helpful and the app is well-maintained. Highly recommended. \nI think your only other alternative is a lock file, which is awkward, as you mentioned.\n", "Q: No Reboot on MacPro using a new Samsung 860 EVO SSD From the standard hard disk I can start, restart, and shutdown with no issues.\nFrom the new Samsung EVO 860 I can start and shutdown, but I can NOT restart.

I've checked the phone, and hide alerts is not activated, and do not disturb is not turned on. There are no moon icon's anywhere to disable. When I text her, the little dot next to the message in her message list isn't there to signify a new text. We've tried switching on the DND and then turning it off, switching on hide alerts for that conversation only and then turning it off. Powered the phone off and on, deleted and re-added my contact to her contacts - nothing works. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Did you add yourself as a new contact then choose what ringtone you want and text tone? Alert tones is on, and vibration?\n\nA: Im sure you checked to make sure you are not blocked by going to Phone app, Recents, finding your number then scrolling down to see Block or unBlock this number. I do not know very much about Wi-Fi Calling, but check to see it that is on. Then check Messages to see if iMessages is on, because it could be set to use your Apple ID that you can be reached at.

I do not mind paying as I know this is not something offered for free, but the ones I have tried so far (Delayed and Scheduled) have not been working at all. \nI am looking for something that does more then just send a reminder to send the message. \n\nA: While there is no native option to have the message sent at a scheduled time, I have been using an app Called Auto Sender for the past month or so, and have been finding it works very well. \nHow it works is by storing the message on their server, and then sending the message from a generated number at the scheduled time. While it is not possible to have the message automatically sent from your number due to restrictions placed by apple, this method works well if you don't mind it coming from a different number. It also automatically includes your number at the end of the message, so the recipient knows who sent it. It also offers a signature that will appear at the end of the message, which allows you to enter your name in if you would like.\nFor the past month or so all my messages have been sent exactly on time! While there is a cost associated with each message due to them storing it on their servers, I find it cheaper then any other iOS alternative. \n", "Q: Making Safari’s View Controller always go back in history when swiping back I spend more time in Safari View Controller (SVC, the in-app browser of apps) than Safari itself, mostly through Reeder.\nOften I navigate away from the original page, starting to build a history. To go back in said history, I need to click the < in the bottom left. However, muscle memory often compels me to swipe back instead, which takes me out of SVC and to the app again, making me lose all my navigated history.\nYet sometimes it does take me back in history. I figure it must be something in the way I swipe, but so far I haven’t been able to figure out how to reliably swipe to go back in history.\nIdeally for me, swipe back would always go back in history, returning to the app only when you were at the firs page; or via pressing Done.\nIs there really a difference in swipes? Or better yet, a setting to change to accomplish what I want?\n\nA: Whether performing a horizontal left to right edge swipe would navigate to the previous webpage in the in-app browser's navigation history or the previous view controller in the app is something which could be customized by the developer of the app.\nSo it's likely that you will find one or the other mode implemented among different apps. There's no set standard. Although it's possible for the app developer to provide an in-app setting to switch between the two.\nYou are right that this has the potential of muscle memory failing on the user by increasing the likelihood of performing the unintended gesture in an app.\nTurns out, the way Reeder app is implemented, performing an edge swipe always navigates back to the previous view controller (i.e. out of the browser). As per the current implementation, the behaviour isn't configurable. If you wish to navigate back in browsing history, be careful with the gesture.\nYou may try contacting the developer and share your feedback regarding the same.\n", "Q: Is there something like macros in Outlook 2016 on Mac? In Outlook on Windows I have a VBA script that moves one or more messages from Inbox to a folder, attached to a keyboard shortcut that I use to very quickly move hundreds of emails to where I want them every day.   \nIs there any feature like that in Outlook on Mac? I'm not sure how to phrase the question, I don't want to be too narrow by asking \"Is there VBA and Macros in Outlook on Mac\" when obviously there is not, but is there some other way to approach this problem, automating things and assigning keyboard shortcuts to personalized tasks?\nEdit: One comment mentioned Applescript.  (I'm a newbie to Mac).  I then found this article on enabling the Applescript icon and this article on using Applescript to create a Task from a Message.  That's not exactly what I want but it's a HUGE step forward.   I will now study Applescript and Outlook's use of it and if I get anywhere, will answer my own question.\n\nA: Here is a way in Outlook 2016 on Mac to do the equivalent of Windows \"Write a VB script and assign it to a key\".  Thanks to those who pointed me in the right direction.  On Mac this is done with Applescript, Automator, and Keyboard Shortcuts.  I'm including the Applescript here that moves selected Outlook emails to an archive folder.   Also shown below for reference is the original VBA I was trying to emulate on Mac.\nStep 1 – Write Applescript to move selected Outlook item to Archive\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Command-Tab to launch Spotlight Search, type “Script Editor” to\nlaunch it.\n\n*Optional: Install a shortcut to the script editor in the\nApple menu as follows.  You have to be in the script editor first,\nthen in the menu at the top choose Script Editor->Preferences.  Then\nin preferences choose General, and check (enable) “Show Script menu\nin menu bar” and also “Show Computer scripts”.\n\n*Start with the following script.  Run it, test it, play with it.  Look elsewhere for help on changing this to do exactly what you want.  This script moves the currently selected email(s) to a folder named “IZ – Archive”. Change the folder name to suit yourself.  There’s lots of room for improvement here.  I’d like to solve the Reminders problem.\ntell application \"Microsoft Outlook\"\n    -- get the currently selected message or messages\n    -- NOTE in this version it fails if the Outlook Reminder window is open, even if you select a message in the main window.\n    set selectedMessages to current messages\n\n    -- if there are no messages selected, warn the user and then quit\n    if selectedMessages is {} then\n        display dialog \"Please select a message first and then run this script.\" with icon 1\n        return\n    end if\n\n    set aMessage to item 1 of selectedMessages\n    set emailAcct to account of aMessage\n    set inBoxFolder to folder \"Inbox\" of emailAcct\n    set ArchiveFolder to folder \"IZ - Archive\" of inbox\n\n    repeat with theMessage in selectedMessages\n        move theMessage to IZArchiveFolder\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nStep 2 – Assign the Applescript to a Service using Automator\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Command-Tab to launch Spotlight Search, from there launch\nAutomator  \n\n*In Automator, choose a type for your document, choose\n“Service”.  You will create a service from your script. \n\n*At the top of the service, set the two settings to: Service receives no input in any application From the left panel, choose Library, then in the second panel from the long list find “Run Applescript”, and drag that into the main service window. \n\n*Copy and paste your Applescript replacing (* Your script goes here *)\n\n*Save the service, giving it a name like MoveSelectedOutlookMailToArchive.   It’s not obvious how to “Save As” in Automator.  Play around with the “File” menu at the top of the screen and do some googling.  \n\n*The service will be saved under ~/Library/Services/yourservicename\nStep 3 – Assign the Service to a Key\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Keyboard Shortcuts either from Outlook Menu->Outlook->Services->Services Preferences or from System Preferences->Keyboard->Shortcuts->Services\n\n*In the Keyboard Shortcuts editor choose “Services” on the left, then go to the bottom under the “General” section where you will find your new service.\n\n*Click on that, and assign the keyboard shortcut you would like.\n\n\n============\nFor reference and comparison here is the original VBA script I was trying to emulate on Mac.  As you can see, the Applescript is more concise and intuitive, on the other hand the mechanism to assign it to a key (not shown here) is WAY easier on PC.\n'Outlook VB Macro to move selected mail item(s) to a target folder\nSub MoveToIZArchive()\nOn Error Resume Next\n\nDim ns As Outlook.NameSpace\nDim moveToFolder As Outlook.MAPIFolder\nDim objItem As Outlook.MailItem\n\nSet ns = Application.GetNamespace(\"MAPI\")\n\n'Define path to the target folder\nSet moveToFolder = ns.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox).Folders(\"IZ - Archive\")\n\nIf Application.ActiveExplorer.Selection.Count = 0 Then\n   MsgBox (\"No item selected\")\n   Exit Sub\nEnd If\n\nIf moveToFolder Is Nothing Then\n   MsgBox \"Target folder not found!\", vbOKOnly + vbExclamation, \"Move Macro Error\"\nEnd If\n\nFor Each objItem In Application.ActiveExplorer.Selection\n   If moveToFolder.DefaultItemType = olMailItem Then\n      If objItem.Class = olMail Then\n         'objItem.UnRead = False\n         objItem.Move moveToFolder\n      End If\n  End If\nNext\n\nSet objItem = Nothing\nSet moveToFolder = Nothing\nSet ns = Nothing\n\nEnd Sub\n\n", "Q: Open Terminal Window with Predefined Environment Variables (Including `PATH`) I'm trying to create a .command file which will open a terminal window with predefined Environment Variables (Including PATH).\nI tried this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Adding CMake to Path\nexport PATH=$PATH:/Users/Shared/CMake/CMake.app/Contents/bin/:\n\n# Adding Ninja to Path\nexport PATH=$PATH:/Users/Shared/Ninja/:\n\n# Adding GCC to Path\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/gcc-8.2/bin/:\n\necho Path Updated\n\nYet when I double click on Finder I get this:\nPath Updated\nlogout\nSaving session...\n...copying shared history...\n...saving history...truncating history files...\n...completed.\nDeleting expired sessions...none found.\n\n[Process completed]\n\nNamely it is gone.\nIs the a way to have a file which does the following (Maybe it has to be 2 different files, I don't know):\n\n\n*\n\n*If clicked from finder will open a new terminal window with all the variables defined / updated (Including the PATH).\n\n*If run from terminal will update the current terminal state.\n\n\nAny idea?\n\nA: You need to explicitly start an interactive bash shell at the end of your script in order to keep the window open when you open the .command file from Finder.\nThe following revision of your script demonstrates that and also streamlines other aspects of your code:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Note: $PATH already exists as an exported variable, assigning to it\n#       again preserves that status, so there's no need to call `export` below.\n\n# Adding CMake to Path\nPATH+=:/Users/Shared/CMake/CMake.app/Contents/bin/\n\n# Adding Ninja to Path\nPATH+=:/Users/Shared/Ninja/\n\n# Adding GCC to Path\nPATH+=:/usr/local/gcc-8.2/bin/\n\ncat <<EOF\nPath updated to:\n\n  $PATH\n\nStarting interactive Bash shell...\nEOF\n\n# Start an interactive Bash shell that inherits this script's environment\n# and keeps the window open.\n# Using -l makes the interactive shell a login shell, which makes it\n# load the same initialization files as shells created by Terminal.app,\n# notably, ~/.bash_profile\n# Be sure that ~/.bash_profile doesn't override $PATH.\nexec bash -l\n\nThis .command file will also from an existing terminal window, but note that you will enter an interactive child shell -  exiting from that child shell will return to you to the original one.\n\nIt is possible to amend your script so that if you invoke it from an existing terminal window (shell), it modifies that shell's environment directly, but you then have to source / . the script on invocation (e.g., . ./script.command):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Note: $PATH already exists as an exported variable, assigning to it\n#       again preserves that status, so there's no need to call `export` below.\n\n# Adding CMake to Path\nPATH+=:/Users/Shared/CMake/CMake.app/Contents/bin/\n\n# Adding Ninja to Path\nPATH+=:/Users/Shared/Ninja/\n\n# Adding GCC to Path\nPATH+=:/usr/local/gcc-8.2/bin/\n\n# Determine if this script is being sourced.\n[[ $0 != \"$BASH_SOURCE\" ]] && sourced=1 || sourced=0\n\ncat <<EOF\nPath updated to:\n\n  $PATH\n\nEOF\n\nif (( sourced )); then # sourced from the calling shell.\n  # The calling shell's environment has been modified - nothing more to do.\n  :\nelse # otherwise: launched from Finder or from a terminal without sourcing\n  # A new interactive shell must be launched for the environment modifications\n  # to take effect and, if launched from Finder, to keep the terminal window\n  # open.\n  echo \"Starting new interactive Bash shell with modified environment...\"\n  # Using -l makes the interactive shell a login shell, which makes it\n  # load the same initialization files as shells created by Terminal.app,\n  # notably, ~/.bash_profile\n  # Be sure that ~/.bash_profile doesn't override $PATH.\n  exec bash -l\nfi \n\n", "Q: Where do I find MacOS graphics drivers?

You can easily install ImageMagick using Homebrew by running:\nbrew install imagemagick\n\nYou can install Homebrew, using the command-line as mentioned here:\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/master/README.md#install-homebrew-on-macos-or-linux\n\nA: Once installed using @Nimesh Neema's answer you can find the location of the command by running\nwhich convert\n\n\nA: There used to be a utility in MacOS at:\n/System/Library/Printers/convert \n\nbut it was removed some time ago, probably around Lion.\nHowever, it was just a symlink to the cupsfilter command (though curiously it presented different flag options).\nYou can still use the cupsfilter command to convert to file types that MacOS understands, using their MIME type. The problem is that PostScript and Encapsulated PostScript share the same MIME type (application/postscript), and cupsfilter only outputs PostScript, rather than EPS. \nEPS is a specific type of PS file, conforming to certain syntax conventions, designed for use as portable image files. \n\nA: MAMP / MAMP PRO\nIf you use MAMP / MAMP Pro, you have to activate the option (checkbox) in PHP tab, 'Extensions' -> Imagick / ImageMagick\nAnd you can find binary here :\n\n/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/convert\n\n", "Q: How to change margin width of iBooks in macOS Is it possible to change the margin width in iBooks in macOS?

Assuming not, what is it trying to tell me?\nBackground\nFor various reasons I want to re-install the original Mac OS X. To do this I am trying to boot from an original Snow Leopard disc in the SuperDrive. I have no reason to suspect a problem with either the disc (no scratches or other signs of damage and it boots a Mid 2009 MacBook Pro just fine) or the optical drive (it loads other discs fine).\nThe Mac boots fine otherwise (both normally and in Safe Mode), but just doesn’t want to boot from this disc and I have no idea why, but I’m pretty sure the beeps are the key! :)\nSpecifications:\n\n*\n\n*iMac, 27\", Mid 2011\n\n*16GB RAM\n\n*2 GB GDDR5 (Radeon HD 6970M)\n\n*3.4GHz Intel Core i7\n\n*Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 installed on the internal drive\n\nUpdate\nUpon checking after Monomeeth's answer I can add that the original Snow Leopard disc I am trying to boot from is indeed a retail version containing 10.6.3.\n\n\nA: No, your Mac is not possessed. And Yes, it’s trying to tell you something!\nA looping three beeps in between three seconds during startup is your iMac’s way of telling you that the operating system you’re trying to boot into is incompatible with your Mac hardware.\nIn other words, the Snow Leopard disc you’re trying to boot from contains a version of Snow Leopard that is earlier than version 10.6.6 (the earliest your iMac can support).\nMy guess is that you’re not using the grey disc that shipped with your iMac. It’s either one that belongs to another Mac or it’s a retail version that’s earlier than 10.6.6.\nThe only ways to get around this is to use another disc or do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your iMac into Target Disk Mode by pressing and holding the T key as you startup\n\n*Connect it to your Mid 2009 MBP with a FireWire cable (once connected it’ll be seen by the MBP as an external hard drive)\n\n*Boot the MBP from the Snow Leopard disc \n\n*Now install Snow Leopard onto the external drive (i.e. the iMac’s drive)\n\n*Reboot the MBP from the iMac drive and then upgrade Snow Leopard to the latest version (i.e. 10.6.8) so that you know for sure it’ll boot the iMac fine\n\n*Shutdown both the MBP and iMac and then try rebooting the iMac as normal from its internal drive that now has Snow Leopard installed.\n\n\nWARNING: You should always ensure you have a backup of your data, especially when performing operations such as this!\n\nA: I too got this.

But after selecting the windows option, I end up with a \"No bootable device - insert boot disk… \n1.https://bleeptobleep.blogspot.com/2013/02/mac-install-windows-7-or-8-on-external.html\n2.https://blog.macsales.com/40947-tech-tip-how-to-use-boot-camp-on-an-external-drive\nWould be fantastic if someone has experience with this and could give me a hint!\nCheers!\nEdit: I've now also tried the tutorial here: No bootable device USB 2.0 MacBook Pro mid 2014\nI've adapted the Disk and partition IDs to match my system. Same result, after reboot of the mac the external hard drive is recognized as windows partition, but remains not bootable. \n\nA: The answer is NO. I you are reading somewhere else that this is possible, then either you are being lied to or the instructions are for a different model Mac.\n2009 Macs need to BIOS boot Windows. The Boot Camp Assistant assumes you will be installing Windows by using the optical drive. The 2009 model year Macs can not BIOS boot from an external drive.\nYou can try to EFI boot Windows 7, but I do not believe you can EFI boot Window 7 from an internal or external drive on a 2009 Mac. \nApple eliminated the optical drive in Macs starting with the 2012 model year. In order to be able to install a BIOS booting Windows 7, Apple modified the firmware on these models to allow for BIOS booting of Windows from the USB port. This allowed Windows installer flash drives to boot from the USB port. Eventually, this also allowed a BIOS booting Windows to be installed on USB HDD and SSD. (See this question for an example) However, this required installing without the aid of the Boot Camp Assistant.\nApple eliminated the BIOS software from firmware in Macs starting with the 2015 model year. This effectively ended the ability to install and run Windows 7. Current Mac models only UEFI boot Windows and do not even need a flash drive to install Windows. However, you can still use a flash drive if you wish to install without the aid of the Boot Camp Assistant.\n\nA: While you can boot from external media, Windows itself cannot (in most cases). One way to overcome this is using an up to date version of Windows with Windows-to-Go support and a fast USB-based drive (FireWire booting doesn't work with Windows).\n", "Q: Is there a publicly-accessible changelog for Mojave beta? I have an Apple Developer account, but it is not a paid account - I'm not really a developer, I just like to be able to see what's going on.\nTherefore, when I try to access https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/ to find what's new in - for this week, public beta 8 - I'm met with a link to developer beta 10, which I cannot access.\nNowhere can I find a similar link to the current public beta.\nDo Apple provide any changelog for public betas?\nNote: I don't need a blow-by-blow account of every commit, just the broad strokes.\n\nA: Short answer, no.\nApple doesn't provide release notes for public beta software. However, a comprehensive release notes report is available to registered developers enrolled in paid developer program (I am a paid registered developer).\nAs you mentioned, you are not looking for release notes from a developers perspective, but just need the broad strokes on what has changed. May I suggest looking through the one of the various blogs covering Apple news to get an idea.\nOne such popular site is MacRumors. They are generally quite prompt with any updates in the Apple ecosystem. MacRumors also share a birds eye view on the changelog with more user centric release notes.\nSee their blog post announcing macOS Mojave 10th public beta which outlines the user facing changes introduced in the macOS Mojave and notes the changes introduced since the last beta. Each post generally also link to the post for previous release and can be traced back to the first beta.\n", "Q: Using an external HD as my applications folder I need to install more applications - can I use my external HD (samsung T5) and add an additional applications folder? I have loads of space on it and it the speeds are great.\n\nA: Yes, you can use an external drive to keep (install) apps.\nYou should be fine. You don't need to specifically create a folder named Applications on the external drive. Any name or directory hierarchy should be fine.\nmacOS apps are generally made available as bundles (.app extension) which is technically a directory appearing as a single file to the user (with a specialized structure). An app bundle could be placed anywhere on secondary storage and the app can be used without any difference.\nBy default, apps are installed in boot volume's /Applications directory and are automatically made available to all the users on macOS. Keeping an app bundle in a folder/drive only accessible to you limits the app available to you.\nOn a related note, it is worth mentioning for the macOS newcomers that installing/uninstalling an app in macOS is as simple affair as copying/trashing the app's .app file.\n", "Q: PDF exported from Notes is unreadable I have some manuscript notes written in iPad Notes with Apple Pencil, which I need to export to PDF. Unfortunately the generated PDF is useless: For some reason, the text is squeezed in the left, occupying just a small fraction of the page, and the resolution is so bad that the text is unreadable even if zoomed: see the screenshot below.  What can I do?\n\nA: When iOS Notes creates a PDF, it will scan the page to only print the content it needs to and not a lot of blank space. The fact that you do have a lot of blank space indicates that there is something on the right side of the page that has been drawn (maybe a small dot or line) and Notes will see it as content to be converted, giving you the large white space.\nEnsure that there is absolutely no content on the right hand side of the page (use the eraser tool) and try again.\n", "Q: How can I browse Cydia repos without an iOS device? My understanding is that Cydia is a mechanism for accessing third-party software repos on iOS. (The equivalent of Homebrew for macOS.)\nHowever, I am having trouble locating the \"default\" Cydia repos, and browsing them to see what software is available. How can I do this without an iOS device?\nFor example, is there an equivalent of the https://f-droid.org (a similar tool + website for Android)?\n\nA: Cydia is really a GUI front end for apt, the homebrew equivalent on iOS and many other Linux systems, so a Cydia repo is really an apt repo.\nYou can use CyDownload to view and download the packages(.debs) on your computer. \nSome popular repos:\n\n\n*\n\n*BigBoss(http://apt.thebigboss.org/repofiles/cydia/)\n\n*Packix(https://repo.packix.com/)\n\n*Chariz(https://cydia.hbang.ws)\n\n*Coolstar/Electra(https://electrarepo64.coolstar.org/) (for iOS >= 11)\n\n*Saurik/Cydia(http://apt.saurik.com/) (for iOS <= 10)\n\n", "Q: Is there a strictly-libre Cydia repo? The Android equivalent of Cydia is the F-Droid app. The associated F-Droid repo contains strictly free/libre/open-source software.\nIs there an equivalent Cydia repo that only hosts libre software?

It was on iOS 11.2.6 and after using it for some minutes, downloading and managing some apps, I noticed that the iPad refused to enter \"app wiggle\" mode upon holding apps. I can still delete apps from Settings, but not from the home screen.\nI am also able to move apps around by holding and dragging them, similarly to an Android phone, but I can't get the apps to wiggle and have the \"X\" delete button. I have to hold and drag each app, while on other iOS versions I could just hold down once for ~1 second and then all apps would be draggable without any additional holding down.\nI tried fully restoring the iPad to 11.4.1, the latest and the only signed version, with iTunes, and I even tried manually downloading an IPSW file and repeating the full restore. What surprises me most is that even after a full reset, the device still exhibits this bug.\nOn the other hand, all my other iPhones all work with wiggle mode in iOS 11. I couldn't find any information about this type of issue on the internet. Is this normal/expected behavior on iOS 11 iPads, or if not, what can I do to fix my iDevice?\n\nA: To enter app wiggle mode on iOS 11 and up, only on iPad systems, it is necessary to hold an app icon for about four seconds, whereas on older versions it would activate much quicker. On the other hand, on iPad, apps can be moved without entering app wiggle mode.\n", "Q: Trying to understand inconsistent web access In a library with an iPad and a MacBook Pro (MBP) on unsecured WiFi.  Websites in Safari on the iPad are showing no problems.  \nOn the MBP, Safari says “server unexpectedly dropped connection” for every website tried.  \nOn Firefox, it’s connection timed out.  \nTor is able to connect to directory server but unable to establish connections to any of the entry nodes it offers. The log shows the connection failures are of three different types.  All are on port 443, and my browsing is always https when possible.  But https is working on the iPad.\nPing takes 40-100 milliseconds to echo the same domains that the web browser cannot reach.\nHard to imagine library staff having any reason for device detection, if even the ability to implement it.\nDevices forty centimeters apart, so probably on the same router.\nWhat would cause this inconsistency?\nUPDATE: Both devices have behaved as expected everywhere else as long as I’ve owned them.  I risked reprimand :-) by transferring the Cat-5 cable from their Windows box to the MBP.  en0 became active, but would not connect even to their router.  Prefs said that I had a self-assigned IP address, but the menu said using DHCP, and renewing the lease got a 169.x.x.x address which I would never manually assign, and is weird because their WiFi router is 172.16.110.1 according to trace route.\nDNS was resolving host names on both devices.\nSafari has no extensions installed, yet when I change https to http, it gets changed back.  Firefox has “https everywhere” but turning it off does not fix the problem.  Tried to check port 80 in shell but there is no telnet executable!\nsftp times out on the command line.  No ftp executable either (grr).  Finder connected to the ftp port and displayed contents, but then announced connection interrupted—and about 1.5 seconds later entire screen went gray; had to reboot.  Second try, Finder gets the spinning pizza, and won’t do anything else, not even shut down on the menu bar.  Relaunch from the dock killed the Finder and it did not come back.  That sounds like something wrong with the MBP but still, the WiFi access worked fine many other places.\nIn case the above is too confusing or doesn't say everything:\n\n\n*\n\n*No problems noted on the iPad.\n\n*MBP could do ping, traceroute, DNS, and whois\n\n*MBP could not do http, https, smtp, imap, exchange, or sftp\n\n*tor could contact its directory servers via port 9001 but could not use the addresses found on port 443.\n\n*although the shell could not invoke ftp, Finder could, and displayed the known contents of the remote directory.  However, something about doing so caused Finder to crash the O.S. and to not work properly until the fourth reboot.\n\n\nA: There's a lot in this question that revolves around misconceptions and this answer is an attempt to address them to give a more holistic view of how things work.\nConnectivity\n\nOn the MBP, Safari says “server unexpectedly dropped connection” for\nevery website tried.\nOn Firefox, it’s connection timed out.\n\nYour connection isn't browser dependent.  If your connection doesn't work, it's not going to work for any browser.\n\nPing takes 40-100 milliseconds to echo the same domains that the web\nbrowser cannot reach.\n\nThis is not indicative of anything other than one device can connect (iPad) while one cannot (MBP).  A ping time of 40-100ms is well within what's considered \"normal.\"\n\nsftp times out on the command line. No ftp executable either (grr).\nFinder connected to the ftp port and displayed contents, but then\nannounced connection interrupted\n\nLike  your browser, CLI tools like sftp, scp, ssh, etc. aren't going to connect if there's no connection.  The spinning \"pizza\" (aka spinning beach ball of death) is Finder waiting for the result of the connection - either you get a directory to display or it times out.  This is entirely normal.\nAs for FTP and Telnet, those were removed because they are grossly insecure.\nDNS Issues\n\nDNS was resolving host names on both devices.\n\nDNS is cached locally.  This is how you can be disconnected, but when you attempt to ping an address you've already been to, it will immediately resolve but give you a host not reachable or timeout error message.\nThe main point here, is that this is not indicative of anything.  To see if DNS is working correctly, you need to use a tool like dig or nslookup to actually query the DNS server directly.\n\nTor is able to connect to directory server but unable to establish\nconnections...\n\nSame thing.  DNS is cached, but when you attempt to actually connect to a server, it can't because you're not connected.\nAncillary Assumptions\nA few other minor details that need to be cleared up:\n\nHard to imagine library staff having any reason for device detection,\nif even the ability to implement it.\n\nYes they do and, they most certainly do; in that order.  WiFi is not an unlimited resource and every organization must implement controls to ensure access for everyone.  They may require registration of your device, they may have a captured portal that asks for certain info, or they may look at traffic, but they can and do detect devices and filter content.\nIt could be as complex as device authentication mechanisms and device detection or as simple as they ran out of IPs on that particular subnet.  However, the next statement gives us a clearer picture:\n\nI risked reprimand :-) by transferring the Cat-5 cable from their\nWindows box to the MBP. en0 became active, but would not connect even\nto their router. Prefs said that I had a self-assigned IP address, but\nthe menu said using DHCP, and renewing the lease got a 169.x.x.x\naddress which I would never manually assign, and is weird because\ntheir WiFi router is 172.16.110.1 according to trace route.\n\nNot just reprimand, but depending on the organization and how their AUP (Acceptable Use Policy) is written, you could have been banned and had a police report filed for \"interfering with a government owned computer/network\".  (I know, I write and update these things).\nHowever, your results (getting a self assigned IP) tells us something very important - they use some sort of authentication to allow computers onto the network (probably RADIUS).  If it works on their Windows machines, but not on your MBP, it's a safe bet they have something preventing foreign computers from accessing their network  (so, yes, they have a reason and the ability to implement device detection).\n\nDevices forty centimeters apart, so probably on the same router.\n\nThere's nothing other than getting a list of associated clients from each of the WAPs (Wireless Access Points; not routers) that can confirm this.  WAPs are placed  in physical locations for more than just signal strength, there may be high demand in particular locations so you may have more in one area than another.  Just because a WAP can support up to (for example) 256 clients, doesn't mean it can do so simultaneously.\nTL;DR\nYour MBP is not connected to the network while your iPad does and is.  If you've confirmed that your WiFi works properly everywhere else but the Library, you need to approach the Library support staff to look into it (maybe they're out of resources or you're actually blocked).  Do not circumvent their systems and/or policies in order to get connected.\n", "Q: VirtualBoxVM instances and Apple ID I've got a late 2013 Mac Pro running VirtualVM on it.

Is that completely wrong?\nI was looking for something I wrote recently, and didn't remember whether it was text, a WP document, email, a note, or something else. So I opened a Finder window, hit command-F, switched to \"Contents\", and typed in a few words. Got lots of stuff, but not the file I wanted.\nI tried many alternate words and phrases, limiting the search to my user area, limiting modification dates, etc. etc. -- nothing.\nThen I opened Notes and did a search there.

Notes does not store its content as a simple .txt or .rtf files so it gets its information by querying the app for the content you provide it.

This includes turning off email fetch, background app refresh, automatic downloads, and iCloud photo sync. As well as setting screen lock to 30 seconds and keeping the brightness low. \nList of Low Power Mode settings\n\nA: With ios13, you can make an automation that turns on low power mode when your phone turns it off.   \n\n\nA: There is no way to achieve this functionality as it will always turn off at 80% as the purpose of it is to extend your phone when at low battery.\nFrom this Apple Support discussion:\n\nLow Power Mode reduces or turns off Email fetch, Hey Siri, Background\n  app refresh, Automatic downloads, Wi-Fi associations, and some visual\n  effects. If you can live without having those features available on\n  the phone, you can keep it on low power mode. But after you charge\n  your iPhone to 80% or higher, Low Power Mode automatically turns off,\n  so you'll have to turn it back on again.\n\n\nA: Cronios lets you do so with help from shortcuts. It is not officially possible to run shortcuts in background for long. \nI would like some community help in making the shortcut which runs in the background or is triggered by battery percentage hitting 80 and then toggling Low power mode on. \nThis workflow is not as understandable to me as compared to other languages I generally code in.\nhttps://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/df0f2c800dc748d2903ccc54e2b99c24\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/aau4iq/cronios_run_your_shortcuts_on_an_automatic/\nhttps://routinehub.co/shortcut/1370\nAlso I am not affiliated to this product in any development or business. \n", "Q: MacOS SSH connect using key I'm trying to connect to my host using SSH key.

This shouldn't normally be the case for a file under /Library/ but people do the weirdest things.\n\n*The kext itself is blocking the delete operation.

It also contain some software crucial to my use.\nCan I boot into it using my 2015 13\" MacBook Air?\n\nA: Unfortunately you can't.\nOS X Yosemite 10.10.2 is the earliest OS supported on your 2015 MacBook Air. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard is too archaic (released in 2009) and you won't be able to boot into it on your 2015 MacBook Air.\n\nA: The catch with Apple is that you cannot install older OS X/macOS your Mac was shipped originally with. Your MacBook Air came with OS X Yosemite (10.10.2). And you won't support OS X versions older than that. The 10.6 Snow Leopard was released a decade ago and that's why you can't install it on your Air.\n\nA: You should not be able to boot the Snow Leopard stored on external drive using 2015 MacBook Air.\nIt might be possible to boot the external drive using a Virtual Box machine running on a 2015 MacBook Air.\nHowever before attempting to use a virtual machine, have you considered installing the crucial software on the 2015 MacBook Air? Most of the software I used, which worked with Snow Leopard, still works with High Sierra. This software original was in the form of DVD's. To install on my 2013 iMac (which does not have an optical drive), I used one of the following  solutions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Checked with the software company's website to see if a downloadable installer was now available. For example, Adobe has downloads for most of its legacy products.\n\n*Used the internet to share a optical drive with an older Mac. Used the software DVD to install to the 2013 iMac.\n\n*Use the Disk Utility application on an older Mac with an optical drive to convert the DVD to an ISO or DMG file. Transferred the file to the 2013 iMac and install the software.\n\n\nAnother possibility would be to boot to OS X Recovery over the internet and upgrade Snow Leopard to the OS X that was originally installed on your iMac. This should be either Yosemite or El Capitan. This option might require Snow Leopard be version 10.6.8.\nUpdate\nThere is some controversy regarding whether running Snow Leopard in a VirtualBox virtual machine would violate the SLA. To be clear, I intend for the OP to leave Snow Leopard on the external drive. VirtualBox would then be used to boot from the physical external drive. Here still is only one copy of Snow Leopard installed on the external drive. Snow Leopard will boot and execute using Apple hardware. \nBasically the SLA requires you run Snow Leopard on only one Apple machine at a time. There is no requirement that the machine be physical or virtual, as long as the physical hardware is Apple.\nI know the SLA for Snow Leopard does not explicitly refer to virtual machines and the SLA for later versions of OS X and macOS do make such references. But, these later references are in addition to the requirements for the first installation. In other words, the later SLA's allow for simultaneous executions of the same licensed operating system, as long as the additional executions are in virtual machines.\nFor example, the SLA for Mavericks contains the word directly in 2.B.(i) which would indicate a non-virtual execution, but 2.B.(iii) then allows for virtual executions. The SLA for Snow Leopard simply states a single Apple-branded computer. There is nothing in the SLA stating Snow Leopard can not be run virtually. There is only the requirement for the purchase of a SLA for each actual or virtual simultaneous execution of Snow Leopard.\n\nNote: One strange thing about the Snow Leopard SLA: the word snow never appears.\n\nAppendix: The Snow Leopard SLA\nENGLISH\nAPPLE INC. \nSOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR MAC OS X \nSingle Use, Family Pack and Leopard Upgrade Licenses for use on Apple-branded Systems\nPLEASE READ THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (\"LICENSE\") CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APPLE SOFTWARE.

If I disconnect Wi-Fi and reconnect after a few seconds, the Internet connection works, but only for a few minutes, and then I have to disconnect and connect again.\nWhen I connect the mac with others wifi works perfectly but the one at home gives me this problem only on my macbook. Because i have also an iphone and ipad and for them (the wifi that i use at home) works perfectly.\nIt's very annoying. I had the same issues with macOS Sierra, so I decided to update the OS, but it's the same.\nIf someone can help me I'll be really grateful, thanks.\n\nA: Troubleshooting can be a process of elimination and often requires patience. Below are a few things you can try. \nTry another 'Wi-Fi' network\nIt'd be interesting to see whether your MBA can maintain an internet connection from another Wi-Fi network. If you have an iPhone you can share an internet connection from its cellular connection and connect to that via your Mac's Wi-Fi port? Does this allow your MBA to browse the web, send/receive emails, etc and maintain the connection for longer than the five or so minutes you're having problems with?\nAnother way to test this is via a public Wi-Fi services (McDonalds, Starbucks, etc).\nTest your Wi-Fi network\nIf your MBA connects fine to other Wi-Fi networks, then it's time to test your home Wi-Fi connection with other devices (such as an iPhone, iPad, etc) to see if they also drop a connection. If they do then you know it's your Wi-Fi network that needs investigating. \nOn the other hand, if they connect fine, it may be time to reboot your Wi-Fi router.

First of all, I understand there are similar posts, however, they are to do with previous generation iPhones. This is specifically about the iPhone X.\nHow accurate is the GPS information that developers can get when using the iPhone X?\nI am thinking about making a Raspberry Pi project where I need to get precise location data to create a map and calculate speed for some telemetry system I am making.\nTo check that it is do able first, I will test it with my iPhone X as I already have all the hardware. If the GPS is not accurate enough, I will go straight to the Pi setup. For example the GPS module I will be using updates location 10 times a second. What does the iPhone X do?\n\nA: \nHow accurate is the GPS information that developers can get when using the iPhone X?\n\nIt's a subjective question and the perceived accuracy of location data may differ based on usage, location and signal availability. While the real answer can only be obtained by actually capturing the data, I'll try to share some information which can help you with your query.\niPhone X along with its contemporaries iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, are the first iPhones to include support for not one but four geolocation services:\n\nA brief description of each one of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*GPS: Global Positioning System (GPS), originally Navstar GPS, is a satellite-based radionavigation system owned by the United States government and operated by the United States Air Force.\n\n*GLONASS: Globalnaya navigatsionnaya sputnikovaya sistema, or Global Navigation Satellite System, is a space-based satellite navigation system operating in the radionavigation-satellite service. It provides an alternative to GPS and is the second navigational system in operation with global coverage and of comparable precision.\n\n*Galileo: Galileo is the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) that is being created by the European Union (EU) through the European GNSS Agency (GSA). One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent high-precision positioning system so European nations do not have to rely on the Russian GLONASS, Chinese BeiDou or US GPS systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators at any time. The use of basic (lower-precision) Galileo services will be free and open to everyone. The higher-precision capabilities will be available for paying commercial users. Galileo is intended to provide horizontal and vertical position measurements within 1-metre precision, and better positioning services at higher latitudes than other positioning systems.\n\n*QZSS: The Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) is a project of the Japanese government for the development of a four-satellite regional time transfer system and a satellite-based augmentation system for the United States operated Global Positioning System (GPS) to be receivable in the Asia-Oceania regions, with a focus on Japan. The goal of QZSS is to provide highly precise and stable positioning services in the Asia-Oceania region, compatible with GPS.\nWhile GPS support has been available since iPhone 3G, GLONASS was added starting with iPhone 4S (ref: List of iOS devices).\nSome references from the Web which back the claim that availability of multiple service support will lead to more accurate positioning data:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X Support the Galileo Satellite System for Better GPS:\n\n\n\nAccording to the European Global Navigation Satellite Systems Agency, Galileo support in the new iPhones will allow users to benefit from more precise positioning that's able to combine GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo signals. Galileo, says the agency, has a modern signal structure that's able to help users better maintain their position fix when navigating through cities worldwide.\nMulti-satellite support also increases signal availability in urban areas where buildings can obstruct the sky and limit the number of visible satellites. Galileo has 15 operational satellites in orbit and three that are in testing, compared to 31 GPS satellites and 24 GLONASS satellites. By 2020, Galileo is expected to have 30 satellites operational.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The latest iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X are Galileo-enabled:\n\n\n\nAmong the new features of the latest Apple offerings is the fact that the newest versions of the iPhone are Galileo-enabled. The resulting ‘multi-constellation’ capability means that users of the new iPhones will be able to benefit from more precise positioning that combines GPS, Glonass and Galileo signals. The use of multi-constellation increases signal availability, especially in urban environments, where buildings obstruct the sky and limit the number of satellites visible. In terms of accuracy, Galileo’s modern signal structure has better resistance to multipath, which helps users maintain their position fix when navigating in cities.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*New iPhones better serve you in different parts of the world with support for Galileo and QZSS satellites\n\nCombining GPS, GLONASS and Galileo signals lets new iPhones increase signal availability in urban environments where buildings obstruct the sky and limit the number of satellites visible.\nIn terms of accuracy, Galileo’s signal structure is said to provide better resistance to multipath, which helps iPhone users maintain their position fix when navigating in cities.\n\n\nA: iPhone X GPS accuracy is the same as iPhone 8, 7, 6S, 6, 5S and all recent galaxy phones. That is because none of the smartphones come with a GPS chip in them. \nPhones do not have GPS, they have GPS capability. This capability stems from the modem chip that’s used to make phone calls and stems as a byproduct designed to receive GPS signals originally intended for clock maintenance needed for high speed internet to maintain internal phone clock.\nThey quickly realized it can also be used as low quality GPS, this is why current phones have such horrible accuracy of a radius that’s about 15 meters (45 feet) in diameter in some less optimal conditions, where real GPS with a GPS chip, update rate of 10 times per second, and SBAS, you will get below 1 meter precision without breaking sweat. \nPhone GPS capability is okay for walking around a city, due to having more GNSS ability makes it very good for getting signal in places with tall buildings, but having Glonass, Compass etc in addition to GPS itself, does not increase accuracy, a dedicated GPS chip would be the only thing Apple could add, those chips are insanely small and insanely good at what they do, there’s plenty of space inside the iPhone, like for example that piece of plastic where headphone jack used to be.\n", "Q: Change keyboard shortcut for hard refresh in Google Chrome for macOS I'm used to using F5 to refresh a webpage in browser. On  Mac, I found a way to change the keyboard shortcut for refreshing. Under System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts, I added Google Chrome.app with the Menu Title set to Reload This Page and the Keyboard Shortcut set to F5.\nThis all went very well, however I would also like to be able to do a hard reload by using Control + F5. I have googled for ages but unable to find a working Menu Title for hard refresh.\nDoes anyone know how to change the keyboard shortcut for a hard reload, or what the Menu Title for it is?\n\nA: The Menu Title for hard reload in Google Chrome for macOS is Force Reload This Page with the default keyboard shortcut set to: Shift + Command + r. The Menu Title is revealed when the said key combination are depressed or when you search for matching title under Google Chrome Menu → Help → Search. (as user will not be initially aware of the shortcut.)\n\nMenu Title revealed on key depression:\n\n\nMenu Title revealed on searching:\n\n\nWhen setting the keyboard shortcut, set Menu Title as: Force Reload This Page and register Control + F5 as the intended keyboard shortcut.\n\nReload This Page:\n\n\nForce Reload This Page:\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts after assignment:\n\n", "Q: Do these horizontal lines on MacBook screen signify logic board or graphics card failure? \nMy friend has been experiencing problems with his MacBook recently. The machine powers on but at some stage, usually during the boot, it will freeze and the display will look as pictured with black and white horizontal blocks on screen, arranged in 5 columns. Very occasionally it will boot all the way to open the user profile and allow a few minutes of normal use before the lines appear.\nApple Hardware Test doesn't highlight a problem. On the couple of occasions that macOS Recovery did load, Disk Utility ran First Aid without any errors.\nWe would like to know is the odds of a hardware problem e.g. graphics chipset or logic board?\n\nA: MacBook support USB target disk mode so you should still be able to boot and back up the data from the storage and/or pay for just labor when it goes in for hardware repair.\nIt might be hard to see what’s up, but most times this is GPU / cabling when you have those glitches - it’s less likely just the screen based on the image.\nYou might even be able to connect the Time Machine drive or navigate carefully and set up Time Machine and let it run overnight to get a backup still. That will also let you know the GPU / graphics is the only failure and not the core processing and storage.\n\nSince the MacBook has a unified storage / logic board / GPU - it won’t matter so much what fault is as 95% of the repairs will be to swap out that assembly entirely and send that part back to get refurbished in the factory. A mail in repair for this would be covered under AppleCare or warranty in all likelyhood and if you paid for an official repair, expect less than $350 for parts and labor and shipping and testing in the US.\n", "Q: Can I change launchd program arguments based on calendar interval? I'm trying to run a script (zfssnap.sh) to automate snapshots, but one of the arguments needs to change based on which time entry triggers the script to start. With cron, I would just add a new line with the changed argument and set the time fields accordingly. \nIn reading the launchd and launchd.conf man pages, I'm not seeing any way to associate an argument with a specific StartCalendarInterval key entry. This seems like a significant limitation, so perhaps I'm missing something?\nIs there a way change an argument based on the time the script is being run? Or, do I have to make a new plist for each of the situations I'm trying to satisfy?\n\nA: The \"standard\" thing to do is make a new .plist for each different time/argument combo. This is essentially the equivalent of making multiple entries in the crontab, except that each \"entry\" is an entire file, not just a line.\nThere's a good example of this in macOS's launch daemon entries for the periodic maintenance program. /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-daily.plist runs /usr/libexec/periodic-wrapper with the argument \"daily\" and a 24-hour interval, ...periodic-weekly.plist runs it with the argument \"weekly\" and a 7-day interval, and ...periodic-monthly.plist runs it with the argument \"monthly\" and a 30.44-day interval.\n", "Q: How do I control which monitor an application will appear on? I just switched to Mac from Windows.  \nIn Windows, if you have multiple monitors, application windows tend to appear wherever you most commonly put them. If you have different setups (for example a laptop with one external monitor at home but three monitors at work) Windows will even tend to remember where you like to put each app on each setup.\nHow do you do that on Mac?\n\nA: On Mac you can configure each app to open on a certain monitor.  They don't adapt to different monitor setups, they go where you configure them.    But there are a bunch of non-obvious steps to do it.\n1) In System Preferences -> Mission Control you have to set \"Displays have Separate Spaces\" to True.  Otherwise, all your monitors are one \"space\" and application assignments are impossible.\n2) You have to have your monitor(s) plugged in.\n3) At least one of your monitors has to have two or more Desktops of its own.  If you have one Desktop on each Monitor, that's two or more altogether but it's not enough.  You have to create another Desktop on either monitor, even if you don't intend to use it.  That's the key to unlocking the elusive menus that allow you to configure this.\n4) That was easy, wasn't it?   With all that out of the way, start any app, right click on its Dock icon, choose Options and there you will see \"Assign To\".  As far as I can ascertain the options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*All - The app will open on the monitor where you started it from, and appear in all desktops on that monitor.\n\n*Desktop on Display 1 : The app will always open on Display 1, in whichever Desktop is active.\n\n*Desktop on Display 2, 3, etc: you get this.\n\n*None: The app will open in the active desktop on the monitor where you started it.   If you unplug monitors, Apps configured for specific monitors will also behave this way.\n\n\nNow go do that for each app you want to configure. \n", "Q: Chrome Extentions Autoupdate So I am wondering if it's possible that Google chrome extensions can be updated even if the computer/device turned off?\n\nA: Assuming I understand your question correctly, there is no way for software to autoupdate without a device being switched on. Autoupdates require an internet connection to function properly. \nMore specifically, an internet connection is needed to compare the currently installed version with the latest version available and, when a new version is available, to download the new version. In some cases, an internet connection is also required to perform the actual installation.\nSince an internet connection is required, the device must be powered up for the process to work. In other words a device that is switched off can not autoupdate any of its software, nor can a device that is switched on but not connected to the internet (often referred to as standalone devices).\n", "Q: iOS 11.4.1 Mail app w/ Exchange account keeps crashing “8badf00d” Summary: iOS 11.4.1 Mail app keeps crashing with a specific Exchange account. I didn't have this problem with iOS 10 on my iPhone 7 Plus. This all became an issue when I starting using iOS 11 and iPhone X.\nI'm wondering is it something in my Exchange inbox that's causing the issue and if I can find out what it is, will deleting it help? Is this possibly due to a timeout issue? My exchange account has at least 300k emails in it. I'm in the process of cleaning that out.\nI have done all the troubleshooting as far as deleting/adding the account again, restoring the backup of my iPhone, deleting read/delivery receipts from the inbox and it still crashes.

I know that many organisations are even rolling out VMware's Boxer app because of issues accessing MS Exchange Server accounts on mobile devices.\n", "Q: Can iOS apps read the location metadata when allowing access to Photos? I am just wondering if by allowing access to Photos, the application has access to read the EXIF metadata (including where the photo was taken and stuff like that).\nIs that possible?\n\nA: Yes, the app will have access to the full image data including the EXIF metadata that could contain for example GPS location amongst other things.\nOn the contrary if you're using a web app and uploading photos to it, the EXIF metadata will automatically be stripped by Safari before giving it to the web app.\n", "Q: Skype switches to discrete graphics card and shows blank settings When I force Mac to use integrated graphics card, Skype displays blank page when clicking settings.

Go to System preferences/ security and privacy/ privacy - accessibility and add Finder.app and \"SOME_APP_NAME\" to the list of programs allowed to control your computer.\n\n\nA: Add the app to \"Full Disk Access\"\nIn Mojave, under Security & Privacy, there is a new tab called \"Full Disk Access\".\nAdding my personal Applescript apps to this list (in addition to the existing Accessibility list) has made the prompts disappear.\n\nUpdate 9/26: Upon a couple days of further use, this seems to work sometimes, but not consistently. \n\nA: We have the same issue one user is being prompted for authorisation for \"BASH\" to run and \"RC\", The problem is we are unsure of the origin of the apps.\nAfter poking around in activity monitor I've found whats using them and have allowed them to run the pop ups haven't reoccurred since.\n\nA: The answer to the \"Permanently grant right to control another app to Apple Script App\" Q&A solved this exact issue for me in Mojave:\nLock the file/script/application being executed.\nInstant fix for me, no more prompts!\n\nA: In the past we've used the following terminal command to give the user the ability to \"Allow apps from anywhere\" and this eliminated the need to add apps to Accessibility:\nsudo spctl --master-disable\n\nThat has worked great with Sierra and High Sierra but this new Automation tab in Mojave (installed public release today) seems to be working differently.  Even with the above terminal change we are being prompted to allow all of our apps to control Finder and System Events.  Though, I've found other code signed applications, like Adobe Bridge, have to prompt with this same message as well.  Not sure if there is a way around it.\nI'm hoping that accepting each dialog once will prevent the message from appearing again with future app updates that we send out.  Will be testing that out now.  Otherwise will have to test out the developer/code signed route.\n", "Q: Outlook for Mac 2016: How to write a rule to categorize based on body content Outlook appears to have a rule allowing a message to be acted on based on content, but I have not been able to generate the magic incantation to get it to work.  My goal is to get messages containing the text \"[External Source]\" to be categorized as RED.\nHome->Rule->Create...\n\n\nBut when I apply the rule...nothing.  It does not matter if I apply it to one or many messages.\nIs this feature known to work?  I can get actions to trigger based on subject content and addressees, but not this.\n\nA: My problem ended up being a general failure to Read The Screen.  However, since this is not the first time I have tried to solve a problem like this, and because I did not find any answers that warned about the ambiguity, I am posting what I learned.\nWhat I wanted was a rule that will classify incoming messages with \"[External Source]\" in them as \"Red.\"  My expectation was that I would create the rule, then select all messages in a box and then Right-Click->Rules->Apply->Apply All Rules to test.\nThe test never triggered the rule.  It was the wrong test, or the wrong rule type.  The test that would have worked would be to have sent an external email to myself. \nWith that insight, I decided to write a Client-based rule to do the same thing because I more frequently want a rule that I can apply after-the-fact.\nHowever, it turns out that the syntax for a \"Body contains X\" condition is very different between the two kinds of rules.  For Server Rules, there is a UI for adding various strings and you can specify multiple strings to search for in one condition and you must specify exceptions in a separate section.\nFor a Client Rule, you need to provide one unquoted string.  However, there is no Exception Section, you must specify your exceptions as negative conditions--which complicates your rules if you want to search for multiple strings with a set of exceptions that apply whenever any of the strings is found.  I will leave that as an exercise for the user, but I will show how to create a basic rule here.\nFor the TLDR folks, here are images of the two kinds of rules, followed by a sample rule that does the categorizing on the Client Side.  First, the default Server-Rules modal:\n\nAnd this is what the Server Rule condition to search for strings looks like (note the Except if: heading peeking from behind the modal):\n\nNow, the Client-Rules modal:\n\nAnd, a sample of how the condition setting is different for the Client:\n\nNote, it has if all conditions are met set.  Also, notice that if I wanted to do the same action for a different string, I must create a duplicate rule with that different string.  This looks like a constraint on the UI for Outlook Client Rules.\nThanks to @seamus for his second set of eyes and test case for this.\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite multiple desktops with different files Is there a way to have a second desktop which you can put individual folders and files on it, so that the first desktop is clear without any files?\n\nA: Yes you can. Mac refers to the extra desktops as spaces. You can create up to 8 extra spaces I think and you can control them from Mission Control. The control key plus a digit will make that particular space active.\nif you go to Mission Control (probably in your doc) a window opens showing all the spaces across the top. There is also a plus sign. Clicking the plus sign creates a new space. I find spaces very convenient. I have a space set up for one app and another space for a different app.\n", "Q: annoyance: latest version of Skype under Standard (non-admin) user on macOS 10.13 I always run my systems under an Admin \\ Standard user dichotomy.  In other words, I always use my system as a Standard user and never login to the Admin user (except when doing the initial clean install and configuration).\nThis seems to mostly work on macOS (except for this previously noted annoyance).\nHowever, I specifically have an irritating problem with Skype, where it will pop up a authentication Window stating:\n\nAn update is ready to install.  Skype is trying to add a new helper tool.\n\n...and asking for my Administrator account credentials.\nNow, I've had other programs ask for similar authentications for updates and installs from time to time, and I simply put in my credentials and it installs some update quickly and I continue about my business.  No problem.\nHowever, with Skype, it seems something is simply not working - like perhaps it wasn't designed with Standard users in mind.\nAfter entering my Administrator credentials - nothing installs.  The authentication window simply disappears and nothing happens.\nBut even worse... the window will inevitably appear again after an hour or two.  So I'm constantly being harassed with this notification, and no matter how many times I authenticate the request (dozens of times so far), it just keeps coming back.\nNote that I had this same problem back in Yosemite running whatever version of Skype was the latest back then.  I recently did a clean install of High Sierra, and I had hoped this problem would disappear.\nNope.  Any ideas?\n\nA: So, I was right that Skype has a problem, because it is prompting me to perform the auto-update, but supplying the credentials is not enough.  I have to kind of \"hand-hold\" Skype through the update process, and open the correct window even though there is no indication from Skype that I need to do this.  I was still having this problem after upgrading to Mojave (10.14) and I'm glad I finally figured out this work-around.\n\nIn order to successfully update Skype in macOS as a limited user, you must do it \"manually\".\nWhen the pop up notification appears saying An update is ready to install. Skype is trying to add a new helper tool. and asking for authentication, do not enter your admin credentials yet.\nFirst, click on the Skype menu then About Skype.\nWith the About Skype window open, now you can enter your admin credentials.\nAfter you've entered your admin credentials, you should notice a green Update button is now active in the About Skype window.  Click the button.\nSometimes I have to enter my admin credentials again when the update process starts.  This is normal.\nSkype should automatically reload with the updated version.  Check the About Skype window to confirm you are on the latest version.\n", "Q: Volume control sometimes stuck on MBP '18 My 2018 MacBook Pro is sometimes suffering from 'sticky' volume control.\nWhen I am interacting with the volume controls on the Touch Bar for a longer period of time, the volume control gets stuck sometimes. The sound is then automatically, continuously being muted or (with a bit of bad luck) set to full volume. During this time, the adjustment popup remains constantly visible.\nOnly when I go mach five on the Touch bar and press all the volume buttons in random order (haven't been able to find a pattern), the OS surrenders and I regain control over the volume.\nIt usually occurs once or twice every week. It also occurred on a clean install, so third-party apps acting strange is out of the question.\nIs this a known problem? Is there a permanent solution?\n\nA: First of all, restart your MacBookPro\nIf this doesn't work than try reinstalling macOS by booting into recovery mode by pressing command+r while startup, select \"reinstall macOS\". I recommend doing a backup first even you won't loose any of your files and settings.\n\nA: I also have this issue periodically. I refresh the touch bar by switching apps (cmd+tab).\n", "Q: Issues with WIFI Authentification pages I realized yesterday that I could not see authentification pages of some WIFI. I'm running High Sierra 10.13.\nApparently to solve this issue I have to go to Keychain Access > Preferences > Certificates => disable OCSP and CRL. \nThe problem is that \"Certificates\" panel doesn't exist anymore. \nSome people said that I had to find an old version of keychain.menu (TimeMachine's backup) but I don't have an old backup.\nCould someone please update their old version of keychain.menu or help me one way or another to disable OCSP and CRL?\nThank you very much \n\nA: Solution:\nI had to remove all DNS and empty my DNS cache.\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\nresolved my problem\n\nA: Use terminal and try this\nTo set the CRL settings:\ndefaults write com.apple.security.revocation CRLStyle -string BestAttempt\n\nTo set the OCSP settings:\ndefaults write com.apple.security.revocation OCSPStyle -string BestAttempt\n\nHowever..the WiFi authentication pages are not handled by Certificates.\nThe first step system does is to use the DNS to translate the \"name\" you gave to correct code (the IP address of your WiFi).\nOnce the \"contact\" is established the WiFi sends the authentication pages.\n", "Q: Cannot enable FileVault on macOS High Sierra I've just got a new MacBook Pro, currently running macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra. As I'm the only one using it, it only has one user account, which does have admin privileges. However, I'm encountering some problems attempting to enable FileVault 2 disk encryption. \nIf I try the standard method of going into settings -> security & privacy, then clicking \"enable FileVault\", nothing happens. No error message, it just doesn't respond.\nGoing into terminal, I've tried running sudo fdesetup enable, which returns the following message. Error: A problem occurred while trying to enable FileVault. (-69594).\nBased on a previous answer I saw on here, I then tried booting into recovery mode, and running sudo rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone.\nThis tells me that the sudo command is not recognised. Alternatively, running without sudo returns /var/db/.AppleSetupDone: No such file or directory.\nBasically, I've no idea what else to try, short of wiping the computer and starting from scratch. Any ideas (preferably FileVault, but I'll accept other full disk encryption methods), or is that my only option?\n\nA: Being on MacOS Mojave 10.14.6 the following worked for me. Process was partly derived from below mentioned reddit and https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2019/02/08/unable-to-enable-filevault-on-macos-mojave/.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tested for all user accounts on the computer in terminal the command sudo sysadminctl -secureTokenStatus USER_NAME_HERE. It returned for all accounts \"Secure token is DISABLED for user\". If this is different, see below.\n\n*If for all users step 1 returned \"Secure token is DISABLED for user\", boot into Recovery mode (reboot and hold command-R)\n\n*In Recovery mode start Terminal window (menu Utilities -> Terminal)\n\n*Execute command resetFileVaultpassword to change the passwords for all users.\n\n*Then restart back into normal mode. For me changing all passwords resulted in TouchID becoming disabled, but I could re-enable without issues.\n\n*Now back in normal mode, terminal confirmed for command from step 1 that \"Secure token is ENABLED\". Go to System preferences and enable FileVault.\nMy understanding is that if for at least one user the return in step 1. says \"Secure token is ENABLED for user\", this user could be used to re-enable the desired admin user by\na) promoting the TOKEN_user to admin,\nb) login with the TOKEN_user,\nc) change the password of all non-TOKEN_users (according to https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/74scld/unable_to_turn_on_filevault_on_high_sierra_apfs/do1beb1/ this will make them users with a TOKEN as well), and finally\nd) change promoted TOKEN_user back to normal user.\n\nA: You don't need to boot into recovery mode to run\nsudo rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\nTry it again from your normal volume. That will make your Mac think it is the first time  you have started up, and will run through the setup process again. That should mean that the new user you create in that process has the power to enable FileVault. However, that should have happened the first time.\nIf that doesn't work, I can recommend a couple of sites for background info:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/74scld/unable_to_turn_on_filevault_on_high_sierra_apfs/\nhttps://derflounder.wordpress.com/?s=filevault\nI had a slightly different problem than yours, but the same error code (-69594) when trying to add the ability to unlock FileVault for a particular non-admin user. The user in question didn't have the SecureToken status. I solved it by deleting the AppleSetupDone file, creating a new temporary admin user, logging in as that user, and giving the \nnon-admin user the SecureToken status with the sysadminctl command described in the Reddit article\n", "Q: Can I safely charge a Galaxy S9 with a USB-C MacBook Pro charger? I have a Galaxy S9+ (with \"fast charging\"), which requires a USB-C charger. I also have a MacBook Pro with a USB-C charger. \nI am curious whether I can (safely) charge my Galaxy S9+ with my MacBook charger. The phone shows that it is charging, and very fast actually.\nHowever, I am not sure whether the charger has too much power and would negatively impact the battery on a short time (perhaps get too hot or even cause physical damage/explode) or long-term (decreased battery health).  \n\nA: All devices (Phones) are 5 Volt technology.\nHow fast it charges depends on....\nCan the charger provide the power the battery is asking for.\nBattery is a SMART battery type (it has a chip build in) so it will regulate the charging process safely.\n", "Q: YouTube freezes with Safari I'm running macOS High Sierra and have had a bizarre problem for months. When I use Safari to watch videos on YouTube, occasionally changing the time of the video (either with the arrow keys or with my mouse) causes the entire page to freeze, followed by the spinning beach ball. The audio will still play, but the video does not.\nAfter this, all YouTube pages I have open in other tabs are responsive up until I try to resume their videos, at which point the page will freeze. If I try to get to youtube.com in a new tab, it won't load and I will just remain on my current webpage. Some other sites like google.com or anything with an HTML5 player will load content, but freeze the webpage immediately and cause high CPU usage.\nAt this point, iTunes and Quicktime will be responsive but not play music/videos, and won't reopen when closed. Opening Chrome and trying to get to youtube or google will yield the same result as in Safari. Interestingly, Google does work on Firefox and Youtube pages are accessible and responsive. However, the videos won't play and the \"progress circle\" on videos will spin forever, and it'll eventually notify me \"If playback doesn't begin shortly try restarting your device\"; meanwhile, Firefox will cause high CPU usage.\nSure enough, the only way to fix the problems is rebooting the whole system. This only seems to be caused by Safari and on YouTube. I would still like to use Safari, but it's inconvenient to have to reboot every time this happens. I've tried reinstalling macOS, resetting my NVRAM and clearing my cache, but to no avail.\n\nA: Edit: This solution worked only temporarily. In my case, the problem is on-and-off and there is no way to know when it is going to happen.\nThis exact same thing was happening to me, but in Firefox. This answer from ElementaryOS-SE solved the issue for me. The solution is to basically install the plugin h264ify. From the GitHub page:\n\nBy default, YouTube streams VP8/VP9 encoded video. However, this can cause problems with less powerful machines because VP8/VP9 is not typically hardware accelerated.\n  In contrast, H.264 is commonly hardware accelerated by GPUs, which usually means smoother video playback and reduced CPU usage.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue. What solved it for me was logging out the user with parental controls that was logged in, in the background.\n", "Q: Can I display top charts in my app using album artwork from iTunes? I have used this iTunes API to display the top charts in my app but recently I received an email from Apple about the complaints that Recording Industry Association of America  (RIAA) want to take my app down because of the infringement of album cover artwork. I have seen a lot of others apps are showing the artwork, like:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMusic\n\n*Music Player & Unlimited Songs 4+\nand many more. \n\nA: It seems to me that what Apple's email says is going to be the most important thing here. \nFor example are they asking you to remove the artwork? Or are they just trying to inform you that they're getting complaints?\nMy thinking would be that since you're publishing an app on Apple's App Store that you'd have to take their email as a strong indicator of what you can do (or need to do).\nAs a registered Developer, you can also call Apple Developer Program Support in your country for clarification/guidance.\nFinally, if Apple wants you to stop showing the artwork, it may be worth mentioning the other apps to them. However, it is entirely possible that Apple has also written to their developers too asking them to take the same action.\n\nA: No unless you license that artwork. Contact the owner of the art to get a license. \nYou can’t include fonts or music or text you didn’t make and the same with art. \nIf you’re not sure about the law in your country start with getting a lawyer to read through the contract you signed as a developer and then work through the Apple legal page on what iTunes and API licenses mean. \nWorse, you’re likely running afoul of specific app review guidelines. \n\n\n*\n\n*3.2 Business Models\n\n*4.5 Apple Sites and Services\n\n*5.2 Intellectual Property\n\n\nBut maybe a small change is all Apple is asking.

It now does not recognize either connection.\nSince this could be physical or sortware, how can I further diagnose the problem?\n\nA: Since you don't have the original disks (and therefore don't have Apple Hardware Test), I would try downloading AHT and running it from a USB. The steps to do this are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable USB flash drive by using Disk Utility's Erase function. Make sure you choose OS X Extended for the format and the GUID Partition Map for the scheme. For the purposes of these steps, also give your USB the name AHT when you're erasing it.\n\n*Download the AHT for your particular Mac Pro 1,1 here\n\n*Mount the downloaded image (it should mount as AppleHardwareTest)\n\n*Now you will need to copy the AHT to your USB flash drive. To start, Launch the Terminal app (usually found within the Utilities folder)\n\n*In the Terminal window, enter the following:\ncp -r /Volumes/AppleHardwareTest/System /Volumes/AHT/\n\n*Now we need to make the USB flash drive bootable, so enter the following line in Terminal:\nsudo bless --folder /Volumes/AHT/ --file /Volumes/AHT/System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics/diags.efi --label AHT\n\n*Enter your Admin password\n\n*Leave the USB flash drive plugged in and restart the Mac Pro\n\n*Immediately hold down the Option key\n\n*Select the AHT from the list and boot up\nNOTE for other readers: - Both the Terminal commands and the download link used here were written for this specific question.

I have got Unetbootin and have put the files onto my drive which is properly formatted as MS-DOS(FAT) and GUID. I have several folders and files: [BOOT], boot, casper, dists, EFI, install, isolinux, md5sum.txt, pics, pool, preseed, README.deskdefines. When I go in Startup Disk in System Preferences, or press option in startup, it doesn't show the drive, when I go in Disk Utility, click on the drive, then info, the table shows Bootable: no. I do not know why this is happening, as I followed the legitimate steps. I would like still to install Ubuntu on my MacBook Pro 2018, thank you.\n\nA: First of all, unetbootin or any other ubuntu usb flasher wont \"break\" your usb. If your usb is givving you an error when plugged into mac os saying\"unrecognized drive\",  then this is GOOD! Mac os cannot read a linux filesystem by default. It definitely cant read an ext4 filesystem. The only linux filesystems mac os can read are ext2 and maybe ext3, but even then, that is with the use of external software like Fuse. The linux filesystem is not native to Mac OS, therefore, the os cannot read the disk. However, the linux filesystem CAN be read by intel hardware (which all apple macs use now). Therefore, your mac will be able to read the flashed ubuntu usb and boot the ubuntu installer by you either holding the alt/option key on boot, or if that doesnt work, by installing refind boot manager and using that as a bootloader to boot your usb. If you are trying to dual boot mac and ubuntu, you will most likely need to download & install refind anyway, as that is how you should be selecting which os you want to use at boot. Lastly, because linux is not recognized by Mac OS, it is doubtful that there is a way to get your ubuntu partition (or usb for that matter) to show up in the system preferences boot profile. Once again, to boot your ubuntu partition you must hold the proper start up keys for disk selection at boot, or install refind.\nThe only possible way that these methods won't work or your bootable USB won't be bootable, is if you are using the following outdated hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*PowerPC based Mac\n\n*a much older 64 bit mac with a 32bit efi (such as the 2006 core 2 duo models)\n\n*An older mac that is 32bit using a 32bit efi.\n\n\nIt is highly doubftful that you are using of these types of macs as they are almost 20 years old. Therefore, if you are not able to boot your ubuntu install disk, it tells me that you are doing something wrong, as opposed to the USB stick being \"Broken\".\n\nA: Did you run and install etcher?\nhttps://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#3\nHere's the manual way to make a bootable USB\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20install%20Ubuntu%20on%20MacBook%20using%20USB%20Stick\n", "Q: Unable to install macOS 10.13.6 on mid 2012 macBookPro.

If you're not on 10.13 High Sierra already, then you will need to get the full installer from the Mac App Store. It looks like you are trying to use a High Sierra update -- i.e. something that patches an early version of High Sierra to a later one.\nNote that Apple tends to hide older OS versions from the App Store. Normally, you can only find them in your Purchases, if you've already downloaded them. \nTry this URL.\n\nA: some days ago I was in the same situation as the original poster. \nI had tried everything under the sun, and I was starting to think about not trying the update anymore... But then I had some revelation. I said: \"what would it happen if I tried to install the cumulative update via Recovery mode, from some spare USB I have?\"\nAnd that's exactly what I did. Spoiler: I SUCCEEDED (yay!). So I'm going to list here the steps I can remember I did.\n0.- FIRST OF ALL, THE NEEDED DISCLAIMER: DO A BACKUP OF YOUR MAC SENSITIVE DATA, ETC... I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS, LOST DATA, ETC... IF SOME STEP IS UNCLEAR, CALL SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE IMPLICATIONS OF SAID STEP. THE WHOLE PROCESS WORKED FOR ME, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA IF IT WILL WORK FOR YOU AND YOUR MAC. The \"TERMINAL\" application will be used in the process. If using it seems as black magic for you, call someone who understands how to launch programs and commands via Terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the .dmg file we want to install from Apple, in our case \"10.13.6 incremental update\" from Apple [https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1970]\n\n*Once it finishes downloading, double click onto the .dmg file. A new .pkg file should appear when the .dmg file gets mounted.\n\n*Get a spare USB stick (with at least as much free space as the size of our new .pkg file), and copy this .pkg file onto the USB stick.\n\n*Learn how to boot your Mac into Recovery Mode. If you already know, go to the next step, if not google it.\n\n*Boot your Mac in Recovery mode. Once you do it, it will present you with some random tools on the upper part of the screen, we should look for \"Terminal\", and launch it.\n\n*Once we are inside \"Terminal\", we need to go where our USB stick is mounted. Typically it should appear under /Volumes/USB_STICK_NAME [or whatever name you used to label your USB STICK]. do some \"ls -alcrt\" and double check our \"10.13.6 incremental update.pkg\" file can be found there.\n\n*Now, still in Terminal, we will must launch the unatended .pkg installer typing this:\ninstaller -allowUntrusted -verboseR -pkg \"10.13.6_incremental_update.pkg\" -target /Volumes/OUR_HIGH_SIERRA_DISK_MOUNT_POINT\nBEFORE YOU TYPE THIS COMMAND, some additional explanations:\n\n\n*\n\n*We should launch this 'installer' command with \"sudo\" but, as booting from Recovery and launching Terminal already makes us root, there will be \"no need for sudo\".\n\n*-allowUnstrusted parameter is probably not needed (as the .pkg file is an Apple official package).\n\n*The name of the .pkg file I typed above is invented, just type whatever name your .pkg file has. Spaces are important, so let's type the .pkg file name BETWEEN QUOTES just in case.\n\n*The \"target\" will be the disk where our working High Sierra installation lives, typically a mount point under the Volumes folder. DOUBLE CHECK THE NAME OF YOUR WORKING HIGH SIERRA MOUNT POINT, typically it is \"Macintosh HD\", but you might have changed it...\n\n\nAgain, we will finally double check on screen all the parameters of this command are as expected.\nThen we'll run it, pressing enter.\nOnce the long 'installer...........' command starts running, a text mode installation will start.

The problem is when I plug in any charger the lighting symbol does not show up until I unplug the charger. My phone is old and I have had battery life problems before, please help.\n\nA: When troubleshooting charging issues, I would do the following (in order):\nAlways try another Lightning cable and charger, preferably Apple original or MFi certified units.\nThe [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_(connector)|Lightning cable 8-pin connector] should be sitting flush with the housing and completely inserted. If it is not, there could be lint/dust/debris inside the port impeding a proper connection. You can clean it out with fine point tweezers or a dental pick. Just be careful not to damage the pins inside the Lightning Port.\nChange the battery. The battery is the weakest link in the entire phone and certainly for charger related issues. It is also the easiest thing to replace. Use a battery utility, such as coconutBattery (for Mac) or 3uTools (for Windows) to test the battery prior to removal if you can get the phone to boot properly. Anything less than 70% of design capacity will require replacement.\nIf the battery is in good condition, you can use a [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=USB+Ammeter|USB Ammeter] to determine if the phone is really drawing current when it says it's charging.

Tried to fix it but there was a problem with the internal circuits if I remember well. I thought about selling the iPhone to people that want parts of it (e.g. screen) but I was doubting if they could somehow reach private information that was in the iPhone.\n\nA: The reality is that anyone who repairs the phone, and in this case it sounds like it has a logic board issue, will have full access to the phone if it wasn't protected by a passcode. A lot of micro-soldering repairs can be surprisingly straightforward.\nIn practice however, an iPhone 5 doesn't have much value as a phone so it will most likely serve as a donor device for repairing other phones.

I here's what I have so far. I'm not using full code, just dragging launch applications to places in the application \nI believe that the only things that I need to add would be code in between the launch applications that opens a new desktop and switches to it(2 times to create the empty space in desktop 2). I'm not entirely sure how to do this though.\n\nA: We figured out in comments that although this isn't a solution to the actual problem posted, it did help the OP to achieve the underlying requirement.\nFirst job is to create sufficient Spaces. You can do this in Mission Control, by default  Ctrl ⌃   ↑  or three-finger swipe up.\nUse the + on the right to create the required number - I have 7 here...\n\nThen set up some key commands - long-term these are the best way to get around.\nThis is set in System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control [You can only see as many 'Switch' shortcuts as you have Spaces.]\nIt will remember which app you last had frontmost when you switch Spaces in this way.  \nNote - if you have an extended keyboard with a 10-key, by default the Ctrl/num shortcuts are set to the 'qwerty' numbers, not the 10-key numbers & you will have to change the shortcuts manually if you prefer the 10-key.\n[The shortcuts are visually identical, but the number keys are recognised as distinct entities in this control panel.]\n\nThen it's a case of populating your Spaces with specific Apps.\nIf you've never done this before then any app will launch on whichever Space you're on right now; so switch to Space 3 & launch Chrome.\nThen right click it in the Dock & set to This Desktop.\n[btw, Apple seem to use the terms Space & Desktop interchangeably. I've never figured out the pattern.]\n\nNow just rinse & repeat for each app you want to assign to a given Space, after which you can flit between them all with a simple key command.\nPro Tips\nIf I ever need, for instance, to add an email attachment from Finder (Space 1) to an email (Space 4) then simply grabbing the header bar of the email & hitting  Ctrl ⌃   1  will move that single email to Space 1, where I can drop in the attachment from Finder.\nIf you ever need an app to 'follow' you around - sometimes I keep Activity Monitor tucked in a convenient corner - then assigning to All Desktops will make it always appear, whichever Space you're in.\nTwo things to watch out for... Mission Control prefs\n\nAutomatically rearrange Spaces - no no no. This will lose your carefully placed numbering & shift things around seemingly at random.\nDisplays have separate Spaces - If you have more than one physical monitor, then this one is a choice.\nPersonally, I avoid this one as I like my Spaces to move around in pairs, left & right always the same 'set'. If you want each monitor to be independent, then many people find this a useful way to be able to work in 2 different Spaces simultaneously. To do this you must have more Spaces than monitors.\n", "Q: MathJax on iPad I would like to be able to write HTML mathematics documents on my iPad without internet.\nOn my MacBook I use MathJax and it is excellent (using LaTex).\n\nA: The free app MathMagic Lite for iOS by InfoLogic may be helpful.

Below is what you entered.\nsudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 400G FAT32 BOOTCAMP 100G\n\nWhat you should have entered is given below.\nsudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 400G FAT32 BOOTCAMP 0\n\nBasically, you should let the command determine the size of the BOOTCAMP partition.\nIf you can not get a 100GB BOOTCAMP partition after reinstalling macOS completely, then how about creating the partition before reinstalling. In other words, enter the command below to destroy everything and create the correct partitioning before reinstalling macOS. \nsudo diskutil partitiondisk disk0 2 gpt apfs Main 400G fat32 BOOTCAMP R\n\nAgain, the above command will determine the size of the BOOTCAMP partition.\nOne final note: \nIt appears you are trying to install Windows without a Recovery partition. If so, the the recovery files will be placed inside of the BOOTCAMP partition. This is not how Windows is normally installed for an EFI boot. Also, you have not allocated a System Reserved partition. Although, the Boot Camp Assistant does not allocate for a System Reserved partition either and Windows seems to operate correctly on Macs without one. \n", "Q: Why does Spotlight think \"CHROM\" matches Chrome, but \"CHROME\" matches Calendar? This behavior has been consistent for months, maybe even years at this point, and I finally decided to make a screen recording of it just to have some verification that it's really happening.  The steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command-space to open Spotlight search.\n\n*Type the letters C, H, R, O, M, E in order with pauses.\n\n*For CH, CHR, CHRO, and CHROM Spotlight thinks the best match is Google Chrome...\n\n*But as soon as I add the final E, Spotlight thinks the best match is Calendar.\n\n*Delete the final E and Chrome comes back to the top of the list...\n\n*Re-type the E, and it's Calendar again.\n\n\nVideo evidence:  https://youtu.be/nkWuhXLrN1I\nI just can't think of any rational text matching/lookup system in which this behavior makes sense.  What on Earth is Spotlight doing?\n\nA: It is possible the Spotlight index has gone wonky and needs a rebuild. You should follow these instructions, extracted verbatim from this Apple Support document, and reindex the Macintosh HD volume:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple menu () > System Preferences, then click Spotlight.\n\n*Click the Privacy tab.\n\n*Drag the folder or disk that you want to index again to the list of locations that Spotlight is prevented from searching. Or click the Add (+) button and select the folder or disk to add.\nTo add an item to the Privacy tab, you must have ownership permissions for that item. To learn about permissions, choose Help from the Finder menu bar, then search for “permissions.”\n\n*From the same list of locations, select the folder or disk that you just added. Then click the Remove (–) button to remove it from the list.\nQuit System Preferences. Spotlight will reindex the contents of the folder or disk.\n\n", "Q: USB storage not detected anymore I have a USB key that was working and now cannot be mounted anymore.

I think it's not working since I have disconnected without eject during a transfer but I'm not sure about that.\n\nA: In short, it's time to throw it away & get a new one.\nIf a USB key encounters a write error, then it will attempt to lock the device into read-only mode. If it tried to do this as power was being removed it may have failed to complete that task & be left in an uncertain state.\nThis is, to all intents & purposes, irreversible.\nThe solution is to discard it & copy your data to a new USB key.\nIf for any inconceivable reason it was the only copy of that data, then your recourse would be to a specialist recovery company.\nThe same applies to such as SD cards, as well as USB flash drives.\nOnce they start to go bad, they are not worth the effort of fighting them to try squeeze a little more life out of them.\nDiscard & replace.\n", "Q: Is it possible to boot into a Windows bootcamp partition in Target Disk Mode? I have a 2013 MacBook Pro Retina with both macOS and Windows 10 installed on the internal SSD. I regularly put my MacBook into Target Disk Mode and boot into the macOS partition via a 2015 iMac.\nMy question is, is it possible to boot into the Windows partition via the same method - by putting my MacBook into Target Disk Mode and booting into the Windows partition via the iMac?\nThings I've tried:\nWhen I hold alt on boot to access the Startup Manager on the iMac, I do not see the Windows partition as an available boot disk.\nI have attempted to boot into the MacBook macOS partition via the iMac, and then change the startup disk via the Settings panel and restart. This seemed to work, and I was able to boot into Windows and see the Windows 10 loading wheel, but I was then presented with the Windows error 'INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE', which I can't seem to get past.\nAny advice would be very much appreciated.\n\nA: Let me try to explain what is happening.\nThe MacBook Pro is put in Target disk mode. At this point, the MacBook Pro is running software (firmware) stored on the logic board. This software is provided by Apple.\nThe iMac boots. At this point,  the iMac is also running software (firmware) stored on the logic board. This software is also provided by Apple.\nThe iMac recognizes the MacBook Pro as an external drive and determines the default operating system to boot is on this drive.\nThe iMac reads the necessary file from the hidden EFI partition on the MacBook Pro. This file is loaded into the memory on the iMac and executed. This file is provided by Microsoft.\nThe executing program from Microsoft now running on the iMac has no idea what Target disk mode is and no idea how to communicate with the MacBook Pro using the cable connecting the two computers together.\nSo you may see Windows start to boot but in the end Windows can not read additional files from the MacBook Pro.\nThere is no solution to this problem, but even if there was, Window still would fail to boot. Windows is licenced on a per computer basis. So at some point later in the boot sequence, Windows would have determined the computer was an iMac instead of the MacBook Pro. Windows would then have produced an error message and halted.\n", "Q: Cannot shut down computer due to app not responding I have a 2012-ish MBP and I am using it to develop iOS apps using Xcode. This app stops responding relatively frequently, but usually I can just force quit it and open it again. However, this time I cannot Force Quit Xcode, although there is no 'dot' beneath it in the dock, right clicking the icon just shows the 'not responding' message. I have attached a screenshot.\n\nThis is preventing me from shutting down my computer. How can I fix this?\nI hope my description is clear enough to make this a good question.\n\nA: You can take one of the 2 approaches one-by-one:\n1) Command + Option + Escape brings up a window to force quit running apps.\n2) In Terminal window, get the process_id by running ps -a and execute kill -9 <process_id> for the matching process.\nIf this doesn't work, quit all the other apps you can, make one last backup to time machine or equivalent and then kill all your user processes. \nkill -9 -1\n\nYou can try the above several times by reopening terminal and as a last resort, pressing and holding the power button will force the system to a harder shutdown by pulling all power. \n\nA: If you don't mind using the Terminal.app, I would suggest trying:\nsudo shutdown -h now\n(-h is for 'halt')\nThat should shut the computer off as cleanly as possible, and is better than holding the power button down.\nIf you want to reboot instead of shutting down, try this instead:\nsudo shutdown -r now\nn.b. This assumes you have an administrator account. You will be asked to enter your login password when you use sudo. \n", "Q: Finding Mac mail sounds plist I have been trying on and off for a fair while to edit the default Mail.app system sounds from their defaults.

Granular control outside of that isn't possible via the GUI.  See screenshot.\nAs per here Changing New Mail Sound in macOS Sierra, you can copy custom sounds to ~/Library/Sounds and they will show up as an option to select in Mail preferences.\nOne could then programmatically use the defaults command  to select your custom sound via Terminal or script if you run the following command from within the folder \"~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences\":  \ndefaults write com.apple.mail NewMessagesSoundName -string filename\n\nwhere \"filename\" is the name of the file, without the extension, of what you copied to ~/Library/Sounds\n\n", "Q: How to save files to Google Drive in Finder?

With S.M.A.R.T its pretty much all or nothing...).\nIs there a clear standard recommendation for OSX compatible software to verify the health and integrity of HDs and SSDs?\n\nA: You do not want to use solely techniques/tools such as Disk Utility, SMART, etc. as they do not actually verify the integrity of the data.\nFor validation of archives, you'll want to store not only the data to the drive but also checksums of each part of the data. Periodically you'll then want to read in all the data from the drive, recalculate the checksum and check that it matches.\nThis is necessary because modern hard drives can often fail in a mode where everything seems to be working, but as soon as you try to read specific part of the hard drive - they fail. There's a large risk that you won't get an advance alert from SMART or programs like Disk Utility that check only the file system structure.\nTo generate and validate the checksums you can use software such as \"Checksum Folders\":\nhttp://www.nordcode.eu/checksum-folders/\nYou can also create your own solution by using commands in the Terminal. Open up the Terminal and issue the following:\n find /Volumes/MyDisk -type f -not -name “checksums.txt” -exec md5 ‘{}’ \\; > /Volumes/MyDisk/checksums.txt\n\nwhere \"MyDisk\" should be replaced with the name of your disk.\nThis generates a text file with the checksums of every file on the disk. Then to later validate the checksum, you run the same command, but redirect the output to \"checksums2.txt\".\nThen run:\ndiff /Volumes/MyDisk/checksums.txt /Volumes/MyDisk/checksums2.txt\n\nif you have any output from that command, it means that the checksums do not match.\n", "Q: External HDD (Apple_HFS) not recognised by Finder under Sierra 10.12.6 my external HDD (used for TM backups and some other stuff) suddenly stopped working with my MBP 2017 (Sierra 10.12.6).

If I made a mistake in a long line I was typing on the command line I would hold down the left arrow key and the cursor would quickly move along the line until I got to where the mistake was. That has stopped happening. Holding down the arrow key takes a second or more to move a single space. Continuing to hold it down is just too slow.

Before using this command, open the MiniTool application and confirm the free space is between the Apple_APFS and Microsoft Reserved partitions.\nsudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\nFrom the information you posted, I am guessing the free space will between the Microsoft Reserved and Microsoft Basic Data partitions. If this is the case, then you will first need to move the Microsoft Reserved partition partition to the end of the free space. Below is an outline of the steps to follow. \n\n\n*\n\n*The MiniTool can not move this partition. Instead you can make a copy of the partition.\n\n*The copy of the Microsoft Reserved partition will have the wrong partition type id.

Basically, this is bit 0x8000000000000000. Unfortunately, this can to be done using MiniTool. You will have to use the diskpart command from a Administrator Command Prompt window. \n\n*After exiting diskpart, you will need to reboot Windows.\n\n*Use the MiniTool to remove the original Microsoft Reserved partition.\n\n\nA final note:\nYou posted the following question.\n\nThat operation successfully executed and as you will see, container for APFS is at 190 GB now.

Four months ago I bought an external SATA case with USB-C compatibility so I can install my iMac OS there, did this because my iMac has built in HDD and was so slowww..\nWith the case I started using an ADATA 120GB SSD and everything worked like a charm for the past months, up to now...\nAs an extra fact I have to say 1 day ago I took the computer to another location (car trip) used like 12 hours and take it back to my office (of course I unplugged the SSD and plugged it back a couple of times), this was the first time EVER I unplugged the SSD case.\nToday I was working as usual and the computer suddenly turned off and showed a message like this:\n\nSo waited for the iMac to restart and continue working, the message appeared 3 times after 20 minutes aprox of working.\nThe fourth time the message appeared I tried to start up again and the OS didnt started.

Maybe the USB-C cable got damaged in the trip yesterday, or its just that the VANTEC case is not supporting this kind of usage, or even the SSD?\nI cant use the iMac with the OS running at the HDD, I've get used to SSD speeds both in my iMac and macbook so I would like to solve this problem fast cause iMac is my principal work station.\nThe drive enclosure is: VANTEC ENCLOSURE\nThe SSD is (120GB version): ADATA SSD \nIf I buy a brand new samsung external SSD, can I expect similar issues?\nThank you so much, I would love to hear what you think about all of this!\n\nA: If it worked fine for several months then I would suggest the case supports it. It's very possible that the control board inside the case or the cable is damaged.\nIf you have the technical know how, I would suggest placing the SSD inside the iMac. That way you also avoid the bottleneck of having to go over USB. There are plenty of online guides on how to do this.\nI have used several of the MacSales kits, all the iMacs are still running and it took me 30 minutes at most.\n\nA: There cold be several things causing this. However you will need to use the process of elimination in order to narrow down the root cause of this. Here are a few things you should try first.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try a new usb cable. Usb cables can go bad easily and defective\ncables can cause kernel panics and hardware issues on your mac. If\nusing a new usb cable does nothing, it may be a bigger issue\nincluding a possibly failing hard drive enclosure, or SSD hard drive\nitself.\n\n*To eliminate the possibility of a software issue (corrupt kernel extension, or start up apps, etc.), try using a Mac OS bootable install USB to completely reinstall Mac OS over the existing version on your SSD drive. But first, try repairing your hard drive in disk utility from the bootable usb installer screen. Then, in order to preserve your data, DO NOT format or erase your SSD in disk utility before hand. Just reinstall mac os over the existing software without making any modifications to the existing partitions.\n\n*Completely format your SSD using your Mac OS bootable install usb, and try reinstalling everything from scratch. Be sure to back up your files before doing this. Formatting your SSD will erase everything on it.\n\n*Report back here after trying these things.\n\n", "Q: Copy/Paste working inconsistently (El Capitan, Macbook Air) I'm using a MacBook Air from late 2010 or so, and I've recently noticed that my copy/paste abilities have become significantly reduced.

It paired with my mid 2011 MacBook Air running High Sierra straight away. However, when I try to pair it with my mid 2011 iMac (also running High Sierra) it just won't pair. \nIt occasionally recognises a new device, although the MacBook picked up immediately that it was an 'ergonomic keyboard,' when the iMac recognises it it identifies it as unknown device with a serial number 00-00-00-00-00. It then asked me to enter a code, I've tried the generic 0000 as well as 1234, and even 00-00-00-00-00, but it continually fails to connect.\nI've also tried - and failed- to use the 'set up a new keyboard' function in Bluetooth preferences.

Grateful for any help received.\n\nA: The issue was with the version of Bluetooth. The built-in version (2.0, I believe) wouldn't configure with the keyboard.\nI've since bought a Bluetooth 4.0 Dongle (cost about £12) and I can now use the keyboard. It's a bit of a faff, had to download a Bluetooth developer tool from Apple and I now have to manually switch from the internal Bluetooth to the dongle before I can use the keyboard.\nThanks for all your suggestions, though, and hopefully anyone facing the same issue now has a solution.\nKieron\n\nA: I have a 2017 Macbook pro that I had a very difficult time getting the Microsoft Surface keyboard to connect with.  It would pair, but not connect.  \nThe answer for me was to delete the com.apple.Bluetooth.plist file (found in Macintosh HD > Library > Preferences directory).\nI had a lot of previously paired devices (multiple keyboards, headphones, trackpads) and a relatively long list of devices.\nThe issue, as far as I can tell was that the keyboard was looking for Bluetooth resources high on the preferences list of paired devices.  Once the com.apple.Bluetooth.plist preferences file was deleted, a new one was created and I was able to pair the Microsoft Surface keyboard right away without any further issues.\nGreat keyboard btw.

The 2017 MacBook Pro uses either a 61W or 87W charger.  See:  Find the right power adapter and cable for your Mac notebook\nWhen selecting a charger, always go equal or bigger than what you need.  The wattage rating is the maximum that will will supply, not \"push\".  In other words, if your device needs less, it won't harm it.  However, if it needs more, there won't be any more to give.\n\nA: Your post only shows Power Consumption, nothing about charging.\nIt looks normal.\nTo actually see the Charging versus consumption go to\nApple (top left) >> About this Mac >> System Report >> Power\nwithout Charger it looks like this\nIt is a Negative number, saying the battery is been drained.\n\nWith Charge, it is a positive Number, means Battery is been Charged.\n\nHowever, if it remains Negative you have a problem with Charger or MagSafe adapter or even the Battery it self.\n", "Q: Mac Pro 5.1 2012 I am trying to install Windows via Boot Camp Assistant and get the following message:\n\nThe startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition.\n  The startup disk must be formatted as a single Mac OS Extended (Journaled) volume or already partitioned by Boot Camp Assistant for installing Windows.\n\nIn Disk Utility only one unpartitioned drive is displayed.\nIn Terminal, the output of distutil list is:\n/dev/disk0 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Install macOS High S... 90.9 GB    disk0s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS bup macpro              364.0 GB   disk0s3\n   4:                  Apple_HFS Untitled                544.7 GB   disk0s4\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            4.0 TB     disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3\n\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Crucial 500gb           499.2 GB   disk2s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk2s3\n\nDisk0 is used for TM backup. Disk1 is main HD, where Windows is to be installed. After Windows is installed I intend to format and clone disk2 from disk1 and install it in the Mac as the boot drive. I only installed HS and network settings on disk2 to confirm the partitions would be set up.\nThe question is, how do I merge/delete the partitions on disk1 to satisfy Boot Camp Assistant?\n\nA: Below is a response to your statement: \"If my Internal drive is not set up incorrectly, why is BCA preventing the install.\"\nApple does no officially support Windows 10 on your Mac, but Microsoft does. Say you first installed Windows 7 with Apple's Window Support Software. Now, if you upgraded to Windows 10, then Windows 10 would be using the Windows 7 drivers provided by Apple. So, there is no reason why you can not install Windows 10 with Apple's Windows Support Software written originally for Windows 7.\nBelow is an answer to the question: \"If my Internal drive is not set up incorrectly, why is BCA preventing the install?\"\nThe Boot Camp Assistant installs Windows at the end of a drive. This is physically impossible to do with your disk1. The sector numbers for your 4 TB drive are to large to be stored in a legacy MBR partition table used to BIOS boot Windows.\nFurthermore, you probably would have to remove disk0 in order to install Windows on your Mac. This requirement was published in early editions of the Boot Camp Installation & Setup Guide. For example, the paragraph below was taken from Boot Camp - Installation & Setup Guide (Mountain Lion)\nMar 14, 2013.\n\nIf you have a Mac Pro with more than one internal disk and you want to install\n  Boot Camp on a disk that isn’t in the first hard drive bay, remove the drives in the lower- numbered bays. You can reinstall the drives after you install Boot Camp.\n\nI do not think I understood the rest of the questions you posted in your latest comment.\nI would try installing Windows without using the Boot Camp Assistant. The first step would be to burn the Windows ISO file to a DVD. You will also need a flash drive for the Windows Support Software from Apple. You can omit the DVD and use the same flash drive to hold the Window ISO files, but this makes the installation procedure more complex.\n", "Q: Can't import photos from iPhone 6 to Mac I have taken a lot of photos on my iPhone. But when I connect it to my Mac, the photos do not show up in Preview. I can see the photos on the iPhone, but they are simply not recognised when I plug the iPhone to the Mac - any ideas?\n\nA: The photos on iPhone doesn't directly show up in Preview.app on your Mac after connecting. You will need to copy (via import or sync) them to your Mac to be able to see them in Preview.app.\nAfter connecting your iPhone to your Mac, launch Image Capture.app. You can find the app in Other folder in Launchpad, or simply search for it via Spotlight.\nOnce the app is launched, your iPhone is unlocked and both the iPhone and Mac have trusted each other, you should be able to see all the photos and videos in the Image Capture.app window.\nSimply select, drag and drop the photos from within Image Capture app onto a folder in Finder to copy them to your Mac.\n\nA: Ensure updates on both the phone and mac are compatible.

The base account was his, so in my contacts/settings/default account some years ago, I entered his Apple ID. Now, whilst my cloud syncs info entered on iMac and MacBook Air to my iPhone, it no longer syncs from the iPhone.\nMy husband's entries, meanwhile, sync to my iMac/MacBook Air, but not to my iPhone. Entries I make on my iPhone now go nowhere other than staying on the iPhone. I have tried changing the default account in my iPhone/contacts/settings to iCloud but that doesn't help. It feels as though a previous 'fetch and push' between the two IDs no longer functions via the iPhones.\nHow do I setup a system that achieves the desired result?\n\nA: This is one of the more challenging setups to get right.\nIt used to be that 3-way sync was a logistical nightmare, and you're looking to do at least a 5-way sync.\nThankfully, Apple and a few other companies have been dealing with this for a while and have mostly gotten the hang of it, but I will caution you before you commit fully that there are risks: One device may update the phone number for a contact and that might get reset by another device, a device may mess up the sync and lose contacts, then sync that loss across all devices (much less likely in the past 5 years, but still a chance), one device may need to be re-set up, and knowing the risks you may feel dread at the process, etc.\nWith that to the side: there is only 1 general way to do this, and a myriad of companies to choose.\nYou must use a central host for your contacts, with all devices talking directly to it.\nOf course, with Apple, this the iCloud account.\nThis could also be a Gmail account, or some other contact-hosting service. It could even be a generic MS Exchange server.\n\nGoing with the setup you've already detailed, it seems your best choice is to wipe accounts on the non-syncing iPhone and re-do them: starting with your own, making sure contact sync is OFF, then adding your husband's AppleID and making sure contact sync is ON.\nAny additional accounts need to have contact sync off to prevent problems in future.\nI would also suggest that you choose to wipe you phone's contacts before you add his AppleID, allowing his contact list to anchor in as the baseline.\n\nA: This is always a complicated question and the answer is usually a puzzle that boils down to a per/user-setup basis.\nBefore I can give you a proper answer, I'm going to need some clarification on your setup. I will need you to correct me and/or fill in the blanks on any assumptions I may make about your setup. \nCan you please elaborate on \n\nso in my contacts/settings/default account some years ago, I entered his Apple ID.\n\nWhere did you enter his apple ID?

How to do that?\n\nA: There are two options for iCloud Photo Library: 'Optimize disk usage' and 'Downlaod and keep originals'. Optimize disk will delete original photos from your device and keep only thumbnails to free up space, while 'Download and keep originals' will keep originals in iCloud and on your device. \nFrom what I know there is no easy way to delete photos from iCloud. If possible, the best option will be extending the iCloud storage.\nIf not, you can try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Photos on your device and tap on 'Download and keep orogonals'.\n\n*Leave your device charging overnight with a strong Wi-Fi connection to make sure that all photos are loaded (there is no progress bar for downloading original photos).\n\n*Delete photos from iCloud to free up additional space.\n\n\nBe aware that in this case you won't be able to use iCloud Photo Library as the storage will get full again. The only real optio is backing up photos to your computer (Image Capture on Mac or drag&drop with Explorer on Win), then delete photos from both device and iCloud.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: It all depends on your iCloud storage and your iPhone Storage most cases people will move content to eternal hard drive to save move in the cloud. here a link on how to move data from iCloud to external hard drive. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204055\nhope this work!\n", "Q: What is the most efficient and reliable method for transfering/copying a large number of files from one external hard drive to another? I have an NTFS external hard drive with ~300GB of data on it, and I'd like to be able to start writing to this drive without having to use any third-party software or other hacks/workarounds. I've recently purchased a second external hard drive, and so now that I finally have something that's large enough to hold all of the data from my old drive, I want to copy everything over to this new drive so that I can format the old drive to use a file system that my Macbook Pro is capable of writing to without having to use any extra tricks.\nMy instinct was to just copy all of the files from the old drive and paste them into the new drive, but I figured this would take a long time so I wanted to see if there was a more efficient way to do this. But then when I started looking into this, I found all this stuff about people using things like \"rsync\" or some different types of third-party software to transfer large amounts of data between drives, and people being worried about the transfer process failing midway through and leaving them with no easy way of figuring out where to start back up from, and all kinds of other stuff like this that made me feel anxious about this whole undertaking. \nNonetheless, I still haven't been able to come across any source that gives a definitive, bottom-line answer for what the \"best\" way to transfer large of amounts of data like this is, which is why I'm asking this question here now.\nEssentially, all I need to know is (i) Am I safe to just copy and paste all of the files from the old drive to the new drive through Finder?, and (ii) If I'm safe to copy and paste with finder, what method should I use to transfer all of these files?\nThe one promising method I did come across was to use the \"restore\" function in disk utility, but I'm not sure this will work here given that my source drive is NTFS, so it seems like restoring my new drive from the old drive would just leave me with the same problem of now not being able to write to my new drive. Is this correct?\n\nA: If you would like to copy drive A to drive B exactly you can do this with Disk Utility.\n\nWe will be using Disk Utility's restore function. Some background on the different between Restoring vs copy and pasting:\n\nThe Restore function in Disk Utility makes use of a block copy\nfunction that can speed up the copy process. It also makes an almost\nexact copy of the source device. When we say \"almost exact,\" we don't\nmean to imply that useful data may get left behind, because that's not\nthe case. What it means is that a block copy copies everything in a\ndata block from one device to the other. The results are almost an\nexact copy of the original. A file copy, on the other hand, copies\ndata file by file, and while the file data remains the same, the\nlocation of the file on the source and destination devices will likely\nbe very different.\nUsing a block copy is faster, but it does have some limits that affect\nwhen it can be used, the most important being that copying block by\nblock requires that both the source and destination devices be first\nunmounted from your Mac. This ensures that block data doesn't change\nduring the copy process. Don’t worry, though; you don’t have to do the\nunmounting. Disk Utility’s Restore function takes care of that for\nyou. But it does mean that neither the source nor the destination can\nbe in use when you use the Restore capabilities.\n\nSource: https://www.lifewire.com/use-disk-utility-to-clone-macs-drive-4042367\n\nInstructions\nfor copying all files from Device A to Device B\n\nWARNING: When you restore one volume to another, all the files on the destination volume are erased.

Or tell me if it would be saved by time machine at all??\n\nA: To retrieve the .pem file you need to locate your backup folder and traverse its directory tree, since it has the exact same structure as what your OS had when it was being backed up.\nSome files and directories might have a red sign in the bottom right of their thumbnail, which just means that you need to enable access rights, which can be done like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the file or directory with the red minus symbol.\n\n*Choose Get Info.\n\n*A new window will appear, make sure the bottom right lock is open (if closed, click on it).\n\n*Click on the + in the bottom left corner.\n\n*Another window will appear, find your account and double-click it.\n\n*Restore the bottom right lock to its former state (important for security).\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to change the system font to a monospaced font? Due to declining eyesight, monospaced fonts are way easier for me to read. Is there a way to switch the default font High Sierra uses out for one that's monospaced? If it's not supported natively, are there any 3rd party programs that can?\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no built-in way to change the system default font, there are, however, a couple of utilities that let you change the default system font or at least some of the system fonts. How well this will work with a monospaced font like Courier is anyone's guess, and mine would be probably not very well.\nYou can change the font back to something many thought was more readable than the current font. By changing it to Lucida Grande.\nThere is another utility called TinkerTool that lets you change the font for some of the macOS. I don't believe it will change everything but it likely worth the try.\nThose are all I know of, there may be others that work better but these should give you a good start.\n\nA: I think you can change the system font, but I don't know if that's a good idea. The OS may react in \"odd\" ways if, for example, a character it displays is missing from the font you've chosen. It might work perfectly - or it might not... all I'm saying is that I personally have no experience with it. And having no experience, I wouldn't do it unless I was dead-certain I had a way to restore the default. Other answers to your question may have this covered, so please feel free to ignore my paranoia :)  \nAll of that said, I actually do have an answer for you, but it uses the existing system font - just in a larger font size. Making that change is easy, and it's easy to remove the change if you don't like it, or want to try something else: \n\n\n*\n\n*Start (or click on) System Preferences, select the Displays tool, and select the Display tab. \n\n*Next to the Resolution option, select the Scaled radio button. Your dialog box should now look like this (at least on High Sierra 10.13.6):\n \n\n\n*Select one of the optional \"Larger Text\" options; you can try different sizes until you find the one that works best for you. \n\n\nHope that helps.

This may require a strange combination or a four character combo. YMMV\n\n\n\n\n\nNow when pressing the set key combo, the Applications Dock Tile will be clicked and you can then type one, two or three letters, as necessary together, to highlight the target app and then press Enter to open it.\n\nAnother approach is to setup a folder with aliases to just the core group of regularly used apps, adding it to the Dock and modifying the steps as appropriate. Or use the following example AppleScript code to create a dialog box that will appear mid-center screen to choose from:\nset myAppList to {\"Calculator\", \"Calendar\", \"Contacts\", \"Dictionary\", \"DVD Player\", \"Firefox\", \"Safari\"}\nchoose from list myAppList\nif (count result) > 0 then\n    set appToOpen to item 1 of result\n    do shell script \"open -a \" & quoted form of appToOpen\nend if\n\nJust change the app names in the myAppList list to the core group of regularly used apps. The apps shown are just to show what it would look like. BTW If you use this as an app, add an activate command before the choose from list command.\nYou can type one, two or three letters, as necessary together, to highlight the target app and then press Enter to open it. Or use down or up arrow or click and press Enter or click OK or double click the target. Lots of options. \n\n\nAs a side note, if you use a program like FastScripts, you only need to create the AppleScript code as a .scpt not an .app and can assigned the keyboard shortcut in the Preferences for FastScripts. None of the other instructions apply unless you want to do it all natively without the use of third-party software.\nNote that I am not affiliated with the developer of FastScripts, just a satisfied user.\n\nA: In direct respond to your Title\n\nHide Everything For Cmd+Space Spotlight Search but Applications\n\nThis will work if you type it in Spotlight\n\nApplication kind:App\n\nNow it only shows Applications sorted by most recent and frequently used.\n\nIf you then expand it with NOT, you can exclude apps you do not want to see\n\nApplication kind:app NOT Safari NOT Automator\n\nOf course you could Automate this, but that would be another question on how ?\n\nA: This is a great use case for a second tool to just launch applications. I would check out the free to use Launcher by a long term Apple developer - obdev.at\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html\nSince spotlight by design is one database only - why not let spotlight index everything and add a second tool that only indexes applications for quick launching. Two of the many benefits of Launchbar are it's way faster than spotlight in my use across dozens of computers and OS versions and that you can define custom shortcuts for specific apps and not have to depend on what spotlight thinks is the correct shortcut.\nAs a bonus, it also learns as you type to prioritize and learn the short cuts you mean over time. It's uncanny how well it works.\n", "Q: Save command line output to a file without any graphics or special characters I want to save the command line output data in a text file.

This is a follow-up to my previous question: Function keys stop working after a while in Mojave\nThe issue I had is that loginwindow kept freezing. In this Gist, the issue is explained in detail. The explanation can be found below.\nmacOS Mojave build >18A326g has a nasty issue.\n\nBasically, loginwindow likes threads. It's so passionate about threads that\nit will continue to collect threads endlessly. Now, the problem with such a\nprocess collecting so many threads is that, as the owner of all processes\nrunning under your account, if the process crashes, say goodbye to most of\nmacOS.\n\nWell, this is exactly what happens. loginwindow freezes at 4096 threads and\ncauses most of macOS to become unstable or unusable. For example, most of the\nmenu items under the apple menu become useless, such as About This Mac or the\nSleep/Restart/Shut Down options. Some of the function/media keys stop working\nas well, such as the brightness, keyboard backlight, and volume keys.\n\nI also believe the log out option gets disabled too, but I haven't tested it.\nHowever, if this is indeed the case, this means the only way to log out\nreliably is using this script with the --kill option, which finds and kills\nloginwindow for you.\n\nloginwindow does indeed collect 4096 threads and then freeze. Every time. In fact, I built a notifier using JXA to warn me when corruption (threads / 4096) reaches over 90%.\nThat's beside the point, however. As far as I can tell, nobody else has the issue (either that or they never figured out why).\nI've reported this issue to Apple 4 betas ago, but the issue's still here.\nHow do I figure out what's causing this issue? How do I prevent it?\n\nA: I've noticed the exact same hanging loginwindow issue since upgrading to Mojave 10.14.5. As @Dev and some of the other responses pointed out, there are some common applications which seem to contribute to this. Little Snitch is the culprit in my case and have found the following solutions work best as a workaround. My system is also configured for automatic login.\nThe immediate solution to fix the  hanging loginwindow is to ssh into the host which hangs and run this simple script (or one-liner) to stop loginwindow and then start it again using launchctl.\n#!/bin/sh\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.loginwindow\nsleep 2\nsudo launchctl start com.apple.loginwindow\n\nOR\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.loginwindow && sleep 2 && sudo launchctl start com.apple.loginwindow\n\nThe long-term workaround solution until Objective Development and/or Apple addresses this problematic behavior in their code is to instrument a launch daemon which executes a modified version of the above script at startup.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create script in /usr/local/bin named fixHang.sh\nsudo touch /usr/local/bin/fixHang.sh\n\n\n*Edit the script and paste in the content below.\nsudo nano /usr/local/bin/fixHang.sh\n\n#!/bin/sh\nlogFile=\"/Users/Michael/loginwindowdaemonscript.txt\"\necho \"------------BOOT BEGIN $(date)----------\"\nustart=$(date -j -f \"%a %b %d %T %Z %Y\" \"date\" \"+%s\")\ntimestamp=$(date)\nloginPIDChar=$(ps -ef | grep -v \"grep\" | grep \"/usr/libexec/UserEventAgent (Aqua)\" | awk $'{print $2}' | wc | awk $'{print $1}')\nloginPID=$(ps -ef | grep -v \"grep\" | grep \"/usr/libexec/UserEventAgent (Aqua)\" | awk $'{print $2}')\necho \"$(date) - START\" >> \"$logFile\"\necho \"$(date) - loginwindow PID: $loginPIDWindow\" >> \"$logFile\"\necho \"$(date) - UserEventAgentAqua PID: $loginPID\" >> \"$logFile\"\nwhile [ \"$loginPIDChar\" == \"0\" ];\ndo\n        echo \"$(date) - BEGIN LOOP\" >> \"$logFile\"\n        sleep 2\n        echo \"BEGIN CHECK\" >> \"$logFile\"\n        loginPIDChar=$(ps -ef | grep -v \"grep\" | grep \"/usr/libexec/UserEventAgent (Aqua)\" | awk $'{print $2}' | wc | awk $'{print $1}')\n        loginWindowPID=$(pgrep loginwindow)\n        echo \"$loginWindowPID\" >> \"$logFile\"\n        echo \"loginPIDChar = $loginPIDChar\" >> \"$logFile\"\n        if [ \"$loginPIDChar\" != 0 ];\n        then\n                timestamp=$(date)\n                loginWindowPID=$(pgrep loginwindow)\n                echo \"$timestamp - KILL PROCESS # $loginWindowPID\" >> \"$logFile\"\n                sudo kill -9 \"$loginWindowPID\"\n                sleep 5\n                echo \"$timestamp - BREAK LOOP\" >> \"$logFile\"\n                break\n        else\n                timestamp=$(date)\n                loginWindowPID=$(pgrep loginwindow)\n                echo \"$timestamp - PROCESS NUMBER: $loginWindowPID\" >> \"$logFile\"\n        fi\n        sleep 2\n        echo \"$(date) - END LOOP\" >> \"$logFile\"\ndone\nsleep 5\nnewloginWindowPID=$(pgrep loginwindow)\nuend=$(date -j -f \"%a %b %d %T %Z %Y\" \"date\" \"+%s\")\necho \"$(date) - fixDuration: $((uend - ustart)) seconds\" >> \"$logFile\"\necho \"$(date) - oldLoginWindowPID #: $loginWindowPID\" >> \"$logFile\"\necho \"$(date) - newLoginWindowPID #: $newloginWindowPID\" >> \"$logFile\"\necho \"------------BOOT COMPLETE $(date)----------\" >> \"$logFile\"\nSave out the file (Ctrl+O + [ENTER]) and exit nano (Ctrl+X + [ENTER])\n\n\n*Make script executable and change ownership to root:wheel\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fixHang.sh\nsudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin/fixHang.sh\n\n\n*Create a launch daemon in /Library/LaunchDaemons which when loaded will execute the fixHang.sh script on startup\nsudo touch /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.startup.fixhang.plist\nsudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.startup.fixhang.plist\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.startup.fixhang</string>\n    <key>LaunchOnlyOnce</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>LimitLoadToSessionType</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>Aqua</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>sh</string>\n        <string>-c</string>\n        <string>/usr/local/bin/fixHang.sh</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nSave out the file (Ctrl+O + ENTER) and exit nano (Ctrl+X + ENTER)\n\n\n*Change ownership of /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.startup.fixhang.plist to root:wheel\nsudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.startup.fixhang.plist\n\n\n*Load the launch daemon for execution at startup\nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.startup.fixhang.plist\n\n\nA: I know the StackExchange community tends to hate these kinds of answers, but I don't know exactly what fixed my issue.\nloginwindow is now ending threads correctly. That is to say, at some point it had less threads than before, and it's hovering around 2-3.\nI messed around with kexts and LaunchDaemons. I uninstalled certain things, like Karabiner Elements, and Camtasia's audio driver. I disabled certain startup items, like SIMBL. But I don't know exactly what fixed the issue.\nIf anyone else with this issue has any of this same software, I'd recommend trying to disable some in /Library/LaunchDaemons. (/Library/Extensions for kexts)\n\nA: SIMBL is a likely cause of your problems.  It was questionable back when it was popular. I'm surprised if it's even been properly updated to work on Mojave at this point.  \nOld audio drivers could be just as suspect, in addition to old kexts which are always potential suspects since Apple makes large changes in the system for these which they have done a lot these past few years for security and power savings.\n", "Q: Which path to upgrade from Mac OS X 10.6 (10A432)?

I have reseted SMC multiple times but to no avail. I am out of warranty period and I am afraid I will have to take it to Apple Service Centre.\n\nA: Your problem is essentially a thermal monitoring failure and in all likelihood your CPU and GPU will be working within their thermal limits (in fact they will probably be running cooler than usual thanks to you fan running at 100% PWM). While this can be caused by a failed sensor or SMC it can also be caused by power issues close to the SMBus (which is responsible for simple communication between various hardware components). Take a look at this Louis Rossman video where a very similar issue is diagnosed (spoiler alert, surprisingly it turns out to be a faulty FaceTime camera causing the fan speed issue)...\n2014 MacBook thermal monitoring failure with fans running at maximum speed\nThe precise nature of the fault is largely academic as Apple will simply replace the logic board rather than attempt a component-level repair. An independent such as Rossmann may well be able to diagnose the fault and repair it at a reasonable price, but the only free/DIY option is to install software to bring your fan speeds under control and live with it.\nIf you want to pay for a repair you will need to use a monitoring utility to give you an idea of whether it's a single or multiple sensor failure. I use HWSensors as it's free, works and gives comprehensive system information, but any of the other suggested utilities should give you the feedback you need. You'll definitely be wanting to check both CPU and GPU temperatures look to be within normal limits at idle, if either is obviously too high or low then the SMC will default to maximum fan speeds to ensure nothing cooks, regardless of whether it's actually cooking or not.\nMy choice of utility to bring fan speeds under control is Macs Fan Control, this allows you to define your reference sensor and is also well-suited for all iMac models with custom hard disk firmware which causes the system fans to run at full speed when a non-Apple drive is fitted. This is also arguably superior to the standard OS X thermal control in that it lets you set up a thermal plan to suit you rather than having to live with Apple's predefined thermal-acoustic balance. \nIf you want a simpler interface then SSD Fan Control may be more up your street.\n", "Q: Will Apple send payment after expiration of Developer program membership The minimum payment due in my account is $150.\nCurrently I have $120 proceeds in my account.

Apple has distributed malware through its AppStore, again.\nJust one example: The Price of Free Software: Trend Micro’s apps exfiltrate your browser history and Mac App Store apps are stealing user data\nThe official response from Apple was to wait quite a bit –– in effect so that more user data could be stolen.

Apple reviews each app before it’s accepted by the store, and if there’s ever a problem with an app, Apple can quickly remove it from the store. \n\nWell, \"safest\" except when it's not.\nAnd the above Apple quote only means that new 'infections' will not occur, once Apple does take action.\nHow does anyone respond to that in terms of actions to take?

Two of the three are unlikely to acknowledge your concerns:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple is unlikely to publicly talk about malware that got into the App Store.\n\n*Developers are unlikely to talk about the malware they got into the App Store.\n\n\nApp store markets currently rely on researchers and curious users discovering problems and raising awareness.\n\nA: You need to treat software from the App Store equally to any other third party software, you might want to install on your Mac. \nYes, Apple did some kind of light testing of the apps - but they aren't handing out guarantees that no malware or errors passes through their process. This is not at all different to how App Store on other platforms work.\nIf you discover a problem with the software, notify the maker of the software. If the problem is malicious in nature, inform Apple through the Mac App Store contact:\nhttp://www.apple.com/support/mac/app-store/contact.html?form=account\nDon't expect a fast turn-around or immediate take-down of apps from here.

If I create a document in Quark Xpress, can I 'link' / 'join' / what-else an external data source and simply use automatic repeatedd sections and placeholders so updating external source will allow an update in my xpress project?\nI do not want to simply import a table! \nFor example: I have a file with a list of name, surname, phones, address, etc...\nI'd like to tell xpress to insert a section with n repeated sections, and in each section place in the top left the surname, in the top right the phone, at center of second row the phone number, etc...\nI ask here because I never worked before with this software, and actually as developer I must create 'something' that can be used as 'datasource' to easily generate a document in quark xpress. . . \nI think it must be possibile, I simply do not understand how to create this kind of 'macro' or 'automatism' to use an external datasource.\nPlease, be patient with me, first posts here. Ask, and I'll try to update my question.\nIf this is NOT possible, an answer with a simple 'it's not possible' will be accepted.\n\nA: There are two ways to go about this. You can either get commercial QuarkXPress XTension software that handles database publishing or you can attempt to write your own AppleScript that talks to some external data source and builds elements in a QuarkXPress document.\nI haven't used commercial database publishing software, I just know they exist. So I can't help much beyond suggesting to search for \"Quark database publishing\" and looking around. I would imagine that this type of solution would support more different types of databases and would be easier to implement. This would also probably be a little expensive.\nThe second option - AppleScript - can be difficult, as whoever is implementing this would need to have access to and be familiar with QuarkXPress and AppleScript. I don't think you can even start to develop an AppleScript for an application that isn't installed on your computer.\nYou would also need to find a way to talk to your database using AppleScript, which might limit the kinds of databases you could use. I've mostly created scripts that used delimited text exports from databases as a starting point, which may not be enough for you.\nWriting an AppleScript can be painstaking work, as the documentation is hard to follow and finding the right syntax to accomplish something is often just trying different things until you find something that works. But, you might not need to spend any money at all, especially if you can work from delimited text exports.\nTelling you how to write an AppleScript is a little beyond the scope of a StackExchange answer, but searching for \"Quark AppleScript\" should at least get you started. There are also normally example AppleScripts installed with Quark, I think in the application's folder.\n", "Q: Slow write speeds with APFS encryped external SSD I bought an external SSD with a USB 3.1 gen 2 enclosure. I'm on macOS 10.13.6 with a MBP (late 2013).\nUsing APFS I get write speeds of around 390–405 MB/s. So far, so good.\nHowever formatting the drive to APFS (encrypted) results in way slower write speeds of around 250–260 MB/s.\nIs such a performance loss of nearly 40% normal for an encrypted drive, or am I doing something wrong?\nI used a 10GB test file and cp to measure the performance. Copying through Finder results in similar performance.\n\nA: According to these benchmarks performances found here on APFS, APFS encrypted, HFS and HFS+ encrypted, your loss of nearly 40% may be surprising as you are writing and not reading.\nTesting environment summary :\nHardware : 2017 MacBook Pro, 16 GB 2133 RAM \nOS : macOS 10.13 High Sierra\n\nHave you encrypted your already APFS formatted SSD to an APFS encrypted or have you completely reformated your APFS drive to an APFS encrypted ? \nIf you didn't reformat before your second performance speed test, this may be a cause. \nFinally, if you did completely reformat your hard drive, this answer may be interesting :\nExtremely slow write speed to encrypted external drive on Mavericks\n\n\nA: The problem still exists with a MacBook Pro 2020 running macOS BigSur.\nI am using a 2 TB SSD with an USB 3.1 enclosure. The SSD manufacture (Crucial) mentions read / write speeds from 560/510 MB/s in their product information. Tested with several cables and on different ports.\nGet around 400/450 MB/s with APFS:\n\nGet around 200 MB/s with APFS encrypted:\n\nThats a ~ 50 % difference!\nAfter talking with the Apple Care support they told me that encrypted file formats shouldn't have a huge effect on read / write speed (but as we can see, they do have an effect). They solved a similar problem with another customer by changing the format to the old Mac OS Extended (Journaled) one. They have also advised me to ask the SSD manufacture for additional information and help.\n\nA: Up to 40% drop is reasonable with the all the overhead of the encryption, it's not for free. However I have found out with the M1 airbook it is also drive dependant.\nM1 airbook with a verified dongle (can push 100+ MB):\nTranscend 1TB: unencryped 100-110 MB/s, encrypted: 40-70 MB/s\nSeagate 5TB: unencryped 100-110 MB/s, encrypted: 15-20 MB/s\n\n2015 macbook pro (without dongle):\nTranscend 1TB: unencryped 100-110 MB/s, encrypted: 60-80 MB/s\nSeagate 5TB: unencryped 100-110 MB/s, encrypted: 60-80 MB/s\n\nAs you can see the 2015 macbook trashes the M1 airbook here, but encryption is the key here, because if i create an unencrypted APFS volume, it's pushing 100-110 MB/s.\nI noticed storagekitd using a lot of cpu on M1.\nAnd I also managed to kernel panic M1 big sur just by connecting an external hard drive with Suspected bundle: com.apple.iokit.IOUSBHostFamily.\nThis panic has big chance of happening whenever the notebook goes to sleep too:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/252421595\nUSB is very raw on M1.

definitely thinking you may have a gpu that's starting to go bad or become defective. \n\nA: So it’s getting repaired for free under ECLC even though 5 and a half years old!, happy days!\nHere’s the report:\nIssue replicated, running diagnostics\nMRI failed on battery \nBattery test failed \nVST failed\nDevice needs a new logic board and a top case with battery under ECLC\n\nA: There are a couple more basic things that you can try. \nFirst, create a bootable usb of mac os on another computer using createinstallmedia commands in terminal.  You can find thos instructions here\nThen insert your bootable usb of mac OS and hold down the control key until you get to a boot screen. Select your usb key \"install mac os high sierra\" on the boot screen, and hit enter. See if it loads to the installation screen. If it does, try reinstalling to the same drive without re-partitioning or formatting your drive. As long as you dont format, none of your personal data will be lost. You will just be reinstalling the core OS. Once installed, boot back up and see if your screen is fixed. If not, then it most likely is a hardware problem and not a software problem. Could be a faulty graphics card or something. But try reinstalling mac os forst and let me know how that goes.\n", "Q: MacBook: woke up to an empty battery, how to get battery history? On Sunday I purchased a brand new MacBook Pro 13\" w/TouchBar. I used it a little last night and put it in my backpack with 75% battery life. I shut the lid and assumed the MacBook was sleeping when I put it in my backpack. Unfortunately when I got to school this morning the battery was completely dead. Since I wonder what happened to the 75% battery I had left and am very concerned damage from overheating might happen with it running in a backpack. I checked Console / sys logs and nothing jumps out.\nIs there anyway to see the historical battery life to find out if the laptop was left on overnight? \n\nA: Open activity monitor and select energy. It might take a while to crunch the logs, but that should show you some recent history for 12 hours of activity.\nI think it offered more time in the past if you were sleeping, but now it seems to only show you a 12 hour clock window.\n\nThe command line tool pmset -g log should dump a much more detailed and verbose log of history going back further than 12 hours. You will probably want to process that - perhaps printing only the lines that match the string Charge and then paging the results.\npmset -g log | grep -w Charge | more\npmset -g log | grep -w Summary- | more\n\nOnce you see if it slept and how the charge went down, I wouldn't worry about it running hot while closed. I run Mac at high CPU/GPU while closed clamshell all the time (most of the day) and have never had any issues with longevity in practice or overheating - the CPU throttles down when the blowers or heat can't escape due to a blockage or insulation to stay within safe temperature ranges.\n", "Q: How to fix my corrupted APFS container? I'm using MBP late 11 running 10.13.2 on Samsung Evo 850 250GB internally.\nEverything was fine for months but few days ago something horrible occurred. I'm so shocked and urgently need your help.\nFinder wasn't responding and I had to restart it by force. But it didn't boot again and just showed a black screen.

Done.\n\nA: Here is how I fixed some corrupted internal APFS SSD system drives for a Mac mini and macBook Pro running Ventura 13.2.\nCaution: This information may or may not apply to (or resolve) your situation. Use as your own risk.\nFirst, make sure that a reliable and complete backup has been made of the computer.  I used Carbon Copy Cloner 6. However, Time Machine (and perhaps SuperDuper!) should work as alternatives.\nDisk Utility \"First Aid\"\n\n*\n\n*Run Disk Utility \"First Aid\" in a normal running configuration.\n\nNote: This did not fix either of my cases. However, it did find and list the issues present.\nDisk Utility \"First Aid\" in Recovery Mode\n\n*\n\n*Boot the machine in Recovery Mode.\n\n*\n\n*cmd-R while booting a Mac mini\n\n*continue holding the power button while booting a MacBook.\n\n\n\n*Run Disk Utility \"First Aid\".\n\nNote: In my case, this resolved the issue for one machine, but not the other.\nCreate Bootable Full-Image Recovery Drive\nNote: I found this process to work with a quality external USB-C SSD drive formatted to the APFS file system.\n\n*\n\n*Make an image backup of the system to an external APFS USB-C SSD drive. (Carbon Copy Cloner)\n\n*Make the back drive bootable by running the official Apple Venture installer on the image backup just created.

I can get it downloaded onto the flash drive but when I play it back it is really slow and laggy and doesnt really work? does anyone know why this is?\n\nA: Without all the details of your hardware (both the Mac and flash drive), the most likely cause is the transfer speed available from the flash drive to your Mac. \nIn this scenario you typically wouldn't opt to play the video from a flash drive, but rather just use the flash drive to transfer the video onto another device (such as your cousin's computer).\nYou should find that playing the video directly from a computer's internal drive, or from any modern external drive, should be fine. Note that by external drive I'm not referring to flash drives, but external HDDs or SSDs.\nBy way of a similar example, I recently had to produce an 8 minute video in FCP that needed to be viewable on a MS Surface device. It played fine on my Mac and fine on the Surface, but trying to play it from their 32GB flash drive resulted in a bad experience!\n", "Q: Save attachments from Mail.app based on subject issues What I am trying to do: I have to scan some personal writing that I do for my mentor to review, I have 3 types of writing J,F,W.

Is that possible? Or something close?\nUpdate with additional explanation: Ctrl-k is by default in Terminal \"delete to end of line\". As well as deleting it puts the deleted text into the Terminal's clipboard (emacs \"kill ring\") and it can be retrieved with Ctrl-y. This is essentially a second clipboard separate from the system clipboard. I want to use the same clipboard for Terminal and for the rest of the system such as my text editor.\n\nA: There's a very simple solution if you're willing to extend your shell's functionality.  (Though it is pretty cool to see the automator solution)\nAssuming you're using zsh, the current macOS default shell, then just add this to your ~/.zshrc profile.\npb-kill-line () {\n  zle kill-line   # `kill-line` is the default ctrl+k binding\n  echo -n $CUTBUFFER | pbcopy\n}\n\nzle -N pb-kill-line  # register our new function\n\nbindkey '^K' pb-kill-line  # change the ctrl+k binding to use our new function\n\nAll this is doing is wrapping the Ctrl+k key binding so that in addition to performing its default behavior (kill-line), it also copies the relevant text into the system wide clipboard. The mysterious $CUTBUFFER contains the text that was just cut, and the macOS pbcopy utility puts whatever it receives from the STDIN into the system clipboard.\nThis solution was mostly just copied from https://gist.github.com/welldan97/5127861 ! My only original content is the explanation. :-)\n\nA: I do not believe what you're asking is going to be easily doable. I believe the secondary cut and paste functions are isolated in each app that supports them and it would probably require programmatically trapping the target key sequence and processing accordingly. This is something that would probably need to be written in C and or Objective-C, compiled to executable and stay memory resident.\nThat said though, I believe that the ^K shortcut only cuts the last line of text from the position of the cursor and places it on the secondary pasteboard. So with that as the understanding, let me offer the following as a workaround solution.\nThe following example AppleScript code, shown further below, will be used in an Automator service, where one can then assigned a keyboard shortcut to the service. This service will use e.g. ⌃⇧K (Control-Shift-K) and achieve the goal of the OP. Which is to get what is placed on the secondary pasteboard in Terminal, by normally pressing ⌃K, onto the general system pasteboard a.k.a. the Clipboard, albeit with pressing e.g. ⌃⇧K instead.\nThe following was created, tested and works for me in macOS High Sierra.\n\nCreate the Automator service...\nIn Automator:\n\n\n*\n\n*File > New, or press: ⌘N\n\n*Select Service and click the Choose button.\n\n*Configure the settings as shown in the first image below.\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action.\n\n*Replace the default code with the example AppleScript code.\n\n*Save as e.g.: My Ctrl-K for Terminal\n\n\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    if (count windows) is greater than 0 then\n        try\n            activate\n            set c1 to contents of selected tab of front window\n            tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n                keystroke \"k\" using control down\n            delay 0.5\n            set c2 to contents of selected tab of front window\n        end try\n    else\n        return\n    end if\nend tell\n\ntell current application\n    set pCount to (count paragraphs of text of c1)\n    repeat with i from 1 to pCount\n        if (count characters of (paragraph i of c1)) is greater than 0 then\n            set t1 to (paragraph i of c1)\n            set t2 to (paragraph i of c2)\n        end if\n    end repeat\n\n    if (count characters of t1) is not equal to (count characters of t2) then\n        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {t2}\n        set CtrlY to text items of t1\n        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {}\n        set the clipboard to CtrlY as text\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any other error handling then what may be present. The onus is always upon the user to employ proper error handling as necessary and or wanted.\n\n*The value of the delay command may or may not need to be adjusted for your system. Adjust the value as may be needed and or add additional delay commands as may be needed.\n\n\n\nAssigning the keyboard shortcut...\nIn System Preferences...\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services add ⌃⇧K (press Control-Shift-K) to the My Ctrl-K for Terminal service, as shown in the image below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: A word about the shortcut you assign... ⌃⇧K is offered as a suggestion however, you'll need to select one that doesn't conflict with Terminal (or any other app that has focus if setting the service to any application) when pressed. This may require a strange combination or a four character combo. ⌃⇧K worked fo me in Terminal. YMMV\n\n\n\n\n\nNow in Terminal, when one presses ⌃⇧K you'll get on the Clipboard that which ⌃K places on the secondary pasteboard.\n\nAs a side note, if you use a program like FastScripts, you only need to use the example AppleScript code as a .scpt in Script Editor, not create an Automator service and can assigned the keyboard shortcut in the Preferences for FastScripts. None of the other instructions apply unless you want to do it all natively without the use of third-party software.\nNote that I am not affiliated with the developer of FastScripts, just a satisfied user.\n", "Q: How do I jailbreak an iPhone or iPad?

Is there a way to speed this up?\nI have observed that if I perform a 2 finder click, the context menu appears fast against tapping with 2 fingers where it is slow to react.\nHere are the specs on my machine:\n\n\nA: A delayed reaction to a two-finger tap on a trackpad is caused by MacOS waiting to see if you are going to do a single two-finger tap or a double two-finger tap. Essentially, it thinks you might do another two-finger tap and it doesn't want to show the menu when you might be in the middle of a different gesture.\nTo speed it up, go to System Preferences > Trackpad > Scroll & Zoom and uncheck \"Smart zoom.\" This will disable a feature that lets you zoom in on a specific thing (like a paragraph on a webpage) with a double two-finger tap.\nOtherwise, if you want to keep Smart zoom enabled, you can wait the second for the context menu to appear with a two-finger tap, or you can do a two-finger click to make it faster.\nAs a side note, a similar thing happens on iOS devices. If you have an accessibility shortcut triggered by a triple-press of the home button, then double-pressing the home button is slower to bring up the app switcher.

Note: you may need a blank double layer (DL) DVD.\nIf you which to continue with a flash drive install of Windows, then you will need to follow the accepted answer to the question: How to install Windows 10 into a 2011 iMac without using the Boot Camp Assistant, an optical (DVD) drive or third party tools?\nAdditional Notes\nThe  Windows installation media can be stored on a DVD, flash drive or an internal drive. When viewed from the Startup Manager you will see an icon labeled Windows and/or an icon labeled EFI BOOT. Should  should select Windows to BIOS boot the Widows installation media. Choosing EFI Boot obviously EFI boots the media. \nThere a two partition tables stored on the internal drive. The first table is the legacy Master Boot Record (MBR) table. Any partition information stored in this table is only used by most BIOS booting operating systems. The second table is the GUID Partition Table (GPT). This table can be used by both BIOS and EFI (UEFI) booting operating systems. (Although, a BIOS booting operating system using the GPT rarely occurs.) When both partition tables are used to store partition information on the same drive the partitioning is referred to a hybrid.\nThe macOS (OS X) operating system EFI boots and uses the GPT. A BIOS booting Windows uses the MBR table, so the partitioning must be hybrid. An EFI booting Windows uses the GPT, so no partition information can be stored in the MBR table. Actually, in this case the MBR table contains a single partition spanning the entire drive (up to 2 TB) and the MBR table is then referred to protective.\nYour Mac need to install a BIOS booting Windows. Therefore the internal drive needs to be hybrid partitioned. If you get a message that the internal drive is GPT partitioned, then you have to either employ the solution to How to convert a drive from the GPT format to the hybrid GPT/MBR format when using High Sierra (macOS 10.13.2) or use the h function from the recovery and transformation menu of the third party gdisk command.\nSteps to use gdisk to create hybrid partitioning.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download gdisk\n\n*Disable Systems Integrity Protection (SIP)\n\n*Enter the command given below.\nsudo gdisk /dev/disk0\n\n\n*Enter the following into gdisk.\nr\nh\n2 3 4\ny\naf\nn\nab\nn\n07\ny\nw\ny\n\n\n*Enable SIP.\nExample output from using gdisk:\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.4\n\nWarning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their\npartition table automatically reloaded!\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: protective\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: present\n\nFound valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.\n\nCommand (? for help): r\n\nRecovery/transformation command (? for help): h\n\nWARNING!

I have a software package that is authorised to all users through a encrypted licence file. The software splash screen displays the name of the IT manager on start up.\nI am authorised to use this but would prefer not to display the registered name each time it starts.\n\nA: There is no generic way to hide such a name as the implementation of such a splash screen differs from app to app.\nDisplaying the license holder’s is usually part of the protection features of the software. Therefore you’re not likely to find an official way of hiding the name.\nHiding the name is usually something wanted by those that do not have a license and don’t want others to see that. If you’re in that category, contact the vendor to see about transferring the old license or buying (possibly at a discount) another seat or license of the software.\n", "Q: Random folders are considered apps Recently I had switched over to a mac and pulled over my project from git that I was working on in linux environment.

In reality, as you have seen, they are just a directory. If you right click and click \"Show Package Contents\" you will open the directory as a normal folder.\nMost of the time the extension is hidden. This can be changed in File > Get Info >  Hide Extension.\nI would suggest changing the extensions.

This risk seems to be why the PS only turns on full power after it senses 40 kOhm across the power pins for 1 s. Is there a risk of shorting the pins when the plug is not properly seated? In that case I'd apply power after nicely seating the plug.\n\nA: \nIs it safe (1) to omit the initial high impedance 6 V or 3 V and\n  simply apply \"14,5V to 18,5V on Magsafe 1 and up to 20V on Magsafe 2\"?\n  Do I have to match the voltage of the power supply reported by the\n  cable connector (16.5 V)?\n\nThe \"initial high impedance 6V or 3V\" is handled by the power supply that sends the 3/6V until it detects a \"power line low\" condition (the MagSafe is connected) at which point it sends the full 16-20V DC\nDo you need this initial 3/6V?  No.  What you need to do is supply clean, stable 16-20V DC to the MagSafe cable (shielding to negative, white inner to positive) because that's what's required to power your Mac.  \n\nThis risk seems to be why the PS only turns on full power after it senses 40 kOhm across the power pins for 1 s.  Is there a risk of shorting the pins when the plug is not properly seated? In that case I'd apply power after nicely seating the plug.\n\nYes, there's a risk - a low one.  It's extremely difficult to short the pins on a MagSafe connector.  I'm not saying it's impossible, but the design makes it so it's extremely difficult to do so.  However, if you do short the points, the damage will most likely be minimal (you'll blow the MagSafe DC-In board and not the whole logic board), but in my experience, it's not worth it.\nWhat I have done is connect a MagSafe to a switched AC adapter \"wall wart\" that supplied 18V at 3A to my MagSafe and powered my \"benchtop\" MagSafe diagnostic power supply.  I did it this way so I could insert a multi meter in line so I could measure amperage draw.  I've never shorted pins and this worked great.\nStandard disclaimer:  Don't try this at home.

I observe that network traffic for applications seems to be blocked, or perhaps queued, when the screen is locked, on my MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4 Mac Mini.\nThe most obvious example I have seen: when running the native MacOS Spotify client, and unlocking the screen after being away for a few days, the client becomes animated - it shows every song I've played on other clients while I've been away from the Mac console, at a high rate, flipping from one to the next, one per second, or so.\nThis leads me to guess that the Mac caches that traffic, until the screen is unlocked? \nWhat is happening, here?  \nHow can I disable this behavior, and allow the apps I'm running to get network traffic when the screen is locked?\n\nA: You are confusing \"network traffic filtering\" with Application \"synchronization.\"\nWhen your Mac goes to sleep, it suspends all other applications from execution.  Meaning, your Spotify client doesn't get updated.  When you use your Spotify client on your mobile device, for example, the Spotify service (in the cloud) remembers all of that activity.  When you wake your client, it checks in with the service, looks for changes and then synchronizes them.  This is the case for any application that syncs it's settings via the cloud (Safari, Messages, FaceTime, Photos, Spotify, FireFox, Edge Browser, etc.)\nNetwork Traffic Filtering looks at individual packets and either blocks them or allows them based on a \"filter\" rule.  It won't queue them up (and especially not on a sleeping computer) for later processing.\n", "Q: How can I stop DiskUtilities from requesting permission every time I try to create an image from a CD I have a big stack of CDs from the 90s that I want to keep the data from, but don't want the physical CD anymore.

For example, if you try with macOS 10.13.6, you get the following error message.\n\nHowever, if you have rEFInd properly installed, you can use an application to select the system you want to start up your computer. For example, I have the following rEFInd icon on my dock.\n\nClicking on the icon produces the following window.\n\nHere, I can select the startup system.\nThe same is true for Ubuntu. I have the following rEFInd icon on the Ubuntu launcher.\n\nClicking on the icon on the Ubuntu launcher produces the following window.\n\nBasic steps to implement this answer\n\n\n*\n\n*Allocate a small (200 MB) \"MSDOS (FAT32)\" partition for rEFInd. I would suggest at the end of disk1. The command for doing this is given below.\nsudo diskutil resizevolume disk1s2 999G 1 MS-DOS REFIND 200M\n\n\nNote: The above command will move up disk1s3 and place the new partition disk1s4 last.\n\n\n*Download rEFInd.\n\n*Install rEFInd on the \"MS-DOS (FAT)\" partition.\n\n*Configure rEFInd to recognize the 3 operating systems.\n\n*Install the software (scripts) in each operating system to choose the default operating system to boot at startup.\n\n\nBrief explanation of use\nrEFInd does not change the Startup Manager menu, except rEFInd itself will now appear in this menu. In fact, you will use the Startup Manger to make rEFInd the default operating system to boot at startup. rEFInd will the silently instructs the firmware to boot what ever operating system is defined as default in the rEFInd configuration file. The software scripts you install and execute on each operating system (as shown in my answer) rewrite the rEFInd configuration file to change the default operation system. – David Anderson 21 mins ago   \nSo, if the firmware is booting macOS through a default boot to rEFInd and you hold down the option key at startup to boot to Windows, then this boot to Windows is temporary. Next restart will boot back to rEFInd, then to macOS. If you hold down the control key while selecting Windows from the Startup Manager, then Windows will become the default operating system and rEFInd will be bypassed. \nYou can use the Startup Manager to enable or bypass rEFInd. The firmware has two modes to startup the Mac. The first mode boots the default operating system every time. The other mode, boots a selected operating only on the next startup and leaves the default unchanged. The rEFInd Boot Manager only uses the second mode. So, when you use rEFInd, you are actually booting the Mac twice on each restart. The first boot is to rEFInd and then second boot is after rEFInd instructs the firmware to boot to the desired operating system\n\nA: I know this isn't the answer you're looking for, but I've been using Parallels on High Sierra, and it's been absolutely awesome.  I've always prefered to run OSes on the metal, but the Virtualizer of todays hardware works fabulously now.\nI've had zero issues, and since the realization of true virtualization, running MacOSX, Windows 10, and Ubuntu all at the same time has helped me develop apps for all three operating systems.  I Strongly recommend going this route, because you don't have to reboot the Mac to go into the other operating systems.  I can start up and shut down my Windows and Ubuntu VMs very quickly.  \nI use both Windows and Mac applications simultaneously using the Coherence mode, and prefer to run my Ubuntu Desktop full screen on a second monitor.  I rarely have any issues, and my hard drive is fully encrypted using FileVault2, I don't even notice any performance issues with running several VMs.  I am running with 32GB of ram though, BTW.\nModel Name: iMac\n  Model Identifier: iMac13,2\n  Processor Name:   Intel Core i7\n  Processor Speed:  3.4 GHz\n  Number of Processors: 1\n  Total Number of Cores:    4\n  L2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB\n  L3 Cache: 8 MB\n  Memory:   32 GB\nI pay about 100$ per year for the Parallels subscriptions and Parallels Tools make the keyboard issues go away.  \n", "Q: With Apple Watch 4, can I make phone calls without an iPhone? I'd like to use Apple Watch Series 4 as a standalone device to make phone calls.\nOn an Apple Watch Series 4 Cellular, can I make a phone call via cellular network without my iPhone, which I'd like to leave at home, connected to it via Bluetooth or WiFi?\nAnd, can I additionally make phone calls via a Bluetooth headset which connects directly to the Apple Watch 4?\n\nA: An Apple Watch Series 4 (along with Series 3) with support for Cellular can make a phone call without an iPhone but will need to be paired with it. Apple Watch Cellular comes with a build-in eSIM. It needs to be paired with the SIM card in your iPhone.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to use your Apple Watch without your iPhone nearby\nApple Watch Series 4 is typically expected to support all the phone call/cellular features of Series 3.\nNote: Having an iPhone is a prerequisite for using an(any) Apple Watch.

I have noticed that I can print from something like the Notes app just fine so I think Printopia is working as expected. However, some apps, especially like the NYTimes app, do not seem to have the print button anywhere in the interface, even within Share and More.\nAny thoughts on how can I print the article that I am reading in the New York Times app?\n\nA: The New York Times iOS app doesn't include print functionality.\nIf you wish to print the article, what you can do instead is to print it via Safari.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap on the Share button within the app and either tap on Copy or the Message icon to reveal the article URL.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n*Once you have the article URL, copy and paste it to open in Safari on your iPad.\n\n*Tap on the Share icon in Safari and you can use Safari's print command to print the article.\n\n\n", "Q: Software that is functionally similar to Deep Freeze for MacOS 10.13 Faronics, the developers of Deep Freeze have stated that they have no intention of supporting APFS, and by extension 10.13.\nI know the Apple Stores used to use Deep Freeze and are now using a utility that is functionally similar to Deep Freeze on 10.13 on APFS, but definitely isn't Deep Freeze.\nDoes anyone know what this utility is, or any alternatives to Deep Freeze that supports APFS and MacOS 10.13?\nThis will be used in an enterprise environment, so something with proper support and licensing would be idea.\nThanks,\nNabeel\nEdit: Yes, this is a recommendation request post, however there is no other way to reword this post, and Faronics basically built this industry, so it's a little tone deaf to not mention them in the post.\n\nA: In terms of restore-on-reboot solutions it really boils down to Deep Freeze and Reboot Restore Rx. The latter of which doesn't support Mac's currently but will in the future from what I've hear.\nWhat the Apple Store uses is akin to loading a disk image automatically. It's a bit more cumbersome than Deep Freeze or other similar solutions but at the very least it's compatible with APFS.\n\nA: Well, less than 2 months after this question was asked, Faronics released a version of Deep Freeze that is APFS compatible, with express support for 10.13 and 10.14 now.\n(As such, I suspect that “[Faronics] have stated that they have no intention of supporting APFS, and by extension 10.13.” must have been a radical misunderstanding, probably of a “We have nothing to announce at the moment.” kind of statement.)\n", "Q: Create macro for Sketch App I want to create a macro for Sketch. I want to execute some commands, for example, save the file, run some plugins, etc. Is there a way I can do this?\nI'm using a Macbook Pro with OSX 13, I use this app called Sketch (for creating web and app designs and prototypes). As a part of my workflow I use some plugins to export and organize artworks. I would like to automate some processes by executing a macro or a script, and make the App execute some commands automatically. (Go to the Plugins menu, select an option, and so on). \nI'm not sure if that is something that can be done, but it will be helpful to save some time.\n\nA: I haven't used Sketch, so can't comment on how well it may work with Automator, but one option would be for you to create an Automator workflow to try and replicate your actions.\nThere are many online resources that can help you get started. Below are three of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automator Help (Apple's official Automator guide)\n\n*MacOSXAutomation.com\n\n*Automator World\nYou can also use Automator’s ability to record what you’re doing to create the basis of your workflow and then modify it to meet your needs. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator\n\n*Press commandN (or go to File > New)\n\n*Select the Application option\n\n*Click the Choose button\n\n*Click the red Record button (located at top right of the toolbar)\n\n*Now carry out one of the tasks you want to automate (i.e. switch over to Sketch, click on the Plugins menu, etc)\n\n*Automator will record your actions to try and copy your workflow\n\n*Stop the recording\n\n*Now back within Automator save your workflow\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*Recorded Automator tasks are far from perfect and often require you to manually edit them to work the way you want, but it may be a way for you to get started.\n\n*Depending on what you're doing, you may need to give permission for things to work. For example, if you create an application you may need to go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy and within the Privacy tab select the Accessibility option in the Sidebar and then give permission to what you've just created so that it can control your Mac.\n\n", "Q: Difference between filename and . filename in macOS terminal I'm newbie to MacOS. (I'm using mac OS high sierra 10.13.6)\nI installed a software. They said to initialize the software by \n. /path/setsas.sh\nI give no thought to . and space, so I just ran\npath/setsas.sh\nIt seemed to run, but after that I couldn't execute any command of the software.\nI found that I should have ran the command as it were, and after that it was fine.\nSo what these . and space mean here, and any guess why I couldn't execute any command at first even though file seemed to run?\nI know that . sometimes mean current folder, but it doesn't look like it in this case.\n\nA: . /path/setsas.sh loads the variables and functions from the script into your current shell session.  It's the same as running source /path/setsas.sh.  Running path/setsas.sh on the other hand spawns a new process.  The variables and functions will not be accessible from your current shell.  That's why the commands weren't working for you.\n\nA: When you \"simply enter a command,\" OS/X (like any Unix/Linux) uses the $PATH environment variable to specify the locations to be searched to find it – unless it is a built-in bash/shell command.\nWhen you specify ./command, that's an explicit reference to a particular file in a particular directory – \"the 'current' one.\"  $PATH is not used, and the command is not considered to be \"built-in.\"\nLikewise, ~/command is an explicit reference, this time using \"~\" as a shortcut to \"my home directory.\"  Once again, $PATH is not used.\n(Unrelated ...)  The source shell-command requires a specific reference to a file, and it causes the shell to read and execute all of the commands in that file.  (For instance, if you change your \"bash profile\" file and want to incorporate it without logging-in again, this is one way to do that.)\n", "Q: Any way to open a URL in a script without having it open in a browser The situation: My mobile carrier offers for free to send SMS notifications by following a URL.\nWhat I'd want: Include these URLs in various scripts to get notifications when I'm away from keyboard.\nThe problem: I can't find a way to open the URL silently (that is without opening it in a browser), the simplest thing:\ndo shell script \"open https://myurl\"\n\nopens a tab and brings my browser to the front, so I'd have to close the tabs either manually or with some other lines in the script. \nIs there's a more elegant way to do as if I had followed the link without showing it in a browser?\n\nA: For sure there are dozens of tools to do this.\n\n\n*\n\n*python scripts\n\n*ruby scripts\n\n*swift scripts\n\n*javascript scripts\n\n*shell scripts\n\n\nI’d start with bash and shell, but you could do this in dozens of ways.

I'm running MacOS 10.12.4 and I have a time machine backup that’s relatively current. I decided to download the 10.12.6 point update in the App Store. It downloaded the roughly 2 GB file. (I did not see when it finished because I left the Mac unattended near the end of the download.) When I returned to the Mac, the App Store showed 10.12.6 as something I could update, as if I never downloaded it in the first place.  I pushed update and it wanted to re-download the 2 GB update, which I did not wish to do since it takes so long to download. I rebooted and it was the same story.\nIn /Library/Updates it does show up in a folder titled 091-22861, and if I open macOSUpdCombo10.12.6Auto.pkg which is roughly 1.7 GB it appears to be something that would actually install the update.\nI didn't want to run that though since I was afraid doing it that way could mess something up. But at the same time I don't want the wasted space on my hard drive. So my question is, should I run that pkg? Or should I delete the 091-22861 folder? (The folder also contains a couple other pkg files and other minor files.) Also, in /Library/Updates the index.plist references 091-22861 and I would want to make sure that removing 091-22861 wouldn't cause any problems stemming from index.plist either.\nEdit: For extra information, I found a website that ostensibly allows you to download the update without the app store, and it indicates six pkg files that you'd need to run in order, and in my 091-22861 folder it only has three of those pkg files. I'm not inclined to install it from within 091-22861 so is there a safe way to erase that folder, and would I need to deal with index.plist in any way?\n\nA: If you have a partially downloaded and/or installed update for Mac OS stuck on your Mac, you must re-download and reinstall the update on your Mac. You can do this in one of two ways. Either way will accomplish the same thing, with the same results, with no practical difference between either method.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the update for Mac OS via the mac app store. \n\n*A second option is to download your update outside of the mac app store by using Apples official download site located at https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1970?locale=en_US . For people who may read this in the future and experience a possible broken link in the above reference, just go to the apple page (or google) and search for Mac OS Combo update download. From Apples website, search or follow the links to the proper (or desired) version (ex:10.13.6) of your update, and download it. The downloaded file should be in .dmg format. Then double click the file, and install the corresponding app from the installer window.\n\n\nSpecial Note in regards to Official Apple Software updates:\nDO NOT download apple software or updates from a non-apple source.\nOnce the freshly downloaded update is installed, Mac OS should clean up any leftover files including the \"corrupted\" or \"Partially downloaded\" update. \nIf this is your only problem you are having with Mac OS, there is no reason to do a full reinstall, even if you are fully backed up. Lastly, I must stress to users how important updates are (primarily for security reasons). You should never get lazy and ALWAYS take the time to install new updates as soon as they arrive in the app store. This will keep you protected, and defended against hackers/rootkits/virus's/trojans/botnets/etc. etc. So please, don't wait, just update the Mac.

How can I sync my iOS (in my current case, an iPhone8) photos+videos to both iCloud and Google Photos but delete all the photos+videos from my iOS device, primarily to free storage space (on my iPhone)?\nDetails and (known?) problems\nThis answer suggests that I can not do this, because deletion of photo/video files from the iOS device also deletes it from iCloud (example scenario below), which violates my goal. However, I'm hoping there's some workaround.\nSpecifically, I want to \"free up space on my device\" like I've done several times previously with Google Photos (GP). However, the GP photo/video file deletion may effectively delete the same photo/video file(s) from iCloud--which is what I'm trying to avoid.\n\nA: The following worked for me.

I have exhaustively tried to stop it from launching without success.\nI held the mouse on the Mail.app icon in the Dock, right clicked and made sure open on login is not ticked.\nBut every time I start my computer Mail.app starts automatically. I regard my privacy highly I do not want Mail.app to do this.\nHow can i stop this from happening or how can I disable Mail.app altogether.\n\nA: You can simply disable Mail.app auto launching at startup and do not need to remove the email account from Mail.app. But if you wish to change your email client, read along.\nThere are two parts to answering your query:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing your email account from Mail.app.\n\n*Stopping Mail.app from automatically launching when logging into macOS.\nYou wish to use Mozilla Thunderbird as the choice of your email client. That's perfectly okay. You can use just Thunderbird, macOS Mail.app or both simultaneously to handle your mail (slightly depending on email protocol)\nHere the answer for your question one-by-one:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you do not wish to use email account(s) with Mail.app, simply remove/disable the account(s) from Mail.app. With the Mail.app open, go to Preferences → Accounts in the Menu Bar and disable/remove the added account(s).\nNote: If your Mac is part of a company/enterprise and a system administrator has set it up for you, it is advisable to seek his assistance to remove the account and reconfigure the email with Thunderbird. Certain email protocol (POP3) may lead to data loss. Especially important if you are not familiar with what protocol your email client is configured.\n\n\n\n*Stop Mail.app from automatically launching. Go to System Preferences → Users & Groups → and select your user account in the left sidebar. Click on the Login Items tab, select Mail app in the list and hit the minus button shown in the bottom.\n\n\n\nYou may still choose to leave Mail app in the list and check the box ahead of it to let and launch on startup but keep it hidden from view.\n\nA: I sorted mail out finally it was stupid mistake on my part.

You can copy the installer to the other machine as it's \"universal\" to the Mac platform.\nHowever, my suggestion would be to create a USB Installer instead.  This way you can download it, \"move\" it to the USB and then remove it from your installation.\nYou will need an 8GB USB flash, formatted with a GUID partition and HFS+.

Although this question has been addressed at this link, none of the solutions worked for me and they are mostly from several years ago (I tried 3 or 4 of them and left comments too). \nThe problem I'm having is that the mic input level (in the sound panel of system preferences) keeps decreasing automatically. Each time I reset the audio input level back to 100% my problem is solved. I want to be able to have it just stay put without readjusting.\nHere's more detail: I'm using a language learning website that has an interactive feature that allows me to record myself saying a phrase so that it can then check if I've repeated the phrase correctly. But I find that as I'm using this record feature, the input mic level in the system preferences starts to decrease over time. So I end up repeatedly adjusting the mic input level back to 100% and it works well again.\nI'm using the Chrome browser on Mac 10.13.6 with a MacBook Pro 2015\n\nA: If you are using  Audio application (like Skype) or like yours \"language learning website that has an interactive feature that allows me to record myself\"\nyou gave them permission to use your audio, otherwise they would not work.\nMost of them have audio adjustment within them self (like Skype), so first look for it in your app you are using.\nMicrophone is used to send something back to the app. In turn it measures the Audio level and sends increase or decrees to your Mac. \nMac is open to those requests (you gave it the permission).\nThe only way to stop this is revoke the permission, or check what audio setting the app it self has.\nStopping the Auto gain on your Mac would require application specific monitoring and blocking the audio gain adjustments, which could result in the app not working properly since it might not hear you well.\nYou also have a tool on your Mac that allows for more control and adjustments.\n\nApplications > Utilities > Audio Midi Setup\n\n\nA: I've found an answer to my question, or at least I've found out enough that I have a working solution. Perhaps my experience will help someone else.\nOn the right edge of the address bar in Chrome, I noticed a video projector silhouette which when clicked provided access to controls for the microphone on that website (upper right of my image below).\n\nFurther, it has a Manage button which allows you to choose the microphone input source. In my setup there are 2 microphones, one in an external display and one called \"Internal Microphone\" (built into the Macbook Pro itself). I had been using the \"Display Audio\" so I decided to switch to the laptop mic. After that I closed and restarted the Chrome browser. I then ran several tests and things worked as desired: the input volume never moved from 100% as it had before.\nI then tried switching between the Internal Microphone and Display Audio in the sound panel of the System Preferences. There seemed to be no effect; that is, the input level remained at 100%. I suspect that the setting in the Chrome browser takes precedence, but I'm not sure. In any event, now that it's working so well I don't want to mess with it.\n\nA: What worked for me was creating a new Aggregate Device under the Audio Midi Setup app, and adding to it the input device that gets modified constantly. Optionally, you can add the output device to this new aggregate device. Finally, go into System Preferences > Audio and choose the new device as the output and input channels.\n", "Q: Copy the first n files from one directory to another Im looking to copy the first 'n' files from one directory to another directory preferably with only cli tools (no scripts).    \nI've tried the following:  \n\n\n*\n\n*find . -maxdepth 1 -type f | head -5 | xargs cp -t /target/directory \n\nThis looked promising, but failed because osx cp command doesn't appear to have the\n-t switch  \n\n\n*exec in a few different configurations\n\nThis probably failed for syntax problems on my end : /\n  I couldn't seem to get a head type selection working\n\nAny help or suggestions would be appreciated.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You need the -J option with xargs.\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f | head -n5 | xargs -J X cp X /target/directory\n\nThe J option places all the filenames into the placeholder X, which can be any character(s) and cp accepts multiple files to a target directory.

Looking for a way to start printing a PDF directly from the macos Finder with a keyboard shortcut (e.g. Cmd + P), but instead of sending it directly to the printer, opening the Print Dialog.\nCan I change these settings in macOS 10.12 somewhere?\nThank you for any help!\n\nA: Printing \"directly from finder\" does not happen.\nPrint Dialogs are always app-specific:\nEven if you seemingly don't notice it, MacOS opens at least \"Preview\", prints the document/graphic and closes the app afterwards.\nYour best bet would be an app like Karabiner Elements (free) that's able to sequentially open a file and execute the print command (typically with a print dialogue), using just one user-defined shortcut.  \nSince a sequence of keys pressed is a \"Complex Modification\" you'd have to edit KE's ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json and add this kind of code (after: \"rules\": [ ):\n{ \"description\": \"Finder: open file in app, open print dialog\",\n  \"manipulators\": [\n      { \"conditions\": [ { \"bundle_identifiers\": [\"^com.apple.finder\"],\n                          \"type\": \"frontmost_application_if\"\n                      } ],\n              \"from\": { \"key_code\": \"p\",\n                        \"modifiers\": { \"mandatory\": [\"right_command\"] }\n                      },\n        \"parameters\": { \"basic.to_if_held_down_threshold_milliseconds\": 5 },\n   \"to_if_held_down\": [ { \"key_code\": \"o\",\n                          \"modifiers\": [\"right_command\"]\n                      } ],\n   \"to_after_key_up\": [ { \"key_code\": \"p\",\n                          \"modifiers\": [\"right_command\"]}\n                      ],\n      \"type\": \"basic\"\n      }\n                  ]\n}\n\nAs opening an app takes some time the different commands (open / print) are \"separated\" through \"held_down\" and \"key_up\" definitions.\nBe aware that a \"comma\" (,) may be necessary either in front of the first or behind the last bracket, IF there are other rules in the json-file. \n(If you prefer the left command key on your keyboard the \"from\"-part would say: [\"left_command\"].)\n", "Q: Windows 10 Boot Camp on Mac mini Fusion Drive is running very slow. How to replace HDD / upgrade disk to SSD without reinstalling OS? Hardware:\n- Mac mini (late 2014)\n- Core-i5\n- 8GB\nLogical drive:\n- Fusion Drive 1,15TB\nPhysical drives:\n- 128GB PCIe\n- 1000GB HDD\nPartitions and systems:\n- 250GB HFS+ macOS High Sierra\n- 850GB NTFS Boot Camp Windows 10\nScenario:\nmacOS is running fine but Windows startup takes many minutes. Overall system performance is also unacceptable. Need to quickly replace 1TB HDD with an SSD without unpairing a Fusion Drive nor reinstalling any OS. How to do it?\n\nA: I backed up all my data first so I could try a couple of methods before I found the right one described below.\n\n\n*\n\n*I carefully replaced the original internal Apple HDD with the same capacity ADATA SU800 1TB SSD. Lack of a special T6 Security Torx Screwdriver was a little problem but I luckily could brake out security pins from the chassis screws, making all of them a regular torx (though I strongly recommend buying a proper screwdriver on eBay as well as the logic board removal tool instead of my laundry wire hanger, especially if your Mac is still covered by a warranty). A detailed instruction of disassembling a Mac mini is available on iFixit.\n\n*When the SSD was already inside (I didn't touch a PCIe disk at all), I attached the old HDD as an external drive through a USB enclosure and booted up from an external optical drive with an Acronis True Image HD bootable DVD (you can try another such third party software but I found that cloning a Boot Camp Partition with the Apple Disk Utility doesn't work well).\n\n*Then I cloned the whole HDD with the \"as is\" option to the new SSD without automatic resizing! (SSD was a little bit bigger so I tried that but the result of such attempt was a Fusion Drive malfunction, no access to a Recovery Partition and impossibility to update macOS because of an error). Still don't try any action with a PCIe partition! \n\n*After complete operation, disconnection of external drives and restart, the mini instantly started up exactly the same as before the disk replacement. Both operating systems are running properly but many, many times faster.\n\n*Finally, just in case boot in a macOS Recovery Mode and perform a Disk Repair of a Fusion Drive and a Macintosh HD partition as well. Excluding one possible warning about some small capacity mismatch, all operations should finish successfully and you should be able to update macOS to the latest version without error.\n", "Q: What's the difference between hostname's show and the hostname on the command line? I use hostname for checking: \naircrafts-MacBook-Pro:~ ldl$ hostname\naircrafts-MacBook-Pro.local\n\nthere shows aircrafts-MacBook-Pro.local.\nI want to know the difference between aircrafts-MacBook-Pro:~ ldl$'s aircrafts-MacBook-Pro and aircrafts-MacBook-Pro.local. \n\nA: The hostname given by the \"hostname\" command is the fully qualified hostname (i.e. the full hostname including domains, etc.).\nThe one displayed in the prompt is shown because your /etc/bashrc file contains the following prompt definition for bash (your shell):\nPS1='\\h:\\W \\u\\$ '\n\nThe first part of the prompt specification \"\\h\" means that the hostname should be displayed in the prompt - but only the hostname up to the first . (dot).\nThat's why you see two different things.\n", "Q: Set an external display as main and always display the app switcher UI on it I was wondering if there is a way to set an external display positioned towards visible right of my Mac as primary, and always show the app switcher UI Command + Tab on that display.\nI tried the said arrangement (as shown below), but the app switcher still appears on the MacBook Pro's built-in display (on left), which is very annoying, as I have to turn my head left to see which app is selected.\n\nAs you can see, I positioned the white bar (that should define the main display) in the external display - however, this behaviour is not respected. How do I configure my system to achieve the intended behaviour.\nI am using a MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra 10.12.6.\n\nA: The primary display is configured correctly. The app switcher should be shown on the external display, only if the Dock is not set to Automatically hide and show, and is always visible on screen.\nMake sure you have not enabled Automatically hide and show the Dock under System Preferences → Dock. If enable, toggle the setting by unchecking and re-checking it.\nIf you wish to keep the Dock hidden and shown only when the mouse pointer touches the edge which houses the Dock, the app switcher will be shown on the screen that has last displayed the Dock. Thus, to show the app on your main display (external, on visible right), move the mouse pointer to the edge of the Dock, momentarily display it and then use the app switcher with the keyboard shortcut Command + Tab.\n", "Q: Change Apple ID on iPhone without causing 'damage' to apps/app store purchases and keeping app data I have an old iPhone 5. It has lots of apps installed on it; there's a long message history in WhatsApp and other apps that I don't want to be deleted.\nI have created a new Apple ID and want to use it on this iPhone.\nHow do I accomplish this without causing any damage to apps/app data? Also, if I change the ID, would I be able to update my apps?\n\nA: It is possible to change the Apple ID on an iPhone. You can do this by going to Settings > iTunes and App Store and logout with your current Apple ID. After that, you can login with the new Apple ID.\nWhen you download/purchase an app from the App Store, it will be connected to the Apple ID that is used to do the download/purchase. This means that if you start using a different Apple ID to download/purchase new apps, there's no problem to update them.\nAs you mentioned, you have for example WhatsApp installed. If there's an update for WhatsApp in the App Store, you are still able to update it, but you have to use the Apple ID password of your \"old\" Apple ID.\nOn a side note, you can make a backup from your WhatsApp history (texts and media) in iCloud. After this, you can delete and reinstall WhatsApp and restore the backup.\nI don't know if other apps that are important for you have the same functionality to create a backup to iCloud.\n\nA: I actually have apps on my computer that were purchased under two different Apple ID's, and the Mac simply asks me to enter the user-id and password that is associated with any app when it updates it.\nObviously, this id is \"authorization to access a particular account on Apple's servers,\" not \"authorization to run this app on your computer.\"  \nAnd, iPhones basically work the same way.\n", "Q: Is it okay to compress application files? (Especially licensed applications) I have attempted to research this but given the fact that applications exist to compress other files, I've found it difficult to learn about compressing applications themselves.\nI presume its okay to compress applications in general – they are like any other file.\nHowever, before compressing applications which require licenses (for example pre CC Adobe suite), I want to make sure the license will continue if I compress the application and delete the uncompressed file.\nIf I compress an application and delete the original will I lose my license?\n(I understand this could be different for different applications; is there a generic answer?\n\nA: Most macOS applications are not actually like 'any other file' - they just look like one - and are actually a folder of files called a package. Right-click on most apps, and you will see a Show Package Contents command. Click that to see the folder structure of the app. \nThat being said, applications will compress and expand just fine. I've compressed and expanded Adobe apps with no effect on licensing so long as they are expanded onto the same system.\nCompressing an application and expanding it on a different system may break licensing if the licensing mechanism itself resides outside the app's package, or if some other licensing scheme is in effect. There is no generic licensing scheme for all circumstances.\n\nA: Zipping is a lossless compression algorithm. You will not loose anything when going from Folder→ZIP File→Folder.  You can even confirm this by verifying the checksum of a file before being zipped and after being unzipped.\nSide Note:: If its difficult to understand how anything could be compressed without losing data here's a good way to understand it: \"AAAABBCCC\" can be compressed into \"A4B2C3\".  The compressed string is 3 characters shorter then the original yet both still say \"four A's, two B's and three C's\". While this is not how the zip algorithm works, it is a good way to understand the concept of lossless compression.\nTo answer your question, while it is ok to compress a Application (which is just any old directory) the license file will most likely not transferred because most of the time it is not stored inside the application's folder. However, if the license file does reside in the application's folder than yes it will transfer.  ZIPing the license file will not corrupt it.\nJust an FYI: Most applications cannot be transferring by just copying the application. Most store files in ~/Library, /Library, or other directories. The application won't run properly without these directories and associated files.\n\nA: We have to assume that this is not about transferring an application onto another computer.\nThe way this is phrased it cannot mean \"zipping\" an application (bundle) into an archive. While this is possible and should be safe, the application cannot be executed in that state. As this is quite nonsensical compared to the alternative of just deleting the offending application this will surely mean something else:\nTransparently compressing applications with HFS filesystem compression.\nAgain this is perfectly possible and in fact Apple does exactly this with most applications it installs. The last part is crucial since ordinary copies will typically be uncompressed.\nTo confirm this practice is done by Apple since Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, you may either read File System Compression in HFS+: Space savings and performance gain? or download the tool afsctool here and run it on Safari.app as an example:\n$ afsctool -v /Applications/Safari.app/\n/Applications/Safari.app/:\nNumber of HFS+ compressed files: 333\nTotal number of files: 360\nTotal number of folders: 40\nTotal number of items (number of files + number of folders): 400\nFolder size (uncompressed; reported size by Mac OS 10.6+ Finder): 23576574 bytes / 24.6 MB (megabytes) / 23.4 MiB (mebibytes)\nFolder size (compressed - decmpfs xattr; reported size by Mac OS 10.0-10.5 Finder): 19959187 bytes / 20.2 MB (megabytes) / 19.2 MiB (mebibytes)\nFolder size (compressed): 20200663 bytes / 20.4 MB (megabytes) / 19.5 MiB (mebibytes)\nCompression savings: 14.3%\nApproximate total folder size (files + file overhead + folder overhead): 20622212 bytes / 20.6 MB (megabytes) / 19.7 MiB (mebibytes)\n\nAdding the parameter c then compresses all files in a given path in-place. \nYou will need to make sure to have a recent and complete backup! That's because this method is almost perfectly safe. Except when it isn't. For some strange reason the git binary as an example will compress in place OK – but also break in the process. There are some other apps and binaries that will break, but those are very rare. If something goes wrong, restore those few files from backup.\nAdobe applications did compress without any issues, last time I checked (caveat: I moved away from those products, so double check for later versions). The licensing information is not within the App bundle anyway.\nGiven the unprofessionally anaemic size of entry level SSDs filesystem compression is highly recommended.\nThis method might be employed with onboard tools as well. The command line utility ditto offers an option for that, but it is cumbersome.\nIf you do not like the command line: GUI-tools for that are available as well. One example dedicated to this would be MoreSpaceFolder (AppStore); there are others.\nSince it is transparent you might also transparently compress every file and folder on you system, including system files, provided it is accessed in the boot process only after zlib support is loaded. For this manipulation of system files you need SIP disabled.\nThis is not really recommended, as it may render your system unbootable if you compress the wrong files. \nYou can compress every file? It is also not recommended by Apple to compress files that are frequently rewritten. Things like Finder preferences get rewritten needlessly and constantly. Not only would this be impractical, it is also senseless to attempt: it will work, but the newly written files are then in uncompressed form again. \nThis is the generic answer for HFS+. For APFS I have no information.\n", "Q: How to unlock admin locked preference panes My lovely work locks certain preference panes, but I need to access a couple things. I've found a way to do this before, but can't seem to find it online.\nI've dumped the managed preferences plist.  I thought there was a terminal command that could be used to make that work?\n\nA: If your employer is locking preference panes, it is for reasons they have determined are necessary for their (and your) protection.\nMost modern MDM (Mobile Device Management) systems can detect such subversions, self-repair if successfully subverted, and report back to the administrators.\nBe forewarned, attempts to subvert such restrictions placed on your computer, (which I assume your employer owns, not you,) can in some cases be a firing offense.\nOne recourse you have is to ask if certain restrictions can be relaxed if they interfere with your job duties.\n", "Q: How to open files from Safari without having to save them to Mac I recently changed from using a Surface to a Mac and I am having a hard time figuring out how to open files, let say from my gmail, without having to save the file on my Mac. With Microsoft, when I click download it prompted if I wanted to just open the file, Save or Save as... I can not figure out how to get those options on my Mac. Everytime it just prompts to save the file, but no to just open it without saving it first.\n\nA: That option is located in the Safari Preferences dialog.\nin Safari go to the Safari menu and select Preferences.\nIf it is not already selected click on the General icon in the top left of the Preferences dialog.\nAt the very bottom there should be a checkbox (likely unchecked) that says \"Open \"safe\" files after downloading.\" Check that box and you should be good to go.\n\nA: There are several aspects to the behavior you are describing. First, you should know that the \"Open\" vs \"Save\" behavior is not strictly controlled by the Operating System; it is a function of the application and the source of the file. For example, you mentioned GMail... there are many different ways to configure GMail, but in my setup, hovering the pointer over a mail attachment yields a choice of Save to Drive (i.e. Google Drive), or Download. In the Chrome browser's Settings, Advanced menu, you will find options to specify both the download location, and whether or not the file will be opened after download. You'll find similar settings for Firefox, and for Safari (as pointed out in @SteveChambers answer). \nAlso, as @jmh pointed out in his comment, a \"right click\"/control click will yield a context-sensitive menu that may offer choices such as Open and Save As..., depending upon the type of document it is, and how the web page was coded. \nIt seems that you may be laboring under a misconception. By that, I mean you seem to feel that Microsoft is not saving the file before you open it. Let me assure you that Microsoft is saving the file before you open it. Microsoft may be saving the file to a temporary location (I'll explain that in a moment), but they are saving it - that is, it exists on your hard drive somewhere, and it was downloaded. \nAnd so, if you wish to \"do it like Microsoft does\" on your Mac, you might try this: \n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using Safari as your web browser, you can configure it as outlined in @SteveChambers answer; i.e. open the file after download. Likewise, these same settings are available in Chrome and in Firefox (and likely any other browser you'll encounter). \n\n*You can change the default location for Downloads . Generally all the browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari) default saving downloaded files to the folder ~/Downloads - a folder you will see in your Dock. Files you download to this folder will remain there until you manually delete them. However, if you specify /tmp (a \"temporary\" folder) as the default location for downloaded files, these downloads will be deleted when your system restarts. \nOne caveat you should be aware of: If you elect to use /tmp, you should NOT go into /tmp and manually delete files. Let the OS take care of the cleanup. \nHope this helps... transitioning to a new OS means re-learning some things, but at the end of the day, they often do the same things, but called by a different name. Such is the case with \"Open\" and \"Download\". \n", "Q: How to reset app thumbnails in iOS On an iPhone, when you double-tap your home button, it brings up the app switcher, which shows you all the apps that are currently running.  But the thumbnail that is displayed when switching apps is not necessarily what those apps currently have showing.  Some are \"live\" and some are not, and I don't know how iOS decides what to display, nor how often it updates the thumbnail cache.\nA while back, my girlfriend sent a pic of herself to my Gmail account, which is... umm... not exactly safe for work if you catch my drift.  Anyway, that was almost 6 months ago, but to this very day that's the picture that shows every time I bring up the app switcher if I don't close the Gmail app when I'm done using it.\nWhile I certainly do appreciate the picture, this has led to several awkward moments when there are other people around.  She's not exactly fond of it either.  The thumbnail has survived two iOS updates and I've power-cycled the phone numerous times since then.  I even uninstalled/reinstalled the app.  I figured it would've updated the thumbnail cache on its own by now, but as I said before, here we are 6 months later and that picture is still stuck there.\nIs there any way to get iOS to flush the thumbnail cache?\n\nA: *\n\n*Uninstall the App\n\n*Force Restart iPhone using Vol Up + Vol Down + Power Button \n\n*Reinstall the App\n\nThe cache should have cleared during the Force Restart of Springboard.\n", "Q: How to keep mail messages on servers for Apple mail? My \"late 2013\" Mac Pro has a small internal SSD. Since Yahoo Mail and Google Mail have large storage on their servers, I don't see reasons for me to store mail messages on my local SSD. Can Apple Mail client be configured in a way that it only stores, say, 1 month of mail messages locally? Then it can fetch older mail messages on demand. Can I configure Apple Mail to do that?\n\nA: You can begin with Setting the Download Attachments to None in you Mac Mail.\nThat is the biggest part of mails anyway, the rest is just text.\nIf you are up to the task you can then export all attachments out of your Local storage.\nThey are located in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Mail Downloads/\nYou can also Export all of the mail box, to for example iCloud.\nIt just makes a copy of it, so you can now delete mails on your Mac, and get them again later.\nTo do so right click on the mailbox and use Export.\nDid you know that for $1/Month you can upgrade your iCloud to 50GB.\n\nNow if you want to automate that, like keep emails for a month then Export, you will need a Automator process for that.\n", "Q: Is Apple eSim on Watch 3 / iPhone XS proprietary standard? Is it a proprietary standard? I know GSMA has a standard by the same name but if it is not proprietary, then why does Apple list all the supported carriers on their website? They wouldn't know what carriers do and don't support the standard in let's say Germany? \nIs there some way Apple has control over what carrier they will allow to be used on the phone / watch? \n\nA: eSIM is an open JEDEC standard for the interface to the hardware component of a SIM card designed to replace the UICC (smart-card) interface that is in common usage, the third-generation Apple Watch just happened to be the first major device to use it commercially.  There is actually no special support required for the hardware itself.\nWhat is required for carrier support though is the ability to remotely provision the SIM.  Because an eSIM is not removable from the device, it has to be provisioned (configured for authentication to the carrier) in the device.  This particular aspect is what Apple's list is about, some carriers support it, some don't.  It's also really easy for them to find out which of the major ones do (they can literally just ask them, because Apple really is that big that they can do stuff like that).\n", "Q: Can't remove \"Install macOS High Sierra.app\" I had to make a bootable macOS High siera install, everyhing went well and it worked.

So far so good and it runs quite fast enough for my use , but if I put it to sleep it won't wake up. It won't respond to the power button either on a press or a hold. I have to power off and remove the battery to start it up again, and then it starts, switches itself off and then starts again and chimes. I have tried replacing the hall effect sensor for the sleep switch but the result is the same. One guess is that the computer needs to switch on the HD first and then the rest of the system follows on and without the HD in the main slot it hangs. Anyway , anyone else experienced this or can think of a solution?\n\nA: My first thought would be to try and resolve the initial issue (i.e. the fact your MBP is not recognising the main drive slot), as that's what is most likely causing your current problem as well.\nHowever, since you seem happy to work off the optical drive, I would try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*First reset the NVRAM and SMC (in that order)1\n\n*Boot up from the optical drive slot\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preference > Startup Disk\n\n*Ensure that the current boot drive is selected\n\n*Exit System Preferences and Restart your MBP\n\n\nNow test to see if that has made any difference.\n1.

No ringtone, no vibration, no banner on top of the screen, no blue circle next to their name in the Messages screen, not even a noise when I’m IN the conversation and they send a text. Basically it’s as if I’ve already READ the text.\nAnd I know the first answer is going to be “Turn of Do Not Disturb for that person”; that’s not it, I’ve done that so many times it’s not even funny. I’ve changed the text tone to default and changed the default, I’ve turned on Emergeny Bypass, I’ve deleted a huge amount of texts/attachements from them, I’ve deleted the contact all together, I’ve power cycled my phone more times than I can count, and I’ve completely reset my phone once; nothing has worked.\nThis is probably a good time to mention that when this problem started, there were TWO contacts that had this issue, but, by some sort of miracle, one of them started giving me notifications again... and I did absolutely nothing, they just randomly came back, and this was a couple weeks after I completely reset my phone and straight up deleted their contacts.\nThe only thing that I can possibly think is that there are too many messages in the conversation. I have Keep Messages set to Forever and this is the one person in my contacts I text the most, so there’s A LOT. But at the same I’m not quite sure. Like I said, I deleted a TON of messages, and actually switched my Keep Messages setting from Forever to 2 Weeks, so that must’ve deleted hundreds... still nothing (and I changed it back to Forever) And just today I realized I had a good amount of attachements I hadn’t deleted (about 400, yes I know absurd), so I got rid of them... still nothing. So I’m just completely stumped.\nMy only saving grace is that, for whatever unknown reason, the technological gods decided that I can get their notifications through my Series 1 38mm Apple Watch. If I don’t have it or it’s not charged, I’d never know they’d sent me a text.\nThe only thing I haven’t done is delete the conversation all together and... we’ll id rather not, for personal reasons, but if I don’t get anything that works then I’ll do that. So if anybody has ANYTHING that might work, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: My moms friend had this problem also and we ended up doing searches and found that my mom was listed 4 times in different apps and she deleted them all and put it in again in contacts and it worked. If you go to messages for example and pull down on screen you can search. So it might be entered into several apps. If you pull up more than one then this could help. Just can't hurt to try it.  Or if you go to iCloud.com Mail and Contact settings you can see if there is a rule.  \n\nA: I have the exact same issue with only one contact \nI am certain the hide notifications is enabled and \nEven toggled it on and off to make sure .

I am running Homebrew on 10.13.6, with the prefix /usr/local.  \nWhen I run brew upgrade, two directories are created in /usr/local/share.  These are: /usr/local/share/man/man2, and /usr/local/share/man/man6.  There are no files in these directories.\nMeanwhile, whenever I run brew prune --verbose, I get the output:\nrmdir /usr/local/share/man/man6\nrmdir /usr/local/share/man/man2\nPruned 0 symbolic links and 2 directories from /usr/local\n\nWhenever brew upgrade, these two troublesome directories are then re-created!

Yet, the eternal battle between brew upgrade and brew prune continues.\nHow can I get them to stop fighting?\n\nA: There is an inelegant solution to this bug/inconsistency in the two functions of the tools: put any file in the directories in question.\nThen  brew prune will stop removing them because they will no longer be empty.  If brew prune is no longer removing them, brew upgrade won't create them.  If you're concerned about space, you could even put an alias file in the directories.\nIn the grand scheme of things, having these empty folders create and then removed is a harmless side effect and doesn’t really break anything functionally.\n", "Q: Does the Chinese dual SIM iPhone XS work with any SIM card?

The hard drive was broken so I switched it out for an SSD. I installed high sierra using an installer usb created by a friend of mine. High sierra is quite heavy for this older laptop so I want to downgrade to an older version of osx. I tried using shift + alt/opt + cmd + r, which is supposed to give the user access to the installer of an osx version as close as possible to the original shipped os. I only get the option to install high sierra.

Follow the onscreen instructions and wait for your Mac to restart.\n\nWhen it restarts, ignore the option to migrate data from a backup. \n\nOptionally --Re-install the backup tool you used to backup your Mac before you upgraded to High Sierra and then use that to restore data from that backup. \n\n", "Q: Deleted time machine backups from external HD, but did not free space Time machine backups filled my 4TB external HD.  To free space, I deleted a handful of the particular backups from:\n/Volumes/Winston's 4TB/Backups.backupdb/  \n\nThose files ended up in the trash bin and trying to \"empty\" the trash bin erred indicating the folder was in use.  So, I deleted the contents through terminal:\ncd /Volumes/\"Winston's 4TB\"/.Trashes/\nsudo rm -rf /501/2018-0*\n\nFinder now shows the trash bin being empty, but the space has not been freed up on the drive.  How do I recover that space?\n\nA: Enter Time Machine - there is an icon on the menu bar. Scroll back using the arrow keys on the screen until you get to the older backups. Near the top of the window, there is an icon that looks like a gear. Click on this icon and one of the options in the pull-down menu is to delete. Use this to delete backups.\n\nA: I never have patience to repair permissions or delete files piecemeal on Time Machine since the hard links take significant IOPs when you have lots of backup intervals - especially on a spinning drive and not an SSD. \nI typically just put the drive on the shelf if I ever need any data and buy a new drive for current backups when I can’t zero the entire filesystem. \nWorse, if you didn’t use tmutil delete to remove the files, you likely broke the drive for future use with Time Machine and didn’t correct for the access controls that prevent even root from using rm to delete or modify the backup files. \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I manually delete old backups to free space for Time Machine?\nTo zero the filesystem, use Disk Utility to remove the entire volume or repartition the whole drive.

This is activated by right-clicking on a File, directory or Disk, selecting Properties and then clicking on the Advanced... button to check the box \"Compress contents to save disk space\".\nWhen enabled, files are transparently compressed when written to disk and decompressed when read from disk. This is managed by the file system and OS as needed. \nI'd like a Mac OS equivalent of this. There's nothing obvious in the Finder and a preliminary search turns up nothing conclusive.\nIs there a macOS option equivalent to this? Either natively or through 3rd party software?\n\nA: This is actually a feature of the NTFS file system (I believe...) and hails from the days when disks were more expensive, much smaller and measured in megabytes. Microsoft has kept this functionality in all versions of windows since the early days of NT.\nWhile you can manually compress files to save space I realize that is not what you are looking for. However I am not aware of a utility or feature of macOS that allows automatic file system level compression of disk contents.\nNote that in an article on ArsTechnica it is noted that it sounds like file system compression may be coming to APFS in the (near or otherwise) future.\nThere may be something in APFS that allows this but so far neither Apple nor any third parties (that I am aware of) has implemented this functionality.\n\nA: \nNote: this is not exactly the end-to-end solution on MacOS but it leverages the transparent compression in NTFS.\n\nI was looking for the same functionality as I work with large uncompressed rasters (DEM - digital elevation models) and I had to make sure I will not run out of the disk space while processing these files. \nI've done this on USB drive. I attached the drive to Parallels Desktop (but I believe it can Virtual Box or any physical windows machine), formatted it using NTFS, created a folder and marked it as compressed - all in Windows.\nThen I mounted the drive to my MacBook. (I use NTFS for Mac from Paragon Software but other apps like this one should handle it). Any file that i wrote to the folder created on windows was compressed automatically.\n\n\nA: Short answer\nThere is no need for users to enable/disable transparent compression in macOS as it's built into the file system.\nLong answer\nIn the pre-Mac OS X days there were a number of products that basically achieved the same thing. Disk Doubler was probably the most popular (because it started the trend), but other options included AutoDoubler and SuperDisk!\nThese products were very popular at the time (from memory, Disk Doubler was one of the most popular software packages sold for the Mac platform). However, the reason for their popularity was largely due to the small hard drive sizes of that era. As time went by the need (and popularity) for these packages waned significantly - mainly because the HFS+ file system was released in the late 1990s and this allowed much smaller block sizes and much larger disk capacities.\nOver time Apple continually improved the HFS+ file system so that by the time Mac OS X 10.6 was launched it actually incorporated AppleFSCompression which is essentially the same feature you're referring to. Any software using Apple's APIs could take advantage of this, however at the time this was not enabled by default due to various reasons - users needed to use the Terminal to take advantage of it.\nAs time went by and software was updated, the use of Apple's compression technology became mainstream. With Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11) and iOS 9, Apple made further improvements by introducing a compression algorithm known as LZFSE into the operating system. This has since been adopted in watchOS and tvOS as well. \nWhile the LZFSE algorithm is the fastest and most energy efficient option offered by Apple, it's not the only option available to developers. LZ4, LZMA and ZLIB are other options and there are various reasons why one may be chosen over another.\nIn summary, the operating system uses compression natively and, in the case of Apple and 3rd party software, developers have a number of options in terms of the compression algorithm they opt for. Regardless of the choice, compression is transparently taking place all the time and from a user's perspective there is nothing they need to do to take advantage of it.\n\nA: Use AFSCTool https://github.com/RJVB/afsctool.git to compress files in a directory.\nAFSCTool tells the file system to compress the files, and then they will be decompressed on-demand by the file system.  If you later create any new files or modify any files they will be uncompressed, so I just run it weekly on older subfolders that haven't been touched in 10 weeks (6 million seconds) using a bash script:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\nnow=\"$(date +%s)\"\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d -print0 |\n    while IFS= read -r -d '' line; do \n        dirdate=\"$(stat -f %m $line)\"\n        # echo $now\n        # echo $dirdate\n        let diff=\"${now} - ${dirdate}\"\n        echo \"Seconds since directory $line modified is $diff\"\n        if [ \"$diff\" -gt 6000000 ]; then\n           echo \"Compressing $line\"\n           afsctool -c -j1 -6 \"$line\"\n        fi\n    done\n\n\nA: Since I have an external Seagate drive (a couple actually) I am making one of them NTFS mountable and will use compression and use the Parallels mounting tip above... if it works I'll add the \"cookbook\" here...\nI am downloading the seagate Paragon Driver from the MacOS Support page from Seagate...\nR\n", "Q: Karabiner-Elements: How to disable a group of keys in a simple way?

I already read this Why does my WiFi disconnect when my Mac goes to sleep and this What is the “wake for wifi network access” setting in energy preferences?. Some answers contradict each other. Some people think disabling this option will make wifi never disconnect. and Some people think disabling this option will save energy, thus disconnect when sleep. Which one is correct? \nWhy do I care? I just want my wifi connect all the time unless I shutdown the machine. The current observation is that when the screen is off for some time, my networking apps are all disconnected. But the weird thing is I can still ping my macos from another computer. How can that happen? The wifi is on, but all my apps stop working. How may I avoid this failure of my applcations?\n\nA: To answer my own question, I did some tests suggested by a deleted answer.\n(1) If I disable Wake for Wi-Fi network access and put macos to sleep mode, the wifi will be off. (I can not ping the wifi's ip anymore in another client.)\n(2) If I enable Wake for Wi-Fi network access and put macos to sleep mode, the wifi will remain on. (I can ping the wifi's ip successfully in another client.) But even if the wifi is on, my apps will still be disconnected. \nThus, the answer in link:  Why does my WiFi disconnect when my Mac goes to sleep: \n\nAfter a certain time frame, more processes are frozen for the system to save energy.\n\nDisable “Wake for network access” and you shouldn’t have this problem anymore.\n\nThe first sentence should be correct. The reason why my apps are disconnected even if the wifi is on is because my apps are frozen when the system is in sleep mode. \nBut the second sentence is incorrect. Disable the option doesn't solve that problem at all and even make wifi become off in sleep mode. \nHow to avoid apps disconnecting from network?\nAvoid macos switching to sleep mode. \nHow to stop macos switching to sleep mode on power adapter when locking the screen or display is off?\nSystem Preferences --> Energy Saver --> Power Adapter --> \n\n\n*\n\n*Enable Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off\n\n*Disable Put hard disks to sleep when possible.\n\n\nHow to stop macos switching to sleep mode on battery when locking the screen or display is off?\nSystem Preferences --> Energy Saver --> Power Adapter --> Disable Put hard disks to sleep when possible.\nand then execute the following to disable sleep mode:\n\nsudo pmset -b sleep 0; sudo pmset -b disablesleep 1\n\nThis command is untested yet by me and referenced from link\n", "Q: Sharing a TUN VPN connection with Android & iOS for traffic interception I have two interfaces:\n - A physical WLAN interface with 802.1x auth (en0)\n - A virtual TUN interface with VPN (invisible in Network Settings) (utun1)\nI have mobiles (both rooted Android and jailbroken iOS) that I want to intercept their HTTP/S traffic, over Bluetooth.\nMy first thought was to do Internet Sharing from WiFi to Bluetooth, OS X did not like this, as the WiFi has 802.1x auth.\nThen I turned on Bluetooth Tethering without any connection on the Android, connected to it from the Mac (en3) and added the Mac as default route with ip route add default via <mac ip>. Then on the Mac I did:\n\nsysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1\necho \"nat on utun1 from en3:network to any -> (utun1)\" >> /etc/pf.conf\npfctl -F all\npfctl -ef /etc/pf.conf\n\nI got no errors but the mobile device is not able to connect to the internet. It pings the mac, the route is fine, but the NAT does not work.\nHow can I share the VPN connection over Bluetooth PAN to the mobile devices? Should I try a different approach? Am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: First on the Mac do a network configuration (a location in Apple wording) appropriate for your need. Never use the too infamous and too magic \"Automatic\" location.\nA configuration with a \"Wi-Fi\" and \"Bluetooth PAN\" interfaces and nothing else. Configure them (I guess you are familiar with this aspect to start playing with a VPN and the problems of security around this).\nOnce this is set, with nothing connected yet on the \"Bluetooth PAN\" interface, just configure an \"Internet Sharing\" (which in fact should be correctly named a \"network gateway\") as follows:\n\nThe correct sysctl, nat and pf settings will be done by many subprocesses hidden (and undocumented) behind Internet Sharing.\n", "Q: What is the value of iCloud.com if 2FA requires your device? It would seem that the point of iCloud.com and its web apps is to provide access to your content on the go, when for whatever reason, you don’t have access to your device itself.\nBut if logging into the website requires you to first authenticate yourself with the device, then what is the point of the website?\nOf course if you have your device handy — then you wouldn’t need the website...\nHow is this not a glaring oversight by Apple?\n\nA: The first time you access a 2FA-protected iCloud account on any device you've chosen to use with 2FA, you must provide the correct credentials with that device to assure iCloud that it is indeed the device you've selected to receive 2FA authentication. You are then offered the choice of ignoring future requests for authentication on that device for some duration of time. Every so often, you must re-authenticate with the 2FA credentials to reassert your identity.

That is 5.0e14 worth of Data transferred. (let me help you, that is 500TB)\nAlso you do not always \"write\" to the same cell (more than 50% of them are just in read mode), so that is why it is important to keep your SDD below 80% capacity.\nsource\nIn any case, it is not so much important to know exactly the current and the future life time. Eventually it will fail.\nJust Keep Backup.\n\nA: Smart Attributes for Total Writes\nTechnically speaking, there are SMART attributes defined for read/write values, but there's no guarantee that the drive manufacturer is going to use them.  They are as follows (defined as \"words\" - i.e. \"Word 241\"):\n\n*\n\n*241 - Total LBAs Written\n\n*242 - Total LBAs Read\n\n*243 - Total LBAs Written Expanded\n\n*244 - Total LBAs Read Expanded\n\n*249 - NAND Writes (1GiB)\n\nAn LBA is a Logical Block Address which is a 48 bit address to a specified data block.  Data blocks vary in size depending on the OS; macOS HSF+ uses a 16KB block.  In other words, on macOS formatted with HFS+ it uses 16KB to hold a 1KB file and 32KB to hold any file greater than 16KB but less than 32KB.\nCan you access this data?\nIt depends.  (Again) Technically speaking, you can send an ATA command to the drive to read the data identified by the relevant \"words\".  However, it's unlikely you're going to get this info.  Why?\n\n*\n\n*The drive must support it\n\n*macOS doesn't allow you to get it.\n\nPulling the attributes for a (random) Seagate Drive from the smartmontools website, you can see that the relevant words aren't defined.\nSecondly, even if the data existed and you were to write your own application to send custom AT commands, macOS wouldn't allow you to do so.\n\nBy design, OS X does not allow applications to send SCSI or ATA commands to storage devices unless the application developer also\nprovides an in-kernel device driver that supports the commands. The\nSCSI Architecture Model family allows only one logical unit driver to\ncontrol a device at a time and provides in-kernel logical unit drivers\nfor storage devices (as listed in SCSI Architecture Model Family\nDevice Support). Similarly, the ATA family does not allow applications\nto send ATA commands directly to ATA or SATA (Serial ATA) devices.\n\nHow do we know this is the case?\nUsing DiskDrill on my internal SSD, this is the limit of attributes that are provided by the OS.\n\nPracticality of Total Write Operations\nIt's not practical to gather this type of info.  Taking a extreme-case-scenario - a data center running high availability, mission critical SQL (Oracle, MySQL, MSSQL) servers - our concern is not how much data is written, it's how fast and how reliable the drives are.  What we look for is\n\n*\n\n*are the IOPS high enough?\n\n*what's the read/write errors low?\n\n*is the warranty coverage still in effect?\n\nIn other words, if the drive has high enough performance and there are no (low threshold) of errors and still under warranty, the drive is in service.  The moment it begins to fail, we swap it out.  Additionally, once the warranty coverage is up, it gets replaced no matter if it has life left (there's a budget component as well).\nBottom line, total number of write operations to a drive is not a critical metric to track.\niostat and other OS tools\nThe problem with this is that it gives you statistics for the current operating system:\n\niostat (input/output statistics) is a computer system monitor tool\nused to collect and show operating system storage input and output\nstatistics.\n\nIn other words, reinstall macOS on a 3 year old, well used SSD and your stats go back to zero.  It's kind of rolling back the odometer on a car - even though it reports 50K miles/kilometers driven, the engine and transmission still have 150K on it.\nTL;DR\nIt's unlikely you're going to obtain this info.\n\n*\n\n*The drive must support the SMART attribute\n\n*Your OS must allow you to obtain the attribute.  On macOS, this information, by design, is simply unavailable\n\n*It's not a practical metric to monitor\n\nFinally, when it comes to drives, whether spinning or solid state, assume they are going to fail.  This is why a sensible backup strategy is much, much more critical than monitoring total writes.\n\nA: You cannot in general track how many writes exactly have been performed on the drive. You would have had to keep track of that statistics yourself somehow.\nSimilarly you cannot in general say how many writes are left, as there's no \"guarantee\" that a drive will fail at a certain point. Nor is there a guarantee that a drive won't fail up until a certain point.\nThe best way to get an approximation of what you want is to look at the SMART attributes on the drive. You can do that with the program \"smartctl\" from \"smartmontools\". If you have homebrew installed, you can install smartmontools with this command:\nbrew install smartmontools\n\nThen afterwards run it like this:\nsmartctl -a disk0\n\n(replace disk0 with the actual physical disk you want to examine - you can find the device names in Disk Utility)\nIn the output from smartctl, you'll want to look at the so called \"Wear Leveling Count\". The raw value at the right tells you how many erase/program cycles each block on the SSD in average has undergone. The erase/program cycles are what wears out the drive eventually.\nIn addition, the number in the column \"value\" will tell you in basically how large a part that number of erase/program cycles is compared to the expected number of cycles that you drive can sustain. Basically this number starts at 100% for a new drive, and counts down to 0% where you would expect the drive to start failing. As mentioned before, drives can and will fail before that point - and they might not fail at that point. However, it is one of the better indicators you have of drive health.\n", "Q: Which audio interface standard (or API) does macOS use? For instance: Windows supports DirectSound & ASIO, Linux supports PulseAudio & Jack, etc.\nA basic google search currently does not seem to answer this basic question.\n\nA: Apple's main low-level Audio Framework / API for macOS 10.0+ is Core Audio .\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudio\n\nFramework\nCore Audio\nUse specialized data types to interact with audio streams, complex buffers, and audiovisual timestamps.\n  SDKs\nOverview\nThe Core Audio framework (which is not an umbrella framework for the other services in Core Audio, but rather a peer) declares data types and constants used by other Core Audio interfaces.

Is is possible to recover this deleted contact, if icloud back up is not turned on?\nI downloaded a recovery software and I can see the deleted contact, but ofcourse these softwares would only allow to recover the deleted contact after a fat price. Since, its just this one contact, I was wondering if there is any alternative solution?\n\nA: iCloud automatically archives the contacts ( there is a max of 10 archives  ). The contacts can be restored via the web browser, even if no iCloud backups is switched on on the device.\nIn the webbrowser, click on settings and then contacts and then restore archived contacts.\nBefore the contacts are restored, iCloud makes another archive of the current contacts. Therefore, after retrieving a lost contact, write down the contact details and then one can go back to and restore the latest archive.\n", "Q: Accessing the AppStore through Notifications Edit If I go to system preferences on my MacBook Pro then the App Store I have to unlock it to access it.

I do not understand this, so I want to ask if this is normal. I do not have allow access when locked turned on on my iPhone.\n\nA: The system preferences are locked since some people need to ensure the settings for the app aren’t changed casually. \nLaunch the App Store application itself from spotlight or the dock or the Apple menu.

I don’t often ask it to play music; usually I just use it as an Airplay speaker for my Apple TV/iPhone/Mac.\nAre there any known bugs that cause it to sometimes stop being able to play music?\n\nA: Aha — I think the solution to this is on Apple’s support forums: https://discussions.apple.com/message/33564794#33564794\nIn short, HomePod seems to be unable to play music directly when it was last used as an Airplay speaker for Apple TV.\nI confirmed that this was what was happening by going into the Airplay screen on my iPhone (open Control Center, and force-press on the Airplay icon in the audio control widget).

Hidden files are ignored.  It then filters all of these items to isolate only those with a file extension matching a pre-determined list of valid extensions supplied.  The filtered array of files is then iterated through one-by-one to rename each file according to your already-stated specifications (more about this below).  If needed, the renamed files are moved to a new location, organised under a top-level directory specified by the supplied filepath that points to an existing folder on your system.  The files are sorted into subfolders labelled by year, e.g. \"1994\".  If the subfolder does not exist, it is created.  Pre-existing files were not overwritten in my testing, but this may be dependent on your version of AppleScript and macOS.\nUtilising This Script: You can copy and paste this script into Script Editor and run it from there.  There are four user-defined properties near the top of the script that you can (and should) edit to your needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*rootdir: The top-level folder of the directory tree within which the image files to be processed are located.  The files can be located in the top-level folder itself, or in any sub-directory contained therein.  This should be a posix path (slash notation), and using a tilde (~) to represent the home directory is fine, as would be a full filepath.\n\n*imgTypes: A list of file extensions (without the leading period) that will be used to discriminate the types of files to be processed.  The images in your screenshots all have extension \"tif\", so you can leave this property as it is, or add extra extensions if needed, e.g. \"gif\".\n\n*moveFiles: yes to have files relocated to a single folder after being renamed; no to leave them where they are (don't put quotes around yes or no).\n\n*moveTo: The destination directory to where the images will be moved and organised into subfolders after renaming.  If moveFiles is set to no, this property is ignored and won't affect anything in the script.  Otherwise, the path supplied must, once again, be a posix path to an existing folder, which can be the same as rootdir, or any other folder on your system.  The subfolders for the images need not exist beforehand, as these will be created on a per need basis by the script.\nA Few Warning Guidelines: Note that this script uses System Events to handle the file renaming and moving.  Therefore, there are no undos.\nUnless you're confident with AppleScript (and specifically AppleScriptObjC) and regular expressions (used in reformatting the filenames), I'd advise against editing any other parts of the script yourself.  Doing so would likely just cause the script not to work, which would be fine; but it might instead end up processing and renaming files you didn't intend it to, and you don't want that.\nFor this reason, I would also suggest you trial this script on a small set of dummy files and folders yourself to ensure it does do what you are wanting before you apply it to your actual files.  It's also worth making a backup of your photographs beforehand, just to be extra safe.\nAll warnings aside, I don't anticipate any problems if I've understood your needs correctly, and you've understood what this script is designed to do.  If you're not sure, feel free to ask for clarification.\nI've tested it on files with file name variations, and various distributions throughout a nested set of folders without no issues.  (But, naturally, this only means there are no issues under the conditions that I was able to think up).\nHow Files Are Renamed: If a file is to be renamed, it's current filename must contain a six-digit number representing a 20th-century date in the format ddmmyy.  If there are more than one occurrences of a six-digit number pattern in the filename, it is the first occurrence that is assumed to be the date string.  The rest of the filename can be anything, both before and/or after the date string, e.g. \"%prefix% %ddmmyy% %suffix%.tif\".  Neither the prefix nor suffix part of the filename, nor the spaces, are mandatory, so a filename consisting simply of \"%ddmmyy%.tif\" is considered valid for processing.  The filename is then reformatted by swapping the positions of the prefix (if present) and the date string, leaving the rest as it is.  The date string is also reformatted into ISO-standard international date format, i.e. yyyy-mm-dd.  This includes the hyphens (let me know if you want the hyphens omitted, as I know this wasn't part of your original specification, but it's standard filenaming practice to have them present).  To summarise the filename change by way of examples:\n① \"Editorial Com Mins 080594 003.tif\" → \"1994-05-08 Editorial Com Mins 003.tif\"\n② \"1994-05-08 Editorial Com Mins 123456.tif\" → \"1956-34-12 1994-05-08 Editorial Com Mins.tif\"\n③ \"080594.tif\" → \"1994-05-08.tif\"\n④ \"1994-05-08 Editorial Com Mins 02.tif\" → \"1994-05-08 Editorial Com Mins 02.tif\"\n\nNote in the second example that the filename might already have been formatted appropriately to begin with, however the presence of a six-digit number pattern meant that it was processed by the script.  However, in the fourth example, the absence of a six-digit number pattern leaves the filename unchanged.\n\nA: I would highly recommend downloading Name Mangler by Many Tricks.\nI am entirely capable of writing scripts to rename files/folders, but I use Name Mangler instead. Why? \nThree reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Name Mangler will give you a preview of what the files will look like after your renaming step(s) have been taken (and the renaming scripts can have any sort of regex-type needs you might have)\n\n*Name Mangler will let you string together several steps, if needed.\n\n*Name Mangler will let you undo changes, if something goes wrong.\nNo connection to the company, just a happy customer.\n", "Q: What does the 'J' icon on a photo in the Photos app mean? For some reason on some of my photos there is this 'J' icon:\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nA: Source:\n\nWhen you shoot RAW + JPEG the Photos app stacks the two images together. The J means you have a stack with a JPEG file and a RAW file and the JPEG file is used as original. To change to the RAW file go into edit mode (enter) and choose Image - > Use Raw as original.

I plugged it in to external display: LG 24UD58 24\" via DisplayPort through USB-C\nFor unknown reason Macbook works at 30Hz instead of 60Hz. I managed to achieve 60Hz once somehow by switching between resolutions in Display settings, but I couldn't reproduce this anymore :(\n\n\nHow to achieve 60Hz with external display on Mac?\n\nA: I'm here to offer a different solution. I have a MacBook Pro 15(2018) connecting with LG Ul500 27'4k monitor. I met the same issue that the external monitor worked on 60hz at the beginning but changed to 30hz one day. I thought there might be something wrong with my cable, so I changed it with one of higher quality and price. But the situation didn't change. Then here comes the solution.\nI enter the menu of my monitor and tried to reset it to the initial settings. Boom. Problem fixed. It's working on 60hz right now.\n\nA: I had the same issue for a long time. At first, 60Hz worked. Then something happened and I'd only get 30Hz on my 4K Lenovo ThinkVision 27\".\nI stumbled upon this article and simply went to Display settings and hit \"Resolution: Default for display\". Immediately the display switched to 60Hz. Then I could reapply my Scaled text size setting and 60Hz remained.\nWhat an unsatisfying fix!\n\nA: The Mac should automatically set itself to 60 Hz when available. Otherwise you can select 60 Hz from the drop-down titled \"Refresh Rate\".\nIn your screen shot that drop-down is greyed down, because it only has one option (30 Hz). This means that the Mac has not detected that the cable and monitor are cable of 60 Hz refresh rate.\nAs the monitor supports 60 Hz and your Mac does so as well, all points to the cable. Please try again with another cable, and make sure you buy a quality cable that supports bandwidth enough for 4k @ 60 Hz.\n\nA: Okay, so I used another USB-C port and it worked! Apparently the right front port in my laptop doesn't support 60Hz, I don't know why\n\nA: Try EasyRes app from the app store.\nOne of my 4K monitors get 30Hz when I connect 2 4K monitors to my MacBook pro.\nThe 2 monitors works fine together on Windows.\nApple Support doesn't help.\nEasyRes fix the problem with 1 click.\nGiven that all hardwares are capable (monitor, computer/GPU, cable).\n\nA: Adding another solution: I have 2019 MBP with four thunderbolt ports, and a Levovo LEN T27p-10 monitor which seemed to work only 30Hz.\n60Hz starts towork if I switch USB Source Selection in the monitor settings from USB 2.0 to USB 3.0, and then back to USB 2.0 again. If you already had it as USB 3.0 just switching to USB 2.0 is probably enough.\nI need to do this every time the monitor shut down from the power button. Mac sleep mode doesn't seem to trigger the problem.\nAnnoying, but at least I finally found a reliable workaround.\n\nA: For BigSur 11.x (I'm on 11.6), my display was on HDMI 2.0 UHD but BigSur was pumping out at 30 Hz. I couldn't find any other option BUT this worked\nGo to system prefs -> Display -> CMD+click on the \"Scaled\" radio box to see hidden UI options. Enable \"Show low resolution modes\" > to see the resolutions I could select there was another check box for \"Show Low resolution modes\". Now the hidden \"Refresh rate\" drop down should appear. Select 60 Hz :)\n\n\nA: I had this problem with a different brand of display. I resolved it by changing the Display Port Version 1.1 to 1.2 in the monitor's on screen display menus.\n\nA: I also had an issue where I have three 4K monitors setup to a MacBook Pro and at one point my left most monitor switched to the Resolution setting \"Default for Display\" (I normally always have them set to \"Scaled\" and have the middle option selected\").\nI then changed the resolution to Scaled and chose the middle option to match the other two monitors. Upon doing so, the monitor went into 30Hz mode and I got a laggy mouse. The thing that worked for me was change the offending monitor back to \"Default for display\" and then do that for the other two monitors.\nNext, I went to the left most monitor and I set the resolution to Scaled again (middle) and then I did the same for the other two monitors and everything went back to normal; all three monitors were now at 60Hz!\n\nA: I am using a Samsung LU28R55 as external display with my 2020 13\" MacBook Pro.\nI have been suffering from the same problem (external display running at 30Hz, no matter the resolution). Interestingly, switching the external monitor's resolution to \"Default for display\" had no effect.\nI had to do it for both the external and the internal display (I run pretty high resolutions on both). Then both displays switched to 60Hz and everything has been working fine since then.\n\nA: I'm using MacBook Pro 2019 with Asus PA278CV ProArt monitor which supports 75 Hz (2560x1440).\nI have noticed one important thing that you also need to keep in mind - if you're using only one USB-C cable to connect your laptop and monitor it's important to understand how much power your monitor can deliver via USB-C cable.\nIn my specific case my monitor can deliver only 60 W - so that's enough only to run monitor at 30 Hz! When I have connected OEM charger to the laptop and reboot it again - 60 and 75 Hz options were available. So check if your laptop has enough power to run the monitor at high Hz.\n\nA: If you're a victim of Apple and forced to use dongles, then check your dongles. My dongle was not capable of running display on 60Hz.. only on 30Hz. Had to get usb-c <-> Display Port connecter to get 60Hz.\n\nA: I was able to resolve this issue on my 2018 MacBook Pro by getting rid of my HDMI cable which was connected via dongle/adapter and switching to DisplayPort which is connected directly via USB-C.\nIn my case this means the issue could have been:\n\n*\n\n*The quality of my HDMI cable, but I tried 2 before switching the setup\n\n*The adapter itself, however, I also tried 2 before going to DisplayPort\n\n*The Mac in this case could just be playing nicer with DisplayPort\n\n", "Q: Starting applications, `open` vs mouse click What is the fundamental difference, for .app-bundles/applications, between \n\nopen Application.app\n\nin a bash-shell and opening it by clicking on it in for example Finder or the dock? \nIt seems the environments are slightly different, at least in Mojave, which causes low-level differences in AppKit-resources.

When I plug my Mac  into a DisplayPort monitor that has loudspeakers, the Mac's volume controls become disabled.  \nIs Apple assuming that if I have external speakers I am so much better using their own volume control that I have to be forced to do it?   That is annoying because the monitor's volume controls are buried in terrible menus accessed by terrible buttons on the back of the monitor.\nAlso, if I am inside an app where I can select the audio device and I select the Mac's internal speakers, the volume controls are STILL disabled.  Is there no way to control the volume of an app when an external speaker is connected even if the app is not using the external speaker?????\nSome additional info: It's a Macbook Pro 13\" 2018 version.

In another location I use the same cable to plug in to Dell monitors with Displayport but without built in speakers in the monitors.   At that location the volume controls remain active and they control the internal speaker in the laptop as they should. \n\nA: It's because Apple computers don't support CEC (Consumer Electronics Control).\nBasically, macOS doesn't allow you to control end devices attached via HDMI or DisplayPort.  Changing the volume would be considered \"controlling the device\"\n\nA: And there is an app for that,\nbuild in to your OS X.\nIn the utility folder >> Audio MIDI\ntry it, you will like it !\nIt will allow you to have simultaneous output to multiple devices.\nI could not test it for your set up so let me know if it worked.\n\n\nA: I did the 14 day trial of SoundControl which did work, but I wasn't really willing to pay $15 for something that I feel should be available out of the box for all MacOS machines. \nAfter some more digging I came across eqMac2.

There is a discussion about it.\nSo my suggestion is try MonitorControl, if that does not work use Proxy Audio Device.\nMonitorControl did not work for me for some reason - I'm using a TESmart KVM switch and a Dell monitor. Volume control works fine on Windows so I assume either there's some quirk in MonitorControl, or Windows is actually not using CEC.\nProxy Audio Device seems to work pretty well so far.\n\nA: One solution: use external monitors connected to the monitor's audio out jack.  Then you have volume control.  If using headphones then add a headphone volume control pass through on the wire.\n\nA: If an App allows you to select its output device, and you select one that allows volume control, you CAN control it even when a DP or HDMI monitor is connected.  This is contrary to what I said in this question and contrary to my comments to the Accepted Answer.  Perhaps this was fixed in the last two years or perhaps I was wrong when I wrote the question and comments.\nHere's the complication and how you do it, that works today with Catalina and I think also worked with later versions of High Sierra.\nSay you have your master audio output device set to \"Monitor 2\" (a DP monitor) and you have an app with it's own selectable audio output set to \"USB Speaker\", which allows volume control from the Mac's UI.   In order to control that volume you have to first change the master Audio output to USB Speaker.  If some other app that doesn't have its own device selection is making sound through the monitor, it will also switch to the USB speaker.  But then you can modify the speaker's volume.\nSwitching between devices in the master controller will show you and allow you to control each device's volume, it's only the DP and HDMI ones will be greyed out.\n\nA: Not perfect but you change master volume: \nShift + Option  +  ⬆ \nor  \nShift + Option  + ⬇\n", "Q: MacPorts: Install non-dependencies past error Introduction\nAt times, MacPorts fails to build something because of an error. Previously, @tyilo asked on AskDifferent how to ignore these error and continue installing the other ports (link). Although some answers suggested using the -p flag, MacPorts dev (@ClemensLang) said that this should not be done because it can mess up things later. \nFair enough: it makes sense to not ignore errors when building a package that depends on a failed update. \nHowever, there are several packages that I imagine I could safely update because they do not depend on the package that failed to build. I expect that there is a way to update everything possible, but when an error is encountered, to skip that package and anything that depends on it. \nFor example\nSuppose I have the following packages to update with the following dependencies: \n\n\n*\n\n*apple depends on flower\n\n*tree depends on seed\nSuppose that flower fails to update. Therefore, I should not use -p  because it would continue trying to update apple and the others, and building apple based on a botched flower could cause problems. \nI expect there should be a way such that if flower fails, MacPorts can ignore apple and flower, but continue building seed and tree. \nIs there a \"best-practice\" way to approach this situation? If not, why not?\n\nA: I suppose that you could do this-\nsudo port -v upgrade outdated and not rdependentof:flower and not flower\n\nWhich says in english, upgrade outdated packages but not those dependent on flower and not flower \nOf course you would do this after making a copy of the failed install log then cleaned the tmp location and tried to upgrade again,and if that failed then file a ticket.\n", "Q: Is there a way to get OSX Finder to search through .ts (textscript) files? I really like using OSX's finder to quickly find a particular file and its content based on search, I need to work on in my web projects. We often have 100s upon 100s of separate files and I need to quickly find files quickly. \nOSX's Finder works on .html and .scss files wonderfully on my system. However, it doesn't seem to want to search inside of .ts files. Is there a way to enable this in OSX? \n\nA: Unfortunately Quicklook and Spotlight need to know how to look into a \".ts\" file. Sounds like they are (essentiually...) a text file but you need a way to tell macOS that.\nOver on Stack Exchange there was an answer to a similar question that might be of help to you. It does involve a project on GitHub and may involve some programming skills on your part to make it work with \".ts\" files, but it seems like a start, at least...\n\nA: You can try the app EasyFind. This app is free on the app stores and you can tell it the extension of the files you want to do a text search. It's a very useful app to search your disk and files. When you start EasyFind click on the Settings icon in the top left corner of the EasyFind pane. It's there that you tell the app to search on .ts files.  \n\nA: This has been a life saver for me.

Recently on MacOS 10.13.6 I have noticed high CPU usage and identified the process YaraScanService as consuming close to 90% CPU.\nThe Activity Monitor lists it under:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/MRT.app/Contents/XPCServices/YaraScanService.xpc/Contents/MacOS/YaraScanService\nas part of the MRT.app.\nAccording to this thread and another one it appears to be some kind of Apple's built-in antivirus that is doing its scanning yet there doesn't seem to be a way to disable or remove it apart from killing it from the Activity Monitor or with pkill.\nAny pointers on how to control it or stop/disable it?\nI would assume that if you have dozens of gigabytes of zip, tar, bzip, rar, jar archives then yarascan will unpack them all to memory or disc in order to scan them, and there is absolutely no way to whitelist or exclude them.\nThe MRT.app is timestamped on 10-Aug-2018 along with a bunch of other folders (apparently the date when I accepted an Apple update). Most files inside the folder are timestamped 4-Jul-2018 and 8-Jul-2018, supposedly when the app was released by Apple. \n\nA: As mentioned in this article YaraScanService is part of the MRT.app (Malware Removal Tool). If you are sure your system is not infected with malware and you don't want Apple to do automatic malware protection for you without asking your consent, then you can disable and/or remove the MRT service using these commands:\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.mrt\nsudo launchctl remove com.apple.mrt\n\nThe corresponding .plist files are apparently located at:\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.MRTd.plist\n/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.MRTa.plist\n\nIf the above method does not work for you (apparently the daemon can re-enable itself), then a more radical approach would be to disable SIP with csrutil disable from recovery mode, and remove executable permissions on the MRT and YaraScanService files with:\nchmod -R -x+X /System/Library/CoreServices/MRT.app\n\nOnce you have changed the permissions it is recommended to re-enable SIP again with csrutil enable (from recovery mode).\n\nA: Answer originally posted by user1901982 in Super User - What is “YaraScanService” that shows up in macOS Mojave Beta (10.14) and macOS High Sierra (10.13.6)?\nCopied here for convenience, as community wiki.\nMRT/YaraScan is a MacOS prodvided antivirus-copyright tool. The reason for it's obscene memory usage is basically why OSX doesn't have a formal 'antivirus'.\nMore simply, YaraScan is one part of the 'volatility suite' here; https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/about\nDo realise that a virus and illegally pirated material both are only detected by a 'signature' set of code paths and both often reliant on bugs, exploits and weak patching, so it's only to be expected that the strongest modern antivirus was grown from a copyright infringement detection tool. \nYaraScan runs once after Mojave update, and then deletes itself. The reason it uses so much memory is because unless otherwise programmed (as in it's an opt-out), a process that has to scan an incredible amount of file's contents for an unknown sized file that might be encrypted into said searched files will use a large amount of inactive memory to store all scanned files for a limited amount of time incase they are needed again. Why? Because empty RAM is wasted RAM, I mean you still have to give it watts so why delete the stuff on it when something else doesn't want to be there? It takes 100x longer to get it back.\nMore importantly, if you Filevault or APFS, some of that data is encrypted and must be decrypted to be read. Many apps actually need launching and then scanning when they are loaded as many files can come together to form a threat in memory space as a single 'concurrent file'. Standard antivirus could not detect this until the application was already running, and at that stage it could have already damaged your system.\nThe amount of time is actively decided by Grand Central Dispatch in your mac and as soon as you attempt to use a program that needs that RAM it will clear it.\n\nA: Recently, I upgraded an iMac from 10.12.6 to 10.13.6 and was experiencing many freeze ups, usually 6 or 7 minutes after start up. YaraScanServices was the culprit. But instead of disabling or trying to remove MRT, I found a solution from the internet to remove all files from my download directory and restart normally. This did the trick for me. Since I backed up all files prior to the upgrade on a remote disk, I was able to copy all the files back to the Download directory after the initial scan was able to complete. There is a risk that the unscanned files contain viruses, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nA: \"Having lived with 10.13.6 (as far as I could take my hw) and the nightmare of yarascanservice (using Automator to script a 'forced quit' of the service shortly after every start up), I also ran in to major issues being unable to install Security Updates (corrupting the OS - widely experienced, thanks Apple). I therefore had to avoid any aspect of auto-updating taking place, and may have over-tinkered with System Preferences. System Preferences / App Store - among the various options that I had defeated, a badly worded option is: 'Install system data files and security updates' I came across an article on tidbits explaining what function this option served, recommending to enable it (https://tidbits.com/2016/03/30/make-sure-youre-getting-os-x-security-data/). It appears that this enables updates to MRT (which drives yarascanservice). Despite the clumsy naming used, this does not cause major security updates to the main OS to occur - simply low level updates (similar to updating definitions in a virus application). I had this option disabled. Enabling it, and forcing the system to run these updates, I confirmed that new data had been downloaded (see link above for directions). Ever since (4 days ago), I haven't seen yarascanservice running. This may be coincidence, but I'm curious to determine if this has resolved a similar issue for others?\"\n--- Followed this. Worked for me. Enabled the \"Automatically Check for updates\" and \"Install system data files and security updates\" options under 'App Store' in 'System Preferences'. I don't see Yarascanservice after 2-3 days.\n", "Q: Is there any screen with resolution of 3440x1080 that is supported by a mid 2012 13\" MBP?

I tried deleting lots of huge files and folders (more than 20 or 30 GB of them) but I still got the complaint and the free space does not increase. It seems like what I deleted has become purgeable content instead of free space. \nHere is my storage overview:\n\nCool, more than 60GB of available space. Not quite, here is what is shown in my disk utility:\n\nOkay, more than 60GB are purgeable. No matter how many files I deleted from the system, the purgeable content is increased, not the free space.\nDo you know what is going on? I suspect it is related to the encryption process because it is running at the moment (the progress is 80% at the moment), but I am not sure.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Oddly enough I had just under 60GB of purgable space.\nI read around and found a few posts where people mentioned creating large files as once you ran out of space osx would start using purgable space. It works but you don't need to!\nYou can run bootcamp assistant- it will remove local time machine backups AND icloud cached content. Not only did i get my 60GB purgable space back, but i got an additional 60GB.\nConsidering I'm on a 250GB SSD and want to dual boot, extremely pleased. Hope this helps!\n\nA: The purgeable space is your main issue. I don't know how the failed encryption is going to complicate things but you can use the info at the following link to get rid of your purgeable space:\nhttps://www.jackenhack.com/mac-os-remove-purgeable-high-sierra/\nBest of luck.\n\nA: As I doubted, it was the Encryption which caused the issue with purgeable space. Basically, when your Mac is encrypting the disk, you cannot remove some big files to get free space (perhaps they are being encrypted and Mac do not remove them immediately). Because of my low free disk space, the encryption is taking so long to complete. I patiently waited for it to finish and all purgeable space become free space automatically (it is now more than 60GB).\n", "Q: Software Update command (on Mac) not listing all the updates On regular basis, I check for OS and App updates using terminal and softwareupdate command\nRecently, there was update of Slack app but command output didn't show the same. I was able to view update on AppStore.\nBelow was the output of the command.\n\n$ softwareupdate -all\nSoftware Update Tool\n\nFinding available software\nSoftware Update found the following new or updated software:\n   * Command Line Tools (macOS High Sierra version 10.13) for Xcode-10.0\n    Command Line Tools (macOS High Sierra version 10.13) for Xcode (10.0), 190520K [recommended]\n   * Safari12.0HighSierraAuto-12.0\n    Safari (12.0), 78915K [recommended]\n\nAny reason why Slack update was not listed? Am I missing any parameter?\n\nA: softwareupdate only handles updates to the OS and bundled software, not purchased (/free) apps. The distinction isn't always obvious; the clearest way I have to describe it is that if an app is tied to (/owned by) a particular Apple ID, then softwareupdate won't handle it. Safari and iTunes are examples of apps that just come with the OS, therefore aren't owned by any specific Apple ID, and therefore are handled by softwareupdate. On the other hand, Slack is an app you \"purchase\" (it's free, but it's still technically a purchase) under your Apple ID in the App Store, therefore softwareupdate does not handle it.\nAndrew Naylor has written a CLI interface to deal with App Store purchases (including updates), available from https://github.com/mas-cli/mas.\nUpdate: in macOS Mojave, the distinction is clear in the GUI as well as at the command line. In Mojave, the App Store interface only handles updates to \"purchased\" apps, while OS and bundled software updates are handled by the Software Update pane in System Preferences. So \"Software Update\" preferences == softwareupdate command, and \"App Store\" application == Andrew Naylor's mas command.\n", "Q: Siri shortcuts voice input Is there a possibility to make voice input with Siri shortcuts? I haven't found it. What I want to do is to create a new todo item on my todo app in my case trello, but I don't want to manually type the todo item in, but dictate it via voice. Say \"trello new card: [INPUT]\" and then it creates the card. Is this possible? Also to send a message it would be nice to be able to have voice input.\n\nA: Yay my first Shortcuts question!\nUse the Dictate Text action.  \n\nThis action will convert words you speak into to text and pass that text to the next action.\nCurrently, there is a bit of down side: You will not be able tell Siri in one sentence \"Tell [Shortcut Trigger], Apples are cool\" Instead you need to do it in two parts \"[Shortcut Trigger]\" wait... \"Apples are cool\".\nWarning: Make sure to pick a language or it will silently fail. \n\nA: To add to the answer regarding dictation: if you need to pass numbers, you can use Match (regex) combined with Get Numbers:\n\nThe reason you need Match is because if you use Get Numbers by itself, and you speak a phrase with words and a number in it (needing only the number), Get Numbers will not return the number. It will return Yes/No (True/False) indicating if there is a number in the input.\nTherefore, you use Match to find the number itself in the passed input and pass THAT result to the Get Numbers function. Dictation will spell out the numbers one-nine, and use integers for 10+, hence the regex that I used. Here is the plain text for copy/paste:\n(one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|[\\d]+)\n\nYou don't need either of the Show Results in your shortcut; I've included them so you can see the input as it moves through the shortcut.\n\nA: I passed through a calculation adding 0 to the text to convert from text to a number\n", "Q: prevent Lock Screen from showing user FullName Is there any way to prevent the lock screen from displaying my full name?    \nIt's a privacy matter and I would like to keep my personal data away from other people.\nI know I can turn my screen off, but if someone tries to unlock my computer, she/he will be able to read my Surname.\nIt's also a Company machine, so I have to keep my full name in the system settings, I cannot change the name within the system.   \nI would only like to not show the user surname in the lockscreen.    \nCan it be done?\n\nA: Try this in Terminal\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow HiddenUsersList -array-add user1 user2 user3 user4\n\nChange user1 and/or user2 ect. to actual user name\nIf there is only one user drop the others\n", "Q: What is the safest way to shut down a Mac which is stuck at the screensaver? I use a MacBook Pro for work.  According to my workplace's policy, when I leave my desk, I lock the screen.  There's a bug in MacOS High Sierra where sometimes when I come back and unlock the screen, the screensaver is showing and can't be dismissed.  The laptop is therefore unusable.\nThe only way I have found of getting back into my mac is to hold the power button down until the laptop shuts down.  But this isn't a safe shutdown; if I have any Parallels VMs running they are usually corrupted and I have to restore them from backups.\nIs there a safer way shut down, or otherwise get back into, my Mac?  If so, what is it?\n\nA: A couple potential ideas:\n1. Try to avoid the Screen Saver Bug: Turn off the screen saver (set it to “Never”) and just adjust the Energy Saver to turn the screen off to prevent burn-in. You can still lock the screen with ⌃⌘Q\n2. Alternate Login Methods: If allowed, turn on Screen Sharing and/or Remote Login in System Preferences » Sharing and see if you can login with your phone using ssh or vnc (I recommend Prompt and Screens, respectively).\n3. Sleep Instead Of Lock: Enable a “Hot Corner” to put the Mac to sleep instead of just locking it with the screen saver. Not as convenient as just locking it and walking away, as it will take a little longer to wake from sleep, but if it doesn't trigger the bug, it would be worth it, perhaps?\n\nA: I would recommend you to have a look at Apples own help pages, i.e. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236\nSpecifically these two are of use:\n\nOption–Command–Power button or Option–Command–Media Eject : Put your Mac to sleep.\nControl–Shift–Power button or Control–Shift–Media Eject: Put your displays to sleep.\n\nPutting the mac to sleep usually clears issues like the screensaver issue.

Same if I go to my Apple ID - > Family Sharing -> Screen Time (under Shared Features).\n\nA: Here is the support article on the topic: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982\nThe part that stands out to me is this:\n\"To use Screen Time with Family Sharing, you need to be the family organizer or parent/guardian in your family group, on iOS 12.

I enjoy the new Downtime feature in iOS 12 that’s been added as part of the broader Screen Time feature. I used it to set my whole workday as Downtime, so that I will be discouraged from using my iPhone while working. \nI find that this feature makes it really hard to use Safari, however, as every website I visit shows a “Time Limit” screen. I can ignore the time limit for 15 minutes, which would be fine if I just had to do it once as I only use Safari for short breaks away from work. The “Time Limit” screen, however, appears independently on every domain I visit. \nIt’s possible to set time limit for each domain you visit frequently via the Screen Time overview for your device, however downtime seems to override this. \nIt’s also not possible to set Safari as “Always Allowed”, nor to manage this specific setting for any of the invidual domains. \nIs there a way to whitelist domains, or preferably the entirety of web browsing using Safari, using Screen Time? I imagine a potential solution is switching to Chrome, but I’m curious about a solution that lets me use Safari. \n\nA: Best option: Download Firefox (or another browser) and enable that during downtime.  You may additionally set a Daily time limit for Firefox to stop you from going overboard using it.\nScreenTime is very confusing.  I found https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/ios-12-screen-time-limits-specific-apps/ to be helpful in using it.  \nIf you turn on Downtime, you can't use anything on your phone except apps you add to Always Allowed and apps you add to App Limits.\nBut Safari is special.  It wants to respect Downtime on every webpage you try to visit, and it seems whitelisting does not work properly for these.  This is why adding a different browser app bypasses the problem.  You do lose the per-page restrictions when you do this, and I guess the partial answer to to that is to limit Firefox to a certain amount of minutes overall, and return to Safari after downtime is over for website-restricted browsing.\n\nA: Simple answer: it’s not possible. I don’t understand how anyone at Apple could release this feature with Safari missing from the list of apps\n\nA: Edit: see the other answers for downtime; a similar problem can occur from using App Limits, but resolving it only helps outside downtime.\nI think the problem is in the categories that you have selected.\nFor myself, the technology website WindowsCentral.com will also be blocked if I tick the  “All Social networking” in the App limit categories.\nThe workaround is pretty simple in iOS 13,\nGo to Setting-> Screen Time -> App Limit -> Edit List -> deselect the current selection and instead, pick the app that you want to be limited individually.\nFor example, Facebook.com will be blocked in the Safari if the “All Social Networking” category is ticked.\nIn contrast, Facebook.com is allowed if we deselect the Facebook option in the App limit list.\n", "Q: Erased disc incorrectly now I have \"Apple ssd ap0128J Media\" instead of Macintosh HD and broken software I was preparing my laptop for a sell and booted into recovery mode.

So if it is the same glitch I was having it might help you out! \n\nA: I found the same issue in iOS 12, but found that if you swipe right in the notification text message, it will give you the option to open the message app.  If you swipe left, you are given three options; Manage / View / Clear.  Clicking on view only let's you see the message that just came through and allows you to do a quick reply.  But it doesn't open the message app.  Hope this helps. \n\nA: I was having a similar issue and was quite frustrated because I used that function quite a bit. I tried restarting the phone to no avail. UNTIL! I found out the feature is still there and hidden. All you need to do is tap the app icon on the top left of the notification window and it will take you into the app like normal! I was so relived to know this feature was still there. See picture for example:\n\n", "Q: Get two-factor authentication code from terminal? Is it possible to retrieve my Apple ID two-factor authentication code via the terminal instead of the GUI prompt, i.e. via ssh or a bash script? \nI don't own any Apple devices other than a headless Mac mini for iOS development (I am loaning some iOS devices for development, but don't want to mark those as trusted, for obvious reasons).\nRight now, I have to remote desktop into the Mac mini to get the 2FA code whenever I need it. I'd like to be able to at least just ssh, if not set up a bash script to text me when prompted.\n\nA: I came up with a pretty simple solution to this problem using AppleScript that should print the 2FA code:\n#! /usr/bin/env osascript\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    if name of every process contains \"FollowUpUI\" then\n        tell window 1 of process \"FollowUpUI\"\n            click button \"Allow\"\n            delay 2\n            set code to value of static text 1 of group 1\n            log (code)\n            click button \"Done\"\n        end tell\n    else\n        log (\"Couldn't find 2FA window\")\n    end if\nend tell\nreturn\nAdding this to a file and making it executable using chmod +x name_of_file.scpt should create a script that can be run over ssh by executing ./name_of_file.scpt while in the same directory as the file.\nNote: When you run this script over ssh for the first time, the following popup should appear:\n\nSimply clicking \"OK\" should allow the script to run properly.

Since installing Safari 12, I've been unable to get my extensions working. In particular I have no functioning ad blocker, and the primary extension I use, Pocket, (rally the only reason I use Safari at all) doesn't seem to work. In order to prevent Safari from showing repeated warnings each time I launch it, I've cleared out my extensions and emptied ~/Library/Safari/Extensions/. \nHow do I get and ad blocker and Pocket working with Safari 12?\n\nA: The latest Safari update (12.0, Sept 17, 2018) turns off some and and stops supporting other extensions. \nI don't see Pocket on Apple's new list of supported Safari Extensions (https://itunes.apple.com/us/story/id1377753262). That might be why Pocket now recommends that Mac users just use their Mac app: https://help.getpocket.com/article/1042-using-pocket-for-safari\nPocket may update their extension such that Apple starts supporting it again. Until then, there might be a javascript bookmark(let) for saving items to Pocket (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4550) or a Pocket email address to which you can send items to your account (https://getpocket.com/add/).\nUpdate: Some unsupported extensions work again in Safari 12.

My main HD has 222GB in use, and is formated OS X 10.10 Yosemite (latest). I am marrried to 10.10, no time to upgrade.

The pass-code has been entered incorrectly on my iPad so many times that a screen showed up saying:\n\niPad is Disabled. Connect to iTunes\n\nI have tried two methods to restoring the iPad. \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the iPad to the computer. Hold down the home and power buttons at the same time. When the screen goes blank, wait two seconds, then release both buttons.  I went to Itunes and held down the correct buttons until apple recognized iTunes recognized the iPad was in recovery mode.

They now live outside the US, so I doubt they still have an account. \nHow is the information that allows me to automatically connect stored? I was looking in the keychain access app and could not find any stored passwords / keys. For my other computers Xfinity will throw a popup asking me for account information.\nI was hoping I could figure out how to copy the password / validation key information to other computers I own for wifi access on the go. Perhaps it is handled differently, but either way it seemed an interesting question to learn the answer to. Thanks!\n\n\nA: That information is in your keychain.\nJust enter the name of the WiFi in the search box in key chain.\nIf you do not know the name look it up.\nAll the networks that your computer has ever joined are saved in System Preference > Networks > advanced.\nUPDATE.....Xfinity WiFi is not actually called Xfintiy, it is called Comcast.\nUse Comcast when searching in your keychain.\nI just looked up mine and there it is, even so I do no longer use it.\n\nA: and welcome! Like Buscar says, the information is in your keychain.\nHere’s how you find it - go to the keychain manager (my favorite route is Spotlight via CMD-Spacebar, but you could go through the Utilities folder too). In there you can very quickly search for the network - type “xfinity” - if it’s the same as what I’m familiar with, it will be all lowercase like that. \nOnce you find the entry for the network, you can unlock the entry and view the password. Probably the password to unlock it will be the same one you use to log on to your computer’s user account.\nIncidentally - in my experience, you can’t connect to an xfinity hotspot without valid customer account credentials. You might lose access soon... but who knows.\nIt’s also possible that even with this info, another machine would have to provide the customer account info, which you don’t have access to. I hope it all works though. \nFWIW, you can stop it from automatically connecting to the hotspots if you like. Just go to your network settings, highlight and open up the settings for the xfinity network, and turn off “automatically connect to this network.” You won’t lose your login info, you just gain more control over when you’re connectd.\n", "Q: Can I install both High Sierra and Mavericks on my Mac? I have a 2013 MacBook Pro with both Mavericks and El Capitan installed (each on their own partition).\nI now want to use Mavericks and High Sierra, each on their own partition.\nSince High Sierra uses the APFS file system, will this prove to be a problem? Will it conflict with the HFS format use in Mavericks?\nIf there would be a conflict, how could I use both High Sierra and Mavericks on the one MacBook?\n\nA: You do not have to use APFS to run High Sierra. Although, I believe if your internal drive is  a SSD, then the High Sierra installer will try to convert the existing El Capitan partition and El Capitan Recovery partition to a APFS container partition.\nUpgrading El Capitan to High Sierra should not effect Mavericks.\n\nNote: Mojava (macOS 10.14) will be released on September 24, 2018\n\n", "Q: Can ContainerToInvert file be safely deleted? After previously upgrading to High Sierra and converting my boot drive to APFS, I recently migrated to a new (larger) SSD boot drive. While setting that up, Disk Utility gave me an error when restoring from my old volume to the new one \"APFS inverter failed to invert the volume - invalid argument\".\nI ended up using Carbon Copy Cloner to transfer the files which went OK, and I am now running from the new volume. \nHowever I have a file at the root of the drive called ContainerToInvert. It is over 250GB in size, so I'd like to delete it if it isn't needed. \nCan anyone confirm that deleting it won't cause any problems?\n\nA: This often happens after cloning APFS drives using Disk Utility. The size of the file usually relates to the cloned partition size.\nYou can use the following steps to mount the ContainerToInvert file as an APFS container and access all the partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install FUSE\n\n*Download and install xmount1\n\n*Open Terminal (usually located within Applications/Utilities)\n\n*Type sudo mkdir /Volumes/apfs_image/ into Terminal and press Enter (when prompted, enter your password)\n\n*Type sudo mkdir /Volumes/apfs_mounted/ into Terminal and press Enter (when prompted, enter your password)\n\n*Type sudo xmount --in raw <path to ContainerToInvert file> --out dmg /Volumes/apfs_image/ into Terminal and press Enter (when prompted, enter your password)\n\n*Type hdiutil attach -nomount /Volumes/apfs_image/ContainerToInvert.dmg into Terminal and press Enter (when prompted, enter your password)\n\n*Type diskutil ap list into Terminal and press Enter (when prompted, enter your password)\n\n*Type diskutil ap unlockVolume <Disk GUID> -nomount into Terminal and press Enter (when prompted, enter your password)\n\n*Type sudo mount_apfs -o rdonly,noexec,noowners /dev/disk# /Volumes/apfs_mounted/ into Terminal and press Enter (when prompted, enter your password)\n\n*Now you'll have the original partition mounted\n\n*Browse the disk image to inspect the contents and once satisfied there's nothing there you need to transfer across you can unmount and delete the entire .dmg file\n\n\nThe above steps are based on the Mount All the Things! – Mounting APFS and 4k Disk Images on macOS 10.13 blog entry.\n1. If you have trouble installing xmount, then run the following command in Terminal and try again:\n `mkdir -p /Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs/Support/osxfusefs.kext`\n\n", "Q: How can I determine plist changes while changing System Preferences to automate them next time? I am trying to automate the process of setting up a new laptop as much as possible. There are certain changes I always end up making manually on a new Mac, such as enabling screen zooming with the Ctrl modifier and setting up keyboard shortcuts to map ⌘⌥← to \"Select Previous Tab\" in all applications. I’m sure there is a preferences.write equivalent to do this, but gosh darn it, I have no idea how to determine what it is. Can I somehow monitor or \"diff\" my preferences after making the change manually, perhaps?\n\nA: Apple stores most relevant preferences in a database now, so your best bet is to ignore plist files on the filesystem and focus on the output of defaults read com.apple.whatever for the things you change. Unfortunately, there isn't a good Rosetta Stone that says if you are in preference X - look for changes in these seven preference domains. Where Apple stores iCloud or security information doesn't map to each visual icon in system preferences so you'll need to issue more than one defaults read to capture the entire state of most preference panes since most panes write to more than one setting domain.\nAlternatively, you could just use MDM and configuration profiles and scripts to make all changes so that you just push the changes to all machines from your management tool and skip the whole reverse engineering process entirely.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/profile-manager\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/MobileDeviceManagementProtocolRef/3-MDM_Protocol/MDM_Protocol.html\n\n*https://www.jamf.com\n\n*https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/15362/learn-mcx-and-configuration-profile\nIn the past MCX was the path to managing enterprise configurations and that's the equivalent of your wanting to look at the .plist files that stored those settings initially at the dawn of OS X - but the current system of configuration profiles, scripted changes and MDM hooks has left MCX and .plist to just the dusty corners that haven't been updated for the new central database to store user and system defaults.\n\nA: If you know the file which is being changed, you can compare the output before/after in the terminal in order to find the exact setting name.  For example:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c Print ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist > /tmp/before.txt\n\nAnd, diff /tmp/before.txt /tmp/after.txt to see the items being changed.  But, be careful, because it's likely that the preference you're changing will be buried in the hierarchical structure.\nIf you don't already know the file which is being changed, then you can monitor the Library/Preferences folder with ls -lFat to see the most recently changed files listed first, and you can probably determine which file you're interested in from there.\n\nA: The best way I found is to\n\n*\n\n*Run opensnoop (a program included in macOS that shows which files are opened)\n\n*Change your settings and watch which Preferences folder is accessed\n\n*Go to this folder and sort by modification time\n\n*defaults read file.plist on anything suspicious.\n\n", "Q: SMS forwarded to email just shows up in SMS again?

You can find all this information directly from the netstat  man page (man netstat) or for an excellent primer, see FreeBSD's Handbook Chapter 31.2 - Gateways and Routes. (Apple's netstat is derived from the BSD version).\nFlags\nThe flags field shows a collection of information about the route stored as binary choices. Following is extracted directly from the man page.\n 1       RTF_PROTO1       Protocol specific routing flag #1\n 2       RTF_PROTO2       Protocol specific routing flag #2\n 3       RTF_PROTO3       Protocol specific routing flag #3\n B       RTF_BLACKHOLE    Just discard packets (during updates)\n b       RTF_BROADCAST    The route represents a broadcast address\n C       RTF_CLONING      Generate new routes on use\n c       RTF_PRCLONING    Protocol-specified generate new routes on use\n D       RTF_DYNAMIC      Created dynamically (by redirect)\n G       RTF_GATEWAY      Destination requires forwarding by intermediary\n H       RTF_HOST         Host entry (net otherwise)\n I       RTF_IFSCOPE      Route is associated with an interface scope\n i       RTF_IFREF        Route is holding a reference to the interface\n L       RTF_LLINFO       Valid protocol to link address translation\n M       RTF_MODIFIED     Modified dynamically (by redirect)\n m       RTF_MULTICAST    The route represents a multicast address\n R       RTF_REJECT       Host or net unreachable\n r       RTF_ROUTER       Host is a default router\n S       RTF_STATIC       Manually added\n U       RTF_UP           Route usable\n W       RTF_WASCLONED    Route was generated as a result of cloning\n X       RTF_XRESOLVE     External daemon translates proto to link address\n Y       RTF_PROXY        Proxying; cloned routes will not be scoped\n\nSo, looking at the first entry, the flags are UGSc meaning\n\n*\n\n*U:  RTF_UP - Route usable\n\n*G:  RTF_GATEWAY - Destination requires forwarding by intermediary\n\n*S:  RTF_STATIC - Route added manually\n\n*c:  RTF_PRCLONING - Protocol-specified generate new routes on use\n\nRefs, Use, & Expire\nThe refcnt field gives the current number of active uses of the route.  Connection oriented protocols normally hold on to a single route for the duration of a connection while connectionless protocols obtain a route while sending to the same destination.  The use field provides a count of the number of packets sent using that route.\nExpire is a timeout - a period in which the host doesn't respond to that route.\nMAC Address and Hardware Devices\nThe HEX address that you're seeing for the 10.1.0.10.1/32 network (bc:67:1c:40:3:f6) is a MAC address, not a IPV6 address.\n\n*\n\n*A MAC address is a 48-bit identifier specific to  the hardware written in MM:MM:MM:SS:SS:SS  The first three bytes (MM:MM:MM) identifies (assigned to) the hardware manufacturer and the second three bytes (SS:SS:SS) is assigned to the device by the manufacturer.\n\n\n*An IPV6 address is a 106-bit hexadecimal identifier written as 8 hexidecimal numbers separated by colons:  Example:  2001:0000:3238:DFE1:0063:0000:0000:FEFB\nThe link#4 and link#12 refer to the network device (i.e. Ethernet Adapter, WiFi Adapter, VPN adapter, etc.).\n", "Q: Do iPhone X cases fit on the iPhone XS? Does anyone know whether the iPhone X and the iPhone XS have the exact same measurements as far as cases are concerned?\nI know that the measurements shown on the Apple iPhone compare webpage are the same, but what about the measurements of the camera? Apple does not show this on their website.\nLet's suppose, that the X and the XS have the exact same measurements, then every iPhone X case should fit on the XS, correct?\nBut even if there is the slightest difference between them, there could be some iPhone X cases that can't fit iPhone XS.\n\nA: I've just watched this YouTube video by MKBHD where he reviewed the XS and XS Max and he shows that the X case will fit onto the XS but that the camera lens does not align properly - the new XS camera bump is smaller, so there is a slight gap to one side (not uniformly around unfortunately).\n\nA: Various sources on the Web affirm that iPhone X and iPhone XS are near identical in dimensions and cases for iPhone X should fit iPhone XS.\nHowever, there are also various reports pointing out specific cutouts applicable to certain cases.\nLike, if the camera opening on the iPhone XS is noticeably larger, so if you have a case with a very tight fighting camera opening, your iPhone XS may not fit. One point outs that the placement of microphone vent is slightly different between the two phones.\nThe various reviews are shared below for reference:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Q&A on Apple Online store:\n\n\n\nYes! They have same dimensions and buttons location. So all your cases from iPhone X will perfectly fit iPhone XS.\n\n\n\n\n*Reddit thread, from /r/iphone, PSA: iPhone X Cases Will NOT Fit XS\n\nJust noticed this in MKBHD's review: https://youtu.be/YAF9BWpzwvI?t=2m7s\n  The camera opening is noticeably larger. If you're upgrading from an X to XS, you'll need new cases.\n\n\n\n\n*iMore, Will your old case fit the new iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max?\n\nThe iPhone XS is a refresh of last year's iPhone X, and appears to have the exact same design and dimensions. This means that you should be able to use your old iPhone X case with your iPhone XS. So all those great cases already available for the iPhone X are ripe for the picking!\nThat being said, the microphone layout on the bottom of the iPhone XS is slightly different than the iPhone X, which means cases that have precise cutouts for those microphone holes in the iPhone X, may be slightly misaligned on an iPhone XS.\n\n\n\n\n*iPhone Hacks, Will iPhone X Cases Fit the iPhone XS?\n\nThe answer is a resounding yes! The iPhone XS shares the same dimensions as the iPhone X and since all port locations are also the same, iPhone X cases will fit the iPhone XS just fine. The latter is 3gms heavier than the iPhone X but this difference is unlikely to create any issues for cases with a kickstand or a slim profile.\n\n\n\n\n*CNET, Will my iPhone XS fit in a iPhone X case? Yes!\n\nThe two iPhones have the exact same height, width and depth.\n\n\n\n\n*MacRumors, iPhone X Cases May Have Slightly Imperfect Fit on iPhone XS Due to New Camera Bump Dimensions\n\nWhile the iPhone X and iPhone XS have identical overall dimensions, a new report suggests that iPhone X cases may have a slightly imperfect fit on the iPhone XS due to very slight changes to the camera bump dimensions.\n\n\n\nNote: The official case design guidelines for devices from Apple are made available here. The linked Accessory Design Guidelines containing precise measurements should soon get updated to include iPhone XS. If interested, you can go through the measurements to get a better idea of what aspects have changed between iPhone X and iPhone XS, and case analyze case compatibility.\n\nA: Yes. I have an Apple leather iPhone X case that fits my iPhone XS perfectly.\n", "Q: 3D Touch versus Haptic Touch I’m in the market for a new iPhone and based on Apple’s specs the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max have 3D Touch but the iPhone XR does not. While there is no mention whatsoever of Haptic Touch on their specs page, I have read that the iPhone XR has Haptic Touch instead of 3D Touch. Frustratingly I can’t find anything on Apple’s website about this.\nCan someone explain the differences between 3D Touch and Haptic Touch?\n\nA: At this stage it’s somewhat unclear how many of the functions supported by Apple and 3rd party apps on 3D Touch can and/or will be supported on Haptic Touch.\nAccording to Apple, the iPhone XR:\n\n…doesn’t have 3D Touch, but here again the team came up with something\n  really smart. It has a new feature we call haptic touch. So to get to\n  the camera from the home screen, we just press on it. You feel a\n  haptic tap, and you’re taken right to the camera. This is a similar\n  technology to what we do with the track pad in the MacBook Pro that we\n  all love so much. It is a great experience.\n\nSource: Phil Schiller, Senior Vice President Worldwide Marketing, 12 September 2018.\nWhat does this actually mean?\nThe iPhone XR doesn’t have a pressure sensitive screen, but it does simulate the response that 3D Touch offers in that it provides haptic feedback to the user by way of a vibration instead of an actual haptic engine producing that feedback. But the biggest difference for power users of 3D Touch is that at the outset the user won’t get the additional options offered by 3D Touch. \nFor example, with 3D Touch a hard press on the Clock app will present the user with the following three options: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create Alarm\n\n*Resume Stopwatch; and \n\n*Start Timer. \n\n\nOn the iPhone XR a hard press will launch the Clock app with a slight vibration feedback, but will not provide these additional options. This is akin to having no contextual menu when right-clicking on an item in macOS or Windows, except that with computers the right-click is much loved and used while on the iPhone the usage of 3D Touch has not been so widespread.\nAll that said, it’s unclear if iOS will try to offer some of these same features via the use of long presses instead of firmer presses in future updates. At present though, if you’re a power user of 3D Touch and don’t want to give it up, you’d be better off purchasing an iPhone XS / XS Max  or one of the older iPhone models. \n\nA: 3D touch can detect how hard you push the screen.\nDepending on how hard you push the screen, you can toggle different actions on your iPhone.\nWhenever you use 3D touch, your iPhone gives you haptic feedback (like a tiny vibration).\nWith Haptic Touch you can use the exact same actions and you also get haptic feedback. The only difference is that with Haptic Touch the actions are not toggled by pushing the screen harder, but by pushing and holding on the screen for a little longer time.\n", "Q: App Store on High Sierra suggests Mojave-only updates I'm currently on macOS High Sierra (10.13.6) and I've just received three update notifications from the Mac App Store:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keynote 8.2 update\n\n*Numbers 5.2 update, and\n\n*Pages 7.2 update\n\n\nAll of them are marked with Requires macOS Mojave and iOS 12 note - and when I try to Update any of them or all at once, nothing happens (I've tried to reboot the OS already). I want to stick to macOS High Sierra for now, and as far as I know, macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 will be supported for quite a long period of time, same as all previous macOS versions in the past.\nDo these macOS Mojave only updates suggest that any further iWork office suite updates will support only the latest, upcoming macOS Mojave? How about security and other bug fixes then? What if one wants to stick to macOS High Sierra until its end-of-life but keep all their apps (including iWork) up-to-date (at least when it comes to bug fixes, not necessarily new features)?\nIs is possible to mark these updates as ignored, but still receive any bug-fixing updates e.g. for Numbers 5.1? Does Apple even support its office suite for anything but their newest OS version?\n\nA: The current latest version of the three iWork apps (as mentioned in the question), are supported on macOS High Sierra 10.13 and iOS 11. You are right, that the apps as well as the OS will be well supported into the future.\n1. Pages\n \n\n2. Keynote\n \n\n3.

It works fine while the lid is open, but as soon as I close it, various issues occur.\n\n\n*\n\n*Monitor won't work or receive signal if I unplug MacBook from the charger (monitor has its own power supply).\n\n*Every now and then, monitor will shut/disconnect for a short while and come back online. I checked HDMI connection and everything seems to be fine (new monitor, new cable). What I did notice is that this flickering sometimes happens alongside charger light going off, which I think is related to point #1 above.\nDoes this sound like a bust charger that is going on and off for short periods of time, or something more serious with my MacBook?\nMac is set to never go to sleep be it on charge or battery, so I don't think this is an issue either.\nThis also seems to be unrelated to the option Slightly dim the display while on battery power. Just unchecked it, restarted and I am still getting the same issue.\n\nA: Sounds like you already have the suspects identified (power supply being intermittent, faulty port, faulty dongle (if in use), faulty HDMI lead). If I were you, I'd start a process of elimination. Source another power supply (and/or extension cord, if in use), swap out the dongle/port/HDMI lead. Also, try a different refresh rate/resolution for the display and see if that makes as difference. I'm using an early 2015 MacBook Pro with an Acer UHD4K2K display via display port and the laptop closed. I've had problems with the display not waking at times.\nAlso, check your Magsafe port for debris. Could be dirty contacts making the charging intermittent.\n", "Q: Enable alarm in Shortcuts I'd like to create a bedtime shortcut, which activates my alarms and activate Do Not Disturb on my iPhone.\nWhen I choose the clock app inside the Shortcut creator, I only have the option create alarm, which creates a new alarm every time I run the shortcut.\n\nI want to activate an existing alarm and not create an copy of an existing one.\n\nA: When Shortcuts first came out, I immediately created a Sleepytimes script. Among other things, it enabled Do Not Disturb. After some days of use, I realised that you could also add controls over Bedtime.\nThe two steps you are looking to do go like this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the object Set Do Not Disturb. Set it to ON and the Until to your liking.\n\n*Add the object Edit Bedtime (search for it - if you cannot find it, just launch Clock -> Bedtime a couple of times - hopefully there will be an easier way to get this to show in the future).\nHope this helps! Also, I think I can just share a shortcut with Edit Bedtime in it. Let me know if you are able to access Edit Bedtime by opening this iCloud link - after that you could try and tap on the object and select \"Set favorite\".

What is this traffic and does it affect the performance of my Mac?\n\nA: Time Machine makes a local snapshot during its normal operation - Mobile Time Machine File System (MTMFS) is the process responsible and that is most likely what you're seeing.  You can check Activity Monitor during this time to see the CPU usage from this process (mtmfs).  So yes, it can affect your machine's performance if it's using a lot of your CPU.  (For example, an unrestricted find command on the root will churn through these hidden snapshots causing the process to go nuts.)\nYou can check for local snapshots with the tmutil command (which has a lot of other uses as well)\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n\n", "Q: Time machine over samba, \"The identity of the backup disk has changed\" Samba recently added the ability to host time-machine backups over a local network with version 4.8. I set up an old Seagate goflex with Arch linux and followed this guide to get samba running. It's working except that every time a backup is started on either of my two laptops I get a warning that \"The identity of the backup disk “ArchBackups” has changed since the previous backup.\" and have to click through. Any idea why my mac isn't trusting the backup server? There is this old question but that seems to be a more intermittent problem on an older version of OSX and never got a satisfactory answer.\n\nA: Edit: Find my solution below.\nI have the same problem on Raspian with a Ext4 file system (no LVM). Samba is version 4.8.5, compiled from source by myself. MacOS is High Sierra, backup is encrypted.\nTime Machine pretends to have finished the backup successfully. When it starts the next time, the message about the changed identity appears. After choosing \"backup anyway\", it creates a completely new backup in a new sparse file. (Like @thaimin described it). \nOn the Samba mailing list someone states: \n\nRecompile samba with  --enable-spotlight and all works.\n\nThat is not true in my case, because I did compile Samba 4.8.5 with this option (what I didn't do is setting up tracker as suggested in this blog post).\nWorkaround\nI compiled Samba in the previous version (4.8.4). Now it works as expected (same system, same dependencies, same configuration).\nSomeone already created a bug ticket for Samba. \n", "Q: Touchbar Buttons Is it possible to make buttons on the touchbar activate when I release my finger instead of when I press down? I want them to behave like UI elements in MacOS or web pages.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to make buttons on the touchbar activate when I release\n  my finger instead of when I press down?\n\nThe Touchbar is designed to be an extension of the keyboard not a web UI.  The keyboard, naturally, activates when you depress a key and the Touchbar mimics this functionality.\nThere are ways to change this functionality where something happens once the key is released.  For instance, ControllerMate allows you to send text, keypresses, etc. when the depending on the state of the keypress.  The caveat here is that it's a 3rd party application intercepting the key presses and modifying them.  The default behavior of the keyboard remains unchanged.\nSo, can it be done?  \nIt's possible, but it will have to be done within the application itself.  It's not something that can be modified globally.\n", "Q: Get password prompt in the terminal/shell When I am connecting a Mac through ssh, I don't have any GUI.\nHowever, for some of the commands like security find-internet-password, there will be a GUI prompt for the admin's password.

It's slightly better than with Spotify but still no more than 5% of taps work.\nWhat's could possibly be causing this? I find it hard to believe that these apps would be that bugged. It's my first iPhone ever and I might be doing something wrong?\nI just upgraded from iOS 11 to iOS 12 and it's the same. Reseting phone does not help. The screen seems to be working fine excepting these apps. I'm using glass on the screen but I think it must be a software-related issue. I'm wondering what all these broken apps have in common, do they all use WebView? \nAny ideas? Is there any software that could help me test the screen (like displaying touch pressure full screen etc.)?\n\nA: I realize this is an old question but in case someone else has this issue; the answer about the screen protection is definitely wrong. Yes cheap ones can sometimes do that but the author should have read the original post more clearly. If that were the case it would happen in any app, the fact that some apps do it and others (which are all native apps) don’t is a dead giveaway. Moreover I KNOW that isn’t it because I have the same problem and have never had screen protection on my SE.\nThe most likely culprit here is the apps in question were coded incorrectly in some way. Probably in relation to the size of the region that registers the touch input for that button. I’m just guessing on specifics here as I’ve never coded for an iOS device but the SE runs a much smaller resolution screen than newer devices. If the area were set at a given size which was adequate for a new phone then just scaled down for the SE it might become so small as to have difficulty sensing input. (You see this when people use an automated method to make their program compatible with multiple devices)\nMy advice is simply to send a bug report to the developer of any affected apps.\n\nA: I strongly suspect that the screen guard/protector, temper proof glass is the culprit here. I have personally seen many instances where putting on one of these impacts the touch sensitivity.\nAlso, if you will search the Web, you can find a lot of posts discussing iOS devices having issues registering touch after installing one.\nAlthough, it is not a given that putting a screen guard/protector or temper proof glass will impact touch sensitivity. Maybe it differs from manufacturer to manufacturer and the quality.\nTo diagnose, I'd advise you to remove the temper proof glass, spend some time with your iPhone and see if you can reproduce the issue. I use most of the apps you mentioned and have never experienced the issue (ruling out the possibility of a software issue). I am not advising you to get rid of one permanently, just test it for a while and switch to a different one if you are able to successfully diagnose. Repeat until you find a good one.\nSince you have ruled out of the possibility of iPhone's screen itself faulty (as some apps work fine and some doesn't), the only logical explanation appears to the culprit screen guard.\nThe phenomenon is more noticeable when playing highly responsive games. (Speaking based on personal experience. I play a lot of AAA titles.)\n", "Q: How do I get an AppleScript application to automatically run at login?

Also, could you try using Ethernet to gauge the difference? Is this a laptop? If so, is there a case which could be removed? Any new equipment nearby (ie an electric fan, metal filing cabinet, etc.) which could be disrupting the signal? If it is a laptop, it is entirely plausible that the internal antenna has come loose or damaged (any repair or upgrade work carried out?).\n\nA: First thing I'd do is test the environment.\nYou might need your IT department to help you with some of this, but you can investigate for yourself first & show them your results.\nGet a free WiFi analysis app from the App Store. This pic is from NetSpot [not from App Store], which I run in demo mode, as it does a million things I don't really need - but others are available from the App Store.\nMy Mac is well out towards the back of the building so can only see a few access points from here, unlike at the front where there are over 50 visible. I'm working from here to make all the following simpler to follow.\n\nOpen the pic in a  new window to be able to see detail.  \nOK, the two top devices are mine, TetsXtreme & TetsXtreme 5GHz. This is a single device, but I have intentionally separated it out into distinct access points because the 2.4GHz band is very busy around here [there are another 40-odd APs visible from the front of the building, but I've used this location to keep things simpler.]  \nFirst thing you'll notice is the signal strength on the 2.4 is by far the best; however I mainly use the 5GHz because it has no competition at all - it's the only 5GHz AP in the entire area so I get the whole 5GHz band all to myself.\nShould any device have to use the 2.4 - it penetrates further than 5GHz so can come in handy sometimes; or for devices not capable of 5GHz.\nThe next thing we need to do is check what channel my 2.4 is using... ch 13.\nThis is only available in Europe; the US has ch 1 - 11 only.\nNow, one thing about the channels is that they overlap - I have no idea why someone decided this was a good idea, but that's the way it is.\nThe only truly clear channels are 1, 6 & 11 - all others overlap & therefore can & do interfere with each other.\nThis means that we will predominantly find other devices on 1, 6 & 11. I put mine on 13 a) because I can, no-one else is using it, even if it slightly overlaps with 11 & b) because even the other device I can see on 11 is so faint that it's hardly going to be any issue.\nChannel 6, on the other hand, is choked with devices all interfering with each other. Avoid 6 like the plague in this instance.\nSo, armed with this information about your surroundings, you can see whether your WiFi Access Point is strong & in the clear for channel-clashes.\nThat would be the point at which you might need to go see your IT department & show them your findings; get them to move the AP or change channel, or even separate out the 2.4GHz from the 5GHz so you can choose which is best, rather than have it automatically assigned.\n", "Q: Windows authentication to sql server I need to connect to sql server using Windows authentication on a mac.\nI want to use kinit but I have problem with generate DC name.\nOn windows I ran command: \nnltest /dsgetdc:xx.xx.com \nAnd output is: \nGETTING DS NAME FAILED: STATUS = 1355 0X54B ERROR_NO_SUCH_DOMAIN.\n\nI can log into this server on windows using SQL Server Management Studio so I know the account I want to use is working for the level of access I want to grant.\nHow can I connect with this server to get kerberos tickets / use an AD account in general with Finder to mount shares?\n\nA: We use Apple Enterprise connect to get kerberos tickets \n$ klist\nCredentials cache: API:0E08F2A4-F095-4D1D-82A5-69113AF983D0\n        Principal: bmike@AD.CONTOSO.INT\n\n  Issued                Expires               Principal\nSep 20 11:20:42 2018  Sep 20 21:20:42 2018  krbtgt/AD.CONTOSO.INT@AD.CONTOSO.INT\nSep 20 11:20:42 2018  Sep 20 21:20:42 2018  ldap/xyz-addc01.ad.contoso.int@AD.CONTOSO.INT\n\nYou could use macOS to bind directly, but there's pain there unless you are just binding your personal workstation and not deploying that across an enterprise.

Upon launching such an app for the first time (after the macOS update), user is alerted with this dialogue:\n\nThe list of all 32-bit only apps on macOS can be obtained by going to Apple Menu → About This Mac → System Report... and in the System Information window that opens, go to Software → Applications in the sidebar. In the list of apps presented, click on the 64-Bit (Intel) column to sort and see that entries with No.\n\nIt was widely expected that macOS High Sierra may be the last macOS release to support 32-bit only apps and just like what happened in iOS, such apps will stop working in macOS Mojave 10.14. However, Apple later chose to indefinitely postponed the decision and 32-bit, as of now, continue to work in macOS Mojave 10.14.\nApple support document, 32-bit app compatibility with macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 is work referring. Quoting from the document:\n\nWhen will the 64-bit transition be complete?\nThe 64-bit transition for macOS and macOS apps is still underway, so final transition dates have not yet been established. But now is a good time to check with the software developer to see if 64-bit versions of your favorite titles are available.\n\n\n\nHow do I check if an app is 32-bit or 64-bit?\nFrom the Apple menu, choose About This Mac, then click the System Report button. From the system report, scroll down to Software, then select Applications. When you select an individual application, you will see a field titled ”64-bit (Intel)”. “Yes\" indicates 64-bit; “No\" indicates 32-bit.\n\n\nApps for macOS can be distributed via Mac App Store or independently by the developers. Starting January 2018, Mac App Store stopped accepting new apps and starting June 2018, stopped accepting updates to the existing apps which lack support for 64-bit.\n\nAs a reminder, new apps submitted to the Mac App Store must support 64-bit starting January 2018, and Mac app updates and existing apps must support 64-bit starting June 2018. If you distribute your apps outside the Mac App Store, we highly recommend distributing 64-bit binaries to make sure your users can continue to run your apps on future versions of macOS. The last macOS release to support 32-bit apps without compromise is macOS High Sierra.\n\nAlthough the last line of the developer news quoted that 32-bit app support will be dropped without compromise post macOS High Sierra, that decision appears to have been retracted indefinitely for the time being.\n", "Q: Is there a built-in way to record Mac screen in macOS screen just like iOS?

As a command line utility you won't find ffmpeg in the App Store, as there's no command line support in iOS.\nHowever parts of ffmpeg are also used as a software library (usually in the form of libavcodec) in a wide range of applications, some on iOS as well. For example VLC on iOS uses it to decode and display media files. My searches did not show up unfortunately any good apps that use either ffmpeg or libav for encoding & editing purposes, but it's likely a few of the video editor apps you'll find will use these software packages as their backend.\n\nA: If your device is jailbroken, you can install the ffmpeg package:\n\n\n*\n\n* ffmpeg\nThis package is open source on GitHub nin9tyfour/FFmpeg-iOS-build-script which you can use to build a more recent version and manually install it yourself if the version of ffmpeg provided by this package is insufficient for your needs.\nYou can use the package from the command line using a Terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n* NewTerm 2\nA terminal emulator package, installable with Cydia.\n\nNewTerm is a continuation of the Mobile Terminal project, a versatile terminal emulator for iOS.\n\nYou can also use an SSH app from the App Store, however this requires you to change your SSH port from 22 since iOS prevents localhost access to port 22, so suggestions for apps and instructions are out of scope for this question.\n", "Q: Quick Look not working for CSS and JavaScript files I have installed the QLColorCode plugin from this site, so that I can Quick Look JavaScript and CSS files, but it's not working.

In my experience, the battery backup has remained the same compared to iOS 11.4.1.\niOS 12 on the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPad Mini 2: It’s actually faster!.\nIn-fact, all iOS device released in the year 2013 and later (iPhone 5s, iPod touch 6th generation, iPad Air, iPad mini 2) are eligible to run iOS 12, and, as per Apple, will see noticeable speed improvements due to under the hood performance improvements made in iOS 12.\n", "Q: How to do speaker correction on a MacBook Pro Retina On a MacBook Pro 15inch Retina I find the sound output from the internal speakers to be quite 'strange'. It is like there is too much bass from where the spectrum starts and then as if there are some kind of gaps in the spectrum where middles and highs are somehow absent or underdeveloped. \nThese are small speakers and they are usually judged as quite good for their size. Yet they seem to me part of the wrong side in the loudness war.\nOn older machines I previously used a complicated setup involving SoundFlower and AULabs equalizer settings to correct for some of the perceived deficiencies. \nBesides the cumbersome setup of this surely outdated solution: On these newer machines I cannot arrive at a satisfactory result.\nBut I remembered a few \"audio optimizers\" offered some speaker correction presets for these machines. (Examples would be Boom3D, Hear, eqMac2, Bongiovi DPS…) With the smallest settings I found Boom quite smooth. But that piece of software is unreliable in operation, costs money, and offers a range of other features I do not want or need, and it is even accused of possibly damaging your audio hardware if misused. On top of it the results on this machine are not in that way 'better' as I remember it (and re-tested with an older version just now) from older machines.\nSince I am lacking even the right terminology for this kind of task: \nHow do I approach speaker correction for this machine properly? Are there equalizer presets to start from? Settings perhaps to download somewhere or to copy along the sliders of the band?\nCan these speakers or their response curve really be calibrated (as the setup from one of the software titles seem to suggest) Other software solutions to consider altogether?\n\nNote that I am aware of \"perceived sound quality\" as pretty much opinion based, therefore I am not asking about \"the best setting\" but about the proper approach to this problem in general. The huge difference between the so called \"optimized for this machine\" settings offered by Boom and Bongiovi DPS is testament to the \"opinions differ\" thing as well. \n\nA: Late edit:\nSince writing this, Rogue Amoeba have released a simpler & cheaper app specifically to tailor output rather than provide full internal audio routing & recording - SoundSource. You can set up your EQ or whatever as a global or on a per-app basis, making it very flexible.\n\nI wrote this before checking all the proposed apps in the OP; my issue with these kind of things usually is that I tend to avoid the \"we can do it all for you\" apps, like Boom & Bongiovi; because I always think, \"How can you do all that for me? You can't hear my speakers!\".\neqMac2 does look like a simpler version of what I'm already doing on the first machine example below... for free. You still need ears, or an analyser, but the investment could become 'merely time' rather than actual cost.\n\nPotentially what you could do if you have access to a smart phone is download a free Spectrum Analyser & find a white noise sample or generator online* then use the EQ to flatten the perceived EQ curve as the phone hears it.\nYou could do this with Soundflower & a graphic EQ too, or potentially with eqMac2 - for free.\nThere's a slicker solution than Soundflower, but it's far from free - Audio Hijack - which I use to tame the audio on several machines here, for slightly different purposes.\nI get the feeling it won't be what you're looking for, but it's quick enough to throw in here & see if any future Googlers might like it. I do seem to come across as a one-man campaign for this app, but it's just that it's the best I've found for many similar purposes. I have no affiliation whatsoever.\nIf someone can find a free equivalent, I'm all ears - quite literally ;)\nOne cool thing, though is you can set timers for it - so to get it to be 'always on' I set it for 23h 59m of every day & let that spare minute be when I'm bound to be asleep.\n\nOn one machine, I use it to compensate for cheap external speakers with an odd EQ curve. I simply send all audio through it to flatten the perceived EQ curve.\n\nOn the other machine, I use it to compensate for the very high dynamic range whilst watching movies - which are piped through to my powerful 5.1 system, capable of offending the most tolerant neighbour. I use it to simply keep things within a more acceptable range to suit me & my neighbours...\n\nBoth these setups just use Apple's built-in AU plugins.\nUnfortunately, there is no automatic setting for either of these setups. I do it by ear - but I'm a pro sound engineer & I trust my ears to get it at least close enough to be acceptable to any listener.\n*No affiliation, just one I've used before.\n\nA: Similar to Tetsujin's solution, Boom 2 or Boom 3D are both solutions, they range from about $12 for single licence - $33 CAD for the family, and are easy enough to use. The app comes with prebuilt profiles for your editing, and the 3D version has the feature of making it seem like you have a 5.1 surround sound setup for headphones. \n\nThis app is more simplified, and is designed for the average user, but if you are wanting full control in all interfaces, definitely go with the app that Tetsujin said.\n\nThere is also a 7 day free trial that is able to be used. \n*I have no affiliation with Global Delight or Rogue Amoeba. More solutions are welcome, and I might even convert myself to Tetsujin's solution...\n", "Q: macOS annoyingly puts fullscreen videos in a new \"space\" When watching a video on YouTube (or any other streaming service) – I use mainly Safari, sometimes Chrome, with the same result – when I switch to fullscreen, the video goes fullscreen in a new \"Space\" (virtual screen).\nI'm not interested in virtual spaces in general, I've always found it to be a very un-Mac-y way to work. But in the case of videos, it's pretty annoying. Let's say I get a notification (mail, IM, anything) and want to quickly check it. I command-tab to the app that sent me the notification and instead of just superimposing to window on top of the video (as it does on Windows and as it did in earlier versions of Mac OS X), the sound continues playing, the video vanishes and I get that useless screen:\n\nI then have to click to exit full screen and double click again to get the full screen back (I'm sure there are other ways, with gestures and all, but it's just annoying).\nIs there a way to revert to a sensible (à la Windows, or previous OS X versions) on recent macOS versions? I know VLC can do it, so it is theoretically possible, but did Apple hide a system setting somewhere to change that behaviour? If not, is there an app that does it?\n\nA: Have you tried adjusting the settings related to this in System Preferences > Mission Control?\nThe first checkbox there lets you disable automatic grouping of windows and there are other related options there too. You can also totally disable having multiple screens there. \nI'm not sure if you're using macOS mojave and this is no longer a feature. Also this is the one gesture that I use..dragging from one side of the trackpad to the other with 3 fingers.\n\nA: I have no idea WTF the answers here are trying to solve but they're not what the original question is asking for: a quick way to get back to the \"virtual\" Space with a fullscreen video playing on it. The big issue for me is that there's no shortcut to get back to a fullscreen video Space via a keyboard shortcut since it's not a \"real\" Space and it has no \"Desktop #\".\nWhile this isn't a native solution, or even a \"natural\" workflow it's the fastest way I know to get back to the video on my system. It also requires third-party software (that isn't free).\nFirst, you'll need Alfred including the Powerpack which has a million other uses, by the way. Once that's installed, you'll need a (free) Workflow called Alfred Browser Tabs which is very handy in that it allows you to search through your browser tabs by their tab title. It works for Chrome, Chromium, Safari, and a couple others.\nOnce the above are installed, my process for getting back to a Formula 1 video in Chrome for example is:\nI open the Alfred box (eg. alt+space) and type tabs f1. The search takes a few milliseconds depending on how many tabs I have open. Then, assuming I have a tab matching f1 (eg. F1TV | 2021 Monza Grand Prix in the tab title) I can just hit enter and the fullscreen video tab will be focused (inherently switching to its Space.) If there are multiple matching tabs, I may have to eyeball the tab I want, and move down the list to select. But once I've switched to the tab I want a few times, Alfred gives it precedence, so it's usually the top result in Alfred.\nThis is probably most useful for existing Alfred Powerpack users, but in my opinion, every Mac owner should use it for its plethora of features and functionality. It's extremely powerful, has massively increased my productivity and all 'round ease of use of MacOS. It's the reason Apple has added so much functionality to Spotlight (having copied Alfred) but it remains to be a vastly superior alternative to Spotlight and is a complete replacement for me. /shill\nFor dedicated video apps that do fullscreen in the same way (eg. VLC) all of this is probably moot. You can most likely cmd+tab back to it.\n\nA: Here's how to fix this:\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences / Mission Control\n\n*Enable \"Displays have separate Spaces\"\n\n\n\n\n*Log out and in again\n\n", "Q: How do you navigate to safari extensions from App Store? Not critical, but its bugging me.\nI only know of one way to the safari extension gallery, ie, from the 'Extensions' tab in Safari's settings, More Extensions... button.\nIs there anyway to navigate there directly in the App Store app?\n\nA: Oddly enough if you open the App store app on your Mac and then type \"Safari Extensions\" in the search field, you will find a listing of all of the Safari extensions available from Apple on their app store.\nI have never seen a built-in category for just Safari Extensions but this seems to work.\n", "Q: MAC High Sierra password stopped working This happened today, and I am writing this in case someone else have the same issue.\nI have a corporate MAC, have separate password for Corporate and local password for the MAC.\nEverything was fine, today the password stopped working, I was sure it is the password, won't work.\nWhat didn't work...\n\n\n*\n\n*Single User Mode -> Setup Assistant -> New User -> Login as new user -> sudo passwd <myusername>.

I'm considering exporting all the videos currently stored in my Apple Photos library. These are made up of a mix of different video \"qualities,\" including 1080p and 720p.\nWhen I choose the File > Export > Export [number] Videos command, a dialog box appears prompting me to specify a quality of the exported files, e.g., 720p, 1080p, etc.\nIf I choose 1080p, I presume that my 1080p videos will be preserved in a lossless way. That is what I want. \nHowever, I don't understand what will happen to my 720p videos. Will the software export them in a lossless way as 720p, i.e., keep the files as-is, or will the software do something else? Will it try to re-encode them to \"up\" the 1080p format, potentially increasing the file size?\n\n\nA: You've only got so many 'real' pixels to play with, so when you stretch that out to 1080p, you've got quite a few holes.\nFrom there it all comes down to what approach the software you are using takes to create the missing pixels.  Typically the stretch it out to the edges, and then interpolate back to fill the holes, based on what the two pixels look like either side of the gap.\nSome software does this better than others, and the best method to use can depend on the image content also.  Typically it makes things look softer, blocker if bad, and highlights poor quality issues such as moire etc.\nPremiere Pro includes a simple algorithm as standard, and you can use plugging more targeted to the task if you want also.\nThere's no right or wrong.  A full HD TV will be doing this 720p to 1080p conversion ever time you watch anything less than full HD anyway for example.\nHere is a simple graphics showing what happens\n\n", "Q: Viewing Google Chrome (v69+) Cache on macOS?

Now, I believe the iMac boots automatically to Ubuntu in console mode. I tried a lot of combinations of keys, but without any result(option, command+R, command+option+P+R, etc.).\nWhat should i do ?\n\nA: If you properly install Ubuntu 18 Desktop, then you should be able to hold down the option at startup until the Startup Manager appears. You then can select the icon representing macOS which should boot macOS. If you hold down the control while selecting the icon, then macOS will become the new default operating system to boot. \nThe Startup Manager should also show another icon which represents Ubuntu. Since the Startup Manager can be used to boot either macOS or Ubuntu, the use of rEFInd is optional.\n\nIf macOS does not appear in the Startup Manager, then you probably erased macOS when you installed Ubuntu. \n\nIf you choose to install rEFInd, then you should install rEFInd to separate EFI, FAT, or JHFS+ formatted partition. If you do this properly, then you can select rEFInd from the Startup Manager. In other words, the Startup Manager can be use to enable/disable rEFInd.\n\nNote: You should not need to use the bless command or disable System Integrity Protect (SIP) to install Ubuntu or rEFInd.\n\n", "Q: Is a 2008/9 Mac Pro cluster a viable option to a 2018 iMac? So I can decide whether to use a small cluster of older Mac Pros or a single modern iMac assume I have a problem which will execute adequately in G gigabytes of RAM, and that the problem can use parallel execution.\nWhat performance gain might I expect from parallel execution on a single Mac if the memory requirement is multiplied by a factor N, I have c cores and more than N * G gigabytes of RAM?\n\nA: Since you won’t be running an abstract workload - making abstract generalizations won’t be super useful but my experience is you always want to get the most modern CPU and Mac to run your workload since the processors of the last 2-3 generations have the best compiler optimizations and the amount of work that can be done per CPU cycle increases far more than a back of the envelope calculation would show.\nLet’s assume you already have both the iMac and the Mac Pro - your time will be better spent working to tune the workload for your iMac or have it run in the cloud rather than run on a bunch of old Mac that need management / orchestration / etc.\nIf you haven’t purchased hardware, I’d say neither your equiment is the best.

It became clear as I had the hard drive replaced at a repair shop that the problem is somewhere on the motherboard, thus uneconomical to fix. However, the repair shop tested that a USB drive still works.\nAs I see it the only option is to get a SDXC hard drive, or a USB 3.0 powered one. The SDXC doesn't support UHS-2, therefore the maximum bandwidth will be around 150MB/s.\nAs I have researched this I've come to the conclusion that the write/write speeds on high-quality flash drives reach above 300MB/s(for example Sandisk Extreme Pro ), which is comparable to a high quality external SSD, but a lot more portable.\nMy question is therefore: Is this bandwidth between the hard disk and the CPU  sufficient for the operating system to run smoothly, or is it a completely lost cause?\nAs I have 16GB of RAM I expect it to work out, am I on the right track or completely lost?\nThank you!\n\nA: As you have 16GB of RAM your CPU will be mostly playing with it and very rarely access the USB drive, unless you constantly access stored information on the disk.\nCommon users do not do that.\nSo I have Firefox, Chrome, Skype, Mail, open and my access to the SSD is minimal. \nsee Data read/sec and Data written/sec. \nAs I constantly use all of those aps, there is no data exchange with my SSD.\nHowever in your case the OS X engine also resides on the external disk, so I can not tell with certainty.\n\n", "Q: Spotlight \"Privacy\" and wildcards I would like to have Mac Spotlight avoid indexing volumes with the name prefix of \"backup\".

Last week I plugged an SSD with a bootable APFS volume with macOS into the USB port of a Macbook Pro 2010.  It wasn’t seen in startup manager, as I had suspected.  This macbook had never been used as it had been stored in an exposition, so its firmware had never been updated.  It had its original and never used macOS 10.6 Snow Leopard installed.\nPlease correct me if this assumption is not correct:\nAny mac whose firmware was never updated after APFS was first launched by Apple won’t see APFS volumes in startup manager because the logic board firmware wouldn’t be able to read APFS.  If any mac with installed macOS releases such as Yosemite, El Cap, Sierra can see a bootable APFS volume in startup manager, it’s because it’s firmware has been updated to be able to read and write APFS.   Is this correct??? \nThe 2010 macbook mentioned above admits macOS up to the latest release (now High Sierra).\nAny clarification much welcome.\n\nA: When High Sierra is installed, any necessary firmware updates are applied. The has to be true, because any Mac built before APFS would not be able to boot from a APFS container partition without a firmware update.\nHowever, even if a Mac as the firmware update which include APFS, this does not automatically mean that versions of macOS (OS X) prior to High Sierra would be able to access APFS volumes. Apple would have to provide an APFS software update for older versions of macOS (OS X). I do not believe Apple has done this.\nThis is also true for Windows users. Many Ask Different users have reported failures to read APFS volumes from Windows and the inability to boot back to macOS High Sierra directly from Windows.\nAs for your assumption. I can not provide a proper answer since your reference to a Startup Manager is ambiguous. Each Mac has a firmware Startup Manager, but I think you are referring to the  Startup Disk pane from the macOS (OS X) System Preferences application. \n", "Q: How can I find which Control-Command keys are mapped to particular programs?

Someone there ran Malwarebytes, which found \"Adware.OperatorMac\", and mentions the following files:\n~/Library/Application Support/com.SearchSystem\n~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.SearchSystem.plist\n\nSo, if you have those files, that would seem a good place to find out more.\nI don't have 10.12.6 installed at the moment, but I do have machines running 10.11.6 and 10.13.6.  I don't have those files on either machine, so they aren't part of a standard install.\nIf you do have these files, perhaps you could post their contents as an update?\n", "Q: Disk Utility First Aid Fails on Time Machine Disk I've been backing up my Mac with Time Machine on an external hard drive for several years. I recently plugged the external drive into my Mac, it spent a long time running fsck_hfs and finally showed this dialog: \n\nRunning disk utility gives a lot of Invalid extent entry messages along with the conclusion First Aid process has failed.\n \nMy intuition would be to copy the whole disk to a new drive. I have a vague recollection from learning about Time Machine several years ago that this would have to be block-wise in order to preserve the Time Machine backup (using dd or carbon copy cloner, right?). But presumably a block-wise copy of the drive would copy the extent errors as well?  So do I just have to give up and lose my entire Time Machine history at this point?\n\nA: Time Machine makes extensive use of hard (as opposed to symbolic) links (for eg \"this folder is the same as yesterday's backup\").  See eg http://www.baligu.com/pondini/TM/Works.html.\nI thought the issue with copying backup history was that many copy tools won't see the hard links, so you end up with multiple copies rather than links and run out of space, hence your recollections about doing a block level copy instead.\nBut now I look it up, apparently Finder can copy a Backups.backupdb folder correctly.  See eg http://www.baligu.com/pondini/TM/18.html (which is sadly a little out of date), and Apple's current documentation https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202380.\nThe message in your first screen shot says \"You can still open or copy files on the disk, but you can't save changes to files on the disk\". So perhaps you will be able to follow the instructions above to copy your Backups.backupdb folder (containing your backup history) to a different drive.\n", "Q: Safari 12 compatible versions of ad blockers fail to block many ads Since installing Safari 12 and switching to the compatible version of my adblocker(s), many ads that were once successfully blocked by each of those adblockers are now visible, with the result that many frequently visited sites are (to this ad-allergic user) unusable.\nIs this likely to be a temporary situation as the features for the compatible adblockers are (quickly!) improved and stabilized, and capabilities of my old adblockers are restored? Or is this the result of limitations imposed by the new Safari 12 architecture, and thus likely to persist (or improve glacially)?\n\nA: The situation is likely to persist. \nContent blockers that are offered by Safari are limited to 50000 entries. uBlockOrigin  needs many more for example. 1Blocker for iOS circumvents that with a trick, using many of these and combining them. This is another builtin technical limitation, making 1Blocker inherently less effective.\nIn any case, these are different from the concept used in the traditional blockers – requiring a rewrite. Apple says these would be \"faster and safer\". Maybe. All we see is that our tried and tested favourite extensions do not work anymore, and if there are any successors even ready, they are apparently not up to the task on the level many were accustomed to.\nCoupled with the newly enforced restrictions for devs requiring App Store distribution, this disincentivises independent developers. The latter are artificial policy enforcements. This raises the cost for the devs and will likely result in the withdrawal of most useful plugins altogether.\nTamperMonkey and uBlockOrigin or JSBlocker devs are not happy. And for those three at least, it seems they have dropped the ball, citing the need for App Store distribution and certification as too costly, too much hassle, not worth it, bad on some fundamental principles:\n\nSafari/iOS: Unfortunately, after legal review, the EFF found Apple's developer agreement unacceptable. Furthermore, Safari seems to lack certain extension capabilities required by Privacy Badger to function properly.\n\nAnd in its current iteration, the technology of content blockers as too limited in principle for blocking all that needs to be blocked. uBlockorigin cites the same reasons as JSBlocker:\n\nSafari has a feature called \"Content Blockers\" that allows for extremely efficient resource blocking on both the desktop and iOS version of Safari. As much as I'd like to incorporate this into JS Blocker, it is not feasible to do so. Using a content blocker will prevent JS Blocker from showing you exactly what's going on on a website (i.e. you won't see what's allowed or blocked.) It will also break all of JS Blocker's \"other\" features, such as showing alerts within the webpage and canvas fingerprinting protection. Besides the loss of features, content blockers are limited to 50,000 rules. While this seems like a high number, it isn't enough for efficient protection and a lot of rules would need to be cut out to even run a content blocker. Until Apple eases the restrictions (or at least raises the number of rules that can be in a content blocker), JS Blocker will not be using this API.\n\nAnd:\n\nSafari App Extension\nI have no experience creating native mac apps; it will therefore be impossible for me to re-create JSB as one.\nUsers who downloaded JS Blocker from the Safari Extension Gallery will probably not be able to update beyond 5.2.2. Apple is not responding to my requests for updates despite them saying they will accept submissions until the end of 2018.\n\nWe all need to complain to Apple directly and massively. It's a pity we haven't done so during the shocking beta phase.\nUse Product Feedback - Apple, email, chat, your blog, or even better yet a developer feedback channel, file bugs. \nZotero connector is going to circumvent the stupidity enforced by switching to bookmarklets, other things break left and right and in the middle. This is just much too strict:\n\nEnable Your App Extension in Safari\n  If you’re not part of the Apple Development Program, or if you haven’t yet configured a developer identity for your existing Xcode project, your Safari App Extension won’t be signed with a development certificate. For security purposes, Safari, by default, ignores unsigned extensions, so your extension won’t show up in Safari Extensions preferences.\n  To develop without a certificate, each time Safari is launched, you must tell it to load unsigned extensions using the Develop menu:\n\nMany might think it's about money, but for some, it's indeed more the technical parting of the ways:\n\nSafari Support\n  As of RES v5.2.2, Safari is no longer a supported browser and will not receive updates or support from the development team. We want to support Safari and provide a good user experience for all, however we need Apple's support with this by improving extension development and publishing experiences.\nApple have announced that as of Safari 12, support for this style of extension will be deprecated and will no longer work.\nWhy did we do it?\nIt ultimately came down to the direction development of Safari extensions was heading. Major browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox were all adopting a standard commonly known as \"WebExtensions\". This provides a single API across all browsers. This is hugely beneficial as you can develop for all major browsers from a single code base. Safari is not adopting this standard and instead moving to their own format, with a strong reliance on Xcode. This would require significant investment from the development team to support the browser, as well as core developers having access to Xcode. Supporting this change would mean the codebase for RES would not be unified.\nDropping Safari support was never solely about money as many think it is, we do not have a vendetta against Apple. The discussion lasted many weeks and it was not something we took lightly.\n\nComplain, complain, …or switch to another browser.\n\nAfter you have rightfully complained to Apple, workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*go back to host based blocking (example) [do that anyway?]\n\n*use a local proxy, like https://privoxy.og (alternative upto Sierra (discontinued)) [do that anyway?]\n\n*combine both options with what is now available as extensions\n\n*re-enable uBlockorigin (incomplete solution and development has apparently stopped. Seems to need the gallery version, not the developer version)\n\n*switch to ka-block (not as effective as older methods, but efficient and free of charge, probably trustworthy?)\n\n\nFor the time being, you may want to stay with/downgrade to Safari 11.1.2 (not for very long though.) Or re-enable uBlockorigin in the preferences ignoring the misleading warnings about slow down or security. (This is cumbersome and I always lose all my custom settings on application relaunch. You will need the extensions-gallery version)\n\nNot recommended, only listed to illustrate the dire situation!\nThe shady non-'origin' version of ublock seems to be back in the game, although with the 50000 limit mentioned above.\nPlus: Use with caution, not sanctioned by upstream uBlockorigin\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock :\nublock.org says:\n\nBut that’s in the process of changing. If you’ve noticed recent updates to the product, that’s because uBlock has been acquired by the team responsible for AdBlock. We will be investing heavily into uBlock to help it deliver on the promise of being one of the best ad blockers available.\n\nEqually shady Adblockplus is also back. Be informed that the owner company sells your data and sells ads (\"only acceptable ones of course\"). And limitations are still big. From the comments on that release:\n\nThe sense of Adblock Plus is totally lost without filter Lists. \n  Button “Uninstall” is missing in Safari!

And is the first message lost in transit?\n\nA: Your friend was able to receive both the messages.\nThe former message was not lost in transit.\n", "Q: Zero-width characters embedded in phone number whenever they are copied from the macOS address book Whenever I use Contacts.app to fill out a form on a website, I have a problem with any phone number field.\nContacts.app adds unicode \"left-to-right override\" (U+202D codepoint: E2 80 AD in UTF-8 contexts, 20 2D in UTF-16 contexts) before the first digit, and \"pop directional formatting\" (U+202C codepoint: E2 80 AC in UTF-8 contexts, 20 2C in UTF-16 contexts) after the last digit. Many websites get upset by this, because those are not recognised as valid phone number digits. As they are zero-width symbols, the first few times I saw this problem I didn't even understand what was going wrong.\nNote that this still happens if I turn off JavaScript or use a desktop text editor like TextWrangler (TextWrangler is how I originally found out which zero-width symbols were being inserted); as it happens, I only care about websites because websites are the only thing which validates that phone numbers match a pattern such as the regex [0-9()+\\s]*\nThis happens with all phone numbers in Contacts, regardless of whose (some are formatted as UK, some as USA, some as German).\nMethod: open Contacts.app, select any person, double (or triple) click on a phone number to select all of it, ⌘C-⌘V to copy-paste; if I paste into an app which shows non-printable characters like TextWrangler then I can see their existence, if I paste into a web browser it's present but zero-width, as arrow keys 'stick' at those positions and the delete key does in fact remove them.\nIt happens as described in both Safari and Chrome. In Firefox, it behaved slightly differently, and seemed to automatically delete the extra characters as soon as I pass through them with my arrow keys (?!).\nHow do I stop Contacts.app from adding these unicode symbols?\n\nA: update Feb 2023: This is still NOT fixed as of macOS 13.2.1.\nAdding another reason why this is isn't simply a cosmetic problem. Recently I was adding an address on Amazon and got blocked. It kept telling me \"remove invalid characters from phone number field\". I'd forgotten about this old bug and wasted a lot of time checking, re-pasting and trying to format the number in various ways. Finally I remembered—Apple does not care about Contacts.app!\n\n\nThis isn't an answer but I wanted to add a screenshot as some people have requested it.\nI noticed this bug as well (as recently as 10.15.7) and was glad to find this already reported, and surprised it hasn't received more attention.\nI filed bugs #47763641 & #5235503 with Apple, hopefully they will notice. I encourage others to report it.\nHere are steps to repro & a screenshot that shows the issue:\n\n*\n\n*From Contacts.app, right-click → Copy on a phone number.\n\n*Paste into Sublime Text or any other plaintext editor.\n\n*Save as test.txt\n\n*Open in a Hex Editor, I used Hex Fiend in this example\n\n*You can now see the extra bytes (I highlighted them below)\n\n\na couple of bits of information:\n\n*\n\n*This seems to only affect phone# fields. Others such as email, addresses, notes etc don't exhibit this bug.\n\n*If, instead of using ⌘command + A (select-all), you very carefully select just from the start of the phone# to the end and then copy, the unwanted zwsp characters aren't copied.\n\nMy workaround for now is an Alfred workflow that I mapped to ⌘⇧C that copies the selected field and trims the whitespace. Not exactly elegant, but it works well enough until Apple fixes this (which they may never do as it's already survived 3 major OS releases and dozens of minor point updates)\n\nA: Not an answer, but a confirmation (to rebut the answer that says that Contacts is not doing it).\nHere is the result of pasting Apple's support number that I typed into Contacts and then copy/pasted into od -bc:\n% od -bc\n‭(800) 275-2273‬0000000   342 200 255 050 070 060 060 051 040 062 067 065 055 062 062 067\n         342 200 255   (   8   0   0   )       2   7   5   -   2   2   7\n0000020   063 342 200 254                                                \n           3 342 200 254                                                \n0000024\n\nI contacted Apple with a support request, escalated the request to the second level and successfully got the support person to verify that this is still happening (on 13.1) on his own computer.\nI've written up detailed steps to reproduce and sent them through as a bug report attached to my case.

How? I need to set up per-app VPN as a way to ensure that several apps I installed from App Store are using only internet traffic over VPN, but not using non-VPN traffic at all. I'm not a corporate user, so I'm considering to setup an MDM profile.\nAm I reading the official docs from Apple correctly that I can only set up per-app VPN for the app I developed, not for a third-party app from AppStore?\nThe \"App to Per App VPN\" section requires DesignatedRequirement and SigningIdentifier, both of which seems to be available only for the developer of an app in question. If not, how can I find out both of them?\n\nA: You can find the DesignatedRequirement and SigningIdentifier like this:\nStart by installing the app on a device. On your Mac make sure you have the app downloaded in iTunes as well. In the folder \"~/Music/Itunes/Mobile Applications/\" you'll now find an .ipa file for you app.\nAssuming that the app you want to target is \"SomeApp\" then copy SomeApp.ipa from that folder to a temporary folder. Rename the file and change the file extension from .ipa to .zip. Double-click to unzip the file. When unzipped you'll find that you have a folder named \"Payload\" in which a \"SomeApp.app\" folder exists.\nOpen a Terminal window and cd to the temporary folder. Run the following command:\ncodesign -d -r- \"Payload/SomeApp.app\"\n\nThis command will output the designated requirement (\"anchor apple generic...\").\nThen run the following command:\ncodesign --display --verbose=1 \"Payload/SomeApp.app\"\n\nThis command will output a line starting with \"Identifier=\". The rest of the line is the SigningIdentifier.\nNote that you mention the \"App to Per App VPN\" section of the linked manual - this specific payload is only supported on macOS. On iOS you do the same thing by sending the Settings command with an ApplicationAttributes entry over the MDM protocol. \n\nA: I see you mentioning .ipa-files, but this is not supported on iOS. Per App VPN is limited to domains and can not be specified for apps.\nApple docs say \"This payload is supported only in macOS 10.9 and later. It is not supported in iOS.\"\nhttps://developer.apple.com/business/documentation/Configuration-Profile-Reference.pdf\n", "Q: Is it possible to change iPhone X, iPhone XS, XS Max, XR, to display the screen in 16:9 aspect ratio? I think most of the iPhone X, XS, XS Max, XR have the aspect ratio of roughly 19.5 : 9. Is it possible to change the phone to use 16 : 9 aspect ratio?\nEssentially, I think this means chopping off the top and bottom region, even just for an hour or two, and make it behave just like an iPhone 8 or 7.\nOne reason that is needed is for some apps, such as Pokemon Go, which are not \"tweaked\" so perfectly for phones that have different aspect ratio other than 16:9.  So when you catch a Pokemon Gastly or Kyogre, they are really hard to catch on the iPhone X, while they are not as difficult to catch on the iPhone 8 or 7. The reason is that the 19.5:9 ratio make the screen taller, and the Pokeball becomes very hard to reach the Pokemon, so the Pokeball will land an \"air ball\" and hitting just air. The Pokemon Gastly usually is not so important, but if you watch your friends catching the legendary Pokemon Kyogre fairly easily, and you throw and throw and get air balls or cannot hit the ring to get a Great or Excellent throw, and therefore your catch rate might not be even 50% of your friends, just because you are using a more advanced phone, that is kind of bad.\n\nA: No, it is not possible to generally change the aspect ratio of the screen for any third party app.\nYou'll have to contact the app developers and let them know that their app has difficulties working correctly on these phones.\n\nA: There is not a way to change the aspect ratio.\nHowever, iOS will automatically do what you're positing should happen for games or other apps that have not declared that they are compatible with iPhone X's taller screen. In this scenario, the app will display black bars above and below the app.\nYour example of Pokemon Go is a design decision by Niantic- if you don't like how they've handled the taller aspect ratio, your best bet is to contact them and try to get them to change it. If you can get a large number of other iPhone X owners behind you they may be more apt to listen.\n", "Q: macOS: How to open a local HTML file with URL parameters I want to start a Kantu web macro from the command line on Mac.

I'm using OSX 10.9.5\n\nA: It's not quite clear from your question whether the password you need is actually stored in Keychain itself or elsewhere.\nAs a general rule in security, if a password is recognised by a mathematical hash, then it is never stored anywhere in plaintext.\nThe result of the hash is stored, not the actual password - so that when the correct password is input by the user, the hash of that input matches the stored hash result. Doing it this way means that brute force is the only way to 'guess' the password; it can never be reverse-engineered.\nHaving said that - Keychain does store original passwords for you & these can be retrieved from Keychain Access by selecting the appropriate entry & entering your keychain password.\nKeychain Access is in Applications > Utilities\nKeychain does this by encrypting the entire keychain using a separate hash structure & can be locked/unlocked by anyone with the appropriate password.\n\n\n", "Q: Where to configure Time Machine quota when backing up to Mac Server We use a Mac Server in another subnet as a Time Machine target for some of our MacBooks (macOs 10.13).

After removing all my plugins except the Covenant Eyes plugin it was still writing to that file. I reached out to their support and they could confirm that the software was doing that in order to force Google to use SafeSearch.\n", "Q: macOS Mail app displaying postal address next to email address I've reinstalled my dad's MacBook Air and now, for some reason,\nwe can see the postal address next to name and surname in Mail.\nI've attached a photo. \nAs you can see, the photo shows a random email sent to us displaying\nname and surname like it should, but also the postal address. How can I disable it so the postal address is not shown?\n\n\nA: That is a Junk mail.\nWhat they put in the TO field you can not change.\nSomehow they have your Dads address in they records and put it in the TO field for some obscure reason.\nHowever if you wish not to see emails like that then\nSelect that email\nClick on Mail (top left) \nthen Preferences\nand select rules\nNow set it up as shown, and emails from CheapOAir will be Automatically deleted. You can undo this if you want to see them again.\n\n", "Q: Why does iMessage recipient show as green when sending message thru Siri Shortcuts? I'm trying to use the built in \"ETA\" shortcut recipe. I add my wife as the recipient and run the shortcut. When it shows me the message for confirmation, her name is green, not blue.\nWhen I actually send the message and look in the Messages app, I now have two different conversations for her. One is our historic message thread, the other has only this single message sent by Shortcuts.\nWhy is this happening, and how can I stop it?\n\nA: I had the same issue. I solved it by typing in the phone number rather than using the contact.\n", "Q: Unable to open some apps from iOS 12 Shortcuts In the iOS 12 Shortcuts app, I'd like to build a shortcut that opens a specific app. This app doesn't have any specific integration with Shortcuts, but it's sufficient to just have the system open the app. So I added an \"Open App\" action to the end of my workflow — but the app I want to open does not appear in the list of choices for the Open App action.\nI noticed that a small fraction of apps on my phone are missing from the Open App list. It seems pretty random: Apple Pages is missing but Keynote is not, some but not all games are missing, etc.\nIs there some reason that I cannot open certain apps via Shortcuts?\n\nA: You could try using the \"Open URL\" action to open the app using URL schemes.\nYou can find some URL schemes by doing a Google search for it(here's a good list).\nIf you can't find it online, you can get it manually(you need a computer):\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the .ipa of the app you want to get the URL schemes of(you can use iTunes)\n\n*Rename it from .ipa to .zip and extract it\n\n*Open the Payload folder\n\n*Right click on the application inside and chose \"Show Package Contents\"(or just open the .app folder if you're not on Mac)\n\n*Open the Info.plist file and look for \"URL Schemes\".\n\n", "Q: Why do I have to re-pair my Apple Magic Wireless Keyboard (A1314) every morning? I take my laptop home every night. When I come into the office I have to remove the keyboard from the BT devices and re-pair it - otherwise it won't connect. My Apple Magic Trackpad (A1339) connects automatically.\nThis has only started happening recently. It is consistent and I have to go through the re-pair process every morning. (I have tried replacing the batteries)\nIs it a BT issue or a hardware issue? What's the best way to debug this?\nConnecting to a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017) running macOS High Sierra v10.13.6\n\nA: The issue was caused by an old machine (MacBook Air 2012) in the office that used to be paired with keyboard. The person using the old machine would arrive into the office earlier than me so by the time I had arrived the keyboard had connected to their machine.\nSolved by removing the device from the bluetooth devices of the old machine.\n", "Q: What is the correct application to call to be able to use date? In AppleScript if you have a string with a date and try to convert it to a class of date it will error out in Finder and System Events.  Example:\nset testDate to \"Friday, September 21, 2018 at 6:54:29 PM\"\nset testResult to date testDate\nreturn testResult\n\nrenders:\n\nWhen placing the above code in a System Event:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set testDate to \"Friday, September 21, 2018 at 6:54:29 PM\"\n    set testResut to date testDate\n    return testResut\nend tell\n\nreturns:\n\nSystem Events got an error: Can’t get date \"Friday, September 21, 2018\n  at 6:54:29 PM\".\n\nTrying to place the above in a Finder tell:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set testDate to \"Friday, September 21, 2018 at 6:54:29 PM\"\n    set testResut to date testDate\n    return testResut\nend tell\n\n\nFinder got an error: Can’t get date \"Friday, September 21, 2018 at\n  6:54:29 PM\".\n\nWhat should I use to be able to convert a date string to an actual date if I'm already using either System Events or Finder?  The only alternative I've found is to create a handler:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set testDate to \"Friday, September 21, 2018 at 6:54:29 PM\"\n    return my stringDate(testDate)\nend tell\non stringDate(theString)\n    set attempt to date theString\n    return attempt\nend stringDate\n\nHow can I do a date conversion in a System Event or Finder tell block?\n\nThere's been discussion in comments with the supplied answer but given the system specs of:\nmacOS High Sierra version 10.13.6\nand copied solution:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set testDate to \"Friday, 21 September, 2018 at 6:54:29 PM\"\n    set testResult to my (date testDate)\nend tell\n\nOpened a new Script Editor:\n\nPasted code solution:\n\nCompiled code solution:\n\nRan code solution:\n\nIssue still persists. \n\nA: That's interesting, I had never noticed this oddity of AppleScript before.  Strangely, if you create the date object using a string by value, neither System Events nor Finder has a problem:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set testResult to date \"Friday, 21 September 2018 at 6:54:29\"\nend tell\n\nis absolute fine (the format of my date string is different to yours, as per my system settings).\nIt's only when referencing the string's value using a variable that the issue presents itself:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set testDate to \"Friday, 21 September, 2018 at 6:54:29 PM\"\n    set testResult to date testDate\nend tell\n\nas you pointed out, is not allowed.\nSolution:\nIt turns out the solution is to refer the job to the top-level AppleScript object using my (or AppleScript's):\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set testDate to \"Friday, 21 September, 2018 at 6:54:29 PM\"\n    set testResult to my (date testDate)\nend tell\n\n\nNote to other users: AppleScript date strings are formatted according to your system's date/time settings, therefore a direct copy-n-paste of any of the above snippets—either mine or the OP's—may still generate an error.  You need to determine the appropriate format to use for the date string on your system, which is most easily done by examining the value returned by the AppleScript command current date, and using that as a template.\n", "Q: Downgrade from Safari 12 to Safari 11 How can I downgrade from Safari 12 back to Safari 11?\nI’m a blind Mac user, using Voiceover. Safari 12 has various accessibility bugs and thus I need to go back to the latest version of Safari 11.\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far: restoring a previous version of my computer from a Time Machine backup. But that didn’t work, because as soon as the system restarted Safari updated automatically, before I could do basically anything.\nAny other suggestions?\nI’m running macOS High Sierra 10.13.6\n\nA: Go to Mac App Store page for macOS High Sierra and download the installer.\nCreate a bootable installer for macOS High Sierra by following the instructions in the support document, How to create a bootable installer for macOS:\nUse a USB flash drive with at-leat 12 GB of free storage space and run the following command:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app\n\nOnce you have the installer ready, use it to install a fresh copy of macOS High Sierra. Once installed restore your data from Time Machine backup.\nNow turn-off automatic updates in System Preferences and manually check for updates. Under Updates in Mac App Store do not choose to update Safari.\n\nA: You are on the right path and so close.\nNow just tell your system NOT to Auto update.\nOpen Apple Store in System Preference\nand disable Auto update \n\nAlternative method:\nOK, lets use \"sneaky\" method, \nDisconnect from Network, WIFI, (cut the cable ... just kidding :) so it can not update. \nThat should give you time to change the auto update settings.\n", "Q: Unwanted GRUB on macOS High Sierra While installing Linux Mint 19 to a USB, I managed to get GRUB installed on my Mac hard drive. I can still boot to the macOS if I hold the Option key down.\nHow can I remove GRUB and revert my Mac hard drive back to booting with macOS?\nI am fully backed up and if necessary can reformat and restore.\n\nA: Assuming you did not create any new partitions on your Mac, then Grub will only exist in the hidden EFI partition. If there is no evidence of Grub in the Startup Manager menu, then you can just leave the Grub files on the EFI partition. \nYou can make macOS the default by holding down the control key before selecting macOS in the Startup Manager menu.\nIf Grub does appear in the Startup Manager, then you can fix this by removing the EFI/BOOT folder from the hidden EFI volume. To make this volume visible in the Finder, execute the following command.\nsudo diskutil mount disk0s1\n\n", "Q: Super quiet audio recording in Quicktime 10.4 using Soundflower-2 on Yosemite Now that the Soundflowerbed app is retired, I haven't been able to record my Mac's system audio :( \nFollowing the instructions from mattingalls' Soundflower-2 installation guide, (https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases/tag/2.0b2), I rebooted, and then created a Multi-Output Device in Audio MIDI Setup, to be able to listen to the audio through the built-in speakers along with sending it through Soundflower 2CH,  But I'm getting a super low audio volume when I try to record through Quicktime 10.4. Even with the volume cranked, there's very little sound in the Quicktime recording, and yes, I did make sure to adjust the volume before switching to the Multi-Output Device in Sys. Prefs. \nHere's my setup:\n\n\n\nI'm working on a mid-2012 MacBook Pro Retina, still running Yosemite (oooold, I kno, but I can't update just yet- some of the software I need to use isn't compatible with the latest OS)\nAny advice or link to a free Soundflower alternative would be greatly appreciated :) \n\nA: I'm not sure if you've tried this, but the more important one is the volume you have routed to soundflower. To achieve a similar volume coming out of your speakers and still getting a louder recording, you'll have to lower the output volume and raise soundflower's volume.\nAlso, I'm not sure about you but soundflowerbed works all right for me.\n\nA: I had the same problem.  It appears the extension is in a funky state once it is installed.  The sliders show 100% volume but its actually not.  The easiest way to fix it is to go to the Audio Midi settings page and slide the master slider for Soundflower down and then back up for both input and output.  This will solve the problem.  Apparently it forces the internally stored values to reset.\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone 7s keep losing Wi-Fi since I installed iOS12? I can connect the phone to Wi-FI manually, but after several minutes, it loses the connection, and I have to restore it manually. This did not happen before I installed iOS 12.\n\nA: Before doing anything, have you erased network settings and verified WiFi is stable?\nNext, erase all content and settings and retest on a new network. \nApple typically stops signing the previous release within a week of a new iOS, so you could try restoring back to iOS 11 to rule out a hardware failure that was a coincidence. At that point you can decide to see Apple service before upgrading to understand if you have any recourse from them in case a second upgrade also fails. \nMany many iPhone 7 era devices work fine, so it’s almost certainly not a widespread bug. If you’re sure you want iOS 12 I would erase and restore the device and then connect to a Mac to look over the system logs if the failure continues. \n\nA: Thanks, the reset of network settings did it.  I'm annoyed at myself because I was so sure it was duet iOS12 that I didn't do theobvious.\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra Turkish Keyboard Issue I started to use a Mac mini with Turkish keyboard. However, macOS High Sierra has only Turkish Q and Turkish Q Legacy keyboard options. If I remember correctly almost one year ago I was using a MacBook in a virtual machine and when I chose to Turkish QWERTY PC option, every key was working as I expected. This option was removed now I think. And some keys and combination of keys don't work or represent totally different charters or symbols.\nI tried to change my location but it didn't help me at all.\nHow can I fix this annoying issue?\n\nA: Here is a copy I made of my Turkish QWERTY PC layout from El Capitan in case that helps.\nIf <> is on the topmost leftmost key instead of next to the left shift, you may have a Keyboard Type Problem, where your machine thinks the keyboard is ANSI instead of ISO.

Faced this problem quite a while ago, so i sent it in for repair and was told the logic board may need replacement. The store told me they tested my machine out with a working logic board and replacing it would solve the issue.\nI decided not to get it fixed and took it home.\nStrangely enough, I was able to boot up after I left the store. There was around 20% charge on it too, seemed to work fine. I was not able to get the battery to charge though, MagSafe light would remain green. Eventually the battery drained since it couldn't charge.\nI even replaced the MagSafe DC-in board myself later but it doesn't charge no matter what, light remains green.\nMy question is, if my logic board was truly faulty, would it have been possible to boot up when I got it back from the store?\nEdit: I have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Asking a friend of mine to verify if my MagSafe adaptor works and was told there was no issue with charging.\n\n*Disconnecting the battery and plugging in the MagSafe adaptor to boot up, which didn't work.\n\nA: \nMy question is, if my logic board was truly faulty, would it have been\n  possible to boot up when I got it back from the store?\n\nBecause, not everything is absolute.\nIn other words, you may have an intermittent failure of some component.  I't possible it's a failing capacitor, resistor or even IC (Integrated Circuit, aka \"chip\").   There may be dry (broken or otherwise faulty) solder joints.  You may even have electrical \"glue\" that has become dry/cracked and is contributing to the intermittent functionality.  \nWithout putting \"hands on\" it would be impossible to accurately diagnose and/or repair.  However, IMO, unless you can source a replacement logic board on the cheap, fixing an almost 9 year old machine is going to be cost prohibitive.\n", "Q: AppleScript How to return first n elements of item in list I have never written anything in AppleScript but I recently got a MBP and started playing around with it just to tweak the touchbar.

Today a badge appeared on the Settings app. Opening the app lead me to Software Update.\nMy iPhone is showing an update available for iOS 12. \nI have some chat data in WhatsApp and Messages which is important. Also have some important photos. I don't want to lose all this data. What measures can I take to ensure data safety?\n\nA: It is recommended to upgrade your iPhone 8 to iOS 12. iOS 12 is a free, major software update available for all eligible iOS devices. A major iOS software update named with an incremented version number is released by Apple every year. iOS 12 was released this year on 17 September 2018.\nAn iOS update helps you get more out of your device that you already own via free software update. iOS 12 is also touted by Apple to be a evolutionary update with a focus on performance. Thus, it is recommended to upgrade your iPhone 8 to iOS 12.\nIt is obvious to be concerned about safety of your data. To ensure that you don't lose access to your data, it is recommended to have a full backup of your device. If you use a Mac or a Windows computer, you can use iTunes to perform a full backup of your iPhone. In case you don't have a computer, you can also choose to backup your iPhone to iCloud over-the-air. Do note that the basic (free) tier of iCloud provides 5 GB of storage space.\nTo enable iCloud Backup, on your iPhone go to Settings app → Your name on top →  iCloud → iCloud Backup and turn it on.\nMessages exchanges via Messages app are backed up to iCloud as well. WhatsApp has an in-app mechanism to take chat backup which you can use. (Behind the scenes, WhatsApp also uses iCloud storage for backup).\nLast, to ensure safety of your photos, you can enable iCloud Photos in Settings app → Your name on top →  iCloud → Photos and turn on iCloud Photos.\nDon't forget to make sure you have enough iCloud storage to enable all the aforementioned data backup. You can buy additional storage by choosing the desired monthly plan.\nNote that apart from an yearly major update, a bunch of minor updates are also released by Apple frequently. iOS 12 has introduced the ability to turn on automatic updates which you can use. To turn on automatic updates, after installing iOS 12, go to Settings app → General → Software Update and turn on Automatic Updates.\nIt is a safe practise to have all the data backed up before upgrading iOS. The way the process is designed, OS upgrade doesn't affect user data or any installed apps on your iPhone and is generally safe to do so. Only recommendation is to keep the device battery charged/plugged in to a power source to ensure that the device doesn't run out of battery while update is in progress.\n", "Q: Toggle Bluetooth using wired keyboard on iMac Every so often my iMac looses the Bluetooth mouse connection. The only way to resolve this (other than a reboot) is to switch Bluetooth off, wait about 10 seconds then switch it back on.\nThis involves plugging-in a wired mouse, make the above happen, then unplug it.\nI use a wired keyboard which continues working without Bluetooth. Is there a way I can set something up, or a keyboard shortcut, to switch off Bluetooth, wait, then switch it back on?\n\nA: Nimesh’s answer is very clever and requires no extra tools, so that may be what you want.\nHowever, there is a much easier way, if you are willing to spend a few minutes to download and install some apps/tools once in order to have a simpler way to turn Bluetooth off/on in the future.\nFirst, download and install blueutil from http://www.frederikseiffert.de/blueutil/download/blueutil.zip\nUnzip it, double-click the Install.command and enter your password, and it will be installed to /usr/local/bin/blueutil. \n(If you use brew, ignore the above and just do: brew install blueutil) \nAfter that, you just need a way to run it via the keyboard. For that, I highly recommend Alfred, although you could use LaunchBar instead.\nAssuming you use Alfred, get this Bluetooth toggle workflow and you can enable/disable Bluetooth with a few keystrokes.\n\nA: If you use Siri, you can simply ask it to turn Bluetooth on and off. Just press and hold Command + Space keys to invoke Siri. Now speak Turn Off Bluetooth or Turn Bluetooth Off. Wait for desired time, invoke Siri again and speak Turn On Bluetooth or Turn Bluetooth On to enable it again.\n\nThere's a second, but a bit clumsy approach you can take, if you don't use Siri, or do not have an active Internet connection. (Using Siri requires an active Internet connection).\nEnable Full keyboard Access to use Tab key to move focus to on screen controls. Go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts and select All Controls for Full keyboard Access:\n\nNow, you can easily toggle Bluetooth using keyboard by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Command + Space to open Spotlight.\n\n*Enter System Preferences. Select System Preferences.app and press Enter to launch it.\n\n\n\n*Press Command + f (if required) to move focus to Search field. Enter Bluetooth and select the entry to open Bluetooth preference pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Press Tab key to move focus to Turn Bluetooth Off button. Press Space or Enter key to turn Bluetooth off. Wait for some time, then press it again to turn Bluetooth back on.\n\n\n\nUsing this approach, you can toggle Bluetooth without touching mouse.\n\nA: There is a more direct way to do it is by using inbuilt tools. \nCtrl + F8 will \"move to the status menu in the menu bar\". Then use the Right arrow to reach the Bluetooth icon, then Down arrow to show options, then Up/Down arrows to navigate the options, and Space to choose. \n", "Q: If I change my iTunes payment method after making a purchase, which one is used?

Yesterday I bought the new 2018 15\" MacBook Pro (until then I was a Windows user for more than 20+ years) and installed all the software from Canon's EOS Solution Disk (downloaded from Canon's webpage). I am using a Canon 7D Mark II and a Canon 1D X.\nOn Windows 10 my workflow was that after shooting, I took the SD or CF card out of the camera and plugged it into my card reader, and that started Canon's ImageBrowser EX software, which then automatically started copying my images into the destination folder (with a subfolder that was automatically created based on the date, e.g. /user/Pictures/Canon/2018_09_22).\nAfter that, I proceeded to do my editing. I did not need to plug any of my cameras into the laptop that I was using.\nOn my new MacBook, I can achieve this only if I plug the whole camera in using a USB cable and run the EOS Utility 3 software when I plug the camera in. Neither does EOS Utility start automatically, nor does it offer the option to download from SD/CF card directly — and apparently, ImageBrowser EX does not even exist for OS X.\nSo my question is: How do I achieve that my images are automatically downloaded into subfolders directly from my SD and CF cards when I plug them in the card reader? What software (preferably from Canon) should I use?\nI also posted this question on photo stackexchange and the said I might get better results here... \n\nA: Applications > Image Capture\nThis is the Mac's generic photo importer - it's the actual engine behind Photos.\nLaunch, insert card, select the card in the list; then bottom left there is a drop menu so you can tell it what automatic action to perform.\nThis is where I'm uncertain as I'm a Nikon user, not Canon.  \n\nDrop menu artificially moved across so you can see the section underneath\nFrom here you can set whether or not to auto-launch any capable app, or use Image Capture itself. I just import to the same folder each time then move after I've done initial edits, but from here you could tell it to auto-launch your Canon software & it could then take over the import & file structure..\nOne caveat - if you reformat the SD card, it will be recognised as a new device each time you do. The Mac treats each card as a separate entity & always knows which card it is, even if you have several with the same name [which also means you need to set up the same workflow for each card, the first time]. Reformatting breaks that association.\n", "Q: Can MacBook Pro get slower after SSD is almost full? MBP 13, 2015 with 128 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM.\nI have noticed, that after only some 20 GB of SSD was free my Safari browser was very slow.\nRAM was used 4-6 GB from 8.\nIs it general possible, that SSD can slow the MAC or it was some other reason?\n\nA: While this is certainly not the only reason you may experiencing a slow down, a filled up SSD is one possible reason for slow downs.\nThe first reason connected to that is inherent to the filesystem macOS uses. If the filesystem is HFSplus, then the free space usually needs to be above a certain percentage to ensure smooth operation. If the free space falls below 25% things start to get complicated and the directory structure gets more and more inefficient. To name just one reason connected to the filesystem.\nWhy is it important to keep lots of freespace on OSX? What is the impact? and How much hard drive space to leave free?\nNext it depends on whether you have trim enabled or not. Without trim it gets harder and harder to know which cells to use next as the wear leveling is designed to use each cell ideally equally compared to the others. On an original Apple SSD trim should be enabled.\nThen all currently sold SSDs age and get indeed slower over time. This should not be that much noticeable, though.\nMore importantly, all the above combines to something like a perfect storm on all SSDs, as they fill up:\n\n Why Solid-State Drives Slow Down As You Fill Them Up\nThe benchmarks are clear: Solid-state drives slow down as you fill them up. Fill your solid-state drive to near-capacity and its write performance will decrease dramatically. The reason why lies in the way SSDs and NAND Flash storage work.\nFilling the drive to capacity is one of the things you should never do with a solid-state drive. A nearly full solid-state drive will have much slower write operations, slowing down your computer.\nEmpty Blocks and Partially Filled Blocks\nWhen you write a file to your solid-state drive, it looks for empty blocks and fills them. Writing to an empty block is the fastest possible write operation. That’s why new operating systems (Windows 7 and later) support the TRIM feature, which automatically deletes a file’s data from the solid-state drive as soon as you delete the file in your operating system. This works differently from magnetic hard drives, where bits of deleted files sit around on the hard drive.\nThey don’t sit around on a solid-state drive — TRIM ensures that the block is emptied so the SSD can quickly write new data to the empty block in the future. Writing over an already-written sector is just as fast as writing to an empty sector on a mechnical hard drive, but a solid-state drive must erase a block before writing to it.\nNAND Flash memory writes data in 4 KB pages inside of 256 KB blocks. To add additional pages to a partially filled block, the solid-state drive must erase the entire block before writing data back to it.\n\nAs your solid-state drive fills up, fewer and fewer empty blocks are available. In their place are partially filled blocks. The solid-state drive can’t just write the new data to these partially filled blocks — that would erase the existing data. Instead of a simple write operation, the solid-state drive has to read the value of the block into its cache, modify the value with the new data, and then write it back. Bear in mind that writing a file will likely involve writing to many blocks, so this can introduce a significant amount of additional delay.\nTRIM Doesn’t Consolidate Partially Filled Blocks\nIf you fill a drive to capacity or near capacity, it’s likely that you’ll end up with many partially filled blocks after you delete files. The TRIM command just directs a solid-state drive to remove file data when the file is deleted. It doesn’t force the drive to do any sort of cleanup operation.\nIn other words, fill a solid-state drive to capacity before deleting files and you’ll likely end up with many partially filled blocks. The drive won’t go out of its way to consolidate these partially-filled blocks into full blocks, freeing up empty blocks. The drive will still be full of partially filled blocks and write performance will be degraded.\nOverprovisioning and Garbage Collection\nTo prevent consumers from filling up their solid-state drives and ending up with severely degraded performance, SSD manufacturers are going out of their way to counter this.\nConsumer-grade solid-state drives often set aside about 7% of their total flash storage and make it unavailable to the user. This is known as “overprovisioning” — extra storage hardware is added to the drive but isn’t visible to the computer as available storage it can use. The spare area ensures that the drive can never become completely full — there will always be some spare capacity to help keep write performance stable.\nEach solid-state drive’s controller has a garbage-collection algorithm to try to mitigate this problem. When the drive becomes full, it will look for partially-filled blocks and start to consolidate them, freeing up as many empty blocks as possible. Different solid-state drives run these operations at different times and thresholds — that depends on the drive’s controller.\nBenchmark Evidence\nAnandtech performed a variety of benchmarks with different drives to tease out the relationship between a solid-state drive’s spare area and the consistency of its write operation performance. When filling up an empty drive, they found high write performance very early in the process and a significant drop as the write operations continued to fill up the drive.\n\nSetting aside more spare area on the drives helped the performance to remain consistent, as it ensured the drive should always have enough empty blocks ready.\nThey found that “minimum performance improves substantially once you hit 25% spare area for these [consumer] drives.” Their final recommendation was that you should “plan on using only about 75% of [your drive’s] capacity if you want a good balance between performance consistency and capacity.”\nIf you have a solid-state drive, you should try to avoid using more than 75% of its capacity. Buy a larger drive with more storage than you need and you’ll ensure that you always have consistent write performance. Luckily, SSDs are gradually becoming much cheaper, so this isn’t as expensive as it once was.\n\n\nApart from these general considerations, if the perceived slow downs are exclusive to the browser, then the browser itself is the more likely culprit.\nUsing the same amount of free space on the SSD but with a fresh browser profile, and a freshly launched browser, things will likely look much better in most cases.\nAn easy test for this might be creating a new user, log into that and try it out. If things look better, it's time to cleanup your browser profile.

In some cases, they would display \"Maybe: [name]\".\nTrying to figure this out, I noticed that my contacts app was not formating numbers correctly.  Instead of (123) 456-7890, it would show 1234567890.\nI tried a lot of fixes that were suggested on the internet (edit one contact, restart, stop the apps and re-start, etc.) but none worked.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: I figured this out.  Note that this fix works for an iPhone 5s running iOS 12, with contacts synced to Google/Gmail.  Your mileage may vary.\nThe problem seems to be that the phone numbers in the contacts app have lost the proper format. They should be in the form (123) 456-7890 and they have become formatted as 1234567890. It seems that iOS does a really literal comparison and it can't resolve this difference. I tested this theory by editing a contact to put a \"+1\" international code in front of the number. That forced the number into the correct format and the phone app and messages then displayed that person's name.\nThe challenge was how to do this without editing every phone number.\nI fixed this by changing my region from the US to Canada. That evidently forces a re-formatting of the erroneous numbers. Then I changed it back to the US. \nGo to Settings, General, Language&Region, Region, select \"Canada\", then press \"Done\" (I bet selecting any region would work). The change takes a bit of time.

Despite I can see the \"free space\" on the partition map, I cannot resize the Container1 to include it (I can only include it into the Recovery HD partition)\nAfter hours of trial-and-error, I finally solved the problem by removing the \"Recovery HD\" partition and then I can have all disk space (except the tiny EFI partition) in Container1. And all these can be done through Disk Utility (in partition panel, by clicking + and -), no need to type commands in Terminal.\nTry it, hope it works for you too.\nBTW, in your case removing BOOTCAMP partition directly might be dangerous, consider using BootCamp Assistant to remove it.\n", "Q: Chrome: When menubar displays, webpage shifts down All of a sudden, a couple weeks ago, I've noticed that whenever I hover my mouse at the top of my chrome browser while in fullscreen, when the top menu bar appears it shifts the whole webpage a couple inches down.

Now the whole thing reformats.

Where would the location of the plist or sqlite DB that contains blocked numbers on an iPhone such as described in the apple docs?\n\nA: I looked into your question, and I think it might not be possible to find blocked numbers within a backup (or at least not in a recognizable form). I know that it is possible to find these numbers if you have messages synced with iCloud. Through the messages app on a Mac, you can go to preferences (⌘ + ,), and from there view any blocked numbers that are synced. \n\nI am still looking through finding the blocked numbers in the backups myself, but I am unsure that I will find them there.

Easiest and Most Recommended: Select the file in Finder, right/control-click on the file and choose “Open”. You will be asked if you want to open the file, even if it is from an unknown developer.\n2. Slightly More Complicated, but Sometimes Preferable: If you are not afraid of Terminal.app (found in the /Applications/Utilities folder of Finder), you can remove the “Quarantine” attribute using this command:\nxattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/folder\nFor example, if all of the files are in ~/Downloads/ then you would use:\nxattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/\nor\nxattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine \"$HOME/Downloads/\"\nType man xattr into Terminal.app for more information about the xattr command, but the short version is that -r means “recursive” and -d means “delete the following attribute”.\n\nA: Open the Terminal app from the /Applications/Utilities/ folder and then enter the following command syntax:\nsudo spctl --master-disable\n\nHit return and authenticate with an admin password\nRelaunch System Preferences and go to “Security & Privacy” and the “General” tab\nYou will now see the “Anywhere” option under ‘Allow apps downloaded from:’ Gatekeeper options\n\nDo not forget to change it back for your safety. \nsudo spctl --master-enable\n\n", "Q: iOS 12 replacement for default Music-app which can \"remember playback position\" I upgrade from iPhone 4GS 16GB iOS 7.0.6 to iPhone 8 Plus 256GB iOS 12 \nso i can put all my audiobooks on my phone.\nbut in new Music app remember playback position does not work anymore.\nIn iTunes it show remember playback position set on set on iphone music files.\nSo i need a replacement can do it.\nI got over 680+ Audiobooks in my iTunes Library set as music type.\nWhy music type vs audiobooks are more tags show by default.\ngot 600+ \nTags with \nSongTrackName+ArtistAuthor+AlbumTitle+ComposerReader+Genre+Year+Comments+ArtworkBookcover\nI try audiobooks apps all i come over was lacking in display all info i want+easy search through i got over 600 audiobooks i does not want to move through all with scrolling max 5 books per scroll in scrolling no info. \nI got over 70+ Smart Playlist on iTunes i like to use then fine right audiobook for time and day i want to hear audiobooks.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ecoute/id536882653 half like the interface but does not support remember playback position \n\nA: fine out after pay away ads does not support .m4a half iTunes Library are in this format thought it was a bug in app but after read app info... :( but fine other bug if to many files on app it crashes on startup!!\nFLAC Player+\nGood Old Music Interface:\nSong,Playlists,Artist,Album,Composer,Genre\nGot a Setting Start Playing turn from From Beginning to Where Left Off\nthat works! :)\nNo support for default iTunes Library sync.\nNow copy all file through https or iCloud-Drive but vs start think switch to other different Phone it much easier.\n\nA: For the same functions you describe I use three apps on my iPhone and watch.\n\n\n*\n\n*Overcast - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast/id888422857\n\n*Cesium Music Player - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cesium-music-player/id924491991\n\n*Music app plus Apple Music paid service - the iOS standard players which works with iTunes and enable me to sync all my iTunes libraries\n\n\nI can't abide by having all the audio books in my iTunes library so I push them all to overcast and it does a fabulous job of downloading and cataloging and organizing. Cesium is the app which also has a dedicated audiobook player by the same developer - greenlit. I know Cesium resumes my queue but since I don't listen to audiobooks from my library - you will have to check that greenlit or overcast maintains a current playback position for each and every title and not just the one title I listen to on occasion (where simply remembering the playback status of one file is all that's required).\nFor me, the reason I spent on cesium was it restored the interface I wanted to just focus on playlists and it has a toggle to only play songs that are downloaded since my cloud library has tens of thousands of tracks in \"my library\" and access to all the songs iTunes knows about. Sometimes I want to play from the library that's synced down like you have things with your iTunes Library being the source of the files.\nLastly - your tagging / organization / metadata request might be better as a new thread entirely once you have settled on a player. For me, using Siri to play the items I want is working great, but I don't know if you can curate your metadata well enough to have that work for your library.\n\nA: Apps such as Ecoute and Cesium use the Apple's Music app to handle the playback, so you will find the same issue with remembering playback position.\nA few options would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Overcast - as mentioned you can sideload up to 2GB books with a\npremium subscription. The web upload might be a bit limited for your\nneeds though\n\n*Castro - sideload books with a subscription with no limitation other than your iCloud Drive storage space\n\n*Downcast - sideload books via iTunes File Sharing (first reveal the mp3 or m4a in Finder then drag it over), or import the files from Music app\n\n*Documents by Reaadle - sideload via iTunes or cloud storage such as iCloud Drive, Dropbox, etc. (you can turn on \"remember media position\" in settings)\n\n\nAll of the above will remember playback position and all except Castro can search based on title. But I don't think any of these will let you view/search all the tags.\n", "Q: If I log onto someone else’s WiFi on my computer, would they be able to see my personal files?

There's no need for you to write something down.\nIn case you need to do recovery because you have forgotten your login password, you can use your iCloud account to unlock FileVault. Just make sure you can remember your iCloud login details!\nWhen you choose to use iCloud as your recovery mechanism, the settings will still show that a recovery key has been setup - so that's perfectly normal! There's no option in the settings to display the recovery key to you.\n\nA: I had the same question myself and after some searching found the answer below from How to check for and remove FileVault2 iCloud recovery key.\nSince others might reach this question in the way I did, I've given an answer even though the OP asked years ago.\nRunning the following command will show you if there is a recovery key in iCloud or not.\nsudo fdesetup list -verbose -extended\n\nYou'll get an output like this:\nfdesetup: device path = /\nESCROW  UUID                                 TYPE     USER\n        XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX  OS User  xxxxxxxx\n        XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX  iCloud   Recovery Record\n\n", "Q: Stop password characters from being shown When I type in a password in iOS 11.4.1, the last entered character is shown only for a split second.\nFor security reasons, I do not want the characters to get echoed. How do I disable this split second preview and show only the dots instead?\n\nA: Short answer, it is not possible to do so.\nThis functionality is built into iOS and it is by design. Showing a character for split second lets the user visually verify that correct character is entered.\nIf you are concerned about someone watching over your shoulder, consider using a password manager. Apple's iCloud keychain can store and enter passwords for you. If you upgrade to iOS 12, built-in support for 3rd party password managers in included in iOS. You get an option to enter password via it in the keyboard toolbar area. When entering password using password manager, no character is echoed and only dots are shown.\nWhile it is also possible to use password manager in iOS 11.4.1, you'll have to resort to manually copying and pasting the password where the characters aren't echoed.\nPassword Autofill in iOS 12 now works with 1Password, Dashlane, and LastPass\n", "Q: Can't get write permission on external hard drive when exporting from Lightroom A few days ago I bought a new 2018 MacBook Pro which is running macOS High Sierra 10.13.6. I have been a Windows user till then.\nAfter I edited my photos on the new Mac in Lightroom, I plugged in my external drive (WD My Passport) and I went on to export them. In Lightroom I got an error that said I can't export on that drive since it has only read privileges or something like that. So I went on to googling the issue and found out that I have to change the permission. I tried that but the next obstacle was that the Apply to enclosed items option is greyed out.\nI googled that problem but i haven't found a solution so far. Is this problem happening because I have to reformat my external drive on something other that NTFS? Or is there a setting i missed? Or something completely different.\n\nA: macOS doesn't natively contain the software (drive) to write onto a disk formatted with NTFS (but it can read NTFS formatted drives fine). That's what the error is implying that only read privileges are available.\nA drive formatted with NTFS can be written to by installing NTFS driver software in macOS. For writing to external disks made by WD, you will need to install a proprietary NTFS driver for macOS provided by the disk manufacturer called Paragon NTFS Driver for Mac.\nYou can follow the instructions in this support article on WD website, How to Install the Paragon NTFS Driver for Mac, to install the software and gain the ability to write files to the disk.\n\nA: this issue started for me when I updated to 10.13.6 from 10.13.4. It seems like the current/latest version of Paragon NTFS Driver for Mac is not supported for Macos 10.13.6. Please let me know if anyone finds a workaround or a solution to this problem. \n", "Q: Update Photo on iOS I would like to update a photo (Photo A) with another (Photo B).\nThe result should be that Photo A looks like Photo B, but can be reverted back to Photo A. Is there an extension that will let me do this on iOS? I am using the External Editors extension to achieve this on the Mac.\nFor example, on a Mac I can choose to edit a RAW image from the Photos app with Lightroom and I then end up with two identical images. \nI would like to be able to do the same sort of thing in iOS so that I can edit a RAW file and then revert back to it later, but without having to see it in the library. \n\nA: Assuming you're referring to the Photos.app library and application in terms of wanting it not to be visible in the library: You can hide the old RAWs so they don't show up in the main views of the library, though they'll still be there (which is good in the case you want to revert to them) - you can set the old RAW as Hidden on iOS by selecting it in the library and pressing the action button (the blue square and up arrow) and then selecting Hide Photo. They won't appear in your main library then, but rather only in a Hidden album.\nTo get them back in the main library, first go to the Hidden album and select the RAWs you want back. Then you can use the action button and select Unhide to have them reappear in the main library.\n\nA: Just in case you're not aware, iOS does support photo extensions that allow users to do more advanced editing of their images.\nYou can use photo extensions as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Photos app\n\n*Select a photo you'd like to edit\n\n*Tap the Edit option at top right\n\n*Tap on the More icon in the menubar at bottom of the screen (i.e. the circle icon with the three dots in it)\n\n*Now you'll see a list of apps that support photo extensions1\n\n*Tap on the one(s) you want to access for editing your photo with\n\n\n1.

I asked a question about it on here, and it turned out that the shortcut key was changed to Control.\nIn the last few beta versions of macOS Mojave as well as the public release, unfortunately, this does not seem to be working anymore. I tried all combinations of modifier keys that I could think up of, but nothing seems to work.\nIs there any other new shortcut for zooming an image in Quick Look on macOS Mojave?\n\nA: In the beta, it was Control to actual size, Option to come back to fit in\n\nA: \nIs there any other new shortcut for zooming an image to actual size in Quick Look on the latest version of macOS Mojave?\n\nIn the public release of macOS Mojave 10.14, Command + 0 keyboard sequence appears to achieve the desired function.\nTo zoom back out again use the keyboard shortcut Command + 9.\nYou can use Command+ and Command- to Zoom in and Zoom Out, like you can do at Preview app.\n\nA: If you have a Trackpad (or similar), you can use the \"parting two-fingers\" gesture to zoom in on a QuickLook preview.\n", "Q: Apple Watch Series 4 + iPhone XS Not Staying Connected I've done some research to determine what indicators on the status screen indicate varying levels of connectivity between the Apple Watch and the iPhone. So I now understand that without the green \"phone\" icon on your status screen on the watch, your watch isn't connected (via Bluetooth) to your phone.\nWhat I have is:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone XS Max -- two of them -- different iCloud accounts\n\n*Apple Watch Series 4 -- two of them -- each one is paired to one of the iPhones\n\n\nI got my new devices, restored them from iCloud backups (upgrading from iPhone 8 Pluses / Series 3 watches), and paired the watches to the phones. The initial pair resulted in a successful Bluetooth connection between the watches and the phones.\nThen, after some period of time, even without taking the phone out of range of the watch, the watch disconnected from bluetooth. The watches now fall back to WiFi. They are all on the same WiFi network as the phones, so they get a partial connection, but certain features like health data can't be transferred over WiFi, and also, far as I know, WiFi uses more battery on the watch than Bluetooth.\nRebooting the phone/watch does not solve the problem. Toggling Bluetooth and Airplane Mode on both does not solve the problem. The watch can update network-connected features on widgets/complications using the WiFi connection, but things like watch face settings edited in the Watch App on the iPhone never get synced to the watch because it lacks a direct Bluetooth connection to an iPhone.\nIt seems like there is a regression in connection reliability that is causing Watches and iPhones to stay disconnected from one another, persistently, after the first connection drops. This never occurred with my last-gen devices on iOS 11, but I am not sure if the problem is iOS 12 related or device related. \nBut in either case, the problem is affecting two separate pairs of Watch/iPhone so it isn't just one device. Both watches and phones are not the exact same model: one's an iPhone XS Max 512GB black, the other is an iPhone XS Max 256GB silver. One watch is 44mm cellular and the other is 40mm wifi.\nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: For some reason, with the latest Apple devices, if you immediately pair your new Watch to your new phone on initial setup, the Bluetooth connection doesn't appear to \"stick\" beyond the initial connection. The first time your phone goes out of range of your watch, will permanently break the connection.\nOnce you unpair and re-pair your watch to your phone, the connection will start working properly again. So you must pair your watch to your phone after your phone is completely set up, in order to get the connection to stay.\nAlso, it will give you an Unpairing Error when you attempt to unpair from the phone side. You then have to completely factory reset your watch, then restore the watch from an iCloud backup when you re-pair it. This is the only way I've found to fix this problem, and so far the fix appears to be permanent.\n", "Q: How to automatically trigger a iOS Shortcut (based on location/calendar) I've done a lot of research and it looks like the only way to run Apple iOS shortcuts is manually - i.e. you have to manually do the trigger - either by pressing a button, getting Siri to do it (by 'manually asking') or by (manually) getting another app to run it. I've yet to be able to get another app to run it automatically (yes, I'm sure this is to do with security/privacy implications, but if it's based on a shortcut that's only on my phone, then I'm happy with the security/privacy).\nI've looked at getting IFTTT to run the trigger (which it can do - for example, based on my location, or based on the start of an event in my Google Calendar), however the 'most' I can then do is to get that trigger to run an IFTTT Rich Notification on my iPhone - yes I can then click on that notification pop-up (which launches a shortcut via shortcuts://open-shortcut?name=[name]), but that still relies on me clicking the shortcut.\nA couple of people have run iOS shortcuts as the trigger for an IFTTT action, but I'm trying to do this the other way around.\nSo what I'd like to be able to do is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*run an iOS shortcut when I leave a location\n\n*run it with no manual intervention\n\n\nA: Unfortunately this is not possible (yet). It's a known limitation of Shortcuts in its current 2.0 implementation.\nFederico Viticci mentioned this in his (epic) iOS 12 review as something he'd like to see in the future:\nhttps://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-12-the-macstories-review/12/#content\n\nA: After updating to the iOS 13, you can open Shortcuts (it's now installed by default). On the bottom menu there is a tab called \"Automations\". There, you can set triggers to start actions, just like normal shortcuts.\nThere are both triggers for location or date/time related events.\n\nA: I was looking for the same thing, but I believe that running shortcuts automatically without user interaction is not going to happen anytime soon in iOS.\nSince I never really liked how the workarounds felt like, I solved this problem for myself and made an app called Pushcut that integrates push notifications with shortcuts.\nYou can run linked shortcut with one tap on a notification, or define multiple options as actions. Not \"automatic in the background\", but as close as you can get with iOS. \nI use it mainly with my openHAB home automation and IFTTT webhooks - but it is quite versatile. I hope somebody else finds this useful too.\n\n\nA: I guess the best for now is, that you can add your own shortcut as a reminder. Then when it appears on the screen just tap on it and it will execute whatever, but it still requires some interaction.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/apdacfdf1802/ios\n\nA: I was also trying to make the Shortcuts work without my manual input. I think due to security reasons Apple will not allow triggering Shortcuts without user action, though that's not specified in their iOS Security Guide. I've tried repeat and wait commands, but the shortcut stops execution if you turn off the screen.\nThere is a lot to do with Shortcuts app is it is, more integrations and apps to be added, stability and performance improvements required, so I think Apple will continue to work on the app itself and may add this feature much later. \n\nA: Have you tried instead of this:\nshortcuts://open-shortcut?name=[name]\nDo this:\nshortcuts://run-shortcut?name=[name]\n\nA: Launch Center Pro allows you to set locations triggers for actions. Use the Workflow/Shortcuts Action to trigger a shortcut at a location or certain time. It’s not quite what you’re looking for as it still requires tapping a notification, but it might work for you in certain situations. \n\nA: It appears that you can now trigger events when you leave or arrive or leave a location. Check the Shortcut gallery. \n\nA: You can use an app called \"launcher pro\" that will trigger a shortcut based on location. So long as the location is setup within launcher pro. \n\nA: This is the list of automation triggers scheduled to be released with iOS 13 for the Shortcuts app. \nIt's a long and useful list that covers up most of automation scenario.\nhttps://www.macstories.net/news/the-full-list-of-automation-triggers-in-shortcuts-for-ios-13/\n", "Q: What's the purpose of Mac firmware standalone updates still offered by Apple online? I'm learning Mac troubleshooting and have stumbled upon this article several times, which very clearly explains that you can download and install these updates from macOS itself:\nAbout EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers (no longer updated since Published Date: 25 September 2017)\nJust for the sake of knowledge, what's the purpose of these updates?  \nThese are older versions of the firmware, and you can't use them to update your firmware as you'll obviously have a later update, neither to downgrade the firmware. Neither to install the firmware if your Mac fails and upgrade (for that purpose there's an installation CD you can use).  \nIn what scenario would you use these?\n\nA: Generally speaking, these firmware updates are for reliability, but as EFI/UEFI become more and more complicated compared to BIOS, there are also security vulnerabilities that require patching.\nOne good example is the fairly recent Thunderstrike 2 rootkit vulnerability.\nApple has not included optical media for system restoration since Mac OS X 10.7 \"Lion.\"\n\nA: Most of the assumptions and reasonings in the question are spot on.\nHowever, one is not:\n\nThese are older versions of the firmware, and you can't use them to update your firmware as you'll obviously have a later update, neither to downgrade the firmware either.\n\nThis is not obvious and not necessarily true.\nFirst of all, these updates are for Intel-based Mac-computers. Those came out in 2006 (MacBookPro 1,1) and had a modified version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger installed. Some of those may still be around and were perhaps never updated (Grampa likes his tools to not change). \nWhile you and Apple seem to assume that \n\nMost firmware updates are automatically installed when you update or upgrade OS X. Some firmware updates are also available as downloads you can install manually. If your Mac needs a firmware update and it isn't installed automatically, check to see if a manual updater is listed below. \n\nThis \"most\" is invalidated in companies or schools that rolled out installations as images, not via an actual installer. With this now no longer recommended method you get a fully functional OS installation, but as the install-part is skipped, so is the installation of firmware updates. This is true even for the latest versions of macOS, which in theory require updates delivered within the installer for APFS compatibility, but if you bypass the install (for example to keep your filesystem as HFSplus) and go the image route you also do not really need these parts of updates. This method was recommended by Apple in the good old days…\nSome of those models listed oin that page are also of vintage status and not supported by the newest versions of macOS which rolls out firmware updates by OS-installation. All those models not supported in Sierra…\nOr as commentator Allan put it:\n\nIf you’re running an older version of macOS/OS X for application compatibility reasons and cannot upgrade to a newer version. That’s one scenario…\n\nSo there were many and there are now a few cases where Macs were in operation with an older firmware version despite updates being available. Since these updates usually contained fixes for serious problems discovered and then tried to be rectified via such an update, it is usually a good idea to ensure that they are kept at their latest versions.\n\nOne usage example: You get your hands on a \"sold as defect\" MacBook Pro 15inch early 2011 2.0GHz with Mac OS X 10.6 still on it cheaply. You can be sure that the firmware is outdated. The GPU chip is now broken as so many, the battery out of juice. You replace the battery and revive that thing with lobotomy of the GPU. You then boot up and install a younger OS, Yosemite performs best on these. You turn on full disk encryption FileVault2 and notice quite a slow down, also your brand new battery behaves suboptimally and soon says that it will need replacement.    \nHow to fix that?\nYou improve energy management with an SMC update that improves the loading behaviour relating to the battery. \nNow that you enjoy a good energy behaviour you still notice the slowdown from FileVault2. Why is that? The CPU in that model shipped as\n\nCore i7-2635QM – AES-NI – No \n\nmeaning that the encryption has no hardware acceleration unlike the bigger models. How to fix that? Download and install teh EFI firmware update standalone installer for that model that for the last 3 or 4 versions contained very silently also a microcode update from Intel delivered by Apple in that way that simply enabled AES-NI on these lowly chips.\n\nA: The SMC is an integrated circuit (chips) on your logic board and it is mostly for hardware management like battery and fans.\nThe EFI is reserved partition on your hard drive and contains booting information/sequence. macOS High Sierra automatically checks a Mac's EFI firmware against Apple's database of \"known good\" data to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.\nThe PRAM is also a chip on your board and it stores system settings (yours).\nThey usually have generic operations like choice of start up disk or Fan speed control, battery functions, booth sequence .. \nThus they remain same (unchanged) for few generations of OS X. \nWhen you update them is for example more precise Battery control to extend the life, or change in booting sequence.\n", "Q: Mac Mini 1TB HDD being 100% full - cant mount, cant boot I just unburied an old 2007 Mac Mini Server which I had put a 1TB drive into. I had kinda forgotten why it broke, but after a while I remembered...the hard way.\nThat Mac's hard drive is so full and loaded that it pretty much literally has not a single bit - not byte, bit - of free storage. As MacOS tries to extend the disk journal when mounting, it hits a limitation and fails to mount. I realized that during Target Disk Mode when I was hoping to get in there in order to hopefuly just erase some stuff off it so it would boot properly again.\nIt does actually go into the boot, but it does NOT actually boot - it just hangs up, and stalls.\nI am currently considering to try and breach in using GParted - but I am actually not sure if I had encrypted the drive with FileVault... So just in case, here's the question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I possibly resurrect that old Mac Mini Server from my own Mac? I can see the drive as /dev/disk3 and especially the mount voluem as /dev/disk3s2. But with each mounting attempt, a new disk node pops up, eventually even growing beyond 10 (disk10, disk11, ...).\n\n*If I can not do that from another Mac, is there something else I can do? Like, I had considered to utilize GParted, but I bet there are also other solutions. Which ones would you recommend?\n\n\nI also can not absolutely - although its not very likely - rule out that the disk itself is broken too - either the reader or the motor. Any way that I can figure this out?\nThanks!\n\nA: Create a bootable USB stick and boot the Mac off that. Make sure to use a MacOS version that is at least as recent as the Mac Mini’s date of manufacture, but not so new that it doesn’t support a 2007 Mac Mini. Apple’s instructions for creating a bootable USB drive are here. Then you can mount the hard drive (as long as you have the password, if it’s encrypted) and delete some files. Remember to empty the trash to actually get rid of them. \n", "Q: How to get rid of \"application downloaded from the internet\" message when installing homebrew casks? I used homebrew cask to install many applications for quite a while now. But recently macOS keeps asking me to first confirm the \"application downloaded from the internet\" question that is usually only displayed for apps that are run for the first time. \n\nWhat happened and how can I get rid of this?\nUpdate\nI use an admin account to install apps (brew cask install calibre), but I basically use a non-admin account all the time. I can get rid of the message by logging into the admin account and launching the app once and then the message disappears also for the user account.\n\nA: As you mentioned in your update, you can open the application as an admin user. A more direct way is to run this command as an admin:\nxattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Calibre.app\n\n\nA: More of a workaround than a solution: Launching the App from an account with admin privileges once, makes the message disappear also for the non-admin account. Not sure if this is a bug or a feature... In the past it used to work like that also from non-admin accounts.\n\nA: Wohoo! I just realized that there is apparently now a built-in solution to the problem! Homebrew offers a --no-quarantine flag. That means one can now install casks without the annoying message, by using\nbrew install --no-quarantine calibre\n\nor\nbrew reinstall --no-quarantine calibre\n\nUpdate: There is currently a bug in Homebrew that prevents the latter command (reinstall) from working.\nTo make this a default option, add this to your profile:\necho 'export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS=--no-quarantine' >> ~/.profile\n\n\nA: You need to allow it, in the system preferences.\nOpen the Terminal app from the /Applications/Utilities/ folder and then enter the following command syntax:\nsudo spctl --master-disable\n\nHit return and authenticate with an admin password\nRelaunch System Preferences and go to “Security & Privacy” and the “General” tab\nYou will now see the “Anywhere” option under ‘Allow apps downloaded from:’ Gatekeeper options\n\nDo not forget to change it back for your safety. \nsudo spctl --master-enable\n\nAlternative method is to remove the Apple imposed Quarantine using Terminal command.\nFor example, if all of the files are in ~/Downloads/ then you would use:\nxattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/\n\n", "Q: How to map CTRL + Left Arrow to Home with Karabiner-Elements I'm using Karabiner-Elements to map some keys with an external PC keyboard.

Only both 6 pin ends will be able to provide the power your GPU needs under full stress.\n", "Q: What are the App Store fees for subscription to an IoT hardware product? I'm looking for clarification on the App Store fees charged by Apple for a hardware related app. Refer to the relevant App Store Review Guideline:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#hardware-specific-content\nWhen the app provides the UI for an external IoT device, and there is an annual fee charged to the user (which may be via an external link) does Apple charge a percentage?\nMy reading of this line is that no fee is charged.\n\nwhen features are dependent upon specific hardware to function, the app may unlock that functionality without using in-app purchase.\n\nThe app only has value when receiving data from the IoT device. Intention is to charge an annual subscription, paid via external link.\nI have the same question for the same scenario with an Android app.\nAn example of this, is the Nest Cam. The cam is bought in a store and the app downloaded at no cost. The camera works with the app on a free basis.\nThere is an upgrade to premium storage and features paid by subscription to Nest Aware. Does Nest pay a fee to Apple/Google for the subscription?  I'd expect not, as the features are dependent on the camera.\n\nA: Quoting the text from App Store Review Guideline verbatim:\n\n3.1.4 Hardware-Specific Content: In limited circumstances, such as when features are dependent upon specific hardware to function, the app may unlock that functionality without using in-app purchase (e.g. an astronomy app that adds features when synced with a telescope). App features that work in combination with an approved physical product (such as a toy) on an optional basis may unlock functionality without using in-app purchase, provided that an in-app purchase option is available as well. You may not, however, require users to purchase unrelated products or engage in advertising or marketing activities to unlock app functionality.\n\nFrom your question:\n\nWhen the app provides the UI for an external IoT device, and there is an annual fee charged to the user (which may be via an external link) does Apple charge a percentage?\n\nHow are you charging the fees from the user? If you are charging it via In-App purchase or recurring subscription, Apple takes its cut. If you are charging the user via external means and your app doesn't violate any App Store guideline, Apple won't charge anything.\n\nMy reading of this line is that no fee is charged.\n\nYour understanding is right and no fees will be charged.\nIn case of Nest Aware (I have never used the app), if the user buys the subscription via In-App purchase made in iOS, Apple will take it's cut.\n", "Q: Export video to Live Photo So everywhere I see how to convert a Live Photo into a video or a gif, but how do you save a video as a Live Photo? \nThe goal here is to take a video and make a Live Photo for use on iOS lock screen. \n\nA: intoLive - Live Wallpapers app is the app you are looking for.\nIt takes a video and exports it to Live Photo which can be set as video wallpaper on supported devices.\n", "Q: Tab or Session Manager for Safari 12? Safari 12 improved the security of the browser by killing off the older API.

I recently bought a 2018 Macbook Pro and the fonts display considerably different than the 2016 Macbook Pro with the same software. Both laptops are running OSX 10.13.6. Fonts on the 2018 Macbook Pro have an orange/yellow hue around the fonts. Almost like a strange chromatic aberration.  Please see images below. \n\n\nIs there anything I can do here. The fonts are pretty difficult to read. Thanks! \n\nA: From the photo you posted it looks like the Dell is running wrong (low) resolution. Check that.\nAlso\nCheck what Profiles is used for the Dell.\nIn Color Sync Utility, in the Utility Folder.\nIn there you can run verify and repair function.\n\nand verify what profile is used for the Dell.\n\nSome background:\nApple's ColorSync Utility is built in to OS X. ColorSync profiles are used in image-rendering devices so colors will match across different devices. For instance, if you have two monitors attached to your system that are of different makes or models, then it is likely their pixel response ranges are slightly different. As a result, reds may be more vivid on one monitor than on another one, or the blues may be deeper. These variations can be allowed for by creating a color profile for each device, so when image data is passed between them they will display it accurately.\nIn my case, I do not have Dell to show you its profile.\nSome more reading material.\n", "Q: Can I use MST on one mDP and 4k on the other?

When both mDP are in use, it drops to 30hz.\nWhen I have just the MST hub hooked up, both displays work, but are only recognized as a single display in System Preferences. It seems to be working more like a splitter than an MST hub.  I thought this might be because only one mDP or the other is 1.2, but this is the situation no matter which it is plugged into.\nSo, 2 questions, and a plea for help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are the mini DisplayPorts on my MacBook Pro 1.2 or 1.0? If they are\n1.2 then my MST hub should allow the displays to be recognized separately, right?\n\n*Why does my display drop from 60hz to 30hz when both mDP are used?\n\n*How can I get this arrangement setup?\n\nA: Turns out macOS only support MST on thunderbolt and for >4k screens, but not for daisy chaining or multiple displays on mDP 1.2.  Point for Windows on this one, I guess.\n", "Q: How to remove slo-mo tags from iOS videos using exiftool? I have some slo-mo videos recorded that have been reverted back to normal speed. The problem is that the iOS Photos app still recognizes those videos as \"slo-mo\", and therefore places them in the \"Slo-Mo\" folder.\nSimilar to organizing burst photos in the \"Bursts\" folder, I can easily remove the BurstUUID using exiftool, which upon re-uploading the photo in the MAC Photos app, the photos are removed from the \"Bursts\" folder.\nHowever, I don't see something similar to a \"Slo-Mo\" tag.\nDoes anyone know if this can be achieved?\n\nA: There is no tag for slo-mo. Photo uses the frame rate (over 60fps) of the video to decide wether it is a slo-mo or not. GoPro videos with 120fps appear also in the slo-mo folder.\nYou have to convert the video to 60fps or less to achieve this, iMovie should work for this.\n", "Q: How do I activate the flashlight during a front-facing camera recording?

For example, when I open a third party news app, instead of opening to the homepage with new and updated articles, it opens to the article that I was reading when I closed the app. I am experiencing this problem with all my apps and was wondering if it could be related to background app refresh setting which I currently have turned off.\n\nA: You are confusing between two different features available in iOS.\nWhat you are observing is the iOS default behaviour and is called state restoration. As long as an iOS device has available memory (main memory or RAM), it preserves the running state of most recently used app(s). The assumption is that the user is likely to re-open the recently used app.\nBackground app refresh setting is relevant for apps that need to communicate with remote sever over the Internet to fetch data (typical example of such apps is social networking, email client apps etc.). Enabling background app refresh for an app (if enabled), will let iOS fetch data for such app at opportunate moments (such as when iOS device data connection is activated). This enables the apps to instantly present up-to-date data to users when launched, thereby providing a good user experience.\nSince invoking device radio costs a relatively higher battery usage penalty, enabling this setting ensures best user experience while optimising resource usage.\n", "Q: How to detect network change (unplugging/plugging cable)? I have read at multiple places that the folder /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration is supposed to \"change\" in case that I unplug a network cable.\nNow, I have a MacBook Pro, so I use a USB3 adapter to connect a network cable.\nIndeed, nothing changes when I plug or unplug it within this folder. I clearly see in \"Network settings\" that the LAN connection is established or dropped when I plug or unplug the cable.\nWhere should anything change? Is there some folder or anything else that I can use as trigger for AppleScript, when plugging/unplugging the network cable?\n\nA: This project in Github does what you are looking for - look in there to see how he is doing it. https://github.com/paulbhart/toggleairport\nHe watches these three files to determine that the network status has changed:\n\n*\n\n*/private/var/run/resolv.conf\n\n*/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist\n\n*/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n\nThe purpose of his project is to turn off WiFi if the LAN is connected, and turn it back on again if the LAN is disconnected.\n\nA: Save this script as an application and set it to run on startup. It will use some memory but the script is very light. You can delay even more. Mind that this routine will keep detecting the cable forever, so you must set other conditions inside your script to do what you need and stop until something changes.\n\n\non run {input}\n    repeat\n        set input to do shell script \"ifconfig -a\" as text\n        set status to offset of \"status:\" in input\n        set the_starting_point to status + 0\n        set the_ending_point to status + 13\n        set isCableConnected to characters the_starting_point thru the_ending_point of input as string\n        if isCableConnected is \"status: active\" then\n            display dialog \"Ethernet On\"\n        else\n            display dialog \"Cable Unplugged\"\n        end if\n        delay 1\n    end repeat\nend run\n\n\n\nA: Maybe you can use a shortcut to activate your script since you are already plugging the cable anyway.

I know there's already a similar question about this, but the answer \"If you don't need their contents, you can delete both of them.\" is not clear to me because I need the contents, just not three copies of them. So I guess the question is: are these folders like old backups? Is that the reason there is many of them: they are backups from different times?\nHere is my situation:\n \nThe first screenshot is of the three folders I'd like to delete. The second one is the \"true location\" of the data on icloud. \nThanks in advance\n\nA: When you turn off iCloud syncing - everything that was in the location for syncing gets moved here.\nWhen you have syncing enabled - the location where newly created (not yet saved to the cloud) files get written is: \n~/Library/Mobile Documents\n\nThat location also keeps copies of cloud backed files present locally while you have space on the Mac. Over time, if you start running low on space, they get deleted from the local cache and only exist as stub files that cause the actual files to be downloaded from iCloud.\nYou have several versions of archive since you have turned off syncing several times.

But specifically, it get a 90% power efficiency rating at 100V, 115V and 230V which far exceeds the 85% minimum threshold set by the EPA to be Energy Star v6.0 compliant\n\nFrom EPA Energy Start requirements:\n\nInternal power supplies: 85% minimum efficiency at 50% of rated\noutput, 82% minimum efficiency at 20% and 100% of rated output, with\nPower Factor > 0.9 at 100% of rated output for power supplies with >=\n75W output power\n\nApple Power Supplies\nApple's power supplies from the base model MacBook to the top of the line iMac Pro all use power supplies with high efficiency\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Environmental Report\n\n*iMac Pro Environmental Report\nTo achieve this level of efficiency, this basically requires PFC.  Looking at a tear down of a MacBook power adapter, we can see the PFC circuitry.\n\nSo, bottom line is that your Mac Pro has a PFC power supply\nUPS with sine wave output.\nUnless you are running sensitive (and that being the operative word) equipment that will react badly to non-sine wave or simulated sine wave power output, you have no need for this.  By sensitive, I mean things like scientific instrumentation, network communication gear (telco), high-end audio electronics, etc.\nApple's products are robust enough to withstand the fluctuations in standard UPSes and from the electrical grid.\nFrom personal experience, I have used UPSes (Uninterrupted Power Supply) from APC and CyberPower purchased at the local big box store on sale; and as a resident in FL with frequent power outages during the summer months, neither have failed to keep my computers (Apple, Dell, Synology, etc.) running without issue.\nTL;DR\nYes, you have a PFC (Power Factor Corrected) power supply.  All Apple computers have a PFC power supply.\nNo.  You don't need a “sine waveform UPS”.  It will not hurt to get one, but your benefits will be negligible; a standard UPS will work fine.\nIt's likely the rep is reading a Feature/Benefit chart and attempting to up-sell you on a product you don't really need.\n\nA: No - the support person you spoke with is confused. The specifications that Apple has published for the late 2013 Mac Pro make no mention of a power factor corrected input. And as far as the Mac Pro having a PFC power supply, it may well have one... but that's so that you don't have to buy a pure sinewave UPS! \nIf you speak with him again, invite him to join the discussion here, and make his case :) \n", "Q: How to add managed GSuite account with mail disabled to iOS 12.0?

While downloading files, I want to drag them from the bottom download bar in Chrome, the Finder disappears behind the Chrome window when I try to drag and drop the file. Is there a way to lock the Finder window so that it stays in front of the Chrome window when I drag and drop. I was able to do this before I updated Google Chrome to the latest version so it might be a software bug on their end.\n\nA: Your Chrome Downloads history is here\nchrome://downloads/\nthe actual download is already on your mac in the specified folder.\nTo specify where to download from Chrome, go to settings > Downloads.\nThe bar at the bottom of the Chrome window is FYI only, not the place where the downloads reside.\nThe downloads are already on you Mac and you do not have to drag them to the Finder.\n\nA: If you are on a mac, you can hold down the command key while drag&dropping from the downloads bar to keep the finder window on top.\nI believe this was indeed the default behavior earlier and was changed at some point.\n", "Q: Can I put my Photos library on an external hard drive also used for Time Machine? So, I am new to Macs, and I have a MacBook Air.\nI've got lots of phots to import into the Photos program, so I decided to stick them all on an external hard drive.\nI have also used that hard drive for Time Machine backups.\nThen I saw this warning on the Apple Support page: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/photos/system-photo-library-overview-pht211de786/mac\n\nWARNING: If a Photos library is located on an external drive, don’t\n  use Time Machine to store a backup on that external drive. The\n  permissions for your Photos library may conflict with those for the\n  Time Machine backup.\n\nMy external hard drive simply has a folder for the backups (backups.backupd) and folder called Pictures that contains my photo library.\nI don't quite understand the warning. Can the two really not be on the same disk (I don't understand why) or is it saying that I can't use Time Machine to backup the photo library on that disk, which makes some sense...\nHow are the permissions in the Pictures folder affected by anything that Time Machine is doing? Isn't Time Machine only interested in the backups.backupd folder?\nSorry if this is a dumb question, but I can't seem to find an clear answer.\n\nA: You can avoid this problem by making two partitions on one drive - one for Photos, the other for Time Machine.\nThe safest way to do this would be to temporarily move your Photos Library to another drive first, shrink the existing Time Machine prtition, then add a new partition for Photos & move back again.\n", "Q: How do I change the login screen background in macOS Mojave? I just updated to macOS Mojave, and immediately noticed a couple of things:\n\n\n*\n\n*My custom login screen wallpaper is gone.\n\n*When you click on a user's name in the login screen, it switches to their personal background (their usual wallpaper for the first space on the primary monitor).\n\n\nI assumed it had just overwritten my cached image file. But when I went to replace it, nothing happened. It turns out that com.apple.desktop.admin.png is gone entirely!\n\nRight after taking that screenshot, I decided to poke into Desktop Pictures and found my personal login screen background, which looks promising. It contains one other folder, which  probably  (edit: confirmed) contains the login screen background of my administrator account.\n\nA: Expanding on Leonard's answer:\nYou can do this by replacing the Mojave.heic default desktop background. This does not require disabling SIP, as it's in /Library.\n\n*\n\n*Back up /Library/Desktop Pictures/Mojave.heic by copying it to Mojave.heic.orig or similar.\n\n\n*Get your new image and scale/crop it to exactly fit the display. If you don't know your screen resolution, you can go to  > About This Mac.\n\n\n*Replace Mojave.heic with your new file. Don't worry if it's JPG or similar, it'll still work even after you rename it to Mojave.heic.*\n\n\n*If you have FileVault enabled, change a login option in System Preferences. For example, whether to show a list of users or name and password fields. Just change it back if you don't actually want it changed.\nThis is because when you boot with FileVault, at the login screen your system hasn't really booted up all the way! It's actually running a tiny system on your EFI partition, since your main partition is encrypted. Changing a login option will make System Preferences change the EFI system's settings, including picking up the wallpaper change. See this answer.\n\n\n*Reboot and enjoy!\n* I've only tested this with JPEG images, but it may work for other types.\n\nCompletely Unnecessary Timesaver\nI've made a small Swift program that does all this for you (it detects the OS version and works both on Mojave and earlier versions). You'll need Xcode to compile it.\nIt shouldn't break your system, but I can't guarantee anything -- make sure you have backups first!\nThis is now also available on GitHub.

In order to make Notification Center readable again, do:\ndefaults write com.apple.notificationcenterui NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool No\n\n\nA: Try this: \n\ndefaults write com.apple.Spotlight NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool No\n\nPS: Remember reboot or logout\n\nA: Try this:\ndefaults write -g NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool Yes\nThen logout or restart. Then go to the system preferences and select dark mode. It will make top bar and dock dark while everything else in light mode.\nTo revert it back:\ndefaults write -g NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool No\n\nEDIT: Please also have a look on the answers bellow, they are needed in order to make other parts working, like notification center & spotlight. Run all of the commands, and then logout.

I am currently using MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) with macOS High Sierra (10.3.6) and this option is not available by default.\nIs it possible to change this default setting and bring back the old behaviour?\n\nA: You'll need to keep your MacBook Pro awake while the lid is closed. There is no setting within macOS that lets you override the default behaviour (enter sleep mode when the lid is closed).\nYou can use a free 3rd party app called InsomniaX. It lets you disable the sleep mode while the lid is closed.\n\nIt always has been a missing feature: disabling the sleep mode on a Apple Laptop. Who does not want to use it as a big juke-box or go warwalking. The best looking server ever, especially at about one inch height.

The app will now update properly.\nIf you're on Mojave you have to uninstall and reinstall the app. \n", "Q: Mapping signatures to aliases in Mail.app Is there any way of mapping a particular signature to a particular alias in Mail.app?\nI have 3 email aliases in one account so I've set up 3 separate signatures. When I receive an email to one of these aliases, Mail.app correctly chooses the alias to use when replying, but it won't allow me to tie a particular signature to that alias. Instead it always automatically chooses the first signature, I have to manually change the signature when writing the email. \nIs there any way to address this? It seems like a major shortcoming, and at the moment is the only thing stopping me from using Mail.app. \n\nA: In a word, no . . .\nUnless you can create each alias as a separate account (as suggested in a comment to the OP,) Mail.app won't be able to apply a unique signature to them respectively.\nThat being said, and if you don't want to create distinct accounts in Mail, you might consider using the text expansion feature of OS X.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, open the Mail app and copy your desired signature into the clipboard.

An old (2014) link suggests that it is possible to do a full video recording (video+audio) on a mac with Quicktime, using only free software.\nThat seemed a little bit too good to be true, and when I tried it\nout on my recently bought MacBook Air with MacOS 10.13.6 and QuickTime 10.4 installed, I wasn't surprised to see it go wrong. The main problem is that as soon as audio is turned on in a QuickTime screen video, it starts repeating continuously an unbearable sequence of (mostly strident and high frequency) sounds in the background which all but hides any other sound. And yes, I double-checked the \"Use ambient noise reduction\" boxes to be checked and the volumes to be set reasonably in System Prefs > Sound. \nThis background theme sounds a lot like a proposital handicap, to be removed by payable additional sofware. I googled and browsed apple pages, but did not find any real explanation.\nRelated (but older, and perhaps a little outdated) questions : here, there\n\nA: There are three different auto levels involved with a recording. The first two can be set from System Preferences, as shown below.\n\nThe input volume is the record level from either the built-in mic or input jack. The output volume controls level for the internal speakers other device (such as headphone) you may plug into the output jack. The third auto level is set in QuickTime, as shown below.\n\nThis is the level used monitor what is being recorded. This is not the same level as the output volume shown in System Preferences.\nIf you are using the built-in mic or an external microphone and the internal or some other external speakers, then the System Preferences output volume and/or the Quick time level should set to zero. \nAlthough not directly asked in our question, I might as well add the following:\nIf you are trying to make a recording where the sound is being produced by the computer, then you need to plug a jumper into the input and output jacks. Say for example, you want to record video either from the camera or the screen and you want to sound to be music from iTunes, then you will to feed the sound from the output jack back into the input jack.\n", "Q: My own iPhone 7 is locked with foreign account after simple reset I have an issue with my iPhone 7 Plus, which today I wanted to replace with the XS.\nAfter backing it up to a Macbook and then resetting the old phone, I logged in to the Apple ID site to remove the IPhone from my account.

It seems that sips and other image rotation possibilities do not actually change the bits of the image, but just flip a switch for orientation, and I need to change the image bits. Anyway, I'm building the workflow using the \"Rotate Images\" action and it seems like it uses a ton of memory when you rotate multiple images (which is kind of the point of an automator action).

I think this behavior is more of an omission than a deliberate design decision, and checking \"Reduce Transparency\" in System Preferences>Accessibility>Display doesn't change how folders are displayed, that is, this is not caused by Desktop Tinting (more on Desktop Tinting below).\nAbout Desktop Tinting\nThere is a new Mojave feature called Desktop Tinting that only is activated when using Dark Mode. Desktop Tinting slightly modifies the color of windows to match your desktop picture.\nIf you want to disable Desktop Tinting, Graphite Mode will disable the color tinting altogether, according to, for example, Apple's Introducing Dark Mode WWDC 2018 Session and Ars Technica Mojave review.\nYou can find additional information about Desktop Tinting in the Introducing Dark Mode WWDC 2018 video (select the Transcript tab and search for \"desktop tinting\"):\n\n[D]esktop tinting (...) causes the window's background colors to camouflage\nthemselves with the desktop picture.\nWe found that completely\ndesaturated gray colors have a tendency to have a color temperature\nthat was sometimes in conflict with what your desktop picture was, and\nthis effect was magnified when you have a translucent sidebar area,\nfor example, against a solid opaque area of your window, and so\ndesktop tinting helps mitigate that.\nOnce applied, the desktop tinting\ngives the whole window a harmonious color scheme, which helps it to\nblend in with the surrounding areas and really reduces that color\ntemperature disparity.\n\nand the Ars Technica Mojave review:\n\nOne separate but related feature exclusive to Dark Mode is called\nDesktop Tinting, which goes beyond the translucent sidebars and other\nUI elements.\nEach window samples an “average” color from whatever\npiece of your desktop wallpaper it’s on top of and uses that color to\nsubtly tint every single window in the operating system. (...) Apple says that it’s meant to keep the bold Dark Mode windows from clashing with your chosen wallpaper.\n\n\nA: I found the actual location of the assets for the different folder versions:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/IconFoundation.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Assets.car\n\nUnfortunately these are only the icons for the default folder and not those specific documents/dev/music/… versions.

(via other answer to this question)\n\n\n\nWhile this question wasn't entirely clear on whether the issue was with the caffeinate command built in to macOS or the Caffeine utility written by Tomas Franzén of Lighthead Software, the comments and other answers seem to imply the latter.\nAfter encountering the issue myself, I reached out to Tomas and inquired about taking over the development of Caffeine. He graciously has provided the source code under an MIT license, and I've made a quick updated version available here that will prompt for the needed accessibility permissions when running on Mojave.\nI will be bringing additional support for Mojave as well as some improvements in the near future, but wanted to put this here for others who come across this question like I did and would like to continue using Caffeine.\n\nA: Here are 2 alternative you can try that do the same as caffeine.\nAmphetamine, a full-on Caffeine replacement\nand \nKeepingYouAwake, an up-to-date Caffeine clone\n\nA: AFAIK, caffeinate remains in Mojave, and it is certainly in High Sierra and Mojave. caffeinate is a command line utility; i.e. you invoke it from the terminal. If this is what you mean by \"manual entry\" then I'll guess you're not keen on doing things from the command line. \nHowever, caffeinate is quite easy to use. It also has the advantage of being supported by Apple, doesn't require cluttering your system with additional apps that will require your time to maintain/upgrade. I could go on, but... \nSo that's my answer. I mostly just wanted to make it clear that the caffeinate utility has not been deprecated by Apple.  \nEDIT:\nNote that caffeinate will NOT prevent an automatic logout. Check to make sure you have not selected that option; caffeinate is powerless against a logout. \n\nA: Hey there—I’m the creator of an alternative called Theine. Back in 2015 I’ve decided to create my own caffeine-like app because of the lack of support for retina displays.\n▶ Download: https://itunes.apple.com/app/theine-2/id955848755\nIt’s available on the Mac App Store and doesn’t require Accessibility (== admin) privileges at all.\n\n\nA: Below will start caffeinate -s supported by Apple as a macos launchctl daemon on computer startup.\n; cat >~/ze.caffeinate.plist <<'EOF'\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>ze.caffeinate</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/bin/caffeinate</string>\n        <string>-s</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\nEOF\n\n; sudo mv ~/ze.caffeinate.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/\n\n; sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/ze.caffeinate.plist\n...\n\n; sudo launchctl list |grep caffeinate                          \n4921    0   ze.caffeinate\n\n\n", "Q: Sapphire Radeon HD 7950 occasional flickers I just installed a new Sapphire Radeon HD 7950 video card into my Mac Pro (5,1 mid-2012). It works great, except occasionally, perhaps once every hour or so, the screen flickers. By \"flicker\" I mean that the entire image becomes garbled for just a fraction of a second and then returns to normal. The card's single dip-switch is set for Mac compatibility. No other video card is installed and I'm only running a single 30\" Apple Cinema HD Display.\nDoes anyone have any idea what might be causing these occasional \"hiccups\" and whether it is something that can be stopped?\n\nA: The \"hiccups\" could be due to poor cables. Previously I have seen that result in these \"flickers\" that come randomly once in a while.\nReplace the monitor cables with properly shielded, quality cables!\n", "Q: Moving Sim card to another phone I bought a new iPhone.  I want to put my wife's sim card into my old phone.  Her iphone is an iPhone 6+. The iPhone I want to put it into is an Iphone 7+.  I tried it and it doesn't work.\n\nA: Are both phones from the same company? Do you have a payment plan for either phone line? Most likely the sim is locked to the hardware from the provider. Usually, they only allow swapping if its a replacement or upgraded device from them.\n", "Q: Time Machine couldn't complete the backup This is the 2nd time I got this error message:\n\nOn my Mac Pro, I use two HDs for Time Machine backup. Time Machine would use them alternatively. The other HD works fine. With this HD, I used Disk Utility to perform \"First Aid\" and no problem was found. However, the Time Machine still cannot back up to this HD.\nOn the previous error, I had to reformat the HD. Any suggestions on what I should do this time?\n\nA: It turned out that App Cleaner is the root cause of the problem. I used App Cleaner for quite some time and have purchased the premium version. My problem with App Cleaner started with its V6.0 version and I was still on High Sierra. So it was not a Mac OS problem. \n\nA: Here is solution:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8561149\n I tried just now and works.\n", "Q: Can’t get my MBP running since macOS Mojave Since I updated my MBP, it doesn’t work anymore.

I can only access into Recovery.\nHow can I solve this error and install Mojave without losing my data?\n\nA: Had the same issue. Retina 5k imac. \nRebooted with cmd-r and restored from time machine. Everything is back and working even boot camp!\nWill be waiting before trying Mojave again. \n\nA: Faced the same issue. \"Lucky\" for me, I faced an installation issue on my MacBook Air when installing High Sierra, so had to create an install USB drive (google on how to do so) and also wiped out SSD content. Of course, I was able to boot into Target Disk Mode and copied documents into my iMac. \nNow when upgrading to Mojave on my iMac, face the same problem as you. Create USB boot for High Sierra installation, boot from USB, and reinstall High Sierra. Twice in a row means I will not try upgrading OSX for a long time! Many hours wasted! \n\nA: Same issue as reported by others on this thread.  Did also have issues installing High Sierra, my issue now is I cannot obtain a High Sierra image to make the bootable USB drive.  \nI dont have any real data on the machine so I'm wondering if a clean USB install of Mojave will work (that's how I got High Sierra on finally when that came out).  \nAnother note with regard to my Macbook Air that's having this problem is that it's a fusion drive (128Gb onboard HD that came with it and a 128Gb SD card in the slot)\n\nA: Resized my partition after the restore and installed Mojave on that partition without any issues. Right now I am thinking that the best way is to create a bootable Mojave USB installer and then erase my high sierra install and install Mojave on that empty disk later using the migration tool to bring back my apps and data from time machine.\nI am worried that I will lose access to my bootcamp partition.\n\nA: Found a way to install Mojave without starting from scratch.\nI created a bootable USB from those instructions:\nhttps://www.macworld.com/article/3284378/os-x/how-to-create-a-bootable-macos-mojave-installer-drive.html?page=2\nThen simply installed Mojave over my existing high sierra.

The search function works so it's connected fine. I've tried deleting all caches, etc\n\n\nA: I have found the solution (and origin) to this problem. Thanks @charles for giving me the insight. \nThe problem occurs because the new Mac App Store app CFBundleVersion is marked as 1 so if you have any copy of the old Mac App Store (which had CFBundleVersion over 459) in the system, macOS will think is the most recent version and will try to use it on the background.\nThis is why if you go the the Apple Logo > App Store… it tries to open the old version.\nDeleting the old app bundle from the system resolves the problem.\n\nA: I am seeing the same issue.\nNot really an answer but more diagnostic info:\n\n\n*\n\n*MBPro early 2015, 13-inch Retina\n\n*Tried resetting PRAM\n\n*Tried starting up in safe mode\n\n*Tried deselecting all the boxes in the advanced tab of the software update preferences\n\n*Tried launching it from terminal (don't know why I thought that would work)\n\n*Ran\n\n*disk first aid\n\n*Created a new user account and I could see all the tabs in that account.\nBecause the test user was vanilla, I am guessing there is something booting up in the primary account that is causing a conflict. Primary account is an admin and test account is a standard user without admin privileges.\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem. I can only see updates in Mojave App Store, but if I open the App Store, \nthen follow this with opening the app store from the Apple Logo menu top left, I can also open the old High Sierra App Store which has all the apps .....  It also seems to revert my location back to where I bought the iMac a couple of years ago ...\n", "Q: Backing up my Mac I have a mac book pro.  the hard drive has been partitioned so that i can run both mac and pc applications.  can i use time machine to back up my entire computer - including the pc side?\n\nA: In a word no.\nTime machine will only back up the macOS part of the computer. \nThere are utilities built into macOS that will allow you to capture an entire disk but require the use of the Terminal (like dd). There are also third party utilities (example: winclone) that will back up the Windows partition while in macOS.\nIf you don't mind booting into Windows it has an automatic backup utility that will work over a network mounted drive.\nBut Time Machine just won't do it, you will have to seek other backup avenues.\n", "Q: Can't hibernate computer MacOS Mojave, no pmset \"standby\" option I have a Mid-2009 Macbook Pro 17 inch (5,2), with MacOS Mojave 10.14 installed. I want to enable hibernation (or standby, or deep sleep, or safe sleep) in order to power off the RAM when in sleep mode.\nI have tried\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25\n\nbut my computer still wakes up instantly from sleep, meaning it's not hibernating to disk.\nI have read here that the options autopoweroff and standby are relevant, but pmset -g does not show those options for my computer:\nSystem-wide power settings:\nCurrently in use:\n womp                 1\n autorestart          0\n halfdim              1\n sms                  1\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n gpuswitch            2\n networkoversleep     0\n disksleep            1\n sleep                0\n hibernatemode        25\n ttyskeepawake        0\n displaysleep         1\n acwake               0\n lidwake              0\n\nman pmset says,\n\nstandby causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a machine after it\nhas slept for a specified time period. This saves power while asleep.  This setting\ndefaults to ON for supported hardware. The setting standby will be visible in pmset\n-g if the feature is supported on this machine.\n\n\nand\n\nautopoweroff is enabled by default on supported platforms as an implementation of Lot\n 6 to the European Energy-related Products Directive. After sleeping for\n <autopoweroffdelay> seconds, the system will write a hibernation image and go into a\n lower power chipset sleep. Wakeups from this state will take longer than wakeups from\n regular sleep.\n\n\nIt seems then that standby is not supported on my model, so should be irrelevant. Also, autopoweroff only applies to when AC is attached, but I can't hibernate when on battery either.\nWhy is my laptop unable to hibernate?

What I've tried with regard to this:\n1 ) deleting /var/vm/sleepimage, restarting, sleeping. The OS recreates it at the same size.\n2 ) running mkfile 9G biggersleepimage, placing it at /var/vm/biggersleepimage, running chown root:wheel and chmod +t biggersleepimage, then running pmset hibernatefile /var/vm/biggersleepimage. In this case, the file gets resized to 4294967296 bytes after the last command!\n3 ) rifling through logs and reading man pmset and googling a bunch.\nI happened to have my old RAM cartridges hanging around, so I popped those in to see if that would fix it, but it still won't hibernate. (I didn't try resetting NVRAM and SMC with the old RAM in though)\nEDIT 2 (progress?):\nI moved the sleepimage to my secondary disk and it hibernated! but then it wasn't able to wake up. I have two disks in this computer: a SSD connected to where the DVD drive used to be (This is my system disk) and an HDD where the original system disk used to be. Using mkfile 4G /Volumes/Data/sleepimage; pmset hibernatefile /Volumes/Data/sleepimage then hitting sleep got my computer to hibernate! but then when trying to resume, it hung on a grey screen until I gave up and turned it off and on - it then bootlooped once and started up from scratch.\nEDIT 3:\nAmazing! I swapped the locations of my SSD and HDD and moved the hibernateimage back to the SSD and put the old RAM in and now it successfully hibernates and resumes! gonna try now with the new RAM\nEDIT 4:\nWith 8GB of RAM and 5GB used before I tell my computer to sleep, and ls -l /var/vm/sleepimage still shows 4294967296 bytes, I can successfully hibernate and resume! It seems the problem was that my system drive was in the wrong bay.\n\nA: In my case, I had added a SSD to my machine, which I put in the old DVD SATA slot. This is my main system disk, with an HDD in the original hard drive slot for additional storage. It seems that macos can only resume from a harddrive in the original SATA slot. Swapping the two drives fixes the problem for me!\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to show Tags... dialog In the Finder, you can select a file and choose Tags... from the File menu or contextual menu. It will show a little dialog that allows you to select or type tag names, and you can press Enter to apply them to the selected file.\n\nBefore Mac OS Mojave, I was able to assign a keyboard shortcut to this menu item (using a method like this, although I'm using Keyboard Maestro).\nBut with Mojave, Tags... is no longer a standard menu item, so it can't be accessed this way. Using an ellipsis character instead of three periods doesn't help. Is there a way to do this now? I tried scripting System Events, but couldn't get it working.\n\nA: This no longer seems possible with Mac OS 10.14. My workaround has been to use Keyboard Maestro, with the following macro:\nFor Each Item in the Collection Execute Actions\n    For Each FilePath in the Finder selection\nExecute the Following Actions:\n    Get Tags to Variable ‘Tags’\n    From file: %Variable%FilePath%\n\nPrompt for User Input ‘Tags’\n    Prompt: Enter tag to toggle\nInput the following variables:\n    Tags (default to ‘%Variable%Tags%’)\nFinish with the following buttons:\n    OK\n    Cancel (cancel macro)\n\nFor Each Item in the Collection Execute Actions\n    For Each FilePath in the Finder selection\nExecute the Following Actions:\n    Set Tags to ‘%Variable%Tags%’\n    File: %Variable%FilePath%\n\nIf you select some Finder items and run this macro, it will prompt you to enter tags. You can enter multiple tags separated by commas. Pressing OK will apply those tags to the selected items. The prompt will be pre-filled with the tags of the last item in the selection (this part of the macro isn't ideal).\n", "Q: How to disable Mojave’s desktop tinting (with reduce transparency)? Even with “Reduce transparency” enabled, Mojave’s desktop-tinting is quite horribly annoying, in both Light Mode and Dark Mode (regardless of accent color). Switching to a solid red desktop background, for example, results in this ugly appearance of the Dock, notifications, some popups, and the Finder sidebar:\n\n\n\n\n\nAn earlier answer claims that using Light Mode or using the Graphite accent disables desktop-tinting, but that’s untrue.\nIs it possible to disable desktop-tinting with Reduce Transparency in macOS Mojave?\n\nI reported this as bug #44861849 to Apple, and they closed it as a duplicate of bug #43428401 on 2018-10-19, which is open as of this writing. However, I encourage others to create bugs, as it may increase the priority if more users report.\nThis is still an issue with macOS 10.14.1.\n\nA: Set your Desktop background color to pure white:\n\nSystem Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver > Desktop > Colors > Custom Color… > Color Palettes > White (double click)\n\nEven in the “Reduce Transparency” mode, Mojave calculates background colors off the desktop wallpaper, so having white there ensures light backgrounds. The contrast with text is much better.\nAlso, the setting “Increase contrast” in Accessibility > Display gives the best contrast, but it adds black edges to UI elements.\n\nA: At the moment, the best option seems to be not reducing transparency and living with the blurred background. At least then, you get a tint of what's behind the app, instead of the sometimes-completely-unrelated desktop wallpaper.\nAnother slightly ugly option would be to use a solid gray as your desktop background.\n\nA: It's really horrible. It's not really a solution, but I got round it by using 'Yosemite 3' as my desktop picture. The colour you get from that is pretty close to what it used to be.\nReally hope they add an option for this soon like they did for the translucent menu bar.\n\nA: In Mac OS 12 you can remove the tinting very simple by unchecking\n“Allow wallpaper tinting in windows”\n\n\nA: Try using the 'Reduce Transparency' option under Accessibility:\n\nSystem Preferences - Accessibility - Display - Reduce Transparency\n\n", "Q: Why an IPhone XS Max appears here?

There's a few things I would try to get to the bottom of this.\nThe first things I'd try are to reset both the NVRAM and SMC in that order. Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and make sure you use the built-in keyboard.\nReset the NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset the NVRAM on your particular MBP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nOnce completed, proceed to resetting the SMC (see below).\nReset the SMC\nTo reset the SMC on your particular MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button and keep all these pressed down for at least 10 seconds.\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your computer to determine if it still doesn't wake up after sleeping for several hours.\nIf the problem persists, then try booting into Safe Mode to test again (see below).\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to test your Mac in Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. use it normally and then let it go to sleep for several hours and test to see if it wakes up okay)\n\n*If it works okay, exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal. If not, force start your Mac again.\n\n\nIf your MBP still doesn't wake from sleep properly, then it's time to test your hardware with Apple Diagnostics.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.\n\nA: So I've tried everything and I Mean everything.

Turn off iCloud Drive on device.\n\nA: There is a known issue with the Macbook Pro Mid 2015 waking from sleep. There isn't a single solution, but there is an Apple article about it. The short version is to disable power nap on the \"On Battery\" and \"Plugged in\" power save settings in System Preferences. \n\nA: I started experiencing this issue (on MacBook Air 13-inch, Mid 2013) after upgrading the SSD (OWC Aura pro). It turns out it was only happening when waking from deep sleep/hibernation, and only when it hibernated on battery. Weird eh?\nWelcome to the apple/unix command line utility pmset, complete with its own man page. I used pmset to turn off disksleep when on battery (AC profile does not even use it). To turn off disksleep, you must also turn off sleep.\nThis is not stopping the Mac \"black screen of death\" so far but it seems to the right track.\nI would guess the aftermarket SSD is crashing when it gets the powerdown` signal normally associated with hard disks, because it is slightly different than the apple SSD.\ncommands: \nsudo pmset -b sleep 0\nsudo pmset -b disksleep 0\n\nOne thing I will be watching for is this getting reset by changing the energy preferences in Control Panel.\n\nA: what worked for me was recreating the sleep image.\nsudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage\nI think an error in sleepimage maybe was preventing wake and shutting the laptop.\nAlso I created a new user and deleted the old user.\nTill now it's working fine.\nPrev shutdown logs used to show a \"-2\" code and I can't seem to find description of it anywhere on official apple site.\n\nA: What works for me is pressing Ctrl+Option+delete until the cursor starts blinking again on the sign-in page.\n", "Q: Mac OS X - network interface preference defined by host domain There are two network interfaces on my Macbook: an ethernet LAN and Wi-Fi, which are both DHCP-configured (albeit separately).\nI only need to access a limited number of hosts through my Ethernet network, and want every other request to be routed through Wi-Fi. Those 'Ethernet' hosts can mostly be recognised by their domain mask which is *.foobar.com, but there are also a few exception which domain is different (but they can be identified by their exact IPs).\nWhat would be the best way for me to organise it? I am thinking giving my Wi-Fi the top priority (by dragging it to the top in 'System Settings / Network' list), and then creating a routing rule like this:\nroute add -host 192.168.10.13 -interface en0\nIs that a right approach? If so, what is the equivalent command that I can use to define en0 as a default route by domain mask (*.foobar.com) rather than by exact IP?\n\nA: As has been pointed out in the comments, using DNS names for traffic distribution isn't possible (in your scenario). You need to provide local routing as desired and this needs to use IP addresses or subnets.\nWhat you can do is set up the default gateway on the wi-fi NIC or lower the metric for wi-fi - if you want to stick to the all-DHCP setup you'll need to change this on the DHCP server. This takes care of using wi-fi as default network connection.\nThen, you set up specific, local routes for the \"Ethernet services'\" IP addresses that have lower metrics for the Ethernet NIC with route add.\n", "Q: Cannot leave iOS 12 beta testing program on iPad I installed the iOS 12 Beta Software Profile on my 9.7 iPad 2017 a few months ago.

It also causes one-liner paragraphs to be indented, which looks quite awkward.\nIs there a way to prevent Pages from indenting the first paragraph in any sequence of paragraphs, without having to manually remove the indentation from each first paragraph?\n\nA: This is an important question for anyone concerned with proper typesetting.\nThe solution is to click on your first body paragraph, create a new paragraph style (by pressing the 'plus' symbol at the drop-down style selector). Give it a unique name (such as 'Body - First Paragraph'). Under the 'Layout' tab, set the 'First' indent to 0. Under the 'More' tab, set the 'Following Paragraph Style' to 'Body'.\nYou can repeat the same process of setting the 'Following Paragraph Style' to 'Body - First Paragraph' for each of your heading level styles, if you do not want to change the style of the first paragraph manually.\n", "Q: Can I save an hard copy version of my iCloud Photo Library on iPhone?

I'm porting over a C++/Qt application from Windows. On Windows, the program runs as a service. It's discouraged from programs running as a service to also interact with the user and display GUI elements.\nTherefore, my program has two parts. The first part runs as a service daemon and plays audio in the background. The program starts up when the computer starts up. The second program, which starts up when any user logs in (Via Start Menu->All Users->Startup), communicates via local socket with the service daemon to display a GUI pop-up when the audio is playing.\nMoving over to MacOS, what is the best practice to utilize the same program?\nShould I merge both programs into one and run it as root via launchd and have the one daemon display GUI as well as play audio?\nOr should I rather keep it as two programs like it is now - root daemon playing audio and find a way that the second program can automatically execute when each user logs in?\n\nA: On macOS, you should avoid running any process as root. Apple would likely suggest keeping this type of application in two parts. Each part should be sandboxed with appropriate entitlements.\nYour background computer wide process will not be able to access the graphical interface. You will need a second process running within the user's session to provide an interface to the user.\nUse launchd to launch your computer wide process on-demand; see XPC services below. This way, while nothing is playing, you avoid consuming any resources.\nXPC Services\nFor macOS, Apple want you to communicate using the XPC services architecture. This approach uses Mach ports at the low level, but your processes do not need to be too concerned about that detail.\n", "Q: Is there a way to reset iCloud drive? My iCloud sync is totally broken.

Also my Apple Books are not syncing too. Probably other things are broken. Only thing that syncs is Photos. Can I somehow reset the iCloud drive entirely and start from scratch? Btw, I tried every possible proposed solution on the net for the sync problem to no avail.\n\nA: There is not a specific feature of iCloud drive that says \"Reset all settings.\" however paying attention to the warnings when you sign out or turn off iCloud drive will reveal the trick.\nSo what you need to do is (FIRST!) make sure anything on iCloud drive you have copies of somewhere. Then you will need to turn off iCloud drive on all devices you are signed into iCloud in.\nOn every device you turn off iCloud drive on you should get a warning about removing files (it's been a while so I don't recall the exact wording). Tell iCloud drive to delete the files. \nOnce you do that on all your devices iCloud drive should be empty. Personally I'd wait a day before turning it back on but, realistically, that is not likely to matter. Just turn it back on, add your files and watch them sync.\nNow if it STILL fails, I would call Apple support and tell them what you have done, why and ask them to fix it for you.\n", "Q: Macbook charging with USB-C Monitor I have a Macbook pro 13'' 2018 model and a Dell 24 USB-C Monitor: P2419HC.

If I add the network users individually they are able to read/write again. Any ideas?\n\nA: From https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3288643\n\n\"So here is what I did wrong. I changed the default group that was already set for the share point. It is however IMPORTANT to ADD a new group or user if you want to keep the inheritance. As far as I know the default permissions are only responsible for posix and not for ACL. Be sure to add this new group on top of the others and then propagate the permissions.\"\n\nThere are two things in play here, POSIX style permissions (*nix based) and NFSv4 ACLs (Access Control Lists) used on your server.\nYou set them to AFP after ongoing issues using SMB.  Things seem to get hairy when using AFP and Apple changed up SMB a lot after breaking ties with SAMBA and implementing their own, albeit lesser version of SMB (you Mac geeks out there, correct me if I'm wrong - I want to know...)\nFrom an article on TechRepublic I found this great explanation:\n\nMost UNIX systems use the standard POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) permissions when managing access to files. Standard POSIX permissions are independent of which file system they are used on (provided the system supports them), and anyone familiar with Linux or UNIX will be familiar with them as they are the standard way to set very basic access control on files and directories.\nEssentially, you can define the owner of a file or directory, the group that owns it, and \"other\" (everyone who is not the owning user or a member of the owning group). You can further define whether or not each of these has read, write, or execute permission to the file or directory. With a file, these permissions mean that the user can read the file, write to it, change or delete it, or execute it as a program. For directories, these permissions mean that the user can read the contents of a directory (but not necessarily the contents of the files in the directory), can write to the directory (create and delete files), or execute (allows the user to traverse that directory tree in order to access files or subdirectories, although it does not on its own allow permission to see the contents of the directory).\nMost operating systems also support some form of Access Control Lists (or ACLs). Often times this is also dependent upon which filesystem is in use, or which implementation can be used on which file system (the two primary ACL types are POSIX.1e ACLs and NFSv4 ACLs). Mac OS X is no different and, as of OS X 10.4, it has supported NFSv4 ACLs when used with the HFS+ file system. Using these ACLs on OS X are quite simple; you may even be using them without knowing it.\nACLs are made up of ACEs (Access Control Entries) and each ACL can contain more than one ACE. ACLs provide a lot more flexibility and fine-grained control over permissions of files and directories than standard POSIX permissions. For instance, some of the capabilities that ACLs provide for files include read, write, execute, and append permissions (append only allows you to add to an existing file, not change existing contents or remove it). Some capabilities for directories include listing entries, searching entries, adding a file, adding a sub-directory, or deleting contents. Another nice feature of ACLs is called \"inheritance,\" where you can set an inheritance permission so that a directory's file contents can inherit one set of ACLs, while directories inherit another set.\nAs you can see, ACLs are very powerful. For instance, if you had a directory that contained developer manuals, you might make the directory writable to developers and read-only to sales people. You might also want to give interns access to some of the files, but you don't want to make them a part of the developer or sales group because those two groups have access to too many other files. In this scenario, you might make the directory owned by one particular user, or the root (administrator) user, and group-owned by the \"developers\" group, with the files and directories writable by both the owner and group. You would then use ACLs to apply read-only permissions to certain files for the \"sales\" group, and could also use ACLs to apply read-only access to the explicit users that are interns (as opposed to creating a new group for interns). With standard POSIX permissions, this would not be easily possible.\nIf you have used the Finder Get Info command on a file or directory, most likely you have noticed the Sharing & Permissions pane at the bottom. By default, it shows the standard POSIX permissions entries:\nThese permissions, on the command line, would equate to an ownership of \"vdanen:staff\" and mode 0750 (or 0640 if this were a file). This can be seen on the command line as:\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 vdanen  staff     68 Mar 11 22:30 New\nTo add ACLs to this directory, you can either use the chown and chmod commands, or the Finder. Using chown/chmod gives a lot more flexibility as the Finder limits you quite a bit and makes certain assumptions for you. For instance, to give access to this directory to members of the admin group as Read Only, you would click the + button in the Sharing & Permissions pane, select the user or group, and then set the appropriate privilege:\nNow the members of the admin group have read-only access to this folder. Not very difficult to set in the Finder, is it? We can also observe the ACLs on the command line, using the -le switch to the ls command:\n% /bin/ls -le\n  total 288\n  drwxr-xr-x+ 2 vdanen  staff     68 Mar 11 22:30 New\n   0: group:admin allow list,search,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\nThe Finder gave more permissions than just the \"list\" or \"search\" permissions; it also allows the admin group to read extended attributes and ACLs.\nTo accomplish the same on the command line, you would use:\n% mkdir New2\n  % /bin/chmod +a \"admin allow read,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\" New2\n  % /bin/ls -le\n  total 288\n  drwxr-xr-x+ 2 vdanen  staff     68 Mar 11 23:06 New2\n   0: group:admin allow list,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\n  % /bin/chmod +a \"admin allow search\" New2\n  % /bin/ls -le\n  total 288\n  drwxr-xr-x+ 2 vdanen  staff     68 Mar 11 23:06 New2\n   0: group:admin allow list,search,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity\nAs you can see, the initial chmod command missed an ACL; it's easy enough to add a new entry later. And if you need to remove one, that is easy too:\n% /bin/chmod -a \"admin allow search\" New2\nThe admin group now no longer has search permissions on this directory. You’ll note that in each case, I am specifying an explicit path to the ls and chmod commands. This is because I have Fink installed, and the GNU tools that are installed through Fink do not understand OS X ACLs, and these commands will not work with them (the default PATH on the system puts /sw/bin before /bin/, so when I type \"ls\", it is \"/sw/bin/ls\" that is being executed, rather than \"/bin/ls\").\nMac OS X Server (and, presumably, Lion as well) has a more sophisticated GUI front-end to manipulating ACLs than the Finder, but for most basic tasks, the Finder will suffice. It does not handle inheritance, however, which is a shame. It does allow you to apply the permissions set on a directory to files and directories within it by using the \"Apply to enclosed items...\" menu entry from the gear pull-down menu, which arguably accomplishes something similar; however, if you change the directory permissions you need to re-apply them, and also if you added new folders or files, etc.\nThe chmod manpage (”man chmod”) gives a very good explanation of ACLs and how to apply them. ACEs in an ACL do observe order, so you can use chown to specify where a specific ACE needs to be positioned within the ACL, and of course you can get a lot more specific than you could with the Finder.\nACLs on OS X work very similarly to ACLs on other POSIX systems, including Linux. The permissions may differ somewhat, as does the mechanism for implementing and managing them, but the benefits are identical. This ACL support in OS X is also compatible with certain versions of Windows and Windows Server.\n\nAnd if that isn't enough, here is some really good in-depth information on sharing, including sharing and viewing the shares from Terminal.\n\nA: Short Version - for Mojave Use TinkerTool System 6 (Not to be confused with TinkerTool) https://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerToolSys6.html\nLong Version:\nI was having a similar problem after upgrading from a Mac Mini Server 5,3 running El Capitan running Server 5.1 to a new mac mini server running Mojave and Server 5.8. I couldn't find a good migration path, so I set up all the users and groups again. Permissions were a mess, with long lists of \"Fetching\" showing up in the Get Info boxes on files and folders, and trouble with users access to files and folders.\nAfter struggling for days, I ditched Server 5.8, and set up Users (Users as Sharing Only) and Groups in the built-in utility (System Preferences:Users and Groups). Then I enabled File Sharing (System Preferences:Sharing:File Sharing checkbox) and assigned Groups to the folders I needed those groups to be able to access. One would think that would resolve the permission problems, but it didn't. Neither did resetting permissions in the Get Info box and applying permissions to all enclosed items. Inheritance was still an issue, and permissions were changing automatically. I was finally able to reset all permissions AND INHERITANCE using TinkerTool System in less than an hour. It would have been possible using command-line, but not nearly as easy, and TinkerTool System is only $14.\n2 other tips I picked up. \n\n\n*\n\n*Don't assign \"No Access\" to the group \"Everyone\" as this will (or can) supersede other Group permissions. Strangely, assigning \"Read Only\" to \"Everyone\" does not supersede other Group permissions.\n\n*Although I didn't have this problem, it was what Apple support suspected, and side-tracked them for a long time. Keep folders you want to share with a group in the root directory of the drive, and don't nest folders with different group access inside of each other.\n", "Q: How far is my Time Machine \"preparing backup\" step? I want to do a Time Machine backup and it's not the first time I do it in this external hard drive, so Time Machine is doing the \"preparing backup\" step since a few minutes. As it's been quite long I haven't back up, I know this step will take a while.\nHowever I have no idea how far is this step, is it 5% ? or is it nearly done and 95% ?\n\nHow to know how long remaining ?\n\n\nA: If the CPU goes over the roof, as shown by Apple Activity Monitor (mds–stores) or MenuMeters (see below), Time Machine \"Preparing backup…\" takes forever when it should be done in seconds or similar, and Apple Mail and Finder Spotlight (File - Find) find nothing, chances are that Time Machine is checking the Spotlight FSEvents database to see what has changed since the last backup, and that that such database is corrupted or there is some other problem. The fix is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop Time Machine backup clicking the \"X\" on the screen capture above.\n\n*Reboot the Mac.\n\n*If required, stop again Time Machine (if it takes forever again) and once stopped, select \"Time Machine - Back Up Npw\".\n\n\nIn my case, that worked like a charm on macOS 10.12.6 (16G2136) Sierra using internal booting SSD 2TB from Apple (Samsung) on iMac 27-inch 5K Retine (mid 2017) and external Time machine Samsung Portable SSD T5 2 TB. Time Machine takes about 15 seconds to perform each backup there!\n\n\n*If not fixed and Time Machine takes forever again, rebuild Spotlight index selecting \"Apple - System Preferences - Spotlight - Privacy\". Then drag and drop the full booting disk (or the one that is backed up) there. Then remove it to allow Spotlight to rebuild its index. Note that it may take from a few minutes to many hours, depending on the items stored in the disk and the disk speed (SSD is much faster than the mechanical rotational ones). You may want to do it overnight.\n\n\nFinally, it is a good idea to install MenuMeters to easily see when the CPU goes over the roof…\nMenuMeters for OS X El Capitan 10.11 (and later)\nhttps://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/MenuMetersElCapitan\n", "Q: How to securely `shred` a file in Mojave/APFS? I just came across this thread about securely deleting files:\n\nIf, by stroke of misfortune, you're on a magnetic medium, have\n  journalling disabled and, for some reason, can't encrypt the disk,\n  you're options are:\n* Use rm -P which overwrites files with 0xff, then 0x00, and then 0xff again\n\n\nAnd this contradictory superuser thread. Apparently it's not easy to securely delete files using Apple's older HFS+/Journaled file system.\nWithout the use of third-party software, is it possible to natively wipe a file in macOS Mojave (or High Sierra) that's using APFS and FileVault encryption? \nI understand macOS makes it difficult with all of its journaling and backup functionalities. But I'm looking for a shred or srm type of solution that's built into macOS already.\n\nA: The answer Apple implies:\nYou don't have to worry about that, since each file's data is not stored contiguously in the drive, but spread out across several physical and logical blocks. Removing a file from the file table makes it nearly impossible to read with forensic software/hardware.\nSources: About Apple File System | Apple File System Reference\nThe answer that may or may not work:\nbrew install coreutils\nshred Secrets.txt\n\nThe documentation for shred doesn't explicitly call out APFS, but from what it says, it might be the case that the data is not necessarily overwritten.\nIf you wish to engage in determining this, there are contacts and other related links here: http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/\n", "Q: How do I restore the behavior of the fn key after Mojave update? I updated to Mojave yesterday and my fn key seems to have changed behavior.  Previously, I could hold fn and press delete to foward delete.  Now, if I press the fn key, it has different behaviors.\nIn spotlight, it clears my search.  In chromes URL window, it highlights the URL.  In vim, I'm not really sure what it's doing but it exits insert mode as a result.  I miss my fn key. :(\n\nA: Soooo . . . I've done this to myself.

The lock button stopped working and it is spontaneously \"clicked\" (software-wise) randomly. Sometimes I even get the turn-off screen that is usually displayed after a long lock-click, expect I don't press anything.\nI've tried to do a force-reboot (holding the lock and home buttons for a few seconds), the iPhone get turned off, but then immediately it gets into a loop, and the only way to get it to load is to connect it to a power source. This happens also after I simply turn it off (using the accessibility software solution).\nI now back-upped the phone to my iTunes, and deleted all of the data so it'll be new-like but this did not help the problem. All of the above symptoms are still happening.\nAny ideas on what else I could do?\n\nA: I don't think this is related to plugging into the rental car.  \nI also have (had) an iPhone SE and it experienced the exact same problems.  I took it in and was told the sleep/wake button on top was bad.  The repair place told me they don't bother repairing these models anymore because the parts are very hard to find; this model has a bad problem with this type of button failure.  If you google it you'll see. \nI ended-up going to Best Buy and they recycled it for free.  I think you're out of luck unless you can find a place to repair it.\n\nA: I just got back from a repair shop and they just solved the problem. I'm not sure exactly what it was - but now it solved. I still think it was a software issue since they thought that the button must be replaced at first, but eventually they didn't replace it. \nThe only think that's annoying at this point is that I thought that erasing the iPhone would help (since I read it online in a few blogs). It didn't help, and now I cannot install some of my apps because they are unavailable for iOS 9 anymore. So my advice: in this kind of case - first go to a repair shop.\n", "Q: Spotlight re-indexing takes too long or doesn't work Issue\nAfter forcing Spotlight to reindex, no files or directories can be found.\nSetup\nI've got a MacBook Pro 15\" 2017 with a 512 GB SSD: 250 GB main volume (36 free) and a BOOTCAMP partition (not indexed), running macOS High Sierra (10.13.6). The file system is APFS.\nHow it happened\nI wanted to force a Spotlight re-indexing (because a file, that was definitely in place, was missing in Search), so I added the whole volume to System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy, and then removed it from there (Apple Support link), which should've caused a full Spotlight reindex. It did. a bunch of mdworker processes appeared and started consuming CPU time and reading stuff from disk (which is expected).\nThen they stopped. They are still there but they don't seem to be doing anything judging by the CPU load / disk usage stats.\nAnd yet, now I can't find ANY files. Spotlight doesn't output any files / directories at all. It only outputs other stuff like visited emails, Dictionary suggestions, etc. Search (in Finder) doesn't work either.\nWhat I tried:\n\n*\n\n*Waiting for ~12 hours. I can't believe indexing ~220 Gb of content on a 3Gb/s SSD takes so long. Especially considering the zero CPU load.\n\n\n*Rebooting the mac (didn't help) and repeating the whole sequence again, waiting a few seconds before removing the disk from \"Privacy\" and waiting for quite a long time again.\n\n\n*running sudo mdutil -E / with the same effect as before (high CPU load -> no CPU load -> nothing is indexed).\nBy the way, running mdutil -s / returns Indexing enabled.\nThere's no \"Indexing\" bar in my Spotlight window, if that's important.\nQuestions\nIs there anything else I could try other than waiting for the problem to solve itself or updating to Mojave? Maybe there are more verbose Spotlight logs somewhere or something?\nPossibly related question (no answer): Spotlight borked after macOS Sierra update (AskDifferent).\n\nA: OK, I solved it, it seems... \nThe Solution\nRun \nsudo /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -seed -lint -r -f -v -dump -domain local -domain system -domain user -domain network\n\nkillall Dock\n\nsudo mdutil -E /\n\nNot sure if all of these are needed, but that's what worked for me.

To be more precise, it seemed to have fixed search, but not spotlight.\nI also tried sudo rm -R .Spotlight-V100/ suggested in the comments to the question, but it didn't help either.\nDetails\nthe issue was in the Launch Services Database. I figured it out by looking at the Console app. There were tons of messages like \nerrore  16:19:03.743202 +0100   mds LaunchServices: store or url (null) was nil -10813, retrying\nerrore  16:19:03.743247 +0100   mds LaunchServices: Database mapping failed with result -10813, retries = 7\n\nI found this thread, which led me to trying to reset the Launch Services Database.

Screen sharing through macOS Messages is far too laggy to be efficient. I've been searching and reading about macOS's native remote file sharing options (File Sharing, Remote Login, Remote Management, Apple Remote Desktop, etc), but I can't for the life of me figure it all out or quite understand how it all works.\nIs it possible to set up his computer so that I can remotely log into it from my own computer over the internet, through Finder, and organize his files for him, using a native macOS feature/protocol?\nWe are both running the latest version of High Sierra and running MacBook Pros.\nEDIT: Well I've determined that the answer is no, there is no way to access my friend's files over the internet using a mounted disk in Finder, as you might over a local Wi-Fi network. The alternative is some deep Terminal usage and router set-up, which is a bit more than I can devote my time to, but I've marked it as the solution, as it does answer my question.\n\nA: I would highly recommend the Team Viewer app.\nHave been using it for years now to help some people over in Europe.\nhttps://www.teamviewer.us/\nIt is free for personal uses...\nOf course both sides have to install it\n\n\nA: Using ssh in Terminal would be my preferred way to achieve this but your friend will likely need to setup a rule on their firewall/router to let you make inbound ssh connections to their Mac.\nOnce you're in it's the same as being in a Terminal locally on their Mac so you have full control over their filesystem (assuming you login with their credentials).  Your friend could create another account for you to login with but you'll need Administrative rights on that account to use sudo to manipulate files in their home directory.\nIPV4 with NAT will require a port 22 forward on their router to the internal IP address of their Mac.  If IPv6 is available to you both then it will likely just need a hole poked in your friends firewall/router to allow return traffic to your own IP.  If your friend's Mac is not in a fixed network location and is moving around and changing networks then this method won't work.\nIf you're new to this I would suggest trying this out on the same network first before you try doing it over the internet and have their firewall/router in the way.\nTo enable ssh login on your friends Mac go to System Preferences -> Sharing and enable Remote Login.\nTo ssh to your friends laptop in a Terminal you'll want something like:\nssh username@ipaddress\nin a Terminal on your machine where username is their 'shortname' on their Mac and ipaddress is their public IP.  Typing\nid\ninto a Terminal on their Mac is a quick and easy way to determine their 'shortname'.  It's the name in brackets after the uid.\nThe password required will be the same as their normal desktop login password.\nOnce you're logged in via ssh you have access to all the tools you would be able to use in Terminal on their local machine (like cp, mv, rm etc).\nIf you use this method and get things working and you want to leave Remote Login on all the time you should consider generating and using ssh keys and disable ssh password based logins altogether.  Open ssh ports tend to attract lots of attention.\nIdeally you should also make the firewall rules on their firewall/router specific to your public IP, though that can be a pain if your public IP is assigned dynamically by your ISP or you move network locations a lot.\n", "Q: How do I remove websites from the Limit Adult Websites > Always Allow list in iOS 12 I have added a website to the 'Always Allow' list in iOS 12 restrictions, but there doesn't seem to be any way to remove it from the list once it has been added.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: In iOS 12, you can remove an added website from the \"Always Allow\" list by swiping left to delete.\nIn the image below, I created an entry for \"StackExchange.\"  I then swiped left which brought up the delete button.\n\n\nA: Apple recommended this answer:\n\nFrom Safari: When you try to access a website and it gets blocked, tap \"Allow Access\" and then the restrictions passcode.From Settings: Go to Settings > General > Restrictions > Enter the passcode.

Anyone ever seen this? I've been digging into Darwin source to try to find some way to create virtual Ethernet interfaces on Mac/Darwin without adding a kernel extension like tuntaposx. In doing so I've found something interesting that seems to exist but have zero documentation.\nHere's the source file:\nhttps://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-4570.41.2/bsd/net/if_fake.c.auto.html\nReading the file leads me to think this is similar to a veth pair on Linux: create two interfaces and packets going into one pop out the other.\nThe only problem is that I can find nothing on the Internet about this.\nI have been able to confirm that it exists as of OSX Mojave and assume they exist on older versions too:\n# ifconfig feth0 create\nfeth0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n  ether 66:65:74:68:00:00\n  peer: <none>\n  media: autoselect\n  status: inactive\n\nAfter looking some more I seem to have found an undocumented option in ifconfig to link two of these:\n# ifconfig feth0 peer feth1\n# ifconfig feth0\nfeth0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n  ether 66:65:74:68:00:00\n  inet 9.9.9.9 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 9.9.9.255\n  peer: feth1\n  media: autoselect\n  status: active\n\nNow when I add an IP to feth0 and tcpdump feth1, I see a bunch of packets that are things like mDNS announcements that you would expect a Mac to spew into a new Ethernet link.\nI'm posting this here because I'm curious about whether anyone else has any clue about this or has ever used it.\nEdit: I can now confirm that if you peer them and bring them both up (ifconfig feth0 up, etc.) you can inject packets into either side and see them in the other. It looks like this indeed could work as a layer 2 Ethernet tap device or virtual machine veth pair device without requiring a kernel extension. Not only is this awesome for network virtualization but paired with Apple's virtualization extensions it would also allow a kext-free VM host with full networking capabilities.\nEdit #2: We also just found this, which is also not very well documented albeit much better than feth. It may offer a more officially supported way of creating virtual Ethernet devices. We'll have to see how it works. The feth stuff is still interesting though!\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/vmnet\n\nA: Yes you can create new interfaces and link them however you would like for whatever your heart desires : ) You can utilize this feature for all different things like isolating certain traffic. For ex:  forcing all traffic through a VPN except for some criteria. My router sends all traffic through a VPN which is a separate LAN from my STB/Cable Box. I want to use my mobile device to change the channel but it won’t work if I’m in a VPN, a separate interface can ether tunnel traffic from my device or isolate traffic directed to the mobile app I’m using and route it around the VPN. \nAs for reference and documentation, Unix utilizes man pages like Linux too for basic and core reference. I like to use cheat.sh for examples, it’s formatted very nicely too when you make a query within your terminal.

I'm brand new at this so apologies if I'm missing something basic.\nLike many photographers I come back from a shoot with a card containing RAW (CR2), JPG, and MOV files all in a single folder. Once I copy this folder to my hard drive, I have to do the following actions, for which I would like to create a single service, so that I can run this same process for any folder I choose.\nSo here's what I'd like to automate:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create separate folders for Raw, JPG, and Video within selected folder. \n\n*Identify files of each type and move them into the folders created in the first step.\n\n\nI thought this would be simple, but the problem seems to lie in my need for this to be a generic service, not tied to any specific folder path. I need it to be repeatable for other folders, but I can't seem to figure out that essential versatility aspect. \nI've already found and adapted an Apple Script (see below) which creates the subfolders I need. That part works fine as a service on its own. But I can't seem to perform the second step which would do the actual file-moving.\nI know how to move files of a certain type to a specific folder but that's not what I need. I need all the JPGs in a certain folder to be moved to a new subfolder called JPG within the selected folder and likewise for the other file types. I understand how to filter those file types, but so far I can't figure out how to move them to a folder without having to specify a path, I don't know how to point to folders that don't yet exist. Even if I could, those paths will be different for each folder I need to work on.\nCan any one give advice or point me to a relevant discussion?\nMany, many thanks.\n///\nHere's the Apple Script for my subfolder creation service:\n\nScript text:\non run {input, parameters}\n    set output to {}\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set {source_folder, source_name} to {it, name} of first item of input\n        repeat with prefix in {\"JPG - \", \"RAW - \", \"Edits - \", \"Video - \"}\n            make new folder at source_folder with properties {name:contents of prefix & source_name}\n            set end of output to result as alias\n        end repeat\n\nNote: The file-moving part of the automation won't involve my the \"Edits - \" folder.

So now I have to boot the installation file, to do so the help box of the website says I have to press and hold Option key on system restart.\nDoes this action erase my whole mac hard disk?\n\nA: No, holding option on restart simply lets you boot off a different device. It doesn't erase anything. But having said that, downloading MacOS updates from anywhere except Apple is very risky, and I wouldn't recommend it.

I often look at other logs like system.log but there can be thousands of entries so if you are looking at all the machine logs for the first time, it might be painful to search for or see the item that's relevant.\nIf you're game, these are the sorts of files and locations you'll move to if your App Store itself is broken and it's not a server side issue with the account or just a bad network where you can't get a reliable download of that large a size.

I now am confronted with 200GB of the 500GB 'lost'. That is, when running OmniDiskSweeper as root, I find 255GB files, but according to df, 460GB is in use. Removing large files (e.g. I removed a 33GB directory with rm) does not increase free space. I've run repair on the volume (system in target disk mode, repair executed from another Mac).\nThe disk was full yesterday (unexepected) and the system died. What pushed it over the edge was CrashPlan crashing and writing 12.5GB cores. I used the string command to try to find where the core dumps came from but string gave errors like \"malformed object LC_SEGMENT_64 fileoff field plus filesize extends past the end of the file\". That sounded like file system corruption to me, hence the attempt to repair.\nI first tried to remove those core dumps to free up data, and that worked to give me 40GB. But I removed more from the disk and I never got that space back. Not even the repair gave me my disk space back. I now have a file system with 210GB space missing.\nI cannot use DiskWarrior as it doesn't handle APFS. So, what can I do?\n\nA: The reasons for this problem were twofold, it has turned out.\n\n\n*\n\n*About half of the missing space was in SIP-protected folders that are not found by programs like du or OmniDiskSweeper, not even when they are run as root. A safe boot fixed that.\n\n*The other half was indeed (see How to thin your local Time Machine Snapshots on macOS High Sierra mentioned in a comment to my question) in time machine local snapshots.\n\n\nThe LC_SEGMENT error may have been a red herring. Checking the APFS system with the machine in TDM attached to another Mac did not notice any problems with the file system.\nTime Machine does provide a risk for boot file systems that are pretty full and that have a volatile content (large size of additions and removals). And these days, you cannot turn local snapshots off anymore.\n", "Q: What's the technical reason some Macs can't use Boot Camp with macOS Mojave? As written on MacRumors and other places Macs using 3TB Fusion Drives for the macOS and Boot Camp installations can't be upgraded to Mojave currently without losing the Boot Camp partition.\n\nTo fix this problem, Apple says that customers with the 2012 27-inch iMac with 3TB hard drive will need to completely remove the Boot Camp partition using Boot Camp Assistant before macOS Mojave can be installed.\nAfter upgrading to macOS Mojave, Boot Camp will not be able to be used to install Windows on these machines. No other iMac models appear to be affected by this issue.\n\nWhat is the technical reason for this?\nPS: See also Apple knowledgebase document (which mentions only Late-2012 27-inch iMacs with 3TB fusion drives.)\n\nA: The technical reason is that the fusion drive is an Apple engineered disk spanning software layer and Apple didn't implement / ship this for fusion drives on top of APFS. Someone has to write the actual code that runs behind that Boot Camp assistant program and the code was written to not start on that specific hardware.\nNow - that decision was probably a business decision. We could speculate that it required tradeoffs or more engineering talent or failed some performance or stability test so they removed that capability technically during the planning of the OS before it was publicly released to beta in June 2018 and shipped in September 2018.\nBoot Camp is three things:\n1) Drivers to make Windows see the Mac hardware as legitimate\n2) Scripts to repartition the drive.\n3) Documentation and articles like the one you references to educate people how to use the software and what to expect.  \nApple could have decided to leave these few Macs without the entirely new APFS and coded other exceptions, but I'm not at all surprised they just said - no bootcamp on some small subset of iMac that didn't ship with SSD as the main storage.\n", "Q: Recovering a RAID 0 volume In the process of upgrading a 2 4tb disk RAID 0 array from an iffy LaCie drive to a faster/more reliable USB enclosure I have lost data. The backups take a long, long time to restore so I'm hoping to be able to rebuild the RAID 0 array instead. This is all on a Mac Mini running High Sierra.\nIt was originally a RAID 0 array in a LaCie Thunderbolt drive, but this kept randomly dropping out so I decided to move the drives into a COTS USB 3 enclosure instead. This was set up as a RAID 1 array with 2 2tb drives and I cloned the LaCie contents onto it as a backup. Then I took the pair of 4tb drives from the LaCie and put them in the USB enclosure and switched it to RAID 0 mode, but the Mac Mini did not recognise them. So then I replaced them in the LaCie enclosure, but they just showed up as 2 different drives which the Mac Mini would not mount. \n I tried switching the order of the drives, but this did not help. I wasn't worried because I still had my pair of 2tb RAID 1 drives, which I put back in the USB enclosure, switched it to RAID 1 mode and...the Mac Mini would not recognise it. Data gone - and I hadn't even done a single write operation or formatted anything.\nI have tried Data Rescue and 321 Soft Raid Recovery to try and recover the LaCie RAID 0 drive, and while I have managed to get a lot of data from the RAID 1 drive, it's just recovered it as a bunch of files with no usable filenames or directory structure.\nMy offsite backups appear to be incomplete, and in any case are taking literally days to restore.\ndistil list output: ...$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            999.3 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk4 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *5.0 TB     disk4\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk4s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS HSBACKUP1               5.0 TB     disk4s2\n\n/dev/disk5 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                                                   *4.0 TB     disk5\n\n/dev/disk6 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                                                   *4.0 TB     disk6\n\n/dev/disk 5 and 6 are the elements of the RAID 0 (ignore HSBACKUP1 - that is my offsite backup drive currently doing a restore of most of the company files)\nMy LaCie enclosure model is a 2big thunderbolt 8tb - comes preconfigured as RAID 0. I didn't install it originally (it was done in 2013) but I assume it was just used with default settings.\nSo - does anyone know how to rebuild a RAID 0 array on a mac? It hasn't been formatted or written to in any way - just put into another enclosure, taken out and put back into the original.\nOUTCOME: Have not succeeded in rebuilding the RAID. Instead between the restores from my offsite backups and £60 for a Data Rescue license, have managed to recover everything that was lost. Lessons learnt: do not use a Mac as a file server, with the best will in the world they're just not built with that in mind, and verify your daily backups to make sure they're backing up everything you need them to, I wouldn't have had any problems at all save that the account doing the backups did not have rights to all the source files.\n\nA: All consumer file recovery software I've seen and evaluated do exactly what you say. They troll each and every block of the drive and make up stories and file names in the presumption that each block was a file that's now deleted.\nSomeone has to spend tons of time pouring over each and every file to make sense of them or start looking for metadata (social security numbers, passwords, ascii strings / hex values) and then report how much progress is made finding needles in the haystack.\nNormally if you send in drives from a JBOD type RAID to a recovery service - they offer free quotes and can speak much more intelligently about your prospects and if this is a $500 recovery or a $5000 recovery effort.\nIn your specific case, if the LaCie drive comes RAID 0 by default, there's nothing on the macOS side that made the decision where to store the data - it's all embedded in the firmware shipped by LaCie so your first stop would be to ask them for technical assistance or documentation to see if you can rebuild how they stored the data.\nYour diskutil list shows clearly that the drives now aren't seen as a RAID so your diagnosis is correct and you'll want to get software that supports LaCie RAID recovery or hopefully find someone that reverse engineered and documents how to do this. I haven't ever seen such a thing and usually pay if the business need is more than just walking away from the data that wasn't backed up in a way it can be restored easily (or at all).\n", "Q: Mojave upgrade complete, but warning that Server is out of date?

I will look more into.\nSo as the others answers says I don't think its possible.\nFor those wondering I copied over the following Frameworks\n\n\n*\n\n*MessakesKit.franework\n\n*PhotoLibrary.framework\n\n*SocialUI.framework\n\n*SocialAppsCore.framework\n\n*Ofc the High Sierra Messages.Application\n\n\nA: I see this has been already answered,  but I'd like to chip in and recommend an alternative messenger: https://adium.im/\nAdium is a free and open source multiprotocol messenger for all operating systems(including Mac OS).\n\nA: Google-Hangouts (aka: GH, aka: classic Hangouts, previously aka: Google-Talk, aka: GT) support was dropped from Mojave & Catalina, so \"Messages\" app cannot use that web-service (aka: network) anymore normally, and a complete solution is not-found yet. (aka=also-known-as)\n\n*\n\n*But user \"JBis\" has shown at-least some partial way to copy specific files, settings, etc from older macOS to Mojave/Catalina. Though its not a fully working solution, hopefully other users can collaborate & improve & find a complete solution.\n\n*at this moment, i would suggest to use an alternative & trustworthy app that can connect with Google-Hangouts/GH/GT network, which is: Thunderbird app, it can connect with Google-Hangouts IM (instant-messaging) network (aka: web-service), or use your own choice of other app. (See detail instruction shown below for more info, if you have time)\n\n*Another option is to use a HyperVisor1 (aka: Virtualization1) app (f.e.: VirtualBox) to run another/second instance of a macOS (f.e.: High-Sierra as a guest macOS), inside a guest virtual Mac computer/machine in the host macOS Mojave/Catalina/BigSur, and use the \"Messages.app\" with GH network support/feature & other apps inside guest macOS, as specific feature necessary for user is missing(aka: not-present) in host macOS. (See detail instruction & goto bottom side for more info, if you have time)\n\n\nEXTRA INFO , PLEASE SKIP READING BELOW , IF YOU DON'T HAVE TIME:\nTHUNDERBIRD:\nApple has removed many other supports from many other Apple apps, and if you were depended on those, then\nThunderbird 1, 2 (TB) is a better alternative choice for some of those missing options.\nTB (since v?) has began to include GPG 1 tool, and from TB v78 (for Windows/Linux/Unix, & different version ? on macOS) it transitioned to use builtin OpenPGP 1, 2, 3, so separate GPG/PGP tool not needed anymore), so user/you can send+receive digitally signed and/or encrypted emails with it, for free.\n\n*\n\n*At this moment in time (Sept-8, 2020):\nsimple & trustworthy, and more uptodate, and more devs supported, and more user supported, etc based\nSOLUTION (for Catalina & Mojave users) is, use THUNDERBIRD.\nTB has builtin1 ability/feat to connect with Google-Talk 1/Google-Hangouts1 text messaging web-service (aka: network). But it supports only basic features: text chat. TB also supports instant messaging and chat using IRC, XMPP, Twitter, (Yahoo-Messenger, Skype, Facebook, etc1), it can also function as News Client, Feed Reader, etc . Uses XULRunner framework . TB is created with C, C++, JavaScript, CSS, Rust, XUL, XBL. License: MPL2.0.\n\n*\n\n*If you want to use more (advanced) features from Google-Hangouts web-service (aka: GH network, previously aka: GT network) then do this : TB includes basic web-browser (aka: lightweight web-browser), so a web-browser tab can be opened-up inside TB, and used to connect with Google-Hangouts web-service (aka: GH network) website https://hangouts.google.com/ directly, to send/receive IM messages with your any contacts-list/address-book.\nInside TB web-browser tab, you may need to stop annoying & privacy-rights violating ADs/deceptions, So you may need to get AdBlock type of addon's XPI file from Mozilla Firefox addons website, and then load that XPI file inside TB if the addon is not available in TB addons website: get uBlock Origin addon, (imo, its better than AdBlock addon in many aspects) . Detail info on installation is here: HowToUse AdBlock TypeOfAddon To Block ADs/etc In Basic WebBrowser and HowToUse Basic WebServices in Basic WebBrowser. ( PLEASE UPVOTE THESE RELATED LINKS TOO IF YOU FIND THEM HELPFUL . THANKS IN ADVANCE IF YOU'RE UPVOTING ).\n\n*you may need to Allow \"Less Secure\" Access in your Google Account settings https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78754 . By the way, to Google using other company's software is \"less secure\" even if other company/software uses stronger & better encryption+security (to protect people/user's private data), and even if other company/software does-not SPY on user's data the way (hypocritical) Google does.\n\nGH = Google-Hangouts (previously aka: Google-Talk, aka: GTalk, aka: GT, etc) . IM = Instant-Messaging (aka: Chat) . aka = also known as . Ggl = Google . f.e.=for-example . i.e.=in-example . e.g.=example-goes . Lic = License (aka: Permissions & Restrictions).\n\nGH/GT/XMPP/etc SERVICE/NETWORK:\n\n*\n\n*GH network (aka: GH web-service) uses Jabber aka XMPP protocol for (text) IM, contact-list, etc, and uses Jingle (libjingle, a proprietary protocol) for VoIP(Voice-overIP)/Video-over-IP, etc.\n\n*\n\n*User/you can use/enter these config info 1, 2 (if you're asked-for or prompted):\n• connect server: talk.google.com\n• protocol: XMPP\n• username: yourEmailAdrs@gmail.com or username@gmail.com (or yourEmailAdrs@example.com)\n• password: your-Gmail-Or-Google-Accnt-Password\n• connection port: 5222 (also see \"firewall(outbound)\" info below)\n• connection security: select SSL/TLS (or Require Encryption type of option).\n• local alias: usually, leave this field blank.\n• domain: specify just \"gmail.com\" (w/o double-quote symbols) if you're using Google account for-example \"yourEmailAdrs@gmail.com\" which has Google domain \"gmail.com\" , but if you've registered for your own domain \"example.com\" based email-address \"yourEmailAdrs@example.com\" with Google, then specify your domain: \"example.com\".\n• screen Name: your Google account username portion (without any @ symbol or the domain-name after it).\n• firewall(inbound): no input/inbound port opening is required.\n\n*\n\n*firewall(outbound):\n• for XMPP clients allow TCP 5222, TCP 5223, TCP 5224.\n• for Android phones: TCP 5228 & 5229.\n• for XMPP federation: TCP 5269.\n• for original GH client allow UDP from 19302 through 19309, TCP from 19305 thru 19309, TCP 443 (and UDP 443).\n• you may whitelist these IP-address ranges for GT/GH/GM, etc: GT/GH services use 172.253.117.*/24, 74.125.136.*/24, 172.217.0.*/24, 108.177.*.*/16, 173.194.*.*/16, 172.22.0.1/?, etc. Google-Meet media components additionally use these: IPv4: 74.125.250.0/24, IPv6: 2001:4860:4864:5::0/64. Note: these IP ranges should be same in most areas but in some areas it will be different based on your client-software's (and Ggl server's) location.\n\nOTHER APPS THAT CAN CONNECT WITH GH/GT/XMPP SERVICE/NETWORK:\nI'm now using macOS Catalina (and also use Snow Leopard), so after upgrade from much below version (macOS Lion),\ni was also amazed to find out that, support for GH/GT was dropped !!\n\n*\n\n*Apple has changed many many other factors & apps in macOS 10.15.x Catalina, (this type of major changes began with macOS 10.14.x Mojave).\n\n*in Catalina, Apps MUST need to be 64-bit only, if any initial starting components are 32-bit, then it won't start/work/run.\nSo Mojave is the last version where both 32bit & 64bit mac app can work/run normally.\n\n*by the way, in Catalina there are non-normal (aka manual) ways to load support for 32bit app selectively, but its not easy (or safe) obviously.\n\n*but WINE-project based solutions are easier, to run 32bit (and some 64bit) WINDOWS apps in macOS : Big Sur (64bit-only), Catalina (64bit-only), Mojave(32bit-&-64bit) & before . Also see this answer for loading Wine on 64bit-only macOS, by using MacPorts (MacPorts is written in TCL & C. Lic:BSD). WINE is written in C, has Lic: LGPLv2.1+.\n\n*few months back, i've seen a website-page, a user has obtained Hangouts files, either after installing (old) Hangouts in Windows 1st, Or used (old) Hangouts from old computer. Copied those GH files in macOS & used WINE app to run it in (Mojave) macOS.\n\n*\n\n*as far as i'm aware, Wine-project has began to support running 32bit & 64bit Windows apps in 64bit-only macOS (Catalina, Big Sur, etc).\n\n\n\nAnd as far as i remember, there was a native (32bit/64bit) Hangouts app for macOS. And there was also a native app for Windows (which i'm 100% sure).\n\n*\n\n*My web-search did show website that is sharing native Hangouts app for macOS (and Windows) , but Google removed + discontinued linked files, so NOT downloadable anymore from a trustworthy or the source website.\n\n*if that native Hangouts (32bit version) app for macOS can be obtained, then that should've worked in Mojave 32bit+64bit macOS, but that will not work on (64bit-only) Catalina.\n\n*\n\n*Google-Talk v1.0.0.104 (Windows) here https://dl.google.com/googletalk/googletalk-setup.exe, v 1,606,064 bytes, MD5:8260031b32d9101c9f222161a87ff2f1, SHA1:83b5614bcbe19d992a617e059943c297ddffc848, file-date: Mar-24, 2008.\nTo use Windows app in macOS use WINE-project's macOS app.\nNote: by the end of 2017 or sometime closer, GT services were transitioned gradually into GH services.\n\n*Google-Hangouts (GH) chrome app is here, and GH chrome extension is here, also see below \"Chromium\" section.\nNote: by the end of 2019 or around that time, GH services began to be transitioned gradually into GM(Google-Meet) services, (as of Sept-2020 it has not completed yet).\n\n\n\n*Android & iOS has Google-Hangouts (mobile) app in AppStore/PlayStore. It allows text, voice, video chat, group chat/conference, etc.\n\n*\n\n*for video/audio chat, you may use Google-Duo1 (or Google-Meet) from any desktop/mobile web-browser. Google-Duo (mobile) app is free & in iTuneStore/PlayStore. It allows video, audio, text chat, group chat/conference (upto 12 users), etc.\n\n\n\n*Google-Hangouts (standalone/desktop app) version ? hash-code ? .\nGoogle-Hangouts (desktop) app may be still available in macOS AppStore for older than macOS Mojave (that is, for macOS High-Sierra), or may be available from app caching sites.\n\n*\n\n*Warning: AppStore/PlayStore app caching/sharing 3rd-party websites may be sharing altered/modified apps, Or may be sharing apps that has been removed by Apple/Google for violating Privacy-Rights or other Human-Rights Or removed for containing malware (aka: virus), that is, they have SPYING codes/components or malware codes, etc, And it is also possible that some app was exposing Apple/Google/Microsoft or Govt SPYING or Human-Rights violation, etc, so the app was removed/censored/banned completely or in some locality . If you can atleast obtain hash/checksum (integrity) code of original file from source/authentic site, then getting files from caching site (or torrent) is ok, provided you understand the risks mentioned few sentences earlier.\n\nOther app options mentioned in this page by other users have been considered+used by me, but i have chosen TB,\nand, you are or any user is always free to choose whatever you/user prefer.\n\n*\n\n*By the way, Adium last version 1.5.10.4 is old (3yrs), not uptodate, various security patches are not applied. Can allow text based chat. It supports many IM/chat network/service connections . Adium is written in objC, Cocoa. Uses libpurple. Licensed under GPL.\n\nRegular/free google account holders can use Google-Hangouts (previously aka: Google-Talk, aka: GTalk) web-service (aka: GH IM network, aka: GH chat network) directly from Google's Hangouts website:\nhttps://hangouts.google.com/\nyou have to use a web-browser software to access that, so use: Safari, Firefox, Chromium, etc, Or, use a basic web-browser tab inside Thunderbird (TB) to access above GH web-service directly, and the process to use TB based web-browser tab is described in detail in top side section. Another choice is, use Chromium web-browser (see below Chromium section) to turn the URL https://hangouts.google.com/ into a web-app, so you can launch it instantly & access directly.\n\n*\n\n*By the way, i do NOT RECOMMEND using Google-CHROME ( aka: Ch / GC / Chrome / GCh / gCh / gCH etc) , because it acts like a SPYWARE (aka: anti-Privacy-Rights software), it loads various auto startups in various deep levels of OS without fully aware consent of computer's owner, etc, etc various issues. And it has many non-open-source components.\nIf you must have to use something similar, then use \"Chromium\" (aka: CM / CH / Google-Chromium ) , it is open-source web-browser , it was initially developed by Google LLC, based on WebKit . Chrome uses \"Blink\" rendering engine and V8 (JavaScript engine). \"Blink\" is based on modified \"WebKit\" engine . WebKit was made open-source(LGPL) by Apple Inc, and then Adobe Systems, KDE, Igalia, & others joined . Later Microsoft, Igalia, Yandex, & others joined to develop CHROMIUM / CM web-browser . Later Facebook, Opera Software, Adobe Systems, Intel, IBM, Samsung, & others joined to develop Blink . Many many web-browsers are actually based on modified/customized version of this CM web-browser or Blink engine from CM. CM is written in C, C++, JavaScript, and different portion uses different licenses: 3-clause BSD, MIT, LGPL, MS-PL, etc, so CM is distributed with tri-licensed MPL+GPL+LGPL.\n\n*\n\n*and be aware that many devs/companies/corps have tendency to apply new/experimental feats (aka: \"features\", etc) that are NOT free of Privacy-Rights violating activities, (in another word, those feats can be abused to SPY to collect private data (unconstitutionally) from user's device, & user's private data in server or private data in transit, etc . And also be aware that many devs also have tendency to either HIDE, or NOT report & not apply \"FIX\"/solution that will remove/stop SPYING or stop private data collection).\n\n\n\n*So \"Chrome\" & \"Chromium\" are not same software product.\n\n*\n\n*Google uses codes from \"Chromium\" (CM) web-browser, and also adds their own proprietary (and non-OpenSource) codes, to build \"Google-Chrome\" (gCH).\n\n\n\n*Most of the extensions/plugins for \"Chrome\" will also work with \"Chromium\".\n\n*Various web-sites/web-services (for example: https://hangouts.google.com/ site) can be used as an app via Chromium.\n\n*So you will be able to use \"Google-Hangouts\", etc Chrome extension/plugin (or Chrome app) with \"Chromium\" web-browser.\n\n*Chromium (web-browser), can be obtained from here:\n\n*\n\n*https://SourceForge.net/projects/osxportableapps/files/Chromium/\n\n*https://download-chromium.appspot.com/\n\n\n\n*Then obtain \"Google-Hangouts\":\n\n*\n\n*either, chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-hangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd\n\n*or, chrome app: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts/knipolnnllmklapflnccelgolnpehhpl\n\n*follow instruction here.\n\nParrot uses Hangover, a swift based library (which is based on hangups-library), to connect with GH network, etc.  Lic: MPL2.0.\n\nMonal 1 can use XMPP networks (so Google-Talk/GT/GH is supported), and Jingle VoIP, etc, and it is available from Github, iTunes-AppStore, macOS-AppStore. Its written with objC, C++, and licensed under BSD-Lic.\n\nYakYak is open-source & can connect with Google-Hangouts web-service (aka: GH network). Allows text based chat in the app, and allows video/voice chat via Electron which uses Chromium core, etc.\n\n*\n\n*YakYak is written in CoffeeScript (nodejs) based on hangupsjs (aka: hangups) using trifl on top of Electron(aka: Atom-Shell). Licensed under MIT-Lic. Please also see below sub-section for warning about Electron.\n\nGoogle-Messages for Desktop 1 (GMfD) (aka: Android-Messages for Desktop, AMfD) is an unofficial (aka 3rdparty) open-source project based solution which uses a wrapper around the official https://messages.google.com/ web client. The GMfD is not-affiliated & not-endorsed by Google or Google-Messages1. Its written with JavaScript, objC, & appears to be licensed under BSD or MIT Lic . GMfD uses risky Electron.\n\n*\n\n*Be aware of these: Electron 1, 2 framework (EJS) previously known as Atom-Shell, developed by GitHub . EJS uses+integrates various components, & each components have many many known bugs/vulnerabilities 1 so EJS may not be very secure . EJS uses Chromium web-browser core . EJS based apps may also have very significant overhead (aka: excessive memory, CPU, etc usage) 1, 2 due to their Chromium core (aka: Blink) dependency, when compared with similar native apps . EJS is written in C++, JavaScript, Objective-C++, Python and Objective-C, and Licensed under MIT-Lic.\n\nYou can use Google-Meet (GM) https://meet.google.com/ web-service URL from any modern web-browser, it will allow to use your free Google accounts (since Mar/Apr 2020, Google has allowed free usage, until July 2020, after that free-users will have reduced features & reduced minutes, restrictions, etc). GM allows video, voice, text chat, group chat/conference, share desktop, etc. It was previously known as \"Hangouts Meet\". You can contact with your any Google-Hangouts contacts-list/address-book. Android & iOS has Google-Meet app in AppStore/PlayStore. There is no native GM app for macOS or Windows. You can create a web-client app for the web-service URL https://meet.google.com/ by using Chromium (or Chrome) web-browser.\n\nIf your Google account is a type of G-Suite account (business/organizaion type, etc type of google account),\nthen get 64-bit Google-Chat app from here: Google-Chat (64bit) for G-Suite\nGoogle-Chat is NOT for regular/free Google account users/holders.\nGoogle-Hangouts-Chat (GHC) available here, also iTunes-AppStore(iOS).\nGHC is for organization, etc type of users, (not for free Google account users).\n\nIf you are a software developer, then look into below option(s):\nthese can/may allow to use GT/GH network when compiled in macOS, or when compiled after necessary code modifications:\n\n*\n\n*ChatSecure 1 can connect with XMPP networks, etc from iOS(iPhone/iPad),etc, it supports connection via proxy, etc, and its available in iTunes-AppStore(iOS). Its written in objC, Swift, etc, and licensed under GPLv3+. To use in macOS, source code modifications & compilation is needed.\n\nHYPERVISOR / VIRTUALIZATION BASED SOLUTION:\nThese HyperVisor1 app(s) can be used to run a guest macOS (in our case, here, it will be an older High-Sierra macOS) under your current host macOS (Mojave/Catalina/BigSur), and you can use both of your (host/current and guest/virtual) macOS together at the same time:\n\n*\n\n*VirtualBox (VB) is a virtualization (aka: hypervisor) software that can create (guest) virtual machine/computer. Obtain1 & install it. Create a virtual machine inside VB with 2GB RAM, 30GB hard-disk allotted for it, and choose machine type macOS based. Get High-Sierra macOS installer app or dmg file from Apple 1, 2, 3, convert that into a DVD disc image \"ISO\" type of file1, & attach the ISO file with a virtual dvd-drive inside a virtual Mac machine inside the VirtualBox app. Start virtual guest Mac machine (inside the VB app), install the older macOS High-Sierra, and configure it, now you can use \"Messages.app\" inside Virtual Mac computer (with High-Sierra macOS) which can connect with Google-Talk/Google-Hangouts.\n\n*\n\n*VB is open-source and written in C, C++, x86 Assembly, Python, and its licensed under GNU GPLv2, CDDL1, PUEL1.\n\n*VM = Virtual Machine . VB = VirtualBox . GVM = Guest VM . HM = Host Machine/Computer . HS = High-Sierra macOS.\n\n\n\n*xhyve is an open-source lightweight OS X virtualization software based on bhyve. Its written in C, C++, and licensed under BSD-2-Clause Lic.\n\n*you may also use other virtualization software: Parallels Desktop for Mac (its proprietary and not-open-sourced) , Bochs (its open-source) , etc.\n\nIf you do not have DMG or app installer for HS macOS, then first goto notpeter's github page:\n\n*\n\n*get hash/checksum code-numbers of High-Sierra (HS) version 10.13.6 or another 10.13.x\n\n*\n\n*HS 10.13.6 (17G65) \"InstallESD.dmg\" file has hash/checksum code-number SHA1:69159caf25666ea1c5d466e158e075d947f6a9ee, (& Size: ?), and the file \"BaseSystem.dmg\" inside that, has this hash/checksum code-number: SHA1:6b7522d7f78b93441ecd7dee73430af9b07b3744, (& Size: ?).\n\n\n\n*look/search for a torrent that has HS dmg file, investigate 1st before download if the included dmg's hash-code matches any one of those hash/checksum code-numbers shown above, or else if you find-out after downloading that downloaded dmg file's hash code did not-match then your network/data bandwidth will be wasted . Do Not Run Downloaded \"App\"/\"DMG\"-File Without Calculating/Checking It's Hash Code First . After download you MUST have to calculate+findOut dmg file's hash/checksum code. If calculated hash code does not match with SHA1 hash-code(s) shown above, then downloaded file is not original file, they were modified & So such file might contain fishy/malware apps/code inside it, So you MUST move such into a folder name \"DeleteThese\" or \"TrashThese\", & search again.\n\n*\n\n*instead of finding torrent with specific HS dmg from an unknown person , you can also request a friend that has HS to share the dmg file, but as the dmg file's size is huge, sharing such huge file is not easy. And request your friend to first \"zip\" the dmg file with a password . Your friend must create a torrent file with that (password-protected) \"zip\" file, and your friend must also mention inside that torrent that it is a password-protected \"zip\" file (for private use, only with a specific friend), during creation of that torrent file . Then unknown people will not obtain it (as they do not have the password) so your friend did not share it unfairly & did not share with mass users, and as you are both owner of real Mac (hardware) computer, so its not an unfair sharing . It will take long time to transfer such huge file, if connection is not-speedy or has less bandwidth.\n\n*If you do not want to obtain file in above mentioned way, then you have to read a lot, search & go thru various web-pages in MacRumors forum website and in this apple.StackExchange.com website, where various users have collaborated & shared info & shown how a user can obtain files from Apple servers or Apple computers, & then how a user can extract/convert that to an ISO file. Few of such linked-pages are now shown in above VB paragraph.\n\n\n\n*extract \"BaseSystem.dmg\" & convert it into ISO file, instruction is here.\n\n*use the process mentioned in VB section above, to use the ISO file to load the HS macOS in a virtual Mac machine, then you can finally use the GH/GT network via \"Messages.app\" from High-Sierra macOS.\n\n*spend time to fine-tune configurations inside the HS(High-Sierra) guest macOS : use configurations mentioned here 1, 2 to speed-up macOS, etc.\n\n*\n\n*Basically do this: disable all apps & services inside the (High-Sierra) guest macOS that are already present in host macOS (Mojave/Catalina/BigSur), when guest macOS will use lesser (background) services & apps, etc, then it will use lesser RAM & lesser CPU, so it will run faster . Reboot VM, & while VB is running, take Snapshot of Mac-VM, so that you can go back to Snapshot point of time+state where it was running faster & was using lesser computing resources . Close VB, & make backup copy of all files related to Mac-VM . Later, if you find that snapshot is not-working, then you can use the backup files, to overwrite in Mac-VM folder, to go back to fine-tuned stage.\n\nWARNING:\nAnd also be aware of this : Google-Hangouts network (web-service) does not use end-to-end (E2E) encrypted packets , only part of the communication data is actually encrypted, i.e: data transit from end-user to google central/federated server(s).\n\nA: You can't.

Until recently (although I'm not sure how recent), macOS shipped Dictionary.app with dictionary definitions built in.\nAs of macOS Mojave, this is no longer the case. The first time you open Dictionary.app, you are prompted to download definitions from the internet.\nHow can I transfer a copy of these definitions to a fully offline computer? I can't seem to figure out where they are stored.\nA way to capture the original .pkg file from Apple's servers (assuming this is how the downloads are distributed) would also be an acceptable answer.\n\nUpdate 10/11/18:\nPer answers below, I now know that dictionaries are stored as .dictionary files in /System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices. However, moving them to this folder on a new machine does not cause them to be recognized in Dictionary.app.\nInterestingly, if you open one of these .dictionary files in Dictionary.app, you get a message saying the dictionary could not be imported, because the \"folder\" format is not supported. Which begs the question, what format would be supported...\n\nA: They are located in (HighSierra) \nAside from this, you will find packaged dictionaries here:\n~/Library/Dictionaries/\n\nthere is also the words file here /usr/share/dict/words\nUser specific Dictionaries are stored here /System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices (based on your Language and Keyboard selection), here is mine, so if you have chosen Polish it will be there.\n\ncopy and paste in to Finder GoTo\nDo not copy the Folder, just the dictionary it self.\n\nA: Now in MacOS Catalina the folder is apparently /System/Library/AssetsV2/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX. There's also another folder called /System/Library/AssetsV2/PreinstalledAssetsV2/InstallWithOs/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX that might contain the dictionaries as well.\nTo make the dictionaries work with Dictionary.app, the manifest com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX.xml in the folder is apparently crucial. It records the correct folder names for each dictionary.\n\nA: On my computer running High Sierra 10.13.6, one of the dictionaries I was presented with was called: \"New Oxford American Dictionary\". I did a global search on my computer for that name and I got a hit on this name: New Oxford American Dictionary.dictionary. It is located in: \n/System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX/975b56580ea4bbbe1d29ca14a3b5e1a81411c787.asset/AssetData/New Oxford American Dictionary.dictionary.\nI don't know if this is what you're looking for but its the only hit I got on the dictionary name.

So, sorry if this question is not appropriate, but I really did some reasearch and only could find half of my answers or questions which were the other way round (cannot control this via the keywords I'm searching).\nSo, I can choose between the newest MacBook Pro and a Dell Windows Laptop by work. Intended purpose is to do some emergency coding at home, which will be the case no more than 2 hours per month; normally there are many months where I don't have to do anything at all. Which means that I will rarely spend any time with the Mac. I am coming from Windows and Linux OS and my concern is, that due to the rare occasions, I will not adapt to the strange keyboard settings (special characters like !\"$&/()[] etc). So my question is, are there tools to completely emulate a Windows keyboard layout, so every character is at the same place? And if so, what are your experiences with it / would you recommend it?\nAlso, I wonder if it is possible to plug a regular Windows USB keyboard in the Macbook and have the character input Windows-like, or do I have to setup stuff for that? How can I use MacOS keyboard shortcuts with such a keyboard?\nI already found stuff like Karabiner and this, but I cannot see what exactly those are doing and what it's limits are, also if it is really recommended or merely tedious.\nSide note, I am used to German layout on all my machines and would like to keep it that way.\nAlso to understand why I would even choose a Mac with these concerns: My earlier experiences with terminal emulators on windows are very bad to say at least. They are clunky, ugly, often buggy and most times don't catch special keys like for VIM or TMUX. So I would like to try the native linux-y terminals of Mac.\nAs long as I don't know about the keyboard layout, I am not sure which of the two OS is the lesser evil for me.\n\nA: Some language Input Sources have \"PC\" variants, which follow the PC keyboard layout in that language.\n\nAlthough there isn't a \"German - PC\" input source, there is a \"German - Standard\" input source, which seems to be the same as German PC keyboards, from what I can gather. You may still need to swap round CTRL and Command, if you want to do that.\n\nA: Yes, this is possible with Karabiner-Elements. There are already pre-configured modifications for German keyboards by the community: https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/?q=german\n\nA: Here you can find an easy solution for adding a new keyboard input source in your mac setting for German-PC layout:\nhttps://administrator.de/tutorial/deutsche-pc-tastatur-am-apple-mac-einrichten-221078.html\n", "Q: Software for splitting or trimming MP4 video without transcoding I occasionally need to trim an MP4 video or split a clip out of the middle.

In Mojave the Streamclip GUI is almost useless, and it's 32 bit so 10.15 will kill it entirely. Same for Quicktime 7.\nI'm sure I'm not the only person who wants to trim and split video on a Mac. What are the options for lightweight editors to trim MP4s without transcoding?\nEdit to explain how this is not a duplicate of Is there an easy way on a Mac to split an audio file at defined intervals?:\nThis question is about splitting a video file, not an audio file, at points decided by scrubbing through the video, not on a defined interval. That question currently has no accepted answer, and the answers that were proposed do not apply to this question.\n\nA: Movie Splitter\nYou can split your .mp4 movie without transcoding using Movie Splitter – which I wrote for my own needs.\nThere is a demo you can download and try.\n\nSplitting and Trimming Custom Sections\nMovies can be automatically split by embedded chapter markers, halved into two, or quartered into four. Version 1.4 added the options to let you select custom ranges to be extracted – by scrubbing or through keyboard input for fine grained control.\n\n\nA: LosslessCut \nhttps://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut (lightweight)\nShotcut \nhttps://www.shotcut.org (heavy)\n\nA: You can do this (and many other things) with ffWorks. It is actually a GUI for ffmpeg, a really powerful encoding tool.\nJust be aware: it costs 19€ and may be a bit more difficult to use, but if you plan to do any more video/audio conversion I can absolutely recommend this software as you can do a lot of things with it.\nFor trimming without reencoding with ffWorks: select \"PassThru\" for video and audio codec and add the trim filter.\nClick \"edit\" on the trim filter to open a GUI similar to what you described.\n\nFor multiple splits I recommend the open source project mkvtoolnix, which can also do many more things than that. It only outputs MKV however, but these can easily be converted to MP4s with ffWorks (without reencoding of course) within few seconds.\n\nA: Avidemux is a lightweight editor that can split videos without transcoding: \n\n\n*\n\n*Start Avidemux\n\n*Open a file e.g. by dropping it into the Avidemux window \n\n*Choose where your video should start and then click on the (red) “A” button below.\n\n*Choose where your video should stop and then click on the “B” button below.\n\n*Select an output format (e.g. mp4). Note: there are two mp4 versions. If one does not work, just try the other.\n\n*Click on the save icon. Avidemux will propose a new file name based on the old one adding an “_edit” before the suffix.

In macOS 10.14 Mojave Apple turned the «LCD font smoothing» setting (which turned a subpixel antialiasing on) to «just font smoothing» setting. So now all the text is rendered just antialiased that looks worse on not-retina displays. How to enable the subpixel antialiasing back?\n\nA: To add to the accepted answer, you may need to turn off the new \"just font smoothing\" implementation after enabling subpixel antialiasing. This solves the pixelated text issue user benwiggy commented about on a 13.3\" mid-2012 MacBook Pro (1280 x 800 non-retina screen) and especially for very small font sizes. By leaving the font smoothing option enabled simultaneously with subpixel antialiasing, the text weight appears inconsistent and \"pixelated\".\nI doubt screenshots will do the visible difference justice, but here are some comparisons anyway.

It may affect the prices for lower-tier devices or they may get discontinued.\nI am planning to give an iPad 9.7 (2018) as a Christmas present. In case the product line should change soon, would it be viable to buy one of those quickly before they disappear from the stores? Will the battery be fine if the iPad remains in its un-opened original packaging for 2-3 more months?\n\nA: \nwill the battery be fine if the iPad remains in its unopened original packaging for 2-3 more months?\n\nYou should be fine.\nThe official advise from Apple when keeping an iPad device in long term storage without being used is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Charge your iPad battery to about 50 percent.\n\n*Turn your iPad off to avoid additional battery use.\n\n\n(Sharing the screenshot of the Apple support document webpage, as it is no longer accessible.)\n\n\n\nNew iPads come packaged in this state. So, you should be fine keeping the packaging unopened for 2-3 months.\nWhen a product is discontinued by Apple, it typically doesn’t vanish overnight from store(s) and it should be easy to buy one (also from 3rd party resellers). You may also find discounted pricing from 3rd party sellers. So, general advise would be to hold on until any announcement is made by Apple.\nI'd advise to wait till around Christmas (or delay the purchase as much as you can) to make the best decision regarding model to pick and pricing. It's likely you may end up picking a better option (newer model with upgraded specs, same model with more internal storage) for similar price. You may end up finding some holiday offers as well.\nKeep watching for any release announcements from Apple. If you wish to receive an email instead, subscribe to the Apple product announcement newsletters as outlined here.\n\nA: Yes, it will be fine. But also, there’s no way that Apple are going to discontinue a product that was only released six months ago, unless with a like-for-like replacement that’s slightly improved at a similar price. The iPhone SE was 2½ years old when discontinued; it’s not comparable. \n", "Q: Why do some accessories work with the Lightning – USB3 Camera Adapter while others don't? Context\nI borrowed an iPad Pro to work on while my laptop was down, but without a physical keyboard, I found it frustrating to type anything more than a short sentence on it.\nAfter countless typos and wrist fatigue, I tried connecting a full-sized USB keyboard (specifically, this one) using the Lightning to USB 3 Camera adapter, and it worked perfectly! Volume control, screen brightness, function keys, all worked, pretty much identically to how a bluetooth keyboard might when connected to an iOS device.\nBut much to my confusion, it did exactly the opposite the next day. When I plugged the keyboard in, it didn't seem to be recognized by the iPad.\nTapping on a text field brought up the soft keyboard as usual, and none of the keystrokes I entered on the physical keyboard seemed to register. The escape button worked as the home button the day before, and the \"fn\" keys for media control as well, but not anymore.\nI hadn't made any changes I think would have been significant (no iOS updates, no adapter firmware updates — unless those are installed silently, then I wouldn't know). The iPad wasn't even restarted. It was working fine one day, but after being disconnected overnight, it apparently decided not to recognize the keyboard at all?? There was no \"This accessory may not be supported\" popup that I have seen when plugging in inadequate cables, chargers, etc.\nQuestion\nI was a little disappointed, and found it so bizarre that I tried to investigate what exactly caused the setup to stop working overnight, and eventually came to the question of what makes a particular setup of iOS Device + USB Camera adapter + USB device work in the first place?\nNormally with a USB accessory compatibility issue between a computer, the drivers/device tree would be the first place I would have looked, but the communication that happens through the camera adapter and the lightning port seems to be a black box. I recently got an iPad Pro (9.5-inch), and one of the first things I tried was using the hardware keyboard with it, but no success.\nI jailbroke the iPad (iOS 11.2.5, using Electra1131 MPTCP), but I realized I have no idea where the USB-through-adapter-through-lightning devices are exposed, or if they even are.\nNow I know that using the camera adapter for anything other than cameras, and some specifically listed devices certified to work with it is hit-and-miss, but I had always thought it was one or the other. The fact that it worked at one point and stopped working so very soon after has me dying to know what the culprit is, and how the communication works to let the iPad act as the USB host. \nAre there drivers in iOS? Are they baked into the firmware of the camera adapter? Is it just a big mystery? Any pointers on where to look would be appreciated as well, bearing in mind I have access to the filesystem, and the system runtime, but usually not for third-party applications. \n\nA: Yes, there are drivers in iOS. iOS is based on Darwin, the same as macOS. It is the exact same type of drivers.\nNo, these drivers are not baked into the firmware of the camera adapter. The camera adapter itself does not have specific support for storage devices, keyboards, cameras, ethernet adapters, MIDI keyboards or anything else that you would like to plug in. Those types of drivers run in the operating system on the iOS device itself.\nA place to start looking for more runtime information about connected USB units is to run the command \"dmesg\" after plugging in the device. You can also look for and/or install custom kernel extensions supporting specific types of USB devices.\nOne common cause of problems with USB devices on iOS devices is that the USB port only delivers a very small amount of power. Many USB devices require more power than this port can provide. You'll then need to plug the USB device into a powered USB hub, and then connect the hub with the camera adapter to the iOS device.\n\nA: I've seen this problem and the resolution is to connect power before connecting the phone or USB device.  Oh, and the power supply should be rated for at least 12 watts.  A powered hub might help but as I recall that was not enough.\nYour comments indicate you tried connecting things in different order but you did not mention the power output of the power brick.  I've seen this behavior with a 5 watt supply but not with a 12 watt supply.  If you have something bigger than 12 watts for power then I recommend you use it.\nGiven the age of this post I'm commenting mostly for others with the same problem.  I suspect the original problem has been long resolved by now.\n", "Q: I don't have Siri enabled but get Siri suggestions in iOS 12 I've disabled Siri years ago, before updating to iOS 11 and now iOS 12 on my iPhone 6S.

As per Apple support document, How to upgrade to macOS Mojave:\n\n1. Check compatibility\nYou can upgrade to macOS Mojave from OS X Mountain Lion or later on\n  any of the following Mac models. Your Mac also needs at least 2GB of\n  memory and 12.5GB of available storage space, or up to 18.5GB of\n  storage space when upgrading from OS X Yosemite or earlier.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*MacBook introduced in early 2015 or later\n  \n*MacBook Air introduced in mid 2012 or later\n  \n*MacBook Pro introduced in mid 2012 or later\n  \n*Mac mini introduced in late 2012 or later\n  \n*iMac introduced in late 2012 or later\n  \n*iMac Pro (all models)\n  \n*Mac Pro introduced in late 2013, plus mid-2010 or mid-2012 models with a recommended Metal-capable graphics card.\n  \n\nI am currently running macOS High Sierra on my Early 2011 MacBook Pro.\nWhat does Apple's requirements mean for my ability to install Mojave? Is it possible or worthwhile to do so?\n\nA: macOS Mojave is not officially supported on 2011 MacBook Pro.\nInstalling macOS Mojave requires a Mac that has support for Metal Graphics API, which is absent from your model of MacBook Pro.\n\nA: For an unpatched installer the requirements set forth are final. Early 2011 MacBook Pros are not supported and the installer will not work.\nThat does not mean that it does not work at all.\nUsing dosdude1's Mojave patcher you can install it easily, but with quite a number of some caveats:\n\nCurrent Issues\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Graphics anomalies: Currently, pre-metal video cards used in Mojave will produce a weird darkish grey Menu Bar and Finder sidebar when using the light theme. In the dark theme, these anomalies are not present, while other, less obvious anomalies are present (window corners may not render properly, bottom part of dock menus may have artifacts). A workaround for graphics anomalies in light mode is to enable Reduce Transparency in System Preferences > Accessibility > Display (this might create additional side effects beside the obvious loss of transpareny as some systems with pre-metal AMD graphics render the dock in dark gray).\n  \n*AMD Radeon HD 5xxx/6xxx series GPU acceleration: Currently, it is not possible to get full graphics acceleration when running Mojave on a system with a Radeon HD 5xxx or 6xxx series GPU. Mojave will be almost UNUSABLE without graphics acceleration. This includes the 15\" and 17\" MacBook Pro systems (MacBookPro8,2 and 8,3). If you want to enable GPU acceleration on these machines, you'll need to disable the AMD GPU (This will work on MacBook Pro 8,2 and 8,3 systems ONLY. You CANNOT disable the AMD GPU in an iMac.) Weird colors will also be produced when running Mojave with one of these video cards installed/enabled. To disable the AMD GPU on a 2011 MacBook Pro 8,2 or 8,3, follow the guide found here.\n\nConcerning the last sentence: \"To disable the AMD GPU on a 2011 MacBook Pro 8,2 or 8,3, follow the guide found here\", I might add: and here ;)\nNotice that disabling AMD on that machine also means losing the ability to drive a second monitor. Bad for multi-monitor setups, doing presentations… –– Also note that while the integrated Intel HD3000 will provide you with some GUI acceleration,  (but nothing like the Metal-API, as noted in Nimesh's answer) it is known to be a bit buggy, and increasingly hardware acceleration gets blacklisted by applications like Firefox, Chrome and VLC…\nSo, curiously: a defective discrete GPU makes a hacked Mojave install in these machines more attractive than a working one, as with a toasted dGPU you will lose less in the process.\n\nWhether the upgrade is worth it for his machine is another issue. In a comment you wrote that \n\nreplaced the keyboard and the battery to get more life out of my MBP. I don't want to let go of my matt screen! And all my lovely ports!\n\nThis leaves it undetermined whether you upgraded from platter hard disk to SSD. The forced conversion to APFS renders this option undesirable on hard disks. On an SSD that might be not an issue, but I still don't like APFS and regard that filesystem as immature.\nThen High Sierra and even Sierra are presumably still supported for some time regarding security updates or application compatibility. From that perspective there is no need to let go of that machine right now.\nAs this is totally unsupported by Apple: an early 2011 MBP might break at any time with a future update from Apple. Unless you really need a 10.14-only application –– or maybe die to get darkmode? – there is currently no compelling reason to do this if you want to work with that machine.\nA final piece of opinion. If you love your machine with its matte screen, new battery, new keyboard and all those lovely ports: then experience tells me that any Mac lover is well advised to not upgrade immediately to an .0-OS-release from Apple. Do not upgrade now, wait a bit.\n\nTo accomodate the more general question title:\nWith a patched installer these are \"the real\" bare minimum requirements right now:\n\nRequirements:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Early-2008 or newer Mac Pro, iMac, or MacBook Pro:\n  \n*MacPro3,1\n  \n*MacPro4,1\n  \n*iMac8,1\n  \n*iMac9,1\n  \n*iMac10,x\n  \n*iMac11,x (systems with AMD Radeon HD 5xxx and 6xxx series GPUs will be almost unusable when running Mojave.

So I definitely recommend upgrading to Mojave on the early 2011 MacBook Pro, my system is very noticeably faster than it was running High Sierra..\n", "Q: How to convert FusionDrive to APFS? Backstory: Installation of MacOS Mojava failed on my late '12 iMac with exception: com.apple.DiskManagement error -69854. I can find few other questions with this problem, but the general consent is, that the problem comes from Mojave trying to convert the FusionDrive to APFS. I tried the installation two times, I do have a TimeCapsule backup as welll as a USB with bootable Mojave and am ready to try things out. What I thought would be smart to do is to convert the FusionDrive to APFS before attempting to upgrade the OS. \nI see two possibilities: do it via DiskUtility, or from Terminal with diskutil. The first option does not work as the menu entry is greyed out, if I try from High Sierra as well as from the Mojave USB stick. Running diskutil list lists three disks:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            999.3 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            121.0 GB   disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s3\n\n/dev/disk2 (internal, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +1.1 TB     disk2\n                                 Logical Volume on disk1s2, disk0s2\n                                 {some id I am not sure if better hidden}\n                                 Unencrypted Fusion Drive\n\nTLDR; which one of the drives do I have to convert to APFS and how?\n\nA: Well, my experiments have found an end, here are my ideas:\nthe origin of the error -69854 seems to be that there is not enough storage space. \nAfter another failed attempt installing MacOS Mojave from the USB, I went into the local Recovery Mode, before downgrading, and see: \"Convert to APFS\" in DiskUtility was not greyed out. It failed, as expected, with the -69854 error. When booting from the USB, the option there was clickable too, but leading to the same error. \nAfter moving and deleting some stuff to make more free storage space on Macintosh HD, the \"Convert to APFS option\" suceeded! Afterwards, installation of Mojave from the USB suceeded too. \nBut to answer the rest of my question, after some more research:\nTo convert to apfs: diskutil apfs convert <Name of the Disk>. The correct disk seems to be – in my case – /dev/disk2 according to the Details of the DiskUtility. DiskUtility itself uses /sbin/apfs_hfs_convert – use man apfs_hfs_convert in Terminal if you want to learn more about that one.\n", "Q: Why is /usr/include missing? I have Xcode and Command Line Tools installed (Mojave) I just upgraded to Mojave from High Sierra and installed Xcode plus its command line tools and additional tools. Nothing will compile from the terminal, everything says /usr/include is missing!\nI checked and ALL the Dev related dirs under /usr are missing!\nAny idea how to fix?\n\nA: The \"why\" is because Apple has deprecated having a /usr/include distinct from the SDK. You shouldn't rely on having it going forward.\nThe compilers know already to find their includes inside the SDK, so there's no real need for the /usr/include directory any more. You can find the SDK's install directory for the include files using xcrun --show-sdk-path\n\nA: Add the -isysroot flag to your compile flags to automatically include the appropriate SDK header directory and avoid the need for the /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg package that will \"in a future release, ... no longer be provided.\"\nExamples:\n-isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk\nor\n-isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk\nYou can use xcrun --show-sdk-path to find the default SDK path.\nYou can also use the Xcode or CommandLineTools installed /usr/bin/ versions of clang, clang++, cc, c++, gcc, g++ which are shims calling xcrun to invoke the correct tool with the currect SDK and include directories. \nThis defaults to CommandLineTools if you have that installed.\nYou can switch the behavior to use Xcode by:\n$ sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\nor switch back:\n$ sudo xcode-select -s /Library/Developer\n\nA: You have to run another step after installing the command line tools:\nsudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /\n\nWhy? Apple have introduced a new build tool dance - system includes are now only kept under a specific SDK's path with Xcode 10 onwards:\n\nThe Command Line Tools package installs the macOS system headers inside the macOS SDK. Software that compiles with the installed tools will search for headers within the macOS SDK [...] provided by either Xcode [...] or the Command Line Tools [...] depending on which is selected using xcode-select.\n[...]\nThe command line tools will search the SDK for system headers by default. However, some software may fail to build correctly against the SDK and require macOS headers to be installed in the base system under /usr/include [emphasis added]. If you are the maintainer of such software, we encourage you to update your project to work with the SDK or file a bug report for issues that are preventing you from doing so.  As a workaround, an extra package is provided which will install the headers to the base system. In a future release, this package will no longer be provided. You can find this package at:\n  /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg\nTo make sure that you're using the intended version of the command line tools, run xcode-select -s <path to Xcode> or xcode select -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools after installing.\n\n", "Q: Safari deleting every tab that I open In Safari every time I close the app or turn off my iPhone, every tab that I have open is deleted.

This seems like a total abuse to the Unix file system ownership principals.

For the technical user (i.e. someone who understands Unix), I see no reason to ever enable this.

I walked through the procedure of changing my MacOS user short name.  Somehow screwed it up - such that on reboot, MacOS went through the \"new user initialization\".

This only has a Thunderbolt-3 input. Awesome monitor, but very limited when it comes to what you can drive it with.\nGoal: I'd like to use it with a non usb-c video out source. I.e., I'd like to get an eGPU and use a video card that has Displayport output (or HDMI) with that LG Ultrafine. I do understand that the Blackmagic eGPU has Thunderbolt output, but I want a better price to performance ratio than that offers.\nQuestion: Is there a displayport (or HDMI) to USB-C adapter on the market? Searching for this is not easy because everything points to the opposite (USB-C to Displayport, etc.). Alternatively, is there a MacOS compatible video card with Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C out?\nI'm ok with not getting full 5k video.\nMy apologies in advance if this has already been asked. I did search for this question but everything that comes up is about usb-c to displayport (or hdmi, etc.).\n\nA: Update: There is now the alternative you described: AMD's Radeon Pro W5700, with an integrated USB-C output.\nThe GPU isn't exactly brand new, and they haven't done a graphics card with USB-C except for that one, so options are still very limited. Since you mentioned price-to-performance compared to BlackMagic's eGPU systems, I'm not sure if this fits the bill either.\nBut as a \"Pro\" model, it was used in OEM SKU's, so you may be able to find a HP, Dell, etc. branded used card pulled from retired systems for cheap though.\n\nShort answer: no, and I wouldn't expect to see one on the market anytime soon. I think the shared connector specifications may contribute to some of the confusion, but an HDMI to USB-C adapter like you describe should seem like an impossibility, when you think about it for a second.\nHDMI and DP are basically DVI, and USB is, well, USB. You wouldn't expect to be able to plug in a display with HDMI output into a USB port through any sort of adapter and expect it to work...\nExcept in 2018, many products (several of which you mentioned) seemingly do exactly this, through an addition to the USB specs called \"Alternate Mode\", which as you might expect, allows alternate modes of transport over the USB connection.\nBut these alternate mode connections have to be negotiated and configured by the devices themselves, and the implementation of this is up to the vendors. There is no direct mapping between the pins in an HDMI or DP connector and a USB-C connector.\nTheoretically, you could design an adapter that would take the HDMI input, pass it through an HDMI-DP adapter, decode the DP signal, handle the USB-C alternate mode negotiation, translate signal levels, and output DP alternate mode over USB-C, but by this point you are looking at $15+ in the controller chips alone, not to mention it would most likely need to be externally powered.\n...which is what the Blackmagic eGPU essentially does, through Thunderbolt, not USB, though (the LG Ultrafine 5K has a Thunderbolt connector, I believe it is the 4K that uses DP alternate mode). The graphics card inside is a regular RX580, and the Thunderbolt controller takes the DP signal and multiplexes it into the TB3 chain.\nThe MacBook Pro's also do this internally, and the circuitry involved takes up a significant amount of real estate on the logic board. All in all, it's not an inexpensive thing to accomplish.\n", "Q: Remove all partitions and reinstall MacOS I want to reinstall macOS but when I tried to repartition everything it only gave me 125 GB to install the OS on even though it's a 3TB drive. I think there may have been some kind of partition corruption because the computer was acting weird before all of this. \nBasically trying to get back to square one and remove all partitions so I can do a fresh install but not sure where to go from here and why there is so much in this list (see image below):\n\nAny advice would be great.\n\nA: You have shown no evidence the internal drive is 3 TB in size.

I'm trying to execute an AppleScript .app thats compressed.\nunzip -p file.app.zip | open -\n\nor\nopen < $(unzip -p file.app.zip)\n\nIs this possible?\n\nA: You are asking the open command to open content from stdin.  open can be made to read from stdin but it will open the contents in at text editor--which isn't what you want. \nTry using osascript directly:\nIf the zipped file is simply AppleScript, then you accomplish this with the following.\nunzip -p file.zip | osascript - \n\nFrom the osascript manpage:\n\nosascript will look for the script in one of the following three places:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Specified line by line using -e switches on the command line.\n  \n*Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command line.  This file may be plain text or a compiled script.\n  \n*Passed in using standard input.  This works only if there are no filename arguments; to pass arguments to a STDIN-read script, you must explicitly specify '-' for the script name.\n\n\nA: As you are dealing with a zip compressed application .app, which is an application bundle with many files in it, I believe you'll have to extract the app to disk first to open it, because the open command to open an application is in the form of open -a ... and does not take input from stdout.\nThe following assumes that the app name in file.app.zip is file or the exact name of the app within the .zip file:\nunzip -oq \"file.app.zip\" -d /tmp; open -a \"/tmp/file.app\"; sleep 1; rm -r \"/tmp/file.app\"\n\nThe above compound command line extracts the file.app.zip to /tmp and then opens it, waits a second and then deletes the /tmp/file.app. Note that the value of the sleep command may need to be adjusted in order to not have the app deleted before it's opened and finished running.\nNote that the contents of /tmp, which is actually /private/tmp, is automatically deleted upon reboot. So the compound command line could be shortened if you don't care if the app remains in /tmp' until next reboot:\nunzip -oq \"file.app.zip\" -d /tmp; open -a \"/tmp/file.app\"\n\n", "Q: In AppleScript or JavaScript how can you click menu item?

A number of the background services used by the Photos app perform functions I'm not interested in benefitting from (and in some cases, actively do not want). Primarily these are photoanalysisd and cloudphotosd. I'm reasonably certain that the former is not strictly necessary for the Photos app to operate (if needed for some features); I'm slightly less certain about the latter but that isn't precisely the thrust of the question. (photolibraryd I'm aware the app needs in order to run properly at all, and so I'm not touching it).\nWhere I seem to be stuck is that their launching does not appear to respect launchctl disable. Indeed, launchctl print gui/$UID includes both daemons within the disabled services section, with the flag set to true, while neither are running, and the Photos app will still trigger these to be launched as soon as it is started. It isn't enabling them in launchd, as the flags remain unchanged when I check after testing by launching the Photos app.\nConsidering the possibility I was disabling them in the wrong launchd domain, I went on to try disabling them in the system domain, to no avail - launching Photos still starts these two services as soon as it starts.\nI also attempted to use the legacy launchctl unload -w pattern on the corresponding .plist file in /System/Library/LaunchAgents/, but was informed by launchctl in that case that the service could not be found.\nIn case some volatile state needed to be flushed or reloading done, I shut down and rebooted the system subsequent to ensuring that those services were flagged as disabled. They still returned as soon as the Photos app was launched.\nlaunchctl blame gui/$UID/cloudphotosd simply stated that the service was launched for xpc (mach), which doesn't really tell me much (the cross-process communication here is probably just the photos app launching the service).\nI'm wondering how to really disable these particular background processes, so that they cannot be launched by the Photos app, without out and out deleting them from the system or making other \"destructive\" changes. Or in other words, while I could probably simply find their actual executables and move them somewhere for archival, not being all that familiar with the functioning of launchd I'm curious as to whether there is a way working within its system to really forbid certain services from being launched. I thought that was launchctl disable... but it seems not, as that does not appear to have any effect in this instance.\nEDIT: Should clarify, this is on macOS 10.14/Mojave.\n\nA: Try running chmod -x on the binaries. This will prevent them from launching at all until you make them executable again.\nI don't know how SIP will affect this, since you're modifying built-in programs. You may have to disable it.\n\nA: This turns out to be unpleasant. I'm sorry to say that Apple really screwed this one up (and since it's obsolete, there won't be a permanent fix). The good news is that since it's obsolete, most of the fixes enumerated here and elsewhere are likely to keep working.\n\n*\n\n*First, if your system is insanely laggy because the photoanalysisd is running jobs over and over, doing nothing, you can just:\nsudo killall photoanalysisd\n\nThis will give you some breathing room so that you can actually access your disk. There, that's better, isn't it?\nIf that's not enough, you can always do a\nwhile true do sudo  killall photoanalysisd ; sleep 60 ; done\n\n\n*Permanent fixes all involve turning off System Integrity Protection (SIP), because the photo analysis daemon and its configuration are all under the protection of SIP. It's possible that a system update will reset to Apple defaults, but since your system is obsolete now, it's unlikely.\n\nSo, reboot into the Recovery console (reboot, hold R as the reboot occurs, and then open Terminal.\n    csrutil disable\n    shutdown -r now\n\nto turn off SIP, then reboot\nNow, all you have to do is to move the configuration file that tells launchd to start photoanalysisd to start.\n    cd /System/Library/LaunchAgents/\n    mkdir DISABLED\n    sudo mv com.apple.photoanalysisd.plist DISABLED\n    sync\n\nand then reboot into recovery mode, again by holding R during boot.\n    shutdown -r now\n\nhold down r\nopen terminal, and\ncsrutil enable\nshutdown -r now\nAnd now, photoanalysisd will not come up.\nSadly,\n\n\n*Notice that the plist for photoanalysisd has things like delay, whether or not to repeat, and so on. In my experimentation, none of them are used, because although launchd has these facilities, photoanalysisd appears to have its own idea of restarting to wait for work, and doesn't use the launchd facilities. SIGH. I suspect this is less of a big deal on APFS, but on HFS+, it doesn't have the metadata to do this efficiently, so the \"no big deal, tested and working on 'my machine'\" photoanalysisd is actually a disk bandwidth and cpu hog, doing nothing whatsoever after the initial classification is done.\n\nI would LOVE to know a way to start photoanalysisd only on demand, but the combination of SIP and no documented job protocol makes that hard without documentation. I even looked in the binary for strings that it might be looking for in commands, launchd properties, etc., but there's no documentation. If I ever upgrade my lovely tank of a 2009 iMac to an SSD, I'll see. That said, the hardware would still be SATA not NVMe, so the huge number of command channels that could make the disk interface so fast that it doesn't care won't be there.\nIf someone else has results, that would be great.\n\nA: Found a much easier solution that works on Monterey\n\n*\n\n*Disable the process using launchctl\nlaunchctl disable user/$UID/com.apple.photoanalysisd\n\n\n\n*Now kill the current Photoanalysisd process\n\nlaunchctl kill SIGTERM gui/$UID/com.apple.photoanalysisd\n\nand that should be it! Photoanalysisd should be disabled and no longer running in the background.\nTo re-enable it, run\nlaunchctl enable user/$UID/com.apple.photoanalysisd\nlaunchctl kickstart gui/$UID/com.apple.photoanalysisd\n\n", "Q: I can't install macOS Mojave because this copy of the Install macOS Mojave.app application is damaged I've been trying to upgrade my Mac from High Sierra to Mojave, but I keep getting the error below.\n\nI rang Apple support and they told me to wait a while and try downloading it again from the App Store.

Just try to download it again. That's all.\n\nA: It’s possible, but rare, for the network to corrupt very large downloads.  Try downloading at a different location, perhaps using wired Ethernet.  Or download the installer to a different Mac, and copy the data over to your Mac using an external HD.\n\nA: Is the machine connected to the internet? I had this error and entering my WiFi credentials to connect resolved it.\n\nA: After searching for how to fix this after I had erased my drive leaving me with no system, I have figured out how to fix it without having to download the installer again.\nWhat I did:\nWith a USB installer connected, restart your Mac and hold the Option key to get to your boot selection screen.\nSelect the Install MacOS Mojave option. \nDISCONNECT FROM THE INTERNET\nIf you do not disconnect, the system will update its clock from the servers.\n(read: THIS WILL NOT WORK IF CONNECTED TO INTERNET)\nAfter disconnecting, click on Utilities > Terminal to open the Terminal.app.\nIn the command line, navigate to the root directory with:\ncd /\n\nIn the root directory, list the contents.\nls\n\nYou should see the directory contents including Install MacOS Mojave.app. You need to find out the date of that file. Type:\nstat Install\\ MacOS\\ Mojave.app\n\n(The name may be different but make sure you use the one shown on your screen and don't forget to escape the spaces with a forward slash.)\nIt's likely that there is only the one file named like that so an easier way to get it is by typing:\nstat Install\n\nand hitting Tab to auto complete the filename. This should show some information of the file including a couple dates. You now want to set the date of your system to a date around when the installer was created therefore marking the certificate \"valid\". Lets say the date it was created was Mar 20, 13:45 2019. We will set the date to the day before, Mar 19, 13:45 2019. The format for setting the date is important and it is:\n[mm][dd][HH][MM][yyyy]\n\nNo spaces. A single long number. To change the date to Mar 19, 13:45 2019, use the date command.\ndate 031913452019\n\nConfirm the date change by running the date command alone.\nIf successful, quit Terminal to return back to the main screen and try installing again. It should work this time.\nWhen it gets to the stage of install asking you to enter your wifi or network information, it is okay now to do so as the installer has already been confirmed good.\nI hope this is able to help others stuck in a similar situation.\n", "Q: Exclude word(s) from App Store searches How can I exclude words from searches in iOS App Store?\nAn example query could be like this:\nmonopoly -bingo\nwould avoid matches with bingo from turning up in results when searching for monopoly.\nThis doesn't work.

Safari tells me the connection is not private. It appears their certificate expired 99 days ago. This seems like a long time for that to go on without the owners of the website upgrading their certificate. I just want to know if I should ignore this warning. I'm very hesitant to go there.\n\nA: According to sources that project has been \"essentially abandoned\" (nobody is working on it)\nSo, even if you download it, you are on your own with any problems that might occur.\nAs for accessing websites with expired certificate, you have been warned not to proceed, but you can at your own risk, witch could be major or minimal.\nIf you wish to proceed you can download the player from here \nJust tried that and it Opens fine on HighSierra \n", "Q: Freeing up space on external hard drive after deleting time machine backups? I had a external hard drive in use for Time machine, but now use a different one, so wanted to free up the space. I removed the HD from the Time machine backup drives, then deleted the Backups.backupdb folder on the external HD. Yet when I view the HD’s \"free space\", for example in Disk Utility, the drive is still completely full without having freed up the ~500GB the backups took.\nHow can I get that space to free up?\n\nA: After comments - it's odd that it didn't appear in Trash, but generally, Trash won't empty itself so after you throw anything out you need to empty it to free up the space.\nApple did add a \"Remove items from Trash after 30 days\" Finder pref in [I think] Sierra, but that wouldn't have helped in this instance.\n\n", "Q: Can I turn to Dark Mode only for specific apps in macOS Mojave? The new macOS Mojave Dark Mode function makes all of Apple's built-in apps get the Dark Mode treatment, that is Safari, Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Reminders, Notes, Maps, Photos, Messages, FaceTime, iTunes, Apple Books, etc.\nHowever, is it possible to selectively activate Dark Mode, i.e.,  only for a specific subset of apps? For instance, what if I want to keep Safari in Light Mode and turn Finder to Dark Mode instead? Am I somehow allowed to do that?\n\nA: There's a command that works for this:\ndefaults write <Bundle-Identifier> NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool yes\n\nIt's explained here: https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/exclude-app-dark-mode-macos-mojave/\nIf you don't know the app's bundle id, you can query it using AppleScript, which you can run from the command line with osascript:\nosascript -e 'id of app \"<App-Name>\"'\n\n\nA: EDIT:\nAs others have pointed out, this app seems no longer available.\n\nI've been using LightsOff for a couple of days now, seems to work very well.\nIt does \"switch\" between modes when you open an app that you have excluded and you can actually see the switching which is a bit of a downside.\n\nA: Shouldn't there be a new alternative for this command based on early betas (see below):\ndefaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode NSWindowDarkChocolate -bool true\n\nA: More free options include Gray app and NightOwl.

These look like normal jpegs but i don't understand the naming. What are these files?  They originally came from my iPhone.\n\nA: My research shows that images downloaded from Facebook always ends with “_n.jpg” !\nSo you must have downloaded them from Facebook to your phone. \niCloud then synced them with your Mac, unless you transferred them your self.\n", "Q: iOS 11 stuck in greyscale I pulled my phone out of my pocket today, and noticed that it was greyscale.\nI went into the accessibility options, and oddly, color filters are not turned on.  In checking some other things, I realized that the colors were inverted, too, but that wasn't selected.\nI've since turned on 'invert colors' so at least its a functional greyscale for images, but for the life of me, I can't figure out what happened.\nIt's an SE, still on iOS 11.  I was doing some tool maintenance in my driveway, so I was crouching down a lot and it's possible that it might have detected something on the touch screen, but my phone's set to lock with no grace period, so it's unlikely.  I had my home button set to smart invert on three presses, but that wasn't actually on.\nAnyone have a clue what I might've done and/or how to fix it?\n\nA: I guess I gave up too quickly when I mostly found web pages only talking about how to turn it on.  A few more minutes of searching found https://www.payetteforward.com/why-is-my-iphone-black-and-white-heres-the-real-fix/ and reading all the way to the bottom.\nI don't know how it happened, but 'zoom filter' was set to greyscale & invert colors, and the filter was being applied even when things weren't zoomed in.  (and I wouldn't have set it, as I use zoom for lots of things)\nBut it seems to use a different mechanism than the other accessibility options, so you can't disable it from there, you have to go into the zoom settings.\n", "Q: Mac calendar app (iCal) displays error message \"server responded with an error\" After upgrading to Mojave, the mac calendar app displays the following error when starting the app.\n\"server responded with an error\"\nIs this a problem with Mojave and the gmail server?

You can find detailed instructions online, but the main points are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your iCalendar data, particularly if you have locally stored data.\n\n*Delete cache files in /Users/$USER/Library/Calendars/ -- basically files with the word \"Cache\" in the title; there were 3 or 4 files when I did it.\n\n*Open iCalendar and reconnect.\n\n\nNote: This persistent error seemed to start for me when I was performing a Calendar action and had a hard network failure while the action was in progress.\n\nA: I tried the answers posted here with no success. But seems that what have made the Calendar work again, was removing the accounts from the Internet Accounts, restarting the system, and then adding them again.\nThe entire process was a sum of of the answers here, plus the accounts removal. It was something like this:\n\n*\n\n*Quit Calendar, and kill the CalendarAgent process;\n\n*Delete the \"Cache\" files from ~/Library/Calendars;\n\n*Go to Internet Accounts, disable everything;\n\n*Restart the laptop;\n\n*Go to Internet Accounts again, and remove all accounts;\n\n*Restart the laptop;\n\n*Go to Internet Account for the third time, and add back all your accounts;\n\n*Restart the laptop;\n\n*Hopefully Calendar will be working again as mine did and is still doing.\n\nNote 1: Before this whole process, I also tried to delete every file from the ~/Library/Calendars, and that didn't help anything.\nNote 2: all my accounts are Google accounts and I didn't backup anything. I have no iCloud or local calendars.\n\nA: By deleting all Cache files in the Calendar Libraries (in Catalina), I compromised the software and now iCal no longer runs. I used Terminal cuz I didn't see files via Finder.

It worked fine with High Sierra but after update its not working.I am using the pre installed apache and not using third party apps like xampp\n\nA: The Mojave update (or re-install) overwrites the apache directory but left my old configs with the ~previous suffix left.\nI did edit a lot of previous files in my apache path /private/etc/apache2. These files were renamed to like httpd.conf~previous and a new httpd.conf has taken place. \nI just renamed files, restart my apache and everything is working like before now. It wasn't every previous file, as i knew i did not edited all of them.\nIn my case also the /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf~previous had to get back in place\n\nA: I had the same problem after I updated to Big Sur.\nIn my case the configuration files from the apache2 folder were supposedly 'incompatible with the recent macOS upgrade'.\nBecause of that Apple moved my httpd.conf and httpd-vhosts.conf to\n/Users/Shared/Relocated Items\n\nI just had to copy them over to the old location and everything worked again.\n\nA: I had the same problem - it's based on mod_userdir exclusion after updating to Mac OS X Mojave. There are a few steps to repair that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Load the module mod_userdir in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\n*At the end of the httpd.conf make sure to load httpd-userdir.conf\n\n*In httpd-userdir.conf include a local file in /etc/apache2/users/<username>.conf\n\n*Put a directory section into that file, containing the rules for the directory where your webserver files are located:\n<Directory \"/Users/<myusername>/Sites/\">\n    AllowOverride All\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n    Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\nThis should set you up.\n\nA: Apache\nThe new macOS Mojave comes with Apache pre-installed.

How do I find out what I allowed (and block it again if needed)? I just upgraded to Mojave, and all went well. When the system restarted, I was shown the name of an application or extension that was being blocked from loading, and I mistakenly authorized it to load. I didn't get a chance to read the name and don't know what it is. How can I figure it out?\n\nA: It will depend on precisely what permission it was requesting - though note for future reference you're going to see a lot of these with Mojave, so get into the habit of reading carefully; even to the extent of researching exactly what it is you're allowing before clicking either option. Some apps will never ask again & then you may lose functionality.\nGenerally, these allowed apps are listed in System Prefs > Security & Privacy > Privacy & then whichever subsection they requested permission for. [I think] The two new options in there since Mojave are Full Disk Access & Automation.\nI don't know of any way to determine the date the permission was granted.\n\nOf course, once identified, there is a simple checkbox to allow/disallow.\n", "Q: Are notifications lost forever during scheduled DnD in iOS12? In iOS12, notifications do not appear on are locked screen while scheduled do not disturb is in effect. This is a new feature, and I can understand the reason it has been introduced.\nIs there any way to view the history of notifications that would have occurred during this time. If one opens the notification screen (by swiping down), notifications that occurred before and after the do not disturb period are visible, but nothing in between.\nIn previous versions, notifications could be used to view important news flash events that occurred overnight. Is there a method to view these missing notifications or perhaps modify the new behaviour.\n\nUpdate:\nI don't know why there were no overnight notifications the first time I used scheduled DnD after updating to iOS12 - maybe CNN had nothing to say for 8 hours. But it seems to be working as documented now. Both with Bedtime Mode enabled and without.\n\nA: Source:\nIf you set a scheduled Do Not Disturb time (as many of us do during our normal sleeping hours), you’ll have the option to toggle Bedtime Mode for those hours. \nRegular Do Not Disturb mode silences calls and notifications. When it’s active, sounds and vibrations won’t wake you up (or disturb your dinner companion, or make noise in the movie theater), but they’ll still appear on the lock screen.\nBedtime Mode adds two new behaviors to Do Not Disturb. \n\n\n*\n\n*It dims the display considerably, so if you pick up your phone in a dark room—to check the time, for example—it won’t blind you with bright light.\n\n*It sends incoming notifications straight to the notification history, skipping the lock screen entirely.\n\n\nTo enable Bedtime Mode, tap on Settings -> Do Not Disturb and be sure you have scheduled Do Not Disturb turned on.  Then switch on Bedtime Mode. \n \n", "Q: Is there a way to validate that an apple update is legitimate? I have reason to suspect that somebody may have had unauthorized access to my computer. I've just reset my copy of OS X from the recovery partition. Afterwards, I was prompted twice to update my OS via the App Store. One of these I may have selected through a notification; the second I selected through the App Store. I'm now on 10.13.6.\nIs there a way now to make sure both of these updates were legitimately provided by Apple? \nRelatedly, if somebody wanted to install malware of some kind into the recovery partition of my MacBook, is there any way either to scan and remove that or to replace that portion of the hard drive with a legitimate version of the partition?\n\nA: On other software updates (and for not having any doubt about the legit of them) sudo through terminal. \nTo install all available software updates, instead use the command sudo softwareupdate -i -a. The -a switch simply instructs the command to install all updates. Again, you’ll need to enter your admin password when prompted.\nThere’s no traditional progress bar, but you will see updated text entries in the Terminal window as each step is completed, letting you know both when certain updates have been downloaded and when the entire installation process is complete.\nIf you installed software updates that require a reboot, you’ll see a final message instructing you to restart your Mac. You can do this via the normal macOS interface, but since we’re already using UNIX commands in Terminal, you can also type sudo shutdown -r now, which instructs shutdown command to restart the Mac (“-r”) immediately (“now”).\n", "Q: macOS Mojave Beach Ball when saving a file When I'm trying to save or select a file in a web browser, or any other application the beachball appears and the app hangs for ±30 seconds.\nI didn't have this problem in High Sierra. Is it a common bug or specific to my hardware?\nI have MacBook Pro Retina 15 2014 \n\nA: Found it. SMC reset didn't fix it. It's an iCloud issue. One solution is to remove the iCloud tab from the finder sidebar through Finder->Preferences->Sidebar.\nIt's not perfect, but at least productivity is back. I hope they will run an update that will solve this.\nPeter\n\nA: I have the same setup and had the exact same problem, which I somehow got resolved. Now I'm not sure what exactly worked out of everything I tried, but here's the list:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled dynamic wallpaper\n\n*SMC/PRAM reset\n\n*Checked login items and deleted a few (had for example Magnet and BetterSnapTool both starting on login and also some other weird processes)\n\n\nGood luck finding the culprit.\n", "Q: What are “Pickups” in the Screen Time report? In Screen Time introduces in iOS 12, part of the report is a graph for “Pickups”. What are these?\n\n\nA: It’s the number of times that you have picked up the device to explicitly interact with it. The following interactions count:\n\n\n*\n\n*accelerometer \n\n*screen unlock\n\n*hey Siri \n\n\nA: The Verge says that pickup counting is triggered “when you’ve interacted with the device or on-screen content in some way. If all you do is turn on the screen, that’s not enough to get tallied.”\nIf you’re looking for first-party confirmation, it seems like (for now) there’s nothing useful from Apple. The only mentions of Screen Time pickups on their website describe it simply as “how many times a device was picked up,” or slight rewordings of that phrase. The WWDC 2018 keynote and Apple Support video on Screen time are similarly unhelpful.\n(There were a dozen other tech blogs and websites that I also looked at, but all of them gave the same information as Apple, or less.)\n\nA: It must be the time that the display is turned on because it is telling me that I got pickups in the middle of the night while I was asleep which was probably me getting notifications and the notifications turning my phone's display on.\n", "Q: Can you distribute an iOS app outside App Store using a single bundle identifier? Is there a way to distribute an iOS application to customers with a single bundle identifier outside App Store?\nThe software firm I work for is providing iPad software to several large companies. Right now we're using the Apple Developer Enterprise Program.\nEach of these companies receive an IPA file with their own bundle id e.g. com.SuperApp.FirstCustomer, com.SuperApp.SecondCustomer. The companies install and manage our software using their own Mobile Device Management (MDM) system.\nA 3rd-party component we would like to use in our software, PSPDFKit, is a lot more expensive if each of our customers have a dedicated bundle ID.\nWe don't want to distribute our software through App Store, we just want to send the IPA files directly to our customers – and our customers also prefer this way of the app distribution.\n\nA: You should not be using an Enterprise Program membership in this way. The Enterprise Program should only be used to distribute apps to devices owned by the enterprise member company I.e. your company's devices. \nYou can use a regular organisational Apple a Developer membership to distribute a B2B to your client organisations. \nYou use App Store Connect as for a normal App Store app, but in the pricing and availability section you make it a private app and list the Apple Business Manager organisation IDs that are permitted to access the app. \nAs well as being \"the right way\", B2B apps are lifetime signed like any other App Store app; you don't need to worry about refreshing distribution profiles and signing certificates periodically. \nThere is a great WWDC 2019 session that covers this. \n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts (spacebar) no longer works in Photos on Mojave Until recently, pressing spacebar toggled expanding my photos in Photos, and single keys provided a way to edit photos (e.g. C for crop). None of these features now work for me.\nHow do I restore keyboard shortcuts in Photos?\n\nA: Since MacOS Mojave, Photos have changed shortcuts. I used Space key very extensively, so made work again (link):\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to preferences > keyboard > shortcuts > app shortcuts > Photos > and add a shortcut. \n\n*For Menu Title enter \"Open Viewer\" and for the keyboard shortcut press the spacebar whilst holding the Fn key. \n\n*Add another one for \"Close Viewer\"\n\n*Add another one for \"Open/Close Viewer\"\n\n*Now open Photos, go to Library/Photos, select single photo and click on menu \"Image\" - check if Open Viewer shows \"Space\" \n\n*Press Spacebar and enjoy :)\n\n\nAlso few useful shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*cmd+Enter - edit mode\n\n*cmd+1 - in edit mode Adjust\n\n*cmd+3 - in edit mode Crop\n\n*. - make photo favorite\n\n\nAlso check cmd+1-4 and ctrl+1-6 in photos view mode :)\nAnd desert: All Photos keyboard shortcuts for Mojave\n\nA: This is fixed in macOS 10.14.4 (Photo 4.0): spacebar now opens images and keyboard shortcuts work for editing.\n", "Q: App store says I have recently updated High Sierra but appears I'm still on Mavericks? Yesterday I downloaded and thought I installed Sierra after being told of the available update, spending more than an hour downloading and then restarting.\nI had to resign in to a few apps, e.g. Google back up and sync so it looks like something did change.\nBefore I made the update, if I navigated to Apple menu > About this Mac I would see the exact same screen that I see now, here it is:\n\n10.9.5 appears to be Mavericks. From Google search:\n\nUnder Apple menu > App store > Updates, I see that Sierra was installed recently:\n\nAm I actually on Sierra right now or am I still on Mavericks?\n\nA: The App Store screen only say what you have downloaded, not installed. \nCheck if the download file is still on your hard drive named \"Install macOS High Sierra\" in your applications folder. \nIf Yes double click on it and it will start.\nOnce the install was successful the install file will self destruct.\nBecause of that I usually make a copy of it before it self destruct, so I can create a bootable USB later (when I have time for it). = Procrastinating :)\n", "Q: How to update Xcode?

But there are reportedly fixes in Intel processor microcode (some in cooperation with some OS fixes) which make some of these side-channel attacks more difficult and/or slower.\n", "Q: Connecting Scarlett 2i2 to mixer I want to set up my MacBook to do the following:\n-Acquire input from a Scarlett 2i2 audio interface;\n-Process the signal using Bias Amp or Amplitube (or some other softwares for Guitar);\n-Send it to a mixer which is connected to power speakers;\nI simply don't know which way I should connect the Scarlett 2i2 interface to send the processed signal to the mixer.\n\nA: To connect the sound card with the amplifier you have to use two jack to jack cable with diameter 6.35 mm.\nThe type of the cables should be with three pole to carry balanced signals (but it works either with two pole cables).\nThe connection must be made from the lines output placed on the rear of the audio interface to the input of a power amplifier or a mixer. \n", "Q: How to get Tx-Power of wifi adapter in MacOS? In linux there is a command called iwconfig which shows Tx-Power in its output. How to measure antenna power in MacOS? \nThe airport utility in mac just shows the datarate and not the power in db. \nI want to see the current Tx-power value. I do not want to change it or mess with it. I know that it changes dynamically according to the Region or other factors, but how to monitor the current value?\n\nA: The Tx- Power is coded in to Firmware and has a maximum allowed by law. (FCC in the US)\nApple did offer the possibility to change the Tx-Power in its older version of Airport utility Ver 5.6\n\nYou can download it and try.\nThe 802.11n (5th Generation) - Airport Extreme card is set to\n20 dBm (nominal) Output Power.\n\nThe iwconfig does not actually report the output power of the antenna. That is not possible. An antenna can not measure its own output, but a secondary antenna can. The iwconfig power output is a misnomer, it reports the power going in to the circuit that powers the antenna.  \n", "Q: broken partition table after formatting drive with apple file system (apfs) I wanted to try out apfs, therefore I formatted my external HDD with it. Now the partition table seems broken. How can I reinitialize the drive?\nMy goal is two create two HFS+ partitions, each 1TB on the drive. I decided to wait with migration to APFS as it is not supported by all my devices.\nSee attached screenshots the 2TB HDD shows up as a 4TB drive?\n\n\nThe drive is a Seagate FireCuda Compute 2TB, SATA 6Gb/s (ST2000LX001)\n\nA: I've done this, on an SSD at least.\nProbably on your drive right now there's some kind of corruption going on; I'd bet that Untitled and CRE are sharing the same UUID... I've had that happen with some interesting results.\nIf you want two partitions, with one as APFS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reformat the whole disk, creating two partitions - the one you want to be APFS should be formatted as HFS+.\n\n*Once that's done, format the HFS+ volume as APFS. That will create a container, and then the final volume will be inside that.\nIn the pictures, you can see I have three partitions. In the first image, it's apparent that there are four volumes, and the two under \"Container disk1\" are APFS. \nIf you want two APFS volumes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reformat the whole disk - that the disk level, as in disky, not disky1 - with one HFS+ partition. You could go straight to APFS but I think this will prevent potential issues...\n\n*Format the whole disk as APFS. You should then have a three level tree - disk, container, and volume.\n\n*Now you can create your second APFS volume. Select the \"Container\" disk, click on the \"Edit\" menu in the menu bar, and click \"Add APFS volume.\" That will create what behaves as a second partition, but it will share available disk space with the first APFS volume.\n\n\nYou can set minimum and maximum sizes for the volumes too if you like.\n\n\n", "Q: Unable to add Google account (G Suite) to Mail.app While adding a new Google account (G Suite account) to Mail.app (Mac OS High Sierra, 10.13.6), I am able to authenticate successfully but the account is never added to Mail.app. It remains stuck at the screen shown below:\n\nAppreciate any help on this issue.\n\nA: I found a solution myself.

I've just upgraded from High Sierra to Mojave. I have a Lacie Porsche USB-C drive that I use for Time Machine backups. In High Sierra when I ejected the drive, it would power off and I could safely unplug it. However, now it doesn't spin down and I can't safely unplug.

I previously had High Sierra installed on my Macbook Air, but for some reason, at one point when I tried to boot up my mac, it showed a folder with a question mark sign that kept flashing. Luckily for me, I was about to upgrade to macOS Mojave, so I had a bootable disk with Mojave on it. I created a new volume on the existing Container in recovery mode, installed Mojave on it and copied out files from the corrupted High Sierra Volume.\nNow, I had previously read on some articles and forums that the way to move keychains manually to a new mac was to navigate to ~/Library/Keychains/ and copy out the login keychain, but I found out that Wifi passwords were stored on the System keychain in Keychain Access, so I navigated to /Library/Keychains/ and copied out System.keychain along with the login keychain from the user folder and I deleted the volume.\nComing to my Mojave and opening up the High Sierra's System.keychain in Keychain access, I found that I was unable to copy the Airport passwords to my main Mojave System keychain because it was requesting for the High Sierra's System.keychain password. This is puzzling, because I already was able to unlock the High Sierra's System.keychain with my Mojave user password which by the way is the same as my previous High Sierra user password.\nYet, when I select all the Airport passwords in the High Sierra's System.keychain and try to paste them in Mojave's System keychain, I get shown this: \nTyping in the correct password doesn't work, the pop up window just jiggles to show that the password is incorrect. I don't know what else to do, as I have quite a lot of Wifi passwords. Please, any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: I believe that in Mojave you cannot simply copy the keychain file. I found the best solution to be to sync the keychain in iCloud. This assumes that you have access to \nboth machines.\nGo to system preferences -> ICloud. Select Keychain.\nRepeat this on the second machine.\nYour keychains should now be transferred.\n", "Q: \"brew install python3\" fails to compile pyexpat brew install python3 fails with a pyexpat error, which means the installed Python can't parse XML (breaking pip etc).

Mojave corrupted my partition table, unusable MBP It's a long post, but I am listing everything I have done so far.\nI performed an upgrade to Mojave (day one release from App store), the app installed and I ran through the setup steps, I left it running unattended as it was ‘52 minutes remaining’ I came back to a ‘Disk management error’ (I did not catch the error number at the time), I restarted the machine, and since that point it boots to the Apple logo and the progress bar reaches about ~75% complete before turning into the prohibited symbol. \nStupid mistake on my part is not

Most people complained that whenever they had iTunes playing in the background and they played any sort of media, usually a video in Safari and they tried to pause iTunes so they could watch the video, they found out that the media keys interacted with the video instead of iTunes. Apparently this was a High Sierra feature that enabled the media keys to be used to control any media playing system wide.\nIn my own case, it was worse, the media keys couldn't control iTunes at all, even while I was in the iTunes application and I tried to pause a song or go to the next one, it wouldn't work AT ALL. Multiple restarts never fixed this. I don't even use Safari usually for browsing, I use other browsers and the media key doesn't control media that plays in them. Anyways I fixed the problem with High Sierra media key enabler application that everyone seemed to be using, unfortunately it couldn't work with bluetooth devices which I use often, only physical media keys, so if I had to interact with iTunes I always had to reach for my computer.\nFast forward to me installing Mojave, I did a clean install to avoid this problem in Mojave. I was delighted at first when I booted up Mojave, pressed the play button, iTunes started up, and I added my songs and found out that the media key controls them fine. I usually use the iTunes widget in the Notification centre a lot and was unhappy to find that it was nowhere to be found in Mojave, only the \"Now playing\" widget, and I soon discovered that this annoying feature followed me to Mojave. Using quick look (pressing spacebar) to preview a video, if I tried to pause iTunes so I could watch the video, I found that the video instead was being controlled. Usually I would swipe into the Notification Centre and pause iTunes from the widget, but imagine my surprise when I found out that the \"Now playing\" widget was showing controls for the quick look video. This is quite infuriating.\nThe situation has now escalated. My media keys no longer control iTunes at all, even when I'm actively in iTunes trying to control a playing song, nothing happens. And even worse, the Now playing widget shows nothing:\nIt shows that when an iTunes song is actively playing. Now I have to go into iTunes and click the next buttons to change a song. I would have loved for this to work properly as High Sierra media key enabler doesn't work with bluetooth controls.\nNow, whenever I restart and I press the play button, iTunes starts up, pressing play again in iTunes does absolutely nothing. I would have to press spacebar to start a song playing. When I leave iTunes and continue doing something else and try to change the song, of course nothing happens and the Now playing widget is empty. But then after using my laptop for a while, I then notice the media buttons start to work again, when I check the notification centre, the Now playing widget shows the playing song. \nIt almost seems to me as if the Now playing widget determines what the media keys control and what it doesn't and it also seems it takes a while to pick/catch the current playing song. I use iTunes for basically most of the day and if anyone has any solution other than High Sierra media key enabler, I would really appreciate it.\nP.S I use a Macbook Air 2014 model.\n\nA: I went through almost exactly what you went through. I fully reinstall Mojave with no luck, so just downloaded the Media Key Forwarder (note: it's no longer called Media Key Enabler). I recommend it until Apple fixes their 'unified play'/'Now playing' mess.\n\nUpdate\nBoot into safe mode (hold shift as you press the power button, or click here for instructions). Start iTunes and the play buttons should work, then reboot normally and enjoy life.\n", "Q: How do I do a clean install of macOS Mojave? I follow instructions and installed macOS Mojave on my MacBook Air. The update installed and when I try to use the new software, to my surprise, every 2 minutes the screen was frozen.\nI am using Mac since I was 18 years old and I am 50 now. I know macOS and the use of software very well.\nI have created a USB macOS Mojave installer and tried clean install. To my surprise it got me nowhere. I tried recovery from Internet with no luck. I partition the hard drive to journal but with no luck again.\n\nA: Make sure first that your hardware is compatible with Mojave - macOS 10.14. Some sources to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://osxdaily.com/2018/06/05/macos-mojave-compatible-macs-list/\n\n*https://www.cnet.com/how-to/here-are-the-macs-that-will-work-with-macos-mojave/\nTo do a clean install of Mojave:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a usb install drive following these instructions.\n\n*Back up your system drive in triplicate, or whatever you're comfortable with. Ideally one would be a literal clone of your system.\n\n*Boot from the USB drive, and erase your system drive in Disk Utility. Format it as HFS+.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility, and install Mojave on the drive you erased.\n\n\nIf those steps don't work, I would suspect a hardware incompatibility or problem.\n", "Q: Why does Apple Music say that my student email is in use when trying to switch to a student account? I'm on the individual Subscription for Apple music right now. When I try switching to a student account (I'm eligible), it tells me that my student email is still in use. I might have used that email before, because a few months ago I got a new iPhone. \nIf I cancel my individual subscription and then try to sign into my student email, will I lose all my music?\n\nA: It sounds like you have two Apple ID’s. Close the one with your student account and add/change the email on your personal account. Use “forgot password” with your student email to get into your student account if you don’t know the password.\nBTW, r/AppleMusic says you have 90 days to pause a subscription without losing your data:\n\nYour library is kept on the server for 90 days - meaning, as long as\n  you restart your Apple Music 90 days of the previous subscription\n  coming to an end, you'll get all your library back.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to have audio follow window across multiple displays I'm using multiple monitors and would like to have the audio from any particular app window come from the speakers associated with the display where the app window is shown.\nAnyone know of a solution?\nThis is iMac Pro or MacBook Pro running Mojave. It would be any application that produces sound. I would like the sound directed to the display upon which the app's window is displayed.\n\nA: This is not possible.\nApple does not \"link\" audio devices and video devices in any way.  As far as macOS is concerned, you have discrete audio devices and discrete video (display) devices.  In fact, you cannot even control audio from a Mac connected via HDMI or DisplayPort\nSome Apps (i.e. Vox Music Player) allows you to select a different audio device from the default.  If the App you're using (Safari for example) is playing a YouTube video, it would have to be able to be \"aware\" of the other audio devices (it's not).\nYour app would not only have to be aware of the additional audio devices but the location of it's Window in relation to the monitor it's connected to.  It's highly unlikely app programmers would include that functionality.\n", "Q: macOS Automator run Expect Script How do I run a expect script in macOS Automator?\n\nAs it is possible to see in the picture, there is no such option\nits a script of type:\n!/usr/bin/expect\n\nA: expect can be called from an Automator action but it must be indirect.\nWithin your Automator Run Shell Script action, call out to expect with something like:\n#!/bin/sh\nexpect -f /absolute/path/to/expect/script\n\n", "Q: What does a .dmg verify? Whenever I open a .dmg, my computer says that it is Verifying… for a moment.  I'm just curious as to what it is doing at this time.  Is it running a checksum, checking if it is the same as the online version, etc.?\n\nA: In most cases, your computer is just doing a checksum, to make sure the Apple Disk Image, .dmg, hasn't been corrupted due to a flakey network connection or hard drive, or from bit-rot, etc. This can let you know about a problem early on, so you don't waste time troubleshooting a bad copy of an app.\nDevelopers also have the ability to codesign .dmg's (thanks @graham-miln), in which case, this signature will also be verified.\n", "Q: Upgrade to MacOS Mojave is stuck at calculating I am downloading MacOS Mojave.

Then, since my diskutil list wouldn't even complete, and Disk Utility wouldn't even show the card, after waiting a long time (e.g. 5-10 mins), it did eventually show up in Disk Utility.\nI ended up succeeding by (when it finally showed up) \"repair filesystem\" on the only partition it had, and then, and only then would Disk Utility allow me to unmount that partition, leading me to finally erase the drive. diskutil list finally showed the drive and my dd command started working again.\n", "Q: How can I enable backspace to go back in Safari on Mojave?

I then started to see red pixels appearing on the same line as the top menubar. It happens very rarely, but has already occurred about 4 times per week. Pixels disappear if you move any window. I noticed this while using Firefox and iTerm.\nCould it be an issue with hardware (dead pixels) or software (Mojave dark theme)?\n\n\nA: Update:\nThis bug is potentially fixed in macOS 11 Big Sur. The bug report I filed is now marked as:\n\nPotential fix identified - In macOS 11\n\nOne commenter, Curtis Hard, has stated the issue no longer happens for them with Big Sur.\nIt's unclear if the fix will be backported to 10.15 or 10.14.\n\nIt's definitely not a dead-pixel issue. I've determined it's probably a software bug introduced in Mojave and still present in Catalina. I'm not able to screenshot the glitch in most cases (the glitch will typically immediately disappear), but I have managed to capture it on a couple of videos and screenshots.\nThe fact that it can be captured in software and the fact that the cursor can cover over the glitched pixels indicates the issue is not in the screen but happening in software.\nExamples:\nFirefox\nHere's a screenshot from a screen recording of Firefox, where you can see the grey pixels.\n\nInterestingly, if we zoom in a bit, we can see the pixels are actually outside the window itself.\n\nFinder\nI've also captured similar glitches happening in Apple's own Finder on regular screenshots.\n\n\nNotes:\nSome interesting things to note about it.\n\n*\n\n*I've only seen it happen against dark areas of a window.\n\n*It can happen in both light mode and dark mode (if the window is dark anyway).\n\n*It mostly happens at the edge of a window (where the shadow is), though I have seen it on the inside of some.\n\n*It often (but not always) disappears when window focus changes, among other things (window focus changing causes window shadows to change).\n\n*\n\n*I've been able to change focus to and from an iTerm window with no shadow (when transparency is enabled), and the glitch outside the bottom edge of the window persisted.\n\n\n\n*It can be captured with QuickTime Player's Screen Recording feature.\n\n*Mysteriously, though it can be capture with QuickTime, it is invisible to Apple's developer tool Pixie, as seen in this screen recording. Likewise, the Digital Color Meter app does not see it either.\n\n*I've seen it mostly in grey and red, but also green, yellow, and more colors.\n\n*The glitch can happen even when Finder is not running, so it's not a part of Finder.\n\n*Running killall Dock while SSH'd into a machine displaying the glitch may cause it to stop, though this may just be a side-effect of shadow changes.\n\n*I tried suspending all the Firefox processes (firefox + plugin-container processes) over SSH with kill -SIGSTOP while the glitch was happening and the glitch continued to blink, further indicating the glitch is happening outside the Firefox processes.\n\n*Going further, I tried systematically suspending processes over SSH, to see which one might be responsible. The only one suspending causes the flashing to freeze with was WindowServer.\n\n*Using the Quartz Debug developer tool (one of the Xcode addition tools, mentioned here), I tested some of the options it had. When the \"Disable 2D Acceleration\" option was enabled, I was unable to reproduce the glitch like I could when it was disabled. The Autoflush drawing and Vertical Sync options had no effect.\n\n*It seems to only happen with the integrated graphics card. I have not been able to reproduce it while the discrete card is active.\n\n*So far I've only heard reports of it happening on recent MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models. I was unable to reproduce this issue on a previous generation MacBook Air running the same OS version.\n\n*I've not yet seen it happen in a Mojave VM using VMware Fusion, further indicating it only happens with certain hardware.\n\n*To remove all variables, I tried running a clean install of Mojave 10.14.1 on an external drive. With all default settings, I was quickly able to reproduce it Light Mode with Firefox 63.0.1 with the dark theme and dark developer tools theme enabled and the console open (screen recording).\n\n*Browser-like applications appear especially likely to trigger it (ie. Firefox and Electron-based apps).\n\n*Applications I've seen it with (I've probably forgotten some):\n\n*\n\n*Firefox (especially versions < 70)\n\n*\n\n*Top edge (requires dark Firefox theme)\n\n*Bottom edge (requires dark bottom of window from open search bar with dark theme, dev tools with dark theme, or dark web page content). Also done on a clean 10.14.1 install.\n\n\n\n*Atom (may require Settings > Core > Title Bar > custom)\n\n*\n\n*Top edge\n\n*Bottom edge\n\n\n\n*Discord\n\n*\n\n*Bottom edge\n\n*Inside window\n\n\n\n*iTerm (with a black, semi-transparent background; it does not seem to happen with an opaque background)\n\n*\n\n*Top edge\n\n*Bottom edge\n\n*Inside window (at the bottom edge of one pane with split panes)\n\n\n\n*Finder\n\n*\n\n*Top edge\n\n*Inside window (tab bar)\n\n\n\n*Activity Monitor\n\n*\n\n*Top edge\n\n\n\n*Disk Utility\n\n*\n\n*Top edge\n\n\n\n*Console\n\n*\n\n*Inside window (over the transparent column headers)\n\n\n\n*Mail\n\n*\n\n*Inside window (over the transparent column headers)\n\n\n\n*Archive Utility\n\n*\n\n*Top edge\n\n\n\n*Hex Fiend\n\n*\n\n*Top edge\n\n\n\n*Google Chrome (when using macOS dark mode)\n\n*\n\n*Inside window at chrome://downloads/ under light grey horizontal line of top menu bar)\n\n\n\n\n\n*I've also seen it happen once at the bottom edge of the drop-down menus from the top menu bar.\n\n*The selection of apps and places I've seen it with make me suspicious it may in some way be window transparency related.\n\nThings that have no impact on the glitch (tested with Firefox):\n\n*\n\n*Doing a clean install of 10.14.1.\n\n*Resetting PRAM.\n\n*Resetting SMC.\n\n*Open the app in low resolution mode.\n\n*System Preferences:\n\n*\n\n*Display resolution scaling.\n\n*Display color profile.\n\n*Night Shift.\n\n*System accent color.\n\n*Auto-hiding dock.\n\n*Accessibility > Display > Use grayscale\n\n*Accessibility > Display > Invert colors\n\n\n\nHardware:\nI've only heard claims of it affecting different MacBook Pro models from 2016+ and the 2018+ MacBook Air (the models with USB Type-C). If you are seeing this issue on another Apple computer model, or don't have this issue on one of the affected models, I would be interested to hear about it.\nConclusion:\nUnfortunately, I don't think there is any way to prevent this glitch at this point, aside from forcing the use of the discrete card if your computer has one (and you don't mind the reduced battery life), but hopefully it will be resolved in a future update.\nEven more unfortunate, it still has not been fixed in any version from 10.14.0 through 10.14.6 or the second supplemental update since, and remains unfixed in the first supplemental update for 10.15.7. A comment from Curtis Hard confirms it was still present in the Big Sur betas at the time (it would be great if someone could confirm or deny it exists in newer builds).\nI filed a bug report on bugreport.apple.com (not public, but 46079638), which has been marked as a duplicate of 45841204. I don't have access to that bug report, but thought I would mention it in case anyone wants to reference it.\nOn a side note, there's a good change Apple's future ARM-based computers won't have this issue since they won't have the Intel integrated GPU's. That won't fix the issue for existing Intel computers though.\nFirefox 70+:\nSince Firefox 70 it doesn't happen as often as it did before, though it still does happen. I suspect this is related to some improvements that reduce the amount of screen drawing.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\nI've had the best luck reproducing the bug with Firefox.\n\n*\n\n*Open Firefox (63.0.1 in my case)\n\n*Set Firefox theme to Dark\n\n*\n\n*View > Toolbars > Customize... > Themes > Dark\n\n\n\n*Navigate to a page like http://example.com/\n\n*Open developer tools\n\n*\n\n*Tools > Web Developer > Inspector\n\n\n\n*Set developer tools theme to dark\n\n*\n\n*In the top right, click ... > Settings > Themes > Dark\n\n\n\n*Click the Inspector tab\n\n*Open the console\n\n*\n\n*In the top right, click ... > Show Split Console\n\n\n\n*Ensure the developer tools covers the bottom of the window\n\n*\n\n*If it doesn't, in the top right, click ... > Dock to Bottom\n\n\n\n*Reload the page until the glitch happens\n\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*Bugzilla: Colored Artifacts Appear Above Tab Bar with OS X Mojave in Dark Mode\n\n*MacRumors: Weird Issue Red pixels on Mojave Dark Mode\n\n*Reddit: Red dot blinking between the head bar and the firefox window on Mac.[...]\n\n*Reddit: Anyone else dealing with screen glitches on Mojave?\n\n*Reddit: MBP15 2018 Intel GPU artifact\n\n*Reddit: Flickering pixels above Firefox title bar — macOS\n\n*Reddit: Graphic Glitches when watch Netflix, anyone know about this?\nPossibly loosely related: Avoid using a transparent surface by using CoreAnimation (if my suspicion that it is transparency related is correct, that change may eventually have an impact on this bug happening with Firefox, if only by avoiding the OS bug).\nNote: If you have any info to share but don't have an account here, you can contact me here.\n\nA: This is very much a software issue. It’s reproducable on two different MacBook models running Mojave and two different LG USB-C type displays for me. \nDon’t seek hardware repair or reinstall your os if this is your only symptom. Updating software when available is advised since this could be a bug that will get patched.  \n\nA: It's June 30, 2020, and I still see this issue. I have a month-old MacBook Pro 16\" running Catalina 10.15.5 with AMD GPU and latest Firefox.  Still see red \"dots\" along the top border of the Firefox window. If I move the window, they stop. For a while. Then they're back, blinking like lights on towers. 5-10 at a time. It's always along the window border(s).\n\nA: Partial solution for me currently is to put the affected apps into fullscreen mode.\n", "Q: macOS Bluetooth menu bar show BLE Devices My Bluetooth menu (the one in the menu bar) do not show the Bluetooth Low Energy devices, from example my Razer mouse, it just shows up if I alt/option + click the icon.\nDoes anyone know how can I make the menu show all Low Energy Bluetooth devices in the menu bar?\n\nA: This is expected behavior.\nBLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices aren't broadcasting at all times like classic Bluetooth devices, they respond to \"advertising packets\" sent by the scanning device (your Mac).\n\nBLE devices are detected through a procedure based on broadcasting\n  advertising packets. This is done using 3 separate channels\n  (frequencies), in order to reduce interference. The advertising device\n  sends a packet on at least one of these three channels, with a\n  repetition period called the advertising interval. For reducing the\n  chance of multiple consecutive collisions, a random delay of up to 10\n  milliseconds is added to each advertising interval. The scanner\n  listens to the channel for a duration called the scan window, which is\n  periodically repeated every scan interval.\n\nWhen you hold Option while clicking on the Bluetooth icon, you're telling it to \"send the advertising packets to discover the BLE devices\".  \n", "Q: Is there a 1 cable solution to connect 2 monitors in extended mode and charge a MacBook 15\" at the same time? Is there a hub which can drive 2 screens directly without relying on DisplayPort-MST and charge a laptop at 85W?\nWhat I'm trying to find is a hub which would allow the following using only 1 cable to the laptop (thunderbolt preferably or USB type C):\n\n\n*\n\n*charge a 15\" MacBook Pro (85W) at full speed\n\n*use 2 external monitors over HDMI or display port in extended mode\n\n*keep using the macbook's screen (effectively driving 3 screens in extended mode)\n\n\nAll of this from Mac OS.\nI have tried multiple docks so far, and none seems to offer a simple way of connecting multiple monitors to the MacBook 15\" (2018).\nThe USB ones I tried require a display link driver. Despite this they don't drive more than 1 monitor (1080p) at a time. If you connect 2 they copy the same image to both monitors (so they work but not in extended mode)\nAnother issue with the thunderbolt 3 ones is that all the ones I looked at are unable to drive 2 screens over DP or HDMI directly. They require either:\n\n\n*\n\n*one of the screens to be connected using thunderbolt or USB-C\n\n*the OS of the computer attached must handle DisplayPort-MST\n\n\nThe issue is that OSX does not support DisplayPort-MST for hubs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#Multi-Stream_Transport_(MST) (even if apple mentions MST support in their docs)\nA solution which seems to work with most setups is to add a USC-C to HDMI dongle. But this comes at the expense of having to use another dongle, and of sacrificing daisy chaining.\nI have found that using a thunderbolt 3 hub and connecting it to a second hub (thunderbolt 2 or 3 consistently and USB-C sometimes) allows me to drive 2 monitors in extended mode without sacrificing chaining, even when the MacBook is using the built-in display, but this is not the ideal solution as it requires multiple docks per computer.\n\nA: You need a Thunderbolt 3 dock - many exist.  What you seem to be confused about is that they require a Thunderbolt 3 monitor - they don't. You can buy a simply cable to connect the Thunderbolt 3 port on the dock to the monitor via DisplayPort or mini-DisplayPort.\nI'm using the OWC 12-port Thunderbolt 3 dock for attaching dual-monitors to the MacBook Pro while charging it at the same time. Monitors are both connected using mini-DisplayPort. This does not use MST as that is not supported by macOS. Nor does it use DisplayLink. It is all connected to the MacBook Pro with a single Thunderbolt 3 cable.\nYou can also use other Thunderbolt 3 docks such as the OWC 14-port Thunderbolt 3 dock, the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock HD, the Caldigit TS3, the Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Pro Dock, and many others. They all provide 85 watts for charging and allow attaching two monitors.\nIt would seem that the docks you have tested earlier are USB-C docks. They require MST to be able to support dual-displays, or they use DisplayLink. MST is not supported on macOS, so that's only going to work if you run Windows on the MacBook Pro. DisplayLink is generally limited in performance compared to a native DisplayPort signal.\n\nA: My mother and I each have a SIIG DisplayLink dock that allows our laptops to connect in this exact setup with a single USB-C (thunderbolt) connection.  It's a big block with 2 sets of display ports (choice of hdmi or dvi for each set, I'm using dvi.  So total of 4 display ports, but only 2 distinct display ports), 60W power, a couple USB on the back, 2 USB on the front, 2 USB-C on the front, 1 ethernet port on the back, and 1 USB-C to the computer on the back.  You do have to install DisplayLink manager software and giving it permission to 'record your screen' is a pain first time around.  But once you do it just works.  I have 2 external monitors, and none of the 3 screens total are duplicated.  The cool thing is I can switch my entire setup back and forth between my Macbook Pro and my HP Windows machine with simply moving a single cable between the two computers.\nThese do run around 200 to 400 dollars, so that's the biggest pain point.  https://www.displaylink.com/downloads/macos is where I downloaded the manager from.  (DisplayLink Manager not DisplayLink Driver.)  You have to give this permission to record your screen.\nI had a 13\" macbook, and now I have a 16\" which I just copied everything to using migration assistant and plugging the new one in just worked.  I haven't let the 16\" (comes with 96W power cord) drain the battery very much, so I don't know if working on it and running programs while charging on 60W would work.  But normal use (running Docker and a bunch of compilers, stuff that would spin up the fans on the 13\" quickly) doesn't have the battery drop while plugged in.  And it has charged from 90% while in use pretty quickly.\n\nI just realized that this is an older question.  I did have to upgrade MacOS to Catalina in order to use DisplayLink.  Upgrading to Catalina is a major pain point, especially if you're a programmer instead of simply using the standard apps.  I couldn't get the Legacy DisplayLinkManager to download, so I never got to test the Legacy ones with the older OS.\nIn addition, it's not the end-all-be-all.  I can't use the ethernet port on the dock because when I do, my keyboard and mouse slow down to a painfully slow level (40-50 wpm instead of my max speed of 80.  And if I try faster than 40-50, my accuracy drops because it misses keystrokes)\n", "Q: How to use Macbook pro in clamshell mode with lid open on macos mojave? Due to heating issues, I would like to use macbook in clamshell mode with lid open, but all the commands mentioned on the web are for older versions of OS X\n\n\nA: You can fool the Mac into thinking that the lid is closed by placing a very weak magnet on the sensor that is normally triggered when you close the lid.\nThe exact position of that sensor varies, but it should be somewhere at the very edge of the laptop, just behind the trackpad.\nOf course you must be extremely careful bringing magnets near computers, but if you use one that is weak enough and small enough, you should be able to reproduce the effect of the magnet that is in the display portion of your laptop.\n\nA: I've just set up open clamshell mode on my MacBook Pro 16\" on Catalina and the same technique should work on Mojave. Open clamshell is much cooler. At idle fans now spin at 1900rpm with two external monitors. In closed-lid clamshell fans spin 2800rpm with the same set up. That's at idle. At load they spin off the charts in closed-clamshell and very slow to decrease speed. In open-clamshell the fan peaks are much lower and high rpm rotation stops much more quickly.\nTo set up closed lid clamshell, it's necessary to change an nvram boot argument. Here's the command:\nnvram boot-args=\"niog=1\"\n\nTo set an nvram boot argument, SIP must be disabled. If you haven't disabled SIP before1, here's now.\nYou can check SIP status in terminal with this command: csrutil status. If you do have SIP enabled (and most do), the way to disable it is to boot into recovery mode which is done by restarting your MacBook while pressing ⌘R. While in Recovery Mode, you should open terminal and run csrutil disable.\nOnce you have disabled SIP:\n\n*\n\n*reboot your MacBook\n\n*open terminal\n\n*run nvram boot-args=\"niog=1\"\n\n*reboot again with your MacBook lid closed in regular clambook mode and your external monitors plugged in.\n\nYou should now be able to open your MacBook without the internal screen lighting up.\nIf you are a normal user and/or cautious about security, you may want to turn SIP back on. This means booting again in Recovery Mode and this time running csrutil enable in terminal before rebooting. Again you can check SIP status after rebooting in terminal with csrutil status.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*\n\n*Personally I like my Macs to run how I want them to run and usually keep SIP off to avoid going through the headache of turning SIP on and off any time I want to customise one of my Macs: SIP didn't exist at all until 10.11 El Capitan and most users were able to manage their Macs securely: what I care about is my personal data and SIP does not protect personal data only the OS. SIP does more to prevent a computer owner from customising his Mac than a competent hacker from breaking into a Mac. One could persuasively argue SIP keeps the NSA/CIA backdoors firmly in place, safely out of reach of third-party programs like Little Snitch and savvy end users.\n\n", "Q: How can I use my Bluetooth speaker for 2 Apps Spotify + Microphone Apps at same time?

I use the keyboard shortcut CommandOptionL to lock my machine. For the most part this works, but not if Chrome is in focus. In Chrome, when I use that combination, it opens the \"Downloads\" page in a tab. I have tried everything I can think of to prevent this.\nThere is a menu item for \"Downloads\": Window -> Downloads. I have used the  System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> App Shortcuts to attempt to set it to something else, but it doesn't seem to matter, I can add a new shortcut for Downloads, but no matter what I do CommandOptionL still opens Downloads. The only difference is the shortcut I configure highlights \"Window\" in the menu bar momentarily, while CommandOptionL does not. Although it does highlight if I set the shortcut to CommandOptionL.\nI have even gone so far as to set defaults write com.google.Chrome NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Downloads' '\\0'.\nWhen I read:\ndefaults read com.google.Chrome NSUserKeyEquivalents\n{\n    Downloads = \"\";\n}\n\nand yet CommandOptionL still opens the Downloads page.\nGlobal keyboard shortcuts in macOS  have always been frustrating, but it was possible to override each conflicting app, but this one is driving me crazy.\nEDIT: I also went through the chrome extensions and no keyboard shortcut was set to CommandOptionL. I also tried disabling all extensions; it did not work.\n\nA: There is already a system wide keyboard shortcut to lock your display. It's CommandControlQ for High Sierra and higher and ControlShift⏏ on other systems, to let your display go to sleep (which is effectively the same when password protected). \nWith this keyboard shortcuts in mind you can be sure, that they don't interfere with any application.\nNote that on newer MacsBook Pros with Touch ID only the first keyboard shortcut works.\n\nA: As you know the shortcuts are tied up with the application, while Apple also has they sometimes overriding shortcuts.\nFor example the CMD+Q works in almost all apps. Apple or non Apple.\nIf the Chrome is your top window it will use Chrome shortcut for Option+Cmd+L (not Apple), or yours.\nChrome lets you add or modify some shortcuts but not all.\nThe only way to do that would be to modify the Chrome Plist, which I do not recommend.\n\nA: CommandOptionL is a system shortcut defined by Apple that (as you've found out) opens the ~/Downloads folder.  \nApple mandates that App Developers respect those shortcuts.\n\nRespect standard keyboard shortcuts and create app-specific shortcuts\n  for frequently used commands. Keyboard shortcuts let people activate\n  menu items and actions by pressing specific key combination.\n\nWhy Chrome devs chose to hard wire in CommandOptionL as opening the downloads location is something only they can answer.  (IMO) The downloads folder configured in Chrome can be entirely different  from the system's ~/Downloads folder.  Doing a simple test, I changed my download location in Chrome to my Desktop and pressing CommandOptionL opened my Desktop folder (as expected).\nSo, the Chrome devs decided to re-map a system shortcut which is something Apple frowns upon:\n\nIn general, don’t override standard keyboard shortcuts. Users may become confused if the shortcuts they know work differently in your\n  app. Only in very rare cases does it make sense to redefine a common\n  shortcut. For example, if people spend a significant amount of time in\n  your app, it might make sense to redefine a standard shortcut that\n  isn’t applicable to your app. Another option might be to let the user\n  choose their own keyboard shortcuts.\n\nSo, the problem is with Chrome and not with macOS.  That said, there's no \"lock\" (like in Windows).  I don't recommend attempting to re-map keyboard shortcuts to mimic their Windows counterpart (WindowsL, in this case).  With a small amount of practice, you can easily switch between both systems.\n", "Q: NetBoot Server Alternatives for macOS 10.14 Mojave? Apple has removed, among many other things, DHCP serving and NetBoot Serving from their 'server' app in conjunction with the new OS. This won't affect 99.5% of people but I'm in the minority. I fix Macs for a living and have been using Netbooting for 10 years as my faster, better version of booting a customers Mac off a USB utility disk. I use NetInstall images too for installing the OS but I primarily use Diskless NetBoot images to diagnose and repair disk problems. I run this on my laptop, plug into someone's network, and BAM. Or what is more often the case, on wifi-only networks, I just plug in directly mac to mac and use DHCP service also running on my laptop. \nWell both services are gone. DHCP is easy enough to replace I'm sure, but NetBoot serving doesn't seem as straight forward. I did some googling but only found solutions that support NetInstall, and not diskless-NetBoot images. I need the latter more than anything. \nI know Apple may be working towards killing NetBooting entirely, but it's not dead yet. And I tend to work on older computers more than new, so I still need NetBoot for years to come. I am currently playing around with running 10.11 in a virtual machine on my laptop. But that's not an ideal solution, i'd rather run a direct, native server.\nBSDPy does not support diskless netbooting, so that option won't work.\nI was eyeing DeployStudio but its not clear if that app IS it's own NetBoot server, or if it just works with Apple's NetBoot server?\n\nA: What about a netSUS server?\nhttps://github.com/jamf/NetSUS\nJust a thought, but I've run one and it works great\n", "Q: Resize APFS Container I've just been able to reassign the correct format to my SSD to APFS, see this question. however I notice that my Container isn't set to the proper size. I assume this is because the drive previously had a Bootcamp partition that I erased to install macOS Mojave, and now have completely erased. I have seen guides such as this one, but I wasn't comfortable trying any of these myself. The container in question is /dev/disk2s2 - Container disk4. The container is set to 439.9 GB instead of 500 GB. I know some of this space will go to the Preboot, Recovery, and VM partitions, but that still leaves a good 55 GB unaccounted for.

trevorraney$ \n\n\nA: If you do have free space on your disk then Disk Utility.app should allow you to resize into it, but this is only possible if the free space exists after your APFS container, which I believe should be the case for an old Bootcamp volume.\nIn Disk Utility locate your physical disk (if you don't see it, press Command and 2 together to show all), select the physical disk and click the Partition button and you'll see a circular \"pie chart\" of your partitions starting from the top centre (12 o'clock) position and working their way around clockwise. One of these will be your APFS container and will show your APFS volumes stored within it, and after that you should see your free space (if any) as another \"slice\". Unfortunately I don't have a disk with any meaningful free space so I'm not 100% sure how Disk Utility will display this, it may appear as an \"Untitled\" partition that you can remove, or just as a blank segment.\nTo expand your container select it so that a little circular handle appears, drag this until it occupies all of the free space (alternatively you can enter the size in the box to the right). If you don't see the handle you may need to first select the empty space and \"delete\" it with the minus button. In this case Disk Utility should expand your container automatically, but you should double check it in case. Once you're happy with how the layout looks, click apply; you will receive a summary of the changes that are about to be made, double and triple check this to make sure your container will not be deleted, only resized.\nBelow is an image of how one of my disks looks in the partitioning UI:\n\nHere you can you see that I've resized my container (currently holding two volumes, macOS and Users) to take up some of the space of another partition (the cross-hatched section is the current size of the container, the flat blue section is new space that will be taken from \"Untitled\").\nNOTE: Disk Utility can be a bit finicky about what it will let you do to a live APFS container/volume, so you might not be able to expand the container if one or more volumes are mounted. In this case you'll need to restart into recovery (Command and R after the startup chime) and run Disk Utility from there.\nNOTES 2: I realise you may not need an answer anymore, but I thought I'd answer anyway for anyone finding this in searches etc. Hope you can get your disk woes resolved!\n\nA: What's going on here is that you have some unassigned space on the disk - disk2, not the synthesized disk4.\nThere are sectors not allocated to the EFI partition (disk2s1) or the APFS container partition (disk2s2).\nThe container size will be whatever you set it as, of course  - the volumes will change size as space is taken up.\nTake a look here; you can see that the sectors start right after the end of the previous partition:\n\n\nThat's a really normal looking GUID partition table - there's the 1MB at the beginning and end, for example. Notice that only really shows up in the second screenshot. And that's the kind of thing you're looking for; sectors that aren't assigned to a partition - \"free space.\"\nI'm sure this is what's going on if I understand correctly that you erased a bootcamp partition, but didn't reformat the whole drive.\nMy advice is to back everything up in triplicate, reformat the drive, and then restore...\nTechnically, however, you could take a look at what's going on in there... check out this post, and see what you can find out about where your missing sectors are.\nI might boot it up with a Linux usb stick and check it out, but that's outside the scope of this.\n", "Q: HOW can i enable my \"ipad\" airplane mode BEFORE i unlock it? i just read the article, \n\nPossible to access/restore past versions of Notes in iCloud?\n\nAnd someone's answer seems great: \n\nAssuming you have 2 devices, let's say an iPhone and iPad, there is only one thing you can do:\n\ndelete something on your iPhone\nas soon as you notice, enable airplane mode on your iPad\nunlock iPad & open notes\ncopy note to somewhere else\nturn off airplane mode\ncopy note back to notes\n\nSo my question is: HOW can i enable my \"ipad\" airplane mode BEFORE i unlock it?

Also, consider if you have cellular service, disable that or remove the SIM or go away from coverage (in a faraday cage if you can) before you unlock the device to make changes.\n", "Q: Since update to Mojave SD card disappears after sleep Since an update to Mojave, the SD card which I use permanently in my MBP \nalways gets unmounted after longer sleep and importantly, it does only remount after restart. \nI know this question has been posted several times.

Stylish is not on the Safari Extension Gallery since they were stealing browsing information.\n\nA: There is a paid ($3 in US) application Cascadea. I’m happy with it, because it is Safari App Extension instead of the Legacy Safari Extensions (.safariextz files). It seems to only work with User CSS (*.user.css) though, so you may want to write to support team (support@cascadea.app) to confirm before you pay.\n\nA: I previously used dotjs and dotcss for Safari. As I relied on these a lot, I've written an extension for Safari 12 that provides the same functionality in one extension with a simpler setup.\nNot sure if this is enough for your needs as it only offers injection of CSS and JS files based on the page's domain name.\nIn case you want to find out more, I've written an introductory blog post. The extension is available on the App Store ($5). It's open source, so you're also welcome to compile it yourself for free.\n\nA: I've actually found Tampermonkey. It's not totally Stylish but it can do the same.\n\nA: I replaced Stylish with FreeStyler which provides the same functionality just with a slightly worse UI. There’s no automatic import path from files or another extension, so moving styles were a case of manual copy-paste and configuring the applicable hosts/URL prefixes.\n", "Q: Sorting files on extension (kind) and then date in Finder? (Mojave) When viewing a folder in Finder, by clicking the different column headings you can select how you want the folder contents sorted: by name, kind (extension), modified date, et cetera.\nWhat I would like is to see is all files of a certain kind grouped together, and then sorted on date. For example, all .jpg files sorted on date, then all .txt files sorted on date, and so on. \nSo something like a 'combined' sorting criterium, where kind or filetype takes higher precedence, and then (for files with the same extension) date, and perhaps even more criteria. \nIs this possible in Finder? Can I perhaps even define or customize my own 'sorting rules' ?\nIn case it matters, I'm using macOS 10.14 Mojave.\n\nA: *\n\n*Click the Group button, then choose an option, e.g. kind.\n\n*Hold the Option  key and click the Group button again, now you can choose the criteria to sort by.\n\nTested on macOS Ventura.\n", "Q: macOS Mojave stacks not grouping by type I have updated my MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017) with macOS Mojave and everything is woking as per the need.\nBut I think new feature of macOS Mojave called Stacks is not working properly on my MacBook when I set Group Stacks By to Kind. \nIt just create one group with name Other and puts everything (Image, Doc, ZIP, Video) in that one group. \nI tried changing Group Stacks and restarting my mac but no luck.\nIs there any other setting for this which I am missing?\n\nA: I have same issue when I change System Preference->Spotlight setting. \nFrom Monitor App, I found Spotlight progress takes a lot of memory, so I disable some options from Spotlight setting's *Search Results*, and then Desktop Stacks with those types disappear.\nSo, re-enable the expected type in Spotlight setting, the type will show on Desktop.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue and found that my Finder Preferences file was corrupted. The Solution for me was to Delete the com.apple.finder.plist File and then reboot.\nI actually just moved the file to the desktop temporarily until I made sure that a new one was created properly....and then deleted it. Note: You will have to reset all your Finder Preferences after reboot.\nStep #1: Open the “Spotlight”.\nStep #2: Now enter the code directly,\n~/Library/Preferences/\nNext, open Preferences and then find and delete the com.apple.finder.plist File.\n\nA: I finally fixed this problem on my iMac and MacBook Pro. I was hoping Catalina would resolve it, but it did not. I then dug into some old message board threads and got a clue.\nGo to System Preferences > Spotlight and uncheck Other in the Search Results tab. This immediately made the Desktop Finder stacks sort properly.\nRechecking the Other box did not cause the problem to recur, so I left it checked.\n\nA: I've had this problem since the Mojave beta and it just resolved itself. What I did was go into Spotlight Search Results preferences and make sure all the boxes are checked, especially the ones named for filetypes (e.g. Images, PDF Documents, etc). I had unchecked a lot of the boxes to prevent cluttering of Spotlight results since I mostly use Alfred to find files, but I think this prevented Finder from cacheing the filetype(?) which it might need to organize files into stacks. I just turned all the Spotlight boxes on and my Desktop very quickly rearranged into the correct filetype-specific stacks, so try that and see if it works.

And, perhaps upgrade to the latest PHP (currently 7.2) while I'm at it?\n\nA: I faced a similar issue on Mojave update, I was able to fix it by updating /etc/hosts file with \n::1             localhost YouMacName.local\n127.0.0.1       localhost YouMacName.local\n\nYou can get YourMacName.local by running in terminal:\n$ hostname\n\nI hope it helps you\n", "Q: Screen sharing stops working after disconnecting for about five minutes I'm running macOS Mojave on a Mac Mini. Built-in VNC server works perfectly when you connect for the first time after reboot, however if you disconnect from it for more than five minutes you can't connect again - it displays the username that was used for the last session and a spinning wheel. Connecting via ssh and killing screensharingagentd doesn't help, only a reboot does. I've verified all the power saving settings are off. There are two virtual machines with macOS High Sierra and Sierra running on this same Mac Mini and I can connect to them without any issues.\n\nA: With the iMac at work, we had to turn OFF the option under System Preferences - Sharing - Screen Sharing - Computer Settings to allow VNC viewers may control screen with password. Then VNC Viewer prompts for the username & password of the iMac (assuming Only these users: is selected for Allow access for). Multiple connections work fine with that setting disabled. Hope this helps.\n\nA: My workaround for this problem is to login via ssh and kill loginwindow process:\nsudo pkill loginwindow\n\nThis will allow to login via VNC then.\n\nA: From this article:\n\nApple have added a new security layer to macOS 10.14 Mojave. After upgrading your Mac to Mojave, VNC Server will allow only view-only remote access until such time as you've granted access to the vncagent application (installed as part of VNC Server).\nTo do this, open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility. Click the lock button to make changes, and + to add a new app to the list allowed to control your computer. Navigate to /Library/vnc/vncagent and select the Open button\n\n\nA: Some more detail, as I'm seeing very similar behaviour, possibly the same.\nUsing RealVNC client connecting to RealVNC server on Mojave, works perfectly every time. Using this method you are connecting via the cloud using RealVNC to negotiate a session.\nUsing RealVNC client connecting to Macs own \"ScreenShare\" utility, via bonjour or local IP address, does not use the RealVNC server, and works for the first few attempts, but leave it for 5 minutes without logging in, then try again and it fails exactly as described, Lockscreen with User's name and picture, but a spinning wheel beneath, with no option to login.\nReconnecting via RealVNC server is still possible whilst in this state.\nStopping and starting ScreenSharing only kills the window with the spinning wheel, it has no other effect.\nA reboot of the MAC, and it works again....for a while.\nWorked fine on High Sierra.\n\nA: Not a fix, but another work-around to clear the locked spinny screen is to access the mac (physically) and log out the user.  My Mini is in a server closet, close to my desk, so this is annoying but not too difficult.  \n(I am going to try the option above to tinker with the connection/login)\n\nA: This seems to be a Mojave bug.\nThe suggested sudo pkill loginwindow work-around will logout the current user on the machine and kill all it's processes.\nA better option is given in this answer to another question about the same problem:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement VNCAlwaysStartOnConsole -bool true\n\nIt takes effect immediately (without reboot), and lets you connect directly to the current session, with only the VNC password.\n\nA: Apologies that this is as an answer but I lack enough reputation to add it as a comment.\nI had exactly the same issue so I took to contacting Apple for support.  After a lot of back and forth trying to explain the issue I was eventually given this response.\n\nApple Support\nSo, regarding this specific setup, this is something outside of normal\n  consumer support that we can assist with. I can, however get you in\n  contact with our business department who works with remote server\n  access and can help provide you with more details moving forward. For\n  those steps, this would require contacting our phone support. Would\n  you like for me to schedule a time for you, or would you prefer the\n  phone number to get in contact with them at your leisure?\nMe\nGive me the number and I'll see when I can get a call\n  done.\nApple Support\nSure thing - here is the main AppleCare support number:\n  1-800-275-2273 I will also email you our case number as well. When you\n  contact them, you can let them know that you are looking to speak with\n  our business support team regarding a remote server issue, and they\n  will get you route you to the right place.\nMe\nand so we're totally clear remote screen sharing is not\n  supported for normal users only for businesses?\nApple Support\nThat is correct\n\nSo from that if you are an end user who isn't prepared to go through business support good luck.\n", "Q: How to prevent \"smart searching\" in Safari? Suppose I am trying to search for information about this file:\n/etc/inetd.conf\n\nIf I paste the following into Safari's search bar:\n\"/etc/inetd.conf\"\n\nSafari tries to be clever and converts it into :\nhttp://www.\".com/etc/inetd.conf%22\n\nAnd then tells me it can't be found.  If I do the same with Chrome, it simply searches for what I want without trying to be clever.\nHow can I prevent Safari from trying to do \"smart searching\" and instead simply search for what I want?\n\nA: *\n\n*Proper way out:\n\n\nopen the search engine page (e.g.:google.com) and paste the string into the search field.\n\n\n*\n\n*Easiest way out:\n\n\npaste the above into the URL bar (which is increasingly abused as a search field as well.) \nTo indicate that you are cleverer than Safari, jump to the first position and insert a space character. (e.g. Ctrl+a, followed by Space)\nThat indicates to the browser that you are searching for a string and not trying to insert a botched URL. The leading space will be ignored by your search engine. This works in almost all cases when you want to make sure that Safari parses the contents of the URL bar not as an address but as a search string.\nNow some strings seem to be more equal than others. Input \"/etc/inetd.conf\" and indeed Safari also ignores the first space for that. Then there are other examples like:\n /private/etc searches directly, /private searches directly, /private/ opens a Finder window… Some paths seem to be hardcoded.\nIn the example above / etc/inetd.conf should take you to a desired result.\n", "Q: ios 12.0 how can I delete specific plug in applications within the Message app?

I have no phone and have only used this address when registering my iPad and the payment mechanism for buying things in the AppStore.\nThis email address which I have had for over 10 years is now receiving spam from a single company: \"Goodman Capital\" which is advertising some kind of investment services. I receive absolutely no other communications on this address except for official Apple correspondence, like password resets and things like that.\nIs Apple providing customer emails to third parties or have they been hacked?\nThe only comparable problem I have had is that the email address I use to communicate with Adobe receives occasional spam, but this is because of a known hack where somebody got access to Adobe's customer records and began selling them on the dark web.\n\nA: No - Apple doesn't sell out emails and the simple explanation is that this resource just tried all mail addresses possible at Apple and now knows your mail is valid (or doesn't know it's not valid) and will keep spamming it forever since they don't actually have permission or a lead - they're just being nasty like someone that robo calls all the phone numbers possible whether they're in the phone book or not.\n", "Q: Purple dot near app which downloaded by iCloud sync I added my account to my old iPad mini and I downloaded this app on it. Then, I used my iPhone and saw that the app downloaded too on it. Is the purple dot DOES mean that it downloaded by sync? And can I shut this feature off?\n\n\nA: A blue dot before an apps' icon name means that it has not bee run yet (or it is a new version that has not been run).\nAn orange dot means that the app was downloaded as a beta as installed through Testflight.\nThe last is from this SO answer which also suggests the colours alter if on a different background.\nTry a plain black or white background to see if the colour changes to one of these known ones.\n", "Q: Updates impact on /usr with SIP Disabled I have a very complex application that needs a directory in /usr. By complex, I mean it would take thousands of changes to rid the code of /usr references. It has to be done, but I need a newer OS X immediately. When I attempted to upgrade an older OS X system, it wiped this directory as part of the installation. If I run the csrutil disable on the system, place the /usr subdirectory back where it goes, will ongoing OS X security updates within the Mojave version (10.14, not OS major upgrades) purge the directory when applied, or leave it in place?\n\nA: There is no way of knowing in advance.

Computer response is so slow it's almost useless. Same results on iMac 27\" Retina Display Mid 2015 and Mac mini Late 2012. Tried NVRAM and SMC resets to no avail. iMac worked fine when I reverted back to High Sierra but backup for mini is on the WiFi network.\n\nA: I edited the /etc/sysctl.conf file. There are three settings adjusting socket buffers to improve broadband performance. I doubled the numbers there and it fixed the networking issues.\n   There was a constant stream of error messages saying sockets were unable to allocate buffer memory. Apparently, there is a process crashing somewhere and not releasing it’s socket buffers. I don’t know which one is doing it because it is hard to track down due to the sluggishness.\n\nA: Just so you know, you're not the only one with this issue.\nI can't help you with fixing this issue, but I can offer advice on restoring the backup on the WiFi iMac:\nI was able to manually reconfigure the wifi when booted in to recovery mode by clicking on the wifi icon on the top left. Wifi showed 'no hardware detected' when booted in Mojave, but it DID work when booted to recovery mode - So you should be able to restore the mac mini that way.\n( FYI, I have the exact same problem you're seeing, also with computers I just upgraded - An iMac and a MacBook pro. This may imply that it has something to do with software or extensions we've both installed. Unlikely to be kernel extension, as safe mode is supposed to disable 3rd party extensions.\nLike you, I also tried Resetting NVRAM, SMC etc with no luck.\nDid you have the issue where the bluetooth keyboard and mouse were no longer detected in Mojave as well on the iMac?

Testing was with with Standard Notes App. \nI got the 2018 anyway, at this undeniable price.\nI was then super surprised that in OneNote (which I prefer) the lag was much less noticeable than in Notes. So it is a software thing, after all!!!\nWith iOS 12 now, I have more lag in OneNote, while Notes is now much smoother!!!\nHas anybody experienced similarly?\nAny workarounds/tips?\n\nA: Based on viewing the drawing footage in slow motion, it appears the new Apple Notes app in iOS 12 is using Apple's Predicted Touches technology, which makes an educated guess as to where future touches on the display will appear so the developer can temporarily pre-draw the path there. This explains why the latency now appears faster than OneNote, which doesn't appear to use this technology. As far as I'm aware, previous versions of Apple Notes did not use this technology.\nIf you want to reduce latency for Apple Pencil input, the 2nd-generation iPad Pros are the way to go because they have the 120hz ProMotion display, versus 60hz for the 2018 iPad, though they are now well over a year old -- so maybe best to wait for an update. Alternatively, you could use PDF Viewer by PSPDFKit, which has the lowest latency of any app I've used because it uses more predicted touches than Apple Notes.\n", "Q: Applescript to return name of new file added to folder This is mostly a test so that I can work up to the function that I want to create down the line.

I'm using MacOS 10.13.6 (High Seirra)\nI was reading through some ways to launch new windows of Chrome on macOS and keep running into the same problem; How can I launch multiple instances of Chrome where CMD+Q doesn't close all of them?  \nPerhaps my understanding of what this action does is incorrect? \nI have been under the impression that when I use CMD+Tab each icon displayed is an instance of that application. \n\nI tried this:\nopen -na /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome\nwhich seems to open a new window, but I still only see one instance of Google Chrome running in the Activity Monitor.\n\nI found an answer from 2012 that suggests the only way possible is to literally copy the application which I can't believe is still true today.

Essentially, this is the situation where I would usually just use Chrome for one purpose and Firefox for the other, but I just happen to be using a Chrome-Only app so I have no such options.\nIn my case I need also separate access to the separate instances from outside apps for audio input/output.\nThis is not a \"fun\" solution, but for the past few years, I've been using a (custom-compiled) instance of Chromium as my \"secondary\" instance of Chrome, so that MacOS considers them completely different apps, and I can customize the Chromium compile to do specific things I want, as well.\nAgain, the process of compiling/customizing Chromium was not fun (or fast) in the least, but if I understood you correctly, \"two profiles\" isn't enough unless the Mac sees the two browsers as \"two completely different apps\".\nThat technique is the only thing that has worked for me, but it's worked for many things including some fairly complicated audio work, where the Mac treats them as completely separate applications, for a couple of years now. For instance, I can log in \"twice\" as two completely separate users for podcast purposes, where one instance of Chrome is using audio interface A, and the instance of Chromium is using audio interface B, and Ctrl-Q on either one has no effect on the other one.\nCaveats: your open-source compile compile of Chromium will lack some codecs or... DRM-something... or whatever, so some video content will be difficult or impossible to access, and you have to be pretty careful to prevent the Chromium install from stepping on (or just getting \"confused\" by) the user data of the \"real\" Chrome.\nI hope I heard the problem and that helps a bit, or if you've found a better solution any time since this slightly old question, I'd love to hear about it.\n\nA: Install Chrome Beta then you can run 2 completely separate chrome instances.

If it is an iPhone 6, there actually isn't any adhesive between the display and the enclosure. It is possible to two screws at the bottom are loose, and when they put the display back on, they will tighten those. I would just mention the display problem when you drop it off for the battery.

That also contained updated drivers that worked with more modern versions of the OS. On their support pages the now simply state and answer likewise to questions about it that they just do not offer that any longer.\nThe problem is now, that the old drivers can be shoehorned into a Sierra install but lead to a kernel panic on boot. This is for the latest drivers from a Huawei installer I archived. Upgraded from Yosemite the drivers work in Sierra. Those from Huawei are still called DatacardDriverMacOSX(10.9)\nOn Mojave the installer complains about an expired certificate but continues. Expecting a security exception to confirm I restarted and the extensions just do not load at all. The system just refuses to touch them and loading is no longer possible.

They only ever had one driver package for Macs that supported all sticks they ever made. As that stick I have supports all the speed the provider offers here I'd like to stick with that stick.

Check settings->Mail and make sure that the account in question is not your Default account. If so, make another account the Default. Then go back to Settings->Accounts and the Mail slider in the broken account should be active and you can turn it off.

Originally I had it installed on to my internal drive's EFI partition (and installed it in the recovery environment) but every time I update macOS on my main drive or an external drive, which is frequently due to the nature of my work, macOS sets itself back as the main startup disk and I have to boot back into the recovery environment to rebless refind. This is a pain in the ass.\nI noticed that refind has the option of installing itself on to a separate HFS+ partition using the --ownhfs option, which is supposed to allow selecting that partition in the Startup Disk system preferences. I thought that'd be a good solution since every time I update macOS, all I'd need to do is use that pref pane to set the startup disk back to refind. So I made the partition and installed refind to it in the recovery environment. Everything worked okay so far.\nHowever, as soon as I tried to use the Startup Disk pref pane to change my startup disk back to refind, it would give me an error that reads \"Running bless to place boot files failed\". Here is a screenshot of the error:\n\nIs there anything I can do to get this working? Or is it perhaps the case that this particular feature of refind (installing with --ownhfs) no longer works with macOS 10.14?\nPlease note that I cannot disable system integrity protection on my system because I routinely need to test software that requires it to be fully enabled. I'm hoping there's a solution that allows me to more easily set refind as the startup disk without disabling SIP.\n\nA: First of all, you do not need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) to install rEFInd. Second, you do not need use the bless command to make rEFInd the default on startup. Third, while installing to a HFS+ partition does work on a 2015 Mac, eventually this will no longer be possible on the 2018 and newer Macs. (See the recently posted question: Bless error when installing rEFInd) \nAs for your specific question, recent versions of macOS will not allow rEFInd to be selected from System Preferences. However for a 2015 Mac, you should be able to select rEFInd as the default on startup by using the Mac's Startup Manager. Restart the Mac and immediately hold down the option key until the Startup Manager icons appear. Next, hold down the control key while selecting the partition rEFInd is installed on. In your case, this partition should by default be labeled the same as HFS volume. Now on subsequent starts, the Mac should boot to rEFInd.\nI should also point out that if Windows is installed with the Windows Support Support software, then rEFInd may be set as the default at startup from the Windows Control Panel. This option is only possible when rEFInd is properly installed to a HFS+ partition.\n\nNote: The rEFInd Boot Manager can also be installed 2015 or newer Macs to either an EFI partition or a MSDOS (FAT) formatted partition. You can use the default EFI partition or on any additional EFI partition of your choose to add. If installed properly, rEFInd can be blessed by the Startup Manager.\n\nOne final comment. If you install rEFInd to a MSDOS FAT partition, then you can change the default operating system, that rEFInd will boot, directly from macOS, Windows or Linux. This can be done by using a text editor or by installing a script. (The use of these scripts is shown in this answer.) The same is true if rEFInd is install to an EFI partition, except accessing the EFI partition usually requires elevated permissions.\n", "Q: Mojave App Store Only Shows \"Updates\" Tab I'm having trouble with the App Store since installing Mojave.

When I press \"Continue\", confirm again with \"Continue\", and supply my Apple ID password, there is some kind of processing going on for a few seconds, but then the system returns to the same point and state.\nSo in effect I am locked out of iCloud (e.g. cannot see calendar entries previously created there) and have supplied my password in vain.\nIs this a known issue and how can it be overcome? I remember that the macOS upgrade process got permanently stuck (> 1 hour; also very annoying!) very late on (after the first login prompt and presumably also were it tried to set up iCloud) and I had to reboot the machine. Things seemed normal thereafter, but now this issue is showing up, and it may well be related.\nUPDATE I've meanwhile reinstalled macOS Mojave (with Command + R) but the situation is unchanged.\nUPDATE I'm by now pretty certain that the root cause must be a corrupted state that is kept by iCloud locally as persistent data that resides local to a macOS user account. Where does iCloud store such information, i.e. removing what files resets the iCloud client in macOS to a \"clean\" state?\n\nA: You're absolutely right, this is a very common occurrence right now. It is a known issue, to put it mildly. Its not entirely tied to Mojave per se, nor do I think your theory of \"the root cause must be a corrupted state that is kept by iCloud locally as persistent data that resides local to a macOS user account\", is it exactly (though it is not outside the realm of possibility). But far more likely is that you're experiencing the  fallout of several recent significant changes affecting iCloud authentication across the board, due to several serious security vulnerabilities discovered in the past few months. What's happening is that Apple's tring to implement a \"middle ground\" approach in not simply breaking iCloud syncing across the board all at once for everyone, so some processes will continue to accept the unpatched authentication tokens, while others require immediate reauthentication. Its a mess. But: its not quite as terrible as it seems (in my experience).\nHaving just conquered this very thing (again) on one of my my own machine's a couple of hours ago (and having done so several times in the last couple of months), I can tell you there's unfortunately not a straightforward \"1. 2. 3.\" solution I can give you, but your best bet is to stick with working with the iCloud Preference Pane and related rather than doing a \"deep dive\" just yet.\nHere's what I'd recommend:\nFirst: make sure you have an up local backup (Time Machine or the like).\nThen, what you'll want to do is basically attempt to fully sign out of all the places where you authenticate with your Apple ID: App Store, iTunes, Photos, etc., and then the iCloud prefpane. Try unchecking as many synced item's as possible first, particularly Find My Mac and Keychain. These may take a minute or two to actually disengage and \"uncheck\", but if it takes longer than that, just force quit System Preferences and try again. Also, try clicking the \"Account Details\" and \"Manage\" buttons, the same thing will likely happen, it'll freeze up for a bit, and then it will either actually bring those panes up, or hang. Again, just keep going back, and try to get to the point where you're fully signed out, or, if you get the \"Update Apple ID Settings: Some account services\" box again and it doesn't hang, you'll be prompted several times, alternating between asking for your iCloud password and your local admin password. This is a good thing, it means its finally updating the local Keychain stores across the board.\nEventually (in my experience, after about 20 minutes of this, maybe 10 force quits), you should either be fully logged out of iCloud, or the \"Update Apple ID Settings\" thing will finally work. Once you're at that point, you should be able to re-sign in, and these issues should go  away.\nI know that's, um, not the most precise solution, but it has worked for me on several machines. Let me know if it doesn't work for you. But trust me, its a lot less messier than fully ripping out the iCloud keychain and authentication tokens; (at that point, you may as well just sign up for a new Apple ID). \n\nA: I'm assuming the other answer I provided you didn't work given your \"I expect a concrete answer that allows resolving the actual issue\" regarding the bounty grace period, here are some \"concrete\" things you could do that would resolve your inability to log in. However, I must warn you they will likely lead to some data loss in iCloud   and a lot of other headaches.\nThe simplest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do a clean reinstall of Mojave and create a clean user account. That is:\nA. ⌘-R again, but before installing open Disk Utility (from the menu bar) and and delete all your existing partitions; reformat your drive with a single clean APFS partition, then re-install.\nB. After install, when creating your user account, authenticate using your Apple ID, but do not migrate any data from Time Machine perform and other automated restore any other type of backup. You will no longer have this problem. But you will need to reinstall all your applications by hand, etc.\n\n*To answer your question regarding \"removing what files resets [sic] the iCloud client in macOS to a \"clean\" state\":\nWhat you're talking about are not kept in invididual files, but in your Keychain store. So, you could open Keychain Access.app and delete all the items that begin with com.apple.account, com.apple.cloudd, com.apple.gs.iCloud, com.apple.gs.idms, etc., as well as iMessage Encryption Key, iMessage Signing Key, etc. I can't give you a full list because which ones you will have is highly variable (it depends on which sync services you've been using). However, I cannot stress how much do not recommend you do this.\n\nA: So in the end I had to delete the account, create a new one, and recover Desktop, Documents, Movies, Music, and Pictures from a TimeMachine backup as well as import mailboxes also from this backup (under Library/Mail) into Apple Mail. \nShame on Apple: based on this experience I won't hasten do perform their next macOS upgrade!\n\nA: I had a similar experience on Mojave, where setting my primary iCloud account had no effect (after successfully logging in using [System Preferences:iCloud], it would either return to the empty login or say that I’m already signed in, even though my Internet Accounts list doesn’t show anything for iCloud).\nThe following terminal command sorted this out:\ndefaults delete MobileMeAccounts\n\nThis command will remove your iCloud account associations (both your primary iCloud account from [System Preference:iCloud] and the secondary from [System Preference:Internet Accounts]. You should then be able to sign into / add an iCloud as normal.\n", "Q: Is there a way to toggle VPN in iOS shortcuts?

It's not a slam-dunk that builds will be accepted into TF because they do some review on them.\nFor the AppStore, a full review is performed again as if you didn't do TestFlight.  I'm guessing they review any notes from the TF team but I don't have proof of that.\nSo yes, it's possible to be in TF and then fail the AppStore review.  It’s also possible for the opposite to happen, you could struggle more in TF review and then breeze through the store process.\n", "Q: My keyboard (numpad) overwrites everything I have a Mac mini with High Sierra (10.13.4) with a Windows-keyboard (it has a numpad).\nEverything went fine for a long time but a few months ago I got a big problem: In many apps (Calculator, Excel, etc.) when I want to write for example \"567\" with the numpad, the number I push overwrites the last number. So if I push 5, 6 and 7, than instead of \"567\" it just shows a 7 (because the 6 overwrites the 5, and the 7 overwrites the 6).\nIn some apps however it works fine, for example in TextEdit or Firefox...\nI probably just pushed some keyboard-shortcut which made this issue, but it really makes me go crazy.

If you turn on 'slow keys' in the accessibility settings and play with the settings a little bit, eventually there is a sweet spot where you will be able to type your numbers in, albeit a little slower, but at least it will function like it is supposed to.

I am able to send mail successfully.\nMy question is: How do I switch my Primary Server to be the one that is active?  Does it even matter?\n\n\nA: I haven't figured out a way to rearrange the servers so that a different one is the Primary, but I was able to work around it by simply tapping on the Primary server entry and change the details so that it points to the server that I want.

Short version:\nIs there a command-line or GUI method of determining when the local copy of the iCloud keychain has been syncronized (at least on a Mac) or, short of deleting the keychain and re-adding it, force it to sync with the iCloud copy?\nMore details:\nI'm currently running iOS 12 on multiple devices macOS High Sierra on my MacBook. While performing some cleanup, including deleting items via  Settings → Passwords & Accounts → Website and App Passwords on iOS, I observed that the changes did not appear to be syncing back to the Mac. To be clear, changes made in the normal method (i.e., organically through Safari) also are not making it back.\nNote this is on a Mac where the user had only been recently created (so there should be no corruption). The Mac had full network connectivity.\nI know my changes are going to iCloud because nearly all my iOS devices are synchronized nearly instantly.\nAgain, I know I can work around by deleting the Keychain, and re-adding it, but this is not a real solution.\nDoes Apple even document how the process should work?\n\nA: There are no built-in OS X tools designed explicitly for showing you iCloud synchronize information. In easy to read way.\nHowever, you can track connections to Apple's iCloud servers, measure traffic flow, and disk access. \nThese metrics will provide some insight but they will not provide expected duration's or percentage complete measures.\nTo explore the data flow, explore the OS X's built-in tools like lsof and netstat.\n\nA: You can see activity of the process that manages this sync in the console app (as well as using the command line tool log)\nSearch for CloudKeychainProxy and there are quite a few status and information messages when you sign in for the first time in iCloud to sync Keychain data that you can see if some of those messages (or lack of a \"starting sync\" message when the network is turned off and then reconnected) to know that you have no pending syncs. Other processes involved are apsd to listen for notifications coming in that a sync is needed when new items are added from the cloud side. The secd process does the local keychain writes / notifications, so it would presumably activate the CloudKeychainProxy if you have items to send up.\nCloud documents has a handy tool, but keychain is so lightweight, I've not really seen it hang or not be up to date in the absence of an error condition (which do get logged so you can address that if your untimate goal is fixing errors when it's not current).\n", "Q: How do I eliminate SMTP servers in the settings that I no longer use?

Its tucked away in the Develop Tab, then Enter Responsive Design Mode\n\n\nA: You have to have the element inspector open.  So with element inspector open, then, In Safari, when you hover over an element, it shows the pixels. \nAnd you can get it to show the pixels while you resize a window, to do that you click the crosshair icon in the inspector, then hover over the background so it shows the pixels, then move the mouse across so it still shows the pixels, and resize the window and it will update the pixel dimensions.  \nNote that in Chrome, if you have the inspector open, and resize, then it shows you the pixel dimensions while you resize.\n\nA: In case anyone is still looking for a better solution, you can use the ruler tool in the Web Inspector to show live measurements.\nOpen the Web Inspector (⌥⌘I) and click the ruler tool in the icons at the top left.\nOne thing to keep in mind is to start with a page that has no scrolling as it appears to ignore space for the scroll bar when present (15px difference in my case)\n\n\nA: I'd like to share my experience with Opera/Mac OS. There is a similar inspector panel, available from Developer|Developer Tools menu. Measurement function is turned on after selection of an arrow instrument in an upper left corner of that panel. What I've found, is that pixel measurement depends on the web page zoom level (menu Zoom|Zoom In/Zoom Out). In my case, I tried to measure some elements in a browser game. It could not be zoomed at all, i. e. zooming did not change a single pixel on the screen, and yet, measurements were different at different zoom levels.

I've already had my device a day ago for about 22 hours in the water, but I can still use the device without any major problems. In fact, this post was written on it. \nSo would anyone know how long it would take to completely destroy the device? \n\nA: Proven method is to use a hammer as practiced by Hillary Clinton.\nNot even FBI could crack those devices.\nLeaving it in water will not destroy the memory chips (they are sealed).\n\nA: Water is a bad way to do this. If you just use water, salt it heavily and the let it corrode when you remove it from the water and let the atmosphere / drying cycle corrode the contacts. Physical destruction of the memory and logic board and storage is far better. That way you don’t risk fire or lithium battery damage from a short circuit. \n\nA: Awesome question.  Curiously, did you set the hostname of the device to Rasputin! ?....  If so, this will prevent it from drowning and short circuiting, as your 22 hours submerged in water does attest.  \nNext, where drowning failed, poison, stabbing, pistol shots and then rolling the tenacious mac mini in a swath of rug and jetisonning it into a river might work...

I encountered the following problem:\n\nAlthough my SSD has 500GB storage the accessable storage is only 200GB big. When I try to resize any of the two containers with the command diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 150g I get the following error.\n\nThe disk utility app shows this\n\nUsing the disk utility app from recovery mode (pressing Cmd + R at startup) yields the same result.\nIm out of ideas how to fix this.. \n\nA: Just faced with the same problem. I have Yosemity, separated drive without any OS and Mojave on one SSD 250. And I cant add this free space to my Mojave. only to Yusemity. If I'm not mistaken the problem is that your OS is situated on the end of the disk. I dont know how to describe it correctly, so imagine it takes not 0-50% of SSD, but 51-100%. \nIMHO its bullshit, but OSx developers sometimes doing things stupid AF.\nSorry for offtop, so you need to move this drive to the beginning of your SSD and then you can enlarge its space.\nHonestly, I haven't fount the sollution yet, and I suppose I will not even search, cuz' its friday's evening=) But I suppose you'll manage that)\nI hope it will help you, good luck!\n", "Q: Is it OK for Time Machine to take a long time to decrypt a freshly formatted encrypted disk? I'm new to Time Machine. I just this week got an external hard disk and am starting to use it. My Time Machine backups were spending a significant amount of time in the encryption phase. Upon reading this:\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/305540/how-to-encrypt-your-macs-time-machine-backup/\nI thought a better option would be to format the disk as Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) instead of the corresponding unencrypted format. If I understand things right I could then do decrypted backups via Time Machine instead of encrypted backups, leaving the encryption up to the OS's writing to the disk via the encrypted file system format. It seems, judging from the question and answers here, that what I'm doing should be reasonable:\nDifference between enabling Time Machine's \"Encrypt Backups\" option, and encrypting from Disk Utility?\nSo I erased my external drive which only had a few days backups anyway and reformatted it as Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted). But when I added the disk via Time Machine, selected to not encrypt it, and entered my encryption password, I get a message saying this:\nThis Core Storage logical volume is already decrypting.\n\nWait, what? It's decrypting?  Why does it need to decrypt anything? The disk is formatted, empty, and ready to fill with data, right?  I suppose it doesn't know how full or empty the disk is because the entire disk is encrypted? It has been running, decrypting, for quite a few hours and diskutil cs list shows it as only 12% done:\n$ diskutil cs list\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         <name>\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         2000021315584 B (2.0 TB)\n    Free Space:   9392128 B (9.4 MB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    0\n    |   Disk:     disk2s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     2000021315584 B (2.0 TB)\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume Family XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n        ----------------------------------------------------------\n        Encryption Type:         AES-XTS\n        Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n        Conversion Status:       Converting (backward)\n        Reversion State:         Decrypting\n        High Level Queries:      Not Fully Secure\n        |                        Has Visible Users\n        |                        Has Volume Key\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n            ---------------------------------------------------\n            Disk:                  disk3\n            Status:                Online\n            Size (Total):          1999659597824 B (2.0 TB)\n            Conversion Progress:   12%\n            Revertible:            No\n            LV Name:               WDExternalDrive\n            Volume Name:           WDExternalDrive\n            Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n\nNote, in particular:\nReversion State:         Decrypting\n\nand:\nConversion Progress:   12%\n\nCan someone explain to me what is going on?

Oh well, it was just machine time. Is what I'm doing misguided? Did I miss a step somewhere or take a wrong turn?\nMy question still remains: can someone tell me what is wrong with my process? I want to use the filesystem encyrypted format to backup my machine without Time Machine needing to encrypt the disk as a post process operation. Is this possible?\n\nA: I’ve had the same question, and after a bit of research (and based on my own experience) I’ve come to some conclusions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Encryption made by TimeMachine and Encryption made by disk utility is the SAME thing and it is done only one time.\n\n*Based on your question I think that this part of TM is poorly implemented (and NOT explained by apple), in fact when you, after encrypting the backup, selected the option to NOT encrypt it in TM the system asked you for the encryption password and done a (I guess) total decryption of all the free memory on the disk, instead of simply reformat that (and I think that TM does that to be “transparent” in that operation without having to ask to reformat the disk in an encrypted format).\nTHEN TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION\n“ My question still remains: Can someone tell me what is wrong with my process? I want to use the filesystem encrypted format to backup my machine without Time Machine needing to encrypt the disk as a post-process operation. Is this possible?”\nYES, this is possible, given what I said in “1.”, the best method that you can use (and that I use too) to achieve that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Format the disk in “Mac OS Extended (Journaled) Encrypted”\n\n*set the disk as the backup disk for TM, checking the option to set the backup as ENCRYPTED\nLet it do the backup (which will not do additional encrypting processes etc.) and then you’re done!\n\nA: In your case for 2 TB drive it can take up to few days.\nTo keep it working overnight go to System Preferences > Energy Saver and leave the disk running.\nOf course leave it plugged in. \nJust to make sure it stays awake, you can use the caffeinate in Terminal.\nYou can check the status from the terminal with diskutil cs info /Volumes/<your drive name> and look for Conversion State and LV Conversion Progress\n", "Q: Disk full; Terminal in Recovery mode won’t delete files; boot kernel panics I’m in a pickle here. macOS Mojave, just updated the other day. I managed to fill my disk up while creating a .dmg, and the system froze. I rebooted. Kernel panic.\nBoot to Recovery mode. Mount the disk. Open Terminal.\n–bash–3.2# rm /path/to/large/file\nrm: /path/to/large/file: No space left on device\n\nEssentially the same issue as this Unix thread from ‘08!\nhttps://www.unix.com/linux/69889-unable-remove-file-using-rm-disk-space-full.html\nI’ve tried echo x > /path/to/large/file, no good.\nIt’s borked. Does anyone have any suggestions that aren’t “wipe the drive and restore from your backup”?\n\nA: In spite this post is old, I decided to leave my solution here to help community with one more approach. \nnote: I wrote a medium with more description.\nIn my case, I din't have that extra partition available so, in recovery mode: \n\n\n*\n\n*Run the terminal\n \n\n*run diskutil list\n \n\n\n*Find the identifier of \"VM\" volume. In the case of the previous image is \"disk1s5\". You'll probably have \"disk2s4\"\n\n*delete the volume VM: \ndiskutil apfs deleteVolume disk1s5 \n(replace the disk1s5 for your VM identifier)\n\n\n*You are now able to remove files on \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\"\n\n\nI hope it helps someone.\n\nA: I am so lucky. Posting this to hopefully help others.\nI had partitioned my APFS volume, and was able to delete the non-boot partition. This gave the boot volume enough space, and I'm back up. I'll clean up the drive and restore that volume.\nI found a post on a ZFS forum that suggested that these new filesystems require some disk space to perform any disk operation. If you have 0% left, you're out of luck.\nAll other tricks to remove the file, to overwrite it with null data, failed.\ndd if=/dev/null of=/path/to/large/file failed. \ntrue |> /path/to/large/file (or something similar, I forget the exact command) failed.\nEverything failed, except booting in to Recovery mode and, without mounting any drives first, deleting the extra APFS partition.\nLesson: keep a ~100MB dummy partition (or just quota your main drive so it can't take up 100% of the physical disk) as your get-out-of-jail card.\nEdit: I actually mean that I had multiple APFS volumes on my boot partition, and that I deleted one of those volumes. Old language dies hard.\n\nA: On 10.14 (Mojave) I was able to recover from this situation by booting into recovery mode (hold Cmd+R on the chime) and then manually deleting a few large files.\nDespite several (older) pages on the Internet saying this doesn't work, it did and I'm writing this answer from that system, everything booted well afterwards and I've not seen any signs of corruption or data loss.\nThis might work because I remember that Unix systems reserve a bit of space and inodes for the superuser. Or it might simply be that single-user mode bypasses whatever causes rm to not work when the drive is full.\n\nA: Using recovery mode to remove some large files to free up disk space also works in 10.13.6 (High Sierra).  The steps are:\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into recovery mode (restart and immediately hold Cmd+R)\n\n*Open up a Terminal session from the top menu\n\n*Navigate to a folder containing some large files (e.g. /System/Users/xxxxxx/Downloads/ and remove them using rm -rf\n\n*Reboot\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Shuts down because of a problem This has happened twice in two weeks now.

Check the log files folder\nAccess ~/Library/Logs/Creative Cloud/Creative Cloud Libraries using the Go to Folder command.\nConfirm that the folder exists and you have write permissions for it.\n\nAs for the last loaded kernel com.apple.driver.usb.cdc.acm it is unclear to me how it get lounched (by whom) and why Adobe has a problem with it.\nYou do have the Intuos5 touch S that is a USB device that might be the one causing the problem.\nFollowing are NON Apple drivers loaded (that are not tested for interfering with OS X) that might need your attention.\ncom.getdropbox.dropbox.kext 1.8.8\ncom.google.dfsfuse.filesystems.dfsfuse 3.7.4\norg.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetAdp 5.0.0\norg.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetFlt 5.0.0\norg.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB 5.0.0\norg.virtualbox.kext.VBoxDrv 5.0.0\ncom.paragon-software.filesystems.ntfs 23.0.15\ntv.airbeam.driver.AirBeamTV 0.4.0\n\n", "Q: Wine issue: Can't quit out of application I tried running a windows game called KouKou Gurashi lately on my MacBook Air by going into 'Advanced' and putting the KouKou Gurashi.exe in.

Make sure you have nothing important open or any unsaved work before doing that.\n\nA: Try using Command Option esc to quit everything running and to restart finder. I've had that problem before, and if that doesn't work and you can't shut down/restart your computer, you're going to have to wait for the battery to die, or to open your computer up and disconnect the battery (which I don't suggest doing unless you've repaired a laptop before and have the correct tools)\n", "Q: how to set default all hotkey in mac I want to return default all keyboard hotkey\nNow my mac\ncommand + w is Screen Brightness up\ncommand + e is Screen Brightness down\nbut i want to command + w is close this app (default)\ncan anyone help me?\nMy karabiner\n\n\nA: You obviously mean: How do I do this with Karabiner Elements … ?!?\nFor one: \"Cmd-W\" is not default for closing apps, but \"Cmd-Q\" is.\nBut, if you really want \"Cmd-W\" to close an app, here is Karabiner Elements' code:\n{ \"title\": \"Make ''Cmd-W'' close the current app.\",\n  \"rules\": [\n     { \"description\": \"Makes ''Cmd-W'' the shortcut for closing apps.\",\n       \"manipulators\": [\n        { \"from\": { \"key_code\": \"w\",\n                    \"modifiers\": {\n                        \"mandatory\": [\"left_command\"] }\n                  },\n            \"to\":[\n                 { \"key_code\": \"q\",\n                   \"modifiers\": [\"left_command\"],\n                   \"repeat\": false }],\n          \"type\":  \"basic\"\n                }  \n            ]\n        }\n    ]    \n}\n\nCopy code to BBEdit (TextEdit) and save to ~/.config./karabiner/assets/complex_modifications as WhateverYouLike.json \nNext open KE, tab \"Complex Modifications\", click [+ Add rule] at bottom, scroll down to WhateverYouLike.json and click [+ Enable].\nThat should be it … KE's modifications work without restart.\n(Btw: the \"repeat\" part makes your shortcut close only ONE app, just to make sure …)\n", "Q: Mac keeps restarting with kernel panic \"UPSB thunderbolt power on failed\" Does anyone know what could be causing this?

Tried Beta and that made the problem only worse. I got the fix by resetting NVRAM and SMC.\nTo do so, shut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option ⌥ + Command ⌘ + P + R \nPlease try to reset yours to see if it resolves your issue.\n\nA: I had the same problem with:\n\n\n*\n\n*A MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) \n\n*Running on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6\nIt only happens when I had an external monitor connected and after waking-up the MBP after it goes to sleep (when both displays have turned off). (I'm not sure if it's relevant, but I'm using a Dell U2520D with its USB Type-C as the display connector.)\nThe only thing that \"fixed\" it was to prevent the hard disks from sleeping.\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences \n\n*Energy Saver \n\n*Uncheck\n\n\n*\n\n*Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off \n\n*Put hard disks to sleep whenever possible\n\n\nA: So, I had the same issue on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) running MacOs Mojave 10.14.2.\nAfter trying all sorts of solutions, some of them posted also here and on the official Apple Community thread (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8149427?page=1) that didn't help I solve the issue doing this. \nI have enrolled in the macOS Beta program and installed 10.14.3 Beta (18D38a).\nI'm running this for 2 days now and my laptop was in standby all this time without any reboots. \nI know is not the best option and maybe installing a beta will mess up with other stuff but for the moment I had no issues. \nAlso, installing a beta will give you the possibility to send feedback and maybe that one is more taken into consideration than any other reports you send when getting that stupid error.\n\nA: I had this issue with a new MacBook Pro 2019/20 16-inch Catalina 10.15.4 (19E287)\nIt would frequently crash on sleep or when the screen was locked with the same error \"thunderbolt power on failed\" logged, now solved! (at least for my case)\nThe fix was to disable the extra \"Thunderbolt Bridge\" service (used for direct Mac to Mac transfer over thunderbolt cable) in the Network Settings\nSystem Preferences > Network > Thunderbolt Bridge (right-click > Make Service Inactive)\n\nNote: the screenshot says \"make active\" because I already disabled it. Yours would say \"make inactive\"\nAfter that, no more random crashes/shutdowns on lock screen or sleep.\n\nA: I got resolved. Had the same issue with my MacBook pro-2017, another trait of it was that one of the thunderbolt ports didn't charge from the adapter. I did this:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your MacBook Pro computer.\n\n\n*Once turn off, Press and Hold at the same time: Shift + Control + Option + Power Button, for like 10 seconds. Nothing will happen on your screen, but it does all the cool stuff on the inside. It just like resets the energy flow on the circuits on the mainboard or something like that.\n\n\n*Release the 4 buttons at the same time.\n\n\n*Turn on your computer, log in, and try to connect something on the Thunderbolt port. It should work now...\n\nA: It's been a problem for me ever since upgrading my iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2017) to Big Sur. Now on Monterey. None of the fixes on this thread, or any other, has worked for me.\nThe only solution I've found that mitigates the problem is to avoid putting the Mac to sleep in the first place, by going to the Apple menu and using Lock Screen, instead of Sleep.\nI already require password to wake from sleep, so it makes no difference to my wake up routine.\nThe massive difference however, is my Mac doesn't fall over with the Thunderbolt issue when waking from the lock screen.\nI recommend you also turn off automatic sleeping in the energy saving settings (unless you want belt-and-braces for security, in case you might forget and walk away without locking the screen).\n", "Q: Karabiner Elements: Why is a series (or sequence/batch) of keys called in {…\"to\": …} only executed every second time? I used the original Karabiner app 10.22 and could very precisely restrict any actions via Apple's Accessibility Inspector to work for specific dialogue windows.\nThis is no longer possible with Karabiner Elements.\nSo in order to (in Safari) click the context menu's item \"Element Information\" (which I use very often) I tried this code in \"Complex Modifications\":\n \"to\": [ { \"pointing_button\": \"button2\" },\n         { \"key_code\": \"e\" },\n         { \"key_code\": \"return_or_enter\"}  ]\n\nWhich did work, but alternately only opened/showed the context menu or actually executed \"Element Information\".\nBy experimenting, I found a workaround that mostly works for me:\n\"parameters\": { \"basic.to_if_held_down_threshold_milliseconds\": 50 }, \n\"to\":       [ { \"pointing_button\": \"button2\" } ],\n\"to_if_held_down\":\n            [ { \"key_code\": \"e\" },\n              { \"key_code\": \"return_or_enter\"} ]\n\nMy questions:  \nWhy are not all \"commands\" in the first code example executed in due order (or: only alternately) and (more interestingly:) how can you ensure that each \"command\" is executed every time?\n\nA: I think your workaround perfectly demonstrates the reason: you are selecting \"Element information\" via the GUI, and the context menu may take a few milliseconds to be brought up. This isn't an issue with Karabiner specifically — if the E and return keycodes are sent instantaneously after right-clicking, the context menu may not be in focus yet, and they won't be directed appropriately.\nIn short, if you're making a GUI macro, you may need to wait for the GUI to respond.\nAs I see it, there are three possible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*simply add a brief delay, as you've done,\n\n*use an alternate tool (e.g. Keyboard Maestro) which allows you to pause until a certain condition is filled, or\n\n*use an alternate method of activating the desired outcome, i.e. something which doesn't rely on the graphical user interface at the user level, such as AppleScript (though I don't know if such an option exists for this specific goal).\n\n", "Q: Questions from trouble getting the UniFi Controller to work on macOS High Sierra + Server (port 8080 in use) After upgrading from Sierra+Server to High Sierra+Server I am running into the problem that port 8080 is occupied by default.

Also have iPad Pro 1st Gen also on iOS 12. \n\nA: There may be an issue with the actual calendars that you are displaying, and the default calendars associated with each device?\nI would check 2 things.\nFirst, the default calendar on your iOS device. Settings -> Calendar -> default Calendar (ensure it is iCloud)\nSecond, ensure that the calendar you are seeing in Calendar is your iCloud. In Calendar, tap “Calendars” at the bottom, and ensure iCloud is checked off\nNow when you create events, they should default to your iCloud account, and you should be able to add invitees and see their RSVP status\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: mSATA SSD via IDE-adapter in PowerBook G4 12” I have a beautiful PowerBook G4 12” 1 GHz PowerPC ((A1010 (EMC 1986)) here with a dead hard drive which I want to replace with a SSD.\nIs there any reason why a mSATA SSD (with mSATA to IDE adapter) would not work on this device?\n\nA: Those adapters should work in principle for PowerBooks of that glorious PowerPC era. \nAlthough you might want to doublecheck your exact model.\nApple PowerBook G4 1.0 12\" (DVI - Al) Specs\nIdentifiers: 12-Inch DVI - M9007LL/A* - PowerBook6,2 - A1010 - 1986\nApple PowerBook G4 1.33 12\" (Al) Specs\nIdentifiers: 12-Inch 1.33 GHz - M9183LL/A* - PowerBook6,4 - A1010 - 1986\nInitially I thought those models would still be limited to 120GB supported capacity, but some vendors offer up to 480GB for a model of that range.\nYou might also want to check whether it fits into your machine. But that shouldn't be a real problem. This one is reported as being used just the way you intend to: in a PowerBook G4, but sitting a little tight\n\nadaptare 46235 mSATA-SSD 2,5 Zoll IDE-Controller 44-Pin Adapter\n\n\nOr as experienced and friendly commentator John Keates says:\n\nI can confirm those adapters work. Also used a 1.8 to 2.5 adapter, a CF adapter (but that is easy) and SD adapter. Also one m2 adapter but only the sata variant; have not seen a NVMe to IDE adapter yet. \nMost issues were with unstable power for the adapter (resets during bootup) if it didn't have good DC-DC circuits on-board. There were a few where the adapter chip wouldn't allocate beyond 137GB, this is mostly because they completely emulate a disk and fake the on-disk format (but do pipe the data to the underlying disk just fine). There is an issue with some chipsets that don't do the right protocol switching on the IDE side, like going through PIO and DMA modes, but I haven't seen that type of issue for years. Note: last time I used such an adapter was about 4 years ago on OSX10.3 (iBook G4) \n\n", "Q: Is there anyway or work around to enjoy the dark mode feature of macOS Mojave without updating to it? I have an old iMac running macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 now it has many default extensions and services disabled to boost up the OS experience. \nEvery time I upgrade to a major OS release macOS changes everything to default and installs unnecessary things. These unnecessary things slows down my mac. But I love the new dark mode in macOS Mojave. I want the new dark colored dock with white outline and everything dark included in the latest update.\nBut, I don't want to fully upgrade to macOS Mojave. So, is there anyway or work around to enjoy the dark mode feature of macOS Mojave without updating to it?\n\nA: Briefly, no.\nWhy not install Mojave on a second drive (or just maintain a backup) so you can test things out with the new feature that shipped so you can revert as needed to your old system or data?\nThe framework and app updates to support this new feature are widely baked into the OS so you would need to have a poor excuse for dark mode by inverting the entire display using accessibility on High Sierra and lower.\n\nA: \n\"Every time I upgrade to a major OS release macOS changes everything\n  to default and installs unnecessary things. These unnecessary things\n  slows down my mac.\"\n\nSimply running the MacOS installer for a new version should not change any settings, defaults or options. (Maybe the Desktop image, but that's about it.) Unless you do a clean install, but that's nearly always unnecessary.\nSecondly, merely having things installed on your disk (particularly OS-installed things) does not slow your Mac down.\nHopefully, this answers your question by assuaging your worries about installing Mojave. \n", "Q: How can I run \"say --output-file\" without it hanging (and worse) with more than 310 bytes of input? For my non-commercial curiosity, I'm interested in turning some of Lewis Carroll's work into machine-generated speech.

I've been unable to make say hang.\nPerhaps say is choking on something in lewis-carroll.txt (but only when sending the output to a file, which seems odd)?\nTwo ideas off the top of my head to work around this, if the above doesn't help...\n\n\n*\n\n*Send one sentence to say at a time, then recombine the output files.\n\n*Or, have say send to the audio output device, but record that with eg Audio Hijack.\n(Nicely written question, by the way: lots of relevant detail, concisely presented.)\n", "Q: Re-upgrade to macOS Mojave (esp. parts relating to iCloud) without loosing data, etc So my iCloud setup is brokenly, apparently because an incomplete macOS Mojave upgrade (from High Sierra). How can I \"re-upgrade\" to (reinstall) Mojave without loosing my existing data (e.g. in /Users/) and applications (e.g. /Applications/Audio\\ Hijack.app/)?\nFor instance, is Command + R on startup (then \"Reinstall macOS\") the right entry point, or can I just repeat the part of the installation that is concerned with iCloud?\n\nA: In response to the original question:\nYou can't just select parts of the system software to reinstall; you have to reinstall all of it but that shouldn't affect your mac.\nTo clarify about reinstalls/clean installs:\nAs far as I know/can remember there isn't an \"option\" to just reinstall/repair install mac os.\nApple actually make it simple - if you boot to recovery mode (hold command and r while restarting on mojave (especially with an apfs formatted drive- holding alt down to select the recovery drive doesn't display the recovery drive to select it anymore)). When the screen loads up and you select install mac os, if you select your drive with an existing install of mac os on then it will just reinstall the system files (including ONLY the apple software (terminal, textedit, iTunes, etc) BUT won't touch your data files, user accounts or the applications that you installed yourself and they should work as before).\nIF you want to do a clean install (removing all of your own data and applications) you must first select disk utility, select your drive and erase it/format it. THEN it will install just the mac os and everything will be like factory default settings.\n\nA: Without knowing the root cause of your iCloud issues it‘s impossible to say what exactly will help to solve it. You can reinstall macOS Mojave from Recovery (Cmd-R), and there is an option to install it without deleting your data. Whether this will solve your issues remains to be determined. And, as far as I know, there is no way of rerunning just parts of the installation. \nPS: As always making a backup of your data before upgrading is highly recommended. \n\nA: !!! aha !!! I finally fixed this from the Terminal:\ndefaults delete com.apple.iTunes MacBuddyStoreID\n\nNow iCloud has stopped complaining about my partially set up iCloud account.\nprobably got set when I migrated my account.\nThe way I tracked this down was by entering these commands:\ndefaults read > ~/defaultsDump.txt\nedit ~/defaultsDump.txt\n\n(Note: for me, this creates a huge 30MB text file.)\nthen searched ~/defaultsDump.txt for my email address that iCloud somehow got a hold of.\nFound the MacBuddyStoreID in com.apple.iTunes!\nEDIT\nMy defaultsDump.txt also reveals that 2 different email addresses are involved.\nIt also pointed me towards a problem in my Keychain after migrating.\nI think I've completely solved it now, by deleting ancient keys for an old email address from Keychain Access.app\n", "Q: Trying to remove Chess.app using terminal The title says it all. Can I use sudo rm -r or sudo rm -f?\n\nA: There seem to be several questions hidden in your post: \n\n\n*\n\n*You can‘t remove Chess.app (or any other of the applications installed as part of macOS) without disabling SIP. \n\n*if you are short on disk space look for things which use a lot of space, not for small applications\n\n*rm -f is used to remove several files and ignore any errors which might occur\n\n*rm -r is used to remove folders and their content (recursively)\n\n", "Q: Can't log in into iCloud after installing macOS Mojave on MacBook Pro 2013 Retina I updated my MacBook Pro to macOS Mojave. Everything was working fine except iCloud, it was not synchronizing data. \nSo I thought I sign out and back in. \nBut if I try to sign in, the wheel spins, and after a while it goes back to the original screen where you have to enter your Apple ID without error message.\nAfter trying a restart, deleting cache etc. I created a new user, here everything is working.\nBut I want it working with my original account with all my data.\nThere seems to be a problem with some keychain file:\n\n\nA: Since you have confirmed that a new user can sign in, your next step is unfortunately to engage Apple technical support. \nYou’ve ruled out date and time errors, an error on the network and an error on the cloud side of your account that’s like a lockdown or other massive error. You should expect to be requested to make a support pin to indicate that you allow Apple engineers to support you with your personal data. \n", "Q: Terminal command to remove custom icon from file (HFS+) Context\nIn Mac OS X / macOS you can select a file in the Finder, click Informations then click the icon, and paste any image/icon that is in the clipboard. Now this file has a custom icon made of this image.\nTo remove it, the usual way is to select the file, click Informations, select the custom icon then hit delete and it removes the custom icon, restoring the default one.\nQuestion\nIs there a way to remove these custom icons from these files without having to open a Finder window? For example with a Terminal command?\nWhy\nA file has a corrupted custom icon, opening the Finder in this folder causes the Finder to beachball and the HDD to freak out. But I still can access the folder content, and this file, from the command line, if I don't first open a Finder window. So I'm thinking that I \"just\" need to access the metadata differently to remove the custom icon.\n\nA: For files with a custom icon, macOS writes the icon data as a resource fork to the file.  Use the xattr command in the following form:\nxattr -d com.apple.ResourceFork /path/to/filename\n\nFor more information about the xattr command, in Terminal type the following command and press: enter\nman xattr\n\nOr just type xattr and then right-click on it and select: Open man Page\n\nFor folders with custom icon, in Terminal, change directory to the folder containing the custom icon, e.g.:\ncd /path/to/foo\n\nOnce in the directory, use the following command to remove the custom icon:\nrm Icon?\n\nNote that you can also just use:\nrm /path/to/foo/Icon?\n\nHowever, you cannot use quotes, single or double, if the pathname has spaces and must escape the spaces with a backslash, \\, e.g.:\nrm /path/to/foo\\ bar/Icon?\n\nQuoting the pathname will just return the following error:\n: No such file or directory\n\nBy default, Icon? is a hidden file and the ? in Icon? is actually a linefeed, \\n, character.\n\nA: An alternative is to use SetFile to flip the file's \"custom icon\" bit off:\nSetFile -a c /path/to/file\n\nOne difference between this and xattr -d com.apple.ResourceFork is the xattr -d destroys the image data in the file's resource fork, whereas SetFile leaves the data in place. If you leave the data in place, you can restore the custom icon later, like so:\nSetFile -a C /path/to/file # note the lettercase\n\nIf you want, you can extract the custom icon into a separate file before removing it completely from the file:\nDeRez -only icns /path/to/file > extracted.rsrc\n\n(Note that this copies the data out. You'd still need to delete the embedded icon using xattr.)\nI should also note that xattr -d leaves the \"custom icon\" bit set on, meaning that if you ever insert new icns data into the file's resource fork, it will show through immediately. So, I think if you really want to make the file as vanilla as possible, you should do both: delete the fork, and unset the custom bit. (But I really don't know if it matters.)\n(BTW, you can insert custom icon data like so:)\nRez -append icon.rsrc -o /path/to/file\n\n", "Q: iPhone how to disable “No speakable content can be found on the screen” My phone randomly pops up “No speakable content can be found on the screen”. In response to some gesture. How do I disable this feature completely?\n\nA: Go to Settings → General → Accessibility → Speech and turn off Speak Screen.\nThis disables the two finger swipe down gesture from the top of the screen, which will speak content on the screen or show the message you're getting if there is no speakable content.\n", "Q: Orange light on charger but MacBook Air won' t turn on First my MBA was working great, but suddenly my charger wouldn't work anymore (no light when plugged in.)\nThen the MBA, not charged, entered a dead state. I bought a new charger after 2 months and when plugged in, the light turns orange but the MBA won't turn on. I left it charging all night but light still orange. After I reset the SMC, the charger light goes green for 2 seconds, but nothing happens. I have an A1466 MBA from 2013. \nThanks so much for the help. \n\nA: The behaviour you mentioned when performing SMC is normal. When performed the charging indicator will flash green to indicate the SMC reset was recognized. This generally indicates the MagSafe board is communicating correctly with the logic board.\nAn internal component such as the logic board, battery, or PCIe cards may have failed. That may need to be diagnosed and replaced\n", "Q: Unable to boot Kali linux using rEFInd I am currently trying to install and boot Kali Linux on my MacBook Pro 2018 which has the new T2 chip with boot security.\nI have disabled both SIP and Secure Boot on my Mac as well as installing rEFInd on my computer with the instructions of this post.\nWhen I boot into rEFInd, I am greeted with this window:\n\nThe first drive that you see just brings me to a blank screen with a no entry sign, the second option allows me to boot to macOS High Sierra (I do not want to upgrade to macOS Mojave right now) and then the third option is my Kali Linux install disk.\nThe problem is, when I boot to Kali Linux (File name is) kali-linux-2018.3a-amd64, I end up getting this error:\n\nWhy is this happening and what do I need to do in order to sort this out?

Macros to speed up things:\n\nIntroduction\nGenerally, you get the same results importing on the target computer and exporting on the source computer when you exchange text files between Word for the Macintosh and Word for Windows. It is not quite true when your file contains graphics. We found that the conversion modules of Word for the Macintosh do a better work converting to and from the Word for Windows files than the modules of Word for Windows.\nWord for the Macintosh\nFrom version 6, Word files are identical (binary compatible) on the PC and on the Macintosh. There should be no more conversion problems. However, you should note that the migration to Word 6 doesn't proceed so fast on the Macintosh because the perceived advantages of this move are not blatant. Word 6 is pretty slow, even on a Power Mac. If you have to give a Word file to a Macintosh user, you better give her/him a Word 5 file. If you know that the file will be mounted in a DTP package, you should definitively give a Word 4/5 file. Adobe and Quark had a hard work to produce usable import filters for Word 6.   \nWord 5 for the Macintosh opens all PC Word formats up to Word Windows 2. Word 4 for the Macintosh only imports the Word DOS files. All versions of Word for the Macintosh can export to Word DOS (3/4/5).   \nIdentification codes of Word for the Macintosh versions 1, 3, 4 et 5:\n  FE 32 for Word 1\n  FE 34 for Word 3\n  FE 37 for Word 4 et 5.\n  Word 3 is not supported any more in Word for Windows 6 and higher. You therefore have to open the files in a more recent version of Word for the Macintosh and resave in Word 5 or 6.\nIf you get incorrect accented characters opening some Word DOS files in Word Mac 5 (it never happened with Word Mac 4), you should know that Word Mac 5 insists on getting a correct code page at the end of the file header. Word 5/5.5 on the PC put this code at the right place, but it is not the case of Word DOS 3/4 and of some conversion packages (main culprit: Wordperfect). You will have to open the files with a binary editor and put B5 and 01 (437 in little-endian) at offsets 7E and 7F of the Word file.\nWord on the PC\nWord for Windows 2 can import Word Mac 4/5. As a matter of fact, it is even the best revision level to exchange data between platforms and you should get back to it if you encounter problems (mostly with version 6). Word for Windows (versions 2/6/7) can't import files created in Word 3 for the Macintosh. It is hard to ascertain the origin of those files because the signature is the same for Word 3, 4 and 5 ('MSWDWDBN'). If you use an hex editor, look at the second byte of the file. If you have 34h, it is a Word 3, if 37h, Word 4/5.\nWord for Windows 6 uses the same binary format as Word 6 for the Macintosh. When you get errors opening Macintosh Word 5/6 files in WinWord 6 (accented characters, corrections which don't make it to the disk) with the saved and reopened file, you will have to proceed that way: reopen the original Macintosh file, select the whole file, go in the 'Tools' menu and check the language you want. Go in the 'File' menu and check the paper format in the 'Layout' item. We observed that WinWord 6 often messed with these two parameters.\nWord 3/4/5/5.5 for DOS can't handle Macintosh Word files. But Word for the Macintosh can save as Word DOS files.\nConversion Macrocommands\nYou will find below three Word macros to automatically save in Word Mac 5 from WinWord 2, 6 and 97. The two macros for Word 2/6 are still in French, but you should not have big problems to rewrite them in English. The main difficulty is not to save in a specific format, but to get the filename in a variable of the macro. We found the trick of the dialogbox 'Statistics'. Maybe there are others. If you do the work of porting this macro in English, please send it to us. It will surely help some users. It should not be difficult. Just register a macro while getting the character count and saving the file under another format.\nMacro to save in Word Mac 4/5 from Word Windows 97\n\nSub SaveMac5()\n'\n' SaveMac5 Macro\n' (c) 1999 Pierre Duhem\n'\nDim nomfich, nomfich2 As String\nDim lg As Integer\nnomfich = ActiveDocument.Name\nlg = Len(nomfich)\nnomfich2 = Left(nomfich, lg - 3) + \"mcw\"\nActiveDocument.SaveAs FileName:=nomfich2, FileFormat:=108, _\n    LockComments:=False, Password:=\"\", AddToRecentFiles:=True, WritePassword _\n    :=\"\", ReadOnlyRecommended:=False, EmbedTrueTypeFonts:=False, _\n    SaveNativePictureFormat:=False, SaveFormsData:=False, SaveAsAOCELetter:= _\n    False\nActiveDocument.Close\nEnd Sub\n\nMacro to save in Word Mac 4/5 from Word Windows 6\n\nSub MAIN\n'Macro saving the current file in Word Mac 5, extension \"mcw\"\n'Version for Word Windows 6\nDim nom$\nDim dlg1 As StatistiquesDocument\nDim dlg2 As FichierEnregistrerSous\nFichierRésumé .MiseAJour\nGetCurValues dlg1\nnom$ = dlg1.NomFichier\npos = InStr(nom$, \".\")\nnom$ = Left$(nom$, pos) + \"mcw\"\nFichierEnregistrerSous .Nom = nom$, .Format = RechercheConvertisseur (\"MSWordMac\")\nFichierFermer (2)\nEnd Sub\n\nMacro to save in Word Mac 4/5 from Word Windows 2\n\nSub MAIN\n'Macro saving the current file in Word Mac 5, extension \"mcw\"\n'Version for Word Windows 2\nDim nom$\nDim dlg1 As StatistiquesDocument\n'To get statistics, character count, etc.\nDim dlg2 As FichierEnregistrerSous\n'to save as...\nFichierEnregistrer\nGetCurValues dlg1\nnom$ = dlg1.NomFich\npos = InStr(nom$, \".\")\nnom$ = Left$(nom$, pos) + \"mcw\"\nFichierEnregistrerSous .Nom = nom$, .Format = 109, .VerrouillerSaufAnnotations = 0, .MotDePasse = \"\" \n\nFichierFermer\nEnd Sub\n\n\nOther options to consider might be:\nTrying LibreOffice and hope it does a decent job at conversion. \nRunning (the now abandoned and not legally availabe and not working on Mac Os X Lion 10.7 or higher) MacLinkPlus program.

I see similar display when I connect to the external monitor using Displayport.\nI searched through the forums and I tried below approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*forcing to RGB mode as explained here: https://www.mathewinkson.com/2013/03/force-rgb-mode-in-mac-os-x-to-fix-the-picture-quality-of-an-external-monitor.  \n\n*enabling/disabling _LCD Font Smoothing\n\n*Setting various values to AppleFontSmoothing \n(i.e. running the command defaults write -g AppleFontSmoothing 2)\n\n*Restart the machine multiple times, resetting NVRAM and SMC settings\n\n*Open the app in low resolution mode\n\n\nBut none of these steps helped, and fonts on my external display still appear fuzzy. I understand that in the external monitor the fonts can't appear as crisp they are on built in display. But I didn't expect the fonts to appear fuzzy on the external monitor. FWIW I was using a Macbook with out retina display prior to switching to this model, and didn't had any issues with display of fonts in the external monitor as I am currently facing.\nIs there a solution to make the fonts to appear without any fuzziness apart from buying a new external monitor ?\n\nA: This is the solution, It really worked for my 1920x1200 old monitor \nJust follow the steps I made, because original receipt has some inaccuracies\n", "Q: LibreOffice doesn't have an icon In the application menu LibreOffice has no icon. How can I add it to it?\n\n\nA: The Icon shown is the LibreOffice icon. \n\nA: What you are seeing is in fact the correct icon for the LibreOffice suite.\nTo make it explicit, here's the full set of the application icons of the LibreOffice suite, together with the LibreOffice icon itself on top (image taken from their website):\n\nNotice how the top icon, the LibreOffice general icon, is the same \"empty document\" icon as you have on your desktop. And here's the logo from their web page:\n\n\nA: If you would like to change the icon anyway, you can change the icon of any app in one of two ways (although there may be more ways to do this):\nManually\n\n\n*\n\n*Find an app in the Finder, usually in your /Applications/ folder.\n\n*Click on it and press ⌘I to bring up the Information panel\n\n*Drag the icon file you want to use onto the application's current icon on the top left.\n\n\nNote: step 3 will only work if you have an .icns file. If you have a .png file (most common) which you would like to use as your application's icon, perform the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the image you want to use with Preview\n\n*Press ⌘A to \"select all\" of the image in Preview\n\n*Press ⌘C to copy the image\n\n*Go back to the information panel and click on the application's current icon on the top left\n\n*Press ⌘V to paste the image.\n\n\nIf you would like to restore the application's original icon, simply click on the application's icon in the Info panel and press ⌘⌫. This will remove the custom icon.\nUsing a Program\nIf you want to do this for many applications, or you need to do this relatively often for a program which keeps on resetting its icon due to frequent updates or any other reason, you can save a lot of time using a free, lightweight tool called LiteIcon. \nAs with the manual method, to restore any application's original icon, simply click on the application's icon in the Info panel and press ⌘⌫. Alternatively you can go into LiteIcon and drag a custom icon \"off\" an app, which will also restore the original icon.\n\nA: I concur; the generic document icon for LibreOffice on macOS is confusing to see in the Dock. What I have done is replace it with this distinctive icon. Hope this helps.  https://iconarchive.com/show/red-orb-alphabet-icons-by-iconarchive/Letter-L-icon.html\n", "Q: Is dGPU disabler permanent on 2011 MBP? I've found this tool (http://dosdude1.com/gpudisable/) to disable dedicated GPU on my MBP late 2011 (I just bought it from eBay). The Mac has no problems right now but it's just preventive. I will only using it to browse the web and do some VM stuff, and I don't need extra GPU power.\nIs it permanent (except when upgrading macOS) or semi permanent like some other solutions I've seen on the Internet (will the Mac reuse the dGPU after some reboot)? \n\nA: That solution provided by dosdude1 is a combined package of software and hardware. The software part is of course reversible, and the hardware part of course not. Not easily at least.\nWith that hardware solution you will also have to take an extra step, as it will disable brightness control. That makes the hardware solution less desirable for a working MacBook.\nIf the MacBook will eventually fail, then that solution by dosdude1 is the second best option overall, right after replacing the chip itself with a working one from a line of known-good production.\nAs long as the machine does work, I'd say leave it at that. Do not disable the dGPU preemptively.\nPreventive mesasures to prolong its life would be to increase the fan speed and other measures to increase cooling. That would include not using Thunderbolt and especially not an external monitor. You may also use gfxCardStatus to avoid switching to the dGPU as far as possible. \nIf you insist on preemptively just disabling the dGPU you may also want to look at this option: GPU problem - Boot Hangs on Grey Screen\n\nA: \nreplacing the chip itself with a working one from \n  a line of known-good production\n\nSo last time mine failed, this was the (third party repair shop) replacement.

I'm an IT person (but mostly work in the Windows world), and am trying to help a friend.  This friend had an iPhone 7 (probably 128 GB) and recently upgraded to an iPhone X.  Unfortunately, it seems the person at the phone store screwed up helping them, and I'm thinking that they probably restored an older iCloud backup to the new phone.  The reason I think this is because there's about a year's worth of photos that are missing on the new iPhone X.  I happened to have a spare iPhone 8 64 GB temporarily laying around, so I did an iCloud restore of their most recent iPhone 7 backup to this phone and found all of their \"missing\" photos.  Unfortunately, the problem now is that as the iCloud backup attempted to restore everything to this temporary iPhone 8, it ran out of space.  I don't know enough about the workings of iCloud (restores, iCloud Photos, etc.) so am at a loss now as to the easiest way to transfer these \"missing\" photos to my friend's new iPhone X (especially in light of the fact that the temporary iPhone 8 is out of space and didn't finish downloading everything from the iCloud backup). \nI was thinking maybe of trying to upload all the photos to Google Photos, or maybe letting it sync to a computer and then do something from there.  I'm not sure, but it seems there is some sort of iCloud Photos repository in iCloud that allows photos/videos to be uploaded and stored in iCloud (my friend has a few hundred GB that he pays for) and then synchronized with multiple devices (similar to Google Photos), but I can't figure out how to get these \"missing\" photos to that easily (I'm thinking maybe they haven't synchronized to that yet because the iCloud backup restore never finished...?).

You can signup here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/premium\nThe price is currently 11.99$ per month.\nA free method of achieving something similar is to use a non-Safari browser such as Opera Mini, and open youtube.com in that browser. Start the video, exit the browser and the audio stops. Then swipe up from the bottom to access the Control Center, you'll see playback controls in there for the YouTube contents. Press play to keep the audio playing.\n\nA: Yes you can. First of all download Firefox browser for iOS. Then navigate to youtube.com and play some video. Hit the browser's menu button (sitting in top left corner as of Aug 19), then hit 'Request desktop site'. When the browser will reload the page play the video again, then activate notification center (not the control center) by swiping from the top edge of the screen (works for pre X iPhones, I don't know how to activate notification center on X and later). You will see rewind and pause controls. Lock the phone. The video will stop playing. Now press the lock or the home button. The controls will pop again. Now you press Play button and that's it.

I have been installing some popular software for Mac and observed that installation packages do not create a desktop shortcut as they often do on windows.\nWhat is good practice to follow: Should I create a desktop shortcut for my application which i have developed?\n\nA: As a Mac user for some years, I don't recall for any app that creates desktop shortcut after installation. I believe this practice is more familiar for users that come from a Windows environment for the first time, but definitely this is not a good approach, not because of the memory or cpu usage, but for the multiple ways you can access to your apps in MacOS, which are more efficient and elegant.\n\nA: I would say desktop alias creation at install time for an app is an anti-pattern and bad practice for developers to implement as default behavior. \n\n\n*\n\n*The desktop belongs to the end user and macOS is designed to install apps for every user account and to consider more than one user per computer. To accomplish this, you’re either escalating the installer to root privileges to change multiple desktops or you’re ignoring / short cutting the way apps can (or possibly should) get installed for all subsequent users.\n\n*The launchpad and dock and spotlight / Siri are the bespoke app launch tools and idioms so you can assume your customers are very familiar with how to start an app they just chose to install.\n\n\nThe most kind way to do this would be to onboard the user and ask if they want any shortcuts the first time they launch the app. Apple recommends you have a very light onboarding, so even this is against \"best practice\" but I would see it as the best way to make an alias if you feel it's the right call for the majority of the users of your app.\nI would encourage you to read over the HIG - Human Interface Guidelines and the many free WWDC videos on app packaging and installation - your question is a good one and thinking how people see your app during installation is super helpful to make your app succeed with many customers.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/\n\nA: This answer was written before the clarification that the OP is from a developer perspective, not end user\nI've always been firmly of the school of \"nothing on the desktop\" personally - but each to his/her own.\nYou can find apps to launch in one of at least 6 ways...\n\n\n*\n\n*The Apple  Menu > Recent Items\n\n*The Applications folder itself\n\n*LaunchPad\n\n*Spotlight\n\n*Drag the App to the Dock\n\n*Double-click any document & the relevant app will launch, or right-click Open With > for a list of alternatives which can handle that document type.\nSo many alternatives that it doesn't feel necessary to clutter the desktop with another.\nHowever, it's your machine - do as you wish ;-)\n\nA: Yes, use the Dock.  You will probably have to drag the application icon onto it to add it, though.\nIf you want the icons to always appear, in the Dock control panel uncheck the list item \"Automatically hide and show the Dock\".\n\nA: Frankly, this comes down to your personal preference. There is no bad or good practice really when using desktop shortcuts.\nGenerally on Mac, you would use the dock\nHowever, feel free to add your icons directly onto the desktop space. Personally, I use my desktop simply for projects that I am working on at the time, everything else is filed away appropriately. So if I have a job that I am working on, that file structure will be easily accessible through my desktop.\nMy Current Desktop Layout\n\n\nA: As others have said, placing commonly-used applications on the dock is the way most Mac users deal with this, often in conjunction with Spotlight (Cmd-Space) to open less frequently-used applications.\nIf the dock isn't big enough for you, check out Launchpad, which is in your Applications folder. You can configure a keyboard shortcut to open it (in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts), and it shows you a grid of launch icons for all your installed applications, much like an iPhone home screen, which you can rearrange as you see fit. Most long-time Mac users don't use or like it much, but if you're used to having shortcuts for everything on your desktop rather than using the Windows Start menu, it might work for you.\nYou can also access something more like a Start menu by adding the Applications folder to your dock, then right-clicking it and selecting \"Show Contents as List\". Then whenever you click it in future, you'll see a menu of all your installed applications that you can click to launch.\n\nA: No. You should just copy the app to /Applications (or ~/Applications), and let the user choose if they want to create a shortcut in the dock or somewhere else.\nA lot of the time, \"installers\" in macOS are just disk images (dmg files) containing the app itself and a shortcut to the Applications folder. The user can choose to drag the app there, or anywhere else.\n\nA: I like an uncluttered desktop and Dock, and have used MoofMenu for years to allow easy access to various applications, utilities, and documents. MoofMenu places a Dogcow icon in the menubar. Here's mine:\n\nEach of MoofMenu's items and lists and individual items are cascading and user-configurable, and easily reached quickly with the mouse or trackpad. I have more items in these menus that appear in the Dock, but fewer than are stored in SSD/Applications folder. \nIf you're very facile with navigation-by-keyboard in Finder windows, you can probably access items more quickly that way. But I'm not that good, and I enjoy seeing and easily choosing from a list of items that includes perhaps 95% of my regular targets. \nIIRC, cascading menus were introduced in Mac OS 9. I found them very useful then, and with MoofMenu still very useful now.\n\nA: The Desktop is Dead\nIt has been dead for decades, but thanks to the purveyors of OSs and naive users, it remains as a killer zombie.\nReasons NOT to use the desktop\n\n*\n\n*You can't organize by date, size, and all the other attributes you can in a Finder or Explorer window\n\n*You can't even see the entire file name if it's long\n\n*At least in Windows, there's an annoying overlay of \"Public\" and personal desktops, which makes tracking down the actual file a royal pain\n\n*Apps belong in Apps or ProgramFiles directories.  Period.\n\n*the Desktop is not navigable the way a Finder/Explorer window is, nor  does it have quick-navigation sidebar.\n\nReasons TO use the desktop\n\n*\n\n*Idiot developers put a link icon there\n\n*You never learned that directory windows (Finder/Explorer) exist.\n\n*You like wasting minutes trying to find the icon you want, especially as it blends into that funky background art you put on your desktop.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Intel AMT to manage MacBooks? https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-active-management-technology.html\nI've heard MacBook intel chips are AMT-capable, but AMT isn't ever enabled so you can't actually use it.

For example, if I have a Wi-Fi-only iPad, and I add a new Wi-Fi network name/password to my iPhone, then the iPad has no way of getting that information sync'd to it until it connects to a Wi-Fi network.\nHence my suggestion of connecting the iPad first, because the iPhone has its own non-Wi-Fi network connection with which it can sync new iCloud information.\n(The same would be true if you replaced 'iPad' with 'MacBook' in the above examples.)\n", "Q: Font Family/Display Issue in Safari 12 on macOS Mojave I just upgraded to macOS Mojave a few days ago and I have noticed an issue with the fonts displayed in Safari for sites/themes that I have created on Tumblr.\nIt appears that Safari reverted back to the default of Times New Roman and I'm not sure why; this is only an issue in Safari.

Previously I would just hit the red X to close it when I was done messaging for the moment. The program however would remain open, just hidden. Now, after I hit the red X, within a few to perhaps 30 seconds, the Messages app closes completely (I can tell because the indicator dot on the Dock goes away). As a result, when I relaunch it, it takes an extra second or two (this can add up), and it sometimes opens in a different location than where it was before.

Is there any way to get it back to just appearing all at once so I can see it?\n\nA: As of now, on iOS 12.0, this is not something that can be altered. It was part of the update, and it unfortunately does not have a way of being changed back to the original format.\n", "Q: Is it possible to restore a macbook pro to an earlier date without an external hard drive backup? I've read that \"Time Machine\" is the appropriate tool for restoring a Mac to an earlier state.  Time Machine requires the use of some external storage device.\nIf I remember correctly from Windows, you could revert the state of your computer to a previously set \"restore point\" -- even without the use of an external storage device.  Does this possibility exist in macOS?\n\nA: Time Machine doesn't require an external drive but it does require a dedicated partition. Without more info about your system its hard to be more specific. If you have an internal drive with little or nothing on it you can partition that drive and use one of the partitions for Time Machine, given its big enough. Setting partitions will erase the drive.\nWhy are you avoiding an external drive? I use an external drive for my time machine and it works fine. If its due to the time involved there are workarounds for that.\n\nA: I would highly recommend using an external drive as it is easier and protects your data better in case your internal drive gets corrupted or breaks. If you can't, you can still partition your internal drive or use snapshots.\nIf you have an APFS drive, you could use APFS snapshots which are a lot easier to do. You can check if you have an APFS drive with this, otherwise you can use partitioning:\nPartitioning shouldn't delete any data, but just in case, it's a good idea to temporarily backup your important data before proceeding.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n*Select your hard drive in the Disk Utility window. It should be the first drive in the list and it'll probably be named \"Macintosh HD.\"\n\n*Click on the \"Partition\" tab and click the \"+\" button.\n\n*Adjust the size of the new partition with the resize controls.\n\n*Name the partition and click apply\n\n\nThe new partition should now show up when choosing a drive to backup to in Time Machine.\nSource\n\nA: Mac OS does have the ability to do this. However, some specific criteria are required before it can be used.\n\n\n*\n\n*The drive must be formatted as APFS. (This is the default if you have a recent version of Mac OS installed on a Mac which has an SSD.)\n\n*Time Machine must be enabled.\n\n\nOnce those two things are true, then Mac OS will periodically create “snapshots” which are (as far as I can tell) very similar to Windows’ “restore point”.\nThey can be used to restore a Mac to a previous state. I know because I did this myself a few weeks ago when I woke up and my Mac wouldn’t boot.\nThese “snapshots” are stored on the local SSD, and can be seen by using the tmutil command in Terminal.app:\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n\nYou can even tell Mac OS to create a snapshot by issuing this command, again in Terminal.app:\ntmutil localsnapshot\n\nHow many snapshots you can have on your Mac depends on the amount of diskspace used and how much has changed on your drive.\nThis is a fairly new feature, and I would not want to rely on it, but it can be a life-saver in the right situation.\nStill, your best bets remain:\n\n\n*\n\n*A complete, bootable backup via SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner\n\n*Time Machine\n\n*A remote backup. (I use Backblaze.)\nIn addition, I store all my important and currently-in-use files on Dropbox. Dropbox isn’t a backup solution, but it does keep revisions of your files for the past 30 days (or 120 on the pro accounts) and updates every time you hit “save” (assuming you have a network connection), so it may be the best bet to recover that file you were working on when your computer died suddenly.\n\nA: Unfortunately the Windows \"restore point\" is something that Windows does when updating itself and not really a backup program and can't be used as such.\nAnd to add insult to injury macOS does not have that ability or a built-in function to uninstall apps, drivers and other low level programs. One of the very few things from Windows that I wish Apple had copied.\nTime machine uses external storage. usually an external (usually USB, also sometimes network connected) drive that you connect regularly, or leave connected, that automatically backs up your Mac. But you need that drive and you need to have been using it. After the fact is too late.\nThere are data recovery tools and companies that can recover lost data but they all depend on minimal to no use of the system so the missing data is not overwritten.\n", "Q: How can I install this script as a folder action?

This happens when the user elects to edit the suggested filename and provides an invalid name.  The script will ask for the new filename to be validated by showing the dialog a second time (so far, this is all normal, and entirely what should happen).  However, when the user then selects to disregard the naming criteria and use this name anyway, the file is renamed and the script is triggered again.  This brings up the dialog for a third time, which isn't what we want to be happening ideally, but is unavoidable.\n(This isn't an issue when files are renamed to a validated filename, as the script—although executed twice regardless—doesn't do anything for filenames that don't require changing.)\nFor the reason above, I would advise you to consider implementing your folder action slightly differently, and have files moved to a new output folder before they get renamed.  This is very easy to do by adding a line before set item f's name to... that looks something like this:\nmove item f to the outputFolder\n\nwhere you will have defined outputFolder as a property or a variable at the start of the script that points to the location of where the output folder exists (preferably as an alias), e.g.:\nset outputFolder to POSIX file \"/Users/%you%/My Watched Folder/Processed Files\" as alias\n\nBut, for now, I have written the script to do what you wanted.  I'm assuming that there aren't going to be many instances where you will want to disregard your own naming criteria, so the \"three-dialog\" phenomenon may not ever arise, or be little more than irksome when it does.\n\nTo install a script as a folder action, I'll direct you to the first part of my previous answer, which I've transferred in below.\nFolder Actions\nA folder action can be created in one of two ways: via Automator, or by way of a folder action script.\n\nFor information on how to create a folder action script, which I would say is probably the more suitable solution in this case, you may wish to read the Mac Automation Scripting Guide - Watching Folders, which details how to do this.\nThe section titled Attaching a Folder Action Script to a Folder is the most pertinent to the task.\n", "Q: How to override DNS resolver ordering while connected to L2TP VPN OS: macOS Mojave 10.14 (18A389)\nCurrent network setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Local domain: home.rossipedia.com\n\n*Subnet: 172.16.10.0/24\n\n*Gateway / DHCP server / DNS server: 172.16.10.1\nOutput of scutil --dns:\nDNS configuration\n\nresolver #1\n  search domain[0] : home.rossipedia.com\n  nameserver[0] : 172.16.10.1\n  if_index : 21 (en8)\n  flags    : Request A records\n  reach    : 0x00020002 (Reachable,Directly Reachable Address)\n\nresolver #2\n  domain   : local\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  flags    : Request A records\n  reach    : 0x00000000 (Not Reachable)\n  order    : 300000\n\n...

I upgraded my laptop to Mojave. For years, my backup strategy has included using rsync (MacPorts rsync 3.1.3) to copy files to a file server. This stopped working properly, now showing some errors indicating permission problems with opendir and get_xattr_data, specifically with certain ~/Library folders.\nI use launchd to run rsync inside a script located in /usr/local/bin.\nAs part of my troubleshooting, I went into Terminal and su'd to root. Then cd'd to my user's ~/Library and tested access in some of the folders. The system reported permission denied.\nThrough Security & Privacy, I gave rsync Full Disk Access, but that didn't resolve the issue.\nI'm assuming this is an issue resulting from Mojave's security or privacy settings as I've never seen root not have permission to files. In order to resume my backup processes, I need root/launchctl to be able to access files. \nWhat has changed in Mojave that is limiting root's access?\nHow do I mitigate this limitation as it relates to rsync? \n\nThe possible duplicate seems to confirm the need to adjust settings in Security & Privacy, but so far adding Terminal and rsync to the list of allowed apps does not allow the backup to succeed. I'm working to add the script I use to run the backup, and will adjust my question when I get that tested.\n\nA: As documented in this post among some other places, MacOS Mojave implements additional security protocols that even affect root's access to user data.\nThe solution in the linked question provides the basic method I used to resolve my issue.\nFor custom-built scripts that will run through launchd, the administrator of the computer on which the script is to be run must add that script to Security & Privacy to give that \"app\" permission to access user data. \nIt was not necessary to add launchd or rsync (in my case) to Security & Privacy.\nI have not researched if there is a way to do this via Terminal, which it seems would be necessary for those administering a large number of clients.\n========\nUpdate: I've also learned that if you add a script, and you later make changes to that script, you need to delete it from the Security & Privacy-->Full Disk Access, then add it again. Perhaps macOS creates a hash that is checked?\n========\nUpdate w/ Catalina: I do not recall if I had System Integrity Protection disabled on Mojave, but it appears to be required to be disabled in Catalina. I know SIP doesn't have to be disabled for OS versions prior to these. \nDisabling macOS SIP allowed the script in question to start running again. This is not ideal, so I'll be researching other approaches.\n\nA: Not quite an answer to your problem, but it's very similar/related...\nWhen writing a shell script that's run by cron, e.g. using rsync in a script to backup your files on another server.\nYou will notice that adding \"Terminal.app\" to the \"Full Disk Access\" does not work, because cron does not use \"Terminal.app\".\nYou could grant \"Full Disk Access\" access to the rsync program, and that solves some of the permission problems, but this is not enough if you need access to:\n~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary\n~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook\nInstead, you should add cron to \"System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Full Disk Access\".\nI did this by running open /usr/bin/, which opened a Finder window that allowed me to easily drag/drop the cron program into the \"Full Disk Access\" list.\n", "Q: LibreOffice vs. LibreOffice Vanilla What is the difference between LibreOffice, as available for download from the LibreOffice web site, and LibreOffice Vanilla, as available from the macOS AppStore?

I would not make a decision based on the worry that Apple is going to replace your whole machine as a result of a lawsuit within the next 2 years; to my knowledge such a replacement program would be unprecedented. \nApple Repair Program: https://www.apple.com/support/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro/\n\nA: Since you’re not even going to seek a repair under warranty, I can’t see you be happy pre-paying for a repair which is what Apple Care is. \n\nYou’re betting you’re going to pay for one repair over three years and that Apple is going to need to make more than one repair so you win financially.\n\nI know a lot of people that buy AppleCare because they’re paying for peace of mind, so you might consider that even if you’ll never seek a keyboard repair. Flat rate mail in repairs cost about $300 assuming no external damage happens prior to seeking a repair. \nI have never seen one Apple related legal settlement be worth a hill of beans once the lawyers take their cut. \nApple offers repair extension programs way before anything ever goes to court, so that’s the real consumer relief I see when Apple decides to extend the warranty and pay for repairs for products.

I can set a location-based reminder that triggers when I leave, but it seems to be a one-shot deal (and I don't want to have to set a reminder to remind me to set another reminder!)  \nIt does seem that there's an ability to set a scheduled reminder that fires every day at a given time and is also location-based, but I don't think this is what I'm looking for due to requiring to have to set a time too.  I don't think this is going to fire off if I'm already outside before the reminder's time comes.  \nIs it possible to set up an event that fires off every time you leave a location and not just once?  If so, how?  \n\nA: Turns out the solution was ridiculously simple.  If you never check the item off the reminder list as done then it fires every time you leave the house.  \nThe only issue I'm having with it now is that it doesn't fire until I'm a considerable distance from the house, and it seems the smallest radius you can set on it is 100m.  \n\nA: You can set up repeating reminders based on location using several different methods. Workflow and Shortcuts are native iOS apps that have functions for reminders based on location. I do not recall if they can be triggered automatically or have to be manually triggered.\nYou could also use a third party app/service such as IFTTT which supports repeating triggers. Use the location service connected to a notification service to create your reminder.\n", "Q: Bluetooth Not Available I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) running 10.13.6 and I am now getting \"Bluetooth: Not Available\" in the menu bar.

If this is a hardware issue, do you have a recommendation for a Bluetooth USB adapter that I can use to limp by with?\n\nA: If one reset of the SMC doesn't restore the function, you've done all the triage except for one last ditch option before hardware repair or dropping an USB BTLE adapter on.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a clean new 10.14 Mojave installation onto an external drive and let it update the firmware and then test without any user data migration or app installations. A total clean OS install can sometimes restore the drivers or state of the adapter if it's hung up and not a hardware issue.\n\n*Hardware repair is likely going to be costly so I've had very good luck with all manner of BTLE 4.0 dongles that use USB connectors. They cost $9 or so for good quality - try and look for one that says Mac compatible or buy from a company that accepts returns or can offer pre-sales assurance your chosen macOS will work.

For example, when going to the \"Accessibility pane (\"Allow the apps below to control your computer\") and adding an app via the + button or by drag & drop from the Finder, the action is simply ignored and the list stays empty.\nAny idea to work around it?\n\n\nA: Removing /Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db file and restarting the system solved the problem.\nIn addition you probably have to restart in recovery mode and do a csrutil disable.\nThen you can reboot and delete the file.  Don't forget to csrutil enable in recover mode after it's done. And reboot again to use the system.\n\nA: I ended up uninstalling Backblaze completely (even though it was the up-to-date version 5.4.0 that supports Mojave) and then reinstalled the same version from scratch. \nThis took care of the issue.\n\nA: I had same problem which was in my case caused by ESET.

The meter will stick at a certain percentage far longer than it should, then rapidly drop down to a lower level, stay there, and then drop down again. For example: it will stick at 100% for a few minutes on end, plunge to 95% over half a minute, stay there for 8-10 minutes, then plunge again to 90% within another half minute.\nThe erratic battery meter behavior doesn't coincide with an OS upgrade (11.4 had been fine for months leading up to this).\niOS Battery Health doesn't report any problems with the battery - it holds 92% maximum of what it originally held and is considered to be in \"good health\".\nI previously blamed and associated this behavior with a specific mobile game that was updated recently. However, I observed the battery meter plunges outside of that game just recently (it occurred on the home screen) so it's been ruled out as a cause.\nAdditionally, the built-in Music app is randomly waking up and silently putting itself on play over speakers with volume on minimum or mute, wasting 20-30% battery over several hours. This happened yesterday at 1-2 PM estimated and again overnight today.\nWhen I first checked for excessive power usage, the game I mentioned earlier used off-the-charts amount of power for \"audio\". Now with the built-in Music app acting possessed and waking up with no user input, I'm inclined to blame the iOS audio system.\nI already read the previous question on \nErratic battery percentage behavior which doesn't fit as it asks about a jailbroken iPod Touch.\n\nA: According to the battery meter, your battery appears fine. However, the symptoms you describe are typical of a bad or dying battery. Ideally, you would want to replace the battery with a known-good battery (from another device, for example) to see if the problem persists or not.\nIn the absence of a known-good battery, one purchased from a reputable supplier can do.\n\nA: I use the battery meter as a guideline. That being said, there was a known issue with batteries on the iPhone 6s. If you noticed the phone unexpectedly shutting down even while showing a remaining charge, see this information at Apple: https://www.apple.com/support/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown/\n", "Q: List of all AppleScript commands for Terminal application In AppleScript we can write things like:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    activate\n    set currentTab to do script (someScript)\nend tell\n\nI mean we are using commands like activate and set currentTab....\nWhere can I find documentation and a full list of all the commands that we can use for Terminal in AppleScript?\n\nA: In Script Editor you can reference the Dictionary:\n\nOpen Script Editor, navigate to File > Open Dictionary...  Choose The Terminal.app \nWhen you click Terminal Suite you can see a list of classes:\n\nIf you wanted to get deeper in AppleScript you could buy the application Script Debugger version 7, but as noted in the comment there is a free version which is Script Debugger Lite if I recall.

Every time I find the destination and click on \"Directions\", Maps immediately starts getting Navigation directions from my \"Current Location\" which wastes time and data usage because the map zooms out and away, starts looking for multiple routes, and runs into a dead end if there is an ocean in-between.

When AppleIntelHD5000Graphics.kext gets loaded up the display freezes wherever it was. This usually happens right after the desktop loads but sometimes it will last 2-3 minutes before locking up and sometimes it will freeze before boot up finishes (Apple logo screen).\nI know it is this particular driver because I never have the issue in single user mode, recovery mode, or running Linux.  It also won't freeze after a \"normal boot\" if I don't let it load that particular kext. Animations are very choppy and the computer will run much warmer but that is to be somewhat expected given that there is no \"hardware acceleration\".  \nCuriously enough, if I plug an external monitor into the HDMI port while its booting it will run both displays with no issue.\nI can also verify that (at least part of) the OS is still running because I can SSH into it.

Prior to Mojave, I used a custom Shortcut (System Preferences>Keyboard> Shortcuts>App Shortcuts) for the 'Tags…' command (Finder, File>Tags…), as in this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/112852/63961.\nAfter updating, this shortcut stopped working, and the keystroke no longer appeared in Finder's File menu next to 'Tags…'. The custom setting was still present in System Preferences.\nI've attempted to reset this by clearing the old shortcut and re-creating it, with a variety of different keystrokes, and with alternate spelling for 'Tags…' (i.e., with three periods for the ellipsis character). Other custom shortcuts do work in Finder, for menu items either already having built-in keystrokes, or when no built-in is present. The Finder Toolbar button for the 'Tags…' command works fine, as does the menu item itself.\n\nA: I got it to work again!\nIn Finder settings, remove all the favorites in tags. Then go to a file and manually click Tags... from the menu bar, type in a tag and press enter. Next time the shortcut works, on all other files too.\n\nA: In Finder, go to preferences, then Tags. Remove all favorite tags, and the shortcut should work.\n\nA: The work around above doesn't work for me and I think there is a real bug in the OS. When you work with cursor keys manually (i.e. without using Karabiner and pressing ctrl-f2, right_arrow, right_arrow, down_arrow, t, in order) the final 't' command takes you to Rename since the OS cannot see the Tags… command. Even if you move the cursor by pressing the down_arrow key a few more times it moves to the 'Find' command at the bottom and then the next down_arrow keystroke makes the highlight disappear as if the Tags… item weren't there.\n\nA: EDIT:\nIt seems that Apple very rigorously prevents keyboard access to \"Tags…\" in Mojave.\nAs I still work with High Sierra, I cannot test any workaround for this restriction. Sorry!\nHere's a workaround [NOT for Mojave +], if you don't mind using a free third party app (GitHub:) \"Karabiner Elements\".\n(KE is a key re-mapping tool and preference panel \"app\". It can easily be closed temporarily or uninstalled via its \"Misc\" tab.)\nStart by copying/pasting this code into BBEdit/TextEdit.\n[EDIT:] THEN save file as \"Finder-Tags.json\" into:\n~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications.\n{\"title\": \"Finder … ''Tags…''\",\n \"rules\": [\n          { \"description\": \"Finder:  ''Tags…'' \",\n            \"manipulators\": [\n                { \"conditions\": [\n                      { \"bundle_identifiers\": [\"^com.apple.finder\"],\n                        \"type\": \"frontmost_application_if\" }\n                                ],\n                        \"from\": { \"key_code\": \"t\",\n                                  \"modifiers\": {\n                                      \"mandatory\": [\"left_command\"] }\n                                },\n                          \"to\": [ { \"key_code\": \"f2\",\n                                    \"modifiers\": [\"left_control\"] },\n                                  { \"key_code\": \"right_arrow\"},\n                                  { \"key_code\": \"right_arrow\"},\n                                  { \"key_code\": \"down_arrow\"},  \n                                  { \"key_code\": \"t\"},  \n                                  { \"key_code\": \"return_or_enter\"}\n                                ],\n                        \"type\": \"basic\" }\n                            ]\n}    ]    }\n\n\nNow, what you see is some code that re-maps your \"Cmd-T\" to a sequence of key-press´es, starting with Cmd-F2 to access finder's menus, followed by some simulated arrow-key navigation to pull down \"File\" menu and finally a \"t\" to reach and \"enter\" item \"Tags…\"\nAll this funny mixture is necessary, as there are TWO menus (Finder & File) with starting letters \"Fi\", which prevents getting to \"File\" easily.\nAt the beginning of the code \"bundle_identifiers\": [\"^com.apple.finder\"] restricts this shortcut to your Finder, and ONLY works if it is the frontmost_application.\nFine!\nIf you want to try this very easy method, do it this way:\n– Find, download and install \"Karabiner Elements\" from GitHub\n– Open it and its tab \"Complex Modifications  \"\n– Press [+ Add rule], scroll to \"Finder: Tags…\" and press [+ Enable]  \nBtw:\nIt is just as easy to create a shortcut to open the context menu and next a \"Tags…\" window from there. But THAT shortcut would demand your cursor to hover over a selected file.\n\nA: Accepted answer above work for me as well. But only after a restart of the computer. The culprit is most likely not the Tags, but the Shortcuts!\nThe problem with above solution is that deleting \"Favorite Tags in Sidebar\" in Finder Preferences also removes these custom tags from the files! So - if you want to keep your files tagged - try these steps below:\n1.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reenter the shortcut in System Preferences.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n\n2.\n\n\n*\n\n*If problem resists - Delete (or move) Finder prefs (path: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist) \n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n*Enter the shortcut in System Preferences.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n\nFinder prefs contains the “App shortcuts” (and some other settings, not that hard to recreate), not the “Favourite Tags”. To remove the Finder prefs is a common solution to basic problems. If you never tried it before it may be handy to know that you keep the old file, and if you wish, put it in place again (and immediately restart your Mac) to get your old settings back.\n————————————\nThe menu-name of “Tags…” can be entered with three dots or with an ellipse, they both work.\nThe shortcut can be a global shortcut or a shortcut for the Finder only.\nThe key combination given to the shortcut of “Tags…” will not show up in the File-menu as other shortcut key combinations does. \n————————————\nShortcuts in Mojave shows some buggy behaviours. Sometimes when entering four or five shortcuts at once the entered menu-names suddenly disappears. After a restart they show up properly. \nThe shortcut for “Tags..” seems extra troublesome. Tags seems to be hooked into Finder and also have some other dependencies. The problem is probably due to synchronisation of plist and defaults files.\nIf opening the window of “Finder Preferences - Tags” the shortcut of “Tags…” may stop working. Opening Finder Preferences - but not viewing the Tags section - seems to not render the shortcut nonfunctional.\nSometimes, but rarely, it is enough only opening System Preferences window to render the shortcut nonfunctional. Other entered custom shortcuts will work just fine though.\nA restart always solves the problem.\n————————————\nA tip:\nYou can view your shortcuts in the default-file. Type “defaults read” (without quote-marks) in Terminal. Search for “NSUserKeyEquivalents” (without quote-marks).\nThe shortcuts will show in two places (if applied).\nIn “Apple Global Domain” section it may look like this:\nNSUserKeyEquivalents =         {\n      \"About This Mac\" = \"@^a\";\n      \"System Preferences...\" = \"@~,\";\n};\n\nIn “com.apple.finder” section it may look like this:\nNSUserKeyEquivalents =         {\n    \"Show Search Criteria\" = \"@^s\";\n    \"Tags...\" = \"@^t\";\n};\n\nThat means you could also do a “defaults-write” to set your shortcuts.\n(Not recommended if you do not know how to do it properly).\n", "Q: Installing Windows 7 in Boot Camp is Unavailable on Mojave On my MacBook Pro (Mid 2014), it seems that Apple has stopped support for installation of Windows 7 via Boot Camp on my Mac. I am currently trying to edit the info.plist to attempt to find a way to allow Boot Camp to run Windows 7, but I can't figure it out. Is there any way to get this to work?\n\nA: What I would suggest is getting old bootcamp files and going the manual route, that is, without using Bootcamp assistant. You would create an exFat partition, get a bootable Win7 installer disk and boot into the disk to install Win7 on the exFat partition. Booting into Windows 7, you can then manually install the Bootcamp drivers.  \nThe latest Bootcamp drivers, that is Bootcamp 6 don't support windows 7/8 installation as far as I know, so you'll have to get older drivers. Here's the link for Bootcamp 5.1.5722: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1836?locale=en_US\nAccording to them:\n\n• The download file is a .zip file. Double click it to uncompress it,  if it is not automatically uncompressed.\n  • Double-click the Boot Camp5 folder.\n  • Copy the entire contents of the .zip file to the root level of a USB flash drive or hard drive that is formatted with the FAT file system\n  • When running Windows, locate the Boot Camp folder on the USB media you created in Step 3 and double click to open it.\n  • Double click on setup to start installing the Boot Camp Support Software.\n  • When prompted to allow changes, click on Yes and follow the onscreen instructions.\n  • Installation can take a few minutes. Don't interrupt the installation process. When installation is complete, click Finish in the dialog that appears.\n  • A system restart dialog box appears.  Click Yes to complete the installation. \n\n\nA: The only way I know how to solve your problem is to get an older version of osx. I used mavericks. Use bootcamp on an older version to get your windows 7 under boot camp and then upgrade to mojave. \nThat means using recovery to install whatever the base version of osx your mac uses and then using boot camp under that OS to install win 7. \n\nA: What I usually do is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*First to use a MacOs software called Diskmaker to downgrade your OSX to the earliest version possible. For my 2014 15 MBPR this is Mavericks.\n\n*Then use Bootcamp to install your Windows 7 as normal.\n\n*Upgrade OSX if you like.\nProblem Solved.\n", "Q: Am I supposed to have access to \"com.apple.TCC\"? I was doing some snooping around on my MacBook Air after the update to macOS Mojave and noticed a folder that I have permission to view its contents that I don't have permission for on my iMac. The folder in question is \"com.apple.TCC\" under the Application Support folder, the path from the Finder is by selecting the following: Macintosh HD -> Library -> Application Support\n\nI was just poking around and noticed that the folder was inaccessible on the iMac and it had me wondering as to whether or not I should have access to it in the first place. I wasn't going around aimlessly deleting/modifying any of the files, I was just curiously looking at them and nothing more.\nI find it quite strange that my MacBook is able to view the contents, but the iMac is not and was wondering if others can confirm if they can/cannot view its contents.\n\nA: Apparently the TCC database stores the \"privacy database\": settings from System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy.\nSee https://eclecticlight.co/2017/01/09/controlling-privacy-in-macos-sierra/ and man tccutil.\nThe article says\n\n... this is managed in a special TTC database, which is stored in the folder ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC. There is also a master database stored at /Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC, but you cannot open that folder, as only the system has that privilege.\n\nOn my iMac running High Sierra:\n$ ls -ld /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC ~/Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC\ndrwx------  3 root    admin  102  4 Oct 11:15 /Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC\ndrwx------  3 ashley  staff  102 29 Jun 16:13 /Users/ashley/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC\n\nNote the different ownership: the one in /Library (= Macintosh HD -> Library) is owned by root, and the one in my home folder (~/Library/Application Support = /Users/ashley/Library/Application Support) is owned by me. Because the permissions are drwx------ in both cases, only the owner can see into the folder... so when I look in Finder, the one in /Library has a \"no entry\" sign on it (because I'm not root), but I can open the one in my home folder, and see there is a file there named TCC.db.\nI don't know why you see a difference between your MacBook Air and your iMac. In older times, I'd recommend you \"repair permissions\", but I believe that facility has gone away in the recent operating systems.\n", "Q: Will updating macOS delete my kext configuration I have after disabling discrete GPU permanently from EFI? I have followed all the instructions provided at MacBook Pro: How to disable discrete GPU permanently from EFI? \nMy question is:\nIs it safe to update my macOS to latest High Sierra or even to Mojave (Recently I have High Sierra 10.13.1) or it will erase all my kext settings and make my broken GPU appear again? And do I have to do all the process all over again from the beginning, which I would like highly to avoid.\nSorry if this question been asked before, since i cant find this question somewhere else. \n\nA: As it's currently written I have to assume that you followed the highest voted answer. That means you only removed the dGPU kexts. That is suboptimal anyway. \nLook here for a better solution.\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/295805/251859\n\nNow, updating macOS 10.13.1 to 10.13.5 will install a non-working but critical kext (AMDRadeonX3000.kext), thereby your machine will still boot.\nThat changes with 10.13.6, where a working, new kext will be installed. That means you will then have to move the kext again.  \nOn upgrading to Mojave you will naturally get a full set of working kernel extensions. If that is coupled with a non-working dGPU that will lead to a boot failure. This requires additional operations then.\nBut that shouldn't bother you much, as most MacBook Pros for which that hack is intended are not officially supported b Mojave.

The problem is, that I don't know if it is possible to change only the payment method of the iCloud storage?\n\nA: You can't have a separate payment method setup for Apple Music and iCloud storage.\nThere is a single unified payment method configuration for consuming all the services made available by Apple for an Apple ID.\nYou can request your company to add funds to your PayPal account or ask them to add funds to your Apple ID.\n", "Q: How to pass two variables from previous actions to \"run applescript\" in Automator What I'm trying to is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Receive a string from \"Ask for Text\".\n\n*Get a file from Finder.\n\n*Do some codings these inputs in Applescript.\n\n\nSeems like Applescript only receives file as input, I have no idea how to pass string from step 1 to it. Any suggestions are appreciated.\nnote: all \"ignore action's input\" are uncheck.\nThe workflow looks like this:\n\n\nA: For my normal usage, typically when using a Set Value of Variable action, the subsequent action will have the [√] Ignore this action's input checkbox checked. This is because one does not typically set a variable and then pass it directly to the next action, unless of course the value of that variable will also be needed elsewhere in the workflow and the next action also makes use of the variable. Since a Ask for Finder Items action in your use case as shown in your question isn't going to use the variable, I've checked the [√] Ignore this action's input checkbox checked, in the Ask for Finder Items action. Of course adjust to your needs.\nNow to pass both what's returned by the Ask for Finder Items action and the value of the Variable_1 variable, place a Get Value of Variable action between the Ask for Finder Items action and the Run AppleScript action.\nThen in this case, input in on run {input, parameters} is a list of two items, the first being what was passed from the Ask for Finder Items action and the second being the value of the Variable_1 variable from the Get Value of Variable action, and here's an example AppleScript code addressing what is shown in your Run AppleScript action to handle it:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    set filePath to the POSIX path of item 1 of input\n    set Answer to item 2 of input   -- This is the value of the Variable_1 variable.\n\n    return filePath & Answer\nend run\n\nThat said, the return line may not be practical as it's just concatenating two strings at that point, so I suspect this is just for testing to see that it actually can return the two pieces of information.\n", "Q: How to delete GameCenter and iCloud from Internet Accounts using the Terminal? Running Sierra 10.12.6 without administrator privileges, the system has some problem with my iCloud profile. Whenever accessing anything remotely related to it, the respective app beachballs indefinitely. This includes the Preferences pane, so I could not even delete my account from there. I managed to find the necessary Terminal command:\ndefaults delete MobileMeAccounts\n\nIt worked, almost. Even without root access/sudo, this indeed reset the iCloud pane in Preferences, but it did not remove the iCloud and Game Center entries from the Internet Accounts pane.

I'm trying to figure out a way to connect iPhone 5 (lightning) to ASUS MB16AC portable monitor with USB type-C input as only connector that at the same time serves as power supply. Thought about some scenarios. Could you check if any of these can work or provide some tips that could send me the right direction? \nThanx in advance\n\n\n*\n\n*AV adapter lightning to HDMI > HDMI cable to USB-C with power supply\nProblem is that the HDMI cable would have to send signal from HDMI to USB-C. Most of cables on market work the other way round. I'm not sure if it's possible to DIY such a cable? see connection diagram\n\n*Lightning > USB-C cable\nI recon this can't work without a dedicated app on iPhone that would send video and power over the cable towards the monitor. \nHow difficult would it be to write such an app? \n\nA: I don't think it's possible. The lightning AV adapter creates an Airplay display, which won't work properly over USB-C.\nMore here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251990738 and here: https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/mqhwez/comment/gvt4eob.\n\nA: The ASUS MB16AC portable monitor accepts either DisplayLink or DisplayPort input.  This means you have to get a DisplayPort signal out of the iPhone or the DisplayLink drivers into the iPhone and use the appropriate USB adapter on the iPhone.  As I write this I believe there are not any drivers for DisplayLink video adapters or displays.\nThe Lightning port on iPhones does not provide a video signal like how USB-C ports would normally do, it relies on the adapter to do the heavy lifting.  An iPhone with an HDMI or VGA adapter would be told by the adapter to provide a compressed video signal to the adapter, then that adapter decompresses the signal and converts that into HDMI or VGA.  It is certainly possible to find a conversion device that will turn the HDMI signal into DisplayPort, but that doesn’t sound like it would be necessarily helpful.  A conversion device kind of destroys the portability of the display.  It is also possible for someone to build an adapter that can take the video signal that an iPhone produces and turn that into DisplayPort, that would seem actually quite trivial since it has been done with HDMI and VGA, but I have not seen such a product on the market.\nBuyer beware with DisplayPort/HDMI adapters as many of them rely on “dual mode” ports to function.  These adapters work with DisplayPort outputs going into HDMI mode for backward compatibility, the port is producing the HDMI signal and the cable or adapter is just wires (maybe a signal booster or amplifier) meaning no actual conversion is done outside the source device.  I see nothing to indicate the display supports “dual mode” so it is unlikely that it has any kind of HDMI backward compatibility.\nA Lightning to USB-C cable will not work in connecting to this display because, again, the iPhone doesn’t produce a video signal all on it’s own.  Also, the cable is built in such a way to put the iPhone into USB B-mode (or device mode, as opposed to A-mode or host mode) and the USB-C end of the cable tells what it is connected to it to go into USB A-mode.  The Lightning to USB-C cable is a USB A-to-B cable but with different mechanical fittings, it lacks the wires and electronics to pass a video signal.  The cable lacks the ability to function for anything but USB and power.\nIt would be unlikely to find a Lightning to USB-C cable capable of DisplayPort or DisplayLink because it would be too easily confused with a cable for charging and USB data.  Apple and the USB-IF group have requirements on cable design and such a cable would almost certainly violate one, the other, or both specifications.\nWhat could happen is a Lightning to DisplayPort cable or adapter and that could be connected to a DisplayPort to USB-C cable or adapter.  It seems silly to have to do that from first sight but by digging into the specs it makes a bit more sense.  The idea is to maintain user expectations on what a cable looks like and what it does, fail to maintain that consistency and USB-C becomes even more confusing.  USB-C is confusing enough as it is.\n", "Q: Custom keyboard layout not showing in System Preferences in 10.13.6 I have a custom keyboard layout which I would like to use and I've tried moving the .keylayout file to the /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ and the corresponding directory in home folder, but it doesn't show up in System Preferences app. \nI've also tried having it only in home/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ or only in /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ and both but to no avail.\nI would've tried installing it with Ukelele or creating the bundle but Ukelele won't open it saying only that it isn't valid XML.

My Spotlight index (MacBook Air 13, 10.13.6) has been growing out of control requiring me to delete and rebuild at least twice per day. \nI have about 70 Gb available on my HDD, and the Spotlight database located in /.Spotlight-V100/ slowly increases until it takes up the entirety of the free space.\nAt that point I delete the index as follows:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsudo mdutil -a -i off\nsudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100/*\nsudo mdutil -a -i on\n\nand allow it to rebuild itself. \nThis post indicates that others have seen this behavior, but gives no help in debugging, as the poster found an issue with a device driver that I don't have. Spotlight Massive (out of control at 100GB+)\nAny tips as to how to debug this issue? I've poked around the Console.app but haven't found a clear pointer to anything going out of control.\nOne possibility is that there are a large number of mdworker processes created during the rebuild; I don't know if this is unexpected but it seems greater than what others have reported.\n\nAt this point I'm out of ideas of what to check. I rely on Spotlight pretty thoroughly for mail search within Outlook so I can't just turn it off entirely. Thanks!\n\nA: Working under the assumption that it is a specific file, folder or file type that triggers some kind of bug that makes the index size explode, I would take a look at the actual files that Spotlight builds up (i.e. the database itself). Tryk looking at them with any text editor or even a hex-editor.\nIf this is indeed caused by a bug that caused the same content to be indexed over and over again, then you might be able to see which file or file type it is. Then you can narrow down which folder to exclude from Spotlight.\nAnother more time consuming method is simply by trial and error doing a kind of \"binary search\", where you exclude half of your folders from the Spotlight index. If the problem persists, the problem is in this half - otherwise it is in the other. Repeat that process until you've found the specific folder containing the problematic file.\nIf you're comfortable with the Terminal, you can also take a look at which files are actually opened and read by the mdworker processes. This could again give you a hint as to why the index is so big.\nFirst use Activity Monitor like you have already done to find the mdworker processes. Make note of the \"PID\" column that contains the process ID.\nOpen Terminal and run the following command:\nlsof -n -p <pid>\n\nYou need to replace  with the actual process ID. This will give you a list of the files that are currently in use by that process.\nYou could also run:\nfs_usage -p <pid>\n\nAgain replace  with the actual process ID.

What’s the difference between Maximized and Fullscreen?  Minimized and Hidden?   Where did my window go?   How do I get it back?\nAs a newbie convert from Windows my ideas about what can happen to windows (small w) are not in sync with MacOS, and I find MacOS concepts confusing.  I would like (and created my own) “compare and contrast” guide to these things and how to use them.\nUndoubtedly there are inaccuracies in my own answer to this question, that I hope will attract corrections from more knowledgeable people.\n\nA: After learning all the things below I am documenting them here for comparison and contrast.  This may seem idiotic to experienced Mac users but to a Windows user it will clarify a lot.\nThis is not exhaustive documentation on all these features.  It focuses on the confusing aspects, the contrasts, and how to undo mistakes.\nThere is a great and more exhaustive comparison of Minimized vs Hidden in this question: What are the differences between minimizing and hiding an application?\nMaximized\nA maximized window is expanded so that its contents can be fully displayed, but with the Dock and Apple Menu still showing.\nThe exact behavior is app dependent. For example, Safari will usually only expand in height, not in width, while Preview and the Finder will usually expand  to fit the entire current screen. You maximize with ⌥ alt+MouseClickGreenLight.  Same action to undo. Note that clicking the green light (without ⌥ alt) on a maximized window will Fullscreen it. Pay attention.\nFullscreen\nA Fullscreen window is moved to a new Desktop/Space where it occupies the entire screen without a Dock or Apple Menu or even the window's own traffic lights.  To do this click the green light or use ⌘ cmd-⌃ ctrl-F.  To undo, ⌘ cmd-⌃ ctrl-F again or hover the mouse at the top edge of the screen for a bit and the Apple Menu and traffic lights will appear.\nMinimized\nA minimized window is moved to a small icon at the right or bottom end of the dock (depending on the dock's orientation).   Do this with ⌘ cmd-M or the yellow light.   Undo this by clicking on the window in the dock.  Note if you switch to an app by clicking on its main icon in the Dock or with ⌘ cmd-⇥ tab, its minimized windows won't open, and if it only has minimized windows you will make the app active but will not open any windows.\nHidden\nAn app and all its windows can be hidden.  They appear nowhere.  Do this with ⌘ cmd-H.  When you hide an app, even the windows that were minimized in the Dock are hidden.   Restore a hidden app by clicking on its main icon in the Dock, or ⌘ cmd-⇥ tab to it.  When you restore a hidden app its minimized windows will still be minimized.   You can also hide all apps except the active one with ⌘ cmd-⌥ alt-H.  You can't undo that in one action.\nClosed (Killed)\nA closed or killed window is permanently deleted.  Do this with ⌘ cmd-W or the red light.  Exactly what this does and how to undo it (if possible) is application-dependent.   If you close an app's last window, it may or may not Quit.\nQuit\nYou can close all an app's windows and stop the process with ⌘ cmd-Q or with Quit from the Dock or Apple menus.   Some apps will quit if you close their last window, some will keep running.  You can identify a running app from the dot next to its icon in the Dock.   It may have no windows or only minimized ones.  If there is no dot, that means it is not running but the icon has been locked in the Dock for convenience.  There is no Undo - If an app has open windows when you Quit it, they may or may not be restored by the app when you restart it.\nSwitch\nThe active application occupies the Apple menu at the top of the screen and usually one of its windows has the keyboard focus and is in front.   Switch to an app by clicking one of its windows, clicking it in the dock, or with ⌘ cmd-⇥ tab.  Switch between windows of the active app by clicking them or with ⌘ cmd-~ tilde.  You cannot switch to a minimized window, you have to click that in the Dock.  If you switch to an app that is running but has no windows or only minimized windows, it will appear in the Apple menu but nothing else will happen.\nHere is a cheat sheet you might like to print:\nSwitch App ⌘ cmd-⇥ tab\nSwitch Window ⌘ cmd-~ tilde\nHide App All ⌘ cmd-H\nHide Other Apps ⌘ cmd-⌥ alt-H\nMinimize Window ⌘ cmd-M or Yellow\nKill Window ⌘ cmd-W or Red\nKill App ⌘ cmd-Q or from Dock/Apple menus\nMaximize Window ⌥ alt-Green\nFullscreen Window ⌘ cmd-⌃ ctrl-F or Green\nUnFullscreen ⌘ cmd-⌃ ctrl-F or Hover Mouse at top\nAddendum\nI'm adding a few extra bits here at the end that I think would overcomplicate the answer but are worth mentioning.\nThe Dock setting Minimize Windows to App Icon changes the Minimize behavior described above so that Minimize works a little more like Hide but only for specific windows.  Minimized windows do not appear in the Dock.  I think that if you choose this setting, minimize various windows, then hide various apps and then unhide some ..... you probably end up in a state where you have no idea what windows exist where.  I'm not sure how you would employ this setting in a useful way or how I would describe it in the main answer without making the answer too complicated.\nThe Dock setting Show Indicators for Open Apps if disabled means the dots described above under \"Switch\" will never appear, and you would have no visual way of distinguishing running apps with hidden windows from not-running apps with icons locked in the Dock.  I suppose if you chose to have zero locked icons, the dots would be redundant so you could gain back a few pixels by eliminating them.\nFor people with multiple monitors, the Mission Control setting Displays Have Separate Spaces is not default but I use it and some of the details above may be based on that.  I can see these differences:\nDifferences with Displays Have Separate Spaces\n\n*\n\n*With separate spaces, windows cannot straddle both monitors.  Each window is on one monitor, and if parts of it go off the edge they disappear.  With one space a window can straddle monitors.\n\n*If you Fullscreen a window without separate spaces It will occupy all of the monitor in which its upper left corner resides, and all other monitors will go blank and be temporarily disabled.  If you then switch back to the main space the other monitors will come back into play, so long as you are not in a space with a Fullscreen window.\n\n*Maximize is the same with or without separate spaces. The window is resized to use the current monitor for maximum effect.\n\n*Combining these, the only way to have a single application occupy all of your monitors is to use one space (not separate) and resize the window manually from its corners.\n\n", "Q: chmod using 100% CPU resources Since upgrading to High Sierra (now at 10.13.6) on my Mac Pro 2012, I experience regular episodes where the process chmod eats up ~100% on all 12 cores.\nIt happens about 15 seconds after logging in and lasts for about a minute.

I’ve noticed that if I have two folders of the same name but different files in each, copying one on top of the other (eg: from different parent locations) will cause the contents of the first folder to be wiped out by the second. Windows does not do this; It merges the contents of the two folders, making the operation far less destructive. On Mac it feels very risky.\nWhy is this?\nIs it an option which can be changed?\n\nA: Merge two folders with the same name\nIf you have two folders with identical names at two different locations, you can merge them into a single folder.\nPress and hold the Option key, then drag one folder to the location that contains a folder with the same name. In the dialog that appears, click Merge.\nThe Merge option appears only if one of the folders contains items that are not in the other folder. If the folders contain different versions of identically named files, the only options are Stop or Replace.\n\nA: On macOS Mojave, if you try to paste a folder with some name (let's say My Folder) into a different folder, let's say which is called Parent Folder, which contains a folder with the same name as the folder you are copying (i.e. My Folder), then one of two things will happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the folder you are pasting contains the same files as the folder you are trying to paste over (i.e. the My Folder inside the Parent Folder), then you will be asked to \"Stop\" the operation or to \"Replace\" the folder.\n\n*If the folder you are pasting contains different items from the the folder you are trying to paste over, then you will be given both of the options from 1., but also an option to \"Merge\" the folders. According to macOS, this is what merging does:\n\nMerge will combine the two folders, preserving all the newer items such as “My Picture.png”.\n\nYou also seem to be saying that macOS doesn't warn you before replacing folders. macOS's default behavior is to show you a dialog box with \"Stop\" and \"Replace\" (as in situation 1) or with \"Stop\", \"Replace\", and \"Merge\" (as in situation 2).\n", "Q: Don't get password prompt when ssh-ing from fedora I can ssh successfully with password from one mac running Yosemite to another, but when I try to use password authentication for ssh from fedora to either Yosemite system, I never get a password prompt - even if I disable key exchange and explicitly require password authentication.

I exported it as an application with the name \"LightsOn\", and it appears with that name in activity monitor.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, this app gets stuck. I can force quit it from Activity Monitor, but I want to be able to do so from a script. killall LightsOn doesn't work; I'm told that no matching processes belonging to you were found.\nHow can properly force quit this app from the terminal? Or, how can I discover the appropriate name for killall?\n\nA: Try this:\nps auxwww | fgrep -v fgrep | fgrep -i LightsOn\nThat should show you the matching process information.\nYou can also try pkill which should work like this:\npgrep -fl LightsOn\nIf that shows you the PID, then you can move on to pkill:\npkill -9 -f LightsOn\nWhen you run pkill -9, you're not telling the application to terminate itself, instead you're telling the OS to stop running the program, no matter what the program is doing.\nWhen app gets stuck sending the kill without specifying the signal #, it will automatically assign to it the signal <15>, which means asking the app to terminate it self, it can not do that while stuck.\n\nA: The reason killall LightsOn doesn't work is because all running AppleScript application's process name is applet. For example, the executable path is:\n../LightsOn.app/Contents/MacOS/applet\n\nIn general and assuming the process(es) is(are) not hung, one could use killall applet however that will terminate all running AppleScript applications, and of course that may not be desirable.\nWhen a process is hung, you'll need to use a KILL signal, e.g.:\nkillall -KILL applet\n\nHowever, pkill is the way to go to easily target a specific AppleScript application and because it's hung... use a KILL signal, e.g.:\npkill -9 -f LightsOn\n\nOr:\npkill -KILL -f LightsOn\n\nNote in this instance, -9 is just another way of saying -KILL.\nNow with pkill and using the -f option, one can use more of the full argument list, e.g.:\npkill -9 -f /Applications/LightsOn.app/Contents/MacOS/applet\n\nThen there's no ambiguity as to which applet process one is targeting. One can use as much of the full argument list as one feels is necessary to target the correct process.\nFor example, pkill -9 -f LightsOn will terminate an AppleScript application named NoLightsOn, so always use enough of the full argument list to terminate the correct process.\n\nFor reference:\nFrom the pkill man page:\n\n -f          Match against full argument lists.

After installing Homebrew, one can install the software as follows.\nbrew install mtr\n\nIf desired, one might also make an alias for pathping. For example, in BASH...\nalias pathping='sudo /usr/local/sbin/mtr'\n\nThe familiar result is illustrated below.\n\n\nA: Just wanted to say that Christopher provides the most accurate answer here.\nTraceroute and pathping are 2 different tools that do the same thing in a different ways. By suggesting traceroute you're suggesting alternative tool and not equivalent tool and thats a big difference. OP is asking for equivalent, not alternative and mtr is the closest equivalent.\nAs written here: https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/42886/difference-of-tracert-and-pathping\n\nPING, is an application based on the ICMP protocol which is used to send echo packets to a destination and expecting to receive an echo\nresponse and it calculates the RTT (Round Trip Time) from when the\npacket was sent to when the echo response was received. Generally when\nusing PING on a LAN network you can trust that what it is saying is\naccurate unless you have foreknowledge of network devices in the\ntransit path that prioritize ICMP over mission critical TCP/UDP\nTraffic. This however is very common in networks that utilize unified\ncommunications, meaning voice and data on the same network. This is\nbecause QoS Policies are put in place to ensure voice traffic and\nother mission critical traffic is prioritized over ICMP thus\nindirectly affecting the RTT time of an ICMP ping test.\nTrace-route is another method commonly used by technicians and engineers to diagnosis latency in the transit path however any\nengineer that has studied how trace-route works would know that its\nresults are nearly always misleading.\nTrace-route works in a manner similar to ping however it uses the TTL feature to make each successive hop in the transit path respond\nwith an ICMP TTL Expired packet. Thus gives you the ability to\ndetermine which network devices the ICMP packet is traversing.\nWhen you dig deeper into the operation of traceroute you will see that traceroute utilizes 3 probe packets for each successive hop by\ndefault unless you specify other wise. Each probe packet indirectly\nmeasures the latency between the source and the device where the TTL\nis declared expired. This latency calculation is a by product of its\ntrue intended purpose. Keep in mind even if you send probes to a\ndevice that is five hops away, random latency spikes in any four\ndevices prior to the fifth hop can result in the fifth hop looking\nlike it has high latency.\nPathping works first by doing a traceroute to the destination then it uses ICMP to ping each hop in the transit path 100 times. This is\nused to verify latency between the source and destination via icmp\necho per each hop. But remember what I said earlier, you cannot rely\nICMP when public devices are involved. So you can run into cases where\nyou see ICMP pings destined to one hop in the transit drop 40% of the\ntraffic whereas the next hop has 100% success rate. This is due to\nCoPP.\nPathping in general is a much better tool to diagnosis latency from a specific source to destination with a relative degree of\naccuracy. Note that I said Relative, this is because latency is ALWAYS\nrelative to your location on the network.\n\n\nA: You can also use the Terminal too.\ntraceroute <ip address>\n\nAlso you  could do a ping too.\nping <ip address> \n\nNetwork Utility is nice in that it wraps all the utilities in one tool.\nI'd guess that you could write a shell script which wraps both together which it sounds like pingpath does.\n", "Q: How to track down a mystery autocompletion Every time I type\nnvm install\n\nit magically autocompletes to\nnvm install 9.2.1 --reinstall-packages-from=9.2.0 --latest-npm\n\nwith a return at the end, which errors as I'm using node 10.12.0 these days.\nIt doesn't matter what app I type this into, terminal, text editor, or even the browser (it autocompleted above when I typed this).\nI've never set up any such autocompletion rules, and this wasn't happening previously.

Since recently (I am not exactly sure when it started), I cannot charge the phone with my computer anymore. As soon as I plug the phone in, it will play the charging sound repeatedly. The right-hand side port sometimes works, the lefthand side port never works. When I connect my old iPhone 5 (using the same cable), it charges without any issues. My iPad mini 4 shows the same issue.\nSometimes the \"Do you trust this computer\" setting flashes on the phone and disappears before I can click anything. \nHow can I fix this?\nUpdate 1\nSometimes I get the Software Update dialogue in macOS. After approx. 2 minutes it shows the following: \n\nUpdate 2\nFor some reason the issue disappeared for a while but is back now. Disabling \"Settings\" > \"Touch ID & Passcode\" > \"USB Accessoires\" seems like it makes the problem a bit less bad, but not go away.\nUpdate 3\nThis is driving me crazy. I upgraded to Mojave 10.14.3 mostly to get rid of the issue. It persists. Some more random information: Before logging in (Filevault pre-boot authentication), the phone will charge fine. Only when a user account is loaded, the issue appears. The likelihood of a successful connection increases with the battery state of the iPhone.

I'm using Outlook and I've tried to write a script to do the job. It fails on saving the file with error code:\nerror \"Microsoft Outlook got an error: Parameter error.\" number -50\n\nUnfortunately I've not been able to figure out a) what that error means, and b) how to make the script work. Any help is welcome.\nThis is my script:\nset saveToFolder to (choose folder with prompt \"Choose the destination folder\") as string\nset ctr to 0\n\ntell application \"Microsoft Outlook\"\n    set srcFolder to mail folder \"inbox\" of exchange account \"FOO\"\n    set selectedMessages to messages of srcFolder\n    repeat with msg in selectedMessages\n        set ctr to ctr + 1\n        set msgsender to the sender of msg\n        set senderaddress to the address of msgsender\n        if \"scanner@some.some\" = senderaddress then\n            set attFiles to attachments of msg\n            repeat with f in attFiles\n                set attName to (get the name of f)\n                log attName\n                set saveAsName to saveToFolder & attName\n                log saveAsName\n                save f in POSIX file saveAsName\n            end repeat\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend tell\ndisplay dialog \"\" & ctr & \" messages were processed\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\nreturn ctr\n\n\nA: The parameter error is arising because one of the parameters you're sending to the save command is erroneous.  The f parameter is the attachment to be saved—this is fine.\nThe problem is the second parameter, which you've stated is a POSIX file path (one composed of forward slashes, e.g. /Users/hitzg/Desktop/some_file.txt).\nHowever, the variable saveAsName is derived from saveToFolder, which gets its file path from the choose folder command.  This command returns an HFS path (one composed of colons, e.g. Macintosh HD:Users:hitzg:Desktop:some_file.txt).\nSo the fix is simply to decide which type of file path format you're going to go with, and stick to it.  You can EITHER use posix paths, and change this line of the script (shortened for readability) from this:\nset saveToFolder to (choose folder) as string\n\nto this:\nset saveToFolder to POSIX path of (choose folder)\n\nOR use HFS paths, and change this line of the script:\nsave f in POSIX file saveAsName\n\nto this:\nsave f in file saveAsName\n\nThat fixes your parameter error, but I haven't tested the rest of your script to see how it performs.  Reading through it, there aren't any glaring errors, so I don't anticipate any other major issues.\n\nADDENDUM\nI'd like to offer a few edits to your original script that I believe streamlines the code whilst making it more efficient and performant.  Your existing script is excellent, however with strategic use of the AppleScript whose filter, we can eliminate the first of the repeat loops, whilst improving the performance of the second.\nset saveToFolder to (choose folder) as text\n\n\ntell application \"Microsoft Outlook\"\n    set srcFolder to mail folder \"Inbox\" of exchange account \"FOO\"\n    \n    set selectedMessages to a reference to (messages of srcFolder whose ¬\n        class of attachments contains attachment and ¬\n        \"From: First Last <scanner@some.some>\" is in headers)\n        \n    set attFiles to a reference to attachments of selectedMessages\n    set [n, m] to [count selectedMessages, count attFiles]\n    \n    repeat with f in the attFiles\n        set savePath to saveToFolder & name of f\n        save f in file savePath\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\ndisplay alert \"\" & m & \" attachments were saved\" message ¬\n    \"These belonged to \" & n & \" messages\" as ¬\n    informational buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\n\nThe key element of this version of the script is the implementation of the whose filter here:\n    set selectedMessages to a reference to (messages of srcFolder whose ¬\n        class of attachments contains attachment and ¬\n        \"From: First Last <scanner@some.some>\" is in headers)\n\nInstead of searching through all the messages in your inbox for messages sent from a particular sender, then grabbing the attachments, the filter's first criterion instantly picks out only the messages in your inbox that have attachments; messages without attachments are superfluous to our needs, so we don't even need to consider them.  The second criterion specifies that emails should come from a specific person, although the address of sender unfortunately can't be incorporated into the filter, so instead I've utilised the message headers to make sure it contains the appropriate \"From: ...\" string.\nTo format this string, simply obtain the headers property for one message from the specific sender, and skim through it until you come across a few lines that look like this:\nFrom: First Last <scanner@some.some>\nSubject: Hello World!\nThread-Topic: Hello Again\nThread-Index: AdQD5jaiEJ7GiUlKRYeD5LaN3BaSpA==\nDate: Thu, 14 Jun 2018 13:22:53 +0000\nMessage-ID: <B64BBE7A4C13095094C6A44D85FA3FDB5085651F@ABCD-mail.somemailbox.foo.com>\n\nIt'll be roughly in the middle of the header text.  Then just make sure your filter text matches the \"From:\" line (copy-n-paste), as this will almost certainly be the same throughout all emails from that sender, unless they changed their first and last names at any point (which may, of course, be absent).\nA slightly looser filter if you are concerned that the first and last names could have changed over time, would simply be to filter the headers to see if they contain just the email address \"scanner@some.some\".  Since you'll only be searching your inbox, it's reasonable to assume that any occurrence of that email address in an inbox message header means that email either originated from that address or was Cc'd to that address as well as you:\n    set selectedMessages to a reference to (messages of srcFolder whose ¬\n        class of attachments contains attachment and ¬\n        \"<scanner@some.some>\" is in the headers)\n\nThe rest of the script is more-or-less the same, with the fix for the parameter error implemented.\nHaving tested the script on my system, it worked as expected and performed very efficiently.  The bottlenecking in speed for me was having to download each attachment in order to save it, so there was a data transfer consideration when running in against my Exchange mail folder.\nWhen running it against a local mail folder with attachments already downloaded, the saving of attachments was virtually instantaneous.\n", "Q: How to identify if popup download of Adobe flash Player was infact a virus or malicious on?

A few months later, disappointed by the new drive, I want to swap back to the smaller but faster 1TB.\nI boot into Recovery, choose the latest Time Machine backup, and it prompts me to select the destination to restore to. But when I click on \"Macintosh HD\" (the only choice there, with space available shown as 998.97 GB) a notice appears saying \"This disk does not have enough space to restore your system\" and I am not able to proceed further because the Continue button remains grayed out.\nI'm sure the backup is only around 350 GB in size. This was achieved by adding certain large folders (e.g. photos) to Time Machine's list of excluded folders.\nI have googled for this error message, and found several other cases similar to mine, but no great solutions. It seems that the use of excluded folders may be a common feature of this issue. One person reported that after actually deleting those unwanted folders from their original hard drive and doing a final backup, they were able to proceed with the restore onto a smaller capacity drive. It's good to know such a workaround exists, but in my case I do want to keep those folders on the current drive, but just not restore them to the new drive.\nAnyone know what's going on here?

I found a osascript to open new tabs here, but I don't know how to have the newly opened tabs run myApp without asking my for password.\n\nA: The only way I can think of doing this is by setting up sudo to not require a password.  There are obvious security issues with this, but if those are acceptable in your situation, this is what I would do.\nEdit the /etc/sudoers file with the visudo command:\n# sudo visudo\nAdd a line at the bottom which grants the relevant user the ability to run any command as root without being prompted for a password (in this example adam is the user):\nadam ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\nIf you wanted a slightly more secure version, you could restrict them to only being able to run myApp without a password on a particular host (in this example the user is adam, the host is hebe and the only command they can run without a password is /usr/local/bin/myApp):\nadam hebe = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/myApp\n", "Q: Do I need Bonjour on my PC, Windows 7 Professional?

It's my understanding that the thunderbolt display cord (with little lightning icon on it) will not work in the mini displayport (with little screens icon on it). While the iMac is old, it works great, I'd love to find a solution.\nIs there some convertor for this or another way to run the new display from the old hardware? \n\nA: I believe it should work by getting a Mini DisplayPort cable going from the 2009 to the 27\" (into its Thunderbolt jack, which supports Mini DisplayPort cables).\nI just did something like what you did recently.  Well, I have a 27\" Late 2009 iMac running High Sierra and a 21.5\" Late 2012 iMac running Mojave.\nThere are only a few specific models of older Macs that will support that's called Target Display Mode, which is what I've ustilized here: I got a Mini DisplayPort cable online (3' is all I needed for just over $7 shipped and it came in white!), plugged one end into one of the 2012's two Thunderbolt jacks and the other end into the 2009's lone Mini DisplayPort jack.  The second I did that, the display from the 21.5\" immediately extended to the 27\".  Audio came with it, too.  In most cases, the keyboard command for target display mode is CMD + F2.  \nFrom there, I went into System Preferences > Display > Arrangement tab> then click-and-drag arrange your monitors as you want to use them.  Tip:  See the little thin white bar along the top of one of them? That's your PRIMARY monitor (often your source monitor).  Click and drag just THAT little white bar and move it over to the other monitor if you want all of your default notifications and etc to show up there.\nRead up on this.

I first noticed that one of my games would not connect to Facebook.  It connected fine the day before but now it won't.  When I went to the FB tab in settings it was blank.  I entered the password.  It verified it and it all looked good.  I exited out of settings and tried to enter my game and a box popped up asking for my password again.  It does that until I hit cancel.  I can still access FB thru the app and thru the browser.  Any ideas anybody????\n\nA: I remember dealing with something like this for a friend over a year ago. One of the things to try is to make sure you're logged out of FB at your computer and any other device you may log into FB on with.  Then, do a reset on your iPad (don't worry, this won't hurt any of your data): hold the Home and Power/Sleep buttons down at the same time for approximately 15-20 seconds/until you see the Apple logo.  Then release and give it time to fully restart. It'll take a few minutes, so be patient.  After it fully starts up, try opening up FB and entering in your login credentials and see what happens.  \n", "Q: Safari 12 - Favicon in Gmail tab shows incorrect e-mail count I have enabled the Show website icons in tabs feature made available in Safari 12.\nGmail has a feature to show count of unread emails in the browser tab favicon. The count shown in the Gmail tab in Safari 12 is incorrect.\n\nFor these tabs, on the first I have a total of 4 e-mails in the inbox, while in the second I have 7. None of them are unread. These counts never change. Does anyone have a fix for this?\nI'm running Safari 12.0 under macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no solution for this at the moment.\nThis is a known bug in Safari 12, and has to do with the way website favicons shown in Safari tabs are cached. My experience so far with Safari 12 in macOS High Sierra and macOS Mojave has been that favicon once cached for a website is not refreshed automatically.\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari favicons don't support updating\nAn advisable approach here would be to file a bug report with Apple. I have already done the same. Having more reports for same issue increases the likelihood of an issue getting resolved.\n", "Q: iMac Mid 2010 USB recovery I replaced tha hard drive on my Mid-2010 iMac because it failed and was unrecoverable.\nNow I need to install Mac Os High Sierra (the latest for Mid 2010), using a USB drive I have to create on Windows, because I have no other Macs.\nNow, I know I can use TransMac, but the problem is that I can't find any install DMG online. I also tried to search for Sierra instead of High Sierra, but I couldn't find nothing.\nI can't download Sierra from Mac App Store, because I'd need a Mac I don't have right now. \nSo the main question is: where can I find the DMG file I can use to create the USB recovery drive with TransMac?\nThank you and sorry for bad english!\n\nA: If you kept the firmware on your Mac up-to-date, you can use Internet MacOS Recovery. The mid 2010 iMac didn’t ship with that capability, but it was added in a later EFI update. If so, then just make sure it has a decent Internet connection and hold down Option-Command-R at startup. \n", "Q: How can I remove Applications from Security & Privacy? Is it possible to completely remove apps from the various privacy categories in System Preferences?\nSystem Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy\n\n\nA: To remove all apps from a particular Privacy category, open Terminal.app and type the following command, then type the Return key:\ntccutil reset CATEGORY\n\nwhere CATEGORY is one of:\n\n*\n\n*Accessibility\n\n*AddressBook\n\n*AppleEvents (i.e. Automation)\n\n*Calendar\n\n*Camera\n\n*Microphone\n\n*Photos\n\n*Reminders\n\n*ScreenCapture (for the Screen Recording list)\n\n*SystemPolicyAllFiles (for the Full Disk Access list)\n\n*SystemPolicyDesktopFolder\n\n*SystemPolicyDeveloperFiles\n\n*SystemPolicyDocumentsFolder\n\n*SystemPolicyDownloadsFolder\n\n*SystemPolicyNetworkVolumes\n\n*SystemPolicyRemovableVolumes\n\n*SystemPolicySysAdminFiles\n\nIf you want to remove only a particular app, you need to first determine its Bundle ID. Once you know that, issue the command:\ntccutil reset CATEGORY BUNDLEID\n\nNote: Specifying an app's Bundle ID appears to require macOS Mojave (10.14) or later.\nYou could also remove all apps from all categories:\ntccutil reset All\n\nThough this might freeze your Mac on macOS 10.15 and later, see comment below.\n\nIn the example given in the question, the following commands would remove Terminal and Chrome from Calendars.\nFirst, determine their Bundle IDs:\nosascript -e 'id of app \"Terminal\"'\n\nshows com.apple.Terminal. Same for \"Chrome\" gives: com.google.Chrome. Now we can reset them:\ntccutil reset Calendars com.apple.Terminal\ntccutil reset Calendars com.google.Chrome\n\nPro tip:\nThis is a one-liner doing the same:\ntccutil reset Calendars `osascript -e 'id of app \"Chrome\"'`\n\nMore info in this blog article: Managing Mojave’s privacy protection: Privacy controls.\n\nA: I tried clicking on the application you want to remove, but not the checkbox and then clicking the remove button (-). It worked for me, but I'm not sure if it will work for others as of yet.\n\nA: Unchecking the checkbox prevents the application from using those services.\nYou cannot remove the listings directly from this window as they have requested these permissions in the past. For non-system apps like Chrome, you can remove the application from your machine and it will remove the listing from the privacy pane.\n", "Q: document.querySelector with AppleScript / Safari I need a script to open each tab in safari when I get \"valueIneed\" from an internal website \nhere is the HTML tag \n<td class=\"orderDetails\">\n\n\n    <p class=\"details\">\n        (My Certificate)\n    </p>\n\nhere is what I tried this but this is failing \ntell application \"Safari\"\n    do JavaScript \"\n        var forgiveStatus = document.querySelector('class[details\\\"(My Certificate).innerHTML;\n        \" in current tab of first window\n    set checkvalue to (do JavaScript \"theStatus;\" in current tab of first window) as string\nend tell\n\nfor more information it's could have multiple instance of the same tag, and I need to open each one in a new tab, or even better click on them one after one \n\nA: You haven't closed any quotes or brackets.

My flashdrive now has the name \"Install macOS High Sierra\" and it contains the app \"Install macOS High Sierra.app\". Now comes my confusion. What do I do now. The directions end here. Should I run the app and install it on the same disk? Or should I do nothing. My intent was to make a flashdrive that I could use to boot a Mac computer. If my disk drive crashes i still want to be able to start and run my computer. My flashdrive is 64 GB partitioned into 2 32 GB partitions. I intended to copy a few apps onto the other 32 GB partition. What should I do now?\n\nA: You may want to delete your answer to your own question. \nIn fact:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert bootable flash drive \n\n*Open said drive and launch the Install Mac OS High Sierra app\n\n*Follow the prompts\n\n\nYou could also reboot the system with the flash drive inserted and holding the Option key. When the drive selector comes up choose your flash drive and installation will commence.\nIf you run the OS install app from the Applications folder it will install it onto your boot drive. You could do that to install the OS on a thumb drive (just select that drive during OS install) as that makes a good emergency boot drive but it won't make an installer drive.\n", "Q: Why is Target Disk Mode so slow? Two macs:\n\n\n*\n\n*maxed out 2017 MacBook Pro (MBP)\n\n*base model iMac Pro (iMP)\n\n\nUsing the MBP standalone, the internal drive gives me read & write speeds of about 2600 & 2000 MB/s respectively.\nUsing the iMP standalone, the internal drive gives me read & write speeds of about 2500 & 2900 MB/s respectively.\nAll pretty darn good, obviously.\nNow, in separate tests, I connect each to the other in Target Disk Mode over Thunderbolt 3 (using a short 1 foot cable so as not to lose the maximum 40Gb/s speed).\nBooting the iMP from its internal drive and then connecting the MBP in Target Disk Mode, testing the MBP (Target Disk) I get read & write speeds of about 450 & 700 MB/s respectively.\nThen the reverse: Booting the MBP from its internal drive and then connecting the iMP in Target Disk Mode, testing the iMP (Target Disk) I get read & write speeds of about 200 & 250 MB/s respectively!!\nWhat on earth is going on?  Thunderbolt 3 in real world tests with any other fast enough drive is capable of at least about 2800 MB/s.  Does anyone know why Target Disk Mode is so slow?  \nI understand there's the obvious speculative answer of \"Well something else relating specifically to Target Disk Mode is obviously bottle-necking it.\"  Ok... obviously.  But I'm wondering if anyone knows anything specific on the technical level of what's going on, and if there's anything that can be done to improve it.\nGiven the iMP drive over Target Disk Mode being so slow, even significantly slower than the MBP when really it should be the reverse, I'm guessing there's something the T2 chip is doing that's bottlenecking it, but again, just wondering if anyone knows anything official or definitive, rather than just speculation.\nThanks!\n\nA: For the touch-bar 13\" MBP the right side ports have reduced bandwidth, this could explain a portion of the difference in speed between the two modes. However, you will likely never see the full speed while running in TDM, that is because TDM runs as a UEFI application within the UEFI rom, this limits the resources that can be used in targeted disk mode. Thunderbolt bridge should get you full speed, if that is an option for your use case. \n\nOther boot-related features, such as Target Disk Mode, the Startup\n  Manager, and the firmware password user interface, are all implemented\n  as UEFI applications built into the main UEFI firmware.\n\n", "Q: Stop app from showing multiple icons in Dock is showing up multiple times in the Dock. It's only open once. How do i stop this?\nI have opened an app once, but it shows up two more times in a different middle section between two lines.\n\nIs this an app misbehaviour or an macOS one? I can't tell and I'm not sure where to troubleshoot. This is the only app it happens with.\n\nA: Apps with support for opening documents minimize into Dock in their own separate icon. To disable that behaviour, check Minimise windows into application icon under System Preferences → Dock.\nmacOS Mojave has a configuration to show recently used app's icon in the Dock (just like in iOS 11 and later). To disable it, uncheck Show recent applications in Dock under System Preferences → Dock.\n\n", "Q: Problem with displaying file path in Finder's Get Info -> Where I occasionally need to check some file's location and copy it to the clipboard. I used to use Finder -> Cmd-I then I used to copy the content of \"Where\" section.\nEver since updating to macOs Mojave, the format of the path displayed in the \"Where\" section has changed. Instead of \"/\" forward slash character now I see \"triangle\" character.\n\nHow to solve this?\nThanks!\n\nA: You can select the file and press Option + Command + C to copy the pathname to the clipboard.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/252179/192890\nYou can also use Control + Option + right click in macOS Mojave (copy as pathname will replace copy file in get info modal). Little change but I just found it.

I've checked all the files/directories in /var/db/sudo/ts and they're all owned by root:wheel. My user is in the admin and staff groups -- this I have not changed. What would cause this?

I would probably boot to internet recovery and reinstall the os on top of what you have. If you have a backup, great and if not this isn’t a risky operation and something is certainly messed up with the permissions and sudo failures. \nUnless you have a very good idea why things are specifically broken, perhaps some scripts to change ownership or other sorts of administrative changes that you know were made to that system, it’s probably a lot faster to just get a get operating system and then fix any remaining problems every install doesn’t solve immediately. \n\nA: As confirmed by OP...\nthe user profile might be compromised.\nCreate new user and try following (hopefully without Permission errors).\nsudo mv /usr/local/Homebrew /usr/local/Homebrew.old\n\nsudo mv /usr/local/Homebrew.old /tmp\n\n", "Q: How do I disable the charging chime with Mojave on 2018 a MacBook?

Very simple fix, really. \nUNPLUG the charging cable and block from both the wall and the MacBook and just let it sit for about 2-3 minutes to discharge and, what I'm told, reset (something internal).  After that, plug it in at both ends and see what happens.\n(goes without mentioning this is in regards to using the stock Apple charging adapter and cable appropriate for the MacBook, of course.)\nLooking/thinking back on this, I kinda jumped the gun and assumed your problem is that the periodic charge beeping continues no matter what you do, restart, etc., like what happened to me.

I actually noticed the MX512 stopped working a few months back, although Airprint was definitely still working with my MX452 until the most recent update. Both printers work fine with my laptop. What could be the cause/how can I fix this?\n\nA: I have had the same issue.  The only way, temporary at best, I could see the printer from my iOS device was to change the Bonjour name of the printer from the local network site for the printer.  Works once, and then same issue recurs, though.\n\nA: With several versions of iOS 12 out, if you still have this issue with updating your iOS, it’s clear you’ll need to get into troubleshooting your network or contact the vendor of your printer. \nAirPrint still works on iOS 12 and if there were widespread issues, we would have a whole lot more questions here about it. \nAlso, have you wiped your iPhone and restored it as new (or done an erase all content and settings) and then tested AirPrint without loading your backup?

I'm a web developer and I want to use Brave as my browser for the normal stuff, and Firefox Developer for Web Development. \nCurrently Brave is my default, but when I do npm run serve or whatever my web dev sites open in it too, whereas I'd like those to open in Firefox Developer. \nThe difference is basically that webdev sites are always pointing toward localhost, so is it possible to get localhost to open in one browser and everything else in another? (MacBook Pro, Mojave)\n\nA: There are a few apps that I think might be able to accomplish this.\nThe first that I would recommend is Choosy ($10, trial available). That's the one that I use. I recommend it first because you can download it and try it before you pay for it.\nThere's also Browser Fairy which is $5, but it's in the Mac App Store, and there's no trial version available. I own it also, and I think it's good, but I have had Choosy for ages and it continues to work for me, so I've stuck with it.\nI would recommend checking out Choosy, and see if it does what you want.

On my iPhone 7 Plus, after I upgraded to iOS 12.0.01, the touch screen stopped working. I'd restart it, but the touchscreen just doesn't work at all (so I can't slide it to \"off\").\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple is no longer signing iOS v11.4 so you cannot downgrade the iOS version. I've seen a few scattered instances of iPhone 7 touch not working on iOS 12. The common denominator seems to be aftermarket screens.\nThis is similar to the issue we had back when iOS 11 came out and lower quality aftermarket screens were also affected but on a much wider scale. You could contact Apple support or Store but they will probably just want you to replace the screen for an Apple original.\nIf you can't or don't want to do that, then go back to the shop that repaired your screen in the first place and see if they have an \"original-quality\" screen they can try to help troubleshoot the issue. Otherwise, you will have to wait until (if ?) this gets corrected in the next release. \n", "Q: Edit TCC.db to bypass \"'Foo.app' wants access to control 'Bar.app'\" on own machine I make extensive use of Apple Events to control a wide variety of applications on my machine. The new security prompts introduced in Mojave are crippling.\n\nIn previous versions of macOS, once an app was granted permission to \"control your computer\", it was able to send Apple events to any other app on your machine. In Mojave, this permission must be manually granted once for each app being controlled.\nOnce a user grants access, their selection is stored in one of two sqlite databases:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\n\n*/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that #2 is only visible to the root user.\n\n*Note that System Integrity Protection is disabled.\n\n\n\nWould it be possible to edit these sqlite databases directly to automatically grant permissions and bypass these security prompts? \n\nA: To access the TCC.db database directly is no longer supported by Apple, even if you disable SIP, because of their policy of protecting users from big companies that like to track everything you do online, and also used to do this stealthy bypass without asking permission to users. However, even in Mojave, there is a way to circumvent this, but with a catch: that only works if a given computer is enrolled in an MDM program.

When I save a phone number to a contact from a received phone call, iOS includes the US country calling code \"1\" at the front of the number (eg 1 (999) 555-1234). \nWhen I save a number from a received text message, iOS or macOS adds the US country code \"+1\" to the front of the number (eg +1 (999) 555-1234). \nThe discrepancy by app (Messages vs Phone) in formats of saved numbers might differ per carrier (mine is T-Mobile—does your carrier handle differently?). It's certainly messy to see numbers auto-saved differently, which is annoying. Also noteworthy: iOS adds neither a one nor a plus-one to five-digit robo-numbers that I save.\nEverything works fine with \"+1\" or \"1\" or nothing before the area code, when using my SIM-free phone for US numbers while within the United States. \nBut when I manually enter new phone numbers into Contacts app on iPhone or MacBook, should I best save them with \"+1\" or \"1\" or with nothing before the area code? Which format is more future-proof (such as when local or national calling rules change)? Which is better for international travel? \n\nA: With fixed location landlines if we wanted to dial a number in another country, we dial the “exit code” first.  In the United States the Exit Code is 011 and is often referred to as the international dialing prefix.  Dialing 011 told the phone system to expect a country code next.  \nDialing patterns and parsing had to updated with mobile phones.  The + symbol became the international prefix that stands for ‘what follows is a complete dialing instruction including country code’ and no further parsing attempts are necessary. \nBut why not just country code? Why do we need the plus(+)?  If 1 is the United States country code isn’t that enough?  Not really, let’s say I’m visiting in Mexico and have my friend in the US 7 digit number stored as 523-xxxx (which is parsed correctly IF I’m at home in the US AND within my local area code) and I try to call that.  Is the 52 at the start of the number Mexico’s country code 52 or is it something else?  If we take pop culture into account is 867-5309 a 7 digit US number or is it a short code in China (country code 86)?  Dialing from a landline it’s treated as a local number because we didn’t dial the exit code 011 first.  \nWithout a plus the carrier has to further apply parsing rules, how many digits were dialed?  Are there digit combinations that mean something?  If it was 7 digit could this be a local, if it’s 10 digit it might be an area code and phone number in the US, or it might not be.  If its 11 digits starting with 1 it’s probably a US number.  But in some countries local numbers might start with a 1, in fact some counties use 111 as an emergency number.  \nFor most compatibility always add the + prefix.  It doesn’t matter where you are (I.e. which carrier is hosting your connection) it’s understood that what follows the + is a compete dialing instruction including country code, area code (if applicable), and local number.  (1 is the country code for United States)\n", "Q: TimeMachine backup broken after upgrading After recently upgrading my Mac, TimeMachine started suggesting that it had verified the integrity of the backup and that I needed to start a new backup. I have my backup on a NAS mounted as afs on my Mac. However, when I looked at the files in the backup, macOS had renamed my TimeMachine backup to .purgeable.sparsebundle.

I assume that once that happens, the system memory footprint is going to increase in order to buffer these displays, reducing the amount of unswapped/uncompressed RAM I have available for other tasks.  Please contribute with practical measurements of memory usage before and after plugging in the extra 4k display.\n\nA: There's not really any significant amount of extra main memory usage for buffers due to having dual 4k-displays. \nIndirectly the total main memory usage might increase because some will tend to run more programs at the same time, have more windows and documents open at the same time, etc. - and that will lead to higher main memory usage.\nIt is correct that the Intel Iris Plus 655 in the MBP uses main memory for its video memory (i.e. up to 1.5 GB of main memory is shared between the CPU and the GPU). However, it is not actually a specific process using more memory in Activity Monitor, but rather a case that there's less main memory available in total. \nThe size of that extra memory usage for buffers is so little that it is not really noticeable in common usage. For example a video buffer for a 4k display will take up something like 32 MB of memory. That's less than half a percent of even the 8 GB on the MBP with the least amount of RAM.\nAgain, the indirect usage might be bigger, because you might be loading up more advanced games than you would have done with the extra monitors - and they might use up much more video ram (for textures, etc.) than just the buffers themselves.\n", "Q: Open and focus file browsing dialog from command line I'd like to open the native file browsing dialog from the command line, focus the dialog, and then get the full path of the selected file.\nThe following works nicely, but the dialog is not focused and therefore can't be controlled via the keyboard:\nosascript -l JavaScript -e \"var app = Application.currentApplication();\n    app.includeStandardAdditions = true;\n    app.chooseFile().toString();\"\n\nThanks for any help.,\n\nA: I have some Karabiner-EventViewer experience and found out that your \"currentApplication()\" is not Terminal, as one would think, but actually osascript.\nTherefore …\nosascript -l JavaScript -e \"var app = Application(\\\"Terminal\\\");\n    app.includeStandardAdditions = true;\n    app.chooseFile().toString();\"\n\n… will at least give you keyboard control.\n", "Q: FaceTime and iMessage - an error occurred during activation I couldn't log in to FaceTime so I did a factory reset of my MacBook.

If I create a new column, the only options are to use built-in summary functions (see below) - I can't enter my own formula.\nExample of smart categories:\n\nOptions for \"Ratio\" column:\n\n\nA: While it's not (currently) possible to place custom values in the column you desire, it is possible to refer to the operands elsewhere, such as by using a secondary table to refer to the cells in question. To make a formula point to a certain category’s subtotal, hold ⌥ option and click on the desired cell.\nUnfortunately, this method does require the categories to be entered manually, so it may not be suitable for all situations.\nHere is a demonstration using your example table, with a secondary table holding ratio values for each of the categories:\n\n\nA: It looks like Numbers doesn't yet support custom formulas here. You can reference those cells from other locations, but you can't actually use them for grouping unfortunately.\n", "Q: Automatically answer phone call on iPhone Is it possible to set up my iPhone to automatically answer phone call for me?\nI work in an environment where I constantly receive a number of incoming phone calls. To make it physically less straining, I use my iPhone connected with my EarPods. It's a hassle to pick up the iPhone and slide on screen, or to reach out to press the button near microphone of my EarPods to answer the call.\nI would also like to have a mechanism to configure the duration of time my iPhone rings before the call is automatically answered.\nI generally answer every call that I receive, irrespective of the caller. However, it would be nice to have the ability to know the name of the caller if the caller is a contact saved in my phonebook.\nI am using an iPhone 8 running iOS 12.0.1.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to set up my iPhone to automatically answer phone call for me?\n\nYes, there is a built-in accessibility setting that you can use for exactly this task.\nOn your iPhone, in Settings app, navigate to General → Accessibility → Call Audio Routing (Last item under Interaction section) → Auto-Answer Calls. Tap on the switch shown against Auto-Answer Calls to enable it. (The setting is turned off by default)\n\nOnce enabled, you'll get the option to configure the duration of time to wait before a call is automatically answered.

I tried to fix it doing the things recommended online, but could not find the cause or prevent it from happening again. \nIt started or better I started noticing it, when I started using Safari after I upgraded my current installation to Mojave when it came out. Before I used Chrome. \nHere what happened and what I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I checked my extensions. The only extensions I have in safari are: 1password, buffer, getpocket and todoist which are all as far as I know very reputable companies. \n\n*I downloaded and ran malwarebytes which found nothing\n\n*I made a full scan with Avast Business Antivirus* which found nothing\n\n*I have no custom profiles installed, as there is no Profiles tab in my System Preferences\n\n*I am still using Chrome and did not experience anything similar.\n\n\nIt could be a malicious website or a malicious ad on a website. I did not check every time, but when I checked I only had tabs open to pages like stackoverflow, aws.com, jira and my server.\nWhat else can I check?\nThis is one of the pages that is opened.

(github link)\n[update 2] \nbased on Geoff's question I also checked the \"Automation\" pane in \"Security and Privacy\" prefpane and the Safari pop-up settings, but both look innocent. The 10.101.101.23 is my local server running jupyter notebook.\n\"Unfortunately\" there were no further pop ups. Maybe it were a series of malicious ads on one of the seemingly reputable sites I was using.\n\"Automation\" pane in \"Security and Privacy\" prefpane\n\nSafari pop-up settings\n\n\nA: So, first of all, let's break this down. There seems to be four distinct issue here:\n\n\n*\n\n*So, you're experiencing unwanted malware phishing popups, linking especially to that one you linked.\n\n*You're worried there is possibly malware on your machine already, causing these popups.\n\n*You think this may have to do with Safari as opposed to Chrome.\n\n*You're asking how to \"debug\" this.\nSo, lets break this down.\n\n\n*\n\n*The particular link you cited is very interesting, because it is a very new malware variant. I went ahead and tested it, and all the signing certificates and SSL certificates used are still valid, and it successfully infects. The installer package was signed on Friday (four days ago), and by modification dates, it looks like the code for this was finished on the 15th. (I've now reported all of this to Apple and the various SSL certificate issuers and I expect all this will be revoked in the next 24 hours.) And, thankfully, a Malwarebytes scan successfully detected it as a variant, and caught it; it was able to clean everything.\n\n*So, if you've performed a recent Malwarebytes scan (in addition to the steps you've taken above), I'd say the chances you are infected are very, very unlikely.\n\n*So, given how new this particular piece of malware is, are you sure that this behavior does not also occur in Chrome? Because when I visit that link in Chrome, it \"checks out\" there too. For the time being.\n\n*So really, IMHO, it really comes down to the issue of popups. The thing is, Safari, by default, blocks all popups. Have you disabled this? Have you whitelisted certain sites to allow popups from them? Because that's the only way I can really think of why you would be getting popups at all, and you haven't mentioned anything about checking your Safari settings other than your extensions and plugins. However, it is also possible that some other application you have has been compromised; almost anything can execute something like:\n#!/usr/bin/env osascript\n\ntell application \"Safari\"\n  tell front window\n     make new tab at end of tabs with properties {URL:\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/339620\"}\n  end tell\nend tell\n\nBut you would have had to have authorized it to control Safari. If you go to your Security and Privacy prefpane, what have you authorized under \"Automation\" to control Safari or System Events?\n", "Q: Error: unable to open database in macOS Mojave sqlite3 ~/Library/Mail/V6/MailData/Envelope\\ Index vacuum;\nError: unable to open database \"/Users/Me/Library/Mail/V6/MailData/Envelope Index\": \nunable to open database file\n\nThis happened after upgrading to Mojave.\n\nA: I was having this issue and solved it before posting the question. I was also having other quirky permissions issues within Terminal after upgrading to Mojave. \nI stumbled upon this and thought I would share here, since I don't normally consult the more casual Mac user pages: Fix Terminal “Operation not permitted” Error in MacOS Mojave\nBasically, you need to add Terminal.app to have Full Disk Access within System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy tab. \n"]
