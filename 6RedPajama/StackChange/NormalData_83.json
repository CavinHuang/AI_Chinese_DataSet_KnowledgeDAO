I have an \"old\" late 2015 iMac 21,5\" that I want to use for photography in the studio (for quality control). But even when it was new it wasn't the fastest because of the slow CPU and no SSD.\nSpecs:\n\n*\n\n*macOS Catalina 10.15.7\n\n*21,5\", late 2015\n\n*1,6 GHz Dual Core i5\n\n*8 GB Ram\n\n*HDD\n\n*Intel HD 6000  1536 MB\n\nMy question is, when I upgrade to Monterey, will I get a performance boost? Or will it get even worse? I've read that newer macOS is more optimized also for older machines. Is that true?\nWhen I google for it I only find ways to install new macOS on unsupported devices. But this iMac is one of the last that is supported.\nEven open the settings app is super laggy. Currently I can work with it somehow, but it could be better.\n\nA: There's no universal answer to that question. It depends on your workload, which applications you use, what you use them for, how often and to what extent, etc.\nYou could make a backup of your complete system - upgrade and test your new system. If you do not like the new system, you can roll back using the backup.\n", "Q: Mono process running even though it was never installed nor can be found on disk I noticed that a process named 'mono' was running with high CPU usage. The thing is, I have never installed mono, nor can I find it anywhere on my disk.\nThe only program that I have installed that might use mono is powershell, but I couldn't find any information on whether this makes use of mono. I also wasn't running powershell at the time when I noticed the high CPU usage.\nI have found some articles mentioning that mono is used on macOS in some malware, but those articles are old and the vulnerability seems to have been fixed by Apple. Still might it be reason for concern that mono is running on my system?\n\nA: I assume you've used Activity Monitor to find the process. There you can just double-click the process in order to get more information about it - such as for example which program started it. That should hopefully make it possible for you to figure out, which program you're using that has started mono.\nPowerShell is a .NET program that runs on .NET (Core). Today, .NET Core and Mono have merged and it is the same program. So it does sound likely that this process was started due to you using PowerShell. You can use the above mentioned method to find out - or you could simply kill mono using Activity Monitor and then start up PowerShell and see if you get a new mono process.\nNo, there's as such nothing about having mono running that would directly lead you to suspect having malware. The old articles you have found definitely are no cause of concern at all. They actually describe the opposite of what you think. I.e. the malware does not install mono, rather it preys on users that already have mono installed. So there's nothing that indicates that having mono running means that it was put there by malware.\n\nA: If you are running VS code and have the C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp) extension installed then it is likely that mono is from that extension. I disabled the extension, exited VS code, killed the mono process(es) and restarted VS code and mono was gone.\nLooks like mono will be removed from this extension at some point.\nhttps://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/5120\n", "Q: ZSH shell setting up paths I'm trying to install and set up the following program on my Mac Big Sur.\nhttps://bondxray.org/software/aline.html\nI unpacked it on /Applications. However, my knowledge is quite limited and I can't figure out how to set it up for a zsh shell. I can't find the .zshrc file so I can add lines to it and set up the software for its use.\nCould someone give me a hand?\n\nA: Assuming you installed it into /Applications/aline:\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Run echo 'ALINEHOME=/Applications/aline; export ALINEHOME' >> ~/.zshrc\n\n*Run echo 'PATH=$ALINEHOME/bin:$PATH; export PATH' >> ~/.zshrc\n\n*Open a new Terminal tab and run echo $PATH to check whether the path is set correctly\n\n*Run aline\nPS: The page you link seems to be rather old, so I wouldn't be surprised if some of the prerequisites are not fullfilled any more in recent versions of macOS.\n\nA: Presumably this issue is resolved but here are a couple general tips and an alternate method.\n\nOn modern MacOS versions, while in Finder, the keyboard shortcut ⌘ Command+⇧ Shift+. period will toggle the display of invisible files.\nThe zsh config file .zshrc, starting with a period, will be invisible by default, and if configuration of the shell is unchanged will be found in the user's home directory. /Users/your-name. From the terminal it is always possible to type open ~ to access the home folder in Finder.\nThe other answer provides a programmatic way to add to the PATH. It creates the intermediate environment variable ALINEHOME which can be useful for concision and separation.\nThis variable referencing where the aline program resides is appended to .zshrc with the part of the commands >> ~/.zshrc.\n\nNext, what is the PATH and why is it involved here?\n\nThe Unix PATH is an environment variable that tells the shell which directories it should look for when you issue commands. You can think of it like a list of Application or Program Files folders. (source)\n\nNumerous commands/programs can be run from the terminal by default. For example, the open command itself. Nothing needs to be configured to run open just by referencing its name from any terminal.\nThe executable file for open is contained in the folder /usr/bin among many other programs.\n\nSince an environmental variable like PATH is accessible any any time—throughout the entire environment—the shell always knows to have commands like open on deck because /usr/bin is on the PATH.\n\n\nAn additional method for 'installing' the program in question. Reference this answer;\nzsh, \"Z-shell\", in particular allows for a more readable syntax to add to the PATH.\npath+=(/Applications/aline)\n\naline will become available anywhere (next time you load up a shell/open the terminal).\nOr, if for example aline was in a subdirectory /Applications/programs,\npath+=(/Applications/programs)\n\naline will be available along with anything else in that subdirectory.\n+ is the operative. Setting any variable like a=1 would replace its previous contents. The preexisting elements are important to retain on the PATH so the syntax += is a handy way to append instead of reset.\nThese lines, path+=(...), would be added to the .zshrc file in the same way. You could add the lines programmatically with the other method mentioned, or open the file in a text editor and type them manually. A foolproof way to open the file with TextEdit is by typing open -e ~/.zshrc.\n", "Q: Using iOS “Shortcuts” app, once I define a shortcut, how can I call it from the automations tab? So basically what I have done is define a simple iOS “Shortcut” that has a name (“Ask the cleaning lady to come”). It simply cues up a short text message to a lady in my contacts and asks me if I want to send it before it goes out.\nThat’s great, now I just need to create an Automation (same iOS app, but the center nav option currently) that will run “Ask the cleaning lady to come” every Monday at 10AM, let’s say.\nRight now, I can’t figure out a way to do this other than rewrite all of the instructions inside of the Automation itself. I can’t call the previously written “Shortcut”. Even worse, when the automation is run, it’s only telling me “Do you want to Send Message?”.\nI should be able to have it ask me if I want to “Ask the cleaning lady to come”, while not making me rewrite the instructions, and hopefully I’ve just overlooked that capability. It seems so obvious that you could call your Shortcuts for Automations run from within from the same app\nI hope I’ve made myself clear, thanks for your help\n\nA: You need to use the action Run from Shortcuts app. Let me explain:\nCreate the automation, choose the time of the day or whatever... I'm assuming you know how to do that part. At some moment in the process you'll get to a screen where it says in a button Add action. Here is when you can call that Shortcut that already exists:\n\n*\n\n*Tap Add Action\n\n\n*Choose the Apps tab\n\n\n\n*Scroll down looking for the app Shortcuts\n\n\n\n*Select it and choose the option Run Shortcut\n\n\n\n*Tap the input to be able to choose a Shortcut\n\n\n\nNOTE: Tapping in the rounded arrow you'll see an input to pass a variable to the shortcut. This is useful if your shortcut needs to receive some value to perform the operations.\n\n\n\n*Choose your shortcut in the list. After choosing it, you should see something like this. At this moment you're almost done with the automation. Tap on Next.\n\n\n\n\n*You'll get to the following screen. Here, before confirming the automation creation, disable the Ask Before Running toggle so you don't need to interact with the phone before the execution starts. When tapping the toggle, you'll be asked to confirm.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: If your shortcut requires you to answer some question, you'll also need to interact with the phone. You'll get a notification to do this when the shortcut arrives the point where you need to interact.\n\n\n\n*After all these steps you're ready to confirm the automation creation by tapping the button Done.\n\n", "Q: Explicitly tasking Keychain Access to sync It is not clear to me if Keychain Access syncs up with peer devices on the network or if the username/password data is stored in iCloud (yikes, vulnerability).\nFrom macOS Catalina or newer, is there a GUI method or terminal command (preferable) to prompt Keychain Access to sync up with a source?\nGuidance from Apple forums is iffy / spotty: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250193336 in the sense recommendation is to toggle iCloud Keychain.\n\n\nA: As you have enabled (per your screenshot) iCloud sync for Keychain - the Keychain is synced with iCloud. It's not a vulnerability in itself.\nKeychains are never synced peer-to-peer on the network.\nThere's no command line tool to choose to sync the Keychain with a peer on your local network, as there's no peer-to-peer sync at all.\nNote that Keychain Sync occurring via iCloud does not mean that the Keychain data is simply stored in iCloud Drive. That is not how this works.\nInstead the iCloud Keychain uses a completely separate manner of synchronisation that builds on a \"circle of trust\" model. This means that unless you give Apple your Keychain credentials, they cannot read the contents of the Keychain - even when synced with iCloud. This is also true for when you need to do a full Keychain recovery.\nIn regards to Apple Forums - please be aware that you're communicating with Apple employees, but other users like yourself. However, the link you have shown does not as such recommend users to enable Keychain Syncing. The original question states that the user has already enabled Keychain Syncing, but believes it not to be working - where another user recommends turning syncing off and back on again.\n", "Q: How to summon credentials from Keychain Access? The website: https://ritx-fl-sales.bswa.net has username / password fields:\n\nFor some reason the fields do not prompt Keychain access.   Is there a work-around to summoning the password manager to type a selected username/pw credential into their respective fields?\n\nA: The reason those fields do not prompt Keychain access is that the developer of the web site has done it incorrectly (unless they were intentionally aiming to avoid people using password managers).\nBasically in order to prompt Keychain access, the developer needs to mark the fields as being for username/password. They can do that explicitly using the autocomplete attribute, which they can set to username, password or even new-password when you want to create a new password. It can also be done implicitly merely by having the name of the input field be usernameand password (or user and pass and similar variants).\nThis particular web site has some odd name choices for the fields, as they have named them txtUserID and txtPassword.\nLuckily they have marked the password field as being a password type (meaning that the entered text should not be viewed) - therefore you should be able to click on the password field to focus it, and then click the small key icon that appears on right in the field. From there you can select to fill password from Keychain.\n", "Q: Share purchases without sharing payment method with Family I just found out that all of the purchases made in my family account (Me, my girlfriend, my dad, and her dad) all get charged to my payment method after a week or two of random charges on my PayPal from Apple.\nApparently, this is tied to the purchase sharing feature of the Family. I'd still like to share my purchases, as my girlfriend uses apps that I bought, but I dont want to share the payment.\nSo I have 3 questions.\n\n*\n\n*Can I enable sharing past purchases without sharing payment\n\nIf not, can I\n\n\n*Check who made what purchase and when\n\nand\n\n\n*Can the family members choose to use a different payment method.\n\nThanks!\n\nA: \nI just found out that all of the purchases made in my family account … all get charged to my payment method…\n\nThis is expected behavior. Per Apple Support; How to share purchases with your family it states the following\n\nOne adult in the family — the family organizer — pays for everyone's purchases. You can share apps, music, books, and more\n\nEmphasis Mine\nThe idea is that a family unit where a designated parent/guardian sets up family sharing with one person responsible for permissions and the ability to control billing, thus the single payer setup. See below from the same link.\n\nWhen you turn on purchase sharing, everyone in your family gets access to apps, music, movies, TV shows, and books that family members buy. The family organizer is billed for family members' purchases.\n\nTechnically speaking, your girlfriend isn’t part of the family unit (yet).  iCloud has many mechanisms to share items (pictures, documents, calendars, etc.) without having to be part of a family plan.\nIf you want your girlfriend as part of the family plan, but want to regulate purchases, you’ll need to enable Ask to Buy\nTD;DR\nAnswering your questions (in order)…\n\n*\n\n*Workaround.  You can share all purchases and prevent people people from making purchases without authorization by enabling Ask to Buy.\n\n*No.  Only one person, the organizer, has payment authority. This is by design.\n\n*No.  Same as prior answer. Family members cannot have their own payment methods.  If you need this, remove them from the family plan and manually share the services (Photos, Calendar, Files, etc.) as needed.\n\n\nA: \nCan I enable sharing past purchases without sharing payment\n\nNo, sharing purchases is tied to sharing payment methods. This is likely to prevent people overusing this feature.\nYou can ask all members of your family to keep a balance on their accounts, which will always be billed first, and only by them. Balances are not shared.\n\nCheck who made what purchase and when\n\nWhen you receive the email receipt, it will detail who made the purchase and on what device. The purchaser's Apple ID will be shown in the Apple ID field of the receipt, and the name of the device used will be shown under the purchased items.\nAdditionally, the Bill To will show payment methods - this will indicate whether it was charged to Account Balance (of the purchaser) or to your shared card. If it was split across two methods, the subtotal lines will indicate the breakdown.\n\nCan the family members choose to use a different payment method.\n\nFamily Members can load a balance onto their account and charge it directly. Otherwise, they have to use the family payment method, or disconnect from purchase sharing.\n", "Q: Google Drive installed itself in /Volumes not /Users/username I am using a Mac running OS 12.1. I am switching to Google Drive from another cloud service.\nI didn't notice it at the time of installation, but it installed to /Volumes/GoogleDrive, with My Drive and Shared drives subdirectories.\nShould I keep it here, or should I move it to ../Users/[adamg]? What would be the advantage/disadvantage of  each location? Which would be easier for syncing between the cloud and my local machine?\n\nA: Apple is about to force all cloud sync products on macOS to use the system cloud file provider framework by cutting off FUSE and KAUTH type kernel extensions on macOS 12.3. This quarter is a very confusing time to understand how each provider has [or not] prepared us for this cutoff at the last possible moment.\nIf google drive in your case is already using the FileProvider Framework introduced on macOS 10.15 you can consult their guide and decide if you leave the sync folder alone.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.google.com/drive/answer/10309431?hl=en\n\n*https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7329379/#macos&zippy=%2Cuse-google-drive-for-desktop-on-macos-high-sierra-or-newer\nI was not able to find any specific technical guidance on google drive, but welcome edits if others know better.\nYou probably want to leave the files where they are and make shortcuts to them until you’re sure google is done with changing their code and app and you’re sure you are using the new file provider frameworks for macOS.\n\nA: As you have discovered, Google Drive install creates a volume called GoogleDrive (no space in the middle). This is not a real volume in the sense that it is an APFS volume. Rather it is a bit of software magic. The installation also creates an alias Google Drive (with a space) in your home folder pointing to /Volumes/GoogleDrive.\nAs far as I can tell, and if you have elected to \"Stream Files\", the cache for locally stored Google Drive files in in ~/Library/Application Support/Google/DriveFS.\nIf you have chosen to \"Mirror Files\" then all your Google Drive is synchronised to the location you specify. As before the installation creates an alias Google Drive in your home folder which points to the location you have chosen.\nNote that, unlike the current OneDrive, you make a clear choice between steaming and mirroring your Google Drive cloud.\nThe above all works with macOS 12.3 beta 1, so may continue to work (without a Google update) with the release of macOS 12.3 (in April??). Someone else may have a more authoritative position on that.\nI am unclear as to whether Google Drive has or has not made the transition to the Apple File Provider Framework, but note that it still uses the green tick mark for downloaded files when streaming files.\n\nA: Presumably, if you did not alter the default settings, the application installer selected that location as to be the most suitable.\nDepending on your system configuration the advantages and disadvantages may vary. So a list cannot be given without examining your specific configuration. A possible example of why moving it into a specific user directory may be disadvantageous would be that it would introduce issues if another user on your computer were to access the program, or some specific feature thereof.\nObviously if you don’t intend to ever allow another user access to the program this would not be an issue. But there may be other issues peculiar to your configuration.\n", "Q: homebrew installed librdkafka to /opt/homebrew/Cellar/ instead of /usr/local/Cellar/ I'm on Mac Monterey (Apple cpu) and I've installed librdkafka:\nhttps://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka\nusing homebrew.

I assume Homebrew should have installed to /usr/local/Cellar?\nWhat has caused this problem/how can i fix the default installation path and how can I fix the librdkafka installation path?\n\nA: Homebrew uses different destination folders for different architectures (see https://docs.brew.sh/Installation for details). In short, /usr/local is for Intel, /opt/homebrew for Apple Silicon (yes, it is ARM).\nAs for your makefile - you will likely have to adjust the following environment variables to the proper location.

(since `pin` has no `--cask` option) I hope there is a command equivalent for casks that works to ignore updates on main line packages.\nbrew upgrade --ignore <FORMULA>\n\nThis Stack Overflow question from 2014 has multiple answers that mention brew pin as a solution, but that feature does not work for casks:\n\n*\n\n*Ignore formula on brew upgrade\nHow is it possible to ignore a formula by name while upgrading packages in Homebrew with brew upgrade?\n\nA: Workaround\nYou can use buo/homebrew-cask-ugrade, which is a third-party tool with extra cask upgrade features, including pin.\nbrew tap buo/cask-upgrade    # Install `brew-cask-upgrade`\nbrew cu pin <CASK_NAME>      # Pin the cask you want\n\nReason for workaround\nIt looks like the Homebrew maintainer will not allow pinning of casks, because many casks auto-update, which Homebrew technically can't prevent from happening.\nFrom a comment on homebrew/homebrew-cask: Allow pinning casks #49127:\n\nA huge chunk of casks auto-update and we can’t stop that. So pin would at best be inconsistent and not work in a lot of cases.\n\n\nA: If you are willing to write some BASH code, this can be done in a one liner using brew list and grep --invert-match:\nbrew upgrade $(brew list | grep --invert-match <FORMULA>)\n\nEssentially, we just filter the list of packages installed by brew and filter the one called <FORMULA> using grep's inverted matching.\nTested with brew 3.4.3 on GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin20).\n\nA: I discovered a much nicer solution for this:\nAdd auto_updates true to the cask file that you want to exclude from brew upgrade. This way, the cask is still fully managed by brew and can even be upgraded by using brew upgrade --greedy.\n\nold answer\n\nI found another workaround that will also somewhat work with brew upgrade by simply removing the Cask file from /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-cask/Casks.\nAfter removing the file, brew no longer checks the cask for updates and therefore does not even list it in brew upgrade anymore. Keep in mind that this will definitely break all other operations with this cask.\nMy issue was that I had to pin the version of a JDK as brew would try to upgrade it to a newer version which was not available in production yet.

I am using a Mac mini for playing media from a local network media server connected by cable (Ethernet). This Mac stays on 24/7 and is prohibited from accessing the Internet (router firewall).\nRecently I noted that 4K movie playback had become jerky. Upon investigation I found out that the top speed at which the Mac could retrieve data from the media server was only about 11 MB/s (whereas other computers on the network were getting x10 faster speeds).\nI simply rebooted the Mac and — bingo — the speed skyrocketed to 110 MB/s, and 4K movies started playing fine again.\nWhat was that? How can I investigate what was throttling the speed?\nIf it matters, this is 2020 model (M1), Big Sur 11.5.1.\n\nA: There could be many reasons for the reduced speed - it is impossible to know with the information you have gathered so far. It could be a problem with your media server, the local network (switches, etc.), the network cable directly connected to the Mac, hardware and/or settings on the Mac itself.\nHowever, it does sound likely that your problem was due to link speed negotiation. On a standard gigabit ethernet system, the switch and Mac would normally negotiate a 1000 Mbps speed, which corresponds with your 110 MB/s figure. However, if the cable is not of the right quality, it is broken, or there's a sufficient source of electromagnetic noise nearby, then the two ends could be forced to negotiate a 100 Mbps speed instead. This corresponds with you observing a 10x reduction in speed.\nIf the problem occurs again, you can check by opening System Preferences > Network > Ethernet > Advanced > Hardware and look at the given speed.\n", "Q: Show notifications on lockscreen My iPhone has always been in do not disturb mode.\nBefore the most recent iOS update, to 15(.2.1), it used to be the case that notifications would show on my lockscreen.

I created an  Input Source (Language Keyboard) with Ukelele. It worked fine on my BigSur. Now I moved the file to my new Macbook Pro Monterrey. The same thing happens whether it is on   /Library/Keyboard\\ Layouts/HebrewYiddish.bundle under root or Home.\nWhen I am in Chrome, Atom, Terminal,  System Preferences search box, Pycharm, Zoom, Finder path-field, MacPass, LibreOffice Writer, or Firefox, I can easily switch.\nWhen I am in Whatsapp, Pages, Safari, TextEdit, Reminders, Stickies, or Slack, I cannot. Selecting it in the taskbar just sends me back to another Input Source.  Likewise with the ⌃ -Space keyboard shortcut to switch Input Source (which of course pops up the new Monterrey keyboard-switching  overlay GUI). If I enable the Input Source in one app and switch to a problematic app, the Input Source changes away instantly when I open the app.\n\nIn Settings, it appears correctly regardless, and the keyboard image shows the keys correctly.\n\nHow can I keep the Input Source consistently available in all apps?\n\n\nA: I ran into the same problem without having Karabiner Elements ever on my computer.\nI solved it by installing my Ukelele generated keyboard layout \"for all users\" instead for the \"current user\" using the ukelele organiser. This fix is the suggested in the google-group mentioned above.\n\nA: The solution for me was  to turn Karabiner Elements off; then on!\nThen, both Ukelele and Karabiner work just fine.\nThis also solved a secondary problem with \"ghost\" Input Sources  reappearing repeatedly in the Input Sources list.\n", "Q: Restoring Silicon Mac in enterprise environment Is there some way to do a full IPSW restore in an enterprise environment?\nIn our case this means no DHCP and behind a proxy. Other machines all have a fixed IP and proxy certificate installed. But last time I tried this won't work with a Silicon Mac because it wants to fetch some stuff from Apple before you even get to the point where you can install certificates.\nOr is there maybe some way to auto-deploy them during a restore?\n\nA: This can be easily done from another Mac running the latest version of Apple Configurator 2 (US link).\nConfigurator can actually download the latest IPSW for you, or you can manually drag a local .IPSW file into the Restore window.\nThe always reliable Mr Macintosh has a great write-up on the process.\n\nA: No, in that environment it cannot be done as far as I know. Those checks will have to go through in order for you to be able to actually boot the system afterwards.\nThis type of system is, amongst other things, what makes it possible to register an Apple-silicon Mac as stolen with Apple and then be able to prevent the thief not knowing a user password from reinstalling it to be able to actually get it usable again.\n", "Q: How can I resize panes in iTerm2 using keyboard shortcuts How can I resize panes in iTerm2 using keyboard shortcuts\n\nA: The problem was that I had that hotkeys for different action so it didn't work\nThe hotkeys are for resizing the hight down/up are:\ncontrol ⌃ + command ⌘ + ↓ / ↑\n", "Q: Did the Macintosh OS in 1997 really not have multitasking? In a notice in a local computer magazine from February 1997, they announce that \"BeOS\" is about to be launched for Macs (or already has been). It's claimed that this can \"run several programs at once, so-called 'multi-tasking'\" and that this is something that \"Apple has never been able to do\".\nIs this really true? Could Macs in 1997 really only run one program at once? Or is this a misunderstanding? I vividly remember running multiple programs at once in Windows 3.1 on my IBM PC 486, yet \"multi-tasking\" was boasted as a feature of Windows 95.\n\nA: There are several ways to implement multitasking:\n\n*\n\n*cooperative, where processes voluntarily yield control periodically or when idle or logically blocked. This type of multitasking is called cooperative because all programs must cooperate for the scheduling scheme to work\n\n*preemptive, where the operating system (or its scheduler component) actively switches between processes\n\nMacOS versions before OSX only supported cooperative multi-tasking. So yes, it was possible to run several applications at once, but they needed to \"behave\" and yield control to others. Also, as Gnasher729 and Mark mentioned in the comments, cooperative multitasking between full applications was possible with Switcher and from 1987 onwards with MultiFinder; prior to that, cooperative multitasking was limited to \"desk accessories\", a type of lightweight application that piggybacked on the currently-running application.\n\nA: \nCould Macs in 1997 really only run one program at once?\nI vividly remember running multiple programs at once in Windows 3.1.\n\nWell, yes and no.\nTo truly run several programs at once, you need parallel execution, which requires a multi-core processor or more than one processor. In 1997, the processors supported by Mac OS (and Windows 3.1) were single-core, so they could indeed only run one program at once. So no.\nBut both Mac OS and Windows 3.1 used a trick called multitasking to share the processor time among programs in a way that gave the user the illusion that they were running simultaneously. So yes.\nUnfortunately, it was a primitive kind of multitasking, called cooperative multitasking: programs had to wait until the program currently running would voluntarily release its control of the processor, in the same way you have to wait for someone to leave a packed restaurant to get a table.\nMoreover, with cooperative multitasking, if the program that was running crashed, the OS would usually crash too, as it wouldn't have any means to get control back of the processor.\nBeOS (and Windows 95) changed that: they switched to preemptive multitasking, in which the OS would run a scheduler and share the processor resources among programs, giving them a certain amount of processor time to run. When the time was up, another program would get a time slice to run. That is similar to playing a variant of chess that constrains the amount of time per move: you only have that much time to make your move.\nAll modern server and desktop operating systems use preemptive multitasking. Apple introduced preemptive multitasking in 1997/1998 with Rhapsody (the next-gen OS that would eventually evolve into Mac OS X), and made it available to their main customer base in 2001 with Mac OS X 10.0 (Cheetah).\n", "Q: How can I point gcc and g++ to the gnu compiler collection? I want to use the gnu compiler collection instead of the x-code compiler to compile some bioinformatics tools on the mac, which did compile on Linux but fails to build on macOS.\nI did install homebrew\n$ brew install gcc\n\n$ cd /usr/local/bin\n$ sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/gcc-11 gcc\n\n$ /usr/local/bin/gcc\ngcc: fatal error: no input files\n$ which gcc\n/usr/local/bin/gcc\n\nHowever, calling gcc without the path still points to clang.\n$ gcc\nclang: error: no input files\n\nHow can I point gcc and g++ to the gnu compiler collection?\n\nA: You don't mess around with getting gcc on your PATH. You don't point g++ to the compiler you want.\nYou alter your build system - usually a Makefile, CMake, autoconf or Xcode to build using the C compiler you want. (This also allows different projects to use different compilers)\n\nA: The shell hashes (caches) paths to binaries. So if you run gcc before installing a new version in a different path, it will still use the previous/remembered version. To fix, either clear the stored path (check the hash command in the man page of your shell)  or simply open a new Terminal tab.\n", "Q: Sluggish cursor with usb-mouse connected through dongle MBA M1 I have a new MBA-M1 with the Anker 8 in 1 dongle. I currently have plugged to it the following devices simultaneously: 1) HDMI for my 1080p monitor, 2) USB-A for keyboard, 3) USB-A for backup external disk, and 4) USB-A for USB wireless mouse (I don't know the technical name of it, but is a wireless mouse that is connected with the computer through a USB-A dongle which comes with the mouse).\nNow, 1, 2 and 3 work good simultaneously, but the wireless mouse (4) performs very poorly, as the cursor is very sluggish and has a lot of lag relative to the actual mouse movements. I tried disconnecting the other devices at once and testing how it worked out, turns out that going without the external monitor connection (HDMI) brings back to normal the behavior of the mouse. Nonetheless it's not feasible for me having to choose between mouse or monitor. Then, I'd be very grateful if someone could help me in how can I solve this issue.\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: I've read reports before of poor shielding on DVI, HDMI, and DP cables and adapters interfering with wireless devices before.  There's a few things I've seen reported as fixes, all focused on added shielding.\nOne cheap fix is to wrap the HDMI connector on the cable, and/or the HDMI adapter, in some kind of metal foil or tape.  Aluminum foil would work, the same kind commonly used to wrap food for cooking.  People have used metal tape, the kind used to repair HVAC duct work.  The tape option is the more durable option, and can make a mess if you try to peel it off, so look before you leap on this option.  This is often disliked by many as it is quite ugly but you can try this with some foil at least temporarily to test the theory.\nOne thing to try is a new HDMI cable.  This is not as cheap as wrapping the cable in aluminum foil but should still not hurt too much.  I've seen quality HDMI cables for about $8 from small brick-n-mortar shops and online.  Big box stores should have a cable with adequate shielding for under $25.  If a new cable doesn't fix it then you might need to get a new dongle or wrap the one you have in metal foil or tape, likely in addition to the new cable.\nThere could be something else going on but I'm thinking radio frequency interference from HDMI is the most likely cause.  Good luck on this.\n", "Q: Shortcut for vowels with accents from Spanish using US keyboard layout I write regularly in both Spanish and English, and I have a US keyboard layout. I'm aware that one of the key combinations for generating vowels with accents (á, é, í, ó, ú) is: Opt. + e + the desired vowel. However, this is somewhat cumbersome when trying to type fast in Spanish. Now my question: Is it possible to create a shortcut for generating the vowels with accents by only typing one key before the vowel like in a Spanish layout, but keeping the US layout?\nThanks.\n\nA: It's pretty easy to make the kind of custom layout you want with Ukelele.\n", "Q: Why does \"Terminal\" retain focus / stay in the foreground when I open other apps, and how do I prevent or change that? When I have \"Terminal\" in the foreground and open another application, the new application opens in the background (rather than the foreground).\nThis is rather annoying, as I always need to Cmd+Tab to the application after opening it.\nThis is not limited to the \"open\" command in Terminal - it also is occurring when I click the icon in the dock to open the application, or open the application using Spotlight (Cmd+Space).\nWhy is this happening, and how do I change it so that applications open in the foreground and context switches from Terminal to the newly opened application?\nNote: this is a relatively new Mac, and a colleague who has also received a new Mac is also 'suffering' the same problem.\n\nA: The com.apple.terminal.plist is located in ~/library/preferences and deleting it resolved the issue in my case, where I was able to switch to the finder app but keystrokes were still being applied to terminal.\nHowever, please note removing the plist also removed my custom terminal profiles so please go to Terminal>Preferences>Profile and click export on the gear cog if you wish to save your customizations.  The problem with Terminal retaining functional focus may return if the profile is reimported, but I didn't get a chance to test this.\nIf removing the whole plist is not an option, try\ndefaults write com.apple.Terminal FocusFollowsMouse No\n\nand restart Terminal.\n", "Q: Interaction between `od -xc` and Terminal color change If I list the ID3 tags of an MP3 file with eyeD3, the full file name/path is shown in green, and the file size spaced over to the right edge of the Terminal window.  Before and after, a line of hyphens also goes the full width.  But if I pipe the output through od -xc, the line of hyphens is much shorter, the escape sequences are not shown, three periods replace a large part of the path/name, and there is no space between filename and size.  Example below.\nIs it a bug?

When you run the command normally, you do have a tty. When you run the command and pipe it into od, you no longer have a tty.\n", "Q: TouchID suddenly stopped working Today the TouchID on my MacBook Air suddenly stopped working. Based on this Apple's page, I tried all of the steps, including wiping the sensor, different fingers, restart, adding another one, etc.\nNone of them work. The problem is that the sensor seems no longer detecting the fingerprint. I removed one and tried to add a new fingerprint, but it did not recognize my finger.\nMy MacBook Air is 2020 model with M1 chip, so SMC reset does not work, either.\nIs there anything that I can do to fix the problem?\nThe city I'm currently in has no Apple Store.\n\nUPDATE\nThis happened again, and it seems something is wrong on the software.\n\nA: According to the this forum, one user got an answer from an Apple technical adviser over the phone, with the following solution.\n\nOk on the phone with Apple here is what they told me to do.\n\n*\n\n*Delete all fingerprints and reset the system manager.\nAfter deleting the fingerprints in the system settings, shut down the computer by choosing shut down. Better not use the touch id button.\nCLOSE the lid of your macbook. Wait ten seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n*open the lid and after the computer restarts, don't login but choose shut down again. Not using id touch.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Wait 30 seconds (use a timer) the lid does not need to be closed this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n*After 30 seconds restart your computer by pressing the touch id button and holding it.

I did it. Gave the computer to my friend, my friend created a new account. Opened up terminal and now he sees friend@Coltons-Air.\nShould I be worried about any other info being left there?\n\nA: This is unlikely to be a security issue, nor any issue with data retained on the machine. Terminal shows the DNS name provided by the network if your friend hasn’t overridden the default setup.\nInstead, what is happening is that the router that your friend is using is remembering the old cached hostname of your computer Coltons-Air, and it is assigning it to the computer.\nIf you performed the “Erase All Content and Settings” from the Apple article, then your machine has been factory reset, with no data retained.\nCheck out this other post for more details for a similar person concerned about wrong identity in the terminal app. For reasons, Apple made the shell (bash or zsh typically) to use what the router stored for the last computer seen and not use the name of the Mac connecting. To fix this:\nsudo scutil --set HostName 'not-Coltons-Air'\n\n\nA: You need to change HostName, ComputerName and LocalHostName.\nChanging HostName alone will not solve this issue.\nJust to add onto Scot’s answer, yes Hostname is associated to the router value. But if you really want to clear out any reference to the old names you need to change three different, yet seemingly similar, settings: They are HostName, ComputerName and LocalHostName and you can run the commands as follows; just change yourHostName to whatever you want to set them to.\nsudo scutil --set HostName 'yourHostName'\nsudo scutil --set ComputerName 'yourHostName'\nsudo scutil --set LocalHostName 'yourHostName'\n\nThe breakdown of each setting is this; details courtesy of this post on OSXdaily:\n\n*\n\n*HostName: The name assigned to the computer as visible from the command line, and it’s also used by local and remote networks when connecting through SSH and “Remote Login.”\n\n*ComputerName: The so-called “user-friendly” computer name for a Mac, it’s what will show up on the Mac itself and what will be visible to others when connecting to it over a local network. This is also what’s visible under the “Sharing” preference panel.\n\n*LocalHostName: The name identifier used by Bonjour and visible through file sharing services like AirDrop.\n\nSo yes, the router caching plays a role, but macOS stores three different, yet related, “hostname” values in the system. You must change all three to be assured any remnants of past values are gone.\n", "Q: Is it possible to just migrate changed files? I sent my MacBook Pro to Apple enterprise support for 3 days. They repaired it and sent it back, and the data was not affected.

I used the loaner for a few days during the repair, accumulating some new data, changing files, working.\nNow I need to resume using the repaired computer, and send back the loaner. It sure would be awesome if this use case was supported: Use migration assistant to restore just the files that have changed, from the loaner back to the original machine.\nIt would be easy enough to just do a complete migration of course, but it seems unnecessarily risky, somehow, when 99% of the original data is sitting on the original machine already.\nAdvice?\nThanks in advance,\nJoe\n\nA: Assuming all the changed files are within your home directory you can use the Find functionality within Finder to identify all files changed since a specific date.\n\n*\n\n*Open your home directory in Finder (or your Documents folder if this is where all the changed files are)\n\n\n*Type Cmd-F\n\n\n*Filter by \"Content modified\"\n\nYou still need to copy them manually afterwards though.\n", "Q: What is the difference between login.keychain and system.keychain?

For performance reasons, the control tree is not created unless an accessibility technology is detected (e.g. JAWS on Windows or VoiceOver on macOS).\nSee https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/accessibility\nAt the end of that documentation, they specify a manual override to enable the accessibility tree. I couldn't find a way to do this directly in AppleScript (It doesn't look possible because of this stackoverflow question: Can't set settable accessibility attribute in AppleScript), so I built a tiny cli app to make the call:\nhttps://github.com/JonathanGawrych/set-electron-app-accessible\nIf you clone the repo and run make, then you could turn on MS Team's accessibility by doing:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set pid to unix id of first process whose name is \"Teams\"\n    do shell script \"./set-electron-app-accessible \" & pid\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Access External Volume Before Interactive Login We are running a node service that needs to access an external volume (USB HDD).\nWe've found that when we reboot the system and start the service via a plist in /Libary/LaunchDaemons our external volume is inaccessible to our service until we login interactively via Screen Sharing or VNC.\nHow do we configure our server in such a way that our external volume is accessible immediately upon restarting, and does not require an interactive login?\n\nA: After comments -\nas physical security at the remote location is not an issue - ie, the machine would not be open to hands-on attack for the few minutes after boot, then autologin would allow a defined user to login automatically at boot, thereby enabling the required services.\n\nThis doesn't change the security requirement for remote access, so I would consider it 'safe'.\n", "Q: Setting a reminder without a time I usually have Siri set my reminders for me and sometimes Siri misses the time.

As expected, it has been a tremendous pain for 101 reasons.\nHowever, I have now discovered a ray of light in that spctl has an undocumented --list option (well, it's not in --help or the man page):\nspctl --list\n\nwhich lists all of it's rules. Wow! maybe now you can find out the reason why, (e.g.):\nspctl --assess -vvvv /Applications/XYZ-dev.app\n\nResponds with:\n/Applications/XYZ-dev.app/: rejected\norigin=Mac Developer: XXXX YYYYY (ZZZZZZ)\n\nWith no further diagnostics being apparent.\nThe trouble is that the relevant rules output by sptl --list look like:\n10[Mac App Store] P10 allow install\n        anchor apple generic and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.10] exists\n5[Mac App Store] P10 allow install\n        anchor apple generic and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.10] exists\n4[Mac App Store] P10 allow execute\n        anchor apple generic and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.9] exists\n\nThe first line is easy, but I can't find anywhere, the syntax for the second, e.g.\nanchor apple generic and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.9] exists\n\nWhat kind of sorcery is this? If we could figure this out, we could understand why their gatekeeper is not working.\nAlso, notes for: XYZ-dev.app:\n\n*\n\n*Hardened runtime is disabled but sandbox is on in the entitlements (Surpising, but it's not required for Mac App Store, right? (https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/hardened-runtime-sandboxing.html))\n\n*I copy to /Applications after signing (Otherwise you get XYZ Helper not found errors).\n\n*I don't think it's an entitlements problem as spctl rules don't seem to be looking at them. It's spctl that's failing.\n\n*I'm testing with a locally provisioned dev build using \"Mac Developer\" cert but will be using \"3rd Party Mac Developer Application\" for uploading to the app store.\n\n\nA: This line:\nanchor apple generic and certificate leaf[field.1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.9] exists\n\nbasically means that the certificate should contain the field 1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.9. That field is a custom extension to X.509 certificates that is for Mac App Store Application Software Signing.\nSimilarly 1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.10 is a custom extension to X.509 certificates for Mac Installer Package Submission Signing.\nThe first part \"apple generic\" means that the certificate that has the above mentioned fields, and is used for signing the app, must be either Apple's certificate or a code signing certificate issued by Apple.\nAll in all this means that you cannot just sign your program with any certificate and expect it to pass these GateKeeper rules. I.e. you cannot just create a certificate with one of those fields in it and sign it yourself.\nYou indicate that your ultimate goal is to submit the app to the Mac App Store. In that case, you need to use the \"3rd Party Mac Developer Application\" certificate for signing - and then submit the app to the Mac App Store.\nWhat you're trying to do in practice is to actually run the app on a Mac before it has gone through the Mac App Store.

Our company is setting up an iOS app where the user sends some data to our backend server and it performs some CPU/ GPU intensive tasks. We are considering either buying a series of mac-minis build our own server OR use a service like MacStadium/ Amazon Mac instance.\nUsually it would be a no brainer to go with a dedicated provider, but the cost is major consideration (one instance of mac mini per year is roughly equal to a new mac mini).\nSo back to the question:\nCan you build a reliable and scalable Mac mini backend server, in-house?\nI understand that you can use the macOS server app to do home server, can you scale it for medium size business? Also, I am fairly inexperience in building server, any tips or consideration would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you.\n\nA: Yes, ofcourse it is possible to build a reliable and scalable Mac Mini backend server in-house - otherwise how would companies like MacStadium and Amazon do it.\nHowever, that doesn't mean that anyone can do this. It requires skills, resources and time.\nThe one thing that I note most about your question is that you include no reasoning in your question for why you're looking at a Mac at all. There's no requirement that the backend server for an iOS app needs to be Mac-based.\nIn practice, I would venture the guess that most backends for iOS apps are Linux-based servers. Often in the form of cloud services from companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others.\n", "Q: Autolaunch of Safari Safari is not my default browser.  Something is launching that browser without any window, right in front of me.  Because it's only showing up in the dock, I have no clue it's launched.

I looked into Shortcuts but they don't have Automation like iOS.\nTruly odd behaviour.  I need to fix this.  Any insight appreciated.\n\nA: It's unclear for me whether autolaunch happens randomly during computer usage or log-in. If it's the latter then settings for items which will open automatically when you log in are located  System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login items\nThere are listed items which open automatically and whether they are hidden or not.

For example, you Googled something and opened 1-2 of the results then closed the Google tab and switch to one of the new tabs and suddenly the Google tab will come back.\nLastly, sometimes when you click on a link and navigate to another page in the same site, Safari will take you back.

I followed this tutorial and the button just doesn't appear. Does anybody know how to solve this? Thank you\n\nA: As of macOS 12, up to 12.2, you have to have a secondary display attached and detected already to get access to the Detect displays button.  If you have a secondary display, you can hold the Opt and Night Shift... will change to Detect Displays.  Night Shift will not change with the Opt if there is only the primary display already detected.\nIndeed the ramifications of this are that if you are trying to get it to detect a secondary display but having trouble, you don't get access to the Detect Displays feature.  This seems like madness to me, but I have a workaround.\nFind a third display (yes I apologize), and hook that one up.  If it is detected then you can press Opt to get access to the Detect Displays button, press it, and it will likely detect the original display you were having trouble with.\nI just used this procedure to make a USB-C connected display become detected by hooking up a third HDMI display that was detected and then disconnecting the HDMI display.\nI have subsequently disconnected and reconnected the USB-C monitor and had it detected, so with any luck, this will be a rarely required workaround.\n", "Q: Lawful interception: How-To identify a Private Relay user?

So I have this same problem as in How can I fix underscan/overscan when the slider isn't shown in System Preferences?:\n\nI purchased two new monitors recently and both had pretty bad overscan (underscan? there were black bars around the screen). My mac no longer has the setting it used to have in the Displays section of System Preferences to fix this.\n\nUnfortunately the solution presented there doesn't work any longer because  /var/db/.com.apple.iokit.graphics does not exist in MacOS Monterey. Trying to find it on Mac, as well as googling around... I have found nothing.\nDoes anyone know where pcsn values are now kept? Or if there is any solution to manually changing underscan settings without using MacOS' GUI?\n\nA: smithjw was right - found this thread by searching my problem, the solution was to hit \"p size\" on my monitor's remote to squish things down to fit the sceen.  HDMI image was way too big for the screen, mouse going off all four edges.  Changing monitor settings fixed it.\nI'd rather do it the old way though, underscan, so I could leave the monitor setting to default, no idea what I will plug into it next time.\n\nA: This is likely an issue with the displays themselves. If you have your Mac plugged into the monitor via DisplayPort or HDMI, they will send the full picture/resolution to your monitors.\nIn order to resolve this, you'll need to use the buttons on the external displays to open the menu and change either the Aspect Ratio or scale.\nTo get more specific, if you have the model number, simply search Google for \"MODEL_NUMBER overscan\" or \"MODEL_NUMBER aspect ratio\".\n\nA: I had the same problem. This is probably an error/bug since I was using my monitor #1 via HDMI with no problems, and then when I plugged monitor #2 into my Mac and played with the underscan/overscan slider to fit everything into monitor #2, then when I go back to the display I always use (monitor #1), it was underscanned and there was no slider to fix it!\nAs a mac OS Monterey user, I could not find /var/db/.com.apple.iokit.graphics as well.\nThe problem is weirdly solved by using an HDMI-to-VGA converter and plugging my mac to monitor #1 with VGA, and then switching back to HDMI!\nIt probably is a bug...\n\nA: I have the save exact problem as allisknowing.  Was using 1 external monitor with my 2020 Mac Mini M1 on Monterey, and the image filled out my monitor normally.  I setup a 2nd projector monitor and found the underscan slider to make it fit the screen, but now my original monitor is not taking up the whole screen and theres no underscan to make it larger.  I hoped that ugrading to Ventura would fix it, but still the same problem.\n\nA: So I was able to solve this in the end by simply getting a new dedicated USB-C to HDMI cable. Then the overscan option shows up. Before that I was using a cheap USB-C to multiple output adaptor.\n", "Q: Uninstalling Lando application in usr/local/bin What is the best way of uninstalling an application in usr/local/bin/.

After listening for a while, if I put one earbud back in the case, the audio pauses and they are disconnected.\nCurrent Behavior\nWhen I pull an earbud out of the case, it does not connect to my phone right away. What seems to work right now is that I have to pull out both earbuds, press/hold the button to activate ANC and then go into my Bluetooth settings and connection to Beats Studio Buds, which displays as \"Not Connected\". After waiting a little while, it eventually connects and audio is playable. Once I put my earbuds back in the case, I have to repeat this process to listen again.\nIf my earbuds are in the case, and my phone is on, when I open the case near my phone, a popup opens showing the buds/case with their battery percentages, similar to what you might see when a new pair of earbuds are brought near a phone.\nWhat I have tried\nI removed the Beats from the Bluetooth menu with the \"Forget\" option. I then did a reset as described on Apple's Support Page. I then tried to pair it up again as a new device. My phone asked if I wanted to connect and all I got was a red exclamation point, indicating some unknown error.\n\nA: I do not own a pair of Beats Studio Buds, but IF the Bluetooth settings are similar (which they seem to be) to those of the AirPods, you may want to have a look at Bluetooth settings.\nWhen your Beats are connected, go to the Bluetooth Preference Pane and click on the i next to the device name.

And did Safari save my password?\nI think that use case doesn't work. Am I missing something?\n\nA: If you register with a \"hide my email\" address that will be your email address on the service. The service is not aware of your \"actual\" iCloud address (that's the whole idea behind it, really), which means you will use your generated email address to log in, etc.\nThe keychain works in the same way as usual. The combination of email and password is saved for the URL. This can be your actual iCloud, a generated address or any 3rd party address you're using - whichever you entered.\nIf a login was not saved or you forgot your generated address you can look it up in System Preferences > Apple ID, then click on \"options\" next to \"Hide my email\" where you will find a list of all generated addresses with a description of the service or URL they were generated for.\n\nA: Hide my email is not single sign on. It just sets up a mail alias so the company doesn’t know your iCloud log in.\nDid the service offer Sign in with Apple? If so, you get the secure sign in SSO plus optional secure alias if you chose that.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210318\nIf it was not Sign in with Apple, you’d need to understand how the service you signed up with handles passwords to get it saved or reset.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425\nI’ve used both and so far am very happy.

With Apple in the process of discouraging the use of kernel extensions, I am unsure what options they are now offering for people wanting to create access to a specific file system.\nIn the past there was MacFuse and MacFusion, but with the current road map this would likely rule this out as a solution, hence curious how we should approach something like sshfs on Monterey instead of Big Sur?\n\nA: MacFuse and the likes have not been \"ruled out\" - they continue to work just fine on the latest macOS versions.\nApple has released a list of KPIs (kernel programming interfaces) that are deprecated now. This concerns mainly network and USB related interfaces. It does not concern the VFS KPIs that file systems use.\nIn future releases, it is likely given the direction that macOS has been taking, that VFS KPIs will also be deprecated on at least Apple Silicon machines. At that time, Apple will likely publicise alternatives - or remove the functionality. But that hasn't happened yet, and no-one can know how that will work out.\nThe only newer API in this area is the NSFileProviderReplicatedExtension, but it is mostly aimed at cloud file systems such as DropBox, Google Drive and the likes.\nShould Apple decide to completely remove support for third party file systems inside the kernel without providing a user-space alternative (which it is not evident that they will) - then you can always implement your file system in user-space and interface it as a network file system.\n", "Q: How can I get Apple Maps and Google Maps to *always* show speed limits?

I have also tried adding source ./bash_profile to either bashrc or bash_profile but that gives me a open too many files error.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: This is one of the areas where Linux and macOS differ so a lot of articles you find only partially apply to macOS. Mainly, on macOS, each Terminal tab runs a login shell.\n\n*\n\n*For login shells, bash reads ~/.bash_profile or (if this is missing) ~/.profile.\n\n*For interactive shells, bash reads ~/.bashrc.\n\nSo on macOS it doesn't actually matter which of ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile you choose. It helps to be consistent though and stick to one or the other.\nTo make environment variables available in all future session, just add them to the file of your choosing:\nMYVAR='Hello, world'; export MYVAR\n\nPS: Personally I have test -f ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc in .profile and all definitions in ~/.bashrc. This covers both worlds (at the cost of always loading some stuff which only is applicable to Linux or macOS) and IMHO is good enough for personal use.\n\nA: From Apple developer documentation archives Login Scripts:\nOS X provides support for login scripts and environment property lists to allow you to set environment variables and aliases that are automatically set whenever you run a new shell. There are two ways to do this:\nBourne shell (bash, zsh, and so on):\nTo persistently set environment variables and add aliases, you can add the appropriate alias, variable assignment, and export commands to the following files:\n\n*\n\n*~/.profile—executed automatically for all login shells.\n\n*~/.bash_profile—similar to .profile, but only runs for bash login shells.\n\n*~/.bashrc and ~/.zshrc—executed automatically for all non-login bash or zsh shells (when you explicitly type bash or zsh on the command line or run a script that starts with #!/bin/bash or #!/bin/zsh).\n\nYou may also find it useful to create a .bashrc file that sources your .profile file. For example:\n. $HOME/.profile\n\n", "Q: How to get back optimised photos and videos after signing out and signing back in iCloud Account I've signed out from my iCloud account recently from my iPad, and then I signed back in. I have enabled the Optimize Storage option for iCloud, hence low resolution copies of some of my photos are stored in my iPad before. However, after the signout and the signin, the photos that were optimised are no longer in my iPad, but still in iCloud Drive.\nHow do I download these photos and videos in iCloud to my iPad, preserving the metadata(location, timestamp, etc.)\nI have a Windows PC with iTunes installed in it(but I doubt I have a backup of the iPad).\nThe iPad is an iPad 4, iOS 10.\nThank you!\n\nA: They will re-download automatically when you re-enable iCloud Photos. It may take a little while for it to re-sync the library.\n", "Q: 16GB M1 Mac running slow after couple days of usage After a fresh restart, everything is smooth. During the next couple of days of regular usage of the system, a problem of responsiveness gradually increases, until you can count a full second between you swiping a desktop and the system actually responding to the gesture.\nI've tried reducing memory pressure by closing high memory apps, but it doesn't help at all.\nVideo demonstration here.\n\nA: This turned out to be an issue with the Dock process. It's fixed by restarting it with:\nkillall -KILL Dock\n\nNow I wish I knew what corrupts it in the first place.\n\nA: macOS Monterey is known to have massive memory leaks. The root cause is not yet quite clear. One memory leak I know of is that, when searching from Finder, the memory allocated for the search is not released any more.\nCheck the activity monitor for high memory usage of any process and kill that process.\nOther memory leaks I've come across are:\n\n*\n\n*Mail app hogs memory. Here it's enough to quit and restart Mail.\n\n*Spotlight search in Mail causes issues with symptoms being that no more matching results are found. Then kill process corespotlightd  (will restart automatically).\n\n*Using Sidecar causes process WindowServer to hog a lot of memory. Seems a reboot is required to fix this.\n\n", "Q: Application on data connected Iphone, requests LAN access I'm on the latest iPhone (13 Pro Max) (iOS 15.2.1) and connected to my carrier's LTE network. I opened an application, which then requested access to my local network.\nI'm wondering how this is possible and what this means. How can an application request LAN access when I'm not on my LAN? Does anyone know what might have happened?\nFor context, I'm connected to Bell's network.\n\nA: The prompt was introduced in iOS 14 to inform and empower users when apps are possibly interacting with networks in a way that could potentially let the app harvest information about other devices on that network.\nI.e. an app that connects to your A/C unit on your WiFi network is an app you as a user would expect and allow having that access. However a single player, offline game would not be expected to do that - it could potentially be harvesting information in order to fingerprint (identify) the user for the purpose of maximising ad revenue or even trying to exploit security holes in local devices such as routers and printers. With iOS 14 and newer the user is given the option of allowing or not allowing that type of network access.\nThere's really no contradiction in the app requesting this permission even when you're not connected to such a local network at the moment. The app would have no way of knowing before hand that this is the case.\nGiving it permission to access the local network doesn't mean that it can actually do that right now - but it has permission to try. Note also that unless you revoke the permission, it could try again later when you actually are connected to such a local network.\nAlso you should note that \"Local network\" might mean something entirely different than what you think. It doesn't as such mean LAN as in \"my home network connecting my WiFi router, printer, AppleTV, etc. with cables\". Instead the definition is a bit technical:\nWhen you connect a computer to any type of network, this is usually expressed within the operating system as something called a \"network interface\". Network interfaces cover many different types of networking technologies ranging from various types of physical signals, hardware options, networking protocols, etc.\nIn this context, a \"Local network\" is specially a network interface using the IP protocol (i.e. IP addresses are used) that is  broadcast-capable. The latter means that it is possible to send/receive data on the network without a specific recipient (i.e. possible for more than one recipient).\nThis means that for example standard WiFi connections and Ethernet connections are considered a \"Local network\". However for example a VPN connection might not be considered a \"Local network\" (these are typically point-to-point connections).\nNote also that even though a WiFi connection can be considered a \"Local network\" - it is not every interaction with the WiFi connection that is covered by that prompt. If an app only requires Internet access it can do so through your local network without requiring this permission. However, if the app specifically contacts a another device on your local network, or it tries to send multicast packets (data sent to a group of devices) or broadcast packets (data sent to all devices on the network) - then that will require this \"Local network\" permission. Similarly if the apps tries to receive multicast or broadcast data, that also requires the \"Local network\" permission. An app can receive data on the local network specifically addresses to itself without the permission.\nThe end result is that an app that tries to scan your network for devices using broadcast or simply brute-force will require this permission - whereas an app that only connects to Internet-based services or offers a service on the local network for others to use, will not require this permission.\nNote that apps that themselves use the relatively popular Bonjour protocol to discover services will require the \"Local network\" permission - whereas if the app asks iOS that it wants to print something using AirPlay will not require the permission, even though that means that iOS uses Bonjour to locate those printers. The difference is that the app does not receive the Bonjour data directly, and as such it does not pose the same risk of data harvesting.\nIf you want the full technical details behind this feature, you can refer to Apple's WWDC video introducing the feature to developers and to the \"Local Network Privacy FAQ\" for app developers.\n", "Q: Synchronize preferences between macs? I use four different Macs on a daily basis. I would love to be able to synchronize preferences between them. This is an obvious feature that is missing from iCloud. I'm thinking of writing software to explicitly synchronize $HOME/Library/Preferences. However, apps won't be expecting that, so there is going to be some need to exclude some apps. Other apps would probably benefit from having elements within the plist merged. Has anybody done this?\n\nA: This doesn’t work well in practice due to the flexibility and creativity in how applications save preferences. Some applications even generate machine specific settings tied to each device as a feature which will defeat any sync you set up or revert to defaults when you restore from a full backup.\nThis was one reason why I switched to embracing the defaults and made far fewer tweaks when I would regularly use dozens of machines sequentially for work.\nShort of making your home folder network shareable across all computers, there isn’t a good method for this general problem.\n\nA: Many macOS system preferences will happily synch via iCloud. It works on my two machines (Big Sur and Catalina).\nGo to System Preferences > AppleID > iCloud Drive > Options, then scroll down to the end of the list, and check the box next to \"System Preferences.\"\n", "Q: How to delete hidden iCloud Drive folders? I use iCloud Drive a lot on my Mac. Recently I discovered that when I logged in with a different computer account and navigated to /Users/<my main account>/Library/Mobile Documents, there were a lot of folders there. Mostly from deleted apps. These don't show up when I'm logged in to my main account, even after pressing Cmd + Shift + .. These also show up in Terminal when I use the ls command.\nDragging them to the trash & rm -rf don't delete them. They keep coming back. Any idea on how I could get rid of these folders permanently ?\n\nA: You need to remove them by turning of the cloud sync for the specific folder (app) on your mobile device or in your Mac system settings.\nOtherwise, it will get deleted, but the system creates the folder again for syncing.\n", "Q: Under what circumstances could Photos delete a large number of albums without warning or indication? This morning, I had ~4500 photos, all in Photos albums. All had been uploaded to iCloud in the last couple of days, and were represented correctly across multiple devices. There was no further iCloud activity taking place.\nAt some point between then and this evening Photos has, without any warning that it would or had, deleted a very large number of those albums. There are now ~2500 photos not in any album. All the photos seem still seem to be in the library, but albums are gone (on iCloud, and across multiple devices).\nHow is this possible?\nAlbums are affected randomly, there appears to be no pattern to it.\nI haven't been editing photos or albums since this morning.\nI suspect that it's some kind of database conflict in iCloud, that it resolved by deleting these items.\nI did turn on an old iPad (iOS 9.3.5) this afternoon, that's connected to my iCloud account, and opened Photos. Conceivably that's somehow related, but it was already connected to the account.\nI have a TimeMachine backup, but it's hard to guess how an old Photos library database is going to interact with iCloud.\n\nI completely wiped the iPad I mentioned since writing the above - a complete reset - and allowed it to reconnect to the account.\nI watched the photos and albums appearing as it downloaded the library. After a while, some of the missing albums appeared on the iPad, in their expected places.\nThe same albums were not showing up on icloud.com, the source that it was downloading them from.\nAnd then a few minutes later on the iPad, again before my eyes, I watched them disappear again, popping out of existence.\nI still see some of the \"missing\" albums showing up on the iPad, downloaded in the last minutes, though they're not visible via icloud.com - oh, but they are now: literally while typing this sentence, they deigned to appear.\nWill they remain? Will they disappear again? Who knows?\nI will leave this car-crash of software overnight and see what's left in the wreckage in the morning.\n\nA: There's no intended circumstance where Photos on its own initiative deletes a large number of albums without warning or indication.\nWhat you're seeing is most likely a bug or at least a configuration issue. It could be a bug in the iCloud server software, or it could be a bug in Photos - most likely in the old iOS 9 unit then.\nThere's a chance that something got \"corrupted\" on a local device and that synchronized to the other devices and messed up your albums. For example if the clock has been off on one device (the iOS 9 one), it might be that an iPhoto library without albums would have been seen as \"newer\" than other ones where you had already created the albums - and that \"newer\" state then got synchronized on top of the others.\n", "Q: How do I stop notifications about my wife's Airpods being \"detected near me\"? When Apple released the AirTag, they made a big deal about safety features to help prevent stalking. If there's an unknown AirTag or other location-enabled device traveling with you, your iPhone will notify you.\nUnfortunately, this means that when my wife and I travel anywhere, I get a notification saying \"Airpods Pro detected near you\". There's an option to \"pause safety alerts\", but this only stops the notifications for one day.\nHow can I make my iPhone stop notifying me about this?\n\nA: You can pause them indefinitely if you and your wife are in an iCloud Family group.\nThe option will appear alongside the option you already mentioned.\n\nA: Jaume's suggestion in the comments worked for me. I paired the Airpods with my own phone, and the notifications stopped.\n", "Q: iPhone photos taken on camera fail to show up in Photos for ten seconds I take photos or screenshots frequently and then want to immediately send them to friends or share on social media.\nRecently I have noticed it takes up to ten seconds for photos or screenshots to appear in my \"Recents\" album. When they first appear in the album they show up at low resolution and I can't select them, and then a few seconds later they show up at high resolution.\nI have 150GB free space on a phone with 256GB total storage.\nCuriously I noticed if I took a bunch of photos in a row - say, ten in five seconds - those photos showed up immediately.\nI do not have iCloud photo sync enabled. I can also reproduce this effect if I have airplane mode turned on, ie. no Internet connection.\nHas anyone ever seen this before? Do you know the possible cause?\n\nA: If you open Screenshot.app the control bar that comes up at the bottom of the screen has a dropdown menu \"options\". There, you need to uncheck \"Show Floating Thumbnail\", which is the phenomenon you are (partially) observing.\n\"Partially\" because you missed those screenshots showing up in the bottom right screen corner for those 10 seconds, which allows for just grabbing it and disposing of it in whatever way one wishes.\nSorry, no screenshots in this answer. As it turns out, Screenshot.app is screen-bulletproof.\n", "Q: Xcode constantly asks for command-line tools Homebrew requires the XCode command-line tools to work.  It never complains they are missing.  But every time I do anything else that launches XCode, XCode itself asks me to install the command-line tools.   I complained to Apple that once installed, they should be updated automatically when the rest of XCode is updated.  Apple responded saying they do get included in the updates.\nWhen I said, \"Then why do I have to install them every time XCode launches?\" there was no response.\nThe fact that homebrew builds and updates and installs always work suggests that they ARE installed.  And this is confirmed by\nWGroleau@MBP ~ % xcode-select --install\nxcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use \"Software Update\" to install updates\n\nSo why does XCode think they aren't, and how do I fix that?\nLatest available non-beta versions of everything.  Issue has been present for many versions (two years or more).\nThere is a related question, but nothing there really helps.\n\nA: You haven't given enough information that we can give a definite fix, but I can help you along the way:\nFirst, it is important to understand that there are multiple sets of \"command-line tools\" in play. The one installed globally to be used in the Terminal, for example HomeBrew is not the same as the one Xcode uses (by default).\nAs such, there's no contradiction in you being able to use command-line tools with HomeBrew to compile programs, while Xcode complains that its command line tools needs upgrading or are missing.\nAlso note that it is possible to have multiple versions of these command-line tools on your computer at the same time. Professional programmers often find themselves in situations where they need to have multiple versions of Xcode installed at the same time, and by extension of that, multiple versions of the associated command-line tools. This can be handled very easily using the Xcodes app (note the 's' at the end of the name).\nI would advise opening Xcode up, open Preferences in the menu, navigate to the Locations tab and then under Command Line Tools make sure that you have selected the tools that are inside the Xcode app bundle.\n", "Q: oh-my-zsh startup failure: __git_prompt_git status blocks \nI have been installed iTerm2 and brew.

They appeared suddenly. I don't know what's going on with it! Do I have to replace the entire display because of it? And lastly, is my display going to die soon?\nAny idea what's that, and how to fix it?\n\n\n\nA: Your 2017 MacBook Air has \"stage lights\". After shutting your MacBook off, it can be easily fixed by using a P5 screwdriver to remove the bottom case, unplugging the battery, and carefully removing the display cable for dusting / cleaning with canned air. Make sure you dust the port and the cable before carefully plugging back in.\nFollow steps 1 - 3, then skip to 19 since we are only reseating the display cable and not unplugging the camera and removing the entire display.

I am stuck thinking if upgrading to a newer version of macOS will solve this issue.\n\nAccording to the official documentation, VMware Horizon Client for Mac supports macOS Catalina or later, so you seem to be running an unsupported configuration.\nApart from that, macOS Mojave is no longer supported (following the rule of thumb that Apple supports the previous two iterations of the current version), so I'd definitely recommend that you upgrade to Catalina or Monterey, if possible.\n", "Q: Find ports used by a specific process on macOS There are dozens of answers here and elsewhere on how to find what process is using a specific port, but so far I haven't found a better way to find what ports are being used by a process other than\nlsof -i -P | grep <PID>\n\nwhich is extremely slow (> 5s on my 2021 MacBook Pro).\nIt seems as though\nlsof -p <PID> -i -P\n\nshould filter by process, but it doesn't; the -i -P options seem to override the -p filter.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: The way lsof options work is somewhat counterintuitive. Per the man page (Linux version, but as of macOS 12.2 Monterey and lsof 4.91, the Mac version seems to be identical):\n\nNormally list options that are specifically stated are ORed —\ni.e., specifying the -i option without an address and the -ufoo\noption produces a listing of all network files OR files belonging\nto processes owned by user “foo”.\n[...]\nThe -a option may be used to AND the selections.  For example,\nspecifying -a, -U, and -ufoo produces a listing of only UNIX\nsocket files that belong to processes owned by user “foo”.\n\nIn order to apply both the -i filter and the -p filter, it's therefore necessary to also specify -a:\n$ lsof -i -P -a -p 46774                                                                                   COMMAND   PID  USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nruby    46774 david   10u  IPv4 0x4e2119e3c90b016b      0t0  TCP *:63597 (LISTEN)\nruby    46774 david   11u  IPv4 0x4e2119e3c90bcbfb      0t0  TCP localhost:63597->localhost:63599 (ESTABLISHED)\nruby    46774 david   14u  IPv4 0x4e2119e3c90c4bfb      0t0  TCP *:3000 (LISTEN)\n\nNote that where the -a is placed is not important. Per the man page:\n\nCaution: the -a option causes all list selection options to be\nANDed; it can't be used to cause ANDing of selected pairs of\nselection options by placing it between them, even though its\nplacement there is acceptable.  Wherever -a is placed, it causes\nthe ANDing of all selection options.\n\nSo the following are all equivalent.\nlsof -i -P -a -p 46774 \nlsof -a -p 46774 -i -P\nlsof -a -i -p 46774 -P\nlsof -P -p 46774 -i -a\n\n", "Q: Can I use a Bluetooth USB driver/adapter with a Mac that has built-in Bluetooth to make switching devices easier? I have a work and personal MacBook Pro and frequently switch between one and the other. All of my devices are connected through a USB-C docking station, so for the most part this is as easy as unplugging a cable from one computer and plugging it into another. However, when it comes to using any Bluetooth peripheral devices like keyboards, mice, trackpads, or headphones, it can be frustrating to switch them over to controlling the other device (especially since some devices aren't capable of storing multiple profiles, while others try to connect to multiple sources simultaneously as a \"feature\").\nI'm wondering, if I just bought a simple USB Bluetooth adapter and plugged it into my USB-C hub, would I be able to pair my computer peripherals to the adapter rather than directly to my Mac?\n\nA: A Bluetooth adapter that allows pairing to the device instead of the computer would be far more complex than the typical adapter one can pick up for less than $20 at any big box store.  It would also require drivers that would be different than a typical Bluetooth adapter.\nWhat you could do is use wireless devices that are not Bluetooth.  I recall these being quite popular before Bluetooth caught on, and perhaps are still quite popular.  The ones I've seen use a USB wireless adapter that is permanently paired to the device it comes with.  This means buying new devices, and each device having it's own wireless adapter that will occupy a USB port.\nSome of these non-Bluetooth devices are prone to interference, they use very simple protocols on the same frequencies used by so many other wireless in common use.  Bluetooth is \"smart\" enough to avoid most interference, which is why it is so popular.  I suspect that if you were to get a bunch of these simple wireless adapters plugged into the same computer that they may interfere with each other.\nI recall seeing at least one vendor that use their own non-Bluetooth protocol that might offer what you are looking for.  I believe they can pair multiple devices to a single wireless receiver, which avoids the issue of needing many open USB ports to plug in an adapter for every device I mentioned above.  Pick any popular vendor of wireless computer peripherals and they likely offer something like I just described.\nI've seen people use small programmable project computers to act as adapters for a variety of devices, perhaps someone offers software for these computers to do just what you want.  I've seen some of these computers have the hardware to act as a USB device to another computer, as well as built-in Bluetooth or a USB port for plugging in a Bluetooth adapter.  The Raspberry Pi series is one example of the kind of computer I'm talking about, there are others.\nIf you require that the devices be Bluetooth then the only solution I see is looking for a programmable project computer to act as the adapter.  Maybe someone solved this problem and offer the code for download.  Maybe you can be that someone that writes the code offers it for others to download.\n", "Q: How can I add my vaccination record to Apple Health on iOS?

You can either set the key to <false/>, or just remove it entirely (it defaults to false).\nIf you do want the job restarted under certain conditions, you can specify an array of conditions where it should be restarted. For example, to restart the job if it exits with an error status, you could use this:\n<key>KeepAlive</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>SuccessfulExit</key>\n    <false/>\n</dict>\n\n(In this case, <key>SuccessfulExit</key><false/> essentially means \"if it didn't exit successfully\".)\nBTW, I know that script is just a stub to test how the job is being run, but I noticed a bug. Since [$(date +\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")] is not double-quoted, the shell will try to \"expand\" it into a list of matching filenames. That is, [2022-02-01 09:13:55] would look for files named \"2\", \"0\", etc and if it finds any it'll replace that bracket expression with the matching names. So if you get output like this:\n2 run\n2 run\n2 run\n...etc\n\nThat means there's a file named \"2\" in whatever happens to be the agent's working directory (probably your home directory). You should either double-quote it, or just include the whole thing in the date format string (again, properly quoted):\ndate +\"[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S] run\"\n\n", "Q: Hot Corners in Monterey are too \"hot\" - very easily triggered For almost as long as I've been a Mac user, I have used a Hot Corner to trigger my display to go to sleep, which in effect locks my machine, because a password is needed to get back into the OS.\nThe problem is that since updating to Monterey, the approx. 1 second delay is gone, so if my cursor so much as touches the corner I need to re-enter my password.

So I documented most of the the .keylayout file here, mostly based on the what looks like scraped together spec, in order to figure out how to programmatically generate the .keylayout file like Ukelele does. The only thing I am unclear about is what I do with JIS and ANSI (and possibly ISO), all of which is said is:\n\nSince the ISO keyboard used in Europe can be handled with the same layout as the ANSI keyboard used in the US, that leaves ANSI and JIS (used in Japan) as the two classes that need to be handled.\n\nAll that it is referenced in is mapSet up top, and then:\n<keyMapSet id=\"JIS\">\n  <keyMap index=\"0\" baseMapSet=\"ANSI\" baseIndex=\"0\">\n    <key code=\"512\" output=\"\"/>\n  </keyMap>\n...\n\nIs this a special value treated specially? Or how does it get used / what do I need to know about it?\nIf my font is for a fantasy language, do I need to think about / consider the JIS keyboard format?\nhttps://deskthority.net/wiki/ANSI_vs_JIS\n\nA: Keyboard layouts normally work essentially the same on either ANSI, ISO, or JIS keyboards.  You can see this by doing View > Keyboard Type in Ukelele and switching among them while it is set to the US or any other layout.  ISO keyboards have an extra key, so it's possible to wind up with characters allocated to that key not being available from other keyboard types.  Best practice is to make sure the ANSI and JIS versions also have those characters somewhere.\nThe only connection between fonts and layouts is the fact that you need to have the layout keys return the unicode values of the characters in your font that you want your keyboard to be able to produce. If you are making custom glyphs, it's best to locate them in the Unicode Private Use Area instead of putting them at codepoints already assigned to existing scripts.\n", "Q: Is Hide My Email really a replacement for a normal account? I was thinking about Hide My Email as a replacement for a normal e-mail account.

Their mails have never arrived to me after moving my domain to iCloud Mail. To investigate that, I've registered on some mail \"proxy\" service (receives mails and passes them further where you want) and I found that Apple in fact rejects their messages (as they weren't complying to Apple's deliverability requirements), as my proxy provider had in logs that they received that mail, but Apple rejected their attempt to deliver this mail to iCloud. And the same story was with the most finances-related services (crypto, etc.).\nThe only info they give you is this url, but they don't mention which particular rule sender's mail server has broken.\nAfter all of that, I have moved my whole domain to a different provider, as Apple doesn't really give you ability to fix those issues, and they don't even notify You about such issues.\n", "Q: Is store.db an SQL database?

The template types include Compositions (templates created in Motion for use in Motion), Effects, Generators, Titles, and Transitions.\nWhen you save a template in Motion, you assign a category and have the option to assign a theme.\nIn the macOS Finder, templates are stored according to the following folder hierarchy: template type/category/theme. For example, if you save a Final Cut Effect template to the Blur category with an optional News theme, it is stored in the Finder in the /Users/username/Movies/Motion Templates/Effects/Blur/News/yourtemplatename/ folder.\nNote: You can also sort by theme in the Motion Project Browser using the Theme pop-up menu.\nContents of the template folder\nEach template folder contains the following items:\nlarge.png: This file is used for the preview in the Motion Project Browser and as a preview in the Final Cut Pro browser when the project loads in the background.\nsmall.png: This file is used for the thumbnail preview of the template in the Final Cut Pro browser.

Is there a way to disable fast charging on 2021 Macbook Pros?\n\nThese are my reasons for doing so:\n\n*\n\n*lower speed charging produces less heat and is therefore less stressful for batteries\n\n*I would always prefer to charge with a MagSafe cable as it reduces risk of the Macbook accidentally falling to the floor--therefore using USB-C to USB-C cable is not the best way to avoid fast charging\n\n*when I'm going out to use Macbook away from my desk, the fewer items I need to carry the better--therefore carrying two chargers (140W for fast charging, 30W for lower voltage) is not optimal. In cases when wall outlets are not abundant enough where I spend my day, I would rather have an option for fast charging.\n\n\nA: There's no way to disable fast charging in software.\nThere's no need for it either. Apple's hardware automatically manages charging speeds to ensure that for example the temperature is kept within acceptable range.\nThat being said, Fast Charging is only supported currently with higher wattage Apple Chargers. If you really wish to avoid fast charging, you could simply use a charger that does not support fast charging. Your overall charge times might be slower however.\nCurrently, the 2021 16\" MacBook Pro requires the 140W charger for fast charging, and the 2021 14\" MacBook Pro requires the 96W or higher charger.\n\nA: You cannot do this in software. However, using 30W usb-c MacBook charger, you will be able to accomplish this (MAGSAFE WILL WORK).\nUnplug your included USB-C to MagSafe cable from the end of the 96W/67W included power brick and plug the usb-c end of the cable into an apple slow charger (30W, $50). Now you should be able to slow charge using MagSafe.\nIf you don't want to spend your wallet on a charger, check out Anker's lineup instead. You can get a 33W nano for $33 & a 45W nano (somewhat faster) for $40. Anker nano site\nFor the convenience factor, you can just bring the fast charger with you and keep your slow charger at your desk.\n\nA: There's no official way of doing this, but there's a third party app, called AlDente that allows you to control much about the way your macbook charges.\nIt allows you to set a maximum battery temperature, so that when that threshold is reached, the charging process slows down or stops altogether, plus other useful features.\nPlease notice that, being a third-party, low-level app, it might have some issues. Although I have personally encountered only minor bugs, some  rare users might have had more serious problems.\n", "Q: How to disable all notification sounds and banner alerts but allow notifications on lockscreen?

I have had a baffling and very frustrating experience with Photos in the last few days.\nA couple of days ago I asked Under what circumstances could Photos delete a large number of albums without warning or indication?\nIn short:\nI added a large number of photos to Photos, and allowed it to upload them to iCloud.\nAt first, all was as expected, in Photos, on iCloud.com/photos, and on other devices attached to the same account.\nThen multiple albums (not the photos in them, just the albums) disappeared, across all devices and iCloud.com/photos. In some cases I watched this happening before my eyes.\nSince then, on one device (an ancient iPad running iOS 9.3.5) most of the missing albums have reappeared. On others and on iCloud.com/photos, a few missing albums have reappeared (but nothing has changed for about 24 hours).\nWhat is the source of truth? If it's iCloud, why doesn't iCloud.com/photos show the missing albums, and why did the iPad find some of the missing ones before iCloud did?\nWhat processes are occurring, and where? I don't see any sign of relevant activity in Activity Monitor, or in Photos, or on iCloud.com.\nIs there some way of hastening the process of synchronisation, if that's taking place, or even finding out what is happening behind the scenes? What are the processes, that that mean albums can mysteriously disappear and reappear?\nThe one saving grace is that so far, all the actual photos seem to be safe, but I have lost a great deal of faith in Photos and iCloud over this.\n\nA: The source of truth is the iCloud in terms of past activity.\nThe situation you have described sounds like a configuration issue or a bug. It also sounds like it is a temporary situation that might resolve itself.\nIt is almost impossible for ordinary users to get any real insight into the processes that takes place when syncing across multiple devices and iCloud. This is similar to all the other major cloud-sync services such as DropBox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive.\nThere's a real probably that this problem has occurred due to some issue in the iCloud server system. That won't register as activity in Activity Monitor. However, it is not a problem I have seen before, nor heard from others. So I gather it's at least not common.\nThere's also a chance that something got \"corrupted\" on a local device and that synchronized to the other devices and messed up your albums. For example if the clock has been off on one device, it might be that an iPhoto library without albums would have been seen as \"newer\" than other ones where you had already created the albums - and that \"newer\" state then got synchronized on top of the others.\n", "Q: \"client_global_hostkeys_private_confirm: server gave bad signature for RSA key 0\" - SSH error - MacOS 12 I'm getting the error client_global_hostkeys_private_confirm: server gave bad signature for RSA key 0 during a ssh connection on the command line when the target host is known (already saved to the known_hosts file).\nThis is the case since updating to MacOS 12 (Monterey).

This wasn't the case on my Intel MBP where -1 was reasonably fast.\nHow can I disable trackpad acceleration on an 16\" M1 Pro MBP running macOS 12.2 such that it roughly matches the experience on an Intel MBP?\n\nA: It is now possible to accomplish this with https://linearmouse.org/ 0.7\nThey have added per device settings, and this means you can change configuration for trackpad acceleration as well.\n\nA: A solution I have found is CursorSense where you can simply disable acceleration with a checkbox to get what feels just like the trackpad on an Intel mac to me. (Acceleration of 0 with Sensitivity of 1904 is equivalent to this setting.)\nThe app is proprietary and paid (10$) unfortunately.\n\nA: If you’re not sure which utility you want for this, go for a Setapp trial.\n\n*\n\n*https://setapp.com/how-to/how-to-use-bettertouchtool\nIt has BTT which is my value and functionality gold standard for this sort of task.

There's a single rotary volume knob on the infotainment system, along with buttons (\"Phone,\" \"Radio,\" \"Media, \"App\") to select input sources. This is not an AirPlay system; it connects via Bluetooth or USB.\nI like the phone to connect automatically when I enter the car with the phone in my pocket, so I leave the infotainment system turned on. The infotainment system turns on and off with the ignition key. This works as expected.\nThe undesired result, however, is that the iOS app Music autoplays when the Bluetooth connection is made. Usually I prefer silence in the car. I can turn the playing off, either on the infotainment system \"Media\" screen or on the iPhone itself, but the \"off\" status does not persist; the next time I get in the car, the dance repeats. If I rotate the volume knob to turn down the audio, then I can't hear the other person if I receive a phone call.\nThere's no setting available on the car's system to change this behavior, nor do I find one on the iPhone. I could remove all the songs in the Music app, but then I'd be unable to listen to songs in the car if I did desire to do so.\nIs there a way to accomplish these conflicting goals?\n\nA: I was wrong, there is a car-side setting.\nTo prevent iPhone Music auto-play on a 2019 stock VW Jetta S infotainment system, navigate on the infotainment screen as follows:\nMedia > Setup (within the screen, not on the bezel) > Bluetooth, and uncheck the \"Bluetooth Audio\" box.\nA similar challenge exists with the \"Radio\" function, as the radio itself cannot be turned off except by turning off the whole infotainment panel. A workaround: select \"Media\" on the infotainment system, with Bluetooth Audio deselected as described above. Then nothing is heard in the background, and incoming calls connect at the user-desired volume.\n", "Q: How do you get rid of the notification to login to iCloud in System Preferences? If you want to login to MacOS to be able to get apps for example, but don't want (or can't due to corporate firewall, etc) to login to Icloud, how do you disable the red notification in system preferences?\n\nA: Clicking on the \"Start using iCloud\" button, and then cancelling it, removes the notification.

How to proceed?\nDid a simple battery replacement. How to test anything to do with that in a minimal way? Are screws and case required to be able to detect battery? Are there any safeties on a macbook that will interfere with testing?\nI have the case base on but have not fully screwed things in. Will try to return battery if nothing comes of this.\n\nA: The key here is to make sure your logic board is fully installed and that none of your cables are loose. Lastly before testing plug in your battery data cable (step 12), as well as your battery screw (step 13) before powering on to check your battery's health. Sometimes your logic board's battery connector will not properly line up with the battery before it is being screwed back in which will result in the system not thinking a battery is installed, so double-check to make sure it is lined up properly.\nYou can use coconutBattery (which is free) to check the health of the battery you received once the system powers on. Cycles should be showing either 0 or 1 if it is new, and design capacity should be at 100%.\nSMC and PRAM resets are also recommended to make sure the system recognizes the newly installed hardware.\nHope this helps.\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Touch+Bar+2017+Battery+Replacement/123894\n(same goes for 13\" machines if that is what you have)\n", "Q: How to improve an applescript that searches for words in a pdf and exports matching pages into the same folder I have a problem that I found a partial solution to.\nDaily, I daily search for a list of words within a pdf document.

It lists two options for you to consider to purchase for the third display.\nI don’t recommend this, the drivers and adapters and time lost usually are more costly than getting a single wide display, but everyone gets to choose what they spend on and some people love the journey and experience DisplayLink provides them.\nYour Pro behaves no differently than MacBook Air looking for two displays.\n", "Q: How do I make it such that PowerPoint for macOS doesn't cause haptic feedback when dragging an image?

Seemingly every tutorial tells me something different. So far there's about 4 different files I can add environmental variables to:\n.zshrc\n.profile\n.zprofile\n.zshenv\nWhich file should I be adding environmental variables to? So far I've got variables in all of them, along with other things like aliases.\nDoes it really matter, or is there a proper standard to follow?\nEdit: Question closed due to it being 'opinion-based'. To clarify, please only provide factual answers, and not opinions.\n\nA: There is a standard as defined in the zsh manual https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Files.html#Startup_002fShutdown-Files\nUnfortunately Apple did not read them fully and so for macOS there is a slight difference. Or they tried to provide adding to path only for login sessions but their solution path_helper messes up what the user sets in .zshenv.\nThe file that the variables in differs as the files are read differently depending on how the shell is launched.\nSo given the files you list\n.profile\nNothing to do with zsh - it is the one file that sh reads. (bash will read this as a login shell if there is no .bash_profile\n.zshenv\nThis file is read by all zsh shells when they start. So any common environment variable should be here.\nThis include $PATH if you follow the zsh manual; however Apple did not read that and in /etc/zshrc which is read after that they add to and reorder the $PATH\nThis file is read by scripts.\n\n.zshenv is sourced on all invocations of the shell, unless the -f option is set. It should contain commands to set the command search path, plus other important environment variables. .zshenv should not contain commands that produce output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.\n\n.zprofile and .zlogin\nCalled at login - this is on each Terminal on macOS but only once on other Unixes\n\n.zlogin is sourced in login shells. It should contain commands that should be executed only in login shells. .zlogout is sourced when login shells exit. .zprofile is similar to .zlogin, except that it is sourced before .zshrc. .zprofile is meant as an alternative to .zlogin for ksh fans; the two are not intended to be used together, although this could certainly be done if desired.\n.zlogin is not the place for alias definitions, options, environment variable settings, etc.; as a general rule, it should not change the shell environment at all. Rather, it should be used to set the terminal type and run a series of external commands (fortune, msgs, etc).\n\n.zshrc\nThis is read in an interactive shell ie when you run the shell to type things in.\n\n.zshrc is sourced in interactive shells. It should contain commands to set up aliases, functions, options, key bindings, etc.\n\nAlso in macOS this is the simplest place to alter the $PATH to correct the order that Apple changes with /usr/libexec/path_helper as your change is in one place - however if you want to be complete you can fix path_helper chnages in ~/.zlogin but you would also then need to add your changes in $PATH in another file for non interactive runs as well).\n\nA: Keeping in line with standards in Bash and .bashrc, you can feel safe storing environment variables for zsh in .zshrc.\nOfficial explanation of load order and purpose of dotfiles are in the zsh man:\nSTARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES\n       Commands are first read from /etc/zshenv; this  cannot  be  overridden. \n       Subsequent behaviour is modified by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options; the former affects all startup files, while the second only affects  global startup  files  (those  shown here with an path starting with a /).  If one of the options is  unset  at  any  point,  any  subsequent  startup file(s)  of the corresponding type will not be read.  It is also possible for a file in  $ZDOTDIR  to  re-enable  GLOBAL_RCS.  Both  RCS  and GLOBAL_RCS are set by default.\n\n       Commands  are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv.  If the shell is a login\n       shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile  and  then  $ZDOTDIR/.zpro-\n       file.   Then,  if  the  shell  is  interactive,  commands are read from\n       /etc/zshrc and then $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc.  Finally, if the shell is a  login\n       shell, /etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.\n\n       When  a  login  shell  exits,  the  files  $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout  and  then\n       /etc/zlogout are read.  This happens with either an explicit  exit  via\n       the exit or logout commands, or an implicit exit by reading end-of-file\n       from the terminal.  However, if the shell terminates  due  to  exec'ing\n       another  process,  the  logout  files  are  not  read.   These are also\n       affected by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options.  Note  also  that  the  RCS\n       option  affects  the saving of history files, i.e. if RCS is unset when\n       the shell exits, no history file will be saved.\n\n       If ZDOTDIR is unset, HOME is used instead.  Files listed above as being\n       in /etc may be in another directory, depending on the installation.\n\n       As /etc/zshenv is run for all instances of zsh, it is important that it\n       be kept as small as possible.  In particular, it is a good idea to  put\n       code  that does not need to be run for every single shell behind a test\n       of the form `if [[ -o rcs ]]; then ...' so that it will not be executed\n       when zsh is invoked with the `-f' option.\n\n       Any  of  these files may be pre-compiled with the zcompile builtin com-\n       mand (see zshbuiltins(1)).  If a compiled file exists  (named  for  the\n       original  file plus the .zwc extension) and it is newer than the origi-\n       nal file, the compiled file will be used instead.\n\nFILES\n\n*\n\n*$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv\n\n*$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile\n\n*$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc\n\n*$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin\n\n*$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout\n\n*${TMPPREFIX}*   (default is /tmp/zsh*)\n\n*/etc/zshenv\n\n*/etc/zprofile\n\n*/etc/zshrc\n\n*/etc/zlogin\n\n*/etc/zlogout    (installation-specific - /etc is the default)\n", "Q: Remote iOS Upgrade Through MDM Bypassing Welcome Screens I administrate an MDM with over 95 locations and 16,000 iOS tablets, distributed globally.\nI have remote access to upgrade iOS to any devices centrally, but also the local admins can push to their specific locations/tablets.\nAll tablets are locked into Single App Mode (kiosk).\nThe question is, Is there a setting or way to push an iOS upgrade with MDM to the tablet and it upgrade without the Welcome screens displaying and forcing a local response on every tablet?\n\nA: In general, no - you can not enroll devices so that iOS auto advances past the entire assistant.\nYou can select some of the screens to be suppressed, which may or may not work for your intended designs unless you can generate profiles to enforce settings your users do not choose or you need to relax privacy.\nhttps://it-training.apple.com/tutorials/deployment-and-management/dm-0901_ar_managing-enrollment-setup-assistant\n\n", "Q: WhatsApp Not Showing in Notification's settings on iPhone in iOS 15.3 \nI asked the same question at (Apps Not Showing in Settings on iPhone in iOS 15.2), but no one knows the answer.\nI have a bad problem, please can anyone help me?\nI update it to iOS 15.3 and nothing happened.\nMy phone is showing this message but I can't find this path on my iPhone (I don't have WhatsApp in notifications in setting)\n\n\n\nA: You can access these settings in two different ways:\n\n*\n\n*Open settings app -> scroll down to WhatsApp -> select Notifications -> turn on notifications for WhatsApp\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open settings app -> scroll to Notifications -> scroll to WhatsApp -> turn on WhatsApp notifications\n\n\nIf neither show up then something is wrong with your WhatsApp installation.

I am using a Magic Trackpad 2 with a KVM, over USB, which seems to work fine, the Trackpad controlling the cursor only on the active computer. However, if I turn on the Macbook Pro's Bluetooth, when I switch to the other computer, both computers are getting the Trackpad's feed (so both cursors move, and clicks go to both). I can see this on the laptop's screen, when the cursor moves off the shared display.\nI use Bluetooth for other devices, so I'd prefer to leave it on, but there is no option in the Bluetooth control panel to \"Unpair\" or \"Disconnect\" the Magic Trackpad, as there is for other devices (such as my phone). Currently, turning off Bluetooth on the MBP is the only solution I've found.\nIs there a way to stop the MBP from pairing with the Magic Trackpad (or, in this case, to unpair them -- permanently)?\n\nA: No, but you can remove the pairing and then plug in the device.

Apple provides updates which allow access to the Apps Store going back as far as OS X El Capitan. So you probably should first try to upgrade to the latest version of OS X El Capitan.\nYou should not need the App Store to download and upgrade to El Capitan.

This technique is used to release a new feature slowly for being able to monitor the usage in order to prevent failures or being able to release a new version if any bug is caught.\n\n*There's also another common practice called A/B Testing which consist in giving the same feature to two users but with a different interface.

On the other hand, the diskutil list command outputs a very reliable information.\nYou can use the diskutil command to create free space after the Apple_APFS partition on the internal SATA HDD. The commands given below are based on the output from diskutil list command given in your question. You can use the command given below to show how much the Apple_APFS partition on the internal SATA HDD could be shrunk.\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 limits\n\nProvided the space is available, the command below would shrink the Apple_APFS partition on the internal SATA HDD to 770 GB and create 100 GB of free space between the Apple_APFS partition and the Microsoft Basic Data partition.\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 770G\n\nThere are third party tools which can move (or resize upward) a Microsoft Basic Data partition which is NTFS formatted. See this answer for a discussion regarding the pros and cons of these tools and the recommendation of first using chkdsk.\nApple often uses proprietary SSDs which require special drivers. In your case you have a Fusion Container which uses an internal SSD and internal HDD. Windows also resides on this HDD. Here, I assume the HDD uses a standard SATA interface and therefore can be successfully modified by the third party tools discussed in this answer.\n", "Q: How to open new instance of applications from spotlight every time on Mac m1 (Big Sur & above) Instead of directing to the application, how to make spotlight open a new instance/window of the application.\nTried flashlight solution but it won't work for recent Mac OS Versions.\n\nA: I don't think the Spotlight interface is programmable or customizable is any meaningful way, so you can't change it's behaviour.\nIf you want to open a new window of an already open app, right-click on the app's icon in the Dock, or just switch to it with Command Tab and then do Command N. That's probably as quick as typing a name in Spotlight.\nYou may be able to set an app to create a new document when it launches: but that's likely a preference of the application, which it will either have, or not, depending on whether the devs thought about it.\nIf you want multiple instances of an application (i.e. more than one running process), then that is possible from the Terminal by using open -n -a ApplicationName (see man open for more), though reasons for doing so are few.\n", "Q: Slow start-up and right click on link lag in Safari Earlier today I had an issue with an extension not showing up in Safari.

If you're responsible for an organization's computers, you might want to consider putting a logo on them - if it is a private computer, you could be marking it with your name.\nIf the markings are hard to remove, that makes them less desirable and slightly more \"useless\" when stolen. Note that this also means that it can be harder to sell as used later.\nYou can consider similarly marking the components inside the laptop, but it is really not as effective as with the casing.\nAnother option is use DNA marking. Some insurance companies gives out free or very low cost DNA marking kits - including stickers to put on the computer to make it clear that it has been marked.\n", "Q: Finder icon thumbnails not showing This is a popular issue with new mac updates.

My MacBook charger won't magnetise properly anymore. I took a look at the ports and one of the little gold things are burnt, and the same one on my MacBook. I tested my old charging cable that broke and it still magnetises so it isn't specifically the Mac book. Is there any way I can fix this? Or find someone to replace the cable with my older, perfectly fine cable?\nI'm a student so I really need my laptop.\n\nA: The first thing to try is cleaning the MagSafe contacts. The burned metal nubs within the MagSafe plug (on the charger cord) and socket (on the computer) can both be cleaned using a electrical contact cleaner (like DeOxIt, available at electronics supply houses, hardware stores, big-box stores or online) or even alcohol, applied with a Q-Tip. After cleaning and drying both, try your charger again. Cleaning may allow the plug-and-socket magnets to clamp together; that and the clean nubs may be enough to resurrect charging. If your MacBook then charges, you're good to go.\nIf your MacBook still doesn't work, try your MacBook (after making sure the MagSafe socket has clean nubs) with a known-good charger borrowed from a friend. If your MacBook works with the borrowed charger, then your MacBook is OK but your charger and/or cable is damaged. If your MacBook doesn't work with a known-good charger, then you'll need to take your equipment in for repair.\nThe charger and cable is available from the Apple Store as well as online from other vendors, but other vendors' versions, usually cheaper than Apple's, are sometimes not up to Apple's quality standards.\nYou can also take your charger to a repair person to change the cable. The charger case must be disassembled and the new cable soldered in place, but this is not a technically difficult repair. If, however, your charger itself (not the cable) is defective, just replacing the cable will not fix the no-charge issue.\n", "Q: File ownership issues on PC shared folder I have a shared folder on my Mac that I use to transfer files from a PC.

I have an Allen and Heath Qu-32 soundboard which has the ability to be controlled from a mobile device on the same network. Where it is currently, I can’t plug the board directly into the router, so instead I have attempted to connect it to the local network through MacOS’ Internet Sharing feature. I have an iMac connected to the router through WiFi, and with Internet Sharing, I have the soundboard connected through an Ethernet cable from the iMac. The soundboard says it has an IP Address of “192.168.1.2”, however, when I attempt to connect to this address from a phone on the WiFi network, it does not work. Networking is not my forte, but I suspect that Network Sharing creates its own sub-network of some sort. Is it even possible to connect to this device, and, if so, how?\nP.S.- As I mentioned, Networking is not my forte so you may have to dumb it down for me.\n\nA: By visiting Allen and Heath's website, one can determine the manufacturer assumes a wireless router with at least one LAN ethernet jack would be available for use with the Qu-32 soundboard.\n\nThe idea proposed in the posted question of simply substituting the iMac's macOS Internet Sharing for the wireless router does not work because a different LAN is created for each chosen physical port. Also, the iMac's WiFi can only be assigned to one LAN at a time\n\nFor example, if a second WiFi adaptor (as a physical port) was add to the iMac, then by employing macOS Internet Sharing, the iMac's ethernet physical port and the wireless access point provided by the second WiFi adaptor would exist on different LANs.\nUsing the existing wireless access point may be possible provided which TCP/IP ports to forward in the iMac can be determined and that the chosen ports would not conflict with ports needed by the iMac for proper functioning of the iMac. There have already been answered questions explaining how to instruct a Mac to port forward. Below are two such questions. Unfortunately, the answers probably are not as dumbed down as much as requested.\n\n*\n\n*This question address newer versions of OS X and macOS: Redirect traffic using PF along with Internet Sharing.\n\n*This question addresses older versions of OS X: Port Forwarding From a Shared Connection.\n\nA simple solution would be to acquire a wireless router with at least one LAN ethernet port, as shown in the Qu Series Reference Guide. In this case, the only reason to use the iMac's macOS Internet Sharing is to allow devices in the same LAN as the Qu-32 soundboard access to the rest of the internet. Below are two modification to the instructions given in the Qu Series Reference Guide that would allow such devices access to the internet.\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the router functions, such as DHCP, in the wireless router and use the wireless router as a router, wireless access point and ethernet switch. The iMac would be connected to the WAN ethernet jack on the router. All remaining ethernet connections would be to the LAN jacks in the router. Here, the router functions, such as DHCP, would be supplied by both the iMac and wireless router. There would be two LANs. The first LAN would be between the iMac and the wireless router and the second would be between the wireless router and the other devices.\n\n\n*Turn off the router functions, such as DHCP, in the wireless router and just use the wireless router as a wireless access point and ethernet switch. All ethernet connections (including the iMac) would be to the LAN jacks in the router. Here, the router functions such as DHCP would be supplied by the iMac. This configuration allows the iMac to exist in the same LAN as the Qu-32 soundboard.\nOther References\nGeneral. Qu. SQ.

I am a new macOS user and I want to create a bash script that I can add to the PATH and run as a \"normal\" command (cd for example). I'm the only user of the Mac and so I'll be forever, but just in case, I don't want to put my script in a place where other users can run it.\nWhat's the standar way of doing so? Do i have to put it in my home directory? or maybe somewhere in the root and restrict access with chmod? I'm a bit confused... Any help is appreciated!\n\nA: As the other answers have noted anything in your home directory (under $HOME) is only writeable by you by default. (and admin users). If you want to make the scripts not runnable by other users you will need to chnage the file permissions and remove the execute bit from the group and others\nHowever the other answers do not deal with getting it to run and do not relly answer the question which I think how do I get the command into my PATH and not on others.\nThe usual place to put scripts only for you traditionally in unix is in a directory $HOME/bin (although newer suggestions include $HOME/.local/bin\nYou have to create either of those and then add them to your path\nIn bash and zsh this is to add export PATH=~/bin:$PATH to your startup files (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc) as you usually want your commands to be found before general commands.\n\nA: The whole point of user accounts is to provide areas that are separate to each user.\nThe contents of your user account are not normally available to other users, and vice versa.\nIf you want to make your script only available to 'your user', then put it somewhere inside your user account.\n", "Q: Time Machine backup failure Time Machine has started to fail when I try to backup.

I transferred everything to the new system, all now on 12.2, and everything is running - except one problem I cannot solve.\nWhen I use spotlight search, the preview results underneath the search bar are quite fine. Some of everything shows up, folders, files, documents, and emails. But, when I want to expand the view and show results in finder, everything is here, except emails. This was working on High Sierra perfectly.\nI rebuild the spotlight index from scratch, I reindexed my mail database, nothing helped. I even dont think spotlight is broken, since the results in the preview panel are perfect.\nThe finder just does not show mails. When I save a message .eml in my home directory, it is displayed in the finder results if matching, nicely in a messaging tab. But all my mails which are residing in the normal mail database are not showing up.\nI'm really clueless what to do. I checked spotlight and finder defaults, but all looks good.\nWhy is my finder not showing mail results? Some safety issue? A missing tweak? I don't now.\nAny idea? Suggestions? HELP?!? ;-)\n\nA: Mail is now indexed using \"Core Spotlight\". This was a Big Sur change.\nA Core Spotlight index contains data specific to a single app. For searching the index is available to a) the app to which the content belongs, and b) Spotlight search. So searching for mail is no longer available to Finder or third party apps. You will find that the same is true for Apple Notes.\nThere is one exception to the limitation: Apple Mail can make its Core Spotlight index available to other apps which include an app specific Mail Plugin. This is controlled (from the Apple Mail perspective) in the general preferences under Manage Plug-ins.\n\nAs far as I am aware, HoudahSpot is the only search app which is able to search in Apple Mail as well as the file system.\nThis is just one of a number of frustrating changes introduced with macOS 11 (Big Sur).\nYou may like to read Howard Oakley's blog article on Core Spotlight.\n", "Q: BigSur SSH can connect a server in the intranet but cannot connect to a internet server I tried a lot of things to figure out why my SSH gives me the following message (I am using IP and I took out the IP address)\nOpenSSH_8.1p1, LibreSSL 2.7.3\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config\ndebug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 47: Applying options for *\ndebug1: Connecting to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx [xxx.xxx.xxxxxx] port 22.\ndebug1: connect to address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx port 22: Operation timed out\n\nI can connect to my VM (on the same machine), a server in my intranet (even inside VPN) without any issues.\nBut, every time I connect to a server on the internet.

Safari would then go to the image URL in the current tab. I'll have to backspace to go back to the original page. If I'm filling out a form, all of the data would be erased. Is there a way to stop this image drag-drop from opening on a page in Safari?\n\nA: Nope. To fix this issue, probably give a request to Apple to add some feature (use your creativity to do it) here: https://apple.com/feedback.\nOr you can browse the App Store to install plugins to help with it somewhat. And yes, I do understand how frustrating it could be while filling out forms.\nOne of the only ways is to reach out to Apple or you can download Microsoft Edge or any other browser if you like.\nBut the answer to the question is a no.\n\nA: No! Not without any extensions at user level.\nI guess this is the default behaviour in all apps that support drag and drop feature. If we are dragging something to a page or app, if there isn't any function to handle that; it'll open the file. For ex: If we drag and drop to onedrive webpage, it'll start uploading.\nThis behaviour can be handled by the webpage creator to add a user confirmation before leaving the page.\n\nA: It can be pretty disastrous with safari because it will replace the current open page and throw away the current contents, which can be a form (like stackoverflow answer) you are just filling in.  Same for Firefox.\nMy current workaround is to use Chrome.  It still open the dropped file, but at least it always open the dropped file in a new tab, so it does not destroy the current open page.\n\n", "Q: M1 chip, docker and a warning I am using macOS Monterey Version 12.0.1 with the Apple M1 chip.\nI have downloaded the appropriate version of Docker, but when I tried to execute the following in the terminal - I am following some online lectures -\ndocker run -v $PWD:/usr/local/share/scalar_blocks wlandry/sdpb:2.5.1 scalar_blocks --dim 3 --order 40 --max-derivs 10 --spin-ranges 0-20 --poles 18 --delta-12 0 --delta-34 0 --num-threads=4 -o/usr/local/share/scalar_blocks/output --precision 776\n\nI got a warning\nWARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested\n\nI have seen this complaint going around online, but there are so many answers that I am not sure which approach is the most resilient with regards to this matter.

With the message you see it informs you that the running image will be using translation x86 to M1 architecture.\nIn order to avoid this you need to build yourself a Docker image using source code of an application or ask a developer to build and post it on Docker Hub.\nIf you browse to the docker hub page of the image you are running here, have a look at the section \"OS/ARCH\" it has only \"linux/amd64\" which is not M1 architecture, for M1 it should be ARM64.\nThe issue is also mentioned at Docker web site in the \"Known issues\" section.\n", "Q: My son's screen time does not appear on one of my devices even though I can see his permission request from the device I have 6 iOS 15 devices, among them,\n\n*\n\n*5 are using same apple id, as parent devices\n\n*another one is using child apple id.\n\nPreviously parent controls worked well and child screen time were showed on all 5 parent devices.\nHowever, after I did following things, one of my device can not show child screen time at all.\n\n*\n\n*all update to iOS15\n\n*backup 1 parent device (let us call it OLD) and restore it to another device (let us call it NEW).\n\nThe result is that the NEW can not show child screen time, but can continue see child permission request from my son, I can still approve/reject, just can not show hist screen time from the NEW.\nI have tried turn off family share then turn on again, rejoined my son's device into family, all other parent devices works as before, but just the NEW does not work.\nAny idea?\n\nA: No worry, I found the answer. It is because of too many devices, maximum 5 devices in a family.\nActually I have another 7 devices, include a MacOS. After I factory reset the OLD, I still have 6 devices in total, 5 parent devices, 1 child device.\nSince the Apple's family feature can only handle maximum 5 devices, so only 4 parent devices can see my son's screen time, the 5th(NEW) can not.\nAfter I sign out Apple id from the MacOS (i.e, reduced total device count into 5, so all 4 parent devices including the NEW now can see my son's screen time).\n", "Q: Photos app on macOS doesn't upload any photos (\"Sync session in push got error\") I want to upload around 20k of photos in a complete new Photos iCloud library.

I have still ~150GB of free storage on my iCloud account as well.\nIs there any other way of uploading the photos? How can I batch/mass upload photos to iCloud?\n\nA: It appears all of Apple's photo daemons and general iCloud syncing occur in batches of ~900 items. While the start/stops of the batches are a little erratic (a few seconds apart, up to an hour). I do find that the system eventually chews through everything. It certainly would be nice to be able to tell the system to accelerate through to the end.\n", "Q: No admin account on Big Sur i updated my mothers macbook air 2014 to Big Sur, I had problems during install and finished the install in safe mode. after restarting i was prompted with her old login screen which accepted her old passsword, this transitioned me to a new second login screen, there i have to login in with a new password.

Why are they asking for incoming network connections? I was asked to allow/block netbiosd & rapportd, but I do not know what they are, so I block both of them. What are they, and blocking them is okay?\n\n\nA: rapportd is an application that serves Apple's \"Handoff\" connections from your phone, more details are here\nnetbios is an application to serve compatibility of file share application like Samba or SMB protocol more info about it can be found here. It is an old replacement of computer naming resolving across the network. How to disable netbios is here\nAnswering the question: they require incoming connection in order to connect to your computer, rapportd for iMessage, phone calls, maybe clipboard sharing etc. and netbios for computer name resolution.

Shortcuts Events.app used to randomly run and steal window focus; it did it from once per hour to once per two hours. After the OS update, I've been monitoring app switch for more than 4 hours, and Shortcuts Events.app never shows up again.\nPlease upgrade your macOS to 12.3 to see if your problem has been fixed.\n\nA: The Shortcuts App is a new addition to MacOS / iOS enabling programmable interactions with your device. If it is stealing focus, it sounds like you have some shortcut configured, possibly on a timed interval.\nEasiest thing to do would be open the Mac shortcuts app, go to all shortcuts, and try and delete or disable shortcuts until this loss of focus stops happening.\n", "Q: What do Option-Up Arrow and Option-Down Arrow do in the Finder? Okay, I have no idea how I stumbled onto this and can't recall encountering it before (and I've been using Macs for a LOONNGG time, but what does combining the Option key with the up/down arrow keys do in the Finder (Mac OSX 12.1 Monterey)?\nI thought it was cycling through open windows (nope), then I thought it was \"walking\" back through windows that have been closed (nope, I don't think), maybe it was going up/down the hierarchy (nope, that's what CMD-up/down does). I can have a single Finder window open, hit Option-Up, get some rando window, close it, do the same keystroke again, and get a completely different and unrelated, and equally random window.\n\nA: A pre-emptive guess - you have Default Folder X installed.\nIt's in the default shortcuts list…\n\nI'm not sure I fully agree with its definition of 'Recents' - mine didn't quite match the Finder's list [though it does now I've been playing with it for half an hour, of course]\nAnother guess - it's using its own Recents list of folders I've accessed through Open/Save dialogs rather than via Finder itself.\nAn app I've been using maybe two decades,  since before it had the 'X', & I still haven't explored its full potential - I really should, one day ;)\n", "Q: How do I make certain apps appear in the Recent Apps section in the dock, and others not appear? There's some apps I would like to disappear from the dock in the recent apps, others I want to stay.\n\nThe current behaviour is that when the recent apps are full, Reddit disappears instead of staying in the recent apps.\nI want the Chrome Reddit PWA to stay in the dock recent apps, but, for example, I would like CleanMyMac to disappear once closed. How do I configure this? Thank you in advance!\n\nA: If you want an app to stay, move it out of the recents section.\nThe recents section will not hold more than 3 apps at once, but if you have more than 3 apps open then it will grow to accommodate the open apps. So, if you close Reddit PWA then you now only have 3 apps and Clean My Mac will stay even when closed.\n", "Q: How are Apple devices maintaining persistent connections with Apple servers for things such as APN, FindMy network, etc Apple devices such as iPhones and Macs are able to receive near real-time notifications from the APN system, as well as frequently checking in with the FindMy network, and more. I am wondering how these devices are able to maintain persistent connections with Apple servers.\nI assume that Apple devices would not use something like polling, since that would likely eat up battery and waste cellular data. I'm wondering if Apple uses something like WebSockets, or maybe their own proprietary system?\n\nA: TCP/IP socket\nThe connection is likely a traditional network socket using TCP/IP. A keep-alive option can help maintain a quiet connection.\nThe interesting problem is how Apple choose to handle the millions of concurrent connections, see the C10K problem and The Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connections.\n\nA: Each device opens TCP v4 and/or v6 connection(s) over one or more of the following ports.\n\nIf you use a firewall or private Access Point Name for cellular data, your Apple devices must be able to connect to specific ports on specific hosts:\n\n*\n\n*TCP port 5223 to communicate with APNs.\n\n*TCP port 443 or 2197 to send notifications to APNs.\n\nTCP port 443 is used during device activation, and afterwards for fallback if devices can't reach APNs on port 5223. The connection on port 443 uses a proxy as long as the proxy allows the communication to pass through without decrypting.\nThe APNs servers use load balancing, so your devices don't always connect to the same public IP address for notifications. It's best to let your device access these ports on the entire 17.0.0.0/8 address block, which is assigned to Apple\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203609\nOn Apple server side, they proxy connection from third party and end user requests to send a notification to another device.\n\nAPNs makes every effort to deliver your notifications, and to deliver them with the best user experience:\n\n*\n\n*APNs manages an accredited, encrypted, and persistent IP connection to the user’s device.\n\n*APNs can store notifications for a device that’s currently offline. APNs then forwards the stored notifications when the device comes online.\n\n*APNs can coalesce notifications with the same bundle ID.\n\n\nAs for the how, Apple silicon efficiency cores and tight integration between the network stack, os, hardware design and power management let the devices sleep much of the time while they are waiting and not busy with other local tasks. Local notifications also serve to wake up the device without needing any network connection.\n\nA: Although the existing answers provide a more-or-less accurate description on how this ongoing connection looks like - they describe the feature using terms that are generic (IP, API, TCP+keep-alive) and so on - that may be true - but miss the whole \"Apple\" face of the thing. These answers could explain both Android and Windows and actually any computing platform maintaining long-term responsive connections.\nThe important addition I want to add here - is that Apple's \"Base OS\" - the part shared between MacOS iOS tvOS, watchOS and so on - contains several sub-systems and APIs that allow such behavior practically \"for free\" to any software developer, provided they use the \"recommended\" OS subsystems, and not mere generic networking APIs (such as posix etc.)\nThe ability to maintain long-term responsive connection is not required just by notififaction-based services (like \"FindMy\" and others - but also for all remote-media services - FaceTime, iTunes, Maps (Navigation) and in reality all their competitors too (Zoom, Viber, Slack, and friends).\nOne important feature the OP did NOT mention - the ability to survive and renew connection immediately when switching networks, network-stacks and when using multiple networking-stacks and facilities concurrently - is important too. an iPhone can switch from Cellular to WiFi, to Bluetooth and even use all 3 together dozens of times within a single call.\nThe important mechanisms to learn are:\n\n*\n\n*The SystemConfiguration framework (for \"Reachability\" and non-polling ability to maintain a connection)\n\n*CFNetwork Framework - the Core Foundation framework implementing most of the low and high level interfaces to network services- where all access via \"proxy\" or \"firewall\" or long-term-connection maintenance  is implemented\n\n*NSURLSession - the higher level Swift/Obj-C APIs allowing app developers maintain such connections.\n\nI had to use all three when I developers Audio/Video-Conferencing software, security agents, remote-database-management tools and many others. I always marveled how easy and efficient Apple-provided APIs were in comparison with solutions I built for other platforms.\nJust a tiny example: When you \"tell the OS\" you want to keep connection to specific Server - and be notified on changes in its \"Reachability\", the OS does this for you - but NOT within your own process. It is an OS service. So... your app can be killed, and be re-launched immediately when connection is re-established. Also - if 3 processes need maintain connection to some domain or service - OS only tracks that domain/service ONCE for all registered \"listeners\". which also improves efficiency.\nSo - When you plug Ethernet cable in or out - OS doesn't need to \"poll\" on the thing - it maintains the interrupt-based hardware anyway. It can be done much more efficiently! same for when you lose Cellular connection.\nLast - I recommend on learning these 3 Apple frameworks, and learn how its done on this platform.\nA good start can be watching this video from Apple WWDC 2015 - Introducing Network.framework: A modern alternative to Sockets\n", "Q: Connect to wifi using a file My dad has troubles with technology. Is there a way I can send him a file with wifi settings so that he can automatically connect to my network?\n\nA: If you're asking about him connecting his phone or tabled to your network, you can generate a QR code that when he points his camera at, will prompt him to connect to your network.\nEmbedded in that QR code is the Wi-Fi name and Password. After the initial connection, his phone or tablet should auto-join.\nhttps://qifi.org/ will allow you to make this QR code which you can then print out.\n", "Q: Disk Utility with extra Mac HD after clean install on Monterey (formerly Big Sur) Not sure if I need to re-format and re-install again.\nIs it normal to see so many Mac HD, and should I try to remove the extra ones?\nHad some HD issue where somehow there was no space left and thus there was nothing to do but to clean install everything.\nNow it seems there are multiple Mac HD / Mac HD - Data, with different avail space, as shown:\n\n\n ~ % diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI ⁨EFI⁩                     314.6 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS ⁨Container disk1⁩         850.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:       Microsoft Basic Data ⁨BOOTCAMP⁩                150.2 GB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +850.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume ⁨Macintosh HD - Data⁩     688.1 KB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume ⁨Preboot⁩                 271.6 MB   disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                1.1 GB     disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume ⁨VM⁩                      1.1 GB     disk1s4\n   5:                APFS Volume ⁨Macintosh HD - Data⁩     66.9 GB    disk1s5\n   6:                APFS Volume ⁨Macintosh HD⁩            15.7 GB    disk1s7\n   7:              APFS Snapshot ⁨com.apple.os.update-...⁩ 15.7 GB    disk1s7s1\n\n/dev/disk2 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +455.4 MB   disk2\n   1:        Apple_partition_map ⁨⁩                        32.3 KB    disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS ⁨Google Chrome⁩           455.3 MB   disk2s2\n                    (free space)                         13.0 GB    -\n\n/dev/disk5 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +401.1 MB   disk5\n   1:                  Apple_HFS ⁨Unity Hub 3.0.1⁩         401.0 MB   disk5s1\n\n/dev/disk6 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +2.4 GB     disk6\n   1:                        EFI ⁨EFI⁩                     209.7 MB   disk6s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS ⁨Visual Studio⁩           2.1 GB     disk6s2\n\n\nA: *\n\n*The first line in the sidebar, with the stack icon and labeled \"Macintosh HD  (volumes)\" is your installation.\n\n*\n\n*Inside this, it contains \"Macintosh HD\" and \"Macintosh HD - Data.\"\n\n*\n\n*The greyed-out \"Macintosh HD\" is your system volume, but it's heavily protected.\n\n*\n\n*The not-greyed-out \"Macintosh HD (snapshot)\" is what your system is actively using to work and operate, but is reset at boot.\n\n\n\n*\"Macintosh HD - Data\" contains any non-OS files.

(I actually have a capture card, but capture cards are essentially virtual monitors.)\nI'm trying to mirror my mac on a \"display\" so I can record it for further reference. I noticed in settings (display) that when you link up the monitor, you have an option to either mirror your main screen (essentially your macbook's POV), or use it as an external monitor.\nBy default, macOS thinks you want to use the display as an external monitor so you'd have to change it. When I do change it, it remembers my decision for that one monitor.\nWhen I boot into recovery mode, the monitor is treated as a secondary monitor. How do I make it so my macbook treats the external monitor as the primary monitor (or at least mirrors it), so that recovery mode window appears on the external monitor instead of the laptop screen; or other interfaces appear on the external monitor. An example being the first time macOS setup screen/user setup which I have tested on OBS to capture the display and only shows the blurry macos monterey screen. I can also move my mouse cursor to the right onto the external screen.\nSignificance? - Your laptop screen is broken.\n\nA: Apparently macOS has this thing called \"clamshell mode\", where you make your macbook into a desktop-like setup. Here's how it works...:\n\n*\n\n*Close macbook\n\n*Plug an HDMI cable into your monitor (or capture card going into another macbook with obs running)\n\n*Plug in a mouse and keyboard, most likely USB if you want to record yourself going into recovery.

The iMac is now in pieces, but I believe I needed to go on a fishing expedition. Do to the age of the Mac, I did not have recovery available. Instead, I booted from the Snow Leopard DVD.

If you wish, the downloaded ISO can be verified against the SHA256 checksum given in this answer. For example, if the ISO was downloaded to your Downloads folder, then enter the command given below.\ncertutil -hashfile \"%homepath%\\downloads\\snow leopard install.iso\" sha256\n\n\n\n*Use the USB flash drive to boot the Mac. Use the Disk Utility to erase the internal drive, then install Snow Leopard.\n\n\n*Use the Windows machine to download the Mac OS 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1 file MacOSXUpdCombo10.6.8.dmg. The URL is https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1399?locale=en_US.\n\n\n*Transfer the Mac OS 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1 file MacOSXUpdCombo10.6.8.dmg to the Mac and upgrade the Mac to OS X 10.6.8.\n\n\n*Download and install any addition updates available for Snow Leopard from the App Store.\n\n\n*Use the Mac to install the Install OS X El Capitan application. Follow the instructions given at the Apple website \"How to get old versions of macOS\". The URL is https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683.\n\n\n*Upgrade to El Capitan by executing the Install OS X El Capitan application. Or, do a clean install by creating a USB flash drive El Capitan installer, booting from the flash drive, erasing the internal drive and installing El Capitan. The instructions for creating the USB flash drive El Capitan installer are given at the Apple website \"How to create a bootable installer for macOS\". The URL is https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372.\n\n\n*Download and install any addition updates available for El Capitan from the App Store.\nInstalling Windows 7\nSince your Mac does not have a working DVD drive, you can not use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 7. There is a legacy method for installing which can be found here.\n", "Q: How to open a http page in safari? I am using Safari 14.1.2 on macOS 10.14.6, and when I try to open a http page in Safari (typing an address as \"http://...\" (without an \"s\"))  I get the error\nSafari can’t open the page “https://...” because Safari can’t establish a secure connection to the server “...”.\n\nIs there a way to open such a page nevertheless in Safari? This is for testing purposes only, (to test the rendering of this non-public page, visible only through VPN), so there is no security concern? I know what I am doing!\nAny option or preferences I can change so Safari can open a http page?\n\nA: There is the chance that Safari is remembering past HTTPS redirection. Open Safari > Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data. Search for the website and delete it's entry (this will clear caches, local stored data about the website, and HSTS policies which redirect HTTP to HTTPS preemtively).\nIf this doesn't fix the issue, then the site is redirecting to HTTPS for you, when it shouldn't be. The site will need to be reconfigured not to do this.\nYou can circumvent it because there are two types of HTTPS issues:\n\n*\n\n*Invalid/expired/non-trusted certificate: this issue can be circumvented by asking Safari to ignore the problem and continue on\n\n*Unable to establish secure connection: communicating over HTTPS is failing completely. There's nothing to override because the line of communication is not working. It must be switched back to regular HTTP to fix.\n\n", "Q: Copying of Time Machine backup at 127% I am trying to copy pre-existing backups from an older 2TB drive to a new 5TB drive.\nGiven that I am on macOS Catalina, I simply copied in Finder using command-C on the Backups.backupdb folder and pasted using command-V.\nLast night, it reached 1.44 / 1.44 TB but the copying 0 items dialog remained with ETA of 5 seconds.\nI let it keep running overnight, and this morning, it is now at 1.85 / 1.85 TB with an ETA of 5 seconds.\nGiven that the old 2TB drive has 160GB of free space, I don’t understand what is happening! I thought that macOS 10.13.4 fixed the issue with hard links.\nCan you please tell me what is happening and what steps I should take now to get the files correctly copied?\nEDIT: The phantom copying stopped within an hour of posting this but I still don’t understand what happened.\n\nA: There's a 'golden rule' for copying Time Machine & I think \"copy/paste\" might break it.\nUse the Finder.\nFinder knows how to do this task. Almost nothing else ever does. All other methods fail to correctly identify all the hard links & you end up copying terrabytes of useless duplicates.\nSimple Steps…\n\n*\n\n*Switch off Time Machine.\n\n*Drag the backups.backupdb folder to the root of your new HFS+ drive.\n\n*When done, set Time Machine to the new drive then re-enable.\n\nA more comprehensive guid can be seen at How-To Geek - How to Migrate a Time Machine Backup to Another Drive\nNote: This all changes with Big Sur & later on APFS drives - which I have no direct experience with, as yet.\n", "Q: How to remove the MacOS Legacy System Extension signed by Golden Frog Inc (kextstat does not help) After every update of my MacOS, an error message like this is shown to me upon restart:\n\nI deleted VyprVpn long time ago, but this system extensions seems to still run on my laptop.\nIn System Information -> Software -> Extensions, there is nothing that says VyprVpn or Golden Frog. I guess that's because \"Golden Frog\" is who signed the extension, but the extension name is different.\nRunning kextstat | grep -v com.apple does not show anything with \"Golden Frog\" either, so this answer does not help.\nHow can I identify and remove that extension completely?\nPlease note that my question is not solely about how to remove an extension, but also how to find / identify it based on the error message where it only says who signed that extension.\n\nA: About this mac -> System report -> Software section in the sidebar\nRelevant sections are \"Legacy Software\", \"Extensions\", and \"Disabled Software\". You can also get the list of all application using system_profiler and grep for the said code sign identity.\n", "Q: How to bind Cmd+Space to Launchpad I'd like to bind Cmd+Space to open Launchpad because I can't remove web suggestions from Spotlight.\nIn Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts, I've unchecked the box next to the Spotlight shortcut and changed the Launchpad shortcut to Cmd+Space. It tends to work for a bit, but eventually it just stops working and Cmd+Space does nothing. Is there a way to reliably bind Cmd+Space to open Launchpad instead of Spotlight?\n\nA: For me, it works well this way (on current latest macOS Monterey 12.3.1, MBA 10.1 - 2020, with the Spotlight button that replaced the traditional Launcher button on F4):\nin Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts:\n\n*\n\n*in left hand side menu: Spotlight, make sure you unchecked the shortcut Cmd + Space\n\n\n*in left hand side menu: Launchpad & Dock, it should be initially set to none, click on it, type Cmd + Space, make sure the checkbox is enabled\nYou should be done.\nDouble check you don't have any interfering shortcut in other menus, especially in App Shorctuts\n", "Q: Alternative for getent to launch containerized ShinyProxy with a docker engine I'm following this tutorial to launch a containerized ShinyProxy with a docker enine. It works as expected, until there is this getent command that seems to be unavailable for MacOS :(\nsudo docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro --group-add $(getent group docker | cut -d: -f3) --net sp-example-net -p 8080:8080 shinyproxy-example\n\nI tested the outcome of getent group docker | cut -d: -f3 on a Linux computer running Debian 11 (where it was possible to open the apps within the ShinyProxy docker image, btw):\n$ getent group docker\ndocker:x:998:r\n$ getent group docker | cut -d: -f3\n998\n\nI tried to achieve similar on a MacOS 12.2 with dscacheutil, but there seems to be no group named docker:\n$ dscacheutil -q group | grep docker\n\n\nOut of desparation, I tried to launch docker without the --group-add-part, but then ShinyProxy dumps its cores. Thus, my question: what command can replace getent?\n\nA: You could use the id command instead:\nid -G docker\n\nThis will tell you which groups the docker user is a part of.\n", "Q: Preview automatically password protects PDF when saving I experienced a behaviour I've never seen before when opening, editing and saving a PDF today. As soon as save the PDF with Preview the file will be password protected, and I cannot open it again.\nI've tested this on multiple files, but it seems to only affect files that have an \"administrator password\" set.\nTest files from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency:\nhttps://www.forsakringskassan.se/wps/wcm/connect/b581c10a-8782-4c84-8448-4a469b85422b/fk7457-004-f-002.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=&CACHE=NONE&CONTENTCACHE=NONE\nhttps://www.forsakringskassan.se/wps/wcm/connect/def06bb9-268f-47bd-a99d-2aa3dd75f855/fk7804-004-f-001.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=\nIs this behaviour somehow by design? I've never seen it before, and at first I suspected that some kind of malware caused this. But now I'm not so sure anymore.\nI'm using macOS Monterey 12.2.\n\nA: I have the same problem with documents from the Australian government on macOS Monterey 12.5 with Preview Version 11.0 (1033.4).\nMy current workaround is to open and edit the document in Chrome and then save it with my edits. This results in a saved file that I can view without a password.\n\nA: I have the same problem with Australian Government forms on my MacOS Monterey 12.6 and Preview 11.0 (1033.4). I think I've found the best workaround which still allows editing after re-opening the document; by expanding a bit from Cailean's answer:\n\n*\n\n*Open the PDF. You can start filling the fields but DON'T save it\n\n\n*Hit File > Export... > Permissions...\n\n\n*Type in 'Owner Password' (any password will work)\n\n\n*Above 'Owner Password', make sure to tick all the checkboxes under 'Permissions'. These will allow changes to be made without entering password in the future.\n\n\n\n*Hit Apply > Save. You can save the file with the same name, just confirm the overwrite by clicking the 'Replace' button.\n\n\n*Fill up the PDF fields and save normally.\n\n\n*Close the document and re-open it, it shouldn't ask for password and you should still be able to edit it just fine.\n\nA: I called the Immigration Department (Australian Government) and they can't give me a password for the document.\nHere's the solution: open the PDF with Adobe Acrobat Reader, edit it with Acrobat, save it with Acrobat. This is the only 'supported' PDF reader.\nI downloaded the form again and tired Acrobat; it works.\nI downloaded a new form again and tried it with MacOS Preview; it password protects on save.\nFurther investigation shows that the password is applied (not sure of the correct word) as soon as you edit/save with Preview. Acrobat does not do this.\nPreview is clearly broken and should never be trusted with anything important again.\nI can't even verbalise my level of anger over this.\n\nA: The pdf was created with security features enabled. Only the creator of the document would be able to change the security settings. The following screenshot shows what can and cannot be done.\n\n\nA: I tried the \"Export...\" option, then clicked on the \"Permissions...\" button. Entering in an owner password and then clicking \"Save\" allowed me to re-open the PDF without a password. (Full disclosure: I used my user account password as the owner password, in case that makes a difference.)\n", "Q: SSH Key Fingerprint Changes I copied an SSH private key from my Linux machine to my M1 Mac. (I've attempted to do this both by uploading the cyphertext to a secrets manager as well as directly transfering the file) but when attempting to SSH to the same machine from each I can only succeed from the Linux machine.\nLinux machine:\n$ ssh -V\nOpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.4, OpenSSL 1.1.1f  31 Mar 2020\n$ md5sum id_rsa\n7ed8b0c73e168ef48acc715d4c6bcf73  id_rsa\n$ sha256sum id_rsa\n969d0a35b36c50035881bdd2d8367b90dbff548131d5c72989d29e83b7a3aa19  id_rsa\n$ ssh-keygen -l -f id_rsa\n4096 SHA256:d19Ee+tlzVHitLzKuuZbdgYcnhla96ypXNtpBwrqfqE redacted@redacted.com (RSA)\n$ ssh -i id_rsa crthaze@ec2-55-55-55-55.compute-1.amazonaws.com\n[redacted MOTD; WORKS]\n\nM1 Mac:\n$ ssh -V\nopenSSH_8.6p1, LibreSSL 2.8.3\n$ md5 id_rsa\nMD5 (id_rsa) = 7ed8b0c73e168ef48acc715d4c6bcf73\n$ shasum -a 256 id_rsa\n969d0a35b36c50035881bdd2d8367b90dbff548131d5c72989d29e83b7a3aa19  id_rsa\n$ ssh-keygen -l -f id_rsa\n4096 SHA256:rWsP9jN2otlchh8icr/jlnZxDjEfEkngDJOoPh4RYZI redacted@redacted.com (RSA)\n$ ssh -i id_rsa crthaze@ec2-55-55-55-55.compute-1.amazonaws.com\ncrthaze@ec2-55-55-55-55.compute-1.amazonaws.com: Permission denied (publickey).\n\nAFAICT these private keys are identical. However for some reason ssh-keygen does not fingerprint them thesame. Even though they have identical checksums.\nCould this be an issue with the M1 SoC? Or is there something much more obvious happening here?\n\nA: No, it is not an issue with the M1 SoC. There's absolutely nothing in your question that in any way suggest or hints at this being an issue with the M1 SoC. Instead try to solve this problem like you would solve it on any other CPU.\nFor example you can use the \"-v\" parameter for ssh to gain further insight into what happens. You'll probably find that there's a perfectly logical explanation to this - for example that you're using an unsupported key type, that your configuration is setup with incompatible ciphertypes, etc.\n\nA: The issue here as pointed out by @Cody was a misunderstanding with how ssh-keygen reports on figerprints. Even if you provide it with the path to a private key, with the -l flag it will use the corresponding public key file. And that's where I still had a mismatch.  Upon fixing the public key everything worked as expected.\n", "Q: M1 brute force protection, password complexity What protection does the M1 SoC have against an attacker attempting to brute force the login password of a macOS user?\nWhat password complexity should be enough to stop an attacker from brute forcing a user's login on a M1/Pro/Max-based device?\n\nA: The main protection against brute-force is that the disk encryption key, that is supposed to be unlocked by the user's password, is stored within the M1 SoC in an Secure Enclave - instead of being stored by disk. This means that you cannot remove the disk from the computer and start brute-forcing the password - instead you would have to brute-force the key, which is many orders of magnitudes harder.\nNote that the disk is encrypted and the key stored in the Secure Enclave no matter if File Vault is turned on or off.\nThe above mentioned functionality makes it possible for the M1 SoC to enforce even stronger protections against brute forcing the password. It does so by imposing delays when incorrect passwords have been attempted during the first login after a boot. The delays are according to the following scheme:\n\n\n\n\nAttempts\nDelay (minutes)\n\n\n\n\n1-14\n0\n\n\n15-17\n1\n\n\n18-20\n5\n\n\n21-26\n15\n\n\n27-30\n60\n\n\n\n\nWhen the 30 attempts have been used, it is no longer possible to keep guessing during that login session. A reboot will not help.\nThe user can boot into the macOS Recovery mode where another 10 attempts are possible. If the user has one or more FileVault recovery mechanisms enabled (i.e. iCloud recovery, a recovery key or an instituational key), it is possible to try 30 times extra for each of the enabled mechanisms - up to a maximum of 90 attempts.\nOnce those 90 attempts are used, the disk is essentially no longer accessible. The only way forward is to wipe the disk and start over with a fresh installation of macOS.\nShould an attacker somehow be able to bypass these delays, there's an additional protection from brute-forcing built in simply by the system being intentionally designed so that generating the key from the password (and thus checking if the password is correct) takes a long while (in terms of CPU time). That means that checking a password takes on the order of 80 ms. That does not sound like a lot, but it means that you can test only 12.5 passwords per second, where as a system with a simple password hash stored on disk might allow for testing millions of passwords per second.\nIn regards to your second question, this means that in order to protect yourself against brute-forcing, your password really do not have to be that complex. 90 attempts will get you nowhere if you're trying to brute-force a 4 character password of mixed upper/lower case letters and numbers.\nHowever, I do recommend using more complex passwords, as there are other threats than simply brute-forcing. For example, someone could be looking over your shoulder, and in that case a very simple password would be easier to recognize and memorize.\nIf we assume that we're dealing with a hacker that has somehow found a way to circumvent the delays imposed by the M1 chip, and we want to keep our account secured for 100 years - a simple calculation would be something like:\n12.5 combinations/sec * 100 years = 12.5 c/s * 3.155.760.000 s ~ 40 * 10^9 combinations\n\nThis means that on average an attacker would use 100 years to brute-force a password of up to 80 * 10^9 combinations.\nIf we assume your password is built of a mix of characters coming from the set of 26 lower-case letters, 26 upper-case letters, 10 numeric digits and 10 special characters - you would find that a password of at least 6 characters would have more than enough complexity (i.e. 72^6 ~ 139 * 10^9).\nNote that the above calculations are a simplified way of looking at the problem. For example, in practice your M1 Mac would probably not survive 100 years of 24/7 operation!\n", "Q: How to use terminal to visit a site and take screenshot? I am aware curl on Mac lets you visit a site from the command line.\nIs there a way to visit that site then take a screenshot and download it?\n\nA: You could use AppleScript to choose which browser you want or just consume the url directly with the open command as opposed to using curl. From there, use screencapture to dump the window to a file. Assuming the page is simple, you won’t have to build delays into the script to let items finish rendering.\n\nA: You can use the open utility to open a URL in your default browser, along with the screencapture utility to take a screenshot. You may want to use the -T <seconds> option for the latter to give the browser time to download and render.\nExample:\nopen https://duckduckgo.com && screencapture -T 10 screenshot.png\n\nYou might also want to check if your browser has a shell or Applescript API that allows capturing screenshots. You may be able get a more complete screenshot of the page with fewer extras, like the menu bar and window frame.\nNote that you may need to give your terminal app permission to record the screen.\n\nA: If you have Google Chrome, you can open it in headless mode. It also have a way to \"print\" page to pdf. Try:\n/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --headless --disable-gpu --print-to-pdf http://www.google.com/\n\nTaking full page screenshot as png is a bit more complex.

I tried restarting and that too didn't help. Would appreciate any help/advice.\nPS: I did try to connect both my Macs using this Thunderbolt cable for data transfer once, and this issue started happening almost after that. I disabled file transfer option just in case, still no luck.\n\nA: I realise this is an old question, so probably not helpful.\nBut I also ran into this problem specifically after using the same cable for Mac -> Mac migration assistant, it no longer charged from Monitor.\nThe M1 Macs do not have SMC, but the equivalent is shutting down laptop for at least 30 seconds.

On my desk I have two ASUS VS248H-P monitors where I have two HDMI switches plugged into them. On the other end of the switches is my MBP & a windoze machine (dell) for work. During the day, I normally run my right monitor (SCR2) on my MBP, left monitor (SCR1) on the dell. At the end of my day I would switch SCR1 from my dell to my MBP. Up until a couple days ago, I could flip the switches during the day, here and there, no problem, but all of sudden when I switch from the dell to the MBP on SCR1, (SCR2 has been on the MBP all day) SCR2 would dim but look like it's just hanging in space and is connected, waiting for SCR1 to pickup, and SCR1 would never look like it's making the switch. At this point I'd have to open the MBP and hold the power button down and reboot. I would then be able to work all night w/ both screens and no problems. Power is plugged in. Tried zapping PRAM.\n\nA few things to note, MBP to SCR1 switch is a Thunderbolt to HDMI cable and MBP to SCR2 switch is HDMI. I have no other issues like this and did a clean reformat and reinstall of the MacOS two weeks ago before I set this all up - this screen issue only occurs around 5p when I switch SCR1 to the MBP. Currently plugged into the MBP, aside from the HDMI and Thunderbolt, is an Anker USB 10 port hub (one mouse switch, 4 ext HDs) and another ext HD.\n\nProblem Details and System Config Report\n\n\n\n\nMachine-check capabilities: 0x0000000001000c07\n family: 6 model: 61 stepping: 4 microcode: 47\n signature: 0x306d4\n Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5287U CPU @ 2.90GHz\n 7 error-reporting banks\nProcessor 0: IA32_MCG_STATUS: 0x0000000000000005\n IA32_MC4_STATUS(0x411): 0xba00000011000402\n IA32_MC4_MISC(0x413):   0x0000000000000000\nProcessor 1: IA32_MCG_STATUS: 0x0000000000000005\n IA32_MC4_STATUS(0x411): 0xba00000011000402\n IA32_MC4_MISC(0x413):   0x0000000000000000\nProcessor 2: IA32_MCG_STATUS: 0x0000000000000005\n IA32_MC4_STATUS(0x411): 0xba00000011000402\n IA32_MC4_MISC(0x413):   0x0000000000000000\nProcessor 3: IA32_MCG_STATUS: 0x0000000000000005\n IA32_MC4_STATUS(0x411): 0xba00000011000402\n IA32_MC4_MISC(0x413):   0x0000000000000000\nmp_kdp_enter() timed-out on cpu 3, NMI-ing\nmp_kdp_enter() NMI pending on cpus: 0 1 2\nmp_kdp_enter() timed-out during locked wait after NMI;expected 4 acks but received 1 after 29882555 loops in 1450000000 ticks\npanic(cpu 3 caller 0xffffff801d5d68b7): Machine Check at 0xffffff801d4e957f, registers:\nCR0: 0x000000008001003b, CR2: 0x00007fe659018998, CR3: 0x000000002167c000, CR4: 0x00000000003626e0\nRAX: 0xffffff902f054ee4, RBX: 0xffffffd01dc35c90, RCX: 0x00000000ffffffff, RDX: 0x00000000acda7d00\nRSP: 0xffffffd0962e3980, RBP: 0xffffffd0962e3a00, RSI: 0xffffffd0962e3a10, RDI: 0xffffe1a55c83a00e\nR8:  0x0000000000000000, R9:  0x0000000000000000, R10: 0xffffffd01dadc830, R11: 0xffffff869574e540\nR12: 0xffffffd01dc35c90, R13: 0xffffff902f054ee4, R14: 0xffffffd0962e3a10, R15: 0xffffffd0962e3a10\nRFL: 0x0000000000000002, RIP: 0xffffff801d4e957f, CS:  0x0000000000000008, SS:  0x0000000000000000\nError code: 0x0000000000000000\n @trap_native.c:168\nPanicked task 0xffffff8695163670: 196 threads: pid 0: kernel_task\nBacktrace (CPU 3), panicked thread: 0xffffff869574e540, Frame : Return Address\n0xffffff801d357ac0 : 0xffffff801d485ffd \n0xffffff801d357b10 : 0xffffff801d5e6035 \n0xffffff801d357b50 : 0xffffff801d5d5803 \n0xffffff801d357ba0 : 0xffffff801d425a60 \n0xffffff801d357bc0 : 0xffffff801d4863cd \n0xffffff801d357ce0 : 0xffffff801d485b86 \n0xffffff801d357d40 : 0xffffff801dd16409 \n0xffffff801d357db0 : 0xffffff801d5d68b7 \n0xffffff801d357ec0 : 0xffffff801dd1c57c \n0xffffff801d357ed0 : 0xffffff801d4262bf \n0xffffffd0962e3a00 : 0xffffff801d4ec2e0 \n0xffffffd0962e3a90 : 0xffffff80203bd84d \n0xffffffd0962e3ab0 : 0xffffff80203c2b84 \n0xffffffd0962e3b00 : 0xffffff80203cfdd3 \n0xffffffd0962e3cd0 : 0xffffff801ed9db20 \n0xffffffd0962e3ee0 : 0xffffff801ed9d849 \n0xffffffd0962e3f20 : 0xffffff801dc574ae \n0xffffffd0962e3f60 : 0xffffff801dc56ad7 \n0xffffffd0962e3fa0 : 0xffffff801d42518e \n      Kernel Extensions in backtrace:\n         com.apple.driver.usb.AppleUSBCommon(1.0)[19E24D70-253E-347A-B633-72FC9C96A1F8]@0xffffff801ed9b000->0xffffff801ed9efff\n         com.apple.iokit.IOUSBHostFamily(1.2)[B78215CE-B379-3406-9BEF-1DA069A1FAFB]@0xffffff8020362000->0xffffff80203f3fff\n            dependency: com.apple.driver.AppleBusPowerController(1.0)[CC54EDB6-85C9-3C42-8F9F-CF9BEBB8EDEE]@0xffffff801e891000->0xffffff801e894fff\n            dependency: com.apple.driver.AppleSMC(3.1.9)[4174C698-A692-3609-94C7-453B6CEB337D]@0xffffff801ec29000->0xffffff801ec41fff\n            dependency: com.apple.driver.usb.AppleUSBCommon(1.0)[19E24D70-253E-347A-B633-72FC9C96A1F8]@0xffffff801ed9b000->0xffffff801ed9efff\n            dependency: com.apple.driver.AppleUSBHostMergeProperties(1.2)[087D9D35-1AA3-35E2-B9FE-BEE6A1D9A61C]@0xffffff8020466000->0xffffff8020466fff\n            dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOACPIFamily(1.4)[9AAF8737-B8CD-3A43-A654-69FD563A54CA]@0xffffff801fb40000->0xffffff801fb41fff\nProcess name corresponding to current thread (0xffffff869574e540): kernel_task\nMac OS version:\n21D49\nKernel version:\nDarwin Kernel Version 21.3.0: Wed Jan  5 21:37:58 PST 2022; root:xnu-8019.80.24~20/RELEASE_X86_64\nKernel UUID: 93729D02-FE6F-355B-BA76-BA930AA7103F\nKernelCache slide: 0x000000001d200000\nKernelCache base:  0xffffff801d400000\nKernel slide:      0x000000001d210000\nKernel text base:  0xffffff801d410000\n__HIB  text base: 0xffffff801d300000\nSystem model name: MacBookPro12,1 (Mac-E43C1C25D4880AD6)\nSystem shutdown begun: NO\nPanic diags file available: YES (0x0)\nHibernation exit count: 0\nSystem uptime in nanoseconds: 47455813288\nLast Sleep:           absolute           base_tsc          base_nano\nUptime  : 0x0000000b0c9663fd\nSleep   : 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000\nWake    : 0x0000000000000000 0x0000001309d1ed00 0x0000000000000000\nZone info:\nForeign   : 0xffffff8021e76000 -

I prefer to try and fix these things on my own and I'm stumped at this point. I did just send it in about a year ago to get the battery replaced.\nThanks,\nandy\n\nA: fwiw, I had a matching panic which I attributed to a marginal CPU, details here. It would manage to panic without anything attached, though.\nTL;DR: during another crash, the kernel debugger is attempting to halt other processors via an NMI IPI, and getting a time out from one particular core (cpu 3 above). Afaik, Non-Maskable-Interrupt Inter-Processor-Interrupt should never time out unless there's something wrong with the CPU.\n", "Q: Activate M1 MBP without contacting Apple servers I'd like to have an airgapped M1 macbook, with some form of backup/disk cloning in case of hardware failures. Is there a way I can completely wipe/restore an M1 MacBook Pro without an internet connection?\n\n*\n\n*disk cloning seems very hard, since several \"hidden\" partitions don't get cloned\n\n*in fact, the internal SSD seems to be an integral part of the boot process (based on the above post); it's soldered-on anyway, so if it fails, it sounds like the whole macbook needs to get replaced\n\nSo without disk cloning, I think I'm stuck with hitting Apple servers to activate the macbook after an OS/disk wipe.\n\n*\n\n*there's some existing investigation into caching the activation info for the touch bar, which might potentially still apply to M1\n\n*Apple Configurator 2 also permits IPSW restores and a DFU mode, which includes T2 (possibly M1) firmware. But that seems to need a connection to Apple servers.\n\n*some versions of T2 sound jailbreak-able, which might lead to some way to activate offline, but I don't believe M1 has the same vulnerability.\n\n\nA: If you are running an M1 Mac, the only way to use that device after a wipe is by first connecting it to the internet to Activate it.\nConceivably these are the two closest methods to achieving what you are after:\nEither wipe a Mac, DFU restore it using the latest IPSW available (this process will talk back to Apple's servers), Activate it (also talks to Apple's servers), then run through the Setup Assistant bypassing the network selection (this will not work if it is a company owned device and assigned to an Apple Business/School Manager account)\nAlternatively, purchase a brand new M1 Mac, hope it is on the desired operating system version, and then proceed through the Setup Assistant without connecting it to a network.\nFor any modern Mac, every method of upgrading or erasing/reinstalling the operating system will require at some point, connecting the device to the internet so that it can verify things with Apple's servers.\n", "Q: How to stop IOS from dimming the display I have an iOS device and the display dims despite my settings. It is either a bug or it is on purpose but I have set the display on maximum brightness. It still adjusts the brightness if I’m in a shadow or in the sun. I can see this happening.\nI have accessibility issues. Dear Apple, If this is intentional PLEASE STOP DOING THIS! Please stop dimming the display despite my turning off the auto-adjust feature.\nNow the setting is gone!?! How do I stop this?\nFYI I noticed that low power mode is also dimming the display even with auto brightness turned off. Try it yourself.\nMentioning this again 7/2022,\neven with auto brightness turned off the screen still dims based on if it’s on low power mode and also seems to be checking ambient brightness. This is really bothersome for those with accessibility including myself! I can’t get it to show at the original brightness.\nFYI Here is my test proof:\nFYI The iPad still dims the screen somewhat despite the auto brightness. If I have it at a 90 angle at the table it is a certain brightness. If I lay it flat on the table with the light above it gets much brighter. Even with the auto brightness turned off.\n\nA: The toggle you are looking for, as you mentioned yourself, is in Accessibility settings:\nSettings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Auto-Brightness\n\nA: There are three instances when iOS dims the display:\nAuto Brightness\nThis function adjusts the brightness up and down throughout the day to match your ambient brightness so that you are not looking at an incredibly bright display in a dark room, or vice versa.\nIt seems you found how to disable this, so you got rid of one instance.\nLow Power mode\nThere’s not much the iPad can do to lower the power usage and the display is one of the largest battery consumers.\nNot dimming the display would be very much equivalent to not enabling low power mode in the first place. As you guessed, the fix for this is “don’t enable low power mode”\nHigh temperature\nWhen the iPad heats up too much, it has to lower its temperature somehow, or it can overheat and stop working, it can degrade the battery very fast, etc.\nIn a passive cooled device (without a fan) like the iPad, the only way to lower the heat is to lower the power usage.\nSo iOS cuts the biggest consumers: the screen and the CPU and GPU.\nYou can’t do anything to stop this dimming from happening, but you can do things to cool down your device faster.\nUse an external fan if you have one around, or even packs of ice, or placing the iPad on a metal table to let the heat dissipate.\n\nI noticed you asked if Lunar works for iPad here. The answer is no, the iPadOS is too restrictive to allow an app to change the brightness of the system or of other apps.\n", "Q: Deleting duplicate copy of cURL command line application and point the system to only one copy of it I recently updated my copy of cURL via Homebrew, which it put in /usr/local/Cellar/curl (v7.80.0).

This requires adjusting the server's configuration (see below).\nIssue 2\nSolution 1: delete old/clashing \"server\" connection\nDeleting a connection to a previous server that provides a share with the same name (files.app -> main menu (...) -> connect to server -> (i) -> Remove) solves the issue.\nThis may be a workaround in case you don't have access to the server config although you'll only be able to access one of the \"clashing\" servers/shares at a time, which could be frustrating.\nSolution 2: ensure unique SMB share name across servers\nA better workaround is to ensure that the name of the SMB share is unique across the connections stored/remembered in your files.app.  In my case, the standard configuration of my servers was to call them smth like smbshare; attempting to access more than one server with the same share name, causes the issue, which looks like a bug in files.app IMHO (the share names should be qualified by the server name).\nHow to adjust a SMB server's config to solve both issues\nThe below procedure and example are based on Ubuntu but they should work similarly on other *NIX/*BSD derivatives (and NAS) that use Samba as the SMB server software, albeit possibly with different paths/filenames etc:\n\n*\n\n*Logon to your SMB server and run sudo -i to access root privileges.\n\n*Edit /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\n*For issue 1, you'll want to ensure server min protocol (typically found in the [global] section) is set to SMB2.\n\n*For issue 2, locate the name of the share (placed between brackets; in my example [smbshare]) and change it to smth unique.

It is used to call code in my AppleScript applet. The Service has one action: a \"Run AppleScript\" action. I update the Service quite often with improvements.\nI need a way to know that the installed version of my Service is old. One way might be to give it a \"version\".\nI have tried many ways, none of which worked. In particular, usually there is a CFShortVersionString key in an app's info.plist file. I can add that to my Service's info.plist file. But, when I open my Service in Automator.app, make some changes and then save, all my custom entries in the info.plist file are deleted.\nIs there an editor for Automator workflows that does not remove custom keys in the info.plist file ?\nThanks.\nUDATE:  Adding a variable to the workflow is a good idea.  But, I can't it working for me. Yesterday, I added the variable called \"Version\" and gave it a value \"1.21\". Today, the variable is still there but is empty. Probably because I still do not understand how it all works and I made a mess of it.\nIn the end, a separate file in the service's bundle containing just the version string is easy for me as my AppleScript applet can read it without having to parse a complicated XML file (either as plain text or using System Events).\nAlso, I still don't know how developers create workflows which DO contain version and other keys inside the info.plist file.  Automator removes those keys and so developers must be using another tool – Xcode ?\nHave also found some services that contain a \"version.plist\" file. I have Googled for hours but, can find no documentation on the \"version.plist\" file content – which seems to duplicate some keys inside info.plist. The \"version.plist\" file does not seem to be used by Finder. In an example service provided by Apple, if I delete the CFBundleShortVersionString from the info.plist file, but retain the version.plist file, Finder's Get Info shows no version.\nUPDATE 2: Apparently version.plist is used by Installer. More detail here: http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/SoftwareDistribution/Concepts/sd_pkg_version_info.html\nCan't find that detail anywhere on developer.apple.com so, it might be out-of-date/wrong.\n\nA: The Info.plist is for application settings, you are wanting to set a version for a document (workflow, script, etc).\nIn an Automator workflow package, the /Contents/document.wflow file is an XML property list that declares the various actions and their settings (such as the script for the Run AppleScript action), action connections, workflow metadata, and variables.  This property list (or parts of it) can be read into a regular AppleScript list or record.\nPossible solutions:\n\n*\n\n*A variable can be added to the workflow.  Variables can be dynamically set by the workflow, in which case they will only have values when the workflow runs, or more persistent variables can be created by right-clicking in the variable pane and editing (a couple of the built-in variables can be dragged to the pane, but would need to be edited anyway).  A script could look at the document.wflow file for the variable name in the list of variables (there will be a variables key) and get its value.\n\n\n*A comment can be added in a Run AppleScript action's script.  This works similar to adding a variable, the difference is that a script would need to search for the action in the list of actions (there will be an actions key), get the action's source script, and then look for the comment.

I am looking for an option (or something else) for the PDF viewer Skim (V1.6.8) on macOS (High Sierra):\nAfter modifying a PDF file (e.g. adding a note or highlighting a part of it) Skim enables the possibility to save (export) the PDF including the embedded notes such that no additional .skim file is produced. Invoking File > Export for the first time a panel opens where the file including the PDF notes can be saved on disk.\nUnfortunately, the suggested folder in the panel is set to the last folder used and not to the 'active' one where the PDF file is.\nDoes anybody know how to adjust the folder automatically in order to shorten the workflow? Of course, after a second export of the PDF file the folder is set to the right one.

Simply granting access to the file is not enough if you're not allowed to access one of its parent directories. This behavior is the same across all UNIXes (as far as I know).\n\nA: Permission was denied to access the Documents directory.

Since I can remember, I have been able to use the Show Desktop gesture, click and hold on a file, then reverse the Show Desktop gesture, and move the file over to a desired window, and release the trackpad, dropping the file into a desired location in a specific app.\nOn Monterey, once I begin to reveres the show desktop gesture, I am unable to move the mouse cursor while holding the click. So, if my mouse happens to be in the right place, I can slide the windows back onto the screen and drop the file. That's almost never the case.\nI do not believe this was an issue on Big Sur.

However, now that I have updated my old MacBook Pro with Monterey I have the same issue on both laptops.\nIf I use the trackpad to Show Desktop, click and hold on a file with my Magic Mouse, then hide the desktop again by gesture, I can use the mouse to continue the drag and drop operation.\nCan the old functionality be restored?\n\nA: The best solution I have come up with is to reveal desktop, \"pick up\" the item I want to drag and drop, and then ⌘-Tab to the application I want to drop it into. That reverses the reveal desktop gesture and puts all my windows back, and MacOS lets me then drag the cursor and \"picked up\" item to where I want it.\n\nA: Once you start the drag, you can press Space to restore all the windows.\nSimilarly, you can also do CommandTab while dragging, and drag the file onto the app's icon, or Tab to the app you want and drop the file onto its windows, once they come to the fore.\nAlternatively, you can use one of the many apps like Yoink, which act as a little 'shelf' to drag files onto; then you can sort out your windows, and drag the file from the shelf.\n", "Q: How do I change my username on Zoom, on my iPhone, without logging into Zoom?

What is the easiest way to recover the Photo Library without a mac? It appears they are spread all over the drive in different backup folders and I'm hoping there might be an easy way to get the photos without having to go into each backup directory.\n\nA: You will need a Mac to make sense of the database and choices made. Also, sign into iCloud photos from a modern browser and check what data if any was synced to Apple servers.\nSee about borrowing or renting one from a library or friend in the community. It is very easy to install macOS on an external drive and migrate everything back to a live album and then export the best version of the photos and avoid all the thumbnails, optimized (full resolution is in iCloud) and other photos and videos.\nCan you tell how much space is in the latest photos library folder and estimate the size of one full size photo based on which camera your friend used?

But, seemingly, nothing I can do with finder makes .Trash accessible via Terminal.\nCan anyone explain?\n\nA: Googling about how to \"give Terminal full disk access\", led me to another answer on this site, Is there command to grant Full Disk Access for specific application?\nThe wording was not obvious to me. :)\nTo repeat that other answer: under System Preferences > Security and Privacy, one of the sub-headings is Full System Access, with a list of potential parent processes that may or may not be granted this. So I added \"Terminal.app\" there (did not have to figure out how to type in a suitable format, but, rather, could choose from a list).\nTesting: this does allow me (without sudo but as user with admin privileges), to ls .Trash, remove files, etc.\nEDIT: \"problem\" solved, though I could already manipulate nearly every other file on the machine via sudo, so the recalcitrance of .Trash was one-of-a-kind (according to my expectations, anyway).\n", "Q: M1 mac: mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have 'x86_64', need 'arm64e') - python When I try to run \"scrapy startproject\" in vscode, below error comes up.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/admin/Desktop/development/project/scrapyTutorial/venv/bin/scrapy\", line 5, in <module>\n    from scrapy.cmdline import execute\n  File \"/Users/admin/Desktop/development/project/scrapyTutorial/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/scrapy/__init__.py\", line 12, in <module>\n    from scrapy.spiders import Spider\n  File \"/Users/admin/Desktop/development/project/scrapyTutorial/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/scrapy/spiders/__init__.py\", line 11, in <module>\n    from scrapy.http import Request\n  File \"/Users/admin/Desktop/development/project/scrapyTutorial/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/scrapy/http/__init__.py\", line 11, in <module>\n    from scrapy.http.request.form import FormRequest\n  File \"/Users/admin/Desktop/development/project/scrapyTutorial/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/scrapy/http/request/form.py\", line 10, in <module>\n    import lxml.html\n  File \"/Users/admin/Desktop/development/project/scrapyTutorial/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/lxml/html/__init__.py\", line 53, in <module>\n    from .. import etree\nImportError: dlopen(/Users/admin/Desktop/development/project/scrapyTutorial/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/lxml/etree.cpython-39-darwin.so, 0x0002): tried: '/Users/admin/Desktop/development/project/scrapyTutorial/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/lxml/etree.cpython-39-darwin.so' (mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have 'x86_64', need 'arm64e')), '/usr/local/lib/etree.cpython-39-darwin.so' (no such file), '/usr/lib/etree.cpython-39-darwin.so' (no such file)\n\nAnd then I figure out that, the \"mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have 'x86_64', need 'arm64e')\"is the main promblem.

I think by default it looks for prebuilt wheels and if it can't find one it builds the extension locally from source. This is no problem for pure python modules. However if the wheel should contain C code that has to be compiled then I think pypi has a large bug here in that it just looks for macos wheels and does not check the CPU architecture.\nThe error you have is that lxml has been built as an Intel binary. Looking at the downloads for lxml at pypi there are no wheels for Apple arm CPUs.\nSo if not conda miniforge you need to compile lxml yourself or force pip to do the build locally. pypi documentation suggests\n\nYou can override pip`s default behavior by e.g. using its –no-binary option.\n\nI would also note that Macports provides arm versions of python and lxml and possibly scrapy\n\nA: What it worked for me was:\npip uninstall lxml\nARCHFLAGS=\"-arch arm64\" pip install lxml --compile --no-cache-dir\n\n\nA: I've faced with the same issue (and created this ticket with details of my research). But it ended with removing the installed package:\npip uninstall lxml\n\n... and installing it building from sources:\npip install --no-binary lxml lxml \n\nNote the useful recommendation about platform specifics (for MacOS, for example).\n\nA: This is a case of some python libraries not being compiled for M1 Apple Silicon CPUs, but only for Intel.\nTry running VSCode in Rosetta.\n\nA: I got this when running an npm command that used compiled C packages.

More importantly, Big Sur is not compatible with your Mac, though there are ways in which it can be installed.\nIn more recent versions of MacOS, the OS is installed on a separate disk volume from the 'apps and data'.

I need to know if I can charge my MacBook Air M1 using an other more powerful charger.\nMy phone charger is a Realme Super Dart 10 volt 6.5 ampere (65 watt) charger. I think it is adaptable to the device. I also charge another phone which needs 30 watt and it works fine.

I currently have to do this indirectly via a WiFi access point where speeds obviously vary greatly and 100Mbit/s is the max speed you can realistically get (often lower). WiFi-direct should allow for much more stable speeds at up to 250Mb/s (maybe even higher).

High sierra is on the SSD while windows and Ubuntu share another drive.\n\nWould like to set an icon for each operation system. I have followed some guides on here but not getting through. For Ubuntu...it shows up as a EFI BOOT. I did remember that upon installation of Ubuntu...I have placed the bootloader in Dev/sd1...same location as the EFI volume for windows. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.\n\n\nA: I can not precisely determine how your Mac is configured. Here is what you are claiming:\n\n*\n\n*You have two HDDs, one SSD and apparently a fourth drive on some kind.\n\n*High Sierra is installed on the SSD.\n\n*Both Windows and Ubuntu are installed on the drive of a kind yet to be revealed.\n\n*Apparently both Windows and Ubuntu are installed to UEFI boot from the same drive even though the drive is using a MBR partition map. This is a rather unusual configuration.\n\n*You have followed some guides of unknown origin. Specifying the guides might provide some useful information.\n\n*I do not think Dev/sd1 actually exists.\n\nSo instead of offering a specific answer to your question, I will instead provide some general information regarding how to customize the Mac Startup Manager icons. First, the same name is used for each icon file. This name is .VolumeIcon.icns. Each icon file is stored in the root directory of the volume that contains the boot file. If two or more operating systems share the same volume  for their boot file, then they share the same icon. When macOS is installed in an APFS container, the macOS boots from the Preboot volume. In the case of a UEFI booting Windows or Ubuntu, this would normally be FAT32 volume stored in a EFI partition. If an operating system BIOS boots, then the icon can not be customized.\nTo create a custom icns file, see this answer.\n", "Q: Have Music use files stored in iCloud without Apple Music How can I have the macOS Music app use my own imported music (without using an Apple Music subscription) while still having the music files backed up to iCloud?\n\nA: *\n\n*Close Music.\n\n\n*Move your local music files to iCloud.

Can you make sure the About This Mac and System Information panes all show the 500 capacity?\n\n\nAs you can see in the NVME storage image, the system knows the serial number of the attached storage, so you could call Apple to validate you still have the drive that was installed from the factory if you somehow think you purchased one with 512 storage instead of 256.\n", "Q: MacPorts: What does \"Port Health\" mean? I have an old Mac (El Capitan) and MacPorts was suggested in other post in this same network to accomplish some updates for some tools/software. I've already watched some videos about how to install and basic commands.\nJust to prior to install into the OS - I did realise for example that for MySQL 8 exists in its official home page the version 8.0.28 and in MacPorts 8.0.27 as follows:\n\n*\n\n*mysql8\n\n*mysql8-server\nFor each link, in the right part, exists the Port Health section, and some OSX versions has green and other red colors.\n\n*\n\n*What does Port Health mean?\n\nI am with the assumption - correct me if I am wrong - that does not exist MySQL 8.0.27 available  for El Capitan (because it is in red).\n\nA: Port Health is a report on what the buildbots have built.\nbuildbots are the machines that Macports runs and build binaries from the port files so that you can download the binaries rather than have to compile the source yourself\nThe web page shows a tick or cross whether the build worked or not. There are entries with a question mark ?. These are where no build has been attempted yet. This is most obvious with Ventura, as of 29/11/02 there is no arm builder for this but there is a recent x86_64 builder, go ? for all arm builds and older Intel builds but later have a tick or cross. ? also shows up for some Leopard cases.\nSo in this case it tells you that the build worked for all macOS/OSX from High Sierra onwards.\nThe links from each OS name go to the fuller report that the buildbots make, however these logs are deleted after a time and so as the mysql8 portfiles and source have not changed recently then they have been deleted. The builds were made in October/November last year from here\nThe red mark for El Capitan says that the buildbots could not build it. Unfortunately as no recent change there is no log to show why. I would try to install it, as there is no binary macports will try to build it and your local logs will show what the issue is.

Clicking on “visit this website” in the Safari TLS security alert stores an exception for that host in the Safari preferences. Apparently, this exception is not removed\n\n*\n\n*by a restart of Safari,\n\n*by Safari -> Preferences -> Privacy -> Manage Website Data…-> Remove All,\n\n*by restarting the computer,\n\n*after some time.\n\nHowever, the exception entry can be removed from the preferences file, for example with the PlistBuddy tool from the command line.\nThe full path to the Safari preferences file is\n\n/Users/<userName>/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist\n\nThe preference key is “allowedLegacyTLSHosts” and the value is a dictionary, mapping host names to dates.\nFirst open a Terminal window, make sure that the current working directory is the home directory, and call PlistBuddy with the \"Print\" command:\n\n% cd \n% /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist -c \"Print :allowedLegacyTLSHosts:\"\nDict {\n    unsafe.host.net = Fri Feb 11 21:06:06 CET 2022\n}\n\nTo remove the exception for “unsafe.host.net”, quit Safari and call PlistBuddy with the \"Delete\" command:\n\n% cd \n% /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist -c \"Delete :allowedLegacyTLSHosts:unsafe.host.net\"\n\nCheck that the entry has been removed:\n\n% cd \n% /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist -c \"Print :allowedLegacyTLSHosts:\"\nDict {\n}\n\nNow opening that page in Safari produces the “This Connection Is Not Private” alert again.\nRemarks:\n\n*\n\n*I had updated my computer to macOS Monterey (12.2.1) in the meantime, therefore I do not know if this approach works in previous releases.\n\n\n*Other/simpler solutions, perhaps without the need to execute complicated commands in the Terminal, are still welcome.\n", "Q: Is it possible to move MacOS TMPDIR to another drive? Some programs write to the macOS TMPDIR that is on the booth volume, but unfortunately, some write huge files on it (for scratch disk, Lightroom for example) and this depletes the available space, but more importantly the remaining HD space on the boot volumes (especially nowadays with Apple's soldered SSDs) the remaining pace is not enough for the scratch disk and it fails. I experience it a lot with Lightroom doing Panorama,s temp files can be hundred of Gigagbytes. Unfortunately, you can't set the scratch disk location, contrary to photoshop. It writes to the TMPDIR.\nSo I would like to move that TMPDIR to another external SSD. I tried the symbolic link but unfortunately, I don't have the permission to overwrite or rename the current temporary folder.\nMaybe there's a way to change the way the TMPDIR is create so it does it on another drive than the boot drive, or maybe I could get the permission to modify the current one.\nThanks.\nGiven the fact that lots of program used that location that is often too small, it would be a major boon to get a method to put that TMPDIR on another drive.\nI tried Export TMPDIR, but LR still uses the root volume one\nThanks\nMacOS big sur, Latest Lightroom Classic 11.2\n\nA: I don’t think you’ll have good luck mapping any sort of TMP as multiple idioms exist (unix and posix temp and mktemp are different locations than Library Application Support sandboxes and caches). Furthermore, privacy concerns change these paths regularly so that scripts that attempt to access temporary files need to check in multiple locations. Unless you have a very narrow range of programs to wrangle, the general solution might be to put these in containers or VM and have that storage where you desire.\n\n*\n\n*Contact the vendor and ask if their software can be configured for dumping files on the external. This is almost always an intentional design, not that they read an env type variable, but that you explicitly add a “scratch disk” of your choosing. Apple does this with Sharing Preference pane - you can select an external disk for content caching. Photoshop used to do that with “scratch disk” election.\n\n*Move other large files to the external - good candidates are the media in your Music / iTunes library, video files for iMovie and Final Cut Pro, Photos database.\n\n*Move your whole user home folder to an external drive - these files almost always are far less sensitive to a slower storage than the fastest NVMExpress SSD storage.\n\nWith respect to item 1 - There is an optimize performance article that may help if you can choose\n\n*\n\n*https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/kb/optimize-performance-lightroom.html\n\nTo further speed the cache, keep it on a fast hard disk.

You've to be quick as the OS recreates T quickly.\nOf course, Lightroom must be quit before doing that. But it works.\nIt works, but of course, you've to disable SIP which is a pain. Also, after that photoshop doesn't work anymore, other programs mays fail also.\nNow, the real solution would be to tell mac os to create the temp folder to and external drive. But that's another topic. I feel it has to to with the mktemp command, If we could ask it to use and external drive it would be the perfect solution.\nSo the solution was to disable SIP, and then you can move the TMPDIR with a symbolic link.\n", "Q: The screen resolution on macOS across different models I've been using a mbp 15\" mid 2015 model since that time, which still performs ok for my needs.\nLast year I got a mbp 16\" model which is a bit faster, the keyboard is a bit different and there is that Touch Bar which I won't say I prefer (at least ESC key is back).\nI use both laptops and I'm starting to develop an opinion about the screen resolution. In the 16\" model it seems things look a bit smaller perhaps because pixel wise it has more screen space.\nI might prefer things as they look on my old 15\" mbp.

You would be hard pressed to see the difference in size of graphics and texts with the Retina resolution or with corresponding scaled resolutions.\nThe MBP 14\" and 16\" 2021 (with M1 Pro or Max SoC) both have 254 ppi with a Retina resolutions of 3024x1964 and 3456x2234 respectively.  The default resolutions are 1523x982 and 1728x1117 and at those resolutions graphics and text will look a bigger than what you are using now.\nBut both offer scaled resolutions.

Or, the files are in the wrong location. These files are included in the Windows Support Software that can be downloaded using the Boot Camp Assistant. To insure the correct Windows Support Software for your Mac is downloaded, the Boot Camp Assistant should be executed on the Mac where Windows is to be installed. Although the OP is installing Windows 10, the placement of the Windows Support Software is described in step 11 of section \"Follow these steps if you downloaded version 5 of Windows Support Software\" in the Apple article \"Install Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp\". Note the following.\n\n*\n\n*Although the article is for Windows 7, the step also applies to any version of Windows newer than Windows 7.\n\n\n*The version of the Windows Support Software for the Mac is undoubtedly newer than version 5.\n\n\n*The AutoUnattend.xml will probably be missing from the Windows Support Software. For most (in not all) newer Intel Macs, this file is automatically generated by the Boot Camp Assistant and therefore will be unavailable since the OP has stated this part of the installation has failed.

If they do, and you’re in their Contacts, they need to have your Apple ID's email address or mobile number in your contact card for AirDrop to work.\n\n*If you're not in their Contacts, have them set their AirDrop receiving setting to Everyone in order to receive the file.\n\n", "Q: Virtualbox on bootcamp, where is the Host key? I installed VB on top of Windows, in Boot Camp.\nVirtual box has the concept of a Host key, which varies from one OS to another. It could i.e. be the Right Control key.\nIn this context they say to i.e. go Fullscreen your press Host+F.\nThe Host Key should be shown in the Task Bar of the VM, here it shows Right Control. However there is no Right Control on mac keyboard.\nI installed virtual box in bootcamp. So, where is the Host key?\nAlready tried command+F but it doesn't seem to work.\n\nA: The Host key for VirtualBox in MacOS is the Left Command\n", "Q: Prevent non-admin accounts editing DNS records Is it possible to prevent any non-admin users in MacOS Monterey from being able to change DNS in System Preferences?\nI know that the user is required to enter admin login details when they attempt it, but I'd prefer it if these settings could only be changed when actually logged in to an admin user account.\n\nA: Any restriction you add as an admin can be removed as an admin. You will need to ensure regular users never know the name and password for an admin user in this case.\n", "Q: How can I input the sound of an audio file into my microphone? Is there a way (or app) to input an audio file (for example a recording of my voice) into my microphone?\n\nA: Yes, there is a way. You will have to get iShowU Audio Capture, Loopback, and an audio player. In Loopback you will select your audio player as a source, and then going past the output channels you will select iShowU Audio Capture as a Monitor device. This means that the audio from your audio player will get routed to the iShowU Audio Capture virtual driver. Now you can select iShowU Audio Capture as an input device (like a microphone) in your system's Audio Settings, and it will output the sound from the audio player.\n", "Q: what is the correct international mobile phone number format for UK-based iphones A while back my iPhone would not dial mobile phone numbers correctly.  The problem seemed to be that the '07' at the start of the UK mobile code was identified by the phone as being a country code.  At the time this problem was solved by adding '+44' to mobile numbers in my address book which created this format (which worked).\n\n+44 (0) 7xxx xxx xxx\n\nFast forward to today and I am having trouble again with mobile numbers.  And the solution seems to be to keep the country code (+44) but remove the zero that begins the mobile number:\n\n+44 7xxx xxx xxx\n\nI have tried to find confirmation of this and failed.  Can someone explain the rules for storing phone numbers on my iPhone (iOS 15.2.1).\nAlso, are the formatting rules the same for landline numbers?\n\nA: Yes to both.\nDrop the leading 0 and put 0044 in front or +44\nHave landline and family with +44 and the number with the leading 0 dropped.\nAbout 70 different numbers but not showing any.\nLots of sites show that info, this is but one:\nenter link description here\n", "Q: Make the Touch Bar less fancy I got a mbp with Touch Bar and now I'm sure I don't like it. What can I do to make it look and behave less like a Touch Bar? Is it possible to make it hold just two sets of buttons, the function keys and the volume keys (and other keys we use to have when pressing fn)?\nHere it looks like every time I switch apps the Touch Bar will show something different. I just want volume up/down and screen brightness up/down there all the time at one click distance. Is this still possible?\nTo access volume I have to 1st press the volume slider to get access to up/down buttons. I would like to volume up/down in just one click.\n\nA: In System Preferences > Keyboard, set \"Touch Bar shows\" to \"Expanded Control Strip\"\n\nA: To access the volume or brightness in just 1 tap, just press on the desired icon and start sliding your finger left or right without raising your finger.\nI run my computer with the brightness slider, volume slider, mute, and quick actions. I see them in all of the apps that I'm in at all times. You'll find those default settings in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Customize Touch Bar..\n", "Q: Error 4041 during iPad factory reset I have an iPad that is having issues during a factory reset. I start the process by plugging it into my Mac while the iPad is powering up so that it enters Recovery mode.\nOnce in Recovery Mode, I see a prompt that says 'There is a problem with the iPad \"iPad\" that requires it to be updated or restored'. I click \"Update\" and after some time, I get another prompt that says 'If your iPad can't be updated, you will need to restore it to its factory settings'. I click \"Update\" again, after which Finder says the update is being downloaded.\nAbout two minutes later, I see an error dialog box with the text 'The iPad \"iPad\" could not be updated. An unknown error occurred (4041)'.\nSee the bottom of my question for screenshots.\nI would like to note some context: my friend works for [large-tech-company] and was lent this device for their work. The device has no access to corporate resources (no MDM installed, only iCloud AFAIK). I asked said friend if I could borrow the device to try it out; they said yes but also that they forgot their password. Hence, I tried using a factory reset.\nHow can I fix this? I can't get it back to a working state. I am hesitant to bring this to an Apple store as they may report the device as stolen to [large-tech-company], which could cause me more trouble than if I just explained it to my friend. I don't see any option other than explaining to my friend that I broke their device and that they need to explain this to their employer.\nI feel really dumb for thinking a factory reset would have worked, surely [large-tech-company] has a deal with Apple to ship a custom OS for employees (my friend opened the iPad from its box which is why I thought there wasn't an issue with factory reset). I also realize that there is nothing in my story that differentiates me from someone who has stolen a company device and is trying to restore it to prepare it to be sold. So if you don't feel comfortable helping, then I understand.\nTechnical notes:\n\n*\n\n*My Mac is running macOS 12.2.1.\n\n*I used two different USB-C cables, with the same result.\n\n*Clicking \"Restore\" instead of \"Update\" causes the same issue.\n\n*After I get the 4041 error, Finder is no longer able to try the update again (it just gets stuck at a loading page). Killing the process doesn't help; the only way to retry the whole process is to restart my Mac.\n\nScreenshots:\n\n\n\n\nA: Had the same error message while trying to do factory reset on an iPad, third (!) cable I tried finally worked.\n\nA: I have the same problem and tried three different cables. The last one worked for a while but I got stuck on loading. I managed to proceed with the update later but it failed again.\nIn the end, it looks like it was more related to a loose connection in the iPad's port as it helped me to hold the iPad in the air so nothing was pushing the lightning connector up (in the opposite of the situation when the iPad is laying on the flat surface as the lightning connector is thicker than the iPad)\n\nA: Use a type-A to lighting cable\nExactly the same error and resolved finally, after many many retries.\nApple had cut off USB type-A long time ago. So I use a type-c to lighting cable naturally.\nAfter countless failures & retries, I realized this cable is actually my iphone cable, my ipad is pretty old it sells with a type-A cable.\nUse a type-A cable and an type-c/type-a converter, problem solved.\nHope this can help you too.\n", "Q: Erase iPhone 7 without service The wifi on my child's iPhone 7 stopped working, so we got an iPhone SE to replace it. Now we want to erase the old phone, but we cannot turn off \"Find My\" because there is no apparent way to connect to an Apple server: no phone service because that's been transferred to the new phone, no wifi because wifi is broken on this phone. I can connect it directly to a Mac desktop, but the \"Restore\" option refuses to work without first disabling \"Find My\". We can try to disable \"Find My\" by going directly to iCloud.com/find, but of course the old phone doesn't know about this because it can't connect to anything.\nSo what do we do?\nMaybe temporarily restore phone service to the old phone? How do we do that? Any other options?\n\nA: A simple way to solve this would be to temporarily remove the SIM-card from the new phone and insert it into the old phone for as long as it takes to disable \"Find My\".\nIf this is not possible, for example due to using an eSIM, you can also use a Mac to share the computer's internet connection with the phone over USB. Connect the phone with the Mac using a standard USB to Lightning cable, and then on the Mac, use System Prefences > Sharing to enable Internet Sharing. In the \"To computers using\" list ensure that there is a checkmark for \"iPhone USB\".\n", "Q: Why are some videos appearing to make my screen extremely bright I'm browsing some videos, and I find that on some videos they appear to be extremely bright; even hurting my eyes a little. It doesn't happen with all videos, but a select few. They seem to bypass my macbook's current brightness level and sets it's own brightness to the max.\nWhy exactly are some of these videos blinding? is it a bug? and how do I prevent it prior to Apple fixing it?\nIt appears when I screenshot it, the image appears that only the video has been deep-fried or oversaturated, or just too bright. It's more noticeable on some videos than others when you compare the image to yourself directly looking at the screen with the video.\nVideo in question...\n\nA: You could be experiencing this only for videos that are recorded as High Dynamic Range (HDR).\nIf that type of video is played back with the normal brightness setting, they would seem darker or more subdued in colors than intended. The only way to get proper (or at least as good as possible) playback of those videos is to increase the brightness to max for that video.\nYou see something similar on iPhones where the display is suddenly much brighter when playing back HDR10 content.\n\nA: I found the solution. Right click desktop>display settings>scroll down and turn off \"use HDR\"\n", "Q: Why is my Catalina installation throwing up errors about SecurityAgent / login keychain overnight, and showing a grey lock screen? This is a slightly difficult issue to describe precisely but I'll do my best. About six weeks ago, my installation of Catalina (10.15.7, MacBook Pro 13\" 2020 / MacBookPro16,2) started to exhibit some strange behaviour when left running overnight (or possibly: when left running unattended for several hours).\nSometimes, but by no means every day, I'll return to the machine in the morning and wake the screen to see a grey lock screen (no background image) and a prompt that will often only accept my password (i.e. not Touch ID). Upon unlocking the machine I'll see a series of errors and password prompts, which seem to be stuck in a loop (or maybe there are just enough of them queued up that it seems like a loop). These messages include:\nUnapproved caller. SecurityAgent may only be invoked by Apple software\n---\nUnrecoverable error. SecurityAgent was unable to create requested mechanism builtin:unlock-keychain.\n---\naccountsd wants to use the “login” keychain. Please enter the keychain password.\n---\ncallservicesd wants to use the “login” keychain. Please enter the keychain password.\n---\nidentityservicesd wants to use the “login” keychain.

Please enter the keychain password.\n---\nCommCenter wants to use the “login” keychain. Please enter the keychain password.\n\nThe system will give the appearance of being usable but isn't really. Symptoms include:\n\n*\n\n*Finder and Dock repeatedly restarting\n\n*Generally unable to interact with menubar, e.g. to shut down\n\n*Inconsistent ability to tab between apps and interact with or quit them\n\n*Unable to start new apps from Dock or menubar shortcuts (icons just bounce for a while)\n\nSo far I have never been able to cleanly shut down the machine in this state and have had to power it off using the Touch ID / power button.\nWhen booting back up, everything seems fine except sometimes Touch ID preferences have been reset (i.e. I have to enrol my finger again) and on one occasion my saved Bluetooth devices, except for mouse and keyboard, were deleted. For what it's worth, it does seem that if I \"catch\" the problem quickly enough, e.g. returning to the machine late at night, the damage is more limited and Touch ID is not always reset, however the other issues remain. I have also tried putting the machine into standby overnight by closing the lid, rather than leaving it running, but at least once the issue has still occurred (presumably the machine is waking up at some point overnight to do something).\nI'm a bit stumped as to how to diagnose this. My hunch is that it's something to do with the system somehow losing access to Keychain – based on mentions in the error messages above. I did have iCloud Keychain enabled previously, but disabled it a couple of weeks ago, and the issue has happened at least once since then.\nAn answer to another question mentions Keychain permissions – these are mine, in case they're relevant:\n# /Library/Keychains:\n0 drwxr-xr-x   9 root  wheel             288B  9 Feb 08:07 Keychains\n\n# /Library/Keychains/System.keychain\n248 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   120K  7 Jan 13:16 /Library/Keychains/System.keychain\n\n# ~/Library/Keychains/ [with redactions]\ntotal 928\n  0 drwx--x--x   7 james  staff   224B 14 Feb 10:07 .\n  0 drwx------@ 85 james  staff   2.7K 10 Feb 12:22 ..\n  0 -r--r--r--   1 james  staff     0B  7 Dec  2020 .XXXXXXXXXX\n  0 -r--------   1 james  staff     0B  7 Dec  2020 .XXXXXXXXXX\n  0 drwx------  11 james  staff   352B 14 Feb 09:06 XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n880 -rw-r--r--@  1 james  staff   439K 14 Feb 10:07 login.keychain-db\n 48 -rw-------   1 james  staff    23K 14 Feb 09:41 metadata.keychain-db\n\nAny light that anyone might be able to shed on this would be much appreciated!

Every few days. On research, it has been reported since 2014. In her case, the gray popup repeats after dismissal. Using RETURN to dismiss it continuously, it eventually goes away, but the system locks up, the finder crashes, and Apple Mail is locked up as well. After reboot, going into System Preferences->Apple ID, with the yellow triangle (she only has one apple ID), clicking on the triangle gives the dialogue to re-login to the apple ID. After logging in the triangle was removed. This overlapped with our credit card on file with apple needing to have the corrected date and CVV after getting a new one.\n", "Q: How do I hide an application by clicking the dock icon? Is it possible to configure the dock in such a way that a non-visible application becomes visible when the dock icon is clicked the first time and becomes invisible again when the dock icon is clicked a second time? I'm aware that with a long press and choosing Hide I can achieve what I want with just one click.\n\nA: Opt/click on switching to another app will hide the one you're backgrounding.\nYou can also do this by Opt/clicking any visible window of your new app.\n\nA: You can use DockAltTab or Dock Exposé for this. Plus then you also get window previews when hovering over dock icons.

For macOS (High Sierra) Inkscape can be installed via MacPorts with two options: +Quartz or +X11. What is the difference? Which version is (more) recommended?\n\nA: The difference is what windowing system and graphical layer the program that is being built to use.\nX11 is the X Window System that is used on most Unix and Unix like systems (e.g. most Linux(there is now Wayland) and non Apple/NeXT)\nQuartz is a slightly ill defined term that covers much of the graphics and display functions of macOS.\nIn general the Quartz option will provide a program that looks and feels more like other macOS programs whilst X11 will look and feel like how it would run on other Unix computers. The look and feel includes where menus are placed, mouse click behaviour, cut and paste.\nIn Macports you must choose one or the other for all your ports.\nIn my opinion use +Quartz unless you know exactly why you want to use +X11 (I think this is the default)\n", "Q: How to get a notification once a MacPort ticket is changed? Recently, I had troubles with a MacPort installation (port failed to build).\nSearching on trac.macports.org I found a ticket number #xxxxx which exactly described my problem.\nIs it possible to receive a notification (e.g. via email) as soon as a change or solution of the ticket has been reported? If yes how can I establish this notification?\n\nA: Yes, if you have a GitHub account (you can create one for free on their web site) you can login on the Trac page. When you're logged in, you can click the small \"Cc me!\" button to be advised.\n\nA: You need to do two things\n\n*\n\n*Login to trac and goto Preferences and make sure you have your email address in there.\n\n\n*Go to the ticket you are interested in.

I only ever use this laptop connected to this screen, but I take it off every day after work. I also use Yabai, a tiling window manager for macOS.\nEvery time I disconnect and reconnect the HDMI cable, windows move around and get rearranged as workspaces appear and disappear. I then have to manually put all the windows back on the right workspaces and in the right organization. I have to do this for about 20 windows, every day. This is very annoying.\nI would like to make it so macOS always thinks that my screen is connected, regardless of whether the HDMI cable is plugged in the dongle, so nothing changes when I take it off or on (I wouldn't have access to my off-screen windows when the screen isn't connected, but that's fine). Is that possible somehow?\n\nA: Yes. You will want a professional grade, powered EDID emulator to correctly handle all cases across sleep / wake / restart.\n\n*\n\n*https://connectpro.com/video-solutions/ddc-emulators/\nIf you don’t need that level of detail, a simple non-powered passive ghost adapter can work very well and if you buy three for $8 to $12 you will have spares if one fails or arrives DOA. Search for HDMI dummy plugs and be sure you understand return policies / buy from someone you trust.\nFor your specific case an active EDID pass through might bring you stability, but I think automating your setup with a tool like moom or divvy might work better if you can’t script your chosen window manager.\n", "Q: Rename macOS Monterey disk in Startup Manager I clean installed macOS Monterey from a flash drive. I believe that at the time, the volume it was installed to was labeled Untitled. In any case, Startup Manager (reached from holding Option (⌥) at boot) now shows the Mac disk as \"Untitled\".\nAfter the install, I used Disk Utility to set the standard names, \"Macintosh HD\" for the volume group and \"Macintosh HD - Data\" for the data volume, but Startup Manager still shows \"Untitled\". How do I rename the label in Startup Manager to the standard \"Macintosh HD\"?\n(I also have a Boot Camp disk with the standard label BOOTCAMP, which is fine.)\nI'm aware of the bless command, but I don't know what volume to specify, whether I issue it from a normal terminal or a Recovery Mode terminal, and if I have to temporarily turn off any protections.\n\nA: The Mac Startup Manager is stored in the firmware on the logic broad. The Mac Startup Manager reads the label to display from the same folder that the boot file is located. In the case of macOS, the boot file is named boot.efi and is located in the APFS volume named Preboot by default. Under macOS Monterey, this volume is protected by SIP. The label is stored as an image in the files name .disk_label and .disk_label_2x The file chosen by the firmware depends on the resolution of the display. Both files can be created by the bless command. A third file named .disk_label.contentDetails contains a text copy of the label. This file is not created by the bless command and is not used by the firmware.\nBelow is one possible procedure which can be use to change these files.\n\n*\n\n*Restart to macOS Recovery, open a Terminal application window and enter the following command to disable SIP.\ncsrutil disable\n\n\n\n*Restart to macOS Monterey, open a Terminal application window and enter the following commands. These commands will change the Mac Startup Manager label for macOS Monterey to Macintosh HD .\nGROUP=\"$(diskutil info / | grep \"APFS Volume Group\")\"\nUUID=\"${GROUP##* }\"\ncd /System/Volumes/Preboot/$UUID/System/Library/CoreServices/\nsudo bless --folder . --label \"Macintosh HD\"\nprintf \"Macintosh HD\" | sudo tee .disk_label.contentDetails; echo\nsudo chgrp wheel .disk*\ncd ~\n\n\n\n*Enter the following command to clear the SIP configuration.\nsudo csrutil clear\n\n\n\n*Restart macOS Monterey. Upon restart, SIP will be enabled.\n\nA: Why not simply rename the disks via disk utility? Boot into recovery mode or an OS, then navigate to disk utility. There, you will see a cluster of volumes:\n\nClick on the first one with the VOLUME tag (in your case, it will be called Untitled)\nYou should see a screen something like this:\n\nClick on the bolded name (top left, right of the icon).

However, now and then, I use the Voice Memos app or another app that requires a microphone. I only use those apps for a minute or so, then go back to listening to music through the headphones.\nThe headphones have a mic, but I prefer to use the iPhone's mic with those apps. However, while the headphones are paired with the iPhone, the apps default to the mic on the headphones. Therefore, whenever I use those apps I disconnect the headphones (by turning Bluetooth off), then I connect them again after I'm done using the microphone.\nIs there a more practical way to do this?\nIs it possible to automatically shift to the iPhone's mic instead of the headphones' mic for selected apps?\n\nA: I do not believe that there's any generic way to switch microphone inputs on iOS (except for the way you're doing it right now by disconnecting the Bluetooth device entirely).\nThe developers of an app can choose to provide the user with controls for choosing inputs. This is typically found in audio specific apps that do multi-routing - such as for example GarageBand or similar app. Developers can use the Apple provided AVAudioSession API to list available inputs, find the one with type builtInMic and then set it as the preferred input for that app. This is only possible to do for the app developer - it cannot be added on later by the user.\n", "Q: Why do I have different display resolution options for two different 27\" 4K Dell monitors? I'm on an M1 Mac mini and have two displays plugged in, one via a TB/USB-C cable and the other via HDMI.\nI want to match them for resolution of menus and palettes at the fourth (of five) resolutions but the intermediate resolutions macOS is offering me are different for each monitor… even thought they are bth native 4K displays (see table for details).\nWhat can I do to change the intermediate display options? Is this associated with the cables at all?\n\n\n\nEDIT TO show display preferences when \"Option\" key is help clicking \"Scaled\":\n\n\nA: Have you updated the firmware of the monitors? Sometimes there are updates.\n\nWhile adequate for the majority of users, these five resolution choices (default and scaled) are missing several “in-between” display options, as well as “low resolution” modes, such as a true 2560×1440 that must be upscaled by the monitor and may be necessary for testing or software compatibility purposes. Thankfully, these resolutions are still accessible, and here’s how to access them.\nPress and hold the Option key on your keyboard, and then click the “Scaled” option again. (Source)\n\nHave you tried keeping the Default resolution for both monitors and changing the resolution of the individual applications?\nFinder resolution for instance can be changed by going to the Home folder > right-click > Show View Options and then changing the icon/text size to your preference. Changing the settings at the Home folder will change all subfolder view options.\n", "Q: How do I force IPv4 or IPv6 for a Wi-Fi network on iOS 15? I need to use a sofware that only supports IPv4 on iOS 15, but my ISP provides IPv6 addresses by default.\nHow do I force my iOS device to use IPv4 only on a certain Wi-Fi network, or the other way around (force IPv6)?\n\nA: When an iOS device connects to a WiFi-network, it will by default request both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If you only see an IPv6 in the settings, it is because your ISP only gives out IPv6 addresses.\nIf you want to use IPv4 on that WiFi-network, you will need to either get your ISP to change their settings to enable IPv4, or use a VPN service that you can connect to over IPv6 that gives you a virtual IPv4 interface.\nIt is not possible to disable IPv6 for a specific WiFi-network or for WiFi-networks in general on iOS. Similarly you cannot \"force\" IPv6.\n", "Q: macOS Monterey - How do I temporarily disable a profile? I need to temporarily disable a profile shown in the picture below, i.e. I don't want to remove it and then add it again.\n\nCan I do that?\n\nA: No, there's no built-in way to \"pause\" a profile. You can remove the profile now, and then later add the same profile back.\n", "Q: Trouble connecting MacBook Air to Dell monitor I'm trying to connect a Dell 2208WFPT Flat Monitor to my MacBook Air (macOS Mojave, 10.14.6) using Thunderbolt.

However, when I bring new devices online, my message history is still synced to those devices.\nHow can I prevent this, and how long are messages retained by the server? Is there any documentation on how long Apple retains messages so that my message history isn’t pulled down to all of my devices?\nE.g. I brought a laptop online that had been turned off for a month, and hundreds of iMessages were synced to the computer despite iMessage for iCloud being off on all of my devices.\n\nA: Apple keeps messages for up to 30 days when it is unable to deliver them before discarding them. If the device is turned on before this timer elapses, then all messages are delivered.\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/security/how-imessage-sends-and-receives-messages-sec70e68c949/web\nEnabling Messages in iCloud allows any of your devices to store messages in iCloud. This means that so long as you have a device that's received the iMessage, all your devices will see it when turned on, no matter how long it's been. Messages in iCloud purely affects the post-delivery experience.\nNew devices that have never been on your iMessage before can only get message history when Messages in iCloud is enabled. If they were not previously registered, no undelivered messages exist for them when powered on.\nIf you were to go back you would find a gap between the oldest message before you turned your device off and the most recent ones that just appeared.\n\nA: On your settings go to your contact settings and change your default account to on this iPhone thank me later\n", "Q: Can Apple Silicon-based Mac boot from *unauthorized* external drive? Can one boot M1 MacBook from a unauthorized bootable external drive: i.e. the external drive that was prepared on some other Mac, and the user not having admin password of the MacBook he is trying to boot into?\nCase in question: suppose my Mac (2021 Pro) is lost or stolen; its internal drive is FileVault-encrypted; MacBook is kept offline and is not aware that \"Lost Mode\" is activated for it; still someone tries to use it with his own external drive that I never authorized to boot from on my MacBook.\n\nA: I reached out to Howard Oakley, author of EclecticLight blog which goes quite deep into Mac security.\nTLDR of his answer: booting from external drive is only possible if that drive was previously authorized using login and password of Mac's internal-drive admin.\nFull answer below:\n\nThis is straightforward.\nYou can't boot an M1 Mac from an external disk without it having a LocalPolicy on its internal storage. So the only way to try that would be to boot in Recovery, there select the external disk, and try to boot  from it.\nRecovery won't let you do that without giving it a LocalPolicy, which then prompts you to enter the username and password of someone who already has ownership of its internal SSD - in normal circumstances, the admin user. Without that, LocalPolicy can't be created, and the M1 won't boot from the external disk.\nWhat the 'thief' can do is put the M1 into DFU mode and restore it to factory settings, which trashes the keys to the internal SSD safeguarding any data there. And when it starts up, it then goes through  the 'new M1 Mac' routine of connecting to Apple before it can be set up.  If that Mac has been reported as missing, then Apple could refuse to set  it up at that stage.\nThe relevant article on my blog is at\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/2021/07/21/owners-and-users-primary-and-secondary-systems-on-m1-macs/\n\n\nA: This piece from Apple Platform Security Guide (HTML, PDF) seems to suggest that only users authenticated on this particular Mac can boot it from an external drive:\n\nA Mac with Apple silicon doesn’t require or support a specific media boot policy, because technically all boots are performed locally. If a user chooses to boot from external media, that operating system version must first be personalized using an authenticated reboot from recoveryOS. This reboot creates a LocalPolicy file on the internal drive that’s used to perform a trusted boot from the operating system stored on the external media.\nThis means the configuration of booting from external media is always explicitly enabled on a per operating system basis, and already requires user authorization, so no additional secure configuration is necessary.\n\n\nAnother piece: as of M1, volumes have ownership. When creating a second boot drive, a consent is required from a user on the default boot drive to hand off Ownership to the users on the second boot drive.\nWhich suggests that users who \"own\" an external boot drive could be not allowed to boot someone else's Mac as they are not on the same hierarchy with users on that Mac.\n\nBut I would very welcome someone more knowledgeable to comment on that.\n", "Q: How to always show full email address of sender and recipients in Apple mail According to this os/2 daily article we should be able to see the full email addresses by unchecking smart addresses:\n\nUncheck the box for “Use Smart Addresses” – under this you’ll see a note about “Turn this off to always display names and addresses.” which is exactly what we’re looking to do\n\nI have done so:\n\nYet the email addresses are all the short names without the full email addresses.  So how can this be done?  I am on Catalina and converting to Big Sur soon.\n\nA: There is hack that seems to work in Monterey and Catalina:\n\n*\n\n*switch on 'Use Smart Addresses' by ticking appropriate box\n\n*open one e-mail and close it\n\n*switch off 'Use Smart Addresses' by unticking\n\nNow you should see both name and e-mail address.\nPS - I don't know whether it is needed to open one mail or not. I did it this way. There is probability that it's suffice just to switch-on, switch-off but I have no way to verify it as my problem went away (and hopefully there will be no 'next time' to try it :-))\n", "Q: Macbook Air M1 clean reinstall stuck without Macintosh HD I am trying to reset a Macbook Air M1 and after I was stuck on some issue where I couldn't create the user during the setup process (M1 Mac clean install, getting stuck at \"Create a computer account\") I followed the alternative steps to reset the machine with the resetpassword command but now there is no Macintosh HD drive anymore and I have not been able to get it back with any of the instructions I could find.\nIn the Disc Utilities I currently see the following after \"show all\":\nIntern\n\n*\n\n*APPLE SSD AP0256Q Media\n\n*\n\n*Container disk3\n\n\n\nImage-Files\n\n*\n\n*Apple disk image Media\n\n*\n\n*Container disk5\n\n*\n\n*macOS Base System\n\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas with what instructions I can get to the next step? Thanks!\n\nA: If you do not need to keep any files or data currently on the internal storage, consider connecting another Mac and using Apple Configurator 2 to \"reimage\" the device.\nOtherwise, run First Aid on both the APPLE SSD and Container items under Internal.\n", "Q: Wipe free space on external SSD I bought an external SSD which is not working fine with my new Macbook Air running under Monterey. I wanted to erase the Disk securely before sending it back but I just noticed that it's not possible to choose the security option during the erase process. I also can't find the option \"wipe free space\". Is it safe to normally erase the disk and send it back? I tried to encrypt the disk, erase it. re-rencrypt it... But the disk is not working fine and I am not sure if the encryption is working.\n\nA: Given that you are not sure about the state of the SSD, do a simple risk assessment:\nIf you send the disk back as is, a) what is the cost (in reputation, commercial, etc.) to you if the data on the disk were to be read and disclosed, and b) how likely do you think that is?\nIf you don't send the disk back (instead destroy and replace), what is the  replacement cost?\nI think you can make that assessment and act accordingly.  This is a decision that always has to be done before returning a faulty disk.\n\nA: I found out that when using another USB-C cable to plug the SSD (I used the cable sent with the macBook for charging), the security level option appears when I try to erase the SSD. It took me more than 10 hours to erase the SSD and now the image recovery software does not find anything on the SSD.\n", "Q: Change ownership of files to remove need for multiple permissions In my home (/Users/) folder I have many files migrated from previous installations, with different Owners and Permissions set. /User shows I have three Users set in addition to Guest and Shared. I have used Finder to change permissions for all files to allow me as current User to read/write all. I would like to keep one other user, in addition to Guest and Shared, as admin only to allow access for repair etc.\nHow can I set myself as Owner of all files with full r/w (and x) access, so I can delete the then-un-needed Users, keeping Shared and Guest?\n\nA: If I have understood your question properly:\n\n*\n\n*you have a load of documents\n\n*you would like to ensure that userA is owner of the files\n\n*you would like to ensure that userA has read and write access to the files\n\n*you would also like to have a separate admin account that you use for system changes and not for everyday tasks\n\nHave I got that right? If so,\n\n*\n\n*Move the documents you would like to keep into /Users/adminA/Public/backup. Use terminal and the mv command: mv /Users/userB/Documents/School /Users/adminA/Public/backup\n\n*Log in as adminA and open terminal\n\n*id userA. In the results you will see gid=XXX (YYY), probably gid=20(staff). Make a note of the YYY\n\n*sudo chown -R userA:YYY “/Users/adminA/Public/backup”. This will change the owner of all the collated files and directories to userA\n\n*sudo find “/Users/adminA/Public/backup” -type f -exec chmod u=rw,g=rw,o= {} \\;\n\n*sudo find “/Users/adminA/Public/backup” -type d -exec chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o= {} \\;\nThe last 2 commands give userA read and write access to all of the files, and read/write/execute access over all subdirectories (execute access is needed to search in directories). At this point the group permissions bits are set the same so that we can move the files over from adminA's Documents to userA's Documents directory. You shouldn’t give userA executable access (‘x’) to all of the files because: (I imagine?) most of the files aren’t executable files. Giving files unnecessary executable access is a habit best (and easily) avoided.\n\n*mv /Users/adminA/Public/backup /Users/userA/Documents\n\n*(Now if you want to you could log in as userA, open terminal, and run find “/Users/userA/Documents/backup” -type f -exec chmod u=rw,g=,o= {} \\;...\n\n*... and find “/Users/userA/Documents/backup” -type d -exec chmod u=rwx,g=,o= {} \\; to remove group access to the files and subdirectories. This wouldn't really stop the admin account from accessing the files because they can always change permissions but it would stop other user accounts that exist (/will exist) in the staff group.\n\n\nA: The pragmatic answer is you can't change in a durable manner the ownership / permissionsof these folders as the system will \"fix\" them according to it's design any update and any time it writes new files.\nDeeper down, some specific applications will refuse to run with overly permissive permissions.\nIt might be easier to move the files you wish to share openly outside your home folder if you need more than one \"local account\" to access them. Changes to the permissions in /Users/Shared is more durable than trying to override the design of ~ your home folder - especially for hidden and system like files stores in your user home folder.\nHave you explored making a group permission change to allow access? I wonder if a small subset of the files are the only ones you need to \"relax\" permissions on.\nAlso, copying the files to an external drive is often very good so you can then ignore the permissions on that drive itself and then copy back the files to a place with default permissions needed.\n", "Q: Does the 140W USB-C Power Adapter work on MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)? I read this other question for a problem that i have(MacBook Pro not charging under heavy load)\nSince I do React native development, it seems to be chugging hard on my battery, and since it appears to be normal see the answer attached, I started looking for other chargers that might be capable to provide more Watt... And I stumbled on the 140W USB-C power adapter from apple.\nHere's the listing\nUnder compatibility, the MacBook is listed but in the description, it suggests the 2021 model... so I was wondering if the charger will give my MacBook pro the 140W or just the 96W as the other charger..?\n\nA: Just 96W as the other charger.\nIt is not the charger that decides how much power a computer is charged with. The computers draws the power from the charger - and the MacBook Pro 16-inch (2019) will only draw 96 watts. That goes even when the charger is capable of delivering more power.\nYou might instead want to look into conserving power. For example it could be that you have programs unnecessarily running and consuming CPU, or it could be that an update exists for some of your software that is more energy efficient.\nYou can also try for example lowering the brightness on the internal display to save power.\n\nA: The power rating of the adaptor is the maximum it can supply. It's not a hose that always pushes that much juice through the pipe.\nThe device takes what it can use. If Apple made a 500W adaptor, your Mac wouldn't get 500W.\n", "Q: is it normal for USB 3 external disks to take 5 minutes to mount? I have a 2020 M1 Mac and an old 27\" late 2012 iMac.\nI have two USB 3 disks, both encrypted APFS with two partitions. One is 5TB and the other is 1TB. Both use regular hard drives, NON-SSD.\nI connect the 5TB disk on the M1 Mac and the first partition (4TB) mounts and appears on finder after 2 minutes and 50 seconds. The second partition takes 5 minutes and 30 seconds to appear.\nI tried the same disk on the old iMac. The first partition (4TB) takes 2 minutes and 10 seconds to appear and the second one, 2 minutes and 50 seconds.\nOnce or twice a week both USB disks I have on these new Mac unmount without reason forcing macOS to pop a message telling me that the disks were removed without ejecting.\nDisk Utility says both disks and partitions are ok.\nAll disks are connected directly to the Mac USB ports.\nI have reinstalled Monterey on the new iMac, just in case.\nThe big questions:\n\n*\n\n*why they mount fast on the old iMac using Catalina?\n\n*are these times normal?\n\n*are these disks failing?\n\n*is the USB failing internally?\n\n*is there some terminal utility I can use to check the disks?\n\n\nA: Usually you can spot some version of fsck running when this happens. It is a file system check and the system runs it for you and until it’s done, you won’t see the disk mount.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-mk/guide/activity-monitor/welcome/mac\nYou may need to use the menu to show all processes to find this, since it runs without any app visible. If this is what’s happening, getting a faster disk or changing it so journaling is enabled will speed the time to check as will taking time to eject the disk properly.\nYou should be able to see the check logs in console app to validate the disks mount after the check completes in each case.\n", "Q: How to retrieve data from an added-to-homescreen web page Not sure which stack to ask this on...\nI would like to retrieve data from one of those added to homescreen web page shortcuts so that I can try and apply it to that same website either in Safari or in another shortcut.\nSpecifically, I'm talking about Wordle. The shortcut I'd created for the Wordle game when it was on powerlanguage.co.uk gets forwarded every time to the nytimes URL and it has all my game stats, but the game is squeezed because there's an added nytimes location header at the top and a tool bar at the bottom which shrinks the game interface.\nIf I go to the nytimes URL in Safari, the interface is good, but my stats are gone. Very annoying.\nI spoke with someone at nytimes and they say there's no way to transfer the game stats from the homescreen shortcut to the Safari browser. I'm hoping someone here knows how to prove them wrong.\n\nA: Well, I got half way there! I was able to export my stats from the old homescreen shortcut using a Siri Shortcut someone shared on reddit:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/s8vbrz/wordle_importexport/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nThat shortcut runs some JavaScript to export the stats which are in JavaScript localStorage and then I can import them into the nytimes site in Safari, but the next problem is:\n\n*\n\n*I cannot create a new homescreen shortcut that keeps/transfers the stats\n\n*There's no way to access the share menu in the homescreen shortcut to try to import them there either\n\nStill hoping someone has a clever way to accomplish this!\n\nA: I found a solution that works for transferring Wordle data using this tool: https://sethmlarson.dev/blog/wordle-stats\nThis works great in any browser, but I found it a little tricky when dealing with a web page saved to the Home Screen, since the \"Add to Home Screen\" command does not copy over any storage data.\nI was in a similar situation, trying to transfer my old https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/ link (saved to the Home Screen) to https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html.\nSince the saved Home Screen web page doesn't provide you with an address bar to navigate to the tool mentioned above, you could tap the Settings (gear) icon in the top right corner of the newly added NYTimes Worlde saved web page, and follow the Twitter link, taking you to the @NYTGames account. From there, you can scroll down or search for this tweet:\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/NYTGames/status/1532414444575375361\nAlternatively, enter the URL for the Wordle stats tool in the \"Search Twitter\" input field, which should help you reach the page. The idea is basically to get to a tool such as the one mentioned within the newly added Home Screen site.\nFrom there, follow the instructions on the site to reset your statistics. Note the one caveat that this tool currently is not able to reset your current streak.\nEDIT: I found another similar solution, using the same concept of finding a way to navigate outside the saved New York Times site, but doing so by getting to Google and using different tool to fix, which purportedly allows you to set the current streak: https://www.reddit.com/r/wordle/comments/v15u3i/fixing_wordle_stats_for_those_who_have_ios/\n", "Q: How to add a 10 minute reminder through shortcut?

On iOS 14 and above, use Touch ID or Face ID to unlock. If you don’t have biometric authentication enabled, you’ll be prompted to enter the pin you use to unlock your phone.\n\nhttps://faq.whatsapp.com/web/download-and-installation/how-to-log-in-or-out\n", "Q: Safari inserts \"localhost\" in URLs with three slashes after the scheme Safari seems to be the only browser that differently handles URL's that have three slashes after the scheme.\nFor example typing https:///google.com in the address bar results in the URL being converted to https://google.com by all browsers I tried (Edge, Firefox, Opera, Tor), excepting for Safari, which converts the URL to https://localhost/google.com.\nThe conversion also happens when receiving a HTTP redirect (301 or 302) with a \"malformed\" URL, but doesn't happen when clicking on a link, in that case Safari is consistent with the other browsers.\nDoes somebody know why is that? And who's correct - Safari inserting localhost, or the other browsers stripping out the third slash?\n\nA: @AlvarPaalberg's answer gives an earlier view\nThere are later RFCs that I think add to this.\nThe one I found is RFC7230 defining the http protocol. This includes\n\nA sender MUST NOT generate an \"http\" URI with an empty host\nidentifier.  A recipient that processes such a URI reference MUST\nreject it as invalid.\n\nAlso RFC3986\n\nIf the URI scheme defines a default for host, then that default\napplies when the host subcomponent is undefined or when the\nregistered name is empty (zero length).  For example, the \"file\" URI\nscheme is defined so that no authority, an empty host, and\n\"localhost\" all mean the end-user's machine, whereas the \"http\"\nscheme considers a missing authority or empty host invalid.\n\nFrom that I think all the browsers are incorrect. They should be rejecting the URL as invalid. Now browsers in general have never liked reporting errors for invalid html or anything else so they decide what they think the user typed and use that instead.\nSafari has chosen a different view to others. (It has used the rule for the file: scheme - which I guess is due to Safari developers being more integrated withe the OS developers than is the case for other browsers. macOS system APIs us file URLs for most file operations)\n\nA: What happens when the text is entered in the address bar of the browser is not tied by any specs yet, so for this situation there is no \"wrong\" or \"correct\" behavior.\nHowever, for redirects sent by the server in response to a fetch request, the Fetch standards rule, and these standards(§8.2 - \"follow\") ask that the `Location` header in the response be parsed through the URL standards URL-parser algorithm.\nThis algorithm when it will encounter the third / in the special authority ignore slashes state will emit a validation error, but won't leave this step until all subsequent / are found (and thus ignored).\nSo the result of parsing an input such as https:///////example.com should be\nprotocol: \"https:\"\nhost: \"example.com\"\npath: \"/\"\n\nI.E, the multiple / characters after https: are ignored.\nAnd even Safari agrees on that in other places, like in HTML's <a href>, as can be seen from the links in OP.\nThat they don't follow this rule for fetch redirects is a bug, and as such, you may want to report it to their bug-tracker.\n\nA: One can try to give answer to the question why? but not who is correct?\n\nRFC 1738 - Uniform Resource Locators (URL):\nThe file URL scheme is used to designate files accessible on a\nparticular host computer. This scheme, unlike most other URL schemes,\ndoes not designate a resource that is universally accessible over the\nInternet.\nA file URL takes the form:\n    file://<host>/<path>\n\n/../ As a special case,  can be the string \"localhost\" or the empty\nstring; this is interpreted as `the machine from which the URL is\nbeing interpreted'.\n\nSo it appears that Safari considers three slashes as file URL scheme special case (empty string) and replaces empty string between second and third slash with 'localhost'. Other browsers consider it as user entered one slash too much and actually want to access internet resource so they 'autocorrect' it.\n", "Q: Eliminating all apple telemetry Using Lulu, and turning off the \"allow apple processes\" option, You can see that apple makes hundreds of connections to the internet for a variety of reasons.\nI did an experiment: I blocked all outgoing Apple connections. For weeks, new connections popped up every day, I can't remember how many I blocked but it must have been around 200.\nThe result? System instability. The inability to connect caused the MacBook Pro to get really sludgy. I did not have the foresight to see if it was connected to the CPU load, but there you have it. I did not change anything in the system, install any new apps, or anything like that in the time I did the experiment.\nHere's the catch though:\nIf I turn off any internet connection, the MacBook will run smoothly into infinity, never being allowed to connect.\nIt makes sense, the backlog causes issues. But it is almost like a punishment as well.\nMy question:\nIs it possible to eliminate these processes at a lower level (kernel extensions? I'm not knowledgeable enough) to just eliminate the macbook's need to connect entirely for anything?\nWould there be any real drawbacks? Would this prevent security definitions from being updated resulting in vulnerabilities, perhaps?\nTIA\n\nA: I think the problem here is that you think all these connections are \"telemetry\". They're not. At least not using a common understanding of what telemetry is.\nThe easiest fix for your problem is simply not to block these connections - then you will not experience that slowness.\nThe slowness comes from fact that various programs and system services rely on Apple's server for various functionality. If you do not block those in the right manner, these programs will just think the server is slow to respond - so they wait and wait for a reply until finally timing out. This is then the slowness you perceive.\nFor example you're trying to run an application you've downloaded from the Mac App Store. The system will ask Apple's servers whether this app has been revoked due to security issues before running it. If it is not blocked correctly that will introduce a wait for you. Even when it is blocked correctly, you still loose the functionality that Apple can stop malicious software from being run without warning on your computer.\nYes, if you really want you can eliminate these \"processes\" - it does not take kernel extensions to do so. You can just kill and/or remove the programs involved. I wouldn't recommend doing so.\nIn terms of drawbacks - yes, there are real drawbacks in blocking these connections. And yes, of course security definitions cannot be updated since you've purposely blocked that - so that could result in vulnerabilities. Similarly you wouldn't be getting software updates. In addition to that, your system will no longer know when certificates for your installed software have been revoked (OCSP) - and as such, you leave the system vulnerable there as well.\n", "Q: Monterey's password manager in Firefox/other apps How do I use the new Monterey password manager when I want to log in to a website in Firefox? I don't want to go to the System Preferences to look up the password, I want that it automatically pops up when I want to login into a Firefox/other application site and I can choose the desired account.\n\nA: It’s likely you need Firefox development to update coding unless someone knows a setting to enable this in the app. I have not examined the Firefox code recently, but Apple has documentation on how third party developers can call for password auto fill.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/enabling_password_autofill_on_a_text_input_view\nAt the bottom, there is a warning:\n\nIf you use a custom input view for a security code input text field, iOS cannot display the necessary AutoFill UI.\n\nAnd also the requirements for html pages to summon the UIKit function.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/enabling_password_autofill_on_an_html_input_element\nIf the pages you visit meet the above requirements and work on safari you may be stuck waiting for Firefox to support this or have to use an alternate system like https://1password.com/ which ships extensions / plug-in for Firefox to add similar support.\n", "Q: What's the normal rpm and sensors temperature for Macbook pro 2019 I have a Macbook Pro 2019 (Core i7 16GB 16inch) and for normal usage with Google Chrome and VSCode for simple projects, it shows this temperature and fan speed\n\nIs it normal?\nIts fan are always on and I think it isn't normal.\nI disabled Spotlight and Activity Monitor shows these details.\n\n\nA: Yes, this is all normal and within specs.\nIf you have no particular problem with the machine, there's no need to examine temperatures and RPMs closely.

Do I need to renew that subscription each year for keeping the app on App store?\nPlease feel free to ask for clarifications on the question.\n\nA: Yes, you will need to renew your subscription in order to keep the app on the App Store and attract new users. The app will continue to work though for users that have already installed it prior to the subscription expiring.\nAs per Apple's web site:\n\nIf your Apple Developer Program membership expires, your apps will no longer be available for download and you won’t be able to submit new apps or updates.

There’s an annoying message that pops up every few minutes “macOS MDM Enrollment” is the title. I’ve tried several different methods posted on this site to remove it. I’ve been in Recovery Mode more times than I can count. I’ve turned off FileVault, removed all of the pertinent files from LaunchAgent and LaunchDaemon,unmounted and mounted my volume, etc. Nothing has been effective. I’m running Monterey v12.2.1 on an Intel 2019 MacBook Pro. Can anyone suggest something new?\n\nA: There are no \"methods\" you can try locally to remove it from the MDM it is enrolled in.\nContact the company that claims ownership of the device and find out the actual status.  They may want it back.\n", "Q: 1920x1280 retina monitor I’m looking for a large monitor for my MacBook (2019 Intel 16”). Huawei sells a 3,840 x 2,560 monitor instead of the usual 3,840 x 2,160, which is the largest monitor at a reasonable price (less than £600, and nobody sells 5k anymore).\nCan anyone confirm if this monitor will work as 1,920 x 1,280 retina, and whether it will work scaled at 2,560 x 1,706 resolution?\nFor some context: The monitor is supposed to be used for software development. There are plenty of 27\" 4k monitors (3,840 x 2,160 pixels) which usually show 1,920 x 1,080 as Retina display with text that is too large, and can be scaled to 2,560 x 1,440. 5K monitors that would display 2,560 x 1,440 without scaling were sold by Dell and LG for about £1,100; both stopped selling them but some are available on eBay, used. Anything larger starts at £4,000-£5,000 (Apple 6k, Dell 8k monitor), so unaffordable.\nIn theory this monitor should scale to 2,560 x 1,706 with the same 3:2 ratio which would be very nice for software development. But I'd rather know that it works, because it is quite possible that Apple only supports some small set of resolutions.\n\nA: Yes, the monitor should work as 1920x1280 Retina.\nFor me personally, I very much prefer such an aspect ratio. As a software developer, I have always preferred 1920x1200 (16:10) displays over the ubiquitous 1920x1080 (16:9) displays. Having a 3840x2560 (3:2) display would be even better in this regard.\nIf your main objective with the monitor is to view movies that are 16:9 - then of course you wouldn't really get anything extra out of this monitor compared to a standard 3840x2160 display.\nRegarding the scaled 2560x1706 resolution - I haven't tested a display with this specific resolution before, so I cannot for sure say if that will work - it does sound likely that it will work. Note that the conversion is going to introduce a certain loss of \"sharpness\" as you're not pixel doubling, but scaling with a non-integer factor.\n\nA: I’ve bought the monitor - result: A Huawei Mateview 28.2” monitor, 3840x2560 pixels at 160 dpi, works with a 2019 Intel 16” MBP. There are about 8 resolutions from 1920x1280 to 3840x2880 available, including 2560x1707 and 2304 or 2880 wide.\nThe screen is 60cmx40cm. Compared to the 5k monitor on a 2015 iMac 27”, at 2560x1707 the display is 18% higher, font size is quite exactly the same, and text readability is almost as good as the iMac screen. Text quality at 2304 or 2880 wide is noticeable less good, I assume because 2560x1707 scales exactly by 50%.\nConnection to the MBP is via USB-C and charges the MBP, so there is just one cable plugged in the MBP. And half the price of the 5k displays that Dell and LG don’t build anymore.\n", "Q: iOS and macOS synching messages, but old messages not restoring on Mac I have been an iPhone user for a while, but just recently got back into the macOS game.

With syncing, am I not supposed to be getting my old messages too?  Is this a known issue?  Is there a manual way to transfer the history and then resume syncing the conventional way?\n\nA: So I must be impatient..sort of.  I had to connect/logout/reconnect to iCloud several times in different ways with my Mac and my phone.  It's finally downloading...ahhhh.

My wife would like to watch her photos on our Apple TV. She is logged in on our Apple TV and we are also sharing an iCloud subscription as well.\nIs there a way to do that? Or somehow load her photos to my photo library?\n\nA: Sadly enough, this not possible in the way you’d expect. The UI and settings of the Apple TV suggest you can simply switch between registered users and by switching, you’d gain access to that user’s content. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Seriously, the person who designed this ought to be escorted to a remote place, far far away… (no, not that far, even further!)\nThe simplest way to watch photo’s taken by a different user is to cast them from the user’s iPad or iPhone to the Apple TV (via AirPlay). Alternatively, you could create a shared album and the other user needs to move/copy all their photos to this shared album. But that too is not an easy task; functionality for managing your photo’s is extremely lacking. All this is completely beyond my understanding. Why, Apple? Why?\nKind regards from a long time, but ever so frustrated Apple user!\n", "Q: Mac wifi network is spinning and won't prompt for password I want to connect to a password-protected wifi network at a co-working space.\nI chose the network and typed in a password but mistyped it.

Apple keeps frameworks in /System/Library/Frameworks/ and /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/. Inside these directories are *.framework files, which are themselves a directory of computing resources (binary executables, dynamically linked libaries, headers, etc.).\nHow can I list which frameworks are being currently used by the system, e.g. have a component loaded in kernel memory or are being executed? Is there a way to understand what frameworks are required for a given program, such as a daemon or app, to run properly? If possible I'd like to generate a framework dependency tree for an arbitrarily chosen system program.\nI have tried to gather this information from top but this doesn't tell me about dynamically loaded libraries, nor does it explicitly tie an executable to the framework directory from which it comes.\n\nA: You should note that frameworks can also be placed in really any other place in the file system - they're not constrained to those two paths. In particular, some applications will have frameworks inside their application bundle.\nYour first question comes from a misunderstanding - frameworks are not something that are used by the kernel, loaded into kernel memory, and so on. I think you're confusing them with kernel extensions (similar to for example kernel modules in Linux) - which are executables loaded into kernel memory and used by the kernel itself.\nFrameworks are instead used by user-space programs, and they are linked into the memory space of that particular user-space program. This can be done in two ways - either it is done on startup by the system's dynamic linker (dyld), or it can be done at run-time by the program itself.\nFor the first case, you can view the list of frameworks an executable requests the system's dynamic linker to load for it on startup, by running a command like this in the Terminal:\notool -L /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox\n\nFor the second case, you will have to monitor the program during execution. Note that you cannot be sure that you'll catch all frameworks used in this manner, as the actual frameworks loaded might depend on the input to the program. It is not usual for programs to work like that though, so you'll probably be fine with using otool for your scenario.\nNote that a framework might in itself depend on another framework, so you'll have to rerun otool on the listed frameworks in order to manually build up a dependency graph.\n", "Q: Regular crashes of WindowServer My Mac crashes regularly because of WindowServer problems.

So, when I press Apple Menu > Shut Down it starts shutting down but it takes some seconds.\nCan I close the lid when the shutting down process starts or do I have to wait for the keyboard backlight to turn off before closing the lid?\nSometimes if I'm outside during the day the light is so high that I cannot see if the keyboard actually turned off or not.\n\nA: According to this Apple Support page, the best approach is to wait for your MacBook to shut down before closing its lid if you want to make sure it has properly shut down.\n\nImportant: If you’re using a Mac notebook computer, wait for it to shut down completely before closing the display. If you close the display while the Mac is shutting down, it may not shut down properly and may start up more slowly the next time you turn it on.\n\nMy 2-year old MacBook Pro has always shut down properly in my experience when I closed the lid after asking it to shut down but my situation might have been helped by the fact that I always quit all open programs, except the Finder which of course can not be completely quit, before giving the shut down command. It is possible, for example, that some open program, which does not automatically save your work and has unsaved work at the time, may prevent your computer from shutting down and then your computer would simply go to sleep, instead of shutting down, because the lid is closed.\n", "Q: Bizarre camera issues with macOS Monterey Intro\nI've got a headscratcher with my camera setup on macOS Monterey. I go back and forth between using an external webcam (a Logitech C615) and the internal FaceTime camera on my MacBook Pro. I've had zero issues for the entire time I've had the laptop. A week ago, I updated to Monterey from Catalina, and now both cameras are behaving very strangely.\nThe problem\nFirst, the actual camera functionality on the webcam failed, but the laptop still detects it as a microphone. I tried plugging in the webcam through docks, directly via a USB-C->A dongle, etc., and it did not work. I figured the camera had died, so I bought a brand new one and it did not work either. However, I noticed something very weird when I plugged in the new camera. If I open FaceTime with no webcam plugged in, I can see that the internal camera works. However, as soon as I plug in the external camera, the internal camera fails to be detected with the message \"no camera connected\", and of course the webcam does not work either. FaceTime can see the microphone on the webcam but suddenly does not recognize the internal MacBook Pro camera or the external one. ~50% of the time, restarting FaceTime after unplugging the camera works and restores the internal camera. Sometimes, it requires a reboot.\nWhat I've tried\nAs described above, I tried every dongle/direct plug I had, as well as trying a new webcam. I manually stopped and restarted the video controller via sudo killall VDCAssistant. I've reset the PRAM and the SMC. I've booted into Safe Mode and replicated the problem there. I fully updated macOS to the latest version (12.2.1) and updated all of the component software. I tried to reinstall macOS via Recovery Mode, but was unable to connect to the Internet for some reason and was unable to complete the update. I've tried installing ManyCam per the solution in this StackExchange question which did not work.\nAny ideas on what might be causing this? What should I do from here? Please let me know if there is any other info I can provide, either about the system or the webcam.\n\nA: Try updating to macOS 12.3.1. I have heard reports of some USB cameras working better with the update.\n", "Q: Defined bash commands not found when passed in \"do shell script\" in osascript I am new to shell script and recently wrote a script to open a new terminal window and run defined functions via osascript with \"do shell script\", but the result showed the command not found. My script is as below:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nhello() {\n    echo \"Hello World\"\n}\n\nopenNewWindowAndRun() {\n    osascript -e \"\n        tell application \\\"Terminal\\\"\n            activate        \n            do script \\\"$1\\\"\n        end tell\n    \"\n}\n\nopenNewWindowAndRun hello\n\nI have also tried to directly call the hello function in the openNewWindowAndRun but didn't get any luck:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nhello() {\n    echo \"Hello World\"\n}\n\nopenNewWindowAndRun() {\n    osascript -e \"\n        tell application \\\"Terminal\\\"\n            activate        \n            do script \\\"hello\\\"\n        end tell\n    \"\n}\n\nopenNewWindowAndRun\n\nWhen I ran the script, it opened the new window successfully but showed the error message:\n\nDoes anyone know which part I missed here? Is it possible to pass a defined function as a parameter to osascript? If anyone can give me a hand,  that would be great!\n\nA: hello is a function defined within a shell script, it can only be called by bash code from within the script itself. It is not accessible directly from the command line (your screen shot) nor from within Applescript (your osascript call).\nTo resolve this, you need to turn your hello function into a shell script itself.\n", "Q: Uninstalling apps in homebrew I recently tried to install Matlab from Homebrew for macOS by running brew install matlab2tikz. Now, I would like to remove this file. How do I do it?\n\nA: You can uninstall it by running the command:\nbrew uninstall matlab2tikz\nAs mentioned in the other answer, you can look for all the available Homebrew command by reading the manual, which can be accessed by running the following command:\nman brew\nThe commmand to uninstall a formula installed via Homebrew is:\nbrew uninstall <formula_name>\n\nA: man brew lists the possible options, including uninstall.\n", "Q: What can I safely charge with the apple 20W power plug? I once plugged a macbook air usb-c charger on a wireless speaker and it completely screwed the battery, so apparently, I can't charge any battery with any charger.\nI just got a 20W apple charger for my iPhone 12. Can I safely charge my magic mouse with it? Amazon Kindle?\n\nA: Yes, you can charge any standards-compliant device that uses USB-C for charging/powering.\nYour experience with the wireless speaker demonstrates that the speaker itself was defective and/or not standards compliant - or that your particular charger was defective (which is not that likely given that you can charge your laptop with it).\n", "Q: how to rename a system group like `staff` I was not able to rename an existing system group via /etc/group nor via the tool dscl.\nIs it even possible to rename a group?\nWould it be better to delete and re-create the group with the same GID as before?\n\nA: On modern macOS the system volume is read-only, signed and sealed in order to preserve integrity. You can disable that protection, and then you'll be able to rename the staff group as you like.

I'm trying to avoid using the Label name.\nOn my Monterey device, I know softwareupdate -i -safari-only works. However, I can't find a good way to just update Safari on Big Sur devices using a terminal command.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Okay, after the help of bmike I came up with this. This will look for a Safari update, grab the label and use the label to update Safari. That way the script will work with any future Safari update with a different label name.\ncheck=$(softwareupdate -l | grep Safari | grep -o 'Safari[^[:blank:]]*' | head -n 1)\n echo \"$check\"\nsoftwareupdate -i \"$check\"\n\n\nA: We have to list updates and apply the exact specific label for this to work.\nUse softwareupdate -l -a to list the available updates and their labels.\nUse softwareupdate -l -a | grep -i Safari to list the available Safari updates and their labels.\nUse softwareupdate -i Safari15.3BigSurAuto-15.3 to install the latest Safari update. Use the corresponding label if you want another version.\nsoftwareupdate will try to quit Safari before installing it.\nYou’ll also perhaps need to reboot user space if you can’t guarantee the person using the Mac doesn’t have Safari running or any of its libraries.\n", "Q: How can I set a scheduled boot for a MacBook running Windows? I have a MacBook Air running OSX Big Sur along with a Boot Camp installation of Windows 10.  If I boot into OSX and go to System Preferences -> Battery -> Schedule, I can set a time each day for the MacBook to turn on.\nIf I shutdown the MacBook while running OSX, then the MacBook will properly boot back up at the scheduled time.  Yay! (It boots to Windows by default, which is fine.)\nHOWEVER, if I shutdown the MacBook while running Windows, the MacBook DOES NOT boot at the scheduled time.\nMy guess is that the MacBook isn't seeing the trigger to automatically boot since that setting is defined in OSX and the laptop isn't getting far enough to query OSX after running Windows.\nIs there any way around this?\n\nA: You need to load custom code to do this. We use BootRunner to do this.\n\n*\n\n*https://twocanoes.com/products/mac/boot-runner/\nIt’s amazing and the support is excellent.\n\nA: Well, your laptop isn't running OSX and Windows at the same time. Windows is installed as a separate partition, not a virtual machine. When you boot into Windows, there is no OSX to 'query'. If Windows has these features, I would imagine you would enable them in Windows.\n", "Q: Unblock app Mac labels as unidentified developer with xattr I recently asked how to unblock a binary from Mac's complaint that it's not identified. See How to unblock binary from use because Mac says it is not from identified developer.\nThe solution of utilizing the command xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine <path to file>/my-binary-amd64 worked for me.\nNow I just used tried to install VSCodium with brew install --cask vscodium. Now when I try to open, I'm getting the same error I was originally getting with the binary...\nI tried to adapt the script above to fit my needs: xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/VSCodium.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/codium but this didn't work. And it wa simply a guess. Perhaps there's a different path?\nThere's a solution offered for this problem here: Software was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer\nBut simply clicking the \"Open Anyway\" button under Security & Privacy only gets me the same refusal prompt from Apple.\nI'm hoping that the xattr solution can be extended to an application rather than a binary.\n\nA: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/VsCodium.app worked for me.\nMost likely for other applications initiating the xattr command at the parent directory would work for others too.\n\nA: Since your question is specifically about homebrew, one thing that might help is the --no-quarantine flag:\nbrew install --cask --no-quarantine vscodium\n\nThis disables Apple quarantining for a specific app.\n", "Q: How can I return a value from column C based on a match in column A, and a maximum value within the matched rows from column B? I have a Numbers sheet for tracking work on podcast editing. The source table includes columns for the episode name, the work start and end times, a work duration calculated from those two, and the final length of the edit (expressed as a duration value) at the end of that session of work. So like this:\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nWork start\nWork end\nWork time\nEnd length\n\n\n\n\nProject 42\n08/07/2021 14:43\n08/07/2021 15:04\n0:21:00\n1:06:23\n\n\nProject 42\n08/07/2021 15:59\n08/07/2021 16:35\n0:36:00\n0:58:19\n\n\nProject 42\n08/07/2021 17:34\n08/07/2021 18:00\n0:26:00\n0:59:46\n\n\n\n\nI use another table to compile aggregate data for each individual project, and I want one column to show the final length of each episode once all editing was complete.\nAs an approximate I used MINIFS to find the shortest end length that matched the episode number. But on many episodes (as in the example above) the final editing task is splicing in additional audio, making the episode longer, so this method is inaccurate.\nWhat I actually need is a column that returns the end length from the row in the source table which both matches the Episode number, and has the maximum (i.e. most recent) work end time.\nIs this possible with just the two tables? Or do I need to add in an additional column or interim table to make this work?\n\nA: You don’t need another table but need to use a formula with a function within a function or at least have an additional column in your aggregates or output table. You can use the MAXIFS() function in Numbers to find the Work end date&time for the latest work on a certain episode, and assuming all date&times in the Work end column are unique, you can use one of the lookup functions such as VLOOKUP() or XLOOKUP() and the result of the MAXIFS() to get the corresponding duration in the End length column.\nIf this is not helpful enough or if you need more details, I suggest that you prepare an example output table manually, i.e. copy & paste or type the desired or correct values, with at least a few rows and include it in your post.\n", "Q: Missing option to cancel Apple Music subscription I have the Apple Music 'individual' subscription, and now I want to cancel it. But when I go the the settings it does not show the option to cancel subscription.\n\nIt only gives an option to resubscribe. How can I cancel my subscription entirely?\n\nA: It looks like you are sharing the same product with your family and friends.\nIs it possible you are not actually being charged for anything and simply getting the shared benefit?\nI would expect to see a checkmark icon next to the item I am responsible for.\n", "Q: iCloud features are partially not working I reinstalled macOS on my macbook (currently running 10.15.7) and some of the iCloud features stopped working for me. Syncing tabs and history in Safari doesn't work and also Personal Hotspot on iPhone doesn't show up in the WiFi menu on my mac (but works if activated manually.)\nAlso login to iCloud is painfully slow, asking for my mac or iPhone password several times (as I understand to decrypt data). And such a long login came after I updated my iPhone to iOS 15. Then I rolled back to iOS 14 while it was still possible and had the same problem of long login time, but all functions continue to work on IPhone.\nI've tried both logging out of iCloud on all devices, reinstalling the system again, and booting with a new user account. The problem remains.\n\nA: I solved this problem by completely deleting encrypted data in iCloud. I logged out of iCloud on my Mac, then when prompted to enter my iPhone password, I clicked I don't remember it and agreed to the erase (having previously exported passwords from Safari and disabled the iCloud Keychain on my iPhone). I then went through the setup steps, enabled syncing, and imported the saved passwords. And now everything works!

Going back to Mavericks, I find that the xattr command is not included in OS X Recovery. However, if while booted to OS X Recovery for Mavericks, you have a working Mavericks installed, then you still can use the xattr command that was included with Mavericks. The image below was taken while booted to OS X Recovery for Mavericks. This image shows Mavericks is installed on the Macintosh HD volume.\n\nThe commands below were entered in a Terminal window while booted to OS X Recovery for Mavericks.\nBelow is the output from the echo $PATH command.\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nBelow is the output from the ls /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/usr/bin/xattr command.\n/Volumes/Macintosh HD/usr/bin/xattr\n\nSo the xattr command would be in the search path for commands, if the colon‑separated list of directories output by echo $PATH were proceeded with /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD. As the OP has pointed out, other software (such as python) may need to be included in this path. This can be accomplished by proceeding the xattr command with the chroot command, as shown below.\nchroot \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\" xattr\n\nIn this case the chroot command changes its root directory to the supplied directory \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\".\nExample When Accessing a File in the Current Working Directory\nIf the current working directory contained the file test.txt, then the following command would not work. (Unless the current working directory was /Volumes/Macintosh HD.)\nchroot \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\" xattr -c test.txt\n\nHowever, the following command would cause all attributes to be removed from the file test.txt.\nchroot \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\" xattr -c \"$PWD/test.txt\"\n\nUsing $PWD works in the above command, because /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Volumes/Macintosh HD is a symbolic link to /.\nHow to Remount When Necessary to Access One or More Files\n\nNote: Any remounting only persists until the Mac restarts.\n\nIf one or more files to be accessed do not reside in the Mavericks startup volume, then the mount point for each of these other volumes will need to be moved to the Mavericks startup volume. For example, if the test.txt file is stored in the MyHFS volume instead of in the Macintosh HD volume, then you will need to remount the MyHFS volume. First, enter the command below to unmount the MyHFS volume.\ndiskutil unmount MyHFS\n\nExample output is shown below.\nVolume MyHFS on disk1s3 unmounted\n\nNext, use the commands below to insure the new mount point exists in the Macintosh HD volume, then mount the MyHFS volume at that point. The identifier disk1s3 that is entered should be the same as shown in the above output.\nmkdir -p /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Volumes/MyHFS\ndiskutil mount -mountpoint /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Volumes/MyHFS disk1s3\n\nExample output is shown below.\nVolume MyHFS on disk1s3 mounted\n\n \n\nA: The xattr command has relied on the system-bundled python2. If you've copied the command for use in the recovery partition, it won't work, as the Recover Partition doesn't have python.\n", "Q: Change creation date to folder name - batch Hi I have a load of jpg and avi files in sub folders which are named with the date the files were created. Unfortunately the files themselves have incorrect creation dates which I would like to batch change to that of the folder names.\nI've had a hunt around the forum and found some good info on changing the creation date to that of the file name but can't find anything on the same process for using a folder name instead. I've used the rename tool to get the folders into the correct date format for using the touch -t command and then I was trying to find a way to use a similar process to the one in this post: read creation date from file name and change - batch to apply the date change in bulk to each file.\nThe files are in a folder with a subfolder for each date they were taken on. An example subfolder name is 2005_09_28 with files named IMG_0441.jpg, IMG_0445.jpg and MVI_0448.avi in them. I'd like to change the creation date of each file to match the subfolder the are in.\nI've looked at doing it by using software such as 'a better finder' to rename the files and then use the method in the post mentioned above but would like to so it without renaming the files if possible.\n\nA: Assuming a simple two-level structure of folders named YYYY-MM-DD and files directly in these folders:\ncd PARENT-FOLDER\nfor d in *; do\n    if [[ -d \"$d\" && \"$d\" =~ [0-9]{4}_[0-9]{2}_[0-9]{2} ]]; then\n        touch -t \"$(sed 's/_//g' <<< $d)0000\" \"$d\" \"$d\"/*\n    fi\ndone\n\nPlease note: No error handling, this may fail in case of \"unexpected\" data or empty folders.\n\n*\n\n*for d in *; do iterates over all entries in the folder\n\n*-d \"$d\" tests whether the current entry actually is a directory\n\n*$d =~ [0-9]{4}_[0-9]{2}_[0-9]{2} tests whether the actual entry matches our YYYY-MM-DD pattern\n\n*$(sed 's/_//g' <<< $d)0000 runs sed in a subshell to replace the _ by \"nothing\" to get YYYYMMDD, and appends 0000 (midnight) for the time part. This could also be written as $(sed -E 's/_(..)_(..)$/\\1\\20000/g' <<< $d)\n\nThe above will change access and modification date (which often is enough). If you indeed want to change the creation date, you need to install Xcode from the App Store to get the SetFile utility. You can then run\ncd PARENT-FOLDER\nfor d in *; do\n    if [[ -d \"$d\" && \"$d\" =~ [0-9]{4}_[0-9]{2}_[0-9]{2} ]]; then\n        SetFile -d \"$(sed -E 's|(.*)_(.*)_(.*)|\\2/\\3/\\1 00:00|' <<< $d)\" \"$d\" \"$d\"/*\n    fi\ndone\n\n", "Q: How do I open a .webarchive in iOS Safari? My goal is to save (mobile) webpages so that I can comfortably read them offline in iOS 14 on an iPhone. So far I've tried:\n\n*\n\n*Asking the Safari reading list to save them offline, making sure to enable automatic saving for offline use in Safari settings. Unsurprisingly Safari doesn't save the items in my reading list, which results in lots of unusable entries (and a useless feature).\n\n*Saving the mobile page as a PDF through the system screenshot feature. The resulting PDF is just cut off at some arbitrary point making it impossible to read e.g. a long article. This happens both in reading mode and ordinary page PDFs. Unusable.\n\n*Saving the page as a .webarchive with Safari. This is the best alternative so far, but when I open the archive in Files I can't interact with the preview of it, making e.g. expandable sections unusable (one example is mobile Wikipedia article sections), and I'm not offered to open it in Safari (!) This also prevents me from using Safari's reading mode on it.\n\n*Saving the reading mode page as a .webarchive. Doesn't work — it just saves the source page, i.e. same result as #3.\n\n*Adding the actual .webarchive to Safari's reading list instead of to the Files app when asked where to save the archive. Unsurprisingly the reading list can't even save the page for offline use when handed the archive on a silver platter like this...\n\nHow can I open my .webarchives in iOS Safari?\n\nA: I was really disappointed that there appeared to be no way to do this on iOS…\nso I made an app:\n Web Archive Inspector\nThe app decodes the web archive and attempts to activate any JavaScript it finds. There's an item in the menu to ‘Inject JavaScript’ which also forces external JavaScript resources (where the original response was saved in the archive) to be executed too, still supporting offline.\nIt's not 100% but I've tried it with the collapsible sections on Wikipedia mobile you mention in the question and it works great for me!

I already turned off file delete confirmation for my Windows 10, and this Dialog no longer appears for the files on my C:\\ drive.\nBut after I plug my iPhone into my Windows 10 thru USB, this Dialog still appears whenever I delete a file on my iPhone. Please see screenshot below.\nWhy does the Delete Confirmation Dialog still appear on my Windows 10, whenever I delete files on my iPhone?\nI don't require immediate file deletion. I can happily keep the Recycle Bin as a safety net, so that when I click \"Delete\", files are moved to the Recycle Bin first and can be undeleted. How can I accomplish this?\n\n\nA: Probably because there's no safety net - the file will not go to trash, it will be immediately deleted, permanently.\nThe same happens if you try to 'hard' delete directly from Windows' own desktop using Shift/Del instead of just Del. The same is true of network file delete.\n\nIf you change that Properties setting From 'Custom size\" to \"Don't move files to the Recycle Bin…\" then Shift/Del from the internal drives won't ask you. [I can't test whether this will also apply to the iPhone, but it ought to follow a similar rule-set.]\nWARNING: Toggling this will remove the recycle bin functionality — that is, the recycle bin will no longer operate.

Fn key is out of options because because of the way it is set in the Windows keyboard it is not able to be used by macOS.\n\nA: You can add custom complex modifications to Karabiner, I wrote one to do exactly this.\n{\n  \"title\": \"Change right_shift + left_shift to caps_lock\",\n  \"description\": \"Change right_shift + left_shift to caps_lock\",\n  \"manipulators\": [\n    {\n      \"from\": {\n        \"key_code\": \"left_shift\",\n        \"modifiers\": {\n          \"mandatory\": [\"right_shift\"],\n          \"optional\": [\"caps_lock\"]\n        }\n      },\n      \"to\": [\n        {\n          \"key_code\": \"caps_lock\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"basic\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"from\": {\n        \"key_code\": \"right_shift\",\n        \"modifiers\": {\n          \"mandatory\": [\"left_shift\"],\n          \"optional\": [\"caps_lock\"]\n        }\n      },\n      \"to\": [\n        {\n          \"key_code\": \"caps_lock\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"basic\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n", "Q: How to transfer E-Mails from one mac to another? I have multiple E-Mail accounts which I use with Apple Mail on macos, one of them is an university account which is no longer active, which means that I don't have access to the IMAP server anymore. I would like to move these E-Mails to a new and fresh installed MacBook-Air, so that I can keep browsing and searching through those old E-Mails.\nI definetly would not want to restore my whole macos installation from my Timemachine backup on this new M1 mac. I just need to transfer my E-Mails from the old computer to the new one.\nI would prefer to do this with my other accounts as well since downloading all the E-Mails over IMAP will take a long time on my internet connection.\nAny good ideas?\n\nA: Export on the old Mac and Import on the new.\nAny mailbox (what looks like a folder in Mail's Sidebar) can be exported.  The steps I would use (skip 1 and 2 if your messages are already organised):\n\n*\n\n*Create a new mailbox in \"On My Mac\" by clicking on the + sign next to \"On My Mac\" in the sidebar.\n\n*Copy messages into the new mailbox.\n\n*Command-click on the mailbox and choose Export.\n\n*Choose the location for the exported mailbox.\n\nThis creates a folder containing the messages in mbox format.\nWhen you have transferred this folder to the new Mac, use Mail's Import command to import the messages. The newly imported messages will be in \"On My Mac\" and you can keep them there.\nAlternatively:\nImport directly from the old Mac's Library into the new Mac's Mail.\nThis has less steps but is more prone to error or confusion. With both Macs running on the same network:\n\n*\n\n*From the new Mac connect to the old Mac and locate the user's home directory.\n\n*Use Shift-Command-dot to show hidden folders.\n\n*Find Library/Mail.\n\n*Search in the subfolders for wanted mailboxes and import.\n\nIMAP enabled mailboxes.\nFor your mailboxes to which you can connect with IMAP, I recommend letting Mail download all the content. Trying to short circuit this download is prone to getting duplicates.\n", "Q: Force Safari to respect single word hostnames TLDR - Looking for a way to make Safari treat host/path as a URL instead of a search query.\nDetails:\nWith the conflagration of the address bar and search bar certain expected behaviors have ceased to work, in my case, if my computer has a search domain and/or hosts defined in /etc/hosts using just the hostname should be possible however in Safari unless the string entered in the address bar ends in a / it will always be treated as a search query.\nThough I would argue that this behavior breaks several standards1 all major browsers are currently guilty of this but:\n\n*\n\n*On Firefox2 there are several hidden settings that allow to either set certain words to always be treated as hostnames (and thus hostname/path as a URL) or even a setting to enable single word hostnames.\n\n*On Chrome after the first time you explicitly browse to any instance of hostname/ all subsequent visits to that hostname and any path (even those never visited) will be treated as a URL.\n\nOn Safari however even visiting a hostname/path that already was visited in the past will still be treated as a search query unless a / is appended or http(s):// is prepended, this is pretty frustrating, to put it mildly, it also makes creating something like golinks that will work on Safari that much more difficult.\nSo I'm looking for settings similar to Firefox to bypass/neutralize this behavior.\n1 As to how URIs (should) work, I would argue that if the string in the address bar contains a / an attempt should be made to resolve the substring before the / and if it resolves the string should be treated as a URL, if not by all means search.\n2 On FF I filed the following bug - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1754546\n\nA: The only workaround I found is to \"train\" safari to recognize go/ links. For the record, I'm using a custom go/ links solution, having a local DNS server and having configured appropriate search domains under network settings.\nI did it the following way:\n\n*\n\n*Copy https://go/ to clipboard\n\n*Repeatedly open new tabs, paste https://go/ into url, and hit Enter, close tab after it resolves\n\n*Repeatedly open new tabs, paste https://go/test (or whatever, it doesn't haven't to redirect anywhere but hopefully resolves to something), close tab\n\nNow, having done that around 15-20 times, if you open a new window or tab (even in private mode) and type in go/whatever (we don't have to explicitly specify the protocol or the FQDN) it will go through the https://go/ host - even though the URL dropdown may indicate that it is about to search through a configured search engine.\nNote that fortunately, the path which follows the go/ URL doesn't have to match any of the ones used during training.\nThis approach is working on Safari Version 16.1, and is extremely unintuitive and implicit to the point of discomfort. Once trained on your Mac, it does NOT carry over onto iOS - so iOS will require its own similar \"training\" which I have not tested yet and thus cannot confirm whether it is possible which I had just tested and confirmed to work.\n\nOn a personal note, this is an extremely annoying design decision on Apple's part. This means that anyone who visits my enterprise and connects to my network cannot follow the documented go/link instructions, whereas those who have \"trained\" their Safari can. Or worse, we would have to instruct users to do silly monkey tasks of pasting, entering, closing tabs; unacceptable. Meaning, we will have people with identical settings who experience different results when asked to enter go/onboarding or whatever, thus adding up to a nightmare for support and a perceived poor implementation by IT. Very frustrated by this.\n", "Q: Make my toggle-input-source shortcut always toggle input source If there are only two input sources and the next-input-source shortcut is cmd alt space, then\n\n*\n\n*cmd space to open spotlight\n\n*cmd alt space to toggle input source\n\n*cmd alt space to toggle input source\n\n*cmd space to close spotlight\n\nThe second not the original input source is now selected.

Is it safe and recommended to charge my Macbookpro with a usb-c charger that is 2 years old and has yellow stains at the tip?\n\n\nA: Is it recommended? No. It's always recommended to use a cable in good visual and functional condition to charge your likely expensive equipment.\nIs it safe? It depends. The age doesn't really matter. It appears that the issue is just surface discoloration to the sheathing of the cable, rather than penetrating to the wiring and components inside, but it could also be caused by overheating or stressing the cable. If you want to test it without risking damaging your Macbook, you could try it with an old discarded phone (with an adapter, perhaps) or some other device you no longer care about.\nRegardless, the longevity of the cable is likely diminished. If the discoloration is caused by chemical agents, it's more likely to crack or start fraying at the location of the stain in the future, reducing the useful life of the cable.\n", "Q: iphone \"could not be synced because the iPhone could not be found on the network.\" I charge my iPhone by connecting it by a cable to my Mac Mini; at which time it can sync and backup.\nThe iPhone shows up in the Finder's sidebar (it does this even when connected wirelessly), and from there I can use the Finder's interface to manual sync the phone.\nHowever, when I tried to sync it recently, I got an error message:\n\nThe iPhone “Ben’s iPhone” could not be synced because the iPhone could\nnot be found on the network.\n\nThis was a bit odd, as it was physically connected to the Mac.

The paragraph styles available by default in a newly created Pages document depends on the template you have chosen when creating the document. I reckon you have created the Pages document you are dealing with through a template which does not by itself provide a Heading paragraph style.\nThere are many different templates available in Pages such as Blank, Classic Letter, Essay, For Rent Flyer. You can see all of them initially when you launch Pages, or when you press  Command ⌘ + N  after Pages is launched, under categories such as Basic, Reports, Books as described in the Apple support webpage  called \"Create your first document in Pages on Mac\". Paragraph styles such as Heading, Heading 2, Heading 3 are available by default, for example, in documents created via the Blank template. Documents created through the Classic Letter template, on the other hand for example, do not have a Heading paragraph style by default.\nNote, however, paragraph styles with the same name available through different templates need not have the same characteristics. For example, the Heading 2 paragraph style available by default through the Blank template has the font Helvetica bold 16 pt while the Heading 2 available by default through the Essay template has the Baskerville regular 18 pt.\nAlso note that you can create your own paragraph styles after a document is created or modify those coming by default with a template as described in the Apple support webpage called \"Intro to paragraph styles in Pages on Mac\". You can also create custom templates and save them to create new documents as described in the Apple support webpage called \"Create and manage Pages templates on Mac\".\n\nA: Right upper corner > Format > Text > uppermost block with Style name (default is Body), click on down arrow and dropdown menu opens where style can be selected:\n\n", "Q: Mac Zip without \"surrounding Folder\" on PC?

before it could record a valid shutdown cause. This can happen for many reasons, but the most common reason is that there was suddenly insufficient electrical power available. This is seen frequently on systems as old as yours where the original battery has not yet been replaced. (See my answer in Apple battery issue or something else?) I suspect that you are probably near 1,000 power cycles by this point. (You can check in System Information.)\n-128 is difficult to debug directly because there is so little diagnostic information available in these cases. One thing you could try is replacing the battery. But that would be an experiment and no guarantee that it actually targets the root cause. If you are running the latest OS with the latest firmware updates and no third party hardware attached or kernel extensions installed, you're likely looking at a hardware failure. Run Apple Diagnostics and then bring your machine in to an Apple authorized repair center.\n", "Q: Family Sharing Purchases I am in the process of moving from an old Apple ID to a new one.\nI will refer to the old ID as ABC and the new one as XYZ.\nI currently have a family sharing setup on ABC with a couple of other family members.

I went through this exact scenarios a few days ago so here are my best tips to maximize an easy transition:\n\n*\n\n*Make a list of purchases you want to retain and check if they are compatible with family sharing (for IAPs)\n\n*Create your new ID if needed, setup a family account (best done on a new user account on macOS + iCloud Beta)\n\n*Add your family and your old account (you must have enough space for everyone for this to work or remove a family member from your life it's up to you :D)\n\n*Log out of iCloud on your devices that use your old ID, log with the new one and everything should either sync to your new ID or just stay there as it should\n\nHope this helps future readers!\n", "Q: Using macOS Terminal, how to batch rename dotfiles so that they become regular files?

I have not deliberately selected video though! I can't believe I would have accidentally clicked on video so many times!\n\nA: You're taking Live Photos. Windows cannot handle these properly as part of the photo, so the movie files are listed separately.\nSee Apple KB - Take and edit Live Photos which covers the iPhone aspect. Apple provides no support for them in Windows, so you have to handle them as two separate files.\nI don't know this for a fact, but this might be why the phone will not let Windows throw out half of what it considers a single Live Photo, from your other question - Why does File Explorer bring up permission errors, when I try to delete files from my iPhone on my Windows desktop?\n", "Q: Why does an M1 MBP incorrectly recognize a monitor that a 2015 MBP gets right? The M1 machine incorrectly detects the high res monitor in some way, and thus does not allow Display Scaling to work correctly.  There is some coverage of this issue, but I'm trying to understand why it happens.\nThe scenario:\ni.e. when the external monitor is set to full 4k, the text is tiny - and this is because OSX doesn't allow me to use the Display Scaling feature.\n\n*\n\n*Both machines are running the same version of MacOS (Monterrey).\n\n*The monitor is 4k (3840 x 2160), by UPERFECT, and has USB-C and HDMI ports.   The\n\n*MBPs each have USB and HDMI ports\n\n*The issue happens regardless of which combination of ports are use\n\nI understand that some people use BetterDummy to solve this problem, but I'm trying to understand Why it is happening.   I know this article makes some reference to the monitors being unrecognized, but what about them is different from a another monitor that works correctly?\nwith correct scaling\n\nincorrect scaling\n\n\nA: OSX Ventura (13.0 Beta (22A5266r)) now supports retina and limited scaling support via a setting called \"HiDPI\".  For some displays, it may only be visible by clicking \"Show All Resolutions\".\nUpgrading to the beta OS or waiting for the support to hit the mainline seems to be path for everyone now.\n\nA: In general terms, the \"why\" is simply because the two machines are vastly different.\nHardware, firmware, drivers, software, etc. on the Intel Mac and the M1 Mac for displays are simply vastly different. Apple reimplemented most of this part of the stack regarding detecting displays and recognising their capabilities for the Apple Silicon-based Macs.\nYou already have advise on how to actually solve the problem for you, so I'm not going to expand on that. However, if you would like the initial problem fixed, I will recommend reporting it to Apple as a bug. There's then hope it will be fixed in an upcoming release of macOS.\n", "Q: How to access commands included with macOS from macOS Recovery? Often, I boot to macOS Recovery only to find one of commands I wish to enter has not been included. For example, hexdump and nano are not included. However, if the volume containing macOS is mounted, the same version and not damaged, then there exists the possibility of accessing the missing commands from that volume. This requires knowing the path to the command. Therefore, I find myself locating the command by manually searching through the various directories or using the find command, which can be tedious and/or time consuming. Additionally, some commands can not be executed because the root directory is not the mount point of the volume containing macOS. An example would be the zsh command. Is there a better way to access the macOS commands from macOS Recovery? Here, macOS commands is meant to be a commands included with an installation of macOS.\n\nA: This answer was tested using OS X Mavericks, macOS High Sierra and macOS Monterey. OS X Mavericks was installed on a JHFS+ volume and macOS High Sierra was installed on a APFS volume. The Monterey release of macOS was used in the examples below.\n\nNote: In the examples below, the commands were entered in a Terminal window while booted to macOS Recovery for Monterey. When booting to macOS Recovery, the APFS volumes containing macOS Monterey are mounted read‑only on /Volumes/Macintosh HD and read/write on /Volumes/Macintosh HD - Data.\n\nA Method of Accessing macOS Commands\nBelow is the synopsis for getting location (location) of desired macOS commands (macOScommand ...). To be located, each command needs be in the search path determined by the supplied mount point (macOSmountpoint) and the value of the PATH variable. Additionally, the volume containing the macOS commands needs to be mounted on the supplied mount point.\nchroot macOSmountpoint which macOScommand ...\nThe search path is determined by prepending each directory in the colon‑separated list of directories output by echo $PATH command with the macOSmountpoint. The output from echo $PATH command is given below.\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nFor example, the /Volumes/Macintosh HD mount point and above PATH would make the search path to be the directories in the following order.\n/Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/usr/bin\n/Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/bin\n/Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/usr/sbin\n/Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/sbin\n\nBelow is a example of how to get the location of the hexdump command.\nchroot /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD which hexdump\n\nBelow is the output from the above command. This output is the location (location) of the hexdump command. Since the chroot command changes its root directory to the supplied mount point /Volumes/Macintosh HD, the supplied mount point does not appear in the output.\n/usr/bin/hexdump\n\nBelow is the synopsis for entering the located command.\nmacOSmountpoint/location [argument ...]\nBelow is a example of applying the hexdump command to the test.txt in the current working directory.\n/Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/usr/bin/hexdump test.txt\n\nAn Alternative Method of Accessing macOS Commands\nBelow is an alternate synopsis for entering the macOS command which does not require first locating the command.\nchroot macOSmountpoint macOScommand [argument ...]\nFor example, this alternative allows the previous two example commands given above to be replaced with the single command given below.\nchroot /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD hexdump \"$PWD/test.txt\"\n\nNote the following.\n\n*\n\n*Using $PWD works in the above command, because /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Volumes/Macintosh HD is a symbolic link to /.\n\n\n*If the current working directory resides outside of the /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD mount point, then remounting could be required. See the section below titled \"How to Remount When Necessary to Access One or More Files\".\n\n\n*Some macOS commands may only work as expected if this alternative form is used. The zsh command is one such command.\nBelow is an example of how to invoke a Z shell.\nchroot /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD zsh\n\nA shell invoked as shown above will not have access to the /dev directory. However, redirections can be used. For example, below involkes a Z shell which allows access to /dev/null through field descriptor 8.\nchroot /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD zsh 8>/dev/null\n\nHow to Remount When Necessary to Access a File\n\nNote: Any remounting only persists until the Mac restarts.\n\nIf a file to be accessed does not reside in the volume containing the macOS commands, then the corresponding mount point for volume containing the file may have to be moved. The directory of the new mount point will need to begin with the directory of the mount point assigned to the volume containing the macOS commands. For example, if the aforementioned test.txt file is stored in an APFS volume name MyAPFS, then the default mount point would be /Volumes/MyAPFS. Since this directory does not begin with /Volumes/Macintosh HD, the MyAPFS volume will need to be remounted. First, enter the command below to unmount the MyAPFS volume.\ndiskutil unmount /Volumes/MyAPFS\n\nExample output is shown below.\nVolume MyAPFS on disk2s7 unmounted\n\nNext, use the commands below to insure the new mount point exists, then mount the MyAPFS volume at that point. Here, the new mount point was chosen to be the same as when booted to Monterey. The identifier that is entered should be the same as the disk2s7 shown in the above output.\n\nNote: The commands below must be entered in a shell where the root directory is /.\n\nmkdir -p /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Volumes/MyAPFS\ndiskutil mount -mountpoint /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Volumes/MyAPFS disk2s7\n\n\nNote: Do to the design of Monterey, the contents of the /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Volumes directory is actual stored in the Macintosh HD - Data volume.\n\nExample output is shown below.\nVolume MyAPFS on disk2s7 mounted\n\n \n", "Q: Why does my iPhone create so many 1**APPLE folders to store .JPG and .MOV? I plugged in my iPhone into my Windows laptop, with a USB cable. Please see below.  1. Why does my iPhone create so many new separate folders?\n\n\n*Why do these folders contain merely .JPG and .MOV?\n\nDoubtless I did not create them! I prefer just one folder to store .JPG and .MOV! Clicking on each of these 85 folders wastes time!\n\n\nA: This is a folder structure common to camera manufacturers. For example, on an SD used with a Canon camera, you also find a DCIM folder with subfolders 100CANON, 101CANON, …\nA lot of image management apps understand this structure. It's not meant to be convenient to humans.\nThe reason why Apple creates so many of these folders is something we can only guess (unless there's an official document). Solar Mike's answer has a good reason, though.\n\nA: Each time you connect to transfer / backup, the new folder is created so old files are not overwritten by accident.\nThose filenames usually include the current date / time to make sure they are unique.\nIf you find that a disadvantage, just look on here for how many have lost files and data…\n", "Q: M1 Mac Mini Fails to Shutdown with APC UPS Options (Monterey 12.2.1) I have an M1 Mac Mini that needs to auto-shutdown after 60 seconds on the UPS.

To further test this, I purchased a second UPS unit from another brand (ChasePower Opal 850 - that specifically lists Mac OS compatibility) and it also only reports that the UPS is drawing power from the UPS (when unplugged from mains power) and will not shut the computer down no matter what options I try.\nUnless there are other solutions out there that I haven't been able to find, it appears that this functionality may be currently broken on OSX (12.2.1) with the M1 chip at least. My Mac Mini was freshly installed with OSX when purchased in late 2021 so I don't think your time machine migration is a necessarily a factor.\nI have an older (2012) Mac Mini Intel version at my office and I might try these UPS units with that next week to confirm if this issue doesn't happen with that processor (won't be the latest version of OSX however).\nPlease let me know if you have any luck getting this to work as this functionality is needed with a UPS.\nRegards, Paul\n", "Q: Sort 80,412 files into folders based on name begins with Situation:\n\n*\n\n*a folder with 80,412 files\n\n*all files named with CamelCase, some have a dash (-) separating the first word\n\n*files can be grouped by beginning with the same word or letters(i.e. \"ClientslistRebecca...\" and \"Clientslist-Adam...\")\n\n*no file name begins with a number\n\n*very few files begin with a unique word\n\nI need to take the first word, find all files that begin with that word, and create a folder named with that word.

Not sure how to resolve that, but I'm fine with doing some manual cleanup afterwards if I get folders with \"AWDRebecca\", \"AWDReports\", \"AWDNovember\", but having a folder \"A\" will make it harder.\n\nA: A shell snippet like\nfor i in *; do\n  case \"$i\" in\n    [A-Z][A-Z]*) # $i has several leading caps\n        dir=$(sed -E -e 's|([A-Z]+)[A-Z].*|\\1|' <<< \"$i\")\n        echo mkdir -p \"$dir\"\n        echo mv \"$i\" \"$dir\"/\n        ;;\n    [A-Z][a-z]*) # $i has one leading cap\n        dir=$(sed -E -e 's|([A-Z][a-z]+).*|\\1|' <<< \"$i\")\n        echo mkdir -p \"$dir\"\n        echo mv \"$i\" \"$dir\"/\n        ;;\n    *) echo \"Huh: $i\"\n       ;;\n  esac\ndone\n\nshould work. As written it will just print the commands on the screen. If they look sensible, remove the four echo before mkdir/mv.\nAlso, for 80'000 files, the for i in * part may fail. If this is the case, run it in batches with for i in [A-E]*, for i in [F-K]* etc.\nPS: It will fail for files with a ALLCAPS name. If you have does, please comment so I can add another rule.\n", "Q: FileVault and erasing SSD: disk utility didn’t ask for any code or password to erase despite FileVault being on I am trying to sell my MacBook Pro 2011 and want to erase the SSD for good. It’s running High Sierra. Despite what Apple says, I read it’s better to have FileVault turned on and then erase the machine.\nUnfortunately, before I realised I should have done this, I had already erased the machine without FileVault on at all. After reading these articles I then turned on FileVault, (effectively had a blank macOS without any files) which generated a key, then I erased it again. However, when I went to erase it the second time via Internet Recovery Mode (I don’t want to re add my iCloud password to reinstall macOS), it certainly said the drive was AFPS (encrypted) where the word encryption was new to me, however it didn’t ask me to “unlock” the SSD at all. I was just able to click erase and it just said something like “are you sure you want to do this?” And as per usual I formatted it back into the usual AFPS format. The now new macOS has FileVault turned off again.\nNow I’m concerned that the FileVault didn’t even work given I was able to erase and format the SSD without a passcode or key despite FileVault being on. Shouldn’t it stop me from doing these sorts of things by asking for a key? Note I never used FileVault before this and erased it once without having FileVault, so did I stuff up the process?\nThanks.\n\nA: The process worked as designed - you didn’t cause any issues with the double formatting.\nFileVault is software designed to protect the data on your disk from being read by others that do not have the decryption password. However, FileVault does not protect the disk from being erased, even without the password, as you have seen.\n", "Q: Forgot Apple Password My iPhone is \"Locked to owner\". I bought this phone brand new from store. It's been over a week, still no call nor wait time. No email with information sent.\nApple Support nor Apple store can't help with this process,\nI need contact information for the Recovery department to  help me straighten this out.I  don't k how what to do\n\nA: We are not Apple so all we can offer are recommendations on how to proceed.\nI assume that the owner the phone is locked to is not you. So the options you have are\n\n*\n\n*Take the phone back to the store you bought it from and request either a replacement or your money back (because you obviously can't use the phone)\n\n*Take the phone to an Apple Store together with proof of purchase and have it unlocked.\n\n", "Q: Tab Group Confusion – How do I leave Tabs like I found them? I'm confused about Tab Groups, the new feature of Monterey. When I go to a tab group, I'm generally going to open up the home page of a website (which is what I desire & how I set it up).\nBut if I go to a different web page on a particular tab, or add another tab, then when I leave the group, the tab group is changed to show the last state of the tabs I was using, and any other tabs I'd added which don't necessarily reflect the tab group!\nThe next time I go to the group, I won't be going to the home page (which would be my preference). How to I open up a tab group and work with the tabs without changing how the tab group opens the next time??\n\nA: Use bookmarks instead.\nTab groups are intended to help keep different browsing sessions organized; for example, to keep your cooking tabs separate from your school tabs. They keep state because they are simply 'containers' within the main browser.\nBookmarks, on the other hand, allow you to keep a set of tabs in the same state that you saved them. You can easily open a whole folder of bookmarks at once by clicking \"open in new tabs\" from the bookmarks menu.\n\n", "Q: macOS Show Preview Panel in File Chooser Dialogs In Finder, I have the option of seeing a Preview Panel. This shows file details and image thumbnails when I select a file in the Finder, and is very useful.\nI also want to see the Preview Panel in file chooser dialog windows. For example, if I am working in Google Chrome, and I want to upload an image to some web page, and I click on an Upload button in the page, a file chooser dialog window appears. This file chooser looks just like Finder, but there does not seem to be an option to show the Preview Panel. This is inconvenient because I can't see which image is which in the chooser.\n\nA: If you choose Column View in file dialogs, you should see the preview pane.\nQuick Look should also work in file dialogs, by pressing Space, and image files in Icon View should show an icon of their content.\n", "Q: How can I have Numbers autofill interpolated values between two cells? How can I have Numbers autofill interpolated values in a range of selected cells (from the value of the first cell to the value of the last cell)?\nI know how to do this with a formula but it's too awkward as I do this quite frequently. Therefore, I would like to use the Autofill function, or similar. But it doesn't seem to be intelligent enough to interpolate.\nEx:\n[7] […] […] […] [10]  ➾  [7] [7.75] [8.5] [9.25] [10]\n\nA: You can do that using the autofill feature that can be accessed only using a mouse or a keyboard shortcut in Numbers. (Technically, it is extrapolation but I reckon it would do the job.) An autofill feature is also available through the Numbers menu (Table -> Autofill Cells) but that one can not handle sequences.\nFor a range of cells in a column to be automatically filled in based on a sequence, first manually fill in at least the first two cells in the range. Then select those two cells, a.k.a. example cells, and move the mouse pointer over the bottom border of the example cells so that a yellow autofill handle (a dot) appears. Then hover the mouse pointer over the yellow handle so that the mouse pointer becomes a two-way arrow. When the two-way arrow appears, assuming you are right-handed, left-click on the mouse so that the outer borders of the example cells also turn into yellow and drag the yellow handle along with the two-way arrow over to the last cell of the range to be filled in and release the mouse. You can also have cells above the example cells automatically filled in as well as cells in a row.\nAs an example, take a look at the gif below (decimal points appear as commas because I use Continental Europe number formatting). Further details on the mouse-enabled autofill feature in Numbers as well as directions on accessing it using a keyboard shortcut are available in this Apple support webpage called \"Autofill cells in Numbers on Mac\".\n\n", "Q: Is VMware Fusion Player a suitable substitute for Bootcamp? The goal is to be setup a Catlina (iMac 27-inch 2015, 32GB core i7) Machine with USB Fax Modem capability.  I have an Apple USB Fax Modem, however I am open to the idea of purchasing the US Robotics as prescribed in these instructions:\nhttps://machow2.com/fax-from-mac-modem/\nThe instructions call for installing El Capitan with Boot camp.   I have installed an El Capitan VM on VMware Fusion player.\nIs there some necessary advantage with Boot Camp over VMware Fusion player for said exercise?\nThe instructions indicates that the Apple Modem works only with OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and below.\n\nA: You can install El Capitan on your model Mac to dual boot with your existing Catalina. Installing El Capitan would not involve the use the Boot Camp Installer. As you have already stated, you can also install El Capitan in a VMware Fusion player virtual machine. Note the following.\n\n*\n\n*Using VM would allow you to use El Capitan and Catalina at the same time. With a dual boot, you would have to restart to switch between the two operating systems.\n\n*El Capitan in a VM may not be fast enough to be used for Faxing. Or, you may have to allocate enough resources (such as memory or processors) to the VM so that Catalina be unacceptable slow. With a dual boot arrangement, El Capitan and Catalina would not share resources other than disk space.\n\n*With a VM there could exist a hardware (or virtual hardware) incompatibility which would prevent Faxing.\n\nThe necessary advantage with dual boot over VMware Fusion player for said exercise would occur if a VM arrangement did not work. This could occur if there is insufficient performance or a hardware (or virtual hardware) incompatibility the would not exist with a dual boot arrangement.\n", "Q: Can I enable \"Hey Siri\" only when using AirPods? I have \"Hey Siri\" turned on so I can use my phone hands-free when my AirPods are in (if I'm running, washing dishes, etc.). But I'd prefer not to have it listening all the time.\nIs there a way to configure \"Hey Siri\" so it only listens through AirPods, but is otherwise disabled?\n\nA: It doesn’t appear that is a feature that can be enabled only on the AirPods. According to the support page it must be enabled on whatever device (iPhone, Mac, etc) they are connected to to work.\nAccording to Apple all dictation is processed locally on device though they do have a transcript log sent to Apple with a random identifier assigned. This is different than the audio recordings you can opt in allowing in the Analytics & Improvement setting’s page. You can delete request history associated by going to Settings > Siri & Search > Siri & Dictation History and tapping Delete Siri & Dictation History.\n", "Q: Factory reset Apple bluetooth device in Monterey Under older versions of macOS, holding Shift+Option while clicking the Bluetooth dropdown menu would yield additional options, including a \"Debug\" > \"Factory reset all connected Apple devices\" option, and a per-device \"Factory Reset\" option for Apple devices.\nIn Monterey, these options are both missing. These are at times necessary, for example to fix lag from an Apple keyboard (which is not solved by resetting the bluetooth module).\nHow can we perform these operations in Monterey?\n\nA: Restart and hold down Shift to enter Safe Boot mode, to flush caches.\nThen delete this file: /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist\nReboot normally then re-pair your device(s).\nYou may also wish to file Feedback with Apple requesting that this functionality (present in Big Sur and earlier) is restored in a future macOS release.\n", "Q: How can I restore my Finder Sidebar Icons? I had to rename my user and home folder recently, but did it according to the official guide from Apple. Initially, all icons in the sidebar of Finder appeared as a generic folder. Removing and re-adding them fixed the issue for all icons, except the Desktop icon.\n\n\nWhat I've tried/checked\n\n*\n\n*The account name and home folder name are the same (also in cAsE)\n\n*The home folder is set correctly for the account\n\n*I've rebooted\n\n*I've rebooted in safe mode\n\n*I've cleared the PRAM\n\nDid anyone run into the same issue yet and was able to fix it? Running macOS 12.2.1 on a 16-inch 2021 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: I was having the exact same problem as yourself, every icon except the desktop icon showed correctly. I tried all the recommendations above and none of them worked for me either.\nHowever I did manage to fix this is the end.\nUnder iCloud Drive, I enabled the Desktop & Documents folder. This will cause the Desktop and Documents sidebar icons to move underneath the iCloud section instead of Favourites. Once they have moved, you will need to drag the Desktop and Documents icons back up into the Favourites section.\nOnce all this is done you can disable the Documents and Desktop folders in iCloud Drive and the icon issue should be fixed.\n\nA: Have you tried cleaning the Icon Services cache?\nhttps://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/02/01/clearing-the-icon-services-cache-in-mojave/\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/2019/01/30/why-doesnt-that-documents-icon-display-properly-beyond-quicklook/\n", "Q: Should I format an external hard drive before installing macOS on it? I erased the internal disk of my MacBook Air (2016). Since there is no OS anymore, I turn it on in the recovery mode (Cmd + R) and want to install the macOS Sierra on a 2 TB external hard drive.\nIn the past, I partitioned such hard drive and allocated 500 Gb to Time Machine backups and the rest for my files. If now I install the macOS, do I need to format it or the OS will be installed on the free space (there is still a lot of space).\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: You'd be better off formatting the drive prior to installing the OS.\nThe macOS Installer will allow you to choose from any available and compatible partitions (you may need to click 'Show All Disks').\n\nA: Adding on to @da4, make sure to partition the disk, not make APFS containers. This will give fixed size boundaries to each, instead of creating a weird scenario where you don't have any space left on your hard drive because TM consumed all of it.\n\nA: Here are step by step instructions to use recovery OS to erase any disk attached to your Mac.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208496\nThe utility menu looks a little different on sierra, but look for utilities in the boot screen menu bar.

I'm wondering whether it has still been gathering this charging data over the last 6 months even though the feature has been disabled. Thanks.\n\nA: It won’t matter that you had it off - turn it in and the immediate effects will start and make changes to the charge rate. The big improvement is delaying the fast charge due to temperature while charging (which is immediate) and over a week, it will optimize better based on your wake up schedule, but the algorithm is effective right from the get go for babying the battery charge.\nAs it builds confidence you don’t need a full charge every morning it will start to avoid charging past 80% at first and then maybe even charge less each night if it’s confident you don’t need lots of energy every day.\n", "Q: Will background apps run during screensaver?

The issue is similar to the one in this question:\nBlack screen on MacBook Pro login\nAt the support they told me it can be the GPU and they asked for 600 $ to repair it!\nDid it happen to someone else who found a cheaper way to solve this? For example, I’ve seen some videos that show how to open the Mac and try to fix this issue:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKejJwQ3MGU\nThank you very much in advance for your help! It’s really appreciated.\n\nEdit after @cmason comment: if I connect the MacBook Pro to and external monitor (in my case a projector I use often in combination with Mac) I can see my Desktop AFTER logging in, and everything works as usual.\n\nA: Apparently, there is a worldwide warranty for this type of problem. It refers to the first MacBook Pro released in the same period as mine, since they can come with a flaw related to the screen.\nYou can find all the details here: https://support.apple.com/13-inch-macbook-pro-display-backlight-service?fbclid=IwAR1fWw-jfSqmA_3IUQDQZDYWN1pFYCycXlAnmCllco20qXvXH8TeCDOJZzA\nToday I went to an authorized Apple center, told them about my problem and this warranty (along with the fact that with an external monitor everything was working) and they will change the screen for free.\n", "Q: Use iCloud Drive as a backup of finished work I have hundreds, if not thousands of completed projects on my Mac. I backup to an external hard-drive, using Time Machine. And once a month to a different external hard-drive, again using Time Machine, which I store off-site.\nI would also like to use iCloud Drive to backup my completed projects to.\nI presume all I would need to do is copy over the complete projects to the iCloud Drive folder? The projects will then be on my Macs hard drive AND a copy on iCloud?\nIs this correct or am I missing something?\nI don't need to synch the files with another computer or device. I don't need to backup documents I'm working on. All I want is to backup finished work to the cloud.\nUPDATE\nIf I copy over my completed work to the iCloud Drive folder, I fear this will take up twice the amount of hard-disk space on my Mac: on my local work folder AND in the iCloud Drive folder. Even if I turn on 'Optimise Mac Storage' documents in the iCloud Drive folder will only be stored in iCloud when space is needed. I have just about enough space, so hence my work will take up TWICE the amount of hard disk space.\nAll I want is to store a copy of my work off-site on Apple servers. Any ideas how to do this?\nUPDATE 2\nIt seems that there is no way to store copies of files on iCloud Drive ONLY on Apple servers in the cloud (without them also taking up room on my Macs local hard-drive).\nSo instead I'm going to use OneDrive. I'd prefer to use Apple, but I can't.\n\nA: iCloud Drive appears as another 'hard drive' on the Mac, so it would function much like an external drive. So in your case, copying those projects to iCloud Drive would indeed work. It would function as a form of backup, in the sense an external hard drive would, with the benefit of it being offsite.\nOf course, this does not include the syncing and automation functions of backup software, but it would be a fine idea as a secondary copy of older projects.\nPersonally I would not use just iCloud, nor any other single storage form as my only backup, I would prefer an additional backup methods as well, just in case.\n\nA: As long as you copy the files to the iCloud folder you should then have 3 versions: 1 in your local work folder, 1 in the iCloud Drive folder on your Mac (iCloud may delete this local version to make room, depending on settings), and 1 stored off-site on Apple's servers.\n", "Q: Is there a way to force preview to open files in the center of the screen Whenever I open a pdf file with preview the window goes automatically to the most left side of the screen, is there a way to make it open files in the center?

I have my Mac configured to automatically delete objects 30 days after they have been moved to Trash (at Finder > Preferences > Advanced > Remove items from the Trash after 30 days).\nHowever, I have files in Trash of which I think that they have been moved there more than 30 days ago. Now I'm wondering how macOS keeps track of when an item has been moved to Trash, and how I can check that?\n\nUpdate\nWith regard to \"where is the information stored\", terminal command mdls is said to reveal meta data attributes of which one named kMDItemDateAdded is said to hold the date added value. However, I've tried a few files in my Trash, and none of them seems to have that attribute. Others I tried where ls -ale and xattr, but to no avail.\n\nA: There's a Date Added column if you open the Trash in Finder. If you don't see it, switch to List view  Cmd ⌘   2 , right click any header & add it from the list. Click any header to sort by it.\n\nI don't know how to grab this data by any other method, but it's easy enough to either scroll down, or flip the list by clicking the header a second time, so oldest sorts to the top.\n\nA: This may not be the solution you are looking for, but you could create a Folder Action to attach to your \"/Users/your_shortname/.Trash\" folder which logs the file name and date of every item sent to the Trash.\nThis following AppleScript Folder Action code will create the file \"Files_Added_To_Trash.log\" on your Desktop, (if it does not already exist) and writes the file name and date it was added to the Trash folder, to it.\nPaste this following code into a new Script Editor.app document and save it as \"Log_Trashed_Files.scpt\" to your \"/Users/your_shortname/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts\" folder.\nSaving the file to that location will make it available in your \"Folder Actions Setup.app\" and when right clicking on a folder in Finder and choosing  \"Folder Actions Setup\"\nproperty addedToTrashLog : (path to desktop as text) & \"Files_Added_To_Trash.log\"\n\non adding folder items to theFolder after receiving theNewItems\n    --  Called after items have been added to a folder\n    --  theFolder is a reference to the modified folder\n    --  theNewItems is a list of references to the items added to the folder \n    repeat with thisFile in theNewItems\n        set currentDate to (current date) as string\n        tell application \"System Events\" to set theFile to name of thisFile\n        set theText to theFile & \" was sent to the Trash on \" & currentDate\n        do shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of theText & \" >> \" & ¬\n            quoted form of POSIX path of addedToTrashLog\n    end repeat\nend adding folder items to\n\non removing folder items from theFolder after losing removedItemNames\n    --  Called after items have been removed from a folder\n    --  theFolder is a reference to the modified folder\n    --  removedItemNames is a list of names of items removed from the folder\n    \n    (* You may want to add code to this section which removes the log entry\n    from the \"Files_Added_To_Trash.log\" file for the files that get emptied from\n    the Trash folder. *)\nend removing folder items from\n\nIn Finder, simply right click on the .Trash folder in your Home directory and select Services/Folder Actions Setup...

Is there a way to access old notes that you forgot the password to? Without touch ID or face ID? I've tried every combo I could think of.\n\nA: It's not very clear if your Notes are on a local device or iCloud whose password you forgot.\n\n*\n\n*If you are asking about retrieving your Notes that have synced to iCloud, then you must be able to first log in to your iCloud account with the account that owns these notes. There is no other way to retrieve these notes even if they are not locked with an additional password.\n\n\n*If the Notes are stored in your local device but you forgot the passcode of your device, then you also need to first be able to get into your iOS device to access the Notes. So, unfortunately, there is no way to retrieve your Notes if you lost access. Instead of the native Notes app, you may consider using EverNote, Google Keeps or other cross-platform note applications instead where you can reset your account when you forget the password.\n", "Q: Disable / enable amfid on per-application basis I want to create and manage snapshots on my Data partition, but because I don't have a developer certificate and apple-granted entitlements (like com.apple.developer.vfs.snapshot), I have to either disable amfid entirely (nvram boot-args=\"amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1\") which would allow me to run the ad-hoc signed binary or give up using the tool, both of which I would rather prefer to avoid. I've heard the amfi is an important security feature?\nIs there a way to disable amfi on a per-app basis, i.e. configure it to skip checking certain application's signature and run it directly?\nThe program I'm trying to use is https://github.com/ahl/apfs.\n\nA: No, unfortunately the macOS kernel does not include functionality that would allow you to excempt specific programs from AMFI checks.\nA third party solution has been made here:\nhttps://github.com/osy/AMFIExemption\nBasically this works by adding a third-party kernel extension to the system that lets you setup a whitelist of entitlements that are left unchecked. I.e. you can specify that programs can have the com.apple.developer.vfs.snapshot snapshot without a valid signature from Apple.\nNote that this means that other programs than your own are also exempt from checking this particular entitlement.\nA compatibility note: You write that this needs to work on macOS Monterey. I haven't tested the kernel extension on Monterey, so it might not be updated for that. It has been tested to work on Big Sur (the version before Monterey).\nAnother possibility that works without a kernel extension is to manually patch the running amfid program (that actually performs the entitlement checks) in memory to allow any entitlement in binaries signed by your Developer ID key instead of only allowing Apple's.\nA script to do just that on Sierra has been posted here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/pvieito/c0c9b8fd73255b57927b273d329c5800\nNote that you need to have SIP disabled before you can do this, as otherwise you cannot change the contents of memory owned by the amfid process.\nNote that the script only works on Sierra. The author has published a blog post on how the script works. To update the script for Monterey, you would need to follow the same steps to locate the correct location of the instruction inside amfid to modify.\n", "Q: Does FileVault technically require SIP?

It was clear to me that the issue was happening before .zshrc was loaded. My advice to anybody with a zsh issue look at all the components of zsh. From the article my guess is it was either .zlogin or .zprofile. zlogin was empty whereas .zprofile had over 2000 lines of eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\".

In MacOS, each folder has a hidden .DS_Store file. If I compress a folder on MacOS, the zip file will contain those .DS_Store files. What information is contained in those files, and does it expose any information about me, my device, my other files, etc?\n\nA: Unless you have specifically included private information in those files, then no, it usually not considered a privacy risk to share them.\n.DS_Store files contain metadata attributes that Finder want to store, but cannot store directly for each file or directory (for example if the file system does not support such attributes). This is typically things such as the (x,y)-coordinates of the file icon (i.e. if you move them around in the Finder window), colored tags if you apply those, custom icons you might have chosen for files, etc.\nNote for others: The .DS_Store file can contain names of files and subfolders in this particular folder, which you might consider private. For this particular question, those files and subfolders are included in the compressed archive to be shared, so they aren't private.\n", "Q: When diskutil mount vs mount?

It is not so that it is looking for x86_64 versions of files - it is telling you plainly that it did not find arm64 versions of those symbols.\nThat is because you forgot to actually link the sundials library in. So there's no sundial symbols at all - for any architecture.\nYou can link in the library by using the -l argument for g++. I.e. change your command to something like this:\ng++ -I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sundials/5.8.0/include/ user-data.cpp -o main -lsundials_cvodes\n\nThe library might be called something slightly different, it could also be that you want -lsundials_nvecserial, -lsundials_cvode or similar, depending on what you're trying to do.\nYou might need to link multiple libraries depending on your own source code. Check the list of libraries installed in the sundials folder for \"inspiration\".\nDepending on your setup, you might need to let the compiler know where to find the library using the -L argument. For example:\ng++ -I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sundials/5.8.0/include/ user-data.cpp -o main -lsundials -L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sundials/5.8.0/lib\n\nor something similar depending on your specific setup.\n", "Q: AMD Radeon Pro 555X and Myst Selentic Age Mazerunner Cyan advised that some AMD GPUs have a driver issue that causes the Mazerunner to be unplayable (interior of the vessel very dark).

So if you want a backup, you should download items from iCloud into regular folders on your PC that you can click open and view.\n\nThere are also other ways, but this is the most straightforward.\n\n\n*Special format media: Live photos, bursts etc. only work within the Apple ecosystem. You can convert Live Photos into videos, then download on PC. To do this, open Photos > select Live photo > tap the Share button at bottom left > select 'Save as video' option. Bursts are intended to let you choose the best photo(s) and discard the rest.

In Settings > Privacy > \"Full Disk Access\" Chrome and all major browsers I tried are allowed full access - that's what Google suggested.\n\nA: The 'greyed out' files are entirely normal behaviour for file dialogs.\nIn an Open file dialog, greyed files are those that cannot be selected for opening, e.g. the wrong file type for the application.\nIn a Save file dialog, files are greyed out, because similarly, they are not for 'selecting'; you're adding something else to them.\nIf you want to overwrite an existing file, you can click on a file, and its name will be placed in the text field for the filename.\nThere is no way of changing this behaviour (that I know), so I'm surprised when you say you were able to 'fix it'.

My intention is to collect their devices, wipe them clean, then donate them to a local charity resettling Afghan refugees in the immediate area.\nErasing HDDs I understand.  Erasing SSDs is where I need guidance.\nI suspect all the donated computers will be 2016 or before and most will be laptops.\nI read that if I turn on FileVault, encrypt the SSD, boot into Recovery mode and erase the SSD, that will be the equivalent of securely erasing an HHD with one or two passes writing ones and zeros.\nIs this correct - I feel a very strong obligation to those donating old computers to get this right.\n\nA: You describe cryptographic erasure well.\nRotating the encryption key ensures data written with that key is unrecoverable. You might go one further by writing legitimate and non-personal data to fill the drive once you encrypt it. Maybe a selection of YouTube videos you downloaded so that all addressable sectors have data overwritten if you can’t be sure FileVault was enabled when the data you hope to make unrecoverable was written.\n\n*\n\n*Do an erase install - enable FileVault with a secure, throwaway complex password (like three long words)\n\n*Copy actual files to fill the drive\n\n*Repeat the erase install and don’t set up the new Mac\n\nNothing can go back and re-encrypt spare blocks on the storage (the non-addressable storage part), but these steps ensure any subsequent file recovery returns your actual test files and not the previous owners data had they not encrypted the machine before copying data to it. Only vendor specific drive wipes or physical destruction can cover non-addressable storage being swapped back into service.\nTo ”get this right” you will want to ensure you let non-T2 era macs complete the FileVault encryption after copying data and before the second erase to ensure all blocks are rewritten. Also, you will need to track the version of macOS used to be sure your efforts are the best possible for each era of hardware.\n\nA: No, it is \"almost\" correct - but not entirely true.\nThe idea behind what is here called \"cryptographic erasure\" is that you encrypt the SSD before using it at all. The key for the encryption is not stored on the drive itself, but elsewhere in a place that allows for secure erasure (on a Mac this is usually in a T1, T2 or M1 chip, but on older Macs this relies on the user having a passphrase that is not easy to brute force). After you have used your computer and filled the drive with personal data, you can effectively erase it all in a safe manner by disposing of the key only.\nHowever this only works in an optimal fashion for the data that is stored after the drive is encrypted.\nWhat happens in your scenario is that you have an SSD filled with potentially personal data that is unencrypted. Then you encrypt the drive, overwriting all addressable data with basically random data (that is really just encrypted \"nothings\") - and then you forget the encryption key used - making those \"nothings\" unreadable.\nYou might think that this is the same as overwriting a traditional harddisk with random data - but it is not.\nThe reason is that SSDs have storage that is not addressable by the operating system. The SSD controller continually swaps blocks in and out of being addressable - which means that some personal data could have been stored in blocks that are now not addressable - and thus not possible to erase by overwriting from the operating system.\nIf you had encrypted the disk before using it and done a \"cryptographic erasure\" by erasing the key - this would have worked well, as even the unaddressable data would be un-encryptable as the key is gone. However, in your scenario the unaddressable data is still there.\nNote that it is not easy for others to actually get to that un-addressable personal data. It is entirely unlikely that if gifted to for example an average home user that reinstalls macOS and uses the computer in an ordinary manner, would ever see that old data. Things are different though, if the computer is gifted to a computer professional or someone who is willing to spend resources on digging out the old data.\nThis is why modern SSD drives come with a special command for this particular situation. The command is often referred to as \"Secure Erase\" or in newer SSDs as \"Enhanced Secure Erase\". You should be wary though that this particular command has been shown to be very poorly implemented on many consumer SSDs, so you actually need to verify that it is a good implementation before relying on it.\nIn your scenario you're probably only dealing with Apple-sold SSDs (although you might see computers that have been upgraded by third parties). If this had been a local business here seeking to comply with laws such as the European GDPR, such pre-2016 SSDs would have been assesed to having no or non-functional Secure Erase methods, and would therefore have been physically destructed and replaced with new disks before reuse of the computer. This is not a terrible waste since a 7+ year old SSD is probably nearing the end of its life time anyway.\nHowever, I can understand that in a donation scenario, replacing disks is not possibly. I would recommend that you make it clear to donaters that you do reasonable attempts to clear their drive of personal data by overwriting it (for example 5 passes), while making clear it is not a 100% guarantee of data erasure. Then everyone can make an informed choice.\n", "Q: \"ls\" works, but \"ls -l\" gives me \"Operation not permitted\" There are several folders on my system (Monterey 12.2.1) on which I can successfully run ls, but if I run ls -l on the same folder I get \"Operation not permitted\".\nI am running these commands as root, and Terminal has full disk access.\nI found this because timemachine can't back up these files, and I have no explanation as to why this would happen.\nHere's an example:\n # ls /private/var/folders/44/26mm0l190mn7sf9xj5gmn3wh0000gp/0/com.apple.routined\ndv\n# ls -l /private/var/folders/44/26mm0l190mn7sf9xj5gmn3wh0000gp/0/com.apple.routined\nls: dv: Operation not permitted\ntotal 0\n\nPermissions and extended attributes on the parent directory seem normal:\n# ls -ld@ /private/var/folders/44/26mm0l190mn7sf9xj5gmn3wh0000gp/0/com.apple.routined\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 aaroni  staff  96 Jun 24  2020 /private/var/folders/44/26mm0l190mn7sf9xj5gmn3wh0000gp/0/com.apple.routined\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The \"dv\" you're seeing here is, as I recall, \"datavault\". Apple has in general been moving away from standard Unix conventions to a more \"rootless\" system based on entitlements instead of user permissions. My guess is that the files you're looking at belong to routined (a daemon which tries to figure out things you do often) and you would need an entitlement in order to access them. There are a number of other directories protected in this way, for example everything in /System as well as e.g. iMessage database files.\n\nA: \nI can successfully run ls, but if I run ls -l on the same folder I get \"Operation not permitted\".\n\nDifference between ls and ls -l\nls displays the name of the files/directories contained in a directory, while ls -l displays a lot of more information (excerpt from man ls):\nIf the -l option is given, the following information is displayed for each\nfile: file mode, number of links, owner name, group name, number of bytes\nin the file, abbreviated month, day-of-month file was last modified, hour\nfile last modified, minute file last modified, and the pathname.\n\nUsually, read access to the parent directory should be enough to get this information, but in this particular case (SIP enabled and datavault flag set, see below), it's not.\nFor example, to get the number of links, you need to know the inode number. You can get that information with ls -i, and you will see it fails for a number of files and directories (and consequently ls -l will fail for those files/directories, too):\nls -i  /private/var/folders/51/y66nwk4x1b700xgy1fs5d_9w0000gq/0/\n\nls: com.apple.LaunchServices.dv: Operation not permitted\nls: com.apple.SharedWebCredentials: Operation not permitted\nls: com.apple.lockoutagent: Operation not permitted\nls: com.apple.nsurlsessiond: Operation not permitted\nls: dmd: Operation not permitted\n18693497 com.apple.ScreenTimeAgent  18701711 com.apple.corespeechd      18688786 com.apple.icloud.searchpartyd  18687284 com.apple.progressd\n18693950 com.apple.Spotlight        18687828 com.apple.dmd          18687147 com.apple.notificationcenter   18691540 com.apple.routined\n18688254 com.apple.bird         18702008 com.apple.dock.launchpad   11150084 com.apple.pluginkit\n\nOn the other hand, ls simply displays filenames, and that information can be retrieved for all files.\nWhy doesn't sudo ls -l work?\nsudo let's you run commands as root:\n$ sudo whoami\nroot\n\nbut root is no longer an almighty user: since OS X 10.11 \"El Capitan\", its powers are restricted by System Integrity Protection (SIP):\n\nSystem Integrity Protection restricts the root user account and limits the actions that the root user can perform on protected parts of the Mac operating system.\n\nBefore System Integrity Protection, the root user had no permission restrictions, so it could access any system folder or app on your Mac. Software obtained root-level access when you entered your administrator name and password to install the software. That allowed the software to modify or overwrite any system file or app.\n\nSystem Integrity Protection includes\nprotection for these parts of the system:\n\n*\n\n*(...)\n\n*/var\n\n\nso /var is one of the protected folders that root has no longer unrestricted access to.\nBut there's more going on: disabling SIP makes these files accessible to root and to the owner. All files that couldn't be read have the extended attribute com.apple.rootless set, which marks them as being protected by SIP, but they also have the datavault flag enabled, for example:\nls -ledD@ com.apple.LaunchServices.dv\n\ndrwx------@ 4 jaume  staff  datavault 128 Jan 17 10:35 com.apple.LaunchServices.dv\n    com.apple.rootless   27 \n\nwhich makes them unreadable except for apps with the corresponding entitlement (when SIP is disabled, access is again governed by mode and ownership, as in a traditional UNIX-like file system).\n\nI found this because timemachine can't back up these files\n\n/private/var/folders stores transient data and its contents are not backed up by Time Machine.\n", "Q: macOS Shortcuts \"Allow Running Scripts\" preference keeps turning off I have a simple shortcut set up in the menu bar that runs a shell script. However, every time I run the shorcut for the first time after startup, I get a notification that the shortcut cannot be run because the action is a \"scripting action\" and the shortcut security setting does not allow this action to be run.\nIt then prompts me to check the \"Allow Running Scripts\" preference in the Shortcuts app preferences. This is fine, however, after quitting the Shortcuts app, the preference seems to undo itself and I get the same notification that the shortcut cannot run and have to re-check the checkbox in the preferences again.\nIs this a bug with the Shortcuts App? Or is there something that I am doing wrong? (I am currently running macOS Monterey 12.1)\n\n\n\n\nA: As pointed out by jaume, this seems to be a bug with the Shortcuts app. This bug appears to be fixed as of macOS Monterey version 12.2.1\n", "Q: How to record a screen with video AND audio on a Mac? I am using a Mac 10.14.6 and I want to record the full screen with both video and audio.\nThe reason is that I want to record a video from a German TV company, and neither youtube-dl work (there are DRM issues), nor a python script to download all .ts files during watching the livestream. So I figured the only possibility is to record the full screen for the duration of the video, like 3 hours.\nTo record the full screen I tried the QuickTime Player which was able to record the video, but no audio. Also, after recording only 5 minutes of the screen the size of the final 5-minute clip was about 2 GB (yes, 2 GB). That is WAAAAAAAY beyond anything reasonable.\nSo is there ANY other way, free tool, python tool, selenium-python possibility etc etc to record and/or download a 3 hour livestream from a webpage into a reasonable  sized file (1-2 GB Max) with audio?\n\nA: Recording the screen with sound using QuickTime Player can be done by the following methods.\n\n*\n\n*If you have audio input and output hardware (builtin or otherwise), then you can physically connect the output to input. I have done this using a 2011 iMac. The jacks are shown in the image below.\n\n\n\n*There is software that can redirect the sound heard from the speakers so this sound can be recorded by QuickTime while QuickTime is recording video from the screen. SoundFlower and BlackHole both are free software which can do this. BlackHole is probably the better choice. If you choose to install SoundFlower you should read this question.\nSaving from QuickTime as a .mov file does take a lot of space. You can convert to a different format to save space. There are various mov to mp4 converters are available on the web or from the App Store. For example, I used the Free MP3 Converter by AnMP4 Studio to convert a 10.82 GB mov file made with QuickTime to a 1.26 GB mp4 file.\n", "Q: iTerm2 I want to list a directory and navigate its content with the arrow keys I wonder if it is at all possible when I list a directory using say ls -1, I would like to use the up & down keys to navigate the folder documents and open them when I hit Enter.\nI've been searching for this kind of stuff to no success.\n\nA: You can install Oh My Zsh which is the best for such things.\nIf you want to visualize a list of files|directories for a specific folder, type ./ (for current directory) or /path/to/some/folder and press TAB twice.

The Homebrew documentation page for installation states the following:\n\nThis script installs Homebrew to its preferred prefix (/usr/local for\nmacOS Intel, /opt/homebrew for Apple Silicon and\n/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew for Linux) so that you don’t need sudo when\nyou brew install. It is a careful script; it can be run even if you\nhave stuff installed in the preferred prefix already. It tells you\nexactly what it will do before it does it too. You have to confirm\neverything it will do before it starts.\n\nWhat is the reason (technical or otherwise) for Homebrew to choose /opt/homebrew as the installation prefix instead of /usr/local like it does in case of macOS running on Intel chips?\n\nA: From the Homebrew FAQ :\n\nThe prefix /opt/homebrew was chosen to allow installations in /opt/homebrew for Apple Silicon and /usr/local for Rosetta 2 to coexist and use bottles.\n\nThis allows the installation and execution of two Homebrew versions simultaneously on Apple Silicon, one for ARM and one for Intel under Rosetta. See further here\n\nA: I would highly recommend checking out the original Homebrew discussion here. I'll summarise a few points from it below.\nThe default prefix before Apple Silicon (/usr/local) was chosen for a few reasons:\n\n*\n\n*It's already in PATH. This means that tools installed with homebrew can be accessed without any need to change anything.\n\n*Quite a few build systems already look in /usr/local, so libraries installed with homebrew can be used by non-homebrew tools.\n\nThe Apple Silicon transition came with a change in the default Homebrew prefix. Some of the reasons for this included:\n\n*\n\n*/usr/local is also used by other tools, not just Homebrew. This can lead to potential conflicts.\n\n*Installations in /opt/homebrew for Apple Silicon and /usr/local for Rosetta 2 can coexist.\n\n*Homebrew tools might not always want to be used by default. A different prefix would make this easier.\n\nThere was also an interesting article a while back about some of the potential security risks with /usr/local that you might find interesting.\nOther macOS package managers were already using different prefixes (MacPorts with /opt/local and Fink with /opt/sw). MacPorts listed some reasons why they don't use /usr/local here, and Fink has here.\nJust to note, although not recommended,  Homebrew can technically be installed anywhere. However, pre-built bottles/binaries are only available on the default prefix.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2015 does not output video via HDMI or MiniDisplay port Problem\nI have a 2015 MacBook Pro. I also have a JVC television with an HDMI port. When I connect the two via an HDMI cable, the laptop appears to recognize that I've connected to another display (the television shows up in System Preferences). Unfortunately the picture on the television is blank, as if it's not receiving a video signal at all.\nI've tried connecting via the MiniDisplay port (and a MD to HDMI converter) and the results are identical. I've also found that I can connect a 2010 MacBook Air to the television without issue.\nThings I've tried\nI've restarted the machine, reset the SMC, and turned the television off and on several times.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The television appears to be unable to handle higher resolutions. Here's what ended up working:\n\n*\n\n*Change the resolution for the television to \"Scaled\" via System Preferences.\n\n*Tick checkbox for \"Show all resolutions\"\n\n*Select 480p. At this point the image shows up on the television.\n\n*Now I can change the setting to 720p and the television updates accordingly.\n\nUnfortunately the television is unable to handle anything higher than 720p.\n", "Q: How do I type a Unicode special space characters without installing the Unicode Hex Input Keyboard? I want to type zero-width space, Unicode  U+200B; and  also thin-space  U+202F or hair-space U+200A (to achieve emphasis where I do not have control of the letter-spacing through CSS).\nI prefer not to install the Unicode Hex Input Keyboard because then I have to rotate through it every time I switch languages, which I often do. I am willing to take a few seconds to open an app and type the Unicode.\nThis can be done with Character Viewer for many other characters. But with these characters, the character does not appear when I type it (screenshot below).\nHow can I enter these characters? I was hoping that some sort of key combination, e.g. ⌘⇧  ⌥-200B, would do this, but something like Character Viewer is good too.\n\n\nA: In Character Viewer, add Unicode to your list on the left and go to the 2000 General Punctuation range.  Unicode is found in the \"Code Tables\" category when you click on the Gear Wheel and select Customize.\nAlso you can pretty easily add the extra characters you need to any language layout with Ukelele.\n\nA: Within the character viewer, you can also search for unicode characters by name, e.g. 'thin', 'hair', 'space'. When you do, the search results will have a second section, 'Unicode Name'. This will contain characters that contain the search string in their name (e.g. 'thin space', 'hair space', 'no-break space', and even 'backspace').\nOnce you click on an individual result (as 'u' is in the OP), you can then click 'Add to Favorites'. This will add a 'Favorites' section on the left, above Search Results, and all characters so added will be available there‡.\nNormally, to simplify entry, you can add a keyboard shortcut, but alas, it looks like you can't use just a space, thin or otherwise, as a replacement character in a keyboard shortcut. Maybe because shortcuts are triggered with a space… dunno.\nHowever, as a clumsy alternative, you could add an oddball character, using something like  ⎋, as the replacement and then backspace to delete the ⎋. First, using the character viewer, add a thin space along with the oddball character to an otherwise empty TextEdit document, select all and copy to the clipboard. Then (at least in Sierra) go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Text. Below the 'replace' section… click the + button and type some unique string, e.g. ths for thin space. Hit tab to move to the 'with' side and paste the previously copied text and hit return. Thereafter, if you type ths in a document and then type space (or some punctuation) it will replace the 'ths' with an actual thin space along with the extraneous character. If you do this, I would suggest using a character you would never use otherwise as then you can also do a standard search and replace to get rid of every instance.\nIt might be worth testing with a visible character to see how it all works. Repeat for hair space or any other oft-used awkward character. FYI, there are some environments in which these shortcuts don't work, e.g. some text entry boxes such as this one, or in the Terminal.\nIncidentally, you can add 'Unicode' as a character set on the left of the character viewer window by clicking the gear drop down and then 'customize list…'.\n‡ As a bonus: Some character sets are fairly deep (e.g. kanji, unicode), which means that it can be difficult to determine where to look for the character (i.e. browsing rather than searching). When you have a character selected, its background changes, and if you click on a character set that contains it, it will automatically be highlighted within that set and you will henceforth know how it is categorized.\n", "Q: What happens if I install macOS on an external drive but connect it to a different Mac? I have installed macOS on an external drive for use with my MacBook Pro laptop. What will happen if I plug this drive into my Mac Pro desktop and boot it up?\nI ask because the hardware of both devices is very different, so am wondering if the initial installation on the external drive was with a specific computer, it can be used only with a computer with the same hardware. Or if macOS will just adapt when connected to a device with different specifications?\n\nA: You must make sure that the machine you boot on, supports the version of macOS on your external drive\nThen it will work, you just need to go to the boot menu and select your external drive.\nWhy you can’t “trick” a newer version on macOS into al older machine like that?\nMost probably because macOS, being and OS, has drivers incorporated into it, designed for specific hardware. Most probably newer versions of the OS remove or deprecate code for older hardware.\n", "Q: What are the CarbonComponentScanner and VisualizerService-x86 (Music) processes? In Activity Monitor.app I've wanted to find out what are the x86, Intel processes that I still have on my Apple Silicon MacBook.\nThe only two x86 processes are CarbonComponentScanner and VisualizerService-x86 (Music). Does anyone know what they are and what they are doing?\n\n\nA: CarbonComponentScannerXPC references Rosetta and the Audio Toolbox (using \"Open Files and Ports\" in Activity Monitor).\nThe Visualiser is the freaky whoosh display in iTunes/Music that dances to the music.\nIn short: nothing to worry about, and unlikely to affect performance.\n", "Q: MacOS Dock adapter for Linux and/or Windows applications? I have a Python+GTK application I use frequently on Linux and MacOS.  It's at https://stromberg.dnsalias.org/~strombrg/hcm/ .  Right now at least, I'm turning it into a MacOS app bundle using https://stromberg.dnsalias.org/svn/mactools/trunk/ .\nIt works the way I want it to on Linux - you click it, and it runs, and exits when it's done; there's no Dock to worry about.  This fits in well with all of the Linux desktop environments I'm aware of, and likely Windows too.\nOn MacOS, this behavior isn't quite an ideal fit, because each time I want to run it I have to go to Applications - it only stays in the dock until I finish using the app.\nI'm wondering if there's some sort of adapter program available, that will make it seem like a Windows-ported and/or Linux-ported app is more MacOS-aware, staying in the Dock until you right-click-quit in the Dock for easy subsequent access.  Rather than modifying each app that needs to be cross-platform, it seems like a little adapter program could be written once and reused for each app.\nDoes something like this already exist?\nTIA!\n\nA: If you have a macOS container built you can drag it onto the dock, or as @mmmmmm mentions in comment: right-click the application while it's active in dock, navigate to the options sub-menu and select the Keep in Dock option.\nFYI: if an application has an icon with a dot underneath it in the dock it means that the application is still running & taking system resources. macOS generally doesn't behave like Windows where closing an application's windows usually exits the application too.\n", "Q: How can I find files recently downloaded from the Internet?

I have installed Parallels on it and play Dying Light and other games on it three to four hours daily.\nMy Mac gets hot but till now not that much.\nI am wondering if gaming can cause harm to my Mac, especially cause the battery to age.\nShould I be worried and stop gaming on it?\n\nA: Gaming on your MacBook Pro is not a problem. Those machines are made to be used with \"professional users\" in mind. This means high load, for example for pro video editing or 3D modeling, all of which may stress both CPU and GPU. If the machine does become too hot, it will reduce performance to compensate. It's unlikely to affect the battery life, either.\nMy old MacBook Pro was my prime (non-console) gaming machine for years.\n", "Q: Keeping ampersand & in filenames when extracting zip files I want to copy my Google Drive folders to an external USB. Google prepares a zip file for me but if I extract that zip file, the & character in filenames are replaced with _. I don't want such a change. I tried the unzip in terminal window, The Unarchiver app and Mac's Archive Utility. Nothing creates the original filenames. Any suggestions?\nPS. I can't mirror sync Google Drive onto external disk directly unfortunately. I creates a hyperlink in the external drive and downloads everything onto a local folder. I don't have enough space to mirror the whole Drive. And there is no way to choose which folders to mirror. It is either nothing or all.

At that point I noticed that it was reporting:\nmyname@iPad-of-anotherperson % \n\n(where iPad-of-anotherperson was an actual iPad in the room).\nI do not know why it reported as a hostname the name of another device. I changed HostName, ComputerName and LocalHostName via terminal, but still I was not sure if everything was ok. So, as the computer was brand new, I just entered recovery mode, erased the disk and restarted the installation of Monterey.\nNow the OS is reinstalling itself, but in the Installer logs (cmd+L) I still see the name iPad-of-anotherperson. All the logs are done as follows:\nID timestamp iPad-of-anotherperson log\n\nI don't know how to remove that name, or why it is reported as a name for the computer, as I did not connect it in any way to the iPad and now the name seems stuck with the new computer.\nDo you have any suggestions?\n\nA: My main suggestion is to not worry what the host name is in terminal if it stays correct in sharing preference pane. Unless you need the network to assign things by name correctly every time, whoever had that IP address before will change regularly for most networks based on DHCP lease time settings.\nThis is expected behavior on networks where DNS servers don’t grab the macOS host name or you don’t get a clean DNS from DHCP.\nYou might not have permanent good luck forcing the behavior on the Mac end with scripts, but managing the DNS / DHCP side is typically more effective a solution.\nYou are very much not alone in thinking this is wrong / surprising / unexpected behavior.\n\n*\n\n*Why is my host name wrong at the Terminal prompt when connected to a public WiFi network?\n", "Q: how to resize terminal.app's window pixelwise?

Whatever bag I use to carry my iPhone XR, it may lock and disable itself. I was running in a foreign country today and my family got worried because they were not getting news from me. Even when I reached back, I could not message them because my phone was disabled for 9min. Strava only recorded 10min meaning that my phone was locked for at least 40min. Imy phone seems to have disabled itself after 2km when I did a 20s stop.\nHow do I totally disable this anti-feature?\nI want to be the person who locks and unlocks my phone, with face or code.\n\nA: The way this is worded is something of an XY Problem - you can't prevent the auto-disable feature, but what you actually need is the phone to stop 'butt-dialling' by waking in your bag.\nDo you have 'raise to wake' switched on? If so, switch it off or make sure the phone goes in your bag upside down. That way, raise to wake is never triggered.\n", "Q: Is there any way to prevent the Dock from jumping to another display when I reach the bottom of the screen? When your mouse reaches the bottom of the screen then try to drag it a little bit lower, macOS automatically moves the Dock to that display. I trigger this unintentionally a few times a day, so I want to turn it off to keep the Dock on my main display. Is there a way for that?\nI am not open for attaching the Dock to the side of the screen.\n\nA: You have two choices.\n\n*\n\n*Attach it to the side of the screen - which you already said you don't want to do.\n\n\n*Disable \"Displays have separate Spaces\" In Mission Control.\nThis will have the side effect of making all your Spaces move in 'pairs', both screens are now one larger Space, rather than two independent, smaller Spaces.\nThe dock, however, will then always remain on your primary display.\nPersonally, I've always used 2. I just prefer my screen layout that way.\n", "Q: How do I disable storing my messages on iCloud? I try not to use iCloud. I like to back up all my photos and files manually into my external hard drives, so I don't have any use for it. But over the last 2 months, I've been getting bombarded by alerts, e-mails, pop-ups, notifications, and every other possible method to warn me that my iCloud is almost full.\nI finally checked my iCloud storage, and it says 4.53GB of it is messages.\n\nI don't want a cloud backup of my texts. I use iMessage on my iPhone and my Macbook.\nHow do I stop iCloud storing these messages?\n\nA: Logging into icloud.com won't give access to manage the storage. This has to be done on the iPhone's system preferences. First tap the user's Apple ID at the top of the settings, then iCloud. In there you can manage your storage, and delete all backed-up messages (it'll give you a 30-day period to undo this deletion). You can also disable other apps that back up their data via iCloud. You can see at the top of the Storage bar that now it's only using 467MB after deleting all the messages:\n\n\n", "Q: SF Symbols 3.0: Use Restrictions There is an icon I'd like to use, that has Use Restrictions.\nThe warning says:\n\nThis symbol may not be modified and may only be used to refer to\nApple’s Messages app.\n\nThis is fine, as my app will only use it in reference to its integration feature with the iOS Messages app.\nBut there is no option to use or export it?

How do I discover potential hardware issues in a liquid-exposed MacBook Pro, other than trying to use all hardware features manually? Is there some general diagnostic test that can be run to look for hardware problems?\n\nI spilled a full glass of regular tap water over a late 2016 MacBook Pro 13\" a few days ago. I've let it dry upside down (hanging over the edge of a table) for nearly four days, and I'm happy to see it boots fine.\nTwo issues appeared at first: Bluetooth was \"not available\", and the whole system stuttered and slowed down for a few seconds when changing the screen brightness. Both of these issues disappeared on a second reboot, and bluetooth as well as screen brightness behaves normally.\nFrom just using the computer, the keyboard, trackpad, hard drive, battery, screen, wifi, speakers, microphone, and camera all seem to work fine. But I would prefer a more systematic approach to discover any lurking problems.\n\nA: No general tool will work in this situation. The built in diagnostics assume the system is stable and you know that’s not the case. You need external tools and parts.\nOperating a device that has liquid could damage it further. Why not have it inspected by a trained technician that can repair or ensure it’s safe to operate / validate your data recovery and backup are complete?\nIt’s unlikely evaporation alone can safely clean and dry Apple gear and you have likely already passed the point where corrosion is causing cascading failures at a subsystem level based on the disfunction noted.\nSo sorry you’re learning all this now, but this is the way to learn about electronics by experience. I do appreciate your “ This Is Fine “ attitude and approach.\n", "Q: Does Mac Photos app automatically delete duplicates when importing? From here:\n\nThe Photos app automatically detects duplicate images when you import them\n\nI'm not sure I totally trust that website, and I can't see that written anywhere else (and I can't seem to find any documentation on Mac Photos App). Also, it doesn't say what happens when Mac Photos App finds duplicates while importing (presumably, it deletes them?).\nBackground: After importing all photos from iPhone to an empty Mac Photos library, I have a different number of photos on the iPhone compared to the number imported (again). I googled long and hard, and I don't use iCloud, so I'm struggling to explain why some photos are missing.\n\nA: We have to be careful with the term duplicate.\nAs explained in the comment, a duplicate file contains the same data, however it is not the same file.\nPhotos does not import the same file twice, however, a duplicate (i.e. an exact copy of a file) will be imported again. Photos does not search the photo data a file contains and check whether an identical image already exists in the library.\nThe term duplicate is often still used here, because if a file has been imported from your iPhone to the Mac, that new file on the Mac is a duplicate of the iPhone file.\n\nA: This is not a comprehesive answer by any means (and I will not accept it on that basis). But in case it helps anyone:\n\n*\n\n*I tested by taking a live photo, duplicating it as a live photo, and importing all new items. Photos App brought in both copies (2 photos total).\n\n*I repeated for a screenshot (took a screenshot, duplicated it). Again, Photos app brought in both copies.\n\nThis suggests that Photos app doesn't delete duplicates when importing.\n", "Q: Can macOS Monterey alter the text input menu to show only flag icon? In pre-Monterey versions, the text input menu item, if enabled, only showed a representative flag icon. As of macOS Monterey, it shows the flag icon and a textual description. This unnecessarily crowds the menu bar, and issue further compounded by the reduced space available on the MacBook Pro M1 with the notch.\nScreenshot attached. Please note, I'm not making any kind of political statement. I'm a linguist specializing in Slavic languages.\n\nI can solve the crowding issue with Bartender - that's fine.\nIs there a hidden preference to revert to the flag-only display, or some other workaround to omit the long text in the menu bar?\n\nA: Try clicking on the item labeled \"Hide Input Source Name\" at the bottom of your picture:\n\n", "Q: Is there any search tools like \"everything\" on MacOS? Now I want to search a file exists or not on my mac, when I am using Windows, I can using the everything tool that searching any files less than 50ms on the disk, I was wonder if there is any tool like this in macOS to let me searching any files quickly, I am using this find command, it is too slow. I am using the spotlight but I still not sure it shows all the files on disk.\n\nA: Spotlight does not index all files, but is real time and fast.\nIf you want a graphical tool, use Find Any File there are many alternatives, but this one is superb.\nCommand line tools:\n\n*\n\n*mdfind can do amazing complex tasks if the path is indexed\n\n*locate exceptionally fast, rebuilds the database index in the background periodically, only cares about filesystem names and paths.\n\n\nA: OP was looking for a fast, indexed search on Mac OSX.  ProFind appears to fit the bill.  It's just $6.99.\nI've tried all of the free alternatives listed on alternativeto.net, but they're all very slow at indexing, most won't show when a directory matches, and their interfaces are super clunky.\nUsing a free trial of ProFind, I was able to index 100k files on a network share in under 5 minutes (others took 20+), and do full searching in under a second.  It can match to directories that match your search criteria too!

Professionally, Synology has a great name. To save wear and tear you could also get a CalDigit Thunderbolt 3 / USB 4 dock so that you have one high quality cable that connects so you make fewer connections to the Mac.\nCheaper NAS have less robust support for scheduling / backups than the Synology software.\n", "Q: Terminal ls command does not list complete contents of /Applications In Terminal.app, I issue the following commands:\ncd /Applications\nls\n\nIt lists many, but not all, of the apps that the Finder sees.

I've tried a few FF plug-ins but I haven't found one which works the way I want.\n\nDictionary brought up through trackpad tap\n\n\nFirefox context menu\n\n\nA: Look Up has a system-wide key command, if that's any use to you.\nDefault is  Cmd ⌘   Ctrl ⌃   D .\nYou just hover the mouse over the word you want, no click needed.\nI tested it works in Firefox.\n\n", "Q: Unknown MAC address under Personal Hotspot usage Context: Personal hotspot connection from iPhone 12 used on my MacBook Air.\nProblem: Under Settings - Mobile Data - Personal Hotspot (iPhone), I see 2 data usage components:\n1.5 GB - MacBook, and,\n20.2 KB - A very suspicious looking MAC address: 4a:f1:1b:3a:7d:86\nFurther information: I changed password multiple times, but the issue persists. Sometimes, I also see \"Other devices\"...\nWhat is going on? Is my security in danger? Could this be related to MAC randomisation?\n\nA: I do not know why you think that MAC address is \"suspicious looking\". It is not \"suspicious looking\" to me.\nYou can tell from the address itself that it is not a MAC address given to a network interface from factory by a hardware vendor - it is instead a software generated MAC address. This is very typical today - for example used in MAC randomisation, a scheme to protect the user privacy.\nThere's absolutely nothing here that indicates that your \"security is in danger\".\n", "Q: Mac Upload and Download Speeds I am trying to find the difference between Mac computers and Windows 10 & 11 computer upload and download speeds. I need the updload and down load speeds for the following operating systems for Mac Monterey, Mac Big Sur, Mac Catalina, and Mac Mojave.\n\nA: Download speeds are largely dependent on the hardware, e.g. the rating for the Wifi or Ethernet controller; and in the case of Wifi, the quality of the over-the-air connection.\nUpload speeds are largely controlled by the ISP providing the line.\nA quick Google will show you some people having faster speeds, and some having slower, when using Windows in BootCamp, compared to MacOS on the same hardware.\nThere are of course all sorts of other 'real world' factors.\nThe  concept of 'a download speed' for a given OS is therefore not really something that can be measured.\n", "Q: Safari accesses Contacts I’m reading the App Privacy Report of my iPhone.

Is there a way to prevent it?\n\nA: There's a number of reasons this could be happening, but it likely comes down to Safari accessing your contacts database for something trivial. Apple should address this issues so that people don't run into what you're seeing, but:\nOne possibility is \"Shared With You\" which will show the name of the sender. This information could be embedded in the database, but it may just be the phone number that sent it - in which case Safari would have to lookup the name in Contacts to show \"Shared by <Someone's name>\"\nAnother example from another application is the App Store - which displays your profile picture in the top-right corner: This comes from your contacts, and the App Store will show up as accessing your contacts.\n", "Q: Deleted /usr/local/Frameworks and others while uninstalling Homebrew I am running macOS Monterey, 12.2.1 on my Mac. I had installed Homebrew a couple of years ago and had not updated it in the past few months. Now as I tried to run brew doctoror brew cleanup or brew update I came across various errors of permission being denied (like Error: Permission denied @ apply2files while trying brew cleanup). So, I decided to uninstall Homebrew with a plan to reinstall it later. I ran:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)\"\nAt the end of the uninstallation, I was told:\n==> Homebrew uninstalled!\nThe following possible Homebrew files were not deleted:\n/usr/local/.com.apple.installer.keep\n/usr/local/Frameworks/\n/usr/local/Homebrew/\n/usr/local/bin/\n/usr/local/etc/\n/usr/local/gfortran/\n/usr/local/include/\n/usr/local/lib/\n/usr/local/opt/\n/usr/local/remotedesktop/\n/usr/local/sbin/\n/usr/local/share/\n/usr/local/texlive/\n/usr/local/var/\nYou may wish to remove them yourself.\n\nA bit absentmindedly I ran sudo rm -rf /usr/local/.com.apple.installer.keep and the same for /usr/local/Frameworks/ and /usr/local/Homebrew/. Then I noticed what I was doing and stopped short of deleting /usr/local/bin. My /usr/local/bin contains\ndvipdf          gslp            ps2pdf13\neps2eps         gsnd            ps2pdf14\nfont2c          lprsetup.sh     ps2pdfwr\ngfortran        pdf2dsc         ps2ps\ngs          pdf2ps          ps2ps2\ngs-X11          pf2afm          sage\ngs-X11-Yosemite     pfbtopfa        texdist\ngs-noX11        pphs            texdistmgr\ngs-noX11-Yosemite   printafm        unix-lpr.sh\ngsbj            ps2ascii        wftopfa\ngsdj            ps2epsi\ngsdj500         ps2pdf\n\nWhy would Homebrew want me to delete them? What will happen to the directories I have already deleted in /usr/local/? Thank you!\n\nA: First note that Apple does not put anything under /usr/local so that removing things will not break the OS. This also means that you or other admins of the machine have made decisions to put stuff in it.\nHomebrew (on Intel and PPC) installs into various directories under /usr/local\nThe problem is that other installs go into /usr/local as well as per Unix norms.\nThus I think you have other things installed by actions other than Homebrew into /usr/local and this confuses Homebrew which assumes that everything under /usr/local is under its control. Thus you get the failure of brew doctor. However the /usr/local/bin directory might well just be executables installed by Homebrew\nSo you have to decide what you installed and why.\nThis can be complex.\nIn this case I would delete all under /usr/local and then reinstall what you need. This might just be reinstall Homebrew. (I would note other package managers don't use /usr/local and so can coexist with manual Unix installs for things not available in that package manager)\n\nA: Homebrew did not delete these directories because they may contain files not installed via Homebrew.\nIn your case, the listed binaries seem to be related to your TexLive installation. I assume you want to keep them.\nThe removal of /usr/local/{Frameworks,Homebrew} shouldn't have an impact, I would leave the other directories as they are though.\nPS: Not sure what the purpose of .com.apple.installer.keep is, it is an empty file which seems to be installed as part of macOS. If you want to recreate it, run\nsudo touch /usr/local/.com.apple.installer.keep\nsudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/.com.apple.installer.keep\n\n", "Q: How do I prevent Remote Access to my Mac? I think I'm being hacked.\n(This is a theoretical scenario, based on a real occurrence.)\nI have clear evidence that someone unknown is able to remote access my Mac.\nThe Mac wakes unexpectedly, the cursor can be seen moving, windows &  files are being accessed & opened. The attacker can also be seen accessing the webcam & showing the current view of the room.\nMy drive is encrypted. Why doesn't this prevent their accessing it?\nI don't know whether this is being done from nearby or at a distance. If I switch off my router, they still seem capable of this access.\nHow do I analyse & prevent this from happening in future?\nThis question is 'poached' from SuperUser, currently closed & showing no signs of being re-opened. As such it will eventually be swept away by the system. Edit March 22 - the post is now deleted. The original question was a paranoid mess, but I thought the answer may be of benefit to Ask Different, so this is a complete recast of the question.\n\nA: I would be surprised if this was an expert attack. I suspect you've been socially engineered into giving someone Remote Access. Getting past your router's firewall is not trivial & can best be initiated by something on your own computer than from outside.\nAlso, an expert attacker would be unlikely to use an attack vector which would let you simply see what they're doing. With the necessary permissions it would be quite easy to do all of this without you knowing anything other than the fans had activated.\nI do this legitimately to access many Macs on my network & remotely around the country.\nStep 1.\nDisconnect from the internet. Unplug or switch off your router.\nCheck your router's instruction manual for how to reset it to factory defaults. Reset then change the passwords of both admin access & the wifi password. Set them to two different passwords.\nCheck if it has UPnP capability & if it's possible to switch this off. If so, switch it off.\nIf the attacker can still get in when your router is switched off, then they must be within 50 feet of you, directly accessing your iMac's wifi.\nIf so, disable the wifi on the Mac & wire up to the router directly, with an ethernet cable.\nStep 2.\nCheck your Mac accounts.\nSystem Preferences > Users & Groups\n\nClick the lock, supply your admin password, then change your passwords on all known accounts.\nIf there are any accounts there you don't recognise, remove them by clicking the - box bottom left.\nSeveral legitimate remote access apps add their own user here, for example, NoMachine adds a user called nx. If you installed such an app, you would allow this to be enabled. If you didn't & someone else is using it to access, removing it will seriously hamper their attempts.\nDon't remove or disable Guest.\nStep 3.\nSystem Preferences > Sharing\nDisable Remote Login, Management & Apple Events.\nIn fact, unless you know you need them, switch off everything in this panel.\n\nStep 4.\nInstall & run Malwarebytes\nStep 5.\nCheck your Applications folder for anything you don't recognise. Look for names such as TeamViewer, NoMachine, Ammyy Admin, Mikogo, AnyDesk, Chrome Remote Desktop, WebEx Meetings, ThinVNC, UltraVNC [or anything with VNC in the name].\nIf you find any of these, get AppCleaner (Freeware) then drop each one onto it & let it uninstall each one.\nStep 6.\nLogin to https://www.icloud.com/find/ then click All Devices.\nMake sure you recognise & know the current whereabouts of all the devices in the list. If there are any devices you cannot identify, click on them & 'remove from account'.\nAny device you recognise but cannot locate in the house, set to Lost Mode.\nLogin to https://appleid.apple.com and change your Apple ID password.\nReboot. Test.\nIf that doesn't lock them out, there's something more stealthy going on & you will need to refer it to an expert, hands-on.\nAdditional notes:\nEncrypting the drive will have no effect on this type of attack, because it's unlocked by your own account being logged in.\n", "Q: Can I delete the .PkInstallSandboxManager Xcode packages? Lately, I have noted a lot of storage bloat on my system, to the point where it's becoming problematic for performance (in the sense that I'm running out of disk space for updates, new programs etc.). In an attempt to clean up, I used Disk Drill to get an overview, and it seems that the massive file bloat I'm seeing is related to XCode.\nI rarely develop on my laptop, and if I do, I'm not developing Mac applications, so as far as I can gather, I have no use for XCode, so I uninstalled the program to free up space. This did help somewhat, but not to the level I expected.\nFurther investigation revealed that the majority of bloat (almost 220GB!) is taken up by files in the Library/InstallerSandboxes/.PKInstallSandboxManager/ folder.\nIn total, there are 8 subfolders, all named <someGUID>.activeSandbox, and each containing only three files. An Xcode.app in <someGUID>.activeSandbox/Root/Applications/ (this is the bloated file, tens of GB), an com.apple.pkg.Xcode.bom in <someGUID>.activeSandbox/Boms/ and finally a .SessionUUID in the activeSandbox/ base folder.\nNow, the question is, if I can safely remove these <someGUID>.activeSandbox/ folders related to XCode? They look like temporary files to me.\nAs far as I can tell there is nothing in there that relates to anything but XCode which I no longer have installed on my system anyway.\nWhat have I tried:\n\n*\n\n*Repeated restarts after uninstalling XCode - no change, files stays\n\n*Restarts in Safe Mode after uninstalling XCode - Same as above, files persists.\n\nSo I'm wondering if I should just go ahead and manually remove these files?\nGoogling seems to provide conflicting answers to potential harm, but all the answers I found were several years old, so maybe someone here has new insights to share?\nNote: I have had persistent problems updating XCode in the past, where the installer would basically be stuck on \"installing\" at around 99% for hours or even days. So these packages might be related to corrupted updates somehow.\n\nA: Yes, you can delete the .PKInstallSandboxManager folder.\nI don't see how this would help your system's performance though.\n\nA: Just a follow-up if others come looking, to confirm the answer from jksoegaard. I removed the files in the folder, and now, after almost a month of using my laptop, there have been zero problems associated with this.\n", "Q: How to delete Self-Signed certificate from System Keychain (Big Sur) I just can't find a way to delete the Self-Signed Root CA from Keychain under System.\nWhen I open KeyChain I select System under System Keychains.

All videos except two were 720 MP4 except two which were 1080 MOV.  When I tried downloading just one photo, it would say it was downloading a HEIC though it would give me a JPG.\nShe also tried going to icloud.com and repeating the procedure and still only got 3MP.

Searching around, people say sharing a link is the way to share full resolution but that isn't working.\n\nA: See this, it may solve the problem.\nMy guess is that the lower resolution items contain edits.

I just got an Apple watch and selected a face that happens to have a small Earth showing my location and the daylight/nighttime distribution in my hemisphere.\nThis made me wonder if there are ways I can display other astronomical information, specifically what planets are currently in the sky and where they are roughly. Examples of this kind of information can be seen in in-the-sky.org's planetarium mode for example, as well as many other planetarium programs and websites:\n\n*\n\n*Where can I find the positions of the planets, stars, moons, artificial satellites, etc. and visualize them?\nIt is quite easy to generate a simple small database from which these positions in the sky can be calculated given lat/lon and date/time so if there are (easy) ways to script graphics on the watch's screen I might be able to attempt that manually, but I have no idea how accessible the screen is for such a project, and there may be easier ways of getting this.\nQuestion: What are my options (if any) for coding or scripting or at least designing my Apple watch face by myself? For example, I'd like to see the positions of the Moon and planets in the sky. What are my options (if any) for coding it myself if I can't find one that does what I want?\nnote: There is an Astronomy watch face available, but if I understand correctly, it shows a crude flat 2D top-down map of the solar system only.\n\nA: Your options for coding Apple Watch faces (or parts of them) are really limited to only one option: Apple ClockKit.\nYou can find the documentation for it here.\nUsing ClockKit you can build custom complications and timeline entries. It is also possible for you to customize a watch face with a mix of complications and save that to a .watchface file that you can bundle with your app to allow the user to quickly get the whole watch face setup per your design.\n", "Q: What sort of privacy can be expected with Apple Business Manager enrolling a company Mac in a MDM? I got a new Macbook that is managed by a company with Apple Business Manager. Other than working for this company, I want to use this device for my private stuff too, like freelancing. This would mean storing some projects and applications on the device that I don't want to share with a company that owns this Macbook device - I want full privacy and control over my data.\nThe warning says the company can erase the device and list installed apps, but I’m not sure how to tell what else they might do with their owned and managed device.\nIt would be very helpful to know what extent of privacy and control I have over this managed device?\n\nA: You cannot have full privacy and control over your own personal data on a MacBook that is managed by your employer. That is not possible.\nYou need to use a separate, private device for your own personal data and your own personal freelance business.\nIn addition to the actions you specify yourself (such as remote wiping and browsing installed apps), an employer also has almost limitless access to a managed computer - including the possibility to install and run custom scripts that perform all sorts of actions. That includes for example copying data to a company server.\nNote that I'm not saying that your employer is spying on you or that they are copying your data. I'm just saying that it is technically possible to do things like that. The laws in your country as well as the contract you have with your employer will probably forbid or limit actions like that.\n", "Q: MacBook Keeps Waking Up My MacBook keeps waking up every 5 minutes or so.

I notice that with every new iOS update, many of the Experimental WebKit Features either are no longer relevant, or newer EWF’s appear out of nowhere. Some of the features that were initially toggled ON by default randomly end up off and placed in a different position than before on the list. I’ve been searching all over, and I just can’t seem to find the correct guide for which features to leave on or cut off. My anxiety tells me a few of them could create problems just from being toggled off when it should’ve been on…and I’d have no idea.\nDoes anyone have an updated 2022 version with all of the WK features and explanations and discriptions for each? I’d greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: Don't worry about the list. Unless you are a web developer working with those upcoming features, or rely on some non-common web application that requires that specific experimental feature, there's no need to toggle any of the features on or off. Apple will do that automatically for you with their software updates, so that experimental features that are no longer experimental automatically becomes turned on permanently, and those features that are rejected will essentially be turned off permanently.\n\nA: Answer\nFour recommendations:\n\n*\n\n*The actual WebKit source code is probably the most authoritative and up-to-date reference for the usage and function of these “Experimental WebKit Features”, but also the least user-friendly.\nThe most recent list of names, short descriptions, and defaults can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/main/Source/WTF/Scripts/Preferences/WebPreferencesExperimental.yaml\n\n(Keep in mind that the current contents of the main branch are almost guaranteed to be newer that whatever version of WebKit/WebCore is installed on your device.)\n\n\n*WebCore’s features.json file has more information about at least some of the WebKit’s features, ‘experimental’ and standard alike.\nThe entries in that file often indicate if the feature is ‘coming’ or ‘going’, and in many cases link to the relevant standard document or web site.\n\n\n*The WebKit wiki has a (potentially infrequently-updated?) list of feature information, and another page explaining the semantic difference between the ‘experimental’ and ‘internal’ categories:_\n\n*\n\n*Feature Flags\n\n\n*\n\n*Experimental and Internal Feature Flags\n\n\n\n*There are two sortable / filterable feature lists on the official WebKit site:\n\n*\n\n*WebKit Feature Status ( development-only | under construction-only | deprecated )\n\n*WebKit CSS Feature Status ( experimental-only | obsolete-only )\n(Note: the actual iOS menu referred to in the original question may only exist in the closed-source ‘Mobile Safari’ xcode wrapper used to build that app, from WebKit, at Apple.)\n\nNext steps\nOnce you find an item of interest in that list, you can search that same GitHub code repository GitHub code repository to try to further understand what a particular setting might do.\nExample:\nAccentColorEnabled:\n  type: bool\n  humanReadableName: \"CSS Accent Color\"\n  humanReadableDescription: \"Enable accent-color CSS property\"\n  defaultValue:\n    WebKitLegacy:\n      \"PLATFORM(COCOA)\" : true\n      default: false\n    WebKit:\n      \"PLATFORM(COCOA) || PLATFORM(GTK) || PLATFORM(WPE)\": true\n      default: false\n    WebCore:\n      \"PLATFORM(COCOA) || PLATFORM(GTK) || PLATFORM(WPE)\": true\n      default: false\n\n(i.e. for more potential information about the specific “CSS Accent Color” ‘experimental setting’, search for AccentColorEnabled to see where else that term is used)\n\nOptional homework\n(edit: it appears they many have already done something just like this, producing the tables listed at #4 above)\nIf anyone is bored, it should be trivial to write a script to auto-convert that YAML file into a table, web page, or ‘.csv’ file summarizing the contents.\n\n*\n\n*More human-readable documentation could then be updated on-demand.\n\n*\n\n*e.g.: The rows and columns could then be filtered, sorted, etc. in familiar ways.\n\n\n\nEven easier, that file may even (partially?) auto-import into a database, Google Sheets, or MS Excel with no modification (or perhaps after a simple conversion to a .json file using a free web tool).\n", "Q: Lock multiple instances of app on multiple desktops I'm using a macbook with two usb-c screens connected and that works wonderful.

Without doing it manually.\nIn this case you might find your solution in the third party app Later:\nhttps://getlater.app\n", "Q: Some apps are upside down I locked the orientation of my iPad upside down because I’m charging it and the cable would be in the way while using it.\nI noticed one app* does not “respect” this and displays in the “classic” orientation.

App developers are supposed to either support this feature OR alternatively mark their app as only supporting on of the available orientations.\nIn your case it seems the developer has not done their job properly. You'll need to file a bug report with the app developer and hope for an app update.\n", "Q: How to mirror a PDF (flip PDF horizontally)?

The Software Updates in System Preferences are all disabled. In spite of this macOS continues to show Notification Banners in Catalina (and Big Sur) which some users accidentally click to initiate an update. I want to stop macOS from showing all the Software Update notification banners to prevent accidental updates. Yet I still want to be able to manually initiate software updates when desired.\nPreviously the following has been suggested:\n\n*\n\n*softwareupdate --ignore “macOS Big Sur”, but this is not available any more as a command option and would block only major upgrades not minor or security upgrades AFAIK. (Only available in High Sierra up to Catalina with Apple Business Manager enrollment, Apple School Manager enrollment or Enrollment in a user-approved MDM)\n\n\n*Moving com.apple.SoftwareUpdateNotificationManager.plist from /System/Library/LaunchAgents to /System/Library/LaunchAgentsIgnored, but in order to make these changes, one must boot from another disk, otherwise System is read only. Also the notification will reappear if Software Updates  is selected in System Preferences. This is cumbersome as it means a lot of steps including additional reboots when updates are desired and manually initiated.\nI am currently testing another proposed solution which is to install the Lulu application firewall and then to block  /System/Library/CoreServices/Software Update.app/Contents/Resources/softwareupdated.\nBlocking and re-enabling softwareupdated for manual updates would be less cumbersome than disabling and re-enabling the system protected LaunchAgent, but I am not quite sure, if it will actually prevent the notifications from appearing. Who can confirm that this works in the long run?\nAre there any other options to accomplish this?\nRelated questions: How to block updates to Mac OS X Catalina? / Remove macOS Big Sur \"Upgrade Now\" button in System Preferences / How can I permanently disable App Store notifications in Big Sur?\n\nA: I have now tested blocking softwareupdated for a few weeks and it works as intended. - This has recently become even more important, since the Monterey update from 12.2.1 to 12.3 has caused serious issues with AMD 5000 and 6000 series graphics cards for many users.\nTL;DR\nThe short answer is to install the LuLu Application Firewall and block the process softwareupdated when prompted. Re-enable it temporarily when you want to do manual updates.\nDetailed Step-by-Step\nThe obvious first step is to completely disable all updates in System Preferences, but surprisingly this alone does not stop the clickable notifications.\nDownload and Install Lulu\nObjective-See: LuLu Application Firewall - Big Sur is recommended for version 2.4.

On Linux / Windows I expect the sleep mode to power off both my laptop screen and my external monitor by default (plus setting the device into sleep mode).\nWith this Mac, however, either closing the lid or manually selecting \"Sleep\" while connected via HDMI to the external Monitor prevents the device to actually switch modes.\nEven more, when closing the lid I can still use the mouse and keyboard on the external display, which is not only annoying but also when in an office can lead to privacy issues. The device is not automatically locked after closing the lid and having the monitor connected.\nSo far the only solutions I've found are:\n\n*\n\n*shutting down the device\n\n*disconnecting from the external monitor before closing the lid / going to sleep mode\nNone of them are ideal, so I'm wondering if someone run into the same issue and found a solution.\n\nThe monitor is a LG 27UK670, and I'm connecting to the right side HDMI port.\n\nA: Probably the power cable must have been connected.

I've recently upgraded to Monterey, and while I normally use the Unicode HEX keyboard to input accented/special characters, it ignores characters whose codes start and end with \"0\", making it impossible to input \"a with grave accent\" (U+00E0), but \"ᄐ\" (U+1110) and \"é\" (U+00E9) work.\nSeems like a bug, and is a big nuisance.\n\nA: I think all you can do about this is complain to Apple and use Character Viewer or the ABC Extended keyboard instead.\nMaking a custom layout for the characters you need most often with Ukelele may also make sense.  Or creating text replacements for them.\nUpdate:  Still broken as of MacOS 12.6\nUpdate:  Still broken as of MacOS 13.2\nI think 256 codepoints are affected, but not all are occupied.

Import, I can't select the library file I want to import: it's greyed out.\n\nWhere do I go from here?\n\nA: It may be that the reason I can't import any existing libraries was that I'm running Big Sur, not Monterey.\nWith apple's help, I managed to complete the merge as follows:\n\n*\n\n*open the other photo library\n\n*set it as the system library\n\n*enable iCloud\n\nThis only works because all the photos in my original library are being synced to iCloud.

I read this Apple Support page that they use XProtect to scan for known viruses.\nI cannot find any evidence that XProtect is getting new definitions or scanning anything.\nWhere can I find the logs and if it's in unify then how do I persist them?\nHow do I know Apple really scans for known malware and isn't just making that claim?\n\nA: This answer is in addition to @jksoegaard's answer showing how to report on usage on XProtect. I am providing the evidence regarding updates to XProtect.\nSystem Information shows all the installations related to XProtect. Here are mine since I last did an erase and reinstall:\n\nIf you prefer Terminal output you can use system_profiler -json  SPInstallHistoryDataType, but the output needs further processing to get it into a manageable form. [Thanks to @mustaccio for this.]\nAnd, I know there is another XProtect update today. This is reported by Howard Oakley's SilentKnight\n\nThe changes in today's update are discussed here XProtect Update\n\nA: You can find the logs by running:\nlog show --predicate 'subsystem == \"com.apple.xprotect\"'\n\nTo persist them, you could just save it into a file, like this:\nlog show --predicate 'subsystem == \"com.apple.xprotect\"' > mylogs.txt\n\nYou can find XProtect's various security definitions in this folder:\n/Library/Apple/System/Library/CoreServices/XProtect.bundle/Contents/Resources/\n\nFor example look at XProtect.plist and XProtect.yara. If you want to prove to yourself that these are actually updated by Apple - take a copy of them. Then compare that copy to your files a month or two later.\nIf you're still very suspicous that perhaps Apple is just claiming to scan for malware, while actually not doing so - even when that would include making fake documentation for it, fake software for it, fake definition files, and fake update processes for the same - you can just check that it does for yourself. Sounds like it would almost be more work for Apple to fake scanning for malware rather than actually doing it --  while at considerably risk of any system expert or programmer exposing them. Doesn't make sense, but if you really want - noone's stopping you.\nChecking for yourself could include actions such as intentionally introducing a malware file (inactivated) to the system, and checking that the XProtect detects it. You could also do code analysis on the XProtect binaries to make sure that it does what Apple says it does.\n", "Q: How to increase CPU for Pro Tools in my MacBook Pro?

I have a MacBook Pro 16” Intel variety that I got from work. I use two 32” monitors and the screen on the laptop. I recently added a RØDECaster Pro audio interface and a Blackmagic Design ATEM Mini Pro. It seems that I have hit the limit of what this laptop can do all at the same time.\nCould I add an M1 Mac mini to use with the MacBook Pro and split the processing power and RAM of both to bear the load? Any advice on if and then how would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: It is not generally possible to combine two computers (doesn't matter if it is Macs or PCs) to increase performance of whatever programs you're running.\nCombining multiple computers to increase performance requires specialized software that is completely dependent on the task, you're trying to perform.\nIn some cases you can do it simply by dividing work items. I.e. use the MacBook Pro to send its video output to your BlackMagic Design ATEM Mini Pro, and use the Mac Mini to record audio from the RØDECaster Pro audio interface.\nHowever, in many cases you want to use all the peripherals as if it is a single computer. I.e. for example recording a video from the BlackMagic Design ATEM Mini Pro while at the same time recording the audio from the RØDECaster Pro audio interface into the same program. It's not possible to just combine two computers to do that - unless you have some very specialized software to perform that task.\n", "Q: Is importing just the CA certificate to Keychain Access enough for trusting certs issued with that CA? I've created a PKI with easy-rsa.  I create keys for websites and sign them with my CA certificate.  I imported the CA certificate into Keychain Access, clicked the cert name, and specified \"Always Trust\".\nThe websites with keys signed by this CA certificate still cannot be accessed (invalid certificate errors).  I tried importing one of the site public keys into Keychain Access also, but I still got the error.  Am I missing a step?\n\nA: Importing and trusting the CA certificate is enough. Make sure your website certificate is really properly signed by the CA, is valid according to the \"valid from\" and \"valid until\" dates, and has proper Subject Alternative Names for your server address.\nAlso be aware that some third-party browsers (Firefox, for example) use their own certificate storage and don't use the macOS keychain. You would need to import your CA certificate into their storage.\n\nA: Yes, it should be enough.\nBut see the below constraints (esp. the validity period) which might explain why the certificate is not declared valid on macOS/iOS, although technically it is correct.\n\n### Requirements for trusted certificates in iOS 13 and macOS 10.15\nAll TLS server certificates must comply with these new security requirements in iOS 13 and macOS 10.15:\n\n*\n\n*TLS server certificates and issuing CAs using RSA keys must use key sizes greater than or equal to 2048 bits. Certificates using RSA key sizes smaller than 2048 bits are no longer trusted for TLS.\n\n*TLS server certificates and issuing CAs must use a hash algorithm from the SHA-2 family in the signature algorithm. SHA-1 signed certificates are no longer trusted for TLS.\n\n*TLS server certificates must present the DNS name of the server in the Subject Alternative Name extension of the certificate. DNS names in the CommonName of a certificate are no longer trusted.\n\nAdditionally, all TLS server certificates issued after July 1, 2019 (as indicated in the NotBefore field of the certificate) must follow these guidelines:\n\n*\n\n*TLS server certificates must contain an ExtendedKeyUsage (EKU) extension containing the id-kp-serverAuth OID.\n\n*TLS server certificates must have a validity period of 825 days or fewer (as expressed in the NotBefore and NotAfter fields of the certificate).\n\nConnections to TLS servers violating these new requirements will fail and may cause network failures, apps to fail, and websites to not load in Safari in iOS 13 and macOS 10.15.\nSource\n", "Q: Virtual Mac boots in verbose mode -- why? Some time back, I used Parallels Desktop on a Mac running macOS Catalina (10.15) as a host system to create a virtual machine running OS X Sierra (10.13). Everything ran fine, if a bit slow.  Then I migrated my VM to VirtualBox, following the instructions here.  Everything continues to work fine, with one very minor glitch:  whenever I start up the VM, it boots in verbose mode. (The original Parallels VM did not do this.)  Any idea why this is happening, or what I can do to fix it?\n\nA: Note the name of your virtual machine.

But I want to be able to do this natively, without having to pay for proprietary software, and without having to jump through the hoops of always having to set up a Zoom call.\nWhat are my options?\n\nA: MacOS has a feature called 'Sidecar', which allows an iPad to be used as a display for the Mac. But AFAIK this doesn't work the other way round.\nIn short: there is no such 'native' functionality, so you will need to use third-party software, some of which may well require payment for their efforts.

The iPhone synchs to the iMac using the Finder, and is set to download only some of my Albums. I haven't ticked the System Preferences > iCloud box to synch the MacBook Air just yet. Thus, I don't think either the iPhone or the Mac Book Air's storage status is relevant to this question.\nSynch took a day or more, and settled down with (as far as I can determine) all items in the iMac's Photos Library copied to iCloud: both the iMac (via the Finder) and iCloud (via icloud.com) report holding the same number of photos and videos.\nBut the folders' reported sizes are significantly different. On the Mac, System Preferences > iCloud shows 29.86 GB used for \"Photos and Videos.\" On the other hand, the Photo Library itself (Users/David/Pictures/Photos Library) is shown by the Finder's \"Get Info\" pane as 44 GB.\nWhy do the sizes of the Mac's folder and iCloud's folder differ?\n-David\n\nA: The Photos Library on your Mac contains, in addition to full resolution photos and videos, two databases, several reduced-size versions of the photos, and other files. The smaller-sized versions are used, for example, to display photo thumbnails when you open photos, or the larger-sized (but not full resolution) images when you click open a photo, etc. All these represent a significant overhead to the photos that are in the library on the Mac and in iCloud Photos library. Read more about this here, and check the size of Photos.sqlite file. If it's unreasonably large (More than 3-4GB for your 30GB library), try repairing the library and see if it makes a difference.\n", "Q: macOS get a file's \"allocated size\" from terminal? I'm on a Macbook Pro running macOS 12.2.1 (so using the APFS filesystem.)\nI noticed some strange behavior when creating a large \"dummy file\" using the mkfile utility.\n(/usr/sbin/mkfile)\nI created a 5 GB file with the command:\nmkfile -n 5g test.txt\n\nThen, to confirm it worked, I ran the du command. (/usr/bin/du).\ndu -hs ./test.txt\n\nBut I got an unexpected outcome:\n4.0K    ./test.txt\n\nI went to the file in Finder and looked at the file info, and saw there were two different sizes.\n\nAfter some further digging, I found this info on the mkfile man page:\nOPTIONS\n     -n     Create an empty filename.  The size is noted, but disk blocks aren't\n            allocated until data is written to them.\n\nSo I wanted to know, is there a command that will let me see the allocated file size?\n\nA: Displaying allocated file size vs. file size reported by the file sytem\nYou can display the allocated file size, that is, how much disk space test.txt takes up in the file system, with this command:\ndu -h test.txt\n\nIn contrast, the file size reported by the file system may or may not coincide with the allocated file size. To display it, use this command:\nls -l test.txt\n\n(You can use ls -lh test.txt instead if you prefer the file size to be more readable.)\nSparse files\nHow come test.txt takes up only 4KB of disk space, but the file system reports that its size is 5GB?\nThis is a clever functionality that (most) file systems offer: instead of spending time and disk space to create a file that contains no data, it is more efficient to create an empty file, set its metadata to report 5BG of size, and only allocate disk space when actual data is added to the file.\nAnd that's what the -n option of mkfile is all about:\n\n*\n\n*If you use mkfile -n, you will create a sparse file, which is somewhat similar to buying a train ticket without booking a seat. The train company won't reserve any seat for you (that is, no seat is allocated).\n\n\n*However, if you use mkfile without the -n option, for example:\nmkfile 5g test.txt\n\nthe file will be created and 5GB will be allocated, in a way similar to  buying a train ticket and booking a seat: the seat is reserved for you and nobody except you can use it (that is, the seat is allocated).\nSummarizing, when creating a file, the disk space can be either:\n\n*\n\n*be allocated (that is, reserved in the file system so that no other file can use it) which, for example, may help prevent the file from becoming fragmented\n\n*or, alternatively, you can request that the disk space not be allocated, which will create a sparse file. A sparse file is efficient, because it only occupies disk space when it contains data.\n\nAs pointed out by nohillside in their comment, you can \"fill\" the sparse file with data using dd, for example:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=test.txt bs=1024k count=5120\n\nso that the allocated file size and the file size reported by the file system match.\nFor more information on sparse files, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file.\n", "Q: 2014 MBP No More Operating System / Boot usb not Detected I have a mid-2014 MBP that I tried to downgrade but unfortunately ended up wiping out everything in the hard disk.\nOnce it restarted, it doesn’t startup anymore and only the long press on [Option] after turning on is accessible.

This is what I see in the Display section in System Preferences:\n\nmacOS seems to think that my 27\" monitor is only slightly larger than my 14\" built-in screen, which clearly isn't the case. As a result, mouse transfers from one monitor to another aren't scaled properly and feel unnatural.\nIs there any way to make the external monitor here \"bigger\" with relation to the internal monitor, so that mouse transfer from one screen to another will scale properly?\n\nA: Display sizes you see on the figure you have provided is scaled according to the UI resolution of the display, not the native resolution or the physical size of the display.\n14\" macbook pro built-in screen native resolution is 3024x1964, and since MacOs uses 4 pixels to render 1 UI pixel, it looks like half of that: 1512x982. This is the UI resolution.\nIf your 27 inch monitor is a full HD monitor, it's resolution will be 1920x1080p, which is slightly bigger than macbook pro built-in screen UI resolution.\nIf your 27 inch monitor is a 4K monitor and you did not change any settings for the UI resolution, MacOs is still probably using 4 pixels to render 1 pixel, so it still uses a UI resolution of 1920x1080. Text and everything will look sharper compared to a full HD display. However, since your UI resolution is the same, your screen real-estate will be the same as a 1920x1080 full HD display. And the external display will still look small in the figure you have provided.\nIf you are using a 4k display, you can use the scaled UI resolution 2560x1440. In that case, the text size and UI element sizes will be more closer to the size in built-in display, you will have much more screen real-estate, and finally you will see a larger display in the figure you provided compared to the built-in display.\nScaled resolutions put some burden on the GPU in terms of performance, but that will probably be a breeze for the GPU of M1 Pro. Additionally, the text rendering will not be as sharp as the non-scaled default resolution, but it will please most of the users. You should try and see if it is acceptable for you. I own the same laptop, and I use my 27\" 4K monitor like that, and I am quite happy with the setup.\n", "Q: I'm looking for a shortcut to view all opened windows for same application So I want to reach to that view directly with one shortcut.

A few days ago I learned that my internal SSD is failing. I have a a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running Big Sur, and my hard drive is an APPLE SSD SM0256G. I got the laptop in 2017 and the original hard drive failed in 2019. I got the drive replaced late 2019 and now this one is failing. I understand that SSDs can die at any time and it's inevitable, but considering both drives died in under 3 years I kind of feel like it's something I'm doing/did.\nHere are a few things I suspect.\n\n*\n\n*I use the music creation software Logic Pro X, sometimes several hours per day when I'm working on a project. With both drives I'd constantly get notifs (from the program) saying \"Disk Too Slow\" or \"System Overload - The audio engine was unable to process all required data in time\". I would close out these repeated notifications and keep working past it because I wasn't sure what else to do. One of the suggestions was to increase I/O buffer size so I did, to the maximum setting -- but when I tweak that setting I'm not really sure what that means or what it does.\n\n*I always have tons of tabs open on Chrome. It's always the program using up the most memory and CPU.\n\n*I have \"hardware acceleration\" turned on for Chrome.\n\n*I think my RAM usage dips into my swap file around the clock, especially with the Chrome usage. I'm not exactly sure what that means but I heard that can wear out an SSD.\n\nHere are screenshots of my S.M.A.R.T. data and also info about RAM and swap usage.\n\n\n\n\nI'm uneducated and confused about all of this so I have no idea if the numbers I'm looking at are normal or abnormal for an SSD I've had for 2.5~ years. I'm trying to figure out if it's more likely something I'm doing or if it's natural. If it's something I'm doing, I want to take the best care of my next one as possible.\n\nA: It seems you are using your computer quite a lot and to the limits of its capabilities. This is not a bad thing - essentially it just means that you're getting a lot of value out of your purchase.\nRegarding your 4 points of \"suspect\". Using \"hardware acceleration\" in Chrome does not have anything to do with your SSD. The remaining three points each mean that you're probably using the disk frequently in your work - for example you probably have lots of swapping.\nUsing your disk is not a bad thing in itself. That is afterall what the disk is there for.\nLooking at your SMART values, it seems you have effectively overwritten the full disk almost 4.200 times. That's a lot - so you cannot really blame the disk for warning that it is near the end of its life time. SSDs are a wear part and you will use them up while using your computer.\nIs it something you're doing? - Yes. Is it natural? Also yes.\nYou could stop using your computer so much - the disk would essentially last longer that way. Does it make sense to stop using your computer in order to stop wearing out the disk - not really.\nThe only realistic thing you could do with your current hardware is to ensure that you're only running the programs you actually need at any time. I.e. close down Chrome while spending your time in Logic Pro. It might help slightly. Is it practical? - not really.\nReplacing the hardware is more practical - but of course comes at a cost. If you could upgrade the RAM, it would probably be helpful if you had 16 GB or more RAM instead of the 8 GB you have. But you cannot.\nInstead you should consider buying a larger capacity SSD when you replace the current one. Even though you do not actually use the space on the SSD for storing files, the SSD will itself automatically use that extra space for wear-levelling. If you use the disk in the exact same manner, a 512 GB disk will in theory last twice as long as a 256 GB disk.\nA replacement 240 GB drive from OWC costs $69 currently. If you go for the 480 GB version, the prie is $99.\nI would consider $69 every 3 years a relatively inexpensive wear part!\n", "Q: How to get rid of the Recovery Mode? First, I don't understand anything about Macs. My company sends me one, I press a black button on the top right accidentally and now I have a nice padlock icon asking for a password.\nAfter some googling I find out this:\n\nYou might see the lock icon at startup if you try to start your Mac from another volume like an external drive or macOS Recovery.\n\nOk, nice. So how can I start from the correct volume?\n\nA: It sounds like you were at the FileVault login screen, where there’s a prompt to press that button if you’re having trouble to be taken to recovery.\nAs you have a firmware password set, you will need to enter this to continue.\nIt’s not possible to change the startup disk without entering the firmware password.\n\nA: If you press and hold the startup key for an extended period on newer macs, that puts it in recovery mode. From there you would hold the startup until the mac powers off.\nThen connect to power and open the lid and if needed, press briefly the power button and let go. The system will boot from any available startup disk without needing to press any keys.\nHere are startup keys if you need to navigate things further. Without knowing your macOS version, model / processor type, how the company set up the Mac - we may not have all the information to help you avoid calling them for direct support.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255\n\nA: Booting into Recovery mode normally does not display a padlock, nor does it ask for a password.\nApple's Support pages show this image for when a Firmware password has been set. This prevents anyone without the password from 'tinkering' with the Mac, outside of normal running.\n\nIf you don't know the password, you need to contact your company's IT department.\nYou may still be able to restart the Mac and trigger normal boot-up. Hold the black button down for 5 seconds, until the Mac goes 'dead', and then restart.\n", "Q: Accidental SSH to address Usually when I am doing some development on my mac, I ssh into a virtual machine running on my computer at a 172 address.

I need a temporary iPhone on which I can install WhatsApp in order to keep my conversations, since I will be handing in my current work phone, which is an iPhone, on which I have a lot of WhatsApp conversations. I believe that WhatsApp requires iOS 10 or later to be installed. Which is the cheapest iPhone (presumable the oldest model?) that can run the required iOS version?\n\nA: WhatsApp currently supports iOS 10 or newer; and iPhone 5 is the oldest model that runs iOS 10 (Last version it supports is iOS 10.3.4). This should be the cheapest compatible model, if you can find it.\n", "Q: Where can I find Apple's list of IPSWs for Apple Silicon macs? I've seen multiple sites that show links of links to Big Sur or Monterey software restore files, but none of them explicitly stating their source.

It is done by Google Chrome itself - it's not something that is forced on it by the operating system or anything like that.\nYou could switch to using a browser that doesn't save this attribute. That could for example be the open-source version of Chrome, Chromium. You would then remove the code that writes the attribute and rebuild Chromium.\nAnother option is to remove the attributes after the files have been downloaded. You could use \"Folder Actions\" for this by attaching AppleScript like the following to your Downloads folder:\non adding folder items to theFolder after receiving theFiles\n    repeat with aFile in theFiles\n        set filePath to quoted form of POSIX path of aFile\n        do shell script \"xattr -d com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms \" & filePath\n    end repeat\nend adding folder items to\n\n", "Q: Did Macs have an AV built-in and enabled by default in early 2014?

I recently was setting up IPv6 on my home network and while setting up several nodes noticed that the DHCPv6 server was using these DUID strings to identify clients as it assigned IPv6 IPs to the various hosts.\nNOTE: DUID is the following:\n\nThe DHCP unique identifier (DUID) is used by a client to get an IP address from a DHCPv6 server. It has a 2-byte DUID type field, and a variable-length identifier field up to 128 bytes. Its actual length depends on its type. The server compares the DUID with its database and delivers configuration data (address, lease times, DNS servers, etc.) to the client.\n\nWhere can I find this on the client side via the CLI on MacOS?\nReferences\n\n*\n\n*Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) Wikipedia\n\nA: I was able to piece together a method in which to do this as follows:\n$ sudo plutil -p /var/db/dhcpclient/DUID_IA.plist\n{\n  \"DUID\" => {length = 14, bytes = 0x0001000329b7b1a13c34ec012345}\n  \"HostUUID\" => {length = 16, bytes = 0xf0d23e34de101f1f1be1b4441b412f34}\n}\n\nSo on this particular system it's that 28 character string 0001000329b7b1a13c34ec012345 which is typically represented like this 00:01:00:03:29:b7:b1:a1:3c:34:ec:01:23:45.\nAnd to extract it with a one-liner:\n$ sudo plutil -p /var/db/dhcpclient/DUID_IA.plist \\\n   | awk '/DUID/ {print $8}' \\\n   | sed -e 's/0x//; s/}//; s/.\\{2\\}/&:/g; s/:$//'\n00:01:00:03:29:b7:b1:a1:3c:34:ec:01:23:45\n\nReferences\n\n*\n\n*Finding the DHCPv6 DUID on MacOS X 10.11.6\n\n\n*How do I create a Static IPv6 address\n\n*List DHCP leases held from client\n", "Q: Windows move to different displays and Spaces whenever Mac goes to sleep This is a problem I've experienced in the past, but it seems to have gotten much, much, much worse under Monterey. It's a fairly simple problem: Whenever my computer wakes from sleep, none of my windows are in the places I left them. They sometimes move on the display they're supposed to be on, but more often, they move to other Spaces. If it helps, I use two large external displays on a MacBook Pro with the lid closed.\nI've tried using Display Maid to save and restore window positions, and while this helps somewhat, it can only restore windows to their previous coordinates on the current screen. It has no knowledge of Spaces whatsoever.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Ok, So I upgraded my old iMac to the new power book 14\" 10 16 core gpu. I set up the panels in indesign as I like to have them then the machine went into sleep mode. Upon awakening the main window was halfway down the screen and the palettes had shifted. Meaning moving them back to where they should be. To cut a long story short I bought a new monitor. The problem disappeared. Its something to do with the monitor and the hertz. My work computer monitor is 60. my new monitor is 75hertz.\n\nA: Turns out the monitor Hertz is not the issue. My machine was not in full sleep mode. I used to love apple and adobe products. Now they release without full testing which is very annoying and not acceptable.\n", "Q: Shortcuts in the Shortcuts App disappear after being pinned? I don't know whether this is a bug or whether it's intended behavior and I'm missing something fundamental here, but on Monterey 12.2.1 a ton of my shortcuts have disappeared entirely from the Shortcuts app after having pinned them in the menu bar. They haven't been deleted, rather they're somehow hidden, not being show in All Shortcuts or any other folder. The only exception is the Recently Run folder. (And since the iPhone doesn't have this folder, there they're completely gone.)\nWhat's odd is that they haven't actually been deleted because creating a shortcut with the same name as one of the ones that vanished will report that a shortcut with this name already exists.\n\nA: I figured this out. It seems that \"Pin in Menu Bar\" is implemented via a folder which the Shortcuts app creates behind your back. Pinning a shortcut to the menu bar moves it to this folder behind your back. What's worse, this folder has no name, so the only indication of its presence is the shortcut count shown in light gray at the bottom of the list of folders like this:\n\nWhat's worse is that there's a lag between the time that a shortcut is pinned and the time when it disappears from its original folder and reappears in the pinned folder. All this is very confusing and feels pretty shoddy.\n", "Q: App identified me after buying a new device I used a coupon on an iPhone X. When I tried to use it again I got a message telling me that I can't use the coupon on this device anymore. Few days ago I got an iPhone 13. I downloaded the same App, disabled iCloud for this App and then opened it. I tried to use the coupon and I got the same message. How is that possible? I used the same Apple ID on both devices, but so far as I know, iOS doesn't provide the App ID to the developers.\n\nA: When you use coupons like that, apps will typically register that either locally in the Keychain of the device, or on their server (if you have logged in inside the app).\nOn your new device, you have then either logged into the app (and they will now who you are, and therefore whether or not you have used the coupon before) - or the app reads this information from the Keychain. As you have restored the new phone from a backup of your old phone, this Keychain data is transferred to the new phone - and the app then knows that you have spent the coupon earlier.\n", "Q: How do I keep my external display on after closing my laptop lid?

There seems to be two typical criteria for maximizing battery life of an iPad. One is that getting the charging percentage near 0 or 100% is to be avoided by maintaining the charge between the 20%-80% range. The other criteria is to just keep the iPad connected at all times, so that the battery doesnt charge or recharge at all (or at least stays in the 99%-100% range). I would like to know wich one is the correct aproach.\nNote that the battery health option that Apple mentions to justify that we don't need to pay attention to charging is not present in some iPads.\nJust in case it's useful, I'm asking about an 2021 iPad 9th gen. Which doesn't have the battery health option nor I ever saw it stop at 80%. Also take into account that even when we are told not to overthink these things, there are places in the world where it's 10x more expensive to pay for a battery replacement, so that advice does not apply.\n\nA: The optimal approach is to stay in that 20%-80% range as you indicate. However, in practice the difference between that and simply leaving the iPad plugged in at all times is really, really small.\nThe iPad does not keep charging at the same speed when it hits 100% - so just keeping it plugged in is not going to \"overheat\" the battery\" or \"quickly deteriorate\" the battery. The iPad will trickle-charge at that point. The iPad even has a feature built-in to adjust maximum capacity if you always keep it plugged in so that it starts trickle-charging earlier in order to not keep the battery 100% charged.\nConsider the amount of effort it takes to constantly monitor the battery charge and disconnect/reconnect the iPad, it is simply not worth it for most people.\nEven though you mention that you live in a place in the world where battery replacements are 10x more expensive, I still doubt that it would be worth the time and effort to actually manage charging that way. Is spending hours and hours on hovering over your iPad really worth it, if you can extend the life-span of the battery with 5% for example.\nFor almost everyone, I would say that you do not need to take care of the \"correct approach\" yourself. Just plug in the iPad, and it will automatically take care of charging itself.\n", "Q: 'Not allowed to load local resource' security on WebKit? I just bought a 2021 software version of this famous tax program, but I'm unable to use it because the \"submit\" buttons do not work.\nUpon close inspection (inspect element), I see the problem is likely CORS... however since this is a packaged app I assume it uses some kind of WebKit WebView... which I have no idea how to \"allow\" system-wide.\nI know one can simply disable these security constraints on Safari, or Chrome but I see no way to do it system-wide so that this app works.\nI called support for the software but they are perplexed...

Has anyone else had such weird things happen to them like this? This isn't the first time it's happenend.\n\n\nA: A quick search on google led me to this FFmpeg site. It looks like a proper utility for media file type conversion and real-time encoders from different sources.\nThis app takes up so many resources and heating your Mac could potentially be caused by some work in progress. If you are the one who started the job, such as converting a large media file or recording something from somewhere, you should know it best and decide for yourself whether you want to stop it.\nIf you did not, however, consider ending the task and check the integrity of the process. Take a look at the location of the executable and see if it looks out of place.\nIt could also be a bug in the software itself (or misuse of the app) which most likely can be fixed by a restart of your Mac or reinstalling of the app.\nIf you have never heard of the app before and think that you did not install it by accident or anything, proceed to remove it as soon as possible.\nIf it is an app in your Applications folder, consider using App Cleaner to scan for hidden related files or folders and remove it or just do Cmd+Del on the app.\nIf it is in a form of shell script or any file without a file extension, directly delete it together with any other files or folders you see beside it that looks like it belongs to the executable.\n", "Q: How to sync passwords between Windows Chrome and iCloud Keychain? How can I sync passwords between Chrome and iCloud Keychain, i.e. import passwords stored by Chrome on a Windows desktop computer to the iCloud keychain in order to be used on an iPhone?\n\nA: You can download iCloud for Windows and the iCloud Passwords browser extension for Google Chrome.\n\nA: It's reported here that enabling the iCloud Password extension disables the native Chrome password manager.\nI'm seeing ways to import Google passwords to Keychain on Mac, but not yet how to do it without a Mac.\n\nNote: Always remember that when you will enable the extension for iCloud Passwords, the native password manager for the Chrome browser will be turned off automatically.\n\n", "Q: How to always show current refresh rate of my Mac on screen (MacBookPro18,3) My MacBook Pro has a 120Hz display, and supposedly ProMotion should decrease the refresh rate down to 24Hz when nothing is happening to save battery.\nI installed a Ubersicht widget that constantly moves around, resulting in my screen always running at full refresh rate, draining the battery significantly.\nI need an app that tells me the screen refresh rate at this exact moment, whether it is down to 24hz or up at 120hz (or somewhere in between like 69 or 34.)\nI looked up for \"app that shows refresh rate on Mac\" but all search results I get is \"hold down 'option' key to show refresh rate in settings\" which is not what I want.\nI'm looking for something like Nvidia's GeForce Experience in-game overlay on Windows where you can set a FPS counter at the bottom left of the screen to show current refresh rate by heading to Performance options in it's settings.\nThanks in advance for any suggestions!\n\nA: The \"Quartz Debug\" app provided by Apple does this. It shows a live FPS meter.\n\nIt's part of \"Additional Tools for XCode\" and you're required to login with your Apple ID to download them.  You can find the latest one here: https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=additional%20tools%20XCode\n", "Q: Is Disk Drill able to recover extended attributes? Is Disk Drill, which is commercial file recovery software, able to recover extended attributes of normal files?\n\nA: No, it isn't.\nFor example, com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms, which is automatically added to downloaded files in ~/Downloads, is lost.\nExtended attributes are also used in Photos library, but if you recover a library, the extended attributes that were added by Photos.app to RAW and JPEG files are lost.\n", "Q: Why does `compress` behave differently depending on file types? compress 1.pdf does not compress the file to 1.pdf.Z. But compress 1.sh compress the file to 1.sh.Z. (compress is /usr/bin/compress on macOS.) Does anybody know why is it so? How to make it compresses files regardless of file types?\n\nA: From the man page:\n\nIf compression would not reduce the size of a file, the file is ignored.\n\nCompress is using a very simple compression algorithm and for some files (like PDFs which are already using a compression), the algorithm is not able to reduce the file size. In this case, the result would actually be bigger. In this case, compress is simply leaving the file as-is.\nPass the -f flag if you do want to \"compress\" the file even if it would become bigger. From the man page:\n\n-f             Files are overwritten without prompting for confirmation.  Also, for compress, files are compressed even if they are not actually reduced in size.\n\nSince compress's algorithm isn't very good, I would recommend using a better compressor like bzip2 or xz if you're able to.\n", "Q: How can I completely change an account name, including the record name?

When I view the account in Directory Utility, there is a Record Name field as well as a dozen or so others which still hav the old name. When I change this, the password no longer works. How can I completely purge the old name?\n\nA: Why not create a new account using the new name, transfer what you need from the old account, then delete the old account?\n", "Q: Computer name changes in terminal when connected to Wi-Fi Sorry for my inexperience, I have little experience working with the terminal.\nWhen connected to university wifi, the name changes to something strange that I don't recognize.\n\nHowever, when disconnected from wifi, the terminal reads the name of my computer.\n\nCan anyone tell me what this means or why this happens?\n\nA: I wish people would search.  I think this gets answered perhaps once a week.\nYou have configured your shell to display the hostname of the machine in the prompt.\nThe shell is trying to reverse the computer's IP address to determine the hostname.\nWhen it is connected to your local network, it cannot, so it uses the one you have set in the Sharing pane.\nWhen you are connected to your university wifi, it is successfully able to reverse the IP address to a name, so that is the name it displays.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2018 15\" unable to push 4k60hz to external display (Hisense R7G5 - capable of 4k60hz) Like so many others, I've plugged my 2018 MBP into my TV's HDMI 2.0 port (no DP or USB-C ports on my TV) using a USB-C hub, and it only will display as 4k30hz. My mouse movements are choppy and it's very unsettling lol.\nI'm aware of the limitations that Apple has set upon the USB-C ports when it comes to 4k60hz (as well as the differences between the capabilities of the left and right ports), and have done quite a bit of research already.\n\n*\n\n*I can't even attempt to use SwitchResX or solutions like rebooting into Recovery Mode and disabling certain features because this MBP is a work computer and has safety protocols built-in that block me from trying them.\n\n*I'd like to not drop almost $50 on a hack-y dongle like the Accell USB-C to HDMI 2.0 Adapter, which might not even work based on the very mixed reviews I've read.\n\n*I've read every answer and reply thread on 2018 MacBook Pro + LG 4k display = no 60hz, and none of the solutions have worked (got my hopes up with the Option+Click \"Scaled\" menu in the Display System Preferences, but I still couldn't select 60hz, just 30 or 24).\n\n*Scaling down to 1440 or even 1080 still doesn't give me a 60hz option.\n\n*I tried two different USB-C to HDMI dongles and multiple HDMI 2.0 cables, no change.\n\n*I also tried all 4 ports with those two dongles and HDMI cables.\n\n*Only thing I haven't tried yet is a direct USB-C (Thunderbolt 3) to HDMI cable, an HDMI 2.1 cable, and a non-hub (USB-C to HDMI only... no supplemental USB-A or USB-C ports) dongle.\n\nAnybody have any other tips to get this working, or at least new ones that I can try behind company security protocols?\nEdit: I'm on MacOS Monterey v12.2.1. I'm including some screenshots of my Display Settings menu.\n\n\n\nA: Hilariously, I was wildly overthinking this.\nI bought this 6' USB-C (Thunderbolt 3) to HDMI 2.0 cable on Amazon, and it worked like a charm. 4k. 60hz. HDR. It won't support higher than 4k60hz, though, so if you have a monitor or TV that'll support higher, this solution won't work. (But I don't think a 2018 MBP can even go higher than 4k60hz, so this should be a non-issue.)\n\n", "Q: How to launch terminal session and run on launch. macOS I want to launch two terminal sessions and run a command in each on launch in macOS.\nI want the graphical terminal to launch, I'm not after a launchagent that runs in the background.\nIs this possible?\nThank you!\n\nA: This is the intended function of window groups in terminal app.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/use-window-groups-trml15652/mac\n", "Q: upgrade early 2008 mac pro to run 10.13 or later I have an early 2008 Mac Pro which will only run up to El Capitan [10.11] Is there any hardware upgrade I can do to run later versions [10.13 and later]\nthanks!\n\nA: You can use apps like OCLP.

I thought I could help a friend work through an upgrade from high Sierra to Monterrey on a MacBook Air 2015.\nUnfortunately, the update ended up stuck in a boot loop. When I went into disk viewer in recovery mode, I found that the primary hard drive was ~90% full of shared iCloud junk from my friend's other iCloud users. Obviously, I could go in and rm a bunch of directories, but I'm worried that doing so would delete those files in the synced computers.\nHow do I safely delete enough iCloud files to finish the Monterrey upgrade? Currently, I'm planning on removing my friend from the iCloud shared account so that file changes don't permeate to the other computers.\n\nA: I managed to solve the issue by:\n\n*\n\n*We disconnected the faulty computer from the shared iCloud just in case errors propagated\n\n\n*We booted into recovery mode and inserted a 64GB USB drive (I believe we actually had to mount it inside terminal.)\n\n\n*Using the terminal, we navigated inside the Monterrey update app and found the createinstallmedia command, then formatted the usb drive as update media. See this Apple support post.\n\n\n*This let us delete the update app from the computer, as it was runnable from the USB stick. This is important because the app itself takes up ~12gb of space aside from the space needed by the update process. It's free real estate if you can shunt the update to a usb stick.\n\n\n*I used the find command to locate large files and target them for inspection/deletion, but in the end, you're looking to just delete enough files that Monterrey can install. I mainly was deleting image backups, other people's documents, and cache files, since they're unlikely to be immediately needed or irrecoverable.\n\n\n*Finally, once I had deleted enough files, I went back to the \"main\" page of recovery mode and it asked me if I wanted to install Monterrey.\nGood luck on your own update!\n", "Q: Late 2014 crashing a few times an hour, but not in safe mode.

I really just want 1 or 2 files on from that partition.\nPerhaps windows might help so I want to try to install a second windows bootcamp to access and/or repair 'disk1' but I don't want Bootcamp Assistant to touch 'disk1'. I want it to create a new container 'disk2'  to try to get at fix the files in windows 'disk1' partition.\nMy options:\n\n*\n\n*force bootcamp assistant to create 'disk2' install bootcamp\n\n*rename 'disk1' to 'disk2', install bootcamp\n\n*repair damaged 'disk1' from macOS somehow or use parallels\n\nIts a MacBook Pro with an SSD so I think Trim has erased the data. I just want to try something. Acronis perhaps from another windows install?\nContainer with deleted partition I am trying to recover.\n\nTrying to install another bootcamp to repair disk1 but I want it to use a different container like disk2 so it doesn't touch disk1.\n\n\nA: Below is my assessment of what you did. If I am wrong, post a comment.\nYour version of macOS is either Big Sur or Monterey. Your internal SSD initially three partitions. Initially, the NTFS formatted Windows volume resided in the third partition (disk0s3). You used the Disk Utility to replace this partition with a new partition which was initialized as an APFS container (disk1). You then removed all volumes in this container, which by default would be a single volume (disk1s1).\nThe equation below indicates there is no appreciable free space below this new partition.\n257 GB + 42 GB ≃ 299.8 GB\n\nThe values of 257 GB and 42 GB where taken from the second image you posted and the value of 299.8 GB was taken from the first image you posted. This means the new partition spans most (if no all) of the original Windows partition.\nI should point out that the macOS you have currently installed can read NTFS formatted volumes. Installing Windows will probably not cause the missing NTFS formatted volume to become accessible. At least not under the circumstances which you lost the volume.\nThe actions you have executed so far should have caused the header of the NTFS volume to be overwritten. If so, then you will not be able to recover files my just mounting the volume.\nThere are a variety of third party applications which can be used to recover lost files. These exist for both macOS and Windows. Such applications may require removal of third partition from the partition table in order to search for files residing in the space occupied by this partition.\nIf you still want to install Windows, then consider installing Windows on an external drive. Or, shrink container where macOS resides, then install Windows in the free space. Both of these installs will have to be done manually without the use of the Boot Camp Assistant.\n", "Q: UPPAAL: bad CPU type in executable I am using the terminal on an Apple M1 MacBook. I am executing the terminal with Rosetta, trying to be compatible for a tool that is not for ARM. The tool itself is the UPPAAL tool for 32-bit Mac OS X, version 4.0.13. The program opens but I get an error when trying to use it:\nCannot run program \"/Users/Me/Uppaal/bin-Darvin/server\": error=86, Bad CPU type in executable\n\nI am getting this error if I try to use the script and if I try to run manually the executables, even if I am trying to execute them with \"arch -x86_64\" before them. I acknowledge that the problem is probably caused because my computer is ARM-based while this is probably not an ARM code. However, would it be possible to sort this out with Rosetta or any similar tool? Perhaps Rosetta is not working properly on my computer?\n\nA: Apple Silicon macs can only run 64 bit code; 64 bit Intel is run via Rosetta.\nAs you say in the question you are trying to run a 32 bit version of UPPAAL. The mac can't run this and gives the error as expected of Bad CPU type in executable. Intel 32 bit and 64 bit are different CPUs as far as MacOS is concerned.\nLooking at UPAALL's web site you need to run a development version of 4.1 or higher which is a 64 bit executable\n", "Q: Cannot wipe iPad I have an iPad with another user still logged into iCloud with their Apple ID. That person has left the company and cannot remember her Apple ID password. She has tried resetting her Apple ID password but we do not have access to her emails.\nTherefore we cannot wipe the iPad. What can we do?\n\nA: If your company is an educational institution, and you have proof that the iPad is owned by this institution, you need to call Apple Education to have them unlock it. This has happened several times where I work, and Apple has always been able to do this for us. Seeing that we're required to purchase directly through Apple, serial numbers of our Apple devices are already in their records.\nI'd call Apple Support in any case to find out the steps you need to take, but providing proof of ownership is essential.\n", "Q: Convert SVG to PDF using command line in Mac OSX I want to convert a SVG file to PDF from the command line on Mac OSX.

I want to take a backup of the folder ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync which houses my iOS Backups on my MacOS computer.\nTo do the backup, I'm planning on archiving this folder with file compression, using the application Keka. However, I am unsure which file compression format is suitable for this (e.g. 7Z, GZIP, BZIP2, etc) – and what are the appropriate settings for the selected format.\nMy objectives are:\n\n*\n\n*To make the archive reliable for extraction in the future.\n\n*To make it take up as little space as possible, however with reliability (1. above) being the most important objective.\n\nWhat is the appropriate file compression format for backups of MacOS files – also considering MacOS metadata – given these objectives, and what are the appropriate settings – e.g. should I use \"Solid Archive\" or not?\n\nNB: Keka currently seems to support the formats: 7Z, ZIP, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, XZ, LZIP, BROTLI, ZSTD, LRZIP, AAR, WIM, DMG, ISO\n\nA: Note: If you've selected the option to encrypt your iOS backups, they won't compress.\nAdditional note: if your backup is mainly composed of already-compressed media (photos and videos), they won't compress well.\nOtherwise, your best bet is either lrzip, 7zip, or xz. I don't know how big each of your backups are, but if it's, say, 2-3GB, you can likely try each of the options. The best option is dependent on the type of data - you won't know unless you test it. In general, I'd recommend using 7zip. It seems to go decently quick and offers fairly good compression. xz typically gives comparable compression to 7zip. lrzip takes considerably more time, uses considerably more RAM, but typically has the best compression.\nOther formats such as zip, bzip2, and gzip are older and don't provide the best amount of compression.\n", "Q: MacBook Air M1 with ultrawide monitor I have a 13” MacBook Air M1 laptop, and I'm planning to buy a 35” ultrawide monitor for work.

We tested the M1 macs with Apple Pro Display 6016 by 3384 pixels (20.4 million pixels) and it’s amazing and fast. Dell, LG are also good workhorses.\n\n*\n\n*Citrix, TeamViewer, ARD, VNC, RDC all work very well and crisply.\n\nWe prefer these connections for speed, clarity and robustness.\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbolt > USB-C > DisplayPort > HDMI > USB > DisplayLink\n\nHDMI and lower have issues that are easy to come across and/or frustrating to fix or diagnose for work needs IMO. If you’re making money with this setup, stay to the left of HDMI unless your support team has specific cables and models they support.\n\nA: M1 Air has no issues displaying resolutions up to 5120*1440 on a 49 inch ultrawide or 5120x2160 on 5k2k screens.\nMake sure to pick up a monitor with USB-C connector and at least 65W power delivery.\nAs for Citrix and remote access, I don't have experience. Having said that, if Citrix is an app on a Mac, it should work with whatever you connect to your mac.\n", "Q: Mplayer shows movie on a quarter screen only I just did an upgrade to MacOS 12.2.1 on a MacBook Air and now when I use mplayer to watch a video only a quarter of the area is shown.

I use a Macbook air M1 2020 (its SSD is 512 GB), and an external SSD of 1 TB used only for Time Machine with this Macbook. I tried to restore a backup done a week ago, but I received the following message once I arrived in the phase \"Selection the information to transfer\" (I want to select them all):\n\"Not enough space available to transfer. Select fewer items to continue.\"\nNotice that the sum of the items is less than 512 GB. In other posts and forums, I found that this problem was encountered with a backup in a large disk to be restored in a smaller disk.\nHowever, I do not understand not even why I encountered this problem because the disks used are always the same. Hence, I think that the backup of the Macbook with SSD 512 GB should fit into its own SSD 512 Gb. Moreover, the free space on the Macbook internal SSD is now around 250 GB...\nQuestion: How can I solve this issue?\n\nA: Time Machine isn't a 'full backup' of your drive. Specifically, it is \"to automatically back up your personal data, including apps, music, photos, email, and documents\" as Apple says on their support site. So do not expect Time Machine to be able to restore your entire SSD, as it is NOT an image. If you need an image, I recommend Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper apps.\nTime Machine Restoration is supported in two ways: 1) individual files, and 2) entire categories.  For individual files, you can enter the Time Machine interface from the app, find your file (and the date) and then restore that file. For categories, you access this via Migration Assistant, where you can restore your account preferences, apps, and documents. Migration Assistant is typically used after a Restore, where the drive is wiped and MacOS has been reinstalled. Note that this can be destructive, as Migration Assistant will overwrite or delete any matching files and your entire account and preferences.\nSo, restoring everything depends on what you mean by everything:\n\n*\n\n*The entire SSD? No, it can't do that.\n\n*Your Documents folder? Yes, Time Machine can do that.\n\n*Your User Account? Yes, Time Machine can do that.\n\n*MacOS? No, Time Machine can't do that, but if you Restore from the\nBoot Partition and then use Time Machine you will get everything\n\nA: I'd be tempted to leave out something bulky yet easy to do manually - like the Photos Library - then check remaining space afterwards & see if it will fit.\nIf not, you then have the relative luxury of picking through already-transferred data to find some space.\nBTW, it's not wise to keep your boot drive close to full at any time. You really ought to leave 10-15% free space at all times. It might be time to get an external for these bulky items, long-term.\n", "Q: Install a package with an expired certificate I just noticed I can double-clik, open and install a .pkg package installer that has an expired certificate without any popup like \"This package is from an developer whose certificate has expired\" or \"This package has expired\". Instead there is no alert at all.\nIf I click on the top right \"Lock\" symbol, in the details of the certificate, I see a green tick mark with \"This certificate is valid\".\n\nIs it the normal behaviour?\nIs it true on all recent Mac OS X version that I can install old installers from a few years ago (for which the developer certificate has expired), without having an alarming popup?\nI have myself a few old .pkg installers (the program itself has not been updated), and I don't know if it's mandatory for me to rebuild the installer with my new certificate, or if everyone can still install the old installer (with expired certificate) without any alarm.\n\nA: A quick search of the web shows that as long as the certificate was not expired when the installer was created, then macOS ignores the expiration date when installing. For example, you can read the statement: \"While Developer ID certificates and provisioning profiles have an expiry date, the system is meant to ignore them.\"\n", "Q: Script for freeing storage taken by \"Other\" in Mac? Every time I have to do this, I go to ~/Library/caches, and then ~Library/Application Support etc etc. It is a tedious process.\nIs there some script online that we could just run with Sudo & make sure that all the files that are safe to be deleted are deleted?\nThanks!\n\nA: Like a couple of comments said, you should not delete files in ~/Library/Application Support merely to free up space as there are a lot of things in there that various Applications (and macOS) need and use every time they are run.\nI am sure there are scripts out there that will delete caches on demand. In fact macOS has a number of the procedures built in that run daily/weekly/monthly that do just that: clean up cache/temporary files. So you don't need to do this as macOS does it for you.\nHowever, in certain circumstances and for troubleshooting purposes it is sometimes desirable to tell the system to run those procedures and delete other temporary/cache files on demand.\nThere are a number of \"cleaning\" utilities out there. I use a free one called Onyx.

Here is the formula that I am using:\nINT(B13)×14+IF(INT(B13)≠B13,(B13−INT(B13))×10^(LEN(B13)−FIND(\".\",B13)))\n\nMy stone and lbs are written in this format:  12.2, which would equal 12 stones and 2 lbs.\nWith this formula I get the blue flag and the message:\n\nThe formula uses a Boolean in place of a number\n\nIs there anyway I can correct my formula and get rid of the blue flag?  It calculates everything, it's just this blue flag makes it look unprofessional.\n\nA: I expect you get that warning message when the input to the formula, i.e.  the weight in stone and lbs, is an integer such as 12 instead of, for example, \"12.2\".\nThis would happen because the IF() function in the formula you posted returns the logical value of FALSE to the formula if the weight is an integer. To fix this, use the following formula, for example, instead:\nINT(B13) × 14 + IF( INT(B13)≠B13, (B13 − INT(B13)) × 10^(LEN(B13) − FIND(\".\", B13)), 0 )\n\nYou can paste and use the formula exactly as shown above. The fix is the \", 0\" added towards the end. A few spaces are added to the formula only to improve its readability; they would not affect how it actually works.\n", "Q: Seeking a mechanism to hang a MacBook Pro from desk I'd like to find a way to hang my MacBook Pro from my desk in a way that makes it easy to connect to my monitor and to the peripherals.\nI've seen the Twelve South BookArc Stand for MacBook, but I'd prefer something that doesn't consume desktop space.\n\nA: Do you have the caliper to make one DIY? Here is a great idea from DIY Perks (a well-known youtube channel with fantastic ideas): https://youtu.be/tGX34631pdk. It takes some skill and materials, but overall, it isn't too hard.\nFULL Disclusure: I have not created or used this before.\n\nA: I have two articulating arms on my computer desk at work. One arm has a 27\" BenQ monitor attached to it, the other uses this Laptop VESA Mount tray to hold my MBP above my desk to provide space underneath on my desktop. There are other manufacturers which have similar trays for sale. You could purchase a double articulating arm and using the tray, accomplish what you want if the external monitor has VESA mounting holes (and most of them do.)\nI highly recommend this solution, no matter what equipment you purchase. I use a wireless mouse & keyboard, making the whole setup pretty slick!\n\n\nA: If your monitor has standard VESA mounting holes, you could attach something like this StarTech.com Thin Client Mount.\n\n", "Q: NEW Apple Magic Keyboard: F1 to F12 keys do not work, cannot adjust brightness, sound volume, etc I use iMac (27-inch, Late 2012) running on Catalina 10.15.7 (19H1715).

If this is the problem, then holding the Fn (bottom-left) and F12 would work to increase the volume but not F12 by itself.\nmacOS keeps these settings on a per-keyboard basis, so perhaps somehow it got toggled for the new keyboard you connected.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with the magic keyboard 2 on iMac (late 2013) High Sierra 10.13.6. It is as though these buttons do not exist and are not recognised. The only thing that worked was installing Karabiner-Elements app.\nhttps://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/\nYou can download the version that corresponds to your operating system.\n\n\nA: The only think that worked for me was forgetting the keyboard in  bluetooth settings, and pairing it again.

For forensic analysis/malware hunting.  I’m aware there open source frameworks and apps where you can tail the live syslog, but the log level isn’t granular enough.\n\nA: If this is an app you're developing yourself, you can use Xcode and the accompanying Instruments program to setup a Network tracer. From there you can see for example all the HTTP calls that your app makes.\nAnother option is various forms of proxies and VPN software that you can use to intercept, log and view network traffic.

Begin by following steps 1 through 3 of the instructions given in this answer, then proceed with the instructions given in this answer.\n\nNote: Since the current version is now 11.2.0, the file to be downloaded is named firmware-11.2.0-i386-DVD-1.iso.\n\nWhen the image below appears, select either Graphical install or Install. Here, Install was chosen, as shown below.\n\nContinue with the installation. When an image similar to below appears, select <No>.\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, select Guided - use entire disk.\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, select the line containing (sda).\n\nNote: Your sizes and drive descriptions will be different from what appears in the images.\n\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, select the line containing All files in one partition.\n\nFor this example, the result is shown below. Select Finish partitioning and write changes to disk.\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, select <Yes>.\n\nProceed with the installation. When an image similar to the one shown below appears, select <No>.\n\nProceed with the installation. When an image similar to the one shown below appears, either choose a mirror or avoid using a mirror. In this example, the mirror is avoided, thus decreased the time required to install. Avoiding the mirror can be accomplished by selecting <No>.\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, probably the only software required is the standard system utilities. In this example, a Debian desktop environment will be omitted to decrease the time required to install. Below is the configuration used in this example. When done making choices, select Continue.\n\nProceed with the installation. If an image similar to the one shown below appears, select <Yes>.\n\nNote: The message in the image below refers to installing GRUB to your primary drive for an UEFI boot. This message is incorrect. By selecting Yes, GRUB will be installed in the master boot record for a BIOS boot.\n\n\nWhen an image similar to the one shown below appears, select the line containing /dev/sda.\n\nNote: The message in the image below refers to installing GRUB for an UEFI boot. This message is incorrect. Instead, GRUB will be installed in the MBR of the device selected for a BIOS boot.\n\n\nFinish installing Debian.\n\n\n*Boot to Debian, insert the Mint installer flash drive and enter the following commands.\nsu --login\nmount -o ro /dev/sdb1 /mnt\ncp /mnt/live/vmlinuz /root\ncp /mnt/live/initrd.lz /root\nshutdown -r now\n\n\n\n*When the Grub menu appears, immediately press the C key, then enter the commands below.\nroot=(hd0,msdos1)\nlinux /root/vmlinuz boot=live config live-media-path=/live --\ninitrd /root/initrd.lz\nboot\n\nIf you want to boot the installer in compatibility mode, then replace the above linux command with the command given below.\nlinux /root/vmlinuz boot=live config live-media-path=/live xforcevesa nomodeset b43.blacklist=yes ramdisk_size=1048576 root=/dev/ram rw noapic noacpi nosplash irqpoll --\n\n\n\n*Install Mint by replacing Debian.\n\nNote: Read the section titled \"Setting BIOS Booting as the Default\" in this answer.\n\n", "Q: How to fix incorrect command line mail user name on macOS?

But if I type mail I see the following:\nmail: /var/mail/Chris: Permission denied\n\nIf I list the contents of /var/mail/ I see\nchris\n\ni.e. all lower case of Chris.  If I do id -un I get\nChris\n\ni.e. it starts with capital C.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: On a standard installation of macOS, the file system is case-insensitive. This means that /var/mail/Chris and /var/mail/chris refers to the same file. As such there's nothing to fix in that regard.\nHowever, you are left with the first error message stating that permission was denied accessing the file. You can elevate your privileges to super user by using the sudo command (assuming your account is able to do so), and then make sure your user has the necessary permissions for the file. Open Terminal and run commands like this:\nsudo chown Chris /var/mail/chris\nsudo chmod u+r /var/mail/chris\n\nNow the mail command should succeed in reading the file. If it doesn't you could be running into privacy restrictions. You can fix that by opening System Preferences, click , Security & Privacy, select the Privacy tab, select Full Disk Access in the list on the left, and then add Terminal to the list on the right (and ensure it has a checkmark).\n", "Q: How to enable Messenger notifications on Mac 12.2.1? I recently upgraded to MacOS 12.2.1 on an MacBook Air and now there seems to be a problem with messenger notifications.\nIn the messenger app it says: \"messenger notifications are turned off\", but when open the System Preferences, they are activated. See screenshot:\n\nNow what is the status? Are notifications enabled or not? Is that a bug in messenger or in MacOS? The messenger app seems to be up-to-date. How to solve this problem?\n\nA: This is most probably a bug in the Messenger App.\nThis happens, when the implementation of an macOS App is not updating this part of code:\nnotificationCenter.requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound]) { success, error in {\n\n        // Checking System Settings and apply update here\n\n    }\n}\n\nMost probably, the App does not check this. A fresh reinstall (of the app) with flushing caches could fix the issue.\nThe right part of your screenshot shows, what the app is allowed to do by the system.\nThe left part shows the implementation and what the app will do when notifications occur.\n\nA: Did you try turning it off and back on?\nOther thing I can think of is uninstalling it with an uninstalled (ex.

I bought a MacBook Air M1 (basic version) and I wanted to connect it to my external monitor (Samsung C34H890WJUX Curved monitor) via USB-C. MacBook battery is charging when it's connected to the monitor, but external monitor is not recognized! I'm sure my cable and external monitor works fine because it works with my old Thinkpad with Linux via USB-C and it works with MacBook Pro 2017 via USB-C, but it doesn't work with MacBook Air M1 with macOS Monterey. I read somewhere on the web that it works only with display port, but I don't want to buy any additional dongles or cables until I'm sure that it really works. Ideally I would like to make it work via USB-C.\nRegards,\nPiotr\n\nA: Okay, I received my USB-C -> Display Port cable at it works with my external monitor. It seems that MacBook Air M1 simply does not work with USB-C -> USB-C cable for connecting external displays and it just charges the battery.\n\nA: To summarise, I don't know the problem but I hope the added info helps people understand the issue and may be able to help us all.\nIt's an issue with the M1/M2 MacBooks. I got the exact same issue.\nMy M1 MacBook is connected to Samsung UW curved monitor.\nMy Monitor has USB ports for my keyboard/mouse dongle and webcam.\nWhen my MacBook is connected, the keyboard/mouse work fine, the webcam works fine, MacBook is charging. BUT my monitor display remains black.\nThe occasional times it does work, it can cause the screen to jitter.\nIt didn't work with the Samsung-provided cable, but when I switched to a Thunderbolt 3 cable by Belkin, it worked 9 out of 10 times.\nMost recently, it's been playing up again and I don't know why.\nI read it's due to the frame rates not matching up, as the MacBooks now have ProMotion Technology?\nFunnily, my colleague has a similar setup with a Dell monitor and he's managed to connect 3 screens with no issue.\nI also didn't have an issue with an Intel MacBook.\n", "Q: Why must I re-save a file from Mac in order for it to work? I have an issue for which I have a work-around solution. I'm hoping to eliminate the work-around to improve production efficiency.\nMy associate's server automatically runs a script that outputs a large file of research data (all text) in a json string and saves it as a huge (4MB+) .json file.\nI retrieve this file via ftp. My understanding is that the ftp software (Fetch) delivers the file to me just as it was saved.\nWhen I try to process the file contents (from Terminal) using a Python script, I receive this error:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/me/Documents/client drop folders/client1/pythonScript.py\", line 61, in <module>\n    sourceData = json.loads(line.decode(\"utf-8\"))\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 2547902: invalid continuation byte\n\nThe character at this position is a space — though that seems moot, considering my work-around:\nMy work-around is simply opening the file and resaving it (either by using VSCode's standard save dialogue OR by simply using my Mac's TextEdit and choosing to save with utf-8 character encoding and a .json extension) and overwriting the file.\nThe Python file processes the json with no errors after this re-saving of the source file.\nIf I run file -I sourceFile.json on the save before re-saving it, then it produces:\nsourceFile.json: text/plain; charset=utf-8\nAfter the re-save, the same Terminal command produces the same:\nsourceFile.json: text/plain; charset=utf-8\nWhy would the file perform differently before and after re-saving it?\nI would appreciate any knowledgeable advice or answers. Is there a better troubleshooting method than the Terminal file -I command?\nThanks in advance.\n\nAppendices:\ndiff output:\n1c1\n< (entire content of file 1 from server)\n\\ No newline at end of file\n---\n> (entire content of file 2 saved on Mac)\n\\ No newline at end of file\n\ncmp output:\nold/file.json new/file.json differ: char 2547903, line 1\n\n\nA: It appears that the issue was that the source file was indeed not saved with utf-8 encoding, despite what file -I indicated. I was able to examine the php script which produced the original json output and was also able to pass the text through the php function utf8_encode to solve the problem.\nIf others in this forum are having similar difficulties, I highly recommend reading through the comments on the opening question, as they provide good troubleshooting tools and advice.\n", "Q: What programs do I need to reinstall after switching to M1? I got a new M1 MBP, and I restored a time machine backup. I found out that electron-based apps (like Slack and Hyper) ran slowly because they were built for an Intel processor, and after deleting them and installing the M1 versions, they ran very quickly. Zoom was the only application to prompt me to update.\nWhat are the other applications that would benefit from me deleting them and installing the M1 version? Is there a way for me to determine which of the ones I have would benefit?\n\nA: Everything listed as \"Intel\" on the right of:\nApple menu > About this Mac > System Report > Software > Applications\n\nNote that for some Applications, there might not be a Apple Silicon or Universal option to install, in which case the only option is continuing to use the Intel version (which will run in an emulator).\n", "Q: Why is 'mds' accessing my Time Machine drive all the time?

It runs basically whenever you have file access by design so looking for it will cause it to run. Your open files are needed in case you decide to search for something, so ejecting the drive will free up these resources for other tasks / recording work.\nI wouldn’t worry about this at all unless there’s a different measurable issue you want to focus on. I eject the drive when I don’t want it running and that will cut off all your issues and then you don’t need to manage the schedule as much.\n\nA: I can't replicate your exact setup here, but I would suggest doing the following:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n\n*Click Spotlight\n\n\n*Select the Privacy tab\n\n\n*Click + and add your Time Machine drive (the whole drive) to the list\nHopefully this will stop mds from accessing your Time Machine drive for indexing.

The iPhone itself seems to not be dead, but it´s locked and shows no visual indication whatsoever.\nWhen pressing power button + volume down, I can force power it off. And using the power button, I can put it on again. I know that it´s on because the button vibrates upon \"pressing\" it (it´s vibration simulated).\nSome of the data on it is not backed up in iCloud, and we need it.\nConnecting it via Lightning to USB of a PC doesn´t do anything, nothing shows up in iTunes.\nI had the intuition that it might work better on a Mac. So how can I pair / connect it to a previously unknown MacOS system via cable without unlocking it? What can we do to save data that would be lost on the phone otherwise?\n\nA: You will need to get the screen replaced first.\nTo connect to any computer for the first time, you need to \"Trust\" from the phone's screen & also unlock it with either TouchID or PIN.\nJust replacing the screen should not affect data.\n", "Q: Mac shut down during update I just tried updating my Mac mini to the latest version of macOS, and when I thought the update was finished, my Mac wouldn’t start up or display any image on my monitor.

When she prints a colour picture, the paler parts come out with a green/blue cast; she's had the iMac/printer combination for a couple of years now and had no problems whatsoever before now.\nBut here's the thing: the cartridges are all full, the nozzle check looks perfect, and when we \"Copy\" using the scanner to print directly the same image looks perfect. That says to me that the printer is working correctly, and that there is something wrong with the connection to the iMac (or something is wrong with the iMac) -- but I'm a Windows man so I don't understand the details.\nWe have tried deleting the printer (including the /Library/Printers/Epson folder), reinstalling the driver from Epson Support, then adding the printer again, and that made no difference.\nShe says she cannot think of any change she might have made to the printer since the last time it printed properly. She doesn't print every week but she thinks it was working okay a couple of months ago.\nDoes anyone have any ideas please? I've struggled searching online because the vast majority of the suggestions are to do with changing cartridges, and we are pretty sure that isn't the problem (because it prints directly from the integrated scanner just fine).\n\nA: Well, we managed to 'fix' it. We tried printing from a MacBook with the same result, and from an iPhone ditto. Then we had the idea of changing the media from the default to 'Plain Paper' and that worked from the MacBook, but when my daughter tried it from her iMac it still failed.\nThen I noticed that she was automatically whacking the Quality up to 'High'. When she tried leaving it on 'Normal' the printout was perfect.\nI still don't quite see how either of those two things could cause the blue/green cast to parts of the image, but there you go.\nThanks to everyone for getting involved.\n", "Q: Importing Safari reading list to Pocket I'd like to pull (long) my safari reading list into Pocket.

When this happens, Safari also hangs and will not resolve any web page. After 5-10 minutes, the problem resolves itself and all the pending tabs either load or refresh and the system is fine again.\nI have tried to narrow it down:\n\n*\n\n*When hanging, I cannot even access an ip address on my local network or local to my machine\n\n*Connecting to a VPN does not fix it\n\n*All other software works fine (spotify, slack, command-line tools)\n\n*I can ping my DNS host and make DNS requests over the command-line, all ok\n\n*I can use nmap to make port 80 requests to other hosts, all ok\n\n*I am running the standard built-in firewall, but no other firewall or antivirus software\n\nI'm completely stumped. Any suggestions as to what I could try next?\n\nA: As a temporary fix whenever this happens to my M1 Max MacBook Pro running macOS 12.5, I've used the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that this particular problem is happening by opening an entirely different web browser and visit a simple page like https://example.com/ — if it hangs there as well, we need to continue\n\n*Disable the Wi-Fi connection via either Settings > Network > Turn Wi-Fi Off, or by using the Menu Bar dropdown for Wi-Fi\n\n*Wait for the hanging webpage tabs to recognize the dropped network connection (easiest to track the fresh web browser in step #1)\n\n*Re-enable the Wi-Fi connection\n\nI think the underlying issue is that I migrated from an Intel-Based MacBook Pro—I've never seen this issue with two other M1-based MacBooks I used regularly, and neither of them had been migrated from an Intel-based MacBook.  The behavior also seems to show up only when I'm opening several tabs in rapid succession, though I'm less confident on that count.\nI strongly suspect that completely erasing all content and settings on the MacBook would fix the issue—there's probably a network setting somewhere that was migrated when it shouldn't have been.  I haven't yet reached the level of desperation/annoyance necessary to try that fix, though, and have not yet determined which network setting is the problem.\nIn addition to the troubleshooting steps listed in the original question, I've also confirmed that:\n\n*\n\n*curl works fine in Terminal when the browsers (Google Chrome and Safari) are both acting up\n\n*Disabling the built-in firewall does not prevent the issue from happening\n\nEDIT: (7 months later) I'm still living with this problem, but another (strange) workaround I've found is to avoid opening new websites too quickly.\nMost simple websites work just fine, but I've found these sites to reliably trigger the behavior when I visit them in new tabs in Google Chrome:\n\n*\n\n*reddit.com\n\n*facebook.com\n\n*mail.google.com (refreshing the inbox in an already-open tab can trigger here)\n\nTo safely visit those websites, I open a new tab, type the website name to get it to autocomplete, then count to ten before hitting Enter.  Weirdly, this seems to completely prevent the bug from triggering!\n", "Q: Is the M1 chip on the 2021 24\" iMac the same as the M1 chip on the 2020 Macbook Air? My workplace is offering me a choice of either a 24\" iMac (2021) with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD, or a Macbook Air (2020) with twice as much RAM and storage.  Both have, as far as I can tell, the same M1 chip.\nObviously the most notable difference between these two devices is the size and form factor: the 24\" iMac display has almost 3.5x as much real estate as the 13\" Macbook Air does. But what I'm wondering about is the performance and speed of the two devices.  Is it really the same M1 chip in both?  Should I expect one of these devices to run faster, more reliably, etc. than the other?\nSince people have asked in the comments:  I am a Lecturer at a University.  The most intensive thing I use it for is teaching on Zoom while keeping six Google Jamboards simultaneously open in different windows, while Google Drive syncs in the background. But my current computer (a 2013 iMac) has become so slow that I cannot simultaneously run Zoom, Google Drive, and Firefox without one or more of them crashing.\nBut just to be clear:  I am not asking for advice or opinions on which system to buy, or whether a laptop or desktop is better for my use case.  I can decide that for myself!  I am just wondering whether I can expect one of these two systems to run (generally) faster than the other, given that they have the same CPU but one has twice as much RAM. My naive instinct is to usually assume that a newer desktop computer would have some kind of performance advantage over a (slightly) older Macbook. Is there any reason to think that is the case here?\n\nA: \n\"I am just wondering whether I can expect one of these two systems to\nrun (generally) faster than the other, given that they have the same\nCPU but one has twice as much RAM.\"\n\nYes, they both have the same M1 CPU. However, there are limiting factors on the M1's performance in both options. There is no fan cooling in the MBA, so it will throttle performance to reduce heat, if necessary.\nConversely, the limited RAM in the iMac may also be a performance bottleneck; though these Macs do have impressive resilience when swapping out to disk, because of the fast SSD.\n\nA: It is the same chip see apple documents for that e.g. imac\nMake sure you get 16G memory in either case. Not getting that is really a problem. Not so much necessarily on performance but on how much your company values your time, the extra cost is minimal\nHowever the important difference is do you want a laptop or a desktop ie do you want to use it in more than one place.\n", "Q: macos apps not going back to macbook display from external display when external display is powered off I have an external display connected to my macbook. External display doesn't have power backup. Whenever power goes off apps running on external display do not come back to the MacBook display. I have to remove the display cable to get them back. Anyone else facing this? Is this the default behaviour? Can it be fixed somehow or is there some workaround for it to get apps to macbook everytime external display is switched off or power goes off?\n\nA: I think this works as intended. I have a display connected to a switch, so I can use it on the MacBook and another computer concurrently. If that would result in my apps being re-arranged or put the MacBook to sleep every time, it would be extremely annoying.\n", "Q: iOS Simulator gives 'You dont have permission error' I am currently on macOS Monterey 12.2 and have started an iPhone 12 iOS 15.0 simulator.

I am using my Macbook Air M1 2020 with a new external 32\" 4K monitor I just bought since the file names' character size, or the Chrome bookmark text is too small.\nHence, I noticed I could just use in System->Display a \"scaled\" resolution in the middle between \"Larger text\" and \"More space\" (by default, it was set as \"More space\").\nIt seems that images, videos, and text are still in 4K (text is just larger as the resolution was the one I chose in the middle among the \"scaled\" resolutions, but it is crisp exactly like it was 4K).\nQuestion: Could you please confirm that the \"Lager text\" VS \"More space\" trade-off indeed does not affect the 4k resolution of an external monitor?\n\nA: First, a history lesson. The very first Apple computers had displays with 72 pixels per inch. This is the same size as 1 point (a unit of 1/72 inches), so 1 point = 1 pixel. Text at 12pt would display on the screen at 12/72 = 1/6 of an inch.\nModern display screens have much smaller pixels, so you get more of them to an inch. This makes the display of images very clear, but means that objects (such as text) are corresponding smaller.\nYour 32-inch 4K display has a pixel density of 150 pixels per inch. So 12 point text will display at less than half the size of the old 72ppi screens!\nThe solution is for the computer to double the size of everything. This is called \"scaling\". So when the computer measures the size of something, it 'pretends' it is twice as big, and then it lays it out on the screen.\nSo your display is using all its 4K pixels, but the objects are twice as large. So a 1 pixel object now uses a 2x2 pixel square, and those pixels can be slightly different to give greater clarity and shading.\nThe option in System Preferences lets you choose a scaling size. You can make things smaller, and consequently get more of them on the screen; or make things larger, and thus (like zooming in) see slightly less content. But the actual pixels used are the same.\nSo you are indeed benefitting from the clarity and sharpness of the 4K display, but with objects scaled to a size that is more comfortable.\n", "Q: How to minimize all open windows when using Firefox?

I'd like to set up screen time limits without allowing myself to infinitely ignore the limits (because my spine is a stack of cotton candies and I can't trust myself to not just click ignore). Unfortunately I think because I am the iCloud family administrator account I always get to ignore limits, and I don't think there's a way to get away from that.\nCan someone confirm that if I create a new iCloud account and set my age to be that of a minor, and add that account to my family, and then switch my computer and phone to that account, then I will have no way out of the screen time limits? Are there any unforeseen consequences you'd highlight for such a switch? Might certain apps or songs be age-limited so I won't be able to access them on that account? Can I still add my credit-card to the phone's wallet, when my phone uses a minor's account? I'm hoping to find a downside-free way of truly locking myself out of e.g. YouTube in the evening.\nI'm also up for hearing other ways of imposing hard limits on myself, if there are other apps or systems you think I should consider (but please don't say \"grow a spine\" unless there's an app for that :)\n\nA: Harcker wrote this in a comment:\n\nYou could ask someone you trust to create a \"Screen Time Passcode\" for you (They can be setup in Settings-> Screen Time).

About one in three times, it's completely frozen (black screen) when she opens it in the morning, and she has to force reboot it.\nNothing is plugged into her laptop except the power cord. I've had her leave it unplugged overnight to see if it makes any difference, but it still happens some nights and not others. I've also had her leave the lid open, but that doesn't alter the frequency of the hangs either.\nI've looked at system.log and friends, but to no avail. To my relatively untrained eye the logs look normal until the system freezes, then there's a gap of a few hours until the manual reboot begins. I've also run the system diagnostics at boot, which found no issues.\nSince it was initially set up from an x86 SuperDuper clone of a system that was itself upgraded in-place for a decade, my totally random guess is that maybe there's some crufty old x86 app or process that just isn't playing nicely with Rosetta. But that's based on nothing other than the fact that there's no obvious hardware culprit.\nAre there any specific logs or messages I should look for to diagnose the issue? If not, what else might I try short of a complete wipe and restore, which may well just restore whatever glitch is causing the issue anyway?\n(If it was my own laptop, at this point I'd probably just admit defeat and do a clean install, and reinstall and set up every app as I needed it... but that's really not an option with my wife's.)\nUpdate 2022-05-08: Following suggestions below, I've now weeded out as much old cruft as I can using EtreCheck, reinstalled Monterey, and tried a different power brick.

By default, this will not wipe the apps and data, but may install something necessary for the M1 that wasn't on the Intel clone source.\nI would also download and run EtreCheck. This will give you a detailed report on the state of the Mac's software: third-party Launch Agents, kernel extensions, etc. You can then easily identify anything that needs either removing or updating.\nAt worst, I would erase the disk, install the OS, and then migrate or restore apps, data and settings from your wife's backup.

I'm not a habitual Mac user.  I wanted to get a breakdown of disk usage on a Mac, so having installed ncdu via homebrew ages ago, I did sudo ncdu -x /.  Realising it would take forever, I installed duc with brew install duc, set it to profile with sudo duc index -xpH /.

I killed the process and switched off WiFi, in case it had mounted the network drive, and tried again: same problem.  I gave up and went back to ncdu: same problem.  I accepted defeat and installed some graphical app which seems to do the job.\nQuestion: where is all this data coming from?  I'm familiar with hardlinks being double counted, but both duc and ncdu can correct for that.  I've never seen behaviour like this on any Linux system; clearly, the Mac filesystem model is very different.  What's going on?\n(I realise that part of what's going on is my naively trying to use Linux tools on a Mac.  I've corrected that.  But I want to know what's happening at the filesystem level because I've never seen this scale of a problem before: if you forget to exclude special paths in Linux you might get a few MB of nonsense (although most just fail); hardlinks can give you more than you wanted, but not by that order of magnitude.  Clearly, macOS exposes a very different underlying model.)\n\nA: What’s going in in a nutshell is “crawling the filesystem type tools” need to be updated for APFS in general and snapshots, firm links specifically. Once that’s done, you’ll have a happier experience.\nI would use those inside a user home folder and use a tool like Daisy Disk or the Apple disk space tools to locate files and allocations you don’t expect on a “system” basis.\nOr you can dig into the APFS volume groups and learn when and where filesytem crawling tools can get caught in loops or dead ends or “worm holes” to other file systems (including user created loops and synthetic firmlinks).\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2021/01/13/big-sur-boot-volume-layout/\n", "Q: MacBook Early 2015 suddenly doesn't startup anymore MacBook Early 2015 suddenly doesn't startup anymore and hangs on loading screen.\nI used Diagnostics using D on startup, no problems.\ntried everything i know Nvram reset and SMC reset.\ntried booting to savemode, worked only one time and freezes almost immediately.\nin verbose mode i got this result...\nPlease help.\n\n\nA: After doing an initial triage with you in comments, we were able to determine that the proximal cause of the hang is a kernel panic. I reviewed the video that I asked you to take of the boot process. Because the video is neither high-speed/slow-motion nor high resolution, I was not able to read the panic text clearly. However, from prior experience I can tell what the approximate panic message is from this screencap:\n\nThis is not just a regular kernel panic but in fact is specifically an Intel Machine Check Exception (MCE). It's a low-level fault that was detected by the CPU itself, rather than macOS. This particular exception appears to occur on CPUs 2 and 3 and in both CPUs it's associated with the silicon subsystems belonging to MCA bank 4. Bank 4 is an uncore (i.e., global, not core-local) bank whose exact subsystems would be specified by the family-specific reference manual. Unfortunately I'm not able to read the MCA STATUS or ADDR register values, nor even the CPU family ID, so I can't hazard a further guess on what may be the underlying cause.\nEven so, the fact that this started occurring suddenly, without you changing anything on either the software side nor the hardware side, and is 100% reproducible, indicates to me that you're looking at a sudden hardware failure. On a 7 year old machine, this wouldn't be a shocking discovery.\nYou're welcome to try getting higher resolution and higher FPS videos and I'll review your logs again to try to determine more precisely from the MCA bank registers where in hardware the error might be originating, but my prediction is that you are looking at something that can't be fixed in software.\nYour best bet is to take the machine to an Apple-authorized repair center.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro dims display to 50% when charging cable is removed When I remove the charging cable, the brightness of the screen is reduced to 50% from 100%. If I plug the cable back in, then it goes up to about 75%.

I have the following configuration:\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Battery > \"Slightly dim the display while on battery power\" is off.\n\n*System Preferences > Battery > \"Turn display off after\" is set to never.\n\n*System Preferences > Displays > \"Automatically adjust brightness\" is off.\n\n \nmacOS Monterey 12.3 (21E230).\n\nA: I just discovered what the problem was: low power mode.\n\nIf System Preferences > Battery > \"Low power mode\" is enabled, then the screen dims when you remove the charging cable, regardless of all the other settings saying that the screen must not be automatically dimmed.\nThis also happens when you click \"low power mode\" to enable it, so it looks like this is a low power mode feature: as soon as low power mode is activated (in this case, when switching to battery power), the screen gets dimmed to 50%.\nThere doesn't seem to be any way to keep low power mode enabled and also prevent automatic dimming. Turning low power mode off solves the issue.\n", "Q: “No room for PMBR” when trying to rebuild tables My laptop messed up it’s macOS partition format when it tried to upgrade to Monterey yesterday.

Is there a secure method to block ads within Safari? In order to block ads, most ad blockers require that they can see and change your encrypted traffic. This means that they would be able to see things like bank passwords transfer in clear text. My understanding is that on mobile Safari, ad blockers are not allowed to connect to the internet and simply block certain connections. Is there something similar on Safari for Mac where there is no way you could read and record private traffic?\n\nA: Safari’s content blocking functionality provides an API for third-party apps to provide block lists.\n\nApps tell Safari in advance what kinds of content to block. Because Safari doesn't have to consult with the app during loading, and because Xcode compiles content blockers into bytecode, this model runs efficiently. Additionally, content blockers have no knowledge of users' history or the websites they visit.\n\nMy favourite app that implements content blockers is AdGuard for Safari as it is open source, lightweight and very effective in blocking with easy customisation to add your own rules (no affiliation).\n", "Q: Kunta@icloud.com My sister was updating my phone and it when to activation lock and tried to remove it but I could not and I have forgotten my iCloud\nI am only having the password\nSo am looking forward for you to help me\n\nA: According to Activation Lock for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, \"Your Apple ID password or device passcode is required before anyone can turn off Find My, erase your device, or reactivate and use your device.\"  I read this to mean that if you have the iCloud account credentials OR you have the phone PIN code you should be able to unlock the Activation Lock mode.\n", "Q: Installing Homebrew fails with \"The unauthenticated git protocol on port 9418 is no longer supported\" I am trying to install homebrew to my mac with\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nbut, I keep getting this\namaku@Davids-MacBook-Pro ~ % /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n==> Checking for `sudo` access (which may request your password)...\nPassword:\n==> This script will install:\n/opt/homebrew/bin/brew\n/opt/homebrew/share/doc/homebrew\n/opt/homebrew/share/man/man1/brew.1\n/opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew\n/opt/homebrew/etc/bash_completion.d/brew\n/opt/homebrew\n\nPress RETURN to continue or any other key to abort:\n==> /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/chown -R amaku:admin /opt/homebrew\n==> Downloading and installing Homebrew...\nfatal: remote error: \n  The unauthenticated git protocol on port 9418 is no longer supported.\nPlease see https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/ for more information.\nFailed during: git fetch --force origin\n\nHow can I fix this running macOS Monterey 12.3?\n\nA: I found the answer in https://github.com/Homebrew/discussions/discussions/2899.\nI ran git config --global --edit then I deleted everything (there were a lot of instead of declarations) and saved the file.\nThen I did the homebrew installation and it has installed fine!\n", "Q: Universal Control: How to use keyboard to switch applications across devices? Cmd+Tab works on a per-device basis rather than to re-select the previously active app.\nFor example, I have Slack open and being used on the iPad, and move the cursor over to the Mac via UC.

I have a Bourne script that takes a Python command (Python interpreter and arguments) and reroutes it to a custom Python interpreter. I want to make sure that modules that would be on the path of the original interpreter are put on the path of the custom interpreter. Customers have indicated that they are unwilling to abandon Python 2, so if possible, I want to continue to support it.\nThe path to the interpreter that is passed to the script may be either a genuine path or as a symlink. I want to determine the path to the associated lib/site-packages directory so that I can put it on the Python path (via PYTHONPATH). I have written code that uses readlink (without option flags) to recursively follow symlinks until it encounters a genuine (executable) file. It works fine when I pass \"python3\" to the script. However, when I pass in \"python\" (which points to Python 2 on my system), the resolution goes beyond /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7 to /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/pythonwrapper.app/Contents/MacOS/pythonwrapper.

Upgraded to mojave (zsh) and now it won't work anymore (return no matches found). How could I do this?\n\nA: You need to quote or escape the \"include\" pattern *.xmp to keep the shell from trying to expand it into a list of files in the current directory. You want the shell to just pass it to zip so that the zip program can use it as a pattern to match files in the current directory and subdirectories. Any of these will work:\nzip -r xmp.zip . -i \\*.xmp\nzip -r xmp.zip . -i \"*.xmp\"\nzip -r xmp.zip . -i '*.xmp'\n\nThis is described in the zip man page:\n\n-i files\n--include files\nInclude only the specified files, as in:\n                zip -r foo . -i \\*.c  \n\n[...] The backslash avoids the shell filename substitution,  so  that  the  name  matching  is performed by zip at all directory levels. [...]\n\nThis will not have caused an error under bash, because bash just leaves wildcard patterns alone if they don't match any files; zsh, on the other hand, treats this as an error.\nNote that you really should have been quoting or escaping the pattern under bash as well.

However a few times I've been woken at odd hours in the early morning by the \"Time to stand!\" message.\nIt's not a big deal and I easily fall asleep or decide to stay awake if it's close enough to 06:00 the time I've set as my goal, but I'm still curious if there's some adjustment to the software's settings or things in my behavior or environment that can be adjusted to reduce this.\nI'm assuming that if the software is telling me to stand, it means that it calculates that I'm awake when I'm actually sleeping. Certainly there will always be some noise in this calculation, but perhaps I can change something to reduce this noise?\nQuestion: What (if anything) can I do to stop my Apple Watch from waking me up to say \"Time to stand!\"?\nOn my watch under >Focus I see both >Do Not Disturb and >Sleep options, which I think means that I can prevent the phone from issuing the messages during certain times, but I'm wondering if there are other ways I can prevent this, perhaps by enhancing the watch's ability to know when I may be asleep in the first place.\nI keep my watch and phone linked via Bluetooth most of the time, so if there were for example some way that my phone's light sensor (that it uses for screen brightness) could tell my watch \"Shhh... sleeping\" via Bluetooth that would work nicely in my case.\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone SE II (v15.3.1)\n\n*Apple Watch S7 (v8.1)\n\n1from the link:\n\nPeople with insomnia should evaluate or have their sleep patterns evaluated and take into account all possible factors that may be affecting the person's ability to sleep.

I'm trying to shrink my MacOS (Monterey) partition using Disk Utility to reclaim some space for my Bootcamp partition using Minitool Partition Wizard on the Windows side. I succeeded in shrinking the MacOS partition by 35 GB with Disk Utility, but it forced me to create a new partition in the empty space, so now I have a new 35 GB ExFAT partition.\nI just can't figure out how to delete this partition; everything I've read just says to click the minus button in Disk Utility, and while that does remove the partition, it makes me dedicate those 35 GB to another existing partition with no option to leave the space unallocated. Some things I read, like this answer, say clicking the minus should leave a \"blank hole\" where the partition was, but in my experience Disk Utility always automatically adds the 35 GB back to my MacOS partition without asking.\nI could delete the partition from the Windows side, but for some reason MiniTool only sees it as being 32 GB, and I want to dedicate all 35 GB to the Bootcamp partition. So, is it possible to delete the ExFAT partition from the MacOS side and leave 35 GB unallocated so that I can boot into Windows and reclaim that space for the BootCamp partition?\n\n\nA: \nNote: The answer below applies to Macs which UEFI boot Windows. If you have an older Mac which legacy BIOS boots Windows, then you should should not use the answer below.\n\nYou can open a Terminal application window and enter the command given below. This command will convert the BRIDGE volume to free space.\ndiskutil erasevolume free none BRIDGE\n\nTo add the free space to Windows, you will have to move the partition containing the BOOTCAMP volume to so the free space will reside after this partition. This can be can be done with the MiniTool Partition Wizard. I would recommend moving the partition containing Windows without resizing. You can also use the GNOME Partition Editor (GParted) to move a partition. For a comparison of these tools, see this answer.\n\nNote: Before attempting to move the Windows partition, the Windows chkdsk command should be applied to the NTFS volume in this partition. This can be accomplish by booting to Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE) and entering the command below.\n\nchkdsk c: /f\n\nAfter moving the partition, you can use the Disk Management application provided by Microsoft to extend the BOOTCAMP volume to include the free space.\n", "Q: How to display image from MacBook Pro to iMac in full screen? I have a MacBook Pro 14 and iMac 24.\nI use sharing settings on MacBook and sharing screen.\nAfter I connect devices with a thunderbolt cable, I connect from Finder on the iMac to the MacBook and see the display.\nBut, I see display only in the MacBook's resolution with black borders around it.\nHow do I fix it?\n\nA: You are seeing black boarders because the MacBook display resolution is lower than the iMac display resolution.\nYou can set the iMac's display to a lower resolution. This will make the window containing the MacBook display appear larger, but does not change the resolution of MacBook display shown in the window on the iMac. Turning scaling on or off has no effect.\nIf the MacBook display resolution can be set higher than the iMac display resolution and scaling is turn on, then the MacBook display can appear on the iMac at a lower resolution than current set on the MacBook.\n\nYou can also choose to use any available VNC viewer. I tried Chicken and found this also did not allow scaling when the MacBook display is set at a lower resolution than the iMac display. However, I did find that RealVNC VNC viewer does allow full screen mode with scaling to remove the black boarders. Both Chicken and RealVNC VNC Viewer are free applications.\n\nNote: This answer was tested using a 21.5\" 2011 iMac and 21.5\" 2013 iMac connected by Thunderbolt.

You can pay an Apple authorized service center to do this for a nominal fee, or you can attempt to do it yourself by investing in a \"pizza cutter\" tool and being EXTREMELY careful not to touch the power supply board (which has large capacitors that were recently charged [because you tried powering the system on] and WILL kill you).

I am puzzled why is that? Under scaled I can see the 3840x2160 option.\nI am running Big Sur on Intel based Mac with Radeon GPU in it.\n\nA: The default is a factor of exactly 2 (2160/1080 = 2).  This is the scaling which makes for the most crisp looking text. So that is the default.\nYou can, of course, choose something else. If I were to use 3840x2160 on a 27\" screen, I would find text looking too small - but if you like it, go for it.\nMy preference on a 27\" screen would be for looks like 2560x1440.\nFor more detailed answers, read What are the effective scaling modes on OSX with a 4K display? Is an effective real estate of 2560x1440 possible? and some of the others in the 'Related' list on the right.\n\nA: MacOS IS using the display's full resolution; but objects are scaled to twice the size so it doesn't look tiny.\nThe 'concept' of it being a 1920 x 1080 display is an abstraction.\nThe 2x2 pixel block that represents one pixel at the scaled size will almost always have different values in each of the four pixels.

I already tried to add Port: 993 later imap.mail.me.com but it gives me the same error!\nHow and can I resolve that problem?\nI hide the mail for privacy question.\n\n\nA: You may need to get as much info into that setup panel as possible & see if you can get past it to the next step, where it actually creates an account & inbox in the Mail app.\nApple states that Mail is only supported from OS X 10.7.5 & up.\nThis may be because any older OS will not support the versions of SSL or TLS needed.\nI can't check back that far. Modern macOS iCloud setuip is almost seamless & there are no user-adjustable settings any more.\nGoing back as far as El Capitan, the settings were more visible, so I've grabbed some screenshots to see if you can match these settings yourself. The accounts are all set to inactive on this Mac, so areas are greyed out that won't be for you.\nOnce you've managed to get past that setup page [it is possible even if it won't connect, but it's been so long I cannot remember precisely how you do it], it will then let you add more information manually. First open Mail preferences. Select Accounts then the specific iCloud account. You should hopefully see something similar to this…\n\nThis should essentially be the same info as you set initially [ignore that the IMAP address has a 'p37' prefix for now [that comes later, if at all].\nClick Outgoing Mail Server, then Edit SMTP list…\n\nAccount info & Advanced need completing…\n\n\nHere you set port 587, Use SSL & either Apple Token, or if that doesn't work, Password & add a password below & OK to close it.\nClick the Advanced tab back in the main panel. The important part is highlighted in red. Enter port 993, SSL & again, if Apple Token doesn't work, you may be able to use Password instead [I cannot test that]\n\nIf you get anywhere near being able to complete those forms & it still doesn't work it might be an SSL issue. Apple recommends switching to TLS if SSL doesn't work, but I'm almost certain OS X 10.2 will not support TLS 1.2, which is the minimum requirement for any secure TLS connection these days.\nI wish you luck, if you can get this far.

There are pros and cons to both approaches, but relevant here is that it is decided by the implementation of the editor in question (Xcode in your case) and can't be easily changed.\nDepending on what you want to accomplish you could use symbolic links instead.\n\nA: Xcode always writes to a new file, then when the new file is written it renames the old file, renames the new file, then unlinks the old file. That way, if your computer loses power at any point during saving, all your files are intact. The \"other\" hard link will be unmodified and point to the file whose inode was just unlinked by Xcode. Nothing you can do about that.\nSymbolic links work differently.\n", "Q: What is the equivalent of Shift-Command-4 for video recording?

The end result was purchasing a 1TB external drive and making that the boot volume for the computer (a significant increase from the 500GB internal that had been used).\nAs it is, I'm primarily using this computer because MY iMac died and, being a late 2008 model with a dead graphics card, I can't justify putting repair money into it.  I've been using a 2012 Mac Mini and copying any immediately needed files over from my Time Machine backup.  However, because of the space limitation, and because of uncertainties with how Time Machine works, I've hesitated integrating myself completely into the Mini - specifically, I have not reestabliehed my iTunes library or set up my e-mail.  (I've been manually accessing the Linux server I POP from and leaving anything there I want to keep so I can import it to wherever I establish my \"new desktop\", which now seems to be here.)\nEnough time has passed, I don't expect to have a new desktop anytime soon due to finances, so I've decided that since there's now enough space on the Mini, I want to reestablish my home account there.  However, I've also been using the Mini for about 2 years and have an established workspace on here as well.  My old computer was also used by the family.  I have accounts for the wife and three children contained in the backup.  None of the kids use this computer any more, and the wife barely does, but I don't want to just ditch all of their stuff before they have a chance to look through it.  However, three of these individuals have accounts on the current desktop.  I don't know whether I can just copy old (iMac) accounts INTO the current (Mini) accounts without decimating preference files and such, or if I should literally restore accounts from the Time Machine as new users (and if so, do I need to create the accounts, or is that part of the Restore procedure?).\nIf it matters at all, my iMac used High Sierra; the Mini is currently running Catalina (though I have a Mojave partition).  I'm well aware some of my software will no longer run.\n\nA: You can import a lot of things manually by opening your old Time Machine volume (option-click Time Machine icon and select “browse other Time Machine disks” then select your backup). After authenticating you should be able to view the backup and copy any files or data into your account or a new account set up just for import purposes. Make sure you include files in your Library if you want settings from specific programs (usually Application Support subfolder is all that you’ll need, but check other locations just in case something doesn’t work as expected after import). Apps that you might import should work provided you are using the same AppleID for App Store items, or have the registration info for non-App Store programs that require it.\nBest thing about this, especially if you are pulling the data into a clean profile, is that you are not risking overwriting anything in your existing profiles, and you are always able to go back to the original files from your iMac if something didn’t transfer correctly.\nI did this when setting up a new Macbook for my son. We have a parent account on the computer to administer it, TimeMachine backup was from an older system with a much larger hard drive. I was able to import his profile but not the parent profile due to disk space. I created a profile on the new computer and just manually imported the files and settings I wanted to keep from the backup.\n", "Q: I believe I am unable to configure MacBook Pro 2015 model to standby immediately, does anyone have the magic incantations (pmset)? I have an early 2015 model MacBook Pro and I notice that if I charge the battery to 100%, disconnect the power adapter and then close the lid, overnight it will use some of the battery, as though the unit is sleeping and not in standby.\nI would very much like the MacBook to immediately dump memory to disk and turn itself completely off, whenever I close the lid.\nI have tinkered with the pmset commands earlier, before Big Sur was released but I believe the addition of the \"autopoweroff\" setting has muddled the waters, and my tinkering + the changes introduced may have generated a configuration that isn't correct.\nThis is the output of pmset -g on my MacBook right now:\nSystem-wide power settings:\nCurrently in use:\n lidwake              1\n autopoweroff         1\n standbydelayhigh     86400\n autopoweroffdelay    28800\n proximitywake        0\n standby              1\n standbydelaylow      10800\n ttyskeepawake        1\n highstandbythreshold 50\n powernap             0\n gpuswitch            2\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n hibernatemode        25\n displaysleep         2\n sleep                10\n tcpkeepalive         1\n halfdim              1\n acwake               0\n disksleep            10\n\nI have two questions:\n\n*\n\n*How can I verify that standby is properly configured?\nI read on one page that if I close the lid, let it standby, and then open the lid and turn it on I should have a progress bar. If I do, it was in standby mode. This progress bar does not appear.\n\n\n*If the above configuration is not correct for my goal, which is \"dump memory to disk and turn off power immediately when I close the lid\", does anyone know the correct pmset configuration I would need?\nNote that this progress bar does not appear even overnight, which leads me to believe the MacBook isn't actually going to standby at all, instead just going to sleep mode and sitting there until battery drains out.\n\nA: The man page for pmset provides all the relevant information. Notably:\nhibernatemode supports values of 0, 3, or 25. Whether or not a hibernation image gets written is also dependent on\n     the values of standby and autopoweroff\n\nhibernatemode = 25 is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the\n     disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want \"hibernation\" - slower\n     sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting.\n\nAlso note from the man page that standbydelayhigh and standbydelaylow  specify the delay, in seconds, before writing the hibernation image to disk and powering off memory for Standby. Your values are 24 and 3 hours respectively.\nautopoweroffdelay is also a large value, in seconds.\nHowever, it's possible that an active process could be preventing sleep. For instance, here's the relevant output of pmset -g in my case:\n sleep                1 (sleep prevented by backupd-helper, sharingd, backupd, coreaudiod)\n\n.\nIt's also possible that an old battery, reaching the end of its life, may not be reporting reliably, or not able to manage power optimally.\n", "Q: In List view, can the Files prog on iOS 15.2 list files without showing icons and without showing dates and sizes on the same line as each file name? When I run the Files program on iOS 15.2 and choose \"List view\", it lists files with each file name having a small icon to the left of it and with the date and file size shown below it. There are also horizontal lines separating each file's entry from the next file's. This allows 11 files to be shown at a time on the screen of my iPhone XR without scrolling being necessary.\nIf no icons were shown, and the dates and file sizes were shown either on the same line as the file names or not at all, then the number of files that could be listed without scrolling being necessary would be much larger, perhaps as great as 20.\nCan this be done?\n\nA: I asked the same question of myself a few weeks ago and could not find any settings that customized this view at all. We get what we see: no less; no more.\nYou can always submit Feedback to Apple and describe your design enhancements in the comments field.\n", "Q: How to get text selection work in the .pdf viewer in Safari? UPDATED QUESTION\nAfter many users giving greatly valuable input, we verified that the below-described behavior is a result of a bug.\nUsing Safari up to version 15.4 (17613.1.17.1.13) will crash the text selection feature for .pdf's viewed in the browser once in-text search by command+F was initiated or once a character was entered into the search box thereof.\nThe behavior does not appear to affect all the pages, in fact, it seems the first or the first and second page remain unaffected; however, pages thereafter will not allow character-level, and multi-word text selection. What it means is once you want to select text it will select the first word that you begin selecting then it won't allow continuous selection of additional words, or characters of words or specific letters within that word — other than on page 1 or 2. It will simply select the single word wherever you begin text selection.\nThe question, therefore, is until a bug fix comes out: Is there any, for e.g., Hammerspoon scripts that could tie a \"restart-pdf-viewer-in-Safari\" command to every even calling of the in-text search feature? For e.g., such a restart command to every even command + F pressed while in Safari would already be terrific.\nAlternatively, another command could call such a command resulting in the restarting of the in-Safari .pdf viewer.\nPRE-UPDATE QUESTION\nFor a little while now (basically after upgrading to Mac Monterey from Big Sur) and/or when I upgraded my Safari (now at 15.4), my computer (MacBook Air M1, 8 GB, 512) refuses to select text while viewing .pdf documents in the browser.\n\n*\n\n*https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00462.pdf\nIt is still able to search within the document, and the highlighted word, of course, is selected, and may be copied from the text, but simply hovering over the pressed cursor to select text does nothing in any .pdf's only, and I view dozens of them a day. (No, it's not because they are locked.)\nOnce I download them, of course, they work just fine, and I can select text. But I don't always (or often even) want to download documents.\nIs there a setting that messed this up after one or both of the above upgrades?\n\nA: For information, this is sharing my workaround. It is not an \"answer\" and don't expect it to be accepted. Just hope it is not downvoted.\nFor Safari 15.4 (and probably other versions) searching in a PDF and selecting text does not work as expected. I suggest a workaround where the PDF is opened in Preview without an overt download step.\nWorkaround (2 steps):\n\n*\n\n*Choose File > Print... menu action (Command-P).\n\n*In the \"PDF\" dropdown, choose Open in Preview.\n\nNow searching and selecting works correctly.\nI have not used Hammerspoon (as suggested by @Kortelly), but my workaround can be created as a simple macro in Keyboard Maestro from Stairways Software.\n\nAs you can deduce this macro can be executed with a chosen hot key or a click on KM's macro palette.\n[I can't remember, but I am pretty sure this was something copied from the KM forums/examples and modified a bit by me.]\n", "Q: iTunes has reset my phone instead even though I chose update - is all data lost?

This is how we all learn, by losing data or helping someone we know who lost data.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977\nThe upgrade process doesn’t set out to delete data and has many checks in place to make sure there’s enough room to always preserve contents, but not all processes, instructions or warnings work all the time for everyone.

Linux has a kernel argument memtest:\n\nSpecifies the number of memtest passes to be performed. Each pass selects another test pattern from a given set of patterns. Memtest fills the memory with this pattern, validate memory contents and reserves bad memory regions that are detected.\n\nBy reserving the memory what it means is that kernel makes it unavailable for userland allocation. This means you can run programs without having to worry about them writing to a defective sector of ram. You use memtest by providing the Linux kernel an argument to boot,\nmemtest=        [KNL,X86,ARM,PPC] Enable memtest\n                Format: <integer>\n                default : 0 <disable>\n\nThis is not a default. It takes 5-10 minutes to run through the 17 passes (current default). How can I do this on OS10?\n\nNote: I can not replace the RAM. It's BGA soldered on.\n\nA: There is no macOS equivalent of the Linux kernel argument memtest.\nYou could perhaps make do with the macOS kernel argument named maxmem. If you set the boot-args to include for example maxmem=1024 this means that the system will only use the first gigabyte of memory. Ofcourse this is only practical if your RAM problem is located at the top end of memory addresses.\nAnother option is to make a memtest equivalent yourself. This is ofcourse only possible if you are a programmer yourself. You can download the macOS kernel source code and make this change to create your own kernel. It comes with a lot of practical downsides, but if it is just for recovering data from the system it might be good enough.\nFinally, you could make a user-space version of memtest. If the system actually boots, you could make launchd start your own program early in the boot (delaying the rest of the boot), and that program would scan the memory for broken bits and allocating them as pinned allocations (i.e. ensure that it is not swapped out, compressed, or any other type of page table shenanigans is going on). This would ensure that other programs do not get those parts of memory allocated.\n", "Q: How can I merge the free space with Apple_APFS Container disk3 I searched before posting this and did find a couple of similar questions.

Also the \"SCSI Logical Unit Bytes\" = <0001000000000000> you posted in the gist looks suspicious.\nSome drives support encryption and disable access until unlocked. If you have enabled encryption earlier, you will need to unlock it first (or disable the encryption). But in my experience (other manufacturers like WD or Samsung, not SanDisk*), the \"SED\" encrypted drives still report the correct capacity (only all read/write attempts fail when locked), or show up as a small partition, which sometimes appears as a virtual CD drive, with tools to unlock it...

One of them is \"matches\", and the other is \"contains\", but aside from establishing that they are indeed different I am unclear on what exactly either of them mean (contains go matches a file name libpng.o for example, which I also find confusing).\n\n\nA: I have found that an easy way to decipher exactly what Finder means by a query is to save it as a saved search and then inspect that file with a text editor. So in your case open up Finder and make a search for matches 'go' and save that as a saved search, and do the same for contains 'go'.\nIf you do that, you'll see that matches 'go' produces this search pattern:\n(kMDItemDisplayName = \"go*\"cdw)\n\nwhereas contains 'go' produces this search pattern:\n(kMDItemDisplayName = \"*go*\"cd)\n\nkMDItemDisplayName means that you're trying to match something to the displayed name of the file.\nEach of the letters in cd and cdw are so called value comparison modifiers:\n\n*\n\n*The letter c means that the comparison is made case-insensitive (i.e. A and a are considered the same).\n\n*The letter d means that the comparison is insensitive to diacritical marks (i.e.è and e are considered the same).\n\n*The letter w means that the comparison is word-based, and that the comparison detects transitions from lower-case to upper-case.\n\nYou can find the documentation of the value comparison modifiers in Apple's documentation.\nSo in your scenario matches 'go' means that it will search for files where the name has a word inside it that starts with the string go (i.e. there could be any suffix to the string in the word) - ignoring case and various marks.\nSimilarly, contains 'go' means that it will search for files where the name has the string go somewhere inside it (i.e. there could any prefix or suffix to the string) - ignoring case and various marks.\n\nA: matches is the exact meaning, so if only one char (even hidden ones) is invisible, it will not match.\ncontains is more flexible, and will match also substrings\n", "Q: Delete Files with Apple Script My photo camera allows to save pictures in RAW and JPG in parallel.

I have created a front-end tool for work using only HTML, CSS and Js.\nI'm trying to have my coworkers simply open the html file in their own browsers, but the browser gives an error that requires Safari to gain Full Disk Access.\nThe error is : \nThe known fix for this error page is by allowing Safari to have Full Disk Access.\nHowever, my concern is : What are the potential dangers of allowing Safari to have Full Disk Access? If there are sensitive data on my computer, would it be wise to allow Full Disk Access to Safari?\n\nA: The potential dangers of allowing Safari to have Full Disk Access is that if the browser is somehow compromised by malware then it could more easily access your documents. Is that dangerous? - It really depends on your specific situation, your threat model, your risk assessment and how you value the data on your system.\nRemember that just 5 years ago, everyone was basically running Safari with \"Full Disk Access\" enabled - as macOS did not have that sandboxing feature at the time. So it's not catastrophically dangerous for most.\nIf I were in your shoes I would reevaluate whether this is really the \"known fix\" for your issue. An easy way around all of this would be to ask your coworkers to copy your tool to the Applications folder on their Mac. It's basically an application, so why not put it there. That should avoid the issue with Safari.\nAnother fix would be to host the tool on a web server (or CDN).\n", "Q: Can't understand this apple documentation: Handling NotNow Status Responses on iOS I'm looking at Apple's documentation for managing an organization's devices remotely. On the page that addresses \"NotNow\" responses, it says\n\nAvoid receiving a NotNow status response on iOS devices by executing any of the following commands:\n\nThis looks pretty strange to me, and I wonder if I'm not interpreting it correctly. Does it mean that any of the listed commands can be sent without risk of a 'NotNow' response? (I don't think so because my server is sending 'CertificateList', which is one of the commands in question, and it's getting a 'NotNow' response. And that's what led me to this documentation in the first place.)\nWhat is the page trying to say? And why does it address macOS in a manner so different from the way it addresses iOS? (For the former, it describes what conditions can cause a 'NotNow' response; for the latter, it just gives a list of commands which will supposedly prevent 'NotNow' responses.)\n\nA: Yes, it means that any of the listed commands can be sent without the risk of a NotNow response. Essentially, on iOS lots of commands cannot be processed when the device is locked after a boot - you'll get a NotNow response if you try. However, those commands in that list will not give you a NotNow response.\nYour question about why Apple has chosen to describe macOS in a different way than iOS in the documentation is guess work and cannot be answered by anyone but the person writing the documentation. Essentially they describe the situations where a command could give a NotNow in macOS, and on iOS they list commands that cannot give a NotNow. It's just a choice in writing.\n", "Q: How do I subscribe to a postcast by its URL iPhone Podcasts app? I have a podcast RSS URL (copied in the clipboard) that I want to listen to in the Apple Podcasts app. On the \"Listen Now\" screen there's a link for \"Add a show by URL\" but when I tap it, nothing happens. I can't see another option to add a Podcast URL.\nBrand new iPhone 12 on iOS on iOS 15.1.\n\nA: It looks like this was a bug in the Podcasts app. An upgrade to iOS 15.4 fixed it.\n", "Q: Is it a security hole to get Safari Apple ID Two-Factor Authentication codes on the same Mac? If I am not misinformed, the idea of two-factor authentication is that if an attacker somehow gets my Apple ID and password, they have an additional hurdle to overcome.\nBut it seems to me that this is NOT an obstacle given the behavior shown here:\n\nAll I have to do (when it's really me) is drag the pop-up out of the way and copy the number directly.  A minor inconvenience, but (so it seems) doesn't keep the intruder out.\nOf course, they have to also have one of my devices, but one iPhone disappeared in restaurant in Indiana, another in a subway in Barcelona, and an iPad in Oklahoma (and the same iPad was out of my reach on a train for a night¹).\nHowever, maybe I'm missing something, because Apple seems unconcerned—I reported this as a bug more than sixteen months ago, and there has been no response.\nSo, am I missing something?\n¹When traveling by train in Spain, never take more objects than you can carry.  The train will leave while you are setting down the first load on the platform.\n\nA: No, that's not a \"hole\" in security - this is definitely by design.\nThe idea behind 2-factor authentication is that a user is required to present 2 separate and different factors of authentication. These factors can be many things, but in Apple's system they are a password (something you know) and a token (something you have) stored on your computer.\nThis improves security when compared with just authenticating using a single factor, username and password, as was common not so many years ago:\nIf someone compromises your password and tries to login to your iCloud account from their own computer, they will not be able to login as they cannot produce the 6 digit verification code.\nSimilarly if someone compromises your authentication token (for example by extracting it from a stolen backup drive) and tries to login to your iCloud account from their own computer, they will not be able to login as they cannot enter the correct account password.\nFinally, if someone has physical possession of both one of your trusted devices as well as knowing your iCloud password, they still have one barrier left to pass. For example stealing your iPhone or iPad won't automatically give the thief access to your verification codes - they aren't displayed unless the device is unlocked (using for example TouchID/FaceID or a passcode).\nShould someone know your iCloud password, have your device in their possession - and be able to unlock it - then you're out of luck. This is to be expected and is by design.\nIt is always a good idea to follow simple practices such as:\n\n*\n\n*Do not reuse passwords amongst multiple services\n\n*Do not use the same password for your iCloud account as for your Mac user account or iOS device passcode\n\n*Use a strong passphrase for your Mac user account - especially if you have your iCloud account password stored in a Keychain in your Mac\n\n*Enable Find My on compatible devices and ensure that you mark them as missing/stolen as soon as you know that has happened\n\n*Always keep devices updated with security-related software upgrades\n\nIn addition to these practices, it is worth knowing that modern devices usually have the best security. I.e. an 2021 Apple Silicon MacBook Pro will have better security than a 2012 Intel MacBook Pro. Similarly an iPhone 13 Pro will have better security than an iPhone 5S.\n", "Q: Can macOS Monterey's video effects (e.g. portrait) be used using an external webcam? With Apple Silicon and macOS Monterey we can, on an app-by-app basis, activate video effects in apps that use the webcam. E.g. on my MBP M1, I can blur my background when in a Google Meet by clicking Control Center » Video Effects » Portrait under Google Chrome.\nCan I use the Video Effects feature through an external webcam on my M1 Mac?\n\nA: Yes, these features do not need any special hardware and are implemented per app. Therefore any camera that is being detected as such by macOS will be able to use these features.\nE.g. I am sometimes using my Sony camera connected to my Mac via cable in zoom. All the features, like blurring a background or the bluescreen functionality are still available and work as expected.\n\nNote that the head-tracking/focusing feature introduced in the newer iPads and the new Studio display only work with the \"internal\" camera.\n", "Q: Screwed up my disk messing with diskutil. Can't re-partition I was messing with diskutil and ended up \"configuring\" my disk to where it will not repartition properly.

If additional information is needed please let me know!\nI do not care about any data on the disk itself.\n\nI am going to rewrite a post with much more detail into the methods that I have tried.\n\nA: I wasn't able to figure out why process '0' wouldn't allow me to erase/unmount my disk. However, in order to fix my botched disk, I had to plug my Mac into another Mac with Apple Configurator installed.\nDoing this I was able to successfully wipe my own disk without any issues.\n", "Q: Can't enable FileVault with secure token I set up a new Mac Mini M1 (macOS 12.3 / build 21E230).

Your model Mac is suppose to have a Fusion drive arrangement, where there would be an APFS container consisting of an APFS partition from the internal HDD and an APFS partition from the internal SSD. Since the firmware can only find an APFS partition on the internal HDD, none of the APFS volumes can be mounted and thus macOS can not boot. If you have a backup on needed files, you would probably be better off reinstalling macOS and Windows.\nUpdate 2\nBefore attempting to reinstall  macOS, you will need to rebuild a Fusion container. Below are the commands to enter.\n\nNote: Before making the entries given below, you should first enter the command diskutil list internal, then check to see if disk0 and disk2 are still the identifiers of the same drives shown in your posted images.

This message appears above Gmail and iCloud Apple Mail messages. I don't use a VPN application. Apple explains that you can configure VPN Settings on macOS and iOS devices if you are enrolled in an MDM (Mobile Device Management) Solution. This is my iPhone and I have never installed an MDM solution or app.\n\nA: Try to check Settings > Mail > Privacy Protection.\n\"When fully enabled, Mail Privacy Protection hides your IP address and downloads remote content privately when you receive a message.\"\nhttps://www.makeuseof.com/mail-privacy-protection-explained-macos-ios/\n\nA: Mdm isn’t an app you would put on. It’s a policy your employer would likely put on. It can be part of Microsoft 365 /Azure or Google Workspace to name a couple. There are many companies that “manage” security on employee devices without your explicit permission. If you logged into a company account on your personal device your device can be MDM ‘d (Mobile Device Management). Mdm is used to manage devices so the company can control devices off of their property, remote usage. They use a vpn to make all communication (or the specific requested in setup of their policy) go through a manager and controlled vpn “tunnel” Go to settings-general-vpn/managed devices and go through headings. You should be able to reject device management from there. Also you will see if you are MDM’d with its accompanying vpn.  Be thankful it’s an apple because android doesn’t offer the mdm disable and you’re at the mercy of the policy holder ( again likely your employer). I went through this the hard way. This mdm/vpn policy can be highly intrusive on your device and your network. I have spent several years and many courses ( comp Tia plus and white hat hacking and am a Google admin) to fully understand the complexities of remote management and it’s abilities.\n", "Q: How can I export and important Notes stored on Gmail?

I ran out of space (500mb free now). I tried to empty the trash bin, but it says that is not possible because there is no memory O_o. Having heard that it can be done through terminal. I open the terminal and have a white window saying \"last login fri feb 11 18:22:42 on console        [process finished]\". When I start a new window it tells the same. When I make a new command, whatever I type it tells the same. Seen here a solution with '\\bin\\bash -x -it still tells the same.\nAbout half a year ago I had a problem also linked with no free memory, my mac refused working and a solution for this problem was using the terminal. But I couldn't use it because there was a similar problem with the terminal. I don't remember the details and how I solved this problem, but it was almost a miracle. After that I haven't used the terminal and now it behaves like that.\nWhat can I do in such situation?\n\nA: 500MB isn't enough free space on any drive.\nA rule of thumb is you need 10-15% free space on a partition - more if the drive is tiny.\nDo you have an external drive you can move data to?\nIf you hold Cmd as you drag to the external, the file will 'move' instead of copy, which is really a copy then delete - the resulting deletion will not go to trash, it will immediately create free space. Do this carefully, one large file at a time, just in case. Also make sure your backup is up to date.\n", "Q: Safari web inspector cannot be docked The web inspector somehow got detached from the main window.

My question being: Where is that low-res cached user picture located, how do I reach it, and would it be possible to replace it by a high-res image, and if so how?\n\nA: When you boot up your Mac, it starts from a non-encrypted part of the disk that only contains a very limited subset of macOS. Basically it can display that login screen and that's it. The pictures displayed are \"hardcoded\" into it - so it is not loading those account pictures like usual.\nAs soon as you have logged in, the ordinary disk can be unlocked (i.e. decrypted) - and then the full macOS system takes over - and now your account pictures are loaded from the file system like usual.\nIf there's a problem with the account picture during the first part of the boot, I would suggest simply trying to change the account picture. When you do that, the information in that non-encrypted part of the disk is updated. You can check by rebooting and seeing the new picture. Afterwards you can change it back to the original picture you want, and the login window information will be regenerated - this time hopefully without any flaws.\n", "Q: Finder Beachballs on Right Click - And other Symptoms Mac:\n2011 27\" iMac, 1 TB SSD, 32 GB of RAM, Mac OS 10.13.6\nSymptoms:\nAny time you right click on any file, the Finder beachballs for a long time.

System Update downloaded the installer and began the process of updating my system.\nAfter a reboot, the Mac rebooted with the big Apple on the screen with the progress bar underneath. I noticed that the progress bar was at the same point for over half an hour so I opted to reboot the Mac. Big Apple appears with progress bar and as before it stops at about 20% in.\nI reset the SMC, same as before. I booted into Recovery Mode and checked the disk for errors.

Booting into Internet Recovery Mode took about 30 mins.\nThe technician then instructed me to run Disk Utility, select the internal drive (this selects all the volumes), and click Erase at the top of the window. She recommended running First Aid after erasing to make sure there were no errors (there were none).\nNext, I was directed to quit Disk Utility and select Reinstall macOS Monterey. This would take a while but would download and install a fresh copy of macOS 12.3.\nAfter the install and reboots, I was greeted with the new OS and proceeded to answer the few questions then migrated my data from my backup drive.\nI received an email from Apple Support with the steps from the following links:\n\n*\n\n*How to reinstall macOS\n\n*Use Disk Utility to erase an Intel-based Mac\n", "Q: Xcode Error When Launching Terminal I'm getting the following errors when launching my terminal, seemingly out of nowhere.

I connect my old Thunderbolt Display with the Apple USB-C to Thunderbolt adapter. The display works fine, and I can connect devices to its ports which work great, but when the computer is connected, USB devices plugged into the display are not charged. I noticed this with my iPad Pro 11\", which refuses to charge from USB.\nThe strange thing is, that I know that TBD is able to charge my iPad, since it always worked with my previous Intel Mac (still works), and when the M1 MBP is not connected.\nIs there any workaround for this issue? Is this only my device or is this a bug?\nM1 MBP not connected:\n\nM1 MBP connected:\n\nUpdate: measurements\n\nA: [Not an answer, but I wanted to share more data and don't have the reputation to comment. Apologies.]\nI'm seeing exactly the same issues – all worked fine with my old Intel MacBook, but my M1 Pro seems to prevent the power negotiation step of the connection happening. Oddly I also see this with a USB light (only charges from the TB Display when the MBP isn't connected), but my audio interface and Android phones draw power fine from the USB-A connection. System Profiler suggests that the iPad requires & is receiving 500 mA, which is enough to charge it where the MBP isn't connected to the display. Directly connecting the iPad to the MBP via a USB-C to A adapter (with the same cable) works fine.\nOn the iPad specifically – I just updated to iOS 15.5, and interestingly following the update the iPad was charging fine. However, as soon as I pulled and re-plugged the connection to my Thunderbolt Display, it went back to 'Not charging'. Restarting the iPad while connected to the display doesn't give the same result.\nSetup: M1 Pro MBP 16\" > Apple USB-C to Thunderbolt adapter > 27\" Thunderbolt display > USB-A to C cable > iPad Air 4 (2020). All up to date at time of writing.\n\nA: It seems, that macOS Ventura 13.0.1 fixed the issue. iPad is charging fine for me now.\n\nA: I don’t have a solution but I can confirm the experience of the OP and others.  I don’t have the means to measure the output current from the TB Display USB ports so can only observe the effect on iPad charging.  Issue occurs across a range of iPad models (12.9” iPad Pro 2nd gen (2017), 12.9” iPad Pro 5th gen (M1), and iPad 6).  IPhone 13 Mini charges normally.  Portable USB drives connected to TB Display also function normally.\nIssue occurs only with M1 MacBook Pro (running Monterey) connected to TB Display.  Does not occur with Intel MBP 2012 running Big Sur nor with 2019 Intel MBP running Monterey.  Does not occur with no computer connected to TB Display.  Does not occur with iPad connected directly to M1 MBP (via USB-C to USB-A adapter and Lightning cable.\nSo it seems that M1 MBP <-> TB Display is necessary and sufficient to cause this issue.\nI submitted a bug report to Apple a few months ago and hoped in vain that a Monterey update would fix the issue.\nDoes anyone know if the issue has been fixed in Ventura?

There are also spaces in the Path, so separating results by spaces gives interesting results.\nSo far I've figured out how to do these things but not in tandem. This command will return all results, no dot underscore files, but it returns only the full path, can't get it to return basename:\nresults=\"$(find /Path/ -iname \"*.mov\" -type f | grep -vF '/._')\"\n\nAnd then this command will return only basenames, but includes dot-underscore files\nresults=\"$(find /Path/ -iname \"*.mov\" -execdir echo {} ';' | grep -vF '/._')\"\n\nAs you can see in the second attempt I tried to link the two together... but somehow -execdir is making the command ignore the grep command at the end. I'm sure I'm just piping something wrong, but please let me know.\n\nA: You can use find to skip unwanted files, no need to grepafterwards:\nfind PATH \\( -name '._*' -prune \\) -o -type f -iname '*.mov' -execdir echo {} \\;\n\nTo create a text file with the result, add > path/to/text-file at the end.\nPS: The reason your second command doesn't work is in the pattern used for grep. You strip out the path name in the find, so grep -v '^\\._' should be used instead.\n", "Q: clang showing incorrect target on M1 Mac When I run clang --version I get this result:\nApple clang version 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin21.4.0\nThread model: posix\nInstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin\n\nBut I'm currently running on an M1 mac, so this should be returning some sort of arm64.

So I have a very nice 27\" 5K iMac, late 2014 model.\nIt runs Big Sur, but it doesn't get the Monterey upgrade, because it is 1 generation too old.\nI believe I can get Monterey to work using OCLP on this hardware, but I rather don't want to mess with that as that would require a full re-install, for which I have no time. (A lot of home-brew/custom software that would need to be setup fresh.)\nSo I wonder if I can run Monterey in a VM instead, even though the underlying hardware is officially not supported.\n(I've got 24 GB RAM to play with. Plenty for a VM.)\nI can just give it a try off course, but Monterey is a big download and I have very limited bandwidth at the moment, that is also needed for other stuff during the day.\nI rather not download the whole thing over several nights to find that it doesn't work.\nCan anyone confirm whether this would work or not?\n\nA: I have macOS Monterey version 12.1 installed on a VMware Fusion Player virtual machine on a iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013) host. The iMac is running macOS Catalina version 10.15.7 from a 5 Gb/s USB port. The USB drive is a 500 GB Samsung T7 SSD. The VMware Fusion Player is the free for personal use version 12.1.2.\nI created a Monterey installer drive by using a Big Sur virtual machine. I following Apple's instructions: How to create a bootable installer for macOS. Instead of using a USB flash drive, I created and used a second SATA drive for the installer.\nThe virtual machine has 2 processor cores and 4096 MB of memory out of the 4 processor cores and 16 GB of memory installed in the iMac. This is a custom virtual machine where macOS 11.0 was selected as the operating system.\n\nA: Yes, that should be fully possible. Note that there will be some performance loss - depending a lot on what type of computing you want to do. For example it might not be a good experience for 3D gaming, but will probably work just fine for app development.\n\nA: Self answer as I now had the opportunity to try.\nI tried it on 2 different Macs (iMac late 2014 and a 2013 MacBook Pro) with Parallels, VMWare Fusion and VirtualBox with the same disappointing results.\nIt won't work properly. In all cases the installer or the first stage of the setup after the base install will throw a kernel-panic.\nIn Parallels and VirtualBox it would crash early after only 2 or 3 click-through screens in the beginning of the installation.\nVMWare Fusion at least got to the part when it starts copying files to the harddisk and in one case to the first screen after that, but eventually crashed as well.\nI tried each a coupl eof times. The exact moment of the crash varies a bit, but eventually it will crash.\nWith all 3 virtualization platforms I was able to make a virtual Big Sur and that worked fine. But these I couldn't upgrade to Monterrey either. With the same \"unsupported\" messages as I got on the real hardware.\nMy only option right now seems to try OCLP on a virtual machine (no idea if that would work) or spend a lot of money on a new Mac (which isn't in the budget for this year).\n", "Q: Rename EFI boot entries (MacBook Air) I can't figure out how to rename boot entries on a MacBook Air 2012, i.e. those that appear when holding alt during boot.\nThe problem was initially that my EFI Ubuntu installation could only be booted with the boot entry called \"EFI Boot\", which wasn't very descriptive, but I could live with it. The current problem is that since I installed OpenCore (a third party boot loader that enables Big Sur on this Macbook model) it replaced the Ubuntu boot entry with its own entry, which uses the same name (\"EFI Boot\"). I'm assuming this replacement happened because of the name collision (?).\nAs I see it, the first step of the solution would then be to change the name of the current \"EFI Boot\" entry (that starts OpenCore) so that when I try to recreate the Ubuntu boot entry later the OpenCore entry won't get overwritten. I can't figure out how to do this.\n\nWhat I've tried\nI've tried customizing a suggestion from Apple Community that advised how to do it for an Ubuntu .efi (after mounting the ESP):\nsudo  bless  --folder  /Volumes/EFI/EFI   --file  /Volumes/EFI/EFI/OC/OpenCore.efi  --label  \"OpenCore\"  --shortform  --verbose\n\nThe above command succeeded (in Big Sur), but had no discernible effect on the boot menu upon reboot.\n\nRelated\nI have also read several suggestions that I'm struggling to make sense/use of:\n\n*\n\n*One answer only pertains to macOS (Monterey), and explains that its boot.efi resides on an APFS volume. To me it appears that — on my machine — there's a boot.efi on my ESP (FAT32) in /System/Library/CoreServices, so I don't think I can make use of that even if my goal were to rename an entry for macOS (which it isn't).\n\n*Another answer suggests that you'd just have to rename the volume an OS resides on, but I'm not trying to rename a boot entry corresponding to an OS on a particular volume. Even if I were, the answer implies mounting (?) a Linux filesystem as a volume in macOS, which isn't something that's readily available.\n\n*The third answer says that .VolumeIcons.icns should be on a Mac OS Extended formatted volume, and the name of such a volume will appear in the boot menu. I have no such volumes — only FAT32 (ESP), APFS (Mojave, Big Sur), NTFS (Windows 10) and EXT4 (Ubuntu). I have a .VolumeIcon.icns on the ESP though. But I still can't make sense of it since the question asks about renaming a boot entry for Windows, which I doubt is installed on Mac OS Extended. Even if it were, the entry I want to rename doesn't have its own volume to the best of my knowledge.\n\n\nA: I'm having a similar issue with the less-specific volume setup - Boot Camp volume label won't get changed despite %disk_label% files are being successfully created (where they are supposed to be created). You can have a look in a similar question of mine. It appears to me that there's a firmware bug that causes this behavior. Quite similar issue was introduced in firmware updates in about macOS Big Sur 11.3 release: .VolumeIcon.icns file in placed to root of /Volumes/EFI were not respected by Startup Manager (so no custom volume icons in Startup Manager were displayed). Only firmware update fixed this.\nMeanwhile please keep this question posted if you'll stumble upon a fix.\n", "Q: Does Spatial Audio offer any advantage without Head Tracked Stereo?

From the CSS defined on the page:\n@media print {\n    ...\n    a[href]:after {\n        content: \"(\" attr(href) \")\";\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nSo they specifically want to include the link (attr(href)) after the link text as you see it in your PDF.\n\nYou can modify the CSS locally (but you most likely need to do this for each page you want to print from that site):\n\n*\n\n*Enable the Developer menu in Safari (Preferences -> Advanced -> Show Develop menu)\n\n\n*Open the Web Inspector with Opt-Cmd-I\n\n\n*Select the \"Sources\" tab\n\n\n*On the left hand side, navigate into Style Sheets\n\n\n\n*Within Style Sheets, scroll down to an entry starting with a9dad and click on it\n\n\n*Click into the window part to the right (with the CSS code inside), type Cmd-F, enter print and press Enter. This should bring you to the print definitions in the file\n\n\n\n*Remove the relevant lines (lines 204-206 in my case)\n\n\n*Print the page without reloading it first\n", "Q: Homebrew Command error: zsh: command not found:$ On the Terminal commandline I tried:\n$ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/master/Formula/osgeo-saga-lts.rb\n\nBut I get this response:\nzsh: command not found: $\n\nI also tried using brew tap osgeo/osgeo4mac and get a similar response:\nzsh: command not found: #\n\nI am not sure what the difference is from $ or # and why I get these responses.\nI have tried using a export PATH=PATH... fix of two variants in the homebrew folder, but this isn't working either...\nWhat fix or mods can I make for it to work and download the content for QGIS?\n\nA: I faced this issue in M1 chip.

I just noticed that some of my songs that Apple Music is marking as Uploaded rather than Matched, are actually greyed out on the album page within Apple Music. If I try to add these streaming versions to my library, these tracks are unplayable, and have a dotted cloud icon as well as a message saying that they are no longer available.\nSo, I guess the obvious reason these particular tracks aren't getting matched is that they are not actually in the Apple Music catalog. However, if I look up the same album in the iTunes Store, more often than not I find that the tracks are available for purchase.\nDoes iTunes Match match tracks to a different catalog than Apple Music? I guess what I'm saying is, if I were to cancel my Apple Music subscription and get an iTunes Match subscription (something I've been thinking of doing), would it only match my tracks against the iTunes Store's catalog instead of Apple Music's, to see if they are in there? Or are the services actually supposed to check both catalogs?\nIt seems like the timings and metadata (and likely the music files themselves) are the exact same between the two services, but if each service only checks its respective catalog, and I run into cases like this where one service has something that the other doesn't... it makes me wonder if I really need both services, in order to check my music against everything that Apple has available out there?\n\nA: This page has a clear description of the services which I have brazenly copy/pasted here:\n\nApple Music vs. iTunes Match: The true difference between Apple Music and iTunes Match is that iTunes Match is an iCloud storage and syncing service for one’s own music library including songs and albums across multiple Apple devices. Apple Music is a music streaming service plus including all feature of iTunes Match.\n\nHere's an image, lifted from this page with the information in a handy chart:\n\n", "Q: How is my Mac able to make a (FaceTime) voice call to a land line when my iPhone and iPad are switched off? I have always assumed that when I make a voice call from the FaceTime app on my iMac, the call is being proxied through my iPhone. (In fact, the FaceTime UX says, Call Using iPhone; see attached image.)\n\nHowever, today I tried an experiment: I switched off both my iPhone and my iPad--which has a cellular plan; I also turned off the WiFi on my iMac so that it was connected to the Internet only through an Ethernet cable to my router. I then used FaceTime on my iMac to call my landline. The call went through, reaching the answering machine hooked up to that phone.\nMy question is: How did this work? Does my iMac have some sort of VOIP system that it can use if it can't access a cellular device?\nI am running macOS Big Sur 11.6.5 (20G527)\n\nA: Yes, that is correct. Apple calls this Wi-Fi Calling.\nThe feature requires support from your carrier. The carrier has an Internet-accessible VoIP system that your iPhone can use when it has an internet connection, but it has no cellular connection (or very low signal strength) - and similarly it can be used by your other devices, such as the Mac, if you have enabled that.\nNote that even though it has the name \"Wi-Fi Calling\", which seems to be confusing to some, the technology has absolutely nothing to do with Wi-Fi and does not require you to use Wi-Fi. If your Mac is connected to the Internet over Ethernet for example, that works just as well.\n", "Q: Programatically disconnecting/reconnecting Yubikey device I have a:\nMacBookPro 16\"\nOS 12.3\nand I have a \"YubiKey 5C Nano\".\neach time my device goes to sleep the key stops responding, and disconnecting + reconnecting is a hassle\nfound similar issues:\n\n*\n\n*Software-only way to disconnect and reconnect a USB device?\n\n*Remount drive without physically disconnecting?\nasked on a GH repo and got turned down:\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl/issues/372\nany help + debugging this would be highly appreciated :)\n\nA: The suggestion you got on GitHub is probably the easiest way to go for a quick fix: I.e. add a supported USB hub to the system, plug the YubiKey in the USB hub - and if your problem hasn't gone away already, you can use uhubctl to restart the YubiKey.\nApart from that, I would contact YubiKey support and let them know you have this issue with their product.\n", "Q: macOs Monterey UDP sockets permissions for socat I have installed socat on macOs Montery thanks to homebrew.\nThe command:\nsocat UDP4-RECVFROM:8888,ip-add-membership=239.255.98.99:192.168.1.100,fork,reuseaddr -\n\ndoesn't retrieve any datagram (same command on a Linux machine does).\nI have read that:\n\nFor UDP sockets, the network entitlements restrict both initiation and\ndata flow. For example, an app with only the client entitlement\nenabled can send, but not receive, data. Apps using UDP usually\nrequire both entitlements.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_network_client\n\nHow to give such permissions to socat?\n\nA: You cannot give such permissions to socat. The documentation you have found is only for sandboxed apps. socat is not a sandbox app, and is thus not restricted in that area, and therefore you cannot give it permissions to \"break out\" of a sandbox that it was never in in the first place.\nEven further, had socat been a sandboxed app, you're still looking at the wrong permission. That permission only controls sending out UDP packets. You want to receive them, so that's the \"server\" permission (com.apple.security.network.server) instead of the \"client\" permission (com.apple.security.network.client) that you quote in your question.\nI assume you are aware that you are not \"just\" trying to receive UDP datagrams - you are also trying to do it using IP multicasting. Perhaps it would be better to open up a separate question to detail what you're trying to achieve as the end-goal, and solutions can be found for you.\n", "Q: Auto sync iPhone video with MacBook I take videos with my iPhone and I would like them to be automatically transferred to my MacBook without using iCloud.\nThe use case is that I take large videos, filming for 15 min to hours and I want the files to get to my computer as soon as the camera is stopped. Because those files are larges they fill the phone fast and it’s annoying to always have to stop, plug the phone, select the files, delete the files, etc.\nI would like to set it up once and have the file transferred via WiFi and deleted on the iPhone as soon as the video is taken and the WiFi is on.\nWith all the people vlogging, there should be a better way.\nI tried Airdrop and I had a look at software to sync (like Syncthing) but it seems that iOS forbids automatic actions on files so it’s not possible for a third-party application.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Like you mentioned,\n\nit seems that iOS forbids automatic actions on files\n\nThat is true, for both third party, and as far as I know, for first party too. By that I mean there is no native ways in iOS and macOS to use your MacBook as a storage medium for your iPhone to immediately dump recorded videos into it over WiFi automatically upon finishing a recording.\nSince firstly this sort of needs is very niche and Apple would highly likely to not bother adding such feature anytime soon (I may be wrong).\nSecondly, videos you record has to go through several steps before it is ready to be used. When you stop the camera, the recorded footage needs to be encoded into device readable format. Then it takes time to transfer data whether wired or wirelessly to other devices.\n\nI want the files to get to my computer as soon as the camera is stopped\n\nHence achieving this is not very realistic.\nHowever doing the same thing, but with photos is possible, thanks to Continuity Camera. Here's a summary of how to do it, but Official Apple Documentation is also available for reference.\nTo import a captured image from your iPhone immediately onto your Mac, right click your Mac desktop, select \"Import from iPhone or iPad\", find your iPhone in the list, choose \"Take Photo\".\nAny photos taken by your iPhone in this state will immediately be transferred over onto your Mac's Desktop, automatically.\nFor your need of transferring videos, I think AirDrop is the simplest and easiest way to go. Of course if you have genuinely large video files (10GB+), a high speed external SSD will come in handy.\nIf the reason you would like to sync content between devices without iCloud is because you think iCloud is not good enough for you, consider OneDrive. This service also has automatic content synchronization feature between devices. The only caveat I see is that it can take a while for large videos to upload from your phone and be downloaded onto your Mac.\n", "Q: How to resolve Reminders keeps crashing when accessing \"ToDo\" folder I'm using 10.13.6 macOS High Sierra. Reminders keeps crashing when I try to access a personally-made folder called \"ToDo\" I'm not sure if that folder name is reserved for the system, but it was working for quite a while.

I followed this guide but it only spoofs the last 3 blocks of Mac address. What changes should I make so that the entire MAC address is spoofed and not just the last 3 blocks? And also is it possible to switch rapidly between 'spoofing entire Mac address' and 'spoofing just the last 3 blocks' with simple terminal commands? If so then I need your help.\nAnd I would also like to spoof to one particular fake MAC address which is same every time whenever I copy paste a terminal command how do I go about this?\nI found this code online that spoofs the entire MAC address\nopenssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/(..)/\\1:/g; s/.$//'\nAnd also would this command given right above give me an infinite permutations of MAC Address or just a few MAC Addresses\nAny help would be grateful.\n\nA: By following the guide, you have created a script named spoof.sh. In this script, you have the following lines:\nmac_address_suffix=$(openssl rand -hex 3 | sed 's/\\(..\\)/\\1:/g; s/.$//')\nmac_address=$(echo \"$mac_address_prefix:$mac_address_suffix\" | awk '{print tolower($0)}')\n\nYou can change as follows to use the command, you have indicated you like to use:\nmac_address_suffix=$(openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\\(..\\)/\\1:/g; s/.$//')\nmac_address=$(echo \"$mac_address_suffix\" | awk '{print tolower($0)}')\n\nNote that it is not really a good idea to randomly change all components of your MAC address like that. Some MAC addresses are not valid, or have a special meaning - so you might experience various problems that way from time to time.\nRegarding the need to switch \"rapidly\", you can just make two copies of your spoof.sh file. One with the original contents and one with the updated contents - and then you can copy whatever file you want to spoof.sh as you see fit.\nRegarding the number of permutations: A MAC-address consists of 48-bit (here represented as 6 groups of 2 digit hexadecimal numbers) - so you can never get an \"infinite number of permutations\". In this case you're just choosing random numbers, so even though it is not infinite, it is still quite a lot. More precisely, you'll be able to get 2^48 permutations (281.474.976.710.656 permutations).\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2010 white screen When I start my MacBook, I have an empty folder with a question mark.

Make sure you can see the UDP packets there first - and then later you can get socat running.\nThe interesting thing in this question is that you state that it works on Ethernet but not on Wi-Fi. I'm assuming you're using a fairly recent Mac - they support multicast on WiFi just fine. To check run this command in the Terminal:\nifconfig en0\n\n(where en0 should be replaced with the interface name of your WiFi)\nThis should say something like this:\nen0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n\nNote that it says \"MULTICAST\" - this is required for things to work.\nThe next step is to check your routing tables. You might have set things up to exclusive route multicast on the Ethernet interface and not the WiFi interface. In the Terminal run this command:\n netstat -nr | grep ^2\n\nYou should hopefully see lines like this:\n224.0.0/4          link#5             UmCS           en0      \n239.255.98.99      yyyyyy             UHmLWI         en0\n\nMake sure that either the general route or the specific route exists and that it for the WiFi interface (instead of the ethernet interface).\nYou might also want to try changing the service order. Do that by opening System Preferences > Networks and then click the small circled ... icon beneath the list of interfaces and select Set Service Order. Make sure your WiFi interface is listed before the Ethernet interface.\nAlso in System Preferences, you should check Sharing and ensure that Internet Sharing is not enabled.\n\nA: The main issue is Apple has packet capture tools already installed.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/recording_a_packet_trace\nWhy not use them to capture your packets and wire shark or another tool to analyze them.\n\nA: It was the internet sharing (in Sharing Preferences) that caused the problem.\n", "Q: Why would Spotlight be using lots of CPU when only a few things are being indexed? I've been trying to diagnose hangs and bad perf on my 2015 MBP running MacOS 12.2.1.

But Spotlight processes are still using a lot of  CPU between them. Any idea why?\nI added two screenshots below: one from a \"low usage\" case where md* processes are using ~25% of one CPU, and another \"high usage\" case where about 11 md* processes are using ~20% each.\n\n\n\nA: My advice is to not use Time Machine to back up to a NAS. It’s much better to back up to an attached drive and then copy specific data / snapshots to NAS.\nI would reach out to your NAS vendor to ask about spotlight settings / recommendations for their specific implementation.\nIt’s a ton of work to diagnose some spotlight issues - but running a mddiagnose now and another in a day - then reaching out to Apple Support to ask if you missed anything might be worthwhile next steps.\nNAS are great for file storage - but on the newest OS - I would let Time Machine and APFS snapshots exist on direct attached disks at all cost if you care about the best performance of the OS.\nTactically, to calm things down:\n\n*\n\n*Pause Backups and then restart your Mac. (Pause means turn off Time Machine and any other periodic sync or backup)\n\n*Quit Outlook and then disconnect from the network.\n\n*Set the mac to dim / sleep the screen but never sleep and let it run for hours and/or overnight.\n\n", "Q: How can I restore Notes from a time machine backup? I originally had the Notes app syncing to my Google account. I changed my google password 8 months ago and never bothered to update it on my machine. Today I went to Notes/Accounts and unchecked the Google box (because I wanted to use iCloud to back them up instead). All my notes disappeared. Since I wasn't logged into Google they weren't saved in Google. During troubleshooting I logged into Google locally and it restored some Notes (but only those from before 8 months ago). The ones I've written since then are gone.\nLuckily I backed up my computer a few days ago so I believe this data is on my external hard drive. I've tried multiple ways to restore. First I used TimeMachine to restore the Library/Group Containers/group.com.app.notes files but no notes show up. I tried to open the .sqlite files directly in my terminal. And I tried this method but received a message that no notes were found (its an answer from 2018): Can't restore my notes on macOS\nThe Apple store told me to erase my computer and restore it from the backup but that seems extreme (and they're not sure it will even work).\nHow can I get my notes back from the time machine backup?\nHere's view of my backed up notes folder:\nLibrary/Group Containers/group.com.app.notes\n\n\nA: The Notes files you need to restore are in Containers and Group Containers, both must be restored from back up.\nThe files are com.apple.notes in Containers and group.com.apple.notes in Group Containers.\nThe Library folder in the path mentioned may be hidden so press Shift/Command/Period together to reveal. Both GC & C folders are in same Library folder. Path: User/Library(may be hidden)/Containers/com.apple.notes etc.\nSelect each file, don't open, and copy to desktop.\nDo same procedure, same folders on your data storage disk on your computer and paste in the copied files each into their relevant folder, again don't open.\nI did this successfully following update (clean install) up to Catalina which will not see Time Machine backups by earlier OS so all had to be done manually.\n", "Q: Finder search doesn't work when searching individual folders in iCloud Drive A few months ago I switched from backing up to an external drive using Time Machine to just having everything on my iCloud Drive and it automatically backing up any changes I make.\nSince then, I've been having problems with Finder search (cmd+F with a Finder window open):\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder search can't find files when I search the folder that was open rather than \"This Mac\". I've tried typing text directly into the \"Search for:\" field, using \"Filename matches\" and using \"Tags matches\". None of them work.\n\n*Smart folders, since they must be created (as far as I know) from a Finder search, don't work either if they rely on searching within a specific folder rather than the whole Mac; they just turn up empty. This applies also to smart folders I created before moving everything to my iCloud Drive (which were working perfectly before said move).\n\n*Oddly, Finder search does find items if I search \"This Mac\".\n\n*Spotlight works just fine (after reindexing my iCloud Drive; see below); it does find files that are in my iCloud Drive. But then I guess Spotlight is searching the wole Mac and not just a specific folder.\n\nThe move to iCloud (and the beginning of these problems) happened on an Intel Mac running Catalina. I'm on an M1 Max Mac running Monterey now (I did use Time Machine for the migration to the new computer), and the problems remain exactly as they were on the other computer.\nI've tried a bunch of things, none of which have worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*Obviously, I've made sure the search parameters are correct; in all of my attempts there's at least one file with the specified parameters (file name, etc) in the folder I'm searching in.\n\n*There's nothing in my list of things to exclude from Spotlight (System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy), but I added my personal folder in my iCloud Drive and removed it again anyway in order to force Spotlight to reindex it. I checked that the indexing did indeed take place by entering random text into the Spotlight search field and noticing a progress bar labelled \"Indexing...\" or something of the sort. (Before this, Spotlight was very hit-and-miss with files in my iCloud Drive; after the reindexing was finished, Spotlight was able to find one specific file which it hadn't been able to find earlier, but Finder search remains unable to find it; I haven't tried with more files, but I figure the indexing worked if it can now find things it couldn't before.)\n\n*I don't have optimised storage turned on, so everything on my iCloud Drive is on my computer.\n\n*I force-relaunched Finder after indexing to see whether that would help.\n\nI don't know whether Finder search and Spotlight use the same index and the same engine; I assume they do, because the alternative seems incredibly stupid to me.\n(Possibly related: Since moving everything to my iCloud Drive, the little play button that usually appears when you hover the mouse over the icon of an audio file in Finder isn't appearing on some of the audio files on my iCloud Drive. Other files in the same folder do show a play button. It's always the same files that don't; none of them have custom icons, and all of them showed it before the move.)\nHow can I get Finder search and smart folders working again?\n\nA: This worked for me. I noticed the problem first when trying to find documents in pages and saw that it affected searching any individual folder. I read the link below. I added the entire hard drive to the do not search area in spotlight privacy and waited about a minute before removing it. I could search folders after that but still had trouble with iCloud. I did the same thing with the iCloud drive.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/253479408\n", "Q: \"The file can't be found\" messages after sleep mode but cannot figure out what is causing it? Since I have updated to 12.3 on my MBP 13\" M1, I receive these message boxes when my laptop wakes up from sleep. The weird thing is, it happens repetitively.

Some sort of boot issue seems to occur once a year on this machine, and I will be upgrading but need this one to hold on a little longer.\nFirst, I'm over explaining things here because I've tried so many things and I cant pinpoint an exact issue.\nPressing the power button, I get the POST noise, the apple, and a loading bar. After about 2 minutes of it loading, the screen goes black, and it shuts off. I dual boot Kali Linux with full root permissions (rwx on all partitions/containers), but I have been careful to not make any changes to the osx filesystem. When this first happened, I hadnt made any changes in either OS, It was sleeping, and then I noticed it was off.\nI first tried holding the option key down for the boot options, It showed: EFI Boot(Kali), Skylake(OSX), Install Mac OSX(it said something like this but I had never seen it before), and Recovery HD. I was thinking maybe it was updating and the update failed and fudged up the boot info.. so I booted the online recovery mode. Ran first aid on the drive and it failed. Initially because it couldnt be unmounted. When it did unmount it still failed first aid for anything in an APFS container.. So I booted into kali linux, found some weird log message saying there was a failed install on OSX, and then back in Recovery mode I could get it to populate and it gave me an option to revert changes. I chose yes. Now the \"Install Mac OSX\" option is gone from the boot menu but it still shuts off during boot and no other options or questions I've found in the forums so far have worked to my advantage. I'm at a loss, I have included pictures for some of the basic things, let me know if I can run something else. I'm not as well versed with OSX diag and terminal commands like I am with linux, but I've never had to work this hard on an issue for this computer before.\nI think the boot partition is corrupted but attempting those fixes never bore results. When booting into recovery mode it always said \"Install\" instead of \"Reinstall\" so even the recovery drive could not recognize the filesystem. I ran a few other checks on the file structure and I after a few attempts, I DID get the online recovery to see the filesystem to see the \"Reinstall\" option. That ran for about 3 hours and came back with a log error that it couldnt reboot itself and it was in the middle of trying to force a reboot. After about two minutes of no other changes to the log, it did reboot. but then came up with the same file system error that first aid was giving.\nI'm at a loss, I've included pics of some basic commands, the log after running first aid, and one of the reinstall failures.\nPlease help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: So I've not been able to get it repaired, and since I've not received any comments, I went forward with a format and reinstall. I needed to pull the data off though, so I booted into my Linux build and ran the following command:\nsudo apt install libfsapfs-utils\n\nI plugged in my backup drive and then switched to the root account for the next steps. I ran the following command to get the volume info\nsudo fdisk -l\nsudo fsapfsmount -f 1 [device/container] [mount point]\n\nThe device being /dev/sda2 and the mount point being /media/root\nFor the mount point, I couldn't get it to mount to root without needing an exception so I used my 2nd user profile as the mount point while logged in as root. For me it was:\nsudo fsapfsmount -f 1 /dev/sda2 /media/kali\n\nI then copied over all my data to my backup drive. And used g parted to wipe and partition the drive as needed for my reinstall.

I regularly take snapshots of my Macbook's screen with my iPhone to capture information I need handy, a list of library books to go hunting for, a map plus a bus schedule, etc.\nMy iPhone is plugged via USB into my laptop for hotspotting, it seems like there should be some way to just push the screenshot sitting on my desktop into my phone with a drag and drop, but I can't think of any.\nIs it possible? If so, is it quick and easy?\nThere are some methods that are cumbersome in answers to Push photo from MacBook to iPhone via USB but I am hoping that with the latest software updates there might be a much faster way.\n\nYou might ask\n\nWhy not just photograph it?\n\nYes this works pretty well but\n\n*\n\n*I get pixel moire patterns at certain phone-screen distances\n\n*the photos are rotated and have perspective distortion because I am really bad at holding the phone in exactly the right place.\n\n*White becomes gray, and because of the screen's non-uniform illumination wrt illumination angle it's always bright in the middle and darker near the edges/corners.\n\n*I get reflections from the Sun or bright lights as there is no specific anti-glare layer on macbook screens.\n\n*I have to remember to move it to a special screenshot folder on my phone or it gets lost quickly as I take a ton of photos.

My company recently required me to install Cisco AnyConnect on my privately used MacBook Pro in order to connect to the company VPN. At seemingly random times after installation this message keeps popping up:\n\nI keep refusing the request and the VPN works anyway, but the message keeps showing up which is really annoying. When you accept it, AnyConnect will add these Socket Filters in Network Preferences:\n\nThe filters are always running and connected to something, even if the VPN is disconnected. What are they actually doing? How can I permanently refuse the installation of these socket filters?\n\nA: In general, a global socket filter is small program installed on your computer that - when enabled - is able to inspect and edit any socket network data sent and received by programs on your computer.\nSocket network data includes communication on your local network and on the Internet - almost all ordinary programs uses socket networking.\nThe program can chose to do almost anything with the data that flows through it. It can change data that you receive from for example the Internet before it reaches an application, and it can modify data that applications tries to send to the network. All without that application knowing about it.\nIt is also possible for a socket filter to never modify incoming and outgoing data - but instead just read the data that is passed through it. That can be either something simple like a filter that counts up your network usage in terms of types - or it can be something malicious like waiting for a specific time and then sending copies of your data to a foreign state.\nIn this specific case, the Cisco claims that their AnyConnect socket filter performs the following three tasks:\n\n*\n\n*DNS proxying\n\n*App/transparent proxying\n\n*Content filtering\n\nAs far as I understand from this document, the DNS proxying feature is meant to ensure that all DNS requests from your computer are routed through the VPN. Any attempts to do DNS lookups from outside the VPN tunnel are blocked.\nApp/transparent proxying means that when programs on your computer try to communicate with the network, the data they try to send (not the fully network packets) are routed through a proxy server on the other side of the VPN. This essentially allows the VPN server and its proxy server to do various kinds of filtering, blocking, etc.\nContent filtering means that data you send and/or receive can be filtered. For example the VPN administrator might decide that any access to facebook.com should be blocked when using the VPN.\n\nA: A socket filter is a means to listen to a particular network socket and communicate with an application.\nIn Cisco AnyConnect's case, the fact that their socket filters show as 'running' is a poor choice of naming - they are running in the context of the local system, but are not communicating anything back to any external host.  You can test this by disabling all active Internet connections or network services.\nIf you're still concerned, create a new network Location from System Preferences > Network, select each Cisco interface and set it to disabled.  Then just switch to that location before opening the AnyConnect application and connecting to your organization's VPN.\n", "Q: Can I reset my firmware password manually or using third party tools? i forgot my firmware password on my macbook air 2013,i was tempting to replace my .efi file, but online articles says its too risks my machine can be corrupted forever. any idea on how i can solve this.\n\nA: From https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455:\n\nIf you can't remember your firmware password, schedule an in-person service appointment with an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider.

You can change the behaviour in Safari Prefences:\n\nGoogle Chrome and Brave have a similar setting in Settings > Advanced > Downloads.\n\nA: The accepted answer may help more people with this issue, but I'm adding this Brave-specific answer because it deals with a secondary configuration option which overrides the \"Ask where to save\" for \"certain file types\".\nClearing \"Open certain file types...\" fixed the issue for me:\n\nAs far as I know, this secondary option can only be enabled if you say yes to a prompt when downloading certain file types, such as PDFs.\n", "Q: Unable to access subdirectories off user home directory when logging in via SSH When logging into a Mac with SSH remote-access enabled, I'm unable to access files in ~/Desktop, ~/Documents, and the like.

How can I fix this?\n\nYou can have Preview first open a PDF document (PDF) in either of the Continous Scroll, Single Page, or Two Page modes. You can set any through the \"Opening for the first time:\" option accessible through Preview -> Preferences -> PDF in Preview.\nThere is no setting for a sidebar such as that for thumbnails, ToC, bookmarks, etc. to be automatically displayed or not when a PDF is first opened by Preview. However, if a sidebar is open when you close a document, then that sidebar would automatically open when you open the same document again. If you don't want a sidebar to open automatically when you open the same document again, just close any open sidebar by pressing Command ⌘+Alt ⌥+1 before closing the document.\nHowever, closing any open sidebar before closing a PDF doesn't work if you have been viewing the document in the full-screen mode just before closing it. There appears to be a bug in Preview at this time (Preview v11.0 on macOS Monterey - v12.3) which causes any PDF closed when in full-screen mode to be opened along with a thumbnail sidebar when it is opened again. That is, the only way to make sure a PDF is not opened with a sidebar at this time seems to be closing the PDF without a sidebar when not in full-screen mode. I have reported this bug to Apple Product Feedback after writing this answer.\n\nI wish to open Preview to full screen by default or using shell automation script, how can this be done?\n\nI don't think there is a setting to enable the full-screen mode by default in Preview. There is a hack that kind of works for some of the programs available in macOS as explained in the \"How to Make Apps Open in Full Screen Mode on Mac Automatically\" article but it does not seem to work for Preview. However, you can you press Fn+F or Command ⌘+Ctrl ⌃+F right after you open a document in Preview to switch to full screen.\nUnfortunately, I don't know how you can open any file automatically in full screen with Preview using either Automator or some AppleScript code.\n", "Q: Connecting iMac 2015 to MPB 2021 M1 Max I need some help connecting two Macs. I have a late 2015 27\" iMac and a new 2021 MBP M1 Max.\nI would like to connect my iMac to my MBP to share files and the printer. I know I can do this over WiFi, but my photos, for example, are 300 GB and it seems sensible to have a permanent connection, if it is easy to set up.\nI also have an Anker Apex 12-in-1 Thunderbolt 4 Dock port replicator which is working to drive 2 Ben 27\" 4k monitors.\nI would like it set up so that file transfers between the two computers use the wired connection, but internet activity from both computers uses the WiFi network.\nIs this possible?\nIf so, please could you tell me exactly which cable I need to buy?\n\nA: The maximum file transfer speed of the 2015 iMac is 20 Gbps through the Thunderbolt 2 ports. You can connect the two Macs to transfer at this speed by using Apple's Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter and Apple Thunderbolt Cable. (On the 2015 iMac, the ethernet port has a maximum speed of 1 Gbps and the USB ports have a maximum speed of 5 Gbps.)\nThe adaptor is listed as compatible with your MBP and the cable is listed as compatible with your iMac. Thunderbolt 4 is backward compatible with Thunderbolt 3.\nOnce connected, the connection will appear in the Network pane of the System Preferences application as a Thunderbolt Bridge. You can then use Connect to Server popup of the Finder Application to connect via smb. For example, if the iMac shows a IP address of 192.168.8.2, then enter smb://192.168.8.2 as the server address in the popup window on the MBP. You will get a window showing the drives on the iMac.\n", "Q: Terminal command to reset USB-C ports on Macs Is there a terminal command that resets the USB port without having to unplug and plug the device? Sometimes my USB hub (HDMI, Ethernet, USB3) malfunctions, and the only fix is to unplug/plug or reboot the computer.\nIn my case, my external monitor connected by HDMI will sometimes fail to be detected when waking from sleep. What happens is that my MacBook Air M1 still thinks the external is connected, but the monitor is black. The built-in display still behaves as the extended monitor. I have tried to detect displays in the Display options or scaling to try and force the system to redetect the monitor. The fix is always to restart or unplug the USB hub.\nThere is an app called \"uhubctl\", but that did not work on the port for HDMI. I had similar issues when I used Linux with USB hubs. Sometimes Ethernet would not be detected on boot, but there was a terminal command that reset the port which I wrote into a script and hot keyed. Therefore I am trying to do the same with my Mac.\n\nA: No, there's no such Terminal Command on macOS.\nuhubctl is used to command an external USB hub to power off/on one or more of its USB ports. It cannot be used to power off/on an HDMI port, nor to power on/off the hub itself.\nIf you could remember the Terminal command you had used in the past, it would perhaps be possible to find a macOS equivalent for that - but if you have no idea what it could be then it is ofcourse difficult. The manufacturer of your dock might have added all sorts of proprietary features to it, but without knowing which dock you have, or the details of the Linux command, it is not possible to give you more guidance here.\nUPDATE:\nIn the comments you indicate that you have used this command on Linux for this purpose:\necho -n \"0000:00:00\" | tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ehci_hcd/unbind\n\nThis does not turn off a USB port however, it actually resets (turns off) the whole USB2 controller - i.e. this kills all the USB2 ports.\nYou can probably do something similar on macOS although I don't know how practical it would be. According to the description you have given in your question, you're not using USB2 ports there, but instead have USB3 ports. So it's no longer the EHCI controller, but rather the XHCI controller, that you potentially want to reset.\nYou might be able to do that using commands such as:\nkmutil unload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBXHCI\nkmutil load -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBXHCI\n\nDepending on what kind of hardware you have and what you have plugged in, there might be other kernel extensions that you want to unload in advance. For example it might be com.apple.driver.usb.AppleUSBXHCIPCI. Take a look at the output from running kextstat to see what you have running before doing anything.\n\nA: I can confirm that the UHUBCTL solution works for Dell D6000 usb issues.

Specifically:\n\n*\n\n*I still use macOS Catalina (10.15.6) on my machine (because it has been my experience that Apple's upgrades create a larger risk surface for dysfunction).\n\n\n*In following the procedure for enabling the root user - which I completed successfully thanks to the detailed recipe - I found that upon completion, the su approach remained unavailable to me on my system:\n% su\nPassword:\nsu: Sorry\n% <repeated several times>\n\nWhich seems odd as su is definitely installed on Catalina, and is functional for other users (including Admins). Perhaps this was done in /etc/pam.d/su?\nInstead, I had to resort to this to get the root prompt, which of course is useless for recovery on a Catalina system (maybe others?) if you had made the OP's spelling error:\n% sudo su     # or 'sudo su -' if you prefer\nPassword:\nsh-3.2# whoami\nroot\nsh-3.2#\n\nref addenda notes 1. & 2. in the sequel\n\n\n*The OP asked another question:\n\nDo you know how can I find the /etc folder from the cd /Macintosh/ HD?\n* Subsequently corrected to cd /Macintosh\\ HD\n\nOn my old Catalina system, Macintosh HD appears Under Finder's \"Locations\", but:\n% cd /Macintosh\\ HD\ncd: no such file or directory: /Macintosh HD  \n% cd Macintosh\\ HD \ncd: no such file or directory: Macintosh HD \n% cd 'Macintosh HD'\ncd: no such file or directory: Macintosh HD\n\nYet, I can see the contents of Macintosh HD when I click it in the Finder window. I'm sure it's just me: this strikes me as a bit of a disconnect... but not a reason to upgrade  :)\nBut back to the question at hand, here's what I see when trying to list the contents of the /etc folder on my Catalina system:\n% ls -l /etc\nlrwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  admin  11 Dec  5  2019 /etc -> private/etc \n\n# should this have been '/etc -> /private/etc' ?? \n\nHowever, we can get there like this:\n~ % cd /etc \n/etc % ls -l\ntotal 1072\n-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel     515 Nov  9  2019 afpovertcp.cfg\nlrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel      15 Dec  5  2019 aliases -> postfix/aliases\n-rw-r-----   1 root  wheel   16384 Nov  9  2019 aliases.db\n\n...\n\n/etc %\n\n\n\n*In closing, wrt editing /private/etc/sudoers (or whatever it's now called), NOTE there is also a folder named :/private/etc/sudoers.d\nsudoers.d is empty on my Catalina system, but it is potentially a great place for adding things like assigning the NOPASSWD option (or NOPASSED if you prefer :) to a user. Note that if you want to create additional rules in sudoers.d, you'll need to include this line in your sudoers file:\n\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nOne should use visudo -f for editing files under sudoers.d - it does the same syntax & \"spelling\" checks on the entries, but if an entry is added using a conventional editor, it is said that errors will not lock one out of their system. It has other advantages, but I don't know how useful they are for macOS users.\nAlways use sudo visudo to edit the sudoers file - regardless of where it's been located on your system. This will avoid the need for an excursion into Single User Mode - especially important if the su command won't get you to the root prompt on your system (e.g. Catalina).\n\nThe \"Addendum/FYI/Not part of the answer section\":\nNote 1:\nI still find it odd that this works even before (and after) the root user was enabled... which beggars the question, \"What were they thinking?\"\nNote 2:\nAs an aside, for those who are curious about sh:\n% sh --version\nGNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin19)\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n:)  lol\n", "Q: mdfind using -name option I get this result:\n user@10 $  mdfind kind:application -name \"Seashore\" -onlyin /Volumes/WD\\ Elements\n/Volumes/WD Elements/backup 2018/Desktop/Seashore.app\n/Volumes/WD Elements/backup Juli 2021/Desktop/Seashore.app\n/Volumes/WD Elements/Backup 2020 Aug/Desktop/Seashore.app\n\nBut then I get this:\nuser@10 $ mdfind kind:application -name \"*shore\" -onlyin /Volumes/WD\\ Elements  \n user@10 $\n\nI tried with different wildcards and need help.

A few months back I started noticing that the edges around persons in movies were ... strangely fuzzy when moving, but was unable to identify it closer.

The reason that it is not accepted as valid, is not because that the certificate itself is expired but that the local copy of the root certificate involved in the trust chain for the certificate is expired (which should be able to be found if you go through the other certificates displayed)\nIn other words, your machine needs newer copies of the root certificates, which comes as part of security upgrades and new versions of MacOS.\nYour machine is new enough that install all available updates from Apple as prompted (including new versions of MacOS) should fix the problem.\nFor others with machines that are old enough that \"new enough\" security updates are not available, the cure for web surfing is to install a HTTP Proxy server on another machine and configure MacOS to use it to access the Internet.

My teen son is highly addicted to porn. After tons of research, I have set up very strong DNS filtering and powerful website and app blockers on his computer. These launch on login and are are unable to be killed because Activity Monitor and other workarounds are blocked. I have admin rights, he is a standard user. However, he's figured out how to start the Mac in Safe Mode, which doesn't launch the website and app blockers on startup and thus are rendered useless. My son has a Macbook Air with an M1 chip.\nAnd yes, we're working on other methods to get him to stop. He has no phone, for example.\nAs we work through parenting - is there a way to disable or block Safe Mode from being used?\n\nA: It seems possible to use the recoveryOS or firmware password protection to restrict safe mode.\n\nOn Macs with Apple Silicon, a recoveryOS password can be set using MDM with the SetRecoveryLock command. If a recoveryOS password is set, the user cannot access the recovery environment including startup options screen without entering that password.\nSee Apple Support: Startup Security in macOS - recoveryOS password for details.\nHowever, I have no personal experience using MDM, but it seems like in order to use MDM, you have to enroll the Mac in the Apple Business Manager. Unfortunately, this seems to require a DUNS number (a business ID). There are third-party MDM alternatives available as well. Refer to question Password protect recovery mode apple silicon with new Recovery Lock Command for possible solutions.\n\nOn Intel Macs with a T2 chip, a firmware password can be set in Utilities > Startup Security Utility after booting into recovery mode. See Apple Support: About Startup Security Utility on a Mac with the Apple T2 Security Chip for details.\n\nFileVault work-around\nAs a work-around, you may use FileVault to limit access. If you disallow the user to unlock FileVault, then the user won't be able to boot the Mac. However, this means that an admin user always has to boot the Mac first, then once it's running, the limited user can login.\nTo disallow FileVault for the user:\nsudo fdesetup remove -user username\n\n\nA: No - Safe Mode is how the system allows fixing things. Even passcode locks allow erasing.\n\n*\n\n*As the commenter mentioned, you will need to have the router put all machines into a subnet where there is no internet. Then you’ll have to set up VPN to get your trusted machines out of “jail” and back on to the internet.\n\n*There is no firmware password on Apple Silicon so you need to leverage something that safe mode disables to enable your internet for your plan to work.\n\nPractically, it will be much easier to use iCloud Activation Lock and an MDM to send a lock command for when you need to prevent a boot and then unlock it when their suspension period is over.\n\n*\n\n*Physical custody / supervised access is likely going to be your only way if you can’t set up logging on the router and then reward / discipline for when they exert self control and when they lapse.\n\nEven MDM lock isn’t foolproof since I believe they can still wipe the machine and set up a new account bypassing your system controls, lack of admin access and more at the expense of all the data and apps on the Mac. This is where a business or school would use Apple Busniess Manager / Apple School Manager and DEP and a consumer can use iCloud Activation lock to prevent reuse once the Mac is erased.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208987\nGood luck, there is rarely a technical solution for people problems, when the people problems are big enough and compliance can not be pre-negotiated and checked regularly.\n", "Q: Boot from USB (Kali Linux, M1 Silicon) I created a live USB on a SanDisk 32GB flash using Kali Linux live ISO and Balena Etcher software (I also tried dd) but the USB won't show up in the boot drive selector.\nStartup menu\n\nKali ISO\n\nusb EFI in finder\n\nOutput from diskutil command\ndiskutil list\n\nI don't want to use a VM\n\nA: For M1 Mac please follow the below steps to go into the startup options:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your Mac via the Apple logo and Shut Down.\n\n*Press the on/off button and hold it down.\n\n*Once the Apple logo appears, press and hold the on/off button again until you see Loading Startup Options.\n\nTook me a couple of attempts before it loaded up.\n\nA: You have to enable security boot options first :\n\n*\n\n*Turn on your Mac, then press and hold Command (⌘)-R immediately after you see the Apple logo.

I assume that reinstating the old Mac to the new one using Migration Assistant and time machine might not work that well, since the two OSs are so far apart (basically, I assume that a lot of the stuff in ~/Library and /Library might not be organised in the same way in the two OSs (I did have some issues with Mail.app after migration with MA and TM between two Macs with a different OS version).  I might be wrong about my concerns, but if anyone has a best practice to migrate from a very old to a very new Mac I'd be much obliged.\n\nA: I'd use a 'live' Migration rather than one from Time Machine.\nI have much anecdotal evidence to support this bias, but no citable source. I've never had a direct Mac to Mac Migrate fail, even from an old to new OS. I've even successfully Migrated Windows users to new Macs by this method.\nAs you set up the new Mac, Migrate before you configure any new accounts, otherwise you end up with two identities/accounts & will have to unpick it manually afterwards.\nWhen presented with the Migration option, you can select another Mac on the same network. Go to the old Mac & launch Migration Assistant (Applications/Utilities) to make it available as a source for the new Mac. I can't test this right now as running it will quit everything on the source Mac in preparation - but you get the opportunity to enter a confirmation code on both Macs to ensure you're Migrating the correct one & have the authority to do so.\nMigrating in this way should convert things like Mail databases to the new format. It should also move anything that cannot run on the new Mac to appropriate folders placed on the new Desktop, so you can sort through & see which apps etc you need to update/replace.\n\nA: My experience is similar to Tetsujin's: I've had good results using Migration Assistant over several upgrades, including most recently from Mojave/Intel→Monterey/M1.\nI did some preparation before-hand, which was mainly replacing all my old 32-bit apps with Universal (Intel+ARM) versions where available, or at least 64-bit Intel versions. I found a free app called Go64 which did a great job of identifying 32-bit apps and helping keep track of which ones I hadn't upgraded yet. (The easiest cases were apps with free upgrades available; some cost money; and others haven't been updated and so I needed to find alternatives.) It can also help with upgrading x86-64 to ARM, though I think that won't be critical for a couple more versions.\nI ran Migration Assistant as part of the initial new-user set-up on the new machine, but it got stuck at ‘Starting up…’, after scanning and letting me choose which categories to copy, but before actually copying anything. (I tried both over wifi, and by connecting the Time Machine drive directly via USB, but neither worked.) I worked around this by skipping the migration, completing the rest of the initial set-up, getting to the desktop, and then running /Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant manually, which worked fine.\nI was discovering oddities and omissions for a few weeks after the migration — though I guess I'm a ‘power user’, and most Mac users probably wouldn't hit them. I'll go through some of them here, just in case.\nOne potential issue is that the root directory / is no longer writeable on Mojave (not even by root). I learned this the hard way (when some directories I'd put there seemed to disappear in the migration). If you've added any top-level files or folders, I'd suggest moving them into your home directory (probably /Users/<username>) before migrating.\nI had to manually install Rosetta and the command-line tools. (Obviously, only if you're going to use them.)\nMy user account is not an admin (for security reasons; I have a separate admin  account to use when needed), but after migration I couldn't remove admin rights. I eventually did it with sudo dseditgroup -o edit -d <user> -t user admin.\nObviously you'll need to check over your network/wifi/Bluetooth settings. It remembered most of mine, but forgot my DNS setting, and re-enabled Bluetooth. (It seems to do the same after every update, too.)\nStarting a new Terminal window showed the error /etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal:14: INSIDE_EMACS: parameter not set.  I had to change $INSIDE_EMACS to ${INSIDE_EMACS-} in that file. (And then redo that after the first update…)\nIf you use iStat Menus, make sure you're running the latest version. When I migrated, the current version lost access to most of the MBP's sensors, showing only the SSD temperature. v6.61 fixes that. You may need to give it Full Disk Access in System Preferences too. (In fact, you'll probably need to give quite a few programs Full Disk Access; it doesn't seem to migrate that very well.)\nAll the programs I'd installed via Homebrew still worked, surprisingly enough. (Rosetta works very well!) However, it stuck to the x64 versions of apps. To use ARM versions, you pretty much need to reinstall Homebrew from scratch: the ARM version uses a completely different location (/opt/homebrew/ instead of /usr/local). Run brew leaves before updating to show which packages you need to reinstall, and make sure you update $PATH etc.\nIf you use the same Time Machine drive, it will probably start a new backup set for the new machine. (This is probably a good thing.)\niTunes has been replaced by Music, which does most of the same things (though IMHO often not as well). It successfully migrated all my tracks and playlists; but it lost the view settings, so you may need to set up your views, columns, &c again. If you use iTunes Volume Control, that still works with Music, though you may need to reinstall it. Podcasts have been separated out to a new Podcasts app, which should remember your subscriptions (though again, I don't think it works as well).\nA few command-line programs need different options in Monterey. For example, awk no longer has a --lint option, and scp now needs -T. And some programs such as emacs and svn are no longer included, so if you use those you'll need to get them from Homebrew or similar.\nIt recognised my USB-to-serial adapter (without needing any driver installed) — though its device name (in /dev) changed, so I needed to tweak some config for that.\nIf you have any Perl modules, you might need to reinstall those.\nIt didn't copy my sudoers file.\nIf you use at/batch, you may need to give /usr/libexec/atrun Full Disk Access in System Preferences.\nFor some reason, all my Chrome extensions (uBlock Origin, &c) vanished, and I had to reinstall them.\nAnd even more bizarrely, the Times font vanished! But I managed to find a replacement and installed that.\nBut almost everything else Just Worked™, and the migration went more smoothly than I feared. Rosetta in particular is very good indeed — running x86 code on ARM totally transparently (except for the very first launch of each app failing). The most time-consuming and painful part was upgrading or replacing all my old 32-bit apps, but as mentioned, I'd been slowly going through all that in the months before the migration.\n\nA: Ok, I did find the fastest way -- which is by creating a Thunderbolt bridge and then using Migration Assistant.  I followed these instructions, and I followed them.  When I opened Migration Assistant in the two Macs the Thunderbolt bridge was the connection used, and the speed transfer was 10x faster than WiFi at least (100Mb/s vs not even 10Mb/s).\n", "Q: How to Sign In to Your Work or School Account Using a Managed Apple ID with MDM?

In our case we are on a shared web server so don't have access to the httpd.conf file and the changes we applied in our cPanel portal also had no effect.\nThe answer was to add an entry in the .htaccess file.\nAn Apache .htaccess file would need the following entry:\nAddType application/json remotemanagement\n\nHowever our web server is running LiteSpeed so the entry is different. For a LiteSpeed server, the entry in the .htaccess file needs to be this:\n<IfModule mod_mime.c>\n\n<FilesMatch \"[^.]+\\.remotemanagement$\">\n  Header set Content-Type \"application/json\"\n  Header set Content-Encoding \"UTF-8\"\n</FilesMatch>\n\n</IfModule>\n\n\nA: What you are looking for is referred to as account-based user enrollment and it requires some additional configuration on your domain and MDM to work.\nI highly recommend watching the Apple Developer session Discover account-driven User Enrollment (wwdc21-10136) The relevant section starts at about the 6:30 mark.\nHere are some of the highlights.\nYou will need to provide a well-known HTTP resource for your domain at the expected discovery URL e.g. https://example.com/.well-known/com.apple.remotemanagement.

Am I even supposed to be able to do this? Isn't that a Security issue?\n\nA: Now macOS follows a long heritage of OS X and Classic Mac OS of being able to open applications from pretty much whichever disk or location they reside (with spotlight being ever so happy to index them all for you).\nSo, this is expected and by design and isn’t necessarily a security compromise as much as an unwelcome complication or surprise.\n\n*\n\n*If you have physical access to a Mac, you can read and erase things.\n\n*If you depend on not bringing a new OS to bear with its own admin\naccounts, you will want to look at firmware passwords and locks.\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455\nOn the new Apple Silicon Macs, enabling FileVault will protect your entire internal disk and you don’t have to lock it down as much due to all the data being encrypted at rest always.\nIn practice, this is very disconcerting when you have dual boot systems on APFS and see two of every app from spotlight - perhaps one on Monterey, another Big Sur, etc…\n", "Q: How do I add Slack to the menu bar in Mac?

For example, I have an iPhone (64GB) with data erased through factory reset. The deleted data is usually not lost, just differently encrypted (at least before IOS 13). A typical way to recover the deleted data is to scan the whole iPhone and find the fragments of deleted (encrypted) data, and then decipher the data.\nUsing the iPhone again will start to overwrite those encrypted data.\nSince I need to use the phone for other uses right now, and I don't have time to run a deep scan at now, I need to make a copy of the iphone's entire hard drive, to save a copy of the encrypted data.\nThis cannot be completed by just backing up the phone. This is because the usually back-up methods only copies the formatted data, which is around 5GB/64GB.\nI want to \"back-up\" the entire 64GB of binary data into my computer. Does professionals have a way to do this in theory?\n\nA: No, that's not a typical way to recover lost data on iPhones. In almost every instance, your old data is either UNMAP'ed (TRIM'ed) or it was encrypted and now the encryption key is gone. So a copy of the iPhones entire drive won't do you any good, and you won't be able to recover your lost data that way.\nYou're talking about recovering data from the non-formatted part of the drive - that doesn't really make sense in this scenario. There's nothing to be gained there.\nAt the level where you're asking this question, no, there's no practical way for you to do this.\nFor professionals there are ways to copy the drive.

Anything helps.\nThanks.\n\nA: Document-based applications in MacOS are designed to stay active even when they have no documents open. (However, apps with only one window, e.g. System Preferences, will quit when their window is closed.)\nThis is different from other OSes, and trying to 'make it' behave differently from its design is fruitless.\nMacOS manages the RAM usage of applications very efficiently, so you don't need to worry about apps running and it's much faster to have the app 'there' and ready when you next want to open a document.\n", "Q: How to search for a homebrew package by URL with `brew` command?

The battery is dead and the power cable disconnected momentarily as I moved the computer.) I rebooted, and everything seemed okay. I started working on the files from the external drive, editing one, then rearranging some, when suddenly I got a pop up saying \"disk wasn't ejected properly,\" and it vanished.\nI tried to remount it but no luck. I confirmed that the disk is in fact okay because I could work on it on another MacBook Pro running Mojave. And yet I can't get my Mac to even see it. I restarted several times, changed the USB port, nothing. I normally use it through a Thunderbolt port on one of those adapters that connect to the two Thunderbolt ports; another hub plus an external monitor are also routed through there. I also tried it through USB2 through both the adapter and a powered hub. The light on the drive comes up but doesn't blink as it normally does when working.\nIt's not showing in Terminal, either. I now tried other external drives, and none will show. They get power, but the computer doesn't see them at all (no external drives show up in Terminal under diskutil list).\nMy MBP is running super low on memory, both system and working. At the time I was working on heavy Photoshop files, and I think the MBP just chocked. After I closed all programs, restarted, and connected the drive directly to the MBP, it mounted. The problem hasn't gone away entirely as I can't mount other drives (USB 2 connection via adapter or hub). But at least I can see them now in Terminal or Disc Utility even if they won't mount. Does it seem right that the issue was with memory?\nWhat happened? How can I fix it? Help!\n(system_profiler SPUSBDataType output in the images. Lots of stuff connected and functioning, no drive.)\n\n\n\nA: I think I solved it: the issue must have been overloaded memory.\nI've done some massive purging getting some free space, and then the MBP started seeing the external drives, even if I still couldn't mount them (they showed up in disc utility and in terminal). After more cleaning I was able to mount the drive. Now, after even more cleaning and then updating to Monterey, everything works again.\n", "Q: Is there a way to realize two finger dragging and three finger rolling? Three finger is more dull than the two finger, which is more suitable for simple up and down scroll sliding, while the two finger occupy less area of the touch panel, and the resistance during sliding is less than the three finger, which is more suitable for more complex drag actions. Is there any way to exchange the default three finger drag and two finger scroll?\n\nA: Unfortunately, no. The only thing that might theoretically make that possible is BetterTouchTool, but at the moment, it cannot remap scrolling and screen-swapping.\n", "Q: Is it technically possible to recover iPhone 11 data after reset (ios15)? I have limited iCloud back-up. I have no iTunes back-up.\nBefore IOS 12 recovering data after reset is very easy. After IOS 13 it becomes more difficult.\nSo, for professional engineers, is it now still technical possible to recover lost data in the hard drive of IPhone 11 64GB?\nI only need the apple \"Note\". I thought I have all my valuable notes back-up online, so I erase the phone. But later I found out that my Cloud is full.\n\nA: Yes, until the storage is over written the encrypted data exists still. This recovery you contemplate is by no means trivial due to several factors.\n\n*\n\n*you have likely lost access to a key you never had stored off the device to decrypt the data\n\n*multiple snapshots of the filesystem were likely present, which may make your recovery software or analysis of captured data less useful than you hope if you managed to guess or reconstruct the key\n\n*disassembly of the device is usually needed to begin efforts that are reasonably likely to be effective at dumping the raw encrypted data\n\n*solid state storage is not the same as tape or hard drive data storage and this further complicates recovery once you overcome all the above factors\n\nAs a practical matter, the data is well gone unless you bring sufficient technical skills to bear on your problem of not having a backup. Skills and tools that worked for magnetic rotational hard drives don’t translate directly to iPhone hardware design.\n\nA: No, this is not possible for any practical scenario.\nIt is also totally false that this was \"very easy\" before iOS 12.\nThis is basically a duplicate of your other question here:\nHow to copy all bytes of a phone (formatted or not, 64GB/64B) into a computer hard drive?\nwhere I detailed in lengths why it is not practically possible.\nIt being practically impossible has nothing todo with snapshots, disassembly of the device or how solid state storage differs from tape or hard drive storage.\nIt is all entirely down to the fact that the data was encrypted with the AES-256 encryption algorithm using a key derived from information that was previously stored exclusively within the Secure Enclave in that phone - and now gone. There's no practical way of getting that key from the Secure Enclave now, and there's no practical way of breaking the encryption with the key gone.\nThe data is lost for you.\nJust to answer your previous counter-arguments from the older question:\n\n*\n\n*No, that newer and faster computers are released every year will not change the fact that the data is lost.\n\n\n*No, that you have 1000 years of time on your hands for brute forcing will not change the fact that the data is lost.\n\n\n*No, that you have access to \"Apple coders\" with \"secret information\" about the encryption will not change the fact that the data is lost.\n\n\n*No, even IT-professionals will not be able to get your data back from that data storage on the phone.\nYour only realistic way to get your data back is to hope you have a backup somewhere. Look for old backups, old revisions of data stored in iCloud, perhaps you've sent the note via text to somebody else earlier - things like that. From your descriptions, I would take a closer look at older iCloud backups of your phone, as well as look at iCloud.com to see if your Note should be synchronized there afterall.\nThere's also the theoretical possibility that we covered on the other question - namely that you suddenly make a world-class break through in the state of code breaking and find a major weakness in the AES-algorithm that allows you to decrypt the encrypted data quickly without having the key. In that case, you would probably be able to make so much money and fame off of having that new insight that you wouldn't be thinking about recovering data from your decades old iPhone at that point.\nIn addition, there's a theoretical possibility that it is later discovered that Apple is using weakened encryption - for example due to being strong-armed in to doing so by the US government. If that is revealed in years to come, then it might so happen that someone figures out how to break that weakened encryption in a practical timeframe. I would discount this as being a very theoretical possibility. It is not practical.

Is there a nice way of doing this?

You won't be able to use an app to edit the file, though.\n", "Q: How do you load and start a launchd job without using a plist file? The manual page for launchctl mentions that the load and unload subcommands are legacy subcommands, which implies that they're no longer needed for loading and starting a launchd job.\nHowever, I'm not aware of any way to actually define a launchd job and its properties and then load it for the first time without using a plist file and passing it in to the load subcommand.\nDoes launchctl offer a way of defining and loading a job using its other subcommands? If so, how does that work?\n\nA: Yes, it does offer such a way - and actually it's stated in the manual just below where it says that the others are legacy.\nSo to quote the man page for launchctl in the section for legacy subcommands - for the subcommands load and unload it says:\n\nRecommended alternative subcommands: bootstrap | bootout | enable |\ndisable\n\nSo those are the newer subcommands, you want to look at.\nHere's a few examples:\nBefore if you used load like this:\nlaunchctl load my.plist\n\nYou'll now write one of these:\nsudo launchctl bootstrap system my.plist\nlaunchctl bootstrap user/$(id -u) my.plist\nlaunchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) my.plist\n\nThe difference being that you now have to specify the domain target. The difference here is that system means that it going to be a system daemon that runs as the super user, compared to user meaning that it will run as the given user, and gui meaning that it will run as the given user, but only be active when the user is logged in to the graphical user interface. There's also a session and pid target domain if you have more advanced needs.\nThe $(id -u) is basically just a short hand for finding your own user's id. You can run id -u in the Terminal to get it if you do not know it, and then you can just specificy it manually like for example so:\nlaunchctl bootstrap gui/501 my.plist\n\nThe replacement for unload is quite similar:\nsudo launchctl bootout system my.plist\nlaunchctl bootout user/$(id -u) my.plist\nlaunchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) my.plist\n\nSo the above covers how to move away from the legacy subcommands to the recommended subcommands instead.\nThe second part of your question is whether you can do this without using a plist file. The answer is no. The bootstrap subcommand requires you to specify a service-path, which can be either a plist, a XPC service bundle - or a directory of either of those. XPC service bundle are used by application developers, but they also include a plist file - so going that route is not going to save you from having a plist file.\nYou can of course do various sorts of work-arounds with scripts or utility programs so that you do not need to manually create and maintain plist files. You could even use for example a named pipe to avoid having to actually store the contents of the plist file on disk, but I cannot see the practical benefit of that.\n", "Q: How do you make the x-value of a Numbers graph start with a number that is not 0 The simple question is, how do you make the x-value of a Numbers graph start with a number that is not 0. The x-axis of my graph is time, and it starts with 30 seconds, but the graph that numbers created starts with 0 seconds, which creates a large gap between x=0 and x=30. How could I remove that gap?\n\nA: You can set the minimum and maximum values the x-axis can take in a 2D scatter chart in Numbers. Just select the chart and change the Scale options in Format > Axis > Value (X) sidebar as per necessary as shown in the example below.

In the first row in Numbers sheet I would like to show all the days of a couple of months in this format (the same format as the date in macOS top panel):\n| Fri 1 Apr | Sat 2 Apr | Sun 3 Apr | ...\n\nSo, I tried to select the first three cells and then click on the yellow dot in the middle on the vertical side of the cell and drag it to the right. However, this was the result:\n| Fri 1 Apr | Sat 2 Apr | Sun 3 Apr |  Fri 1 Apr | Sat 2 Apr | Sun 3 Apr | ...\n\nSo, the sequence repeats and it doesn't do what I want, meaning:\n | Fri 1 Apr | Sat 2 Apr | Sun 3 Apr | Mon 4 Apr | Tue 5 Apr | Wed 6 Apr | ...\n\nAny idea how to achieve it instead of just repeating the selected sequence?\n\nA: I reckon the problem you are having with Autofill is that the initial cells you are entering manually are being recognized as text rather than dates by Numbers.\nTo see if my estimate is correct, I suggest you select the first date you have entered manually and check what Numbers show at the bottom left of the screen. I expect, in your case, it says \"Text Fri 1 Apr\" for the corresponding cell. This means Numbers is recognizing the \"Fri 1 Apr\" you have entered as text rather than a date as also shown below.\n\nTo resolve this, the initial dates you are entering manually should be in a form that Numbers can automatically recognize as dates. For example, enter \"1 Apr 2022\" manually as the first date. Then Numbers would automatically recognize this as a date rather than text and show \"Actual 01.04.2022 00:00:00\" at the bottom left (or \"Actual 04.01.2022 00:00:00\" if your macOS region settings are for US/UK). Next, you can enter \"2 Apr 2022\" into the next cell and then use the autofill to fill the rest of the cells as needed.\n\nYou may note at this point, while the autofill might be working correctly with this procedure, the dates in your own table are not formatted as you originally intended in your question and also unlike those in the table I gave as an example above. To get that date format, you need to use the \"Custom Format\" option available through the sidebar menu in Format > Cell > Data Format as shown in the  picture below. You can learn more about custom date formats in Numbers under the \"Create a custom date and time format\" section in the \"Create a custom cell format in Numbers on Mac\" Apple Numbers support webpage if you like.\n\nThe autofill should take care of the formatting for the rest of the dates it creates, but, in case you need to copy the custom format you have created onto other cells, you can use Format -> Copy Style and Format -> Paste Style  commands available in the Numbers menu at the top.\nIn case you work with dates & durations frequently while using Numbers, I suggest you watch the nine-minute video titled \"Calculations With Time and Duration Values In Numbers\" by macmost.com.\n", "Q: Universal Control top/bottom instead of left/right When I use Universal Control, I can swipe to the right or left side of my screen, and it moves the cursor to my iPad. Is there a way to do the same thing with the top/bottom of my screen?\nRight now my iPad is below my desktop monitor, so it would make more sense if the mouse moved between the screens via top/bottom edges rather than left/right.\n\nA: One way to do this is to initially set it up via the right/left, then go to System > Displays and rearrange the screen so it's top/bottom.\nI don't think there's a way to do this without the extra step, since according to Apple, this is expected behavior:\n\nUse your mouse or trackpad to move the cursor past the left or right edge of your screen in the general direction of the iPad or other Mac, even if the other device is positioned below your screen.

However after expanding and going back a few times when I double click on a thumbnail nothing happens. Well the cursor switches from the pointer to a hand so you can drag the map.\nHow do I reliably get from the Places album to the grid view.\n\nA: The issue is that whenever I click the mouse is not totally still.\nThus if I click once it starts a click and drag.\nIf I go through contortions to make the mouse totally still then I do get the places expanding.\nThis is a real accessibility problem,\n\nA: Double click zooms, single click is enough.\n", "Q: TrialArchivingService is this a new process or is it malware? Found this new process TrialArchivingService that was using a lot of cpu. It was started by user. Has anyone else seen this process.

In fact, triald is running on my computer right now.\nIt's not exactly obvious what the process does, but it most likely has to do with Siri (based on what I found at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253760894?page=2). If you have Siri enabled, try turning it off for a couple of days and see if that fixes the issue. Likewise, if you have Siri off, try turning it on for a couple of days and see if that fixes the issue. After changing your Siri settings, you can delete your Siri history via system preferences (System Preferences > Siri > Delete Siri & Dictation History) to make TrialArchivingService take up less CPU.\nIf disk space is becoming a problem, or turning Siri on/off doesn't help reduce TrialArchivingService/triald's activity, try these steps from https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253760894?page=2 (edited for clarity):\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Safe Mode. Run Activity Monitor and kill any processes that contain the word \"trial.\"\n\n*Immediately open Finder. Navigate to the  ~/Library/ folder by using Shift-Command-G and typing in ~/Library/. Move the \"trial\" folder to the trash, and empty the trash.\n\n*Reboot normally (out of Safe Mode), and the trial folder in ~/Library/ will be re-created, taking up much less disk space.\n\nRegardless of what exactly this process is for, it is a legitimate pre-installed Apple program and isn't malware, so no need to worry there!

Thank you.\n\nA: Alright I finally figured it out after some research.\nPreviously I had Cisco AnyConnect installed and apparently that causes issues on macOS Monterey.\nI just had my internet stop working, so I uninstalled AnyConnect – and my browsers magically became able to connect to websites again :)\n", "Q: Missing Courier font on Terminal macOS Monterey I recently got a new laptop, opened up Terminal and noticed that the Courier font is missing entirely!\nIs there a way to get this font installed into Terminal?\nThanks!\n\nA: In recent years, Apple seems to have 'hidden' a number of System fonts from font menus, even though they are active. This includes Athelas, Marion, Iowan Old Style, and others.\nYou cannot just copy the font to the /Library or user ~/Library font folders: it will still be hidden from font menus.\nThese are all .ttc \"TrueType Collection\" fonts, which contain multiple styles in one file. If you have access to a font editor (such as FontForge, FontLab, Glyphs, etc), you can open the TTC file, and re-save each style as a separate .ttf font file.\nThese files, when installed, will be seen be font menus.\nAlternatively, you can install the .dfont file from Catalina or earlier, if you have access to it. Though Apple has been migrating bundled fonts away from the proprietary .dfont format for many years, and may abandon it entirely at some point.\n\nA: I was able to install the regular Courier font by downloading the .ttf font file from here:\nhttps://ttfonts.net/font/11165_Courier.htm\nand then copying it into my ~/Library/Fonts/ directory. It can be seen in \"All Fonts\" (not sure how to get it classified as fixed width).\n\nA: Courier is available in the \"PDF\" collection.\n\nThe fonts in that collection don't show up in the \"English\" or \"All fonts\" collection. You won't find Helvetica or Times in any other collections either.\nThinking that Courier was \"disabled,\" I opened the Font Book application to take a look at the font collections. Inexplicably, Courier doesn't appear in the PDF collection in Font Book, and it didn't show up in a search either. Odd, to say the least.\n", "Q: Activity monitor style way to see Neural Engine load? The question is all in the title. Here is the background.\nI am using an M1 mini with 8 GB of RAM, which is barely functional when I have voice control switched on, due to memory usage frequently going into the red zone in activity monitor.\nIt would be nice if Apple were able to provide guidance of system requirements and performance for various features within accessibility. However my message to accessibility@apple.com got the response that Apple do not provide this kind of information.\nSo I need to invest in a more powerful Mac (this one had a lifespan of about six months) because voice control is a must have for me. I'm not very keen on spending £1100 on another Mac mini (this would be simply be an 8 GB RAM upgrade, at approx 50 times the price of 8gb of ram), because that might turn out to be a short lived investment also, given apple's lack of information on the hardware which voice control really needs.\nI noticed that the M1 ultra in the new Mac Studio has 32 NPU's.\nAll of apples other devices, newer iphones, M1, M1 pro, M1 Max, have 16 NPUs.\nThe complete inadequacy of 8 GB of RAM is obvious, so I'm minded to get as much ram as I possibly can afford, but I'd love to know if there's a way to answer the question which Apple says it cannot answer - given my workflow of Head Pointer (an accessibility feature a few people are aware of - it uses the WebCam so that small movements of the head move the mouse pointer), plus full voice control (dictation plus commands), I would really like to know if when I am running both of these things, what is the load on the 16 core NPU. Hence, how much if at all is the Ultra going to help in this regard.\nWithout a way to see NPU load, knowing what hardware I actually need seems to require guesswork.\n\nA few updates\n\n*\n\n*in activity monitor under the CPU tab, there's a GPU load column.\n\n*speech recognition with voice control on on my M1 8 GB shows between 30 and 40% GPU load from speech recognition core.\n\n*yet, usually after the Mac hasn't been rebooted for a couple of days, there's a voice recognition delay for both dictation and commands of up to 5 seconds (very slow compared to when it's working well).\n\n*so it's not clear if this lag is due to ram being in the yellow zone, which it is, or something else.\n\n*it seems pretty likely to me that this code is still being optimised for apple silicon and may improve in future os updates from Apple (without any fanfair).\n\n*the actual dropout of dictation, seems not to occur with the latest update to Monterey\n\nFurther update\n\n*\n\n*it appears that at the current time, voice recognition isn't even using the NE. Evidence: gpu load in activity monitor - either NE load is shown as gpu load, or, seems more likely, the NE is a new thing and voice rec has been built to use gpu, and is still using it because the code hasn't been changed, as yet. If it will be or when, haven't found any information on this. Perhaps head pointer does use NE though.\n\n\nA: You seem to consider that the money you've spent on the M1 Mac was lost. Remember that you got 6 months of service out of it - and it can be resold. You would likely be able to recoup a significant part of your investment there.\nFor the replacement Mac I would definitely go with one with more RAM. The number of NPUs is not important, as the accessibility features you have mentioned, do not benefit from extra NPUs. So I definitely wouldn't buy an M1 Ultra Mac Studio just for that purpose (note that I think the M1 Ultra Mac Studio is a really good computer in its right, so if you have other needs for it, definitely consider it).\n", "Q: How to permanently disable mouse acceleration (MacOS Monterey) I upgraded from MacOS Catalina straight to Monterey. In Monterey or Big Sur, Apple seem to have introduced an aggressive mouse acceleration function.\ni.e.: Acceleration in moving the mouse cursor (not referring to scrolling).\nI am able to temporarily get rid of the mouse acceleration, by entering the below command into Terminal and then rebooting (or potentially logging out and in, though that has been unreliable at times):\ndefaults write -g com.apple.mouse.scaling -integer -1\n\nHowever, this setting is not permanent and seems to get lost on reboot or shut down (potentially also at idling, sleep or logout – I have not investigated thoroughly).\nHow can I make this setting permanent?\n\nPlease note: Preferably, I want to make the setting permanent inside of native MacOS settings, or some \"light software\" like a script, rather than relying on heavy external software. I have seen people suggest e.g. LinearMouse or CursorSense which have settings for disabling mouse acceleration – but when trying them, unfortunately because they also handle other mouse-related functions, it seems to tend to interact negatively with other mouse software (making the cursor movements \"choppy\") and even Universal Control. I am still interested in hearing your suggestions on third-party software – but optimally the answer to my question should be how to permanently disable mouse acceleration in the Apple native preference files, or similar.\n\nA: I was able to disable it on startup by creating the following launchd configuration and placing it in the /Library/LaunchDaemons folder (named it com.ryan.disablemouseacceleration)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.ryan.disablemouseacceleration</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/bin/defaults</string>\n        <string>write</string>\n        <string>.GlobalPreferences</string>\n        <string>com.apple.mouse.scaling</string>\n        <string>-1</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <false/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: This looks like a good piece of free software to do what you're looking for: https://triq.net/mac/mouse-acceleration\nIt basically only does this, it's a simple preference pane.\n", "Q: `/tmp/` is filled with numbered empty files over time (`0000000011xxxxxx`) On my MBP, /tmp/ fills up with empty files named 0000000011608c4c, 0000000011944a47 etc. They're owned by root:wheel and a lot of them are created at once at seemingly random times:\n$ ls -ltr /tmp/0000000011* \n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 09:23 /tmp/0000000011608c4c\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:37 /tmp/0000000011944a47\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:37 /tmp/000000001194c736\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:37 /tmp/000000001195b0a4\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:37 /tmp/000000001196abea\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:37 /tmp/000000001197cd67\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:38 /tmp/0000000011990882\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:38 /tmp/00000000119a2aba\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:38 /tmp/00000000119a962d\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:38 /tmp/00000000119b1c91\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:38 /tmp/00000000119bc041\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:38 /tmp/00000000119c905a\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:38 /tmp/00000000119da295\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:38 /tmp/00000000119f4737\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 29 21:38 /tmp/0000000011a1b60e\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 30 12:07 /tmp/0000000011bd9959\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 30 12:07 /tmp/0000000011be0f55\n-rw------- 1 root wheel 0 Mar 30 12:07 /tmp/0000000011be9f57\n...\n\nHow can I find out what might cause this?\n\nA: You can use lsof to list open files by their command and process id, and then look them up in Activity Monitor if the name is too long for the column.\nSince these are owned by root somehow, you might try the command sudo lsof | grep /tmp.\nThis uses the super user account to list all open files and selectively filter the stream for '/tmp' using the grep command.\n", "Q: How can I connect iMac as external monitor?

I remember reading that one shouldn't store files on the desktop. I don't remember what the reason was. Something to do with the Finder treating files on the desktop differently. The advice given was to store files in the documents folder.\nI'm not looking for anecdotes (\"I never had problems!\"), but a technical explanation for why this might be a problem or why it cannot be a problem.\n\nA: Simple answer: no, not really, not unless you have hundreds or thousands of files on the Desktop.\nIt can be really, really hard to navigate a Desktop chock-full of icons, though:\n\nBut there is one thing to consider - Quick Look processing & RAM usage.\n\nQuick Look allows you to select an item and preview it with a quick tap of the spacebar. There are many different file types supported, from MP3 and AAC to JPEG and MP4.\nWhile Quick Look is a fantastic tool to have, it will be your enemy if you keep Pages or Word documents, images, videos, music with artwork, and anything else it supports previewing on the Desktop.\nThe tool is always ready with previews, so when you have a lot of documents on the Desktop, all those previews will have to be temporarily stored in the RAM. This means your Mac can become extremely slow.\"\n\n(I lifted the bulk of this answer from this link.)\nOn older Macs with limited RAM, this can become a huge problem. On newer Macs with much larger RAM availability, it may be less of a problem.\nBut this doesn't mean you should leave hundreds or thousands of files on the Desktop.\nPersonally, I download files to the Desktop, then move them elsewhere when needed. Files like disk images (.dmg) or archives (.zip) are better handled (IMHO) from the Desktop because the don't usually stay there when done.\n\nA: The issue was that the WindowServer treated each icon on the Desktop as a Window object. This design harked back to the original Classic Mac OS.\nThis meant that file icons on the Desktop used more RAM than files within a Finder window.\nHowever, changes to the Finder and the WindowServer in recent years have reduced this problem, while better hardware has also minimized the effect.\n\nAlthough large numbers of files on the Desktop may not affect the performance of the computer, they certainly affect the performance of the user!\n", "Q: SSH Issue: kex_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer MacBook Pro 15\" 2018, 32G RAM, OS 12.3\nLast week I was trying to connect a PHP script to a database on my web host via SSH, and ran the following script:\n<?php\n  shell_exec(\"ssh -f -L 3307:127.0.0.1:3306 username@00.000.000.00 sleep 60 >> logfile\");\n  $db = mysqli_connect('127.0.0.1', 'db_user', 'db_pass', 'test_ssh', 3307);\n  if (!$db) {\n    die(\"DB connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n  } else {\n    echo \"Successfully connected!\";\n  }\n?>\n\nAfter that, I cannot SSH (or SFTP) into the web host account.

I see a couple different lines in the verbose output that could be it, but I'm not sure so I don't know where to concentrate my efforts. My next step is re-imaging the laptop.\n\nA: Just to clear off a few things from your list first:\n\n*\n\n*There's no way your PHP script had anything to do with this. It is entirely by coincidence that you ran that first and then something else happened.\n\n\n*Your WiFi logs have nothing to do with this. The message you have found from launchd is about \"sshd\", not \"ssh\". So it doesn't have anything to do with your problem.\n\n\n*Looking at netstat for listening sockets on your Mac has nothing to do with your problem. There's no need for that as no listening sockets on your Mac are involved in connecting to a remote server. You would not be able to diagnose anything here.\n\n\n*Similarly for lsof. It has nothing to do with your problem, and you wouldn't be able to learn anything from its output regarding this problem.\n\n\n*Reloading ssh.plist and restarting SSH hasn't got anything to do with your problem. Those are used for when you want to be able to connect remotely to your Mac - not when wanting to connect to a remote server from your Mac.\n\n\n*Reinstalling the operating system, disabling IPv6, and reimaging the laptop is really not applicable here. You do not need to these things.\n\n\n*Killing PID 1 - I have no idea where you got this idea from. It won't help you in any way - it will essentially crash your computer by stopping all programs.\nNow on to your actual problem:\nAs far as I understand you're saying that you have key files on this computer. They have the correct permissions - and it \"used to work\". You're unclear about when it used to work.\nYou're also saying that if you copy those exact same key files to another computer with an older version of macOS - it just works.\nYour output from ssh indicates that the server rejected your connection.\nIf it is correct that you have the right key files and the correct permissions on them - then it sounds like you have a version incompatibility problem on your hands. Basically newer versions of OpenSSH disable old and known insecure parts of the protocol - whereas old servers do not know about newer functionality. That could lead you to a situation where you cannot connect.\nI would inspect the SSH log on the server and check that you are indeed running a recent version of sshd there.\nIt could also be that case that your server (or something between you and your server) is inspecting traffic (for security purposes) and dropping connections. For example some systems will block connections from IP-addresses that has unsuccessfully tried to connect for a specific number of times. Try again with the same computer on a different Internet connection (for example connect to a hotspot made by your phone).\n\nA: I had a similar problem recently on my Mac mini. Turns out if my network connection is over wi-fi I get this error. If I connect over ethernet connection, ssh works. Since you are on a Macbook I presume you are trying to ssh in over a wi-fi connection and it seems that is not possible on a Mac.\n", "Q: How to connect a USB-C drive to an iMac with Thunderbolt ports I have iMac 27\" late 2014, running 10.14.6 OS.

The dock then supplies the power to the drive. Thunderbolt 3 docks are easier to find over Thunderbolt 1 and Thunderbolt 2 docks. You can connect the Thunderbolt 3 dock to the Mac using Apple's Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter.\nFor example, OWC offers an Thunderbolt 3 Dock. The webpage explicitly states the dock can be used with a Thunderbolt 2 port via Apple's adaptor.\n\nAn alternative would be to plug a Samsung T7 (or equivalent) in to an existing USB Type A port. (A Samsung T5 is cheaper and should have about the same performance when used with your Mac.) This alternative would be slower, but does not require any additional cables, hubs or adaptors.\n", "Q: How to prevent Xcode from trying to prepare my Apple Watch for development?

How can I do this in the terminal or using AppleScript?\n\nA: There is an answer to this question over here. I have removed some things from that answer but it can be summed up as this.\nCreate a new bash script (I am going to call it openpage - no file extension) somewhere in your $PATH with this text:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [[ -z $2 ]]; then\n    [[ -z $1 ]] && printf \"\\n Missing the filename.\"\n    printf \"\\n Missing the page number.\\n\\n\"\n    printf \"   Syntax: openpage file page_number\\n\"\n    exit 1\nelse\n    open -a Preview \"$1\"\n    sleep .5\n    osascript -e 'tell application \"Preview\" to activate' \\\n              -e 'delay 0.1' \\\n              -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Preview\" to click menu item \"Go to Page…\" of menu \"Go\" of menu bar 1' \\\n              -e 'delay 0.1' \\\n              -e \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to keystroke \\\"$2\\\"\" \\\n              -e 'delay 0.1' \\\n              -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to key code 36'\nfi\nexit 0\n\nOnce that is done make sure it is executable with chmod +x <filename> and run it like openpage my_file.pdf 194\n", "Q: Google Chrome fails to start with error: \"Cannot Open. Cannot reach Citrix Workspace.\" Google Chrome fails to load on Mac OS, with the following error:\n\nIt says:\nCannot open. Cannot reach Citrix Workspace.\n\nAnd there is a floating loading windowlet underneath, with a spinner that says:\nStarting Google Chrome...\n\nAnd it has a Cancel button.\nI used to have Citrix Workspace from working with a client, which is a shitty VPN thing that nobody should ever use. It has since been deleted, but it looks like I'll have to do some digging to rip it out completely.\nDoes anyone have an idea for how to fix this?\n\nA: I had two versions of Google Chrome installed on my system, and Spotlight was defaulting to opening the crappy Citrix-infected one, so I just deleted it.\n", "Q: Change the duration of \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\" In general, the \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\" function is very helpful to extend the hard drive's lifespan, but in large, it becomes a problem.\nDue to how hard drives work, if you put a hard drive near you on the desk in a quiet room, you would be able to hear that sound.\nThe problem is that I've discovered that the OS puts the hard drive to sleep far too frequently; for example, when I close the finder or any app that relies on reading a file from the hard drive, it only waits about 2 seconds before shutting down the hard drive.\nThis has caused a lot of lag whenever an application tries to read files on a hard drive and has to wait for a prolonged 2-3 seconds for the disk to spin up, and then as soon as the reading/writing ended, the hard drive shut off immediately.\nIs there anyway to change the waiting time for the hard drive to rest? Let's say after 600 seconds of idle, the hard drive may go into sleep.\n\nA: In the terminal, look at the options for the command line tool pmset.\nFrom the manual (man pmset) the key is disksleep with a number of minutes and there are other settings available.\nFor your example, the command would be sudo pmset disksleep 10.\n", "Q: Sending custom requests through iCloud private relay I'm asking myself if it is possible to send custom requests (including custom headers) via the iCloud private relay, as I could do it with a normal VPN ?\nIf not, is there any program made to send custom requests from safari such as chromedriver does with chrome, in the goal to pass by the private relay ?\n\nA: In beta - iCloud Private Relay is transparent and offers no configuration options. What differentiates Apple’s offering from the others I have evaluated is there are two levels of indirection where Apple would hopefully strip away custom requests by design.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614\nThe technical / developer level details how it uses UDP / QUIC are also documented online:\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/support/prepare-your-network-for-icloud-private-relay/\nPerhaps if you explained your end goal in using custom headers, we could elaborate more.\n", "Q: What are the various ways I can stop getting iMessage spam notifications on my desktop besides turning off iMessages on my iPhone? I just got a desktop notification on my MacBook that seems like spam. This is remarkable because I've never got a notification from anything other than my macOS notification before. I don't use non-OS notifications and don't want them.\nViewing in messages it is a \"stock tip\" in a foreign language and says:\n\niMessage with xxxxx@hotmail.com\n\nwhere \"xxxxxx\" is a placeholder.\nA few months ago I'd sent a single iMessage by accident on my iPhone (not my laptop), I'd forgotten to turn it off after getting a new iPhone. I don't want to debate my personal preferences here, but I would like to know if turning off iMessage is the only way to block spam notifications like this. (I will turn of iMessage irregardless)\nnotes:\n\n*\n\n*I have BlueTooth turned on because of my Apple Watch and my phone is also connected via USB to my laptop for hotspotting.\n\n*The message shows up in Messages on my iPhone as well, but for some reason there was no new message notification that I could see in the phone.\n\n*I do not have iMessages on my laptop (as far as I know)\n\n*iOS 15.3.1 and macOS 10.15.7\n\n\nFor background:\n\n*\n\n*When does Messages message via iMessage vs. SMS?\n\n*How can I ensure or force a message I'm composing to go via SMS on my iPhone 6 in iOS 12?\n\n*Stop my iPhone from receiving screen shots and other images sent via SMS?\n\n*How to report spam that appeared in Messages on iPhone marked \"Text Message\" & thus sent via carrier (e.g. AT&T) NOT Apple, & NOT from a phone #? \"This kind of thing is almost impossible to block because, as you pointed out, the e-mail address is almost always forged. I have hundreds of e-mails blocked on my account...\"\n\n\nA: If you would like to turn off all notifications for Messages.app, you can do so in System Preferences - Notifications & Focus - Messages. Turn off \"Allow Notifications.\"\nYour phone may have nothing to do with this - one can send an iMessage (which is distinct from an EMail) to an Email address. You can check the locations that Messages.app (on your Mac) is \"listening\" on within Messages.app preferences, in the iMessage tab, and adjust these as needed to help stop the spam messages from coming through.\n", "Q: Sometimes my MacBook Pro wont boot at all I have a 2015 15\" MacBook Pro with specs below\n\nLately my Mac wont wakeup from sleep and I have to force shutdown it.

Any idea why this keeps happening?\n\nA: There are two possibilities: a software problem, or a hardware problem.\nFirst, you need to identify or rule out software problems. Check that all third-party software, particularly things that run Launch Agents or Launch Demons in the background, are compatible and up-to-date.\nI recommend EtreCheck as a useful utility that will give you a useful report of things installed on your Mac that may have an effect on normal operation.\nYou can test whether the problem occurs when in Safe Boot mode.\nYou can also test whether the problem occurs in a brand new user account: if things work properly, then you know that the cause is something configured or launched in your original user account.\nYou can also test booting from a clean OS, on an external disk. If that also exhibits the problem, then that would point more towards a hardware problem.\n", "Q: What would cause the following error: 'Eject \"Apple SSD - Data\" before disconnecting or turning it off' I just saw the message below on my 2015 MacBook Pro running macOS 12.2.1.

I follow steps 4, 7 and 8 (I think...) here for a Macbook Pro 13 Late 2013 in order to sell it. I would like to know if my security is compromise for not doing steps 5, 6 and possibly 8. Asking since the buyer just reached out asking for the password to unlock the disk () and I gave it to him since I thought it was needed for him to use the computer.\nAdditional questions may be: Can he access my iMessage? Can he access the data I had?\nSorry if I'm being paranoid and just asking stupid questions. Dealing with this is hard for my anxiety.\n\nA: That looks like a FileVault password to un-encrypt the disk.\nIf you erased the disk before you sold it, then you should be fine.\nHowever, I would recommend that you tell the buyer to wipe the disk in Recovery mode and reinstall the OS. Then they can configure the security and passwords as they want, and satisfy themselves that they have a 'clean' OS.\n", "Q: How to create a URL link in Numbers from a CSV file I have a CSV file that I open in Numbers, I need one of the cells to be a URL clickable link though, and in the CSV file if I use something like this, it does not turn into a clickable link in Numbers:\n=HYPERLINK(\"https://www.apple.com\",\"Apple\")\n\nIf I type in the above in a cell in the Numbers app, then it automatically turns into a clickable link with the words \"Apple\".\nI am guessing if Numbers opens a CSV file, it does not support functions such as =HYPERLINK. Perhaps it has to be a Numbers formatted file for it to support functions?\nIs there a way to \"ask\" Numbers to open a CSV file in Numbers format so that it can understand the HYPERLINK function?\n\nA: You can (partially) resolve this problem by telling Numbers how to interpret a text file right after the file is opened by Numbers as also described in the \"Import an Excel or text file into Numbers on Mac\" Apple Numbers support webpage. I call this a partial solution because it requires the manual intervention described below every time you open the text file with Numbers.\nWhen Numbers opens a text file, it automatically breaks down each line into separate cells based on the default delimiter such as a comma. You can change the delimiter or have Numbers assume there are no delimiters within a line using the options in the \"Import Settings\" window. You can get to that window either through the pop-up window that appears right after a text file is opened (first picture below) or through the Format > Table > Adjust Import Settings sidebar menu option (second picture below). Note that the pop-up window opening right after the text file is opened disappears after a few seconds and the one available through the sidebar also disappears once you make any changes to the opened file.\n\n\nAfter getting into the Import Settings window, click on the  delimiter selected by default (default delimiter is comma if your macOS regional settings are set as US or UK) to deselect it and then click on Update Table as shown in the GIF below.\n\n", "Q: pkg installer error in macOS 12.3: rights in /Library/Application Support Are there any changes in the rights of the folder /Library/Application Support starting with macOS 12.3?\nOur application refuses to install, our postinstall script fails to create a folder (and files in it) in /Library/Application Support.\nOur installer-gui-script specifies auth=\"Root\" and our postinstall script (postflight python) triggers this: os.system('mkdir /Library/Application\\ Support/***')\nI don't find anything about this in the release change log for macOS 12.3.

Lords Mobile app was purchased with an old AppleID. Would the game data be lost if I re-purchase the app using a new AppleID?\n\nA: Possibly, yes.\nIt depends on how the app stores data, which can either be locally to the installation, in the game company's server, in iCloud Disk, or in iCloud Data (or furthmore in GameCenter's APIs for game data which are variations of the previous).\nStored on the game's server\nIf you created a login for the game, odds are your progress is stored on their server and you might be able to test by downloading the game on a second device and see if if your progress is maintained.\nUsually, Gems or other \"premium\" currencies that you paid for with real-world money are not transferable between OSs (Gems bought on Android do not transfer to an iPhone, and vice versa).\niCloud\nIf you use separate AppleIDs for your iCloud and App/iTunes Store logins, then app data might well be already in your expected iCloud storage.\nOffloading Apps\nIf you utilize the \"offload app\" feature mentioned in the comment by Ihf, then you stand a little safer, as the local data should not be removed, only the application data. Go to the Settings App > iPhone/iPad Storage then either enable the global Offload Unused Apps or scroll down the list and \"offload\" the specific app you want to save space from.\nNote, because this usually only removes the application and not cached data, if your game utilizes a download phase before you play it (like when your first downloaded the app, and then again when they update content) then you may not see much storage space freed up by this method, since your device is retaining local files.\nPay attention to an app's \"App Size\" vs it's \"Documents & Data\" in the Offload settings list. Garage Band on my iPhone consumes over 3GB, 1.5GB in the App, and 1.8GB in Documents and Data. Offloading would only free up the 1.5GB of the App itself.\nAlso note, the global \"Offload Unused Apps\" feature might be a little to aggresive for some needs. I've had some apps I use daily or weekly get swept into the list to be offloaded, and you need to have access to the internet in order to relaunch them after being offloaded, since in effect you need to re-download them from the AppStore (albeit, without having to launch the AppStore).\nOffloaded apps will display a cloud download icon in their name on the home-screen so you can see at a glance which ones have been removed to free up space.\n", "Q: Shortcut to switch to a given input source Is there a way to create a keyboard shortcut for each individual input source, so that I can pick whichever input source I want, simply using the keyboard, without having to scroll through a whole list of them?

All the metadata is the same, and they actually both point to the same file.  (Not to a \"file.mp3\" and a separate \"file 1.mp3\")\nI'd like a way to automate removal of one of every such entry without deleting the actual file.  Currently, all I know is Get Info on both (to verify File is the same), then delete, confirm, and click Keep File.\n\nA: I've been suffering the same issues lately, stemming from a patchy import of my files into a new Music library on a new MBP (Monterey 12.5 on M1). Before you ask I did not have an existing library in any fit state to import, so I have been piecing together my collection from multiple sources. I've been several years away from Macs as a daily machine.\nDuring the troubleshooting phase I've found (so far) the following 3 scenarios for duplicate entries in the Music database. Now, let me mention I am also using iTunes Match which also does some weird things with files and database entries! YMMV.\nPossible Scenarios\n\n*\n\n*Duplicate entries with identical metadata but each entry points to a different file eg. 01 song.m4a and 01 song 1.m4a. This appears to be the result of the same source file being imported twice. This is the scenario you are excluding in the question, but I am including here for completeness.\n\n\n*What appear to be duplicate entries at first glance based on metadata in the song or album views, but when the metadata is examined Cmd-I you find that the entries point to different files, and the metadata is different because characters unsupported in filenames has been used to populate the tags. E.g. an apostrophe may be translated into an underscore. In that situation Music is clever enough to re-translate it to an apostrophe for display. This is quite a common issue, but tricky to spot.\n\n\n*Duplicate entries that seem to be caused by some sort of hiccup. The metadata is identical and both entries point to the same file. This fits the bill for your question, and is the one most troubling for me. Oddly the duplicate usually only appears in Song view, not in Album view.\nPotential Solutions\n\n*\n\n*Dupes with different filenames.\nI've used two methods:\n\n*\n\n*Get Info (Cmd-I) each entry to identify the rogue filename and delete. Note, I have found in this scenario Music gives you the option to either Bin or Keep the file. I find this behaviour rather strange, as if you try to delete any other track that is not duplicated, it does not offer to keep a track.\n\n\n*Use a utility like Dupin to identify duplicates. You will be able to see the differences in the filenames without the laborious progress. Dupin will also be useful to identify the other scenarios also, but with some caveats I'll deal with in part 3.\n\n\n\n\n*Duplicate entries with strange metadata conversions.\nThese can be dealt with the same as scenario 1, but with emphasis on checking the metadata and filenames carefully.\n\n\n*Duplicate metadata and filenames\n(Finally I'm getting round to answering the question!) These are tricky. I have had a different, and more disturbing experience than you have when picking an entry and deleting. For me the delete did not offer Bin or Keep. When one entry is deleted, the remaining entry now points to the file in the Bin. This is a sure fire way to lose files when you blithely empty the Bin later.\nDupin will recognise this scenario and at first will look like it is dealing with it, but later in the workflow it will identify the double reference to the same file and recommend manual intervention for a 'highly unusual' situation. However it will still create a deletion playlist with one of the entries, though it shouldn't.\nThere are three ways to manually deal with this scenario. I don't think there is any way of safely automating this without a lot of testing:\n\n*\n\n*If you have mistakenly consigned the file to the Bin, recover it to another location (do not Put Back). Delete the remaining database entry, and then re-import the file from your temporary location.\n\n\n*For one of the duplicate entries, Right-click and Show In Finder. Copy to a temporary location. Delete both database entries and then re-import from the temp.\n\n\n*If you are using iTunes Match, and your files are Matched or Uploaded:\n\n*\n\n*Delete one of the duplicate entries (and allow the file to go to the Bin, that may be the only choice - like I said I don't get the option to Keep in this scenario).\n\n*On the remaining entry, right-click and Remove Download\n\n*Right-click and Download to re-add the local file.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's disappointing to see that database management is still no further improved in Music compared to the problems I used to have in iTunes years ago. There are no consistent options to add or remove entries; there is little feedback in the import process; there seems to be some problem that allows scenario 3 to occur quite easily; there is no effort to prevent duplicate entries on import, be they by filename or metadata. The duplicate checks found in File | Library | Show Duplicate Items can find them well, enough, but you still have to be aware of all the above scenarios and solutions when dealing with its results.\nOf course, it goes without saying to have a solid, tested backup...\n", "Q: Portable USB-C Monitor locks up 16\" Macbook Pro 2019 I just bought a small portable 1080p 14\" USB-C Monitor to use with my 2019 16\" Macbook Pro: https://www.amazon.de/ARZOPA-Tragbarer-1920x1080-Bildschirm-Telefon-Silber/dp/B09Q2WYRKD\nFor some reason, when it's plugged in, the monitor powers up, then immediately says 'No signal', then my Macbook Pro locks up where the mouse freezes, screen goes dark, then appears back much darker and is just frozen.\nAs soon as I unplug the monitor, the laptop is perfectly usable again immediately.\nI recorded console logs and noticed a few errors that seem relevant:\ndefault 22:03:10.708481+0200    WindowServer    [WARN] - IOFBSetDisplayModeAndDepth: Failed to obtain mode info from IOFBGetDisplayModeInformation()\ndefault 22:03:10.708554+0200    kernel  [3:0:0] [FB:0] AmdRadeonFramebuffer::getPixelInformation() !!!

I set my Mac Studio to run at that resolution and refresh rate, but for some reason whenever I wake my Mac from sleep, the refresh rate will switch to the \"Variable (48Hz-120Hz)\" setting. I don't want the variable refresh rate on this display, I would like it to just stick to the full 120Hz refresh rate at that resolution at all times because it makes moving things around the display a bit jittery when using the variable one. Not sure why it's switching back to variable after waking it from sleep but is there a way to prevent this?\nLike I said, using a new Mac Studio running macOS 12.3.1, and a Samsung CRG9 external display.\n\nA: Found a fix right after posting this: Had to turn off FreeSync on my external display in its settings menu. Hopefully this helps someone else having this same issue.\n\nA: I have this same problem.  Apple \"Help\" guided me through turning my computer on in safe mode (I did not need this guidance by the way) and we were unable to change the behavior.  They reverted to telling me to look it up in the monitor's manual as I'm using an Acer KG27U1.  This is not acceptable support.\nThis seems like a fundamental development error on Apple's part.  Users should be able to save settings and turn them off or on and not have them automatically and inevitably change. I look forward to Apple going bankrupt or them listening to their users and actually making something better instead of worse for once.  Neither scenario seems likely.\nP.S.- There is no way to turn off adaptive sync in my monitor settings.  There is no option for anything relating to refresh rate in my monitor settings.\n\nA: Using EasyRes (free at App Store) may be a workaround before Apple finally realize the problem is on their side.\nTurning off FreeSync/AdaptiveSync on display's OSD is quite annoying as I also use my display for gaming on Windows, in which case VRR may be better. Also as others commented, not all displays can disable VRR.

I’m using M1X MacBook Pro 16 inch (2021) running macOS Monterey 12.3.1 with 4-bay hardware RAID enclosure from QNAP (TR-004) holding four 10TB Toshiba HDDs. The enclosure spins down the HDDs soon after they become inactive and I’d like to have them spinning all the time (granular control is desired, though; e.g. spin during the day, spin down at night).\nAlthough I unchecked “Put hard drives to sleep when it’s possible” (wording may slightly be different) for both Battery and Power Adapter menu on the system preferences, the enclosure still spins them down.\nUntil a few weeks ago, having those options unchecked had been working. I believe software (most likely macOS) is to be blamed for this malfunction.\nDoes anybody know how to keep them spinning or how spinning/spin-down work on macOS? Is this controlled by S.M.A.R.T. or something else? If any of you happen to know an app that has granular control over HDDs’ behavior? Thank you in advance!\n\nA: I’ve just solved my issue by myself. This turned out to be seemingly a macOS glitch. It sometimes messes up with the controls over external HDDs. Just unplugging/plugging and rebooting fixed this issue.

The \"-i\" option specifies the time interval in seconds between sending each packet. In this case, the interval is set to 300 seconds (5 minutes). The IP address \"127.0.0.1\" is the loopback address, which refers to the localhost or the computer you're currently using.\nThe command is redirecting the output of the command to a file named \"wake_up.txt\" on the \"WD1\" volume. The \">\" symbol is used to redirect the output of the command to a file. This command will run ping to the localhost with an interval of 5 minutes and save the results in a file on the \"WD1\" volume.\nBy running this command, the hard drive will remain active as it is receiving pings from the localhost every 5 minutes, preventing it from going into standby mode.\n\nA: In this case, the QNAP is controlling the drives, not macOS.  You need to go into QTS and set the appropriate settings to disable Standby mode.\nThe device can be run via firmware, in which case here are DIP switches to control the RAID mode, or via a Mac App (QNAP External RAID Manager). For the firmware, the user guide says that there is a default Standby Mode:\n*\"The RAID enclosure features standby mode to help reduce noise and power consumption. When the RAID enclosure enters standby mode, the system fan and installed HDDs stop spinning, and system processes are\npaused. Upon waking, the RAID enclosure returns to the previous system state and any paused processes are resumed.\nThe RAID enclosure enters standby mode under the following conditions:\n\n*\n\n*The host enters hibernation or standby mode or is powered off. The RAID enclosure only enters standby mode if the USB power design of the host supports this feature.\n\n*The USB cable is disconnected.\"*\n\nPerhaps there has been some other change that changes the way the QNAP 'sees' the Mac USB port? You might try the RAID Manager, see if that gives you additional options.

Even though WiFi connects and get an IP address before another interface, does not mean that traffic will flow through that WiFi interface for that reason.\nThe service order essentially means that if you want to establish an outgoing connection and have two routes of identical specificity towards the destination, then the service order determines which route to take.\nSome examples:\nYou open a connection for \"google.com\" and the most specific route for that is your default gateway. You have one for the WiFi interface and one for the Ethernet interface. As you have prioritised Ethernet higher in your service order list, the data will travel out the Ethernet port.\nYou open a connection for \"192.168.10.1\", a NAS server that is connected directly to your WiFi-router. The most specific route is for 192.168.10.0/24 via your WiFi router. In this case, the data will travel out via WiFi.\nAnother computer connects to your computer via WiFi for a file transfer. Your computer knows that the other computer is accessible both through WiFi and Ethernet - however the service order does not come into play here - the data is sent back via the same route the connection request came through. That is, the file is transferred via WiFi.\n\nA: It turns out that IPv6 affects the network order separately. If IPv6 is turned off, the network priority behaves as expected. IPv6 was only on for my wireless network. Turning IPv6 to a local only link made it \"work\".\nI'd consider this a bug, but may be that it prioritizes IPv6 over everything, and would follow the rules if both networks.\nTheory of actual results for my case's network priority\n\n*\n\n*Ethernet IPv6\n\n*Wireless IPv6\n\n*Ethernet IPv4\n\n*Wireless IPv4\n\nIf someone has a network they can test this on, please post a reply or an answer.\nCredit to Michael Lowry from Network service order not honored from the Apple Discussion site\n", "Q: Why is VirtualBox-Linux-VM slow on macos Monterey? I have a Ubuntu-Linux-VM running on my MacBookPro and everything is sluggish to a point it's unusable from the GUI of the VM.

Choose 200% and you will get the same scaling result when choosing 200% in VB. Only this time the performance is much better. Maybe only this way the 3D acceleration kicks in.\n", "Q: I split a contact into two, one with an Apple ID and with a phone number. How can I get iOS to let me open two messages conversations? Someone in my contacts list that used to have an iPhone has switched to a non-Apple phone, but still has a MacBook. So I want to be able to send this person messages using both iMessage and SMS.\nTo facilitate this, I split their contact in the Contacts app into two: one that contained the email address of their Apple ID, and the other that contained their phone number. This person has also removed their phone number from their Apple ID.\nOn my macs running macOS 10.14.6, the Messages app allows me to open two conversations, one for each contact, and this lets me choose whether I'm sending using SMS or iMessage.\nHowever my iPhone 7 running iOS 15 will not let me do this! Every time I try to open a new conversation using either of the two contacts, it always takes me back to the old one, and it makes it impossible for me to choose between iMessage or SMS. Which one it allows me to send is arbitrary, and the behavior changes from day to day.\nIs there any way I can fix this? It's important I be able to send this person messages using SMS when they're not at their computer.\n\nA: Unfortunately, speaking from experience, there is no way to do this. Apple is doing this to try to make everyone use their apps and platforms.\nYou could use a Google Voice number or some other method to send him SMS while using iMessage when he's at his computer, but there's no supported method besides this. You could also use some other messaging app like Signal to message him on both his phone and laptop.\n", "Q: Which user(s) can activate erased Mac with their device password after Mark As Lost? I have the following 3 users on my M1 Macbook Air 2020:\n\n*\n\n*userA: admin created during macOS installation, no AppleID connected\n\n*userB: non-admin, its own AppleID connected, FindMy disabled\n\n*userC: non-admin, its own AppleID connected, FindMy enabled\n\n\nAfter I invoke Mark As Lost in Find My iPhone app logged in with UserB's AppleID and rebooting into Activate Mac, I can Erase Mac without providing any user credentials. After Mac is erased, I need to activate it:\n\n*\n\n*either by providing AppleID and password\n\n*OR via Use Device Password option\n\n\nNow the question is:\nWhich of UserA, UserB, UserC device passwords should be accepted for \"Use Device Password\"?\n\nSome further details of my setup:\nUserC's AppleID is an adult, non-guardian member of family owned by UserB.\nFileVault enabled during initial MacOS setup; encryption key not associated with any AppleID. Password reset using AppleID is disabled for all users.\n\nMy own experiments gave inconsistent results:\n\n*\n\n*after Mac was locked when UserC logged in, I managed to activate it with UserC's device password\n\n*after Mac was locked when UserB logged in, I failed to activate it with any of UserA, UserB, UserC device passwords: error messages varied between:\n\n*\n\n*Activation lock server cannot be reached\n\n*The password for this Mac can no longer be used to remove Activation Lock. The password was entered incorrectly too many times\nEach experiment takes a couple of hours, so I hope there's official docs / third-party research on the topic.\n\nA: From Apple Platform Security, it looks like only the userC (non-admin, its own AppleID connected, FindMy enabled) can unlock the Mac, assuming that his device password is a replacement for iCloud credentials:\n\nIf the device is Activation Locked, recoveryOS prompts the user for iCloud credentials of the user that enabled Activation Lock at this time.\n\nBUT it is not said explicitly, so I may be wrong--so I welcome input from you guys.\n\nOne more thought: it looks like Macs report user's (encrypted) device password to Apple servers for accounts connected to AppleID. One of such examples is when you are asked on one device to provide that user's local password on other device, as a extra mile to ensure that AppleID is used by the same person across devices.\nThis gives one more reason to think that the password should work only for accounts having AppleID associated with them. And together with \"recoveryOS prompts the user for iCloud credentials of the user that enabled Activation Lock at this time\", it suggests that only the account with activated FindMy should be able to activate with device password.\nStill, it's very indirect evidence.\n", "Q: OpenVPN Connect profile path I'm trying to find the path to imported profiles in openvpn connect app in macos.

For some reason, Time Machine believes the iMovie Library file has been deleted, while iMovie remains open. And then when I quit iMovie, Time Machine backs up the iMovie Library file again, since it is then able to \"see\" the iMovie Library again, even though it never went anywhere.\nAnd since Time Machine thought the iMovie Library was deleted, then later sees it, it thinks that the iMovie Library is new, so it backs the whole thing up, rather than only the changes that were made since the last iMovie Library backup.\nSo, why does Time Machine believe that the iMovie Library is deleted while iMovie is open, and how can I fix it? I've already tried running First Aid on my internal drive, but that didn't fix it.\n\nA: This is normal and expected behaviour. The .imovielibrary file is a dynamic object, being read and written to almost constantly when iMovie is in use.\nIf Time Machine were to backup an open .imovielibrary file, (which can be very large in size,) the first half of the file may have changed by the time the second half of the file has been backed up. That is logically inconsistent, as it is not a true replication of the file!\nBecause the backup process can only realistically be successful on a static file, Time Machine does not back it up.\nDoes this make sense?\nAlthough tangental to this question, this question/answer has some interesting info you might fine useful.\n", "Q: How to start TextEdit with a new document right away?

You have some but not all third-party apps that are hanging at startup, with no clear differentiator between working and broken apps. We should look inside the call stacks of both sets of apps and find what is holding up the main event loop in the latter case. The way to do this is by collecting and analyzing a spindump. To do this:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication:\n sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\"\n\nMake sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a general error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n\n*Reboot your machine and don’t open any apps except for Terminal.\n\n\n*In Terminal, enter the following command, press Return, type in your password, but do not press Return again yet:\n sudo spindump -reveal -noProcessingWhileSampling\n\n\n\n*Launch a known working app, let it reach an idle state, and write down the name of the app.\n\n\n*Launch a known broken app and once you confirm that it is hanging, go to the Terminal window where you entered your password and press Return so that the command begins to execute. Do not do anything else on the computer while this command is running, otherwise you will distort the data collection. Write down the name of the broken app while you wait.\n\n\n*After waiting for >10 seconds to collect a sample and another minute or two to symbolicate and format, you’ll get a file in /tmp/spindump.txt that contains a stackshot of every process.\n\n\n*Upload the file to PasteBin or some equivalent place and add the link to it to your original question. Make sure to tell us the names of the working and broken apps.\n\nA: If this were my mac, here’s the steps I would take.\n\n*\n\n*Start Apple Silicon Mac in safe mode\n\n*Connect USB drive and do a Time Machine Backup\n\n*While Time Machine is running - look over any unix tools / command line tools that might be excluded. Check for Recovered Items on the desktop and Relocated Items\n\n*Restart normally - spot check the backup and exclusions / manual files needing backup or copying to the cloud.\n\n*Reinstall latest OS Installer downloaded from App Store\n\n*Test\n\nTest would be delete the new admin account that didn’t work and make a second new admin account after the OS Install. If that still fails, I would do a reinstall from Recovery and then erase install.\nThe alternative would be to break down each and every app failure - figure which work, which do not, look for commonalities or work on them one by one until you discover the source of the delayed start / early crash / termination. This would require log analysis and some other troubleshooting tips and tricks - but a new admin account usually solves for those, so I’d get prepared for an erase / restore.\n", "Q: nvme gen 4 on mbp 15\" mid 2015 About two years ago I updated the original 256gb ssd on the mbp 15\" mid 2015.

However, It's difficult to know whether newer revisions of standards are going to work (at all, or any better) in hardware that is older than the revision.\nIt's likely that the newer NVMe drive will work, but you will only see the transfer rate that the computer can handle.\nWhile you have certainly experienced some disk corruption, we don't know what's causing it, and whether it's indicative of underlying 'failure' or something else.\nI'd say that SSDs are generally robust, and you should expect more than 2 years of life. Fears over 'natural death through usage' are over-stated, IMO.\nThere is always a risk with third-party hardware designed to replace internals that the differences in spec from the OEM parts can cause issues.\nYou can often find unused or lightly used 1Tb Apple OEM SSD blades on eBay or similar websites. For a 7-year-old Mac, I'd suggest going that route, and maybe offloading additional data onto secondary devices -- even SD card drives.\n\nA: i am just using gen4 nvme ssd on iMac2019.\nthere is no problem, but any nvme ssds are not able to use on macos.\nAnd, gen4 nvme ssds can not drive full speed of their speck, because mac machines have not pcie4 port.\n", "Q: How can I allow Chrome to access iCloud folders I can access file:///Users/falk/ just fine, but not file:///Users/falk/Documents/ or file:///Users/falk/Desktop. The \"loading\" indicator just spins and spins.

Is it possible to clone a Mac directly to another Mac with Carbon Copy Cloner? I just need an answer for macOS 10.13.6. Both machines have exactly the same hardware and OS, except that one of them is running with CPU Intel i7, the other with i9, and one has 512GB disk capacity and the other 256GB. Everything else, including the model A1990, and all other specs are the same.\nI am thinking of this so I can bypass the hassle of cloning to an external harddrive first and then restore to the 2nd Mac.\nI just need both Macbooks to be synced, so that if one is down for repair, there's practically no downtime.\nIf CCCloner does not offer this, is there any other way to do this?\nP.S.: I am intending to always restrict my disk space usage to less than 256GB so I do not face problem of no disk space on the Mac that has lower disk capacity.\nP.S. No 2: I intend to do this syncing between machines on a regular basis (say once a day). Some have mentioned Migration Assistant. Is Migration Assistant suitable for such a frequent task?\n\nA: \nHere I assume both Macs are Mid-2018 15\" (Touch Bar) models.\n\nIf one of the Macs were to have macOS installed twice in different partitions, then you could connect the Macs by a Thunderbolt 3 cable and clone between the two machines. The Procedure would be something like this.\nFirst, assume Mac A has High Sierra installed in two different partitions. The one to be cloned is named Main and the other is named Backup. Mac B just has one High Sierra installed.\nExecute the following steps.\n\n*\n\n*Boot Mac A from the Backup volume.\n\n*Boot Mac B in Target Disk Mode.\n\n*Use the asr command or Disk Utility to clone Mac A's Main to or from Mac B.\n\n\nA: Maybe not.  I used CCC 5 to clone a machine running 10.14 to an external disk.  That Mac can boot off that drive, and all is well, but when I tried to boot another Mac off that drive I got tons of errors.\nIf you just want to clone Documents and stuff that'll work.\n\nA: The short answer to your question is ”No.”\nThe long answer is more complicated, and it is possible using a MDM-ish solution where the system for the machines is managed from other computer(s) and the User accounts are stored on your network. I doubt that it was what want to do, however.\nThe built-in way to do this is via Apple Configurator 2, Remote Desktop, and profiles that restrict the users of the target machines from changing the system. You’ll still need another machine for the network user storage and to administer the machines you want locked down, but you won’t need to pay for a subscription to an MDM enterprise tool.\nIt’s all a matter of how much control you have to exert.\n\nA: The current macOS versions have separated the OS from the user data. This means that the OS is located in a separate sealed area that cannot be overwritten. I therefore think that transferring a clone copy of the full machine is not possible.\nThat doesn’t apply to earlier versions, but if you have different CPUs, then the hardware is not identical, so the OS configuration will probably be different.\nInstead, use one of the provided, supported and recommended options that Apple provides, one of them being the Migration Assistant which allows you to directly move all users and their data to a new machine.\n", "Q: How to fix laggy keyboard inputs on 2019 MacBook Pro 16 inch? This has been bothering me for months. Basically, when I type, it takes a lot of milliseconds for the key presses to register on the screen. This affects web browsing, coding (e.g. Sublime Text), and possibly most annoying, terminal (e.g.  doing important, destructive operations and not being sure if 'enter' has registered - anxiety inducing and shouldn't happen).\nI've bene searching on and off for solutions to this for a few months. Any ideas how to fix it?\nWhat I tried\nI tried resetting the SMC but unfortunately it made absolutely no difference.\n\nA: After months of enduring this, I found the answer deep in a thread.\nGo to System Preferences -> Battery -> UNTICK 'Automatic Graphics Switching'\n\nThe lag/sluggishness/jankiness immediately stops!\n", "Q: Messages app on Mac: Mark all messages as read? On my Mac running macOS Monterey (12.3.1), the Messages icon in the dock is showing a badge with a count of unread messages in the high double digits. (This is an accurate count of old messages that I've never actually individually opened, such as 2FA verification code messages from numerous sites.)\nWhat's the fastest way to mark all of those messages as read, thereby clearing the badge?\n\nA: Not an actual supported solution, but a decent workaround:\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, open the Messages app.\n\n*In the left pane (with the list of messages), select the first message.\n\n*Hold down the Control + Tab keys for a while.\n\nControl + Tab is the keyboard shortcut for \"Go to next message\" in Messages.\nHolding down that keyboard shortcut causes Messages to cycle through all available messages (for as long as you hold down the keys) -- clearing the \"unread\" indicators as it goes.\nOn my machine, I was able to cycle through a year's worth of existing conversations using this method in about 30 seconds.\n\nA: On MacOS dock right click the messages icon and it should have an unread messages option that takes you to the unread message.\n", "Q: Shrink disk image to eliminate free space I created a larger-than-necessary writable disk image, copied content to it, then shrunk the partition with diskutil resizeVolume.\nThis left a big gap at the end of the partition table:\nMEDIA: \"\"; Size 20 GB [41943040 x 512]; Max Transfer Blocks 2048\nSCHEME: 1 APM, \"Apple Partition Scheme\" [1]\nSECTION: 1 Type:'MAP'; Size 20 GB [41943040 x 512]; Offset 1 Blocks (41943039 + 1) x 512\nID Type                 Offset       Size         Name                      (4)\n-- -------------------- ------------ ------------ -------------------- --------\n 1 Apple_partition_map             1           63 Apple               \n 2 Apple_Free                     64       262144 Explicit Record     \n 3 Apple_HFS                  262208     25941040 disk image          \n 4 Apple_Free               26203248     15739792 Explicit Record    \n\nI cannot figure out how to eliminate this gap and shrink the disk image down to the minimal size.

Several guides to creating disk images of macOS install media (using the createinstallmedia command) recommend creating the disk image like this:\nhdiutil create \\\n    -size 10g \\\n    -type UDTO -layout SPUD -fs JHFS+ \\\n    ~/Desktop/installer.cdr\n\nHere, -layout SPUD creates the disk image with an Apple Partition Map, rather than the default, more modern GUID Partition Table.\nAccording to the hdiutil manpage,\n\nSPUD causes a DDM and an Apple Partition Scheme partition map with a\nsingle entry to be written.  GPTSPUD creates a similar image but with a\nGUID Partition Scheme map instead.  When attached, multiple /dev entries\nwill be created, with either slice 1 (GPT) or slice 2 (APM) as the data\npartition.  (e.g. /dev/disk1, /dev/disk1s1, /dev/disk1s2).\nUnless overridden by -fs, the default layout is GPTSPUD (PPC systems\nused SPUD prior to Mac OS X 10.6).  Other layouts include MBRSPUD and\nISOCD.  create -help lists all supported layouts.\n\nSome decades old blogs also note that GPT disks are not compatible with PowerPC Macs, and very old versions of macOS (prior to 10.4.2) do not understand GPT partition maps at all. And years ago there was briefly an incompatibility with VirtualBox when using GPT-formatted install media. So perhaps APM was considered a more broadly compatible format. But these are just theories.\nNote that the createinstallmedia tool keeps the existing partition map flavor of the target disk, and Apple's KB articles indicate no preference for one over the other. The default when formatting a disk with Disk Utility in macOS Monterey is GPT, though, so this is likely what most people use.\n(As an experiment, I followed identical steps to created APM- and GPT-flavored install ISOs for macOS Big Sur and tried booting them with VMware Fusion, and only the APM-flavored installer could boot. I'm investigating this further.)\nIs there actually a specific reason to continue using APM-flavored partition maps for macOS install media?\n\nA: I believe the answer depends on how you intend to use the ISO.\nUse GPT when you want an ISO file that can be written to a bootable USB thumb drive.\nUse APM when you want to install macOS on a virtual machine by attaching the ISO file to an emulated CD/DVD drive.\nYou could also use APM on a physical drive as long as the machine's UEFI understand that format.\nAnd you probably can use GPT install media on a virtual machine by attaching it as a virtual hard drive, but you likely have to convert it to another format than ISO, such as VMDK.\n\nAs I understand it (details welcome in comments) CD/DVD drives typically use a 2048-byte sector size, whereas macOS's disk images can only be created with a 512-byte sector size. Therefore there's a sector size mismatch when attaching the ISO through an emulated CD/DVD drive, but the firmware knows that APM is always 512 bytes and is able to understand it correctly.\n(I think GPT can support other block sizes, but there's no way to control this on macOS.)\n", "Q: Customizing PS1 for two rows similar to zsh Kali I was hoping someone might be able to help me figure out how I can customize my PS1 on macOS zsh to look like Kali zsh.\nHere is $PS1 from Kali zsh:\n%F{%(#.blue.green)}┌──${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)─}${VIRTUAL_ENV:+($(basename $VIRTUAL_ENV))─}(%B%F{%(#.red.blue)}%n$prompt_symbol%m%b%F{%(#.blue.green)})-[%B%F{reset}%(6~.%-1~/…/%4~.%5~)%b%F{%(#.blue.green)}]\n└─%B%(#.%F{red}#.%F{blue}$)%b%F{reset} \n\nAnd, of course, here is $PS1 from macOS zsh:\n%n@%m %1~ %#\n\nI'm kind of hung up on this area\n${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)─}${VIRTUAL_ENV:+($(basename $VIRTUAL_ENV))─}\n\nAnd lastly I'm a little concerned that if I remove those obviously Linux parts of the PS1, without fully understanding how they behave and do not realize I need to replace them in kind with something macOS compatible, that I'm going nowhere fast.\nThis PS1, as-is, is clearly not going to fly in macOS but there are several other parts in the Kali PS1 that make me believe that simply deleting that stuff or not removing other stuff might mess things up royally.\nIf anyone could be so kind I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: Prompt hacking is an art and usually requires a lot of practice and effort.\nIf you want to get a better PS1 prompt you might be advised to install a zsh plug-in manager and have a look at some themes.

If Terminal.app is active and I use Spotlight to open System Preferences, System Preferences opens behind Terminal.app, without keyboard focus. No other app causes this symptom.\n\nA: It turns out this was due to the Secure Keyboard Entry setting in the Terminal menu:\n\nTurning that off fixes the problem.\n", "Q: Use TouchID as mouse - Any way to get serial output from the chip?

My company distributes an app on the regular AppStore. Some customers host the backend on-premises and are not updating the backend as often as we update the app. We've told our customers that if they don't follow the backend upgrade, they should use an MDM software to manage the installation/update of the app on the phones of their employees.\nWe're supposed to deliver critical/security fixes to the older version of the app. So for example, the latest app on the store is v2.0.0, a customer has v1.2.0 and we make a security patch on v1.2.1.\nWe can't distribute v1.2.1 and v2.0.0 to the store at the same time, nor can we just send an IPA build from Bitrise.\nWe do not build ad-hoc apps (but we could, if that's the way to go) and we (currently) don't have Apple Business Manager.\nIs there a step by step guide for folks like me who have not come in contact with \"alternative\" forms of app distribution? Thanks!\n\nA: You basically have two options that are easy to go to:\n\n*\n\n*Have two entries for your app on the App Store. One is \"MyProduct Classic\" and one is \"MyProduct Modern\" so that your 1.x app is renamed \"classic\", and you release the 2.x app under the \"modern\" name. You can ofcourse use any naming scheme you want here.\n\n\n*Ask customer's that want to distribute the old app to do so using enterprise distribution. You can then send them the ´.ipa` file and they basically host their own \"app store\" so that their users can install the app from there.\n", "Q: Setting up env command for bash scripts I am using Big Sur for work. I want to write a bash script that uses some modern bash features.\nThe bash that comes with Big Sur is fairly old:\n$ /bin/bash --version\nGNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin20)\n\nSo in I installed a later version with brew:\n$ /usr/local/bin/bash --version\nGNU bash, version 5.1.8(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin20.3.0)\n\nThis version has the features I want. However, I want the script to be cross-platform, so hardcoding this path at the beginning of scripts causes it not to work on our cloud environment, and certain other devs' machines:\n#!/usr/local/bin/bash\n\nFrom researching, I've found that a standard way to make a script cross-platform is to use this to get a bash location:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nWhich lets the user define a location for bash. However, I have not been able to get the command working on my local environment!\nThis command returns nothing-- I'm expecting it should return the full path to a bash. It doesn't even return the path to the default system bash.\n$ /usr/bin/env bash\n\nI've added /usr/local/bin/bash to my .profile, but that hasn't seemed to work.\n$ cat .profile \nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin/bash:$PATH\"\n\nHow do I configure my environment, shell, or whatever so that /usr/bin/env gives the path to /usr/local/bin/bash?\nI'm using Big Sur 11.6.4 using Terminal 2.11.\n\nA: \nI'm expecting it should return the full path to a bash\n\nYour expectation is incorrect. /usr/bin/env bash launches a new interactive bash shell.\nDemonstrating:\n$ echo $$\n14303\n$ /usr/bin/env bash\n$ echo $$\n14339\n\n\nYour PATH should contain the directory where bash is located.\n\nSomewhat off-topic: if your bash script contains features that are not present in version 3.2 (for example, associative arrays), you can add an assertion to your code to abort early:\nif (( BASH_VERSINFO[0] < 4 )); then\n  echo \"This code needs at least bash version 4\" >&2\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nOr suppose you need at least version 4.4:\nif (( BASH_VERSINFO[0] * 10 + BASH_VERSINFO[1] < 44 )); then\n  echo \"This code needs at least bash version 4.4\" >&2\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n\nA: You need to look at some Unix tutorials to improve your knowledge of Unix. Any decnt one will explain how $PATH works and how to add to it.\nThe important thing to note here is that the elements of $PATH are directories not files. What /usr/bin/env does is it takes its first argument (bash in this case) and sees if it is in each directory in $PATH starting at the left. So to find and run /usr/local/bin/bash you need to have /usr/local/bin in your $PATH and that has to be before /bin which contains Apple's bash so the command you need in you ~/.profile (actually I think should be in ~/.bash_profile - even then read bash's documentation to see this is not the complete recommendation from bash's authors but everyone on the web seems to use this) is\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n\nActually I would do more and use zsh as your shell as that is kept up to date by Apple and so you don't have to install extra software on your mac and it would be easier to run on your work colleges' machines.\n", "Q: How do I bypass Apple Music on the Music app on Monterey? On Monterey, every time I try to open the Music app, it nags me to join Apple Music. Moreover, when I open the iTunes store and click to play a song, it nags me again to join Apple Music and does not even allow me to preview a song. No matter how many times I dismiss the nagging ad, it will repeat the ad. Any other options like buying a song are not available. What can I do to solve this?\n\nA: The only way I managed to get rid of these ads is to join the Apple Music and then after a few minutes I went to music.apple.com to cancel the subscription. After doing this, I was able again to buy songs and preview songs in the iTunes Store as I usually did on Big Sur and earlier MacOS's.\n\nA: Do you have Apple Music unticked in preferences?

So I really hope you can help me.\n\n*\n\n*Typically I'm working for a couple of hours using basic stuff like Zoom, Chrome and my programming IDE and everything seems fine. No lags etc. Macs Fan Control is showing the following measurements:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Then, after 4-5 hours suddenly my whole computer gets very laggy. After checking the Activity monitor, I can see that kernel_task is taking up 100-300% CPU percentage.\n\n*This kernel_task process seems to be a system strategy to block CPU usage and prevent further heating of the hardware that could potentially cause damage.\n\n*This happens instantly after 4-5 hours of normal work. I do not run extra programs. The temperatures are still at ~60-65°C.\n\n*I can stop the lagging, if I close almost all programs.

Mine is at 40° right now doing not a lot. A 2019 isn't particularly old, but if you haven't blown the dust out of it in the past year, now would be a good time to do it.

Flipping open the lid and using the button did nothing.\nPer the web recommendations, removed the airpods from my phone's list of paired bluetooth devices.\nAfter that, flipping the lid open and holding down the back button did work ok.  I was able to pair them to my Windows 10 PC.  However, once paired, the back button again did nothing.\nI then Removed the airpods from the list of paired devices on my PC.  flipping open the airpods lid and holding the back button on the case still does nothing.\nI'm hypothesizing that the airpods have an internal list of paired devices.  Once this list has one device in it, there seems to be a bug and the back button loses functionality.  Removing the airpods from an apple device seems to allow for communication to the airpods that the device has been removed.  This is possibly why it's recommended to remove your iPhone if having issues pairing.\nHowever, removing from a Windows PC doesn't seem to clear it from the airpods' list.

Instead of switching to the space left or right it just shows things like ^[[1;5C1 in the terminal, or having no apparent effect when any other apps are in focus. Changing the keyboard shortcut to switch spaces from ctrl+left/right to shift+left/right doesn't seem to help.\nIs there any way to do this?\n\nA: Using ctrl-left and ctrl-right to switch desktops is brittle, because you're dependent on the user having that in their keyboard mappings.\nHaving said that, this Applescript fragment will shift desktops left or right, depending.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    -- key code 123 is left arrow\n    -- key code 124 is right arrow\n    key code 123 using {control down}\nend tell\n\nIf you want to execute this from python, a good reference is Dr Drang's posting at  leancrew.

Sometimes when I get an alert for a calendar event, there's a chime and the notification says that it's \"time-sensitive\". Other times the alert is silent and this wording isn't in the notification.  I can't figure out what distinguishes the two types of events.\nSome of my alerts are based on travel time, others are just based on time until the event starts. Could that be the distinction?\n\nA: First we need to understand the different alert levels attached to notifications. Here is short description of notification alert levels from https://www.makeuseof.com/ios-15-time-sensitive-notifications-explained/. It refers to iOS, but applies equally to macOS.\n\nApple categorizes notification interruptions into four levels: passive, active, time-sensitive, and critical. Let's break down each to help you understand them better.\n\n*\n\n*Passive: iOS delivers passive notifications (those that don't need immediate attention) silently without triggering sounds and\nvibrations and lighting up the screen.\n\n*Active, the default interruption level, are the regular notifications that will produce sound and vibrations and light up the\nscreen.\n\n*Time-sensitive notifications are the special kind that will alert you, like active ones, but with a high priority of breaking through\nenabled system controls like Focus mode and Notification Summary.\n\n*Critical notifications, first introduced in iOS 14, have a higher priority than time-sensitive as they can bypass the ringer switch\nalert. Critical notifications only apply to sensitive cases like\nsevere weather alerts and local safety alerts. And due to their\nnature, Apple has to grant an app developer permission individually\nto deliver critical notifications.\n\n\nNote the reference to Focus mode. Time-sensitive alerts are intended to be those that the developer believes you might want to break through when you have a particular focus mode (e.g. Do Not Disturb) enabled.\nYou can control the delivery of time sensitive alerts by both application and focus mode. This is in System Preferences > Notifications & Focus.\nIt is up to the app developer to decide on the alert level for its own notifications. In typical Apple style, I can't find a precise definition or technical explanation for what Calendar app considers to be Time-sensitive.  In Help, Apple say this for Calendar's Time-sensitive alerts:\n\nNotifications for events that require your immediate attention.\n\nAnd that is the best I can do.

Is there a way to remove the header and footer that FB adds when I save a page as a PDF (from Chrome on a Mac)?\nWhen I ask Facebook to give me an archive of some of my previous posts, I gives me results that link to an archive page, something like this:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/[magicnumber_redacted]/allactivity/?category_key=YOURTIMELINEPOSTS&entry_point=ayi_hub&year=2021&month=4\n\nwhich shows thumbnails and 2- to 3-line snippets of all my timeline posts for April 2021. That's really pretty useful for searching. But unfortunately, that page is not searchable. On a Mac, using Cmd+F will only search the framework of the page that has the date text, the displayed snippets of the post contents are not searchable. Cmd+A, Cmd+V will copy the framework text, but not the snippets. If I save it as HTML and reload the saved file, same problem is there. I'm not enough of an HTML guru to figure out how to automate restructuring of the pages.\nHowever, I can save the page a PDF and then the full displayed text is searchable. That's what  I want. Yay! BUT there is a glitch. FB adds headers and footers to every PDF page that cover over part of the text of the first and last snippet on each. The text is there, hidden. If I search the PDF for text that I know is hidden, Acrobat highlights the area where the text should be, underneath the large colored header or footer bar.\nSo is there a way to get FB to not insert page headers and footers when the web page is saved as PDF? I can save PDFs of other web pages without this kind of problem.\nThanks.\n\nA: I had erroneously thought that it was Facebook that put the header on every page, and wrote my question that way. That's mistaken.\nAfter much experimenting, it seems that when Facebook serves a page, it provides fixed header information and scrolling page data. Then it is up to the browser to put those together, for display or when you ask the browser to print the page, including save it to PDF.\nSo the answer to the question is:\nIt's not Facebook adding the header to the printed page or PDF, it's the browser, and the solution is to use Safari instead of Chrome for these kinds of pages.\nChrome appears to have the design decision that it will print the header on every page. On Facebook, that includes both the menu at the left and the links at the top of the page. But Chrome does not allow room for that on each printed page, with the result that some of the scrolled page data is masked or eclipsed. The same is true for Chrome-like browsers like Opera.\nBut Safari made a different design decision, they only print the header on one page. It turns out that it's not always the first page, it's the page you are looking at. If you have scrolled to the bottom of a long Facebook page in Safari and then print it, or save it to PDF, Safari will put the header info on the last or next-to-last page, depending on how the pages break. But it won't allow room for the header there, so there will be data that is eclipsed or masked.\nBut Safari does allow room for the header on the first page, so if you scroll to the top before printing, the header will be on the first page only, and there will be room allowed, and the print or PDF will be reasonably formatted with no data eclipsed or masked.\n\nA: If there are no print css styles in the web page or a special 'print' or\n'print version' or 'offline reading' button then it will always be not\neasy to print a web page.\nThen you will have to find workarounds:\n\n*\n\n*delete html nodes\n\n*change css styles\n...\n\nDelete html nodes:\nYou can delete nodes from the html DOM.\nOpen the developer tools.\n(Shortcut on a Mac: Open Developer Tools    ⌘ + Option + i)\nThen go to the 'Elements' - Tab, there you can see the DOM.\nMoving the mouse over the html elements in the elements window\nwill higlight the corresponding parts of the html page.\nIf you move the mouse over some part of the html page and\nclick with the right mouse button and select 'Inspect' will select\na html element in the 'Elements' window.\nIf you have selected a node with 'Inspect' then move the mouse\n(without clicking) in the elements windows upwards.\nYou will see that the\nselection in the html page will extend.\nThen go further upwards until the whole part of the html page\nyou want to be deleted will be selected.\nIf you are on the outmost html element that corresponds to the parts\nto be deleted then click the right mouse button\n(in the 'Elements' window) and select 'delete element'.\nMost of the time this will be a  element\nor a  element.\nBut it will not always work. It depends on how dynamic the web page is\nand how the page is composed (html, css js etc.).\nSometimes it goes wrong and the remaining parts of the page\nwill be moved or collapsed or you did delete too much.\nThen you can refresh the page and start again.\nSometimes e.g. you want to delete a whole sidebar or a footer.\nYou might find  html elements or css style classes called alike.\nChanging styles:\nYou find the styles in the 'Styles' tab.\nSometimes the text content part is in a column that is too narrow.\nTry to select the whole column.\nThen look a the styles. Maybe you find a size or a percentage.\nClick on the value and increase it.\nSometimes a page is build with bootstrap.\nIf you delete left and right columns to have only the content in the middle,\nthat part might still not extend to the right.\nThen it could be that the bootstrap class restricts the width e.g. to 4 or 6\ncolumns of the whole page layout (maybe a 12 column layout).\nThe bootstrap class might be 'col-md-6'.\nThen you could change this class to e.g. 'col-md-10'\nso that the whole div can fill a 10 columns space.\nGood luck !\n", "Q: Safari is caching hard, I have to empty for each change in my css Does anybody know if there is a fix/workaround for Safari so it doesn't cache everything so hard.

Where can I find the storage type (emmc, ufs, ssd, nvme) of an iPad online?\nI thought I could find it easily online, but when I search something like: ipad 2021 storage type, ipad 2021 specs, ipad 2021 memory type, ipad 2021 emmc, ipad 2021 ufs, ipad 2021 ssd keywords, I can not find any useful results.\nCan anyone show me the correct way to find the true ipad specs?\nThanks a lot.\n\nA: Apple does not advertise the exact type of storage used. I guess because it is a technical detail that they do not require users to know about, and also because it is inherently difficult to compare as a \"spec item\".\nYou can also see this in your question, as you have confused and mixed together various terms - which makes comparison pointless. You list various storage types as \"emmc, hfs, ssd, nvme\" - which doesn't make any sense.\nSSD means \"solid state storage\", which means storing data without having any moving mechanical parts. This is typically a form of \"flash memory\", as opposed to traditional hard drives that have rotating platters.\neMMC is a specific standard for SSDs that require them to conform to a specific electric interface and a data transfer protocol. It is usually in the form of a chip that is soldered on to a PCB.\nHFS is a file system developed by Apple, which hasn't really seen mainstream usage in many years. A file system is a way to organize bytes on a disk - it doesn't really matter if that disk is an SSD, a hard drive or something entirely different.\nNVMe is a protocol specification for accessing storage. The storage is usually a form of SSD, but it could in theory be almost anything. The electrical interface can be many different things (and even non-electric - i.e. optical).\nThe items above are in four different categories of things. It doesn't make sense to compare them.\nNow to the actual, modern iPads made by Apple in the last few years:\nYou'll find that all of them (and indeed any iPad ever made) has an SSD in some form. I.e. solid state storage.\nNone of them have eMMC storage.\nNone of them uses HFS.\nNone of them uses UFS.\nIn fact you'll find that Apple in general do not buy off-the-shelf complete drives. Instead they use raw flash storage chips with their own, proprietary storage controller. For the latest iPads such as the iPad Air 5th Gen, this controller is embedded within the main System-On-Chip (SoC).\nFor your comparison purposes, you can just assume that every iPad made by Apple in the last 5 years or so have the equivalent of NVMe storage. It might not be actual NVMe storage, but it is the comparable of that.\nYou ask how to search for this type of information. Google is ofcourse always a good place to start, but as you indicate, it does require a technical background to understand any results you get. You can go to places like iFixIt to read about their tear-downs of various iPad models to see how they are made - but again, it requires technical knowledge in order to be able to understand their material.\nThe best way forward for you I guess is to ask some place like this.\n", "Q: Can i remove Guest Account completely in Terminal or add a password when logging in even with FileVault enabled?

My MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) is connected to a Thunderbolt 3 dock which has external monitors and, most crucially, a USB3 Time Machine drive on it.\nIf I so much as lightly touch the Thunderbolt cable, the dock and all attached devices disconnect. The biggest concern is the unsafe un-mounting of the hard drive, but losing my monitors, keyboard and microphone is also annoying.\nIs there any setting which would make OS X more tolerant in momentary (less than 2 second) Thunderbold disconnects? I expect not... in which case, are there any hardware changes which can make a Thunderbolt connection less flakey? (It's an Apple thunderbolt cable, but a third party dock)\n\nA: No, there’s no such setting. That sort of thing is not possible to make happen in software in the operating system.\nI would advise you to use cables and docks that allows you to physically lock the cable, so that you do not accidentally unplug it. Some plugs can be locked with screws to the dock, or have various “twist-to-lock” mechanism to ensure a reliable connection.\n", "Q: Mac OS 12.3+ /usr/bin/python requirement As of macOS 12.3, Apple no longer ships Python 2\nHowever, I am trying to install a program (.pkg installer) that depends on /usr/bin/python and it fails.

My separate keyboard (a Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate with ISO layout) has, to my chagrin, a different and erroneous keyboard mapping than the MacBook's built-in (also ISO).\nThe biggest annoyance is the different mapping of the ' and < keys.\nThe built in laptop keyboard is like so (Norwegian locale, ISO layout):\n\nWhile the separate keyboard behaves like so (ANSI layout):\n\nThis is not the correct layout. E.g. the Enter/Return button is wrong (1 row).

I have found similar topics like this, this and this, but none that answers this issue.\n\nA: After removing the com.apple.keyboardtype.plist file (found in /Library/Preferences/) and restarting, the Mac stopped referencing the non-existent Logitech keyboard. I could now use the Keyboard Setup Assistant, and finally the ISO layout was respected, solving the problem.\n\nFWIW, this is the binary content of the plist I ended up with:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>keyboardtype</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>320-9456-0</key>\n        <integer>41</integer>\n    </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n", "Q: Is this a virus on my Macbook Pro? \nI tried to minimise my Visual Studio window and this happened as I moused over the dock.

In essence, I'd just be using this cable.\nNominally, the port puts out 5V 3.3A.  The desire to do this stems from the fact that I could eliminate that wall brick from the counter.  I wouldn't charge the laptop in this manner while in use, just while in standby/sleep.\nI've done the same thing with a Dell Precision 5560 but I cared about that machine a litle less.  Just curious about thoughts here.\n\nA: Your described use case does not harm your MacBook at all, rather the opposite. Charging the battery slower (i.e. lower wattage) means there is less heat, which is the main factor degrading your battery longevity.\nYou can also safely use your MacBook while connected to that outlet. As soon as your MacBook needs more power than whats provided by that outlet (in this case 16.5W) it will use the battery to provide whatever is still needed. For example: if your MBP needs a total of 30W, the battery will provide the 13.5W, since you only get 16.5W from the wall. Of course, the battery now discharges meaning, although connected to power, at some point your battery will run out of juice and your MBP shuts down.\n\nThe M1 Max and Pro chips are extremely efficient and depending on the workload can stay below that 16.5W power draw. Yet, this heavily depends on what you are doing with the machine.\n", "Q: Has the move to /opt/homebrew/ on Apple Silicon improved Homebrew security?

Basically this:\nhttps://applehelpwriter.com/2018/03/21/how-homebrew-invites-users-to-get-pwned/\nIt looks like some people have mitigated this for Intel Macs by installing homebrew on a dedicated non-root user account and restricting /usr/local/ write access to that user, like this:\nImproving security of homebrew installation (ownership of /usr/local)\nIs a similar precaution necessary on the Apple Silicon version of homebrew, given that it now installs by default to /opt/homebrew/?  If so, how would I go about setting that up?\n\nA: The risk mentioned in your first link doesn't depend on the directory Homebrew is installed in, it comes from the fact that a user-writeable directory exists early within PATH which allows an attacker to \"shadow\" a command like sudo. So the situation hasn't changed in regard to this.\nPS: IMHO, the additional risk was and is rather small. The user installing Homebrew (which is then also the user having write access to /opt/homebrew) needs to be Administrator anyway. And as Administrator you can install a shadowing command in /usr/local/bin even without Homebrew.\n", "Q: Regarding: Apple M1 Ultra with 20-core CPU If I run top or htop on it-- what would I see?\n40 CPUs or 20?\nIt's a legitimate question: I don't expect to be \"voted down\" for it.....\n\nA: The M1 CPU doesn't do Hyperthreading, like Intel CPUs, so 20 cores is 20 cores.\ntop doesn't give me a CPU count on my M1 Pro MBP.\nhtop is not included with MacOS.\n", "Q: What SSD drives are compatible with a 2011 Mac Mini?

This is not a big deal usually because almost every app restarts exactly where I left it before the restart but some of them are instead returned to desktop 1 after restart, so that at every restart I have to move them again to the desktop I want them to be. If this can be useful in any way, the apps that behave this way for me are Microsoft Office apps, Visual Studio Code (I work with this so I have several windows open at any time), Spotify, Tidal, Adobe PDF reader. Is there a way to fix this permanently so that every single window of every app reopens exactly at the desktop where it was before restart? For instance, the solution described here Preserve the desktop where an application's window was placed, after a system restart does not fit my needs. Thanks everyone.\n\nA: I don't believe that it's possible to do what you ask, from within only the apps and the OS.\nIn particular, it's not my experience that \"almost every app restarts exactly where I left it before the restart\". I'm having trouble finding more than a very few writing, code editing, or note-taking apps that will reopen multiple windows in multiple desktops. (My goal is to be able to restore at least one app window in each of 21 or more desktops, so the app has to be able to handle that many open windows.)\nHowever, it may be possible to functionally do what you are trying to do, but it's a research project, the problem has not yet been solved, to my knowledge after asking similar questions for years.\nWhy the OS is Against You\nTheoretically, when the OS hibernates in response to a critically low battery or other reasons, it takes a \"snapshot\" of the current state of the system and then restores that when you reboot. Why can't it do the same whenever you reboot?\nWhen the system hibernates, it presumes that everything else is normal and restoration to the same state is desired. In general, when a reboot happens in the normal course of things, it's because there are reasons to not want everything restored. If you are installing system software or upgrades, if a process has crashed the system, you do not want the system to stay in its current state, you want it to restart. So a hibernation-style snapshot won't do the job, the system will have to record the state in other ways.\nBut it doesn't. Worse, as noted later, Apple has removed information that would make this process easier. The OS leaves the process of restoring windows pretty much up to the apps themselves.\nApp Variations in Reboot Robustness\nAs you have noted, some apps are better than others about this. Typically, it seems to me, apps ported from Windows are not as good at it as native Mac apps. But even apps supplied with the system that you think really have a good reason for behaving like you want, e.g., Stickies, don't do it. When you reboot, previously open Stickies will all open again, but they all appear on Desktop 1.\nOne would think that of all the built-in Apple apps, Stickies would be the one app where re-opening in the original Desktop Workspace would be integral to the concept of the app. And one would be wrong.\nSo maybe apps that have been around forever, since before Exposé and Mission Control, don't have what it takes either. But that idea is contradicted by Finder. Finder windows will reopen in the Desktop where they had been.\nI have been looking for note-taking and list-making apps that I could use as you describe, where I would have an open app on each Desktop where I would record progress, To-Dos, etc., about the project on that Desktop. So the ability to automatically reopen the app windows on the appropriate Desktop is crucial to that workflow.\nHere are some results of testing various apps. Remember, this is about notetaking and to-do-list apps, not apps in general, which is why Finder is not in this list.\nApps that work\n\n*\n\n*TextEdit. Built in. Multiple windows. Reboots to original desktops. Preserves unsaved buffers.\n\n*Notes. Built in. Multiple windows by floating notes. Reboots to original desktops. No unsaved buffers. Can share content with iOS. Master Notes window shows all notes, regardless of where floating notes are positioned, so selecting in this UI will not change Desktops. BEWARE: Float ON TOP has an annoying habit of moving a note window, but not all, along with you when you change Desktops.\n\n*FoldingText. Free (?). Multiple windows. Reboots to original desktops. FT was recently sold (info from 9/2022); new owner plans a 3.0 release which may be paid.\n\n*TextDo. Free. Multiple windows. Reboots to original desktops.\n\n*Typora 1.0. $15. Multiple windows. Markdown. Reboots to original desktops. Preserves unsaved buffers\n\n*Bear. Free. $1.50/mo to sync with phone. Multiple Windows. Markdown. Reboots to original desktops. Unusual concept of master window that has a paragraph from every file and then files are separately openable from there.\n\nApps that don’t work\n\n*\n\n*Trello. Allows multiple windows in a session. Reboots to only one window in the first desktop.\n\n*Word. Allows multiple windows in a session. Reboots to only one window in the first desktop.\n\n*OneNote. Allows multiple windows in a session. Reboots to only one window in the first desktop.\n\n*MS To Do. No multiple windows. Reboots to the first desktop.\n\n*BBedit 12. Multiple windows. Reboots to first desktop in the window’s original monitor.\n\n*Bbedit 14. Same as v12. Even the new Notes mode is not suitable.\n\n*Text Wrangler — same as BBEdit.\n\n*TextMate — Allows multiple windows. Reboots with all windows in first desktop.\n\n*Antnotes — Billed as a better Stickies. Reboots with all windows in first desktop (just like original Stickies).\n\n*MacVim. Nothing reopens after a reboot and the open files seem to even have vanished from the Recents list, even though they were saved. VIM is a Fail.\n\nI haven't kept notes about apps that are not suitable for lists or note taking, but I have noticed that some apps reopen all windows but puts them all on Desktop 1, some apps only reopen a single window on whatever Desktop you reboot into, and some apps don't reopen at all, even with the \"Restore All Windows\" setting.\nApps to be tested\nI look forward to testing:\n\n*\n\n*Code Bubbles\n\n*Brackets\n\n*Notion\n\n*... and any others that you or others might suggest are good candidates for easy note taking and reboot robustness.\n\nApple API Info\nMeanwhile, I believe that it is possible to do what you ask, but the project is in its infancy.\nFrom OSX 10.5 to OSX 10.8, Apple provided an API window attribute, kCGWindowWorkspace, that would tell you what Mission Control Desktop Workspace any particular window was in; it was simply a fundamental attribute of the window. As it should be, IMHO.\nBut kCGWindowWorkspace is no longer available. It's been deprecated as of OSX 10.11. That makes it much harder to collect the information you desire.\nScraping by on Minimal Info\nFor a couple of years now, it's been the accepted wisdom that Apple had removed all Desktop Workspace info from public APIs, but it turns out that's not entirely right. There is an API, NSWorkspaceActiveSpaceDidChangeNotification, which returns true after a change of Desktop Workspace. That's it.\nThere's a GitHub app, WhichSpace, that puts a numeric icon in the status bar to tell you which Desktop you're in, and you can query that with AppleScript.\nAnd there are various tools, from AppleScript to Keyboard Maestro, that can list all the open windows of the current Desktop and give you info on window size and position.\nPrototyping a System\nSo to do what you ask, it appears to me that you'll need to essentially create a system to to do periodic backups of the current state of all Desktops, perhaps more frequently backing up the current Desktop only.\nIt's not easy. For example, when you move a window from one Desktop to another, the system can notify you that the Desktop has changed and you can find out the current Desktop/Space number. But it's when you're on the new Destop that you would want to backup the previous desktop and there's no simple way of getting that info without making that the current desktop again.\nThen you need a startup routine to unpack the backup info to restore your working environment.\nI would love to have such a system. I currently have 21 desktops.

Surely it should be disk0s2 as the partition to be added is after disk0s2. This is just my reading of man diskutil.\n\nWell, now running diskutil addpartition disk0s1 apfs NewAPFS 0 worked and it created a new partition called NewAPFS. This means it is possible to follow the steps provided by David Anderson.\nIts worth mentioning that in this procedure the entire existing partition is being copied on the NewAPFS partition so I had to clean up my mac and temporary remove a lot of apps.\nOnce I reduced my disk usage the instructions worked quite nicely.

There is no enforcement of what is in there,\nApple's File System documentation says that ~/Library/Application Support should contain configuration files and data files:\n\nUse this directory to store all app data files except those associated with the user’s documents. For example, you might use this directory to store app-created data files, configuration files, templates, or other fixed or modifiable resources that are managed by the app. An app might use this directory to store a modifiable copy of resources contained initially in the app’s bundle. A game might use this directory to store new levels purchased by the user and downloaded from a server.\n\n\nAll content in this directory should be placed in a custom subdirectory whose name is that of your app’s bundle identifier or your company.\n\nAs for malware that is too broad, for one could question on Stack Exchange.\n\nA: Anti-viruses doesn't just look at the folder names and assume \"Oh that's a system folder, let's leave that alone\", \"Oh that's not com.apple.* so let's delete it!\"\nThey usually scan files for malicious code, so you shouldn't need to remove anything.\nAnd, they also scan folders like Application Support and even if it's a com.apple.*, it'll still check files in that. So you shouldn't have to worry.\nYou have stated, though, this:\n\nSome general wisdom about how adware works on a lower level and how to go about debugging the sources of various popup-like problems without just resorting to antivirus\n\nWhich, to me, sounds like you don't want to use an anti-virus so I'd recommend looking for folders that have names that you haven't seen on your mac before. Let's say you have an app called \"UIDownloader\" (example name), it'd probably have a Preferences/Config file in Application Support under a folder called \"com.example.uidownloader\".\nBut if you have a folder called \"com.example.suspiciousfolder\" but you haven't seen that name in an application or such then you could check through it or just delete it altogether.\n", "Q: Set Date Modified to oldest of selected files in Finder?

app document Can I have a little spreadsheet within my Pages document, do a little bit of calculations?\nI found the \"Table\" feature. But that seems to support only static content, not formulas for calculating values.\n\nA: You can create a formula in a Pages table simply by starting to write in any cell with an equal (\"=\") sign as described in the \"Calculate values using data in table cells in Pages on Mac\" Apple Pages support webpage. The outcome of the formula will be updated automatically when the formula or the content of any cell included in the formula is modified. If you need to have a Pages table cell to literally show an equal sign at its beginning rather than contain a working formula, simply type in a single quote (‘) before the equal sign.\nWhile it is not possible to embed a Numbers table into a Pages document like an Excel sheet can be into a Word document, you can paste a Numbers table to Pages; the formulas in the Numbers table will be preserved in the Pages table unless they refer to a cell in a table that has not been pasted simultaneously from Numbers. Note, however, the Pages table will not be linked to the original Numbers document in any case and therefore will not be updated as the Numbers table it is copied from is changed.\n", "Q: Getting the full list of all dependencies and sub-dependencies in Homebrew *before* installation I notice Homebrew does a poor job of listing the actual list of dependencies of a package:\n$ brew info ffmpeg\nffmpeg: stable 5.0.1 (bottled), HEAD\nPlay, record, convert, and stream audio and video\nhttps://ffmpeg.org/\nNot installed\nFrom: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/ffmpeg.rb\nLicense: GPL-2.0-or-later\n==> Dependencies\nBuild: nasm ✘, pkg-config ✘\nRequired: aom ✘, dav1d ✘, fontconfig ✘, freetype ✘, frei0r ✘, gnutls ✘, lame ✘, libass ✘, libbluray ✘, librist ✘, libsoxr ✘, libvidstab ✘, libvmaf ✘, libvorbis ✘, libvpx ✘, opencore-amr ✘, openjpeg ✘, opus ✘, rav1e ✘, rubberband ✘, sdl2 ✘, snappy ✘, speex ✘, srt ✘, tesseract ✘, theora ✘, webp ✘, x264 ✘, x265 ✘, xvid ✘, xz ✔, zeromq ✘, zimg ✘\n\nOne would be excused if the expectation were that these are all the needed dependencies, but each dependency has dependecies that are not listed.

I've got Airpods Pro that are paired to my work Macbook Pro and my Android phone (Oneplus 7T). I'd like them to connect to whatever device they were most recently connected to, but it seems that the option \"When Last Connected to This Mac\" (which I do have enabled) only respects Apple devices.\nEvery time I pull out my Airpods, no matter if they were connected to the Macbook or my phone most recently, they automatically connect to the Macbook, even waking it from sleep, activating work 2FA, and making it drain its battery, apart from just being plain annoying.\nIs this on purpose, or a bug? My hunch is that it's an intentional bug to annoy non-Apple users into buying an iPhone, just to make the pain go away. It's even more frustrating since I am obviously an Apple customer. I have a personal Macbook, a work Macbook, and  Airpods Pros, yet they're still not satisfied and troll people who have given them many thousands of dollars just so they can extract another 900 or what have you. Am I wrong?\n\nA: Your hunch is incorrect and you are wrong.\nThe feature you mention needs to be implemented on the computing device (computer, phone, tablet, AppleTV, whatever). As your Android phone does not support this feature - it can't work.\nThis is not a matter of Apple being a greedy company making the AirPods ignore everything but Apple products. It is simply the fact that this feature requires the computing device to have an implementation of the feature, and your Android phone does not.\nTaken at face value, the system is actually doing exactly what you asked it for. You asked it to reconnect automatically to the AirPods if they were last connected to this Mac. In order to avoid your MacBook waking from sleep, you could simply disconnect from the AirPods every time you stop using them (i.e. select for example the internal speakers as the audio output from the menu bar).\n", "Q: Reclaiming partitions after old Linux installation A long while back I recall installing Linux on my macbook.

This is the only macos computer I have access to. I have also access to a Windows 10 computer.\nHow can I wipe out the entire disk so that even if there are any spyware on the mac mini I can get rid of them?\n\nA: Since it is a Mac Mini late 2014, it is able to run macOS Monterey. If it is, indeed, running macOS Monterey, then you can reset by shutting the computer off, then turning it back on and simultaneously pressing Command+R. This should take you to the Recovery menu. Click on the option saying \"Disk Utility\". Then click on the topmost disk (likely labeled Macintosh HD), the one containing all the other volumes. (Make sure external disks are disconnected.) Then in the toolbar click \"Erase\". This will take some time and erase your disk. Then press Command+Q to quit Disk Utility in Recovery. Then click \"Reinstall macOS \".

But when I tried restarting, it proceeded to install a new Safari version and the same thing happened. So, the problem seems to be with restarting. I don't know where I am going wrong, but I want to update its software and I don't have much practice with macOS. So, I need help on possible solutions or workarounds.\n\nA: Try installing Monterey from the App Store instead. Go to the App Store on your computer and use the search bar to search \"macOS Monterey\". It should be the first result, listed under \"Utilities\" and from the developer \"Apple\". Click \"View\", then \"Get\". You may be asked for your Apple ID password to install. Once it is downloaded, open it, and it will prompt you through an install of macOS Monterey. Be sure to back up any important files from your computer before updating, as they could be lost. (You can use Time Machine if that's your style, or just offload files to external storage manually.)\n", "Q: Why [Watch]->[Settings]->[Bluetooth] says no connection, but iPhone says there is a Bluetooth connection to the Watch? I have no problem with 2-way communication between my AppleWatch Series 3 (os v8.5.1) and iPhone 12-mini (iOS v15.4.1).\nThe iPhone Settings shows the Apple Watch as a connected device.\nHowever, on the [AppleWatch]->[Settings]->[Bluetooth]\nI do not see the iPhone. For a baseline, I do see a desk-side speaker on the watch's bluetooth settings.\nPerfect 2-way communication happens with the iMessage app and the Currently Playing Song app on the watch and the iPhone.\nUltimately, I was trying to install the ActiveOS platform on iOS, and somehow use that to enable GoogleMap's TimeLine feature on my Apple Watch via gps data caching when I'm away from the iPhone but always wearing the watch. Google Maps installs on the watch and in the Settings for that apps I maybe could connect to the iPhone to give this watch caching idea a try. I'm stuck because my watch cannot detect my iPhone using Bluetooth. But there is definitely communication happening for the iMessage and \"Current Music\" apps between the iPhone and watch. I guess it is via WiFi or NFC? I'm confused.\nIn any event, I'm in deep need of a wearable to perform location tracking. I'll accept any solution. Caching of gps coordinates for a few hours would be fine. A Timeline on Apple Maps would also be fantastic.\nI've unpaired the watch and factory reset it. But, I just cannot get the watch to list the iPhone as a Bluetooth device. Yet, the watch and iPhone communicate for iMessage and Music.\n\nA: The Bluetooth menu on the watch will never show the iPhone. They have an implicit link, and as such you never need to pair with the iPhone from the Bluetooth menu.\nAs far as I know, Google Maps' TimeLine feature always gathers location data from your phone - never your Apple Watch. From Google's settings page on the web, you can set which device it uses for location tracking (if you have multiple phones), but don't expect to see your watch there.\nInstead you could use for example the Trails app. Its Apple Watch part can do offline logging of GPS positions while stand-alone (i.e. no iPhone in reach). It will sync the logged positions to the phone when back home.\n", "Q: \"Loading services\" hangs when trying to set the AutoSave on an Excel workbook When I enabled AutoSave via a slider on the upper-left of the workbook a dialog pops up and then hangs on Loading services... :\n\nWhat might be wrong and what is a remedy?\n\nA: Do you have OneDrive as it's needed for AutoSave. From documentation:\n\nAutoSave only applies to Office files stored in OneDrive, but the Office AutoRecover feature is on by default and saves your work every 10 minutes.\n\nMore specifically from documentation:\n\nAutoSave is enabled when working on a file that is saved to OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint Online. If the file is hasn't been saved, or is saved to another location, then AutoSave is disabled.\n\nAutoSave is also disabled when you have OneDrive/Sharepoint but your file is in an older format like .xls, or your file is in a local OneDrive folder and OneDrive synchronization is paused etc.\nIf you have AutoSave enabled i.e. above mentioned requirement are met then it may still not work. The workbook may contain unsupported features. In such a situation documentation suggest of doing one or more of the following to (try) enable it:\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the Shared Workbook feature. This feature has been replaced by co-authoring.\n\n\n*If possible, remove password encryption from the file: Go to File > Info > Protect Workbook. Delete the password and click OK.\n\n\n*If possible, remove restricted access: Go to File > Info > Protect Workbook > Restrict Access and click Unrestricted Access.\n\n\n*If you are opening a workbook snapshot from SharePoint, open the file instead of the snapshot.\n\n\n*Turn off Refresh data when opening file setting on all tables and PivotTables in the file. Select the table or PivotTable, then go to Table Tools Design > Refresh > Connection Properties. Then uncheck Refresh data when opening file.\n\n\n*Inactivate an add-in that's causing AutoSave to be disabled.

Any ideas what I should try next to resolve this?\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: \nMaybe something was mapping control-click to be right-click automagically before and is no longer?\n\nI've been fighting with this for a couple of days but I just figured it out 10 minutes after posting this question.  I'm not sure when but I must have either upgraded VNC Viewer and it changed the default or its settings got whacked recently somehow.\nUnder VNC Viewer → Preferences → Expert there is a Emulate2 setting that needs to be set to True.  The description of the setting says:\n\nAllow a VNC Viewer user to emulate a missing right mouse button by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking.\n\nHere's the description of the Emulate2 setting from the RealVnc page.\nHopefully this helps someone else.\n", "Q: Access Google Drive \"drive\" from terminal? I have installed the Google Drive desktop app and it's available on Finder as a mounted drive, but I can't seem to access it from the terminal. For example, when I do cd 'Google Drive' I get a cd: Permission denied: 'Google Drive/' error. This happens even when I have some files stored locally.\nIs there anyway to do this without explicitly downloading the entire Google Drive folder locally?\nEDIT: cd /Volumes/GoogleDrive produces the same error.\n\nA: On MacOS, Google Drive is setup as network volume.\nWhen accessing Google Drive from terminal the first time:\ncd ~/Google\\ Drive\n\nIt should pop-up the following:\n\nClick OK and you should be able to access it normally.\nIf for whatever reason pop up not showing, then you have to go into System Preferences -> Security & Privacy, click on Files and Folders and add it manually:\n\nYou need to select(check mark) Network Volumes. This step can apply to other application too.\n\nA: Google Drive is found in /Volumes/GoogleDrive. Note the lack of the space character in the name. (I have two external drives: iTunes & TMBackup, which show up in the Volumes directory, naturally.)\n\n", "Q: How to make links open in a virtual desktop browser instead of the second screen? When I use a monitor with my Mac, it's to watch videos and multitask. I'd have a Chrome window open on my main screen in a virtual desktop and another Chrome window open on the monitor. When I switch to another virtual desktop on my main screen, then open a web link, OSX always opens it in the monitor instead of the other virtual desktop. I interacted with the virtual desktop Chrome window last. How can I choose to open links in the virtual desktop?\n\nA: This isn't decided by the last interaction, it's decided by window enumeration.\nBy default, an external link will open in the first window opened in a browser. [Last would be more helpful, but that's not how it works.]\nThe only way to really persuade this to behave is to close all your windows, open one, then move it to the other screen. Then open a second on your main screen.\nThis behaviour may change after a reboot, when the windows open again. If you find a pattern to this, then it's just easiest to not fight it & move the windows to where you want them visually rather than by the contents of each.\n", "Q: How to get Time Machine backup out of \"Backup in use\" state without originating computer I have (well, had) a Late 2013 MacBook Pro running Big Sur backing up via Time Machine to a Time Capsule.   That MacBook died a sudden and horrible death with no chance of ever booting again.\nIn an attempt to restore files from the above backup, I used Migration Assistant on a new M1 MacBook Pro running Monterey.   Migration Assistant tells me \"Backup in use, try again later.\"    The same Time Capsule also houses a MacBook Air backup which is available as a source for restoring files --- unless that MacBook Air is currently backing up via Time Machine, in which case it too causes \"Backup in use, try again later\".\nSo it seems that the Late 2013 MacBook Pro might've died right in the middle of a Time Machine operation, leaving the Time Capsule's sparse bundle in some sort of \"I'm busy dealing with a backup\" state.\nIs there a way I can do something to the Time Capsule's files to force it out of the \"Backup in use\" state?\nMore info: The MacBook Pro backup's sparse disk image bundle is named with a .backupbundle suffix and the MacBook Air's is .sparsebundle -- not sure why or if it's even relevant.\nEven more info: I have not tried rebooting the Time Capsule for two reasons: (a) that MacBook Air is still backing up and (b) I'm afraid pulling the plug will create an even bigger mess with the MacBook Pro's backup.\n\nA: Reboot the Time Capsule to clear the \"Backup in use\" message.\n", "Q: Open and close app at location with Shortcuts I've been getting tired of having to open certain apps and switch network profiles when coming into the office and home.\nIt's not a huge annoyance, more a lazy person's inconvenience.\nBut I was wondering if there was a way of configuring the system based on location?\nI was thinking of using Shortcuts, but if there was something better I'm open to it.\nMy thinking was:\n\n*\n\n*Get the current location\n\n*Check if the location is within 10 meters my contact profile work location addess\n\n*If true:\n\n*\n\n*Switch Network Location to \"Work\" profile\n\n*Open work proxy app\n\n\n\n*If false:\n\n*\n\n*Switch Network location to \"Home\" profile\n\n*Quite work proxy app\n\n\n\nThis was for macOS and not my iPad or iPhone - if possible.\nI tried looking for some of those options in the Shortcut app but couldn't find anything for switching locations or getting my contact profile addresses and narrowing it to work.\n\nA: There is no GPS in Mac so the idea of getting the location within a radius is not possible.

I have:\n\n*\n\n*LandingZone Dock Docking Station for The MacBook Pro [Model A1425 & A1502] with Retina Display (13-inch MacBook)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)\n\n*VGA Display Port Input (Apple)\n\n*HDMI Display Port Input (Apple)\n\n*Three monitors\n\nI want to connect three monitors with my Macbook Pro and DockingStation, however only one of the Display outputs doesn't work from the Macbook Pro while the other works. The docking station does have a built-in HDMI. I just don't know what the problem is, any suggestions on how to resolve this?\n\nA: Your dock is a Thunderbolt (the first version) dock that features an HDMI display connector on the right-hand side and a Mini DisplayPort display connector on the left-hand side. This allows you to connect 2 displays to the dock.\nThe dock itself does not contain a GPU (graphics processing unit) - it merely forwards on the signal from the laptop's own GPU taking up two Thunderbolt ports on the laptop.\nYour laptop features the more recent Thunderbolt 2 standard. It features 2 x Thunderbolt 2 ports, which can be used as display outputs, and a single HDMI port which can also be used as a display output.\nHowever, and this is the cause of your problems, the laptop does not support using all of the display outputs at the same time. The laptop supports using the internal display while using up to 2 external monitors on any combination of those 3 display output ports.\nYou cannot use 3 external displays natively with this computer. The dock doesn't make a difference.\nIn order to get the third display connected you'll need an additional GPU. This can be in the form of a dock featuring DisplayLink, which typically is an USB-connected, low performance GPU - or it can be in the form of an eGPU chassis with a high performance GPU plugged in.\n", "Q: Does Apple run a search engine? Apache logs for my genealogy website show fetches in a single day from many different IP addresses that are subdomains of applebot.apple.com.\nDoes Apple have a search engine?\n\nA: Apple does not have a web site where you can go to search the web in the style of Google, Bing and others.\nApple however does have a web crawler (Applebot) that fetches publicly available web pages for indexing, similar to Google, Bing and others. The index is used for providing search results to those using for example Siri to search the web via voice, or for those using Spotlight Search directly on the desktop in macOS.\n", "Q: How to correctly setup homebrew?

I'd like to be able, from my Mac laptop, to simply click something and switch the remote Mac's audio output setting from its internal speakers to 'Bat Cave', my gen 4 Apple TV.\nAny thoughts about how to accomplish this? I'm more at home with Unix shell scripting than with AppleScript or Automator, but any solution, including hybrid, would be great.\n\nA: Here's how I did it. (Note: this solution requires familiarity with Terminal.app and the ssh command)\n\n*\n\n*@Tetsujin's post above led me to this post which contained an Applescript that did the job.

However, I use a personal Mac and a work Mac at the same desk.\nFrequently switching cables between the two Macs whenever I want to use the display would be annoying. The Studio Display does not offer input switching, and only one of the USB-C / Thunderbolt ports on the back is capable of connecting to the host computer.\nHow can I easily switch Macs connected to the Studio Display?\nIs there a KVM switch (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) switch capable of swapping between Macs connected to the Studio Display?\nI'm looking for something like the old VGA KVM switch below, but for USB-C, Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, or whatever else is needed for the new Apple Studio Display.\nThe switch should ideally pass along the monitor's speakers and webcam, along with any peripherals connected to its USB-C ports.\n\nI'm unable to find any Thunderbolt 3 or 4 KVM switches. Some USB-C KVM switches do seem to exist, but I'm unsure if this new Apple Studio Display works  with them properly. Some state they do not work with Apple or Thunderbolt devices.\nThe same question was asked for the older Apple Thunderbolt Display here:\n\nHow to switch between two Macs and one Thunderbolt Display?\n\n\nA: I was able to switch an Apple Studio Display between a 14\" MacBook Pro (M1 Max) and and a Mac Studio (M1 Ultra) using this CKL KVM, using two generic USB-C to DisplayPort cables from the Macs, and sending the output to the Studio Display with this bi-directional DisplayPort to USB-C cable.\nOnly the video signal is transmitted, so no USB hub, no volume and brightness control from the computer, no speakers, and no webcam.\nI have read that you can resolve those things by ordering this Belkin cable that combines USB and DisplayPort into a single USB-C, but my cable is still on the way from China so I haven't been able to test it yet.\nFinally, a caveat: I was able to switch back and forth as much as I wanted between two Macs, or between one Mac and one iPad Pro, but I could never get it to work with one Mac and one PC's Nvidia GTX 3080 DisplayPort output. Switching from Mac to PC was always fine, but PC to Mac would just leave the screen blank until the monitor was unplugged and plugged back in.\nUpdate 2022-10-06: the Belkin cable arrived, and it does work perfectly from the PC to the Studio Display, including camera and speakers... but not through any KVM or switch that I have found.\nI wound up settling on this USB-C switch, connected to my Mac by this USB-C cable and to my PC by this DisplayPort to USB-C cable. The brightness, camera, and speakers work from the Mac, but not the PC. It is not a true KVM, and needs a separate USB switch to change keyboard/mouse between Mac and PC.\n", "Q: Is it possible to update a MacOS app without requiring admin privilege? I use an app called Workflowy on MacOS. I need to use a separate account on my Mac that doesn’t have admin privileges right now. Whenever Workflowy has an update, I need to enter the admin username and password to install it. This is expected in of itself, but sometimes this happens several times a day, and gets to be quite distracting.\nIf I click cancel here, I’m prompted perhaps 15-30 minutes later. If I move this screen to the bottom right corner of the screen where only the top left corner of the window is visible, I am able to ignore it, but oddly so long as this window is open, Mac needs to run a core at 100% CPU and this drains my battery.\nIs there a way to work around this without getting admin access on this Mac account?\nPS: I've also contacted Workflowy for ideas on their end.\n\n\nA: Since this app has a decent online presence, I’ll assume you’re interested in a general answer. https://workflowy.com/downloads/mac/\nYou don’t need a helper tool for most apps, but some will need them. So the general answer is you should be able to test installing any app in your home folder. If you want to be tidy, make an Applications folder inside your home folder and drop the app there.\nPast that, it’s up to each application to work or not. Keep in mind developers make an intentional choice to not work as a self contained app that can run from anywhere, so you do have to choose what you run just like they choose what to make.\nUntil you hear back from the maker, it’s likely you’re blocked by design here and need to get admin assistance in this specific case.\n", "Q: Are folders under /usr/local/Caskroom needed after installation?

I don't mind skipping that update but I'd love to know if there's a way to stop Xcode from prompting update suggestions.\n\nA: I don't think there is a real way to disable auto updates for Xcode, but in case you are stuck in a update again, you can use Activity Monitor to force quit the updates and or apps.\nYou can always take a look at this thread:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/32672177/xcode-installation-how-to-prevent-automatic-upgrade-of-xcode\nHope it helps\n\nA: I had a similar situation going to Xcode 14.0.1.\nAfter waiting for what I deemed to have been long enough (about a movie's worth), I started killing \"installd\" instances on the command line. Being nice about it wasn't enough, so I -9'd them (sudo kill -9 [pid here]).\nAfter the third or fourth instance the spinner turned into a download progress indicator. Download was normal, and while the install completed on its own, it took a longer time than usual (about 15 minutes).\nMy plan B had been to use the cached Xcode pkg that is helpfully mentioned in the /var/log/install.log and perform a manual install.

Our developer team got new M1 Macbook Pros, and we've noticed that none of our magsafe charge indicators ever turn green (like the old magsafe). They all stay orange while plugged in with the laptop on. Most of these laptops are never unplugged. Even more odd is the battery pref pane shows plugged in charging the whole time with variations in battery level -- perhaps this is the new optimized charging?\nOlder macs showed \"Fully Charged\" even when \"Optimized Battery Charging\" was enabled. But these newer macs always show \"Charging on Hold\" in the battery pref pane (see below). Not a major issue, just curious if this is expected or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: This is the result of enabling the optimized battery charging. Because you never unplug it, the computer is staying at a lower battery percentage.\nYou could test it, by clicking the battery icon and telling it to charge to full, however note that under the battery icon it says \"Rarely used on battery.\" This is what's triggering it, and why some people may comment saying theirs becomes green.

It was called Sent.2020, on the new server, it's named Sent/2020.\nHowever, using Mail.app connexion doctor, I can see that Mail.app is still trying to access Sent.2020 :\nWROTE Apr 14 17:38:30.996 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_2] -- host:mailserver.my.org -- port:993 -- socket:0x60000235c8a0 -- thread:0x600001fb7280\n6.19 SELECT Sent.2020 (CONDSTORE)\n\nREAD Apr 14 17:38:31.010 [kCFStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1_2] -- host:mailserver.my.org -- port:993 -- socket:0x60000235c8a0 -- thread:0x600001fb7280\n6.19 NO SELECT failed\n\nSimilarly creating a submailbox results in the creation of a nonsub mailbox. let's say I want to create a mailbox named \"lastweek\" in mailbox \"Sent\", Mail.app will try to create \"Sent.lastweek\", while it should create \"Sent/lastweek\". In this case a mailbox is created, but Mail.app does not expect this mailbox, and it is a toplevel mailbox, not a submailbox of the Sent mailbox.\nI tried to restart Mail.app, to reconstruct the main mailbox, but this did not produce any change.\nI'd rather not delete and recreate the whole mailserver in Mail.app.\nHow can I explain to Mail.app that the internal mailbox separator has gone from \".\" to \"/\" ?\nEdit\nI know the new separator is a \"/\" because I asked the server with the list command and the list answer indicates a \"/\" as the separator :\n1.0 list \"\" \"%\"\n* LIST (\\HasChildren) \"/\" \"Archives\"\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren \\Drafts) \"/\" \"Drafts\"\netc...\n\n\nA: This new answer points to\n~/Library/Mail/V8/<account identifier>/.mboxCache.plist\nwhere the separator is cached (at the end).

I've broken ssh passwordless logins on MacA and MacB on my LAN. (Catalina and Monterey.) I wanted to write a simple, low-paranoia, no-understanding-required recipe for setting up passwordless ssh for the several users on two local Macs. To start from scratch, I deleted ~/.ssh from each user.\nI gleaned from the many different articles I found that running ssh-keygen (no args) on MacA and accepting the defaults, and then copying the resulting ~/.ssh to a user on MacB would be sufficient to allow me to ssh in as that user, as well as to then ssh back in to MacA.\n(One Linux-oriented source mentioned using ssh-copy-id to copy the public/private keys to MacB. I found this in /usr/bin and tried it, but all it did was create a file in .ssh/ called authenticated_hosts -- it did not copy id_rsa or id_rsa.pub. So I abandoned that.)\nAs a last-ditch effort I used homebrew to install openSSL, but nothing changed.\nAt any rate, once I had duplicate ~/.ssh on both users, with the public and private key files in both and the permissions verified (700 on .ssh, 600 on id_rsa, and 644 on id_rsa.pub), I tried running ssh user@macb.local from MacA, but I'm always prompted for a password.\nI'd appreciate a hand.

You need to copy (or move) that key into a file named ~/.ssh/authorized_keys or ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 in order to authorize it for login.\n(I think this is what ssh-copy-id did. Did you delete the file it created afterward?)\nTry running cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >>~/.ssh/authorized_keys on each of the computers, then try sshing back and forth and see if it works.\nNote: as you pointed out in a comment, it's more common (and probably more secure) to use separate keypairs for each computer. That is, generate a keypair on each of the computers, then use ssh-copy-id to install each one's public key in the other's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. This way you could also authorize MacA's key to other computers, without implicitly authorizing MacB's key.\n", "Q: Can't disable command + shift + I to open mail I followed the answer for disabling command + shift + I to open mail here: How to prevent Command-I/Command-Shift-I from opening Mac Mail when in browser?\n\nHowever, this doesn't work for me.

But I'd rather not spend the $50 on it without knowing for sure that it can be useful for me. And there aren't any detailed breakdowns that I've been able to find for it.\nSo my question is, what, if anything, does Compressor offer a user that HandBrake doesn't, and vice versa? Does Compressor have all the same functionality and could just be a drop-in replacement for it altogether? Is it more/less efficient in its encoding? Aside from the cost and the open source vs closed source debate, is there any good reason to use one over the other for someone working exclusively with M1 Mac machines?\n\nA: You can use it to make presets for FCPX, which can be quite useful.\nOther than that I find the interface to be cumbersome, with the beachball coming up a lot.

This is downloaded as a zip file and therefore does not contain a Bootcamp ESD. Windows on your model Mac should be installed to BIOS boot. This will require the internal installation drive that is MBR or hybrid partitioned. Since Boot Camp Support Software does not contain a $WinPEDriver$ folder there are no drivers to load during the Windows installation. To install the Boot Camp software and any appropriate drivers after completing the Windows installation, see this question.\nYou have indicated that you can boot from a Windows installation USB flash drive. In order to use the Windows installer GUI to install a BIOS booting Windows 10, you have to be able to BIOS boot from the flash drive. This means you need to select the external drive icon labeled Windows from the Mac Startup Manager when booting from the Windows installer flash drive. If you are EFI booting from the Windows installer flash drive, then you can not use the GUI to install a BIOS booting Windows 10 to the internal drive.

How can I permanently compel the Finder to show me hidden files?\nPreviously I've done this by configuring the Mac OS X user defaults system as suggested in this answer:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles true\nkillall Finder\n\nHowever that command does not work on Monterey. Adding a screenshot below of what I've tried.\n\n\nA: The desktop is not the dock is not the finder. So the same one file can exist in all three places visually and be shown differently.\nYou would need to open a finder window and navigate to the desktop folder to see the finder view of the contents of that directory. Both .localized and .DS_Store are specialized files which serve as hidden metadata which will affect how files other than themselves are presented. Most normal document files should be easy to manage as hidden or not but those are special cases.\n\nA: The command referred to does generally work, except for some particular files which I was attempting to look at including .DS_Store and .localized.\n\nA: In any Finder window, press Command+Shift+. This will toggle the show all files (including hidden ones).\n\nA: You very reasonably ask \"How can I permanently compel the Finder to show me hidden files?\". The short answer is you can't! Finder has changed.\nWith Big Sur and even more with Monterey, Finder no longer shows the file system unadulterated. Even with Command+shift+., Finder does not show the full file system.\nThree examples:\n\n*\n\n*The Documents folder as shown by Finder may have extra folders when hidden files are shown. Mine includes a hidden folder called BBEdit which in the file system is ~/Library/Containers/com.barebones.bbedit/Data/Documents. This example is not present in ls -a ~/Documents\n\n\n*When Finder shows the Applications folder it is combining two locations in the underlying file system, that is /Applications and /System/Applications. For example you won't find Mail in ls -a /Applications.\n\n\n*Finder hides some files (even with show hidden files).  As you have found this includes .DS_Store which is always hidden.\nThere are various ways to see the true file system:\n\n*\n\n*The Terminal app and the ls -a command shows the file system.\n\n\n*Use ForkLift from binarynights or other 3rd party Finder replacements. ForkLift is much closer to the true file system. It shows .DS_Store, and doesn't show pretend Documents folders. But it does show the combined view for the Applications folder.\nI presented this as Finder lying about the file system. The alternative view is that Finder shows you what you need to know. Those who want (or even need) to see more will know how to do so!\nNote: In the above I have deliberately referred to Documents and Applications (and not ~/Documents and /Applications) where I am referring to the pseudo-locations presented by Finder.\n", "Q: How to stop different input sources from overriding keyboard shortcuts?

I tried to connect a portable monitor (ASUS ZenScreen (MB16ACV)) that has a single USB-C port (no internal battery) to my iPad (7th generation with Lightning port), using the proper cables. The issue is that the iPad does not send enough power. Would it work connecting both the iPad and the monitor to a powered USB-C hub (with the proper adapting cables)? Or is there another way to power the external display via the iPad?\n\nA: I am not an expert (far from it, just a new hobbyist in the world of electronics) but I would assume that would be the solution. I can't think of another way to connect them. Check out this website by apple to see if it's a possibility, they say it is but then the trouble becomes finding a dongle that will do what you want. Hope it works out.\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/connect-to-a-display-with-a-cable-ipadf1276cde/ipados#:~:text=Plug%20a%20Lightning%20Digital%20AV,display%2C%20TV%2C%20or%20projector.\n\nA: It appears the Asus MB16ACV uses DisplayLink for video.  Maybe it supports some other protocol too, like the much more common DisplayPort protocol, but I could not find an answer on that with a quick look.  This can be a problem since it appears that there's no DisplayLink drivers for iPad.\n(I know DisplayLink and DisplayPort are just too similar looking and can confuse people.  At least I'm confused sometimes.)\nDisplayLink is a means to communicate video by USB.  Built into iPadOS are drivers for a quite a few USB devices, and DisplayLink is not among them.  There's DisplayLink drivers available for download for MacOS, Windows, Android, ChromeOS, and Ubuntu, but not iPadOS.\nWithout drivers iPadOS would see DisplayLink displays as an attached USB device with a vendor ID and product ID that matches nothing in its driver database.  Without iPadOS drivers there's the option to put some kind of device in the middle with sufficient complexity to do the required translation.  This would be almost certainly more costly than a new iPad and portable display.  Perhaps I overestimate the costs but it should not be a leap to at least put it at more than it is worth, or more than other existing options.\nIt's possible to see drivers in the future, but not today.\nI discovered the DisplayLink driver issue while investigating the MB16ACV power consumption.  It consumes up to 15 watts, and that's a lot for a USB device.  Finding a USB-C hub that will provide 15 watts to downstream USB-C ports is not difficult, but it's not universal as there are plenty that provide 7.5 watts.  Power to an upstream port is often not so limited but upstream and downstream have meanings.\nThe USB-C spec requires most USB-C ports to provide up to 7.5 watts, and allows for up to 15 watts before getting into USB-PD or some other optional protocol.  USB-C devices that consume more than 15 watts are pretty well limited to laptops, smart phones, and a few other portable devices.  Anything stationary and with USB-C will plug-in to a utility mains outlet.\nThe physical connection could be done with a Lightning \"camera\" adapter (which even Apple admits supports many USB devices besides cameras), a hub with 15 watt USB-C ports, and a few inexpensive USB cables.  Just to prove such hubs exist I'll give one example. https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/owc-thunderbolt-hub\nI'll go back to my original point, I may be mistaken about DisplayLink as being the only means to get video on the Asus MB16ACV.  If I'm mistaken on the DisplayLink driver issue then I'd appreciate an update.  If there's a Lightning to DisplayPort adapter (and I'm surprised every time I fail to find one) then a DisplayPort to USB-C cable into a USB-C hub should allow for more power to the downstream 15 watt USB-C/DisplayPort ports.  If MST support grows then the hub can likely support more than one display.\nThat was long.

I have no idea why that would happen so I removed it.\nMy process was as follows:\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/efi\nsudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/efi\n\nThen I deleted the whole efi folder and unmounted the volume.\nThis removed rEFInd and the scaling issue was fixed. I can't remember if I tried rebooting by holding down the option key or not so it's possible the Windows boot option was removed at this point and I hadn't noticed. Perhaps it was from what I did next.\nI then tried to install rEFIt boot manager to see if that was any better. I ran the package but didn't move over the efi folder to the root. I suppose I may still be half way through the installation?\nAt this point I'd lost faith in boot managers and wanted to just try installing Xubuntu and seeing if grub2 would work. I haven't yet got to that point because I have now noticed I can't boot to Windows bootcamp.\nIf I hold the option key when rebooting, it no longer appears. Even if I change the startup disk to Bootcamp, it boots to Mac anyway.\nHave I removed something needed for Windows to boot when removing the /Volumes/efi folder. The video I was following just removed it, but perhaps they didn't have bootcamp and didn't need to do something different.\nI have considered continuing the rEFIt install, because perhaps that is the issue. But I thought I'd ask for help at this point, because I don't want do something worse because I'm not really confident that continuing rEFIt will work.\nJust to clarify what I did, I mounted the rEFIt.dmg and ran the rEFIt.mpkg; that is all. The next steps would have been to run the 'enable-always.sh' script and to moved the 'efi' folder to the root. Could only running rEFIt.mpkg and not continuing with the rest cause this issue with Windows?\nI've tried following videos for how to removed rEFIt. It says to remove the 'efi' folder from the root (I didn't have that anyway), and to remove the folder from /Library/StartUpItems (I also didn't have anything there either).\nAnd finally, to make matters worse, I also resized the MacintoshHD partition to make a 35GB partition for Xubuntu. And in writing this post, it has suggested another thread from someone who said they lost the ability to boot into Windows after resizing the partition.

I did a rather careless thing while in disk recovery (I was wiping a MacBook Pro 2018 for re-use) and I accidentally deleted the root volume, which means everything.\nBecause I don't have a recovery partition, I can't get the network recovery console to reinstall.\nAnd because I didn't enable booting via USB before doing this, I can't even get a bootable installer to work.\nWhat options do I have here that don't involve a trip to the Apple store and lightening of my wallet, if any?\n\nA: You do not need a local recovery partition to use recovery from the internet. Apple created \"Internet Recovery\" booting for this very case, (and other situations) where an internal drive's Recovery partition isn't available.\nYour Mac will: get online before actually starting up, load the minimal OS it needs to run, and offer to download and reinstall macOS right—all right from the internet.\nApple has instructions for Intel-based Mac macOS Recovery (and Apple Silicon Macs). With your 2018 Mac, you'll hold ⌘ ⌥ R (command-option-r) for the latest compatible macOS or ⌘ ⌥ ⇧ R (command-option-shift-r) for your Mac's original version.\nApple firmware will also see any local NetBoot servers and bootable USB and FireWire drives.

(Xfce or unity-like would be nice)\n\nMy major concern is the default window management.

I end up creating more and more terminals or Firefoxes.\n\n*Side-by-side, non-fullscreen view seems to have no shortcut (Mac's side-by-side triggers fullscreen mode)\n\n\nA: On the assumption that there isn't really a viable alternative desktop environment, I would answer some of your underlying issues:\nFirstly, note that unlike Windows, you don't normally create multiple instances of applications. Firefox with multiple windows is one app process with lots of windows, not lots of Firefox processes. Consequently, macOS creates an organizational hierarchy, in which you first switch between applications, and then switch between that app's windows.\nmacOS provides several methods to move between apps and windows.\nCommand Tab switches between open applications -- it doesn't open apps. If you want to open apps, you have the Dock, or Launchpad, or the Applications folder itself.\nYou can also cycle between the current app's windows with Command`.\nMission Control CTRLup can show you all the windows of all the open applications. This can be a bit cluttered: there is an option to group windows by application (System Prefs > Mission Control), which helps.\nApplication Windows CTRLdown will show you all the open windows for the current application only.\nYou can change these keys to F-keys or other things in System Preferences.\nYou can also see the open windows for an application list when you right click on its icon in the Dock.\nBy default, the green button on a window invokes Full Screen mode, which hides the menubar. If you hold Alt/option when you click on it, that should maximize the window. There are also options when you hover over the green button, or right-click on it. There are third-party utilities to improve window sizing and positioning.\nI would recommend not minimizing/Hiding windows and apps. You're right that it can be difficult to identify whether something is up and running or not.  (However, right-click on the Dock icon will show you open windows, with a lozenge in front of hidden windows.)\nThere are settings to configure how an application behaves with respect to Desktops. (right-click on the app's icon in the Dock, and look under Options. So an app can be locked to a specific Desktop space, or to a display (if you have multiple displays).\nNormally, clicking on an app's icon will switch to whichever Desktop space has the app's window.\nIf Desktop spaces are changing order, then  uncheck \"Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\" in System Preferences > Mission Control.\n\nA: You can install a separate desktop environment such as Xfce - but that would limit you to apps that uses the X window system protocol. I.e. that would be apps that you are probably familiar with from systems such as Linux. This usually also means that you loose all of the macOS platform specific features of such apps. I.e. it's not really a viable choice for most.\nAnother path to take would be to try to configure or otherwise modify the macOS desktop environment to your likings. There exists a huge number of third party applications that change stuff like how window management works, add keyboard shortcuts, etc. For example these:\n\n*\n\n*Rectangle (free)\n\n*Amethyst (free)\n\n*Veer (free)\n\n*Hammerspoon (free)\n\n*ShiftIt (free, unmaintained)\n\n*Size (commercial)\n\n*Magnet (commercial)\n\n*Grid (commercial)\n\n*Moom (commercial)\n\n*Mosaic (commercial)\n\n*Divvy (commercial)\n\n*BetterSnapTool (commercial)\n\n*Swish (commercial)\n\nFor ensuring that your windows stay where you want them, consider for example these:\n\n*\n\n*Stay (commercial)\n\n*Display Maid (commercial)\n\nWhich of those to use is largely a matter of personal preference.\nAlso there's the way of simply getting used how things work on macOS before changing everything. For example your impression that the maximize button \"doesn't work\" probably comes from the fact that you're used to other windowing systems like Windows where the maximize button is used to change the size of the window to fit the desktop - on macOS this button is used to change the size of the window to fit the contents of that window. That is a much harder task than just fitting the desktop, and some application developers do not provide the necessary support for this feature (by declaring the size of window contents) - and therefore you can have edge cases, where this doesn't work as expected.\nNote that macOS also has the \"maximize to fit desktop\" feature. On a standard setup, you can get that by holding down the Option key and pressing the green plus button in the top, left part of a window.\n", "Q: Is there a list/graph of all symbols for a Swedish/Finnish keyboard? I switched to a physical Swedish/Finnish keyboard to save my sanity (too many ä and ö I need to type), but I noticed many symbols are poorly documented, and do not match the equivalent Windows keyboard.  For instance, the symbols | and \\ are not where a Windows keyboard puts them (and also, the Windows keyboard does show where these symbols are).  Same is for [] and {}.  I looked online for a quick guide of where the symbols are in an Apple Swedish/Finnish keyboard, but I am still to find one.  I thought Apple would provide it, but I failed to find it.\nDoes anybody has a list or a picture showing all the symbols one can produce with Option and Option + Shift?\n\nA: It's built-into the OS. Keyboard Viewer\nTo be able to get to it rapidly… System Prefs > Keyboard > Input Sources > Show input menu in menu bar.\nThen you can get to it from the menu\n\n\nHolding various combinations of Shift / Opt will let you see all the glyphs available directly from keyboard combos. Orange keys are dead-keys, which will add an accent to the next-pressed key. Swedish is amongst the few which has permanent dead+keys without needing Opt.\nThe glyphs you're looking for in Swedish all appear to be on the number keys 7, 8, 9.\nThe appearance of this panel has changed in recent macOS, but the functionality is very similar.\nAbove is Mojave, below is Big Sur. The actual layout you will see depends on your physical keyboard too.\n\n", "Q: Problems with searching in finder, spotlight and file-management on Mac I got some problem with indexing of disk, Spotlight, searching in finder and file-management.(MacBook m1 2020)\nFinder is loading a lot of time, searching in it does not work, Spotlight does not work and rotation of files from dir to dir also works a lot of time.\nI tried to reindex disk like on man of Apple. I tried to do that from terminal with sudo mdutil -a -i off/on in common and safe mode and\nsudo mdutil -a -i off\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\nsudo mdutil -a -i on\n\nby turning off System Integrity Protection. Also I reinstalled OS (moneterey 12.3.1 now). One more thing, that when I wrote sudo mdutil -a -i on in terminal in safe mode, it told me, that \"indexing and searching not working\" or something close to this. I tried to \"heal\" it with Disk Utility but it didn't show any problems with it. So I tried to find \"metadata_never_index\" and fix it, but there is no success.\nApple Tech-support said that it could be problem in core of mac and some script could be root of this problem. May be there are some problem in my script, which killed my part of system? Or how can I fix problem with finder long loading and \"System properties -> Spotlight -> confidentiality\" long loading. After it loaded and I add my disk in list, it gave me error like on first screen.\n1 : Exception list error. Failed to add or remove object due to an unknown error.\n2 : script\nEDIT:\n3 : I got it after running sudo mdutil -E /\n\nA: The usual procedure to reindex Spotlight is just:\nsudo mdutil -E /\n\nYou should not need to do anything else. Turning off SIP and unloading the Spotlight LaunchDaemons is unnecessary and may cause more problems.\nOther things to look at are to check that the disk is formatted to APFS; and remove any manual alterations you have made to the system environment.\nYou may have to erase, install the OS, and then transfer your software.\n", "Q: How can I see whether or not my M1 Macbook is memory constrained or not? My Macbook M1 is experiencing severe performance issues at times, but I have hard time finding any hard data that shows what the issue is. htop shows lots of free memory and cpu, yet it seems as if the machine is thrashing extensively (stuttering, programs freezing for multiple seconds unresponsive, etc) under load. Where can I look to know what the issue is?\nI am a developer and use Docker, IntelliJ and Node (webpack create-react-app watch task running, consuming 10-30% cpu constantly) a lot. These usually can consume a lot of resources, but when I look at htop I see that only about 3GB of 8GB RAM is consumed. That should indicate that I am not running out of memory, right?\nStill, it seems as if I am being tricked by these stats: my work desktop computer has 64GB of RAM and an i9 CPU (on paper weaker than the M1), but has no such issues under similar conditions (same project, same programs running, etc.) To me, this indicates that memory is the issue, but I want to see some data supporting this. Where do I look?\nThe fact that I get multi-second stalls and switching between IntelliJ and Terminal could take a few seconds gives me the impression that we are talking about memory-paging to disk being a factor. htop does show between 6 and 8 GB being swapped to disk. Modern OS-es do cache a lot of stuff, so this is not that surprising, still, I am wondering why I am not using most of my RAM, if this really is the case?\nI mentioned IntelliJ, but this also affects using Chrome and iTerm. Quitting Docker (and the associated processes) seems to lighten the perceived load a bit and the amount of memory swapped out usually goes down by 1 GB or so, which again seems to point to memory.\n\n\nHardware: Macbook 2020 with Apple M1, 256GB, 8GB RAM.\n\nA: I'd guess the difference is going to be the RAM, causing it to swap a lot. I see the same on a 16GB M1 iMac, but not on a 10-year-older 64GB Mac Pro.\n\n\nBoth Macs have about a month uptime since last reboot. Photoshop is obviously taking a good share on each, yet as each is at present, it causes no swap issues. The iMac though has one large task which isn't running at the moment. When that weighs in too, it starts to get bogged down. Even switching over to Safari you can see it needs about 5 seconds to fully activate the current page.\nI'm actually mildly surprised the Mac Pro at the bottom is showing any swap at all. It very rarely does.\nPersonally, I don't think 16GB is enough these days.\nBTW, I've long since given up trying to match these numbers with htop & the like. I tend to just rely on Memory Used, Swap & the graph on the left. You can soon tell when it's struggling using just those three.\n\nA: I thought I would add some information on looking into these numbers myself, just to add some information. Although I found some nice tools with numbers (vmmap) in another thread, the basic conclusion for this issue is the same as Tetsuin:\n\nI've long since given up trying to match these numbers with htop & the like.\n\nInspecting the numbers for memory in use, swap and others before and after loading some big-ass programs (4GB just to Docker) hardly showed any difference. The graph did move up a notch, though, and is prolly the best bet: if seeing the bar have hints of red in it, memory pressure is severe and the swapping will make a huge difference to the perceived performance.\nThis is the memory after killing a bunch of programs, then starting Node (the first bump into yellow), then starting IntelliJ (the second bump, this time memory constrained to 1500MB).\n\nThe performance is great (no swapping causing stuttering and freezes), so trying actively to avoid swapping seems like a good bet :p Obviously, Docker seems like to big of a beast to be running on this machine, consuming 4GB or so (according to the Activity Monitor) and limiting the heap memory of IntelliJ also seemed to help:\n\nThis was set to use up to 5500 MB and it obviously caused issues. 1500 MB seems like a happy compromise on this machine.\n", "Q: I installed Xubuntu without installing rEFind. Is it safe to remove the linux partition at this point? \nThis is continuation from my previous question \"I removed the rEFInd and rEFIt boot managers and now I've lost Windows Bootcamp from the Mac Startup Manager\", where I now can boot Windows from the Mac Startup Manager.\n\nI heard some people had success with installing Ubuntu and using grub on a Mac. The problem is, I ignored the vast majority of people who said it caused issues, and didn't install rEFInd first.\nNow when I boot the computer, I get the grub boot menu, with options for Xubuntu and Windows bootloader. Xubuntu obviously works, Windows doesn't (I just get a black screen and have to hold the power button to shutdown). I can access the Mac side by pressing escape on grub and typing exit.\nI wanted to test if some software would run better on Linux; it doesn't, so I'm happy to remove the linux partition and go back to how it was with Mac and Windows.\nI just wanted to check if it's ok to remove the Linux partition from the Mac side.

Here I will assume the HDD is disk0.\nsudo diskutil mount disk0s1\ncd /Volumes/EFI/EFI\nrm -rf BOOT\nrm -rf ubuntu\ncd ~\ndiskutil unmount disk0s1\n\nSince the free space occurs immediately after the partition identified as disk0s2, this free space can be added back to macOS.

I recently got a dock / hub for my MacBook. A single USB-C connection provides power and connects it to my external monitor, keyboard, and mouse.\nWhen I'm actually using the computer, I always have the lid open. Whenever the lid is closed, I want it to sleep. But it doesn't. Even if I explicitly click Apple -> Sleep, it will wake if the mouse is jiggled slightly, so I find the monitors turning on when I'm not using the computer.\nIs there a setting for \"remain asleep until the lid is opened\"?\n\nA: I unplug the cable and let it sleep in this case. At work, I have a Logitech MX Keys keyboard and mouse and will sometimes unplug that USB Radio Dongle to keep it asleep as I want it to run but not wake if someone jostles the mouse.\nWaking up while in clamshell mode is baked into the firmware so I don’t think there’s an obvious way to disable it.\nSomething like the Twelve South BookArc (or perhaps a solid wood / black walnut wood stand) work very well for me to make the cable swap a snap.\n", "Q: gpg-agent running but command line tools missing When I was trying to configure my gpg-agent, there were was no command line tool i.e. /usr/local/bin/gpg-agent doesn't exist (nor does it exist in the other dirs in my PATH variable: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/texlive/2022/bin/universal-darwin\nI'm running an M1 MacBook Pro, Monterey 12.3.1; I don't know what version of gpg-agent is running because I can't find it; also running gpg 2.3.4.\nThis is a brand new machine and MacOS is very unfamiliar to me: I normally run Arch Linux but this is a work machine.\nThis is confusing to me because I found a gpg-agent process running using top and similar programs.

I've found it helps to first recognize exactly how it attaches, to understand how the pieces can fit together and will later move correctly during use.\nThe top and bottom of that key cap are attached to the scissor mechanism in two different ways. To reinstall it, you must slide the key almost parallel to the keyboard surface to hook the two \"shelf\" hooks (top of your pictures) successfully first, then press the \"grabber\" claws (bottom of your pictures) straight toward the keyboard to pop into place around the cylinders they hold.\nIf the bottom grabbers have attached first, they must be re-removed since they hold the scissor and cap shelves exactly aligned with each other. Forcing the aligned shelves past each other will just bend and damage the plastic.\nBecause the key \"well\" is such a tight fit on some of Apple's keyboards, the key cannot slide its shelves onto the scissor's shelves with the scissor mechanism in the lowered position pictured. You may be able to coax it up, but you can't see what's happening under the key cap. If you're not confident the shelves are hooked, don't push and risk ruining it. I usually slide something very thin under the an axle on one side of the scissor to hold it up. That makes it much easier to confidently slide the shelves together with no pressure. Then just press the bottom of the key down straight toward the keyboard and the grabbers will pop into place.\n", "Q: Safari search bar won't autofill anymore It's been a couple of weeks now since autofill on Safari's search bar suddenly stopped working.\nIf I quit (CommandQ) and reopen Safari, everything works fine, but after a few minutes, the search bar doesn't autocomplete what I am typing.\nActually, the whole search bar gets blocked, and I can't even see the preview of any open tab in Safari (see picture below):\n\nThe only thing that solves the issue is to quit Safari, which is  quite annoying. Any hints?\n\nA: Did you maybe turn off \"Show search engine suggestions\" in the Search tab in Preferences? Or any of the options for \"Smart Search Field\"?\n\nA: It seems like this behavior is so abnormal that it is likely a corruption or problem with your system, as opposed to an error in the setup or configuration of Safari that could be fixed. So you will just have to do troubleshooting until something works. Some possibilities:\n\n\n*Disable all extensions.\n\n\n*Turn off and on the Smart Search settings:\n\n\n\n*Delete the Safari Autofill corrections database at ~/Library/Safari/AutoFillCorrections.db\n\n\n*And/or all of the files in that directory could be the issue.\n\n\n*Observe that directory after you start Safari- do any of the files get modified at the same time the problem in Safari occurs? Also check the Preferences files at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari*\n\n\n*Delete the Safari cache files at ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/\nSo, no magic bullets here, just some things to try. Good luck.\n", "Q: Mojave 10.14.6 is it possible to specific folder icons links in the finder context menu? Being a 25 plus year daily Mac user I should be able to figure this out, but I'm lost. I'd like to create a clickable folder link in the context menu - hovering over it to see the contents if said folder would be a bonus. Specifically I want the context menu to show items stored on the desktop, but other folder/location links would be great too. The old Finder Pop utility did this well, but won’t run on newer OS.\nCan this be set up on macOS Mojave?\n\nA: It should be easy enough to create an Automator workflow that just opens a specific folder in a new window. Save it as a Service, and it will appear in Contextual menus.\nThere's an Automator action \"Reveal Finder Items\" that will do this. You would need to use \"Get Specified Finder Items\" before it, to select the location you want in each Service. Then just save each Service as the name of the location it opens.\nHowever, the point of a contextual menu, as the name suggests, is that the items in the menu relate to the object being right-clicked on, rather than being 'general'.\nIn the Finder, you can access the Desktop, Applications folder, Home, etc from the Go menu, or with the keyboard shortcuts shown there, e.g. Shift Command D for Desktop, Shift Command A for Applications; Shift Command H for Home...\nAlternatively, there are apps like Devontech's Xmenu utility, which allows for navigable file hierarchies from the menubar.\n\n\nA: @benwiggy - thanks for the thoughtful and helpful response - I have Xmenu installed and will probably begin to train myself to use it...it does precisely what I'm want, just not in the Mac OS context menus. For some reason, I've never availed myself of the \"Go\" menu very much for navigation, over the years.\nThe keyboard shortcuts are great and really what I should be using.\nMaybe it's nostalgia and old habits, but there a few things that I just prefer using the mouse to accomplish...\nBtw: As of 10.14.6, Apple has done away with the \"Service\" option when opening a new document in Automator - it's now \"Quick Action\", and there's no \"Save As\" (a Service) menu item. Using your suggestion, I created a Quick Action which appears (albeit as a sub menu link) in the finder context menu, but only when control clicking on a folder. Which led me to narrow down what my original question should have been - \"is there a way to modify and add a clickable location link (desktop etc) to the finder's Desktop context menu?\" That was it. Perhaps there's an action in Automator to accomplish this, and I'll poke around.\nThe preference pane FinderPop that ceased to be supported in High Sierra  was really an elegant solution and hack for ALL finder context menus - super easy to congigure etc...old habits ;o\n\n\n\nA: If you can’t find a utility that works as expected, the next best thing it to bring these recents / automation to the open and save dialogs.\nThe long time champion for this is Default Folder X - https://www.defaultfolder.com/DefaultFolderX/index.html\n\n*\n\n*Track recently used files in every app\n\n*Reopen recently closed Finder windows\n\nIt has many, many features but the two above give excellent results and don’t need a lot of training / change in process to benefit from immediately.\n", "Q: Shortcuts.app Copy Image Text The Shortcuts app can be run from the CLI:\nshortcuts run 'Extract Image Text' -i /Users/rich/Desktop/alpha.png -o /Users/rich/Desktop/imagetext.txt\n\nHowever, the structure of the actual Shortcut is confusing.

Got the laptop, a MacBook Pro (2021, M1 Pro 16\"), on March 29th, 2022.\nTypical day: I leave home with 100% battery, go work in cafés or co-working spaces, and don't plug it unless it hits the 10% battery warning.\nPeople have been saying the battery is great on it and so I got curious, wanting to find out how long it lasts and whether I should take a charger with me.\nHere's what I've got:\n\n*\n\n*On 2022-04-01: used it for close to 12 hours before getting the 10%-battery warning.\n\n*On 2022-04-11: used it for 8 hours before getting the 10%-battery warning.\n\n*On 2022-04-21: I used it for 6h16 before getting the 10%-battery warning.\n\nThis is in usage time, excluding any break, lunch, etc.\nMy work on it has been the same throughout the month: webdev work, of the same nature throughout the month, with the same software running. I use Docker, which is said to consume a lot of battery, but I was using it at the beginning of the month just the same.\nMy questions are:\n\n*\n\n*Does this look normal?\n\n*How can I measure battery life more accurately? (via software, instead of my taking notes.)\n\n\nA: 1. Does this look normal?\nApps like Coconut Battery provide detailed information about the state of your battery - particularly the current percentage of 'Design capacity' e.g. how much it can charge compared to it's original or intended size.\nThey also keep a history log of your battery's cycles (though not the discharge time).\nThis should, at the least, give you sufficient grounds to ascertain whether your battery is in 'good health', or not.\nAssuming the battery is in good health, then Yes, the time you get is 'normal'  --    for your usage. There could be a runaway process, or other software inefficiencies, of course. Different or updated software may provide longer work time.\n2. How can I measure battery life more accurately?\nYou may know the old XKCD cartoon about estimating the time left to copy files:\n\nAny attempt to measure your battery life is at best an estimate, because no one knows exactly how much processing the computer is going to do in the future. They're just averaging what you've done so far and extrapolating.\nAs a web developer, you'll apreciate that websites like Facebook are going to use much more energy than a simple HTML page. So your dev work will similarly be variable, and not consistent. There may also be underlying, scheduled tasks that the OS might start doing.\nYou can use Activity Monitor's Energy panel to see what tasks are using the most CPU (and how much). You can also see how much total CPU is being used.\n\nThere is an estimate of time there -- Apple removed the time estimate from the menulet (likely because people would get upset when the estimate didn't hold up.)\n\nNote that the \"Time on Battery\" includes Sleep. I'll be very surprised to get over 15 hours, if I actually do some work...!\n", "Q: Recover HFS volume, missing partition UUID I am attempting to follow the answer post at https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/231027.\nHowever, the third partition does not have a listed UUID.

The exact format of an entry is given in the following GUID partition entry format table, which was copied from Wikipedia.\n\n\n\n\nOffset\nLength\nContents\n\n\n\n\n 0 (0x00)\n16 bytes\nPartition type GUID (mixed endian[7])\n\n\n16 (0x10)\n16 bytes\nUnique partition GUID (mixed endian)\n\n\n32 (0x20)\n 8 bytes\nFirst LBA (little endian)\n\n\n40 (0x28)\n 8 bytes\nLast LBA (inclusive, usually odd)\n\n\n48 (0x30)\n 8 bytes\nAttribute flags (e.g. bit 60 denotes read-only)\n\n\n56 (0x38)\n72 bytes\nPartition name (36 UTF-16LE code units)\n\n\n\nPartition Type GUID\nYou do not have to assign any GUIDs to a missing block. If you omit the -t option from the gpt add command, a partition type GUID of 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC will be used. You can specify any GUID as an argument to the -t option. No checking is preformed by the gpt add command to see if the entered GUID has been associated with a existing partition type. Common partition type GUIDs are listed in Wikipedia. You can also specify one of the following aliases as an argument to the -t option.\n\n\n\n\nAlias Argument\nActual GUID Used\n\n\n\n\nefi\nC12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n\n\nhfs\n48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n\n\napfs\n7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n\n\nlinux\nEBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7\n\n\nwindows\nEBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7\n\n\n\n\nWith macOS (OS X) the partition type GUID usually has to match the type of data stored in the corresponding partition. For example, if the data is a valid Mac OS Extended Journaled (JHFS+) volume and the partition type GUID is EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7, then the volume will not mount.\nUnique Partition GUID\nThe gpt add command does not have a option for specifying an unique partition GUID for a GPT entry. The gpt add command leaves the existing unique partition GUID unchanged unless the value is 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. If the case where the existing unique partition GUID is 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000, the gpt add command sets the GUID to a newly generated value.\nI should point out that when the gpt remove command sets the partition type GUID of a GPT entry to 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000, the corresponding unique partition GUID is left unchanged. Also, the gpt create command sets the partition type GUID of each GPT entry to 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 and sets the unique partition GUID for each GPT entry to a newly generated value.\nOther GUIDs\nThe data stored in a partition defined by a GPT entry may also contain one or more GUIDs. The gpt add command has no options where any of these GUIDs would be used as a argument.\n\nOriginal Answer\nBeing that the disk in the other question was assume to have a sector size of 4096 bytes and your disk has a sector size of 512 bytes, some numbers will need to be scaled by 8. So I would try the following.\ngpt add -b 488345872 -i 3 -s 32768 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk1\n\nIn order for this to work, there would also need to be a recovery volume stored at this location on disk1.\n", "Q: System-wide Copy (not Paste) without formatting Is there any way to copy text (not paste) without copying the accompanying formatting? In some programs, you may have an option to paste just the text to strip off any formatting copied with the text, but in other programs there is no such option - it’s just a straight paste (with any formatting coming along with it).  I want to know if there is any way to copy only the text so there is no formatting to have to worry about.\n\nA: No, but there are ways to remove formatting from the text in the Clipboard, so that pasting will be format-free.\nI use this Terminal sequence:\npbpaste | pbcopy\n\nwhich takes the existing clipboard text and 'rinses' it through raw text.\nI have this in a shell script, which I can call from the scripts menulet.\nOr you can paste into a plain text editor, like BBEdit, and then copy again.\n", "Q: What keys are ⇧ and ⌥ I see the following Mac keyboard shortcuts defined in software documents all the time, for example in Keyboard shortcuts for macOS.\n\n*\n\n*⇧\n\n*⌥\nIronically, I can't seem to find which keys on the keyboard these symbols indicate.

Where can I find a roadmap for Xcode to know if Apple intends to provide another 13.2 update?\nI foolishly upgraded my iPhone to iOS 15.4.1 without first checking if Xcode 13.2.1 supports it. I can't upgrade Xcode to 13.3 without first upgrading macOS to 12. I've heard some horrible problems (memory management) exist for that release and I'm wanting to wait a bit longer before upgrading from macOS 11.6.5. And there's no telling what other programs (e.g. VMware Fusion) I might have to upgrade after a macOS upgrade.\n\nA: It is unlikely there will be another version of Xcode 13.2 that supports both macOS 11.6.5 and iOS 15.4.1.\nIf there is another update, such as a security update (which typically doesn't happen, but plausibly could), it wouldn't change compatibility.\n", "Q: How can I find the associated event to the notification counter next to a calendar in Apple's Calendar app?

The catch is that the duplicates don't have any EXIF data. I've sampled the file names and when I search in the apple photos UI they show up (eg. they exist) they have metadata, etc.\nI've tried exporting the photos and importing again to see if photos would pick up that they are duplicates. Photos did not pick up on that. I even tried it after completely renaming the photos from jpeg to jpg.\nI think I can delete them, but I want to be sure. I think I need a way to get all of the file names in Apple Photos, if possible so I can cross-check if the duplicate files truly are duplicates or not.\n\nA: Since your duplicates don't have any EXIF data, would it help if you created a smart album of photos with Focal length-is-Empty (AND Aperture, ISO, Camera model, Shutter speed are empty) conditions?\nIf you know SQL and can be very, very careful: Right-click your Photos library (normally it's in the Pictures folder), and select Show Package Contents. From the Database folder, open the Photos.sqlite database with DBBrowser or similar, open the ADDITIONALASSETATTRIBUTES table, and sort the ZORIGINALFILENAME column in ascending or descending order. Copy the column and paste in a new Excel or whatever file. Do not modify the Photos.sqlite file in any way, otherwise your Photos library will be corrupted.\n\n\nA: If you end up wanting a tool that looks at all the metadata and intelligently picks the larger or HEIC or edited / unedited copy of the photos and also keeps your albums sane while it removes the duplicates, you want this tool.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.fatcatsoftware.com/powerphotos/\nYou can iterate over all the files in the filesystem, use mdls or an exif tool to parse and catalog the attributes in addition to the file name which don’t need to be unique but unless you do the export, wipe the database and reload it, you’re still on the hook for managing the library database.\n", "Q: Dock alternative respecting virtual Desktops I'm searching a replacement for Apple's Dock.\nConstraints:\n\n*\n\n*Should look/work similar to Windows 7's task bar\n\n*No Window groupings\n\n*Don't show windows of other virtual Desktops\n\n*\n\n*↑ This is very important and the reason for opening a new question on this topic.\n\n\n\n*paid / free ok\n\nWhat I've found\nThere are several tools out there. ubar is often mentioned.

Likewise for Chrome, when I go back there after fixing the iTerm2 search, it now has \"###\" in the search bar.\nThe issue is more than just having to retype my search every time. When I search in Chrome, it begins an active search in iTerm2 that I didn't tell it to search for.  It's annoying switching back to iTerm2 and seeing yellow highlighting all over for things I didn't search for there.\n\nA: A workaround specific to iTerm2:\nFor iTerm2 you can use Shift+Command+F which opens a \"Find Globally\" search which is private to iTerm2.

For instance, letters h, n, space bar, 6, and F5 activate the y key; letters j, m, space bar, 7, and F6 activate the u key. Actually, for the case of letter u, whenever I press it, it stays pressed for random periods of time (also when I press the keys above or below it in the diagonal).\nI have followed this YouTube tutorial in order to clean \"stuck keys\". However, this did not solve the problem. I have bought it second hand, so I do not know if there has been liquid damage before. Every other key works fine. Does this problem has a solution? Or is the keyboard dead?\n\nA: I miraculously made it work after following this tutorial twice. The second time, since I did not have high hopes, I was a little more generous with the alcohol and I took off every key. So what worked for me was:\n\n*\n\n*took off all of the keys and the plastic mechanism for each key\n\n*used a generous amount of alcohol to clean each spot (a little more than in the tutorial but without exaggerating either);\n\n*used classic ethyl alcohol at 70%;\n\n*submerge the keys and the mechanisms in soapy water (used dish soap) for one hour or so and rub with cloth afterwards;\n\n*left it all to dry for 12 hours;\n\n*placed the keyboard in front of a dehumidifier for about 15 minutes before putting the keys back in place.\n\nFor the last step, I am sure that direct sunlight for a fair amount of time would have worked as well, but the sky was cloudy that day in my case.\nAdditional notes: this keyboard was not particularly dirty or clogged with anything. There were eyelash/cat-like hair pieces in a \"normal\" amount and common dirt. What I did notice was some metallic glitter below the plastic mechanism in some keys, I do not know if these could be causing shorts or something similar...

Since this Mac router uses NAT without port forwarding capabilities, the IP address assign to a device inside the new LAN can not be used by devices outside the new LAN to establish a connection. I was able to confirm that an iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013), booted to either macOS 10.15.7 (Catalina) or macOS 10.13.6 (High Sierra), can reach http websites on the new LAN. Your MacBook Pro should have been able to reach a website hosted by a properly configured Widget on the new LAN. Otherwise, macOS 12.3.1 (Monterey) has a bug that did not exist in earlier macOS releases.\nThe arp -a command does identify any IP addresses assigned by the Mac to devices in the new LAN. The 169.254 IPs appearing in your arp -a listing may be currently unused entries. You might try entering sudo arp -ad to delete all entries before entering arp -a.\nIt is possible configure a Mac to pass thru (allow the widget to obtain an IP from the router). However, this at least depends on the version of macOS (OS X) and may depend on the Mac model. I tested using a iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013) and macOS 10.15.7 (Catalina). The instructions are given in jksoegaard's answer to the question \"How do I bridge a wifi connection from MacOS\" and the Apple website \"Bridge virtual network interfaces on Mac\". Below are a few addition points to be added.\n\n*\n\n*Creating the Bridge interface removes any corresponding Ethernet interface and Wi-Fi interface. This means the Mac losses Wi-Fi internet access.\n\n*While this worked under macOS 10.15.7 (Catalina), the same procedure failed to work properly properly under macOS 10.13.6 (High Sierra).\n\n*If you remove the Bridge interface, any Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces, that were removed when the bridge was created, need to be added back in.\n\n", "Q: What software program can I use to build a custom desktop keyboard IME for MacOS? I would like to make my own version of Mac's ABC-Extended keyboard for typing Pinyin (a way to write Mandarin that indicates tones). But when I use Xcode, I just see a target custom keyboard extension for iOS and nothing for macOS. I've looked into the program Ukulele but it doesn't seem like it will do everything I need. Theoretically I could also put my rules into files like how this article indicates but that also seems cumbersome based on what I want my keyboard to do.\nHere's what I want it to do:\n\n*\n\n*First option: user literally types \"ni3 hao3\" and my logic in real time changes their output to \"nǐ hǎo\" (there are pinyin/grammar rules for where the tone mark goes)\n\n*Secondly (phase 2 in my project), in their user settings for the keyboard, they could indicate they want to convert their text to Hanzi (the characters). So when they type their Pinyin, my algorithm guesses a best guess list of Hanzi characters that matches their Pinyin entry. This would require that I have a downloaded dictionary file for my keyboard.\n\nThanks for any help! I know how to program it I just need the right software to use :(\n\nA: One option (but probably not practical for a project of the scope you envision) would be to use Apple's own Custom IM creator.\nAn example of one of these for only ni3 hao3 can be downloaded here.\n", "Q: Shell script error 127 I am not knowledgeable about shell scripting, but I'm using a command for merging files together, which works great on my computer, but when I move it to someone else's computer, it generates error 127.\nThe initial variable setup include also this:\nset Processing to path to resource \"Processing\"\nset AppendWorkflow to Processing & \"AppendIndesignPDFPages.workflow\" as string\nset AppendWorkflow to quoted form of (POSIX path of AppendWorkflow)\n\nThe command I use in the longer script and that are generating the error are these:\n    set command to \"/usr/bin/automator \" & AppendWorkflow\n    set output to do shell script command\n\nWhen working correctly (that is all the time in my computer) I get a set of merged documents into a single PDF.

Since I don't know enough about shell scripting, I can't tell if I have it or not.\nAny hints to a solution?\nThanks.\n\nA: Shell script error 127 is \"Command not found\".\nOne important point of clarification is that the code you have provided is AppleScript, not shell script; though clearly the AppleScript does run a shell command.\nThe best way of troubleshooting is to 'print' out every file path variable as it arises in the script, and see if everything is correct, both in form and in existence.\n", "Q: Night Shift makes display colder before making it warmer I have Night Shift set to enable at a custom time (the automatic \"Sunset to Sunrise\" option enabled too early for my taste). When Night Shift enables, the display dims and gets a lot cooler (bluer) in the space of a few seconds. It then gradually warms up to the correct nighttime temperature.\nThis may help to understand the problem – the dotted line is the path the temperature should take:\n\nIf I disable and re-enable \"Turn On Until Tomorrow\" the displays quickly adjust to the correct warm temperature. I have the temperature slider head set just past the midpoint line on the slider, so the displays are significantly warmer than normal. This makes sense – macOS only adjusts temperature gradually when Night Shift is enabled by the clock.\nIn order to match the temperature of the displays with and without Night Shift enabled, I have to set the slider to ~33%:\n\nBoth of my monitors are colour-calibrated Adobe RGB displays.

The version was 12.3. I've checked night shift (in all modes: laptop/extended display/clamshell) - everything was OK (no blue sudden blue tints on start time of the schedule, everything is smooth).\nThen I updated it to the latest Monterey available 12.6.2 and ... now it has the same issue :)\nSo, it seems that there was a \"security\" patch for all OS from Catalina to Monterey that caused this issue.

I'm having an issue with iCloud for Windows where the numbers of files it is uploading & downloading stays constant, i.e., they don't change for days. I'm wondering if there is a standard way to troubleshoot this issue. For example, is there some logging utility that I can use to see which files it is stuck on, or if there are specific errors that I can address?\n\nI searched this forum and performed a general web search, but I couldn't find a reliable approach. Nor could I find anything on official Apple sites. Restarting the computer doesn't change anything.\nFWIW, here are a few things I have discovered. They might not be relevant, but I found them interesting. Maybe you can tell me if they are related to my issue.\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes when I delete or rename a file in File Explorer, the original comes right back. I can usually delete a file if I try again once or twice. If I performed a rename, I sometimes see the re-named file and the original, as if iCloud restored it.\n\n\n*If I use 7-Zip to compress a file along with the \"Delete files after compression\" option, the deleted file is immediately restored by iCloud Drive.\n\n*\n\n*Deleting files using one the above approaches doesn't seem to affect the core problem, i.e., the number of files shown being uploaded or downloaded doesn't significantly change.\n\n\n\n*If I look at my iCloud Drive folders in File Explorer, I notice that several of the files with the \"Sync Pending\" status are from Apple apps, e.g., Numbers spreadsheets or Garage Band projects.\n\n\n\n*Some folders with \"Sync Pending\" have a twin folder that was not created by me. The name is identical, except it is appended with an underscore (_). The content of these folders are not necessarily identical, though. Some of the files inside are duplicated, but some are unique.\n\nFYI, I'm running Windows 10 Pro (21H2).

I wish to use my external monitor as the primary display. From experience, I know that the monitor works only when the Mac is plugged in to the AC adapter/charger. Is it okay to leave my Macbook plugged in all the time? Will that weaken and degrade the battery faster?\nI used to do something similar with my 2015 Macbook Pro and it was eventually ruined because the battery was swollen. However, I was wondering if there is some new hardware and tech in the newer Macbooks that prevents overcharging in such scenarios.\n\nA: Your battery will not overcharge by leaving it constantly plugged in. This is not new technology - the 2015 MacBook Pro also does not overcharge.\nNo matter how you treat your battery, there's also a risk that the battery will have a defect and get swollen. That is true for all makers of laptops - not just Apple.\nHaving the laptop plugged in and turned on all the time will ever so slightly degrade the battery faster. I personally would not worry about that.\nmacOS Big Sur 10.15.15 and later includes a feature known as \"Optimized Battery Charging\". In this mode, the laptop will attempt to limit the battery at 80% charged when plugged in - in situations where it predicts that you will not need the full charge. This is slightly better for the battery.\n\nA: If you wish to ONLY use the external display then it has to be plugged in. As soon as you close the lid without power connected it will go to sleep.\nIf you use your laptop screen as well as an external screen then you do not have to have the power connected. However, your battery will drain pretty fast with an external screen connected.\n", "Q: How can I update my iMac G4?

If the app is in the background and is later used again, that counts as another session.\n\nSo a user that uses the app 10 times a day for 30 seconds for a total of 5 minutes will have a higher session count than a user that uses the app once a day for 2 hours.\nIn most cases, you will want to have your analytics added to the app in order to more precisely measure user engagement.\n\nA: I have just experienced the same and done some digging into the javascript of the WebStore Connect Site - and it turns out to be - how do I say it... shit.\nIn my case the website has reported flucutating number that went up and down around 10.000 sessions.\nI have managed to do my own queries using the Chrome console (since the webstore access API does not support getting the session count) and managed to get the information of all my beta testers.

Most public wifi doesn't have this problem because more common ports 80, 443, 8080, 8443 were not blocked.\nDisabling the packet filtering (sudo pfctl -d) worked and then I could re-enable it after getting through the captive portal.\nI'm still not sure why 8000 was blocked in the first place.  I saw pass rules for ports 80, 8080, etc., but I didn't see any outbound default rules to block everything not explicitly passed.\nThanks to @jaume for pointing me at pfctl.

Monterey 12.3.1 on a 2020 M1 MBA\nIssue\nI run a streaming client in a Terminal under VS Code.  It's ok if the screens go off through the timer when I step away, but I want WiFi and the computer to continue running.

There used to be a \"Turn computer off after:\" setting (on never would prevent WiFi from shutting off), but it's no longer there.\nIs there a way to allow for the screens (MBA + external monitor) to turn off with the MacOS timer, but otherwise have the MBA continue running (no WiFi interruptions)?\n\nA: Control shift eject (or F12 if your keyboard lacks a media eject key or power button) sleeps the display(s) immediately which turns off the display and backlight.

I've Googled, man'd, searched, etc. in vain.\nI can infer from context more or less what it's doing, but can anyone tell me what officially is this <<EOS ... EOS thing, and/or point me to documentation for it?\nThanks!\n\nA: It is a here document (heredoc), and is built-in to several shells such as bash and zsh.  The text between the delimiting identifiers (EOS in this case) is redirected to the command.\n\nA: (Thanks to @red_menace, @fdo, and @nohillside so far. I've upvoted @red_menace's. It's \"correct\", but I found it difficult to grasp. I didn't really get it, until I read @fdo's link (first comment) as well. So, I feel this needs a more comprehensive answer for anyone else looking...)\nFirst, it has nothing to do with AppleScript.  Instead, in my example in the question:\n\n*\n\n*the osascript part can be \"any program[/commmand] that can read from standard input (cat is by far the most common).\"**\n\n*the -- some AppleScript Code part is any number of lines that you could otherwise type into standard input or feed into the \"program\" from a file, etc.\n\n*In the <<EOS part, The EOS isn't special. It's purely the << that's key. The EOS part can be pretty much any single word (ie. string, no spaces or most special characters, etc.)\n\nThe result: it will perform the command with the encapsulated text as its input.\nIn my example, osascript is simply a shell command that receives AppleScript code as its input and runs that code as if the same code was run in Script Editor, etc.\n**Quoted from @fdo's link.  See that for more details\n", "Q: Bash script or AppleScript to connect & disconnect an Airplay display in Monterey+ In System Preferences > Displays, bottom left corner is \"Add Display\".  I can choose another (Monterey+) Mac, Apple TV, iPad, possibly other things, to effectively become an additional display for my Mac.  It's pretty cool.\nI want to automate connecting and disconnecting to one of those.  Either AppleScript or bash is fine.  I'd really prefer not to use GUI scripting if possible, but if it's the only way I'll take that over no solution.\nAn anyone say definitively if this is possible, and/or how to do it?\nThanks!\n\nA: I don't think a solution purely in bash would be possible, since we are trying to interface with internal macOS application events.  Further, I could not find direct reference to AirPlay, Displays, or Mirroring within the Script Editor.app's Dictionary (open Script Editor.app, File → Open Dictionary...).  But this still leaves the option of GUI scripting via AppleScript, which I will offer below.\nIn macOS 11+, this old example syntax exemplified here won't work because of the UI changes that have been made since macOS 11.  It may be possible to modify it for the new Control Center Menu Bar item, as was done successfully for a checkbox selection type in the second example here, but I haven't been able to adapt it successfully for Screen Mirroring.  Others have also been attempting this.\nIn the meantime, it can still be accomplished with some AppleScript GUI scripting via the System Preferences route, as apposed to going through the system Menu Bar's Control Center:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    quit\nend tell\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    set current pane to pane \"com.apple.preference.displays\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"System Preferences\"\n        repeat until exists window \"Displays\"\n        end repeat\n        tell pop up button 1 of window 1\n            click\n            click menu item \"Apple TV\" of menu 1\n            delay 1\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    quit\nend tell\n\nBe sure to hardcode the name of your device in place of \"Apple TV\".  Further, you could pass an argument to toggle AirPlay mirroring for devices on the fly with a proper Automator Automation, or if you wrap this script into a shell script or a bash alias.\n", "Q: MacOS 12.3.1 Full Disk Access problem We use an MDM solution to manage devices. A .mobileconfig 'profile' grants all the necessary access for Ivanti File Director, that works perfectly fine when the rights were granted on an earlier version of MacOS however when we start the application the first time on 12.3.1 the Full Disk Access request just jumps back and forth. (even if we grant it manually with admin rights)\nWith one word with 12.3.1 something has changed and we're unable to figure it out. Ivanti support ticket is open and we're waiting for their answer however it'd be good to know that we dig in the right direction.\nI'm not sure I can post the .mobileconfig file, since it may contain sensitive information.\nThanks for the suggestions.\n\nA: So Ivanti support came back to us and the solution is surreal. At least for me.\n12.3.1 privacy preference changed.\nSo the solution for us is to give full disk access to terminal, then\ntouch /Users/USERNAME-IN-QUESTION/Library/Safari/CloudTabs.db\nchown USERNAME-IN-QUESTION /Users/USERNAME-IN-QUESTION/Library/Safari/CloudTabs.db\n\nThen, to be safe n secure, take away the full disk access from terminal.\nAfter this, Ivanti File Director starts and runs as expected.\nBeats me what Safari has got to do with all this but it does work.

Let's say I have a \"Work\" profile in iTerm2 and want to set a different HISTFILE for this profile, called .zsh_history_work, so that I don't see my work commands showing up in my regular profiles.\nI know that it's possible for me to switch to the different HISTFILE by writing HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history_work every time I open a new window with the \"Work\" profile. Is there a way to make this automatically happen so that I don't need to run the command all the time?\n\nA: To do this, go to iTerm2 Preferences > Profiles > [Select \"Work\" Profile] > General > Command > Send text at start, and enter the following:\nHISTFILE=~/.zsh_history_work\n\nThis should work as long as you're not using oh-my-zsh. If you are, the HISTFILE is loaded during the .zshrc startup. This will cause commands to be written to the proper \"work\" history file, but read from the regular ~/.zsh_history file. To combat this, we use a different command:\nfc -p ~/.zsh_history_work\n\nThis will allow you to both read and write from the work history file.\nOne more thing: this command will show up every time you open a window or tab with the Work profile. To prevent this from happening, type the following instead:\nfc -p ~/.zsh_history_work && clear\n\nThis will automatically clear the page so that you're left with a blank terminal with your desired history file!\n", "Q: External keyboard function keys suddenly stopped working I use a Logitech K850 Bluetooth keyboard with my MBP on MacOS 12.3.1.

With the advent of Dark Appearance (System Preferences, General) macOS became more pleasant to use on a dark room. Since Dark Appearance turns dark (or darker) many parts which used to be white (or brighter).\nHowever somethings are still not affected by the Light/Dark appearance control, i.e. this website. It is perhaps outside the boundaries of what the OS can do, I actually don't know.\nIs there someway we can tint the white? I would like to do it across all applications.\nIf that's not possible perhaps I should keep using Light Appearance and reduce screen brightens. That would be and unfortunate solution though.\n\nA: Websites need to add Dark Mode support themselves. If the browser tries to just flip colors, the result is often ugly at best or unreadable at worst if images are involved. There's several ways to do that but the bottom line is that it's up to the website.\nThat being said, there are Safari extensions that try to add Dark Mode support to existing web pages.

The past week I upgraded from macOS 11 Big Sur to macOS 12.3 Monterey. My Magic Trackpad 2, which connects via Bluetooth, lags. If I simply move my finger, it takes a short time before the mouse movement starts onscreen. The same for a swipe for Spaces: I'd swipe, and only the second half of the swipe gesture was responded to. If I tap, I have to press, even though Tap to Click is turned on. Some experimentation showed that if I rested my finger on the trackpad for half a second, movement was then immediate, so it seems the trackpad is taking some time to realise my hand is present and then respond.\nI have tried connecting it via USB; restarting my Mac; and ensuring its battery is fully charged. But it's still lagging. How do I solve this?\n\nA: Solution: turn the Magic Trackpad off and on again. It's easy to forget they have a power switch: on the back edge where the power cable plugs in, there is a small sliding switch. I turned it off, waited for ten to fifteen seconds, and turned it on again.\nOnce it reconnected, it now responds quickly as it did when using it with Big Sur.\nNote: There is still sometimes a slight perceptual response delay when I first touch and drag after not having used it for a minute or so. It's much, much smaller than half a second (too small to quantify, maybe fifty milliseconds?) and can mostly be ignored.\nThis Apple Discussion was very helpful, reminding me such a simple solution exists. It also lists other things to try if this solution does not help you. If so, please edit this answer to add in what worked for you!\n\nA: In my case, the problem was actually related to connecting AirPods Pro to the Mac which I also connected Magic Trackpad. It turns out that when I disabled both Mac and iPhone to connect automatically to AirPods the trackpad is no longer lagging.\nOption on Mac can be found in System Preferences > Bluetooth > hit Options under your AirPods and then:\n\n\nA: I just replaced the Duracell batteries with rechargeables, and the trackpad started stuttering every few seconds.

Currently I'm using macOS High Sierra (version 10.13.6) which is the last supported version on my Mac. Is there any way to force the installation of a newer version of macOS, Catalina for example? If the answer is yes, how it can damage my mac?\n\nA: For Catalina, there is dosdude1's macOS Catalina Patcher. While dosdude1's website states compatibility with 2011 iMac models (iMac12,x), the website also states the following.\n\niMac12,x (systems with AMD Radeon HD 5xxx and 6xxx series GPUs will be almost unstable when running Catalina)\n\nAll 2011 iMacs were shipped from Apple with Radeon HD 6750M, 6770M, 6970M or 6750M GPUs. I assume this means the video would need to be upgraded before installing Catalina. While there are websites which claim this is possible, but I do not think this should be attempted by the average Mac user.\n\nFor Big Sur, there is a big-sur-micropatcher. Here the instructions basically say a 2011 iMac would need a GPU upgrade before a Big Sur install would be practical endeavor.\n\nFor Monterey (and Big Sur), there is OpenCore Legacy Patcher. Their website states support for 2011 iMacs (iMac12,x), however the website also recommends upgrading to a Metal GPU.\n\nThe only instance that I have heard of where software can harm hardware on a Mac is when upgrading the firmware. Evidently, the only way to downgrade from a firmware upgrade on many (if not all) Macs is to replace the logic board. So if you encounter any instructions which state non-Apple firmware is to be installed, then I would have cause to worry.\n\nA: There are hacks to force-install newer OS versions onto unsupported Macs.\nSoftware can almost never 'damage' hardware -- not unless you're instructing something mechanical to start/stop over and over, or similar.\nHowever, 'worst case' is unpredictable kernel panics, and slow speeds. Your Mac doesn't support the Metal graphics framework, so graphics acceleration will be disabled, making scrolling and other interactions slow.\n", "Q: How to retrieve conversation entries older than 90 days in Messages.app?

Does anybody have a suggestion?\nWhen trying to open photos app which is connected to mentioned drive I get the -36 error.\nThank you \n\nA: Remember the first rule of troubleshooting, \"isolate and identify.\"\nSo you simplify troubleshooting by ensuring that only the HD is connected to the Mac (other than keyboard/mouse). If it is still disconnecting, then you further isolate the problem by trying a different data cable, and then a different power cable if at all possible.\nIf it is still disconnecting, you further isolate it to a computer issue. Can you plug it into another Mac? Does it still happen?\nIf not, there is an issue with your Mac. If it still happens it is most probably a problem with the drive, or the case that provides the USB and power to the drive inside of it.\nDepending on your comfort level and the status of your drive's warranty you can either take the bare drive out of the case and try it in another case, or return it for warranty replacement.\nIf there is valuable data on the drive, data recovery is sometimes possible, though potentially expensive.

I hear this has changed.\nWhere can I find the Apple authorized repair manuals for DIY repairs?\n\nA: The Apple manuals web site that contains the getting started and existing user manuals also houses the official repair manuals.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en_US/manuals/repair-manual\nYou can search for them all or by keyword (just keep repair manuals singular).\n", "Q: HomePod as a voice-activated dialing device I would like to plant two listening devices (HomePods) in the house for dad, such that he can verbally call mom's iPhone or sister's iPhone.   We are retiring dad's iPhone and the cellular service as he no longer uses it.  Assume dad has lost use of his hands\nGiven the retirement of dad's iPhone, can the HomePod be configured to achieve said objective to verbally connect to mom's or sister's iPhone?  Would this be confined to FaceTime audio?\nCan an iPod or iPad be substituted for an iPhone if using FaceTime Audio in this exercise?\n\nA: The HomePod can make phone calls using an iPhone or iPad to handle the request. This could be FaceTime Audio, if you have no cell plan.\nIt's possible that you would be required to say \"FaceTime Audio\" when prompting it, but you can certainly make a FaceTime Audio call.\nYou cannot make a call without a device on the same Wi-Fi network that handles the call.\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/homepod/use-for-phone-calls-apdeaa15a6c3/homepod\n\nA: I recommend you keep an iPhone or Apple Watch with cellular and cellular service that allows wifi calling.\nEven though Mac and iPad and iPod can call when the iPhone is away from the same network, HomePod needs to connect directly to an iPhone to make cell calls.\nDepending on the hands and arms of your family member a watch may not be suitable, but I have great luck with hey Siri and my Apple Watch with limited touch for some call and messaging function. The benefit here is someone else with an iPhone can now set up an Apple Watch for someone that doesn’t sign in to their own iPhone.\nThe phone with WiFi calling is the most full featured calling solution, hence the recommendation to keep that running. It also ensures your family can place and receive calls from anyone using non-Apple devices such as android smart phones, other cell phones or land lines.\nYou’ll need to enable personal requests and manage the AppleID for either scenario. I prefer FaceTime audio due to the clarity of the calls, so when it works I always use it, but it just doesn’t work enough to recommend it as the only calling option for HomePod.\n", "Q: iPhone keeps connecting and disconnecting from Mac when charging When my I connect my iPhone 7 to my MacBook Air (2015) with the original Apple USB cable it endlessly alternate between connected and disconnected, i.e. charging and not charging. Thus, the iPhone does not charge and even discharge. How to solve this issue?\nNote: cables and connectors are fine. the cable works properly when charging with the power adapter. I also checked with other cables (MFI certified) and on all USB ports of the Mac and the issue is still present.\nAlso, as far as I remember, I had this issue since my first Apple devices (iPod Touch 2G with MacBook Air 2013) and it affected all my iPhones since (3GS, 4S, 7).\nI also want to point out that this issue does not occur each time I plug my iPhone to my Mac but only sometimes and at random moments.\n\nA: This issue is pretty old and was previously discussed on Apple forums (here).

It has a background process called \"SwitchResX Daemon\" which is AppleScriptable.\nAmong other things:\n\n*\n\n*application (class) has one or more display elements\n\n*display (class) has one or more mode elements\n\n*mode (class) has properties like height, width (integers), frequency (real), valid (boolean), etc.\n\nI'm having two related problems:\nProblem 1: whose/where X is in {...}\ntell application \"SwitchResX Daemon\"\n    set theDisplay to the second display\n    \n    set theModes1 to theDisplay's every mode where it is valid and ((its width is 3008) or (its width is 2560)) --> {mode 8 of display 2, mode 12 of display 2} = expected and desired result\n    \n    set theModes2 to theDisplay's every mode where it is valid and (its width is in {3008, 2560}) --> …error: Can’t make {3008, 2560} into type specifier.\n    \nend tell\n\nI use if statements like if width is in {3008,2560} then ... a lot. Can the is in {...} condition not be used in a whose/where clause, or do I just the syntax wrong?\nProblem 2: I have a need to split the filtering in at least one situation.  So...\ntell application \"SwitchResX Daemon\"\n    set theDisplay to the second display\n    \n    set theModesAllValid to theDisplay's every mode where it is valid --> {……, mode 8 of display 2, mode 12 of display 2, ……} = expected and desired result\n    \n    set someModes1 to theModesAllValid's first item where ((its width is 3008) or (its width is 2560)) --> mode 8 of display 2 = expected and desired result\n    set someModes2 to theModesAllValid's first item where (its width is in {3008, 2560}) --> same error as problem 1 above\n    set someModes3 to theModesAllValid's every item where ((its width is 3008) or (its width is 2560)) --> error noted below**\n    set someModes4 to theModesAllValid's every item where (its width is in {3008, 2560}) --> error noted below**\nend tell\n\n-- **error = \"Can’t get {……, mode 8 of display 2 of application \"SwitchResX Daemon\", mode 12 of display 2 of application \"SwitchResX Daemon\", ……} whose width of it = 3008 or width of it = 2560.\"\n\nSo someModes1 (using first item instead of every item) works -- similar to theModes1 in Problem 1 (except item instead of list, as expected).  And someModes2 gives the same error as theModes2 (so, consistent at least).\nBut then I would expect someModes3 and someModes4 to give the same results as Problem 1, but here the every breaks it somehow. Why is that? And even if there's no solution to Problem 1 (meaning someModes4 won't work), is there some way to break the filtering up into two steps for some derivative of someModes3 to work?\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\nA: It's been 15 years since I messed with AppleScript and I don't have SwitchResX, but here are some clues:\n\n*\n\n*\"Can’t make {3008, 2560} into type specifier.\"\n\nset theModes2 to theDisplay's every mode where it is valid and (its width is in {3008, 2560})\n\nAppleScript is weird because you can never quite tell if it is normally expected to work, if it could work if the developers used heroic efforts, or if it's totally impossible. App developers have a decent amount of leeway in how they implement and also half-implement their application dictionaries.\nSo, it's always a bunch of trial-and-error to make an AppleScript work.\nThe is in construct works differently inside a tell. LOL! You expected it would detect the presence of an item in a list, as it does outside a tell.\nInside a tell, I don't think is in usually works the way you expect here. I'm not sure if it could be made to work this way if an app developer put in enough elbow grease. I used to wish it worked that way, as I recall.\nHere's an example of how is in works inside tell:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    get first window where \"Apple\" is in its tabs's title\nend tell\n\n\n\n*Two-part operation\n\nI don't really know what you're trying to do here ultimately, but maybe the previous fragment can give you some clues on how you can achieve it in one or two statements.\nRegardless, this looks like a bug in the app:\nset someModes3 to theModesAllValid's every item where ((its width is 3008) or (its width is 2560))\n\nC.f.:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    tell first window\n        every tab where its title is \"Google\" or its title is \"Apple\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nAnyway, even though every isn't working you can just loop through each condition instead. One big disaster in writing AppleScript is spending any time whatsoever caring about efficiency. You're using AppleScript! Just get it working and move on. :)\nLet me know if I can clarify anything else.\n", "Q: Pressing the \"Opt\" key to show Lauchpad In KDE Plasma I was able to press the Win key and the overview menu has been shown with my apps, favorites, recent, etc.\nI would like a similar behavior for my Mac - just because of the muscle memory.\nSo, I would like to press the Opt key and after the release it would show the Launchpad.\nBut at the same time I still want to retain the ability to use the Opt key in combinations with other keys to trigger shortcuts, etc.\nAny idea how can it be done?\n\nA: There is no system-wide option for this.\nYou can use Karabiner to achieve such behavior.\nTo change the Karabiner configuration open ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json file and add the next content to rules array (separate rules by a comma if you have a couple of them):\n{\n    \"description\": \"Open Launchpad if left Option pressed alone\",\n    \"manipulators\": [\n        {\n            \"from\": {\n                \"key_code\": \"left_option\",\n                \"modifiers\": {\n                    \"optional\": [\n                        \"any\"\n                    ]\n                }\n            },\n            \"to\": [\n                {\n                    \"key_code\": \"left_option\",\n                    \"lazy\": true\n                }\n            ],\n            \"to_if_alone\": [\n                {\n                    \"key_code\": \"launchpad\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"type\": \"basic\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nKarabiner applies config dynamically, so you should be able to use new behavior right after saving the config file.\n", "Q: Change Mac terminal name before the @ In my terminal app, it shows\n\n(base) jeffsungs@Sung-Macbook-Air ~ %\n\non every row.

Way more than it should.\nI started with the usual things, making sure everything was updated, there was no unnecessary software installed, cleaned up caches, temp files and the like. Even starting in Safe Mode did nothing different. It would still panic once or twice a day.\nSo I backed it up, reformatted the SSD and reinstalled macOS fresh. I restored from Time Machine using Migration Assistant and only restored my user folder, no apps.\nAfter running for a week or so I had cut back on the number of panics, I think it was just one that week. Over the next few weeks I slowly installed a few apps, one at a time waiting a few days or so between installations, to see if there was an obvious culprit. Just my needful basics: 1Password, TorGuard VPN, Brave, Firefox, etc. and I stated to get a few panics but the number was way down from before the reinstall.\nAs I use the Mac (general computing, word processing, web browsers, mail.app, VPN now and then) I continue to get the panics but the frequency is reduced, but when I do get a panic it's usually in Safari. So I switch to Brave and while a little better, not substantially so. Trying Firefox it remains about the same.\nI continue to get the occasional (once or maybe twice a week) notification that the computer was restarted because of a problem, when waking the Mac.\nSo the frequency of panics is a little lower than before I did a clean reinstall it is still way more than it should be at 3-5 times a week. Unfortunately the panic log that is sent to Apple means nothing to me and I was wondering if someone conversant in panic logs might have a quick look and see if they see a culprit.

This definitely sounds like a hardware issue.\nYour kernel panics indicates that the kernel itself is experiencing page faults. That is not supposed to happen.\nPage faults in the kernel happen either due to hardware error or kernel bugs. The frequency of panics you have mean that it is not just an Apple kernel software bug - otherwise everyone would have panics all the time. If you had a third party kernel extension installed with bugs - that might explain this. However, you said that you have started over with a fresh macOS installation and still seeing the problem.\nThis is very clear indication of a hardware problem.\nYou could try cleaning your MacBook Pro - making sure there's no build ups of dust. It is a long shot, but it might help the problem.\n", "Q: Air Tag not showing on \"Find My\" on my Mac I just bought an AirTag to be able to track my bike in case it gets stolen. Thing is, I have an iPad Pro, an MacBook Pro, but no iPhone.\nI added the AirTag with my iPad which worked great. The tag is now showing in my \"Find My\" app as supposed to under \"Items\".\nAnyhow, when opening the \"Find My\" app on my MacBook pro, I don't get the AirTag, or any other items in the \"items\" list.\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro is from 2017, it runs Monterey 12.3.1\n\n*iPad Pro is a model \"MLQ62FD/A\" running iOS 15.2.1\n\n*Both devices are logged in with the same AppleID\n\n*Location sharing in the settings is set to \"on\" on both devices\n\n*\"Find My\" is \"on\" on both devices in iCloud settings\n\nSpecifically on my MacBook Pro:\n\n*\n\n*In \"System Preferences\" -> \"Security & Privacy\" -> \"Location Services\", \"Find My\" is enabled\n\n*In \"System Preferences\" -> \"Apple ID\" -> \"iCloud\", \"Find My\" in enabled\n\n\n\nHow do I fix this so that the AirTag is showing up in the Find My app on my MacBook pro?\n\nA: You may need an iOS device to get out of this situation. Here is the playbook:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210973\nIf you get to the bottom of the page, and still can’t make progress,  are note of your macOS and iOS versions and use the contact us link at the booth, of that page to get Apple support to check out your AppleID.\n", "Q: Any problem moving custom domain to iCloud when my Apple ID already uses that custom domain? I have a custom domain example.com I use for email with Google Workspace.\nMy Apple ID is also on that domain.\nI want to move example.com to iCloud+ but have seen mentions this is hard or impossible when the Apple ID that purchased iCloud+ is already on the custom domain. E.g. my Apple ID is user@example.com.\nBefore I start I would like to be sure the migration is likely to succeed.\nHas anyone moved a custom domain to iCloud+ that they were already using as the domain for their Apple ID, successfully? Any pitfalls or tips?\n\nA: I had a Google Workspace mostly for email (formerly GSuite) for myexample.co.uk. I wanted to stop paying for stuff I don't use, and had access to a custom domain using iCloud+.  So in the past week I have moved myexample.co.uk to be my iCloud+ custom domain.\nWorks perfectly in Mac mail.\nDoes not work in Windows 11 mail on my VM, or in Outlook on Mac: the only email address those will work with (with necessary app specific password) is my original iCloud one - which I don't use as I changed my name on divorce and my original iCloud address is my married name.  Also won't work with smtp settings in, say, my router to send notifications.  Can't change my default iCloud address even though I don't use it for anything, and instead use my myexample.co.uk email address as my AppleID etc.\nDoes that add any useful info for you?\n\nA: I was also using a custom domain as my Apple ID and I managed to set it up with iCloud+. Unfortunately, I think I had to make example@icloud.com the default address for Apple ID, removed example@myexame.com from my account and then set it up with iCloud+.\nI might be wrong, but I think this is how I had to got about it last year.\n", "Q: Does Xcode have a graphic editor ALL,\nLooking for a way to create a cursor inside an Xcode.\nGoogle gives nothing in this regards - it just produces a lot of un-useful links, even for SO.\nI'm looking for something like a Resource Editor in MSVC, where you can create a bitmap/menu/cursor, save it and then later use it in your program.\nIf the answer is - Xcode doesn't have a graphic editor - then what can I use to create a cursor {custom} file\nEDIT:\nIgors-MacBook-Air:minimal igorkorot$ ls -la\n/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/HIServices.framework/Versions/A/Resources/cursors/\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x  41 root  wheel  1312 Apr 12  2018 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  42 root  wheel  1344 Jul  4  2018 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 busybutclickable\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 cell\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 closedhand\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 contextualmenu\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 copy\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 countingdownhand\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 countingupandownhand\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 countinguphand\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 cross\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 help\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 ibeamvertical\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 makealias\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 move\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 notallowed\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 openhand\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 pointinghand\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 poof\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizedown\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizeeast\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizeeastwest\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizeleft\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizeleftright\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizenorth\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizenortheast\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizenortheastsouthwest\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizenorthsouth\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizenorthwest\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizenorthwestsoutheast\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizeright\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizesouth\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizesoutheast\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizesouthwest\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizeup\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizeupdown\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 resizewest\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel   160 Apr 12  2018 screenshotselection\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 screenshotwindow\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 zoomin\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   128 Apr 12  2018 zoomout\n\nFirst - I don't see a pdf extension, so how do I know it is in `pdf format?\nSecond - not all of them are here.

A free option could be GIMP.\n\nA: Growly Draw is a free graphics editor - both pixel and shapes. I've used their other apps, which work well.  https://growlybird.com/draw/\n", "Q: How to use `netstat' to show utun (socket) interfaces? I've looked through help using help netstat and can't see a way to just show tun interfaces (or sockets).\nI found one netstat option that isn't listed in the help, netstat -u which only shows \"Active LOCAL (UNIX) domain sockets\".\nI can grep the results of that command for \".sock\" but would like to only one command.\nI am wondering if there are any more \"unlisted\" netstat options for the mac version of netstat.\n\nA: The man-page for netstat lists these options:\nA, a, b, c, d, f, g, I, i, L, l, ll, lll, m, n, p, q, r, R, s, S, v, W, w, x and z.\nThe source code for netstat lists these options:\nA, a, b, c, d, F, f, g, I, i, L, l, ll, lll, m, n, P, p, Q, q, r, R, s, S, t, u, v, W, w, x and z\nSo the unlisted netstat options are: F, P, Q, t and u.\nYou have already discovered u, which means to list only AF_UNIX sockets.\nThe rest have this meaning:\n\n*\n\n*F: Show interface forwarded packets\n\n*P: Show packet priority statistics\n\n*Q: Opportunistic polling stats display\n\n*t: Show interface watchdog timers\n\nThis means that there's no \"secret\" option that will make netstat output what you desire. You can either use a different (probably custom made) tool, or parse its output with tools like grep.\nFor example you could dig information about utun interfaces out of the System Configuration daemon by running a command like this:\necho list \"State:/Network/Interface/utun.*\" | scutil\n\nThe scutil commands also allows you to watch for changes, so that you can run the command in the background and report whenever an interface is created or destroyed.\n", "Q: Is it safe to use `trash-cli` on macOS? Introduction\nThe program nnn has a send-to-trash functionality, and it uses trash-cli. I would like to use nnn and trash-cli on macOS. Reading trash-cli's homepage, I see it uses ~/.local/share/Trash/, while macOS' Trash is ~/.Trash.\nI was thinking, I could create a symlink pointing to macOS' Trash. To test this, here is what I ran:\n% cd ~/.local/share\n% ln -s ~/.Trash Trash\n% ls ~/.Trash\n% touch deleteme\n% mv deleteme Trash\n% ls ~/.Trash\ndeleteme\n\nSo, it seems like this method works.\nTesting trash-cli\nIndeed, when I installed trash-cli, the command works (with the slight drawback of using a different format):\n[nix-shell:/tmp]$ touch deleteme2\n\n[nix-shell:/tmp]$ trash deleteme2\n\n[nix-shell:/tmp]$ tree ~/.Trash/\n/Users/redacted/.Trash/\n├── deleteme\n├── files\n│   └── deleteme2\n└── info\n    └── deleteme2.trashinfo\n\n2 directories, 3 files\n\n[nix-shell:/tmp]$ trash-list\n2022-04-29 15:23:37 /private/tmp/deleteme2\n\nHowever, when I tried running trash-empty, it showed that it would delete other directories:\n[nix-shell:/tmp]$ trash-empty\nWould empty the following trash directories:\n    - /Users/redacted/.local/share/Trash\n    - /.Trash-501\n    - /System/Volumes/VM/.Trash-501\n    - /System/Volumes/Preboot/.Trash-501\n    - /System/Volumes/Update/.Trash-501\n    - /System/Volumes/xarts/.Trash-501\n    - /System/Volumes/iSCPreboot/.Trash-501\n    - /System/Volumes/Hardware/.Trash-501\n    - /System/Volumes/Data/.Trash-501\n    - /nix/.Trash-501\n    - /System/Volumes/Update/mnt1/.Trash-501\nProceed? (y/n) n\n\nI believe these are all user trashes, as my user number is 501. However, it's still a bit worrying.\nMy question\nIs it safe to symlink .Trash and use trash-cli as normal?\nEdit 2022-04-30\nI have clarified the context (nnn) in my introduction.\n\nA: I can't comment on the safety or security of that app except to say that it looks more complicated than others I've seen - and the one I use. There is a thread here on this subject that may prove informative; esp. this answer.\nI posted an answer to a related question with my opinion, and a suggestion that creating an alias to this script was a good solution. I can say that it still works well for me.\nIf you'd like to use trash as I do here's the steps:\n\n*\n\n*Review the code & the comments to determine your comfort level\n\n\n*From your teminal:\n\n*\n\n*open your editor, copy and paste the code into it, save the file as filename trash.\n\n*move the file to /usr/local/bin:\n\nsudo mv trash /usr/local/bin\n\n\n*\n\n*make trash executable:\n\nsudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/trash\n\n\n*\n\n*test its function (this may be easier with an empty trash)\n\ntouch testfile.txt\n# verify testfile.txt exists, and then: \ntrash testfile.txt\n\n\n*\n\n*you may see this:\n\nif so, click OK\n\n\n\n*Your testfile.txt should now be gone from your pwd, and be in the Trash folder now.\n\n\n*If you want to set up an alias, add a line like this to your ~/.zshrc file:\n# you can change 'rmv' to whatever works for you - even `rm`\nalias rmv=/usr/local/bin/trash\n\n\nA: As per the other answer there are ways that are much less complex that trash-cli, that is no need to much around with odd directories, so in your terms it is safer. They also can mark the trashed item so that it can be Put Back in the Finder (that is moved back to where you trashed it from)\nThere is an executable - trash from https://github.com/ali-rantakari/trash\nBy default it does the trashing my moving the file to the macOs location ~/.Trash.\nHowever call with a -F flag and it will use Finder to do the trashing (as in the other answer)\n", "Q: If my MBA has 4 cores, why does About This Mac say it has 2? In About This Mac, it says that my Mac has a dual-core CPU, but Activity Monitor says that I have 4.\n\nI also checked this in Terminal with sysctl -n hw.ncpu but it also gave 4. If I have 4 cores, why does About This Mac say I have a dual-core CPU?\n\nA: It's two cores using Hyper-threading. That's an Intel idea that splits a core into two hypothetical cores, which allows for slightly more efficient multi-threading without any changes at the application-level.\n", "Q: How to change Finder as the default File manager in MacOS? For e.g, when I am uploading an image for a webpage in chrome, and use \"Upload from Computer\", it automatically opens up Finder. I want to use an alternative (say CommanderOne or PathFinder) to be the default for this.\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can’t change the default file manager on macOS. It’s hooked to deeply to the rest of the system.\nThe only way for you to be able to have a different file picking dialog in Chrome is if Google made significant changes to support changing it, which won’t happen.\n", "Q: Safari: adblockers detected on webpages Safari (V13.1.2, High Sierra) often blocks webpages and I do not understand why.

It is really interfering with my ability to effectively navigate other apps that depend on horizontal scroll.\n\nA: Default gesture for Notification Center on Mac is:\n\nswipe left with two fingers from the right edge of the trackpad\n\nIs it possible that you use two fingers while trying to scroll?\nYou can disable this gesture in System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures by unticking Notification Center\n", "Q: Where are User Patches stored for GarageBand? I have created some nice guitar patches (combination of amp, effects, etc.) and I want to save them so I can reuse them in other songs.\nI click the Save button at the bottom of the Sounds pane and the file browser goes to the folder where I saved my last song. I save the patch there but it doesn't show up in GarageBand in the Sounds pane.\nSeems there must be a central location where patches should be saved in order to be available but I'm not finding it. I poked around in ~/Library a bit but did not find the \"User Presets\" folder. Apple says:\n\"Custom patches are saved to a User Patches folder in the Library (created in the Library the first time you save a patch). You can use these patches in any GarageBand project.\"\nbut this does not seem to be my experience. Should I create a User Patches folder somewhere, and if so where?\n\nA: The default location that the patch file browser for audio patches will start in is\n~/Music/Audio Music Apps/Patches/Audio\n\nPatches in this folder show for me in the library under ‘User Patches’.\n", "Q: Are *.mov and *.m4v files from older iPhones today (2022) to be considered legacy? I have made many videos with different generations of iPhones.\nThe vast majority of my videos are in *.mp4. However, I still see older videos in *.mov and *.m4v.\nAre *.mov and *.m4v files considered legacy formats today?\nShould I convert these videos to *.mp4? New iPhones don't seem to produce files in *.mov and *.m4v anymore.\nIt seems *.mp4 is an industry standard across manufacturer boundaries. *.mov and *.m4v is something specific to Apple ecosystem?\n\nA: I would just leave the files as they are. Any modern video player can easily play all of these formats just fine.\nYour hunch is correct though, .mov and .m4v were developed by apple, but today there should be few compatability issues. However, they are certainly not legacy.\n\nA: From Wikipedia:\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization approved the\nQuickTime file format as the basis of the MPEG-4 file format.\nBecause both the QuickTime and MP4 container formats can use the same\nMPEG-4 formats, they are mostly interchangeable in a QuickTime-only\nenvironment.\n\nI visit an online forum, which won't upload .mov files; but if you just rename them .mp4, then it uploads them and displays the video correctly.\nI wouldn't re-encode them using Handbrake until you've determined that they don't work as .mp4.\n", "Q: If I'm using password manager provided by Apple on my iPhone, what would happen if I lose that iPhone? I just realized something, so I'm curious to know the answer. I bought an iPhone and seem to like the password manager that is built into it. I set up all my email passwords (Gmail and all) in it, as well as all my other logins with random passwords generated by that password manager.\nBut then it dawned on me, what would happen if I lose that iPhone?\nPS. I do not have any other Apple devices.\n\nA: Two things\n\n*\n\n*For the finder of the iPhone - they would have a locked phone and could not get any information unless they guessed your PIN. Even better would be for you to log in to the iCloud website from another machine (which could be your PC) and use Find My.. to say the phone is lost and then even the PIN would fail.\n\nIn Settings->Touch ID there is an option to erase your phone after 10 failed attempts at your PIN.\nFind my Phone has to be turned on - it is in Settings->Apple Id\n\n\n*For you - you are no worse off than before you have to remember all your passwords.\n\nI use a third party password manager (in my case 1password but there are others) so I can use the passwords on a PC as well as my iPhone.\n", "Q: Where Does macOS Store Resume Data? Short version is that I am wondering where macOS stores the list of open applications when a user logs out, such that they can be restored when the user logs back in (as part of macOS' Resume feature)?\nFor context, the reason I'm looking for this is that I believe I have an application that's \"stuck\" on this list, as when I turn Resume off the application (along with all others) no longer reopens on login, but when I reenable the feature it starts reopening again and I'd prefer that it didn't.\nMy best guess is that whichever file stores this list is somehow not updating properly (perhaps it isn't writeable for some reason?) but that disabling the feature bypasses it, however when reenabled (as I would like it to be) the problem returns because the application is still in the file somewhere.\n\nA: Application 'resume' data is stored here:\n~/Library/Saved Application State\n\nThe data is stored in folders per each application, rather than a single database of application states.\nI believe, for this instance, the way to resolve the 'stuck' application state would be to delete the application's entry in this location, clearing it's cached state.\n", "Q: Touch ID window for sudo doesn't get focus when opened from iTerm I enabled Touch ID for sudo using pam_tid.so, the problem is whenever I run a sudo command in iTerm, the Touch ID window opens but it is not focused, like this:\n\nand holding my finger on the touch sensor doesn't do anything, I have to first click on it with the mouse (can't even find a way to give it focus with the keyboard) and then it gains focus like this:\n\nand then I can put my finger on the touch sensor to authorize it.\nIt is not the case for Terminal application, the problem only exists in iTerm.\nDoes anyone know how I can make it so it automatically gains focus?\nP.S. It doesn't work regardless of the iTerm window being full screen or not.\n\nA: Wow, I have the same question, and I can not find a best answer in Google. A causal idea I just thought is close the Secure Keyboard Entry where is in iTerm tab, or shortcut option+command+S~\n\n", "Q: Is there a QTranslate for MacOS? I'd like to translate selected text using one keyboard shortcut and see translation in a pop up window, similarly to how QTranslate works on Windows. I tried Mate, but it requires several key shortcuts :)\n\n*\n\n*The core feature of translation of selected text with one shortcut keypress is the goal.\n\n*Having several translation services is good, but not necessary\n\nAny chance someone came across a setup or app that does this well on macOS 12.3 Monterey?\n\nA: Monterey has translation built-in. Just select text, right click and choose \"Translate...\"\n\n\nI can't find a way to assign this a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences, however.\nBut Shortcuts.app has an action to Translate text, so you could create a Shortcuts.app workflow and assign it a keyboard shortcut. (Bit confusing that Shortcuts and shortcuts are two different things.)\nApple's built-in Translate app has, unfortunately, only limited language coverage so far.\nI do have a menulet called \"Translate Tab\", which does provide a Service with a keyboard shortcut, to translate selected text. Though the translations can be a bit dodgy.\n", "Q: Scrolling issue in vim after switch to iterm2 On my MacBook (Monterey 12.3.1), I recently switched from the standard terminal to iterm2.  However, I noticed some strange behavior when using vim in the new terminal.  If I scrolled to the top of the file using the mouse, not only did my cursor remain in its current position but I was able to scroll beyond the beginning of the file into the terminal output.\nWith the standard terminal, the cursor moved with my mouse scroll and it stopped when it reached the beginning of the file.  Is there a way to attain this behavior with iterm2?\n\nA: I had the same problem and what worked for me is changing a setting in iTerm2. Navigate to Settings > Advanced and then change the option Scroll wheel sends arrow keys when in alternate screen mode to Yes.\n", "Q: Can I use a CR2025 battery instead of CR2032 for my AirTag? I started to see that one of my AirTag batteries was getting low so I decided to change it. I already bought some CR2025 batteries already and when trying with one, it seems to work perfectly fine. Apple recommended using CR2032 (which is a bit thicker), but I was wondering if it was safe to use the thinner version.\n\nA: As long as the two battery contacts inside the AirTag still make good contact with the two sides of a CR2025 battery, the only negative effect of using a CR2025 battery would probably be that it would run an AirTag for about 6.7% less time than a CR2032 battery, since the capacity of a typical CR2025 is about 170 mAh (milliamp hours), while the capacity of a typical CR2032 battery is about 200mAh.\n\nA: If the fit is tight, you can use it. The difference, other than a little longevity, Is entirely the thickness.\n", "Q: Toolbox/Podman Alternative for MacOS I primarily develop on Linux and recently bought a Macbook, and am looking to make the development experience familiar to what I am used to. Note that this focuses on work native to the OS, rather than working over SSH which I have no problems with.\nOne way I used to deal with lack of package support on a Linux distro was to use Toolbox with Arch Linux, and keep development packages in a container.\nThis is what I would like to do with macOS as well. I have a podman setup on macOS but the Toolbox tool seems very specific to Linux. Is there a somewhat equivalent tool for mac?\nI don't need desktop integration, and only need CLI packages and libraries. I am also willing to manually write podman-compose files if no such tool exists.\n\nA: It is not entirely clear to me, what your problem with \"package support\" specifically is. Perhaps your needs could be met simply by installing HomeBrew.\nIf that is not the case, you might want to look at Vagrant instead.\n", "Q: Rearrange APFS Volumes inside APFS Container Similarly to this question I'd like to restore factory APFS partition container structure after reinstalling macOS Big Sur from bootable USB flash drive, exactly: make Macintosh HD volume disk1s1 (currently disk1s5) and Macintosh HD -

I can easily block them in Brave, Google Chrome, and Firefox but I was not successful in Safari.\nI have tried 1Blocker and Ghostery both in free version but they were not able to block ads in YouTube. I am unable to use AdGuard due to following issue (AdGuard services were not started correctly). And there is no   https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock that works in Safari.\n\nWarning: It is not possible for extensions like uBlock Origin to work with Safari 13+. See el1t#158.\n\nI was wondering is there any way to block YouTube ads in Safari. YouTube became greedy and they give 30 second ads after each video, which is pretty annoying.\n\nA: I am now using Vinegar.app and it works very well.\nWhat it basically does is that it queries the video as though it was requested onto an iPad with at least 1080p resolution, and probably send a refresh request immediately once the video hyperlink was started to load. (This prevents the playing of video ads on iOS and iPadOS, but was not made available for macOS by YouTube)\nPros\nAdditional advantages other than 0 video ads include that\n\n*\n\n*one no longer has to confirm \"[they are] there\", video playback won’t pause on its own;\n\n*videos won't jump to any random YouTube-choice video;\n\n*the \"replay\" button with same label not only is available after, but throughout playback too;\n\n*there is a working \"loop\" button which keeps the video playing if activated;\n\n*videos can be popped out as a floating window to play outside of Safari altogether;\n\n*video resolution may be preset to \"best [available]\"; and\n\n*left and right arrows to jump 15 seconds never screw up by increasing or decreasing volume (volume is controlled by the up and down arrow if you hover over the volume virtual button).\n\nCons\nThree shortcomings of this solution are that\n\n*\n\n*the next song and previous song buttons in playlists are not available if in use;\n\n*no thumbnail preview of the video when hovering the pointer over the video timeline; and\n\n*the \"best\" resolution option may occasionally fail (exhibited this issue when the resolution was 1st changed).\n\n\nA: You could always subscribe to Youtube Premium. While it does cost money, it only costs around the same as a Netflix subscription. Hosting unlimited videos for people across the world isn't free - the money for the servers Youtube runs can't come out of nowhere.\nThis may not be the answer you're looking for, but it's what I see as the more moral option. You are free to disagree, but please don't downvote just because you don't want to pay money - this is a valid solution.\n", "Q: Removed Google account keeps coming back I'm trying to remove an old Google account from macOS.

Then after a few minutes it comes right back and I get a notification saying a new Google account has been added.\nI'm running Big Sur 11.6.5 and I've already tried rebooting the computer.\n\n\nA: Ensure that ALL your computers and devices (e.g. iPad, iPhone, Apple TV and even Apple Watch) are completely logged out of ALL Google services. Then remove Google from your Internet accounts, shutdown, wait 10 minutes and boot up/check that it's gone.\nFor that matter, you may also want to delete the account from your phone AND your other devices since your phone may check for mail on Google and prevent it from being deleted.\nI don't know whether \"ALT Elliott\" and \"fifteen\" are computers, phones or what, but if any of them are using the Google login, they will cause it to be reinserted.\nAnother thing to try: Change the password on the account, then delete it on all your devices...that way they can't login again.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Adobe Photoshop CS 5.1 not working in Mojave via Parallels I am trying to run Photoshop CS5.1 (from the Adobe CS 5.5 Web Premium suite) in MacOS 10.14 Mojave using Parallels.

Numerous people have reported CS 5.5 mostly working fine on Mojave when installing from scratch, and I have already followed some documented steps to make it work:\n\n*\n\n*Installed legacy Java runtime\n\n*Gone to system security settings and allowed app to control computer and have full disk access\n\nI also noticed that Dreamweaver works to an extent and this is probably due to it not being so reliant on hardware acceleration\nI already contacted Parallels support by email and their suggestion was to increase CPU and RAM allocation, but the VM already has 2 CPU cores and 4GB assigned.\nI could maybe try using an older OS for the VM but I don’t want to risk wasting a load of time without knowing if it will work any better. If anyone has encountered similar problem and found a workaround please let me know\n\nA: Creative Suite 5.5 is 2011 vintage. If you're going to run it in a VM, then I'd suggest something of a similar age, so either Mountain Lion or Mavericks.\nThat will ensure better compatibility, and an OS of that vintage will also use fewer resources than Mojave from 2018.\nOtherwise, you might as well stay on Mojave in the 'real' MBP.\nHowever, I'd really recommend that you just cut your losses and buy Affinity Photo (also Affinity Designer and Publisher if you need Illustrator and InDesign alternatives). \"There comes a point when...\"\n", "Q: Use of 2nd monitor as 2nd screen of iPad when using HDMI out I have an iPad 8 connected to a monitor via the Apple HDMI cable and 3rd party HDMI cable, its working great, but now I’m wondering if it’s possible to use the 2nd monitor not to mirror the display as is currently the case but rather to extend it.\n\nA: Update: Apple has announced support for external monitors on iPads equipped with the M1 chip to be featured in iPadOS 16 in WWDC 2022. Source\nOld answer:\nCurrently it isn't possible to extend an iPad's display. You can mirror it to another screen (via HDMI or AirPlay) but not use an external screen as a separate display. You can only use the iPad as an external display for a Mac.\nThis feature wouldn't make much sense unless it would be required for a keyboard and mouse/trackpad to be connected. In the end an iPad is only a tablet and it would be impossible to control anything on the second monitor without peripherals. Maybe it's still a possibility in the future since Apple likes to advertise the iPad as a notebook replacement but that remains to be seen.\nThis has already been answered in the Apple Community Forum in 2020. However, this hasn't changed since then: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251065889\n", "Q: In Terminal, using the \"touch\" command to mass create consecutive files with leading zero's, with bash, produces different results than zsh In Terminal, I prefer to use bash as my default shell. Issuing the command touch File_{01..10}.txt produces these results:\nFile_1.txt,\nFile_10.txt,\nFile_2.txt,\nFile_3.txt,\nFile_4.txt,\nFile_5.txt,\nFile_6.txt,\nFile_7.txt,\nFile_8.txt,\nFile_9.txt\nAs you can see, there are no leading zeros in the file names.\nHowever, using zsh, the same command touch File_{01..10}.txt produces these results:\nFile_01.txt,\nFile_02.txt,\nFile_03.txt,\nFile_04.txt,\nFile_05.txt,\nFile_06.txt,\nFile_07.txt,\nFile_08.txt,\nFile_09.txt,\nFile_10.txt\nAs you can see, zsh produces the desired results with the leading zeros.\nIs there anyway I can configure bash to produce the same results as zsh for use with the touch command?\n\nA: Without installing a package manager and then a newer version of your shell, you could work with the tools you have.

When integers  are  supplied,  the expression\nexpands to each number between x and y, inclusive.  Supplied integers\nmay be prefixed with 0 to force each term to have the same width.\nWhen either x or y begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all\ngenerated terms to contain the same number of digits, zero-padding\nwhere  necessary.\n\nI'd recommend that you install Homebrew and then Bash (5.1.16 as of this writing), and configure Terminal to use that version instead (correct the path below accordingly):\n\n", "Q: automount is broken after upgrading MacOS Monterey I'm having issues with automount with my NFS shares after upgrading to MacOS Monterey 12.3.1.\n/etc/auto_master:\n#\n# Automounter master map\n#\n/System/Volumes/Data/mnt auto_mounts\n+auto_master            # Use directory service\n#/net                   -hosts          -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid\n/home                   auto_home       -nobrowse,hidefromfinder\n/Network/Servers        -fstab\n/-                      -static\n\n/etc/auto_mounts\nnas         10.17.24.105:/homes/mynas\n\n$ sudo automount -vc\nautomount: /System/Volumes/Data/mnt mounted\nautomount: /System/Volumes/Data/home updated (/home -> /System/Volumes/Data/home)\nautomount: no unmounts\n$ ls -l /System/Volumes/Data/mnt/\ntotal 0\nls: fts_read: Input/output error\n\nAny ideas?

Moreover, some readers or editors can recognise it as a JPEG even without a correct extension.\nHow did you get these files? The image extension could be a result of stripping .jpeg down to 3 letters by some legacy image editing tool which assumes all extensions should contain 3 characters, but these are pretty rare nowadays.\n\nA: According to Wikipedia all of these extensions\n.jpg, .jpeg, .jpe\n.jif, .jfif, .jfi\n\nare a valid JPEG file extension.\n\nThe most common filename extensions for files employing JPEG compression are .jpg and .jpeg, though .jpe, .jfif and .jif are also used.\n\nSo:\n\n*\n\n*You can rename them to *.jpg\n\n*There is no difference to *.jpg\n\n*File extension *.jpe may be a preferred extension for JPEG files of the source of the images\n\n\nA: The one problem I can think of is if these files are used by some software, and called upon explicitly by name. If so, then renaming the extension may cause a 'file not found' error.\n\nA: Just rename the picture that has *.jpe into a jpeg. You can do it by clicking the left side of your mouse and choosing rename or long-press the picture and find the option rename.\n", "Q: MacBook Air M1 and weird text rendering on Samsung S49A950U ultrawide I'm running Samsung S49A950U from my M1 Air at the native resolution via USB-C cable. No issues with the resolution itself (5120x1440) or the frequency (60Hz). Using USB-C to DisplayPort gives me 120Hz. So far so good.\nThe only thing is text clarity. I can only get crisp, sharp, well defined text in HDR modes. Switch the HDR off and the text is jagged and rough.\nAnd it's not because of M1, or because of my M1 (I tested that with an identical but brand new machine). It's the same thing with an Intel-based MacBook Pro. Also, I did not experience such behavior on Samsung G9 or a Philips ultrawide.\nFor example, two identical characters are rendered differently in a single word. In 'off' first f is rendered as f, the second as f. The middle line in E is jagged, lowercase l might have the 'italics' quality to it.\nTurn HDR back on, and the text looks just fine.\nAny ideas why that might be happening?\nThanks\nUPDATE: Well, I returned the monitor within the 14-day grace period.\nJust didn't have the stamina to fight it every day and getting my eyes burned by HDR.\n\nA: This is old but you have to adjust it in both macOS and in the monitor's menu together or you're going to get either greyed-out colors or what you're experiencing. If you only do one or the other, you're going to get a bad experience due to the mismatch. This isn't clear with new HDR functionality that you need to do this so this is just bad design for an end-user to understand what's going on and in this case, caused a return of a completely functional monitor.\n", "Q: eMac with no OS I have an eMac with no OS and I have no install disk.

Since this prevents duplicated filenames from being selected for compression, the cannot repeat names in zip file' error doesn't occur.\nNote that if you use the -x option when running zip in Terminal, you only need one backslash:\nzip -jr file.zip files -x \\*.DS_Store\n\n", "Q: Why Apple OS, Software and so many things are highly stable and smooth? Even when using Windows on high end computers it lacks is stability when using many programs. I want to know how apple manage to provide such grate experience to users, even not running apple macos (mojave/Big sur) on apple hardware. I have tested macos on another hardware as it grate and nearly same in performance and stability running on SSD, Nvidia 710, 16GB RAM.\n\nA: I'd question your premise that Windows is inherently unstable: it is used in all sorts of business and industry environments where stability is critical.\nAnd indeed, there are those who would question whether Apple's software is all it should be right now.\nHowever, the usual answer to this sort of question is that Apple makes both the hardware and the software, so that the two are designed for each other. Also, there is a much smaller range of hardware devices that need to be supported.\nWindows is built to run on a much larger range of hardware, often relying on third-party drivers to bridge any gaps between the OS and the hardware.\n", "Q: What is the process to replace a hard drive in a Mac Mini?

Can I do the copy with Disk Utility?\n\nA: This iFixit page has a wealth of information about how to work on the 2011 Mini's hardware.\nThese instructional pages on replacing the Hard Drive and the Hard Drive cable are exactly what you are looking for.\nI know that mere links to information is frowned upon on StackExchange, but a wholesale copy/paste task of all the information contained on this site is a very large burden. iFixit has been around for some time, and IMHO, not about to disappear any time soon.\n\nA: You'll need to buy a USB to SATA cable or USB drive 'enclosure', so you can connect the new drive to the Mac while the old one is also still connected (and booted).\nThen I would recommend using either SuperDuper! or CarbonCopyCloner to clone the whole source disk to the destination disk.\nThen physically switch the drives. You could switch the drives first, and boot from the old drive as an external before cloning, of course.\n", "Q: How to export Time Machine exclusions or list them in Terminal I have a Mac running Time Machine and it has dozens of exclusions that were added through the Time Machine UI.\nHow can I export this list?\nUsing tmutil in Terminal, I am able to access Time Machine backups and configuration.\nThe tool has the following commands related to exclusions:\ntmutil addexclusion [-p|-v] item ...\ntmutil removeexclusion [-p|-v] item ...\ntmutil isexcluded item ...\n\nIs there any way to list the existing exclusions without using isexcluded on specific files and folders?\n\nA: Here are 3 ways of getting Time Machines exclusions:\nFirstly, every backup includes its own exclusion list. At the top level of each backup there is a hidden file called .exclusions.plist, for example /Volumes/<TM volume name>/2022-05-03-124500/.exclusions.plist. You can see this in Finder so long as you are showing hidden files by pressing Shift and Command and then the dot (or >) key.\nThe file has exclusions of 4 types:\n\n*\n\n*Standard exclusion paths,\n\n*Sticky exclusion paths set on particular files (lots of these),\n\n*System files excluded - there are none (I suspect it is a relic from older versions of TM), and\n\n*User exclusion paths - those set in Time Machine's System Preferences.\n\nSo the list you want is at the end of the file.\nHoward Oakley's blog has the best reference for the above What doesn't Time Machine back up?\nSecondly, Time Machines preference file contains the list of locations added in Time Machine's System Preferences.  This is /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist.\nThis preference file does not include individual files with exclusion set or the standard exclusions.\nThirdly, and thanks to @Gordon Davisson, here is a simple one-liner for the exclusions added in the GUI:\ndefaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine SkipPaths\n\n", "Q: Cannot merge two partition together after dividing partition for installing Linux I tried to install Linux after dividing partition.

Being on a slow cellular link, he had to decline until he can get to a wifi hotspot.\nBefore he runs into more showstoppers, I need a clear answer to this:\n\n*\n\n*Is there a command to perform this CLT installation?\n\n*Is Xcode required?\n\n*Does he need to be registered as an Apple Developer?\n\n*Are there any other prerequisites for installing Perlbrew that I haven't thought of?\n\nThe first thing I do after installing MacOS is to install Xcode, so I don't have a system like his to experiment on.\n\nA: Apple's Xcode is not required to obtain the requisite components for perlbrew.\nThere is no need to be a registered Apple Developer to install the Command Line Tools (CLI) required for perlbrew. Simply do:\nxcode-select --install\n\nTo install Perl, follow here and do:\ncurl -L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash\nperlbrew install-cpanm\nperlbrew install perl-5.34.1\n\n", "Q: My username for remote ftp access is different from my macos username and Finder will not let me edit the files I can connect to a remote ftp server in Finder using the syntax ftp://username@host/path and then supplying the password.

Finder also does not display permissions for them except rather confusingly via Get Info:\n\nThe username used for the remote server is not the same as my username on the Mac. Could this be the problem?\nI normally access the ftp server from a Linux machine without these difficulties.\n\nA: The usernames were not the problem.

(ethernet needs to have IPv6 on link local or it will not work anyway)\nI'm running macOS 12.3.1 and I'm using Apple USB-Ethernet-Adapter (worked on my old Mac like a charm) WiFi settings are also the same as before.\nNetwork environment is a company.\nHas anybody an idea what's wrong here?\n\nA: Ok, just got a response from our IT. It is a Palo Alto Firewall problem which is also installed on my MacBook.\n", "Q: Can I uniquely identify an *installation* without violating Apple ToS? If Apple discourages uniquely identifying an iOS device I would wonder how would push notifications work?  Won't you need that ID to uniquely send to the device?\nThough I am not really after uniquely identifying the device, more that I can use something that's specific on the device or installation (like the push token) to identify the running application for\n\n*\n\n*diagnostics\n\n*request integrity (ensuring that the request came from the device and not somewhere else, though I know that can easily be spoofed if you get rid of the device as the attack source)\n\n\nA: The way push notifications work is that the app requests permission from the user for notifications, when granted, it requests a device token. The device token is sent to and stored on the server(s) backing the app. Whenever the servers needs to send a push notification to that particular app, they give the device token to Apple's push notification service in order to identify that particular app on that particular device.\nSimilarly you app or backend server can generate an identifier that is stored on the phone to identify that particular app installation on that particular device.\nNote of this violates any Apple \"ToS\".\n", "Q: What is going on with WindowServer? I know WindowServer manages all the windows on my system. I know that's going to scale with multiple monitors, etc.\nAt times though... it seems it's working a lot harder than it should if it's just watching all the tabs that I have open in chrome.\nIn any given top -o cpu command it's almost always the MVP.\nSo what is it doing? I assume window management is fairly event driven, and static windows should not be an issue. So can someone help demystify this hard working program, and help give it credit for it's work?

So, I thought it might not be that bad with M1 Pro (10 core version), but then the old concern kicked in - Its different architecture, how will it work?\nFrom the early days of M1, I remember there were a lot of problems with compatibility - apps were crashing, docker was not supported and a ton of other things.\nDo you know, how it is now working? How hard it is to use M1 chipset in a team with mixed workstations (x86, linux, intel MacBooks), especially with following tools being used:\n\n*\n\n*Idea IntelliJ\n\n*various java JDKs\n\n*docker\n\nMy special concern is about docker - e.g. using testcontainers, where the image name is hardcoded in the source code of developed app. What will happen, if there is e.g. apache kafka hosted on docker (kafka does not have official arm image). Will it be emulated, or I will have to make some changes?\n\nA: In generel, there's no problems in using an Apple M1-based computer for software development.\nAs always, you should ensure that the specific software you're using is compatible with the new computer. In general almost all software is compatible.\nIn particular there's no problem running IntelliJ and Java projects as you mention here. IntelliJ has been out in a M1 native version for almost half a year, so there's no emulation taking away performance there. Docker Desktop is also available for the M1 natively.\nFor Kafka, you can use the docker image here, which has native M1 support:\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/wurstmeister/kafka\nIf the specific containers you want to use are only available for the Intel architecture, they will ofcourse have to be emulated. However, most open source software and their containers are available for ARM as well.\n", "Q: How can I execute a function defined in bash profile, from a launchD plist file?

When I'm listening to music on my iOS device and open certain apps like games, the music stops. How do I prevent that from happening?\n\nA: Music should keep playing when switching apps, unless the app you've switched to tries to take custody of media playback itself.\niOS gives priority to the foreground app for media playback, so other playback stops.\nIt's up to the app developer of the app you're switching to when playback stops to not code their app to stop background playback of other apps.\n", "Q: Acrobat Pro 2020 fails to install on an m1 MacBook While running the .pkg file to install Acrobat, a generic prompt is raised after I enter the serial# indicating that installation has failed. When I run Acrobat, it prompts me to enter the serial again, and that immediately raises the following dialog:\n\nI don't have reason to think that the installer is damaged. The package file has been used successfully through Munki (on earlier MacOS versions) for a long time and I've tried copying it and running it manually with the same result.\nI googled the error but the most common solution from Adobe is to change the permissions on Library/Application Support/Adobe/SLStore, but it doesn't exist.

Any reason you're not using Acrobat 2022?\n\nA: It is likely that @benwiggy's suggestion about Python 2.7 being removed from Monterey caused the problem.

It was a huge database, listing many different applications, and very helpful. On it, many users reported using software that Apple or the software manufacturers claimed were not compatible. Unfortunately I cannot find the site again. If it is still online, does anyone know the URL to this site?\n\nA: Here is one such site - the quality of the records here, I'm not sure:\nhttps://roaringapps.com\n", "Q: Interpreting AppleSmartBattery manufacturing date from ioreg in macOS Big Sur and later I am trying to make sense of the age of the battery (by calculating it from its manufacturing date). I need the information for something I am working on and need to know how to access it programmatically.\nNormally, it was easy to do this as described here. But since Big Sur, this five-digit integer has changed to something totally unrecognizable. I found this single link detailing it, and that person had issues explaining what it actually meant and how to extract the manufacturing date from it.\nI was not able to find the spec sheet to figure out what Apple means with this number too, so if anyone has any information, it would be uber useful. Thank you. :)\nIf it matters, I am currently extracting this information using\nioreg -l -n AppleSmartBattery -r | grep -e \\\"ManufactureDate\\\" \\\n    | awk -F',' '{printf (\"%s\", $56)}' | awk -F'=' '{printf (\"%i\", $2)}'\n\n\nA: Instead of looking at the ManufactureDate, you should instead look at the battery serial number. It can be retrieved with the same command:\nioreg -l -n AppleSmartBattery -r\n\nIn the output you'll find something similar to this:\n\"BatterySerialNumber\" = \"12345678901234567\"\n\nYou need to look at only the characters at index 4-7 in the serial number according to this template:\n\"BatterySerialNumber\" = \"---YWWD----------\"\n\nThe meaning here is Y=Year, W=Week, D=Day.\nFor example, your serial number contains \"9214\" this means that your battery was manufactured in 2019, week 21, day 4 of the week - that is the 24th of May 2019.\n", "Q: Running the same commands on multiple remote hosts I have the need to run some simple commands on multiple remote hosts, then view the output side by side. For example I might want to run:\ncd /var/log/server\ngrep 'UUID: 12345-12345-12345' *.log\n\nThen check that there are 15 lines returned and they all look the same, across a dozen remote hosts.\nWhat tools are available to help me do this without having to switch between multiple tabs and type or copy/paste a bunch of commands?\n\nA: Using Alfred Clipboard History\nThis is a slight enhancement of the copy-paste option that relies on the Alfred app — Alfred is a launcher, providing a faster way to launch applications or perform certain tasks by typing instead of navigating the GUI. In this case we're using one feature of Alfred which is Clipboard History. Alfred will remember the last day's worth of Clipboard activity.\n\n*\n\n*Create a text file containing the commands you want to use\n\n\n*Select each command and copy it to the clipboard (Command+C)\n\n\n*For each terminal window or tab:\n\n*\n\n*Open Alfred Clipboard History (default is Command+Option+C)\n\n*Select the command to paste\n\n*(repeat those two steps for each command)\n\n\n\nFor me, writing the commands down ahead of time is part of planning what I'm going to do, and also documenting what I've done so my colleagues can pick up any routine task and hit the ground running.\nHow does this help?\nUsing Alfred Clipboard History in this way saves the back-and-forth between the text file and the terminals, reducing the risk of accidentally selecting a sequence of characters instead of the whole command, or accidentally deleting commands with Command-X instead of copying with Command-C, or moving blocks of text around as editors such as BBEdit allow you to do by simply dragging a selected block of text.\nThis option doesn't require advanced knowledge of tools like Ansible.\nProblems with this option\nThis option can lead to confusion because Alfred's Clipboard History simply lists the clipboard history and you need to remember the order to invoke the commands in. For one or two commands, it's pretty safe. Once you have five commands you might end up invoking them out of order. In some cases you can copy blocks of commands or use ';' to separate commands on one line.\n\nA: If you have ssh access to all remote systems, you can run\nfor h in user@server1 user@server2 user@server3; do\n    echo \"===== $h =====\"\n    ssh \"$h\" sh -c 'cd /var/log/server; grep \"UUID: 12345-12345-12345\" *.log'\ndone\n\nto display the data in Terminal.\nTo automatically do the checking, you can redirect the output from each server to its own file and then use diff to check whether they are equal.\n", "Q: Force Preview to Live Text a PDF? I have scanned a document and turned it into a PDF. When I open that PDF in Preview, I would have expected all of the text in the doc to be selectable via Live Text, but it's not.\nHowever, if I take a screenshot of the text displayed in the doc that's open in Preview, and open the screenshot in Preview, all of the text is instantly selectable.\nHow can I force Preview to Live Text my scanned PDF?\n\n\nA: It does seem as though Live Text does not work for PDFs in Preview, but only for image formats, e.g. TIFF, JPEG, PNG.\nApple's support pages say \"open an image or photo\".\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/preview/prvw625a5b2c/mac\nThere are apps that perform OCR on PDFs, storing the text in an invisible layer, where it can be selected, copied or otherwise used. PDFPen is one of the best.\nOtherwise, there isn't really an option for a multi-page document. You can Live Text the scan of each page as an image file, though.\n\nA: Scanning in the iOS Notes app provides OCR / LiveText when the scanned document is opened from within Notes (It seems like scanning with the iOS Files app doesn't). Also, scanning with Notes and then dragging the scanned file out as a PDF (on Mac) and opening with Preview breaks the OCR / LiveText.\nLiveText is such a great feature, but the implementation seems frustrating incomplete regarding PDFs and Preview.\n", "Q: how do i delete apps from the Launcher on Mac Monterey? Clicking on the icon until it wiggles does not allow me to drag it to the Trash.\n\nA: \n\n\n*Press and hold the Option (⌥) key, or click and hold any app until the apps start jiggling.\n\n*Click the Delete button next to the app you want to remove, then click Delete to confirm. The app will be deleted immediately. Apps that don't have a Delete button either didn't come from the App Store or are required by your Mac.

I am using MacOS BigSur / Photos 6.0\nI have photos in the Album that I want to delete completely from everywhere.\nIf I delete it found in the Album, it still keeps the photo in the Library, so in order to delete it completely - I have to search for it in the Library and delete it from there - it is very inconvenient.\nHow to delete it from Album and Library at the same time?\nWhey I use : Cmd + Delete,\nOption + Cmd + Delete on the photo in the Album\nit does not remove photo from Library.\n\nA: Deleting photos from an album only deletes them from that album, not from the library or from any other albums they are in (A photo can belong to more than one album). Deleting photos from the library removes them completely from the library as well as all the albums they are in.\nTo completely delete photos that are in the Album from the library as well as albums they're in, open the album. Click Edit > Select All (or the unwanted photos) > \"i\" (Info) icon.\n\nIn the Keywords field, add a keyword that you haven't used previously. This will add it to all the selected photos.\nIn the sidebar, click the Library tab > in Search, type the keyword you added. The unwanted photos' thumbnails will be displayed. Select all, and delete.\n\nA: You have to delete it from the library to delete the photo.\nTo speed this up, use the Keyword Manager to make a keyword for deletion and assign a keyboard shortcut. Tag the photos and then move on or delete from the album.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/photos/find-photos-by-keyword-pht8d0ad5198/mac\nLater you can make a smart search or just ad-hoc search in the full library and bulk delete.

Also, if you select one or more photos and click on the Image menu, then hit command while that menu is visible, you will see the \"remove photo from album\" menu item change to \"delete photo\" and the associated keyboard shortcut icons change from delete to command-delete.\nI just discovered this by accident as I'm used to hitting command-delete in Finder to remove files and was shocked to notice the photos I was removing from albums were also being deleted from the library.

Today I updated the chrome app on my Mac but when I checked in the application section of Finder I see the modified date as 30th April? Why is that?

I am using IMac and device is purchased from apple.com. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: What you are seeing is the date that the app was created or modified - by the developer!\nThe exact behaviour will vary depending on how the app was downloaded and installed, but this is the correct behaviour.\nTo explore it a bit:\n\n*\n\n*Open the Applications folder in Finder;\n\n*Change the View to List;\n\n*Right click (or Control-Click) on the heading row (e.g. where it says\nName) and add additional columns - in this case Date Added, Created\nand Modified;\n\n*Sort by Date Added (if you wish).\n\nNow you will see that the Date Added really is the date and time you installed the app.\nDate Created is usually earlier than Date Added - exceptions include applications that are part of macOS (e.g. Calendar) where all three dates are the same.\nSomething that confuses people is that Date Added is a property of the folder, whilst Date Created and Date Modified are properties of the file (or app). Hence: 1) Date Added does not appear in the Get Info window, and 2) when you move or copy a file to a new folder, the Date Added changes in the new folder, but not the Dates Created or Modified.\n", "Q: Open new application window via commandline Background\nIf you need a new window of an app you can right-click the app in the dock and click New Window. This is very tedious and takes away precious time. I'd like to have a shortcut for that.\nCurrently I'm using iCanHazShortcut, which an run terminal commands from shortcuts. I currently use open /Applications/Firefox.app --new (Example). This opens a new instance of an application. I would generally have no problem with that if it wouldn't cripple the dock and the whole window manager over time.

If the file does not exist, then create the file.\nopenwin() { osascript -e \"tell application \\\"$1\\\" to activate\" -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"n\" using command down'; }\n\nThe next time you open a Terminal window, you will be able to use the above function to send the key combination ⌘+N to the application specified. For example, to open a new window in Firefox, enter the following.\nopenwin firefox\n\nFor Microsoft Edge, enter either of the following.\nopenwin \"microsoft edge\"\nopenwin microsoft\\ edge\n\nThe key combination ⌘+N is the default in most applications to open a new window.\nWhen the above function is first used, you may need to do the following.\n\n*\n\n*Authorize the Terminal application to send Apple events to System Events. This can be found under Automation on the Privacy tab of the Security & Privacy pane of the System Preferences application.\n\n*Allow osascript to send keystrokes.

Changing app icons in macOS keeps getting harder, especially since Big Sur where a lot of the best icon management apps no longer work, and the newer apps all seem a bit flakey and unreliable. Other methods I've tried, such as finding and replacing .icns files inside an app, also cause issues.\nI know you can no longer change system app icons easily, but changing App Store and other third party app icons can still be achieved most reliably and consistently with the good old fashioned process of doing \"get info\" on an app and dragging a .icns file onto the existing icon in that window.\nThere must be a way of doing this same thing from the terminal? Is anyone able to suggest a way of achieving this? It's a pain keeping custom icons every time apps update themselves. Thanks\n\nA: The biggest trick that I don't have an answer for is how to identify the current file used by an app. Right now I have a list and it runs through that...\ne.g. MS Word uses MSWD.icns, Rider uses rider.icns, Outlook uses Outlook.icns, Slack uses electron.icns, etc.\nThe following snippet can be used to update the icon for a given app:\n# $ICON_PATH = /full/path/to/current/icon.icns\n# $NEW_ICON_FILE = /full/path/to/new/icon.icns\n# $APP_PATH = /full/path/to/App.app\n\nsudo cp \"${ICON_PATH}\" \"${ICON_PATH}.bak\"\nsudo cp \"${NEW_ICON_FILE}\" \"${ICON_PATH}\"\nsudo touch \"${APP_PATH}\"\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store\nsudo killall Dock\n\nWrap it in a function & then you can script:\nset-app-icon \"/full/path/to/App.app\" \"/full/path/to/current/icon.icns\" \"/full/path/to/new/icon.icns\"\nThere are a few apps I've come across that require a quit + restart (killing Dock doesn't do it. This seems to be the JetBrains apps that are currently running), but after quitting + opening, new icons are reflected.\n========\nAs said at the beginning, I'm looking for a way to cut out the need to find /full/path/to/current/icon.icns manually, so you just pass in the .app & new icon file. Will come back to update this if I find anything (current thread is looking for CFBundleIconFile, but it doesn't look like all apps have this...)\n========\nYou can get the current icon file with the following command: defaults read /path/to/App.app/Contents/Info CFBundleIconFile. You can also use /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy, but I'm not sure the differences between these approaches.\n", "Q: How to fix unresponsive filesystem without rebooting? I tried to mount an external storage device in MacOS 12.3.1 using sshfs, but I had to stop this process in the middle of whatever it is doing.\nNow, when I do a ls -l in the file system it hangs for minutes. There is no output in a terminal using ls -l.\nI could fix that rebooting the device - but is there ANY possibility to fix this issue without rebooting the device (MAcBook Air) all the time?\nI still can do ls in other folders.\n\nA: Your best bet is to stop navigating in that folder path and try to umount it. Even a df may put you in timeout mode.\nIf you think your ssh connection is stale, you could look at ServerAliveInterval (check your FAQ for your version of sshfs you chose for syntax)\nThe delays baked into sshfs to make it handle long network delays is the ultimate root cause here if ssh stays connected.

Time Machine sort of sees it (by Option-clicking it), but most of the time, does not allow to browse it. When it does, it is super slow and eventually auto eject itself.\nI also managed to briefly see it in Finder and manually browse the back-ups, but again, it hanged and eventually ejected.\nNow I can not seem to be able to browse it anymore, it just shows in Disk Utility as pictured.\nWhat I would like to achieve:\n\n*\n\n*See if I can browse it to recover some files, via Time Machine or Finder\n\nAdditional info: Time Machine restoring was attempted after High Sierra was patched to the latest version, to match the back-up version, via Migration Assistant. I tried all the 4 different USB iMac ports. The drive is a portable Toshiba 1 TB USB 3.0 which served all its life as a Time Machine back-up and was never really needed. Well, until now.\nI suspect restoring was broken since I switched to APFS for the new SSD while the back-up was in macOS Extended (Journaled)?\nUPDATE 1\nLast night, by randomly running First Aid on it, it started to show on the desktop. I then proceeded in moving some files but behaviour and speed were inconsistent: sometimes files would just transfer quickly and fine, other time slowly and ended in an error.\nNow the disk is not mounting again, shows another name in Disk Utility and does not First Aid. Any suggestion is appreciated.\n\n\nUPDATE 2\nI have noticed that when copy is interrupted, I get error code - 36. I researched it and tried to dot_clean via terminal but no luck, error came up again on the same files. Size seems unimportant, it came up with an image file of a couple MBs and with a video file of 3+ GBs.\nNevermind the inconsistent mounting of the hard disk, by insisting/sheer luck it eventually shows in Finder. Now my objectives are:\n\n*\n\n*Be sure that the actual copy ends with no error -36, no matter if it going to take several hours\n\n\n*Do not have the hard disk ejected, even if I must say it always happens after error -36 so they must be tied\n\nA: Well, I have no idea why but by just insisting and transferring files via Finder (not the Time Machine interface), I eventually made it.\nI just lost 1 series, 1 movie and a folder with 32 screenshots, no matter what they where always bring up error -36. Not too bad for over 500 GB of data.\nMy advice is, if you are in a similar situation, try to run First Aid on it, use Finder, just have the patience to transfer one file at a time to identify files that will be throwing the error and drop them, they will never copy correctly.\nI will then erase this disk and set it up as a new Time Machine.\n", "Q: How do I install Torify on an M1 Mac?

I don't really like the trackpad and keyboard of the Chromebook so I wish to use my MacBook just for the display, keyboard, and trackpad (just like external display/accessories). Is it possible to achieve that?\n\nA: Since a lot of software isn't compatible with Chrome OS I had to search around a bit. However, I found Google Chrome Remote Desktop which apparently is a native remote desktop solution for practically any device which has Chrome installed.\nThis would mean that you can essentially use your MacBook (including its display, keyboard and trackpad) while being remotely connected to the Chromebook. I can't test this solution right now but it seems to have worked for other people who had a similar problem.\nUsing this solution it won't be possible to use the MacBook as a second display (as stated in your title), just to mirror the display.

A phone sitting on a car seat will connect better than one that's in the car's trunk. A closed trunk will interfere with radio wave signals too, how much will depend on the type of material (steel? aluminum? fiberglass?) used in the trunk lid. This will apply to all involved phones, and those phones' circumstances are unknown.\nI assume there are a lot of parking spaces in the garage. Do you plan to stake out each occupied space and confront every driver, or follow every car that leaves the lot? With no more specific information, even an interested police department would have little to go on. Confronting the driver or following the car will expose you to personal risk.\nWith no disrespect, I would gently suggest that your hopes for recovery are misplaced.\n", "Q: \"Import\" from shared album converts HEIC to smaller JPG Well it turns out I am an idiot and the premise of my question was incorrect.

The versions in the shared albums and the versions after using \"Import\" are virtually identical (although weirdly they lose one pixel of height).\nHere's the info pane for an image in the shared album. The \".HEIC\" title confused me, but I see now that it's a JPEG.\n\nHere's the version that was imported. The title has changed to \".JPEG\" and it has mysteriously lost a single pixel of height, but otherwise it appears exactly the same.\n\n\nOriginal question with incorrect premise below:\nWhen someone shares a photo that I want to keep using the Shared Album feature of Photos, my workflow has been to open the shared album in the desktop Photos app, right-click the photo, and choose \"Import\" from the contextual menu.\nOnly today I noticed that instead of importing the photo in its original size and format, it converts it from HEIC to JPG at a smaller size.\nI know that there are less convenient ways to get the original (for example \"Export Unmodified Original\" and then re-import) but I wonder: Is there any way to direct the \"Import\" command to just import the photo without changing it?\nThis is in the current version of MacOS Monterey 12.3.1.\n\nA: By size, are you referring to the file size or pixel size?\nConverting HEIC to JPG at the same resolution (pixel size) would actually increase the file size, because HEIC files much more compact.\nThe photos you are importing are smaller because Apple limits the resolution of photos in Shared Albums - to 2048 pixels on the long edge for regular photos and 5400 pixels for panoramic photos.

I copy pasted the Rouble sign from this page as my replacement. The only downside of this method is to generate the character you need to type a Space or punctuation afterwards, to make it actuate the replacement.\nAlso note that some non-Apple apps, like MS Office, have their own replacement systems which you have to set up separately.\n\nAlternatively, use Ukelele (freeware) which allows you to design entire custom keyboard layouts. For a simple swap like this, maybe just pick another Opt/character to sacrifice to your replacement. I'd consider sacrificing ® from Opt/r to keep it memorable.\n", "Q: Others can't edit a file after creating a file and copying it to Mac Server 5.7.1 Monterey Mac Server 5.7.1, client is on macOS 12.3.1 Monterey, has been given staff read/write access by the server.

I open a PNG with Preview, then drag another one into the sidebar, and then choose Export to PDF. The resulting PDF has only one page.\nI tried again, after selecting all pages -- same result.\nHow do I export a multipage PDF?\n\n\nA: It saves one file to PDF. It doesn't concatenate first. For whatever reason that was decided, that's what it does.\nThe quick workaround is to go to Print, then save as PDF from there. This will save all pages opened in the same window.\n", "Q: How do I bring individual windows of an application to the front? When I have multiple browser or VSCode windows I sometimes want to look at things side by side. But when I bring VSCode to the front with Cmd+Tab they all come to the front and often hide the thing I wanted to look at.\nHow do I only show some windows?\n\nA: This works only for one window at a time: after navigating to desired app using ⌘-⇥ keep holding command key and press ↓ (down-arrow). This will bring up App Exposé i.e preview of all windows of current app. You can navigate to desired window using arrow keys and bring it forward by pressing ⏎ (enter).\nIf you have lot of windows or they have similar visual layout you can use quick view by pressing spacebar to make certain that you bring forward correct window.\n", "Q: What is this unknown 10-digit device address? Found on an iPhone I saw this unknown address under my personal hotspot summary on an iPhone:\ne:69:a5:97:7:17\nCan this 10-digit number be a MAC address?\n\n\nA: On Apple platforms, I’ve never had issues with the leading 0 being dropped by formatters that developers use or entering them in fields.\ne:69:a5:97:7:17 and 0e:69:a5:97:07:17 are the same values\nThese are hexadecimal representation of numbers and not text strings.\n\nA: Yes, \"e:69:a5:97:7:17\" is a MAC-address. You would perhaps more commonly see it written as:\n0E:69:A5:97:07:17\n\nMAC-address of this type are always 48-bits long. They're commonly represented as 6 numbers (0-255) represented in hexadecimal and separated by colons. Similarly to how you can write ordinary base-10 numbers, leading zeroes in each hexadecimal number can be left out.\nThe digit E in \"0E\" means that the address is a locally administered, unicast address.\nThat an address is locally administered means that it is assigned locally on this particular network, and only has a meaning on this particular network.\nIn contrast, a globally administered address is typically assigned by the manufacturer of a device, and would be valid across networks. Such an address can typically be traced to a device manufacturer, such as for example Apple, or a network interface microchip manufacturer, such as for example Realtek.\nBasically this means that this MAC-address could really be any device on this local network - you would have to check your devices to know, which one it is. In your setup it is typically a phone, tablet, or similar.\n", "Q: Does handwriting recognition require mobile data? I gather that scribble now allows handwriting recognition in any iOS app. Does it require mobile data or is everything on-device? (I do not yet have an Apple Pencil so cannot test this for myself)\n\nA: The handwriting recognition done by Scribble is performed on-device. There's no need for a mobile data connection to a cloud service in order to perform the actual recognition.\nHowever, you will at some points need an internet connection to download the Scribble system itself (unless your iPad was acquired a new iOS version that already has this feature).\n", "Q: Upgrade to Monterey, now Automator action doesn't find python any longer Ubuntu variant here but now the question in Apple OS X\n$ \"/System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py\" -o out.pdf *.pdf\nenv: python: No such file or directory\n\nHow can I resolve error about Python after upgrading to the latest OS X?\n\nA: Three of Apple's Automator actions call on python2, despite Apple removing it. They won't run under python3 without modification.\n1. Install python2.\nThe scripts call env python, so you can install python2 direct from python.org (you'll also need to pip pyobjc).\n2. Use Apple's own Quick Action \"Create PDF\" to Combine PDFs.\nThis works well for combining PDFs in the Finder, but if you want to use the action as part of an Automator workflow, consider Shortcuts.app instead, whose PDF actions don't use python.\n3. Use an updated python3 script for PDF manipulation.\nI've produced (better) python3 scripts for a range of PDF manipulation, including concatenation, and a grid.\nhttps://github.com/benwiggy/PDFsuite/tree/master/Python3\nYou can include them in Automator or Shortcut.app's Run Shell Script action, which offers any installed languages. (Select \"Pass Input as Arguments\")\nAgain, if you install python3, you'll need to pip3 pyobjc to get the necessary ObjC bridge library.\n\nA: $ head -5 '/System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py'\n#! /usr/bin/env python\n#\n# join\n#   Joing pages from a a collection of PDF files into a single PDF file.\n#\n\nSo Apple removed python but forgot to update Automator actions.

To quote from the documentation:\n\nTo support launchd, a program named daemondo is provided by MacPorts\nbase that serves as an adapter between launchd and daemons\n(“executable” StartupItems) or traditional Unix startup scripts that\nstart daemons (“script” StartupItems).\n\nref https://guide.macports.org/chunked/reference.startupitems.html\n", "Q: How can I get fast external ssd safely? I want to get Thunderbolt speeds for my M1 Mac Mini for a low price, but it's confusing.  If I buy a fast external drive, I may get slow speed because of low power.  If I buy a powered thunderbolt 3 hub, I can get faster speed, but all the powered hubs sold on Amazon have people complaining that their ports were fried by those hubs.  Is there a safe hub?  Is there a powered drive that doesn't cost the moon?  What's the solution?\n\nA: There is no necessity for a Thunderbolt drive to require a hub between it and the computer.\nThere'a also some possible confusion between \"Thunderbolt drives\" and \"USB-C drives\", as both use the same port/connector. Most portable drives that do not require a separate power supply are likely to be USB-C, rather than TB.\nTrue Thunderbolt drives are likely to be larger units, such as RAID systems, that have their own power supply.\nThere have been reports of cheap USB-C hub that have a power supply coming in causing problems with M1 Macs. But this relates to charging Macs with batteries, and so does not affect a Mini.\nThere have also been problems reported with the connection speed of external drives on M1 Macs.\nhttps://eclecticlight.co/2022/04/18/m1-thunderbolt-ports-dont-fully-support-usb-3-1-gen-2/\nThis may not be enough information to remove all confusion. I would also ask what you plan to use the drive for, and whether high speeds are essential.\n", "Q: How to run \"node index\" from a folder in terminal I've managed to open the terminal in the right folder using AppleScript. but I can't figure out how to make it run node index.\nHow the line of code looks so far:\ndo shell script \"open -a 'Terminal' ~/Competitor\\\\ Monitoring/Magic\"\n\nThe idea is to package it as a program and run it daily through a calendar action.\n\nA: You may have the cart before the horse here (or even two carts if you really want launchd or cron to schedule your process to run).\nI would save your command to a script file and test it with your chosen shell (zsh recommended) and when it works manually, rename it to file.command and then open the file directly\nopen ~/Competitor\\ Monitoring/Magic/run_node.command\n\nHere is a bash example on letting the script check your directory if you don’t want to hard code them. It’s simpler to put everything in the same folder, though and then you don’t need any of the checking of path at all or passing the path to the script or command to the application after it launches.\nYour script might be as simple as:\n#!/usr/bin/env zsh\n\nnode index\n\n", "Q: Can’t get rid of “Finish setting up family sharing” badge Even after I complete all the steps, the notification just comes back:\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this a bug or can I solve this without asking Apple for support?\n\nA: It's a bug. Try force quitting Settings.\nIf that doesn't work, restart your iPhone.\nIf that doesn't work either, there's probably nothing you can do about it except waiting for Apple to fix it in a new version of iOS (because you probably don't want to try setting up your device from scratch again, which also might now fix it).\n", "Q: Disable lag when using caps lock key to toggle input language I have my caps lock key set to toggle input language between English and Russian.\nThere's a slight 'lag' — I have to hold it down for slightly longer than a \"normal key\".

I would be happy to disable the traditional function of the caps lock key if it means I can achieve this.\nI'm using a MacBook Pro 14,1 on Monterrey.\n\nA: I was struggling with same problem and I've finally found the solution! And it's pretty easy:\n\n*\n\n*Firstly go to modifier keys settings (you can just search for 'customize modifier keys') and set the Caps Lock key for the Caps Lock function (not the 'Globe' one!)\n\n*Then enable 'Use Caps Lock to switch input sources' option in keyboard->'input sources' (or search for it)\n\nDoing so should enable instant switching between languages instead of calling the 'globe' button which causes that strange lag.\n", "Q: Is there anyway to have your iPhone notifications on Windows 10?

It never appears.\nIt's not in my user folder either, nor in documents nor pictures folders. Where is it saved?\n\nA: I don't know whether this is supposed to be a feature or a bug, but it appears that if you drag the preview anywhere before the file is created on the desktop, then the file is never created.\nThe 'fix' is to wait for the file to appear on the desktop.\nYou can speed this up by disabling the preview.

For some unknown reason these have just stopped working today - nothing has changed that I'm aware of.\nHere's the shell script that I'm trying to run:\ncd 'Users/jsmith/Backup Testing'; /usr/bin/zip -r '/Volumes/Backups/ Projects/12052022 181915.zip' 'Databases'\n\nwhich is returning the following error when I run this manually in the Terminal app:\ncd: no such file or directory: Users/jsmith/Backup Testing\nzip warning: name not matched: Databases\n\nI can't see what has changed here to cause this as it was working fine a few days ago and isn't today and I haven't installed any new software that I can recall in the past few days.\nThe paths to the folders are correct and I've checked them many times so the Databases folder and the parent folder definitely do exist here.\n\nA: Adding a leading slash before Users resolved this for me. Strangely this has worked for many years without issue so still puzzled as to why this stopped working. The AppleScript was simply just calling do shell script myScriptName\n", "Q: Is there a way to alert on disk usage (or disk space left) prominently in iOS? Is there a way to show disk usage (and disk space left) prominently in iOS by issuing alerts when threshold is met?\nI wish I could see my disk usage (and remaining disk space) like \"10GB/256GB remaining\" prominently every time I use my iPhone (iPhone 13, iOS 15) much like I can see the date/time and battery % every time.\nIdeally I can set a threshold, below which the OS will alert me rather than depend on the OS to decide that.\nIs there a way I can do this on iOS 15?\n\nA: Not in the status bar where date, time, battery status etc. are displayed, but you can find apps that can show disk usage in the Notification Center. Here's one example. No alerts, but you can get the info with one swipe.\n", "Q: Why is my browser hogging the focus in MacOS? I have a strange situation, which has now occurred with two browsers (Chrome and Edge).  I'm running MacOS 11.6.5 on a Macbook Pro 13\" 2017.\nAfter a while of running with no issue, I will try and use a different application - could be anything, iTerm, VirtualBox, Teams, Slack, Finder, whatever - but the browser will still appear to take the focus, even if I minimise or hide the browser window.\nWhat it looks like:\n\nWhat it means is that I cannot actually click on buttons or enter text in any other application when this happens - tremendously annoying.\nThe only way I have found to actually use any other application in this situation is to quit the browser application completely.  Closing windows, minimising, hiding, don't work.\nDoes anyone know why this happens, or what I can do to troubleshoot further?\n\nUpdate: just closing the browser isn't enough to fix the problem, interestingly.  If I re-open the browser, it happens straight away.  I need to reboot to be able to go back to fully working normal state.\n\nA: I don't have a neat solution.\nIn my case, the problem happens when I try to sync my Google account in System Preferences. When opens the browser in order to authenticate, all programs lose focus except the browser, having the same annoying behaviour if I close and reopen the browser again. When I cancel the sync process and quit System Preferences, sometimes works normal again.\nBut, all the focus problem seems to be related to the SafariLaunchAgent process. As Activity Monitor also loses focus until the navigator closes, I quit the navigator and then kill that process, saving me a reboot.\n\nA: I have the same problem and have found a workaround, which is to make Safari your default browser until you're done linking accounts:\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > General, set Default Web Browser: to Safari\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Internet Accounts, update passwords via Safari OAUTH flow\n\n*Set Default Web Browser back to what it was.\n\nApple must have introduced this bug recently via the SafariLaunchAgent mentioned above.\n", "Q: External Thunderbolt SSDs not showing space after deleting files I have two external Samsung X5 2TB Thunderbolt 3 SSDs.  Both of them work fine after I reformat them.  But when I delete files (and empty the recycle bin), the space on them does not increase.  In order to get space back, I need to empty it, reformat, then rebuild up files on it.\nSo far I have tried the following:\n\n*\n\n*Enabling TRIM.  It's enabled, does nothing.\n\n*Showing hidden files/folders to make sure nothing is hiding on the drive.  There's nothing there, trash on the volume is empty, etc.\n\n*I've tried running \"First Aid\" in Disk Utility.  It runs fine and finishes but it doesn't fix the problem.\n\nWhat could be causing this?  I am running MacOS Monterey on an M1 Max laptop.\n\n\n\n\nA: APFS disks do not release the space for deleted files immediately. The files will still exist in an APFS snapshot, which records the state of the disk at a point in time.\nSnapshots will be deleted after 24 hours; or after the disk is backed up by Time Machine. The space may be recovered by the file system if needed for new files.\nThe Terminal command:\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n\nwill list all the snapshots stored on the drive.\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots /Volumes/Name_of_disk\n\nwill remove them.\nHowever, the snapshots' size is usually shown as \"Purgeable\", so I don't know why you're seeing Zero Purgeable space.\n\nA: Just to update this, I tried reformatting as HFS and it does work to delete and recover space.  I'm still not sure why APFS is jacked up on these particular Thunderbolt3 SSDs (the same problem is not happening on my internal SSD, other external SSDs, etc) but it doesn't work.\n", "Q: Why are some 3D buildings more detailed than others in iOS's Maps app?

It seems like the Air can tell the difference between the headsets beyond the fact that they are both TRRS.\n\nIs this is a known issue for certain Macbook models? Is there something I can try, to get the Air to recognize the HTC headset mic?\nUPDATE\nArmed with the info from @tetsujin re: CTIA vs OMTP, I used a multimeter to discover the ground in both headsets. I measured resistance between the tip & second ring, and between the tip & sleeve. Only the tip & second ring registered resistance, so they're both CTIA. There was one difference: the HTC resistance was 18 ohms while the iPhone headset was 36 ohms. I have no idea whether that makes a difference to the Macbook Air.\nAlso, since the Macbook Pro 2019 recognizes the HTC headset mic, I assume that it has to be CTIA (my brief research leads me to believe that TRRS sockets only accept one standard, not both).\nI vaguely recall having the same issue with another Macbook Pro (2016 I think; I don't have this anymore) that didn't recognize the mic unless the headset was an Apple one, even though Android phones could recognize the mic for both headsets. Which leads me to believe older Macs were possibly treating Apple headsets differently, but newer ones don't distinguish any more.\nHowever, none of this gets me any closer to a solution.\n\nA: There are many standards for mini headset jacks [TRRS]\nThe two most common are CTIA & OMTP. They are not interchangeable.\nOMTP was preferred on earlier phones, but CTIA was decided by Apple & seems to be becoming the default.\nIn the simplest terms, the mic & ground connections are reversed in each type, making them incompatible.\nThere's a simple guide at CableChick - Understanding TRRS and Audio Jacks\n\nand a more comprehensive one at Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)#PDAs_and_mobile_phones\n", "Q: Is there anyway to speed up the animation when switching between spaces? This has been bothering me for a while now. When I got my new 16\" M1 Pro MacBook Pro with a variable refresh rate display (ProMotion) I realized that the animation when switching between spaces was much longer than my 13\" M1 MacBook Pro. I was wondering if there is any command buried deep inside macOS that would allow me to modify the speed of the animation. Thanks for your time!\n\nA: You will have to switch to 60Hz refresh rate in monitor settings, after that, you won't have to wait almost a full second before you can interact with windows on the space you've switched to.\nIt seems to be a bug of Pro Motion variable refresh rate\n", "Q: Why a new M1 brand new Mac takes so long to start after login? I have no application starting or loading anything when the mac starts.\nI start my mac, see the login window, type my password and after that it takes a long time to login. I guess 2 to 4 minutes to login while the progress bar slowly advances.\nI remember when this mac was new, 2 months ago and it would take seconds after typing the password to see the desktop and be able to operate the computer but with time, this time increased and there are days worse than others, where it takes longer.\nI am proficient on terminal and other advanced stuff, if your explanation requires that.\nIs there something I can do to make this faster?\n\nA: @SolarMike comment gave me other ideas and I have discovered the culprit. I have two USB disks permanently connected to my computer. Those take time to mount and makes the computer slow to login. Apple should mount these on the background just after showing the desktop.\nI will try to replace those with SSD in the near future to make it less annoying.\nNOTE:\nI have discovered the problem.\nThe problem is that I had all my USB disks formatted with APFS. DON'T DO THAT IF YOU ARE USING NON-SSD DISKS.\nI was forced to use an old mac to reformat those disks using encrypted journaled HFS+ disks (thanks to Apple, Monterey is not able to format disks using HFS+) and the problem was solved.\n", "Q: Macbook Air Charging Habit I'm using Macbook air 2020 M1, use it for my main driver, and I usually work quite a lot both in workplace and home.\nSince MBA 2020 has amazing battery life, usually I don't bring my charger to workplace but charge all the time when I work at home. Thus, battery charging cycle on that habit is 100% on starting day and down to around 20% at the end of day. When I work at home I have it fully charged and keep it plugged in to power until morning (when I ready to go to my workplace).\nMy question is, is that charging habit okay for my battery healthy? Or is there any better charging habit recommendation?\n\nA: You are using the battery in a very good manner. I would let it optimize charging and carry on. Not regularly using the battery is the hardest thing you can do, but Apple has made good strides to prevent that from prematurely aging the chemistry.\nRun these M1 macs hard is my advice.\nIf you think you’ll use this for 5 years, I might get AppleCare (ongoing) so you can have them swap the battery around year 4. Price out a paid out of warranty swap and decide if you lose if you only have that one service in the first 5 years. My MacBook one went 6 years before I paid for a battery swap.\n", "Q: Most homebrew installed commands outputs \"zsh: killed\" When I type brew, I get the output:\nzsh: killed     brew\n\nWriting out the whole path still gives the same output, so it doesn't seem like a path problem.\nFurthermore, running /bin/bash gives the output:\nzsh: killed     /bin/bash\n\nI changed the names of .zshrc and .zprofile, yet the problem still persisted.\nThis also doesn't work on programs like pyenv. I also reinstalled xcode-select, yet the problem still persists. Furthermore, using the bash shell simply gives \"process completed\" (with deleted .bashrc and .bash_profile files).\nI have both iterm2 and terminal, and running \"/bin/zsh -x\" on my mac terminal outputs stuff about iterm2, so I'm not sure what's happening there.\n\nA: I was able to solve this problem. I suspected that some login item made my /bin/bash turn weird. So under someone's recommendation I ran mac in safe mode, and found that everything ran perfectly. Thus, it was a specific login item which screwed up my bash.\nFor me, it was the yabai window management utility, as there must have been something in the startup script which screwed up my shell.\n\nA: The first two things I check is uptime and ps -ef | wc to make sure you don’t have runaway processes and the default limits. If the system is not healthy enough to run that, restart and if it still immediately kills the shell, start again but in safe mode.\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/start-up-your-mac-in-safe-mode-mh21245/mac\nHopefully these triage steps let you know the Mac is configured and runs well after a start and you can watch for something that’s added that exhausts your process count.\nOnce you’re sure it’s not process count and repeatably just brew that crashes or gets killed, restart normally, and look in the console for what specifically is crashing.\nPay particular attention to the status of Rosetta 2 and which brew tools are installed for which processor architecture on your Mac.\nsoftwareupdate --install-rosetta \n\nThe output of brew doctor might be particularly helpful in this situation once obvious things are ruled out.\n", "Q: How to use input variable in .zshrc alias?

You can simply define a function where $1 refers to the first argument given:\nfunction mrc() { php artisan make:controller \"$1\" --resource; }\n\nYou possibly want to put this in your ~/.zshrc so you don't have to run this every time you open a new terminal.\nIf the command should be available in a child shell you also want to use:\nexport -f mrc\n\nNow you should be able to type mrc controllerName and get the desired output.\nFor reference (as suggested by nohillside) : Make a Bash alias that takes a parameter?

Is there some way to prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nA: I have exactly the same experience. My interpretation is that Apple have fully released version 13.4 Command Line Tools for Xcode. After installation, in System Information the version is given as 13.4 with no mention of beta or RC.\nSo, don't worry, Apple is asking you to install what is now the current version of Command Line Tools.\nNote, Command Line Tools is (or can be) a separate install to Xcode and is updated via the Software Update mechanism.

Is there a way to check the serial number of my MacBook motherboard that shipped with my MacBook if I have the machine serial number? I'd like to check if a 3rd-party repair shop swapped out my motherboard. (so I can't be sure that the serial number of the motherboard that is currently in my Macbook is indeed the one that originally came with it)\nOr is the motherboard serial number the same as the Macbook's (I have not opened any Macbook before so I do not know this.)\n\nA: My experience when I had the motherboard replaced in a 2016 MacBook is that the motherboard does not have a separate serial number. When a motherboard is replaced, the MacBook's serial number is zapped into the replacement motherboard. In my case, the repairer forgot to do that so it came back without serial number (except that etched onto the case) and I had to return the MacBook for the serial number to be zapped onto the motherboard.\nSo, if the motherboard has been replaced and the repairer has done things correctly, you can't tell the difference.\n\nA: Click Apple logo on top left of MacBook screen > About this Mac.

I would like to connect my Macbook (Retina, 12-inch, 2017) to 2 screens simultaneously. I've seen people using two Multi-Ports/Adapters/Hubs connecting them to 2 different USB-C inputs, but I only have a single USB-C type input. I was wondering if it is possible for me to use an HDMI splitter (1 HMDI to 2 HDMI) connected to my Multi-Port plugged into my single USB-C input and stream to the 2 screens. Thanks\n\nA: No, sorry.  Just one display.\nFrom EveryMac:\n\"The final Retina MacBook models -- the \"Mid-2017\" series -- can simultaneously support the internal display as well as up to 4096x2304 at 60 Hz on an external display.\"\n\nA: You could look into DisplayLink technology. With that technology you can connect a single display over USB, and then you can daisy chain another compatible display to the first, giving you two external displays.\nI am a semi-happy user of DisplayLink monitors, but with every new driver and OS update new issues can arise (e.g. no clamshell support), which can be annoying.\n\nA: Apple hardware is apparently capable of supporting more than one screen on a single USB-C port but MacOS does not support this.  Installing Windows or Linux “unlocks” this capability on most Apple laptops with USB-C, which implies a workaround in running MacOS in a virtual machine.  If enough people complain to the right places then maybe someone will write new drivers for MacOS and allow this function.\nOne other workaround I’ve seen is using an adapter that treats two separate displays as one large display to the computer.  These are rare and expensive, and I’m not sure they are even made any more given the prevalence of wide screen displays and support for dual displays on a single port from Windows and Linux.\nOne other answer gives DisplayLink as an option, and that will certainly work.  That’s a very simple GPU that connects by USB (as opposed to ThunderBolt which is more capable) and by being a separate GPU it has many of the benefits and downsides of any other solution that contains a separate GPU.\nOne option, which may be overkill, is to get an eGPU (external GPU).  This is distinct from the DisplayLink option in that eGPU implies a Thunderbolt connection rather than USB.  There’s many to choose from and they will almost certainly support at least two displays from a single USB-C connection.  I call this overkill because it is a very expensive solution, a solution meant for gamers and video editors that need the extra processing power as opposed to simply getting more screen space.\nSo, the answer is yes and no.  Yes, it is possible.  But no, this is not something Apple supports out of the box.  You will need extra hardware and/or software.  Any software solution will impact computer performance, and any hardware solution will impact your wallet.\n", "Q: How can I stop VNC/Remote access freeze without rebooting or logging out current user?

When you're done with the session type exit and a log file with all the input/output will be written (an example can be found in this other answer).\n\nI found that the first method handles colours in the output better: it simply ignores it and writes the text to the file.\nThe script method writes control characters such as [1m[0m[1m[36m instead, which creates noise in your log.

Now, however, my computer decided to boot me up into Asahi Linux when I started charging it after it died. Usually, when this happens and I want to go back to macOS, I just hold Opt and I can get back to my macOS partition, but this time it won't work. I've tried booting into safe-mode (Shift), Recovery Mode (Cmd+R), resetting SMC (Shift+Opt+Ctrl+Pwr), and resetting NVRAM (Cmd+Opt+P+R), all to no avail.\nIt seems like possibly my keyboard is just not picking up commands until afterward, since when Asahi Linux's terminal boots up, I'm not able to type commands at all for a few seconds, or I'll be stuck on Caps-lock or something fishy like that.\nNo water damage or physical damage happened in between uses, so the problem is likely software-related.\nThis is on an M1 Pro MacBook Pro 16-inch 2021 edition.\nAny thoughts? I know this is quite a weird issue, I'm hoping I just missed something simple but I can't figure out what that might be.\n\nA: M1 Macs don't use the same key commands as Intel at boot - see\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl82829c17/mac\nBasically, from completely shut down, you press & hold the Power button until options appear.\nTry from there...\n", "Q: Equivalent of shift tab for Notes on macOS How do I achieve this,\nhello\n    how\n\nto,\nhello\nhow\n\nthat is I want to reverse tab.\nOn Notes, I select how, then press shift + tab\nit does nothing.\nit does not reverse tab.\n\nA: Notes doesn't use  Tab ⇥   for indentation, it uses  Cmd ⌘   ]  &  [ \n Tab ⇥   sometimes works, but it acts more like a 'true' Tab, ie it will work on a single word in the middle of a line, rather than the entire line, & doesn't have an inverse.

Each row there is labelled with a nutritional label, such as \"Oats\", followed by columns giving corresponding calories, Carbs, etc (see image below).\n\nIn sheet \"A\", I refer to each food with a subsequent column of quantity as shown below.\n\n\nObjective\nFrom sheet \"A\", I am trying to calculate the calroies of a meal, so for each ingredient I want to multiply its quantity with its equivalent calories per 100 grams as provided in sheet \"B\".\nRequirement for the formula: the ability to refer to a cell of another sheet based on a textual condition from the current cell. For example, I want to be able to say the quantity at hand corresponds to \"Oats\" as the column preceding \"Quantity 1\" is \"Oats\". So intuitively, I have 50 grams of Oats (sheet A) that I want to multiply by the calories of Oats (taken from sheet B per 100g). So I'm trying to express the formula such that it automatically takes the preceding cell to quantity and treats its text, here \"Oats\", as the cell reference to sheet B.\nThis is the first time I am trying to do dynamic referencing. My attempt (not working) has so far been along the lines of using INDIRECT function to refer to corresponding cell of sheet B given the text \"Oats\". So I have tried:\nA::Table 1::E2 * B::Table 1::Oats&\"::B2\"\nBut it gives an error. Even if it worked, this would still not be what I really wanted to achieve, because my ideal intention is the ability to the preceding cell of B2 from sheet B without having to explicitly specify \"Oats\".\n\nQuestion:\n\n*\n\n*Where am I going wrong with my syntax in the formula in referring to another sheet (B) and taking its cell corresponding to 2nd column of the row \"Oats\"? Should I somehow be using the functions INDIRECT and ADDRESS together (such as in this example)?\n\n\n*Is there a way to generalize this, where we no longer have to specify even the food, but we'd just select the quantity and the food would automatically be taken as the cell preceding it (row-wise)?\n\nA: You could use xlookup function. If table containing calories is named Nutritional_value and have structure you provided in screenshot this formula works: xlookup takes value from column Ingridient 1 in current table, looks for same value in first column (A) in Nutritional_value table and returns corresponding value from Calories column; then it's multiplied with value in column Quantity 1 and divided with 100 (to get correct calories):\nXLOOKUP(Ingridient 1 'Monday - breakfast';Nutritional_value::A;Calories)×Quantity 1 'Monday - breakfast'÷100\n\nHowever, this approach is not scalable very well (you must do the same for other ingridients in a meal) and if you want make any analysis it's poor design. IMHO better would be to have one row per ingredient (data table) and analysis should be made in Pivot Table\n", "Q: Screen Sharing changes resolution for no reason I'm using the built-in Screen Sharing client in macOS to connect to a Mac Mini 2020 M1 by running Connect to Server in Finder and choosing the vnc://machine-name.local link.\nThe connection works fine, except for one thing: It keeps changing resolution approximately every 10 seconds. The effect is that what is shown in the client window changes between the whole screen and a fraction of the screen.\nIf I open the Displays setting through VNC it just shows the ordinary settings for the ordinary display. I can set it to Scaled and specify a certain resolution, but that does not help.\nThe Screen Sharing Preferences has a few options that seem related to the display, e.g. Show full size and Show the screen at full quality. I have changed them in all combinations that I can think of. Nothing has made any difference.\nThere is also the Scaling toggle in the toolbar of the Screen Sharing app. Again, it doesn't seem to do anything (what is it supposed to do?).\nI have also tested connecting with the RealVNC vnc-viewer, it had the same issue.\nThe Mac mini is not really headless, it does have a monitor connected to HDMI, but the monitor is mostly turned off.\n\nA: I lack the necessary reputation to add a comment, so please bare with me if I add it here.\nI believe that setting a specific display resolution beforehand (e.g. 2560 x 1440) is important for its stability during the connection.\nWhen you clicked Scaled did you get additional resolutions by pressing and holding down the Option key or was it one of the four recommended resolutions, scaling from Larger Text to More Space?\nOtherwise, I'd recommend installing Display Menu or EasyRes (both Free on Mac App Store) to set that resolution.\nIf none of these work, other Screen Sharing protocols such as Apple Remote Desktop (pretty expensive) or the two solutions from Astropad (Luna Display and Astropad itself in Mac-to-Mac Mode) might work better.\nMore often than not your Mac Mini will be running Headless or the plugged screen will be turned off. An inexpensive solution would be an HDMI Dummy Plug (an adapter designed to plug into the HDMI port of your Mac). Newertech, for example, has one of these at a very affordable price (they had one at under $15, but I can't seem to find the link right now). This will allow you to have a display emulator with a reliable preset resolution.\n\nA: You have several options:\nCheck the display settings on the Mac Mini\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences and:\n\n*Change the display resolution to \"Standard\"\n\n*Switch any enhancement like True Tone etc off.\n\n*Check the color profile and change it to default if necessary.\n\nCheck Energy Saver on the Mini\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences and head to Energy Saver\n\n*Search for Automatic Graphics Switching option and untick it.

But, for recent Intel MacBooks, Apple provides some assistance for use cases like yours so that the battery is in fact not at 100% all the time.\nApple Support says (slightly paraphrased):\n\"Battery Health Management\" functionality is on by default after you upgrade to macOS 10.15.5 or later on a Mac notebook with Thunderbolt 3 ports.\nTo check that it is enabled follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu , then click Battery.\n\n*Click Battery in the sidebar, then click Battery Health.\n\nMake sure that \"Manage battery longevity\" is selected.\n", "Q: Should I upgrade my Intel E7600 CPU for an E8600 in my iMac 27\" late 2009? It all begun when my factory Seagate Barracuda started clicking. I knew the end was nigh for my beloved iMac 27\" 10,1. I then watched some tutorials, did some research and realised I could do this and upgraded it with a fantastic OWC Mercury Electra 1 TB SSD kit.\nResults were great, honestly feels like a new computer. Addicting I would say. I had 8 GB of RAM and yesterday I maxed it out with four 4 GB Crucial DDR3 modules.\nI already had the best (for the time) option for the GPU so the only thing left (for staying in the official in-period specs) is to swap out my Intel Core 2 Duo 3,06 GHz (model E7600) for a Core 2 Duo 3,33 GHz (E8600): 3 MB cache vs 6 MB cache and around 10-15% gains in performance (maybe?). For a grand total of 25 € shipped.\n\nHonestly, I watched a couple videos and read the official Apple Technical Guide about removing the logic board and I feel I might be pushing my luck a little bit. Especially all those cables, I have this crunching feeling that I could snap something that sat there undisturbed for 13 years. And removing that infrared receiver behind the front Apple logo... simply scares me.\nBut on the other hand, I could officially max out the specs for a 2009 machine! The thrills! The excitement! Not to mention giving a good cleaning inside, renew the thermal paste, change the CR2032 battery (what is it used for anyway?)... I cleaned what I could during the SSD surgery but there is room for more by removing MOAR.\n\n*\n\n*First of all, I think I duly did my researches but this is a plug & play swap, right? No funny business like EPROM flashing or macOS patching. I also know i5 & i7 are not officially supported on my board.\n\n\n*Someone went down that route? Should I? Shouldn't I? I sort of see myself as a DIY guy and carried out various successful projects (on cars too) but I fear the unknown.\n\n\n*Are the perf gains actually noticeable like the SSD + RAM upgrades or am I just lying to myself and the only benefit will be knowing that I maxed out my machine by gleefully staring at the \"About This Mac\" window?\n\n\n*Words of caution? Advice? Should I just move on with my life instead of following this inane goal even if the idea of putting some more life in this iMac has been a great project during those last days and is pretty motivating?\nCheers for any input!\n\nA: The RAM and SSD upgrades are the most useful upgrades you can make, in terms of % improvement, cost, and ease of task.\nThe replacement is still just a 2-core CPU (Wolfdale, 45nm, August 2008), with a Geekbench score of 456/798. OK, that's up from 380/672, but in the 'real world', you're unlikely to observe the 18-20% gain that the figures suggest. There are still bottlenecks from the lack of more cores, disk speed, RAM speed and the bus that joins them all together.\nYou're also running an OS from 2017 for which your Mac just makes the cut. If this upgrade allowed you to run a later OS, like with some CPU upgrades for Mac Pros, then that would be a different story.\nThere's a danger of Spinal Tap-like spec-chasing here. ;-) Yes, it's one higher, but one isn't much. (Nor is eleven.)\nCompare that to an iMac from even 2017, which scores 967/3369. Or an M1 iMac, with 1720/7476. (To say nothing of faster bus, memory and disk speeds.)\nThe question is, how many more years do you think you can usefully get out of this Mac? High Sierra is already below minimum requirements for a lot of new software. How long before your Mac unable to cope with things like modern web standards, peripheral connections, even Wifi connectivity, as the minimum spec draws up?\nIt will keep working, of course, and you continue to use it until something breaks. But don't expect it to do more.\n(The coin battery maintains the system clock, btw.)\n\nA: If your main use of the computer is for the internet then I would say it's a good investment to continue with upgrades to these type of older computers. You can upgrade the GPU, graphics card. I sell them if your interested. Plus you can install Open core legacy patcher so that you can run the latest macOS. I personally like these older computers because they are serviceable.   Today everything is made to break.\n", "Q: I can't share certain files and folder through SMB I am trying to share some folders and my external USB hard drive through smb for my local network.

The Apple Watch functionality has improved over time. An iPhone used to need to be left on and connected for Cellular to work on the Watch.\nI was under the impression that with advances in eSim and Software Updates the watch could now make and receive calls without any dependence on the iPhone, except perhaps for the occasional software update).\nRecently I learned that with AT&T that NumberSync is necessary and call do not ring on cellular unless the iPhone is left on and connected to the internet.\nWhat is the current state of cellular connectivity on Apple Watch? According to Apple.com Cellular allows you to leave your phone behind and just use the Watch, but does the phone need to be online somewhere?\n\nA: I would have to test this specific case to answer 1/2 of it for certain and I will get back & edit this part of my answer; unfortunately it does seem like this is now the case (as a NumberSync user myself).\nHowever, What should still independently work is if you were to call the ‘spare’ / ‘burner’ phone number which you may or may not recall that it has.\nYou can find this phone number in your AT&T account profile.\n\nA: AT&T.com has the option to download a new eSim to the Apple Watch from the Account page.

You will know it is downloaded when the macOS installer runs and presents its opening screen, don't do anything with the running installer!\nGo to your Applications folder and drag the \"Install macOS Monterey\" app onto a flash drive. Once that is done, quit the installer.\nThe installer will likely still be in Applications, you can keep it or trash it as you prefer.\nPlug the flash drive into the Mac to be upgraded and launch the installer. You can copy it to the HD first or run the installer right off the flash drive, either should work fine.\n\nA: For macOS versions up to 10.15, update packages are available directly from Apple: https://support.apple.com/downloads/macos\n\nFor macOS 11+, you'll only have access to \"full\" installers. (Some lists of direct links are available, e.g. https://mrmacintosh.com/macos-12-monterey-full-installer-database-download-directly-from-apple/ .) After running those, an Install macOS Monterey.app application shows up in /Applications, which you can use for updating.\nThis installer still seems to need access to the internet, though; the Hackintosh install processes seem to get around this by manually repacking + reconstructing the install .dmg [1], or manually unpacking SharedSupport.dmg [2]. Neither of these have worked for me, so far.\n(One possible thing to try is putting those modified .app installers onto a USB drive, but in my experience, a reboot + boot-from-USB install still wants access to the internet.)\n", "Q: Left hand side USB-C ports on 2017 MBP 15\" blocked Ive got a 2017 15\" Macbook Pro.\nThis model has 4x USB C ports (2 on each side) which can be used for pretty much anything from charging to connecting to an external display (as long as you have the right adaptors).\nRecently the 2 ports on the left hand side of the computer wont allow you to connect anything in there, you can put a USB-C male end in, but it will only go about 2/3rds in. My guess is that they have come ever so slightly mis-aligned with the aluminium frame of the computer.\nHas anyone seen or heard of this issue before ? Do you know how i can fix it ?\n\nA: The Thunderbolt ports are not part of the main logic board, so you would reconnect and/or replace that component to remedy both not working on the same side of the Mac.\nApple is doing the opposite of locking down their hardware recently. The design of them requiring skill to repair happened during the PPC to Intel transition, and they’ve steadily been adding more third party repair options and even DIY parts and guides and tool rentals.\nYour model won’t likely get an official repair guide, but this is not a challenging repair since it’s not dealing with a glued part like the battery or the Touch ID. Removing the part also allows the best chance to remove any debris or mis-alignment and inspect the physical condition of the ports. A lighted magnifier can also be used before you open the case as it might show many types of potential obstruction.\n\nA: One of the reasons that the male part of the USB Type-C port is only going in 2/3rd of the way in would be because of accumulation of some dirt or debris that is not blocking the port & obstructing the connector from going all the way in. The best way to check it is to see it under the light and if there is gunk then clean it with tweezers or toothpicks.\nIf not and then you see that there is a slight physical damage then please do that it to the genius bar to get it checked.\n", "Q: How can I remove keychain data from iOS? I have a phone and the only explanation I can arrive at is the app is re-identifying my device via keychain data, even after reinstalling the application.\nIs there a way how I can remove the keychain data from my phone to test if the Keychain is leaking identity? I am not talking about passwords only, the app saves some data and I need to remove it.\nI am okay removing all keychain data from my phone. All answers I see on the internet are for Mac. I am looking for something that works on iOS.\nI want to make sure ALL data is removed and that an app does not have knowledge of a previous session.\n\nA: Yes, I too was surprised to find an app where, despite the warning when deleting the app that all data would be deleted too, a reinstall retains all account information and data. The app I encountered does not use iCloud at all. I’m guessing it stores an identifying token in the device keychain and uses that token to retrieve data from a server.\nAccording to Apple Developer Technical Support person  ‘Quinn “The Eskimo!”’\non the Apple Developer Forums,\n\n*\n\n*This is currently expected behaviour despite being ‘an obvious privacy concern’\n\n*Apple tried to fix this around 2017 but enough app developers complained that they decided to keep it\n\n*However, Apple could theoretically fix this in the future without warning\n\nFor now, it seems that completely wiping your device before re-installing apps is the only practical way to go. And don’t restore from a backup after wiping either, as the backup could contain the old keychain data.\nTo quote some of the details Quinn ‘The Eskimo’ gave:\n\nFirst, a timeline:\n\n*\n\n*All versions of iOS prior to 10.3 beta preserve keychain items when an app\nis deleted.\n\nIMPORTANT This was most definitely an implementation detail of the\noriginal iOS keychain. Our keychain documentation has never specified what\nwould happen in this case.\n\n*\n\n*10.3 beta included a change that deleted such items.\n\n\n*That caused compatibility problems (apps were relying on the existing\nbehaviour, even though it wasn’t documented), so it was rolled back\nbefore 10.3 GM.\n\n\n*iOS 11 introduced the DeviceCheck framework, which provides a forward path\nfor one of the most common legitimate use cases of this behaviour. For\nmore info on this, see WWDC 2017 Session 702 Privacy and Your Apps.\nSecond, preserving keychain items on delete is an obvious privacy concern. As\nfar as I know Apple has not made any specific announcements as to how we\nintend to resolve this issue (1). However, I don’t think it would surprise\nanyone if the 10.3 behaviour returned at some point in the future. I would\nhope that we’d be more proactive about announcing such a change -- for\nexample, talking about it at WWDC -- but, as always, I can’t make any\npromises about The Future™.\n\n\nA: iOS used to retain keychain content even when you delete the whole app (I know for sure because an app I maintained relied on it). But this has changed in recent years and now it's deleted as well. Depending on your iOS version, you might see the old behavior.\nBut it's more likely the data is stored in your iCloud keychain. If you have a Mac, then you can use the macOS /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app and select iCloud on the left to see the content. Search for the app name or company name. Once you have found the item and are absolutely sure it's the right one, simply delete it.\nIf you can't find an entry or you're not sure which item to delete, contact the developer. It's probably the best option anyway as there might be a supported way in the app to remove/reset the data.\n\nA: Keychain data is stored (assuming you are signed into your Apple Account on the phone) in iCloud and synced to all your devices signed into iCloud.\nOn your iPhone you can turn off iCloud Keychain in:\nSettings > [Account name] > iCloud > Keychain\nJust turn off iCloud Keychain and (assuming that App does indeed use iCloud keychain) will all be gone from your phone.\n", "Q: Fresh OSX Install Failing I have a MacBook Pro A1990 EMC3215 (2018 15\", either i7 or i9 [I'm not sure which]).  I'm having trouble reinstalling the OS.  When I try a fresh install using Command-Option-r via WiFi, I get a -2100F fail code after about an hour.  I followed the steps on https://support.apple.com/en-za/HT201065 to get a fresh install of the OS.  At the \"Erase your Mac and reinstall MacOS\" step, I followed https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208496.\nI've tried to boot to recovery mode via Command-r, but the machine only goes to the prompt to enter the WiFi name and password.\nI created a bootable USB with Monterey on it.  (My other laptop is mid-2012, so I had to download the .pkg from https://mrmacintosh.com/macos-12-monterey-full-installer-database-download-directly-from-apple/.)  When I start with the USB plugged in (via a USB to C connector) and hold the Option key, the USB flashes and I do see the Install Monterey option.  However when I choose that option, I'm immediately given the WiFi prompt again, and the USB light goes dead.  All appearances suggest that the machine is trying a standard WiFi recovery.  After about an hour, I see a -2003F fail code.\nI suspect the problem is 1) the current boot is corrupted (hence the lack of Recovery Mode) and 2) the \"security chip that offers the prevention of external boot media to be used to startup a Mac\" as noted in https://osxdaily.com/2021/08/25/mac-wont-boot-bootable-disk-why/.  However, that article goes on to describe that deactivating this security feature requires one to boot into Recovery Mode, which I seem unable to access.\nI'll probably go into the office tonight or tomorrow to try a different WiFi connection.  (I'm doubtful about this as a solution; I'm currently on a home WiFi connection, which shouldn't be restricted.)  I don't have an ethernet to C connector, so ethernet's not a possibility.\nI'm currently in South Africa, so taking the laptop in to an Apple store isn't an option.\nAny ideas how I might proceed?\nThank you very much in advance for your help.\nEDIT: I seem to be able to boot up the laptop to act as an external drive by holding t on start.  However, when I connect my mid-2012 Catalina laptop using a USB to USB-C connector, I don't see an external drive.  I also don't see an external drive when I connect my 4th gen iPad to the laptop using a USB-C to USB-C connector.\n\nA: Long story short, my work WiFi allowed me to get to the Recovery Mode screen.  I'm shocked, but the online advice of trying a different WiFi connection really worked.  (I figured what's the difference between one WiFi connection and another.)\n", "Q: Finder corrupt files on copy to external ssd Problem: sometimes finder corrupts my files when copying to external ssd.\nReproduction methodology: copy via finder file to external ssd, then check this file\nmd5 -q ~/Downloads/path/to/source\nmd5 -q /Volumes/path/to/target\n\nand sometimes hashsum does not match.\nI`ve written a bash script to reproduce this problem with terminal cp, and its worked nicely without corrupting files\nScript Github Gist\nHow i can understand what happened with finder and where is the bug?\n\n*\n\n*MacOs: 12.3.1\n\n*Ssd: wd green (not sure about model), Disk utility\nfirst aid dont get any error. Ssd format - exFat\n\nPS: I`ve also tested this case on windows copy, no errors for 20+ files.\nPPS: Same issue on reddit (if we can solve this - can someone who has reddit account, link this thread for them)\n\nA: Most likely your problems is either caused by (a) a hardware defect, or (b) Finder updating metadata (stored inside your file) on copy.\nFor (a) this could be caused by problems with the SSD itself and/or the cable connecting it to the computer. There are various checksums in place during such a transfer, but ordinary USB mass storage does not guard against all types of failure, and Finder does not do a full read of the copied file to determine if the copy succeeded without errors.\nYou could try to rule out (a) by attempting the same copy with a different external disk and cable.\nFor (b) it is worth noting that some file types store metadata inside the files themselves (most commonly seen by end-users handling videos and photos). It might be that something you're doing triggers Finder to update such a metadata entry. This does not mean that the file is \"corrupted\" even though it is different than the original - although it might not be what you intended to happen.\n\nA: Just wanted to add that I am also having a very similar issue on a 2018 Mac Mini running macOS 12.0.1. My drives are all formatted as exFAT. I have not tried the Terminal command but going to try that this week.\nThe issue only started happening recently, maybe a few months ago. I can reproduce the issue on over 6+ drives. I have tried different HDD adapter cables. I have an NVME drive in a USB3 external enclosure that reproduces the problem. Copying from my home Windows machine and my Raspberry Pi 4, everything is fine.\nThe issue seems to be restricted to copying the files over USB on my Mac. I am using the Finder to drag and drop. The original video files look fine on the Mac, but after copying to an external drive now many have video tearing, sound issues, artifacts, etc. Very rarely some files are fine but it's few and far between.\n\nA: I am also experiencing the same issue on a 2015 15\" MBP.  Files downloaded to internal SSD are fine with no errors.  When I use finder to drag and drop to external HDD I often encounter small segmental errors (image becomes blocky and/or stops whilst file/audio continues to play).  I have tested this on 2x HDD and separate USB cables in seperate USB inputs on my MBP and have the same issue suggesting it is not a problem with either the HDD or cables.  I have found that restarting the computer sometimes fixes the problem temporarily, however the issue returns if my MBP is left on for extended periods of time.  This has happened in MacOS 12.3 and 12.4.  I am currently updating to 12.5 in the hope that this fixes the issue.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem as the OP with files being corrupted by Finder as they were copied to an attached USB disk and started a thread on the Apple Support Community https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253864981 to document and discuss it.\nThe OP didn't say where their problem files were coming from but my guess is QBitTorrent.\nIf you follow through this thread https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/16843 on Github, it appears to have been caused by an update to QBitTorrent that was not flushing memory mapped files to disk correctly in OSX. Upgrading to the latest QBitTorrent version - 4.4.5 - should fix it.\nYes, it's a really weird problem and the fix seems unrelated, but in this case I think it is the correct answer to the OP's problem. It worked for me.\n", "Q: Why did AirDrop change the file time attribute for one of my photos? I was copying over one of my photos from the Photos app using the AirDrop share option. Once the file copied over to my Mac I was very surprised to notice that the created and modified file time attributes were listed for the time the file was air dropped, not the actual content creation time like seen in the same File Attribute snippet shown below. Did AirDrop modify the file, what's going on here exactly?\n\n\nA: I believe there may be a few things at play that could account for this.\n1. Air Drop Failure\nJust now I was in the process of moving a bunch of low priority files off my device. At some point in the evening Air Drop failed a transfer. I took a screen shot of the moment and the notification as seen here\n\nWhen I walked backwards after noticing many minutes later that the files that were transferring did not match the dates that were expected I scrolled backwards to all those files created this evening. The first file that had the mismatching timestamp was listed just before the above screenshot in finder. That's strong evidence that something got corrupted on the iOS or macOS side at that time and the Air Drop app could no longer provide the file attribute data from the iOS device and was instead going with the macOS system time unfortunately.\n\nOn my macbook is some mysterious CPU surging occurring from mds and it's sibling mds_stores, each taking up 72.1% and 49.90% respectively surprisingly enough.\nAll photos share the same Created and Modified file system attributes and yet the embedded exif content created timestamp seems to be on a different clock that's actually moving.\n\n\n\n2. Bug in Photos\nI was reviewing another batch of air drops I just executed now starting at a date I think came after the air drop failure experience above. I found an curious inexplicable set of timestamps where the Created and Modified times stood still for a round of photos of a single subject. Take a look at the following screen snippets from Finder for these files\nImage 1\n\nCreated: Friday November 25, 2022 at 11:32 AM\nModified: Friday November 25, 2022 at 11:32 AM\nContent created: Friday November 25, 2022 at 11:07 AM\n\n\nImage 2\n\nCreated: Friday November 25, 2022 at 11:32 AM\nModified: Friday November 25, 2022 at 11:32 AM\nContent created: Friday November 25, 2022 at 11:08 AM\n\n\nImage 3\n\nCreated: Friday November 25, 2022 at 11:32 AM\nModified: Friday November 25, 2022 at 11:32 AM\nContent created: Friday November 25, 2022 at 11:09 AM\n\n\n", "Q: What happened to CreateMLUI?

Specifically, imagine we have Mac #1 talking to Mac #2 via a router and the goal is to access a webpage on Mac #2 from Mac #1 via a URL like this: http://myMachineNo2.local/~myUserName/myGreatSite.html. Where that URL maps to this file on the Mac #2: /Users/myUserName/www/myGreatSite.html. This kind of thing used to work off the shelf. Now, it seems to require some config edits. For instance, see here. Those instructions work for a local user working at Mac #2. That is, http://localhost/~myUserName/myGreatSite.html works. But, for me, these instructions will not grant access from Mac #1. What additional steps are required to grant Mac #1 access? Currently, I get 403 error: Forbidden: You don't have permission to access this resource.\nI am using Mojave but, it would be nice to see an answer with broad applicability.\n\nA: The pages you linked provide very precise instructions for getting started on a web site which will only be accessed from localhost.  It does not go any further.\nIf you look at the content of /etc/apache2/users/<user>.conf it includes the line Require host localhost. Change that to Require all granted.\nBut now you are exposed to the world, only protected by your router.\nBe very careful exposing Apache even to the local network, particularly as Mojave has an old version of Apache with various vulnerabilities.  If you want to run Apache on an old insecure macOS, I would make sure you have the latest Apache. You can install it using Homebrew.\n"]
