This will let you switch back and forth between mice, keyboard, monitors, with the press of a button, but you would need 2 computers connected to the switch. \nCheck this one out for multiseated device, which is what I believe you are trying to do. \n", "Q: Asus Vivo PC and Ubuntu installation Problem Bought a new pc couple of days ago, Asus Vivo Pc V60.

Efibootmgr doesn't seem to work at all from Ubuntu.\nAnyhow back to why I posted. I originally bought the vivo because of the UTube videos showing how easy it was to swap HDs. Of course that was made more difficult in the V60 which uses a notebook size HD and locks the lid with a screw. Opening the lid voids warranty etc...\nAnyhow I popped in an old notebook HD a couple of days ago installed via Live USB and rebooted to what I can only assume is what you saw.

Previously my OS was Window 7 and some day it began to show problems with booting and finally it didn't boot at all. I tried to repair it but it didn't get repaired. Then I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS alongside Windows and am impressed much by Ubuntu.\nSo I want to remove all my Windows files. I searched Google to know how to do it and I found OS-Uninstaller. I have some doubts before proceeding with OS-Uninstaller -\n\n\n*\n\n*I need to keep my photos, songs, movies and personal files in my system even if Windows is removed. Normally Windows files are installed in the C Drive. My personal files are not in the C Drive. So will removing Windows files affect my personal files ?\n\n*Did the OS-Uninstaller affect Ubuntu anyway ?\nPlease note that I want to remove only the Windows installation files(the files added to my system by Windows during its installation). I don't want to change the NTFS partition to any other format since there is a probability that I will install newer version of Windows later.\n\nA: A couple ways you could take a copy of all your files (from your Windows OS) and put them onto a separate disk (USB/DVD/CD/External HD) then remove Windows, by using Gparted in Ubuntu and format the partition that is formatted as 'NTFS'. You can then resize your Linux partition using Gparted as well.\nOnce you have your partitions you would then open your terminal Ctrl+Alt+T.\nType in: sudo update-grub to make sure your bootloader removes Windows from the menu\nYou could also copy directly from the Windows partition by mounting it  as well. This may be more advanced. But a GUI (graphical) program to do a lot of this is Disk Utility. (If you have a Mac it is pretty much the same program there as well) \n\nA: *\n\n*Boot off of an Ubuntu live DVD/flash drive. Open the file browser and copy any documents/pictures/other files from the Windows partition(s) (which will be listed on the left of the file browser window under \"Devices\") into your Ubuntu partition(s) (again listed under \"Devices\", you will want to go to /home/~yourusername~/Documents etc.).\n\n*Once the files have copied, open the Dash and search for Gparted. Open it; in the upper-right is a menu for the various storage devices connected to your system. Select the hard drive that has your Ubuntu/Windows dual boot on it, and then right click all the non-Ubuntu partitions (NTFS partitions, and exclude the swap partition) and select the \"Delete\" option. Once you have deleted all the Windows partitions, right-click the Ubuntu partition and select \"Resize/Move\". Drag the partition to fill all the empty drive area, and once you are satisfied with the setup, click the \"Apply All Operations\" button at the top of the window. If everything goes as planned, once the operation is finished you can reboot into your Ubuntu-only hard drive.\nGood luck, if things don't work out quite right let us folks here know, we'll try to help.\n", "Q: Cannot delete user - running '/usr/sbin/userdel' failed: Child process exited with code 16 When I tried to delete a user using the User Accounts window under Settings, I get the following error message:\nrunning '/usr/sbin/userdel' failed: Child process exited with code 16\nHow can I delete this user?\n\nA: *\n\n*Ensure that the user is logged out of any active sessions.\n\n*After doing above, close the 'Users Accounts' window and open it again in 'Systems Settings'\n\n\nIf the above did not work run userdel [username].

If one boots a live session, does an update to the live session and then create a usb boot drive, would it contain the updates?\n\nA: Your question is too brief, please be more specific.\nDo you mean already having USB live media with an overlay filesystem (to install updates and also keep files and settings) and installing (via ubiquity installer) from that updated USB live media to another drive that can be connected via SATA, eSATA, USB, etcetera?\nPackage cache on live media with overlay filesystem\nIn theory, if the location for cached packages is the same for the installer as it is for the live media's package manager and regular installations (where it is /var/cache/apt/archives/) and still contains up to date packages, then packages should be fetched from that directory instead of being downloaded again. You have to enable the option to download and install updates during installation, of course. As I said, this is a theory, one has to verify this behavior first.\nUsing the package cache on the fresh installation\nAlternatively you could copy the updated packages you already downloaded to /var/cache/apt/archives/ on the fresh installation and run the update manager (or use apt-get to see what will be updated and what will or is being downloaded).\nAlternatives\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I install software or packages without Internet (offline)?\n\nA: It is doable.

I'm currently using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and wanted to upgrade using the 14.04 LTS ISO.\nAny way?\nThanks in advance guys :)\n\nA: Solution 1: Burning the ISO of Ubuntu 14.04 and booting the DVD\nIf you burn the ISO image and boot with the DVD created, you'll be able to perform the upgrade. You just have to select the option for upgrading your current installation of Ubuntu 12.04. Your data will be kept and the setup process will try to reinstall the packages installed (even external ones), if possible (of course), at the end of the install process.\nIt is even possible to upgrade from a 32-bit edition of Ubuntu 12.04 to a 64-bit edition of Ubuntu 14.04 that way. Of course, in that case, no previous package can be reinstalled...\nOf course, it is not booting from the ISO itself (see Solution 2 below).\nSolution 2: Using an external disk drive with Virtual CD/DVD feature\nIf you have an USB external drive with virtual CD/DVD feature (some enclosures like Zalman ZM-VE300 allow that), you'll be able to boot on the ISO image mounted as if it was a real CD/DVD.\nIf you have an external disk drive, but no Virtual CD/DVD feature built-in, you might be interested by YUMI, MultiSystem or else.\nSolution 3: Creating an USB boot disk from the ISO with \"Startup Disk Creator\"\nYou can create an USB boot disk from the ISO with \"Startup Disk Creator\" which is included in Ubuntu by default. Just type \"Startup Disk Creator\" in the Dash.\nSolution 4: Upgrading via Internet [ISO not used in this case]\nIf you want to upgrade Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 14.04 without waiting July 2014, you can also use this command line in Terminal:\nupdate-manager -d\n\nHowever, the ISO won't be used in this case. Everything will directly be downloaded from Ubuntu repositories.\nNote\nDon't forget to backup your data before performing any upgrade. It's always better to have a backup even if you don't have to use it than having no backup when you really need one ;-)!\n\nA: Even you can upgrade without ISO image, so need to delete 12.04 and reinstall 14.04.\nso need to download all application,application data again in 14.04.\nfollow the following steps:-\nFirst things first: make sure that you are fully up-to-date. Double check by opening the Update Manager application from the dash and installing all updates listed.\nWhen that’s done, open the Dash again and launch the Terminal application. When it opens click inside the window and type the following command carefully:\n update-manager -d\n\nHit the enter key and, if prompted, enter your user password.\nThe Update Manager application will open after a few seconds with a prompt to upgrade. Click to begin the process.\nNOTE:- Your system should to connected to internet.\n       If using laptop Keep in AC mode.\n", "Q: How to run postbooks server in Ubuntu?

I have not seen software that allows you to run your own instance locally (ie. localhost) unless you use the method above (the virtualbox container using vagrant). The method you use (software from USC with Postgress fails because you still need apache to host the system and the software that is their website. That last one is not free and not available).\n\nA: There are three moving parts to keep track of with our application (I work for xTuple).\nFirst is the xTuple Server. Rinzwind did a great job of explaining how to set up an xTuple Server using vagrant. For production use, we don't recommend Vagrant. The full documentation on the xTuple Server is here:\nhttps://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki\nThe second moving part is the web client. You get this automatically with the server. Just point your browser where Rinzwind noted, and you can use the app.\nThe third moving part is our desktop application, which is older and more fully-featured. That's what you're finding on the USC. The desktop client complements the web client, and can connect to the same interoperable database using the same login credentials. The problem with our desktop application on USC is that it's out of date; it's on 4.1, whereas our latest release is 4.6 and the xTuple server probably won't build anything before 4.4.\nThe easiest way to grab the latest desktop client is to grab it off of sourceforge.\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/postbooks/files/02%20PostBooks-GUIclient-only/\nIt's not quite right to say that any of our clients only work in the cloud or on a locally-hosted environment. The xTuple Server works in the cloud, or locally, and both the desktop client and the web client can connect to either one.\n", "Q: unable to load nvidia(bumblebee) in ubuntu 14.04 (only nouveau loads) Bumblebee stopped working on my system after upgrading to stable version of Ubuntu 14.04.\nDUring installation I get this error rmmod: ERROR: Module nouveau is in use\nSetting up bumblebee (3.2.1-90~trustyppa1) ...\nSelecting 01:00:0 as discrete nvidia card.

Frequent mouse locks. Interestingly, bumblebee works perfectly fine on my fedora 20 partition on this same laptop.\n\nA: Ubuntu has support for Nvidia Optimus out of the box via a solution that works a lot faster than Bumblebee. It is done using the \"nvidia-prime\" package which is a native solution to switch between Nvidia or Intel graphics.\nTo use it however, you need the Nvidia Proprietary drivers. (just look for them in the additional drivers tab in Ubuntu). Once installed, look for \"Nvidia PRIME\" in the Nvidia Settings manager.\n\nA: Over time, as Nvidia cards become better supported by the Nouveau drive they often become unsupported by the proprietary driver.  This happened for me recently, when bumblebee and all of my 3d setup disappeared from the proprietary driver and I was forced to switch to Nouveau, which supports Optimus natively - there are some details on Optimus and Nouveau featureset at nouveau.freedesktop.org.\nThe GeForce 310M seems to be of a vintage which this would also apply to, but I can't categorically say that for certain.\nI found this was the case by removing the nouveau module, modprobing the nvidia module in its place and then checking the output of 'dmesg'.  Obviously I did all this without X running!\n", "Q: how to record sound via headphone in audacity i have tried recording sound via headphone but i cant get it done not only that but while using skype my voice is not audible to the person whom i am talking but i can hear his voice  i think it is the issue of some simple settings so can any one help me to get it done \ni have connected my headphone into my pc but i cant see it in the list of recordable devices have a look at it\n\nis this an issue of incompatible headphones ?\n\nA: It's look like that's you have no working device to record sound... just have a look on mine sound setting:\nPS no microphone not headphone are plugged in, that's only show my audio pheripheral ability.\n\n\nA: Assuming that you mean headset (if you mean headphones you will require a microphone), first I would check that the headset is working on a different device. In my experience a lot of cheap headsets break very easily. If it doesn't work on another device then it is definitely going to be a hardware problem with the headset.\nNext you need to check that the headset is compatible. The connector should fit snugly into the jack. If you have a single jack headset (like for a smartphone) and you are trying to plug it into a computer which is expecting separate audio output and microphone inputs then that is not going to work. If you only really care about making the audio recording it might work if you plug it into the microphone jack but I can't guarantee that. Also if you want to listen back to the recording you'll either need to keep switching between the audio output and microphone jack or get a separate audio output device.  \nSo let's say that everything checks out you have a microphone plugged into the microphone jack (and perhaps audio output plugged into the audio output jack) and they fit properly.\nThen I think they next question would be to check that you are up to date:\nTry following these instructions:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/UpgradingAlsa/DKMS\nIf it still isn't working try a restart.\nIf it still isn't working try this in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install alsa-tools-gui\nhdajackretask\n\nAnd try a restart. After that I am out of ideas (without further input).\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: dpkg: error processing extlinux (--configure) So I was running apt-get autoremove and the output was:\n dpkg: error processing extlinux (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n extlinux\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nis it Right?\n\nA: sudo dpkg --configure -a \n\n\n\n*\n\n*try this this will definately solve your issue\n\n\nA: sames error on Kali *other distro based on Debian too*\nthe error was related to an incomplete installation\nand solution was to check your sources.list in \"/etc/apt/sources.list\"\nleave only trusted sources : place a # before the other line sources .\nthen execute : apt-get autoremove\nand then after that execute : apt-get update && apt-get upgrade\n**\nOther option\n** \nis to reinstall the problematic package  as following them remove it \nbut be aware this package is related to syslinux  that is a boot loader and i'm not sure if it's the one that loads your machine or it's grub \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall extlinux\n\nsudo apt-get purge extlinux (if you are sure you don't need it)\n", "Q: Partitions not showing while installing (K)ubuntu 14.04 Im trying to install Kubuntu 14.04 along-side Windows 7 x64 but there are problems in Disk Setup section, installer does not show my drives properly as they are, i left drive empty to install Kubuntu but this drive does not shown at all and all drives are listed some way un-regular. \nthis is how my drives really are:\n\ni want to install Kubuntu in my drive D but this is how Disk Setup is showing my drives:\n\nand when i click on manual:\n\ni even shrink-ed my drive D to assigning for root, home and swap but there are bot shown to be chosen.\nwhere is the problem? how can i tell installer to assign the drives that i want?\n\nA: Your drive is partitioned as a \"Dynamic Disk\".

I'd like to be able to read it offline on my PC. Also I hate being dependent on any external 'service' to read a book. So How can I download the ebook, if it is possible at all?\n\nA: You can use Calibre with Apprentice Alf's DeDRM tools (a separate plug-in) to read the book, after signing into Amazon >  Your Account > Manage Your Content and Devices. Then download to your computer and import into Calibre. \nThis answer is not to encourage stealing, only allowing you to read the content you 'purchased' \nCalibre is available for Linux.\n\nA: 1. Transfer via Calibre\nCalibre is a opensource ebook library management which has many abilities such as managing ebook collections, converting ebook, sync to ebook reader devices such as Amazon Kindle, download news from the Internet and convert it to ebook friendly format, and more.\nTo use Calibre to transfer ebook to your Kindle device, please install it from Ubuntu repository, sudo apt-get install calibre -y should do that for you. Once installed, run Calibre and plug the Kindle devices. Calibre will automatically detect the Kindle and you are ready to go!\n\nOnce connected, you can add and remove ebook from Kindle, and also convert unsupported format into Kindle supported format.\n2. Direct transfer via File Manager\nIf you don't need a complex method of transferring files (like Calibre does), you can transfer ebook via File manager. Please make sure there is no ebook manager software opened, plug in the Kindle, and File Manager should mount it automatically (like Thunar - XFCE File Manager - does).\n\nAll you need to do is put the ebook in \"documents\" folder.

What should I do?\nI am using Ubuntu 13.10. Please recommend me a software application similar to Nokia PC Suite for connecting my PC through Nokia Mobile. \n\nA: gambas2-runtime is in the Ubuntu Software Center for Ubuntu 12.04. For later versions of Ubuntu Gambas2 has been updated to (superseded by) Gambas3. If this doesn't work, you could try installing Nokia Suite on a Windows PC if you have one. Nokia Support Discussions for Nokia Suite is mainly for Windows users.\nYou can connect your Nokia phone in Ubuntu using wvdial from the Ubuntu Software Center. For information about how to connect your Nokia phone using  wvdial see this step-by-step tutorial: Connect your Nokia phone with Linux without PC Suite.\nAll of the steps in the tutorial have to be run from the terminal. To open the terminal use the keyboard combination Ctrl+Alt+T. The terminal commands in the tutorial are highlighted in red letters. For example to run the first command in the tutorial, connect your Nokia phone to your computer via data cable, open the terminal and type:  \nlsusb  \n\nThis command will list all USB devices that are connected to your computer. You can identify your Nokia phone by looking for a line in the output of lsusb that has something like the string Nokia Mobile in it.\nThe third command in the tutorial is:\nwvdialconf create  \n\nIf you have already installed wvdial then you can run the preceding command without installing anything else, but this command will not run properly in Ubuntu 13.10, so substitute the following command for it instead:\nsudo wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf\n\nThis will create a file named wvdial.conf in your /etc directory.\nThe last command in the tutorial is:\nsudo gedit /etc/wvdial.conf  \n\nThis command will not run properly in Ubuntu 13.10, so you have to run the following two commands instead, which will allow you to use Gedit for editing the wvdial.conf file in Ubuntu 13.10:\nsudo apt-get install gksu\ngksudo gedit /etc/wvdial.conf   \n\nIt is basically the same command as in the tutorial, only you have to substitute gksudo for sudo to open Gedit from the terminal, because Gedit is a graphical application.\nIn Ubuntu 18.04 and later gksu has been discontinued so use this command instead: \nsudo -H gedit /etc/apt/sources.list &>/dev/null \n\n\nA: I am listing out some apps to manage Mobile Phones in Ubuntu below. Hope these help you in connecting your phone to your PC.\nGammu/Wammu - Wammu is a program to manage data in your cell phone such as contacts, calendar or messages.\n\n\n*\n\n*List of supported phones: http://wammu.eu/phones/\n\n*Homepage: http://wammu.eu/wammu/\n\n*Ubuntu App: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/wammu/\ngMobileMedia - gMobileMedia is a simple gtk application used to browse and handle a mobile phone filesystem, it can handle phones with more than one memory area.\n\n\n*\n\n*Homepage: http://gmobilebrowser.sourceforge.net/\n\n*Ubuntu App: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gmobilemedia/\nSeries60-Remote - Series60-Remote is an application to manage your mobile phone.

Like without executing:\ncd dir_name\n\nOr\ncd identifier\n\nWhy the below command opens the secondary prompt instead of changing the directory \ncd ls | grep identifier\n\n\nA: Sadly with bash you can't. The nearest thing that you can do is, if the identifier is at the start of the filename, press Tab so Bash autocomplete. Sadly, this won't work if the identifier is at the middle or end of the filename in which case I would recommend using zsh instead which allows this.\nThe cd ls | grep identifier didn't worked for two reasons, first, you were trying to change to a directory called ls and then pipe the stdout (which is empty) to grep looking for \"identifier\". This would be fixed if you used a subshell instead as clement suggested cd $(ls | grep identifier). But this has other problem, ls output is in columns and grep works by lines. So if I for example try to grep \"sites\" in the folowing output:\n➜ ls\nautoreviewcomments.user.js  build.sh     build.xml  README.md  src\nbuild.properties            build.sites  dist       SDK\n➜ ls | grep sites\nbuild.properties            build.sites  dist       SDK\n\nor in some cases the color will be in the way of cd, so you must specify \"no coloring\":\ncd $(ls | grep --no-color sites)\n\n", "Q: how can a windows application installed via wine be enabled to access partitions other than /home? I am fairly new to Ubuntu, having only recently switched from Windows. As I  had a very large number of files stored in several partitions, which I naturally wanted to retain, I deleted only the partition C where Windows OS was, and manually installed Ubuntu 14.04 (with its 'swap', '/root' and '/home') in that space. \nNow I do quite a bit of video conversion, my desired output formats being Xvid, MP3 and -- for container -- AVI. Since Handbrake video converter  allows only MKV container, I installed via Wine my preferred Windows application, Mediacoder. I find that this application does convert video files as before (which means the installation has been correctly done) but only those from the ubntu '/home' partition. It cannot even detect the other pre-existing partitions, let alone accessing files from them. \nSo my question is: \nHow can a Windows-compatible application, installed via Wine, be enabled to detect and access partitions that were created earlier by Windows?   \n\nA: To find files stored outside of /home, reach /home/<user>/.wine/dosdevices/z: (where  is your username). This is a symlink to your root folder (/). From there, you can look for your files anywhere on the system, for example in /media if there are partitions mounted in that folder. \nMake sure you possess the rights to read the files you need. If necessary, you can change them in a file manager (under a file's properties window) or, in a terminal, by using either chmod u+x followed by the files or chmod u+x -R followed by folders.\n", "Q: How to run Genymotion via terminal So I installed Genymotion and I used this website as a guide: https://cloud.genymotion.com/page/doc/.

I'm hoping a solution exists where I don't have to decrypt both usb1 and 2 to sync them.  I'm hoping the sync program can figure out the differences at binary level?\n\nA: Alternative: ecryptfs\nYou should rather use a file-based encryption like ecryptfs instead of a block-based encryption solution in these cases.\nAdvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Given that you use the same passphrase for both devices, you can rsync your data even when ecryptfs is not mounted and save additional decryption and encryption overhead.\n\n*You write only little more data than the payload, not a whole partition or container, which reduces wear on the memory cells.\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Filename encryption limits the filename length, if your filesystems allow for 255 bytes—like most modern filesystems including FAT and EXT—the limit would be 143 bytes. Be aware of multi-byte characters in filenames.\n\n\nI heard that some people also use ecryptfs for online services like Dropbox or Google Drive.\nUsage\nThe Ubuntu installer uses ecryptfs to setup encryption of users home folders, so you may have already installed the ecryptfs-utils package. Using ecryptfs for external media is very simple, just execute the following command for the corresponding mountpoint:\nsudo mount -t ecryptfs my_mountpoint/ my_mountpoint/\n\nThis will then prompt the following options and finally mount an additional layer to the same mountpoint or directory that encrypts and decrypts your data:\nPassphrase: \nSelect cipher: \n 1) aes: blocksize = 16; min keysize = 16; max keysize = 32\n 2) blowfish: blocksize = 8; min keysize = 16; max keysize = 56\n 3) des3_ede: blocksize = 8; min keysize = 24; max keysize = 24\n 4) twofish: blocksize = 16; min keysize = 16; max keysize = 32\n 5) cast6: blocksize = 16; min keysize = 16; max keysize = 32\n 6) cast5: blocksize = 8; min keysize = 5; max keysize = 16\nSelection [aes]: \nSelect key bytes: \n 1) 16\n 2) 32\n 3) 24\nSelection [16]: \nEnable plaintext passthrough (y/n) [n]: \nEnable filename encryption (y/n) [n]: y\nFilename Encryption Key (FNEK) Signature [0000000000000000]: \nAttempting to mount with the following options:\n  ecryptfs_unlink_sigs\n  ecryptfs_fnek_sig=0000000000000000\n  ecryptfs_key_bytes=16\n  ecryptfs_cipher=aes\n  ecryptfs_sig=0000000000000000\nMounted eCryptfs\n\nIf you use a password manager, you should save the summarized ecryptfs_* options along with the passphrase. Be sure to enable filename encryption (FNEK stands for filename encryption key).\nTips for using ecryptfs\n\n\n*\n\n*Finding long filenames\nThe following command should give you a list of files with filenames longer than 135 bytes (135 question marks if I'm not mistaken) and also works for multibyte characters.\nLC_ALL=C find . -type f -name '???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????*'\n\nIt's 135 because when you use rsync to transfer files it creates temporary files with a leading dot and 7 trailing characters (.<my_original_filename>.abcdef). If it can't create the temporary file it will complain and continue with the next file.\n\n*Working around long filenames\nUse metadata where possible to include all the information you need or zip files with too long filenames.\n\n\n*\n\n*I use the following pattern in puddletag to rename files:\n$left($num(%track%, 2) - %title%, 130)\n\nIt's 130 because of the filename extensions. It does not currently work for multibyte characters, but I filed a bug on their bugtracker.\nlike .flac.\n\nA: Block devices can be synchronized using bdsync — a fast block device synchronizing tool.\nbdsync was built to do the only thing rsync isn’t able to do: synchronize block devices.  \nbdsync \"bdsync -s\" /dev/LOCDEV /dev/REMDEV > DEV.bdsync  \n\nThis generates a diff DEV.rsync of the /dev/LOCDEV and the /dev/REMDEV devices which both are local.  \nbdsync --patch  DEV.bdsync /dev/DSTDEV  \n\nwill make the devices synchronized.\n\nA: Rebuild the drives using lvm and then synch them with lvmsync. https://github.com/mpalmer/lvmsync\n", "Q: Lost ubuntu partition after Win7 removal I used to have a 1TB HDD with Win7 and Ubuntu 12.04 on dual boot.\nFew weeks ago I bought an SSD and installed on Dual Boot a Win7 and Ubuntu 12.04.\nFrom the new Ubuntu system I was able to access the data in old Linux ext4 partition.\nYesterday I decided to delete the old Win7 partition so I formatted the old Win7 partition and the 100MB partition reserved file system.\nNow I cant access anymore the old Ubuntu Partition from the new Ubuntu.\nSo I tried to boot from Live CD and restore the grub in the HDD.\nThe command fdisk -l give me [I disconnected the SSD before booting from Live CD] the following output:\nDisk /dev/sda: 1000.2 GB, 1000204886016 bytes\n224 heads, 19 sectors/track, 459004 cylinders, total 1953525168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0xea3fb49a\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1            2048   307197951   153597952    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2   *   307200000   819199999   256000000    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3       819202046  1953523711   567160833    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5      1938425856  1953523711     7548928   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nThe Ubuntu partition is sda3 that become tagged as Extended after old Win7 removal  while before was tagged as Linux.\nAfter that I lauched the command\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda3\n\nand it gives me /usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot find a device for /boot/grub (is /dev mounted?).\nso I tried with sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt\nand it gives me that\nNTFS signature is missing.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda3': Invalid argument\nThe device '/dev/sda3' doesn't seem to have a valid NTFS.\nMaybe the wrong device is used?

I think it may be a bit overkill for your case, but here it goes.\nIf the problem is that you cannot access a partition properly, you can try rewriting the partition table with TestDisk. You can use it in Ubuntu and in Windows. This program is useful to discover disappeared partitions and to rewrite their status. In this case it should be quite simple: run testdisk, analyze sda (first option) and change the status of your Ubuntu partition to \"logical\". Then it should be accessible from your bootable Ubuntu. Since your partitions are not hidden, it should not take you more than a couple of minutes.\n", "Q: Dual monitor with different Applications.

You can avoid this if you have two different graphics cards, and configure PCI pass-through and then run two guest VMs, each connected directly to one graphics card, and hence one monitor. The downside of this approach is that to share files between the two operating systems you would have to export a shared directory between them.

I then attempted to create a similar start up script for my Minecraft server. However I could not do it successfully. I looked up the formatting codes and instructions on the official help page, but when I boot up the Minecraft server it does not auto start like the team speak server. Note: I know screen is an option however I prefer not to use it. The startupscript for team speak was placed in the init.d folder and now runs as long as the server is up despite if I am connected to it or not.\n\nA: I've had the same issue when I was setting up a minecraft server on Debian. The following advice should apply to Ubuntu as well.\nThere are several scripts available. The minecraft wiki has a list at the bottom linking to some popular scripts. However, I'd personally recommend Athenus' minecraft init script, which also contains some nice features like world backup and log rotation. It uses screen like many other scripts, but to be honest I think that's a good thing, because that way you can always attach to the console of your server if you ever need it.\nAlternatively, you can write your own init script, by using something like this as a template.

Then I can just choose another TTY or the GUI to carry on whatever I am doing. I read here that I can even more TTYs (although the answer does not tell me how)\nWhat are the pro's and con's of this approach over the 'commonly-accepted' (in SE it seems at least)\n\nA: nohup literally means no hang up ie. make the process ignore closure of the terminal. If you do not use nohup, then your process will be killed when you close the terminal (logout).\n& means run in background. Your key presses go to the foreground process. So if you use & the process you start will not get your key presses.\nThe downside of what you propose (to run each process on a spare terminal) is that you will run out of spare terminals. You might want to look into using screen, which enables you to create terminals dynamically (ctrl-a c). Then you can start every process in a different terminal.

The servers are all quad core xeon, 12gb ram and 2x1TB disks.\nI am currently looking at virtualising a very small network, however we do not have the money or facilities to sustain the advertised minimum of 6 servers to run openstack. Also, money is a limit as this is for a not for profit organisation.\nI would rather run openstack than VMWare as it means it will operate as a cluster, unlike ESXi which will not.\nSource: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/cloud/install-ubuntu-cloud - Step 4\n\nA: Short answer is Yes, but do not expect anything spectacular or consider it as an industrial deployment. Deployments like these are more suited for test environments unless you'r up for some serious \"infrastructure hacking\". Also MaaS & JuJu combined are deployment methodologies. They put software on machines. What you do with it is up to you, so you still have to go through the Openstack Operations guide and documentation to get a feel of what's going on.\nDeploying services from the cmd-line in juju does allow to co-locate services in machines although you should be careful with how you mix them up.\njuju deploy-service -e myMaaS mysql--to 1 \n\nIn detail, you have to consider the deployment of the following collection of services throughout your stack, for it to work,even though just barely. \n\n\n*\n\n*MaaS Server (1st Server) (Typical installation)\n\n*The JuJu bootstrap node (2nd Server) or machine 0 in  JuJu style.\n\n*Openstack Stack (3rd Server) or machine 1 in JuJu style.\n\n*\n\n*RabbitMQ\n\n*MySQL\n\n*Keystone\n\n*Glance\n\n*Cinder\n\n*Keystone\n\n*Openstack Dashboard\n\n*Nova-Cloud-Controller\n\n*Nova-Compute\n\n\n\nNote:I have deployed a test-stack like that so it does work,but it's a test environment.\nHowever, this is pretty much a huge waste of resources, even if the services are scalable.\nThe alternatives to these would be.\na)Deploy the openstack manually without MaaS & JuJu or with some other DevOp tool e.g saltstack.\nb)Slice the servers. Use some-type of virtualization to create VMs that are in the same network as MaaS (with bridged adapters and PXE booting capabilities). By doing that you will be able to add the machines in the MaaS Cluster even if they are in the same physical machine as MaaS. Even VMs count as standalone nodes and you can use them with JuJu.\nSince you are asking in Ubuntu,I'll assume you are trying to squeeze it with MaaS & JuJu although MaaS is more suited for the management of a large number of physical machines.\nSo let's go with \nb)Slice the servers.\n  The considerations you'd have to keep in mind are the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*MaaS doesn't need a whole server of that caliber on it's own. You are better off slicing the first server to handle non-openstack services. \n\n*The JuJu Node. Since it won't be doing much state management it doesn't need a standalone physical node on it's own. It is better suited to live on the first server.\n\n*Add any other management service you might require on the first server's VMs through JuJu or without it.\n\n*The Openstack Services. You can get away with support services living on the same server in small deployments. You could cram all but the nova-compute on the 2nd physical server.\n\n*Nova-Compute is the service that will expose virtualization HW resources to your cloud and is better suited for using an entire physical server. Save the 3rd server as a whole for the nova-compute. In addition, adding more Compute Resources equals adding the new physical server and clustering it under Nova-Compute from JuJu\n\n*Cinder handles the Storage for openstack so it needs to use an LVM or SDX volume where it's installed to expose it to the cloud. Make sure you have partitioned/saved a dedicated volume array for the Cinder. Also from checking your HDs...you really need more.\n\n\nThe are more considerations to take into deploying the Openstack stack,such as actually proxying the dashboard to an apache-server,a backup location,not drowning the keystone server (the last one sees quite a lot of traffic).\nIn short.\n\n\n*\n\n*First Server (Sliced) \n\n*\n\n*MaaS  - Outside of JuJu\n\n*JuJu Bootstrap Node - Machine 0\n\n*Generic VM for some non-stack service. Machine N \n\n\n*Second Server (Doesn't need to be sliced) Machine N+1\n\n*\n\n*RabbitMQ\n\n*MySQL\n\n*Glance\n\n*Cinder\n\n*Nova-Cloud-Controller\n\n*Keystone\n\n*Openstack-Dashboard\n\n\n*Third Server - Machine N+2\n\n*\n\n*Nova-Compute\n\n\n\nHope that helps to get you started.   \n", "Q: After I installed 14.04 desktop, launcher on left side is missing after Virtualbox 4.3.12 upgrade Exactly same issue as the MAIN POST \nBut the solutions given in that post didn't solve the issue.\nI was working with VirtualBox 4.3.10 in Windows 8 with Ubuntu 14.04 as Guest.

But on the official amd website the latest version is from 5/27/2014. Why is that version not on the ubuntu repos since it  supports Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: I think you may be misreading the text on the AMD website - the latest official driver there is dated 5/22/14.  \nThe support for UbuntU 14.04 appears in the Beta driver (released 5/26/14).  I did try this driver, and it failed for me, but that is beside the point:  it is a beta driver and should probably not be included in the repos until the remaining bugs are worked out.\n\nA: In System Settings>Software and Updates: there is a setting has something to do with that since the 5/27/2014 drivers are a beta and not a stable release.  However I would not recommend using an unstable release with a Graphics card.  So by your settings, the drivers are up to date.\n", "Q: Why are lines with man and news underlined in the terminal?

You will then be able to ping one computer from the other.\nA crossover cable is not needed. Ethernet devices made in the last 10 or so years support auto MDI-X which eliminates the need for a crossover cable.\n\nA: A cross-over cable is generally required to physically connect two computers without a router, hub or switch between them. This is a mechanical requirement as the wiring pin-out of a cross-over cable \"crosses\" the Tx (Transmit) and Rx (Receive) lines of the cable allowing the Tx line to connect directly with the Rx pin of the apposing network device, this function is often handled by a router, hub or switch. Your best bet to get one is to go to computer speciality shop (I.E. Not your local big box electronics store.), they will know for sure what you need and have reasonable prices. Once you have the cable, you need to set both systems to unique static IP Addresses.\nThis will allow any computer to talk directly to another regardless of age so long as they are configured correctly. Although some modern devices may support such communication over a standard \"Patch\" cable, I have rarely seen this work in practice and a cross-over cable is generally not much more expensive then the equivalent patch cable as only the pin-out is different.\n", "Q: Ubuntu disappeared after upgrade!

The EFI folder here has 2 subfolders - Boot and Microsoft and it is the boot folder which contains BOOTX64.EFI.\nSo, my question is after i have reinstalled ubuntu on a separate partition , will the method given here : Windows 8 removes Grub as default boot manager ,  still work and allow me to choose between ubuntu and windows at start-up using grub ? Because i remember the last time i tried using it , it didn't work out .. \nAlso , out of curiosity , if i somehow remove the HP folder from ESP partition , then will this not be the same as having a DOS OS installed laptop , which now has no remains of HP ? \nAnd one thing more if someone can please explain me why is it the case that windows boots by default and ubuntu's grub cannot be started ?\n\nA: If you've tried using bcdedit in Windows, as described in the Windows 8 removes Grub as default boot manager question you cited, and if that doesn't work, then it won't work any better with Ubuntu 14.04 than with 13.04. Basically, what you're looking at now is a buggy firmware. You might check with HP to see if they've fixed that bug in a firmware update. (They probably call it a \"BIOS,\" but really it isn't a BIOS; it's an EFI.)\nIf HP has no updated firmware, then given that your computer is too old to be returned to the store for a refund, your only choice is to find a workaround. One that's likely to work is to rename EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi to something else and rename your chosen boot manager to use that name. You can use the Advanced options tag in Boot Repair to do this automatically, or you can do it manually. Alternatively, if you switch to rEFInd as boot manager, you can use its mvrefind.sh script to do the job, as described here. Note that such a renaming operation is a very hackish workaround to a bug that should never have seen the light of day. The \"fix\" can in fact cause further problems down the line, or it might be undone by Windows if it notices that its boot loader has been overwritten. I strongly recommend you back up your ESP if you do this, so that you can restore it to a known-working state if something bad happens down the line. A file-level backup (using tar, cp, or whatnot) should be adequate.\n", "Q: AMD graphics drivers I have a new laptop with dedicated graphics card and I decided I will go with Ubuntu 14.04. All is just fine and I love it but the repos for graphics drivers from Canonical are just well... old  .Is there any problem if I install my graphics drivers from AMD's official website and not from Software Updater?\n It's just that from there i get the latest and greatest.I read the realease notes and 14.04 is supported.\n\nA: My experience:  Go ahead and install the drivers, but before you do print out some de-install instructions!\n\nA: There should be no problem if you use the drivers from the official website. In fact, the driver setup will offer you the option to create a distribution-specific driver package, a .deb file which you can install with sudo dpkg -i <filename>.deb. This way, it is cleaner to install and remove the driver.\nGo ahead and do it, and make sure you know what you're doing. There is some helpful information on this website:\nWhat is the correct way to install proprietary ATI Catalyst Video Drivers (fglrx) directly from AMD?\nHow do I remove the proprietary ATI drivers?\n\nA: Just be aware that when you update the Linux Kernel, you may (will?) need to update the driver, as it depends on the kernel.  This is the attraction of using the repository for everything, as it will get updated automatically.  So, try the repository first and see if any of their versions are good enough.

I heard that windows 8 has the product key in the BIOS but I don't know how to access it to download the windows 8 iso file.

Also, I'm planning to use it with raid0 on top of EBS-Optimized volumes in a Cloud Computing environment...\nTks!\nThiago\n\nA: If you are writing about the deduplication with the bedup utility, then the answer is: deduplication and compression are completely independent processes. \nDuring the deduplication, no file contents are rewritten (only metadata), so there is no opportunity to compress the data. \nAnd I am 99% sure, that compression status is transparent to the bedup since it is next to impossible to get the original, compressed contents of the file out of the btrfs.\nOn the other hand, recompression of old data happens when you defragment the drive (e.g. with btrfs filesystem defragment -r -v -clzo /). This will currently break the de-duplication of files.\n\nA: There is no online deduplication currently. It's planned, but not yet implemented. There is an experimental patchset ( www.mail-archive.com/linux-btrfs%40vger.kernel.org/msg32862.html ) if you want to try it.\nJust from personal experience there is no noticeable performance hit of online compression on a hasswell i5 4460 when writing to a ssd and 3 hdds at once (one of the hdds is formated with xfs so no compression was being performed. Defragging/recompressing  the 3 btrfs drives gives a cpu load around 50% but the system still feels smooth. This is with lzo and compression not forced (unless you force it btrfs stops trying to compress a file if it's incompressible + lzo is faster than zlib). The limit is still drive speed, even with a ssd.\n", "Q: Network computer's?

Worth a shot.\nExcerpt from source: \n\nBug Description\n\n[Justification]\nWith the kernel in 13.10, some systems use a different USB host driver than previously. Failing to include this driver in the initramfs causes regressions for users who need to interact with the system in early boot using a USB keyboard, such as users with an encrypted root filesystem. Such systems are not bootable with this host driver missing.\n\n[Test case]\n1. On an affected system, reboot to a kernel from 13.04.\n2. Install the initramfs-tools package from -proposed.\n3. Reboot to the kernel from 13.10.\n4. Verify that you are able to type your passphrase at the prompt in the initramfs.\n\n[Regression potential]\nMinimal. The update-initramfs script will ignore missing modules (such as the many other modules in the list which are built-ins), and the only change made is to copy the module into the initramfs: it will only be loaded in the initramfs if udev determines it's needed, just as it would load it after switching to the root filesystem.\n\nA: The Intel support site came back online and one of the \"troubleshooting tips\" was to restore BIOS defaults. Naturally I thought \"well that won't help!\"...but it did. Even though the option to \"Boot USB devices first\" is unchecked, it does boot from my flash drive, and can boot normally to the installed Ubuntu as well.

(I use SSH to connect to it.)\nVM specs:\n⠀OS: Ubuntu Server 14.04\n⠀CPU: Dual Core 2.13GHz (2 processors)\n⠀RAM: 4GB\n⠀Disk: 40GB  \n\nA: It could be a variety of things. You should edit your question to include more detail specs of the host machine, state what virtualization product you are using, and if the product uses guest drivers state whether you've installed them. The information below may or may not apply to you depending on what product you are using to host the virtual machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Depending on how much ram your host has, and what kinds of ram usage the host and guest operating system are under it's possible your VM is getting swapped memory from the host. The virtual machine gives 4gb of memory from the host. However if not enough ram is available on the host that memory could be coming from your swap partition instead which would dramatically decrease performance in the virtual machine. If you have enough ram try disabling your host's swap partition and seeing if the vm's performance increases. \n\n*Another thing to consider where the vm is stored. For optimal performance it should be placed on it's own storage device, that has a fast connection interface, and good read/write speeds.\n\n*If the virtual machine product you are using has guest drivers installing them will aid performance.\n\n*If you have more than 2 cpus available on the host then assigning more may help depending on what virtualization product you are using. For example when I record high quality audio in virtual machines I dedicate all 4 of my cpus to prevent skipping.\n", "Q: AR9485 wireless card loses ability to connect after hibernation This has happened twice now, the first time it happened I just reinstalled Ubuntu.

Well like the title say, i have an old computer, with an Intel Pentium 4 and 3 gb on ram ddr3, but the cuestion still there, can i install ubuntu 14.04? If is true... how much fast or how much lag i'll find?\n\nA: You have more than enough ram (though ddr3 paired with a Pentium 4 sounds odd), and I would assume your cpu is faster than 700mhz which is the minimum requirement. The only thing you might have to worry about is PAE support. If your computer has PAE you're good to go, if not you'll need to install an Ubuntu derivative like Lubuntu as I believe the derivatives still ship with non-pae kernels by default, but don't quote me on that.\nIn regards to your question about lag. Unity is a heavy desktop environment. You may experience some lag depending on your cpu specs and graphics card. In that case consider installing Lubuntu which is lighter.\n\nA: The minimum suggested specs are listed here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements\nBased off those specs, you should be fine.\nAnd here is a link to a page with suggested practices for speed improvement on Ubuntu systems, in particular older hardware:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/115797/6-ways-to-speed-up-ubuntu/\n\nA: You can always install a more resource friendly version of Ubuntu such as Lubuntu (the same works for Xubuntu and Kubuntu, although Kubuntu is not as lightweight as the other two).\nImages can be found here: http://lubuntu.net/ and here http://xubuntu.org/.\nor if you already installed regular Ubuntu, just install lubuntu-desktop via the software center or via the command line:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nFor Xubuntu just do:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Takes Me Back to the Install Screen After Installing Via USB Basically, I downloaded Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit), and attempted to install it via my flash drive.\nI followed the instructions here, but after rebooting when prompted to, I was taken back to the installation screen, asking me to either Install Ubuntu or just try it.

I made a bootable USB for installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS alongside Windows 8.1. I inserted my USB device and then booted into it. Then it showed me 2 options - 'Try Ubuntu' or 'Install Ubuntu'. Now I press 'Try Ubuntu' and then it says, \"The system is running in low graphics mode\". Then I press 'OK'. Then it showed me 4 options. Then again I click 'OK'. Then it shows a black screen and nothing happens. \nI have tried all possible answers provided in AU. What should I do? Please help. \nPS :- I am using Windows 8.1 with dedicated graphic card which is AMD Radeon HD 8670M. I am trying to do this in a Dell Laptop 3537 Inspiron. \nUPDATE :- I tried running the liveUSB session with nomodeset on and i was able to enter the installer. But when I run boot-repair(so that my Ubuntu gets detected in the GRUB menu) after installing Ubuntu successfully alongside Windows 8(following this tutorial with nomodeset on, I get the following error:-\nyour system is running in legacy mode\nboot repair done\n\n\nA: This problem might be occurring because of the graphic driver. So you must first get into your liveUSB session(i.e \"Try Ubuntu without installing\") with nomodeset enabled. \nStep 1 - Enable nomodeset :-\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the liveUSB session.\n\n*Then open GRUB(by pressing Shift key before the violet splash screen).\n\n*Then select a kernel and press e to edit it. Now in it find the line that ends with quiet splash and add the words nomodesetbefore it so that it is nomodeset quiet splash\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now reboot. You must be able to enter into LiveUSB session without the 'low graphics' error.\n\n\nStep 2 - Setting up persistence:-\nNow you must consider using proprietary graphic drivers(i.e graphic driver provided by AMD) instead of the default open source driver. I am telling this because you are trying to install Ubuntu alongside windows 8 here and so when you run boot-repair, after installing Ubuntu so that it gets detected by GRUB, you may face the \"System running in legacy mode\" error(since you have enabled nomodeset) if you don't install the proprietary driver.(I am just guessing here. that is, I am not so sure if the *legacy mode* error is associated withnomodeset. I need some comments on this below.) But since you are in the liveUSB mode if you install the driver and reboot(so that the driver might work) you won't get the driver working, as you haven't set up any persistence. So the next thing you must do is to set up persistence. I will explain how to do this below:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, partition your USB device into two partitions from your Windows OS. Keep at least a 1 GB or so partition for the Ubuntu installation files(make this a FAT32 partition). Make another ext4(or ext2 or ext3) partition of the remaining space and remember to name it casper-rw(It is highly essential to name it so.). Use a GParted Live CD for this purpose(or any other partitioning software you like. I am recommending this because it worked for me). I am providing a few screen shots below(but these are not of the Gparted Live CD, I used):-\n\n\n\n(Creating the FAT32 partition mentioned below)\n\n(Creating the casper-rw(ext4) partition)\n\n(How it looks after partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now put the installation files into the FAT32 partition. For this you must use  UNetbootin. See the screen shot below of UNetbootin :-\n\n\n \nCarefully note what all I have selected and select exactly the same in your UNetbootin too(except for selecting Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit image! You have to select your 12.04 image). Also compare this image with the image before it. I have selected /dev/sdb1 since that is my FAT32 partition. You should select the FAT32 partition, accordingly in your PC.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now, after the UNetbootin process is over, get into the FAT32 partition and delete the file(not the folder) named casper-rw so that Ubuntu will use the casper-rw partition instead of that file to store your data. It will be around 10MB (as we selected in UNetbootin).\n\n*Now get into liveUSB mode. Make some file in the desktop and then reboot. You must see the file that you created before(If not then persistence is not working).\n\n*Now you have successfully created a live USB with persistence! Just boot in with the USB device and select 'Try ubuntu without installing'.\nNow that we have created a liveUSB session with persistence we can install AMD driver.\nStep 3 - Installing AMD driver :-\n\n\n*\n\n*Now get into the liveUSB sessiom. Connect to the internet. Now press Ctrl+Alt+t to open a terminal. There type:-\n\n\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\n*\n\n*After the updating process is over(which is achieved by the immediately above command) type:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-amdcccle\nto install your graphic driver.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now restart with:\n\n\nsudo reboot\n\n\n*\n\n*Now get into the liveUSB session again. Type in the terminal:-\n\n\nfglrx\nThis must clearly show the details of your graphic card(If it doesn't you haven't installed the driver properly).\nInstall Ubuntu(see the last entry in the PS section below) and enjoy now!!\nPS :- \n\n\n*\n\n*Credits for Step 1 go to this answer. Refer it for some extra info on step 1 .\n\n*Credits for step 2 go to this answer. Refer it for more info on step 2.\n\n*You can refer to the answer here for more info on step 3. Also if you want a \"GUI\" way to install your driver you can look at the answer mentioned for 14.04 in the same link.(IMO it must work for 12.04 too).\n\n*To install Ubuntu alongside windows 8, you should follow the answer here. It must work. (Note that installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 8 is quite a difficult task as Windows 8 made it so. Therefore follow all the steps in that answer carefully)      \n\n\nA: Since you have a problem with the GUI installer you must try the Text based installer provided by the Ubuntu minimal CD. But, most probably, after the install you will have the \"low graphics issue\" in your Ubuntu. To solve it just refer to the answers in this question. Now I will show you how to install Ubuntu with the Text based installer. Remember that a decent working internet connection is compulsory for this. \nInstalling Ubuntu with the Text based installer(MinimalCD) :\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the minimal CD for your Ubuntu version(12.04 LTS) from here.\n\n*Then burn the mini.iso file you would have got from the download onto a CD.(This is preferable as some of the images don't work properly with a USB device.)\n\n*Now Boot from your CD and you will see these on your screen. Just follow the instruction given above each screen shot.\n\n\n\nSelect 'Install' here. \n\n\n\nSelect the language you prefer.\n\n\n\nSelect your country.\n\n\n\nNow you could choose no and set your keyboard later. If you choose yes, it will ask you a few questions in order to detect your language.\n\n\n\nType in a host name.\n\n\n\nHere it is recommended to choose your own country. If not, then the closest mirror to your country so you could have a faster download speed. You'd be grabbing a few packages from there(Its like Debian net install). \n\n\n\n\nI won't use proxies for now. If you want to use proxy, you could.\n\n\n\nGive a Name, User name & password and it will later ask you to set the time.\n\n\n\nI choose no here to keep it simple\n\n\n\nNow you need to pay attention because it is partitioning time! I highlighted Virtual box entire disk. If you want to choose the entire disk you just hit Enter else if you want to dual boot and:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have another Linux distro, you could use Gparted. I prefer the LiveCD of Gparted, simply because everything is unmounted. So you partition your disk and then you run Ubuntu installer and follow the steps below.\n\n*If you're on Windows OS then you could use the partition manager available in it. Press the Windows button and type 'partition' in the search box of the 'Start' menu that appears. The partition manager will show up. The complete guide you must follow for this purpose is here.\nNow that you have a  free partition, you must highlight it and press Enter. Note that I don't configure LVM on my computer to keep it simple but I would definitely do so on a server. I won't talk much about it in this answer, so just hit Enter for now.\nChoose Finish partitioning and write changes to disk to let it do the partitioning automatically instead of doing it manually(i.e letting the home partition be on a different partition and so on. If you wish to you could do it manually too). \n\n\nHere I chose the highlighted option but you can use whatever you want.\n\n\n\nWhen it's done downloading, you will see the menu shown below. I recommend choosing only the Desktop Environment(DE) you want and install services later. You select an option by pressing Space and then Continue(I chose Lubuntu-minimal for a demo).\n\n\n\nThen it will ask to install GRUB. Press Yes.\n\nThen you will see something like: \"Is this system clock set to UTC?\" Press Yes(This can be changed later).\nNow it's time to Boot the system. Press Continue and remove the installation disk.\nVoila !! \n\n\nWhat could go wrong?\nYou could have problems with GRUB(i.e GRUB won't show up and let you choose your Ubuntu), Windows OS won't show up and so on. All these could be fixed using boot repair disk.\nCreate Windows repair disk as a precaution. You may use it to fix Windows MBR errors. In case you get that kind of error, open a terminal and do the following: \nbootrec /RebuildBcd\nbootrec /fixMbr\nbootrec /fixboot \n\nIf you need additional drivers, go here and grab the cd, put it on a USB device or CD and you'll be able to fix many drivers issue.\nI am pretty sure that they work on Ubuntu too as I have used them on Ubuntu 12.04. If you still prefer to grab them from Ubuntu's repository itself, you could click here for more info.\nThis installation was done in virtualbox, if you have any question when installing on your PC, please comment below and I would be happy to help !\n", "Q: Error is occured when I try to build and install Numeric-24.2, anybody, help please me vprasopchai@vprasopchai-Aspire-4720Z:~/Downloads/Numeric-24.2$ python setup.py build\nWARNING: '' not a valid package name; please use only.-separated package names in setup.py\nWARNING: '' not a valid package name; please use only.-separated package names in setup.py\nrunning build\nrunning build_py\nrunning build_ext\nMA Version 12.2.0\nNumeric Version 24.2\n\n\nvprasopchai@vprasopchai-Aspire-4720Z:~/Downloads/Numeric-24.2$ python setup.py install\nWARNING: '' not a valid package name; please use only.-separated package names in setup.py\nWARNING: '' not a valid package name; please use only.-separated package names in setup.py\nrunning install\nrunning build\nrunning build_py\nrunning build_ext\nrunning install_lib\ncreating /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Numeric\nerror: could not create '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Numeric': Permission denied\n\n\nA: This link should point you in the right direction:\nhttps://docs.python.org/2/install/\nNote: the Permission denied error is a reference to privileges. try instead:\npython setup.py build  \nsudo python setup.py install\n\nOR\nanother alternative, if you choose not to use root permissions:\npython setup.py build  \npython setup.py install --user\n\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 change windows dimension May I change the opening dimensions of applications?\nI have tried installing ccsm but there is no more the item \"widows rules\" and I did not found something similar that could help me.\nThank you\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure why you wouldn't be able to do so in Compiz-config Settings Manager (CCSM) anymore.

It is a link to a resource I suggested in another answer about backing up filesystem volumes, so that they can be reformatted. May be of use to you.\nIf none of the above solutions resolve you issue, this contains, among other things, links to commercial software you could explore as options. I've never used the listed software in those links, but I believe they are worth looking into, at least. If no free software has resolved your issue yet, then sometimes, you get what you pay for.\n\nA: Since Windows and Linux show both the same behaviour a hardware failure could be the cause.\nPlease try a SMART tool to get information about the drive, if it thinks itself that it is broken. You can use gnome-disks to do that (GUI) or smartctl and also other tools are available for that. (Wikipedia article on S.M.A.R.T.)\nIf you still don't get a clue, what is wrong, you should try to transfer the actual disk from the original case to another external case.\n(Probably the cheapest option, if just the USB-logic-board in the external case is damaged. Just take care that you can connect a SATA drive internally and USB 3.0 externally - 2.0 will be incredibly slow for hard drives.)\nEither you buy one - should be cheaper than the disk - or find somebody near you to borrow such a case. Also use the SMART tools with the disk in the new case.\nIf you want to do any data recovery operation, try to create a disk image first, and then recover from that image - if the actual disk is really damaged, the damage could get bigger and bigger, the more physical read/write operations are performed.\n", "Q: ls system command not showing terminal colors I've just been fooling around with some code in C, an example of a really basic program is as follows which just, obviously, lists the directories using the ls system command.\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main (void) {\n    system(\"ls -l -d */\");\n    printf(\"I've just listed the directories :-)\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThis runs fine, but it shows the ls output in monochrome, whereas Bash would output the list using colors for the directories (or files if I included files). How can I make my C code use the bash colors? Thanks\n\nA: ls is aliased by default as: ls --color=auto so when ls is in a terminal that supports colour, it uses colour codes.\nA system() call doesn't happen in a bash session so your aliases aren't evaluated. I'm also not sure what would happen with the automatic detection so I would make it force colourised output by hotwiring the command:\nsystem(\"ls --color=always -l -d */\");\n\nI've tested that and it works. --color=auto worked too and that might be safer.\nThis phenomenon can happen even without it being in a C system() call. I've been through a similar problem with watch with somebody else. Run watch ls -l and you won't see colours. There's also an explanation on why --colour=auto doesn't always work.\n", "Q: Cmake fails while configuring OpenCV I'm trying to buid OpenCV and use it in Qt.

It is a very bad idea and adds no value to answering your question.\nSince you mention that you can connect locally but not externally, that means that this is a networking issue. Your connection is working when it never leaves the network, but when you try to connect from the outside it is blocked. The question is where it's blocked, most likely it's on your server, but I'm not sure.\nYou can try disabling UFW completely (temporarily), if it doesn't help turn it back on. You can try switching to another port on the SSH daemon (such as 443 which is usually used for SSL) in case your ISP is blocking port 22.\nTo be honest though, your question doesn't really make a lot of sense and you need to troubleshoot more on your own; you say that it worked previously before switching to Ubuntu Desktop (on the server?) -- this would indicate that there cannot be a network issue (such as the SSH port being blocked) because it has worked in the past, and it is very likely to be a configuration error on the server. You mention that it works internally, so maybe the SSHD is configured to only accept local connections, or the firewall is misconfigured to only allow local SSH connections?\n\nA: Had the same problem.

I followed the advice in my original post and I would like to say thank you for your help but the problem still exists.\nI am using a Toshiba Satellite L850-1L1 Laptop with the following specs\n· Processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3630QM CPU @ 2.40 GHz\n· 8 GB RAM\n· 64 bit Operating System, x64-based processor\n· 1 TB HDD (No SSD), GPT Partitioning scheme (GUID Partition Table)\n· System BIOS Version 6.7 / EC Version 6.00 (no idea if this bit of info will help or not)\nNote: in the My computer window i can see only 3 Partitions (C, E and G). There are 3 Other partitions - OEM Partition, UEFI Partition, OEM/Recovery Partiton. After Installing Ubuntu u can add a swap area partition and the ubuntu system partition. Is the max number of 4 primary partitions the problem with my system or am I in the clear on this one?\nWith try Ubuntu I was able to boot the live version without problems, then started installing Ubuntu and when I got to the system installation window there was no option that said “install alongside windows 8”. So I picked “something else”, made a 5.77 GB partition (read somewhere that it is supposed to be 10% the size of the main system partition) for swap area and 51.22 GB for booting the main system ( / ). After Installation GRUB menu opened and I could open Ubuntu without problems but with windows, it gave me an error and did not want to boot it. I ran boot repair and it closed with an error and gave me a pop out message saying I should turn off secure boot. After that, there was no GRUB and it boots straight to windows.\nHere is the first boot repair link: paste.ubuntu.com/7517709\nI then formatted the partitions twice more and did the whole thing again with secure boot disabled this time. Again no GRUB menu and boots straight to windows 8 (yes windows 8 on my laptop works with secure boot disabled), so I entered the live version and ran boot repair again. This time it did not tell me that I should disable secure boot, but it did not solve the problem either. Same problem, no GRUB and boots straight to windows.\nHere is the boot repair link: paste.ubuntu.com/7536732\nHere is the boot repair link: paste.ubuntu.com/7565465\nA couple of more points:\n· I cannot change the OS boot manager in BIOS, i.e. I cannot choose boot priority between windows 8 & ubuntu.

No matter what I do grub never comes up and boot repair ends with an error. \nPlease i need advice urgently. It has been a week now\n\nA: \nIs the max number of 4 primary partitions the problem with my system or am I in the clear on this one?\n\nThat's a problem only with the old Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme, which your computer does not use; it uses the new GUID Partition Table (GPT), which does not suffer from that problem.\n\nI picked “something else”, made a 5.77 GB partition (read somewhere that it is supposed to be 10% the size of the main system partition) for swap area and 51.22 GB for booting the main system ( / )\n\nThe \"traditional\" rule for swap space is to make it about twice your RAM size. These days, that's usually overkill. You need at least as much swap as RAM if you expect to use the suspend-to-disk feature. If not, then many uses don't need swap at all, although I'd be reluctant to recommend a no-swap setup by default. Setting swap to a percentage of the root (/) filesystem size is a poor rule of thumb unless that value happens to work out to something sensible. In your case, the value you set might be OK if you don't need to use suspend-to-disk.\n\nno GRUB and boots straight to windows.\n\nTry this:\nWindows 8 removes Grub as default boot manager\nIf that doesn't work, look for a firmware update from your manufacturer. If there's no such update or if any updates you find don't work, and if you're within the return period from the store, return your computer for a refund because it's defective. There are other workarounds you can try, but at this point in time, I don't recommend you try them; manufacturers have had long enough to fix their defective firmware, and I refuse to offer more free support to the manufacturers to nurse people through the problems they've caused.\n", "Q: Why does using double quotes to enclose awk's action statements produce different results than when using single quotes to enclose them?

Also note that I once messed up a little bit trying to format this HDD. Now you might say reformat it. But again Disks utility won't detect it. Any ideas?\n\nA: From discussion with you in chat the problem is clear. I guess, you have unknowingly messed up your previous OS, a bit. But even when you upgraded, the issue did not solve(i.e your HDD did not get detected in Nautilus or Disks utility though lsusb detected it) as the mess you made was carried on as cache into your new OS(thats my guess). Also you seem to tell that you kind of messed up a formatting process of your HDD before. So even if you clear the cache(and make Disks Utility detect your HDD) your HDD won't be detected(by Nautilus). Now this makes the solution clear and it is presented below:- \nStep 1 - Clear Cache :-\nFirstly we must clear cache. For this we can use Ubuntu tweak's \"Janitor\" feature as explained below:- \n\n\n*\n\n*To install Ubuntu tweak run the following commands(one by one) in your terminal(which can be opened with Ctrl+Alt+t):-\n\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\n\n*\n\n*Now open Ubuntu tweak from the dash. You can do the same with the terminal too by typing the command:-\n\n\nubuntu-tweak\n\n\n*\n\n*In Ubuntu tweak, select Start Janitor and then select all the cache to be cleared(including old kernel, package configurations and the like). Now select Clean. This might take a while. \n\n*After this reboot your PC. \n\n\nStep 2 - Formatting your HDD :-\nYou must now be able to see your external Hard Disk Drive in the Disks utility(which can be found in the dash as Disks) but not Nautilus. For your HDD to work normally, in Nautilus, you must reformat it and then mount it. I will explain how to do this below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select your HDD.\n\n*In disks utility you will see three icons as shown below :- \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now press the first button. This will unmount the HDD. (Note that you may not want to do this because already it may be unmounted in your case)\n\n*Then press the gear like icon(the third one) and select Format as shown below :- \n\n\n\n*\n\n*This should format your HDD. Now mount it again by pressing the first icon.\n\n\nThis should detect your HDD normally and you must able to work with it normally too! \nAs with the SD card you must connect and check it now and it should work.(And from your chat discussion it actually did get detected!)\nPS :- Here is the link to the chat room in which the issue was discussed.\n", "Q: Electricity went out while installing software Just installed 14.04 so I gave the software centre about 5 programs to install and I left it and went away.

Ubuntu was installed alongside Windows 7 on my system. After some days, I deleted and formatted the Windows partition and didn't format the other NTFS partitions.\nBefore that, I installed Wine on my Ubuntu. I used it to install some software like Picasa. When I tried to open some images on a NTFS partition using Picasa, I was unable to view or access these partitions. I will show my partition details -\n\nAs you see, I have 4 NTFS partitions in total. When I opened Picasa and searched for the partitions in which the images are saved, I was unable to find some partitions (sda5, sda6 and sda7).\n\nThis is the window that was opened by Picasa when I tried to search image files. How can I access the partitions in which the images are stored from Picasa?\n\nA: C: drive shown to you in Wine, is not a real partition but actually a regular folder exists in your Linux home directory.  \nIf you execute the command below in Terminal, you will see the corresponding folder for Wine's C:\n\nnautilus $HOME/.wine/  \n\n\nIf you need to access real partitions (which are shown in gParted) through Wine:  \n\n\n*\n\n*First click on the partition you desire to access from the file manager. (Clicking on it will mount it.)\n\n*Then go to /media/$USER/... directory from a Wine application. There you will be able access real partitions available in your system.\n\n\nA: Wine, trying to mimic how the drive letter works in Windows, also includes the Z: letter for the root file system on Ubuntu as shown in the Drives option in the winecfg:\n\nJust open winecfg and go to the Drives tab to see which letters are assigned to which folders.\nA quick example of how Z: looks if I try to search on it:\n\nAs you can see, from here I can navigate to media and find the NTFS partition from there. In your case it would be in /media/tomin/.... You can also add new letters that point to a specific folder, like letter D: if you wanted to point directly to the NTFS partition.\nAs Takkat mentioned something VERY important in the comments, Wine can not mount a file system (Mounting is a Ubuntu system action, not so much a Wine option). So you need to first mount the file system, via File/Nautilus for example, and then proceed to use the Wine app you need.\n\nA: These are good answers.  Also note in Gparted /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda5 are not mounted.\nThere is about 1 GB of data between them, and maybe those are the files you are looking for?\nYou can edit those paritions inside Gparted and set a mount point so that they will always be available.  Right click the partition in the text list and select properties (I think that's the menu entry).  You specify the mount point.  But the change will not apply until you hit the green check mark at the top of Gparted.\n", "Q: Versions of Kdenlive in official repositories are deprecated On Kdenlive's official download page for Ubuntu they said this exact statement.\nFirstly what exactly does that mean?

Some of these subdirectories have sub-subdirectories, and some of those sub-subdirectories have sub-sub-subdirectories, and so on.\nWhat I want to do is recursively find all lowest-level subdirectories (subdirectories that do not have any further subdirectories) of source/ and move them to a new target directory.\nFor instance, let's say the original source/ looks like this:\n/source/dir1               --Subdirectory without sub-subdirectory\n/source/dir2               --Subdirectory with sub-subdirectory\n/source/dir2/dir2.a        --Sub-subdirectory without sub-sub-subdirectory\n/source/dir2/dir2.b        --Sub-subdirectory without sub-sub-subdirectory\n\nThen after the operation, the target directory should look like this:\n/target/dir1\n/target/dir2.a\n/target/dir2.b\n\nIs there a way to do this with a terminal command?\n\nA: Assuming you are on a file-system where leaf directories have exactly 2 hard links, you can use a combination of find, xargs and mv like so:\n$ find . -type d -printf \"%n %p\\n\"                   \\\n    | grep '^2 '                                     \\\n    | perl -ne 'chomp; s/[0-9]+\\s+//; print \"$_\\0\";' \\\n    | xargs -0 -I'{}' mv -v '{}' /target/\n\nThis uses find to find only directories and print the number of hard links those directories have.\nThen we use grep to remove any that aren't \"leaves\".\nNext we use Perl to chop off the hard-link count, and print the files separated by \\0.\nFinally that lets us use xargs with the -0 flag to move the found directories into the target directory.\nUsing nulls (\\0) rather than newlines or spaces is important for files with spaces in them. If your directory names are guaranteed not to have spaces in them you might be able to simplify slightly.\n$ find . -type d -printf \"%n %p\\n\" | grep '2 ' | cut -d \" \" -f 2 | xargs -I'{}' mv -v '{}' /target/\n\nBut it's probably better to be safe than sorry.\n\nA: One approach might be to use find to get each directory, and pass the results to a second find, and perform the move only if the second find does to return any directories below the given one e.g. \nwhile read -rd $'\\0' dir; do \n    [[ -z $(find \"$dir\" -mindepth 1 -type d) ]] && mv -t path/to/target \"$dir\"\ndone < <(find -depth -type d -print0)\n\nor\nfind -depth -type d -execdir \\\nbash -c '[[ -z $(find \"$0\" -mindepth 1 -type d) ]] && mv -t path/to/target \"$0\"' {} +\n\ne.g. given \n$ tree .\n.\n├── dir1\n└── dir2\n    ├── dir2.a\n    └── dir2.b\n\nthen\n$ while read -rd $'\\0' dir; do [[ -z $(find \"$dir\" -mindepth 1 -type d) ]] && echo mv -t path/to/target \"$dir\"; done < <(find -depth -type d -print0)\nmv -t path/to/target ./dir1\nmv -t path/to/target ./dir2/dir2.b\nmv -t path/to/target ./dir2/dir2.a\n\n", "Q: Configuring mouse buttons to switch between apps? I just installed 14.04, so I'm using the default setup (Unity, I guess).\nI have these two extra mouse buttons on the side of my mouse.  Is there any way to map these so they can switch between open apps?\nWhat would be perfect is if clicking on button 6 (or whatever it is) would cycle forward through apps, button 7 would go backwards, and holding one of the buttons would show the task list and let you click on the app you want.  That's really what I want.\n\nA: This is copied off of this answer, with a few changes for clarification. Please vote up that answer, not my one.\nBy installing a couple packages you can configure this pretty easily without too much trouble at all. No matter what version of Linux I'm using i am always sure to install two specific applications when it comes to mouse and keyboard emulation.\nThese being:\nxautomation is a set of command line programs to control X and do \"visual scraping\" to find things on the screen. There are six different programs to this application but the one we are gonna be concerning ourself with is xte. This program allows us to send arbitrary mouse and keyboard events to the kernel by utilizing the \"XTest\" extension.\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\nxbindkeys is a program that enables us to bind commands to certain keys or key combinations on the keyboard and is window manager independent, so whether you are in Gnome, Unity, KDE, etc... it makes no difference.\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\n**By using these two programs together we can make the keyboard and mouse do just about anything we want them to.*\nYou say you want to use the thumb button in your case for instance, well first we need to find what \"mouse button number\" X Server is recognizing when you click it. We will use a useful tool called xev to run this program do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up a terminal window and type the following command at the prompt\n\n\nxev\nXev creates a window and then asks the X server to send it events whenever anything happens to the window (such as it being moved, resized, typed in, clicked in, etc.). You can also attach it to an existing window. It is useful for seeing what causes events to occur and to display the information that they contain; it is essentially a debugging and development tool, and should not be needed in normal usage.\nHover your mouse over the event window that opened on your screen and click your thumb button. You will see alot of things happening in your terminal window but the one thing that we are concerned with is the \"button number\" of the one you just clicked. This can be found at the bottom of your terminal window and should look something similar to the following line:\nstate 0x10, button 1, same_screen YES\nThe button part is what were interested in. Being yours is a thumb button its probably gonna say button 8 or button 9 but it could be any number. Remember or write down that number for we will use it later. You can now close xev we no longer need this program.\nNow to get things working!!\nAssuming you have installed the xautomation and xbindkeys applications as stated above, we will go ahead and do the following:\n\n\n*Open up your favorite text editor and create a new file inside your home directory called .xbindkeysrc this is the configuration file that xbindkeys is going to use to make your mouse or keyboard do the special things we'd like it to do.\n\n*Type the following inside the file:\n\"xdotool key alt+Tab\"\nb:X + Release\nNote: **Be sure to replace X with whatever number you wrote down for your thumb button from when we ran xev earlier*.\nNote: **There should also be no spaces between the first line and the second line. If you have a space you will get an error when you run xbindkeys.*\nWhats were telling xbindkeys to do here is to take the action of clicking and releasing your thumb button and make it do the action of double clicking your left mouse button which is represented but 'mouseclick 1' 'mouseclick 1'\n\n\n*Save the file and we should be good to go.\n\n\nOk lets test it out!!\n\n\n*Open a terminal window and type the following so we can test the functionality:\n\n\nxbindkeys -n -v\nThis will run the xbindkeys program in debug mode so that we can see whats happening when you click on your button. It will tell you that its reading the .xbindkeysrc file that we created and using it for its configuration. If all goes well then you should end up with a line saying Starting Loop\nNow if you click on your thumb button on your mouse then you should see some things happening in your terminal, meaning that it's recognizing the button press. You should now be getting the same functionality as you would by double-clicking with the left button of your mouse.\nYou should be able to test this out by using the thumb button and clicking on the menu bar of the terminal, which should maximize or minimize it, thus doing the same thing as a double click would do with the left mouse button.\nNow  and exit the program.\nNote: In order for this all to work all the time, we need to have xbindkeys running in the background at all times. If you just add a new command xbindkeys without the -n -v in your startup applications then it will start every time you log in to your window manager.\nI've tried to explain in the best detail on how to go about doing this, hopefully you have been able to understand and complete this action with success. :)\n", "Q: Unity Launcher and Top Panel disappeared in 14.04 The top panel and Unity launcher have disappeared in Ubuntu 14.04. Also cannot access the terminal via Ctrl+Alt+T.\n I have tried every solution for this issue that I can find, from re-installing unity and compiz to resetting Unity and everything. I've gone into the compiz manager and reactivated Unity.\nNothing has worked.\nWhen trying to reset Unity, or do anything with it really, I get this message\n\n(process:6332): dconf-WARNING **: failed to commit changes to dconf: Could not connect: Connection refused\n\n\nEDIT:\nInstalled 14.04 a day ago. The issue happened after a reboot. After installing virtual Box\n\nA: Enter the following commands:- Ctrl+Alt+F1\nlogin there with username and password \n\nWARNING! THE FOLLOWING COMMAND WILL TERMINATE YOUR ACTIVE SESSION!\n\ntry:\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nIf restarting lightdm doesn't fix the problem, install aptitude and then install unity:\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\nsudo apt-get update && sudo aptitude -f install && sudo aptitude dist-upgrade\nsudo aptitude install unity\n\nRead the outputs carefully. If you do have broken dependencies, aptitude will give you the \"solution\" of NOT installing unity. Say no to this solution. Then it will give you another solution which will install broken dependencies. Say yes to this one. Once installation is complete,\nsudo service lightdm restart again. If you still have some issues, also reinstall ubuntu-desktop:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nfollowed by another sudo service lightdm restart.\n(Credit to @DinGODzilla from this question)\n\nA: Hold down Alt-F2, which will bring up a dialog to enter terminal commands. There, type the command cinnamon-launcher and hit enter. That should restore the panel.\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: I have same issue in ubunt 14.04, i fix it by below steps\n\n\n*\n\n*ctrl+alt+f1\n\n*enter username and password\n\n*run mv ~/.config ~/.config_backup\n\n*run sudo service lightdm restart\nHope it will work\n\nA: I have similar issue with gnome panels. Instead of restarting lightdm which kills the session and closes the apps. I solve the issue by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Minimizing all the apps;\n\n*Pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del (you might need\nto do it a couple of times); \n\n*After 2. a popup asking to logout\nappears - close it or it would log you out.\n\n\nThe panels are back again. This trick always helps me when gnome panels disappear.\n", "Q: Audio output and input stopped working after the last update I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and everything was perfect until todays's update.

Do I need to literally check that $1 equals the literall -v or there's a better approach (since options are so commoly used, I guess there are different meachanisms)?\n\nA: I'd definitely suggest using bash's getopts for processing any command line options - there's a Small getopts tutorial at wiki.bash-hackers.org which I found very helpful.\nFor the output redirection, instead of storing the file descriptor(s), you can just conditionally redirect the stream(s) before the body of your script or (possibly more cleanly), just close the stream(s) using exec n>&- where n is the numeric file descriptor of the stream (1 = stdout, 2 = stderr).\nIMHO it would be more natural to keep output when the command is run with no arguments, and have a -q (quiet) option to dump output to /dev/null - for example\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile getopts \":q\" opt; do\n  case $opt in\n    q) \n      quiet=1\n      ;;\n    \\?)\n      echo \"Invalid option: -$OPTARG\" >&2\n      ;;\n  esac\ndone\n\nif [ \"${quiet:-0}\" -ne 0 ]; then\n   exec 1>&- 2>&-\nfi\n\n#\n# remainder of your script here\n#\n\nIf you're convinced you want to do the opposite (i.e. send stdout and stderr to /dev/null by default) then you can flip the logic. \n\nA: You can name standard output in a script shell using any of:\n\n\n*\n\n*1\n\n*/dev/stdout\n\n*/proc/self/fd/1\nAll are just ways of saying \"file descriptor #1\", which is the conventional pre-opened data sink for output.\n(In fact, the redirect syntax > just changes that pre-opened fd so that when the subcommand tries to write to fd 1, it actually goes to some other file or device.  >& does the same to both descriptors 1=stdout and 2=stderr.)\nIf you have just the one flag, there's nothing wrong with just checking $1.  There are several ways to do commandline option processing, but one powerful tool is getopt.

During the Ubuntu install process, the installer did not recognize the Windows 10 OS. \nI ran diskmgmt.exe in Windows and saw that the disk had an MBR partition:\nMBR Partition\n\nPreviously, I had Windows 7 installed and got upgraded to Windows 10. I think this is how I ended up getting Windows 10 with an MBR partition. From my understanding, Windows 10 needs to have a GPT partition in order to have UEFI BIOS, otherwise you'll end up with legacy BIOS. \nThis seems to cause the error during the install process. Ubuntu 18.04 has a UEFI BIOS; Windows 10 will also need to have a UEFI BIOS, or it won't be recognized.\nI ran the mbr2gpt tool that comes installed with Windows 10 Creator's Edition:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfJep4hmg9o\nThis procedure will allow you to change the Windows partition from MBR to GPT. You'll need to get a WindowsPE USB to run this tool:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/boot-to-winpe\nAfter changing the partition, you'll be able to switch to UEFI mode in your BIOS. Once the BIOS was set to UEFI, the Ubuntu installer recognized the Windows 10 OS and I was able to dual boot both systems.\n\nA: Click Do Something Else. You will see your partitions on the drive.

So, I have a Powerbook G4 17\" right now and the ribbon cable connecting the ODD drive to the motherboard is dead. Somebody has torn the cable from the board and the cable is completely knackered. The connector on the board looks fine, as is the connector on the ODD drive, but I have no way of getting a new ribbon cable at this time. \nSo, is there any way of installing Ubuntu onto the powerbook via a mounted ISO on a USB drive? The Powerbook is already running Ubuntu, but the previous owner had pulled the power half way through an update, so, it's pretty much ruined. I have several versions of Ubuntu for PPC already on my hard drive, but would there be a way of booting a mounted ISO file from a USB drive through OpenFirmware or something? If not, I guess I'll buy a broken powerbook for a small amount of money and get the ribbon cable out of it, but if there is a way, i'd greatly appreciate it if somebody could point me in the right direction :)\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, the answer is yes yes because you can just run Ubuntu live off your flash drive. Even if the hard drive is disconnected from the system, the hard drive is not involved in the process of running Ubuntu live unless you want to install Ubuntu to your hard drive.\nFirst, boot from your flash drive and choose \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" and press the Enter or Return key.\n\nThen, Ubuntu loads the kernel, does a bunch of other stuff, and then you should see the Unity desktop if everything went well.

But if you prefer to use a USB stick, please follow the instructions below.\nNote: this procedure requires that you create an .img file from the .iso file you download. It will also change the filesystem that is on the USB stick to make it bootable, so backup all data before continuing.\nTip: Drag and drop a file from Finder to Terminal to 'paste' the full path without risking typing errors.\n1) Download Ubuntu Desktop\n2) Open the Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities/ or query Terminal in Spotlight).\n3) Convert the .iso file to .img using the convert option of hdiutil (e.g. hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso)\nNote: OS X tends to put the .dmg ending on the output file automatically.\n4) Run diskutil list to get the current list of devices.\n5) Insert your flash media.\n6)  Run diskutil list again and determine the device node assigned to your flash media (e.g. /dev/disk2). \n7) Run diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN (replace N with the disk number from the last command; in the previous example, N would be 2).\n8) Execute sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m (replace /path/to/downloaded.img with the path where the image file is located; for example, ./ubuntu.img or ./ubuntu.dmg).\n\nNotes:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Using /dev/rdisk instead of /dev/disk may be faster\n  \n*If you see the error dd: Invalid number '1m', you are using GNU dd. Use the same command but replace bs=1m with bs=1M\n  \n*If you see the error dd: /dev/diskN: Resource busy, make sure the disk is not in use. Start the 'Disk Utility.app' and unmount (don't eject) the drive\n  \n\n9)  Run diskutil eject /dev/diskN and remove your flash media when the command completes.\n10) Restart your Mac and press alt/option key while the Mac is restarting to choose the USB stick.\n\nA: You need to make sure that the .iso is extracted when you put it on the flash drive. By turning it into a .dmg you compressed it more. It needs to be extracted so the 15 or so files and folders are on your flash drive.

I recently installed Ubuntu in the Parallels virtual machine (version 9) on OS X Mavericks. It was working fine for a while. Then it asked me if I wanted to update the system. I should have said no, apparently.  I have deleted and reinstalled the virtual machine several times (including reinstalling the old version that worked before), but in each one I get a bug. At one point I had a launcher on the screen, but when I did anything the screen would flash white and nothing would happen.\nMost commonly, including in the current version (14.04 Mac), I have no launcher and no pull-down menus available. I can't even press Ctrl-Alt-T (or Cmd-Alt-T) to get a terminal.

I looked at this solution - Unity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears - and it doesn't work; pressing Ctrl-Alt-F1 at login appears to do nothing. \nShould I deinstall Parallels entirely? Is there something else I can do?\n\nA: I'd imagine that because you're in a virtualised situation, all sorts of keyboard shortcuts aren't sent directly to the VM and/or they're being intercepted by OSX.

Should I user the built-in ubuntu users or should a use something else?\n\nA: You can do this via UNIX permissions, and already exists as based in Ubuntu.\nHome folders can do this already. Each user, as you know, has a home folder. They (and the superuser) are the only ones who can read files in there.\nProcesses start with the same permission set as the user. For example, a execuatable containing rm -rf /etc/ will only successfully run if that user has permission to write directly to /etc. However, you should note that system files NEED to be read by all users. You can't change that without SERIOUS problems.\n", "Q: Lot of \"file not found\" when using sudo find / -type s In the attempt to understand why I keep getting the following error \nerror: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)' \n\nwhile using the command sudo find / -type s the terminal prompted something like this\nfind: ‘/proc/31348/task/31348/fd/5’: No such file or directory\nfind: ‘/proc/31348/task/31348/fdinfo/5’: No such file or directory\nfind: ‘/proc/31348/fd/5’: No such file or directory\nfind: ‘/proc/31348/fdinfo/5’: No such file or directory\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nA: These errors happen because these files belong to a special filesystem procfs (mounted at /proc). The proc filesystem presents information about processes in a hierarchical file-like structure, so at the moment when find tries to access these special files, they were no longer present.\nTo ignore these errors, add -xdev for GNU find (or -x for BSD find), e.g.\nsudo find / -type s -xdev\n\n\n-xdev Don't descend directories on other filesystems.\n\nSee also: How to exclude the folders proc and sys from search with find command?\n\nA: /proc is a pseudo-filesystem, files under /proc don't actually exist on your hard drive. They contain information on currently running processes. These errors occur because some processes exited while find was running. It's totally normal.\n(Actually, if you run find over and over again, and use a command such as ps a | grep find to get the PID of your find command, you'll see the same PID as the ones in the error messages. It's kind of like when you do ps a | grep ps the grep command will be \"grapped\" too.)\n\nA: find complains because she sees a zombie process with the process id 31348.\nMy find was complaining for process 4052 whenever I used her,\nfind: ‘/proc/4052/task/4052/ns/net’: No such file or directory\nfind: ‘/proc/4052/task/4052/ns/uts’: No such file or directory\nfind: ‘/proc/4052/task/4052/ns/ipc’: No such file or directory\nfind: ‘/proc/4052/ns/net’: No such file or directory\nfind: ‘/proc/4052/ns/uts’: No such file or directory\nfind: ‘/proc/4052/ns/ipc’: No such file or directory\n\n[root@mylaptop /]# ps -ef | grep 4052\nroot      4052  4043  0 Jun19 ?        00:00:00 [sh] <defunct>\n\nSo,\nIn my case it was a zombie process that was created a few hours ago (during a Linux operation of mine).

Usually, that part of the desktop isn't mapped and it's just dead space (either blue or black). When I open Nvidia-settings and go to the \"X Server Display Configuration\" page it is as it should be. Underscan is set at \"36\". But, I have to change underscan (up one or down one), apply, then change it back to 36 for it to display properly without any panning to dead space. Anyone know how to correct this?\n\nA: You can try to compensate the underscan with this command:\nnvidia-settings -a CurrentMetaMode=\"DFP-1: 1280x720 { ViewPortIn=1280x720,ViewPortOut=1230x672-25-24 }\"\n\nNote that this command is for 720p resolution and 25 is the amount of pixels that the dead area goes horizontally and 24 is the amount of pixels that it goes vertically. Substitute those values with desired ones.\nIf that worked you can make this fix permanent by saving these configurations onto your xorg file:\nsudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nLook for 'Section \"Device\"', if your xorg doesn't have such section or it is empty, create this section:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier    \"Default Device\"  \n    Option        \"NoLogo\" \"True\"\nEndSection\n\nUnder this section add one option so it will be like this:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier    \"Default Device\"  \n    Option        \"NoLogo\" \"True\"\n    Option        \"metamodes\" \"DFP-1: 1280x720 { ViewPortIn=1280x720,ViewPortOut=1230x672-25-24 }\"\nEndSection\n\nSave it, restart your computer and now it should be fixed.\n\nA: There's a three word answer I found by Linus Torvalds that I think sums it up. Tried nvidia-persistenced last night. No avail. Still have to open nvidia-settings on boot. It still displays the accurate adjustments but I still have to toggle underscan, apply, toggle back, apply. I'm with Linus.\n\nA: I had the exact same issues with the 331.38 drivers on my 8800 GT and I was unable to resolve the issue by modifying the xorg.conf file, however I was able to fix it by adding the following to the logon script in /etc/profile.d:\nnvidia-settings --assign 0/CurrentMetaMode=\"DFP-0: 1920x1080 { ViewPortIn=1920x1080, ViewPortOut=1834x1031+43+24 }\"\n\nRodrigo's Answer above pointed me in the right direction.

This is very annoying and I couldn't find a solution online.\nCan anyone tell me whether there is a solution to this problem and how would I fix it?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The simple initial approach would be to simply adjust your touchpad configuration, perhaps tun your sensitivity down, especially if it moves that much simply from taking your finger off the pad.

In reference to your issue, the section on Jumpy Touchpad and lack of middle button seems appropriate. Here is their suggestion:\nTry creating the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf with this content:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n    # This option is recommend on all Linux systems using evdev, but cannot be\n    # enabled by default.

This solved it on my Yoga 2 Pro:\nsynclient HorizHysteresis=32 && synclient VertHysteresis=32\n\n\nA: These answers have nothing to do with the question.  There isn't a touchpad parameter for \"amount to jump around randomly\".  Yes, most of us have tried changing the various sensitivities but that only changes how fast and how much pressure it takes...for the curse to jump around randomly.\nTo be clear, we're talking about the fact that Ideapads under Linux, when you simply touch the pad and leave your finger at the touch point, the cursor starts jumping around on the screen.  Decrease the sensitivity and it takes more pressure before it starts jumping around.  \nNone of these answers have anything to do with that.  The bottom line is that IBM's taking over the hardware has MANY issues and seldom works right.  Ever had it mute itself whilst reporting full volume?  Dim the screen whilst reporting full brightness?  These are all things where the IBM drivers are intercepting commands \"to help you\" with some \"value added feature\".  Like most of those \"features\", it doesn't work right and you can't turn it off.\nI have had some success cleaning under the space bar and alt key.  It does this under Windoze as well and has been widely reported.\nI've always known IBM laptops were prone to that.  I've never seen it this bad though.

The reason is that the VirtualBox installer copies specific files to the host system to configure it:\n/lib/udev/rules.d/60-virtualbox.rules\n/lib/udev/rules.d/60-virtualbox-dkms.rules\n\nIt also installs kernel modules on the host system:\n/lib/modules/3.14-1-amd64/updates/dkms/vboxdrv.ko\n/lib/modules/3.14-1-amd64/updates/dkms/vboxnetadp.ko\n/lib/modules/3.14-1-amd64/updates/dkms/vboxnetflt.ko\n/lib/modules/3.14-1-amd64/updates/dkms/vboxpci.ko\n\nYou need to do a proper install so that the host gets udev and the kernel modules that it requires in order to run VirtualBox.\n", "Q: Can I install LAMP over an existing Apache?

Thanks in advance for any information and help.\n\nA: Assuming that you no have need to keep the previous users version and configuration of Ubuntu, I would say that you most logical and easiest course is to just reinstall Ubuntu. There's tons of tutorials on how to do that. Its dead easy anyway. Just burn an iso image of Ubuntu to disk to get started.\nIn your case, your issue might be your windows partition. If you are content at loosing it, You can just overwrite it and have your new Ubuntu use the entire disk. In that case you have no problem there. \nIf you do expect to somehow regain acces to the windows installation, you will want to leave that partition alone. You might have somebootloader issues to solve later, but those can be fixed usually. \nBefore you do anything permanent, check that your system meets minimum requirements for the latest Ubuntu version (14.04). If not, try an older version (12.10 obviously works. because thats what you have now). Also, check if ubuntu will run off the dvd/flash memory drive (Option: Try Ubuntu)\nBest of luck\n", "Q: Creating A Simple Bash Script With Multiple Commands Trying to create a bash script that opens gnome-terminal, and then runs ls to display the contents of a directory, but it just opens gnome-terminal. I will be creating some other scripts that also use multiple commands.\nMy script:\n\n#!/bin/bash\ngnome-terminal\nls -a /examplefolder\n\nEDIT:\nTo clarify what I'm trying to achieve. I'm trying to create a script that will open gnome-terminal, list the contents of /examplefolder, and then be ready for regular terminal usage. Is this possible, or am I barking up the wrong tree?\n\nA: (For Ubuntu 12.04) The problem here is that with your script bash will open a gnome-terminal and then executed the command in you current terminal instead of the newly opened one (if that's what you are actually trying to do.)\nNote: Also as suggested by @unorthodox grammar & should be used at the end of the command that you don't want to wait for (allowing them to run in background). However, interestingly that's not the problem at least in Ubuntu 12.04. But perhaps in other Ubuntu flavors this might be an issue.\nYou can execute the commands in the newly opened gnome-terminal by using the following command:\ngnome-terminal -e \"ls -a /examplefolder\"\nor \ngnome-terminal --command \"ls -a /examplefolder\"\nHowever, this would close the terminal as soon as the commands are executed and if you want to see the result of those command you won't be able to. Note that gnome-terminal is not designed for this use case (seeing the results in a newly opened gnome-terminal from script). One of the work around as defined in this nice answer is the following:\nLet gnome-terminal run bash and tell bash to run your commands and then run bash\ngnome-terminal -e \"bash -c \\\"echo foo; echo bar; exec bash\\\"\"\nor \ngnome-terminal -x bash -c \"echo foo; echo bar; bash\"\nThe exec bash at the end is necessary because bash -c will terminate once the commands are done. exec causes the running process to be replaced by the new process, otherwise you will have two bash processes running.\nYou can refer to this answer for further workarounds.\n\nA: In a bash script, commands are run one after another. Your script launches gnome-terminal, waits for it to terminate then runs ls -a /examplefolder. To run a command through gnome-terminal, use the -x parameter:\ngnome-terminal -x bash -c 'ls -a /examplefolder; read -p \"Press [ENTER] to continue...\"'\n\nThis will start bash in the newly opened terminal, and make it run the ls and read commands.\nBy the way, do you have any specific reasons to start a to start a terminal from a shell script? (Usually it's the other way around.) If you just want to start a shell script from your desktop and see it's results in a terminal, you could just create a launcher for the script and select \"run in terminal\", at least in Xubuntu, but I'm pretty sure other flavours have a similar option.\n\nA: For commands to execute 1 after another without waiting for previous to finish:\n\n#!/bin/bash\nls -a /examplefolder &\nleafpad &\nls -a /home &\nexec bash\n\nFor commands to execute 1 after another, waiting for previous to finish first:\n\n#!/bin/bash\nls -a /examplefolder\nleafpad\nls -a /home\nexec bash\n\nAs suggested by MB_CE's answer the use of \"exec bash\" as a final command can be used to hold the terminal open, because technically bash is still running.\n\nA: Show output in terminal\ngnome-terminal -x  bash -c \"echo foo; echo  bar; read || sleep 9999\"  \n\nor in GUI widow  \n ( echo foo;  sleep 5; echo  bar ) | zenity --text-info\n\n", "Q: Man Page Complete External Documentation pdf or text build Ubuntu 14.04\nman Version 2.6.7.1\ngedit Version 3.10.4\nI'm in the process of putting together a Complete Man Page Documentation, currently as a txt file, hopefully as a pdf eventually once I find a converter with reasonable formatting, with the end goal of being able to make it available to the Community as an alternative, update-able resource(I've certainly seen enough questions about it). The issue I ran into is that the command I'm using to process the man files returns characters outside the encoding of at least gedit(haven't tried with alternative editors, yet). Here is my process so far:\nalias manGet=\"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade;man -a /bin/* > binMan.txt && man -a /sbin/* > sbinMan.txt;cat binMan.txt sbinMan.txt > manAll.txt;gedit manAll.txt\"\nmanGet\n\nOnce in gedit, the encoding issues seem to crop up near page-breaks, where it will show a fairly long series of non-displayable characters. So, two questions, in essence:\n1) How do I update character encoding to display these files, if possible?\n2) If not, how do I go about either downloading an encoding that supports them, or filtering them from the file selectively?\nAny help you could provide would be greatly appreciated.\nNote: I downloaded and installed unicode, thinking I might be able to use that to find the appropriate encoding, with no luck( I think I just don't know how to use it yet, personally)\n\nA: A few things. Let's start with your approach to capturing all these manpages. Let man do that all for you with man -k . — we'll start with a shorter example:\n$ man -k rmdir\nrmdir (1)            - remove empty directories\nrmdir (1posix)       - remove directories\nrmdir (2)            - delete a directory\nrmdir (3posix)       - remove a directory\n\nWe need to parse that list. We need the command and the section which is wrapped in brackets. We can tell awk to split this up for us using its -F argument (we just tell it what characters our delimiters are) and as a bonus, to save messing around with Bash variables, we can have awk create the next command too.\nBefore we get there, we need to know what command we want to run. man can generate HTML files if groff is installed (sudo apt-get install groff). This is probably the best possible idea for you right now as it's fairly simple formatting that is preserved. It's also fairly universal these days. We use -Hcat to tell it to render HTML to the cat command (it expects a browser). The 1 there is the section (see man man for more on those).\nman -Hcat 1 rmdir\n\nSo to bring this all back around, let's have awk split up the man -k output, create the command and execute it in one little line:\nman -k . | awk -F '[ ()]' '{print \"man -Hcat\",$3,$1,\" > \"$1\".\"$3\".html\" | \"/bin/sh\"}'\n\nThat will create a HTML file for every man page. It will take a long time to finish so I'd suggest just testing it with the rmdir example while so I suggest just starting with rmdir:\nman -k rmdir | awk -F '[ ()]' '{print \"man -Hcat\",$3,$1,\" > \"$1\".\"$3\".html\" | \"/bin/sh\"}'\n\nThat gives me 4 HTML files (rmdir.1.html, rmdir.1posix.html, rmdir.2.html and rmdir.3posix.html). To turn these into a book I strongly suggest looking at htmldoc. This is both a command-line and graphical application. I'd suggest getting used to the graphical version first.\nAnd there you go. All your manpages sorted, with a table of contents (if you want it), with formatting preserved in a nice document output (HTML or PDF).\n\nA: There are a lot of serious problems doing it that way. I notice that when I run that, it causes the terminal to spit out tons of errors per second. A better way would be to do it like this:\nfor binary in $(ls /bin); do man -a $binary >> ~/binMan.txt; done\n\nHowever, I think it would be better if you made a file per program, which in that case could be achieved as:\nfor binary in $(ls /bin); do man -a $binary > ~/$binary.txt; done\n\n", "Q: Problem installing Ubuntu On Mbr disk Scheme not GPT I'm having trouble installing Ubuntu on my Mbr disk scheme with windows 7 already installed \non UEFI Legacy mode but when trying to manual specify partition for installation i found 3 more partitions added automatically and the disk scheme converted to GPT Style and lost windows 7 which formatted by ubuntu I don't want GPT style at all. I have tried Ubuntu, ElementaryOS, Fedora latest distro all are the same. Is there any way installing Ubuntu like before with Mbr disk scheme without converting Disk to GPT style?\n\nA: The main problem seems to be that you are installing Linux using UEFI mode, which will automatically convert the partition scheme to GPT, which is necessarry for UEFI.\nIf you want to keep Windows and Linux on legacy BIOS, simply make sure you are booting into the non-UEFI mode. Exactly how you do that depends on your motherboard.

My guess is that within Ubuntu it does not recognize my Windows Installation on sda1 anymore. I can't mount it aswell.\nI can only mount it via Truecrypt itself. I think I might have to manually insert the menu item for Windows into that Grub config file. I guess that after entering the password in the truecrypt bootloader it would be possible to start Windows if the item was there - just a guess though.\nEdit:\nI basically followed these steps to set up my system:\nDual Booting Windows 7 with Ubuntu 12.04LTS with Truecrypt\n\nA: The problem is that Ubuntu has no idea what are those partition about:\nsda1: ____________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       \n    Boot sector type:  Unknown\n    Boot sector info: \n    Mounting failed:   mount: unknown filesystem type ''\n\nsda2: ____________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       \n    Boot sector type:  Unknown\n    Boot sector info: \n    Mounting failed:   mount: unknown filesystem type ''\nmount: unknown filesystem type ''\n\nSo, you need to tell Ubuntu how to read it. For this you should try mounting the encrypted filesystem and save your data first. Download the Linux version of Truecrypt from a secure source (truecrypt.sourceforge.com is not secure anymore). This step is done as precaution. Do the same with the contents of the /boot directory.\nNow, verify you have installed in the live installation the cryptsetup package. It should be able to detect truecrypt filesystems without problems. Now, use grub-install to fix your boot:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/{boot,ntfs1,ntfs2}\nsudo cryptsetup --type tcrypt open /dev/sda1 /mnt/ntfs1\nsudo cryptsetup --type tcrypt open /dev/sda2 /mnt/ntfs2\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/boot\nsudo grub-install --boot-director=/mnt/boot /dev/sda\n\nThen, I expect that before doing this you have, a full image of the disk, back up of your important information, etc. since I cannot guarantee it would work (ie, grub blowing up the truecrypt bootloader).\n\nA: So the solution was rather simple and my initial guess was right.\nI just added the following via\nsudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\nset root=(hd0,msdos1)\nchainloader +1\n}\n\nwhere hd0 represents my disk and msdos1 my Windows OS on the first partition of my SSD sda1.

Don't forget in my setup the first thing showing up is the TrueCrypt bootloader chaining into Grub2. Running ubuntu though, the partition is encrypted again and sudo update-grub2 just finds raw binary data.  \nFor related problems I suggest to just try different entries in your 40_custom file before you do major changes to your system itself!

Then use the install command to install it: \nsudo apt-get install (recommended driver file)\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nReboot the pc, and see if this has repaired the problem. \n\nA: Does your guest session work?  If so, your problem is a conflict with the old desktop configuration files.  A fresh start should fix things. Try backing up all the files starting with a dot (e.g. .Xauthority) and deleting them (directories too), from a virtual terminal (Ctrl-alt-F1).  Then try the graphical login (Alt F7) (or reboot).  New \"dot\" files will be created as needed with the new formats.\n\nA: gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.background active true \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons true \n\nfor those who still use 14.04\n(strange way of formatting comments)\n\nA: I'm assuming you are referring to the unity launcher, i had a similar problem after installing 14.04, try pressing F1 when booting your PC, that will prompt you a menu where you can select which version of ubuntu to boot, select the one does not mention (safe mode), i should be fine.\nIf is about icons missing from your desktop just launch nautilus in your unity launcher and place them in the desktop folder, then you should regain them.\n\nA: Similar to Dhartman2076, and following an Ubuntu forum post, you can reset your Unity icons:\n\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\nDISPLAY=:0 dconf reset -f /org/compiz/\nunity --reset-icons\nsetsid unity\n\n\nNote that if you run these from graphical mode, it will do funny things to your screen.  (All my windows lost their borders when I did it.)  You could instead type them on a true terminal console by typing Ctl+Alt+F1 to go to the console, and typing the commands there.  I put them in a file by using\ncat > tmp-instructions\n\nfollowed by pasting these instructions into the file, and the  typing Ctl-D. Then from any command prompt in the same folder, I can read the instructions again with\ncat tmp-instructions.\n\nWith the instructions above made accessible from the command prompt in this way, I found it easier to proceed.\nThen you can reboot once you've run the commands.\nsudo reboot\n\nFinal warning: This could also seriously mess up your desktop. I have no idea, I'm not familiar with these commands. But it worked for me.\n", "Q: Recommended setup for live audio / video broadcast We would like to capture audio from a mixer and video from a camera and transmit it via Wi-Fi to adjacent rooms of an auditorium.\nWhat kind of broadcast/streaming programs/setup do you suggest?\nWe just need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Low latency.

I removed those 2 software using Wine, but cannot remove Advanced System Care. Why can't I remove and how can I remove it ?\n\nA: If you don't have any other software running under wine, you could just remove all the wine folder hidden on your $HOME directory by entering in a terminal:\nrm -rvf $HOME/.wine\n\nThe folder will be recreated next time you try to install other programs in wine so don't worry. But if  you don't like this option, you can just search the file structure for the program and delete its folder:\nnautilus $HOME/.wine/drive_c\n\nYour program should be in \"Program Files\" or some usual Windows location like that.

Just a theoretical question...\nBut what would happen if init (in /sbin/init) would be removed?\n\nA: The boot loader will load the kernel, the kernel would attempt to run init, not find it and panic.\nThe way out of it is to reboot, edit the boot parameters, add init=/bin/bash and boot that way. The kernel will use bash as init. This will give you a chance to run commands and fix the system.\nCorrection\nApparently the kernel (file init/main.c) does:\nif (!try_to_run_init_process(\"/sbin/init\") ||\n    !try_to_run_init_process(\"/etc/init\") ||\n    !try_to_run_init_process(\"/bin/init\") ||\n    !try_to_run_init_process(\"/bin/sh\"))\n        return 0;\n\npanic(\"No working init found.  Try passing init= option to kernel. \"\n      \"See Linux Documentation/init.txt for guidance.\");\n\nSo it would find /bin/sh (which is a link to dash) and that will give you a shell and a chance to fix it without using the init=/bin/bash boot parameter.\n\nA: Nothing happens, until you try to reboot.  As long as the system is running, and you don't try to switch runlevels by running /sbin/init n, you wouldn't even realize it was gone.\nActually, deletion of /sbin/init is undoable if you realize the mistake early and stay calm.  System administrators have recovered from much nastier \"lobotomies\" while keeping the operating system running.\nOne way to recover from the deletion of /sbin/init is to reinstall the upstart package using APT.\nThe macho way to recover is to use only the resources on the machine itself.  One factor in your favour is that /sbin/init is always running.  Therefore, when you run rm /sbin/init, the file is merely unlinked from the filesystem.  The inode and file contents remain on disk and in memory until PID 1 exits.  You merely need to re-create  /sbin/init from the appropriate inode.\nThe easiest way to accomplish that is:\n# cp /proc/1/exe /sbin/init\n# chmod 755 /sbin/init\n\n", "Q: Unable to Install ubuntu onto a blank hard drive I just built a pc and I am trying to install Ubuntu 14 onto it.

When I try to change root permissions, I get some error reports. I have already tried sudo chown -R 777 / and sudo chmod -R 777 /. Please help me if I am doing any mistakes. Is there any command to access my root folder or root user? \n\nA: sudo chmod -R 777 / sounds like an incredibly bad idea. If you ran that command successfully, you will probably want to reinstall your system right away, since you made all your files accessible and executable.\nUbuntu systems don't have a root password by default for security reasons. Users in the sudo group can run any commands as root using the sudo command, but you should think twice, because you can (no, you will) break your system if you don't know what you're doing. If you really want a root shell, you can get one with sudo su -. You have been warned. To read more about how to use sudo, please refer to the Official Documentation.\nAbout installing ruby1.8, that's a quite different question.

However your Sempron is a 32 bit and will not accept a 64 bit install.\nAs a rule of thumb, anything under 4 GB of RAM should have a 32 bit OS installed.\n", "Q: Mount file system path as encrypted? I know how to mount an encrypted ext4 partition. However, now I want to do the opposite. I want to mount a folder of an existing partition somewhere else in my filesystem, but when accessing it, files should get encrypted using AES256. Is that possible?\nHere an example: I have a folder containing some images 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc. I want to mount this folder in another location so that the content of the images are encrypted. Filenames shouldn't change.\nBackground: I want to synchronise my image folder to a cloud storage, but I want to encrypt the files before upload. The tools provided by the cloud provider don't support client side encryption. Therefore, I want to use the tools on a folder only containing encrypted data.\n\nA: I suggest rsync with encryption.

Each command behaves differently and uses different switches, so without knowing the specific command, it's not possible to tell what these mean. Read the manual (man apt-get, for example) or try using --help with any command.\nUse unzip file.zip to extract a zip file and tar xzf file.tar.gz to extract a tar.gz file.\n\nA: \nWhy must you do sudo apt-get update before installing an program or after downloading something?

It just update the repositories and PPA's.\n\nWhat is the different between sudo gedit /location/to/afile.txt and gksu gedit /location/to/afile.txt?\n\nDon't open gui application as root through sudo instead of sudo, you have to use gksu. gksu package is not installed by default, so run this command sudo apt-get install gksu to install gksu package.\n\nWhy don't people not use -y on the end of a command, like sudo apt-get programx -y?\n\nBecause people want apt-get to always propmt(ask for permission) before installing packages.\n\nHow can I unpack any .zip or .tar.gz file by Terminal?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*unzip filename.zip\n\n*tar -xzvf file.tar.gz\n", "Q: Can exim be configured to send all emails externally? How do I configure exim4 to route all emails via a third-party SMTP server when the sender's domain, recipient's domain, and server hostname all match?\nI followed this great answer and have exim4 sending emails to addresses at other domains tested and working from an Ubuntu server. My only issue is that emails where both the sender and recipient share the same domain as the server hostname, they never leave the server (and this is the expected behavior).\nFor example, sending from test@example.com --> test@example2.com works fine, but sending from account1@example.com --> account2@example.com just routes the mail locally to /var/mail/account2, without passing through the third-party SMTP server.\nI'm using Google Apps at my own domain and want to send emails from server@example.com to me@example.com from a machine with the hostname example.com.\nI want to route them through Google's SMTP server so I see them in my other email clients.

The route_list variable tells exim to push all mails of this router to the server SMARTHOST.\nYou should invest some time and read the fine exim manual. It will help with non-standard settings that are beyond what ubuntu's simplified configuration can do.\n\nA: If you followed the guide linked in my question you have about a dozen different 'routers' (simple text files) in /etc/exim4/conf.d/router/. The one to edit is  200_exim4-config-primary, like so:\nsudo nano /etc/exim4/conf.d/router/200_exim4-config_primary\nDown the bottom is a section 'smarthost:' that looks like this:\nsmarthost:\n  debug_print = \"R: smarthost for $local_part@$domain\"\n  driver = manualroute\n  domains = ! +local_domains\n  transport = remote_smtp_smarthost\n  route_list = * DCsmarthost byname\n  host_find_failed = defer\n  same_domain_copy_routing = yes\n  no_more\n\nRemove the exclamation point and a space from the 'domains' line so that it looks like this:\n  domains = +local_domains\n\nThat two-character edit was all it took to get everything working just now.

Follow the steps below to see if it works this time. First, let’s add the GNOME 3 PPA to Ubuntu’s Software Sources. This can be done using a GUI but it is far easier to achieve using the command line.\nOpen a new Terminal window and enter the following command, entering your user password when asked:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-next \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\n\nWith the PPA added and our package list updated we can move on to installing GNOME 3.10 itself. To do this run the following command, again entering your user password when prompted:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gnome-shell ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n\nIt can take a while for all the necessary packages and components to be fetched and installed, so try to be patient.\nMidway through the installation a prompt will appear in the Terminal asking you to choose what display manager – aka “login screen” – should be used by default.\nThis decision is entirely up to you; both Ubuntu’s Unity Greeter and the GNOME Display Manager let you easily switch between desktop sessions (handy if you want to keep Unity or another desktop around) but only GDM offers GNOME-specific features such as lock-screen notifications.\nWhen you’re ready to decide make your selection using the up/down arrow keys and hit ‘Enter/Return’ to confirm. The installation will then proceed.\nIf it does not work, run sudo apt-get -f install, then try the above commands again.\nIn case it does not work, install Ubuntu GNOME instead of Ubuntu. It is actually Ubuntu itself but with GNOME instead of Unity. It is also officially supported by Canonical. Note that this will erase all data from your existing Ubuntu installation.

(without using Startup Disk Creator)\n\nA: Support for 64-bit guests requires CPU virtualization support in the host, A.K.A. VT-x (or AMD-v). You need to verify that your CPU has this feature.\nNavigate to BIOS and enable it if it’s supported by your CPU, try to google your CPU Specs.\nConditions for running 64-bit guests on 32-bit hosts: \n\nVirtualBox supports 64-bit guest operating systems, even on 32-bit\n  host operating systems, provided that the following conditions are\n  met:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You need a 64-bit processor with hardware virtualization support (see Section 10.3, “Hardware vs. software virtualization”).\n  \n*You must enable hardware virtualization for the particular VM for which you want 64-bit support; software virtualization is not\n  supported for 64-bit VMs.\n  \n*If you want to use 64-bit guest support on a 32-bit host operating system, you must also select a 64-bit operating system for the\n  particular VM. Since supporting 64 bits on 32-bit hosts incurs\n  additional overhead, VirtualBox only enables this support upon\n  explicit request.\n  \n*On 64-bit hosts (which typically come with hardware virtualization support), 64-bit guest operating systems are always supported\n  regardless of settings, so you can simply install a 64-bit operating\n  system in the guest.\n  \n*Warning\nOn any host, you should enable the I/O APIC for virtual machines\n  that you intend to use in 64-bit mode. This is especially true for\n  64-bit Windows VMs. See Section 3.3.2, “\"Advanced\" tab”. In addition,\n  for 64-bit Windows guests, you should make sure that the VM uses the\n  Intel networking device, since there is no 64-bit driver support for\n  the AMD PCNet card; see Section 6.1, “Virtual networking hardware”.\n\n", "Q: Lexmark E240 printing issues I have Lexmark E240 laser printer.\nI have been using it with 12.04 (32bit) for 2 years with no significant issues.\nSince lexmark does not support this printer on linux, I used alternatives drivers that were suggested by the community, such as HP-lasterjet, E238, generic PS, etc.\nThey all worked fine, more or less.\nAfter upgrading to 14.04 (64bit fresh install) I tried to configure the printer as before, but now I have problems.\nThe test page is ok, but when printing, most of the times, the first page in the document will be printed very partially and in 300% zoom.

Does anyone know how I can rectify the problem of not being able to use my touch pad at all on my HP 255 G2?\nI am currently running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and have to use a USB mouse, which is tiresome when I am not at a desk.\n\nA: I have the same problem, but the touchpad works if I boot the laptop after disconnecting the power cable, unplugging the battery and waiting for a while. The touchpad stops working if I shut down the laptop, but works still after a reboot.\n\nA: I tried many other suggestions to get my touchpad and mouse buttons working, and nearly gave up. Then another issue led me to disable Secureboot, and suddenly Ubuntu recognised the trackpad and it started working.\nHowever, I think you may have to do this before installing the OS. As soon as the computer starts, press Escape (for me at least but might be F10 or F2). In the menu at the top, go to System Configuration, then look for Secure Boot and disable it, and/or enable Legacy support. See https://www.daossoft.com/bios-tips/how-to-disable-secure-boot-on-hp-laptop-ultrabook.html for more information.\n", "Q: Install second Ubuntu distribution on second drive I have Ubuntu 13.10 already installed on /dev/sda. Now I want to install version 14.04 on /dev/sdb (screenshots from GParted are pasted below).\nHow should I proceed?\n\n\n\nA: Just boot off a liveUSB or liveDVD, choose install, then something else option and then choose the correct drive where you want to install 14.04. Create a partition for Ubuntu, mount point \\ and a swap partition (at least the size of your RAM, better 2xRAM).\nKeep the boot loader on the disk where 13.10 is installed. It should detect the second Ubuntu instance and add it to the Grub menu.\n", "Q: Awk command to print all the lines except the last three lines I want to print all the lines except the last three lines from the input through awk only. Please note that my file contains n number of lines.\nFor example,\nfile.txt contains,\nfoo\nbar\nfoobar\nbarfoo\nlast\nline\n\nI want the output to be,\nfoo\nbar\nfoobar\n\nI know it could be possible through the combination of tac and sed or tac and awk \n$ tac file | sed '1,3d' | tac\nfoo\nbar\nfoobar\n\n$ tac file | awk 'NR==1{next}NR==2{next}NR==3{next}1' | tac\nfoo\nbar\nfoobar\n\nBut i want the output through awk only.\n\nA: For minimal memory usage, you could use a circular buffer:\nawk 'NR>n{print A[NR%n]} {A[NR%n]=$0}' n=3 file\n\nBy using the mod operator on line numbers we have at most n array entries.\nTaking the example of n=3:\nOn line 1 NR%n equals 1, line 2 produces 2 and line 3 produces 0 and line 4 evaluates to 1 again.. \nLine 1 -> A[1]\nLine 2 -> A[2]\nLine 3 -> A[0]\nLine 4 -> A[1]\nLine 5 -> A[2]\n...\n\nWhen we get to line 4, A[NR%n] contains the content of line 1. So that gets printed and A[NR%n] gets the content of line 4. The next line (line 5) the original content of line 2 gets printed and so on, until we get to the end. What remains unprinted is the content of the buffer, which contains the last 3 lines...\n\nA: You can also process the file twice to avoid keeping anything in memory:\nawk '{if(NR==FNR){c++}else if(FNR<=c-3){print}}' file file\n\nThe trick here is the NR==FNR test. NR is the current line number and FNR is the current line number of the current file. If more than one file is passed as input, FNR will be equal to NR only while the first file is being processed. This way, we quickly get the number of lines in the first file and save it as c. Since the \"two\" files are actually the same one, we now know the number of lines we want so we only print if this is one of them.\nWhile you might think this will be slower than the other approaches, it is actually faster since there is next to no processing going on. Everything is done using internal awk tools (NR and FNR) apart from a single arithmetic comparison. I tested on a 50MB file with one million lines created with this command:\nfor i in {500000..1000000}; do \n    echo \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog $i\" >> file; \ndone\n\nAs you can see, the times are almost identical but the approach I provided here is marginally faster Oli's first suggestion (but slower than the others):\n$ for i in {1..10}; do ( \n    time awk '{if(NR==FNR){c++}else if(FNR<=c-3){print}}' file file > /dev/null ) 2>&1 | \n       grep -oP 'real.*?m\\K[\\d\\.]+'; \n  done | awk '{k+=$1}END{print k/10\" seconds\"}'; \n0.4757 seconds\n\n$  for i in {1..10}; do ( \n    time awk '{l[NR] = $0} END {for (i=1; i<=NR-3; i++) print l[i]}' file > /dev/null ) 2>&1 | \n        grep -oP 'real.*?m\\K[\\d\\.]+'; \n   done | awk '{k+=$1}END{print k/10\" seconds\"}'; \n0.5347 seconds\n\n\nA: I know the question was specifically about awk, but for brevity one could always use:\nhead -n -3\n\n\nA: It's ever-so clunky but you can add every line to an array and at the end —when you know the length— output everything but the last 3 lines.\n... | awk '{l[NR] = $0} END {for (i=1; i<=NR-3; i++) print l[i]}'\n\nAnother (more efficient here) approach is manually stacking in three variables:\n... | awk '{if (a) print a; a=b; b=c; c=$0}'\n\na only prints after a line has moved from c to b and then into a so this limits it to three lines. The immediate upsides are it doesn't store all the content in memory and it shouldn't cause buffering issues (fflush() after printing if it does) but the downside here is it's not simple to scale this up. If you want to skip the last 100 lines, you need 100 variables and 100 variable juggles.\nIf awk had push and pop operators for arrays, it would be easier.\nOr we could pre-calculate the number of lines and how far we actually want to go with $(($(wc -l < file) - 3)). This is relatively useless for streamed content but on a file, works pretty well:\nawk -v n=$(($(wc -l < file) - 3)) 'NR<n' file\n\nTypically speaking you'd just use head though:\n$ seq 6 | head -n-3\n1\n2\n3\n\n\nUsing terdon's benchmark we can actually see how these compare. I thought I'd offer a full comparison though:\n\n\n*\n\n*head: 0.018s (me)\n\n*awk + wc: 0.169s (me)\n\n*awk 3 variables: 0.178s (me)\n\n*awk double-file: 0.322s (terdon)\n\n*awk circular buffer: 0.355s (Scrutinizer)\n\n*awk for-loop: 0.693s (me)\n\n\nThe fastest solution is using a C-optimised utility like head or wc handle the heavy lifting things but in pure awk, the manually rotating stack is king for now.\n", "Q: Application stuck in TCP retransmit I am running Linux kernel 3.13 (Ubuntu 14.04) on two Virtual Machines each of which operates inside two different servers running ESXi 5.1.  There is a zeromq client-server application running between the two VMs.  After running for about 10-30 minutes, this application consistently hangs due to inability to retransmit a lost packet.\nWhen I run the same setup over Ubuntu 12.04 (Linux 3.11), the application never fails (UPDATE : Also fails on 12.04 but takes longer)\nIf you notice below, \"ss\" (socket statistics) shows 1 packet lost, sk_wmem_queued of 14110 (i.e. w14110) and a high rto (120000).  \nState      Recv-Q Send-Q                                      Local Address:Port                                          Peer Address:Port\n\nESTAB      0      **12350**                                       192.168.2.122:41808                                        192.168.2.172:55550    \n\ntimer:(on,16sec,10) uid:1000 ino:35042 \n\nsk:ffff880035bcb100 <->\n         skmem:(r0,rb648720,t0,tb1164800,f2274,**w14110**,o0,bl0) ts sack cubic wscale:7,7 rto:120000 rtt:7.5/3 ato:40 mss:8948 cwnd:1 ssthresh:21 send 9.5Mbps **unacked:1 retrans:1/10 lost:1** rcv_rtt:1476 rcv_space:37621\n\nSince this has happened so consistently, I was able to capture the TCP log in wireshark.  I found that the packet which is lost does get retransmitted and even acknowledged by the TCP in the other OS (the sequence number is seen in the ACK), but the sender doesn't seem to understand this ACK and continues retransmitting. \nMTU is 9000 on both virtual machines and througout the route.  The packets being sent are large in size.\nAs I said earlier, this does not happen on Ubuntu 12.04 (kernel 3.11).  So I did a diff on the TCP config options (seen via \"sysctl -a |grep tcp \") between 14.04 and 12.04 and found the following differences.\nI also noticed that net.ipv4.tcp_mtu_probing=0 in both configurations.\nLeft side is 3.11, right side is 3.13\n<<net.ipv4.tcp_abc = 0\n<<net.ipv4.tcp_cookie_size = 0\n<<net.ipv4.tcp_dma_copybreak = 4096\n\n14c11\n<< net.ipv4.tcp_early_retrans = 2\n---\n>> net.ipv4.tcp_early_retrans = 3\n\n17c14\n<< net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen = 0\n>> net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen = 1\n\n20d16\n<< net.ipv4.tcp_frto_response = 0\n26,27c22\n<< net.ipv4.tcp_max_orphans = 16384\n<< net.ipv4.tcp_max_ssthresh = 0\n\n>> net.ipv4.tcp_max_orphans = 4096\n29,30c24,25\n<< net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets = 16384\n<< net.ipv4.tcp_mem = 94377 125837  188754\n\n>> net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets = 4096\n>> net.ipv4.tcp_mem = 23352 31138   46704\n34a30\n>> net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat = -1\n\nMy question to the networking experts on this forum : Are there any other debugging tools or options I can install/enable to dig further into why this TCP retransmit failure is occurring so consistently ?  Are there any configuration changes which might account for this weird behaviour.  \nUPDATE (for those who may hit a similar problem later):  I was able to reproduce the problem on 3.11 as well and was then able to evade this problem by lowering the MTU.  \nA similar problem has been reported here https://serverfault.com/questions/488893/how-do-i-prevent-tcp-connection-freezes-over-an-openvpn-network.  The description given there matches what I saw : \n\n\"At some point with the Ubuntu clients, though, the remote end starts\n  retransmitting the same TCP segment over and over (with the transmit\n  delay increasing between each retransmission). The client sends what\n  looks like a valid TCP ACK to each retransmission, but the remote end\n  still continues to transmit the same TCP segment periodically.\"\n\nMaybe related article : https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/unseenit/2013/10/18/stalled-scp-and-hanging-tcp-connections/\n\nA: He we noticed the same problem: Linux 3.2 kernel on Ubuntu 12.04 worked without any problems, Linux 3.13 on Ubuntu 14.02 had the same problem.\nI am not sure if this is really a bug in the kernel, to me it looks more like a problem with selective ACKs (SACK). You can workaround the problem by disabling TCP SACK with:\nsysctl net.ipv4.tcp_sack=0\n\nThis worked around the problem. In our case it was happening that clients with lossy or far-away connections (e.g., different data centers, DSL lines) were no longer be able to download large files. After approx a few megabytes downloading the HTTP connection stalled. TCDump showed a lot of selective ACKS (SACKs) transmitted.\nAnd yes, booting the 12.04 kernel in 14.04 helped, too.\nI think we should open an issue in Ubuntu. I was just not sure if the problem only happens because of our network/router hardware, but it seems to generally a problem that TCP SACK is wrong.\n", "Q: Lenovo G500 how do I turn off secure boot to install Ubuntu 14.04?

Current bug status is:status:CONFIRMEDPatch released, waiting for test/merge!importance:MEDIUMassigned to:UNASSIGNED\nThrough a chat with OP and corroboration from the Ubuntu Linux developers, this problem is a bug. As such, unless a member on AU is an official kernel developer (Jon Skeet maybe?), this bug can not be solved.\nI think that this should be reported in the proper area, which is here.\nFor the bug title, place the name of the kernel module (sony-laptop) and a brief description of the bug (\"Laptop Keyboard Backlight not turning off\")\nFor the content, describe the bug in its entirety. Describe what works and what doesn't. Also include the following resources:\n\n*\n\n*This page. It contains information on what you tried so far.\n\n*The chat. This contains debugging info and some more things tried. The devs can sort through this.\n\n*The Patch(es). If a patch can be found (it was in this situation),  make sure to include it. It will save the devs TONS of time. And, your bug gets solved faster.\n\nAlso, bugs are (usually) handled in order of importance. Make your bug sound important, but don't exaggerate.\nWhen your bug is solved, BE HAPPY! You just made it into the Official Linux Kernel changelog!\nAlso: Make sure to follow any instructions on the bug reporting page. The more stuff you give the devs, the easier their jobs are, and the faster your bug is solved.\nOld Post:\nTry downloading the Vaio Control Center from SourceForge.\nTo install it, run the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*cd ~/Downloads\n\n*mkdir ~/.VCC\n\n*mv vaio-control-center-0.1.tar.bz2 ~/.VCC\n\n*cd ~/.VCC\n\n*tar -xjvf vaio-control-center-0.1.tar.bz2\n\n*make -j12\n\n*chmod +x vaio-control-center\n\n*./vaio-control-center\nIf you want, you can create a link to the control center onto your desktop. Simply make a .desktop entry pointing to ~/.VCC/vaio-control-center.\nOnce you are in the app, look for a backlight options menu and try adjusting that.\nNote: For this to work, you MUST have QT Core and QT Dev installed!\nEdit (inspired by comment by MGodby): Make sure you have qt4-qmake installed. Also make sure that the conf-file is in /usr/share/qt/mkspecs/linux-g++-64/qmake.conf.

I hope you are informed that even if you put /home on your modern SSD, that drive will last for at least 10-12 years?\nCommon, be a man and put everything on your SSD! Mount your HDD as /archive for porn, and mount /tmp into RAM to boost performance even further. Get rid of swap partition as well!

Like, \nvinagre --connect 1\n\nConnecting computers by their predefined IDs or something like that. \nIs that possible? \n\nA: You can edit you /etc/hosts and add some name and ip for each pc you will yo connect.\nExample\ncommand is:\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n\nAt the end of file add you hosts\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n127.0.1.1       xxx.xxx.xxx        xxx\n\n# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts\n::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nfe00::0 ip6-localnet\nff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n\n# At the end of file add you local pc's\nxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx    nice_blond\nxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx    nice_body\nxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx    just_nice\n\nAfter this you will can connect to \"nice_body\"\nvinagre just_nice\n\n", "Q: Security risk for making the sudo password timeout infinite? I recently changed my sudo password timeout (the amount of time that passes before sudo asks you for your password again). It defaults to 15 minutes; I raised that to an hour with sudo visudo and  changing Defaults    env_reset,timestamp_timeout=60. You can make sudo never ask for a password again, however, by setting it to -1.\nWhile I have a feeling that every admin under the sun will tell me this is a bad idea, I'm wondering what the specific security risks are. If someone is logged in as me, don't they already have my password? What specific scenario will having a non-infinite password timeout protect me from?\nMy Ubuntu box runs a web server exposed to the public.\n\nA: The sudo timeouts apply only to the current shell session. Try this:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal  \n\n*Run sudo ls. You will be asked for a password   \n\n*Run sudo ls again. You will not be asked for a password because the timeout hasn't yet expired    \n\n*Open another terminal window  \n\n*Run sudo ls in the new terminal. You will be asked for your password even though the timeout for the first session hasn't expired yet.\n\n\nYour biggest risk of long sudo timeout is if you use sudo and then go for a coffee someone might reuse your sudo capabilities while you are away.\n\nA: This question is old, but I believe that the accepted answer lacks an important consideration. Depending on your usage, having a sudo timeout other than 0 can be dangerous:\nLet's say you type a command with sudo. Then sometimes later, you use package managers like Pip for Python or NPM for Node to install new software or dependencies for your projects. Well, if your sudo timeout hasn't expired, then anything in these package will be able to execute a command as sudo.\nIt can also happen with code pasted from the internet, as demonstrated here:\nhttps://martin-ueding.de/posts/the-dangers-of-sudo-timeout/\n", "Q: accessing ubuntu after downloading it I've downloaded ubuntu desktop 14.04, but where is it?

Now the only problem that remains is that I can't access internet from it.\n\nA: You entered the same IP address as the server's address and your gateway. That's probably wrong and if your router's/gateway's IP address is really 10.1.1.1 you now have two devices with the same IP address in your net segment.\nI suppose you want to change the server's IP to 10.1.1.2 or 10.1.1.10, depending on your network plan, leaving the address of the gateway to 10.1.1.1\nAlso, a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 seems to be horribly, unnecessary big. It's not really a problem, but in the long run you can run into problems with that setting, e.g. if you want to set up some kind of routed VPN. You probably want it to be 255.255.255.0. Check the subnet mast settings on your gateway and set the same on your server.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my ubuntu server, i can ping the gateway but not internet.\nI solved the problem like this:\n-sudo systemctl restart networking \n", "Q: Could not find required OpenGL entry point 'glGetError' I am not able to play \"Half-Life-2\" on Steam + Ubuntu 14.04 .\nError shown in message box on screen:\n    Could not find required OpenGL entry pint 'glGetError'!

I have a program called synergy which is for using 1 mouse and 1 keyboard across many computers, using a local network.\nYou can set it up to have your screens next to each other like so:\n\nHowever, (because this is the free version), I can't drag and drop files between them. So this dock is set up between the two screens, and when I drag a file I can drop it there - and it copies it to the same path on the second computer (if it exists) or to the misc folder.\n\nA: With a little reaserch, I found out what you may be looking for.

Here %u is the path of the file which you will be dragging on the .desktop file to trigger the script. This will obviously be passed as an argument to your script. \nDon't forget to make your .desktop  executable as well by:\nchmod u+x test.desktop\n\nTo check if it is working you can point it to this script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\necho $1 > ~/out.txt\n\nYou will see the full path of the file which you dragged onto your .desktop file stored in out.txt in you home directory.\nFinally, you can set up a dock to have just this in it, so you have it at the side of the screen.\nReferences:\nDesktop Entry Specification\nGnome Developer - Desktop Files\n\nA: For those who didn't liked the dock solution can simply make use of Nautilus environment variable NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS or $@.Write a script, place it in the scripts folder so it will appear in context menu. The advantage is that you can select more files at once. To test it:\n#!/bin/bash\nnotify-send $NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS\nexit 0\n\n", "Q: Identify X libs during installation from source without sudo I am trying to install a program (HTK) from source, but after ./configure (which doesn't give errors), make all complains that /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lX11.

In the boot screen (grub) I edited the boot line to add the nomodeset setting to disable KMS and be able to boot. But it has an impact on the Nouveau driver which cannot use the full resolution. I decided to install the Nvidia binary drivers instead.\nTo edit the boot in order to solve your issue, when you see Grub, hit the \"E\" key on your computer. You will then be able to edit the boot commands. Then use the arrow key to look for a line starting with linux /boot (...) go to the end of the line (there should be the keyword splash written) and add the option mentionned above. By pressing the keyboard combination of \"Ctrl\"+\"X\" the system should use your custom boot and it should hopefully work.\nOnce you boot, update /etc/default/grub and modify the following line as suggested below (by adding the above option):\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\n\nSave your changes and now \"install\" tre new Grub configuration by issueing the following command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nBackground info:\nI was never really interested in KMS, as previously I always had Intel GPU, so it was just working. But I think you don't loose much without KMS, it removes the \"screen flickering\" upon boot and maybe a few more seconds boot duration. It should have no other impact AFAIR but for the Nouveau driver it basically disable it as well.\nBtw and off topic:\nI haven't benchmarked the SAS RAID controller integrated to the motherboard, but I would doubt it brings much benefits. I have not configured any RAID using the SAS controller, but I have used Linux software RAID for the boot and swap partitions, and BTRFS for the rest (although I would advise you to use Linux software RAID for the rest as well given BTRFS maturity).\nLinux software RAID is really performant and flexible, you can define RAID per partition (so having a RAID1 for /boot and / but RAID 0 for swap and /tmp and /var/tmp). The only drawback compare to a real RAID card is the high-end one would have a battery backed controller (which is not the case of your on-board SAS controller).\nI am still struggling with my configuration, I decided to plug the HDD to the SATA and not SAS controller. When plugged to the SAS controller the 2 HDD are \"named\" sdc and sdd because the USB live CD is seen as sda and I have a USB card reader which takes the sdb. The problem is when I remove the USB disk, the letter of the drives changes (to sdb and sdc) and this does not play well with the default Fedora grub installation (which already did not like too much that I put the / under btrfs...). By putting the HDD on the SATA controller, they are \"registered\" before the USB or SAS devices, so they get sda and sdb naming and it does not change on reboot. I know that one can use UUID and labels for identifying drives, but I had no desire to fix the default grub configuration.\nOther Linux:\nI tried just out of curiosity 2 other Linux distributions (just as Live USB). Ubuntu 14.04.1 booted fine with the nouveau driver but ArchLinux 20140801 showed a black screen after the Grub prompt and it was stuck in this mode. It is my first time with a Nvidia card on Linux, and this is shitty!!

I think it's a WordPress vulnerability they're looking for. Obviously they are not successful (I don't even have Wordpress on my server), but it's annoying and probably resource consuming as well. I am trying to write a bash script that will do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search the apache logs and grab the offending IP's (even if they try it once), \n\n*Sort them into a list with each unique IP on a seperate line,\n\n*And then block them using the IP table rules. \n\n\nI am a bash newb, and so far my script does everything except Step 3. I can manually block the IP's, but that's tedious and besides, this is Linux and it's perfectly capable of doing it for me. I also want the script to be customizable so that I (or anyone else who wants to use it) can change the variables to suit whatever situation I/they may deal with in the future. Here is the script so far:\n#!/bin/bash\n##IP LIST GENERATOR\n##Author Chev Young\n##Script to search Apache logs and list IP's based on custom filters\n##\n##Define our variables:\nDIRECT=~/Script ##Location of script&where to put results/temp files\nLOGFILE=/var/log/apache2/access.log ## Logfile to search for offenders\nTEMPLIST=xml_temp ## Temporary file name\nIP_LIST=ipstoban ## Name of results file\nFILTER1=xmlrpc ## What are we looking for? (Requests we want to ban)\ncd $DIRECT\nif [ ! -f $TEMPLIST ];then touch $TEMPLIST ##Create temp file\nfi\ncat $LOGFILE | grep $FILTER1 >> $DIRECT/$TEMPLIST ## Only interested in the IP's, so:\nsed -e 's/\\([0-9]\\+\\.[0-9]\\+\\.[0-9]\\+\\.[0-9]\\+\\).*$/\\1/' -e t -e d $DIRECT/$TEMPLIST | sort | uniq > $DIRECT/$IP_LIST\nrm $TEMPLIST ## Clean temp file\necho \"Done. Results located at $DIRECT/$IP_LIST\"\n\nSo I need help with the next part of the script, which should ban the IP's (incoming and perhaps outgoing too) from the resulting $IP_LIST file. I don't care if it utilizes UFW or IPTables directly, as long as it bans the IP's. I'd probably run it as a cron task. What I'm having trouble with is understanding how to use line of the result file as a seperate variable to do something like:\nufw deny $IP1 $IP2 $IP3, ect\nAny ideas? Thanks.\n\nA: If you properly install fail2ban there's little need for the script above. Soon as the attacker attempts n times again they'll be banned for whatever time you set in the config.\n", "Q: Trouble Adding Basic Lock Screen in Lubuntu 14 Alright, I'm running the latest version of Lubuntu on my system, Lubuntu 14, and some strange things have been happening when trying to set up a lock screen.\nSince I use a laptop, all I want to do is make it so that the system asks for a password if I 1.) Hit the windows key + L, 2.) manually lock the screen, or 3.) fold the laptop. I've tried doing this all through the light locker settings in the preferences category. \nHowever, whenever I set the option, other things happen. \nFirst, while I was successful in being able to lock my screen through the log-out prompt, after I get done doing the other tasks the computer display won't turn back on. The power button is still glowing, but I have to do a forced shut-down since no keyboard input affects anything. \nSecondly, in response to that, I went back to light locker settings and disabled the shut-off display option, but then when I tried locking the screen again, the computer shut off on its own. \nSo what's going on here? Again, my only desires are a password prompt under the conditions listed above. \nNOTE: I've discovered that if I close the lid for a prolonged time, it'll then go into the lock screen as I desire. I don't know why, though. The time it takes seems arbitrary, for if I leave the lid down for a few seconds the lock-screen won't activate. It's most desirable for me to be able to do it immediately on command.\n\nA: Try setting your options under the Xfce Power Manager.  You can reach it from the Main Menu->Preferences->Power Manager  or right clicking the little battery icon on the LXPanel and choosing Preferences.\n", "Q: Revert permission of /usr back to root I was doing some alterations but in one I messed up.\nI changed the permissions of almost everything inside the /usr folder to my own user.

You created a file which you called toe.ccp, however what you want is a file that is toe.cpp (Two p's, not two c's in your file extension). Renaming the file will cause g++ to work correctly.\nIn case you are unfamiliar with how to do so on the command line, you can do\nmv toe.ccp toe.cpp\n\nin the terminal to rename the file. Then try compiling it with g++, it should now work.\n\nA: You should use the correct file extension for the program. toe.ccp is not recognized by GCC as a source file format because of the file extension, so it doesn't know what to do with it. You probably meant to save your file as toe.cpp instead.\nAs shown in the GCC user manual section on input file names, there are a predefined list of file extensions for each recognized programming language. C++ source files can end in .cc, .cp, .cxx, .cpp, .CPP, .c++, or .C.\n", "Q: Can xdotool position the mouse relative to current location?

The BOOT partition likely contains the boot files, the HP_TOOLS likely contains HP QuickWeb (or other tools), and the HOME partition seems to be your main Ubuntu partition.\nNote that it is only safe to remove the HP_TOOLS partition, since you need the BOOT partition to boot up your computer.

First find out your interface name, to make sure there isn't eth1 already in use somewhere. To do so type this into a terminal: \nifconfig -a\n\nYou will definitely have one loopback interface called 'lo' with the IPaddress 127.0.0.1. This is not the interface you are looking for. Look at the other one that has a name like eth1 to see if it exists. If it does, then.. well Don't do anything more.

See screenshot. This only happens once in ten times.\nI haven't seen this happen in other terminals. What's going on?\n\n\nA: It is a bug in your Python code. The characters are all Unicode 001B, U+001B is the escape character. Your terminal is rendering it as a box with 001B inside. Your Python program is printing escape characters to the terminal, which is interpreting them as Unicode characters. You can reproduce this easily:\n$ python\nPython 2.7.7rc1 (default, May 21 2014, 11:15:30) \n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> print chr(0x001b)\n\n", "Q: Did they just remove the Background settings for Terminal? About 10 minutes ago I set up my basic Terminal app to be semi-transparent and was really happy with the result. Now, some updates ran and the whole \"Background\" tab is gone from Terminal settings. Was this option removed? If yes, why? Why would anyone do that?\nI'm running gnome-terminal 3.10.2 from the Gnome3 ppa.\n\nA: Standard versions of Ubuntu use gnome-terminal 3.6.2. The background tab was removed in version 3.7. The ppa, as you saw, provides version 3.10.\nYou have a couple choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purge the ppa, then run an update and an upgrade to restore the standard packages. The trade-off is that you will lose the other features of Gnome 3.10 that you may want.\n\n*Follow the instructions at How can I make the terminal transparent? to emulate the feature in 3.10 (quoted below):\n\nSince version 3.7 this option has been removed from the Preferences dialogue. You can however still get the same effect by setting the _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY X property, for example with the Devil's Pie or Devil's Pie II tools. E.g., set up Devil's Pie to start automatically with the session, and create the file ~/.devilspie/gnome-terminal.ds with these contents: \n\n\n(if\n(matches (window_name) \"gnome-terminal-window-*\") \n(opacity 90) \n)\nYou can also use this shell script that however only works for existing terminal windows and not automatically for newly created ones. \n\n\nA: Vivid 15.04 brings back the transparency option. (It's not part of mainstream gnome-terminal, but Ubuntu applies a patch to bring it back.)\nOn the other hand, background image support is gone for good.\n\nA: The transparency feature was indeed removed from the recent versions of the Gnome Terminal. As noted in the other answers, you could use Devil's Pie program to make any window transparent (and more).\nHere's how to set this up in Devils Pie 2 (it uses Lua, so scripts for the original Devil's Pie are not compatible with this version). I'm using Debian Buster, but it should work the same in Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Devil's Pie 2 right from the official repo: sudo apt install devilspie2.\n\n*Create the ~/.config/devilspie2/gnome-terminal.lua with the following contents:\nif (get_window_name()==\"Terminal\") then\n  set_window_opacity(0.9);\nend\n\n\n*Create the ~/.config/autostart/devilspie.desktop file, which something like this inside:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=\"devilspie\"\nGenericName=\"devilspie\"\nComment=\"The Devil Spy 2 script\"\nExec=/usr/bin/devilspie2\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nX-Gnome-Autostart=true\n\n\n*Logout and login again or just reboot. All set!\n\n\nIn the Lua script, you could tweak the set_window_opacity(0.9); setting, 0.9\n means that the window will be 90% opaque.\nYou can also add any other command which Devil's Pie 2 supports. The list could be found here.\n\nA: Answer the question why, from this bug:\nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=695371\n\nPersch didn’t like it.

However I will assume that if you buy a second hard drive, it will have at least the same capacity as your actual drive.\nIf you are going to switch from a one-drive to a two-drives configuration, I suggest the following (AKA Long answer):\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy your shared storage partition on the external drive using your favourite tool (KDE Partition Manager might already be installed on your Kubuntu system). Do not make the partition fill the disk: keep enough space after the partition for the next step. I suggest that this space equals the sum of the size of your system partitions; you will be able to change it later if necessary.\n\n*As it has already been suggested, make backups for both of your systems, either by keeping only data and settings (fast) or cloning and compressing the full partition image (slow). You might want to look here for more details.\n\n*Once you've made sure your shared storage partition has made it safely to the new drive (have a look inside to be sure), you may remove it from the first drive by deleting the corresponding partition.\n\n*Expand and rearrange the partitions for your systems on the first drive if desired. However, be very careful not to move the starting point of the Windows partition, since that might break the bootloader (it can be fixed but avoiding it is safer).\n\n*Make sure both systems recognize the partition and set the new partition to mount automatically on startup (you probably did that before with your current setup).\n\n\nIf there is anything else left broken, try to fix it or leave a comment here so we can help you complete the transition. I hope this method works for you.\n", "Q: ubuntu 14 painfully slow on dell r200 I didn't notice it at first. The machines (there is 20 plus) are to be used a simple file servers.

When we used the recovery kernel it was nice and fast, but it only recognised 1GB of memory. After compiling many many kernels and trying all sorts of things we eventually struck on the real problem: There is a bug in some intel chipsets where a piece of very slow memory right at the top isn't correctly mapped, and of course this is where the kernel is loaded, so the slowness was because the kernel was loaded into very slow ram.\nThe fix was to pass the mem= boot parameter and sacrifice a 100MB or RAM right at the top. This was also why the recovery kernel worked so well, it loaded the kernel below 1GB instead and avoided this block of memory.\n", "Q: Dual booting Windows 7/Ubuntu and partitioning on a 220GB SSD / 1TB HDD I am not a technical user and am not familiar with any of these linux/unix/ubuntu terms - I'm looking for an easy to follow, non-technical guide for setting up my system - please tell it to me like I'm a fifth grader.\nI currently have an Asus G75VX equipped with a 250gb SSD and a 1TB HDD.\nMy OS right now is Windows 7, and I'm looking to dual boot with Ubuntu so that all of my important applications/files are located on the SSD and the more long-term storage files are located on the HDD.\n\nA: Ubuntu Installer can handle this situation pretty easily.

Nano Transceiver v1.0 for Bluetooth\n\nThe device has been paired, and with the help of blueman, I've connected it to PulseAudio as a sink. Audio does come across in A2DP mode, but is terribly choppy and skips to the point of being not much better than nothing.\nI read around and saw that there was a fix involving adjusting the nice priority of the PulseAudio server. Since by default, PulseAudio runs on a per-user basis, I added the following to my /etc/security/limits.conf:\n*       hard    rtpio   0\n*       soft    rtpio   0\n@audio  hard    rtpio   20\n@audio  soft    rtpio   20\npulse   hard    rtpio   20\npulse   soft    rtpio   20\n\nI then added myself to the audio group to be able to schedule priority for the pulseaudio process. It seems that pulseaudio is now running with a priority of -11:\nps -eo pri,ni,cmd | grep [p]ulse\n30 -11 /usr/bin/pulseaudio --start --log-target=syslog\n\nThis should mean that PulseAudio is running with a priority of -11, which is good. \nHowever, even after restarting, I still get the terrible choppy audio. \nHow should I proceed? I'm trying to make this Bluetooth headset I purchased usable. \nNote: I've tried pairing this device with an Android tablet right next to my laptop and it works fine, so it's not wireless congestion, it seems to be directly correlated to Linux somehow.\n\nA: Chris_128 answer worked for me but for newbies I'll add a bit detail.\nFor the NAME and PORT for the command below:\npactl set-port-latency-offset NAME PORT 50000 \n\nYou will get it after you have result from typing:\npactl list | grep -Pzo '.*bluez_card(.*\\n)*'\n\n\nName: bluez_card.5C_FB_7C_0D_0F_EE\nDriver: module-bluez5-device.c\nOwner Module: 28\nProperties:\n    ...\nProfiles:\n    headset_head_unit: Headset Head Unit (HSP/HFP) (sinks: 1, sources: 1, priority: 30, available: yes)\n    a2dp_sink: High Fidelity Playback (A2DP Sink) (sinks: 1, sources: 0, priority: 40, available: yes)\n    off: Off (sinks: 0, sources: 0, priority: 0, available: yes)\nActive Profile: a2dp_sink\nPorts:\n    headset-output: Headset (priority: 0, latency offset: 0 usec, available)\n        Part of profile(s): headset_head_unit, a2dp_sink\n    headset-input: Headset (priority: 0, latency offset: 0 usec)\n        Part of profile(s): headset_head_unit\n\nThe NAME will be \"bluez_card.5C_FB_7C_0D_0F_EE\" and the PORT will be \"headset-output\"\nSo for my case my command is \n\"pactl set-port-latency-offset bluez_card.5C_FB_7C_0D_0F_EE headset-output 50000\"\n\nRestart your bluetooth service\nsudo service bluetooth restart\n\n\nA: Had the same issue with Ubuntu 18.04 running as dual boot in MacBook Mini.\nTried changing the ALSA configuration as mentioned by @ConfirmAndCreateThisAccount.\nBut it didn't work.\nSo i installed Blueman using the below command\nsudo apt-get install blueman\n\nThen i disconnected the bluetooth device from the system bluetooth settings & re-paired using Blueman. Now everything is fine.\nEven the Play/Pause controls work.\n\nA: Edit the ALSA configuration file\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\nAdd the line\noptions snd-hda-intel model=generic\n\nto the end of the file, and restart the bluetooth service:\nsudo service bluetooth restart\n\n\nA: The fix worked for me, although I did find that I had to REM the line before it. \nSee below:\n# Keep snd-usb-audio from beeing loaded as first soundcard  \n# options snd-usb-audio index=-2  <-REM this line if it doesn't work at first  \noptions snd-hda-intel model=generic\n\n\nA: You can open the search bar (CTRL-D in unity, Windows-Key in Gnome) type in \"Pulse\" or \"Volume\".  Open the GUI tool \"Pulseaudio Volume Control\", its icon looks like   knob or gauge.\nThere you can select your Bluetooth speaker. Click on Advanced, set the Latency value just like proposed in the other answers . 45 ms or 50 ms seems to work for them, but I haven't found a good value that works for me.\nA screenshot is attached. My Bluetooth Speaker is called SRS-BTX300. You don't need to restart bluetooth after changing the latency value.\n\n\nA: As none of the other answers worked on my system (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on a 2012 MacBook Air), I found my solution on the german ubuntuusers wiki. English summary of the german instructions:\nThe choppy output might be caused by the A2DP implementation, and how it buffers sound before encoding it. For me, changing this buffer's size solved the choppy sound problem. You need to perform three steps:\n\n*\n\n*Find necessary info about the bluetooth device (while it is connected!)\npactl list | grep -Pzo '.*bluez_card(.*\\n)*'\n\nThe output should be something like\n    Name: bluez_card.28_11_A5_84_B6_F9\n    Driver: module-bluez5-device.c\n    ...\n    Ports:\n    speaker-output: Speaker (priority: 0, latency offset: 0 usec, available)\n        Part of profile(s): a2dp_sink, headset_head_unit\n    speaker-input: Bluetooth Input (priority: 0, latency offset: 0 usec, not available)\n        Part of profile(s): headset_head_unit\n\nWe see that the buffers have currently 0 latency. In the next step, you will need the NAME and PORT of your output. In this example, these are bluez_card.28_11_A5_84_B6_F9 and speaker-output, respectively.\n\n\n*Set the buffer size (latency) of your card to a suitable value with this command pattern:\npactl set-port-latency-offset <NAME> <PORT> <BUFFER_SIZE_MICROSECONDS> \n\nThe latency unit of the following command is microseconds, so I'm using a 50 millisecond buffer for my command here:\n    pactl set-port-latency-offset bluez_card.28_11_A5_84_B6_F9 speaker-output 50000 \n\n\n\n*Restart your bluetooth service to apply your change\nsudo service bluetooth restart\n\nAs there is usually no documentation about this, you may have to experiment with higher or lower buffer values. Many people people posted their working latencies in the comments to this answer. Check them out for guidance on the latency value.\n\nA: I solved my problem by changing the wifi connection I am using from using the 2.4 ghz connection (same as bluetooth) to a 5 ghz connection.

After I installed and booted up every thing works till I login. When I login the screen goes blury where I cant see anything. The Compaq model # SR5703wm and it has on board nvida driver. \n\nA: I have had serious problems with NVIDIA cards and Compaq machines running Linux. In my case, the default open source Ubuntu driver for NVIDIA (called Nouvea or something) was not compatable. If you can log in and open a terminal (ctrl+alt+t) and type xrandr -s 640x480 before it crashes on you, then you may be able to try running the 'additonal drivers' tool. If not...\nTry this: The second you log in, press ctrl+alt+F1 which will bring you to tty1. Login with your username and password and try install the NVIDIA drivers:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nand when that is done, type sudo reboot and hopefully the new driver will fix the problem. If you can't even get far enough to do that, than you'll have to boot into recovery with networking and install the NVIDIA driver. If you need help with that let me know. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Installing GHC 7.8.2 on Ubuntu 13.04 First: Yes, I really do mean to install install just GHC, and not the Haskell Platform.

So don't use them any more. Instead, you can use GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE.\nAccording to info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration', you have this:\n'GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE'\n\n If this option is unset or set to 'menu', then GRUB will display\n the menu and then wait for the timeout set by 'GRUB_TIMEOUT' to\n expire before booting the default entry.

To get things sorted out, I just removed that PPA from my system, and installed the version of Git from the main repository:\n# apt-add-repository --remove ppa:pdoes/ppa\n# apt-get update && apt-get install git -y\n# apt-cache policy git\ngit:\n  Installed: 1:1.7.9.5-1\n  Candidate: 1:1.7.9.5-1\n  Version table:\n *** 1:1.7.9.5-1 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nObviously that's an older version of Git, but it's still perfectly acceptable for my needs. And then after that, I was able to run apt-get dist-upgrade with no problems.\n\nA: git, git-core, and git-man are the relevant packages here.\nIn the packaging, git-man and git-core are declared as architecture-independent packages, meaning that these packages can be built once and used on any architecture. git, on the other hand, has to be built for each architecture (there are executable files in the package, after all).\nWhat happened most likely here is that when you/the computer ran sudo apt-get update, the architecture-independent packages were built (they are built with the i386 binaries), while the architecture-dependent packages weren't built yet. Assuming you are on amd64, this would mean that there is a newer version of git-core and git-man, but not git. Because of the nature of the dependencies specified, you can't have mismatching versions of the three packages. Therefore, apt decides to upgrade git-man and remove git and git-core.\nThe solution is just to wait an hour or two and run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade again, or (if you really want to/need top upgrade right now) run sudo apt-get upgrade, which will upgrade as many packages as possible without removing packages.\nEdit: The PPA being used here (https://launchpad.net/~pdoes/+archive/ppa) has a Breaks condition (at least in the Precise version) for bash-completion (<< 1:1.90-1). The problem: bash-completion in Precise is 1:1.3-1ubuntu8.1. Therefore, git from this PPA cannot be installed in Ubuntu Precise without using another PPA for a newer version of bash-completion. Some PPAs that have the newer version of bash-completion are this, this, and this.\n", "Q: How can i make VM to fully cover the screen in KVM?

I recently set up a machine with Ubuntu Server to host game servers.  I installed a backup plugin for each game server that creates frequent backups of game world files in a particular folder on the machine.  I also established a cron task to automatically copy those backups to my Dropbox folder every night using rsync with the -a option.\nAfter a few months my Dropbox account reached its storage limit and I realized I would not be able to keep so many backups, so I configured the game server backup plugin to not retain so many backups, then waited a few days to see if it would delete the older backups as it is scheduled to do on a weekly basis.  The backup plugin eventually did its job and deleted the older backups, so I was expecting the rsync cron task to subsequently delete the older backups from my Dropbox folder to match the source folder, but it has not done so.  So I have a couple of questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*By default, does rsync only add files to the destination folder\nthat have been added to the source folder and change files that\nhave been changed in the source folder but NOT delete files\nthat were deleted from the source folder?\n\n*If that is the case, what is the best way to make rsync do this?  I\nwant the destination folder to perfectly reflect the source folder,\nand that means deleting any files that have been deleted from the source\nfolder.\nI see some options listed in the manual page for rsync that might do the trick, but since I'm not familiar with.\n\nA: This command will copy increment data and keep it in sync with remote server.\n\n\n*\n\n*It will copy only incremental data.\n\n*It will delete if any data deleted from source.\n\n*It will copy again from source if any data deleted at destination.\n\n*basically this command will keep the both environment in sync.\n\n\nrsync -avWe ssh --delete-before (source) root@localhost:(destination)\n rsync -avW --delete-before -e ssh (source) root@localhost:(destination)\nExample: \nrsync -avWe ssh --delete-before /data root@192.168.254.254:/backup\nrsync -avW --delete-before -e ssh /data root@192.168.254.254:/backup\n\n\nA: The rsync command wont delete any file while you use some of its options delete in that command. So if any file or folder added in source, it'll be synced to target without any deletion.\nI suggest you to use rsync for make backup from source files and use find ... rm for deletion files for period of time or size of files:\nrsync [options] SOURCE TARGET\nfind TARGET -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +60 -exec rm -f {} \\;\n\nThe above code block, make a backup from source and then delete every files which last modified time are more than 2 month.\nUPDATE\nAs I find that the delete options are just for TARGET that if some files are removed from source, rsync --delete remove them from TARGET. And the delete option by after and before, as mentioned in its man page:\n--delete-before         receiver deletes before transfer, not during\n\nMeans that:\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync delete the file from TARGET which are removed from SOURCE.\n\n*rsync start syncing files.\n\n\n--delete-after          receiver deletes after transfer, not during\n\nMeans that:\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync start syncing files.\n\n*rsync delete the file from TARGET which are removed from SOURCE after syncing.\n\n\nNOTE: The --delete-{before/after} implement just in TARGET.\n\nA: If there are any errors during an rsync scync, rsync will not properly delete the files it should have, even if you used --delete, --delete-after, or --delete-before.\nThis is why it is important to address rsync errors.\nMost of my errors were due to using the --perms option while syncing with a Non-Linux file system. When I replaced --perms with --no-perms, those errors went away and then deleting worked.\n--perms is ok when you are syncing from a Linux file system to a another Linux file system, but if you're syncing from Linux to a Non-Linux file system (like NTFS, FAT), --perms causes errors because rsync cannot set Linux permissions on a non-linux file systems. Again, errors = no delete.\n-- When syncing to a Non-Linux partition, I use --no-perms to avoid those errors that sabotage --delete, --delete-after, or --delete-before.\nIf you still get errors after that, and cannot figure out how to make those errors go way, you can run a command that is exclusively dedicated to deleting the out-of-sync files:\nsudo rsync -r --delete --existing --ignore-existing --ignore-errors --progress /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination\n\nThe command above will delete stuff that's out of sync, but won't sync any files. So, you should sync again after this. That command is based off of this answer, except that I added the --ignore-errors argument also, so it would delete even if there are errors.\n\nA: To delete files in the target, add the --delete option to your command. For example:\nrsync -avh source/ dest/ --delete\n\nNB: -avh is for --archive --verbose --human-readable\n\nA: The command\n$ rsync -avhn --delete local/ remote/\n\ntakes care to always sync back changes done locally to the remote. That means it takes care to synchronize local and remote such that\n\n*\n\n*files added in local are added to remote\n\n*files removed from local are removed from remote\n\n*files added in remote are removed\n\n*files removed from remote are restored from local if they exist, else ignored\n\n\nThe parameters explained:\n\n*\n\n*-a archive mode\n\n*-v increase verbosity\n\n*-h output numbers in a human-readable format\n\n*-n dry run, perform a trial run with no changes made. Always use this flag initially to prevent data loss. When you are happy, remove it.\n\n\nLet the results speak for themselves:\n\n*\n\n*Create 2 directories\n$ mkdir local/ remote/\n\n\n\n*Create files in them\n$ touch local/local_only remote/remote_only local/exists_locally_and_remotely remote/exists_locally_and_remotely`\n\n\n\n*See what has been created (before rsync):\n$ ls local/ remote/ \n\nlocal/:\nexists_locally_and_remotely  local_only\n\nremote/:\nexists_locally_and_remotely  remote_only\n\n\n\n*calling rsync:\n$ rsync -avh --delete local/ remote/\nsending incremental file list\ndeleting remote_only\nlocal_only\n\nsent 160 bytes  received 50 bytes  420.00 bytes/sec\ntotal size is 0  speedup is 0.00\n\n\n\n*See the result (after rsync):\n$ ls local/ remote/ \n\nlocal/:\nexists_locally_and_remotely  local_only\n\nremote/:\nexists_locally_and_remotely  local_only\n\nAs you can see, the file remote/remote_only has been deleted, the file local/local_only has been synchronized.\n\nA: The ‘-delete’ flag has to appear after your /source and /destination.\nSo it’s like this\nrsync -rvpthE --progress /Volumes/EOS_DIGITAL/DCIM/ /Users/mitchellg/Desktop/files -delete\n\nThe options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*-r recursive\n\n*-v verbose (print to screen)\n\n*-p permissions\n\n*-t time (use time instead of checksums ‘c’)\n\n*-h human readable \n\n*-E extended Info (the Color tags on a .Mac)\n\n", "Q: How to make my IP direct to my website instead of router?

I tried the ln command but it didn't work because owners of both folders are different, so there's no access permission via the symlink. \n\nA: You can create a shared folder and set permissions so that all users can access it. For convenience you can also create links in users' home directories to that folder.\nGo to /home and make a new directory\nsudo mkdir /home/pictures\n\nThen set permissions and ownership to make the folder accessible and writeable by all users (note that this is a security risk - it makes it possible for any user or process to modify the contents of the directory and add or delete content)\nsudo chmod 777 /home/pictures\nsudo chown nobody /home/pictures\n\nThen add the content as desired.\nA more secure method would be to create a group with all real users, for example:\nsudo addgroup pictures\nsudo adduser user1 user2 pictures\n\nAnd set the permissions of the /home/pictures directory like this:\nsudo chown :pictures /home/pictures\nsudo chmod 775 /home/pictures\n\nWith these settings, only group members and root will be able to write to the directory, though it will remain readable for guests and other processes (so a program that set your wallpaper would be able to read from it, for example).\nThen you can create links to access that folder, or user can create\nln -s /home/pictures /home/user1/Family_pictures\n\nWhen user1 tries to access Family_pictures they will see the contents of the shared directory,\n", "Q: How does Juju cache charms?

Note: this question is not about syncing data in a Dropbox-like way (files, folders), it is more about syncing configurations.\nI would like to have exactly the same version of Ubuntu with all the software installed and configured both on my Desktop PC and on my Laptop PC (and maybe on my small netbook PC) without using Ubuntu Sync and with minimal maintenance effort (setup once, run for a long time).\nThe use case is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*I work on my Laptop PC and do some changes to software configuration, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*configure vim to have a new plugin\n\n*update the Search Tracker / Recoll file search index\n\n*configure Thunderbird to have an additional IMAP account ('remember password')\n\n*add some new bookmarks in Firefox/Chrome\n\n*change the desktop background image\n\n*install new software with apt-get install\n\n*build and install new software with checkinstall\n\n*etc.\n\n\n*I do some 'sync' operation\n\n*I switch to my Desktop PC and get all the changes from (1) working on the Desktop PC\n\n*I work on my Desktop PC and do some changes to software configuration, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*add new directory to the list of directories to be backed up by DejaDup\n\n*add a new check spelling dictionary to the Libreoffice Writer\n\n*configure the Terminator software to have colored fonts\n\n*install new font into the Ubuntu system\n\n*configure Ekiga to make phone calls\n\n*etc.\n\n\n*I do some 'sync' operation\n\n*I switch to my Laptop PC and get all the changes from (1) and (4) working on the Laptop PC.\n\n\nQuestion: What free/open-source software can I use to sync both machines' Ubuntu systems, installed software and configurations? Is it possible to do that without any cloud services? \nComplementary question: It is obvious that the Desktop PC and the Laptop PC have different hardware configurations. How does the 'sync software' in question deal with video drivers, wlan drivers and their configurations?\nNote: I do not need all the PCs to be synced at the same time, because I work with only one single machine at once.\nNote: I considered to use Chef to solve the problem, but it seems that it might be really cumbersome to maintain such a setup.\nNote: I also considered using a bootable USB with Ubuntu installed (portable Linux), but I am not sure that the video drivers will work then.\n\nA: As far as I understand it your intentions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync the installed applications\n\n*Sync your work\n\n*Sync your dotfiles (configuration)\n\n\nWhatever you do, you will need some sort of cloud service. It doesn't have to be Dropbox. I highly recommend Seafile. I run it on Raspberry Pi at home for my syncing needs. Their documentation is easy to follow.\n1. Application Synchronization\nUntil 13.10 this was an out-of-the-box feature. Today I would use Ansible or other configuration management solutions (like puppet or chef). The Anible Playbook specifies what you want to have installed. You can use Seafile to keep that synced and use a cron job to run Ansible.\n2. Sync your work\nHere I would definitely use Seafile. It allows you to sync any folder of your chosing and doesn't confine you to a single Dropbox-like folder.\n3. Dotfiles\nYou can of course sync these with Seafile. An even better option would be to put all your dotfiles under git version control. You can join the crowd and put your dotfiles on github or use your own server as an intermediary. Some basic knowledge of git is of course required.\n\nA: You could move your home directory to a flash drive. That is where most programs store their configuration and compiled programs can be installed there using ./configure --prefix=/home/YOURNAME/bin (or any other directory). The only thing that does not work doing that is automatically syncing packages installed with apt-get.\nFor that install synaptic and before clicking the check to install those packages click \"save markings as...\" that will allow you to save a list of all of the packages that will be installed. When you get on your laptop run synaptic and then use \"read markings\" to get a list of the files you need. Then click the check to install the same files on your other computer.\nThis solution will not have any problems with drivers since the OS itself is not shared, only configuration, user files, etc. If you don't want to move all of your files around on the flash drive then you can store them in another folder (like /home/myfiles), which doesn't have to have a user associated with it.\nIf this is what you want to do then you must follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy your home folder's contents to the flash drive.\n\n*Remount the flash drive to your home folder's location.\n\n*Add the flash drive to the file /etc/fstab with the mount point being at your home folder.\n\n\nWhat this will do is when your computer is booted with the flash drive present Ubuntu will start normally but treat the flash drive as if it were your normal home folder. If the computer complains that the flash drive is non-bootable then you can change your bios settings to stop booting from a flash drive by moving the flash drive option down the list to below hard drives.\nIf you need help doing any of those you can ask in a comment. Also you can't remove the flash drive while the computer is running because unmounting it would mean removing your home folder from the system.\nHere is a detailed list of the steps above:\nBefore starting:\nThe flash drive isn't really ready to be used, it could technically be used as is but that isn't a great idea. Most flash drives use fat32 which is compatible with Linux, and also everything else, but doesn't support most of Linux's features so it should be changed to ext2, ext3/4 could be used but the journal can damage flash drives, but it does protect files in a power outage, so if you want to discuss this first you can leave a comment.\nAs a note Ext only works on linux, but this wouldn't share settings between non-Linux computers anyway so if you need this to work cross-platform then only user files will be shared (and the partition won't be able to be Ext), but if this is only for Linux, and only for one Desktop Environment (on every computer you are using) then it will work fine. (it's difficult to get different desktop environments to share settings even on the same computer)\nOpen Disk Utility (it should be accessible using the launcher), you will need to enter your password. Then select the flash drive, note down the device in the top right corner (it should look like /dev/sdb or something similar). Then click \"Unmount Volume\".\nThen click \"Format Volume\" the most important thing about this is that everything on the flash drive will be erased. On the menu that comes up click the type dropdown and select Ext2, or whatever filesystem you choose (tell me if you choose another since the mount and fstab need to know the type). Click the format button and wait for it to finish.\nStep 1:\nThis is the easiest, insert the flash drive in each computer and run type in cp -r /home/USER /mount/FLASHDRIVE where user and flash drive are the locations of your homefolder and the flashdrive. This will also work on hidden files (which as I mentioned are important). The most difficult part of this is that files with the same name will be over written, so make sure that the last computer you use is the one with the settings that you want the most. Also for the test coming up add a file called It Works, it doesn't have to contain anything.\nStep 2: You should probably skip this step\nI didn't really think about how involved this would be when I was writing the original response. When I tested it on my computer it didn't work and it's not really necessary and weird things will happen to your computer while you are running it, that will probably confuse you.\nThis only has to be done on one computer as a test to make sure everything works. Run sudo umount /dev/sdXY where XY is the device you got earlier followed by 1 (so if it was /dev/sdb write /dev/sdb1). Then run these commands:\nsudo shutdown now\nmount -t ext2 /dev/sXY /home/USER\ntelinit 5\n\nShutdown doesn't actually turn off the computer it puts you in single user mode so you can deal with the filesystems without them being used, you will be logged out though so don't be alarmed when the system changes completely.\nThen log in and your home folder should be the flash drive at this point. If the file created earlier is now in your home folder then the home folder must be the flash drive, so then you can move on to the next step. If not leave me a comment.\nStep 3:\nThis one has to be done on each computer run sudo gedit /etc/fstab. Then switch to the text editor that appeared. (if you are using KDE you should replace gedit with kate or whatever text editor you use. Then add this line to the bottom of the file replacing the parts in ALL-CAPS as necessary.\n/dev/sdXY /home/USER ext2 errors=remount-ro 0 1\n\nWhere XY is the device you got earlier followed by 1 (so if it was /dev/sdb write /dev/sdb1)\nAt this point restart the computer and the flash drive should have replaced your old home folder, with all of the settings saved to the drive and all of the files that were on the drive being in your home folder. You should check for the \"It Worked\" file in your home folder to be sure.\n", "Q: Mounting a map on a server through a different server First of all, my excuses, I could not find the question here anywhere.

That is because power and performance requires a lot of tweaks and experience with the kernel, drivers and OS code-base on one hand, and a lot of extensive long-term test and quality assurance on the other hand.\nGiven that Android is a rather old and established OS I saw that it has pretty good power consumption.\nPhoronix does this kind of comparissions but I was not able to find much about Ubuntu Touch.\nDoes Ubuntu Touch consume less than Android, do you have data on some platforms compared?\n\nA: My personal view (Might not be the answer you seek):\nWhy Android consumes more power?\nAndroid applications utilize Google's highly optimized Java Virtual Machine. So if you are looking from out side, an Android application is run inside a virtual machine which is inside the real machine. So you actually have two machines instead of one.\nEverytime an android app produces an instruction, it should be translated to into the native machine code from an intermediate code and is then executed by the CPU. This is an extra step which consumes power.\nUbuntu Touch's Internal Nature\nUbuntu touch has no Java Virtual Machine overhead. It can directly run binary programs compiled for the CPU, completely eliminating the need of translation. So we know the power consumption should be less in Ubuntu Touch for a certain extent.\nHowever most Ubuntu Touch apps so far use an interpreter called qmlscene which does something similar to Java Virtual Machine. Those apps aren't in binary format but human readable code. The code is interpreted to CPU instructions at run time. qmlscene's impact on performance is less than Java runtime, because no virtual machine is involved. It is not noted to be a power hungry system as QT developers have made it extremely efficient.\nThere are many other reasons for extra power consumption as well. It includes 3G/4G usage management, background services etc. We ignore such facts, because they get different from one device to another. Those facts are at least controllable by the operating system for a certain extent.\nSummary\nUbuntu touch will most probably consume less power than Android. At the time of writing it is not yet optimized to do so. We will have to wait until phones come out.\n\nA: Ubuntu Touch may use more power on phones where it was not installed by default, because the drivers are not optimized by the people who created the phone, and may be less efficient than on Android.\nTo get a reliable answer, you will have to compare two nearly identical phones, one running Ubuntu Touch and the other Android. The one running Ubuntu Touch should be tuned to support Ubuntu (e.g. the Meizu or bq phones announced recently).\n", "Q: Problems logging into windows after installing Ubuntu I installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 8, and it works fine, but when i restart the computer, in the dual boot i get to choose:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n*Advanced options for Ubuntu\n\n*Windows Boot Manager (on /dev/sda1)\n\n*System setup\n\n\nIf i click Ubuntu it goes right to Ubuntu and everything is fine.\nBut clicking on Windows i get the error:\n/EndEntire\nfile path: /ACPI(a0341d0,0)/PCI(2,1f)/Sata(0,0,0)/HD(1,800,fa000,41ea8f607930ff48,2,2)/File(\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot)/File(bootmgfw.efi)/EndEntire\nerror: cannot load image.\n\nPress any key to continue...\n\nI press Enter and i get:\n                        GNU GRUB version 2.02^beta2-9\nMinimal BASH-like line editing is supported.

I have Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS (64 bit) server with no GUI. Can anyone tell me how do I install KDE on it? Will that command be okay?\napt-get install kubuntu-desktop -y\nstartx\n\nOr something else has to be done?\n\nA: \nMost Ubuntu Server developers recommend not installing a GUI on a\n  server. There are multiple reasons for not installing a GUI.\nSome reasons to not install a GUI include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You'll have more code subject to security vulnerabilities, more\n  packages that need updating, and more server downtime.\n  \n*Performance may suffer because resources (memory, hard disk space,\n  CPU, etc.) will be consumed by the GUI.\n  \n*It is best practice to only install needed software on a production\n  server.\n  \n*The GUI may include other network services that are inappropriate\n  for a server.\n  \n  \n  One of the goals of Ubuntu Desktop Edition is to make it easier for\n  users to use Linux. When installing some desktop environments,\n  services that you may not specifically want will be installed. \nFor example avahi-daemon, which is used to help configure networking,\n  adds another open port and may introduce unwanted DNS conflicts with a\n  .local domain.\nIf you're using an Ubuntu LTS release prior to 12.04 LTS, X11 and\n  desktop packages are not supported for the full 5 year lifecycle of\n  the LTS server release. \nSo for the most secure server it is best to not install a\n  GUI.Ubuntu Help\n\n \nTo go ahead, and install KDE, just type the command(s) below at the prompt:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nThis will install all the default apps that comes with KDE.\nIf you just want the plain KDE desktop without any of the apps: \nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop --no-install-recommends\n\n", "Q: How to tile window on the corners in Xubuntu After I realized that Unity is overstretching my graphics card and my CPU, I decided to remain to Ubuntu by switching to Xubuntu.

I found the pdf file for the form I needed online, however it would not let me print the file. When viewing the file in Firefox which is using the default viewer, I click the print button and click ok/print. The printer will just push out a blank page. If I save the file on my system and pull it up in any other pdf file viewer I can print the file without fail. Not sure what is happening. My printer is connected to my pc and the ubuntu is connected to a wireless network which shares the printer on the pc. The printer should be setup properly because I can print from any other application and any other file type. Not sure if this is normal or I am having a small issue. Have tried changing a few settings but no help. I have put everything back to the default settings the way it was. Anyone have any ideas? Not sure what else to do....\n\nA: I had this exact problem, but instead of installing the Adobe plug-in, I went into Firefox -> edit preferences -> Applications and changed the PDF action from \"preview in Firefox\" to \"Use Document Viewer\".  This launches a separate Evince window with the document which prints nicely.  I never liked the idea of pdf's being viewed in the browser window anyway, so I'm happy.

I installed Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 on my PC. I have bought a hard disk and added it to my PC. The computer does not recognize the new hard drive. How can I let my Ubuntu use the new HDD I bought?\n\nA: Your hard disk might have no partitions yet.Therefore it's not usable until you make a partition.\nYou can install the software gParted from Ubuntu software center, and make a new partition in your new hard disk. \nOpen gParted and select the correct drive from top right drop down list:\n\nChoose Device menu > Create Partition Table\n\nCreate a new msdos partition table.\n\nNow add a new partition to the table by right clicking on unallocated space.\n\nSetup your partition:\n(TIP: Ext4 file system is efficient. NTFS file system is supported by Microsoft Windows)\n\nOnce done click on the right button:\n\nIts is better to reboot your computer. Then your new hard disk will be available to use.\n\nA: It does highly depend on what ptoblems you do encounzer, but in general I'd say that hard drives can be supposed to be detected by the BIOS.\nIf this is the case run:\n$ sudo lshw -C disk\n\nto get information about the drive. There should be one column for the new disk which contains logical name. That name will then be used to mount the disk. Let's assume that it is /dev/sdb.\n$ mkdir $HOME/my_new_drive\n$ sudo mount /dev/sdb $HOME/my_new_drive\n\nWill then make your new drive available under the directory $HOME/my_new_drive.\nIf you want to get the drive mounted everytime you boot you'll need to modify the fstab.

If I unplug I'd like the second screen to switch to desktops 2 and 4 respectively.\n\nA: *\n\n*A lot of guides say to right click on the taskbar or other panel. I found that I had to hold down Alt+Super and right click. I also had to do it on a blank area, not a current taskbar button.\n\n*Click New panel\n\n*Find where the new panel has been added - with a default config it will likely be to the right of the screen.\n\n*Hold the same key combination as above and drag the panel to the second screen. Snap it to whichever edge you want.\n\n*Use the combination again, right click the new panel and click Add to panel\n\n*In the list scroll to the bottom to find Window list\n\n*This should be added and pull in any windows on the current screen.\n\n\nIf you need to reset the Gnome panels at any point the command line killall gnome-panel should cause them to be removed and restart themselves.\nStill bonus points for the rest of the question above!\n", "Q: Windows key shortcuts Is there a plugin that will give me the same directional key shortcuts as with Windows 7?

I really miss this function as well as a few others and would love to use them in Ubuntu.\nthanks,\n\nA: This shortcuts are default in Ubuntu 14.04.\nBut anyway you can install compizConfig settings manager and look at the section: Window Management > Grid. There you can define the shortcuts you want for such actions.\n", "Q: How can I decrease the volume increment in 14.04? I know that this has already been asked a lot, but all solutions that I found are old, pre - Unity. So, I am asking again: How can I decrease the sound increment(or decrement) that happens when the mouse wheel is scrolled, if the cursor is hovering over the volume bar(like shown below)?\n\n\nA: You should control your volume either my mouse scroll as you suggested or by left/right arrow keys.\nIf arrow keys aren't working, then it's probably a bug described at indicator-sound keyboard controls with left/right ARROW keys broken.\nThis bug was fixed in the package ido - 13.10.0+14.04.20140213-0ubuntu1.\nIf the volume adjust is too coarse-grained, try upgrading indicator-sound package (>= 0.5.6) or try to Decrease mouse sensitivity below the standard limit.\nAlternatively you can define your own keyboard shortcuts in System->Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts. As a side note you must have the correct sound mixer device selected in System->Preferences->Sound for it to work properly. This may be a problem source if your volume will not adjust. \n", "Q: A software for adjusting touch screen options I am using a laptop with a touch-screen, and I am looking for a software that will allow me to customize the touch screen options. For example, I want firefox to scroll down when I'm touching the screen and drag my finger up (like in laptops with Windows 8). Is there any program that allows me to do that?\nThank for answering!\n\nA: I found a blogpost concerning modifications of the sensitivity of a touchpad of a notebook under ubuntu 13.10, but I think that your problem is related to that one or can be solved in a similar way.\nWhat is proposed in the blog is an edit of the touch driver configuration, which should be synaptic.\n$ sudo vim /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synapticconf\n\nIn that file you will probably need to add an event for long-presses, if it is not there yet.\n", "Q: How to include environment Variable in launcher for icon This is an extension to the question how to include an environment variable in the launcher? . This question explains how to use the environment variable for the Exec part of the .desktop file but not the icon\nan example: \n[Desktop Entry]\nName=My Application name\nComment=a comment\nExec=sh -c '$HOME/.bin/path/to/bin'\nIcon= $HOME/.bin/path/to/icon\n\nThis Launcher will work but the icon is not shown. I can't use something like\nIcon=sh -c '$HOME/.bin/path/to/icon'\n\nfor the icon... what to do instead?\n\nA: Honestly the best way to use an icon in a launcher is to make sure the icon file is in the icon search path. Referring to the freedesktop.org icon directory scheme and base directory definitions, icons should be searched for in at least the following directories on Ubuntu systems:\n\n\n*\n\n*$HOME/.icons\n\n*$HOME/.local/share/icons\n\n*/usr/local/share/icons\n\n*/usr/share/icons\n\n*/usr/share/pixmaps\nSo if you want to use your own icon and do not have root privileges, install the icon into either $HOME/.icons or $HOME/.local/share/icons. Using the latter, you can even mimic the system icon directory structure with multi-resolution icons using the same base name under directories like $HOME/.local/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps and $HOME/.local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps.\nIf the icon is in one of these searchable directories, you can simply use Icon=myapp in the .desktop file.\n\nA: You can try something like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=MyApp\nExec=sh -c \"mv %k %k-bak && sed -e \"s,^Icon=.*,Icon=$HOME/.bin/path/to/icon.png,g\" %k-bak > %k && chmod +x %k; rm %k-bak\"\nIcon=???\n\nThis will add the relative Icon path to the .desktop file after you run it.\nSome more details:\n%kstands for the path of the .desktop file\n\n\n*\n\n*mv %k %k-bak creates a backup file   \n\n*sed -e \"s,^Icon=.*,Icon=$HOME/.bin/path/to/icon.png,g\" ... replace the old Icon path with the current $HOME... path (\"^\" -> beginning line, is here really importand to not replace the command self) and create the new .desktop file\n\n*chmod +x %k make the new .desktop file executable \n\n*rm %k-bak remove the old backup file\nYou can add your own commands after the Icon path was changed or before.\nInspired by https://stackoverflow.com/a/3464561 and https://askubuntu.com/a/345123/265974\n", "Q: Remmina connection issue to Windows Server 2012R2 after Windows Update I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and Remmina to connect to a Windows Server 2012R2 computer. I am being prompted for my password and put it in successfully, but fail to login to the server. I was able to connect prior to a set of Windows updates. What can I do to resolve the issue and connect to the server?\n\nA: The issue is the certificate was changed on the server as a result of the update, but Remmina did not prompt to update the certificate. Navigate to the .freerdp folder and edit known_hosts file. The entry for the target machine needs to be removed.

You will need to configure this to reflect the network you want. If you read the docs at http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/cluster-configuration.html this should outline what needs to be done.\n\nIn your case, two interfaces should be listed, and you should select eth1 to be managed with DHCP and DNS.\n", "Q: When I use ZSH, how do I set PATH in /etc/profile.d? I'm using zsh as my shell, and I'm trying to configure my environment.\nI usually define my $JAVA_HOME variable by creating a file:\n/etc/profile.d/java.sh\n\nwith the following content\nexport JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk\nexport PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH\n\nthen I logout and back in, and it all works, but for some reason the PATH variable is not set. It recognizes JAVA_HOME, but not the new PATH, see this terminal snippet:\n~  echo $JAVA_HOME\n/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_05\n~  echo $PATH\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n\nand I confirmed it by trying to run a command form the jvm\n~  java -version\nzsh: command not found: java\n\nthe PATH doesn't include the $JAVA_HOME as it should. is there something else I should check?\nI have checked that if I run:\nsource /etc/profile.d/java.sh\n\nit all runs correctly and my variables get set as they should, but shouldn't the scripts in /etc/profile.d run automatically?\n\nA: I find that placing everything in one .zshenv file quickly becomes hard to manage. I recommend installing oh-my-sh and then placing various customizations (env vars, functions) to the .oh-my-sh/custom/ directory as separate .zsh files.\nI also discovered that this approach works flawlessly when ssh'ing into machine when modifying env variables such as PATH. Also it works really nice together with vcsh for keeping customizations backed up and in sync.\n\nA: From my point of view, the best way is to add the following lines at the ~/.zshrc file (if you don't already have it, then create it):\nif [ -d \"/path/to/jdk\" ] ; then\n    export PATH=\"/path/to/jdk/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nThen restart your zsh, or just run source ~/.zshrc and then your PATH should be exactly as you wish.\nOr, if you want to make the change to be system-wide, then add the previous code to the end of /etc/zsh/zshenv file.\nBut in any case do not use /etc/profile.d to automatically run scripts in zsh. This directory is useful only for the bash shell, not zsh as in your case. To understand this, open /etc/profile file, which is a bash initialization file and in no case a zsh initialization file, and you will see somewhere at the end of the file:\nif [ -d /etc/profile.d ]; then\n  for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh; do\n    if [ -r $i ]; then\n      . $i\n    fi\n  done\n  unset i\nfi\n\nSo, your scripts from /etc/profile.d directory will automatically run in zsh only if you add the previous code in a zsh initialization file, like /etc/zsh/zprofile for example, or source /etc/profile in /etc/zsh/zprofile file.\n\nA: Since JAVA_HOME is set, you have confirmed that those scripts are sourced automatically, haven't you?\nThe only logical explanation is that PATH is set later on somehow. It should be originally set by PAM which reads /etc/environment, and as far as I know that happens before /etc/profile.d/*.sh files are sourced. Possibly zsh works different compared to bash in that respect.\n\nA: Just ran into this issue locally after running updates. Looks like the root issue is Drush doesn't know where to find a legit copy of php that includes pdo. Fortunately it supports stashing this path in an environment variable, so I did this on the commandline:\nexport DRUSH_PHP=\"/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.4.39/bin/php\"\n\nThat fixed the issue so I edited .zshrc and added that to the file, problem solved.\n", "Q: In XUbuntu there are black unreadable tabs in GTK applications such as gEdit I'm using XFCE in Ubuntu 14.04.   When I open gEdit, the tabs at the top are unreadable:\n\nHaving done some research, it appears that this is because gEdit is a GTK 2.0 application and this problem manifests itself if the theme you are using does not have specific workarounds in it for GTK 2.0 applications. \nHere is what I have tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*This forum thread seems to indicate that using the Greybird theme would solve the problem.

I am quite new to Ubuntu. I have found the  solution that comes closest to my above-mentioned problem in the admirable answers to the question \"Why can an application installed using Wine not access NTFS partitions?\" The procedure as I have understood from those answers is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the desired partition.\n\n*Go to Wine configuration, then to 'Drives', click 'Z:', then 'Browse', click '+' beside 'media', then '+' beside your user name, and you find your desired partition.\n\n\nThis works.

It was created by cloning a regular ext4-based install with all the necessary packages onto a ZFS pool, chrooting into that pool and recreating a grub menu and bootloader. The system uses an ext-3 dedicated /boot partition.\nI would like to do the same with Ubuntu 14.04, but have encountered several obstacles.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no Trusty zfs-grub package\n\n*The default grub package doesn't have ZFS support built in. I found a small bug in the build system responsible for that (report with patch created) and built my own grub packages.\n\n*The built-in ZFS support is dysfunctional, it does not add the proper arguments to the kernel command line\n\n*I thus installed the ZoL grub package I also use on my LMDE system, which does give me a correct grub.cfg\n\n\nHowever, even with that correct grub.cfg, the boot process apparently doesn't retrieve the bootfs parameter from the ZFS pool; instead the variable that's supposed to receive the value remains empty. As a result, initrd tries to load the default pool (\"rpool\"), which fails of course. I can however import the pool by hand, and complete the process by hand.\nIf memory serves me well, I also had to disable apparmor, to avoid the boot process from blocking after importing the pool.\nAm I overlooking something? Just for comparison, I installed the Ubuntu 3.13 kernel on my LMDE system, and that works just fine (i.e. the identical kernel and grub binaries allow successful booting without glitches on LMDE but not on Ubuntu).\nedit: grub bug reports:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1321335?comments=all\nhttps://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?42392\n\nA: These instructions are quite thorough:\nhttps://github.com/zfsonlinux/pkg-zfs/wiki/HOWTO-install-Ubuntu-to-a-Native-ZFS-Root-Filesystem\n", "Q: qBittorrent - List directories/folders first under torrent content I would like to list the directories under torrent contents first. Is this possible? I have checked the settings to no avail.\n\nA: You can not see the file without putting the torrent in the queue. But you can use an existing library for write a parser for torrent file, or you can also write your own library, using the specifications of the torrent explained here.\n", "Q: Force fsck safe? My ubuntu system just froze, and I was forced to run the REIUSB commands. Now, in windows, you can run chdsk. I've read about \"touch /forcefsck\", but I have also read that's is dangerous to check a mounted filesystem.\nWill \"touch /forcefsck\" check the disks mounted? Is \"touch /forcefsck\" safe? Will it automatically fix the errors? Where will my corrupt file go? \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Yes and no. It is safe enough, and some distros will routinely run this every 30 days.\nThe generally preferred method is to boot a live distro and check the drive as a non-system device, partition by partition if need be. You can run e2fsck -c -c to check for bad blocks, it will take a while. Note that for LVM groups some special handling is required. (check from /dev/mapper/...). The most recent versions of GParted and the like do this fairly handily.\n\nA: touch /forcefsck simply creates a file /forcefsck. This file will cause the system to run fsck on the next reboot before the filesystem is mounted. Its similar to when you try to run chkdsk in Windows and it says it can't but it will do it on the next reboot.\nSo its pretty safe and with any luck it will fix your problem.\n", "Q: Include Binary Files in DEB package I need to build a DEB package from mainly Node.js Javascript files, but it should include some binary files as well. They are listed inside debian/source/include-binaries. Otherwise I get the error message\ndpkg-source: error: unrepresentable changes to source\n\nThe command in question is:\nbzr builddeb -- -us -uc\n\nAfter adding the file include-binaries, when running bzr builddeb -- -us -uc again, now I get a different error: It says\ndpkg-source: error: aborting due to unexpected upstream changes, see /tmp/mailadmin_0.0-1.diff.n6m5_6\n\nI have no idea how to get rid of this.\nIn the next line of output it tells me\ndpkg-source: info: you can integrate the local changes with dpkg-source --commit\n\nBut if I run this command in the build area of my package, it gives me the unrepresentable changes to source error message again, even though debian/source/include-binaries is present in the build area as well.\nI am missing the way out of this...\nI tried deleting all files that are produced by the build process, still no success.\nFurther details:\nThe target directory is /opt/mailadmin. Since this directory is unusual, I listed it in the file debian/mailadmin.install (which contains one line:)\nopt/mailadmin opt/\n\nThe bzr builddeb process uses this file as expected.\nThere is no upstream tarball, because the project is new.\n\nA: Your error doesn't have anything to do with binary file. Though it does sound extremely similar. (Might be worth filing a bug on dpkg about better error messages in these cases.) If it was about a binary file it would look like:\ndpkg-source: error: cannot represent change to package_name-X.Y/debian/some_binary_file.png: binary file contents changed\n\nAnd even then, it would only happen if you were using an old style version 1.0 source package.\nThis has to do with the upstream tarball. If you're really using bzr builddeb -- -us -uc you must have convinced bzr builddeb you have an upstream tarball or it would have errored looking for one. The contents of whatever tarball you created don't match the contents of the bzr branch, so you get the error about \"unexpected upstream changes.\"\nThe simplest way to deal with this case is to pass the --split flag:\nbzr builddeb --split -- -us -uc\n\nFrom bzr help builddeb:\n  --split               Automatically create an .orig.tar.gz from a full\n                        source branch.\n\nThis simply puts everything outside of /debian into a tarball and uses that.\n", "Q: How to include microphone adjustment in sound menu When I use skype I have 2 scrollbars for the sound:\n\nHow can I keep those 2 scrollbars all the time, and not only when I have skype conversations?

With Precise, I used to create a USB stick using the so-called \"Alternate\" installer DVD with my own preseed.txt, update isolinux/txt.cfg with a new menu item that would pass my preseed file on the command line, and watch as the installer happily did all the right things to create a Ubuntu install on the hard drive of the machine I booted.\nWith Trusty, the 'alternate' image has disappeared.\nIs it still possible to preseed a Trusty install, and if so, how do I get the d-i/ubiquity system to use my preseed file?\n\nA: Dave (the original asker of this question) and I came across the solution ourselves.\nIt turns out that if you start from the Server ISO (rather than the Desktop ISO we originally grabbed), you are already much closer to what we were familiar with from Precise.

I've installed DLNA server on my ubuntu pc but i want to share web content without downloading it to my pc.\nIs that possible ?\n\nA: I have a Yamaha RX-V473 that recently stopped playing internet radio stations, because it was integrated with the now defunct Vtuner service. The update to fix this is only available for newer products.\nThe RX-V473 has the possibility to access DLNA servers and I had it hooked up to an Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS with Rygel installed (sudo apt install rygel) and media sharing in Ubuntu settings set to Active.\n\nPlaying your own MP3 files collection is working and easy and even mp3 files in Dropbox, those in Google Drive or any other files on any server that can be accessed with the Files browser can be accessed by adding the  folder in Ubuntu Settings > Sharing. This can be Appletalk files over the afp:// protocol, FTP, FTPS, NFS, SMB, SFTP, SSH, DAV or DAVS shares. You name it, it works. But I want to listen to internet radio station SomaFM on my stereo and this option is not (yet) present in the Sharing section of Ubuntu settings.\nTo stream SomaFM over DLNA (Rygel) to your DLNA client you need to edit rygel.conf, specifically the one in $HOME/.config/rygel.conf.\nGo to the section [GstLaunch] and edit the changes as seen below.\nI have added the complete section of a working version here.\n[GstLaunch]\nenabled=true\nlaunch-items=audiotestsrc;soma;drone\n\naudiotestsrc-title=Audiotestsrc\naudiotestsrc-mime=audio/x-wav\naudiotestsrc-launch=audiotestsrc ! wavenc\n\nsoma-title=SomaFM SpaceStation\nsoma-mime=audio/mpeg\nsoma-launch=souphttpsrc iradio-mode=false location=http://ice2.somafm.com/spacestation-128-mp3 \n\ndrone-title=SomaFM Dronezone\ndrone-mime=audio/mpeg\ndrone-launch=souphttpsrc iradio-mode=false location=http://ice2.somafm.com/dronezone-128-mp3\n\n(Beware there should not be a return between false and location! Just a space) It should be one line\nNow when the receiver is going to search for DLNA servers under the server button it sees the media share from Rygel and GstLaunch. Select GstLaunch and 3 stations appear, Audiotestsrc will produce a test tone for testing, while SomaFM SpaceStation and SomaFM Dronezone will play the relevant streams.\nYou can add as many Internet radio stations as you want.\n\n\n*\n\n*To check if the stream url is working open VLC and go to Media > Network stream and enter the URL. If VLC starts producing music the stream URL is correct.\n\n*Every time you edit/change rygel.conf you need to click Media sharing off and on in Ubuntu Settings to restart Rygel.\n\nA: I think it depends on the capabilities of your SmartTV or how your SmartTV is connected to the DNLA server. As far as I know my Samsung SmartTV can only access media that is stored on the DNLA server thus it might not be possible (without additional third party software). For a start make sure that your router allows traffic via DNLA port (TCP/UDP 5001) to your TV because that was an issue I had to deal with when I installed DNLA on a computer on my network. It might be worth checking with the cloud provider if there is a possibility to access their service with a SmartTV using dedicated App.\nCheers,\n\nA: In software (Linux Mint/Ubuntu..)- find and install Rygel. It is a DNLA server. Then move the movies you want to watch into your movies folder. You can then access this through your Smart TV (or Roku or AppleTV box).\n", "Q: What is Dell OpenManage Ubuntu Repository? What is Dell OpenManage Ubuntu & Debian Repositories?\nDo we need to install for Ubuntu?\n\nA: It is a repository to install Dell OpenManage, a software designed to manage deployments of dell servers. It's usually only used on big IT shops.\nYou shouldn't install it unless you have a rack with some hundreds of dell servers in the backyard ;).\n\nA: You would want to use this if you are running a DELL PowerEdge Server, and need to monitor it over a network. You wouldn't need this unless you were using a server more then likely, but you could install this via CLI to work on a DELL Desktop with RAID [Haven't tested the second scenario].\nThe installation procedure for Ubuntu is not for the novice since it requires some tweaking and is used for monitoring production servers used in business settings [e.g. rack servers in Data Centers].\n", "Q: Consistency of GTK2 toolbars with GTK3 One of the reasons why I don't like Ubuntu's default theme Ambiance is the unacceptable inconsistency between GTK2 and GTK3 toolbars as seen in LibreOffice and Chromium/Chrome web browser.\nThis is not the case in the Greybird theme, for example, which proves that it is possible.\nI would appreciate if someone can help tweak this.\nNote: a similar problem with menus (inc.

I have a set of servers and I would like to install OpenStack, how can I install OpenStack with Metal-as-a-Service (MAAS)?\n\nA: Scope\nThis document provides instructions on how to install the Metal As A Service\n(MAAS) software.\n\n*\n\n*You have sufficient, appropriate node hardware\n\n*You will be using Juju to assign workloads to MAAS\n\n*You will be configuring the cluster network to be controlled entirely by MAAS (i.e. DNS and DHCP)\n\n*If you have a compatible power-management system, any additional hardware required is also installed(e.g. IPMI network).\n\nIntroducing MAAS\nMetal as a Service – MAAS – lets you treat physical servers like virtual machines in the cloud. Rather than having to manage each server individually, MAAS turns your bare metal into an elastic cloud-like resource.\nWhat does that mean in practice? Tell MAAS about the machines you want it to manage and it will boot them, check the hardware’s okay, and have them waiting for when you need them. You can then pull nodes up, tear them down and redeploy them at will; just as you can with virtual machines in the cloud.\nWhen you’re ready to deploy a service, MAAS gives Juju the nodes it needs to power that service. It’s as simple as that: no need to manually provision, check and, afterwards, clean-up. As your needs change, you can easily scale services up or down. Need more power for your Hadoop cluster for a few hours? Simply tear down one of your Nova compute nodes and redeploy it to Hadoop. When you’re done, it’s just as easy to give the node back to Nova.\nInstalling MAAS from the Cloud Archive\nThe Ubuntu Cloud Archive is a repository made especially to provide users with the most up to date, stable versions of MAAS, Juju and other tools. It is highly recommended to keep your software up to date:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThere are several packages that comprise a MAAS install. These are:\n\n*\n\n*maas-region-controller: Which comprises the 'control' part of the software, including the web-based user interface, the API server and the main database.\n\n*maas-cluster-controller: This includes the software required to manage a cluster of nodes, including managing DHCP and boot images.\n\n*maas-dns: This is a customised DNS service that MAAS can use locally to manage DNS for all the connected nodes.\n\n*mass-dhcp: As for DNS, there is a DHCP service to enable MAAS to correctly enlist nodes and assign IP addresses.\n\nThe DHCP setup is critical for the correct PXE booting of nodes.\nAs a convenience, there is also a maas metapackage, which will install all these components.\nIf you need to separate these services or want to deploy an additional cluster\ncontroller, you should install the corresponding packages individually.\nInstalling the packages\nRunning the command:\nsudo apt-get install maas\n\n...will initiate installation of all the components of MAAS. The maas-dhcp and maas-dns packages should be installed by default.\nOnce the installation is complete, the web-based interface for MAAS will start.\nIn many cases, your MAAS controller will have several NICs. By default,\nall the services will initiate using the first discovered controller (i.e.\nusually eth0)\nBefore you login to the server for the first time, you should create a superuser\naccount.\nCreate a superuser account\nOnce MAAS is installed, you'll need to create an administrator account:\nsudo maas-region-admin createsuperuser \n\nRunning this command will prompt for a username, an email address and a password\nfor the admin user. You may also use a different username for your administrator\naccount, but \"root\" is a common convention and easy to remember.\nYou can run this command again for any further administrator accounts you may\nwish to create, but you need at least one.\nImport the boot images\nMAAS will check for and download new Ubuntu images once a week. However, you'll\nneed to download them manually the first time. To do this you should connect to\nthe MAAS web interface using a web browser. Use the URL:\nhttp://172.18.100.1/MAAS/\n\nYou should substitute in the IP address of the server where you have installed\nthe MAAS software. If there are several possible networks, by default it will be\non whichever one is assigned to the eth0 device.\nYou should see a login screen like this:\n\nEnter the username and password you specified for the admin account. When you\nhave successfully logged in you should see the main MAAS page:\n\nEither click on the link displayed in the warning at the top, or on the\n'Cluster' tab in the menu to get to the cluster configuration screen. The\ninitial cluster is automatically added to MAAS when you install it, but it has\nno associated images for booting nodes with yet. Click on the button to begin\nthe download of suitable boot images.\nImporting the boot images can take some time, depending on the available network\nconnection. This page does not dynamically refresh, so you can refresh it\nmanually to determine when the boot images have been imported.\nLogin to the server\nTo check that everything is working properly, you should try and login to the\nserver now. Both the error messages should have gone (it can take a few minutes\nfor the boot image files to register) and you can see that there are currently\n0 nodes attached to this controller.\nConfigure switches on the network\nSome switches use Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP) to negotiate a loop-free path\nthrough a root bridge. While scanning, it can make each port wait up to 50\nseconds before data is allowed to be sent on the port. This delay in turn can\ncause problems with some applications/protocols such as PXE, DHCP and DNS, of\nwhich MAAS makes extensive use.\nTo alleviate this problem, you should enable\nPortfast\nfor Cisco switches or its equivalent on other vendor equipment, which enables\nthe ports to come up almost immediately.\nAdd an additional cluster\nWhilst it is certainly possible to run MAAS with just one cluster controller\nfor all the nodes, in the interests of easier maintenance, uprades and\nstability, it is desirable to have at least two operational clusters.\nEach cluster needs a controller node. Install Ubuntu on this node and then\nfollow a similar setup proceedure to install the cluster controller software:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install maas-cluster-controller\nsudo apt-get install maas-dhcp maas-dns\n\nOnce the cluster software is installed, it is useful to run:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure maas-cluster-controller\n\nThis will enable you to make sure the cluster controller agent is pointed at the\ncorrect address for the MAAS master controller.\n\nConfigure additional Cluster Controller(s)\nCluster acceptance\nWhen you install your first cluster controller on the same system as the region\ncontroller, it will be automatically accepted by default (but not yet\nconfigured, see below). Any other cluster controllers you set up will show up\nin the user interface as “pending,” until you manually accept them into the MAAS.\nTo accept a cluster controller, click on the \"Clusters\" tab at the top of the\nMAAS web interface:\nYou should see that the text at the top of the page indicates a pending cluster.\nClick on that text to get to the Cluster acceptance screen.\n\nHere you can change the cluster’s name as it appears in the UI, its DNS zone,\nand its status. Accepting the cluster changes its status from “pending” to\n“accepted.”\nNow that the cluster controller is accepted, you can configure one or more of\nits network interfaces to be managed by MAAS. This will enable the cluster\ncontroller to manage nodes attached to those networks. The next section\nexplains how to do this and what choices are to be made.\nCluster Configuration\nMAAS automatically recognises the network interfaces on each cluster controller.\nSome of these will be connected to networks where you want to manage nodes. We\nrecommend letting your cluster controller act as a DHCP server for these\nnetworks, by configuring those interfaces in the MAAS user interface.\nAs an example, we will configure the cluster controller to manage a network on\ninterface eth0. Click on the edit icon for eth0, which takes us to this page:\n\nHere you can select to what extent you want the cluster controller to manage the\nnetwork:\n\n*\n\n*DHCP only - this will run a DHCP server on your cluster\n\n*DHCP and DNS - this will run a DHCP server on the cluster and configure the\nDNS server included with the region controller so that it can be used to look up\nhosts on this network by name (recommended).\n\nYou cannot have DNS management without DHCP management because MAAS relies on\nits own DHCP server’s leases file to work out the IP address of nodes in the\ncluster.\nIf you set the interface to be managed, you now need to provide all of the usual\nDHCP details in the input fields below. Once done, click “Save interface”. The\ncluster controller will now be able to boot nodes on this network.\nThere is also an option to leave the network unmanaged. Use this for\nnetworks where you don’t want to manage any nodes. Or, if you do want to manage\nnodes but want to use an existing DHCP service on your network.\nA single cluster controller can manage more than one network, each\nfrom a different network interface on the cluster-controller server. This may\nhelp you scale your cluster to larger numbers of nodes, or it may be a\nrequirement of your network architecture.\nEnlisting nodes\nNow that the MAAS controller is running, we need to make the nodes aware of MAAS\nand vice-versa. With MAAS controlling DHCP and nodes capable of PXE booting,\nthis is straightforward\nAutomatic Discovery\nWith nodes set to boot from a PXE image, they will start, look for a DHCP\nserver, receive the PXE boot details, boot the image, contact the MAAS server\nand shut down.\nDuring this process, the MAAS server will be passed information about the node,\nincluding the architecture, MAC address and other details which will be stored\nin the database of nodes. You can accept and comission the nodes via the web\ninterface. When the nodes have been accepted the selected series of Ubuntu will\nbe installed.\n\nYou may also accept and commission all nodes from the commandline.\nThis requires that you first login with the API key, then run the command:\nmaas-cli maas-profile nodes accept-all\n\nOnce commissioned, the node's status will be updated to \"Ready\". you can check the results of the comissioning scripts by clicking on the node name and then clicking on the link below the heading \"Commissioning output\". The screen will show a list of files and their result - you can further examine the output by clicking on the status of any of the files.\n\nManually adding nodes\nIf your nodes are not capable of booting from PXE images, they can be manually\nregistered with MAAS. On the main web interface screen, click on the \"Add Node\"\nbutton:\n\nThis will load a new page where you can manually enter details about the node,\nincluding its MAC address. This is used to identify the node when it contacts\nthe DHCP server.\n\nPower management\nMAAS supports several types of power management. To configure power management,\nyou should click on an individual node entry, then click on the \"Edit\" button.\nThe power management type should be selected from the drop down list, and the\nappropriate power management details added.\n\nIf you have a large number of nodes, it should be possible to script this\nprocess using the MAAS cli.\nWithout power management, MAAS will be unable to power on nodes when they are\nrequired.\nNext Steps:\n\n*\n\n*How do I prepare MAAS to serve images on OpenStack?\n\n*How do I deploy an OpenStack cloud with Juju?\n", "Q: Gamepad detected by lsusb but not by PCSX or jstest-gtk in Ubuntu 14.04 I had been using a PS3 gamepad on PCSX for a while on Ubuntu 14.04, but realized it stopped working today.\nThe controller is detected by lsusb on Terminal, but it does not appear in PCSX or jstest-gtk.\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp.

Only thing is: the port sometime changes. So I did this in bash profile:\nfunction runserver() {\n   python manage.py runserver 10.211.55.4:$1\n}\n\nBut then when I call it: runserver 3000, it starts it, but immediately stops saying:\n\"Error: That IP address can't be assigned-to\". However if I type the same thing right into command line it works with no complains.\n\nA: Along the lines of your original attempt, you could adjust that function to the following:\nfunction runserver() {\n    python manage.py runserver 10.211.55.4:$PORT\n}\n\nand then call it like so:\nPORT=3000 runserver\n\n\nA: This is actually an error you get back from Python/Django when you feed it an IP address it can't bind to (one that isn't part of the system) as shown in a real, just-run example below:\n$ python manage.py runserver 123.123.123.123:8000\nValidating models...\n\n0 errors found\nJune 03, 2014 - 22:36:58\nDjango version 1.5.7, using settings 'tv.settings'\nDevelopment server is running at http://123.123.123.123:8000/\nQuit the server with CONTROL-C.\nError: That IP address can't be assigned-to.\n\nSo you either need to fix your IP address (look at the output of ifconfig --all to see what's available) or you just bind to all of them with:\nfunction runserver() {\n    python manage.py runserver 0:$1\n}\n\nThe bash side of things is sound.\n\nA: You're doing it right.\nI suspect that you're running into a networking issue in your testing, and the fact that the failed test used the function was a coincidence. When you close a TCP connection, the port remains in use for a small amount of time (30s), in case there were pending packets that were not yet received (packets may arrive out of order).

In a tutorial related to a software installation that I am following say that I have to execute the following commands (I am doing it into an ssh shell, so this list of steps end with the exit command):\nsudo -s\napt-get update\napt-get install -y build-essential libtool libcurl4-openssl-dev libncurses5-dev libudev-dev autoconf automake screen\nexit\n\nMy doubts are:\nWhat exactly does the -s parameter do after sudo command?\nSearching on the web I found that:\n\n‑s [command]\n      The ‑s (shell) option runs the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is set or the shell as specified in the\n  password database. If a command is specified, it is passed to the\n  shell for execution via the shell's ‑c option. If no command is\n  specified, an interactive shell is executed\n\nIt seems to me that the sudo -s execute a command using the environment variable of the shell.\nBut this is not clear for me: in this case what is the command executed with the environment variable? (it only executes sudo -s and not sudo -s [command]).\n\nA: The simple answer is it gives you a root shell. That's what it's being used for here. There's a good technical comparison between the su, sudo -i, sudo -s and sudo su methods on Unix.SE but that's really not relevant here. The code could have used any and would have worked.\nThe help nugget means a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's looking for a command in the $SHELL environment variable. If you run echo $SHELL you'll probably see /bin/bash. That means you'll get a root instance of Bash. I'm sure if you were in zsh it would mean you get a root instance of zsh.\n\n*If $SHELL is empty, it falls back to the default shell defined in /etc/passwd for that user.\n\n*If you provide a command (eg sudo -s whoami), it's actually running: sudo /bin/bash -c \"whoami\"\n\n*If you don't pass a command,  it doesn't pass a -c argument over so you just get an interactive shell.\nI've used the phrase \"root\" several times. By default sudo is all about running things as root but sudo (and su) can run things as other users (if you have permission to do so). I'm only stating this for the pedants who will cry out that sudo -s -u $USER doesn't give them a root shell as I promised -s would above.\n\nAnd in my humblest of opinions, it's really silly to become root for just two commands, not to mention that it could leave a user accidentally running further commands as root. If you want or need to run something as root, just premend the command with sudo:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y build-essential libtool libcurl4-openssl-dev libncurses5-dev libudev-dev autoconf automake screen\n\nI'd be dubious of any tutorial that suggested getting a root shell, except in the cases where you do have bucketloads of commands to run... And even then, there's scripting.\n\nA: sudo -s will run a command in the current directory like a regular user would.

Also, the gamepad DOES work, at least it has on my windows machine, and jstest-gtk recognizes it's existence)!  I'm assuming that it has to be something with the way the input is located, because when I run xboxdrv (sudo xboxdrv --silent), it tells me something about it being available as dev/input/js0 or dev/input/event14.  Maybe the games are looking for joystick input from another directory and thus aren't receiving anything?\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: For all controllers but the actual Xbox 360 gamepads, you have to do some configuration with xboxdrv first.

Tried only installing OpenSSH service did not help. Tried with and without LVM when creating partition.\nHow can we resolve this issue?\n\nA: After trying many different options, I remember 12.04 also had the same problem and solution was remove Network Adapter from VM setting then install ubuntu without network card.\nI tried the same with 14.04 and voila grub install successfully. After boot up, we just need to add Network adapter again then we are done.\nI thought I need to share this as many people will have the same issue.\n\nA: Unfortunately all I can add is conjecture, but I had this issue and got past it.\nI believe this might have some correlation with vmware provisioning and your ram to hard drive ratio.\nEven though in theory I had enough disk space, and ubuntu did not warn about space restraints like it normally would, I believe because it was a close ratio this caused grub to fail.  \nGrub installs after almost every other package.  \nIn my case I had 1gb ram, 2gb volume.

Example scenario: Let's say I'm on my desktop and I do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*open a full-screen window in application A\n\n*open two half-screen windows (tiled to the left and right) in application B\n\n*go back to the desktop (with CTRL+Super+D)\n\n*show the first window (application A).\n\n*move the mouse over the icon of application B\n\n*scroll the scroll wheel\n\n*\n\n*When I do this, I get the first window that was tiled to the right, and I see application A in the background. So far, everything is good.\n\n\n*scroll the scroll wheel again (to try to see the second window of application A)\n\n*\n\n*Here's when the problem occurs. When I try doing this, the first window from application B disappears, and the second window shows.

Right now I'm sticking the mouse to the left edge of the screen and clicking the icon to get the \"open windows\" dialog thingy and opening both manually, but there must be a quicker and more efficient way.\n\nA: I like the shortcut Super+` (a backtick). Similar to alt tab, Super+` switches between windows of the same application.  \nSo if app B1 is in focus on the right, and you press Super+` app B2 will appear  with focus on the left.  \nNote that the apps will have the same geometry they had the last time they were in focus, so if you put app B1 on the right and app B2 on the right, app B2 will appear over app B1. This is rather obvious, but I'm saying it anyway.\n", "Q: How can I re-order the activities in KDE? I would like to be able to manually edit the order of my Activities in KDE.

In the config editor of Thunderbird I have checked that 'network.protocol-handler.external-default' is set to 'true'. I have also added 'network.protocol-handler.app.http' to the config (linking to /usr/bin/firefox) to no avail.\n\nA: I remember I was having that issue, too.\nThe first thing I did was try to unset the value network.protocol-handler.app.http to let Thunderbird prompt me for the application.

Instead of creating a new profile, first tried to go to Preferences --> Advanced --> Config editor and set\nnetwork.protocol-handler.warn-external.http;true\nnetwork.protocol-handler.warn-external.https;true\n\nThis didn't help, so I then went and moved mimeTypes.rdf from my profile directory. I restarted Thunderbird, and now it asked which application I would like to use to open URLs.\nJust letting TB to recreate mimeTypes.rdf would have probably been enough, since my default browser was set up correctly. The old mimeTypes.rdf had settings from old environment, which obviously weren't working anymore.\n", "Q: Hovering the top bar maximizes window I have CompizConfig Manager installed, Grid enabled by default (I like it).\nBut if I have a window open half way and hover at the top black bar it maximizes the window.

If not, is there any plugin for that?\n\nA: Although xmonad and i3 are good guesses, this is actually tmux, a terminal multiplexer (I know because I use it constantly).  It is an invaluable tool that allows you to create and manage multiple sessions (like browser windows), tabs (like browser tabs), and panes (like multiple tabs shown at once, as seen in your screenshot).  You can get it by installing the tmux package (sudo apt-get install tmux), and I highly recommend starting off with this excellent tutorial.\nMost of the tmux \"panes\" with colored text are vim instances.  vim is a unique and immensely powerful text editor.  Check out first this primer, and then this tutorial.  If you ever have to do any significant amount of programming, vim will be one of your best friends.\n\nA: This looks like xmonad window manager (see this screenshot). It is OK if most of the things you do is in various terminal sessions but I found it a bit annoying when dealing with multi-window apps (like gimp or skype).\n", "Q: How do I convert videos to H.265/HEVC format in Ubuntu? I see that H.265/HEVC encoding is gathering momentum but under some versions of Ubuntu it is not all that easy to produce H.265 video streams. \nHow should I go about using x265, in a manner that integrates with Ubuntu (especially the LTS releases Trusty and Xenial), to produce HEVC video files under Ubuntu?\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*x265 HEVC Encoder: The commandline encoder\n\n*x265: Videolan site\n\n\nA: The best solution so far on my system has been:\n\n\n*\n\n*For Trusty Tahr 14.04 LTS: use an up to date FFmpeg and the most recent x265, which necessitates some compiling and subsequent packaging\n\n*For Xenial Xerus 16.04 LTS: simply run:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg  libavcodec-extra\n\nWith either of the previous methods then use the following:\nffmpeg -i input \\\n   -c:v libx265 -preset slow -x265-params crf=22 \\\n   -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k \\\n   output.mp4\n\nNote that this creates an mp3 audio stream as well as an h.265 video stream. To create an aac stream the line -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k could be replaced with the following:\n-c:a aac -strict experimental -b:a 128k\n\nThe -strict experimental option will not be required if your copy of FFmpeg was released after December 2015 when development of the native aac encoder matured. Bear in mind that this option will still be required for the repository FFmpeg for Xenial Xerus 16.04 LTS.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*FFmpeg trac: FFmpeg and H.265 Encoding Guide\n\n*FFmpeg git: aacenc: remove the experimental flag\n\nA: Method 01\nYou can install Internet friendly media encoder:\n\nRun these commands in your Terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:upubuntu-com/multimedia  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install ifme\n\nNow you can open the program ifme from Dash.\nsource\nMethod 02\nOnce you compiled the program following the instructions in here or here,  first you have to encode the video into YUV format:\navconv -i MyVideo.mp4 MyVideo.yuv\n\nThen you can convert YUV video into x265 format:\n./x265 --input-res 640x360 --fps 24000/100 MyVideo.yuv -o MyVideo.h265\n\n\nA: This script worked for me:\nffmpeg -i input_file.mpg -pix_fmt yuv420p -f yuv4mpegpipe - |\\\n     x265-10bit --profile main10 --preset slower --crf 20 --input - --y4m -o output_file.mpg\n\n\nA: Start VLC with the file you wish to convert, stop the video from playing, reset to start of file, then open the media menu, select the convert/save option, select H265 and MP3, then give the file a new name using the output file selection, and wait for the process to finish.

The parts that are concatenated to the command string are supposed to be separated by pipes to facilitate a \"streaming\" of data through each component.\nA very simplified example:\n#!/bin/bash\npart1=gzip -c\npart2=some_other_command\ncmd=\"cat infile\"\n\nif [ ! \"$part1\" = \"\" ]\nthen\n    cmd+=\" | $part1\"\nfi\n\n\nif [ ! \"$part2\" = \"\" ]\nthen\n    cmd+=\" | $part2\"\nfi\n\n\ncmd+=\"> outfile\"\n#show command.

When I run this script i get different error messages relating usually to the first part of the command (before the first pipe).\nSo my question is whether or not it is possible to build a command in this way, and what is the best way to do it?\n\nA: One solution to this, for future reference, is to use \"eval\". This ensures that whatever way the string is interpreted by bash is forgotten and the whole thing is read as if it was typed directly in a shell (which is exactly what we want).\nSo in the example above, replacing\n$cmd\n\nwith\neval $cmd\n\nsolved it.\n\nA: It all depends on when things get evaluated. When you type $cmd, the whole rest of the line is passed as arguments to the first word in $cmd.  \nwalt@spong:~(0)$ a=\"cat /etc/passwd\"\nwalt@spong:~(0)$ b=\"| wc -l\"\nwalt@spong:~(0)$ c=\"$a $b\"\nwalt@spong:~(0)$ echo $c\ncat /etc/passwd | wc -l\nwalt@spong:~(0)$ $c\ncat: invalid option -- 'l'\nTry 'cat --help' for more information.\nwalt@spong:~(1)$ eval $c\n62\nwalt@spong:~(0)$ a=\"echo /etc/passwd\"\nwalt@spong:~(0)$ c=\"$a $b\"\nwalt@spong:~(0)$ echo $c\necho /etc/passwd | wc -l\nwalt@spong:~(0)$ $c\n/etc/passwd | wc -l\nwalt@spong:~(0)$ $c |od -bc\n0000000 057 145 164 143 057 160 141 163 163 167 144 040 174 040 167 143  \n          /   e   t   c   /   p   a   s   s   w   d       |       w   c  \n0000020 040 055 154 012  \n              -   l  \\n  \n0000024\nwalt@spong:~(0)$ eval $c\n1  \n\nThis shows that the arguments passed to the echo command are: \"/etc/passwd\", \"|\" (the vertical bar character), \"wc\" and \"-l\".  \nFrom man bash:  \neval [arg ...]  \n    The  args  are read and concatenated together into   \n    a single command.  This command is then read and  \n    executed by the shell, and its exit status is returned  \n    as the value of eval.  If there are no args, or only null  \n    arguments, eval returns 0.\n\n\nA: @waltinator already explained why this does not work as you expected. Another way around it is to use bash -c to execute your command:\n$ comm=\"cat /etc/passwd\"\n$ comm+=\"| wc -l\"\n$ $comm\ncat: invalid option -- 'l'\nTry 'cat --help' for more information.\n$ bash -c \"$comm\"\n51\n\n\nA: Possibly a better way to do this is to avoid using eval and just using a Bash array and it's inline expansion to build up all the arguments and then execute them against the command.\nruncmd=() # This is slightly messier than declare -a but works\nfor cmd in $part1 $part2 $part3; do runcmd+=\"| $cmd \"; done\ncat infile ${runcmd[@]} # You might be able to do $basecmd ${runcmd[@]}\n# but that sometimes requires an `eval` which isn't great\n\n", "Q: Chrome not accepting US international with dead keys keyboard 14.04 Using 14.04 with keyboard selected as 'US international with dead keys' as my keyboard layout option, (so that I may use characters from other languages) and the system accepts text input as you would expect.\nChrome however fails to recognise what keyboard I have set in system settings, no dead key input is detected or used by Chrome at all, frustratingly.\nI updated from M34 to Version 36.0.1985.125 to no avail :(\n\nA: Here a late solution (that worked at least for me) \nOpen terminal in your home directory.

One peculiar thing is that before the grub menu loads, I see the following message for about a second:\nCould not open \"\\EFT\\BOOT\\fallback.efi\": 14\nerror: file \"/boot/\" not found.\n\nDoes anyone know how I can troubleshoot this issue? It obviously seems to be video related, but I'm not sure what's causing it.\n\nA: As Bain suggested, adding the \"nomodeset\" parameter solved this issue for me.\nFrom the GRUB menu when the Ubuntu installer boots, use 'e' to edit the boot parameters. Use the arrow keys to get down to the kernel line (which will probably include things like \"nosplash\" or \"root=...\". To this line, add \"nomodeset\" and then you can hit Ctrl-x or F10 to continue booting with the new parameters.\nThis should get you to the installer environment. If this works, you can continue installing Ubuntu, but the installer isn't going to put \"nomodeset\" in the GRUB config on the hard drive. So, when the installer reboots, you'll need to do this again when the GRUB menu from the hard drive comes up. Then, when you get to your Ubuntu desktop, run Terminal, and from there, edit /etc/default/grub:\nsudo vim /etc/default/grub\n\nand look for the line that says:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"....\"\n\nand add \"nomodeset\" to that line, and then save. Then, tell GRUB to refresh it's menu file with:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThen, you should be good to go.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 mouse not working but detected I have a Razer Imperator mouse that used to work just fine until yesterday.\nlsusb, xinput and dmesg all correctly list the mouse, but yet it doesn't work.\nCan anyone give some tips on how to debug this?\nUbuntu 14.04 with everything up to date.\n\nA: I've been having this problem since I got Ubuntu, My mouse would work for like 30 minutes after each time i started the computer and even though the hardware was visible in lsusb the mouse wouldn't move and the lights on my razer imperator wouldn't light up.

There's an update daemon that checks on a schedule, at least if you configure it to do so, so the odds are you're \"probably\" going to get the latest version if you don't manually run apt-get update .  However, it's a best practice to do apt-get update first just to make sure that your package manager is aware of all of the software versions currently available in the repos.  Canonical is not like Microsoft, they don't publish updates only on certain days, at least that I'm aware of, so there could have been a new version of something uploaded at any moment, so it's always a good idea to do an apt-get update first to make sure your package manager is aware of that.\n", "Q: Difference in Use between pwd and $PWD To print current/present working directory environment variable $PWD and command pwd are available. So, What is difference in usage of both? or What should be chose for specific purpose?\n\nA: Both will return the same result if you use them without options for all working directories, including when in symbolic links.\nHowever, from man pwd:\n-P, --physical\n    avoid all symlinks\n\nThis would mean executing pwd -P when in symbolic links which point to some other directories will print the path to the original directory.\nAs an example, if you have a symbolic link /var/run that points to /run and you are currently in /var/run/ directory, executing\necho $PWD\n\nwill return:\n/var/run\n\nand will be the same for pwd. However, if you execute:\npwd -P\n\nwill return\n/run\n\nThus, it depends which path you require: the actual path without symbolic links or the present directory ignoring the symbolic links. The only difference between between pwd -P and echo $PWD is when there are symbolic links.\n\nA: That depends on what you're doing. First of all, $PWD is an environment variable and pwd is a shell builtin or an actual binary:\n$ type -a pwd\npwd is a shell builtin\npwd is /bin/pwd\n\nNow, the bash builtin will simply print the current value of $PWD unless you use the -P flag. As explained in help pwd:\npwd: pwd [-LP]\nPrint the name of the current working directory.\n\nOptions:\n  -L    print the value of $PWD if it names the current working\n    directory\n  -P    print the physical directory, without any symbolic links\n\nBy default, `pwd' behaves as if `-L' were specified.\n\nThe pwd binary, on the other hand, gets the current directory through the getcwd(3) system call which returns the same value as readlink -f /proc/self/cwd. To illustrate, try moving into a directory that is a link to another one:\n$ ls -l\ntotal 4\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 terdon terdon 4096 Jun  4 11:22 foo\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 terdon terdon    4 Jun  4 11:22 linktofoo -> foo/\n$ cd linktofoo\n$ echo $PWD\n/home/terdon/foo/linktofoo\n$ pwd\n/home/terdon/foo/linktofoo\n$ /bin/pwd\n/home/terdon/foo/foo\n\nSo, in conclusion, on GNU systems (such as Ubuntu), pwd and echo $PWD are equivalent unless you use the -P option but /bin/pwd is different and behaves like pwd -P.\n", "Q: Chrome dock icon looks blurry and low resolution Whenever I launch Chrome my icon never looks right and I can't open new windows by right clicking and selecting.

Good luck!\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu MAAS free? Ubuntu MAAS, very cool, awesome in fact, looks like a unique tool for several jobs.\nIt looks free, but part of its documentation starts already with clauses that would scare anyone with interest in it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Documentation is copy righted by Canonical;\n\n*Documentation must be used only for non-commercial purposes;\n\n*If documentation is distributed within the non-commercial clause you must retain copyright;\n\n\nIt just sounds a lot for a guide on how to install MAAS + Juju + Openstack and that scares me a bit.  Why does documentation built from the community prevent me from doing anything except look at it? We produce a guide, but I cannot take it to work and look at it or show it as a possible tool that my company would be interested in using or contributing to?\nMy question is then: Under what license is Ubuntu MAAS distributed and what would be the reasoning for being so worried about copyrighting a simple guide like that so heavily? Is Ubuntu MAAS free?\n\nA: I suspect they're just trying to stop people nicking portions of the documentation for their own nefarious purposes but no, by all measures that matter to people like us, that document is not free.\nBut the MAAS packages in the main repos all use the AGPL3 license:\nMAAS is Copyright 2012 Canonical Ltd.\n\nCanonical Ltd (\"Canonical\") distributes the MAAS source code\nunder the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 (\"AGPLv3\").\nThe full text of this licence is given below.\n\nThird-party copyright in this distribution is noted where applicable.\n\nAll rights not expressly granted are reserved.\n\nAGPL3 is a pretty strange license if you haven't seen it before. It's just like GPL3 except for an additional clause, paraphrased on the \"Why AGPL?\" GNU page:\n\nif you run the program on a server and let other users communicate with it there, your server must also allow them to download the source code corresponding to the program that it's running. If what's running there is your modified version of the program, the server's users must get the source code as you modified it.\n\nIt's undoubtedly free but while most free software licenses let you keep website modifications to yourself, this requires you make them available. That could be important. It might be too free for your purposes. It's an interesting license.\nWill it always be free? Probably. Standard open-source logic applies here:\n\n\n*\n\n*If they own the code, they could release future versions as non-free, for-money (or otherwise) releases and stop releasing under AGPL.\n\n*But Canonical can't stop people redistributing the current version.\n\n*And they couldn't stop somebody continuing development and/or redistributing a fork of the current version (provided it uses another name).\n\n\nLike a lot of project starters, Canonical gets extended permissions from contributors to its projects. I can't remember what the current name for this copyright agreement but it would make it extremely easy for Canonical to release closed-source versions of its products... But again, they can't stop the current versions from being [A]GPL.\n\nA: The MAAS source code is distributed under AGPLv3. Assuming there are no additional clauses concerning distribution or usage, it becomes effectively free (even if the code needs to be compiled). \nBut will further releases retain this License? Naturally no one in the community can answer this question. Even if Canonical themselves wish to retain this License, future policy changes are unpredictable (the company can be acquired, merged or simply disbanded).\nIf having MAAS open sourced is crucial to your company/institution, then the wisest procedure is to legally bind Canonical into it. This would involve firming a contract by which Canonical legally commits to maintain the software and release future versions under an agreed license (or picking from a pre-determined set of licenses). In such scenario, and assuming your company is also seeded in the EU, the wisest option is the EUPL.\nMy advice would be for your company/institution to contact Canonical Legal inquiring for the possibility of such a contract. Even if you do not really intend to firm such contract, their receptiveness, or lack thereof, might already tell you where they are headed.\nIf your company/institution does not have the legal skills/resources to deal with these issues, I would advise you to seek help from OSOR.\n\nA: The text quoted in the comment shows that at least the documentation is non-free.\nThe Launchpad page for MAAS, which seems to be the most detailed source, says on 2015-05-21\nGNU Affero GPL v3, Other/Proprietary (temporary)\n...\nThis project’s licence is proprietary.\n\nSo it seems that MAAS is at least partially under a proprietary licence. It's hard to find out exactly what that licence might be, and it's not present in the source tree.\nCanonical seems to hold that in addition to the source code licence declared in the tree, they have other rights over software they publish, declared in http://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/intellectual-property-policy. \nThis page talks specifically about Ubuntu, but applies to all their trademarks and other intellectual property rights and so would seem to include MAAS. It imposes some limitations on redistribution of collections of software, themes, and installer images. \nIt's not clear to me exactly how they intend this to be interpreted but it does seem they believe there are further restrictions on how you can use the software beyond what's granted by the source tree's licences.\nSee also, this question about selling computers with Ubuntu pre-installed and restrictions on commercial use.\n\nA: You have to understand that Canonical makes a living by supporting (for money) software which is free (to distribute). This document is relevant to support MAAS, which is free. So, to address your 3 points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Canonical copyright license - that's automatic anyway, as they wrote it.\n\n*Non-commercial use - don't compete with Canonical using Canonical resources\n\n*Retain copyright clause - fairly obvious, you can't just strip legal conditions.\n\n", "Q: Sudo apt-get update problem 12.04 Please Guys help me to fix this issues with update my Ubuntu 12.04 desktop:\nGet:38 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com precise/universe Translation-en [3,341 kB]\nFetched 24.5 MB in 7min 9s (57.1 kB/s)                                         \nW: Failed to fetch http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/i18n/Index  No Hash entry in Release file /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/extras.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_precise_main_i18n_Index\nE: Some index files failed to download.

I know how to change the volume using pactl set-sink-volume, but that is only set temporarily. I could write a script that is run at startup, but it will not be applied if I connect a sink later. (i.e. a Bluetooth speaker)\nIs there a config file where I can set the default volume that is given to a device when it is first loaded by PulseAudio?  Or even the master volume at startup?\nClarification: The application is for a headless linux box, so the system shouldn't have to be rebooted and should be able to accept new devices without having to connect via ssh to adjust volumes, etc.  \n\nA: What worked for me was to go into /home/(user)/.config/pulse/default.pa and scroll to the bottom to set-sink-volume and change the value to 0\n\nA: Set the volume to your desired level and then type in a terminal:\nsudo alsactl store\n\nNow, it should be stored even after reboot.\n\nA: With PulseAudio 8.0 on Ubuntu 16.04 and a single sound card, you can set the default master volume to 50% with the following file. By including the system default you don't have to worry about changes in the distribution's defaults. \n$ cat ~/.config/pulse/default.pa\n.include /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\n# Set volume to 50% on boot\nset-sink-volume 0 32768\n\nIf you have multiple cards, replace the index number with the name since order is not guaranteed. In addition, if you want to adjust the volume determine the \"base volume\" which represents the max and calculate the equivalent percentage.\n$ pacmd list-sinks | grep -e \"name:\" -e \"index:\" -e \"base volume:\"\n  * index: 0\n    name: <alsa_output.card0>\n    base volume: 65536 / 100% / 0.00 dB\n  * index: 1\n    name: <alsa_output.card1>\n    base volume: 32768 / 100% / 0.00 dB\n\nFor example, to specify the default volume of 70% for card1 the line would become:\nset-sink-volume alsa_output.card1 22937\n\n\nA: You can create separate script and run it from the startup so every time you reboot the system it check the particular sink volume.\nHere is the script:\n export sink_index=$(pactl list short sinks | awk -v index_number=<sink_name> '$2==index_number {print $1}')\n            volume=$(pactl list sinks | perl -000ne 'if(/#$ENV{sink_index}/){/(Volume:.*)/; print \"$1\\n\"}' | sed 's/.*\\ \\(.*\\)%.*/\\1/g')\n            if [ $volume -ne 100 ]; then\n                pactl set-sink-volume $sink_index 100%\n            fi\n\nThe sink_name should be your bluetooth sink or sink that you want to set volume.\nYou can find the bluetooth sink from:\npactl list short sinks | grep \"alsa_output\" | awk '{ print $2 }' | head -n1\n\nHope these will help you.\n", "Q: Iptables Issue can't SSH Remote Machines I want to SSH to 192.168.1.15 Server from my machine, my ip was 192.168.1.99\nSource Destination was UP, with IP 192.168.1.15.\nThis is LAN Network there are 30 Machine's Connected to the network and working fine, I'm Playing around the local machine's cos i need to apply the same rules in Production VPS\nI have applied the below iptables in my machine 192.168.1.99, Now i can't receive any packets from Outside and i can't send any packets Outside, While applying the Below Chain\niptables -P INPUT DROP\niptables -P OUTPUT DROP\niptables -P FORWARD DROP\n\nAfter the above CHAIN i have added the Below rules and it want to allow ssh from machine to 192.168.1.15 to access the 192.164.1.15 but still i can't access 192.168.1.15\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 22 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -o eth0 --sport 22 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --sport 22 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n\nAny one Please Check Weather my Rules are Wrigt.

Nagios doesn't send any notification for SOFT state, only in case of HARD state.\nFrom the Nagios documentation :\n\nSoft States\nSoft states occur for services and hosts in the following situations...\n1) When a service or host check results in a non-OK state and it has not yet been (re)checked the number of times specified by the  option in the service or host definition. Let's call this a soft error state...\n2) When a service or host recovers from a soft error state. This is considered to be a soft recovery. \nSoft State Events\nWhat happens when a service or host is in a soft error state or experiences a soft >recovery?\n1) The soft error or recovery is logged if you enabled the log_service_retries or log_host_retries options in the main configuration file.\n2) Event handlers are executed (if you defined any) to handle the soft error or recovery for the service or host. (Before any event handler is executed, the $STATETYPE$ macro is set to \"SOFT\").\n      Nagios does not send out notifications to any contacts because there is (or was) no \"real\" problem with the service or host. \nAs can be seen, the only important thing that really happens during a soft state is the execution of event handlers. Using event handlers can be particularly useful if you want to try and proactively fix a problem before it turns into a hard state.\nHard States\nHard states occur for hosts and services in the following situations:\n1) When a host or service check results in a non-UP or non-OK state and it has been (re)checked the number of times specified by the max_check_attempts option in the host or service definition. This is a hard error state.\n2) When a host or service transitions from one hard error state to another error state (e.g. WARNING to CRITICAL).\n3) When a service check results in a non-OK state and its corresponding host is either DOWN or UNREACHABLE.\n4) When a host or service recovers from a hard error state. This is considered to be a hard recovery.\n5) When a passive host check is received. Passive host checks are treated as HARD unless the passive_host_checks_are_soft option is enabled.\nThe following things occur when hosts or services experience HARD state changes:\n1) The HARD state is logged.\n  2) Event handlers are executed to handle the HARD state.\n  3) Contacts are notifified of the host or service problem or recovery. \n\nSo from what we see in the log you give in example, there was no need for Nagios to send a mail.\nYou should create an error condition on one of the monitored services, let this condition exists for a while and see if you really get the mail when the state is changed to HARD in the nagios.log.\nLast thing I've noticed, in your command line test, you send mail to support@xxxx.eu while in your contacts.cfg the mail address defined is supporto@xxxx.eu (maybe you have aliases defined on your mail servers maybe not).\nAdded after addition of logs to the question\nIn the nagios.log that you show, there is no SERVICE NOTIFICATION line, so even when the error is in HARD state, Nagios doesn't even try to do the notification. \nTo have notification working in Nagios, it is not sufficient to have the contacts, contact groups and notification commands well defined. \nYou must configure per service and host if you want to send notification in case of error and of course to which contact(s) and / or contact group(s) to send this notification. For instance, this is a service definition with notification configured and working :\ndefine service {\n    name                                  generic-service\n    first_notification_delay              0\n    notification_interval                 0\n    notification_options                  w,u,c,r\n    notifications_enabled                 1\n    check_period                          24x7\n    notification_period                   24x7\n    contact_groups                        admins\n}\n\nIn the above definition, notification_enabled is set on 1 (true) and a contact group as been given to send notification to. Also, we define which kind of notification to send - w(arning), u(nknown), c(ritical) and r(ecovery).\nThe above definition is used as a template by all my services :\nuse generic-service\n\nis present in all my services definitions. This way, if I need to change notification options, I just have to change the generic-service definition.\nIn your case, your config shows that your service is using a template called generic-service.\nI would advice to check its definition to see if notification are configured like the example I gave above. Its definition can be located into a file called services-templates.cfg but this can vary.\n\nA: Thanks Benoit for your answer. I'd like to add a couple of things after fiddling with it for a while:\nEasy to know where you stand with all those templates and overrides if you view the cache file, which is the computed result of all configurations:\n/usr/local/nagios/var/objects.cache\nAfter I've been there it hit me.. my service was set to send notifications only in work hours, which ended up a bit wrong for me because I'm on a different time zone compared with the server. Changing it to 24x7 made it all work like a charm.\nI hope this will help someone.. Spent hours figuring all this out.\nCheers!\n\nA: The most helpful information was to croscheck the content of /usr/local/nagios/var/objects.cache to validate all inheritances of all .cfg's.\nThat was now also solving my issues.\n", "Q: How can I get the name of the current terminal from command-line? Is there a possibility to get the type of terminal with a command?\nIf I'm using gnome-terminal, the output should be gnome-terminal or something similar. It would be also nice to get the version of the terminal.  \nUpdate \nps -aux | grep `ps -p $$ -o ppid=` \n\nwill output something like this:\nuser     4239  0.0  0.7 292708 15744 pts/8    Sl   11:39   0:02 xfce4-terminal\nuser     4800  0.0  0.0   6176   820 pts/0    S+   12:23   0:00 grep --color=auto  4239\n\nThis will also work with xterm, but how do I get only the name (xfce4-terminal in this case)?\n\nA: Try this,\nps -aux | grep `ps -p $$ -o ppid=` | awk 'NR==1{print $11}'\n\nOR\nps -aux | grep `ps -p $$ -o ppid=` | awk 'NR==1{print $NF}'\n\n\nA: ##Original version\nOne way to do this is to get the parent process of your current shell session and from there the name of the terminal.\n\n*\n\n*Get the parent of the current shell process. The bash variable $$ is the PID of your current shell, so we can give that as a query to ps (-p $$) and ask it tp print the PID of the parent process (-o ppid=, the trailing = is to avoid printing column headers):\n $ ps -p $$ -o ppid=\n 544\n\nSo, the PID of my shell's parent is 544.\n\n\n*Get the process associated with that PID and print its command line\n $ ps -p 544 o args=\n /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/terminator\n\nThe above output will depend on what terminal emulator you are using, I am using terminator.\n\n\n*Combine everything in a single command\n ps -p $(ps -p $$ -o ppid=) -o args=\n\n\n\n*Use that to get the version\n $(ps -p $(ps -p $$ -o ppid=) o args=) --version\n terminator 0.97\n\n\n\n*Add a little function to your ~/.bashrc that returns the name and version of the terminal emulator you're using (this works for most common terminal emulators):\n which_term(){\n     term=$(ps -p $(ps -p $$ -o ppid=) -o args=);\n     found=0;\n     case $term in\n         *gnome-terminal*)\n             found=1\n             echo \"gnome-terminal \" $(dpkg -l gnome-terminal | awk '/^ii/{print $3}')\n             ;;\n         *lxterminal*)\n             found=1\n             echo \"lxterminal \" $(dpkg -l lxterminal | awk '/^ii/{print $3}')\n             ;;\n         rxvt*)\n             found=1\n             echo \"rxvt \" $(dpkg -l rxvt | awk '/^ii/{print $3}')\n             ;;\n         ## Try and guess for any others\n         *)\n             for v in '-version' '--version' '-V' '-v'\n             do\n                 $term \"$v\" &>/dev/null && eval $term $v && found=1 && break\n             done\n             ;;\n     esac\n     ## If none of the version arguments worked, try and get the \n     ## package version\n     [ $found -eq 0 ] && echo \"$term \" $(dpkg -l $term | awk '/^ii/{print $3}')    \n }\n\nYou can now get the name of the terminal and also pass any option you like to it (such as --version.\nSome examples using different terminals:\n\n*\n\n*xterm\n $ which_term\n XTerm(297)\n\n\n\n*terminator\n $ which_term \n terminator 0.97\n\n\n\n*rxvt, this one has none of the -V, -version or --version flags so no version info is printed.\n $  which_term\n rxvt  1:2.7.10-5\n\n\n\n*gnome-terminal.\n $ which_term\n gnome-terminal  3.10.1-1\n\n\n\n*konsole\n $ which_term\n Qt: 4.8.6\n KDE Development Platform: 4.11.3\n Konsole: 2.11.3\n\n\n\n*lxterminal\n $ which_term\n lxterminal  0.1.11-4\n\n\n\n*xfce4-terminal\n $ which_term\n xfce4-terminal 0.6.2 (Xfce 4.10)\n\n Copyright (c) 2003-2012\n     The Xfce development team.

It will choke when you run your shell after suing to another user or when your terminal is aliased to something and various other cases. Since we are obviously working with X programs here, a better way might be to use something like xdotool (installable with sudo apt-get install xdotool) to get the information instead:\nperl -lpe 's/\\0/ /g' /proc/$(xdotool getwindowpid $(xdotool getactivewindow))/cmdline\n\nThe above will print the command line used to launch the currently active window. Since your terminal will, presumably, be active, that is the command it will show. This means that for most terminal emulators, you can safely assume that the 1st field returned is the terminal name:\n$ which_term \nlxterminal \n\nThis means that getting the version is trivial. For example\n$ dpkg -l $(which_term) | awk '/^ii/{print $3}'\n0.1.11-4\n\nNot so for gnome-terminal:\n$ which_term \n/usr/lib/gnome-terminal/gnome-terminal-server \n\nor terminator:\n$ which_term\n/usr/bin/python /usr/bin/terminator \n\nSo, we can make it a little more complex (there are some bashisms here, this one is not portable):\nwhich_term(){\n    term=$(perl -lpe 's/\\0/ /g' \\\n           /proc/$(xdotool getwindowpid $(xdotool getactivewindow))/cmdline)\n\n    ## Enable extended globbing patterns\n    shopt -s extglob\n    case $term in\n        ## If this terminal is a python or perl program,\n        ## then the emulator's name is likely the second \n        ## part of it\n        */python*|*/perl*    )\n         term=$(basename \"$(readlink -f $(echo \"$term\" | cut -d ' ' -f 2))\")\n         version=$(dpkg -l \"$term\" | awk '/^ii/{print $3}')\n         ;;\n        ## The special case of gnome-terminal\n        *gnome-terminal-server* )\n          term=\"gnome-terminal\"\n        ;;\n        ## For other cases, just take the 1st\n        ## field of $term\n        * )\n          term=${term/% */}\n        ;;\n     esac\n     version=$(dpkg -l \"$term\" | awk '/^ii/{print $3}')\n     echo \"$term  $version\"\n}\n\nThis works for all cases I tested on.\n\nA: You can try the following command:\n$ dpkg-query -W $COLORTERM\ngnome-terminal  3.6.2-0ubuntu1\n\nUpdate (thanks to OP and Avinash Raj):\n$ dpkg-query -W $(ps -aux | grep \"`ps -p $$ -o ppid=`\" | awk 'NR==1{print $11}' | xargs basename)\nrxvt    1:2.7.10-5\n\n\nA: Another (not perfect) possibility is:\nxprop -id $WINDOWID WM_CLASS | cut -d\" \" -f3 | sed 's/^.\\(.*\\)..$/\\1/'\n\nBut this does not work with lxterminal because there is the environment variable $WINDOWID empty...\nTerminator shows the name \"x-terminal-emulator\".\n\nA: The name of the terminal might be set in your environment variables. \necho $TERM\n\nExamples: \n$ echo $TERM\nxterm\n\n\nA: basename \"$(cat \"/proc/$PPID/comm\")\"\n\n$PPID is the PID of the shell's parent process. comm means command. It may or may not be a full path, so we use basename to strip the path if needed.\nCaveats\nThese probably apply to at least some of the other answers too.\n\n\n*\n\n*comm is technically argv[0], which can actually be an arbitrary string. But in general, you should be able to rely on it for this particular case.\n\n*This won't work as expected if you connect over SSH or use tmux, screen or something similar.\n\nA: The current terminal can also be detected via an escape sequence: The Device Attributes (Secondary DA)\nFor example in bash:\nread -s -dc -p $'\\E[>c' da;da=${da##$'\\E'[>};echo \"${da//;/ }\"\n\nThis returns only some kind of id - and sadly I don't know an official list that translate these to the actual names.\n\nFor a real implementation, that translates some known ids to terminal names, see this example bash script:\nhttps://github.com/mintty/utils/blob/master/terminal\n", "Q: Installation of 14.04 on Asus Zenbook UX301LA alongside Windows I am afraid I messed up things pretty badly while trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 or Mint 17 on a brand new Asus Zenbook UX301LA.

Is there any solution for this problem by developing a .sh script for example or using any other programming language ?\n\nA: VirtualBox has a command line utility called VBoxManage that can be used to control virtual machines (VMs). You can read the documentation here: Chapter 8. VBoxManage.\nThe command to start a VM is:\nVBoxManage startvm <NameOfVMHere>\n\nIf the name of your VM has spaces, you have to enclose it in \"quotations\". You can use the following command to list your VMs to see their names:\nVBoxManage list vms\n\nArmed with this information, you can now create a script that will run this command for you under the conditions you want. You did not mention what is this \"particular moment\" you want to start the VM in, so we cannot further help you with the script.\nAlso, it is worth noting that there is a lot more to the VBoxManage command.

Please don't waste your time if these statements aren't true:\n\n*\n\n*ls /sys/class/backlight/ returns acpi_video0 and exactly one other, such as intel_backlight\n\n\n*echo 450 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness makes your brightness about half, and echo 900 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness makes full brightness.\n(Here you should be replacing intel_backlight with whatever you found in step 1 and replacing 450 and 900 according to your device's maximum brightness setting, which is found by the command cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness or your equivalent.)\nIn this case your problem is likely to be because the system has added the acpi_video0 module incorrectly, and the brightness keys use this instead of intel_backlight (or your equivalent).\nTo solve this, you need to add the boot option\nacpi_backlight=none which will remove the directory acpi_video0  from /sys/class/backlight/. The brightness keys now apply their logic to the only directory in /sys/class/backlight/ which is what we want.\nI gleaned this knowledge from this helpful page https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/backlight which states that \"If you find that changing the acpi_video0 backlight does not actually change the brightness, you may need to use acpi_backlight=none.\"\n\nA: For MANJARO 18 users:\nI have a LENOVO with hybrid GPU, but I'm using just the NVIDIA card.

But it was at full intensity and nothing I tried would control it.\nI tried lots of other fixes I've seen here including: grub editing with acpi_backlight=vendor, installing brightness controllers, echoing values into backlight files, even tinkering with intel vs nvidia drivers in case that was the issue etc. No joy.\nI came across this info on setting up my model (XPS 15 7590, OLED screen) with Arch Linux where the brightness was an issue there, and tried following that method: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_15_7590#Backlight \nThere was a script based on that (https://github.com/lurwas/oled-brightness-ubuntu) which looked helpful but didn't work for me. \nUntil I realised that in the ArchLinux page it mentions\n\nPlease note: If you are using the xf86-video-intel driver, you will need to replace 'eDP-1' in the script above with 'eDP1' \n\nSure enough, my system seemed to be looking for instructions relating to 'eDP1' and everything else was telling it to change 'eDP-1'.  The dash made all the difference. \nI set up that script as a start-up program, checking I had 'bc' and 'inotify-tools' installed as mentioned in the Arch Linux instructions (though note that page refers to 'itnotify-tool', and ubuntu required the 's' on the end to find/install it!) and made sure it had run permissions, and BOOM - \"let there be LESS light!\".\nThe script is run at start-up, and my backlight keys now actively change the screen brightness.\nHope this might be helpful, in case you have a similar underlying problem. I'm not sure if this fix is possibly just for an OLED-specific issue, so your milage may vary.\n\nA: Installing GPU drivers fixed brightness control for me.\n$ sudo apt install nvidia-detect\n$ nvidia-detect\nDetected NVIDIA GPUs:\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation Device [10de:25b8] (rev a1)\n\nChecking card:  NVIDIA Corporation Device 25b8 (rev a1)\nYour card is supported by the default drivers.\nYour card is also supported by the Tesla 460 drivers series.\nIt is recommended to install the\n    nvidia-driver\npackage.\n\n$ sudo apt install nvidia-tesla-460-driver\n$ sudo reboot\n\nHardware: Dell Precision 7560 laptop, NVIDIA RTX A2000 / GA107GLM.\nThe packages require non-free to be enabled in sources.list.\nI tried the options that yqbk mentioned, grub settings and xorg config, but none of these worked. I also couldn't read the correct brightness value from /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/{actual_,}brightness. After driver installation, the directory is gone and /sys/class/backlight/nvidia_0/ appeared in its place; now setting echo 10 > brightness works as expected.\n\nA: It's technically NOT possible to adjust the default brightness of a standard terminal in Linux, but if it were possible to modify the /sys/backlight/*/brightness file, you could change the brightness.\nThe /sys filesystem will complain of input/output errors if you attempt to write to files in the /sys directory.  The system also may revert to other additional and unintentional settings if a user attempts to continue to write to files in the /sys directory and in my case and actually made my screen darker (without the option of allowing me to write or modify the aforemention brightness file in the /sys directory).\nBottom-line: If you're looking to do about anything graphical or sound related on your computing device, look elsewhere beyond the purveyors of electronic diarrhea and the developers of open source operating systems such as Linux.  Linux just \"isn't there\" in terms of a decent desktop multimedia experience.  Everyone knows that, including Linus.

Hope this helped, cheers. :D\nEDIT: Reason why bumblebee fails and \"cannot find driver\" is because of incorrect paths to nvidia driver libraries. What I do right now to make bumblebee work with any driver version I wish is changing following lines in /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf file:\n\n\n*\n\n*line 22: Driver=nvidia\n\n*line 55: KernelDriver=nvidia-_version_, i.e. nvidia-352\n\n*lines 58, 61: these lines contain paths to nvidia libraries and xorg modules. Paths probably start with /usr/lib/nvidia, /usr/lib32/nvidia, or /usr/lib/xorg. You should replace nvidia with nvidia-_version_, i.e. /usr/lib/nvidia-352. Pay attention: each line contains 2 paths, separated by colon or by comma. You should make changes to each path (DO NOT edit path that starts with /usr/lib/xorg).\n\n\nNote that if you want to use default drivers, _version_ should be current, i.e. line 52: KernelDriver=nvidia-current. I think that bumblebee comes preconfigured to use nvidia-current when package bumblebee-nvidia is installed (sudo apt-get install bumblebee-nvidia).\nIf done correctly, bumblebee should not report error finding drivers - this worked for me with numerous driver versions.\n", "Q: what is db_load?

I recently switch from OSX to Xubuntu 14.04 and I'm loving my new found freedom. For the most part I've managed to customize my Linux operating system to my needs and likes. But theres one feature I'm missing the most. I need to toss a bunch of items in a folder really fast, since I am working with lots of images and text files. \nIn OS X there was a nifty shortcut that manages the operation in one fell swoop so you don't have to make a folder and then take further action to populate it.

After reading about Google's attempt for end-to-end encryption with PGP keys, I noticed in their FAQ a section about exporting a key generated by their extension for use elsewhere. They say it's possible but that it requires GnuPG 2.1+ wherever you use it.\nI had been running 12.04 LTS at the time I generated mine and so my version of gpg was 1.4.x, does that mean I can't import my key into a tool that uses 2.x?\n\nA: That's right, if you have a key generated in End-To-End and want to use it in GnuPG, you have to use version 2.1, which is not officially released yet (still in beta). You can either look for third-party repositories which provide it, or compile it yourself.\n\nA: Google's end-to-end encryption plugin makes use of elliptic curve encryption, which is not supported but from GnuPG version 2.1 (and this is still a development version).\nBut you can go the other way round, and locally create a \"normal\" RSA key which you can then import to Google's plugin.\nAnyway: as the key stays in the plugin, you're at least not giving the private key to Google, but they still can use it for arbitrary operations without you knowing it. What runs inside a web browser is under control of the web site owner, not yours. Better use a mail client (eg. Thunderbird) with a GnuPG addon (eg. Enigmail) and configure it to use your Gmail account – more comfort, more security, better privacy.\nJust for the wording: the OpenPGP key version is in both cases v4, but elliptic curves are a rather new encryption algorithm not supported yet by stable GnuPG versions.\n\nA: Key version matters...  I assume the Brian meant to say GnuPG 2.0.  GnuPG 2.1 is not packaged for Ubuntu or Debian yet as it is still in beta.  One of the new features will be the inclusion of EC25519 keys which may not matter for most of us, but it does offer some significant performance increases.  \nAnd other things matter as well.  For example the defaults use a SHA1 hash and it should be changed because it has known weaknesses, but it isn't completely broken as is RC4 and perhaps MD5.  I highly recommend generating new keys using a stronger hash. See: http://keyring.debian.org/creating-key.html\nWhen I try out Google's End to End I will, as is part my personal PGP policy, only have the subkey on the system.  This way I can retain key signatures by revoking, or expiring, the subkey and generate a new one.  See: https://wiki.debian.org/Subkeys\nI should note the process of managing keys and subkeys could use some significant improvements in terms of usability.  And the process of fixing your keys if you generated it with SHA1 hashes is even less fun... \n", "Q: Uninstall Spotify? I was under the assumption it would work with wine, but was incorrect.

So, one chrome icon is the app that is running, highlighted with a blue dot underneath, and another is the one that is the app launcher.\nalso, weirdly, the icon that is representing the active window has a different icon.  the one that is the launcher is the nice, shiny square icon similar to Moku or Faenza.  the icon that is representing the active app is low res, blurry, and just the standard chrome circle.\nthe double icon problem also happens for firefox, which was already in the dock.  Firefox thankfully does not have the ugly icon problem though.  that is unique to chrome.\nother launchers such as the PCManFM one doesn't duplicate, and neither does my terminal launcher.\nany help?  thanks!\n\nA: These answers helped me:\nhttp://elementaryos.org/answers/plank-shows-duplicate-icons-for-some-apps-when-you-open-them\nNamely, copying /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop to /usr/share/applications/google-chrome-stable.desktop and replacing Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable with Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome in both files.\n", "Q: How do I open the preferences dialog in empathy under Ubuntu 14.04? I run empathy (version 3.8.6) under Gnome Shell (Gnome 3.10 environment) in Ubuntu 14.04. When I open it, I get the contact page but no menu is shown. I want to open the preferences dialog but I don't see a way to get there. Where is the menu? How can I open the preferences dialog?\n\nA: Try pressing Alt and typing prefer, then Enter. It opened it for me.\n\nA: The application menu of Empathy doesn't sit in the window that appears when you start the application (the contact list window). Instead, it lives by default in the top panel and can be accessed by clicking on the application name (\"Empathy\") in the top panel (which only appears if the application has the focus).\nI didn't see the menu since I deactivated this part of the top panel through the TaskBar Gnome Shell extension. I did this because seeing the current program name seemed useless to me and because I wasn't aware that a useful menu would hide there.\nNow I also found that the Gnome Tweak Tool allows me to decide whether the application menu is shown in the top bar or not. In the latter case it will be integrated in the main application window.\nThanks to all for answering!\n", "Q: Dual monitor - Desktop falls off the screen slightly I have a dual monitor setup where I have placed a 1280x1024 resolution monitor to the left and a 1920x1080 resolution monitor to the right. Internally it looks like Ubuntu (14.04) changes the total resolution to 3200x1080. So because I have placed the smaller monitor left, where the desktop's icons are oriented towards, the icons fall slightly off the screen. The 56 extra pixels ubuntu created at the bottom of my smaller monitor are filled with content, which obviously isn't visible. I have set \"Scale all window contents to match\" to the smaller monitor, but that didn't change much. Actually changing that setting doesn't change anything visibly or at least that I could see. So how do I go about changing how ubuntu handles this? Or should I always keep the bigger monitor (in height) to the left as a rule of thumb?\nAdded screenshot for clarity. For example file11 falls off the screen now.\n\n\nA: I am having the same problem with multi-monitors and right-click \"organize desktop by name\".\nSome of the icons go off the visible screen and I have to ctrl-A to bring them back into view.\n\nA: There might be a way to adjust this using your monitor rather than through the OS.  \nSome monitors have built in \"auto-adjust picture\" functionality; otherwise, if you just click on the menu button on your monitor, and navigate around, there is probably a way to manually adjust the x-y position of the image. \n", "Q: Upstart: pipe the output of multiple commands I try to detect if there is a network link (cable plugged/unplugged) in an upstart script (Ubuntu 12.04). Here the relevant part of my script (which didndt work):\nscript\nif  [ /sbin/ethtool eth0 | /bin/grep \"Link detected: yes\" > /dev/null ] ; then\n    exec prog1\nelse\n    exec prog2\nfi\n\nend script\n\n(try to start prog1 if there is a link otherwise prog2.) How to fix that?\n\nA: The correct way to do this is to use\nif /sbin/ethtool eth0 | /bin/grep -q \"Link detected: yes\" ; then\n    exec prog1\nelse\n    exec prog2\nfi\n\nThe -q argument to grep will discard stdout, and the if statement checks the status of the command it runs. [ /sbin/ethtool eth0 | /bin/grep -q \"Link detected: yes\" ] is not a valid command, because [ is actually a program that accepts arguments like grep. So [ cannot understand /sbin/ethtool eth0 | /bin/grep -q \"Link detected: yes\" and it fails.\n\nA: You have to remember that Upstart runs shell code in /bin/sh (which is Dash), not /bin/bash. If you put your code into sh, it doesn't work:\n$ if  [ /sbin/ethtool eth0 | /bin/grep \"Link detected: yes\" > /dev/null ]; then echo cheese; fi\nsh: 9: [: missing ]\n/bin/grep: ]: No such file or directory\n\nSo there's a syntax issue in there. Rather than use the implicit status code check that bash uses, I'd consider breaking things up like so:\n/sbin/ethtool eth0 | /bin/grep \"Link detected: yes\" > /dev/null\nif  [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo cheese; fi\n\nThe above works for me in sh.\n\nOr you could force bash behaviour by wrapping it in a bash loader:\nscript\n/bin/bash <<EOT\n    if  [ /sbin/ethtool eth0 | /bin/grep \"Link detected: yes\" > /dev/null ]; then echo cheese; fi\nEOT\nend script\n\n", "Q: Can I download genuine Ubuntu from www.ubuntu.com?

I'm posting this question after reading most of similar ones. My situation is different here in the fact that I'm installing on SSD and not partitioning my HDD, and that I can actually boot! I'm just looking to improve the convenience of having easier way to choose.\n1- I have a Dell Inspiron 15R SE. It has HDD (1TB) and SSD (32GB). I managed to do whatever things I did in distant past to set the SSD free (I don't really care how fast my system boots). Now I wanted to install Linux on the SSD and leave the HDD untouched. It's way too precious for me to mess with it. So, I repartitioned the SSD to: 30GB for /root, 1GB for /swap, and 100MB for /boot. I installed Linux on the root and the GRUB on boot (of the SSD). Now GRUB immediately boots into linux and doesn't allow me to boot to Windows. BUT! If I enable UEFI Boot manager and choose \"Windows Boot Manager\" after hitting F12, I can boot into Windows 8 normally. I'd say that's pretty ok, except, I'd prefer to have the option to boot into which one or at the very least, default to boot to Windows. \n2- I'm concerned that if I now delete the SSD partition, that the boot will break and I won't be able to boot anything! Does this seem like a valid concern? I made that choice of having linux on SSD because I'm going to be training on it, so I expect multiple resets from time to time.\n\nA: If you installed Ubuntu in BIOS boot mode, you will never be able to boot Windows in UEFI mode from grub menu. BIOS/CSM is not compatible with UEFI, so once you start booting in one mode, you cannot switch to another mode, or once at grub menu cannot boot any other systems not in same boot mode.\nBetter to just partition SSD with gpt, create a 200 or 300MB efi partition and / partition. Either have no swap or perhaps put swap on hard drive.\nIf you installed Ubuntu in BIOS mode and SSD is gpt partitioned and you have an efi partition Boot-Repair will let you convert install from BIOS/CSM to UEFI. It may just use efi partition on hard drive if you do not have efi partition on SSD, and that is ok, but not preferred.\nStill need to make sure Windows has fast boot off, and usually better to have secure boot off.\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nHow you boot installer UEFI or BIOS is how it will install Ubuntu.\n\nA: You should be able to use the UEFI boot menu to choose Windows even if the SSD is empty. Just to be safe, you could only wipe the root / partition and not the /boot partition.\nTo address the original problem of booting straight to Ubuntu, you could try a couple things. Hopefully one of them will detect Windows and add the option during boot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo update-grub in a terminal in Ubuntu\n\n*Run Boot Repair\nAs oldfred mentions, neither of these will back up your system. Boot Repair may back up some boot-related info, but that's it. It's always a good idea to back up your system. In this case, making changes with tools like Boot Repair should not cause you to lose any data, but it's better to be safe.\n", "Q: How do I make apt-get install commands not display every package that is installing?

Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask.\n\nA: You need a nameserver. That's what connects a domain name with a server.\nYou can do that all yourself by installing bind9 on your server and setting it up but this is usually a pretty poor idea. They need to be online 100% (more than the server itself) and they need to respond really quickly. You'll also need two distinct IP addresses. These are qualities that are just easier to accomplish through managed DNS services.\nMany registrars provide nameservers these days (mine certainly do) and even more hosts (I'm not sure who owns your server so this might not apply) provide it for free too. Failing that, there are other third party options like EasyDNS and ZoneEdit, ClouDNS, etc. These are massively available services. They're doing it better than you ever could.\nAnyway, once you have that in place, point the domain to the nameserver and then you can set up domain records on the nameserver. This allows a browser to resolve an IP address for a given domain name.\n", "Q: Ladder loigic software for ubuntu I just started a class on industrial motor controls.

To put the contents in a different directory, you could use either\nfor rpm in *.rpm; do rpm2cpio $rpm | ( cd /path/to/dir && cpio -idm ); done\n\nor\nfor rpm in /path/to/packages/*.rpm; do rpm2cpio $rpm | cpio -idm; done\n\n", "Q: I can't install Skype on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit I've tried lots of tutorials I found online, but I can't install Skype.\napt-get gives me this error: (but Synaptic doesn't report any broken packages)\n Some packages could not be installed.

[Y/n/q/?] \n\nAnd none of the solutions work. Can someone help me?\n\nA: Based on the version numbers, you're most likely using the xorg-edgers PPA (or at least using the packages from that PPA).\nIn theory, apt should get both the amd64 and i386 versions if you have that PPA added. To find out if you have the PPA added, run apt-cache policy libdrm-intel1. If the entry with the version number 2.4.54+git20140523.8fc62ca8-0ubuntu0ricotz~trusty doesn't have a link to the PPA (there's only 100 /var/lib/dpkg/status and not 500 something), then you aren't using the PPA.\nIf you aren't using the PPA (even if you aren't using the PPA and want to get rid of the packages safely), run sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa and then sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.\nIf you don't want to use the PPA (and want to get rid of the packages from the PPA), or you are using the PPA and can't install Skype, run sudo ppa-purge xorg-edgers.\nAfter following this, try installing Skype.\n\nA: I had the same issue yesterday.  What a pain.  Yep, the pain was me.\nHere is how I resolved it:\ndpkg --add-architechture i386\napt-get update\napt-get upgrade\napt-get dist-upgrade\napt-get install skype\n\n", "Q: Short but (very) consistent lag spikes after upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 After upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 I started noticing short but consistent spikes in my daily internet usage (It became most apparent when playing online games through Steam). These spikes occur every ~2 minutes or so and last a few seconds after which everything goes back to acceptable speeds.\nWhen using the ping command against my router I get tons of packets that takes 0.4 to 0.8 ms which is fine. Then when these spikes occur I get roughly 10 packets, all of which takes 200-350 (or more) ms. The thing is that this didn't happen at all with Ubuntu 13.10, I should probably also mention that I'm using internet over Wi-Fi.\nI've tried to identify the source of these spikes with nethogs, iftop, wireshark, etherape and whatnot without much success (I've never had to track down similar problems so I might be looking at things incorrectly). Any idea what might be causing this?\n\nA: This problem was solved for me after I disabled the network manager's network scanning behaviour.\nFinding this solution was not straight forward. Mostly gamers where noticing and having problems with these spikes, while our use case lies within robotics. Finally, several similar approaches to solving the latency spike issue pointed me in the right direction (looking at you network manager!):\n\n\n*\n\n*Replaced network manager with manual configuration thereby eliminating latency spikes: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1714817\n\n*Replaced network manager with WICD thereby eliminating latency spikes:https://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions/0/540735426854884989/\n\n*Old bug report about network manager's scanning behaviour causing spikes and crashes: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/373680\nMy favourite solution in the end is described here: https://github.com/abperiasamy/rtl8812AU_8821AU_linux/issues/24\nThat is, disabling the network scanning by setting the BSSID of your AP in the network manager's setting of your specific WiFi connection.\nI hope this solutions works for you as well!\n\nA: Shut down every network using resource, and fire up wireshark. See if it's something unexpected that's talking.\nI'd also tail /var/log/syslog while things are happening, to see if anything is generated there.\n\nA: This sounds very much like a wifi driver issue. To identify or eliminate this possibility, try using a USB wifi dongle. If the problem goes away, then you have a wifi driver bug.\n", "Q: USB errors and warnings on dmesg I was using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and booting was very slow and the following error appeared many times on the screen while loading, like this:\nunable to enumerate USB device on port 7\nunable to enumerate USB device on port 7\nunable to enumerate USB device on port 7\nunable to enumerate USB device on port 7\n...\n\nRunning command dmesg showed this error hundreds of times and there was another repetitive message:\nnew full speed USB device number xx using ehci_hcd\n\n(Replacing \"xx\" with two different numbers every time).\nTo avoid this, I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and the message unable to enumerate USB device on port 7 has disappeared, but the other message keeps going on and dmesg is full of this message new full speed USB device number xx using ehci_hcd.\nI'm using an HP Pavilion dv6 on a x64 machine with Kernel: 3.13.0-24-generic\nThis happens even with no devices plugged into the laptop and all the USB connectors work.\nDo you have any ideas on this?

My intention is to install Windows 8.1 only on a single partion like a 100 GB for the system only to use it for my university programs etc. and to use Ubuntu for personal use like browsing, listening to music. For example Windows 8 to be only 100 GB and the other free space to be for Ubuntu and i know Ubuntu has to be on separate partiotions like the swap, / (root), /home. Can you tell me how to do it or a walkthrough?\n\nA: Slightly off topic, but needs to be asked: why dual boot if you're only using windows for school? Installing windows in a VM allows you to access windows any time and removes all the issues with uefi/secure boot and the rest.\n", "Q: JBL bluetooth speakers play no sound, a2dp off? I have JBL bluetooth speakers like this one.\n\n\n*\n\n*With Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Gnome) I get it to pair with my pc, either with gnome-bluez or blueman, but I am unable to reproduce any sound.\n\n*I stumbled upon this website here, but did not managed to get it to work. I see that I cannot change my speakers in the gnome sound menu from internal to the one unplugged (to my bluetooth speakers), but I can see another profile \"unplugged\" available with pavucontrol. However, when I change it to that profile, I hear no sound.\n\n*The aforementioned blog post says to change the connection with the JBL Flip from headset mode to A2DP mode in blueman, but I received the following error message \"the device has been added successfully, but failed to connect with ubuntu\".\nDoes anyone know how to solve that issue?\nP.S.: I see a lot of unanswered/ unresolved question to this all over the Internet, I cannot believe that Ubuntu (14.04) would not handle this speakers.\n\nA: I too do have the same JBL flip as yours and I do face the same issue, sometimes we dont hear any sound after pairing. \nI am not an expert but after hit and trial: I realized you need to click on the  \"bluetooth\" icon on top right and choose \"JBL FLIP\" under scroll down and move tab to \"Connection ON\" and then test it by clicking on sound settings\n** Short flow:\n*blue-tooth icon>> JBL flip (after pairing)>> move tab to COnnection ON>> sound settings>> choose JBL flip>> Choose the mode HIGH Fidelity Playback (A2DP)>> \"Test Sound\"\nYou see a \"Speaker Testing for headset\" window.\nTest it by hitting on the left and right (Front left and Front Right). You can hear the sounds on the JBL speaker.*\nNote: Sometimes when you play Videos through VLC player and if you pause it for a short-while to take a break like say ten minintes. When you come back and hit play: you might not hear the sound on the JBL nor the computer speakers (Sometimes).\nI just UN-pair and pair speakers: Do the same test. It works! :)\nThis is just a workaround.\nSame problem when you connect a headphones- it doesn’t automatically detect, you will have to manually select it by the above path(** Short flow)- instead of option JBL Flip, select wired headset/headphones.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Running a Screen instance of a program as non-root I've got a dedicated server (Ubuntu 12.04, no GUI) set up to launch an instance of McMyAdmin and attach it to a screen instance every time I reboot the hardware. I have the command saved to root's crontab as:\n@reboot cd /var/MC_SVR && screen -dmS McMyAdmin ./MCMA2_Linux_x86_64\n\nProblem being, though, I have a user set up specifically for FTP access to the server files so I don't always have to SSH into the machine. Since the server is being started as a root process, all the files it makes are, obviously, set with root as the owner.\nSo I chown'd all the files and set them to ftpuser. Now I'm stuck with trying to get the process to start as ftpuser. I've tried doing the following but to no avail:\ncd /var/MC_SVR && su ftpuser - -c 'screen -dmS McMyAdmin ./MCMA2_Linux_x86_64'\n\nI try this in terminal and I get no errors or anything (in fact I never get anything unless it's a syntax error from su), but there's no screen instance to access and so I can assume the server never starts.\nSo, what am I doing wrong? Or am I just not accessing the screen instance correctly since it's (supposed) to be launched by another user?\n\nA: One of the most common problems with cron is that it runs with a minimal shell and minimal environmental variables. Because of this it is best to always use the full path to programs, binaries, libs, or files.\nIn addition, although you can use su, sudo is, IMO, a better tool.

I stopped using Ubuntu for a while (since 12.10) and recently came back to it.\nFrom what I remember, it used to only ask for the root password once for a terminal session (for sudo commands). Now it asks me everytime I want to sudo something. Is there a way to fix this? or is this intentional?\nThe same thing happens with git. I have enter my credentials everytime I want to commit. I know my friends on on mac don't need to do this. Are the two issues related?\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: sudo, by default, times out after a certain number of minutes, 15 by default.  You can change this by running:  \nsudo visudo  \n\nThen, at the bottom, add:  \nDefaults:userName timestamp_timeout=timeoutInMinutes  \n\nWhere userName is your username and timeoutInMinutes is the timeout (in minutes) you would like. To always ask for a password, use 0, to only ask once per sessions use -1.  \nPress Ctrl+O and then Ctrl+X to save and exit.  \nFor git you will need to configure it to remember your username and password. See this Stack Overflow question for more information: How to make Git only ask password when push to remote repository.  \nAlso, your sudo password is not the root password. The root password is the password for the account root (which is disabled by default in Ubuntu). sudo just uses your user's password.

I checked the directories where the files were being copied to verify that it worked and it appears that they successfully copied without issue. Unfortunately, since I didn't run into any problems until finding that it just didn't work, I don't have many other details that might help shed some light on this.

You experienced server guys will probably laugh at this, but I'm finally at the point I need help or I'll never get anywhere.\nI have a little box running 12.04 LTS and I've wanted to script some status checks and have the server send me an email and schedule this with cron.\nI basically want a command line mail client that I can set up as easily as Thunderbird to send through my existing SMTP through the command line. Something that can easily be rolled into my bash scripts.\nI already have a remote host handling our email, SMTP, MTA, all that garbage. I don't particularly want to set up a relay just to send email when I have one that everyone else in the company already uses. I've tried, but there are too many aspects I don't understand AND I don't see why I should set up something local when we already pay for a remote host to do these things.\nIf I absolutely have to set up sendmail or postfix, then so be it, but I'd appreciate a simple alternative. I'm open to practically anything at this point.\n\nA: Have you considered sendemail?  (sendEmail) \nDescription-en: lightweight, command line SMTP email client\n\nA: If you mean that you are sending e-mail through a third-party SMTP server (provided by your ISP, for example), then you can install ssmtp, which is a drop-in replacement for Postfix/Sendmail but specialised to that precise task of sending mail through a remote SMTP, and is thus much easier to configure. Then you can send e-mail with the mailx command, for example:\necho \"Mail.\" | mailx -s \"Subject\" recipient@somewhere.org\n\nEDIT: E-mail is a very complicated business... Some things to keep in mind:\nNote that the command above does not specify a sender address (i.e., the addres that the recipient will see in the \"From\" field of his e-mail client). By default, the sender address is your login name on your local machine, followed by @, followed by the full hostname of the local machine. For example on my machine, the login name is firas and the hostname is nomo:\nfiras@nomo ~ % whoami\nfiras\nfiras@nomo ~ % hostname -f\nnomo\n\nSo when I send an email with the above command, the sender address will be firas@nomo, as can be seen from mail.log:\nfiras@nomo ~ % tail -n 3 /var/log/mail.log\nJun  9 20:37:46 nomo sSMTP[2203]: Creating SSL connection to host\nJun  9 20:37:48 nomo sSMTP[2203]: SSL connection using RSA_AES_128_CBC_SHA1\nJun  9 20:37:50 nomo sSMTP[2203]: Sent mail for firas@nomo (221 2.0.0 esmtp3.es.uci.edu closing connection) uid=1000 username=firas outbytes=364\n\nThe vast majority of servers will refuse to relay this e-mail (as an anti-spam measure), because the domain name nomo is not a valid domain. Fortunately, there is an option in ssmtp.conf which lets one specify an arbitrary domain, which sSMTP will use when sending mail. Namely, this is the rewritedomain option, so if I have this in my ssmtp.conf:\nrewriteDomain=fkraiem.org\n\nthen the sender address will be firas@fkraiem.org.\nNormally, the above should be sufficient (that is, as long as your sender address has a valid domain, the server should relay your mail). However, some e-mail providers are extra zealous, and will only permit you to use the e-mail address you have registered with them. This means that in addition to changing the domain name as above, you might need to either change your login name on the local machine, or register a new address with your provider (if they allow it), so that the final address will match your registered address.\nAnother way to specify an arbitrary sender address is to set the fromlineoverride option of ssmtp.conf to YES, and then use the -a option of mailx:\necho \"Mail.\" | mailx -s \"Subject\" -a 'From: firas@fkraiem.org' firas@fkraiem.org\n\nThis is however non-standard, and might not work on OSes other than Ubuntu (and other GNU-based systems). One may also use other, more sophisticated clients, such as mutt.\n", "Q: Resetting Update Manager How can I fix Update Manager in 12.04, which hangs when I try to install any update, while sudo apt-get upgrade works fine?

An easier alternative is probably to build the tcsh package\nDESCRIPTION\n       tcsh  is an enhanced but completely compatible version of the Berkeley UNIX\n       C shell, csh(1).  \n\nIf your system's administrator has enabled the necessary source repositories, it may be possible for you to download and patch the source automatically using\napt-get source tcsh\n\nwhich shouldn't require sudo as it will download into to the current directory. If that's not possible, then the source for the tcsh package should be available via git from git://git.debian.org/git/collab-maint/tcsh.git\nOnce you have the patched source, enter the top-level directory and configure it to build in your home directory e.g.\n./configure --prefix=$HOME\n\nThis will cause the tcsh binary to be installed in $HOME/bin, which is likely already in your PATH. You can specify a sub-directory under $HOME if you prefer, or anywhere else that you have write and execute permissions, but you will need to make sure that directory is also added to your PATH. If that all goes well, then\nmake install\n\nFinally, you may need to create a symbolic link from tcsh to csh in order for other programs to find it as the default csh implementation e.g. assuming you installed to $HOME/bin\nln -s tcsh ~/bin/csh\n\n\nA: I noticed some things about what you did.  There is an easier  way to get this installed.\nyou can simply install csh by going to your terminal.

When I press 'Erase Disk', it shows the message below: \norg.freedesktop.DBus.Python.gi._glib.GError: Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dbus/service.py\", line 707, in _message_cb\n    retval = candidate_method(self, *args, **keywords)\n  File \"/usr/share/usb-creator/usb-creator-helper\", line 239, in Format\n    block.call_format_sync('dos', GLib.Variant('a{sv}', {'erase': GLib.Variant('s', '')}), None)\ngi._glib.GError: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.UDisks2.Error.Failed: Error synchronizing after initial wipe: Timed out waiting for object\n\n\nA: You can try to erase/format disk with: 1. Gparted or 2. Disk Utility \nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nsudo apt-get install gnome-disk-utility\n\nUPDATE:\nYou will probably need to unmount all partition(s) in Gparted (or in Disk Utility) and then delete them all and create one. Also you can do a startup disk in Unetbootin http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\n\nA: I saw the same problem.  Here is how I solved it:\n\n\n*\n\n*If needed, install the dosfstools\nsudo apt-get install dosfstools\n\n*Find out which disk needs to be reformatted.  This will show a list and one of those in the list will be the USB drive you would like to reformat.  In my case it was /dev/sdb1.\nfdisk -l\n\n*Reformat the USB drive with something like this (NOTE: THIS WILL DELETE ALL DATA ON THE DRIVE)\nmkdosfs -F 32 -I /dev/sdb1\nAlso you may have to unmount the usb drive first with the following:\n `umount /dev/sdb1'\n\nYou should now be able to return to the Startup Disk Creator and build the Ubuntu boot drive. \n\nA: I had a problem because the options listed under \"Gear\" button and \"Two Gears\" Button are not the same.\nIf you use Disk Utility like me - the option to change the file system is not accessible via \"Single Gear\" Button in the upper part of the window. It can be accessed with \"Two Gears\" Button in the middle of the window.\n\"Single gear\" button allows only formatting in the same file system.\n\nA: Actually, there is another way to create bootable USB drive with the \"Disks\" utility. All you need to do is \"restore disk image\" using the iso file as the source image and you're good to go.\nIf you need more help...  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Disks\" utility.\n\n*Choose the USB drive from the side.\n\n*Press the little \"stop\" ( ■ ) button.\n\n*Delete all file systems with the minus ( - ) button (WARNING: THIS WILL DELETE ALL THE DATA ON THE USB DRIVE!).\n\n*Press the \"two gears\" button and select \"Restore Disk Image\".\n\n*Under \"Image to restore\" choose your downloaded iso file.\n\n*Press \"Start Restoring\" and you're done.\n\n\nThe whole process should not take more then 10 minutes.\nGOOD LUCK :)\nNote: some OSs like Windows won't be able to use the USB drive until you format it again.\n\nA: I formatted the 2GB USB disk with the Disk Utility with the option \"fill with zeros\". That worked for me!\n\nA: I got this working by creating a new MSDOS partition table, one primary partition spanning the whole disk, and a new partition formatted as FAT32.\n(Without success, I also tried no partition table, a blank MSDOS partition table, and a single ext4 partition before arriving at the solution above.)\n\nA: This is caused by a regression bug in Startup Disk Creator which has turned into CD-ROM creator. Since 16.04 they have been writing the USB stick as a iso9660 CD-ROM instead of a USB stick.

The difference is that it only removes package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely useless. This allows a cache to be maintained over a long period without it growing out of control.

For example, with Ubuntu and Debian, you can choose to receive only security updates (-security), or only security updates and important bug fixes (-updates).\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel upgrades are the riskiest ones, because of the chance that a seemingly beneficial change will cause trouble on a specific hardware configuration. This is why most distributions allow more than one kernel version to be installed at the same time; for example, at the time I'm writing this, Ubuntu 10.04 has three kernel versions available: 2.6.32.21.22 from the original release, 2.6.32.22.23 with security updates, and 2.6.32.23.24 with non-security updates as well. If the ...24 release causes a problem on your computer, you can reboot under ...23 (and even mark the ...24 as forbidden to install, at least if you're using aptitude).\n\n*There is no registry: all configuration data is in files (in the /etc hierarchy), which can easily be restored individually if something goes wrong. Even then, updates to the stable release rarely affect files under /etc.\n\n*If you're installing packages from some source other than a stable release, then you may want to keep copies of older versions of packages, and keep backups of your configuration files. Here are a few hints about this in Debian and Ubuntu.\n\n*Downloaded packages are kept in /var/cache/apt/archives. If you have the disk space, just don't delete old package files until you've confirmed the newer version works for you.\n\n*Many sources keep older versions, so you can downgrade easily (either by downloading and installing an older version manually, or by using apt preferences). For Debian, look at snapshot.debian.org.\n\n*There is a very easy way to set up version control over /etc: install the etckeeper package and activate it with the command etckeeper init. (I do it, but not because I'm worried about upgrades breaking something, rather because I'm worried about my changes breaking something.)\n\n\n", "Q: How to unmount a USB flash drive (that is shared over SAMBA) without having to turn off SAMBA first? I have a USB drive that is shared over the network via a SAMBA share. This is because the contents are to be managed by a remote user.\nNow, there is a local user with physical access to the USB drive. Once the remote user has finished \"managing\" the USB drive, he instructs the local user to unmount the drive for safekeeping.\nHowever, since the USB flash drive is currently being shared over SAMBA, the unmount operation cannot succeed without the SAMBA process first releasing the USB drive's file system. This is undesirable because stopping SAMBA would affect the many other users using the other SAMBA shares.\nIs there any way to circumvent this problem? Or am I doing it wrong in the first place? Or what if the local user just pulls out the USB drive anyway? Will this cause any problems?\n\nA: If your local user is 100% sure that there is no program keeping any file open on this drive anymore it is the sync command to write data from buffers (if any) to the drive. Then you can unplug the USB flash drive. \nFrom DESCRIPTION\n sync writes any data buffered in memory out to disk.  This can\ninclude (but is not limited to) modified superblocks, modified inodes,\nand delayed reads and writes.  This must be implemented by the kernel;\nThe sync program does nothing but exercise the sync system call.\nThe kernel keeps data in memory to avoid doing (relatively slow) disk\nreads and writes.  This improves performance, but if the computer\ncrashes, data may be lost or the file system corrupted as a result.\nThe sync command ensures everything in memory is written to disk.\nAny arguments are ignored, except for a lone --help or --version\n(*note Common options::).\nAn exit status of zero indicates success, and a nonzero value\nindicates failure.\n", "Q: Teamviewer mouse wont open the laucher I have an issue on which I am unsure of the root cause, as in whether it is an Ubuntu issue or a TeamViewer issue.\nOn my computer I have the launcher set to auto-hide.

You could try to display the dash by pressing the super key (Windows key) which should show the launcher symbols, too.\nThe last workaround could be using TeamViewer in fullscreen mode and pointing the mouse to the left.

I mean - when I initially installed Ubuntu, I split the partition so I have 15GB for system and the rest (around 400) pointed at /home/. This is very useful if anything goes wrong someday and I want to format and completely re-install Ubuntu without losing any of my actual data.\nThe problem is, 15GB isn't enough, so it seems. I already moved /var/ and /opt/ folder to /home/, adding symlinks at root, but I'm still at 86% usage and I'm having performance issues (mostly when booting or running a VM). \nI can use Ubuntu on a flash drive and externally enlarge the partition, but I'm really afraid with going forward with that plan. Also, despite what I said before, I'd like to avoid re-installing the system if at all possible. Any advice, suggestions or ideas on how to best approach this? Any warnings I should heed? \nThanks in advance!\nupdate\n\nHere's the gparted screenshot - as you can see, there's windows on dual boot (sda1-5 are all related to the windows system), then I have a linux swap, 14GB (so uh... not even 15) of system and 435 of for /home. \n\nA: I can suggest the following steps for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore all your system directories (var, opt) back to the root partition sda8.\n\n*Use Ubuntu Live USB (GParted) to shrink your home partition\nsda9 to the right by about say 20GB since you have plenty of disk\nspace.\n\n*Use Clonezilla Live USB to boot your computer, and save your\nroot partition sda8 just in case.\n\n*Use Ubuntu Live USB (GParted) again to grow your root\npartition sda8 to the right using the free space created earlier.\nNote: You can have both Ubuntu and Clonezilla Live on a single USB drive using MultiSystem.\n\nA: *\n\n*To resize the size of your root partition (/dev/sda8), you have to boot from Ubuntu live disk or gparted live disk.\n\n*After booting from live disk, make sure that all the partitions are unmounted.\n\n*Right-click on the /dev/sda9 partition and select Resize move option. After that, a partition dialog box will appear.\n\n*Move the left arrow to the right direction until you get the desired size for your root partition. Then select tick mark on the top and to save the changes made to the disk.\n\n*Now the newly created unallocated space will be on the top of /dev/sda9 partition. Finally you can be able to add the alllocated to your root (/dev/sda8) partition. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 bootable drive ignored during booting up (Eee PC 1000HG) I am new to this site so hello!\nI have recently acquired Eee PC 1000HG and would like to use it as my linux machine, it has Ubuntu 13 installed but I want to wipe it and install 14.04.\nMy problem is that my bottable usb (made using unetbootin) is ignored during startup, Ubuntu 13 sees the drive perfectly fine but booting process completely ignores it.

So I have a 32-bit Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS set up on one of my computers. I set up a static IP  address for this computer, but now when I go see what devices are using my internet, I notice that my linux server has 2 different IP addresses and both have the same MAC address. I can still ssh into it no problem, but it kind of annoys me seeing two different IP addresses for the same server. Any way to get rid of the other IP address that is not the static IP address that I set up? I don't know if this is important but I have a Netgear WNDR 3700 v3. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

If this is case (can't tell for sure from the formatting) your machine is setting a static IP for that interface first and then getting a second address from your router and assigning it to the same interface.  This is a legitimate and workable setup that shouldn't cause a ton of problems.  However, fixing it is only a matter of commenting out those last two lines. \n\nA: As far as i know, auto eth0 just tells the system to bring the interface up automatically on system boot.  the iface eth0 inet dhcp would definitely cause it to get a DHCP address to go along with the static IP defined above though.\n", "Q: How to change the volume of left channel using pulseaudio I am recording the video using logitech camera and bluetooth microphone.

Use a hosted solution. I've just been over the reasons why with another user. There's no decent reason for running your own IMO, at least not for external production hosting.\n\nThere doesn't need to be a step 2 but if you're really determined, your DNS server might be being used to contribute to a DDoS attack on another host.

Want to install Ubuntu 13.04 alongside Windows XP. Please give me the detailed procedure to install it. I am a novice at it so no jargon please. Ok. Thnx. :)\n\nA: To start you'll have to create 2 partitions. You can do this by using PartedMagic. PartedMagic can be installed on a pen drive using unetbootin. A partition is a part of your hard drive you designate as separate from the other part. Keep in mind that you should have at least 5 gb of space to run linux but about 40+ gp is recommended if you're going to use it extensively.\nAfter this you can install xp onto one of the partitions like you normally would.\nThe next step is to install linux onto the other partition (in your case Ubuntu 13.04, which I should mention has expired his support date so you'll receive NO updates.I recommend you to choose 14.04 lts. That version will receive updates for the next 5 years) using recommended settings. Linux will install a grub. The grub will let you choose what operating system you want to boot. \nIf it doesn't show your xp OS you'll have to run a boot repair cd. This can also be installed onto a pendrive using unetbootin.\nReboot your computer and it should automatically boot into linux. if you want to change this default behavior you can run a Grub Customize to set xp as the default OS.\nIf any part was unclear you can comment on this post\n", "Q: Konica Minolta bizhub printer does not print under Ubuntu 14.04 64 bits I have a network printer Konica Minolta bizhub C20P. Until yesterday, I'd been able to print for the past couple of years. I had Ubuntu 10.04, I upgraded to 12.04 a couple of days ago (both 10.04 and 12.04 were 32 bits). Yesterday I did a fresh installation of 14.04 64 bits, and today I've been trying to get the printer to work. I've tried several things: \na. install a new printer through System Settings/Printers, then either 1. add a driver file kmC20Pnp.ppd which I downloaded from the Minolta download centre (which is the driver I had until yesterday, which worked for all these years), or 2. select the printer model from a list; \nb. install a new printer through localhost:631 with 1. and 2. (every time I try a new thing, I uninstall the unsuccessful printer first); \nc. I've also tried selecting ipp and lpd printers, the last thing I tried was type lpd://IP_address/print on the Device URI, which ended up in crashing the printer\nd. also some of what's described here about the i386 architecture: Can't get my Canon LBP printer to run under Ubuntu 14.04 (I had problems before while trying to install acroread that had to do with an incompatibility between i386 and amd64, so I thought that might be the problem). \nWhenever I try to print a test page or otherwise connect to the printer (like when I for instance change the ipp: address) it keeps crashing (it's a copier and printer at the same time, so when it crashes, no one can print anymore, it doesn't respond to pings, and the copier doesn't respond either).\nAny insight on what's happening and how to solve it will be very appreciated.\n\nA: I am in  the same boat here. I work for a school district that has several c754 BizHub machines. Download and read Linux Cups Driver user guide for driver version 1.6, it sheds some light on the procedures to installing the new drivers from Konica, however I run 14.04 on two computers side by side and the driver is working on the 32 bit machine and not the 64 bit just yet. I have a suggestion, maybe we should contact Konica or have the local support person come out to assist. I really think it's a glitch in the driver more that it is an issue with Ubuntu. Also I noticed the driver I downloaded is marked version 1.4. When I finally get this resolved I will post it for everyone. Just because this driver doesn't work for me, it might work for you. Also when setting up the printer, use find network printer and it will set up the correct communication parameters. Hope this helps. I work with Windows, FreeBSD, and Linux.

This is a little kludgy. In order for this to work you must have all of your machines configured to only synch with the time servers you control. I have provided four possibilities. I think your best bet is the first or second depending on how strict your time constraints. \nRemember for all of the following options you need to ensure that the server does not have a leap file and that none of the computers ask the outside world for the time. \n\n\n*\n\n*ntpd reference implementation with Undiciplined Local Clock (Recommended/Easiest):\nIf you want to have an ntp server serve a time different from UTC this is pretty easy. Set the hardware/kernel clock to whatever faketime you need. Then configure ntpd to use the  Undisciplined Local Clock driver (127.127.1.x) and no external clocks. The ntp server will happily chug along and serve the local clock. The one problem is that since you are using the local clock driver the time will not be stable and will drift milliseconds one way or the other because that quartz crystal is no rubidium reference. If you need the faketime and stability; you need to use the option #2.\n\n*ntpd reference implementation w/ ULC and PPS source (Recommended/Stability):\nUse the ULC described above and add a PPS source. Once you add the PPS source you will need to add the prefer keyword for the ULC entry in ntp.conf. This will mean that the server's clock is kept stable because the PPS source ticks off each second for you.\n\n*ntpd reference implementation with External Clock Discipline and the Local Clock Driver (Complicated):\nThis is still a solution that relies on using the ntpd reference implementation but I am not very familiar with it. All I can do is give you the link to more details:  http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/extern.html\n\n*Jans - third party ntp testing tool (easier than #3 but unknown entity)\nI have no experience with this product but I know of it from the ntp mailing list.

So you must consider using proprietary graphic drivers(i.e graphic driver provided by AMD) instead of the default open source driver. But since you are in the live USB mode(i.e in 'Try Ubuntu without installing') if you install the driver and reboot(so that the driver might work) you won't get the driver working, as(going by your question) you haven't set up any persistence. So first thing: you must set up persistence. I will explain how to do this below:\nStep 1 - Set up persistence :-\n\n\n*\n\n*First, partition your USB device into two partitions from your Windows OS. Keep at least a 1 GB or so partition for the Ubuntu installation files(make this a FAT32 partition). Make another ext4 partition of the remaining space and remember to name it casper-rw. Use a GParted Live CD for this purpose(or any other partitioning software you like. I am recommending this because it worked for me). I am providing a few screen shots below(but these are not of the Gparted Live CD, I used):-\n\n\n\n(Creating the FAT32 partition mentioned below)\n\n(Creating the casper-rw(ext4) partition)\n\n(How it looks after partitioning)\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now put the installation files into the FAT32 partition. For this you must use  UNetbootin. See the screen shot below of UNetbootin :-\n\n\n \nNote see what all I have selected and select exactly the same in your UNetbootin too. Also compare this image with the image before it. I have selected /dev/sdb1 since that is my FAT32 partition. You should accordingly in your PC.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now, after the UNetbootin process is over, get into the FAT32 partition and delete the file named casper-rw so that Ubuntu will use the casper-rw partition instead of that file to store your data. It will be around 10MB (as we selected in UNetbootin).\n\n*Now you have successfully created a live USB with persistence! Just boot in with the USB device and select 'Try ubuntu without installing'.\nNow that we have created a live USB with persistence we can install AMD driver.\nStep 2 - Installing AMD driver :-\n\n\n*\n\n*Now when you boot in with the USB device and select \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" you will get \"Low graphics mode error\" as you have mentioned in your question. Now press Ctrl+Alt+F1. You will get a terminal window. From there connect to the internet.\n\n*Now type:\nsudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-amdcccle\n\n\n*\n\n*Now restart with:\n\n\nsudo reboot\n\n\n*\n\n*Now boot again and press \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" and it must work properly now.\n\n\nInstall Ubuntu and enjoy now!!\nPS :- Credits for Step 1 go to this answer. Refer it for some extra info on step 1 .\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 stuck at boot splash screen This has happened to me 3 times now, so it is definitely something I am doing. I'm hoping someone else has seen this or knows what the problem is.\nFirst, I installed Ubuntu 12.04 from the ubuntu-12.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso image downloaded directly from the Ubuntu website.  The MD5 checksums of the install image match the MD5 sums on the website:\nmbpr15:source AWT$ md5 ubuntu-12.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso \nMD5 (ubuntu-12.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso) = c7f439e864d28d9e5ca2aa885c4ec4cb\n\nNext, I followed the steps on Google's Android Open Source Project (AOSP) to prepare your Linux system for Android builds. Specifically, the steps relevant to Linux were:\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\n\n$ sudo apt-get install git gnupg flex bison gperf build-essential \\\n  zip curl libc6-dev libncurses5-dev:i386 x11proto-core-dev \\\n  libx11-dev:i386 libreadline6-dev:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 \\\n  libgl1-mesa-dev g++-multilib mingw32 tofrodos \\\n  python-markdown libxml2-utils xsltproc zlib1g-dev:i386\n\n$ ulimit -S -n 1024\n\nThen I do the checkout and build and everything works perfectly as long as I don't shut down.  Once I do a shutdown, this thing will not boot.  It gets stuck at this screen:\n\nAnd it will sit here forever.  It doesn't seem to take any input at all (Esc, Alt-F1, Ctrl-Alt-F1, etc...) and the progress indicator has stopped.\nHas anyone seen this or know what's causing it to hang here? I can boot to a live CD and access my filesystem, make a backup of my files, and reinstall.  But as soon as I shut down, this happens again.\n\nA: first you should check if you can change to the console output by pressing F2 or ALT-F2 (never remember which one )\nIf that does not work or do not show you some error you should reboot and enter the grub boot menu with pressing \"Shift\" while booting.\nWhen you are in the menu you should remove the \"splash\" and the \"quiet\" entries from the kernel commandline.\nThis way you will get the \"normal\" output Ubuntu (and a lot of other distributions these days) usually hides from you.\nWith the error(s) you might see there you can debug your issue and fix it.\n\nA: Thanks a lot, It worked for me, but I had other problems. \nso I will give you some tips:\nwhen I waited to the Splash Screen to press Ctrl-Alt-F1, it did not work\n- try pressing that all the time before Splash Screen appears \n\nTo edit grup                                                                                                    \n$ sudo nano /etc/default/grub\n-delete quiet splash in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n so, it will be GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\"\n\nWhen I tried to sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop, I got unmet dependencies, \n -I also did $ sudo apt-get install unity   \n  but I do not know, if it was part of the solution\n - upgrade and update\n $ sudo apt-get upgrade\n $ sudo apt-get update\n\nthen it reinstalls without problems, then reboot\n$ sudo reboot\n\nNow, get back to work\n", "Q: How to avoid messages from applications which I ran with a &?

Each time I connect my phone via USB, I get the following dialog:\n\nUnable to open MTP device '[usb:002,023]'\n\nA few moments later, I get the \"Removable medium is inserted\" dialog, prompting me to open in File Manager. After that, the phone is connected and fully accessible.\nSo MTP works. The problem is that I plug in my phone to charge every time I sit down, and unplug it every time I step away. Dismissing these two dialogs every time is a pain.\nI would think the \"Removable medium\" dialog is the easier candidate.

This is the site tree:\n\nMajor files: urls.py, settings.py.\n\nA: This is most likely a problem of configuration in django or Nginx\nThere are two things you want to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are your staticfiles configured correctly in settings.py? For the basic django page, these settings are not necessary, but for your static files, you need to configure static files. That is not necessary for production use, because there the webserver serves the static files. Are they collected? Once configured you might have to run python manage.py collectstatic. \nFor instance,\n#settings.py\nINSTALLED_APPS += [django.contrib.staticfiles,]\nSTATIC_URL = '/static/'\nSTATIC_ROOT = '/your_path/.../static/'\n\n# This collects all files in /static/ directories and puts them in the static ROOT folder.\npython manage.py collectstatic\n\n\n*Django does not serve static files by itself (unless you set DEBUG=True in settings.py), thus you will have to add a configuration in engine x to make it serve the static files. You might have to restart nginx and/or add autoindex on; to your config for /static/ in nginx.conf.\nSee Deploying static files.\nIn development, you might also have to add the /static/ url to your urls.py (in development) and not just the settings.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem and a slight change in the nginx configuration solved it for me.\nThis was my nginx config for serving static files:\nlocation /static/ {\n    root /home/muqube/muqube_website/muqube/muqube_static_root/;\n}\n\nThe solution was to replace root with alias, like so:\nlocation /static/ {\n    alias /home/muqube/muqube_website/muqube/muqube_static_root/;\n}\n\n\nA: I'm guessing  you have the wrong file paths. According to what the server is saying the admin and static folders are in the same path. \nAlso on Linux / is  the root path. Your files aren't in the root directory.\nAgain I am just guessing, hope that this helps!\n", "Q: Can I convert a dmg file to iso in terminal? I use dmg2img to convert a dmg file.

It functions perfectly fine with recent Android Smartphones (see pic 1) but I did not manage to send something to a (paired) Mac (see pic 2).\nDoes anybody made the same experience?\nPic 1: Cell phone with send button in right-hand corner\n\nPic 2: Mac without send button in right-hand corner\n\nEDIT: Filled bug report over here in launchpad.\n\nA: Use Blueman, you should be able to pair and initiate file transfer from it. I don't remember installing it on my ubuntu, so it may be preinstalled in 14.04, but if it isn't, just look in the software center.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: iTunes replacement This is a pretty specialized problem, but I can't think who else to ask. I'm putting together a laptop for my little sister, who is an 18-year-old Asperger's kid. She currently uses Windows XP, and I'm trying to get her onto Ubuntu. She's used my Ubuntu system with no difficulties, so there's not a problem there.\nThe issue is iTunes. She has an iPod and uses iTunes to manage her music. Ideally, I'm looking for something that's a fairly direct translation. What I absolutely must have is something that is equally easy to use, into which I can transfer all her iTunes music, and is able to interact with her iPod Nano in all the same ways iTunes will.\nIdeally, something with a store would be good. I've used Amazon, but their downloader doesn't play nice with Linux. I haven't used Google Music, but have heard good things. I used MediaMonkey quite a while ago, but could never get it to work reliably with any portable player.\nWhat I don't know is what will play nice with both Ubuntu and the Nano. The most reasonable suggestion I've gotten so far is \"use google/amazon for shopping and storage, use winamp for playing and syncing.\" That seems like it will work, but I don't know if anyone has any better ideas.\nI'm willing to do a considerable amount of setup, as long as I can be reasonably certain that I'll never have to touch it again.\n\nA: Use Rhythmbox\nUbuntu's default music player Rhythmbox can Sync music with iPhone and other iDevices:\n\nor there is another program:\ngtkPod\n\nThis can be installed from Ubuntu Software Center.\n", "Q: JDK 8 install in ubuntu I'm tring to install jdk 8 for weeks, but it fails.Following are some outputs,\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\nThere is only one alternative in link group java (providing /usr/bin/java): /opt/java-oracle/jdk1.8.0/bin/java\nNothing to configure.\n\nwhich java\n   /usr/bin/java\n\njava\n bash: /usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0_51/bin/java: No such file or directory\n\nls -l /usr/bin/java\n /usr/bin/java -> /etc/alternatives/java\n\nls -l /etc/alternatives/java\n/etc/alternatives/java -> /opt/java-oracle/jdk1.8.0/bin/java\n\nsudo update-alternatives --config javac\n\n/opt/java-oracle/jdk1.8.0/bin/javac   1         manual mode\n\njavac \n  Error: could not find libjava.so\n  Error: Could not find Java SE Runtime Environment.\n\nIf you can please give me a help to slove this problem. \nThank You\n\nA: I installed the jdk just fine. Here's what I did.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the .rpm file from Oracle's website.\n\n*Open up a terminal and type this command:sudo apt-get install alien\n\n*Wait for alien to install.\n\n*Type: sudo alien -i -c <path to the file>\n\n*Wait for that to finish installing.  It will look like it's not doing anything for a while, but it is.\n\n*Test the installation with: java -version\n\n*You're done!\n\nA: I followed the suggested steps today, but was upset by the result. Mostly because installed Java was not registered in java-alternatives among other versions, and also because of apt complaining about \"1 not fully installed or removed.\"\nSo I decided to provide an alternative answer.\nThe following steps made me happy today:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the .tar.gz file from Oracle's website\n\n*Use the following command to install the package converter specific to Java: sudo apt install java-package\n\n*In the directory containing previously downloaded file, run the command: make-jpkg jdk-8u221-linux-x64.tar.gz (adjust the version if needed).\n\n*Then run: sudo dpkg -i oracle-java8-jdk_8u221_amd64.deb (adjust the version if needed).\n\n*If you have any other versions of Java installed, you may need to update alternatives: sudo update-java-alternatives --set oracle-java8-jdk-amd64\n\n*Check everything is OK: java -version.\n\n\nNow you can delete both .tar.gz and .deb files.\n", "Q: How can I batch rename files with terminal If I have a set of files like: \n1-3-Image Export-08_s3c1.jpg\n\nand I would like to rename the first part to look something like this, by adding and replacing the first part with 'G2_NR2_replicate2':\nG2_NR2_replicate2_s3c1.jpg\n\nHow would I batch process this in a terminal?\n\nA: Run the below rename command inside the directory where all the .jpg files are located,\nrename 's/^[^_]*(.*)$/G2_NR2_replicate2\\1/' *.jpg\n\nIt renames all the files which are in the format(name),\n1-3-Image Export-08_s3c1.jpg\n1-3-Image Export-08_s3c2.jpg\n......\n1-3-Image Export-08_s3c1000.jpg\n\nto\nG2_NR2_replicate2_s3c1.jpg\nG2_NR2_replicate2_s3c2.jpg\n.....\nG2_NR2_replicate2_s3c1000.jpg\n\nExplanation:\n's/^[^_]*(.*)$/G2_NR2_replicate2\\1/'\n\n\n*\n\n*rename command works same as sed command.(s/pattern/replace/)\n\n*In the pattern part, we give the pattern as ^[^_]*(.*)$\n\n\n*\n\n*^ --> starting point\n\n*[^_]* --> Matches any character except _ zero or more times. So it matches upto 1-3-Image Export-08 and whaterver character(s3c1) comes after this part are catched and stored it into a group which was represented by this pattern (.*)$.\n\n*Now in the replacement part, we place the text given by the op (G2_NR2_replicate2) plus the catched group. \n\n\n*Finally the rename command performs the whole operation.\n\nA: EDIT: @Avinash Raj answer's is better. Use the the rename command instead as shown.\nTry using sed coupled with for.

When I hit play I just get the loading circle forever :(\nI have tried reinstalling the flash player but that didn't work either.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: As recommended here, try deleting the Adobe cache:\nClose Firefox (or at least any tabs that are actively using Flash) and delete the Adobe cache using this command:\nrm -rf ~/.adobe\n\nYou will need to do this for every user on the affected system. This will cause you to lose Flash cookies and other information, so Flash games like \"Machinarium\" will be affected.\nIf that concerns you, either back-up the important information or navigate into the cache and be more strategic on what you delete.\n", "Q: \"Unable to connect to 80.112.143.217:80\", why?

They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nWhat should i do now\n\nA: As the error with the same IP adress appears at each connection tentative to a server providing Ubuntu package, I think that you've configured a web proxy using the IP 80.112.143.217 and port 80.\nA quick search in Google shows me that indeed this IP is associated with a public web proxy. \nCurrently it is not responding to any queries so I may be not running now. Try removing the proxy setting : System settings -> Network -> Network proxy. Remove or change the proxy adress to one which is functioning and click Apply system wide.\n\nA: Seems that you are using a proxy to connect with repositories. Maybe the configuration file in /etc/apt/apt.conf is wrong. \nPlease check contents. It should be in the form:\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://<username>:<password>@<proxy>:<port>/\";\nAcquire::ftp::proxy \"ftp://<username>:<password>@<proxy>:<port>/\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://<username>:<password>@<proxy>:<port>/\";\n\nusername cannot be an email!!! - username and password can be empty - remove < >\nIf you are able to connect directly to internet simply delete the /etc/apt/apt.conf file.

The installation was smooth and everything seemed to be working pretty fine, but the wireless card wasn't.\nThe weirdest part is that I was using dual boot, so I had ubuntu 14.04 and windows 8 in the same machine so I tried to boot into Ubuntu to find a solution for teh wireless card problem and the wifi was not working on windows anymore :)\nI tryed EVERYTHING to make it work (clean format with only W8 again, 2 times) and nothing worked. So now the problem is with windows and Ubuntu. When I check the driver, it says that is working properly but when I run the diagnosis in windows I see actually taht the drivers are ok but it says that the radio is turned off. I've tried really EVERYTHING and nothing seems to be working.\nDid anyone have this problem before?\n\nA: Looks like you have hardware switch for the wi-fi. According to http://www.lenovo.com/shop/americas/content/user_guides/yoga2_ug_en.pdf - page 27. \nCan you try that ? \nCheers!\n", "Q: Broadcom Card not Working Just installed Lubuntu 14.04.  Like so many others, can't get the Broadcom card to work.  Have tried just about all the recommendations I can find, but still no luck.  Ethernet works fine, but there is no scanning for available networks.\nI'm on a Dell Inspiron 910, with Broadcom 4312, PCI ID [14e4:4315], subset [14e4:04b5] card.\niwconfig givesno wireless extensions: for both lo and eth0.\nI have run sudo apt-get update and sudo update-pciids.  Have run sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source and sudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree.  Have rebooted with and without the ethernet cord attached. \nNot sure anymore whether the wireless key is on or off, so I have to try it both ways (I wish there was an indicator light!)\nAdditional Drivers shows Linux STA wireless driver source from bcmwl-kernal-source(proprietary) marked as \"Do not Use.\"  Using Non-free firmware for Linux kernel drivers from linux-firmware-nonfree. Help! and thanks!\n\nA: According to this page , either the b43 driver or the Broadcom wl driver will work for your [14e4,4315] chip (not sure what the subset is).\nNow, you say you have run sudo apt-get update but have you run sudo apt-get upgrade ?  If not, do that now.  Then install the linux-firmware-nonfree package and the b43 driver should work and network-manager should start.  \nIf things are not working, you probably need to clean up all the Broadcom stuff that is lying around. First purge all such packages you installed.  Look in /etc/modprobe.d by running cat /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep b43  to find any possible line for blacklist b43.  Comment out that line, and reboot or disable/enable wireless.\nThe pastebin you supplied looks good down to the very end where the firmware load (dmesg output) failed.  Around line 128, the firmware files are listed for the modules.  Look in /lib/firmware/b43 to see if the files ifcode15.fw etc. exist, and are world readable (just post the output of \nsudo ls -l /lib/firmware/b43\n\nand we can tell if anything is in the directory.  If the ifcode15.fw and other files are not present, then the linux-firmware-nonfree had an install problem. \nOR perhaps the permissions are just wrong to allow you to read anything.  You can take ownership of the directory and its contents by (assuming your username is \"bob\":\nsudo chown -R bob:bob /lib/firmware/b43\n\nNow you should be able to ls -l /lib/firmware/b43 without the sudo, see files owned by you.\nNow reboot and see if you get a list of nearby wireless access points by clicking on the little pile of arcs in the title bar (the network manager applet).  Click on yours to connect, or if yours is not present, maybe click on \"connect to hidden\"  or \"more networks\".\nNothing is in the folder, so install the linux-firmware-nonfree package\nsudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree\n\nThen look in the /lib/firmware/b43 folder again and you should see file with the .fw extension.\nsudo apt-get install network-manager\n\nshould also try to install the networkmanager, but it is part of the regular installation, so it is probably already present.\nnm-applet is the name of the proram which puts the pie shaped pile of arcs in the titlebar, you could just try running it yourself in the terminal if you don't see the icon.\nnm-applet\n\nBut again, this should be running automatically on a fresh install.\n", "Q: How can i keep password for a folder? I want to keep password for my important folder where my all the documents are kept so how can i keep password for it?\n\n\nA: If you want to stop people accessing a file or folder, encrypting the file with a password is a great way to do it. First either open Archive Manager and click New, or right-click on the folder you want to protect and press 'Compress'.\nThen chose a compression format you can encrypt (e.g. .7z, .arj, etc) (under Other Options). Using 7zip compression is good, as then you can encrypt the file list to. Then type the password you want to use.\n\nThen you can add files:\n\nThen you have an encrypted archive with your files secure inside - though it can still be deleted... \nYou can also hide the compressed file by adding a . to the beginning of the file name, so it only shows when you press Ctrl+H.\n\nA: By default, your first line of defense is linux permissions and your regular password.\nsudo chown your_user:your_user /home/your_user/some_directory\nchmod 700 /home/your_user/some_directory\nchomd 600 /home/your_user/some_directory/*\n\nuse 700 for sub directories as well (600 for files).\nThat will not protect against sharing your account , or someone with physical or root access.\nTo protect from root / physical access you have to use encryption. You have several options for encryption from a private, encrypted home directory to gpg to cryptkeeper . cyptkeeper is a graphical tool and will encrypt the directory. \nNote: as long as the directory is decrypted is is accessible to root and other users with the appropriate permissions. \n", "Q: Whenever I install Ubuntu it says please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU Whenever I try to install Ubuntu it says the kernel is not appropriate for my CPU. Or tell me an OS that's Minecraft capable and for an i686 processor.\n\nA: I've seen similar messages when attempting to install Ubuntu on hardware with a processor that doesn't support physical address extensions.  This can also happen when attempting to install a 64-bit image on 32-bit hardware.\nIf the issue is PAE-related, you can attempt the steps outlined in the linked documentation.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first step is to attempt adding the kernel flag forcepae to the kernel boot options\n\n*If this doesn't help, since modern Ubuntu releases no longer support non-PAE hardware, you can try some options the documentation recommends, such as Xubuntu 12.04, nOS, Bodhi Linux, Lubuntu 12.04, or Puppy Retro.  The linked documentation also provides some more difficult steps you could potentially take to get Ubuntu 12.04 installed.\n", "Q: Increase height of onboard in lock screen On my tablet I use a fresh install of trusty with gnome flashback compiz session.\nAt login screen gnome provides an own on-screen keyboard which is kind of ok.\nWithin the session I use onboard in normal mode and I enabled it for the unlock screen as well.

I also have a free myPlex account which gives me a media queue. I have a bookmarklet I click when watching a YouTube or Dailymotion video for instance.

The desktop file is located at /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop.\nDrag the desktop file into your text editor and find the name of the icon it uses:\n\nNote the line Icon=firefox. This implicitly says the icon's file name is firefox.png.\nAlmost all the icon themes are stored at /usr/share/icons. Very few programs will put their icons in /usr/share/pixmaps  Those are the two directories usually the operating system will seek for the icon file, in order.\nSince we want to find firefox.png I'll open up my Terminal and execute the command:\nfind /usr/share -iname \"firefox.png\"\n\nResult:\n\nAs you can see the icon we seek is /usr/share/pixmaps/firefox.png\nThe path depends on the icon theme you use. The icon sizes most application launchers tend to use are 64x64, 128x128 or 256x256. It depends.\nYou might also want to read freedesktop.org standard icon lookup method.\n", "Q: How does postfix send mail without smtp settings? I am running vagrant.

What can I install so that I can send email without having to install postfix (and without giving any smtp settings for this program X)?\n\nA: The primary duty of any mail server is to route mails to their destination. When you send an email to someone@example.org, using sendmail someone@example.org the following happens.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your mail is handed over to SMTP server on your local machine.\n\n*If you had configured your mail server to route mails (for eg. Send mails of example.org to example.net server) then your email server will honour it.\n\n*If you had never configured your email server, it will do an MX lookup for the domain example.org and deliver the mail to the MX server of the domain. If MX record doesn't exist for that domain, it will try to deliver the mail to A record, if available.\n\n\nYou will need an SMTP server (postfix,sendmail,qmail or exim) to send emails without configuring any SMTP settings.

This stopped the command and I lost my Zork data... \nIs there some sort of \"helpful\" tip out their that I can use to prevent stopping the command when press the keys CTRL+C?\nNote that Zork is run inside of the terminal.  It's a terminal-based game in which you give commands to perform different actions.  \n\nA: CTRL + C sends an interrupt signal (SIGINT, which is signal number 2) to the job in the foreground. You can disable this by \"trapping\" the signal using the trap '' 2 command before starting Zork.\nRe-enable CTRL + C (untrap SIGINT) with trap 2.\nTip: you could add something like this to your ~/.bashrc:\nalias zork=\"(trap '' 2 && cd ~/path/to/zork/ && frotz ZORK1.DAT)\"\n\nThis way you will never forget to disable and re-enable the signal and it's easier to start the game by just typing zork in the terminal.\nNote: you can use the signal name instead of the number if it's more convenient for you, i.e. trap '' sigint or trap '' int. I'm just used to using the numbers, e.g. in kill -9 and such.\n\nA: The key combination Ctrl+C sends the character ^C (byte value 3). This causes the terminal to send the SIGINT signal to the program running in the foreground¹. The conventional action for this signal is to interrupt the current command: programs designed to process successive commands go back to their toplevel prompt, while programs designed as a single batch command or a continuous interaction exit. Evidently the program you're using was designed according to the second model.\nThis signal-sending key is a feature of the general terminal interface in the kernel, shared by all terminal emulators and real physical terminals. You can configure which key sends this signal, as well as other keys (most notably CtrlZ sending SIGSTOP to suspend the foreground program) with the stty command. To switch the key for SIGINT to Ctrl+_ (in the current terminal):\nstty intr '^_'\n\nTo disable it altogether:\nstty intr ''\n\nTo reset all settings to the default:\nstty sane\n\nThe key cannot be an arbitrary key combination, it has to be a single byte value. The stty setting can be overridden by programs — some programs (especially full-screen text mode programs) do their own keyboard shortcut processing.\n¹  More precisely, to all the processes in the foreground process group for which the terminal is the controlling terminal.  \n", "Q: Notepad++ - cannot launch Firefox I am running Ubuntu 14.04 and Notepad++ 6.6.4 (through WINE)\nUnder the 'Run' tab, I clicked on \"Launch in Firefox\" , but nothing happened\n\n\n*\n\n*I uninstalled Notepad++ and WINE, then shutdown.\n\n*I re-installed Notepad++ and WINE and still have the same problem.\n\n\nDoes anyone know what the problem is?\n\nA: Notepad++ doesn't work out of the box via Wine with the installed Firefox software.\nYou will need to install Firefox under Wine to make it work, using the Windows installer for Firefox.  Notepad++ should then work with Firefox under Wine.\n\nAn alternative to Notepad++ is the already-installed gedit software.  It does most of the same functions as Notepad++ in terms of syntax highlighting and such, and comes included with Ubuntu.\n\nA: Use an  alternative to Notepad++, Notepadqq for example and it can be installed by entering the following commands in a terminal session:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:notepadqq-team/notepadqq\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install notepadqq\n\nSource can be found here.\n\nA: I have same problem after some update. when I run the notepad++ on the terminal, I noticed that there are some warning and instruction.

Example of socket address when you go to some web is   69.59.197.24:80:tcp.

The job above will turn on wol for each interface individually, so one failing does not affect the others. In addition, this job works when your interfaces come up post-boot (hotplug).\n", "Q: Preseed proxy setting for local repository I'm trying to set up a preseed configuration for Ubuntu 14.04 network installation from the example on the official documentation. I am affected by the proxy bug on choose-mirror. I'm using an apt-cacher-ng proxy. Due to this, adding a local repository fails, as the key cannot be downloaded through the apt-cacher-ng proxy. Usually I get an error about the key itself. Then I tried using a random gpg key from the mirror specified in apt-cacher-ng backend (in.archive.ubuntu.com, in this case). The error about the key vanished (at least the related prompt didn't appear), but the local repository was still not added, even though I had set:\nd-i debian-installer/allow_unauthenticated boolean true\n\nUsing my campus mirror directly, thus avoiding the proxy, throws up an error about grub-pc failing to install (perhaps due to some problem with the mirror?).\nWhat can I do use both the cacher and the local repository together? I can think of the following possibilites:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-cacher-ng has an option to let some domains/urls slide, instead of outright rejecting them.\n\n*debian-installer has a way to use the local repo without a key.\n\n*debian-installer has a question for more specific proxy settings (e.g., only for apt (ideal), no_proxy lists, etc.).\n\n*Install one package by itself (which contains the key for the repository and a sources.list.d entry), before d-i starts installing packages.\n\n*wget the key and the list entry directly and add it, do apt-get update and other package installation via script in post install.\n\n*Find some way to fix the grub-pc error when using the local campus mirror directly.\n\n\nA: As such, I am using a workaround. The proxy I have set in preseeding is an HTTP proxy, so naturally HTTPS and FTP connections are unaffected. However, the installer does not support HTTPS as a transport mechanism (possibly apt-transport-https has to be installed somehow). So the option that remains is setting up an FTP server for the signing key, which I did using vsftpd. I didn't want the apt-cacher to do any work for the local repository, so I set up vsftpd to serve as an FTP repository as well.\n", "Q: Problem after installing LAMP in ubuntu after installing apache2 It show message like this\nIndex of /\n[ICO]   Name    Last modified   Size    Description\nApache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) Server at localhost Port 80\nhow to install this properly?\n\nA: You need to add some content.

In the installing there was two options: 1-replace Ubuntu 2-Something else. I choose something else but it shows two drives but I have four drives in windows. Is there any solution that without reinstall windows I could install Ubuntu on that 50 GB .\n\nA: First, be very clear on the distinction between hard disks (which are physical devices) and partitions (which are subdivisions of disks that can be used as separate spaces). The Windows user interface doesn't always make this distinction clear, and so Windows users often refer to \"disks\" or \"drives\" when they mean partitions. My suspicion is that you've got one disk with four partitions. If you actually have four physical disks, please say so.\nI further suspect that you've got a Logical Disk Manager (LDM) setup (aka dynamic disks). There are lots of questions about that here; for instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partitions created in Windows are not showing in Ubuntu\n\n*Ubuntu Install Unknown Partitions\n\n*Install Ubuntu to a 15GB partition\nSee those questions' answers for information on converting back to a conventional setup.\n", "Q: /usr/local/bin first in PATH, but executable in /usr/bin found first I'm having a strange problem with an Ubuntu 12.04 server:\nhithwen@ip:~$ cmake --version\ncmake version 2.8.12.2\n\nbuildbot@ip:~$ cmake --version\ncmake version 2.8.7\n\nSo, different users are executing different versions, ok, let's see where are they located:\nhithwen@ip:~$ which cmake\n/usr/local/bin/cmake\n\nbuildbot@ip:~$ which cmake\n/usr/bin/cmake\n\nSo it seems I need to fix buildbot user's path but:\nbuildbot@ip:~$ echo $PATH\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\n/usr/local/bin is already before /usr/bin, how can I solve this?\nI cannot uninstall the cmake package because other packages depend on it and I cannot upgrade it via repositories because last version is not available in 12.04 repos.\n\nA: The explanation was given by the hash command:\n\nhash command maintains a hash table, which has the used command’s path\n  names. When you execute a command, it searches for a command in the\n  variable $PATH. But if the command is available in the hash table, it\n  picks up from there and executes it.\nYou can delete a particular command from a hash table using -d option\n\nSo I did:\nbuildbot@ip:~$ hash\nhits    command\n   3    /usr/bin/which\n   1    /usr/bin/vim\n   2    /usr/bin/cmake\n\nbuildbot@ip:~$ $ hash -d cmake\nbuildbot@ip:~$ hash\nhits    command\n   4    /usr/bin/which\n   1    /usr/bin/vim\nbuildbot@ip:~$ cmake --version\ncmake version 2.8.7\nbuildbot@ip:~$ which cmake\n/usr/bin/cmake\n\nWhy is it not finding /usr/local/bin/cmake?\n$ /usr/local/bin/cmake --version\n-bash: /usr/local/bin/cmake: Permission denied\n\nSo this user didn't have permission to access that file.\nI reinstalled cmake and that fixed it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04, only wallpaper and a mouse cursor is showing I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04 weeks ago, that was a fresh install. And as usual installed, Unity tweak tool, some themes, Chrome, eclipse etc. \nToday, while playing with Unity tweak tool, I mistakenly switched Window spread to off, and bang, no problem yet. After realizing what I did I switched it to on again and then, the title bar of all windows, the status bar (guessing it's called that), and the launcher disappeared. Now I was left with a mouse cursor and the Unity tweak tool window, without the title bar. I thought a restart is needed, but sadly no shutdown option to click on, moreover, the keyboard didn't worked, neither the hardware shutdown button. So, I pressed the reset button.\nAfter a mundane restart, I was welcomed by the wallpaper and the mouse cursor, moving, that's it.

On Docker's documentation pages, all example commands are shown without sudo, like this one:\ndocker ps\n\nOn Ubuntu, the binary is called docker.io. It also does not work without sudo:\nsudo docker.io ps\n\nHow can I configure Docker so that I don't need to prefix every Docker command with sudo?\n\nA: Docker containers need to be ran by a root user. You can add yourself to the docker group (e.g. by running sudo usermod -aG docker $USER), but this makes it easy for anyone with access to the $USER account to gain root access to the machine (e.g. by mounting a root volume in a privileged container).\nA more security-conscious way of running Docker containers as a non-root user would be to use Podman: https://podman.io/. From its website:\n\nPodman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers on your Linux System. Containers can either be run as root or in rootless mode. Simply put: alias docker=podman.\n\nAnother alternative is Singularity, which is more commonly deployed in HPC environments: https://sylabs.io/.\n\nA: To run docker command without sudo, you need to add your user (who has root privileges) to docker group. For this run following command:\n sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n\nNow, have the user logout then login again. This solution is well explained here with proper installation process.\n\nA: After creating the docker group and adding my user to it with\nsudo groupadd docker\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n\n... I still had to give the /var/run/docker.sock socket and /var/run/docker directory the proper permissions to make it work:\nsudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock\nsudo chown -R root:docker /var/run/docker\n\nLogout and login again (with that user) then you'll be able to run docker commands without sudo:\ndocker run hello-world\n\nBTW: This was fixed in Ubuntu 21.10 and is only necessary for Ubuntu versions lower than that.\n\nA: Good news: the new docker (version 19.03 (currently experimental)) will be able to run rootless negating the problems that can occur using a root user. No more messing with elevated permissions, root and anything that might open up your machine when you did not want to.\nVideo about this from [DockerCon 2019] Hardening Docker daemon with Rootless mode\n\nA few Caveats to the rootless Docker mode\nDocker engineers say the rootless mode cannot be considered a replacement for the complete suite of Docker engine features. Some limitation to the rootless mode include:\n\n*\n\n*cgroups resource controls, apparmor security profiles, checkpoint/restore, overlay networks etc. do not work on rootless mode.\n\n*Exposing ports from containers currently requires manual socat helper process.\n\n*Only Ubuntu-based distros support overlay filesystems in rootless mode.\n\n*Rootless mode is currently only provided for nightly builds that may not be as stable as you are used to.\n\n\n\nAs of docker 19.3 this is obsolete (and more dangerous than need be):\nThe docker manual has this to say about it:\n\nGiving non-root access\nThe docker daemon always runs as the root user, and since Docker version 0.5.2, the docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root, and so, by default, you can access it with sudo.\nStarting in version 0.5.3, if you (or your Docker installer) create a Unix group called docker and add users to it, then the docker daemon will make the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the docker group when the daemon starts. The docker daemon must always run as the root user, but if you run the docker client as a user in the docker group then you don't need to add sudo to all the client commands. As of 0.9.0, you can specify that a group other than docker should own the Unix socket with the -G option.\nWarning: The docker group (or the group specified with -G) is root-equivalent; see Docker Daemon Attack Surface details and this blogpost on Why we don't let non-root users run Docker in CentOS, Fedora, or RHEL  (thanks michael-n).\nIn the recent release of the experimental rootless mode on GitHub, engineers mention rootless mode allows running dockerd as an unprivileged user, using user_namespaces(7), mount_namespaces(7), network_namespaces(7).\nUsers need to run dockerd-rootless.sh instead of dockerd.\n$ dockerd-rootless.sh --experimental\n\nAs Rootless mode is experimental, users need to always run dockerd-rootless.sh with –experimental.\n\n\nImportant to read: post-installation steps for Linux (it also links to Docker Daemon Attack Surface details).\n\nManage Docker as a non-root user\nThe docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. The docker daemon always runs as the root user.\nIf you don’t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the docker daemon starts, it makes the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the docker group.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the docker group if it doesn't already exist:\n sudo groupadd docker\n\n\n\n*Add the connected user \"$USER\" to the docker group. Change the user name to match your preferred user if you do not want to use your current user:\n sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker\n\n\n\n*Either do a newgrp docker or log out/in to activate the changes to groups.\n\n\n*You can use\n docker run hello-world\n\nto check if you can run docker without sudo.\n\nA: The mechanism by which adding a user to group docker grants permission to run docker is to get access to the socket of docker at /var/run/docker.sock. If the filesystem that contains /var/run has been mounted with ACLs enabled, this can also be achieved via ACLs.\nsudo setfacl -m user:$USER:rw /var/run/docker.sock\n\nI'm only including this for completeness.\nIn general, I recommend to avoid ACLs whenever a good alternative based on groups is available: It is better if the privileges in a system can be understood by looking at group memberships only. Having to scan the file system for ACL entries in order to understand system privileges is an additional burden for security audits.\nWarning 1: This has the same root equivalence as adding $USER to the docker group. You can still start a container in a way that has root access to the host filesystem.\nWarning 2: ACLs are significantly more difficult for security audits than group-based security. Probably avoid ACLs if possible when you can use groups instead, at least in audit-relevant environments.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 can't get nvidia-prime working Yesterday I upgraded to 14.04 from 13.10 and wanted to try nvidia-prime.

It's not an ideal solution, but at least it works.\nWhat I did was that I removed the address reservation I had set in my router, and set IPv4 Settings → Method to \"Automatic (DHCP)\" instead of \"Manual\" (I had previously tried to set it manually, which \"worked\", but didn't resolve my issue). I also set IPv6 Settings → Method to \"Ignore\" just on a hunch.\nAfter that, I restarted the resolveconf and network-manager services, but it didn't seem to help. So I tried restarting the networking service, which failed. After googling a bit, it seems that's not a supported way of restarting your network interfaces, so I restarted them manually instead:\nsudo ifdown --exclude=lo -a && sudo ifup --exclude=lo -a\n\nThat seems to have done the trick. I'm not sure if the static IP assignment had anything to do with it, or if it was disabling IPv6, but either way, it works now. \n\nA: I had this same intermittent network connectivity problem after  upgrading to kubuntu 14.04 from \n12.x On a hunch I searched for a \"switching off ipv6\" page and found \n askubuntu: disabling ipv6. I followed those sysctl steps and now the problem seems \nsolved.

Sadly I understand that it is not possible. I know that the easiest way is to recompile PHP together with apache support and zts. However I really like the way the standard Ubuntu PHP package is configured and I am used to the path`s for CLI php.ini config, Apache php.ini config and other paths for modules and files that this Ubuntu package defines.

Or am I generating a whole new config?\nAlternative at this point Is there a way of getting the config options that this package defines, so that I can grab a php source from php.net and compile it with\n$ ./configure  --prefix=package_prefix \\ // Option 1 from package\n--enable-embed \\ // Option 2 from package\n--with-regex=php \\ // Option 3 from package\n\nContinuing the main idea ...\nSolution 1\n# Compile (Not compiling)\nsudo make && make install\n\nWill I be building PHP with EVERYTHING at this point?

I'm trying to create a bootable clonezilla usb with tuxboot, the application that is recommended by clonezilla site. I installed it via Ubuntu PPA and follow the instructions on the site to put files on usb. Everything went well and then I restarted the system. Now when I'm trying to boot from usb it says: \"This is not a bootable disk. Please insert a bootable floppy and press any key to try again ...\"\nWhat is causing this problem? \nI really appreciate any help you can provide.\nMy laptop model is Dell studio-1558 and I'm running Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: Clonezilla live USB works very well with UNetbootin (unetbootin) from the default Ubuntu repositories. Clonezilla is in UNetbootin's list of compatible distros in the UNetbootin == Select Distribution == dropdown menu. You should reformat the USB flash drive as FAT32 in GParted first if you have ever used the USB flash drive to boot a Linux distro.\nUNetbootin has been dropped from the Ubuntu 18.04 repositories. When I tested the built-in Startup Disk Creator application as a UNetbootin replacement app with a Clonezilla .iso image it worked in Ubuntu 18.04. I also tested making bootable live USBs in Startup Disk Creator with 5 other ISOs that previously worked with UNetbootin including GParted and they all booted successfully.\n", "Q: 'module' object has no attribute 'PY2' I am using ubuntu 14.04, was trying to install python-memcache.

It's an alternatives system symlink and I'm not quite sure how I got it (in a way that you don't). It was a while since I installed it so perhaps I followed this SO post or one like it... Who knows!\nYou could just write a little bash alias but that'll only work for one user at a time. It might just make more sense to add it as as symlink globally. I'm not sure there's any value going through the alternatives system so we can just plonk one in /usr/local/bin (this is where non-package-managed binaries should go):\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node\n\n\nEdit: That SO post I talked about actually links back to one of ours which might be relevant. It suggests installing nodejs-legacy is the way forward.\n\nA: Since the bin directory is already in the PATH, you can simply create a symlink called node in the ~/bin directory linking to the actual binary.\n ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs ~/bin/node\n\n", "Q: Could not write bytes: broken pipe - looking for log of removed packages I have a dual boot system with 12.04 and windows 7.

I want to stop ftp and remove the service on Ubuntu 14.04\nI tried sudo apt-get remove ftp and checked using command ps aux | grep ftp but the service was still running.\nPlease suggest some way to stop it.\n\nA: I don't know why I did not spot this earlier. I've left my other answer alone to avoid confusion\nThere is no FTP service\nWhat you are seeing when you are running ps aux | grep ftp is the process of the same command.\nThere are better ways of searching the process using the commands pgrep or pidof. Simple way to run these:\npgrep ftp\npidof ftp\n\nIn both cases will simply return the PID if there is a process running of the name given or nothing if no process found of the given name.\n\nA: First of all you will have to identify which FTP server you are running because there are a lot (vsftpd, pro-ftpd, ...). I suggest that you do dpkg -l|grep ftpd to see which FTP daemon is installed.\nThe name of the service to use is usually the name of the displayed package without the version number, e.g. proftpd or pure-ftpd or anything other depending of your installation.\nWhen you have identified in the output the name of the FTP server package, just do :\nsudo stop <name>\n\nif you get an error like <name>: unknown job this is because  is not upstart enabled. Then simply try :\nsudo service <name> stop\n\nThen, just remove the package using the standard command :\nsudo apt-get remove <name>\n\nor (if you want to get rid of all config files and so on) :\nsudo apt-get purge <name>\n\n\nA: To stop the service:\nsudo service vsftpd stop\n\nTo remove the service\nsudo apt-get remove vsftpd\n\n\nA: Firstly check which package/service is responsible for your FTP service:\n$ service --status-all 2>&1 | grep ftp\n [ - ]  proftpd\n\nIf it's still not clear, check by:\nsudo netstat -ap | grep ftp\n\nThen remove it (apt will automatically stop the service):\n$ sudo apt-get remove proftpd-basic\nRemoving proftpd-mod-vroot ...\nRemoving proftpd-basic ...\n[ ok ] Stopping ftp server: proftpd.\n\nIf it's not proftpd, then change to whatever package which deals with your FTP service. \nTest with telnet:\n$ telnet localhost ftp\n\nIf you've got Connection refused, then your server is more secured.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 20.04 ( and if you are installed vsftpd )\n$ sudo systemctl stop vsftpd\n\nwill stop the service\nthen...\n$ sudo apt-get remove --purge vsftpd\n\n", "Q: How to save a file using nano I am trying to install Java via the terminal using the guide How to Install Oracle Java JRE on Ubuntu Linux.\nEverything went perfectly fine until \"Step 11: Save the /etc/profile file and exit\":\n\nI spent maybe 30 minutes figuring out what ^ means (apparently Ctrl), but I cannot understand how that guy called the save command where you can choose yes and no.\nI did try ^O, but I didn't get the same result as he did. How can I fix this problem?\n\nA: With the image shown right now you can save just pressing \"Y\" for yes. To know what key combinations you need to do just check the White square besides the action, which are as follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Y: yes\n\n*N: no\n\n*Ctrl + C: Cancel\n\n\nA: One can save changes via Ctrl+O which actually means Write Out while editing a file through nano:\n\nWhere ^ means Ctrl.\nNote : You'll also have to press Enter to overwrite the existing file if it exists.\n\nA: I am using CTRL + S to save and CTRL + X to quit.\n\nA: Ctrl + X will quit the editor and you will be asked if you want to save your changes. If you do, press Y for Yes. \nCtrl + O should also work, since that means to save the file, but you won't be asked \"Save modifier buffer ? \" because you already told nano to save. \n", "Q: Connect to FTP via Nautilus connect to server I want to connect other ubuntu machines on my network. I use Nautilus FTP connection manager for it, but it ended up with connection refused by server error.\nI install vsftpd but it still shows some error\nI am using Ubunut 12.04LTS 64bit.\n\nA: My best guess would be that there is nothing wrong with Nautilus, but something wrong with your network setup or with the setup of the remote computer's FTP server.\nI will assume that the computer you try to connect to : \n\n\n*\n\n*Is connected on the network on the same subnet\n\n*Is running :)\n\n*Has a ftp server installed (vsftp, for instance)\n\n\nFirst, you must ensure that network connection between both computer is OK. First thing is to ping the remote computer (ping 192.168.1.198 in a terminal). If the remote computer is answering to the ping, let's move on. Otherwise, you'll have to set your internet correction correctly so that the two computer \"see\" each other. \nSecond, you must check that the FTP server is up and running on the remote computer. Have a look at the configuration in the file /etc/vsftpd.conf to check that everything is setup as it should. In particular, check the port on which the FTP server is running. If you have a line with \"listen_port=x\" with x being NOT 21, then it is not using the default FTP port. Each time you change something in the settings you must reload it in vsftpd, using sudo service vsftpd reload in a terminal. \nIn order to check that the FTP connection is working, you can use the simple command line client. Just type ftp 192.168.1.198 in a terminal and it will try to connect. This way you can check if the problem comes from the FTP connection itself. If you have a different port that 21, you must set it here too (look at the man of the ftp command for this). \nHope this helps,\nBen\n", "Q: My Launchpad bug was marked as a duplicate of another unrelated bug. What should I do? Some time ago I reported a bug on Launchpad. Now another user (who is not an active member of the package I filed the bug against) marked this bug as a duplicate to another bug. This is great, as it will prevent my report from expiring but the linked duplicate appears to be only remotely related, and also was marked \"invalid\". Therefore the duplicate state feels not correct and I commented on that.\nDoes the duplicate link have any negative effects on resolving the issue? Should I remove the link, or is it better to leave it as it is? What else can be done in such cases?\n\nA: At a glance, I'm not sure it's unrelated. And I say that wanting to give you the benefit of the doubt. Your bug does spend some time enumerating a permission problem that is covered by the first comment on the master question:\n\nThese actions were for ConsoleKit. logind has its own rules, so you need to rewrite them to enumerate org.freedesktop.login1.suspend and org.freedesktop.login1.hibernate (see /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.login1.policy).\n\nThe rules have moved. Here's another bug report that goes over the same ground. I know you've seen this before but I want to make sure it's clear, this is the sort of code you want:\n# cat /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/90-mandatory.d/disable-suspend.pkla\n[Disable suspend by default]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.login1.suspend\nResultActive=no\n\n[Disable suspend for all sessions]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.login1.suspend-multiple-sessions\nResultActive=no\n\nIf that's not enough (either it not working or nor suppressing the menu item, or some mix of the two), edit your bug description and make it super-extra clear that your issue is with the indicator... And then shunt it back to confirmed (or whatever it was before.\nIn general terms though, you have to look at the bug in question and work out whether or not the master version (or any others linked to it) actually describe or are the source of your problem. If they're not, make that as clear as possible and reopen.\n", "Q: How to unsync two folders? I have Ubuntu One and Dropbox folders synced. Now when Ubuntu One is shutting down, I want to delete U1 folder so it does not use space unnecessary.\nThe problem is that if I delete U1 folder, Dropbox folder will be deleted to, because I don't know how to unsync them.\nI synced them using Grsync, GUI for rsync. \nI first deleted profiles form grsync, but folders was still synced. Then I deleted grsync itself, and .grsync folder from HOME, and that did not help.\nWhat should I do? Is it safe to delete rsync like workaround?\nEDIT: I think I did not explained how dirs are synced. U1 dir is like my working dir, with all sort of projects. DB dir is synced with U1 dir in way, that everything I save/delete to/from U1 is saved/deleted to/from DB dir. If I make any file in DB it will be auto deleted because there is no copy of that file in U1 dir.\nThanks in advance, and sorry form my english. \n\nA: Copy the files from your system to another directory.\nThen delete the U1 program from Ubuntu Software Center and turn off other synch tools if you use them. That will kill the synching and free up your directory you used for synching without the risk of loosing data.\n", "Q: How to reduce CPU temperature ? I have Ubuntu 14.04 and an HP Pavilion laptop. When running Windows 7 the CPU is slightly hot but not much. But running Ubuntu however, it is considerably hotter. I installed tlp and my GFX card drivers (AMD Catalyst) for embedded APU which is a Radeon 6480G. Since then the temperature has went down to about 60C.\nIs there any way to further reduce the temperature? In particular I noticed that in Windows 7 the fan is running more efficient than on Ubuntu. Is there any way to speed up the fan?\n\nA: I'm astonished that you got your computer down to 60!  I have a pavilion dv7-4263 (radeon 6370/7370) and regularly see temperatures over 70, and occasionally over 80.\nA couple of things you will want to bookmark and keep: The GPU in a pavilion will eventually come unsoldered from the main board because of heat effects.  HP wil sell you a new  motherboard, or you can fix it yourself.  I've performed this process twice, and although it's time consuming and will evetually fail, it does make the computer work again.\nSecondly, there is a thriving market on amazon for laptop cooling pads (built in fans on a little stand for your laptop).  A whole lot of them were designed just for pavilions.\nWith tlp in place and configured, there is little more that I have found that you can do to make the system run at lower temperatures.  It may help to use the AMD proprietary drivers, but I have not been able to make these run on the HP system under either 14.04 or 12.04.\n", "Q: How to display the status icon of skype How do I get the Skype status icon on the main bar of ubuntu?\nI've tried to follow this answer, but it wouldn't work.

The solution is tested only on single-volume btrfs root partitions\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure, there are no /@ and /@home subvolumes on the candidate for root.\n\n*Launch the Ubuntu installer, and choose something else when it asks you about disk partitioning.\n\n*Mark your btrfs partition as root filesystem, but don't let the installer reformat it. \n\n*Arrange all the other partitions as you like. I always choose to use external /boot partition on gpt systems, so I can later migrate into something more advanced (e.g. bcache) or whatever. (On gpt you can have as many partitions as you want, so I see no real drawback of using dedicated /boot.)\n\n*Finish the installation. \nThe installer will make the @ and @home subvolumes for you.

I would like to have a Bluetooth adapter powered off at the startup, but at the same time to be able to turn it on when I need it.

This delivered the desired result in Gnome (at Dell D630 with Ubuntu 14.04) and now, when I need to turn power On at Bluetooth I just open System Tools->Preferences->Bluetooth and I can Enable it in there easily.\nNow I want do the same in KDE (at Dell E6410 Kubuntu 14.04).\n However, if I patch the file as above I am not able to turn Bluetooth On any more during the working session, the icon disappears and even error message is hanging in a proper window until cold power cycle.\n\nand\n\nNevertheless there is place to (un)tick 'Powered' in tool Configuring Bluetooth -> Configuring Bluetooth Adpaters , please see this screenshot below. \nI would like not to have this ticked at the startup. How to do that? I have not found setting which specifies this in any KDE tool, that's why my question is: how to the same what untick 'powered' does but from the command line? Then I could add such a string to, say, /etc/rc.local. The direct answer I did not get yet. \nFinally I got a really WORKS FOR ME thing  by doing what is Maco's answer in this RICH THREAD, How can I deactivate Bluetooth on system startup?\nTo disable the bluetooth driver from loading on startup:\nsudo $EDITOR /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nadd:\n blacklist btusb\n\nEnabling it later should just be:\nsudo modprobe btusb\n\nOKAY, that's what I wanted to do - run it again, on the go, without reset. Unfortunately namely this method is keeping my LED Bluetooth indicator (at physical panel) is turning ON, which confuses me, whether it's powered or not? \nBUT the most important question for me is - does this turns off the radio module itself? I would like to have no any radiation from the Bluetooth when it is turned off at startup by any means. If it's doable please point out by what approach. \nThanks. \n\nA: By any chance did you install ubuntu ( unity first) and then kde from the repo? If you did, unity has a bluetooth service that locks the device and breaks kde's bluedevil. If you want to keep both kde and unity/gnome, I recommend using blueman as your bluetooth manager while in kde, cause bluedevil will not work.\nIf you want a proper kde desktop, I suggest install a fresh kubuntu otherwise they have some conflicts nowadays.\n", "Q: Create read only user and grant SSH access I need to create read-only users and make it available for them to SSH with that user name:\n\n\n*\n\n*groupadd -g 5000 rouser\n\n*useradd -u 5000 -g 5000 -md /home/rouser -c \"StrongView Linux User\" -s /bin/bash rouser\n\n*passwd rouser\nIs this enough?

As long as the user is not in the sudo group, the user cannot modify system directories (they can access system directories and files where the o octet has the r permission).\nI recommend that instead of creating a separate group, that you just create the user and place them into the users group (which I believe is by default).\nAlso, the reason you can log into their accounts is because you have sudo access.\n", "Q: Why do I have to use 'exportfs -a' always to mount nfs?

Some players do not allow you to open multiple instances at the same time (I am not sure about vlc). If you can not do this with vlc, either use a different player which allows multiple instances, either graphical or command line, or use 2 different players. I know you can play music at the same time from firefox, audacity, and audacious, but I am not sure this is what you want either.\nAn alternate command line mp3 player ? there are several, aplay is a simple one. There are many very nice alternates, see http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/rock-out-your-console-out\nOr are you wanting to continue to use the terminal?

To know the number of packages runapt-cache stats. Do it on both computer and show the output.\nConsider the following situation. After booting from live iso (located in HDD), apt operation such apt-get install takes less than a second. The number of packages known to apt is ~7k. After  adding some software sources such as packages from universe,main the apt know ~50k packages. Now the command apt-get install takes ~9 seconds (building dependency tree etc). Now the cache size is ~60 MB\n\nA: I noticed that uninstalling the Software Centre and app-install-data speeds up the apt-cache quite a lot now that I use synaptic package manager...\n\nA: According to my testing the reason this is so slow is because apt-cache policy some-package iterates over file descriptors until it hits a limit error.\n~# cat /etc/lsb-release\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\"\n~# ulimit -n 65535; time apt-cache policy snmpd\nsnmpd:\n  Installed: 5.7.2~dfsg-8.1ubuntu3\n  Candidate: 5.7.2~dfsg-8.1ubuntu3\n  Version table:\n *** 5.7.2~dfsg-8.1ubuntu3 0\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nreal    0m3.611s\nuser    0m0.432s\nsys     0m0.264s\n~# ulimit -n 100; time apt-cache policy snmpd\nsnmpd:\n  Installed: 5.7.2~dfsg-8.1ubuntu3\n  Candidate: 5.7.2~dfsg-8.1ubuntu3\n  Version table:\n *** 5.7.2~dfsg-8.1ubuntu3 0\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nreal    0m0.108s\nuser    0m0.011s\nsys     0m0.016s\n\nFor example I see this sort of stuff when stracing the process:\n[pid 10447] fcntl(65534, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC) = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor)\n[pid 10447] getrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, {rlim_cur=65535, rlim_max=65535}) = 0\n\nI think this points to a bug in apt-cache. One hacky way to work around it would be to limit the number of open files but that could cause things to fail unnecessarily in some cases.\n", "Q: Managing a laptop with dual graphics cards?

I'm installing FFmpeg and there's a make distclean (or once there was make clean) after every step. What does it do?\n\nA: Generally the files that can be cleaned are determined automatically by Automake. Of course, Automake also recognizes some variables that can be defined to specify additional files to clean. These variables are MOSTLYCLEANFILES, CLEANFILES, DISTCLEANFILES, and MAINTAINERCLEANFILES. \nEditing your automake.am to specify what gets deleted.\nIf configure built it, then distclean should delete it. \nSource\nShort answer\nmake distclean (does not work on ALL programs but most) will remove ALL files made by ./configure and ALL files made by make\n\nA: According to GNU.org,\n\n‘distclean’\nDelete all files in the current directory (or created by this makefile) that are created by configuring or building the program. If you have unpacked the source and built the program without creating any other files, ‘make distclean’ should leave only the files that were in the distribution. However, there is no need to delete parent directories that were created with ‘mkdir -p’, since they could have existed anyway.\n\n", "Q: Computer frozen after upgrade I logged on to Ubuntu this morning as normal.There was a new upgrade notice. Like I have a couple of times a week for the past three years, I was asked  if I wanted to upgrade. I said yes, the systems downloaded the patch files. After a few minutes, it said I needed to reboot which I did. After rebooting, the system partially froze on startup. I can move the mouse but not am not able to click on any apps. Just a white cursor...\nUsing Ctrl-Alt-F1, I am able to open a terminal. My question is the following: From the command line, can I undo the upgrade that seemed to have caused the problem. Thanks for any help.\n\nA: You will need to uninstall.  From a Unix & Linux post, the concept is backup before upgrade/updating anything.  There is no real undo action without having a bash script made.  In the future, back everything every time before updating, period.\n", "Q: How to create a new user defined command to kill processes using process name? Suppose I wanted to kill firefox , I just write pidof fi(press tab)refox (appears on its own) , then I write ' kill 'id given by pidof' ' on terminal.\nI know that I can write 'kill `pidof firefox` ' but the autocomplete does not work .\nSo I wanted a command like mykill firefox (on which tab completion also work) which on the background runs 'kill `pidof firefox` '\nmykill process name (with tab completion) -> kill `pidof process name`\n\nA: Your best bet would to just use the pkill command instead. It can be found in the procps package. You use it like so:\npkill fir<tab>\npkill firefox\n\nTo get completion for nested commands, your shell (bash) needs to be smart and enable autocompletion in those scenarios. Unforunately, it looks like it does not. I believe the alternative shell, fish, does.\n", "Q: ssh pair key authentication problem I have a problem with public and private key authentication.\nI do this steps and then, public-key based doesn't work.\n1- generate a pair of private and public key (RSA) using the following command:\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/rc_ss/.ssh/id_rsa): \nCreated directory '/home/rc_ss/.ssh'.\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): \nEnter same passphrase again: \nYour identification has been saved in /home/rc_ss/.ssh/id_rsa.\nYour public key has been saved in /home/rc_ss/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\nThe key fingerprint is:\nac:fd:d1:2e:e5:1e:db:87:98:77:9e:14:62:db:97:f0 rc_ss@rc_ss-network\nThe key's randomart image is:\n+--[ RSA 2048]----+\n|                 |\n|                 |\n|                 |\n|       .         |\n|        S    + . |\n|       o   .o * o|\n|      . . .oo+ E.|\n|         ..o+++ =|\n|          .o+..=.|\n+-----------------+\n\n2- copy it through network with ssh-copy-id as follows\nrc_ss@rc_ss-network:~$ ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub root@192.168.2.100\nThe authenticity of host '192.168.2.100 (192.168.2.100)' can't be established.\nECDSA key fingerprint is 33:67:e0:02:b1:10:46:76:78:6b:1f:e2:55:9b:6a:a8.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes\nWarning: Permanently added '192.168.2.100' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.\nroot@192.168.2.100's password: \nNow try logging into the machine, with \"ssh 'root@192.168.2.100'\", and check in:\n\n  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nto make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.\n\n3- then, I want to get connected to server ssh without password, and deal with following:\nrc_ss@rc_ss-network:~$ ssh root@192.168.2.100\nroot@192.168.2.100's password: \n\nWhich means the password required yet.\nCan anybody help me?\nAppreciate it.\n\nA: Assuming that the public key was correctly copied to the target server, you'll need to make sure that the SSH daemon supports passwordless login.

How must I run code blocks, or where should I place the project files to remove this error ?!\n\nA: The most likely explanation is that you have selected a codeblocks workspace that is on a non-Linux filesystem (such as an external NTFS hard drive). Such filesystems don't natively support Unix-style permission bits, so there's no way to mark files as executable (except globally, at mount time).\nIf that is the case here, then the easiest solution is to move your workspace to your regular Linux home directory.\n\nA: Make sure you're the owner of the files.

Is there a step I missed when installing Ubuntu? Can I edit Grub to boot Windows XP without messing with the BIOS? Do I have to downgrade to an older release of Ubuntu to make it work? I am willing to reinstall Ubuntu, if that's what it takes.\n\nA: It should just be a matter up updating your grub while both hard drives are installed.  You can do the same thing with a pen drive installed.\nWhile booted into Ubuntgu, run this command:\n$ sudo update-grub\n\nGrub will search all your partitions for OS Installations and add them to your boot menu.

I initially ran into my question/problem while hacking on the 'Clock' Ubuntu Touch core app, but I was able to reproduce the behavior using a much simplified code snippet, so I've pasted that below.\nWhen I run this code on my 14.04 desktop using the UbuntuSDK, I get the error message:\nCurrencyConverter/ConverterUtils.js:5: TypeError: Property 'tr' of object [object Object] is not a function\nIt appears that either I'm referencing the function using the wrong syntax, or there's something wrong with my import syntax.\nCurrencyConverter.qml\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\nimport \"ConverterUtils.js\" as Utils\n\nMainView {\n    id: root\n    applicationName: \"CurrencyConverter\"\n\n    width: units.gu(100)\n    height: units.gu(75)\n\n    property real margins: units.gu(2)\n    property real buttonWidth: units.gu(9)\n\n    Page {\n        title: Utils.getTitle()\n    }\n}\n\nConverterUtils.js\n.pragma library\n.import Ubuntu.Components 0.1 as Foo\n\nfunction getTitle() {\n    return i18n.tr(\"Currency Converter\");\n}\n\nNotes\n1) The \".pragma library\" line (to the best of my understanding) is there to say: \"only load one version of this library and share it between all places this JS is included in this app.  http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qdeclarativejavascript.html\n2) When I remove the \".pragma library\" line, as the link above hints, the JS file inherits the imports of the QML file it is used from.  So when I remove that line I can access i18n.  This makes sense.  However since the 'Clock' app, where I originally encountered this problem, uses the .pragma directive (ostensibly for performance reasons) I don't think removing it is a good solution.\n3) I found the \".import\" syntax for importing QML libraries into a JS file here: http://www.qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtqml-javascript-imports.html  I might have misinterpretted it, but it looks right to me.\n4) An interesting note is that when editing this code using the UbuntuSDK (QtCreator), typing \"Foo.\" brings up \"i18n\" as an autocomplete suggestion.  Typing \"Foo.i18n.\" will bring up \"tr()\" as one of the autocomplete suggestions.  So it seems like the UbuntuSDK recognizes my \"Foo\" Qualifier/namespace.  Or maybe the autocomplete doesn't take imported libraries into account.  Just thought it was interesting.\nSo my question is: does anyone know what's causing this behavior?  I can probably work around the problem by calling i18n.tr() from a QML file rather than a JS util library, but I'm curious to know what I did wrong.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: So I have a partial solution for the problem I was seeing.\nAfter looking at the code for the RSS Reader core-app, it looks like when the \".pragma library\" directive is used, the i18n module needs to be passed in to the JavaScript function being called.  This gives the JavaScript code the ability to call functions using the passed-in object.\nFor example, the JavaScript would look something like:\nfunction getTitle(i18n) {\n    return i18n.tr(\"CurrencyConverter\");\n}\n\nThis doesn't really answer the \"why\" of my initial question, but for anyone running into this problem, this should be a suitable workaround.\n", "Q: 14.04 with pre-installed 12.04 in the same laptop (Live CD) [Installation] I want to install the 14.04 LTS version on my laptop where I use now 12.04 LTS, I want to use a Live CD and I don't know if it will erase my 12.04 or integrate it on grub in the start on my laptop.\n1) Can I get the both on the same laptop using only the Live CD (Choosing in the grub interface)?\n2) How can this be done?\nThank you.\n\nA: Just start your computer with the 14.04 CD, start the installation and select to have it installed alongside your current installation when that question comes.\n", "Q: Can't update my system due to GPG error Clearsigned file isn't valid, got 'NODATA' I can't update...\nI have been trying to troubleshoot this problem for a while now...

When you look at your notification bar, do you see a network connection applet?  It looks like what I've circled in yellow on this graphic:\nScreenshot #1: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxrzKpGlppKUcWFmU1RFUkx4TU0/edit?usp=sharing\nAfter clicking on that you should see an option that says \"Edit connections...\"  When you click on that you should see one or two network adapters, depending on what your computer has and what Ubuntu is detecting.  See the screenshot below for a sample image.\nScreenshot #2: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxrzKpGlppKUWVpGRDhHdGR5SEU/edit?usp=sharing\nIf you see one labeled wired connection, that's the one I would start off with first.  It should be configured to get a dynamic IP address. Assuming that the router you're plugging it into is also a DHCP server, or that you have a separate DHCP server running on your network.\nAs far as you're wireless connection is concerned, if Ubuntu is detecting your wireless adapter you should be able to see all of the available wireless networks in your area.  They are visible to you when you click on the network connection applet in my first screenshot.  If you don't see your wireless network, you click on the option to \"Connect to Hidden WiFi Network\".\n\nA: Had this problem myself after installing 14.04.\nMake sure the wireless switch is on. On the Dell Latitude D630 it's on the left side, a few inches from the front (I don't know if it's the same on 131L).\nConnect to the internet via Ethernet, open a terminal, and issue these commands:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge ndiswrapper*\nsudo apt-get remove --purge bcmwl-kernel-source\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nThen reboot.\nThis worked for me.\nSource: Dell Latitude D630 wireless issues running Ubuntu 13.10\nYou also asked about not having been connected to the internet while installing.

One is www.domain.com and the other is test.domain.com.

Thank you.\n\nA: The syntax of the VirtualHost Directive is \n<VirtualHost addr[:port] [addr[:port]] ...> ... </VirtualHost>\n\nWhere addr is the address of the virtual host, not its physical path.\nSo it is safer to use an IP (or the * wildcard). It even says it in the documentation that, you can use a fully qualified domain, but it is not recommended:\nFrom the documentation:\n\nA fully qualified domain name for the IP address of the virtual host (not recommended)\n\nTo achieve what you are asking, you need a combination of the DocumentRoot and ServerName directives. Which, in fact, are already there.\nExample:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/domain.com/\n    ServerName www.domain.com\n    # Some other configs\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/domain.com/test/\n    ServerName test.domain.com\n    # Some other configs\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\nAlso, there is another issue in your virtual host configuration, as of apache2.4 (which is shipped by default in 14.04) the allow directive is replaced with the Require directive.\nIt also needs be inside a special directive, for example, the Directory directive:\n<Directory \"/var/www/domain.com/\">\n    Require all granted\n    Options +Indexes\n</Directory>\n\nThis is a complete Virtual Host configuration:\n<VirtualHost *:80> \n    ServerName www.domain.com\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@domain.com\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/domain.com/\n\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/domain.error.log\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/domain.access.log combined\n    UseCanonicalName on\n\n    <Directory \"/var/www/domain.com/\">\n        Require all granted\n        Options +Indexes\n    </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n\n", "Q: Is it safe to alias rm to safe-rm? We are happy to use safe-rm as a replacement to rm, but is it considered safe to alias it?\ne.g.\nalias rm='safe-rm'\n\n\nA: Yes, an alias is just a shell-only rename. The scope of an alias is only the shell that you are currently in. safe-rm is just a wrapper that does some blacklist checking to prune the arguments list, it still calls rm under the hood (it also calls rm explicitly with /bin/rm so the alias does not affect the script)\nIt is not, however, safe in that it does not prevent a user from using rm explicitly either by unsetting the alias or by explicitly calling /bin/rm. safe-rm is only to prevent accidents, not a security feature, this is what permissions are for. You can still easily delete blacklisted files if you actually want to do that. \n\nA: \nThis is an extra tip\nTo avoid a mistaken rm -rf, do not type rm -rf.\n\n\n*\n\n*If necessary, change to the parent of the directory you want to delete.\n\n*mv directory-to-delete DELETE\n\n*Explore DELETE and check that it is indeed what you wanted to delete\n\n*rm -rf DELETE\nNever call rm -rf with an argument other than DELETE. Doing the deletion in several stages gives you an opportunity to verify that you aren't deleting the wrong thing, either because of a typo (as in rm -rf /foo /bar instead of rm -rf /foo/bar) or because of a braino (oops, no, I meant to delete foo.old and keep foo.new).\nIf your problem is that you can't trust others not to type rm -rf, consider removing their admin privileges. There's a lot more that can go wrong than rm.\nLet me get into the problem you asked\nThis tool, safe-rm, ships with a default system-wide configuration file (/etc/safe-rm.conf), but each user can supplement that list of \"protected\" directories and files by adding lines to ~/.safe-rm.\nUse \\rm when you are sure about what you are deleting but most of the time, I prefer to go through the confirmation. Too many files disappeared because of a rushed removal action.\n", "Q: Why did Ubuntu 14.04 create a 15.8GB swap partition? I started with Windows 7 on 120GB SSD and Ubuntu 14.04 32bit installed on 60GB partition on separate 1TB HDD. I just did a fresh reinstall of 14.04 64bit on the 1TB HDD. In the installation set up process, I selected the second choice of \"deleting Ubuntu 14.04 and all it's files,documents, photos etc and reinstalling\" to what I figured would reinstall the 64bit OS on the already existing 60GB allocated partition. Instead, it reinstalled Ubuntu as 43.5 GB and created a separate 15.8 partition. So now it reads that my disk space for Ubuntu ( in settings>details) is 43.5GB (instead of the previous 60GB that my old 32bit had)\nThe upside is I can now access my 1TB HDD from my toolbar(and all the files located on it) Before, I could only access that through Windows (I can also access the SSD too, but that was always the case) Both drives are mounted now.\nMy initial reaction was to go into Windows 7> disk management> delete the strange/new 15gb partition>extend the 43.5 to the unallocated space. But I'm not sure if this is necessary or would even work.\nMy question is why did it create a 15gb partition shrinking my ubuntu disk space, and is it useful? I don't want wasted space, so before I go through all my set up of Ubuntu, should I change this. \nAt this time my HDD reads as 43.5 partiton, 15.8 partition, and 874GB exfat32 (939GB total)\nSo yes, per Gparted it's linux-swap. Why do I have that now? My previous set up showed disk space as complete 60 GB (technically 59.?)\n\n\nA: Most Linux distributions by default will make a swap partition that is equal to your computers memory. This is so you can keep your RAMs contents saved to disk if you ever hibernate. It is also used as extra room in case your ram becomes full. If you max out your ram without swap your systems kernel will kill off what it considers non-critical processes. If you do not hibernate or have the feature disable then a small swap of a few gigabytes will work as a safety net. \n", "Q: audio not playing through headphones I am using Dell Alienware M14X.

You need to change your password immediately, backup all data and reinstall the system. If an attacker managed to get root access (either because your user has sudo rights or through an exploit)  to the system neither the logs nor any executables (even system ones) can be trusted.

You want apt-get.. If ap is an alias —sigh— see my final point.\n\n*Do you understand what do-release-upgrade -d does? It's the tool used for upgrading Ubuntu to a new release (in this case a development release). It'll only ever work once every 6 months and it will keep you nailed to the nasty, rusty, dripping, bleeding edge that is Ubuntu development. Never use this (especially not regularly) on a computer that you might need at any given point.\n\n*The direct answer to your question: do-release-upgrade -d will exit code 1 if there is nothing to upgrade to. As above, it'll only ever fire code 0 (success) twice a year. && only continues when the previous command exits code 0 so you either want:\n\n\n*\n\n*; continue whatever, or more likely,\n\n*|| the opposite of &&, run on fail.\n\n\n*More than that, do-release-upgrade is interactive when there is something to upgrade to.\n\n*The -y flag is dangerous. It can —no, will— ruin your day at least once. This is 100× truer on a development release (which it looks like you're trying to stick to). You should want every opportunity to avoid Apt accidentally removing all your packages.\n\n*Why an alias? You've sandwiched a hundred commands into one line, why don't you just write a script named a and stick it in ~/bin/ (create it if it doesn't exist then run source ~/.profile to update your $PATH).\n\n*And why are you doing any of this at all? If you want automatic updates, why don't you just use one of the many existing tools that does this for you? Shazaam, now you don't need a script.\n\n*And finally, if you're really so bored of typing commands that you're aliasing the entire alphabet, it might be time to learn to hit the tab key with your left little finger when you're typing. It'll auto-complete as far as it can (and works inside a lot of commands too; try it with apt-get).\n\nA: When you do an release upgrade, many problems can occur : the computer brutally stops, internet access stops, ... It is then possible to have an incomplete upgrade or some problem with dependencies. \n\n\n*\n\n*In case you have dependencies errors, try theses commands : \nsudo dpkg --configure -a\nand then :\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\n*If your upgrade was interrupted or a major issue occured, you can try this command : \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh -a\nThis will reinstall and reconfigure every package needed for the release-upgrade. Please note that this can be very long, up to 1 hour. \n", "Q: How to remove unnecessary locales? I noticed I have several unneeded locales installed, for example, firefox-locale-. I only need one locale.\nHow to remove all the rest?\n\nA: Unless you have a need to switch to various locales all the time, you can uninstall the unused locales and free up some amount of the storage space in your system.\nInstall Localepurge via the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install localepurge\nOnce the installation is done, it will remove all locale files from your system that you have no need for.\n\nA: First type the locale command to print out your current locale configuration. Also, you can use locale -a to display a list of all available locales.\nCleaning up unused locales\nInstall localepurge to remove any unwanted languages, while choosing the ones you want to keep. Note that this method will not change the locales settings on your system. It will just purge the locales you have not selected. Use at your own risk.\nsudo apt-get install localepurge\n\nAfter that, you could reboot or try to run source /etc/default/locale.\nTo reconfigure this, simply enter the following in terminal:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure localepurge\n\n\nAnother way answered here is to\nsudo locale-gen --purge <locales YOU WANT TO KEEP>\n\nReference\n\n*\n\n*LocaleConf at Ubuntu Help\n\n*Locale at Ubuntu Help\n\nA: Use apt install localepurge, but this only stops new packages from installing locales files.  \"This option will become active for packages unpacked after localepurge has been (re)configured.

Do not edit these manually, they will be overwritten on package upgrades.\n\nLocales are compiled (generated) into a single file.\n\n/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive\nUsual default locale archive location.\n\nComprehensive details on locales at the Arch Wiki.\nChecking locales and the locale\nTo list available (known) locales, run any of the following commands (with minor output differences).\nlocale -a\nlocalectl list-locales\n\nTo check the (already) generated locales, run the following command.\nlocaledef --list-archive\n\nTo check the currently used locale, run any of the following commands (with minor output differences).\nlocale\nlocalectl\n\nSetting and generating (new) locales\nLocales are typically set by uncommenting lines in /etc/locale.gen, after which running locale-gen is required.\nnano /etc/locale.gen # uncomment desired lines (locales)\nlocale-gen\n\nThis will compile (generate) locales into /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive for each uncommented line in /etc/locale.gen and under /var/lib/locales/supported.d/, whether they were previously compiled or not.\nAlternatively, the command\nlocale-gen <locale>\n\nwill uncomment the corresponding line in locale-gen while generating the desired locale and only this one.\nNote: The implementation of locale-gen is distro dependent. For instance, the command above is valid in Ubuntu/Debian but not in ArchLinux.\nRemoving locales\nWhen issuing locale-gen, the compiled archive is erased and all locales in /etc/locale.gen and under /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive are regenerated anew. The command locale-gen --purge <locale> doesn't do what the modifier suggests but the opposite: It removes all compiled locales except those indicated. To make sure only specific locales are generated when locale-gen is issued or and update is performed both /etc/locale.gen and /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive must be considered.\nTo remove locales in /etc/locale.gen, simply comment the desired lines and regenerate the locales using locale-gen.\nTo remove locales under /var/lib/locales/supported.d/ is trickier. Since any file /var/lib/locales/supported.d/<code> depends on the package language-pack-<code>-base, any change on the former will be restored when the latter is updated. To solve this, simply hold the packages that update files under /var/lib/locales/supported.d/. The command that achieves this in Ubuntu/Debian is the following.\napt-mark language-pack-<code>-base\n\nTo update a held package, you must unmark it or simply --ignore-hold.\nWorkaround. A more intrusive but general solution that prevents changes under /var/lib/locales/supported.d/ is to set files in it with the \"immutable (i)\" attribute. So instead of removing files, empty them. For instance:\ncd /var/lib/locales/supported.d/\nrm <code> && touch <code> # <code> has been emptied\nlsattr <code>    # regular attributes\nchattr +i <code> # adding (+) immutable\nlsattr <code>    # checking attributes\n\nSetting the locale\nSetting and generating locales does not set the system locale. Any of the following commands achieves this.\necho LANG=<code> | sudo tee /etc/locale.conf # reboot (might be ignored in Ubuntu)\nlocalectl set-locale LANG=<code>\n\n\nA: This is my first answer on this site. BleachBit is able to remove files for unwanted languages in your system and applications.\nInstall BleachBit from your Ubuntu Software or terminal (sudo apt install bleachbit) and open it as root (sudo bleachbit). Go to Preferences and under Languages check all the languages you want to keep. Now on the left panel, under System, check Localizations. If you want to know how much space these localization files are taking up in your system, click the Preview button. Use the Clean button to actually free up the space.

You have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Call your python binary explicitly: sudo /opt/anaconda/bin/python file.py\n\n*Comment out the secure_path line in /etc/sudoers (but it's probably there for a reason)\n\n*Specify keep_env for this specific command (though this probably has similar issues to above).\n\n\nDo not add your Python path to the secure_path as this will probably screw up more than a couple of standard sudo calls.\n", "Q: \"cannot open file userpref.blend@ for writing: Permission denied\" in blender I'm using blender 2.69, installed via software centre, and when I save my user preference through File -> User Preferences and click on \"Save User Settings\" there is a message\n\"cannot open file /home/ganez/.config/blender/2.69/config/userpref.blend@ for writing permission denied\"\nI have checked to the path /home/ganez/.config/blender/2.69/config/ and there is no userpref.blend file present.\nPS: I think this has something to do with file permission for that config folder and I have no idea on how to use the chmod command.

When I tried this, Blender regenerated the folder with the proper permissions.\nGenerally, it is recommended to avoid running programs as root. With such a large code-base, a program is bound to have some areas of undefined behavior (bugs) that even if not malicious, could be dangerous to your system.\n\nA: OK now. I just figured it out myself for now(Answering my own question).\nWe have to run the program as root from the terminal.\ngksudo blender\n\nand then there won't be any problem as permission denied.\n\nA: A solution is to use chown command to take ownership of the interested folder. From terminal: navigate to the ~/.config/blender folder; check current permissions with dir -ls. For example, in my case, the folder for blender 2.72 was owned by root.

But now, a while after upgrading to trusty, I tried to do that, and didn't get any sound. TiMidity itself (timidity ~/path/to/midi.mid) still plays files fine, but if I try to play them with aplaymidi, I still just get silence. Oddly, the midi files are clearly being read. When I ran (where 130:0 was vmpk's input port)\naplaymidi -p 130:0 ~/path/to/midi.mid\n\nvmpk was highlighting notes on the piano as if it were playing the midi. One time I tried this, TiMidity (?) very briefly played a fraction of a second of the first chord of my song before everything went silent and vmpk just highlighted the first voice on the keyboard as usual.\nNow the weirdest part of this is that probably about 40% of the time, when I've played at least one note with either aplaymidi or vmpk, when I run\naconnect -x\n\nI get a sudden burst of a note or chord from my speakers (that is, if I played one note, I get a note; if I played multiple sequential notes, they turn into a chord), as if the notes were being queued up but not being played and that somehow liberated them. I have no idea what's going on there.\nA little while ago I remember having a problem with Audacity playing wav files sped up and also locking up if I tried to pause it, which it stopped doing when I set the audio devices to the actual audio devices rather than pulse. But now when I checked again, it's doing the opposite: it won't play audio at all and/or acts weirdly if I don't set the audio devices to pulse, and either way will very occasionally randomly do the speeding up thing regardless.\nOddly in the midst of what's looking like a pretty screwed up sound system, sound in VLC and Firefox has been working fine and if I play a wav file with\naplay ~/path/to/sound.wav\n\nthat works fine too.\nAny idea what I could do to figure out what's wrong with ALSA and/or fix it?\nedit: I tried aseqdump.

Please !!\n\nA: \nI decided to delete ubuntu and change to ubuntu 12.04 as 14.04 does not have much softwares..\n\nFirst, this is a mistaken assumption. I haven't checked the package manifests of the two versions of Ubuntu, but I'd be surprised if less was available for 14.04 than for 12.04. There's a lot of software available for Ubuntu (and for Linux generally). If you need a specific type of program and can't find it, post a question about that rather than do something radical (more radical than you realize; see below....).\n\nI opened Disk Management and deleted two partitions which were unnamed(so they belonged to Ubuntu).(Three of the local disks changed to dynamic)\n\nIf attempting to downgrade from 14.04 to 12.04 was your first mistake, using the Windows Disk Management tool was the second one. You've identified the reason: That tool changed, without asking you, your disk from a standard partitioning setup to one that uses Logical Disk Management (LDM), aka dynamic disks. The trouble is that Ubuntu can't install to a disk that uses LDM, so by doing this, you've created a new hurdle for yourself.\nThere are lots of questions here that address this issue, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Install Unknown Partitions\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 not detecting free space\n\n*Partitions created in Windows are not showing in Ubuntu\nThe good news is that you can convert back, but you'll need to use third-party tools to do so -- see the earlier questions for links.\nIn the future, do not use the Windows Disk Management tool to do anything but shrink your Windows partition. It's got numerous known bugs that Microsoft refuses to fix and it tends to pull stunts like this one. Instead, use GParted, parted, fdisk, gdisk, or other Linux tools; or perhaps third-party Windows tools (with which I'm relatively unfamiliar) for disk partitioning. Shrinking the Windows partition is a possible exception to this rule, since it's likely to be a little safer to use Microsoft's tool for this task. If you do that, though, do not create additional partitions in the free space; leave that task to the Linux installer or do it manually with a Linux program.\nOnce you've fixed your LDM problem, re-install 14.04. That will install a fresh copy of GRUB, which should work.\nIncidentally, the problem with the grub rescue> prompt is caused by the way GRUB works. Specifically, GRUB relies on files in the Linux partition, so as soon as you deleted the Linux partition, GRUB could no longer work properly -- but as the way you deleted Linux left GRUB in control of the MBR, GRUB still tried to work. If you wanted to delete Linux and continue using Windows, you'd need to re-install the Windows boot loader to the MBR, which you'd do either with a Windows recovery tool or by restoring a backup (if you'd had the expertise and foresight to create one; most people don't).\n\nA: Problem could be with those dynamic drives. I don`t use Windows at all, but once i tryed to make dual-boot on w7 machine and, if i recall correctly, all partitions were primary.\nChance is that you cannot have anymore primary partitions.\nI changed those drives to whatever was that other(other than dynamic) disk setup. Make sure that you got maximum 2 primary partitions, because you need third one for Ubuntu installation.\nBut first of all - 12.04 instead of 14.04?\nSorry, but that was strange move. Install 14.04 again. I really don`t understand what you mean by :\" 14.04 does not have much softwares\".\nI got 14.04 and all software is here.\n", "Q: PostgreSQL data diff Note: this question is not about syncing database schema/structure\nProblem\nIn my web application I have a PostgreSQL database server (PGS) and a (separate machine) business logic server (BLS) which regularly (every minute or two) queries 'SELECT ALL' against PGS.\nThe problem is that the 'SELECT ALL' query can easily return 50-200 MB each time. It is obvious that it would be not so good architecture-wise to transfer so much data so frequently over the web.\nPossible solution\nWhat I would like to do is to run some diff tool on PGS and compare the new query with the previous query (all this should be done on PGS). Once the comparison is done I would like to get a dump from PGS and transfer it to BLS. I expect that a diff-based dump would be much, much smaller than the whole 'SELECT ALL' query.\nQuestion \nIs there any data diff tool for PostgreSQL that can do diffs that compare PostgreSQL data between 2 tables or 2 dumps?\nNote: I would prefer some open-source software tool.\n\nA: Postgres can do all this stuff for you without any additional tools. The server produces WAL (Write-Ahead Log) files, which contain all changes done on databases. I think what you really need is streaming replication. Read about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)\n\n*Streaming Replication\nIf you really do not want to talk about syncing database schema/structure, you may be interested in the solution described in this answer.\n", "Q: FFMpeg permission denied error I installed ffmpeg into /root/bin\nI followed this guide: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu\nI now want a non admin to access it. I created a symbolic link in /usr/local/bin\nnow if i try to execute i get:\n-bash: /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg: Permission denied\n\n\nA: I've spend weeks to remove some conflicts of libraries and ffmpeg got installed. But unfortunately I installed it in /root/bin/. \nTyping this in the terminal fixed it for me:\ncp -r /root/ffmpeg_build \n\ncp -r /root/bin/{ffmpeg,ffplay,ffserver,x264,yasm} /usr/local/bin/\n\nAnd it's working fine.\n\nA: You can't use a link whose target is in a directory you don't have access to. The effective permissions on a link are those of its target. \nI have no idea why you decided to install in /root/bin, that is not what the guide you followed tells you to do. You should have installed everything in $HOME/bin, your $HOME. I am guessing that you followed all the steps from the guide but running everything from a root shell (sudo -i or sudo su or su). If so, you should be able to get everything to work as expected if you just copy the directories created to your $HOME:\nsudo cp -r /root/ffmpeg_build ~/\nsudo cp /root/bin/* ~/bin\n\nThe last command will copy everything from /root/bin to ~/bin which might not be what you want. If for whatever reason you have other files in there, just pick up the ones you created for ffmpeg:\nsudo cp /root/bin/{ffmpeg,ffplay,ffserver,x264,yasm} ~/bin/\n\nAnyway, once all files have been copied, you can create the link in /usr/local/bin for non-admin users. Even better, you can just move the directories above to /usr/local and the binaries directly to ~/usr/local/bin. However, note that they will be overwritten if you ever install ffmpeg from the repositories using sudo apt-get install ffmpeg.\n", "Q: New Nvidia Graphics card drivers Hi I am writing this as I have an issue with my Nvidia drivers. I have a Nvidia 750Ti running on a Xubuntu 14.04 LTS. \nI have had problems with my nvidia drivers before and solved them using this answer: Unable toboot with Nvidia GTX 750 ti, even with latest beta drivers\nAfter installing the drivers the graphics card have been working perfectly, until the kernel upgraded. After that I would again have driver problems and then would install the newest drivers again.\nSo here are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I have to install the drivers from the Nvidia website manually every time there is a kernel upgrade?\n\n*I saw that there are experimental drivers for the new graphics cards: https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa. I have heard that they experimental and could potentially damage your system, but they do have the newest Nvidia 337.25 drivers. Are these safe to use and do they update automatically (sudo apt-get upgrade or GUI method)?\n\n\nWhich of the two options would be better?\nThank you for your help\n\nA: I'm with Ubuntu 14.04 and a GeForce 750 ti, too. I had to go through the same procedure to actually get my machine to boot. Now, originally I just downloaded the driver and installed it manually. At first it seemed to have worked, but I later ran into problems. I guess they were cause by me, making some mistakes at some point in the manual process, but at any rate, I could not solve them and had to re-install Ubuntu.\nThe second time I went with adding the edger's PPA and installed the driver from there. It worked like a charm, since all necessary changes were applied for me (blacklisting nouveau, for example).\nThe stability of the driver can be questioned - I have a lot of weird flickering (mostly in the browser; not at all in games) and some other mysterious issues, but none of them are show stoppers.\nRegarding whether or not you automatically receive updates: good questions, I'd love to know the answers to these myself. What I do know is that once you've added the edger's PPA, you can simply select from all available drivers within the software center. See Screenshot: http://imgur.com/VHrT44l\nAbout the kernel/upgrade, I have no idea. And that said, sorry for the incomplete answer - I wanted to write a comment, but my reputation didn't allow it. I still wanted to share the little info I had. Hope this helped and I'm not breaking any rules.\n\nA: Answering to your question: \n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, you do have to re-install nvidia driver every time kernel upgrades.\n\n*Experimental drivers is why they call experimental they can work flawlessly and they can go off anytime, use it at your own risk.\nAnd for the last I recommend to use Proprietary driver from Ubuntu repos or the closed driver from Nvidia official source, which is considered to be the best solution for your video card, it includes all the latest features and support as it's being developed by your graphic card native vendor.\nIn addition read this manual written by me.\n", "Q: Ralink RT3090 in Ubuntu 14.04 -- Very bad reception + keeps disconnecting I've upgraded from 12.04 (actually Mint 13) to 14.04 (actually Mint 17) (64bit), and my Wifi reception with my Ralink RT3090 is now very bad. I only get good connectivity if I'm in the same room as my wifi router, whereas previously or in Windows 7 I could connect to the router from a significantly larger distance. Also, the nm-applet now shows only 2 networks tops (the strongest ones), whereas previously I'd get a very long list.\nSince the wifi still works well in Windows 7, this shouldn't be a hardware issue.\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: I did this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*Write if you have leafpad:\nsudo leafpad /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf \n\nif you have gedit:\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\n\n*Add these lines at the end of the file:\nblacklist rt2800usb\nblacklist rt2x00lib\nblacklist rt2x00pci\nblacklist rt2x00usb\nblacklist rt2800mmio\nblacklist rt2x00m\n\n\n*Save and close the file\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The Linux Ralink drivers don't work well with the newer kernel and are having all kinds of problems. It defaults to the ra2800 drivers which doesn't seem to want to work well with Wireless N networks.\nCheck your dmesg for rt2800usb_entry_txstatus_timeout errors, if you find a whole bunch of them then this is probably what's causing your network issues.\nhttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62781\n", "Q: Kernel update (64) will not boot.

But whichever apt-get command I use does what it has to without fail.(For example I tried installing blender with sudo apt-get install blender and it installed fine though it showed the above error.) After this I even got a kernel update(from 3.13.0-27 to 3.13.0-29 via the Software Updater), but even now the issue persists. How do I solve this issue?\n\nA: As this question/answer surmises, linux/smp_lock.h was a file used in old 2.6 kernels. It no longer exists in Ubuntu, nor should it.\nYour system it trying to compile a driver for an ancient kernel version. Just look at the error output:\n.../usr/local/bin/ztemtApp/zteusbserial/below2.6.27 modules\nDump ztemtApp (whatever that is) and either replace it with a version for a modern Kernel or just ignore it. It's not compiling so if you're not missing anything, I'd suggest you just remove it and leave it at that.\n\nA: If you look at the results from this Google search result, you might get an idea of the cause of the trouble.\nI think this issue is due to some broken package and to clean out broken packages, I think these are available in the Safe start boot menu\n\n\n*\n\n*\"enable network\"\n\n*\"clean\"\n\n*\"autoremove\" \n\n\nMaybe try them out in that or similar sequence.\n(This is from my own memory so check what there actually is and use them in a sequence that feels suitable to you.)\nAlso if you type ONLY (followed by ENTER)\n\n$ apt-get\n\nat the prompt you will see short info about each option. These should be the same ones as in the boot menu.\n\n$ info apt-get \n\nwill tell more.\n\"Use the force, Luke\"  (read up on the options - use them in a sane manner!)\n\nA: I solved this issue with help from the link that Hannu provided(Okay, the first search result, which is, this). From that link I understood that deleting the package named crossplatformui that had got installed(without my knowledge) when a Reliance data card was used in my PC recently would solve the issue. I did it with Synaptic package manager as shown by the image below:\n\nAs it is evident from the image I searched for the package and selected it for complete removal. After that I clicked Apply and the package was removed. After this I tried using apt-get commands and the above error(in my question) did not appear. \nPS:-\nFor those wondering about the actual issue here, Oli's answer here clearly explains it. Quoting his answer:\n\n...\"Your system is trying to compile a driver for an ancient kernel version\"...\n\nThis line of the error(in my question above) tells it all! :-\n/usr/local/bin/ztemtApp/zteusbserial/**below2.6.27**/usb-serial.c:34:28: fatal error: linux/smp_lock.h: No such file or directory\n(Look at it saying below2.6.27 which means crossplatformui is only supported below kernel version 2.6.27 while my present kernel is 3.13.0 and so it caused the error.)\n", "Q: IRC chat on Telepathy I'm trying to figure out how to get IRC working on Telepathy.\nI have installed the telepathy-idle package as suggested here and here.

This is a rather dumb question but my googling didn't give me any direct anwser. So I have a computer which ubuntu (12.04) filesystem has gone corrupted. Now I want to try to repair it with fsck from a live usb but since there are alot of important files (mainly pictures) I want my files not to get deleted. So I'd like to know that does fsck keeps my files when I start the repair process?\n\nA: fsck does not touch your files. It is basically a front-end program that does all kinds of filesystem checks (ie. it checks the integrity of the journaling system). \nIf you run it interactively it will report on what it did. The checks it runs are:\n** Phase 1 - Check Blocks and Sizes\n** Phase 2 - Check Pathnames\n** Phase 3 - Check Connectivity\n** Phase 4 - Check Reference Counts\n** Phase 5 - Check Cyl groups\n\nand below this it will show a summary of \n\n\n*\n\n*Number of inodes in use \n\n*Number of fragments in use \n\n*Number of unused fragments \n\n*Number of unused non-block fragments \n\n*Number of unused full blocks \n\n*Percentage of fragmentation, where: free fragments x 100 / total fragments in the file system \n\n\nBesides checking inodes and blocks fsck also checks for incorrect . and .. entries and incorrect directories.\nMore reading material (links from wikipedia on fsck): \n\n\n*\n\n*adminchoice.com\n\n*Oracle docs\n\n*lwn.net\n\nA: You are on the correct track, running fsck either from liveCD or from rescue mode. Mainly you file system (esp / partition) should be umounted before running fsck therefore you would need to use recovery mode or use liveCD.  \nfsck.{ext2/3/4,btrfs,xfs} etc does a lot of work in phases, to fix both the metadata and data corruption in your FS also identifying and bad sectors (which will only be marked not to use, and remains unfixed) on the underlying storage. It actually depends on the underlying file system as every file system (ext2/3/4,btrfs,xfs) has a unique design and have its own version of fsck, if you like to understand the exact details its best to go through the source code. \nNOTE: its important to make multiple runs, if your previous run had errors and some were fixed, this is because the metadata is fixed sequentially. Keep running until the previous run had no errors.   \n", "Q: What actions does Ubuntu trigger when battery is low? When the battery is low, the screen gets dimmed after a few seconds already.\nThis appears to be some special power-saving mode, and might be related to the time in org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power.time-low (1200 seconds (20 minutes) the default).\nWhile this seems to get triggered by gnome-settings-daemon, I wonder what else Ubuntu does when this happens (e.g. via DBus listeners), or other event listeners that look for a \"low battery\" state.\nIt seems like something in this regard causes Ubuntu / X / the system to behave more sluggish afterwards (when the laptop is on AC again), and I would like to look into what might be causing this.\nI could not find anything related via dconf-editor, e.g. in org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power.\nIt appears to get setup via idle_configure in plugins/power/gsd-power-manager.c, but it's probably something more related to something that listens on the DBus interface, which gets notified via e.g.:\n    if (!g_dbus_connection_emit_signal (manager->priv->connection,\n                                        NULL,\n                                        GSD_POWER_DBUS_PATH,\n                                        \"org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties\",\n                                        \"PropertiesChanged\",\n                                        props_changed,\n                                        &error))\n\nI could imagine that some \"power saving\" property gets set, but not unset when AC is available anymore and/or the battery is not low anymore.\nI have looked at the CPU governor setting (/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor), but it was ondemand.\nI am using gnome-settings-daemon with awesomeWM on Ubuntu 14.04.\ngnome-settings-daemon=3.8.6.1-0ubuntu11.1\n\nI've also compared gsd's plugins/power/gsd-power-manager.c with the one from Debian's gnome-settings-daemon-3.12.1, but could not find anything obvious that might have been fixed/changed in this regard.\nI have managed to trigger the gnome-power-manager's gnome-settings plugin (which dims the screen etc), by patching upower and use it after killing the system's upower daemon.\n(note that it's probably only energy that is being used by gpm to calculate it by itself).\nIt does not make the system become sluggish..\nOTOH I have not heard the speaker's beeping, which might come from the BIOS, which might be involved here, too - or other programs using the kernel's interface on /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/.\n--- src/linux/up-device-supply.c.orig   2014-06-07 16:48:32.735920661 +0200\n+++ src/linux/up-device-supply.c    2014-06-07 16:48:39.391920525 +0200\n    @@ -821,6 +821,9 @@\n        supply->priv->energy_old_first = 0;\n    }\n\n+   percentage = 3.1f;\n+   time_to_empty = 3*60;\n+   energy = 5;\n    g_object_set (device,\n              \"energy\", energy,\n              \"energy-full\", energy_full,\n\n\nA: If you look at the \"Power\" tab in System Settings, you have the option to choose what happens when the battery reaches a critically low level.

My question is what is difference between installing perticular desktop environment on Ubuntu And Using directly that (Default -environmented) distro/flavour of Ubuntu?\nExample: Two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ubuntu-gnome-desktop or kubuntu-desktop or xubuntu-desktopetc. (official & recognized derivatives) alternatively on Ubuntu\n(Default -Unity Desktop)\n\n*Use (Run) perticular distro/flavour Ubuntu-Gnome or Kubuntu or Xubuntu etc.\n\n\nI want to know is both method working same performance? and which is proper method to use Desktop Environment.\n\nA: They are not different\nSuppose you have already installed Ubuntu and want to try Kubuntu. Most of the stuff is already there. Install the Desktop Environment (DE), option 1. \nNow you have both. Each DE comes with some default applications. You can use any application in any DE. You can log out of one DE and log back into the other DE. Your files will be in the same place, just the environment will look and work different. \nNow suppose you like KDE better and don't like Unity. You have another computer, and you want the KDE on that one. Install Kubuntu directly on the computer. Go for option 2. Kubuntu uses the KDE Desktop Environment, Ubuntu uses Unity by default. But they are both the same distro (Ubuntu).\nDefault Applications\nThe default applications are different in different DEs. Some DEs have more common default applications than others. For example Unity and Gnome have many common default applications. The default applications in Unity and KDE are somewhat different. If you start with Unity, and install the Kubuntu-desktop, option 1, you will have the default applications of both the DE.\nIf you go for option 2 and install Kubuntu, you can still install some default applications of Unity if you like them better. For example, you can install Firefox, the default browser in Ubuntu in a fresh Kubuntu installation.\nThe difference between the flavors are in the set of packages installed. However, all flavors of Ubuntu use the same repository for downloading updates, so the same set of packages is available regardless of which flavor you have installed. New flavors have to go through a process to become a Recognized Flavor.\nReference: Ubuntu Flavors\nHope this helps\n", "Q: recover data in linux removed with rm Today i deleted my home directory (in wrong action) with:\nsudo rm -rf *\n\nAnd when i use extundelete i get this message:\nroot@ubuntu:~# sudo extundelete --restore-directory /home/hamed/ /dev/sda2WARNING: Extended attributes are not restored.\nLoading filesystem metadata ... 746 groups loaded.\nLoading journal descriptors ... 29931 descriptors loaded.\nSearching for recoverable inodes in directory /home/hamed/ ... \n498 recoverable inodes found.\nLooking through the directory structure for deleted files ... \n498 recoverable inodes still lost.\nNo files were undeleted.\n\nwhy it can't recover?\nAnyone can help me to return my Desktop, Documents and etc?\nI have ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Haven't dealt with this myself but have a look here:\nCan files/directories deleted with rm be restored?\nUnfortunately rm doesn't move files to trash.\nI suspect that extundelete may work but it's going to require some serious reading of the docs.

I know about lxc-freeze and lxc-unfreeze, but as I understand it, these simply pauses the container, similar to sending SIGSTOP and SIGCONT to a process. If I reboot the host, then the containers will cease to exist, right? \nI would really like a way to save state to persistent storage so that I could resume them at some later time, even the host is rebooted or something like that. I can achieve exactly what I want using VirtualBox by using the \"Save machine state\" mechanism, but if I could do it with LXC, it would be completely awesome. \n\nA: You want lxc-checkpoint, which is not yet implemented, at the time of writing (Jun 2014).\n\ncheckpoint the specified container NAME and dumps its state into the file FILE. If the option --pause is specified, the application will be stopped after the checkpoint just before resuming execution. The command lxc-unfreeze will resume its execution.\nActually, this command does not operate. Its description helps to define a CLI api for future Checkpoint / Restart solution\n\n", "Q: How can I get MintMenu running in KDE?

Is there any way install budgie desktop environment on Ubuntu and is  it safe to install it?\n\nA: Budgie desktop can be installed with a PPA since a few days. It is still a beta so expect bugs and non-functional features.\n\nBudgie is the flagship desktop of the Evolve OS Linux Distribution, and is an Evolve OS project. Designed with the modern user in mind, it focuses on simplicity and elegance. A huge advantage for the Budgie desktop is that it is not a fork of another project, but rather one written from scratch with integration in mind.\nThe Budgie Desktop tightly integrates with the GNOME stack, employing underlying technologies to offer an alternative desktop experience. In the spirit of open source, the project is compatible with and available for other Linux distributions.\nAlso note that Budgie can now emulate the look and feel of the GNOME 2 desktop, optionally, via a setting in the panel preferences. An example of this is shown in a screenshot further down.\n\n\n\nFeatures in the 0.8 release\n\nIconTasklist: Add pinning support\nIconTasklist: Use .desktop files for quicklists\nIconTasklist: Use .desktop files for icon resolution\nIconTasklist: Support “attention” hint (blue blink)\nPanel: Support dark theme (used by default)\nAdd Menubar applet\nPanel: Initial autohide support (manual, not automatic)\nPanel: Support shadow onall screen edges\nPanel: Dynamic support for gnome panel theming\nRunDialog: Complete visual refresh (bootiful)\nBudgieMenu: Add compact mode, use by default\nBudgieMenu: Sort items by usage\nBudgieMenu: Remove old power option\nEditor: Add all menu options to UI\nSupport from GNOME 3.10 up to 3.16 (unreleased, git)\nwm: Kill workspace animation (resolve after v8)\nwm: Better animations for changing of wallpapers\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:evolve-os/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install budgie-desktop\n\n\n\nImportant information\n\n\n*\n\n*Budgie released version 0.8 so it is still in development and a beta.\n\n\n*No nnative network management; can be fixed by using Ubuntu's applet.\n\n\n*Budgie is intended for the Evolve OS so even with this PPA it might be buggy.\n\n\n*GNOME themes work better than the native Ubuntu themes.\n\n\n*Ubuntu’s overlay scrollbars are not working.\n\n\n*If you want to read more visit the Evolve OS website.\n\nA: You can build budgie desktop from source yourself\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential gnome-common gobject-introspection libglib2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libpulse-dev libpulse-mainloop-glib0 libmutter-dev libwnck-3-dev libupower-glib-dev libgnome-menu-3-dev libc6-dev\ngit clone https://github.com/evolve-os/budgie-desktop.git\ncd budgie-desktop\n./autogen.sh\nmake \nsudo make install\n\nIf you are using Ubuntu 14.04, you can try my unofficial budgie desktop PPA\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:sukso96100/budgie-desktop\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install budgie-desktop\n\n(Update-2014.11.09)You can now use Budgie Desktop Offcial PPA\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:evolve-os/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install budgie-desktop\n\n\nA: 16.04\nThe budgie-remix team maintain a PPA containing the latest budgie-desktop for 16.04 (and 16.10) users.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:budgie-remix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install budgie-desktop\n\nLogout and login to the budgie-desktop\n\nbudgie-desktop needs a compatible theme - at the time of writing we recommend either arc-theme, adapta or paper-gtk themes. moka icon-set and arc-theme are available in the PPA.\nBug reports go to the project issues page\nsource for this is my blog\n16.10\nv10.2.7 of budgie-desktop is available from the universe repository for 16.10 users.\nsudo apt install budgie-desktop\n\nThe latest available version of the desktop is available in the budgie-remix PPA (same instructions at 16.04 above)\n", "Q: Can't detect wireless networks with an Intel Wireless 5100 I’ve been searching the forums for two days now, but none of the answers seems to work for me.

My goal is trying to run .swf files through Firefox and NOT a standalone player.\nWhen trying to run local .swf files on Firefox 29.0 (currently on 14.04), the browser opens the Open With/Save File prompt window even if the browser has the Flash plugin installed. Right-clicking on the file and clicking Open With... > Firefox just makes the browser open a new tab and then the prompt to Open With/Save File again. Selecting Firefox through that prompt window will still just make Firefox open the prompt again on a new tab.\nWhen accessing .swf files online, though, they run normally and Firefox even shows the Lego-looking plugin indicator in the address bar saying that \"Adobe Flash\" is enabled for the address I'm accessing the .swf from.\nIn Firefox's preferences' Applications tab, SWF Files are currently set to \"Use Shockwave Flash (in Firefox)\", so I don't get why it won't do what it says for the case of local files.\nUPDATE:\nApparently, Firefox has separate \"Shockwave Flash File\" entries in the Applications tab of its Preferences for different mime-types. Found a workaround which I entered below.\n\nA: Found a workaround here which is based on an Arch thread here.

I've slowly been adding all of the programs that I use regularly to Ubuntu, so that I will eventually be able to do everything in Ubuntu that I could on my Windows machine.\nOne of the last things I need to migrate over is Popcorn Time. I have finally installed the application on Ubuntu, and I have finally gotten VPNAutoConnect installed as well. However, on Windows, I have one extra precaution set up: a messagebox that pops up when the Popcorn Time icon is clicked, which asks whether the VPN is connected or not. If Yes is clicked, then the application will execute. If No is clicked, it asks whether the user knows what a VPN is and then asks them to either connect it or get off my computer (this was useful because my roommate and girlfriend would sometimes watch movies when i was not home, so this was an extra safeguard to make sure they checked).\nI want to make the same messagebox in Ubuntu. Here is the script I used in Windows:\nreturnvalue=msgbox(\"Is the VPN connected?\",4,\"VPN Authentification\")\n\nIf returnvalue=6 Then\n\n    Dim objShell\n    Set objShell = WScript.CreateObject( \"WScript.Shell\" )\n    objShell.Run(\"\"\"C:\\Users\\*********\\Downloads\\Popcorn-Time\\Popcorn-Time.exe\"\"\")\n    Set objShell = Nothing\n\nElse If returnvalue=7 Then\n\n    returnvalue=msgbox(\"Do you know what the VPN is?\",4,\"VPN Authentification\")\n\n        If returnvalue=6 Then \n        x=msgbox(\"Please connect to the VPN\",0,\"VPN Authentification\")\n\n        Else If returnvalue=7 Then \n        x=msgbox(\"Please get off my computer\",0,\"VPN Authentification\")\n\n        End if    \n\n    End if\n\nEnd if\n\nEnd if\n\nHow would I go about creating this same type of script in Ubuntu? \n\nA: One approach would be to use Zenity. For example:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nif zenity --question --text=\"What do you choose?\"; then\n    zenity --info --text=\"You pressed \\\"Yes\\\"!\"\nelse\n    zenity --info --text=\"You pressed \\\"No\\\"!\"\nfi\n\n\nA: You will probably need to use xmessage\nFor example: xmessage -center -buttons yes,no Are you connected to the VPN?\nExample script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nxmessage -center -buttons yes,no Are you connected to the VPN?\n\nans=\"$?\"\n\nif [[ \"$ans\" == 101 ]]; then\n        #command to connect to VPN\n        notify-send \"Connecting\"\nelse\n    notify-send \"Not Connecting\"\nfi\n\n\nA: I answered you on Reddit as well, but this is easier.\nThe way I'd do it is to check the output of the ifconfig command for the existance of a tun or tap interface. Most likely, one of those will be created when you connect to the VPN.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nif ifconfig -s | grep -qE \"(tun|tap)[0-9]+\"; then\n    # Run popcorn time\nelse\n    zenity --error --text \"VPN is not running.\"\nfi\n\nifconfig is used to configure network interfaces. If you don't supply any arguments, it will return all the available network interfaces along with a bunch of information about them. The -s flag makes it only output a small list of the interfaces. My ifconfig -s when connected to a VPN looks like this:\n➜  ~  ifconfig -s\nIface   MTU Met   RX-OK RX-ERR RX-DRP RX-OVR    TX-OK TX-ERR TX-DRP TX-OVR Flg\neth0       1500 0   5302413      0      0 0       1971869      0      0      0 BMRU\nlo        65536 0    323789      0      0 0        323789      0      0      0 LRU\ntun0       1500 0         0      0      0 0            15      0      0      0 MOPRU\n\nAs you can see, on the last line there's an interface called \"tun0\", which is the interface that my VPN connection uses. Since it's there, I know that I'm connected to my VPN. If you want to learn more about ifconfig, see man ifconfig.\nThe | (pipe) character \"pipes\" (sends) the output of the first command into the second command - grep.\nThe grep command searches through input text for anything that matches a pattern. The -E flag tells it that the pattern is an \"extended regex\". What that is is a bit too much to explain, but if you're curious, you can read man grep. The pattern I've supplied, (tun|tap)[0-9]+ will search for a string that starts with \"tun\" or \"tap\", followed by at least one digit. The -q flag tells grep that I don't want it to output the actual text that it found, I'm just interested to know whether it found something or not.\nBy putting that in the if statement, the condition will be true if grep finds a matching string, so the code within the then clause will be run. If it fails to find a matching string, the code in the else clause will run.\nLines starting with # are comments - code that is ignored and not run. Since I don't know where Popcorn Time is installed, I don't know how to run it, so you'll have to fill that in yourself.\nThe first line, starting with #! is called the \"shebang\". That line simply tells your shell (the thing that you use to run the script with) what program it should use to execute the script. In this case, we probably want it to use bash.\n\nSomeone in the comments suggested that you look at the output of the route command, which could be good, but when I tried it it was pretty slow. If you had multiple VPN connections and you wanted to check that a specific one was up, then the route command would be much better (because you could look up a specific IP address), but for the simple use-case, I don't think it's necessary.\n", "Q: How do I get wireless working on an Asus X552VL?

(I've never much cared for GRUB 2, and I try to avoid it as much as possible.) I do have an alternative, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter the firmware and disable Secure Boot. (You can re-enable it later if you like, but it's easiest to turn it off for now.)\n\n*Prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R with the appropriate image of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Boot to rEFInd. You should see at least one option for Windows and at least one option for Ubuntu.\n\n*Test the rEFInd boot options. It's OK if some don't work, so long as you can get into both Windows and Ubuntu. If not, stop and report back or try another approach.\n\n*If you can boot both Ubuntu and Windows, boot to Ubuntu and install rEFInd there. You can use the Debian-package download link near the top of the downloads page or use the PPA described later on that page.\n\n\nWhen you reboot, you'll be brought into rEFInd and should be able to boot both OSes, bypassing GRUB. If you've got stray entries, you can remove them by deleting files or by editing the /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf file: Uncomment the dont_scan_dirs or dont_scan_files line and adjust the values to blacklist the unwanted entries. If you disabled Secure Boot but want it active, you may be able to enable it at this point, although you may have to register the refind.cer or refind_local.cer key (a program to do so should launch when you reactivate Secure Boot and reboot; the file should be in the EFI\\refind\\keys directory on the ESP). That said, Secure Boot can be a bit hairy, and you may need to jump through some more hoops to use it.\n", "Q: Which version of Ubuntu for Toshiba NB500?

So your big files download would seem \"fast\" but browsing VOiP and other activities that don't require much data but need fast response would seem slow. try ping -c 2 ir1.fp.vip.gq1.yahoo.com or some other odd domain you never visited and look at the time if it's > 100ms that would be your problem if it's < 3ms then it's your ISPs server. You can also try tracepath somedomain.com\n\nA: You're probably on the right track to specify a name server.  The one you choose (8.8.0.0) doesn't resolve, and would end up adding lookup time to your browsing.  Try specifying (8.8.8.8) instead.\nAlso try using the resolveconf's header file function so that you can leave all the other default's from your dhcp untouched and just add a nameserver header.\nUpdate your /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head to:\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\n\n\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\nBy the way, I don't know why the file defaults to saying do not edit by hand.  I believe the purpose of the file is to edit by hand.  It's really the /etc/resolv.conf file that is overwritten.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04: Low screen resolution I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Toshiba DX1210 and have not been able to change the screen resolution from 1280x1024 when the specs say that it supports 1920x1080. I have tried installing the drivers for the Intel HD Graphics 3000 graphics card (v1.0.5 (64bit) from: 01) which did not have any effect.\nI have tried running xrandr and adding a new mode but have not been able to get this to work as when I try to switch to the new mode there is an error (I think because it is above the \"maximum\" of 1280x1024). Here is the output of xrandr:\nFailed to get size of gamma for output default\nScreen 0: minimum 1280 x 1024, current 1280 x 1024, maximum 1280 x 1024\ndefault connected primary 1280x1024+0+0 0mm x 0mm\n    1280x1024      77.0* \n\nI only have the one monitor which has a built in display and am not using any software such as VirtualBox. I had some trouble installing Ubuntu and eventually figured out that the nomodeset option needed to be set. I have tried disabling it after installing those drivers but the display did not work (blank screen after the Ubuntu logo when booting) and needed to re-enable it again to log in.\nHow can I get my system to fully accept the drivers I installed?\n\nA: Adding undetected resolutions\nDue to buggy hardware or drivers, your monitor's correct resolutions may not always be detected. For example, the EDID data block queried from your monitor may be incorrect.\nIf the mode already exists, but just isn't associated for the particular output, you can add it like this:\n$ xrandr --addmode S-video 800x600\n\nIf the mode doesn't yet exist, you'll need to create it first by specifying a modeline:\n$ xrandr --newmode <Mode``Line>\n\nYou may create a modeline using the gtf or cvt utility. For example, if you want to add a mode with resolution 800x600 at 60 Hz, you can enter the following command: (The output is shown following.)\n$ cvt 800 600 60\n# 800x600 59.86 Hz (CVT 0.48M3) hsync: 37.35 kHz; pclk: 38.25 MHz\nModeline \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\n\nThen copy the information after the word \"Modeline\" into the xrandr command:\n$ xrandr --newmode \"800x600_60.00\"   38.25  800 832 912 1024  600 603 607 624 -hsync +vsync\n\nAfter the mode is entered, it needs to be added to the output using the --addmode command as explained above. \nFrom: X/Config/Resolution\n", "Q: Is it possible to have kcrash/crashdump switch to a VT when dumping? I've set up linux-crashdump to debug issues with lockups by following the instructions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/kernel-crash-dump.html\nHowever, when I try to test using: echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger, my screen just goes blank. This happens if I'm in X or even if I'm in VT1. Does it have to do with the fact that my VT is in framebuffer mode? When I try the crash I have no idea if the dump is working or if my system is just frozen.\nWhen a crash does occur, I'd like to have some indication that something is still going on. Is there a way to configure kcrash to switch to a non-framebuffer VT when dumping? Or is this technically impossible?\n\nA: I figured out how to do this. Basically you need to make sure kexec loads the vga16fb.ko module, which allows it to work in framebuffer mode. This can be done by adding --module=vga16fb.ko to the KDUMP_KEXEC_ARGS setting in /etc/default/kdump-tools. For example, mine looks like this: \nKDUMP_KEXEC_ARGS=\"--elf64-core-headers --reset-vga --module=vga16fb.ko\"\n\nThe --reset-vga parameter was there from my first attempt. It didn't originally work but I left it in there.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 wake up immediately after suspend My laptop is Toshiba M840. When I suspend, my laptop auto resumes immediately.

A workaround is to add set(Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS 3.4) before the find_package statement. Note that I filed a bug about this issue.\nSince CMake 3.0, CMake searches up to Python 3.4, so installing that version manually should also fix the problem.\n\nA: I recently had a similar issue with Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit; apparently, CMake does not look into architecture dependent install folders by default:\nCMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes for the package. Under\neach prefix several directories are searched for a configuration file. The tables\nbelow show the directories searched.\n\n[...]\n\n  <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib|share)/cmake/<name>*/          (U)\n  <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib|share)/<name>*/                (U)\n  <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib|share)/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/  (U)\n\n[...]\n\nIn all cases the <name> is treated as case-insensitive and corresponds to any of\nthe names specified (<package> or names given by NAMES). Paths with lib/<arch>\nare enabled if CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE is set.\n\n(from CMake 2.8.12 online documentation of the find_package command)\nA solution consists in setting this CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE in the project root CMakeLists.txt file (in your case that would be editing src/packages/OGF/gel_python3/CMakeLists.txt) before calling find_package for PythonLibs; for instance:\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)\nproject(project_name)\n\n# Check the architecture and set CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE accordingly\nif(UNIX)\n  if(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)\n    set(CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE \"x86_64-linux-gnu\")\n  endif()\nendif()\n\nfind_package(PythonInterp 3.2 REQUIRED)\nfind_package(PythonLibs 3.2 REQUIRED)\n\n# Rest of your file\n\nThat worked in my case.\n", "Q: How do I remove nitrogen back to Ubuntu's default wallpaper manager?

As you can see form /etc/pam.d/chsh, it's doing a check:\n# This will not allow a user to change their shell unless\n# their current one is listed in /etc/shells. This keeps\n# accounts with special shells from changing them.\nauth       required   pam_shells.so\n\nThere's also a man page for this check (man pam_shells) which tells us the following:\npam_shells is a PAM module that only allows access to the  system if the users shell is \nlisted in /etc/shells.\n\nIt also checks if /etc/shells is a plain file and not world writable.\n\nSo by the sounds of it, you don't have a /usr/bin/zsh line in /etc/shells. Let's add one:\necho $(which zsh) | sudo tee -a /etc/shells\nchsh -s $(which zsh)\n\n\nEither that or your current shell isn't listed on there. If you're stuck on something like rbash, that might not be a listed example and that might stop you from changing shell.\nI tested (removed the zsh line from /etc/shells, loaded zsh and tried to chsh) but saw a very different error message:\nYou may not change the shell for 'oli'\n\nSo it's probably not this.\n\nA: situation on my home machine was\n/etc/shells had not only multiple entries of /usr/bin/zsh.\nBut no entry of /bin/zsh.\nThe test of which zsh | sudo tee -a /etc/shells\nwould return a good result. \nA quick manual edit so /bin/zsh was the only zsh related entry was enough to correct nothing.\nAfter that I did a delete of the /home/usr/.oh-my-zsh directory (I kept my .zshrc file), and did a full reinstall and that removed the chsh problem.\nPerhaps a combination of some bad oh-my-zsh file and a bad shell file created the error?\n\nA: In my case the problem was my user was created with no shell (no shell in passwd file for my user). I had to change the shell as root.\n\nA: To complement Oli's excellent explanation with a simple fix for the You may not change the shell for 'username' error, courtesy of this answer:\n# Set the shell for the current user to '/bin/bash' in this example,\n# which works even if the current shell is (unexpectedly) not listed in '/etc/shells'.\nsudo usermod --shell /bin/bash $USER\n\n", "Q: What exactly is the Linux kernel and does Ubuntu use a modified Linux kernel? What exactly is the Linux kernel? And does Ubuntu, at the core, use a modified Linux kernel? In what manner is it distinguished by the NT/Windows 8 kernel?\n\nA: An operating system kernel is the central part of the operating system, handling all main tasks. It is loaded into a protected area of memory at boot time. Kernel space, where the kernel carries out its tasks, and user space, where everything else happens, are kept separate. The /sys directory contains a virtual filesystem that provides a view of kernel data structures and objects from user space.\n\nThe Linux kernel is a monolithic kernel originally developed by Linus Torvalds, who still directs its development. The latest vanilla kernel can be downloaded from kernel.org, and Ubuntu kernels (patched by Ubuntu kernel team) are available from the Ubuntu mainline kernel ppa\nThe kernel is found in the /boot directory. When a new kernel is installed (for example, as part of a routine update and upgrade procedure) old kernels are not automatically removed, and over time the /boot directory becomes full, and this can cause serious problems if /boot is on a small separate partition. To prevent this, users should periodically run sudo apt autoremove to clean up (actually the initrd.img file for each kernel is larger than the kernel itself, but that is removed along with the kernel by autoremove). It is advisable to keep at least one \"spare\" older kernel. The user can select which kernel to boot from the GRUB menu. The newest kernel (with the highest release number) is booted by default.\nThe release number of the running kernel may by checked with the command uname -r\nFor more details, see the documentation maintained by the Ubuntu Kernel Team.\nSource: 'kernel' tag wiki\nReference: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel\n\nA: Linux kernel Wiki\nTo understand an difference between Win vs Linux kernel\nUbuntu Linux kernel derives its kernel from the vanilla kernel d(using linux.git and stable branches) and builds its own version of supported kernel.\nModified kernel is a user requirement for building a custom kernel from the sources (either from upstream or ubuntu sources) for testing a new device driver etc.\nGitKernelBuild \nMy 2 cents!

I have symlinks to Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Music, and Videos which link to a second hard drive.  I am mounting the other hard drive through /etc/fstab.

Please help.\nBeen honest, I was hoping that ubuntu work as good as OS X since all the MacBook Pro are practically the same machine, and for my bad luck, a lot of things are missing, the automatic key light and brightness do not work, the keyboard do not work as I was expecting (same functions as in OS X), a trackpad too sensible, well a lot of thing that work but not as they are supposed to do.\n\nA: No wonder you are having power issues with your computer. There are a few things you can do to get your computer behave as it should when running Ubuntu, I will describe them next but first there is some theory you should know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple manufactures their products in a tightly integrated way to achieve the great performance one often can appreciate on them; as such it is absolutely normal that when running their HW with their SW it behave (almost) as an homogenous unit. But when you install anything else to the same HW - or conversely their SW on another HW - it is logical to expect rough edges and funny behaviour.\n\n*GNU+Linux has made a lot of improvements in the lasts years regarding power consumption and most of it thanks not to HW manufacturers but to the amazing hackers that contribute their grey-matter to the kernel and the different open-source related projects as Ubuntu. It is easy for other platforms to achieve great power consumption performance when manufacturers build their products specifically tailored for those systems following their specs.\n\n*The biggest problem nowadays regarding laptops becoming hot is the GPU hybrid model as its management still's not fully implemented in all GPUs combinations under GNU+Linux.\n\n\nWith that in mind there is a couple of things you can do to achieve a near perfect power consumption performance under Ubuntu - as well under most other distributions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch off your DIS (discrete) GPU if you're not using it\n\n*Use TLP - and ThermalD when your HW allows it\n\n*Use PowerTop to learn what parts of your HW should be set to stand-by and make the changes permanent by loading them on every boot by using /etc/rc.local and /etc/pm/sleep.d\n\n\nAs a result of applying these simple steps I could squeeze an extra and half hour when using battery on my crappy laptop (HP Pavilion dv7-4287cl) not to mention it keeps cold almost all the time: it isn't just when using the DIS GPU or 'forcing' the IGD GPU when watching 1080p videos full-screen, running Google Earth and so on.\nNote: I acknowledge that setting your system to behave as you expect regarding power consumption isn't as easy as 1,2,3 GO! in Linux and I myself have been researching the subject for quite some time now, I will be updating this answer with a step-by-step guide when the blog post is ready.

The question does not aim at specifically the described observation - rather at those \"things\" in general on Ubuntu.\nMy question is: How could this be possible? What is the difference between sudo X and runnding X as root?\n\nA: That's somewhat too broad to explain it will end with conclusion like in a link that you linked to your question, but I'll try something more fullfilled maybe it will give you some answers.\nsudo (\"substitute user do\") allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.\nSudo is an alternative to su for running commands as root. Unlike su, which launches a root shell that allows all further commands root access, sudo instead grants temporary privilege escalation to a single command. By enabling root privileges only when needed, sudo usage reduces the likelihood that a typo or a bug in an invoked command will ruin the system. Sudo can also be used to run commands as other users; additionally, sudo logs all commands and failed access attempts for security auditing.\nMore detailed info about Root Sudo can be found on Official Ubuntu Documentation\n\nA: This tutorial is taken from the original homepage:\n   Sudo in a Nutshell\nSudo (su \"do\") allows a system administrator to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root while logging all commands and arguments. Sudo operates on a per-command basis, it is not a replacement for the shell. Its features include:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ability to restrict what commands a user may run on a per-host basis.\n\n*Sudo does copious logging of each command, providing a clear audit trail of who did what. When used in tandem with syslogd, the system log daemon, sudo can log all commands to a central host (as well as on the local host). At CU, all admins use sudo in lieu of a root shell to take advantage of this logging.\n\n*Sudo uses timestamp files to implement a \"ticketing\" system. When a user invokes sudo and enters their password, they are granted a ticket for 5 minutes (this timeout is configurable at compile-time). Each subsequent sudo command updates the ticket for another 5 minutes. This avoids the problem of leaving a root shell where others can physically get to your keyboard. There is also an easy way for a user to remove their ticket file, useful for placing in a .logout file.\n\n*Sudo's configuration file, the sudoers file, is setup in such a way that the same sudoers file may be used on many machines. This allows for central administration while keeping the flexibility to define a user's privileges on a per-host basis. Please see the samples sudoers file below for a real-world example.\n\n\nRoot\nUNIX root account is all or nothing.\nIn computing, the superuser is a special user account used for system administration. Depending on the operating system (OS), the actual name of this account might be root, administrator, admin or supervisor. In some cases, the actual name of the account is not the determining factor; on Unix-like systems, for example, the user with a user identifier (UID) of zero is the superuser, regardless of the name of that account  and in systems which implement a role based security model, any user with the role of superuser (or its synonyms) can carry out all actions of the superuser account. The principle of least privilege recommends that most users and applications run under an ordinary account to perform their work, as a superuser account is capable of making unrestricted, potentially adverse, system-wide changes.(a) \n(a) from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser\n", "Q: When you uninstall a program on Ubuntu, does the software leave any residue? Computer systems like Windows have tons of software residue that is left when an application is installed and subsequently uninstalled. \nDoes Ubuntu have the same problem? Would my 5 year old Ubuntu install run the same as the day of install (not counting some of the system upgrades) if I uninstalled all the software I had installed on it over the years?\n\nA: Ubuntu/Linux is set up in a differrent way.\nYes, traces are left behind -but- they do not impact the speed of your system.\nOn Linux libraries sometimes remain on your system. We call them orphans and there is a program called deborphan that removes them. But all you gain is a bit of space on your harddisk. Speed you will not gain. You get more speed by tweaking settings or by disabling services you do not use.\nIf you want a toolset that includes deborphan install Ubuntu Tweak. \nSometimes programs leave things there on purpose. Those tend to be settings files we manually edited. If you uninstall you have an option \"--purge\" that removes those while uninstalling; otherwise you are suppose to delete them your self. But again: these just take up space (and for that matter we are talking kilobytes not megabytes) and do not impact on your speed.\n2 things related to speed: keep your / partition under 95% full and make sure your system does not need to swap alot. Those 2 are probably 2 main speed related issues. \n\nA: In addition to Rinzwind's answer, some program may leave profiles or files containing , for example, keys, passwords, names and things like personal data. Some of packets can ask you to confirm about keeping such files farther or don't keep anymore, some may not ask. It depends on particular application.\n\nA: Uninstalling software is conceptually similar in both Windows and Ubuntu: files may get removed and configuration settings may be removed. Whether or not all the files or configuration settings are removed by the uninstall process, is dependent on the software you're uninstalling, not the OS.\nSoftware (in both Windows and Ubuntu) may leave residues for many reasons ranging from simple laziness of the software creator, to keeping user settings for potential reinstallations, to consciously leaving files created by the software (an example would be a word processing software: users would be pretty mad if all the documents created with it were deleted upon uninstallation)\nGenerally, leaving files and configuration settings is a bit more frowned upon in the Linux world than in the Windows world, but in most cases any files or registry keys that are left are meant to be used only by the program in question. So apart from consuming space on your hard disk, they should not impact system performance and stability. This is true both for Windows and Ubuntu.\nHowever, programs that make system modifications, such as drivers, daemons, system tools, etc., but actually any software that asked you for root access (elevation in Windows) during the installation process, has no technical obligations to remove everything upon uninstallations, and may leave residues that can compromise system performance, stability and security. Once again, this is true for both Windows and Ubuntu.\nIf you must guarantee that uninstallations won't negatively impact your system, make sure you install only software that doesn't require root access (elevation in Windows). If you will be installing software that requires root access (elevation in Windows), then all guarantees are off, so I would recommend you stick to software publishers that you trust, and hope for the best.\nNotice that when I mention Windows, I'm talking about Windows Vista and above, which run on restricted user accounts by default.\n", "Q: How to set application lens as default in Unity Dash view and search results?

I can see no desktop elements - all I have are the desktop icons in some kind of GNOME-scheme.\nBut when I login as a guest on the guest account, Unity is working fine.\nI read and tried alot yesterday as Ubuntu 14.04 seems to have plenty of issues with lightdm, compiz, ... but nothing worked for me.\nI have two asumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Because the guest account works, it seems to be an user specific problem.\n\n*Because the guest account works, there seems so be no problem with graphic driver etc.\n\n\nTo 1:\nAre there user specific configurations?

You may want to temporarily move whatever contents you wish to save to somewhere else, remove the remaining files in $HOME, and copy the files in /etc/skel to $HOME. Doing so would eliminate your personal settings, but since you just switched from Mint I'm assuming it doesn't matter.\n\nA: This is one of those catch 22 situations where you need to fix a problem but you can't get the screens that would fix the problem to display.  On my machine everything worked in the guest account, but there was nothing I could do there that would allow changes to be permanent.  I could not get to much of anything on the user screen (after all, that was the problem) and I am not really proficient in a command line interface.\nThe (at least partially workable solution:\nLog in to your regular account.  Unity doesn't work, but a right click will bring up the window to allow me to change the background.  (not that it will fix anything!)  But it will allow you to open \"All Settings\".  From there you can open \"User Accounts\", unlock it, and set up a \"New User\" account with the appropriate privileges.  On my machine, when nothing else worked for my normal login, the new user worked perfectly!  You can then either change the settings on the new user account to fix the problem or simply change the settings in the new user account to suit your needs and keep using it!  Problem solved!

(I didn't seem to need a separate \"/boot\" partition, but that might be a quirk of my particular setup).\n\n*IMPORTANT: On the last screen of the installer, choose \"continue testing\" (NOT \"reboot\"). If you race past this and try to boot off the hard drive, it won't work -- boot the LiveUSB image again and continue with the next step.\n\n*While still running on the USB stick, install mdadm the second time -- on the hard drive -- with \"chroot\" and apt-get install mdadm (again).\n\n*Copy the first part of the first hard disk to the second one using 'dd' -- the MBR, the GRUB boot loader, and the boot partition.\n\n*reboot\nHonestly, this seems unnecessarily complicated -- I will upvote anyone who posts a simpler answer.\n\nA: Lubuntu: The Lubuntu Alternate ISO image supports installing on RAID,\naccording to the Lubuntu 14 release notes.\nAfter installation, you can later switch to whatever window manager / desktop environment you prefer -- see Switching window manager/desktop environments? .\n", "Q: How To Restrict Multiple Directories With Nginx But Still Access Files?

I would like to install Windows on the system which is already running Ubuntu. It uses UEFI and has free space on HDD so it is possible to arrange a partition for Windows without much trouble. On MBR based systems it was possible as long as you copy MBR and restore it after Windows installation. Is it possible on a UEFI system? Will I have any problems?\n\nA: You may need to repair your grub loader, using a few simple steps from the official ubuntu wiki\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\n\nA: It's possible, and if you know what you're doing, it's easier than recovering from the same situation with BIOS. Under EFI, boot loaders don't live in the MBR; they live in the EFI System Partition (ESP) as ordinary files. Therefore, the Windows boot loader won't overwrite the Ubuntu boot loader (GRUB 2, unless you install something else yourself), and there's no need to write a fresh copy to disk.\nWhat Windows will do, though, is to save its own boot loader to the ESP and then make it the default. Unfortunately, the Windows boot loader doesn't offer the option to chainload to Linux, so the result can look very similar to the result under BIOS. Under EFI, though, you have more, and in some ways easier, solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can type, in a Windows Administrator Command Prompt window, bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi to restore GRUB as the default boot loader. (If you're booting with Secure Boot active, you may need to change grubx64.efi to shimx64.efi.)\n\n*You can boot a Linux emergency disk in EFI mode and use efibootmgr to restore GRUB to its primary position. You'll need to type efibootmgr alone to get a list of installed boot loaders, then change their order with the -o option to efibootmgr, as in efibootmgr -o 2,5,3 to boot Boot0002 first, then Boot0005, then Boot0003. (EFI tries each in turn until one works.)\n\n*The EFI version 2 shell has a tool called bcfg that can do what bcdedit and efibootmgr can do. See here for some instructions on installing rEFInd with an EFI shell. Steps 12-14 are critical and can be adapted for restoring GRUB to the primary boot program.\n\n*The better EFIs let you change the boot order in their firmware setup utilities. Unfortunately, details vary from one to another, and many lack this functionality.\n\n*You can hit a function key (which one to use varies between computers) to get the built-in EFI boot manager, which usually enables you to pick between Windows and Linux. This might be acceptable in your position if you'll usually be booting Windows, but it will get tedious if you often have to boot Linux.\n\n*You can install another boot loader of your choice -- as that page details, there are several options.\n\n*You can run Boot Repair from a Linux emergency disk. This usually fixes things up, but I'd reserve it as a last-resort tool because it's a pretty blunt instrument and it occasionally makes a hash of things.\n\n\nNote that if you restore GRUB, you'll probably have to run update-grub to get it to detect Windows; otherwise you'll have traded a boot-straight-to-Windows situation in favor of boot-straight-to-Ubuntu. (One of Boot Repair's advantages is that it takes care of this -- at least, when it works correctly. My own rEFInd boot manager should auto-detect both OSes, too.)\nSo in sum, you've got a plethora of options. Using bcdedit in Windows followed by an update-grub in Linux is a pretty painless solution once you know about it.\n\nA: Unless your PC is very low on resources e.g. RAM, \ntry e.g. Virtualbox instead and run the OS'es in parallell.\nIt makes it possible to e.g. Cut and Paste from each to the other (install \"guest additions\" in the guest OS, check the menu as the you have the guest OS running). \n", "Q: Question about Tidy I just installed Geany IDE\nWhen I tried to compile HTML file I got error\n/bin/sh: 1: tidy: not found\nCan someone help\n\nA: Similar trouble can get solved by typing\n\n$ tidy --help\nThe program 'tidy' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install tidy\n\n\n... to get a hint on which packages might come into question. If there are several suggested ones, then look them up (google).\nThe \" --help\" makes MOST software respond with a first level of information. If that appears, then \"tidy\" would probably been in a place that the \"caller software\" did/does not know about, another possible cause for similar problems (hint; add to $PATH)\n\nA: Run this in a terminal to install tidy: \nsudo apt-get install tidy\n\nthen you are able to compile (F8) html files in Geany.\nIf you want to run them in the browser press F5.\n", "Q: Battery Power when running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in dual boot This is only a general question in order for me to get a better idea of my dual boot (windows 8 & Ubuntu) systems.\nI noticed that every time I run Ubuntu (which is becoming more often) the battery power gets consumed really fast. I am not performing any special tasks at the moment, just getting to know the system, for example, sound settings, watching videos, surfing the net and so on. When I do the same thing in Windows 8 the battery lives a considerable amount of time longer. \nIs this something to do with Ubuntu or is it because of the dual boot that I have going on? In other words, if I start running Ubuntu all by itself on my laptop, will it be more power consuming than Windows 8?\n\nA: No it has nothing to do with dual boot. \nMost probably there are drivers that's work is not fully optimized like in windows 8 which make it consume power, I had this problem with my AMD driver, on windows battery keep working for 4H but in Ubuntu 12.10 it was like 1H.\nProblem with me was fixed when i used Ubuntu 14.04LTS , and also a power management that can extend the battery life \nYou can install TLP power manager \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw\n\nand start using it by :\nsudo tlp start\n\nIt should write in the terminal \nTLP started in ac/battery mode.\n\nWish it help you   \n\nA: In addition to Moustafa3390's answer I'll to like to add that you might be having a Nvidia Optimus enabled laptop. In Ubuntu by default the Nvidia Graphics card is generally always onand hence the battery gets used up rapidly. I suggest you either install 'nvidia-prime' from the official repo or install 'bumblebee' to enhance battery life.\nYou can refer here for instructions\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee\n", "Q: PXe M0F and efi boot problem after ubuntu 14.04 install through efi I just recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my lenovo g500,I am a bit new to terminal.\nI previously had windows 8(My laptop came with FREE DOS per-installed) on my laptop and decide to change it with Ubuntu.

On a Dell M6800 machine that has Windows 8 pre-installed, I upgraded to 8.1, then I loaded Ubuntu 14.04 then Fedora 20 the only way I could, that is in \"Legacy\" BIOS Mode. BTW the Ubuntu install was unable to complete but Fedora did, and left all working, 2 bootable OSsen, with Grub2 from Fedora doing the boots, but Windows 8.1 is now \"invisible\".\nI have run Boot-Repair but info is not useful. It tells me to switch to UEFI which, on M6800, doesn't work with this (too long-winded to explain why here).\nI need to have the Grub2 configs \"see\" the original Windows 8.1 partition, with BIOS switched to \"Legacy\".\nBTW various posts have said make switch to UEFI to boot from, say, USB-stick or DVD; this is wrong, you can't - UEFI mode only allows boot from the Windows partition, which it says has a Windows 8.1 on it, which doesn't boot.\nBasically, if you have actually succeeded in loading Ubuntu 14.04 or Fedora 20 on an M6800, which comes with pre-loaded Windows 8, you will know how I fix this.\n\nA: For me, the fix was a sub-option of the UEFI which was to boot with the UEFI in a 'non-safe' mode.  This allows me to boot both Win8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04, whereas with the legacy option or the EUFI 'safe' option I cannot boot both systems correctly.

I'm encountering this on 2 laptops, one with a Radeon HD6290 (integrated GPU), the other with a discrete RV710 card. The RV710 needs a specific power setting to prevent overheating under LMDE, fortunately it doesn't seem to overheat with the Ubuntu default setting.\n\nA: The change you noticed is not Ubuntu specific, it is due to runtime power management now being enabled by default in the Linux kernel. For most users this is a good thing - it means that the power of the GPU can adapt to runtime use, instead of being fixed at whatever the BIOS set it to. To revert to the previous behaviour, set the kernel parameter radeon.runpm=0.\nThe video card should not require any manual settings to prevent overheating. If you find that it does, then it may be a hardware issue (eg. fan needs cleaning). If you think the problem is software (works fine in another OS, or with proprietary driver) then report a bug on the mailing list, IRC channel or bug tracker at Xorg radeon.\n\nA: After more testing, it seems it was mostly the Pepper Flash plugin that was the culprit. With all Chrome's hardware acceleration settings on, I now get very good streaming video playback with the radeon driver, while the proprietary driver still tears, The latter tears even when using Adobe's own Flash player, which is from the same era as the legacy fglrx driver, so something must have changed on the content level too, maybe forcing software rendering which the modern Radeon driver does better (if not only because I built it, with settings optimised for the local CPU)?\nAnyway, I'll be moving the G62's install to Kubuntu with the Radeon driver as it performs better on the things that matter and no longer shows the overheating issues.\nNow, if only I could find a way to prevent the screensaver/locker to kick in while watching fullscreen streaming video (even with the mouse cursor in a \"don't lock\" hot-corner) ... but that's a different topic :)\n", "Q: Shell script read problem I'm trying to create a shell script with a read command, so that when I run the script, it will ask the user a yes- or no-question.

I would like my desktop environment of choice to have its own official Ubuntu derivative, like LXQT/LXDE and Lubuntu.\nWhat steps does it take to get there? I would like to see if there is a point for effective application of my humble efforts to make it happen.\n\nA: For starters there are a few things.\n\n*\n\n*Your system needs to fill a hole in the current accepted derivatives.\nIf you create a system and base it on KDE it will not be accepted since that would be a second kUbuntu. The same goes for systems based on XFCE, LXDE, Gnome or Unity.\n\n\n*You need to have a solid user base.\nThere are so so so so many derivatives of all of the official versions supported your system needs to show it has interest. 10000+ users would attract attention.\n\n\n*You need to show you are serious player.\nLinux based operating systems come and go. Your system needs to be up to date. Needs to show it takes care of security problems. And you probably need your own repositories at some point (letting your users leech of the Ubuntu servers is not really nice) so all your users pick their software from your repository.\nAnd now for the kicker: there is absolutely no information on the Ubuntu sites on how to get an official status. So to get official status Canonical probably needs to ask you and not the other way around and they will only ask you if it is something special.\nLook at the biggest not supported spin-off of Ubuntu: Mint.\nIt got a lot of traction. On distrowatch it is even above Ubuntu but it seems it is not unique enough to get official support. Ubuntu + MATE desktop is not already an official version, they have a lot of users apparently (or a lot that visit distrowatch ;) ).

Here's what fixed it for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clear PRAM by holding Command-Option-P-R right after the Mac boot chime, and wait until the second boot chime to let go.\n\n*Boot into a Mac OS X 10.6 installation disc.\n\n*Run a Terminal, and type the following:\nbless --device /dev/disk0s1 --setBoot --legacy --verbose\n\n*Shutdown from the installer.\n\n*Turn on the MacBook and hold down the trackpad button after the chime to eject the installation disc.\n\n*The laptop should continue booting Xubuntu after the disc ejects.\n\n\nFollowing that procedure got me down to a white-gray screen delay time of only about 4-5 seconds.  Note that the \"--verbose\" in the bless command is optional, but it will give you more debugging information that might be helpful if something still isn't working right.\nIn case it makes a difference, I should also mention that I wiped my hard drive before installing Xubuntu and accepted the default values for a full-disk install.  That ended up automatically partitioning my hard drive as GPT with the first partition as a 1MB BIOS Boot Partition (type 0xEF02), the second partition as ext4 for the root filesystem, and the third and final partition as 1GB of swap.  Xubuntu 32-bit always requires booting in BIOS mode, so the proper boot partition for me to feed to the \"bless\" command was \"/dev/disk0s1\", and the \"--legacy\" flag tells the Mac to boot using BIOS-compatibility mode.  Your specified boot partition and whether you use the \"--legacy\" flag or not would likely change if you're booting Xubuntu 64-bit in EFI mode, though I can't say I'd recommend that on this particular laptop unless you've upgraded and maxed out the RAM.\n", "Q: Cannot execute binary file I am new to Ubuntu and I'm trying to install Popcorn Time.\nI downloaded 32 bit version and tried to install it but that's where the problem started showing.\nI double clicked the executable file and well, nothing happened. It's a official download from their website but it doesn't work. Maybe I'm doing something wrong... Anyway, I found out that you can install it from a script, but people keep talking in Ubuntu terms and I don't understand it, so I have a few questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*How to make a script? (which I'm suppose to run in terminal using bash command), \n\n*Is it normal that i cannot run the installer, and if that is an installer or just files for the program.\n\n*If it is an installer, how do I make it work?\n\n*What does \" Cannot execute binary file\" mean?\nThank you in advance, hope I'm not asking too many questions (please understand that I'm new to Ubuntu) and sorry about my English. xD\n\nA: Question 1\nScripts are simple and fun to write in ubuntu/linux . Here are some good links that really helped me.\nMind the syntax though.\nhttp://www.freeos.com/guides/lsst/\nhttp://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Main_Page\nhttp://www.yourownlinux.com/2013/08/getting-started-linux-shell-scripting.html\nQuestion 2\nYes it is really normal that you are unable to run that installer as that might not be your system specific installer.Ubuntu can easily understand .deb , .rpm , .sh also .exe but using a special software called WINE.\nhere's an article for installing wine if you need it.\nQuestion 3\nLinux is secure so it might have made your installer dysfunctional.In other words might have made it non-executable.So you make it executable by following this.\n1. right click on that installer.\n2. open permissions tab\n3. check the option that says \"allow executing file as a program\"\n4. press close button.\n\nNow double click that file and you should see a box saying display , run in terminal and some others.\n\nPress run in terminal.\n\nNow you may get some other errors or it will run perfectly if it is right for your OS.\nQuestion 4\nThis simply means this is not an ready to execute file.So make it executable using the answer to question 3.\nI have tried to talk in non-ubuntu terminology as much as possible.I hope it helps you.\n", "Q: Is 14.04 LTS sufficient for for dual CPUs I am totally new to UBUNTU (and dual CPUs).  Do I just download the current iso (14.04 LTS 64-bit) from www.ubuntu.com/download/server, or do I need something else to support a server using dual cpus?  \nI have a Dell PowerEdge R720 server with dual Intel Xeon E5-2637v2 4c 3.5GHz CPUs; with hardware based RAID (PERC H710P); iDRAC7 Express...

I did it manually by formating the mount and home folders without touching the Windows partition. Apparently it didn't detect the Windows OS.\nBut there is a 'Windows boot manager (on /dev/sda2) entry on the grub menu but it doesn't do anything. I can only boot into Ubuntu.\n\nA: I faced that problem when  I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS alongside my pre-installed Windows 8. \nAfter installing Ubuntu I ran the recommended repairs in Boot Repair. However, the grub menu disappeared and my laptop booted straight to windows 8. Inside windows I opened a command prompt as administrator and typed in this command exactly as it is:\nbcdedit /set \"{bootmgr}\" path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\nAfter it concludes successfully just restart your computer and grub should turn up with functional boot for both Windows and Ubuntu.\nI strongly recommend reading this though. (if you have not already)\nA small tip when installing Ubuntu using the “Something else” option, create a swap partition (if you have not done that already) that is twice your RAM size at least. If you have an SSD then just forget the swap partition. \n\nA: Boot into Ubuntu. Terminal.\nsudo update-grub\n\nThen reboot.  This should auto detect all boots and rebuild Grub.\n", "Q: Remove Ubuntu bootloader from Windows 7 dual boot I have an old hard drive that I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a few weeks ago, and a new hard drive which has Windows 7 installed. I am using these in a dual boot. I am using the Windows 7 bootloader and I added Ubuntu through a program called EasyBCD. This worked perfectly, untill I updated Ubuntu. Now when I choose Ubuntu from the Windows 7 bootloader, it takes me to the Ubuntu bootloader (on the second hard drive), which makes me choose what OS to boot again. How can I disable/skip this second bootloader? (I want to use the Windows 7 bootloader, and not swap).\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\nA: You very well may want that bootloader one day! ;)\nBut try this and see if you like it:\nsudo -i gedit /etc/default/grub\nLook for:\n'GRUB_TIMEOUT=10'\nChange that to 0. This will make the countdown on the grub screen 0, and it will boot the default OS. MAKE SURE Ubuntu is your default selection, or it will just boot back to windows!\nThen:\nsudo update-grub\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu 14.04 and now Windows won't boot My laptop came pre-installed with Windows 8.1.\nI set up dual boot. All seemed fine and I accessed Ubuntu with no issues after selecting it from the menu to select the OS. I should add that the boot method was changed to legacy.\nHowever, since using Ubuntu, I no longer have the ability to select the OS. The laptop simply boots straight into Ubuntu.\nI therefore attempted to access the recovery options, only it appears the Windows 8 bootloader has somehow been corrupted as I am now told to use the Windows 8 recovery disc (which, as this was pre-installed - I do not have).\nI have tried boot repair again without success.

If possible, there is sometimes a UEFI / no secure boot option which works best for me.\nInstead of working with GRUB directly I use grub-customizer which handles most anything that I have needed to do, and since it does this in a nice easy graphical interface, it's my preferred option.  One thing that it does is scan the HDD to look for alternate OS's to put into the boot menus.  You can find the instructions for getting this program here on Ubuntu Forums\n\nA: RESOLVED\nGuess whatever happened had somehow corrupted the files and even though the Live CD and USB worked on other computers, this laptop refused to even acknowledge the disc and USB were inserted, which resulted in me coming up against the infernal Grub Recover. \nFortunately I was using a Sony Vaio which has this awesome ASSIST button. To use this, turn the laptop off completely, then instead of pressing the power button, simply press the ASSIST button. This forces open the Sony Recovery Console.\nFrom here, it's possible to recover OS, Check and repair HDD and also access the BIOS.... so I did.\nOn a previous visit to the BIOS, I had changed the boot options to LEGACY in order to install another OS with Windows 8. I therefore changed this from Legacy back to UEFI and double checked the boot order. I then saved, restarted and I now have the option to select OS.\n", "Q: Setup my ssh server, can't connect remotely I installed openssh-server. I am able to ssh into the server via my ehternet local network, I can ssh from the local host. I have set up port forwarding on my router. I have run 'sudo ufw allow 22/tcp' to ensure my port 22 is open.\nBut everytime I try to connect remotely, i.e. ssh my_server_ip, I get the error:\nconnect to host my_server_ip port 22: Operation timed out \nI have no idea how to fix this.\nWhen I use a port scanning service online my port 22 is open, and I have told the router to do port forwarding to the server for port 22.\n\nA: Some routers have a problem traversing NAT when trying to connect to a server, using its external IP, but on the same LAN. It should work just fine from an outside network.\n", "Q: Mouse click firing twice I have recently switched to XUbuntu (14.04) and I have noticed that sometimes a mouse click is fired twice.\nE.g. I CTRL click a link and two tabs with the same content are opened in my browser. It's not behaviour I can reproduce consistently and seems to be random (to me). I also don't know of a good way to inspect the behaviour properly for debugging purposes. I have checked the double click time setting but this doesn't seem to have any impact on this.\nI also run XUbuntu (13.10) in a VM on my MacBook Air and this behaviour seems to absent there. At this point in time I can't really tell if this is related to the distribution or the fact that it runs in a VM.\nAny insights greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The multiple click problem has happened to me a couple of times since now; in both cases was a faulty mouse. My opinion is that the quality of the switches in most modern mice is at least questionable.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the mouse in another machine with (possibly) another operating system. \n\n*If you can, try to blow the mouse interior with compressed air (there are electronic-grade bottles around). That solved my problems once. \n\n*If the problem persist just on your computer/operating system, now it's time to search for a software problem. \n", "Q: pipelight Libraries: FAILURE I installed pipelight and then executed this:\npipelight-plugin --system-check\n\nThe last lines of the output were:\nlibXrender.so.1: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXrender.so.1\nlibxslt.so.1: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxslt.so.1\nlibXxf86vm.so.1: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXxf86vm.so.1\nLibraries: FAILURE\n\nWhere do I find an explanation or a log?

You can find a list of really essential libraries at http://pipelight.net/cms/faqs/faq-libraries-missing.html\nSome libraries are only required for very specific use cases like libnetapi.so which makes it possible for Wine to interact with Windows servers and Windows network shares. This is not used by any of the supported plugins and you do not need to care about it. There was also a bug report at https://bugs.launchpad.net/pipelight/+bug/1327518 to fix these remaining libraries and most of them should be fixed in the next release (except libnetapi.so which is not multiarch ready on Ubuntu yet).\n\nA: Not sure if you are after a certain end-result.  But I ran through a lot of problems with pipelight and in the end I was able to run:\nwine-browser --no-pipelight --windowed\n\nthis runs firefox within wine, which seems to work fine.\n", "Q: How to install «Hip Hop» on Ubuntu 14.04 I would like to try Hip Hop on Ubuntu 14.04, but on the website, there is only a .tgz file, and I have no idea how to install it.

I currently have no space left on my hard drive, but I want to increase my Ubuntu partition which would also require me to decrease the size of my Windows partition, but will doing this with Gpart or the standard windows partition manager cause any loss of data? If it will, is there a safe way of doing this?\n\nA: Only use Windows partition manager to reduce the size of that partition.  Windows 8 (and probably windows 7) will shrink its partition while the operating system runs, and ensure that there is minimal data loss.  There is always a possibility that this will not work, so backup what you need to.\nGParted can be used to increase the size of, or add a partition to, your Ubuntu system.  You will probably need to boot from a live CD (or USB) to be able to perform this task, and it does take a goodly amount of time to complete.  After booting from the USB, open a terminal and type\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nwhich will install gparted onto your USB.  You can then run the program from the USB to dismount the HDD Ubuntu partition, resize it, and remount it.\n\nA: You may want to double check, but I think you would want to use Windows to make its own partition smaller, and linux to use up that free space afterwards.\n\nA: Before shrinking a Windows volume,it's a good idea to use Windows disk defragmentation before shrinking the partition, as Windows will put the files together at the beginning of the disk.\nThen, as others mentioned earlier, you can use gparted, but also you must have ntfs support:\nsudo apt install ntfs-3g ntfs-config gparted -y\n\nAlso, be sure your Windows 10 is completely turned off, as it will otherwise lock the disk.\nsutdown /s\n\nThen boot into Ubuntu and use gparted.\n", "Q: Ubuntu gone out of order - Wont install any packages. What do I do? Lately, I've been getting some strange behaviour from Ubuntu. First and the most important is that  it wont install updates. It gives a package installation error and it simply wont work. \nEarlier I tried to install TeamViewer via the Software Center, but got the same package error. I also feel like the connection speed is going slower than it should - don't know if this one is relevant to this case.\nWhat's wrong with my installation? How do I fix these package installation errors?\n\n\nA: This is a very common recurring Ubuntu question.  It's asked in many different ways.  However, the answer is always the same.  I run into the problem often when having broken packages.  I review this link:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/461975/i-cant-edit-update-remove-or-install-my-broken-packages\n$ sudo apt-get autoremove\n$ sudo apt-get --purge remove && sudo apt-get autoclean\n$ sudo apt-get -f install\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a\n$ sudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nYou performed most of them.  There are still a couple more that can be added.  But so far the ones in the list has fixed my corrupted Ubuntu broken package problems.\nAs far as Teamviewer installation you have after you have fixed the broken package problem try this:\n$ sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0\n$ sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n$ sudo apt-get update\n## (Download the latest 32-Bit / 64-Bit Multiarch go to the download and run)\n$ sudo dpkg -i teamviewer_linux.deb\n\n\nA: It sounds like a similar problem I was having with a kernel earlier today. I came across this site which actually fixed it. I had to manually fix it by editing the dpkg status file. \nBut before doing any of this make a backup of the original status file so you can revert back to it if this does not fix it.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n*Then locate the corrupted package. Remove the whole block of information pertaining to it, save then exit.\nIf you dont know which package is causing this you could run:\n\nsudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nand that may tell you which packages you are having troubles with, e.g.\n\nErrors were encountered while processing\n  /var/cache/apt/archives/ (package name here)\n  E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1) \n\nI really cant tell because I dont know what error messages you are getting within the terminal. But if that sounds like it may help, it would be worth the try. Plus if it does not you could always restore the backed up file. One thing, I would not reboot until I knew if it worked or not. Good luck!\n\nA: There is a chance that /boot partition is full and in that way, installation and update will fail.\nTo check if that partition is full, open a terminal and type the command df and it will show something like:\nFilesystem              1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu-root 959421896 379475996 531218164  42% /\nudev                       832664         4    832660   1% /dev\ntmpfs                      168352       576    167776   1% /run\nnone                         5120         0      5120   0% /run/lock\nnone                       841752         0    841752   0% /run/shm\ncgroup                     841752         0    841752   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\n/dev/sda1                  233191     27581    193169  13% /boot   <==== Note this line\n\nIf Use% for /boot is like 99% you will need to clear old package backups.  Check what is in your folder /boot with the command ls /boot.  If you are seeing a lot of files like initrd.img-3.2.0-##-generic vmlinuz-3.2.0-##-generic (where ## are version numbers like 40, 41, 42, 43 and you may find like tens of copies) it is actually safe to remove some old copies.\nUse the command to remove old copies:\ndpkg --get-selections|grep 'linux-image*'|awk '{print $1}'|egrep -v \"linux-image-$(uname -r)|linux-image-generic\" |while read n;do sudo apt-get -y remove $n;done\n\n(Credit to this link, modified to make it work in ubuntu)\nThen run sudo apt-get autoremove to clean up dependencies.\n", "Q: my computer won't boot up from the cd It also is built by myself.

It won't matter what account you do this from, so you could even use a guest account if you are worried about security. \nIf that is not enough (there may be permissions problems), you can share the xauthority.

The easiest solution is to install from the netboot image.\n\nA: Because this problem doesn't have an eminently easy software-based solution, I'm here to offer a hardware-based one. \nIf at all possible, grab the HDD out of your laptop (one of the participants in the thread FourZer0 linked to mentions an Amazon review saying it's fairly straightforward if you're willing to poke around). Now, not knowing very much about Packard-Bell, I'm going to assume they didn't reinvent the wheel in the interest of pleasing Microsoft, and are using the standard SATA HDD connection. Slide you HDD out and swap it for one in another machine (laptop or desktop, won't really matter) and install from there with your \"unsecure BIOS\" then drop it back in your laptop. \nI would warn that if the BIOS is really that locked out, it may be looking for Windows to boot, so I wouldn't go erasing Windows before you boot on your laptop- you can do that later anyway.\nI realize this isn't the most elegant way to go about things, and may be inconvenient for you, but it does appear the simplest way to me, at least. \n", "Q: Problem expanding Ubuntu partition I have 50 GBs of unallocated space on my hard drive and I want to expand my Ubuntu partition to fill that space; however, when I run gparted in a live version of Ubuntu and turn the swap off, it only allows my to expand my Windows partition into the free space but won't let me do the same with the Ubuntu partition. Any idea as to how I can fix this?\n\nA: To expand your Ubuntu partition you will need to boot from a USB or CD, unmount the HDD ubuntu partition and resize it using gparted.  Create the USB, boot from it, open a terminal and load gparted\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nThen you can resize the ubuntu partition of the HDD.\nI'm updating this slightly - The new space that you intend to use must be contiguous with the partition that you intend to expand\n", "Q: Unable to ping inside or outside network with default gateway 0.0.0.0 I've been around here before and I could usually piece together everything to more or less get myself up and running, but this time I'm truly stumped.\nI'm trying to connect my new 14.04 install to a network, and I'm forced to be behind my college's router.

If you decide you like it, double click the icon on the desktop that says \"Install Ubuntu\" at this point you'll be given the option to either erase Windows, or partition to install along side it. I'm going to assume you want to install along side your Windows partition, so choose that and the rest should be fairly straight forward. \nIt sounds like you've used Ubuntu before, but are more comfortable with Windows, so I'm going to refer you to the Linux Mint page (linuxmint.com). Mint is built on top of Ubuntu, and is designed to be easier for people coming from Windows to get used to, but of course feel free to choose any Linux distro you like. \nFinally, if when you restart your computer you in stead see Windows loading, wait for it to load, then restart your computer again. You will need to access the computer's BIOS by pressing a certain key (usually escape or delete).

THe default username and password are 'ubuntu' and 'temppwd' respectively. I wanted to know how can i change the default user to 'root' and password accordingly?\n\nA: You don't switch username to root. The root user is in the system, but with Ubuntu, you rarely use the root user directly, but rather select one or more users who can act as root, by using commands like sudo. \nWith Ubuntu the first user always has that capability. So in your case, if you want a root shell, you can enter sudo -s. You'll then be asked for your password and you'll enter \"temppwd\". But it's better to run commands with sudo directly, such as sudo cat /var/log/auth.log, because then you'll be able to see who controlled the root user in a specific way. For instance, this is the last log entry in my auth.log: \nJun  9 09:09:15 jedesktop sudo: jo-erlend : TTY=pts/2 ; PWD=/home/jo-erlend ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/cat /var/log/auth.log\nHaving different users control the root user elimintates the need to share passwords and it provides more fine grained control of rights. However, if you do want people to log in as root, you can activate the root user by giving it a password, using the command sudo passwd root. \nBut what you'll most likely want to do, is to add a new user, make this user a \"sudoer\" and then remove the ubuntu user from your system. A user becomes a sudoer if you add it to the \"sudo\" group on modern versions or \"admin\" on older versions. \n", "Q: Remove evolution-calendar-factory from startup Is there a way of removing it from startup?\nI don't need it and I'm not using evolution at all.\n\nA: Ubuntu won't allow you to remove evolution-calendar-factory because this is a library shared by many programs.\nIf you try to execute: sudo apt-get purge evolution-data-server or sudo apt-get remove evolution-data-server your system will be broken!\nYou can test these commands in the terminal using the -s flag (simulate) (be careful!)\nsudo apt-get remove evolution-data-server -s\n\nAnd you will see that the ubuntu-gnome-desktop would be removed, and after next reboot, you won't be able to log in to the system any more. :(\nSo, do not remove evolution-data-server.\n\nA: If you're using Gnome or Gnome-Shell, it seems you cannot remove evolution-data-server, since it will remove also the entire DE\nroot@europa:/home/user# apt remove evolution-data-server\nReading package lists...

[Y/n] n\n\nIf you still want to get rid of those annoying and resource-greedy processes, you can just delete (or, better, rename) the directory of their executables:\nroot@europa:/home/user# mv /usr/lib/evolution /usr/lib/evolution_DISABLE\n\nThen kill all the running processes:\nroot@europa:/home/user# for procname in $(ps aux | grep evolution | awk -F'/' '{print $NF}' | grep evolution | grep -v grep); do killall $procname; done\n\nThis way, Gnome won't be able to restart them anymore. \nWorked for me without any visible collateral damage.\n\nA: If you want to remove evolution-data-server, it will remove these at least (tested in 16.04)\nThe following packages will be REMOVED:\n  evolution-data-server gdm3 gnome-contacts gnome-shell libfolks-eds25\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 5 to remove and 378 not upgraded.\nAfter this operation, 15.8 MB disk space will be freed.\n\nSo, the better treatment is a bit nasty, but it works!\nNasty Hack!\nRename Evolution binary folder, so that it won't be found! What works for me is these\nsudo mv /usr/lib/evolution-data-server /usr/lib/evolution-data-server-disabled\nsudo mv /usr/lib/evolution /usr/lib/evolution-disabled\n\nThat's it! Now, I can at least use the system.\nNotes: If you disable evolution this way, you won't be able to use calender syncs or other fancy (useless for me) stuff.\n\nLess dirty hack (update)\nLooks like more and more people are unsatisfied with evolution lately. But in my current setup, I don't rename the folder. Instead I just remove the executable bit and it works.\nFor disabling calendar process, I used\nsudo chmod -x /usr/lib/evolution/evolution-calendar-factory\n\nThe good thing with this method is other evolution service can still work (they start and runs)\nRepeat the same process for evolution-source-registry and evolution-addressbook-factory if you want to shut them up too!\n\nA: So, if you think the above answers are too poisonous to your system (ripping out gnome-desktop prereqs, deleting/renaming packaged files? No thanks!), I may have a solution for you.\nCreate ~/.config/upstart/kill-evolution-services.conf and populate it with the following code.  Be sure to replace USER with your username.\nstart on desktop-start\nstop on desktop-end\n\nscript\n  ME=USER\n  GIVEUP=60\n  while ! pgrep -u \"$ME\" -f '^/usr/lib/evolution/evolution'; do\n    GIVEUP=$((GIVEUP - 1))\n    if test $GIVEUP = 0; then\n      break\n    fi\n    sleep 1\n  done\n  pkill -u \"$ME\" -f '^/usr/lib/evolution/evolution'\nend script\n\nThis will run on login, wait until the evolution services have started (up to 60s, adjustable with GIVEUP), then kill them.  From what I've seen (on 16.04) they'll stay dead until you interact with some application that needs them, like gnome-calendar (the app, not the indicator).  To counter this, you can add the following to crontab (run \"crontab -e\" from terminal).  Again, be sure to replace USER with your username.\n*/1 * * * * pkill -u USER -f '^/usr/lib/evolution/evolution'\n\nThis will try to kill evolution services once per minute.\nSo we're rid of evolution services without driving apt crazy or even calling sudo.  Allegedly the memory usage issues with these services has been fixed in Gnome 3.20, but Ubuntu has yet to backport them to 3.18.  Keep an eye on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/indicator-datetime/+bug/1589605, even though it has nothing to do with indicator-datetime, from what I can tell.  The indicator runs fine without evolution services at the lightdm login, anyway.\nIf any of this ends up having side effects on your configuration, you can simply delete ~/.config/upstart/kill-evolution-services.conf and remove the crontab line (again, crontab -e from a terminal).  Then log out and back in for good measure, if you're paranoid.\n\nA: I didn't have Evolution installed, but still had this running as well.\nRemove the package evolution-data-server via the Software Center. Or type this into a terminal: sudo apt-get purge evolution-data-server. Then log out and back in, it should be gone.\nN.b.

Without knowing more about where you got the script, I would have to guess. It is possible that the author has simply used the desktop file for gcolorpicker as a template for his own, simply forgetting to change the GenericName and Icon. But it is pure speculation. \nIf you've installed the script globally, you can look for the desktop file in /usr/share/applications. It should be called something like \"infidelity-settings.desktop\".

I right-clicked a PDF file, chose Properties > Open With. MPE was not listed. I clicked Show Other Applications but MPE was still not on the list. I tried opening the PDF file with MPE, editing, and then closing it. MPE still did not show up.\nSo how do I make MPE the default program, or at least appear on the Other Programs or Show Other Programs?\n\nA: If Master PDF Editor (MPE) is not listed all you need is to create a MasterPdfEditor.desktop file.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/MasterPdfEditor.desktop\n\nCopy and paste the following, and then save and close the file.

Otherwise, you will create a file called mpe.desktop but it will not be detected by the 'Open with' dialog.\n\nA: To set the file associations :\n\n*\n\n*Right Click on the file\n\n*Choose Properties\n\n*Go to the Open With tab.\n\n*Choose your file viewer. For eg. Master Pdf Editor\nNow click the button, Set as Default\n\nNow, when you reopen the file/application again, then it will open in your set default application.\n", "Q: How to install Recoll's python:epub helper?

Im not a computer geek, but i wish someone will help me to install the latest ubuntu os to my lenovo laptop with windows 8 pre installed. If i removed windows 8 as my os can i still use my other programs such as autocad, photoshop, sketch up with ubuntu?\n\nA: No, you will not be able to use those programs. \nThis is because Ubuntu is an entirely separate operating system and the applications have to be installed within said OS. \n(Note: OS=Operating System)\nWhile those programs may have linux compatibilty, you'd have to install them within Ubuntu. \nHowever, may I ask what is your reasoning for installing Ubuntu?  There may not be a need to replace Windows 8 with Ubuntu, and installing Ubuntu on a pre-configured laptop can have adverse effects on the system (As I have encountered). \nI suggest either installing Ubuntu side-by-side with your windows installation, which is referred to as dual booting. (Refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot). \nIf you really want to remove the Windows 8 OS and replace it with Linux, I suggest formatting your hard drive first to wipe the Windows installation (Refer to http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows7/ht/format-hard-drive-windows-7.htm)\nThen install the latest LTS version of Ubuntu which is currently 14.04 LTS (Refer to http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/)\nNow all you need is to burn that image onto a disc.

At the moment I manually use the mouse to set focus to firefox, refresh it, and then put the focus back to IDE.\nHow can I add a keyboard shortcut that would make the currently active tab of a visible browser refresh the page, with focus staying where it currently is?\n\nA: You can use a xdotool-based shell script for that.\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nThen write a simple script like this one:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nWID=`xdotool search --name \"Mozilla Firefox\" | head -1`\nxdotool key --window $WID F5\n\nName it and place it as you wish.

Everything is working ok and if I run phpinfo I get that the version is \nfrom cli:\nPHP 5.4.17-1~precise+1 (cli) (built: Jul 17 2013 18:14:06)\n\nfrom web:\nPHP Version 5.4.17-1~precise+1\n\nBut if I run php-config5 --version I get\n5.3.10-1ubuntu3.11\nAnd now when I try to install phalcon it compiles it for php5.3 instead of php5.4.\nI've read on the forums that I need to use the right phpize for 5.4 when building it. But I have two files phpize and phpize5 (same for php-config and php-config5) and both point to php5.3 version\nStev\n\nA: Either you haven't upgraded php5-dev package - try searching for a package: dpkg -S $(which php-config5) and upgrade the package using ppa to match the php version.\nThe other most probable cause is some local forgotten installation of php5.3 - look in /usr/local\n", "Q: Install old QtCreator on Ubuntu 14.04 I want to build my application on Ubuntu.

The icon is a must-have for my application.\nI've heard this comes from the version of Qt, since 5.0 the SniQt that makes an AppIndicator would not work any more.\nSo I figured, if I compile my application with Qt 4.x, it must work.\nBut how do I install this \"old\" version?\n\nA: Both QT5 and QT4 are in main Ubuntu repository for 14.04\nYou can simply install QT4 as\nsudo apt-get install qt4-default libqt4-dev qtchooser qt4-designer\n\n", "Q: Cannot Install Ubuntu 14.04 alongside windows 7 I have a desktop PC, a Dual Core 3.4ghz & 2GB of Ram.

Therefore I cannot complete the installation.\nI also already have Windows 7 on the PC but while installing Ubuntu, i don't get the prompt that there is another OS present.\n\n\n\nA: Not sure how you're installing, I suspect from a LiveCD (or USB) and you're not launching the installer from within Windows? If you do, reboot your computer from the USB or CD with the LiveCD content.\nUbuntu should see any free partitions, whether they're formatted in FAT or NTFS and should suggest to use the available space.\nIf you're not seeing any of these options, go back to windows and remove the partitions that you created for Linux. Leave the space available as untreated space, so no additional partitions or formatting, just 'free space'.\nTry to reboot again with your LiveCD and see if this makes any difference.\n", "Q: answer incoming calls automatically with Skype for Linux How can Skype for Linux be set to answer incoming calls automatically?\n\nA: *\n\n*Ctrl+O opens the \"Options/Preferences\" dialog window.\n\n*Under the \"Privacy\" tab (2nd from above - see screenhot) you can set/activate the option:     \n\n\n\nAutomatically answer incoming calls.\n\nThe same goes for the \"Video Device\".

How would I do it? So far all the guides I have read has one server in mind.\nI am also trying to find out whats the best way to backup an ubuntu server? I would like to backup as much information as possible so that during a disaster I should be able to restore to my working state with minimum effort using rsnapshot.\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: You simply need to just add the 3 servers into your rnspahsot.conf file. What I would do is this as an example:\n# Server 1 backup\nbackup  user1@server1:/etc/ server1/\n\n# Server 2 backup\nbackup  user2@server2:/etc/ server2/\n\n# Server 3 backup\nbackup  user3@server3:/etc/ server3/\n\nThe above will backup the /etc directories on all 3 servers to your local rsnapshot backup server in their respective directories e.g. server1/ server2 and so forth. You can of course add many other directories such as /home /var/www and so on.\nTo answer your other question that depends on what you really need to achieve in regards to a disaster recovery. rsnapshot is really only backing up your directories and files on the server. I personally use it for data and configuration files at a point in time and then use other tools for major disasters such as VM backup imaging tools. I assume you are using virtual machines?\n", "Q: Is there analternate for unity in 14.04? Is there a way to put unity at the bottom of the screen or is there an alternative to unity?\n\nA: I'm not sure if you mean the menu bar at the top, or the launcher which is at the left.  There is an article which discusses how to move the launcher to the bottom to make Unity a bit more OSX like, and might work on 14.04\nOtherwise you might examine some of the alternate desktops available to the gnome desktop.  Open the software center and search for desktop\n\nA: Yes there are many alternative desktop environment's other than utility.

I installed it in /usr/local/lib, but I always get the same error. In this way I can't even upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: This solution used to work for me after I had upgrade to either Python 3.6 or 3.7 and add-apt-repository stopped working:\ncd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages\n# where 35m is the file you have and 38m corresponds to your Python version\nsudo ln -s apt_pkg.cpython-{35m,38m}-x86_64-linux-gnu.so\n\nNow I have Python 3.8 and add-apt-repository stopped working again. I found another, related SO question, with this answer that worked for me. It appears that the expected filename is now just apt_pkg.so, so you have to do this:\ncd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages\n# where 35m is the file you have\nsudo ln -s apt_pkg.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so\n\nThe fact that the new expected filename is just apt_pkg.so is promising. Hopefully it means we won't have to keep doing this dance every time there's a new minor version of Python!\n\nA: Reinstall apt_pkg using:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall python3-apt\n\nThe error is primarily because of library apt_pkg.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so not being present in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages.\nRemoving and reinstalling should help.\n\nA: The problem for me was that I installed python3.7 next to python3.6 and made it the default.\nI manually run the following command:\nln -s /usr/bin/python3.6  /usr/bin/python3\n\nso python3 now points to the correct version of python ... that solves the issue.\n\nA: update-alternatives  --set python3  /usr/bin/python3.6\n\n\nA: If you're trying to upgrade 13.10 to 14.04, try following these instructions.  If you're just trying to update your current system from the command line, open a terminal and type the following:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: for me the following steps worked:\ncd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages\nsudo ln -s apt_pkg.cpython-{35m,34m}-x86_64-linux-gnu.so\n\nthe original solution is here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13708180/python-dev-installation-error-importerror-no-module-named-apt-pkg/36232975#36232975\n\nA: The following solution worked for me:\ncd  /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages\nls -la /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages\nsudo cp apt_pkg.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so\n\nIf you get an error message saying too many levels of symbolic links as shown below:\ncp: failed to access '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/apt_pkg.so': Too many levels of symbolic links\n\nThen you need to simply unlink the apt_pkg.so file. Use the following command:\nsudo unlink apt_pkg.so\n\nAnd then use the command\nsudo cp apt_pkg.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: For me this did the trick:\napt-get remove  python3-apt\napt-get install python3-apt\n\nThis problem actually is similar to this one:\napt-get broken: No module named debian.deb822\n\nA: I have managed to solve this by copying apt_pkg.cpython-34m-i386-linux-gnu.so to /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ from another desktop running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I have tried almost all possibilities found over internet like, purging python installation and then reinstalling, cleaning broken upgrade files etc, but ended up with no success. \n\nA: Just an advise: I avoid installing \"my\" python on /usr/local, but I have one dedicated directory per python version (e.g. in /opt) and I'm using virtual environments on my user account to use the python I need, which is activated by my .profile\nBy this approach, you will always avoid to change the python system expected configuration and dependencies.\nWell, I know, it's too late for your case, but...\n\nA: For me below was worth full\n    mansoor@LDEVOPS-MANSOOR:~/Documents/clients/HR/DevopsSimulator$  cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages\n\n    mansoor@LDEVOPS-MANSOOR:/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages$ sudo ln -s apt_pkg.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so\n\n\nA: I had the same issue after upgrading to python 3.9, and recreating the symlink '/usr/bin/python3' to point to the new location.\nThe only solution that worked for me, was that from a comment on the first answer, from @Kenivia: sudo apt remove --purge python3-apt\nthen sudo apt install python3-apt\nThis solved the error but uninstalled my ubuntu Software Center. But it was not a big deal, because I just reinstalled it with sudo apt install ubuntu-software and now everything seems to be working just fine\nEDIT: some issue still persisted after this (update-manger kept giving errors and wouldn't start). So I had to go back and revert the symlink /usr/bin/python3 to point to the original python3.6 location. This solved everything\n\nA: Weird, I ended up with multiple versions of python 3.9, I had 3.9 and 3.9.12 in ls /usr/bin/pyth* when I checked my version I was on 3.9.12 but sudo update-alternatives --list only showed version 3.9. What I did was\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.9.12 2\n\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.9 1\n\nThat got my sudo apt upgrade working, then I was able to just copy the .so file to apt_pkg.so\n#You might need this if the package isn't there\n#sudo apt-get install python3-apt --reinstall\n\ncd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages\nsudo cp apt_pkg.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so\nsudo apt upgrade\n\n\nA: Just in case it helps another, I finally solved this problem, that was apparently caused by python version conflicts, by redirecting the link python3, then redirecting it to the right python version:\nsudo rm /usr/bin/python3\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3.4\n\nYou may need to enter the correct python version, found with \npython3 -V\n\n\nA: I faced same problem after upgrade ubuntu 19 to ubuntu 20.

Specifically the log line that says\n21:10:18 localhost sshd[16609]: fatal: bad ownership or modes for chroot directory component \"/srv/\"\n\nIf you leave your sshd_config line reading ChrootDirectory /srv/jarvis/carl, as it is currently, then every directory in this path need to have the following characteristics:\n\n\n*\n\n*It needs to be owned by the root user (group is not important)\n\n*It cannot be group or world writable (i.e. would need chmod 755)\n\n\nAgain, these apply to /srv, /srv/jarvis, and /srv/jarvis/carl.  Unfortunately, the result of this is that this user carl will not be able to write into his top-level directory (after the chroot takes effect).  One way around this is to prepare a subdirectory there and give him ownership of it, so he has some place to create files and folders.\n\nI haven't tested it myself, but some discussions of this topic across the web has led me to believe that if you change your ChrootDirectory directive to read:\nChrootDirectory /srv/jarvis/%u\n\n(which, in your case, will always mean /srv/jarvis/carl since he's the only one that would match), sshd may treat the wildcard-matching folder differently.  You may be able to get away with the user carl owning the carl folder this way.  Again, no guarantees.  If not, the first method described should work.\n", "Q: Built in webcam installation I am following instructions to install a built in webcam.

If a user is added, deleted or modified and then you restore an old version, there may be trouble. If you can guarantee that nobody will do any operations involving /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow it will be OK.\nYou can also edit /etc/shadow, copy the encrypted password somewhere safe, do your password change, and then when needed set the password back to what it was. That way you don't need to touch anything else.\n# Obtain the old password and save it in a file\necho $(sudo grep $USER /etc/shadow | cut -f 2 -d ':') >/safe/encrypted-pass\n# Here, change the password, do whatever you need, then..\nsudo usermod -p $(cat /safe/encrypted-pass) $USER\n\nNote that the -p option to usermod \"is not recommended because the password (or encrypted password) will be visible by users listing the processes.\" So it's up to you to decide if this is a risk that concerns you.\nI prefer using commands to do this kind of manipulation, but you can accomplish the same thing manually with a simple text editor.\n", "Q: How to install canon ip1980 printer to ubuntu 14 I try to install my printer canon ip1980.

All of the users' home folders (with the exception of the special user root) are stored within a folder called /home (the equivalent of C:\\Users within Windows). Your own home folder will be in in your name; suppose your username is fred, then your home folder is /home/fred.\nIf you like the terminal, you can access these folders with the command cd and list their contents with ls. So, try these commands (ignore the bits starting with #, as they are for description only):\ncd /           # Take you to the root folder.\npwd            # Show where you are right now, i.e. \"/\".\nls -l          # List all the folders and files within the root folder.\ncd /home       # Take you to the main home folder.\nls -l          # List all the users' home folders (probably just yours).\ncd ~           # The tilde is a short-cut for \"/home/fred\" (or whatever your username is).\n               # This is also called your home folder (rather than the /home folder).\ncd /home/fred  # Equivalent to the previous command.\ncd             # Also equivalent to the previous command, because the default for\n               #    cd is to change to your home folder.\npwd            # Show where you are right now, i.e. \"/home/fred\".\nls -l          # List all of your own folders and files.\nls -lA         # Again list, but include all of the hidden folders and files.\n               # All hidden files and folders begin with a dot.\nls -la         # As previous, but include the two special folders \".\" and \"..\".\n               # \".\" simply means \"this folder\", while \"..\" means the parent folder.\ncd .           # Change to the current folder; i.e. do nothing.\npwd            # Still shows \"/home/fred\".\ncd ..          # Change to the parent folder; in this case, to /home.\npwd            # Shows \"/home\".\nmount          # View all of your mounted partitions.\n\nIf you prefer the GUI to the terminal, you can access your folders and files through the Files manager (technically called Nautilus). Click on the Files icon in your Launcher at the top right of your screen:\n\nThis takes you straight to your home folder, where you can see all of your (unhidden) folders and files. You can toggle between viewing or hiding hidden folders and files either through the menu (View > Show Hidden Files), or by pressing Ctrl+H.\nBy the way…\nIt may be useful for you to learn the difference between disks and partitions. Windows confuses the two, calling them both \"disks\". /dev/sda is your primary disk, which contains various partitions numbered /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, and so forth. The numbers do not have to be sequential.\nOn your installation, probably /dev/sda1 is your root, /dev/sda2 is /home, and /dev/sda5 is the Linux swap area, but the combination of mount and sudo fdisk -l (or sudo parted --list) would tell you for sure.\n\nA: This is how you can access /dev/sdaX partitions:\nsudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt\n\nNow go to /mnt\nNOTE: I believe there is something wrong. Otherwise your partitions should be accessible from here:\n\n", "Q: Virtual filesystem acting as a clone+difference of a master filesystem At my company about 10 devs share an ubuntu dev server. We have separate code directories, but due to our database size (about 50 GB), it isn't practical to clone the mysql database for each developer. So right now, we are all sharing a single database. However, I was wondering if this is possible:\nCreate a master filesystem (ext4) that stores the 50 GB database. This filesystem would not have a mysql server running on it and would be in-practice read-only. Create a virtual filesystem for each dev that references the master filesystem and stores a diff of each change to it. Have a mysql server running on each virtual filesystem. Then, each developer gets his own database to do whatever he wants with, while not needlessly duplicating the 50 GB database.\nI haven't looked at how mysql stores its data on the disk, but due to the desire to minimize disk i/o, I suspect that the small changes that we make in our routine testing won't create a huge diffs in the virtual filesystem.\nSpecifically, these are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this architecture possible?\n\n*Is this the easiest way to accomplish my goal?\n\n*Does such a virtual filesystem already exist?\n\n\nA: To answer your questions (next time, please number them so it's easier to refer to them):\n\n\n*\n\n*Should be possible\n\n*Does NOT sound like the easiest way\n\n*Yes, such a virtual FS does exist.\n\n\nYour idea sounds like a good use case for an overlayfs. You can use your existing database FS as the \"lower\" filesystem, and a per-developer \"diff\" FS as the \"upper\" filesystem. Overlayfs allows using directories as \"upper\" and \"lower\" so you don't need to necessarily mount databases in different directories.\nThen you'd need to configure each per-developer MySQL instance to use a different datadir.\nBy far the easiest way is to bite the bullet, equip your server with a say 1-TB hard drive, clone the database however many times you need for each developer, and either run a MySQL instance for each developer, or have one instance manage all the databases. The difference for the developers here is specifying a different port vs. a different database name. IMHO it'd be simpler to just have one MySQL instance, as it means less moving parts.\nThe factor to consider here is how long it'll take you to develop the overlayfs solution vs. how much a 1-TB hard drive costs for your particular server hardware. Your time has a cost; if you're looking at 3 days of work at (say) $50 an hour (being VERY conservative here) for a total of $1200, and the hard drive solution implies 2 hours of work plus maybe an overnight database sync which you can fire-and-forget, then you'd have a $1100 budget for a 1-TB hard drive. Plus maintenance for the big disk solution is easier since there are no \"hacks\" or trickery involved; it's just a DB server with a huge hard disk.\nOf course, if your Ubuntu server lives in the cloud somewhere, the cost of that 1TB storage slice may be higher. Still, please do consider the cost/benefit analysis to make your decision; you may end up saving money and time in the long run :)\n", "Q: Unable to locate package cedarview-drm $ sudo apt-get install cedarview-drm libva-cedarview-vaapi-driver cedarview-graphics-drivers\n\nReading package lists...

I am trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop. A clean install with a blank hard disc. The install always stops partway through with the screen saying \"Configuring bcmwl-kernel-source\". I have tried both the 64-bit and 32-bit versions, both via DVD and USB stick with the same result.

The system uses these to configure/build the kernel module for the driver. This is a driver for legacy cards and have some known bugs (no support from upstream and relatively rarely used). It is hanging on the package install step, which is probably also the step that loads the kernel module (driver).\nThe easiest way to get around this is to disable \"install updates and extra drivers\" during your installation, and then deal with configuring the wireless card after you get your system running\nSource + More information\n", "Q: MAAS DHCP Server Setup, PXE TO1 TFTP File Not Found I am setting Ubuntu 14.04 MAAS Cluoud.

So, I figure maybe I need to add a repository in /etc/apt/sources.list, but I don't which repository might have what I need, or what entry to make.\n\nA: Older Packages are pruned from ubuntu repo's and not kept around. You can either install from the debs directly, but if you want to do this in an apt-aware way your best bet is to create a local repository  in a folder on your system, place your deb's there, make your apt sources aware of the local repo, and then install the specific version. \nThe other option is to create your own ppa on launchpad servers and then you will be able to pull that directly from any computer (Warning: Debian packaging is relatively straightforward, but still requires knowledge of linux and a little bit about coding/building software). \nIt is also possible to add to your sources the repos for most recent version of ubuntu (or debian) that has the package you want, install it, and then remove the source. The disadvantage of this is that the package may be replaced in a future apt-get unless you take advantage of pinning\n", "Q: Adding a border to gnome-terminal On a new 14.04 plain vanilla Ubuntu install, with the default theme, nothing special.\nBring up a gnome-terminal window (Ctrl + Alt + t)\nThe terminal window has no border (nor does it have a resize handle btw) it's a black rectangle.\nHow can I add a 1px white border (which I find useful when dealing with multiple overlapping gnome-terminal windows)?\n\nA: Copy your favorite theme from /usr/share/theme to ~/.theme. Name the theme folder something different from what it was named in the /usr/share/theme. This way when you select your chosen them you'll find it by the name you called the folder.\nExample:\ncp -R /usr/share/themes/Radiance/ ~/.themes/MyRadiance\n\nEdit the gtk-3 folder of that new directory to make your borders any way you want them. You can also customize other components of the theme. It can be done by editing the UnityDecoration features of the unity.css file located in the apps folder:\n~/.themes/MyRadiance/gtk-3.0/apps/unity.css\n\nTo change the borders change the 0's to a different number of the parameter:\n-UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 0 0 0;\n\nYou can see all the possible editings here. Also, to use the new theme you have to install the Unity Tweak Tool.\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nTo apply this for terminal add the following to gnome-terminal.css: UnityDecoration { -UnityDecoration-extents: 28px 1px 1px 1px; }\n\nA: You can come close to the effect you're looking for if you use compizconfig-settings-manager.\nNavigate to the 'Unity' plugin and select 'Decorations'. Check the box 'Override Theme Settings' and you can give windows a 'window shadow radius' and a color and opacity.  But, you can also set X and Y shadow offsets.  Set those offsets to 0, set the shadows to white or whatever you want for active/inactive windows, turn the opacity up, and then you'll have borders (should be close enough anyway).\nHopefully it's good enough to get on with, best of luck!\n", "Q: How to install WWW::Mechanize::Firefox and MozRepl::RemoteObject?

It never used to happen on 13.10 but now that I'm on 14.04 it started showing these symptoms.\nWhat happens exactly is that on battery power it will work normally until near 50% then it either shuts down spontaneously or it freezes and the fan goes crazy until crashing. \nPlugged in, it doesn't experience any problems. It's not a heat problem because of this since I run it at full power plugged in and no issues arise.\nI tried looking in the logs but don't know exactly what to look for. I think that may be a good place to start but other than that, has anyone else seen this behavior or know how to fix it?\nWhat other specs would be useful?\nBIOS according to dmidecode -s bios-version: UX31E.210\n\nA: I just want to share my experience with an ASUS battery:\nAlso my netbook suddenly turned off when it was under 30% battery. However I never had the fan and freezing problem. I went along with it for months until one day it never turned on unplugged. It seems they define a life cycle for the batteries. My battery suddenly stopped working while it could save energy for about two hours. \nAnyway, if  you want to monitor your battery status, you can click on Battery under the power indicator to see detailed information about your battery:\n\nthen, check the Capacity percent which is the ratio of Energy when full to Energy (design). It will get lower and lower every time you recharge, until your battery will stop working some day.\n\nSo consider replacing your battery.\n\nA: Thanks for all the hints and tips on here. Like other's, I've had issues on my Zenbook UX21E for years, while it was running Windows 7. I never upgraded the OS for years, other than the traditional MS updates. Under windows, the issue was confined to sudden shutdowns while pulling the AC power. (Honestly, I just thought it was a short in the power connector, so I would just shut the unit down before unplugging.)\nHowever, last week I put Ubuntu 14.04 on this machine, and the behavior got worse. Not only would it shut down when the power was pulled, but also after about 20 minutes of use. I installed sensors and stuck it in a while-do loop, and forced the machine to work hard by running Fraqtive animations.\nSure enough, when the power was less than 75% AND the heat was 80C, the machine turned off.\nAfter reading this thread, I updated the firmware - that helped with the sudden shutdown after pulling the AC, but not when the 75%/80C limit was hit while on battery. The machine would still unexpectedly power off.\nSo - I opened up the back, and disconnected the battery for 5 minutes. After reconnecting and powering back up - I ran the sensors and Fraqtive test...\n....the machine stayed up until the battery ran dry, regardless of the CPU temperature.\nSo, best guess is that it was a combination of issues: the outdated firmware was responsible for the sudden shutdown when yanking out the AC (for all the reasons stated above), and the disconnect/reconnect of the battery clearly reset some sort of low battery reading that was inaccurate. (Whether it was the firmware in the battery or the firmware in the Zenbook that was issuing the false positive, I couldn't say.)\nAt any rate, I'm back, and the machine is quite healthy. So, thanks again to everyone.\nRob\n\nA: Finally, a reliable solution for unexpected shutdowns and hangs was discovered!\nThis seems to be working with any Asus laptop suffering from unexpected shutdowns and / or hangs while running on battery:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the following boot arguments both to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX in /etc/default/grub.cfg:\n\n\n\nintel_pstate=disable pcie_aspm=force acpi_osi=’Windows 2009′ acpi_os_name=’Windows 2009′\n\nDon’t forget to execute sudo update-grub afterwards!\n\n\n*Install the package tlp from ppa:linrunner/tlp an set at least the following values in /etc/default/tlp\n\nCPU_SCALING_GOVERNOR_ON_BAT=ondemand\n  CPU_BOOST_ON_BAT=0\n  PCIE_ASPM_ON_BAT=powersave\n  RUNTIME_PM_ON_BAT=on\n\n\n\n*Shut down the device, carefully remove the bottom cover and detach the big battery (not the tiny CMOS battery) from the motherboard for five minutes. There are plenty of youtube videos showing how to safely disassemble the various Asus laptops. With certain power management settings on the OS side, the EC (Embedded Controller) goes crazy and thus needs resetting. The only way to reset it is to detach the battery for a few minutes.\n\n*From now on, shutdowns should be gone. Take care, however, not to ever use any live USB stick or installation / recovery CDs based on Linux and using the intel_pstate driver and / or the default BIOS settings for ASPM. If you try to, you will merely reproduce the problem once again, and will subsequently have to disassemble your Zenbook once again. There are a few sad cases, like reinstalling Ubuntu itself, where you will have to boot from a live USB utilizing the problematic intel_pstate driver. Only do so when running on AC, and please repeat Stage 3 (no matter how boring) of this manual once you are done.\nP.S. Intel_pstate and the default ASPM bios settings eventually make the mobo’s Embedded Controller go crazy and persist in this state until the battery is detached from the motherboard. That’s basically how this problem is born.\n\nA: Your laptop is likely to be overheating. The state of the battery is not likely relevant to the problem. \nPossible solutions: \n1) Remove the dust from the laptop vents and insure that you are not covering the vents by placing the laptop on a soft surface like a blanket or cloth.\n2) Move the laptop to a cooler environment\n3) Obtain a laptop cooler to place the laptop on to increase airflow and reduce heat buildup.\n\nA: I have decided to register only at this forum to report about my experiences. I had problems with Ubuntu 18.10 shutting down accidentally when the battery level was below 40%. In other forums the setting Intels Virtualization Technology or V-dT in the BIOS is pointed out. I have tested these and can guarantee that there is no connection. The shutdowns are still happening. Now I have added the kernel parameters and can report that the following setting under /etc/default/grub does not fix the problem completely: (But fixes the keyboard led brightness and display brightnes handling of ubuntu)\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi='!Windows 2012' pcie_aspm=force drm.vblankoffdelay=1 i915.semaphores=1\"\n\nThe only solution, in fact, is to open the UX31A and remove the battery for at least 5 minutes. Now, regardless of kernel parameters, the regular shutdown works when the battery reaches a critical level. \nGood luck,\nE.

I am trying to compile an old version of R (2.11.1, specifically).  \"Why?\", you might ask.  Well, I have a program I am trying to run (that was not written by me, but I am hoping to use in my research) that was written in \"old\" R, and the program writer has specifically mentioned that R-2.11.1 or older must be used.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have run ./configure with no obvious errors (the entire output being far too long to post here, but I have been warned that I cannot make PDF, DVI, or HTML versions of the help pages, which I'm not too concerned about).\n\n*Next, when I pass the make command, I am met with the following error (after a long stream of successful commands):\nWarning in solve.default(rgb):\nunable to load shared library '/home/sbowerma/Programs/R-2.11.1/modules//lapack.so':\n/home/sbowerma/Programs/R-2.11.1/lib/libRlapack.so: undefined symbol: _gfortran_compare_string\nError in solve.default(rgb) : lapack routines cannot be loaded\nError: unable to load R code in package 'grDevices'\nExecution halted\n\nHowever, I have confirmed that the library lapack.so is, in fact, in the exact position it is supposed to be.\n\nA: The R-2.11.1 build process appears to compile its own versions of the BLAS and LAPACK libraries (as R-2.11.1/lib/libRblas.so and R-2.11.1/lib/libRlapack.so) by default - even if system versions of these libraries are available. For reasons I was not able to determine, these locally-built libs do not seem to properly link the gfortran runtime library (at least, not on 64-bit Ubuntu 13.10).\nUsing ./configure --help you will see\nOptional Packages:\n  --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]\n  --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)\n  --with-blas             use system BLAS library (if available), or specify\n                          it [no]\n  --with-lapack           use system LAPACK library (if available), or specify\n                          it [no]\nSo the workaround consists of making sure you have the appropriate BLAS/LAPACK (or ATLAS) development packages installed on the system and then adding the --with-blas and --with-lapack options to your configuration, e.g.\n./configure --with-blas --with-lapack --prefix=/usr/local\nThe configure report should now indicate something like\nExternal libraries:      readline,BLAS(generic),LAPACK(generic)\n\nand after that you should be able to complete the make.\n", "Q: text is not appearing at cursor in bash, can I reset it somehow?

I've recently installed the newest download, and I can't find the ISO anywhere to put onto USB (in my case, a Hard Drive).\nHere's what the download file looks like; \n\nAny help would be much appreciated!\n\nA: Try this. If it doesn't work,you might be opening with WinZIP or some other software that is showing the bulk of the image. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 liveusb boot screen graphic errors I am trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 on my Lenovo Y500 laptop. It came preinstalled with Windows 8. I want to install it in a separate partition with a USB drive. I have tried both Unetbootin and universal usb installer. But for some reason the screen after booting is crappy.\nThe screen goes blank after selecting try ubuntu or install. If I try with nomodeset option the screen only displays on a small strip on the top. Which again is split into three. Each seem to be identical. It is not decent enough to begin installation.\n\n\nThe graphic card in my laptop is Nvidia GT650M, if it helps. Maybe the problem is related to that. Can anyone help in fixing this error when installing Ubuntu.\n\nA: I diagnosed the problem to be bootloader not being able to recognize the graphics mode for the laptop. And that it is forcing an unsupported one by default which should not happen. And ends up  drawing smaller screen.\nI managed to work around the situation by adding/modifying a line in my bootable liveusb drive's /boot/grub.cfg :\nset gfxmode=1024x768\n\nThis along with the nomodeset option allows me to boot with correct graphic settings. I can see the splash and try ubuntu with full(er) resolution now.\nIf you have similar issue, try setting the gfxmode yourself. And after installing ubuntu you would need proprietary graphic drivers and also nomodeset option to boot properly.\n", "Q: tcp connection last activity or open timestamp Is there a way to get an open tcp connections latest activity timestamp or first open timestamp?\nI am trying to recycle some tcp connections and I would like to do it fairly.\n\nA: use iptables along with either LOG and ULOG target.\nThese targets turn on kernel logging of matching packets.\n", "Q: How do I get a Broadcom BCM4312 working on a Dell XPS M1330? I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop.  When I plug in the ethernet cable the internet works fine, but I can't see any wireless network in the networking manager.  The wifi switch is definitely on on my laptop!  It's a Dell XPS M1330.

In Windows, I was able to drag and drop the .sfv file onto the playing video and the subtitles would be enabled. In Ubuntu I try to drag and drop the .sfv file and it acts as though the .sfv file is a video and stops the actual video from playing. When I try to attach the .sfv file (view - subtitles - select text subtitles) I'm able to see the .sfv file I'd like to attach/open, although once I click open the file doesn't attach itself to the video.\nDoes anyone know how to help me with this situation? I'm 2 seasons deep into Breaking Bad and attempting to read the body language of the characters during the Spanish parts has gone on way too long.\n\nA: You are confusing SRT and SFV.\nSRT is a filename extension used for files containing subtitles in SubRip format. To my experience VLC automatically picks these up if you put them in the same directory as the video file.\nSFV stands for simple file verification and is solely used in the warez scene.\nTalking about warez is not allowed here as far as I know.\nYou should open the file with a text editor to verify that it really is a subtitle file format.\n", "Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of always running Ubuntu in \"Try\" mode? I don't want to lose everything on my Windows, can I just not install it and always \"try\" Ubuntu? \nWhat are the disadvantages? What are the advantages?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: When you \"try\" Ubuntu you basically run the operating system from the USB itself with everything needed loaded into memory.\nWhen you setup your USB stick it asks you for additional space to use in order to keep your data. There you can store data that you may use between sessions. For example, you can \"try\" Ubuntu, connect to a network and then restart and boot again from the USB. The network you connected to will be remembered from data saved into the USB itself.\nMain Advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not another Operating System into your hard disk. You don't have to deal with partitioning and it doesn't slow a bit your boot time by showing the grub menu.\n\n*Portable. You can boot from that USB from any PC that supports booting from USB.\n\n\nMain Disadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Things generally run slower than usual because of lower read/write speed in USB sticks.\n\n*Every time you have to insert your USB and wait for the Operating System to load through it. This can be very slow if your USB is slow itself.\n\n*Very limited disk space. The 'disk space' is essentially the space you've configured to use inside the USB (while writing the ISO to the USB). So things can get tight.\n\n\nAll of the above considering that you are booting Ubuntu from a USB stick.\nOf course, you can install Ubuntu alongside Windows and select from a menu your OS of choice on each PC restart.\n\nA: Yes, you can: there is no proprietary license to block your actions.\nAdvantages of using a Live Linux distribution:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use boot your system on any supported machine without installing it;\n\n*On any machine, the Live system doesn't alter the existing files unless you ask;\n\n*The Live system can be copied and reproduced easier;\n\n\nDisadvantages are:\n\n\n*\n\n*You system is slower: the boot will last 2/3 times a normal boot, loading new software in memory from the support will require more time and any action, in general, will be slower;\n\n*The system is read-only if you use a Live optical support;\n\n*The system can get corrupted easily and you will desire to bring a copy with you for security;\n\n*The support will deteriorate much faster and you'll need to use good quality supports (this applies on any mobile support);\n\n*The RAM usage is higher and can have spikes;\n\n*Some software can't function well on a Live system;\n\n\nA Live system is good to test a system before installing it or for doing maintenance.\nUntil better technology for removable supports is available I'd install any Linux system (you, also Ubuntu) before using it for work.\nRemember that there are also distributions - like, for example, Kali Linux (for security hardening) - designed to function primarily on a removable device.\n\nHave fun with Ubuntu.\n\nA: You don't have to lose your data. You can have a dual-boot setup. Just choose the right option in the installer. (The one that says \"install Ubuntu alongside Windows\", not the \"erase all data\" one.)\nSee the Official Documentation for a detailed guide with screenshots.\n", "Q: Install VLC on offline ubuntu i have 32 bit ubuntu 12.04 on an offline computer. I can access the internet using a different windows 7 computer and i have a memory key. How do i install vlc on my offline ubuntu computer?\n\nA: You can download it to your windows 7 computer using Cube, it is a portable package manager capable of downloading packages from any computer with internet connection (e.g your windows 7 computer) and install it back to your linux computer.\nHere is the complete tutorial on how to use it : http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/1583\n\nA: You must download a deb package from http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-debian.html move it to ubuntu and run this by clicking two times\nOr use dpkg in terminal. \n", "Q: Setting Read/Write/Execute Permissions in Linux I just created a group and I am looking to add RWX to root and the group. What command(s) can I use to set the permission to? Also I would like world to have NO permissions\n\nA: From the commandline the command is \"chmod\"\nThe Read/write/execute permissions is in the form of User/Group/Others.\nIf you want to remove the permissions you can issue the command:\n$ chmod ugo-wrx testfile\n\nThat will take away all the permissions from the testfile.\nIf you want to have only the User (the owner of the file) have access you can issue:\n$ chmod u+wrx testfile\n\nAfter removing all the permissions now the only permissions on the file would be (w)rite, (r)ead, e(x)ecute by the owner of the file.\nYou could add the group full access to the file with:\n$ chmod g+wrx testfile\n\nYou can also give everyone full access to the file by issuing:\n$ chmod ugo+wrx testfile\n\nNotice in the commands there is either a minus \"-\" or a plus \"+\".  The minus removes the specific permission the plus adds the permission.\nYou can get more details of the usage by issuing at the command prompt:\n$ man chmod\n\nYou can check the permissions of the file with the \"ls -l\" command:\n$ ls -l testfile\n\nThe argument of ls is specifying the long output.\n\nA: chown root:yourgroup target_file\nchmod 1770 target_file\n\n1770 means it's rwx for the owner and the group, and no permission for the world, and new files and subdirectories will inherit these permissions. (1 = sticky, 7 = 4 + 2 + 1 = r + w + x)\nTo do this on directories recursively, add a -R switch to the end.\n\nA: use:\numask 007\n\nin .bashrc of users that belong to group.\nThis mask results in default permissions of 770 for new directories and 660 for new files created by users.\nUser root can access all file, but if you want to access root file from users, you need ACL\n", "Q: LiveUSB will not Boot on Lenovo v570 I have a Lenovo v570 that I'm trying to do a clean install of trusty on and for the life of me I can't find any way to get it working. \nWhen I try to boot from the SD card it's on, it doesn't even list it in the boot menu. \nI installed it from 'Startup Disk Creator' from another device with trusty but still no luck. I've heard that there are a lot of problems with UEFI, which I'm guessing is the issue here but when I go into the BIOS, it mentions nothing about UEFI. \nI've tried different USB sticks, SD cards, DVDs, and CDs but still no luck. Does anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: I think maybe your computer does not support UEFI - there's a lot of reporting around troubles with installing on the v570, but it looks like some people found a solution back in 2012 - this might be what you need to do\n", "Q: Am I suppose to have a small or hidden partition HD? I am pretty new to ubuntu and linux in general. So, here is my question, when I upgraded my ubuntu 12 to 13.04 and 13.10. I have to make an adjustment on my hard drive before installing os. after installing, I notices a 33 GB volume HD. what is the purpose of it?\nthank you all and hope some feedbacks.\n\nA: Your laptop probably came with a Windows preinstalled. The hidden partition likely stores the files for the \"Reset to Factory Defaults\" option in bios, where you can wipe out everything and reinstall windows to the initial state.\nNote that if you do that you will likely lose your Linux install.\nYou can create backup windows recovery DVDs (or a blueray) from within Windows. Once you do that (as long as you trust the media you have written to) you can delete the hidden partitions and use the space for something more productive.\n", "Q: Cannot upgrade from Ubuntu 13.04 to 13.10 I know it seems like a duplicate question, but I in fact couldn't find any topics, where people have the exact problem as me.

I'm looking at standard Ubuntu, Lubuntu, or Xubuntu. I was just wondering which would be a better environment for a retail store?\nI will be using Lemon POS to start with but I am considering building my own once i learn how to do that.\n\nA: Lemon POS depends heavily on KDE dependencies, as such Kubuntu (Uses the KDE Desktop environment.) would definitely be the place to start looking. Also take the specifications into account as Lemon POS can work on any desktop environment as the needed dependencies will be installed automatically, however if KDE is to heavy for the system Xubuntu or Lubuntu may be a better choice.\n", "Q: Can I access files between a ubuntu 14.04 guest and a mac host on virtualbox guest additions? I suspect it cannot be done. The closest 'answer' I found was VirtualBox 4.3 Guest Additions on OSX guest but I would like to go with Ubuntu 14.04 guest on a iMac host. I have not been successful in installing ubuntu on my mid-2011 12,1 imac  OS X 10.9.3 even after following several guides, but I can run 14.04 on that iMac. I have virtualbox 4.3.12 with the extension pack installed and Guest Additions on the Ubuntu 14.04 guest. Fading hope.\nscott\n\nA: You can access files between host and guest operating systems. It is done via so called shared folder. This is folder on your host file system and it is mounted, and hence accessible, in the guest system.\nYou can create and set up the shared folder in the virtual machine properties - just look into it and you will easily find proper options. The tricky part is that your guest user account must belong to proper group to access shared folder mounted under guest Ubuntu - just look into /mnt to find shared folder mounting point and check the group name. After adding your account to that group and re-login, you will have full access to write and read files in shared folder.\n", "Q: Can't boot windows anymore?

If not, then it looks like your Xubuntu is the only operating system installed right now.\n", "Q: How to configure path or set environment variables for installation?

I want to get a program to run Mac programs on Ubuntu 14.04.  There is WINE for running Windows programs but I couldn't find a program to run Mac programs.\n\nA: Even though Ubuntu and OSX have similar bases (Linux & UNIX), emulation is surprisingly difficult; OSX applications run in a different display server with different display toolkits.  There was large motivation to run Windows applications on Linux, the same is not true of OSX, hence there isn't one (that's working and widespread).\nYou can check out Darling, which is an in-progress attempt at what you mention.

You can try xubuntu. Which ubuntu version you are trying to install? If you are trying 14.04 LTS you ca try 12.02 as well. If you think it's still heavy you can try Elementary OS, a dist. based on ubuntu much lighter.\nHope it helps\n", "Q: Creating Swap Partition Hello I am very new user of Linux. I am going to install Ubuntu 14.0.4 and have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The partition in which the Ubuntu will be installed, what would be the partition type primary or logical?\n\n*I also want to know that what would be the partition type of the Swap area? Logical or Primary? \n\n\nA: Linux in general (and Ubuntu specifically) have no problems booting from a logical partition, therefor its safe to use these for all partitions you choose to create. The Ubuntu installer will always create logical partitions anyways and its not a good idea to override this behavior since you can only create up to 4 primary partitions.\n(The only operating system still in use today that has problems with booting from logical partitions is Windows XP by-the-way)\n\nA: The main thing to remember is that (for some old inherited stupid reason), hard disks can only hold 4 primary partitions. To overcome the problem that in some situations, more partitions are needed, they invented logical partitions (which are basically logical divisions within a primary partition).\nLinux can handle logical partitions, not all Windows versions can.\nI barely ever use more than 4 partitions on a drive, so personally, I don't use logical partitions... but there's really nothing wrong with them.\n", "Q: MATE not showing up after install I just used Synaptic to install MATE Desktop Environment on my Ubuntu 14.04 computer.

Does anyone know why and how do I get MATE to work?\n\nA: Open a terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge mate-desktop\n\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nnow add the MATE Official repo, press y when prompted.\nsudo apt-add-repository \"deb http://repo.mate-desktop.org/archive/1.8/ubuntu trusty main\"\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthen install it:\nsudo apt-get install mate-core\n\nsudo apt-get install mate-desktop-environment\n\nsudo apt-get install mate-desktop-environment-extra\n\nsudo reboot\n\nDone. \nNow you should be able to see MATE at the login screen.\n\nA: Previous answer is not totally correct.

It should look like this.\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.110\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 4.2.2.2 192.168.1.1 \ndefault DNS are 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS), or 4.2.2.2 and the 192.168.1.1 is the router IP which ideally should be the DNS for your PC.

Upon POST, the BIOS sees it and I am able to open the tray as well; however, once the system starts to load up Ubuntu or other distros (Debian and Linux Mint), I lose all functionality.

So, I thought I would ask the community here and see what you all think. Worse case scenario, I have some dead weight to a nice little machine. Thanks!\nPS I honestly think Linux doesn't like the IDE interface the disc drive has. \n\nA: Sadly, this is apparently a known problem from long ago.

(Ubuntu installed first) Good day guys, I just installed ubuntu and it replaced my current OS Windows 7 Ultimate. Now I want to go back to windows and try to install XP but now I'm unable to install ANY VERSION OF WINDOWS because others says that it requires IDE as controller. Unfortunately, I can't change it in BIOS at startup.Please help guys :(\n\nA: If you tried out Ubuntu, and you found it's not your cup of tea, great. However, I would not recommend installing Windows XP, as it is no longer supported by Microsoft as of April 8. I would suggest either A) just go back to Windows 7 or B) try out another Linux distro, such as Xubuntu. There are plenty of options to choose from.\nHowever, if you really want to install Windows XP, AFAIK there is no way in software to change the BIOS. Here are my suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you know what button to press when your computer starts up (some common ones are F12, F7, and Del)\n\n*Check your BIOS settings again. You may have missed something if you actually have looked in there.\n\n*Like I said before, just don't try installing XP. I honestly don't think it's worth it.\n\n\nEDIT: I guess this is not what you wanted. I'm going to try again.\nHere are my suggestions if your computer won't let you install Windows at all:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn a GParted CD on one of your computers--whichever one works at the moment.\n\n*Boot to the GParted CD and create a new partition table on your disk. You probably want to create a Master Boot Record partition table, seeing as you originally had Windows 7. If your computer actually has UEFI (which is a possibility), use a GUID partition table instead.\n\n*If installing Windows still doesn't work, try booting into GParted again and creating an NTFS partition on your hard drive. \n\n*If all else fails, bring this up on Super User. There should be people there who know more about your problem. This is clearly not an Ubuntu related issue, except for the fact that you want to switch back to Windows from Ubuntu. This is as far as I will help you here.\n\n\nA: If you really want XP for some things, but want to retain ubuntu, you could install a virtual machine in ubuntu and run xp from there.  Either vmware or virtualbox would work.\n", "Q: Ubuntu's partition not recognized? PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU READ EVERYTHING: most people post answers that are literally out of context, which is frustrating!\nI am in big trouble right now. My Ubuntu partition is not recognized and therefore cannot be used. As a result, whenever my computer boots up, it shows a \"grub-rescue\" black screen, which is annoying.\nI am currently running a Debian live DVD. I will neither re-insall anything nor format the Ubuntu partition because I think this is a problem that can be resolved.\nWhat happened the moment before I get this GRUB-RESCUE screen? I was working on Ubuntu and decided to create a new partition for my data, labeled \"DONNEES\" (french of \"data\"). This computer literally froze... and after 30 minutes, I was very 'angry' and I forced the shutdown of the computer (since the mouse wasn't moving). Now, I can't access anything but every live CD and DVD I have created.

The touchscreen does work to some extent (I can click most things and drag selection boxes on the desktop) but it doesn't seem to want to let me do anything involving clicking and dragging besides that, like highlighting text or moving windows or scroll bars.

Reasons are obvious: save space and I don't like the idea of doing separate multiple installations of a program for multiple users.

I wanted to implement it using command line without installing any new packages.\nPlease help. Thanks in advance\n\nA: Connman(1) can be used to prioritize your connections to prefer wired networks and auto-connect to wireles when the wired connection is unavailable.  It is supported by Intel, so it can be hostile to non-intel networking hardware: I can't use Connman(1) since my wifi driver won't set flags Intel expects to enable the adapter.  I get \"no carrier\" error and no wifi connection.  However, it seems to connect quickly when I plug in the wired connection.\nYou need to configure /etc/connman/main.conf/main.conf\nwith something like:\n  BackgroundScanning = false\n  DefaultAutoConnectTechnologies = ethernet,wifi \n  PreferredTechnologies = ethernet,wifi\n  SingleConnectedTechnology = true\n\nto ensure only wifi or ethernet is connected.  Then, use an interactive connmanctl(1) session as indicated by the man page  to connect to wifi the first time or edit the settings  file for your interface found in /var/lib/connman (this seems easier to me, but restart required.)

I'm confused.\n\nA: Unfortunately Wubi currently does not work with the default windows 8.1 boot loader assuming that you installed ubuntu in the \"wubi\" configuration. There is no easy fix for this at the moment (A windows bootloader limitation) that does not have you modifying your system bootloader. \nAnother option you have to try out ubuntu is in a Live-CD environment, which is included on the default ubuntu installation cd. \nLive-CD is a boot option on the ubuntu default installation cd, that lets you run a full fledged ubuntu operating system using only the cd and RAM. When you quit out of the live cd any changes you made will not be saved (unless you modify your actual hardrive). This is great to try ubuntu as well as a recovery tool to use to fix broken or os-less computer systems. \nHowever, in order for the live-cd to work, you're computer needs to be set up to boot from the CD instead of the harddrive (often times CD is checked by default but skipped when nothing is in the media), often times \"fast boot\" and some security options may disable booting from CD. If your computer skips checking the cd for boot media it will default to your existing harddrive and simply boot windows again. \nIf you restart your computer again, look for a message that says Press F12 to select boot media or something very similar, you may need to look in your computer manual to see what the exact way to select the Boot order.  \n", "Q: Download Ubuntu packages I'm trying to download http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/v-mobile-broadband from firefox on Ubuntu 14.04, but it give me a prompt that says choose the application to open the downloaded file, so I don't know what I should choose and why when installing other things from other websites it start download normally?\n\nA: V Mobile Broadband is not in default Ubuntu Software Center repositary currenlty.

BTRFS is a nice filesystem, except when you are forced to hard reset the system twice in a row. In that case, all recently made changes to the files on the filesystem are broken in one way or another. Among theese there is always the Linux registry,  dconf. \nSo after the computer hard restart, you are left in a state of the broken dconf - all values are forced to the defaults, and you are banned from doing any modification to them. \nRemoving the whole /home/$USER folder and re-creating it from scratch fixes the problem. But that takes a huge amount of time and loses even more data. \nI wonder, if there is a better way to repair or reset the dconf. Preferably with the option to inspect the old values. \nI expect, that there is some backup of dconf settings, just like in Windows word.\n\nA: You can find your user dconf database in ~/.config/dconf, system level values are stored on /etc/dconf. The database are a combination of a fast-read binary file and text files inside a dir with the same name as the database but ended in .d:\nI mean default system level values are stored both in /etc/dconf/ibus (a binary file) and /etc/dconf/ibus.d (a directory filled with text files)\nYou should first check if the problem is in the user or system level files and then delete (or restore) the problematic files.\nYou should find a backup of your user file (not the system level one) in ~/.config/dconf/, it's named user.XXXXXX where X can be any letter.\nYou can read the dconf system administrator guide here for more info.\n\nA: After a little of poking around I've found two files under ~/.config/dconf: user with size 0 bytes, and user.H37S4 with a normal size of several kB. \nDeleting the user file, and renaming the user.H37S4 -> user not only healed the registry, but also restored the settings to their previous state.\nI've changed those files under virtual terminal while being logged out from the unity and the whole graphical desktop environment.\n", "Q: could not login to X-SERVER i have 3 user account in system with kde and xfce . in x-server i can not login with all created users. \nin terminal after restart x-server and kdm or xfce i do not get any error. login interminal not problem but i can not login with kde or xfce.\norxfce`.\n\nA: Try these solutions:\nLogin to tty (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and remove the .Xauthority file and also need to remove the .xsession-errors files.\nsudo rm .Xauthority\nsudo rm .xsession-errors*\n\nor also back it up:\nsudo mv ~/.Xauthority ~/.Xauthority.backup\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nCheck the home directory:\nls -l /home\n\nyou may have to give ownership back to your account using chown\nsudo chown -R username:group /home/username\n\nMore answers here\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 UEFI won't boot after upgrade from 13.10 Upgrading from Ubuntu 13.10 to Ubuntu 14.04 has resulted in a system that is not bootable.\nThe system consists of two disks: One with Windows 8 (/dev/sdaX) and one with Ubuntu 14.04 (/dev/sdbX). I was previously booting using an EFI partition /dev/sda2, but the Ubuntu upgrade installer has rendered this inoperative: it fails to a gparted fallback screen. /dev/sdb was originally a legacy MBR/BIOS-based system. I have attempted to create an EFI partition on /dev/sdb1, but I am not sure if I did it right. Boot-repair fails to fix either EFI partition.\nBoth Windows and Ubuntu are bootable with the assistance of super grub disk, but that is only the way I can get either system to boot.\nSecure boot is not enabled.\nBoot information is here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7622020/\nDo you have any recommendations for me? This looks like the bug given in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1289977 , but there is no clear resolution available.\n\nA: I recommend you try my rEFInd boot manager. (It looks like you may have tried it at some point in the past but I see no evidence that it's currently installed.) Use the CD-R or USB flash drive version from the rEFInd downloads page for testing. If that doesn't work, you'll have done no more harm and you can move on to some other approach; but if it does work to boot both Linux and Windows, you can install the Debian package (either single-shot using the package from the downloads page or by using the PPA referenced at the bottom of the downloads page).\n\nA: The rEFInd bootloader did the trick. My system's EFI firmware does not remember the symbolic \"refind\" name, however: it only remembers devices, and it will always try and boot the device default. To get around this, I had to install refind from the install.sh script with\n./install.sh --usedefault /dev/sdXX\n\nRead the install guide before using this option. If you use the wrong /dev entry, you could wipe out all your data.\nIt might be useful if the PPA version of refind had some dpkg-reconfigure style option to that extent.\n", "Q: Partitioning for ubuntu My PC has only one operating system installed: Windows 7 on single partition C:.\nIs it necessary to partition it before installing Ubuntu alongside with Windows 7 or can I simply install Ubuntu in the same partition?\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu inside your partition C:, but this is Ubuntu-specific mechanism (Wubi) and it is not normal operating system installation scenario, so I would not recommend it.\nHowever, it is quite easy to shrink your C: partition and create partitions for Ubuntu during Ubuntu installation. Boot your PC with Ubuntu installation disk, and when asked by installer about partitions, choose \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows\" or something like that.

Simple changes mean that bash script changes and configuration file updates and possibly other software updates including new software installations that can be installed via apt-get install. Several questions that have come up to my mind are, \n\n\n*\n\n*Can PPA be used to send script updates?\n\n*Can I configure client machines to get updates only from this PPA and install them automatically just like unattended-Upgrades? (Of course I know this option is possible but a good set of tools to achieve this is expected).\n\n\nI know this is a broad question, but an answer with few pointers is highly appreciated.\n\nA: I wished to do the same thing, but I chose using a private repository made using reprepro over PPAs. All my clients are on the same LAN, so it's simpler for me.\nI think this is pretty workable irrespective of whether you use PPAs or a private repository.\n\n\n*\n\n*Modifying existing configuration files is best handled by using dpkg diversions, IMO. config-package-dev is a blessing for this. The Debian Wiki is a good starting point for information on this.\n\n*Adding script files or your own software isn't that difficult by packaging them. There are plenty of packaging guides. Again, the Debian wiki is a great starting point. It's simpler to make binary packages than the intro, which will be the case with scripts and configuration files.\n\n*Adding new software from other repositories can be done by making them dependencies of your packages. Specify an exact version or use apt pinning.\n\n*Unattended upgrades for custom repositories is already handled: How to enable silent automatic updates for any repository? I don't know of any way a server can push updates to a client. You might want to consider puppet (via kicking) or its ilk. Or you might write a script on the server which uses SSH to run updates on the client. Or have a script which checks for updates when the network comes up.\n\n*Above all, ensure that your package maintenance scripts (preinst, postinst, prerm, postrm) are idempotent and that package removal undoes all changes. These scripts can do a lot of things, but do not do anything affects apt or dkpg in them. Minimise the work done in these scripts.\n\n\nIn my case, I use a package to configure LDAP and NTP, add a custom global vimrc enabling common options, make various configuration changes (like enabling sudo for a group, banning shutdown), adding an unprivileged local user/group, etc. Another package adds our self-generated CA certificate and repository signing key and marks them trusted in the postinst script, and adds an entry in sources.list.d for our repository.\nI haven't yet converted all the systems to this process, so I can't comment yet about its effectiveness.\n", "Q: Error libx264 not found I follow this installation guide.

They produce logs which are logged out to /var/log/upstart/SERVICE_NAME.log \nThen daily, the log files are rotated using the logrotation script which comes with 12.04 LTS:\n/var/log/upstart/*.log {\n        daily\n        missingok\n        rotate 7\n        compress\n        notifempty\n        nocreate\n}\n\nThe problem is that while logrotate moves the files, it doesn't appear to signal to upstart to close and reopen the files, leaving the upstart process writing to a delete PID.\ninit          1       root    8w      REG              202,1        64       2431 /var/log/upstart/dbus.log.1 (deleted)\ninit          1       root   13w      REG              202,1        95       2507 /var/log/upstart/acpid.log.1 (deleted)\ninit          1       root   14w      REG              202,1       127      17377 /var/log/upstart/whoopsie.log.1 (deleted)\ninit          1       root   36w      REG              202,1       122       6747 /var/log/upstart/SERVICE_NAME.log.1 (deleted)\ninit          1       root   37w      REG              202,1        30       6762 \n\nObviously I could redirect the output from my own services to other log files, but the problem would still be there for the system processes. Also I would rather not have to build more infrastructure than what I need.\n\nA: I believe you have 3 options.\n\n\n*\n\n*You modify the existing configuration by adding \"copytruncate\"\n/var/log/upstart/*.log \n{\n    copytruncate\n    daily\n    missingok\n    rotate 7\n    compress\n    notifempty\n    nocreate\n}\n\n*If you can't or (are not allowed) to change the existing logrotate config because of other log files that don't suffer and the existing config works for them, then move your \"SERVICE_NAME.log\" files to a new folder under /var/log if your wish, create a new config with the \"copytruncate\" and add it to the cron.daily.\n\n*a) If you're not allowed to change the host os logrotate config or add to the host OS's cron.daily, then your third option is to change the scripts or programs to either check that the file exists before writing out to the file.\nb) Another way is a bit of point 2 above which is to move your logfiles somewhere else and within you script or program, execute the logrotate command specific for that program's logfile.\nPoint 3b above is more tricky but more elegant and it is what I use most of the time as it means the program is self-sufficient and self-managed and doesn't need the OS's jobs to babysit it.\nTo find out how to manually run logrotate and add it to your program or script just type:\nman logrotate\n\nor\nlogrotate --help\n\nIf you are using Python for your programs you can check out how this program uses it to self-manage its log files.\nhttp://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ferncasado/keep.awake/trunk/files/head:/v4/\n\nA: Turns out, this is a known problem and the ticket remains open as I type this.\nThe right thing to do is, probably, to just remove the /etc/logrotate.d/upstart altogether and rotate the files of the individual services individually. Because the directory (/var/log/upstart/) contains only the stdout/stderr of the various services -- and no service meant to run as a daemon should be outputting to those two channels at all. Except, maybe, at the very startup.\nOn the systems I'm managing, three services are run by upstart: php5.6-fpm, php7.1-fpm, and acpid. None of the three logs are active but sometimes the fpm is restarted due to its main log-file (/var/log/php5.6-fpm.log) being rotated -- and it causes this noise, because it outputs some inanity at startup.\nIf you insist on rotating these files anyway, you can rely on the fact, that their names match the names of the services and use the following postrotate script:\n    postrotate\n            service=${1##*/}\n            service=${service%.log*}\n            service $service restart > /dev/null\n    endscript\n\nFor the above to work, be sure to not use the sharedscripts verb in there -- my scriptlet relies on the fact, the actual path to the file will be passed to it as the first argument ($1).\n(The redirection into /dev/null is useful, because service-command is noisy -- and you don't want such noise e-mailed to you by cron. Notice, that I'm not redirecting stderr there, only stdout -- if there is a problem, you'll still get your e-mail about it.)\n", "Q: What is the difference between sudo apt-get install and sudo apt install I installed many packages from sudo apt-get install but when I typed  sudo apt --help it gave a direct option of doing installation by sudo apt install [package name]... So, what is the difference between the two ? are there any issues if I don't use 'get' along with 'apt'.\n\nA: Not much. apt is a new command that supposed to merge several functions from apt-get and apt-cache into one command. It's still a little rough around the edges but here's the command listing from --help:\nBasic commands: \n list - list packages based on package names\n search - search in package descriptions\n show - show package details\n\n update - update list of available packages\n\n install - install packages\n remove  - remove packages\n\n upgrade - upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages\n full-upgrade - upgrade the system by removing/installing/upgrading packages\n\n edit-sources - edit the source information file\n\nThe equivalent functions are designed to work in similar ways but it's not a proxy command (it's not calling the old ones - it's a new interface directly onto the Apt libraries) so there may be some edge-case changes.\nThere are also some obvious omissions (download, policy, etc) that power-users will miss and there are a whole raft of undocumented commands (purge still works but I can't find anything on it).\n16.04 Update: A lot of the omissions have now been included but aren't yet documented, nor do they have Bash-completions. It's a shame it's taking this long to implement functionality that already exists in the codebase but oh well. My advice is that if you're used to an apt-{get,cache} command, try it on apt. It might work.\n\nThere's also a DIFFERENCES TO APT-GET(8) section in the man apt page that's interesting:\n   The apt command is meant to be pleasant for end users and does\n   not need to be backward compatible like apt-get(8). Therefore\n   some options are different:\n\n   ·   The option DPkgPM::Progress-Fancy is enabled.\n\n   ·   The option APT::Color is enabled.\n\n   ·   A new list command is available similar to dpkg --list.\n\n   ·   The option upgrade has --with-new-pkgs enabled by default.\n\n\nAnd if you want Bash-completions, I've had an attempt as writing a completions file for it already. These are included with later Ubuntu installs.\n", "Q: There are some remaning files after performing autoremove I have installed many programs and noticed that if suppose installation is of 900kb and after removing that installed package it gives 577kb removed where does the 377kb has gone?? if it is in system how to remove the additional data files??\n\nA: To remove all the files, even the configuration files, you can use the purge option :\nsudo apt-get purge <package name>\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove\n\nBut also take into account that when you install ProgramA which is dependent of ProgramB and ProgramC, if you remove ProgramA and then run afterward apt-get autoremove, it may not remove ProgramB and / or ProgramC.\nI had the case with eclipse for which there is a lot of dependent programs to be installed, one of them beeing ant. Because on its own ant can be used alone, even after apt-get purge eclipse and apt-get --purge autoremove, ant was not removed. I had to remove it manually.\nMaybe this is what explain the difference you see in size.\nOf cours, it would be better to analyse this with a complete output of your session.\nRemark:, I've tried with fslint as you told in your comment, but the size given in the output of the installation match the one of the remove.\n", "Q: Permission denied error while creating file by using script file I have created a script file called black_list.sh.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndefault_card=`head -1 /proc/asound/modules`\necho $default_card\n\nif [ ! -e /etc/modprobe.d/sound.blacklist.conf ] && [[ \"$default_card\" =~ \"snd_hda_intel\" ]]; then\n        echo \"blacklist snd_hda_intel\" > /etc/modprobe.d/sound.blacklist.conf ---> not working            \nelse\n        echo \"Default sound card(snd_hda_intel) is already added in black list\";\nfi\n\nfrom this script file I am creating sound.blacklist.conf file in /etc/modprobe.d but I got /etc/modprobe.d/sound.blacklist.conf: Permission denied error.\nSo tried \necho itsme | sudo -S echo \"blacklist snd_hda_intel\" > /etc/modprobe.d/sound.blacklist.conf\nbut it also not worked so how can create a file in /etc/modprobe.d directory from my script file.\n\nA: I'd personally use tee which you can run as root to append to files:\necho \"blacklist snd_hda_intel\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/sound.blacklist.conf\n\nBut that might not be expected half-way through a script. If you're doing things that require root privileges, it might —and I'm not saying this for certain— make more sense to only let root run the script by sticking this near the top of the script:\nif [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then\n  echo \"Only root can run this.

I have installed/un-installed many packages(as trial) in My System as a result they leave a lot of junk and temporary files...Is there any package or software that can scan for removable junk and remove it out of my system??\n\nA: I'd recommend using the \nfind -name [filename]\nThis does not delete the files but the find command will help find the directory tree(s) of the files you are looking for. \n\nA: You can always do a find / |xargs ls -l --time=atime 2>/dev/null >/tmp/access.times. With that, you have a file /tmp/access.times which contains every file on your system with the last access time.\nYou can sift through it to find files that are barely accessed and see what can be removed. I'd still be careful before removing things that you actually need, so don't script and automate this process or you'll get problems! \n\nA: If you remove packages using apt-get purge, then system-wide configurations and stuff like that will be deleted. However, users configuration files will not. This situation has been improved in later years, because of XDG specs. For instance, Liferea will store its cache in ~/.cache/liferea/, its databases in ~/.local/share/liferea/ and its configuration in ~/.config/liferea/. That's how its supposed to be done now, making it much easier to figure out which files are no longer used. However, some apps don't follow this scheme yet. \nI don't know of any scanner that does this automatically and in many cases, it wouldn't even make sense, because you can share your home between many different computers, having different applications installed – meaning the fact that you don't have a certain app installed right now, doesn't mean you don't use it on other computers. \nPerhaps you'd like to use find to see which files haven't been used in a certain amount of time. Of course, an app could be created that used these different things to provide a map of things you might want to clean up.

that's probably your answer. You could probably work out what it is with strings a.out | less and seeing what strings it contains; that tends to be a bit easier than hexing.\n\nIf you're sure it's not something of your own creation, check the creation date (stat a.out) and check your browsers' download histories. That might suggest where you've downloaded it from.\nFailing that, check your normal browsing history. Might explain what you were up to (and if you came into contact with anything likely to infect you).\n\nA: Maybe you downloaded that file from sourceforge as an installer? If it is a virus, it is good to check... Press Ctrl-Alt-T and a terminal will open. Type\nfile ~/Downloads/a.out\n\nIf it does not say anything bad, use the readelf command and the elfedit command to investigate it. Post the output here.\nJP\n\nA: If you run the command ld -lrt, ld creates a file \"a.out\" with the same hash. \nYou probably created this file with a wrongly typed ls -lrt command.\n\nA: It happened to me as well (I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and the file appeared in my home folder). When I backtracked and looked at what commands I've used in terminal, I found that I was playing around with the 'as' command while trying to wrap my head around assembly language. There's a small chance users type 'as' instead of 'ls' and this happens (maybe?).\nJust a thought.\n", "Q: Previous frame seems to flicker in any type of window Recently my 14.04 setup has run into some strange problem. Basically almost all windows  (often) start flickering the \"previous frame\" (or that is what it feels like). There doesn't seem to be any logic when it starts to flicker. It sometimes calms down after you leave it be for a moment. Sometimes pressing enter several times in the terminal window helps. \nIt affects terminal windows, GTK windows and PDF readers. Browsers seem unaffected by this, though. Some other apps are also unaffected, ie. Spotify.\nI have uploaded a video of this from a terminal window, but basically the same thing happens with other type of windows as well. The video can be seen here:\nLink to youtube video showing the symptoms\nIt's a fairly recent fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04, and I have NVidia GTX 560 video card. I have updated to newest drivers 337.25.\nAny ideas what might be causing this?\n\nA: Ok, found a workaround for the problem.\nIn compiz settings manager, go to workarounds, and there select the checkbox for Force full screen redraws (buffer swap) on repaint, and it disappeared for me:\n\nFor command line (Ubuntu 14.04):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n*ccsm\n\n*filter on workarounds, enable workaround plugin (enable prompted dependencies)\n\n*click on workaround plugin, check \"Force full screen ...\" option\n\n*close\n\n", "Q: Canon MP237 can print but CANNOT scan I have this Cannon MP237 (3-in-1) printer and I can print properly using the software on Ubuntu 14.04.  However, I cannot scan with it.  I even tried GIMP Image Editor but I still cannot do any scanning.  The copy function of the printer works well so I'm sure it's a software issue.  Please advise, thanks.\n\nA: I do not own/use this printer, but from a quick search on the internet, I found that Canon provides a scanner driver named \"MP230 series ScanGear MP Ver. 2.00 for Linux (debian Packagearchive)\" for this printer on its website. Also, I found a fairly helpful installation article about this same printer - http://www.distroubuntu.com/2013/01/install-printer-canon-pixma-mp-237-di.html (albeit in a different language - You can use Google Translate to view this in your preferred language).\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Can't use two network interfaces at the same time I have a problem.

That's terrible, can anyone tell me how to close this issue?\n/etc/network/interfaces:\nauto lo eth0 eth1\n\niface lo inet loopback\n\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 172.16.1.100\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nbroadcast 172.16.1.255\ngateway 172.16.1.254\n\nsudo route outputs:\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth1\n192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     1      0        0 eth1\n\nUPD:\nifconfig outputs:\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 90:e6:ba:46:1d:50  \n          inet6 addr: fe80::92e6:baff:fe46:1d50/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:1110 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:184287 (184.2 KB)\n\neth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:04:75:98:5f:da  \n          inet addr:192.168.0.101  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::204:75ff:fe98:5fda/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:14498 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:2 frame:0\n          TX packets:13096 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:9710708 (9.7 MB)  TX bytes:1840400 (1.8 MB)\n          Interrupt:18 Base address:0x4c00 \n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:4398 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:4398 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:527890 (527.8 KB)  TX bytes:527890 (527.8 KB)\n\n\nA: Configuring the output of ifconfig and the comments given to my first answer, I think that the problem is related to way you configure your NIC's in /etc/network/interfaces.\nAs you don't have any specific configuration for eth1 in /etc/network/interfaces, I suppose that your modem is giving to your server the IP info via DHCP. As per the route ouput, you get your default gateway pointing to the modem so to Internet. \nBut on your /etc/network/interfaces file for the eth0 you have also a default gateway configured (statement gateway 172.16.1.254).\nYou cannot have two default gateway on a system. The assignment of the default gateway on eth1 disable the static configuration of eth0, reason why there is no IP for eth0 in the ifconfig output and why Internet works and the internal network no more.\nYou will have to remove the line gateway 172.16.1.254 and try again.\nBy doing so, of course, if you have more than one subnet on the internal LAN you won't be able to reach them anymore.\nUnless you configure static route towards all of these subnets on your server :\n\nsudo route add -net A.B.C.D gw 172.16.1.254\n\nyou can add the route command in a script saved under /etc/network/if-up.d to be run each time an interface goes up.\n\nA: From what I understand of your post, you are connecting to Internet via eth1 and to your internal network via eth0. And your server is then playing the role of DHCP server and default gateway for your PC's to go the Internet.\nFirst, on the PC, check that they've received correctly all DHCP settings, including the gateway. From your question, I assume it should be 172.16.1.100\nSecondly, be sure that your eth1 is well connected to the Internet and well configured; this is obviously depending of your ISP.\nFinally, the most important operation, you will have to enable IP forwarding between your two interfaces on the server. Without this, packet won't be routed between your PC's and the Internet :\nManual set-up :\n\nsudo echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nTo have the IP forward flag automatically setup at boot time uncomment the line #net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 in /etc/sysctl.conf\nYou will have also to ensure that there are no IPtables firewall rules that block the traffic. Do :\n\niptables -L -n\n\nto get a list of rules if any.\nI would first try this setup with all firewall rules disabled :\n\niptables -F\n\n\nA: I had similar issue, but my interfaces file was empty like this:\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nI managed to fix the issue by moving/removing the Wired connection file found:\n/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Wired connection 1\nAfter reboot, was able to connect to both networks.\n", "Q: Want to connect Sony Z2 (Android phone) to Ubuntu 12.04 I have Ubuntu 12.04 and I try to connect it with Sony Xperia Z2 (which has Android 4.4) via USB.\nI have set Mass Storage Mode(MSC) setting but nothing happens when I connect cell phone to the laptop.\n\nA: The internal \"sdcard\" memory of this phone will only be exposed to Ubuntu after we had allowed USB debug mode.

I'm just talking about the standard KDE desktop. After a while (many days) of running the task bar stops working properly. This is due to some sort of undiagnosed bug but that's really not my boggle at the moment. It's fixed as soon as I log out and in again.\nI have to close everything and ongoing processes like virtual machines have to shut down. It's a big pain. It typically means I put up with a bit of flickering for many days.\nIs there a way to just reload the desktop without bombing all the running applications?\n\nA: The window manager kwin is responsible for moving around windows, etc. That can be restarted by this:\nkstart kwin --replace\n\nThe kstart prefix is just to not run it as a subprocess in the current terminal, such that you can close the terminal afterwards.\nplasmashell is responsible for the background and other shell things.\nRestarting that should work like this:\nkillall plasmashell\nkstart plasmashell\n\nNote that this did not bring back the menu for me.\nAlso, interestingly, this again breaks kwin for me, i.e. I'm not able to move windows around anymore. On console, I get sth like QXcbConnection: XCB error: 3 (BadWindow), sequence: ..., resource id: ..., major code: 15 (QueryTree), minor code: 0.\n\nA: In KDE5 use \"kstart plasmashell\" to restart the plasmashell as a service instead of plasmashell &. If you use it that way it 's run as an independed service not connected to the current terminal session (meaning you can close the terminal without the process getting terminated). TLDR:\nKDE5 (in Terminal):\nkillall plasmashell\nkstart plasmashell\n\n\nA: Well I didn't expect this to work (and it's not exactly what the question asks for) but pressing Alt+F2 and running:\nkwin --replace\n\nThis reloads KDE's compositor and that seems to fix the flickering. I guess it's a factor into my particular issue.\n\nA: In KDE 4, you can do:\nkillall plasma-desktop #to stop it\nkstart plasma-desktop #to restart it\n\nIn KDE 5 use:\nkillall plasmashell #to stop it\nkstart plasmashell #to restart it\n\nIn KDE > 5.10 use:\nkquitapp5 plasmashell\nkstart5 plasmashell\n\nSometimes plasmashell is not responding so kquitapp5 fails after a timeout and you have to get back to killall. So in a nutshell, I would do :\n# For KDE 4\nkillall plasma-desktop && kstart plasma-desktop\n\n# For KDE 5 < 5.10\nkillall plasmashell && kstart plasma-desktop\n\n# For KDE > 5.10\nkquitapp5 plasmashell || killall plasmashell && kstart5 plasmashell\n\nRemarks :\n\n*\n\n*If you are not sure which KDE version your run, kinfocenter --version will tell you.\n\n*you can skip the kquitapp5 plasmashell || part if you don't want to be stuck in the timeout when plasmashell is not responding.\n\n\nA: I looked this up because I had an issue where I couldn't open any KDE settings menus, but I didn't really want to reboot or log out. I found that the best way to do it (in KDE 5 at least) is by using krunner (Alt+F2) to killall plasmashell then immediately afterwards, plasmashell. I tried doing it in a Konsole window, using killall plasmashell and then plasmashell & and this worked, but as soon as I closed the Konsole window, plasma would close as well. Even though you seemed to resolve your issue, I figured I would post it for people coming along in the future needing to restart plasma.\nIn KDE 4, just replace plasmashell with plasma-desktop\n\nA: I find I'm always having trouble with ksycoca5, and this seems to be the reason plasmashell gets in a strop, and also stops plasmashell restarting.  To solve this I did:\n$ mv ~/.cache/ksycoca5* /tmp\n$ killall plasmashell buildksycoca5; kstart plasmashell\n\n\nA: OK .. I am running OpenSuse Leap 15.1 running KDE5 Plasma.  Periodically, my X environment is corrupted (after about 24 hours of leaving my machine running) and I get\n\"KLauncher could not be reached via D-Bus. Error when calling start_service_by_desktop_path: Not connected to D-Bus server\"\nThe result of this is that while my desktop still functions I can't launch any applications which use KLauncher -- very annoying.  (NOTE: also my xwindows vncserver appears to launch 99 instances of display windows I could attach to -- which isnt right -- I havent corrected this yet but I will).  However, I FOUND the answer to the above issue to restart KDE 5 Plasma in my environment without a reboot:\n1) killall plasmashell\n2) kstart5 plasmashell kwin\nThis restarts everything as if the system is freshly booted.  Hope this helps\nThanks\n\nA: Some times ago, the plasma desktop started to have issues when I have attached a USB hub with USB-C and a second monitor. The window panel does not show any icons.\nWhen I restart plasma by\nplasmashell --replace &\n\nEverything works fine again. My current plasma version is 5.26.4.\n\nA: In KDE4 I find the memory usage ramps up to around a gigglebite pretty rapidly because opening programs progressively uses more RAM, but closing them does not release it.  This is in Mint 17.3 with KDE but seems to affect pretty well ALL KDE plasma 4 systems.\nI got sick of logging in and out, or using ALT + F2 to kill and restart plasma.  So now I just have a script (set as executable) sitting on the panel..\n\n   \n#!/bin/bash \nkillall plasma-desktop \nplasma-desktop & \n   \n\nClick on the icon and plasma does a close and restart over about 15 seconds or so.  I can still use open programs on whichever virtual desktop I am currently using while plasma is restarting.\n\nA: I also tried something like:\nkillall plasmashell; kstart plasmashell\n\nOr even this:\nkillall plasmashell; kwin --replace && kstart plasmashell\n\nBut, for, unknown reasons, it didn't work.\nPlasma desktop restarting began to work after I added sleeps among the commands:\nkillall plasmashell ; sleep 3 ; kwin --replace ; sleep 5 ; kstart plasmashell\n\nFinally, I've noticed that, when type 'kwin|plasma' in KSysGuard filter field, it reports that after killing plasmashell, such *.so files are still present: desktop.so, file.so. We must kill them too. Otherwise, we'll have copies of that files after each restart.\nSo, the final plasma desktop restarting commands are:\nkillall plasmashell desktop.so file.so ; sleep 5 ; kwin --replace ; sleep 5 ; kstart plasmashell\n\n", "Q: AMD Drivers problem: can't display the resolution So, I'm kind of new to Ubuntu and Linux in general, I installed the latest (Ubuntu 14.04) and everything went fine, except  for the resolution so I thought that it was a driver problem because I have a AMD HD 7750 and maybe it required additional proprietary drivers so I installed AMD Catalyst (Latest version), and then rebooted.\nAnd now my monitor says Can't Display and I can't see the GUI.\nI can go to terminal (Pressing Ctrl + Alt + F1, F2, F3 etc) but Not the UI.\n\nA: There's a good link for getting past this problem on this question:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?.\nWhat you need to do, is at the Grub boot screen, choose Ubuntu boot options, and start the recovery mode.

That is why your monitor says Can't Display. Therefore all you gotta do is just change your resolution!\nFor this:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you are in that Can't Display screen check if you can hear the login sound.

Now try opening a terminal(with Ctrl+Alt+t).\nThen type the following command:\nxrandr -s 1024x768\n\nI am assuming 1024x768 is a supported resolution in your monitor. If its not supported then type some other supported resolution. This should show your desktop.\nIf this doesn't work then I suppose you can just delete your proprietary driver. Since you say that your purpose for installing the driver is just to get your maximum screen resolution detected you can just delete it and get your maximum screen resolution detected by following the steps in the answers whose links are as follows(The first link is better):\n\n\n*\n\n*How to make my maximum screen resolution to be detected by Ubuntu?\n\n*How can I get my monitor's maximum resolution without the proprietary AMD graphic driver installed?\n", "Q: Kubuntu 14.04 freezing on MacBook Pro 6,2, not booting ldm I've reinstalled Kubuntu 14.04 multiple times to fix this, but it has not fixed this problem.

You may incur into some problems, even with the most recent distro, if your hardware is either brand new or its configuration very unusual. Barring that and assuming you are a newby to this world, your few next basic steps are:\n1) get hold of the ISO image, \"someone\" used to do the install. Boot your machine from it (i.e. use it as a live OS)\n2) To find out exactly what partitions were installed, run 'Gparted' form the live OS (it will allow you to do that if your ISO is for the Ubuntu distro). If you cannot find Gparted, I would recommend getting an ISO for a trusted and stable Linux version e.g. Ubuntu, Mint, CentOS, etc.) that includes Gparted and make a live CD from it by burning i and almost certainly for other flavors.) to  and report here in the form:\n/dev/-d--    [so many kB]   [label or mount point]  [file system format]\n(I assume you are familiar with the partition scheme and naming for different type of volume; if not read about that, before you continue)\nIn doing so you will use Gparted to VISUALIZE only, not to re-partition or reformat anything, because that would probably wipe your win config clean. You don't want that.\n3) All of the above is to determine whether you have a chance of recovering from what seems to be a failed install. If you see your partitions nice and clean, then we 'll look at your MBR and your GRUB and if they are corrupt, how to fix them. \nNOTE: this is left to the appreciation of the moderators, but askubuntu.com may not be the best place for this.

I am thinking that\n  it is already installed but not sure how to access it, but that is\n  another question for later\n\nNo it does not come with Ubuntu by default. Some LAMP packages such as XAMPP come with MySQL. \n\nA: To actually install mysql, you would also need to type in:\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nAs mentioned by Kenpachi, mysql-server does not come installed with Ubuntu upon its installation. I figured I would relay this in there if you are not aware on how to get mysql server on there.\n\nA: I would first start by reading a little bit about databases before you actually start working with them, or at least have a book next to you as a reference. There are several places on the internet where you can download free ebooks about MySQL to get up to speed :)\nGenerally speaking, mysql(-server) is an environment that can hold different databases. By default, it only has a little bit of data in a few databases that are required to work correctly and besides the users that are necessary for access rights, you're rarely going to access the existing databases. You can create your own database for example by\n$mysql -u root -p    // to log in your database environment as 'root'\nmysql> CREATE DATABASE people;\nmysql> USE people;\nmysql> CREATE TABLE names (\n       `    id int(4) unsigned not null primary key,\n       `    name varchar(32) not null\n       `    );\n\nWith that, you have a new empty database with 1 table that stores names.\nEvery database can have multiple tables, and ever table can have multiple columns and every column can have multiple values, links, binaries, etc.\nTo see what you are doing when you're learning, I advise you to install phpmyadmin, which is a web-based front-end for your database. You can easily create databases and see what is going on. It will also give you the queries (mysql strings) that are used for the operations you perform. After installation, just browse to http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin and it'll be a lot easier for you to see what you're doing. You'll also be able to create databases without having to know everything about MySQL.\nLAMP is an abreviation for (L)inux(A)pache(M)ySQL(P)HP, which are 4 different environments that are frequently used together to create dynamic websites. This is a bit of a time of change, as many web hosters are currently switching to Nginx instead of Apache, and MariaDB instead of MySQL. Only in later stages of development, you will start to see any differences between them. They're all there with the same purpose. But if you already have MySQL installed on Linux, you already have half of the LAMP stack installed.\nYou can always install the rest manually with apt.\n", "Q: How do I install Dell 2150cdn printer Love Ubuntu but cannot get printer to work.

The only thing that has been keeping me from the full switch to linux is PS. I have tried many alternatives, including GIMP, but I feel the barrier to entry is too high for one reason and one reason only, the keyboard shortcuts. Over the years I have become very adept and quick in the use of PS because of keyboard shortcuts and muscle memory. I realize that many shortcuts can be customized, but many actions are just too different from PS. So my question is what programs are out there that are the closest to PS in keyboard shortcuts and interface. I don't care if I have to do a bunch of customization to get it as close as possible, but I just can't take too much time to learn a completely new workflow.

The Gimp’s menu structure and naming conventions are a constant source of frustration for users accustomed to Photoshop. \n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMPshop\n\nAn upstream source site housing the original files for this mirror is no longer available.\nGIMPshop is a modification of the free/open source GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), intended to replicate the feel of Adobe Photoshop. Its primary purpose is to make users of Photoshop feel comfortable using GIMP. It shares all GIMP's advantages, including the long feature list and customisability, while addressing some common criticisms regarding the program's interface: GIMPshop modifies the menu structure to closely match Photoshop's, adjusts the program's terminology to match Adobe's, and, in the Windows version, uses a plugin called 'Deweirdifier' to combine the application's numerous windows in a similar manner to the MDI system used by most Windows graphics packages. While GIMPshop does not support Photoshop plugins, all GIMP's own plugins, filters, brushes, etc. remain available\n\nSource: https://sourceforge.net/projects/gimpshop.mirror/\n\nA: If the nice folk at Microsoft are any guide, you will be in trouble down the line anyway.  When they moved from Office 2010 to Office 2013, all the keyboard shortcuts that I had spent years training my fingers to type changed.

Also, try updating your BIOS if you can flash it. I bet your computer can.

The new unallocated drive portion is 292.97 GB. \nAfter shrinking C:/, I restarted Windows a couple of times to make sure everything was working fine (it is). I then attempted to install with the Ubuntu live USB. However, the Ubuntu installer doesn't see that Windows 8.1 is already installed. I don't understand, and don't want to mess with Ubuntu partitioning when I don't know where the partitions will be created.

So, without further ado, here's the script I wrote:\nODT finder\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# NAME:           ODT finder\n# AUTHOR:         (c) 2014 Glutanimate (https://github.com/Glutanimate)\n# LICENSE:        GNU GPLv3 (http://www.gnu.de/documents/gpl-3.0.en.html)\n# DEPENDENCIES    yad libreoffice unoconv\n\n\n# Dialogs\n\nTitle=\"ODT finder\"\nTxtEntry=\"Please enter the <b>directory</b> you would like to search through \\\nand the <b>search term.</b>\"\nErrNoArgs=\"ERROR: Please make sure to supply both a search path and search term\"\nErrNoReslt=\"No results found.\"\n\n# Variables\n\ndeclare -A Results\n\n# Functions\n\ndialog_options(){\n    SearchOptions=\"$(yad --form --title=\"$Title\" --text=\"$TxtEntry\" \\\n    --width=400 --height=200 --center \\\n    --field=\"Directory\":DIR \\\n    --field=\"Search term\" )\"\n\n    RET=\"$?\"\n\n    if [[ \"$RET\" != \"0\" ]]; then\n      echo \"Aborting\"\n      exit 1\n    fi   \n    \n    SearchPath=\"$(echo \"$SearchOptions\" | cut -d '|' -f1)\"\n    SearchTerm=\"$(echo \"$SearchOptions\" | cut -d '|' -f2)\"\n    \n    echo \"Path: $SearchPath\"\n    echo \"Query: $SearchTerm\"\n    \n    if [[ -z \"$SearchPath\" || -z \"$SearchTerm\" ]]; then\n      dialog_error \"$ErrNoArgs\"\n      dialog_options\n    fi\n}\n\n\nodt_search(){\n    while IFS= read -r -d '' File; do\n        Match=\"$(unoconv --format txt --stdout \"$File\" 2> /dev/null  | grep -m \"1\" -i \"$SearchTerm\")\"\n        if [[ -n \"$Match\" ]]\n          then\n              echo \"Match found for $File:\"\n              echo \"$Match\"\n              Results[\"$File\"]=\"$Match\"\n          else\n              echo \"No Result found in $File\"\n        fi\n    done < <(find \"$SearchPath\" -type f -name '*.odt' -print0)\n    echo \"1\" > \"$SearchState\"\n}\n\ndialog_error(){\n    yad --title=\"$Title\" \\\n      --center --width=\"400\" --height=\"100\" \\\n      --image=dialog-error \\\n      --window-icon=dialog-error \\\n      --class=\"$WMCLASS\" \\\n      --text=\"$1\" \\\n      --button=\"OK\":0 2> /dev/null\n}\n\n\n\ndialog_progress(){\n    sleep 0.5\n    while true; do\n      if [[ \"$(cat \"$SearchState\")\" = \"1\" ]]; then\n        break\n      else\n        echo \"#Searching...\"\n        sleep 0.5\n      fi\n    done | \\\n    yad --progress --pulsate --auto-close \\\n    --width=350 --height=100 \\\n    --title=\"$Title\" \\\n    --text=\"Searching for '<b>$SearchTerm</b>' in '<b>$SearchPath</b>' ...\" \\\n    --button='_Cancel!gtk-cancel!':1 \\\n    2> /dev/null\n    PROG_RET=\"$?\"\n    if [[ \"$PROG_RET\" != \"0\" ]]\n      then\n          kill -s TERM \"$TOP_PID\"\n    fi\n}\n\ndialog_results(){\n    TxtMain=\"Search results for '<b>$SearchTerm</b>' in '<b>$SearchPath</b>'\"\n\n    if [[ -z \"${Results[@]}\" ]]; then\n      dialog_error \"$ErrNoReslt\"\n      exit 1\n    fi\n\n    for File in \"${!Results[@]}\"; do\n      echo \"$File\"\n      echo \"Ubuntu Mono 12\"\n      echo \"\\\"[...]${Results[$File]}[...]\\\"\"\n    done | \\\n    yad --list --listen --print-column=1 \\\n    --expand−column=0 \\\n    --title=\"$Title\" \\\n    --text=\"$TxtMain\" \\\n    --ellipsize=NONE \\\n    --width=800 --height=600 --center \\\n    --dclick-action=\"bash -c \\\"open_result %s\\\" &\" \\\n    --column=\"File\":TEXT --column=@font@ --column=\"Result\":TEXT\n}\n\nopen_result(){\n    xdg-open \"$1\"\n}\n\n# Prep\n\nTOP_PID=\"$$\"\n\nSearchState=\"$(mktemp -u --tmpdir \"${0##*/}.XXXXX\")\"\necho \"0\" > \"$SearchState\"\n\nexport -f open_result\n\n# Cleanup\n\ntrap \"echo \"1\" > \"$SearchState\"; sleep 1; [[ -f \"$SearchState\" ]] && rm -r \"$SearchState\"; exit\" EXIT\n\n# Main\n\ndialog_options\ndialog_progress&\nodt_search\ndialog_results\n\nDependencies\nODT finder uses unoconv to convert LO documents to plain text. The GUI is based on yad, a powerful Zenity fork. Yad isn't available in the official repositories, yet, but you can install it from a webupd8 PPA.\nThe following commands should take care of all dependencies:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/y-ppa-manager\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unoconv yad\n\nInstallation\nCopy and paste the contents of the code box above into a new text file, name it whatever you want and make it executable. You can integrate the script with your system in various ways, e.g. by assigning a launcher or using it as a Nautilus script.\nUsage\nFirst time launching the script you will be greeted with an entry dialog for the folder you want to search through and the search term:\n\nClick on 'OK' to start the query. This might take a while:\n\nWhen the result window pops up you can double-click on any of the entries to open it in your default viewer (LibreOffice, generally). You can do this for more than one file:\n\nThe script will exit after hitting OK, Cancel, or closing the window.\nThere are some basic checks to guide the user and warn them if something went wrong:\n\n\nHopefully this fits the bill ☺.\n", "Q: Resolution problems Ubuntu 14.04 I have Ubuntu 14.04 and everything is working fine exept for the resolution, my monitor supports 1440x900 but in the options only allows 800x640 and 1024x768, I tryed the xorg.conf solution and it doesn't work\nEDIT: Problem solved!

Also, when I try to shutdown it gets stuck on the Ubuntu logo.\n\nA: I had the same issue when Ubuntu 14 just came out but after updating these problems disappeared.\nYou have to look in the details of the popup to see which program is causing the error. This is very important to know what is going on. The popups may come from different packages.

I've got a laptop with Ubuntu 12.04 and I want to dual boot Windows 8 with it. \nIs this possible? All tutorials I can find are for the other way around.\n\nA: There are many tutorials around, and indeed, most say you need to install Windows first. However, Windows 8 also has a bootloader that you can use. The problem is often that Windows doesn't recognize the Linux partition and ignores it in the bootloader, kicking you straight into Windows.\nLook here to see how to add Linux to the bootloader: https://superuser.com/questions/499617/how-can-i-add-linux-to-the-new-windows-8-boot-manager\n", "Q: How to recording movie from website (screen desktop and sound capture)?

How I can do this? I heard something about wubi, but I am not sure from whre to download it.\nThanks!\n\nA: I don't think you can do it without rebooting, as you have to boot into the live CD / USB, and then into the OS when complete.\nAlso, you probably want 14.04, it is the latest version (and in my opinion, it runs much faster).\nFirst download the lubuntu iso and also unetbootin, then use unetbootin to install it on a disk / USB / SD card.\nOnce complete, restart the computer with the USB in, and from the BIOS (F2 / Del / F12) choose removable media or similar.\nAs it is booting, choose install or try (double click on the desktop icon to install from the live version) and follow the simple instructions.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu gnome 14.04 I downloaded ISO file but when I try to boot from USB it says bootmgr is missing.

I am trying to install Matlab in my personal computer running Ubuntu 14.04. \nThe directory for installation is /usr/local/MATLAB/R2014a, on which I can get permissions using sudo when in the terminal. \nHowever, Matlab has its own installation process which runs a wizard on independent windows. \nWhen I follow the wizard, I am not able to get access to that installation directory. \nDoes anyone know how to get such permissions for the installation? \nThank you in advance. \n\nA: If you know the path of the folder, say /home/test_folder, then all you do is:\nsudo chmod -R 775 /home/test_folder\n\nAnd you get full read and write permissions!\nEDIT: the -R ensures recursive permission changes so be careful not to run this command on a folder that is high up on your system (as this could make EVERY folder read/write-able, prone to security issues).\n\nA: I had the same problem as you. What I did was reinstalling Matlab, but changing the username for root, so I could start MATLAB from terminal with root privileges. Then, I changed permissions to my MATLAB folder and childs (/usr/local/MATLAB), to 775. Now I'm able to install any adds-on when launching MATLAB with sudo.\n", "Q: No Dual-Boot Option after Installing Ubuntu 14.04 x64 I just finished installing Ubuntu 14.04 x64.  It's my first time with Ubuntu, so I accepted all the defaults and installed it next to Win8.1 x64 Enterprise.  When the installation finished, I rebooted, but I am now taken directly to Windows with no option for the alternate OS.  Windows Advanced Properties only lists Windows as an available OS.  How do I enable Ubuntu to boot?\n\nA: I guess, There is a problem with your grub. So you need to re-install grub. Check this for full detail about boot-repair. For you 1st Option will be useful. \nThe easiest way to use Boot-Repair is to burn one of the following disks and boot on it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot-Repair-Disk is a CD starting Boot-Repair automatically.\n\n*Boot-Repair is also included in Linux-Secure-Remix.\n\n\nRemark : you can also install the ISO on a live-USB (eg via UnetBootin or LiliUSB or Universal USB Installer).\n\nA: In the Windows boot-loader, you press F8 and it gives you options like safe mode (unless Windows 8 doesn't have that anymore). In the same menu you press Esc and it gives you the option to go into the Ubuntu boot-loader which is grub. Once you select the option press Enter and you will be in grub. In grub, select Ubuntu and Ubuntu will boot. Once there, go to Ubintu Software Center and install the program \"Grub Customizer\" (trust me it's a very good program worth installing). Then load the program after installing it, and it will scan all your operating systems. Configure the names of your OS's, and the General Settings. After you are done configuring, click \"Save\" and reboot. Once your computer down-booted, press DEL or F2 to enter BIOS and make the Ubuntu hard-drive primary boot so that it loads grub and if you want Windows in Primary boot just set as primary in Grub-customizer but still set Ubuntu as primary (if you have them on 2 different harddrives). Comment any questions, and ill help, I'll be on this site a while because I have a big problem with Ubuntu as well. Best of luck!\n\nA: Based on the Ubuntu installation documentation, this should have been taken care of automatically, but I had to use EasyBCD to add Ubuntu to my system HD's MBR.  Kind of surprising, considering Ubuntu's maturity.\n\nA: This problem is usually due to the way UEFI boot is configured in some BIOS. On many machines one has to select which OS to boot in the BIOS. Every BIOS is different.\nReboot your computer, enter the bios, and in the boot/UEFI section select Ubuntu rather then windows.\n", "Q: Windows 8.1 erased Ubuntu 14.04 partition I had Ubuntu 14.04 installed with a Windows 7 dual boot.

Has the partition been actually erased?\n\nA: I could recover all the data using testdisk utility from an Ubuntu live CD!\nIt seems that Windows damaged the hdd MBR and using this program I could inspect the real hdd contents and then re-write the MBR without problems and recovering the whole partition.\nTo install it just do a sudo apt-get install testdisk\n\nA: If GParted says the partition where Ubuntu once resided is empty then it is almost certainly erased.

For example, when he inter sudo su, The system tells him you can not access the root?\n\nA: By default, on Ubuntu, any Linux user which is member of the group sudo or admin is allowed to use sudo to run any commands as root on the system.\nBut this can be more complex than that.\nIn fact, the authorizations to use sudo are defined into the /etc/sudoers file. You must edit this file using the visudo command as root.\nThe default behaviour I've expressed at the beginning of this answer is represented by the line :\n\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nShort overview of this syntax :\n\n*\n\n*First ALL : indicate that members of this group can run sudo from any host\n\n*Second ALL : command will be run as the specified user (by default it is root) with sudo -u <username>\n\n*The third ALL (on the line with %sudo) specify that the group can also set when running sudo (sudo -g <group name>)\n\n*The last ALL indicate that any command present on the system can be run by the concerned users.\n\nTherefore, the syntax (see man visudo for more example) would allow you to specify restriction in a sense that :\n\n*\n\n*A given user is given sudo priviledge\n\n*A user or group may be restricted to use only some command\n\n*A user or group may be restricted to change to a specify user only\n\nRestrictive example :\n\noperator ALL=(root) /sbin/reboot\n\nwhich allows the user operator to run only the command /sbin/reboot as root.\n\nA: Open System Settings from an admin account.\nClick User Accounts, then the Unlock at the top corner. Enter your password.\nClick the account you wish to change, then click the word Administrator, next to Account Type.\nChange it to Standard, and they won't be able to use sudo or run any system changing programs, such as in Software Centre, they won't be able to install anything from it, just browse.\n", "Q: VMnet1 host only network adapter I need to copy the files from Windows to Ubuntu server and the server has only ssh client, no ssh server package installed. How can I do it?\n\nA: Well, this is a bit old-tech, but you could try sneaker-net, with a USB drive.\n\nA: You could install an ssh server on your windows and pull everything to Linux via scp (or sftp).\nYou can install an ftp server on windows and pull everything via ftp client.\nYou can set up an NFS or SMB share on Windows, and pull everything over on Linux.\nThere are plenty different options. You don't have to push it from Windows to Linux, you can also pull it with Linux from Windows.\nYou can write the data on USB, mount the USB in your VM and copy the files too.

I realize mint may not work once this is done, but I want to give it a shot.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you want to install Linux Mint again, from an ISO.\nYou can simply burn the ISO to a disc or thumb drive, boot to it, and install it wherever you like. You don't have to worry about booting into Xubuntu and you can even install it right over your non-working Mint installation, if you want.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Run script full screen in terminal How do I get a bash script to run in full screen when it's executed or how can I change the terminal size if I can't make it full screen?\n\nA: \"Fullscreen\" isn't a bash concept at all, it's down to your terminal emulator window and X.\nHowever if you're scripting, you can tell X to add a fullscreen hint to a client. I most applications this will work. I've tested with Terminator and I've no reason to suspect it won't work with Gnome Terminal:\n# set fullscreen on startup\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,fullscreen\n\n# ... do your stuff ...\n\n# and before you quit\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b remove,fullscreen\n\n\nWith regard to keeping this at a minimum footprint, the only way I've found to do this is to launch another terminal. Unfortunately lxterminal doesn't have a fullscreen launch option so you could either hack through the OpenBox settings (beurgh) or just fall back to xterm:\nxterm -fullscreen -hold -e ./anotherscript.sh\n\nYeah, I'm suggesting launching another terminal.

If you know nothing about under-display speakers this means that your model has 2.1 speaker configuration (front-edge speakers + subwoofer).\nUsing 5.1 configuration manual by StallionSA when you have a 2.1 will work but it will cause your system unable to produce any sound with some variety after auto-detect procedures (sometimes after reboot or after unplugging headphones). It occures since in 2.1 variant both 0x0d and 0x0f outputs are physically connected to the front speakers, thus interconnected.\nFor proper work of headphones and subwoofer at Dell Inspiron 17 R 7720 with 2.1 speaker configuration: \n\n\n*\n\n*You need to have alsa-tools & alsa-tools-gui installed, for example with a console command sudo apt-get install alsa-tools alsa-tools-gui\n\n*Open HDAJackRetask\n\n*Select the IDT 92HD91BXX codec\n\n*Check the \"Show unconnected pins\" box\na.

To fix no sound issue (totally mute system) restoring defaults permanently during reboot:\n\n\n*\n\n*click \"Remove boor override\" button\n\n*reboot your system\n\n\nc. To make subwoofer work (after your \"Pin configuration\" settings are back default)\n\n\n*\n\n*leave 0x0d at \"Internal speaker\" and check its \"Override\"\n\n*remap 0x10 to \"Internal speaker (LFE)\" and check its \"Override\"\n\n*click \"Apply now\"\n\n*click \"Install boot override\" button\n\n\n", "Q: Black Screen After Nvidia Driver 331.79 install All the other answers do not help, so I decided to do this.

I have successfully mounted them using the vboxsf from the Guest Additions installed.\nTo mount I used the command sudo mount -t vboxsf <dir name in vbox> <directory in linux for example I used sudo mount -t vboxsf Test /home/user/Test\nI found several ways of mounting the directories automatically upon startup using for example the /etc/rc.local method (here) where you modify said file appending the command to it (without sudo). Or by using the fstab method (here). I prefer the rc.local method personally.\nOnce mounted it has permissions dr-xr-xr-x however once mounted the directory is of root ownership and chown user /home/user/Test has no effect. This means I cannot make or change files in it as a normal user.\nIn the VirtualBox the directory to be shared is not set as read-only.\nIs there a way to automatically mount the shared folder and assign ownership to my non root user?\n\nA: If you have the guest additions installed, use the VirtualBox menu:\n\nDevices > Shared Folders...\n\nAdd the path, name and enable \"Auto-mount\" and \"Make permanent\" options.\nFinally add your user to the group with:\nsudo usermod -G vboxsf -a myusername\n\nLogout and back again or reboot the machine to complete the process (thanks @Fo).\nGroups are stored in /etc/group, according to the usermod man page.\n\nA: Ah the curse of writing a question and then finding the answer immediately after.\nI didn't use the full command suggested in this link\nsudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$UID,gid=$GID share ~/host\nSo to add ownership and automatically mount in virtualbox via vboxsf in Ubuntu add to the /etc/rc.local file before the exit 0 line the command as follows:\nmount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 <folder name given in VirtualBox> /home/<user>/where/ever/you/want\n\nA: Another alternative is to first configure the shared drives in Auto-mount mode like in the first part of @Katu's answer. This will allow to get the mount configurations of the shared drives by running mount. You'll get something like:\n$ mount\n...\nvbox-shared-dir on /media/sf_vbox-shared-dir type vboxsf (rw,nodev,relatime,iocharset=utf8,uid=0,gid=998,dmode=0770,fmode=0770,tag=VBoxAutomounter)...\n\nOne can then use this information to update /etc/fstab/ with an additional line, replacing UID and GID accordingly and removing the tag option:\nvbox-shared-dir   /media/sf_vbox-shared-dir  vboxsf rw,nodev,relatime,iocharset=utf8,uid=<UID>,gid=<GID>,dmode=0770,fmode=0770 0       0\n\nAfter this you should be able to mount the volume automatically running the command:\n# mount vbox-shared-dir\n\nThen you just need to remove the  Auto-mount option in the virtual box configuration because the volume gets mounted automatically during boot.\n", "Q: How to renable “never show” notifications in Xubuntu 14.04?

Previously, on my desktop computer running Ubuntu 14.04, I had 4GB RAM, which I thought should be plenty. However, after being on for a while, my computer would seem to get slow. I have a system resource monitor app in my Gnome panel, which I assume represents the available RAM (?). It shows a dark green area as being \"Memory\", and a light green area as \"Cache\". The \"Cache\" would slowly grow until it filled the whole graph, and then programs would get slow to load, or it would take a while to switch programs.\nI could alleviate the problem somewhat with this command, but eventually the computer cache fills up again, so it's only a bandaid:\nsudo sh -c \"sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\"\n\nSo, I figured I'd get more RAM, so I replaced one 2GB stick with an 8GB stick, and now I have 10 GB ram.\nAnd my \"cache\" still slowly maxes out and my computer slows as a result. Also, sometimes the computer starts out with \"cache\" maxed when I first boot and log in. Not always though, I don't know if there's a pattern that determines why it happens.\nWhy is Ubuntu using up so much cache? Is 10GB not enough for Ubuntu?\nHere's what my system monitor looks like in my Gnome panel. The middle square shows RAM usage. The light green area is the \"cache\":\n\nThis is my memory and swap history, which doesn't seem to include any information about \"cache\". I realize at this point I'm not totally clear on the difference between \"cache\" and \"swap\":\n\n\nA: You probably need to reduce your swappiness. \nThe kernel considers it better to use the free ram as cache rather then evict cache pages and have the ram marked as truly free. Growing the cache is generally a good thing.\nNow the question arises what to do when all the memory is allocated to cache and your application needs more memory. Often the right thing to do is to evict a page from the cache and hand it over to your app but occasionally it is beneficial to swap out a rarely used page, give that to your app and keep the cache intact.\nThis process is loosely controlled by /proc/sys/vm/swappiness. For more information please check the excellent answers to Why most people recommend to reduce swappiness to 10-20? and How do I configure swappiness?.\n\nA: \nAnd my \"cache\" still slowly maxes out and my computer slows as a result.\n\nYou'll need to look elsewhere for the cause of your slowdown; the memory described as “cache” is the memory that the kernel can freely throw away if anything else needs RAM. It's things like data recently read from the disc.\nThis, while quite old, is still a reasonable description of some of the moving parts in the memory subsystem. As it says,\n\nLinux has this basic rule: a page of free RAM is wasted RAM.\n\nNo matter how much RAM you have, your cache will grow to fill it. This is not a cause for concern. Far from it, it's a very significant performance optimisation - RAM is about 100 times faster than a fast SSD, so any time you don't have to read from disc is a huge win.\n\nA: Your system uses so much cache, because it's there for the taking, and can help it go faster.\nCaching in general is where we put a copy of something that is either slow to retrieve or slow to calculate somewhere that is faster to retrieve. A program might store the result of a calculation in memory, a web proxy might store a copy of a resource from the web on a machine on your LAN and, in this case, a system might store data from the hard drives in RAM (and some other data).\nAnd because it makes the system go faster, it makes logical sense to use every kilobyte that's not being used by something else. The options for a chunk of memory that nothing else is using are after all:\n                      |Use For Cache | Don't Use For Cache\n——————————————————————+——————————————+————————————————————\nData needed again     |Faster system | No difference\nData not needed again |No difference | No difference\n\nTherefore you should always use every bit of memory that's not doing anything for cache.\nA system that has 10% of the RAM in use for various things, and 90% of it in use for cache should not be thought of as \"maxing out\". It should be thought of as 10% in use, with another 90% free and therefore being used for cache while nothing needs it.\nHowever, if we consider swapping, this is almost the opposite of caching data from the disk in RAM: Where caching uses RAM to speed up I/O (and potentially other things), paging uses disk space to extend RAM.\nSo when the system has all its RAM being used, and it needs more, it has two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Throw away some of the cache, since it's only an optimisation after all.\n\n*Page out some RAM being used for something else.\n\n\nThere is no universal answer to just which of these is the best. The perfect answer depends on a bunch of things that can't be predicted, and even the best answer depends on a bunch of things that depend on your system set up and how you use it.\nNote that these opposite actions do make sense simultaneously: One is about prioritising slow-to-get information you are likely to need, the other is about de-prioritising information you aren't going to need soon.\n250MB isn't a lot, so I wouldn't be terribly worried, but for a high-RAM desktop system for interactive (rather than server) use, I might experiment with reducing swappiness, to change the balancing act here. This answer is very good on why it probably won't make much difference, but it's a reasonable thing to experiment with to see if it goes.\nYou've a much bigger problem to deal with first, which is that someone is running sudo sh -c \"sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\" on your machine every now and then, which clears out quick-to-access data from otherwise unused RAM and forces the system to recalculate or re-retrieve what it should be able to just grab from memory. That's going to make the system slower, and the RAM a waste of money.\n", "Q: Moving from Windows 8.1 to Ubuntu - what can I do to replace OneDrive?

I think the mistake I made was I started from a 12.04 install disk instead of the 12.10 disk I'd used previously and when given the option set my primary connection as ethernet (because the wireless option didn't work).\nAfter upgrading to 14.04 etc, I managed to get the wireless working, or more using steps like ifconfig -a and the likes I managed to prove that the wireless card etc. is all installed and working.\nHowever every time I boot without a hard wired connection plugged in I get the message \"waiting for network configuration\".\nI can then once it's booted without a network get my wirless working using\n\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\n  iwlist wlan0 scan\n\nThis seems to kick the wireless module into life and it appears in the GUI and I can then select a network, however all the options like edit network and disconnect etc are all greyed out.\nWhat I would like of course is if the WLAN0 was just set as my primary default network so I've been looking for a solution to this and it would seem that I need to adjust the old /etc/network/interfaces file but when I try to do so using the \n\nsudo vi /etc/network/interfaces \n\ncommand I, well I simply have no idea what I'm doing.

Windows is much harder to manage, and both use metrics (by increasing the cost to \"your\" least likely choice) to handle \"routing conflicts\" when the same destination can be from either device.

perfectly yesterday, and now today I can't log in.\nAt first, I was only getting a black screen. However, after following instructions in some questions here on AskUbuntu, I first reinstalled lightdm, and then I had to change the ownership of the file ~/.Xauthority to be my user name. Now, I get the log in GUI screen.\nHowever, once I enter my username, it flickers and then comes back to the login GUI. It does not matter if I use Gnome, Unity, or Gnome-Flashback.\nI don't know why lightdm needed to be reconfigured, or how ~/.Xauthority got changed, but in any case, what is still standing in my way, preventing me from logging in?\nUpdate: I have tried deleting the .Xauthority file, and the .profile files in my home directory.

My laptop is a Lenovo Thinkpad T410 and the Ubuntu 14.04 is a fresh install. So is this a kernel problem or my laptop wifi card problem ?\n\nA: Ubuntu is more than likely not the issue.  I have a Lenovo G580 running 14.04 and had the same issue.  I solved it by adding a Netgear usb wifi adapter.  Problem solved for my Lenovo.  The dropped connections occurred on both Windows and Ubuntu, before I added the Netgear adapter.\nADDITIONAL INFO\nTo check your reception quality you can create a script file running in a continuous loop.\nThe following script will yield, \"Link quality\" and \"Signal level\".  The signal level reads in a negative number mine shows \"-36\" on the lowest to \"-50\" highest.  Lowest number is best.  If you are reading -85 to -100 or more, this may be the source of your dropped connection.\nYou can run this test for yourself with the following script.\nOpen a terminal window Ctrl-alt-t.\ntouch  wlan0tst.sh\nchmod ugo+x\ngedit wlan0tst.sh\n\nEnter the following lines in the gedit window.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile :\ndo\n    /sbin/iwconfig wlan0 | grep Link | tr '\\n' '\\r'\ndone\n\nSave the file.

( remember manual\nentry of device details into an empty filter entry has not worked )\n\n\nDoes anyone know if this is an issue\n\n\n*\n\n*with VirtualBox?\n\n*with the current version of the VirtualBox extension pack?\n\n*or perhaps even with Trusty Tahr itself?\n\n\nI have full USB functionality on my 14.04 host.\n\nA: You probably have a permission issue. Add your user ID to group vboxusers with this command: sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers $USER, log off, log on and try again.\n\nA: I tried all of the above to no avail. I then tried a right mouse click over the USB filter area and found a menu choice \"Add filter from device\". Voila! It worked.\n\nA: I just spent last 6 hours trying to get my USB backup drive to work on my Ubuntu 14.04(host) with Win7Pro(guest).   Fortunately, I found one article from Tyler Durden(see link below) which mentioned incompatibility between older version of VirtualBox 4.3.10(downloaded from Ubuntu Software Center) and VirtualBox Extension Pack 4.3.14(downloaded from VirtualBox.org).\nAfter re-installing with the new version of VirtualBox, so far everything appears to be working fine,  YMMV.\nHow to set up USB for Virtualbox?\n", "Q: Is my gparted partition editor looking okey? So. I re-installed ubuntu and there were some things that shoud have been preinstalled but are not. One of them was Gparted. Here is a screenshot of my gparted. Is it okey, I'm in a bit of doubt.\n\n\nA: Yes, it is OK. You have two partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux main partition (root) which is /dev/sda1 formatted as ext4 and mounted as /.\n\n*the swap partition /dev/sda5.\n\n\nHowever because both the operating system and your files will be on the same partition, you'll lose all your data when you reinstall the OS. That's why is recommended to have a second partition mounted as /home.\n", "Q: Installing Authen::Simple::PAM module with cpan in ubuntu fails I'm trying to install the Authen::Simple::PAM module using cpan from ubuntu terminal and i get an error as shown below (note other modules install perfectly)\nChecking if your kit is complete...\nLooks good\nchecking for gcc... cc\nchecking for C compiler default output file name... a.out\nchecking whether the C compiler works... yes\nchecking whether we are cross compiling... no\nchecking for suffix of executables... \nchecking for suffix of object files... o\nchecking whether we are using the GNU C compiler... yes\nchecking whether cc accepts -g... yes\nchecking for cc option to accept ANSI C... none needed\nchecking how to run the C preprocessor... cc -E\nchecking for pam header files in... no\nconfigure: error: cannot find the pam_appl.h file\nError in configuring the Authen::PAM module.   \nWarning: No success on command[/usr/bin/perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=site]\nNIKIP/Authen-PAM-0.16.tar.gz\n/usr/bin/perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=site -- NOT OK\nRunning make test\nMake had some problems, won't test\nRunning make install\nMake had some problems, won't install\nCould not read metadata file.

After upgrading my pc to the current LTS release 14. 04, I found that I can't access novell shares using ncpfs any more. It seems that the ncp-related packages (libncp and so on) have been present in the 14.04 repos, but got removed: (see launchpad, ubuntuupdates and Debian Bug #712779).\nIs there still any way to install the ncp-related components?\nAre there any other tools to access or even mount a novell share from a 14.04 system?\nEDIT: Oddly enough, ncpfs and libncp are still available in the current LTS Version of Mint (Mint 17 \"Qiana\").\n\nA: Since the ncp-related packages are still part of the older releases, they're available after adding Saucy (universe!) as additional package source. Now, one can install them as usual (Version 2.2.6-9ubuntu1 seems to work fine with 14.04).\nYou can do this by opening Software & Updates in Ubuntu and enabling the universe repository, or you can edit /etc/apt/sources.list and add the following lines to the end of the file:\n# ncpfs\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy universe\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy universe\n\n\nA: Why is it removed ?!\nI think many people use it cause there is no Novell Client for Ubuntu.\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://se.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy universe multiverse\"\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install ncpfs\n\n", "Q: Adobe AIR install problem, Ubuntu x64 14.04 Haven't seen this kind of error on askubuntu yet.\nDid everything as it says here:\nHow can I install Adobe AIR?\nAfter sudo ./AdobeAIRInstaller.bin\nshows this image:\ndropbox.com/s/wg6cv03h5n1tqgr/adobe_air.png\nMeanwhile terminal shows a bunch of such messages:\n(setup:2579): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: \"murrine\",\n\nNothing is installed.

I have a strange problem. It just happen recently, when I accidentally unplug my headphone. But I unplugged it before and nothing happen. Basically now, when I use my headphone through front jack, when playing videos, I can't hear voice. Only background music. Using kde sound setup, pressing front left and front right test button, result in a mono sound. No distinction between right and left. This only happen with front jack. Rear jack is working fine. \n\nA: For me, I also had this problem when using my Apple 3.5mm headphone on Kubuntu, but when I held the volume up or down button, it had no effect on the actual volume, but my headphone had a sound. \nTo solve this problem, simply pull the plug a little and the sound will recover.\nProbably because the top connector is for controlling audio input, but the input and output on the motherboard are separate, so you can't insert the wrong interface if you want to use the output function normally. Of course, the input function is not available when the output function is used normally.\nForgive me for my poor English, good luck\n\nA: *\n\n*You can try to launch  \"pulseaudio volume control\" from multimedia  menu   then change profile in right tab (sound like you switch to a 5.1 profile)  . \n(if   \"pulseaudio volume control\" is not installed: sudo apt-get install pavucontrol)\n", "Q: Why doesn't \"cd\" work in a shell script? I just want to write a script which changes my directory.\nI put the below commands in the file /home/alex/pathABC\n#!/bin/sh\ncd /home/alex/Documents/A/B/C\necho HelloWorld\n\nI did \nchmod +x pathABC\n\nIn the Terminal, while in /home/alex, I ran ./pathABC, but the output is just HelloWorld and the current directory is not changed.\nSo what is wrong?\n\nA: You are making a thinking error. While the current shell stays in the same directory, the script has moved to the new directory.\nYou could see that by creating another script in the new directory, and running it from your script, after it has changed directory:\n#!/bin/sh\ncd /home/alex/Documents/A/B/C && ./another_script.sh # (if it is executable)\n\nThe second script would run from the new directory.\nHelloWorld \n\nis just the output of the script.\n\nA: Actually, I just found, after many searches, that if you need to change the directory, and still keep the same shell, so you will get all the answers in your current script, you can use:\n(cd your_dir; do_some_command_there)\n\nFor example, what I needed to use, was:\n(cd your_dir; git remote -v | wc -l)\n\nWorks like a charm!\n\nA: When you run script in a Terminal, a child process runs. In this child program i.e. your script will change to whatever directory specified. But in the parent process, i.e. where you run the script is still in the old path. \nOR simply we can say:\n\nThe scope of cd command is only for child process not parent.\n\n\nA: As others have explained, the directory is changed in the child process of your script, not in the terminal process from which the script is called. After the child process dies, you are back in the terminal which is left where it was.\nSeveral alternatives:\n1. Symbolic link\nPut a symlink in your home to the long path you want to easily access\n$ ln -s /home/alex/Documents/A/B/C ~/pathABC\n\nthen access the directory with:\n$ cd ~/pathABC\n\n2. Alias\nPut an alias in your ~/.bashrc:\nalias pathABC=\"cd /home/alex/Documents/A/B/C\"\n\n(from here)\n3. Function\nCreate a function that changes the directory, the function runs in the process of your terminal and can then change its directory.\n(from here)\n4. Avoid running as child\nSource your script instead of running it. Sourcing (done by . or source) causes the script to be executed in the same shell instead of running in its own subshell. \n$ . ./pathABC\n\n(from here and here)\n5. cd-able vars\nSet the cdable_vars option in your ~/.bashrc and create an environment variable to the directory:\nshopt -s cdable_vars\nexport pathABC=\"/home/alex/Documents/A/B/C\"\n\nThen you can use cd pathABC\n(from here)\n\nA: Trying to use cd inside the shell script does not work because the shell script runs in the subshell and once the script is over it returns to the parent shell, which is why the current directory does not change.\nTo achieve changing of the directory use sourcing.You can either use . scriptname.sh or source scriptname.sh command to use sourcing.\nNote : Also when you use sourcing do not use the exit command because it then closes your connection.\n\nA: Use $SHELL at the end\n\nA bash script operates on its current environment or on that of its\nchildren, but never on its parent environment.\n\nHowever, this question often gets asked because one wants to be left at a command prompt in a certain directory after execution of a script from within another directory.\nIf this is the case, simply execute a child $SHELL instance at the end of the script:\n# !/usr/bin/env bash\ncd /home/alex/Documents/A/B/C\necho -e '\\nHit [Ctrl]+[D] to exit this child shell.'\n$SHELL\n\nTo return to the previous, parental shell instance, use Ctrl+D.\n\nA: Because hello world is just a trace statement, let's try this:\nCreate bash script file cd.sh containing:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"/home/mike/Documents/A/B/C\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The .sh extension is an older convention of giving bash script filenames an extension. It's purely cosmetic and usually unnecessary. However in this case it's important to differentiate from the core cd command.\n\n\nMark the bash script file executable using:\nchmod a+x cd.sh\n\nNow run the file:\n$ cd $(./cd.sh)\nbash: cd: /home/alex/Documents/A/B/C: No such file or directory\n\n\n\n*\n\n*cd we all know.\n\n*$(...) executes command inside parenthesis and returns output.\n\n*If cd.sh was in your path you don't need to specify where it is. We prefix with ./ to specify the command is in the current directory.\n\n*The echo output from the cd.sh script is sent back to the parent via the $(...). The parent (our shell prompt) uses this output and passes it to the Linux cd command.\n\n\nAs others have mentioned a child process can't change the parent's directory. This is one way the child can tell the parent where to go after the process ends.\n\nA: CDPATH might help in some cases.\n# add this to .bashrc .zshrc or whatever\nexport CDPATH=\"/home/alex/Documents/A/B:$CDPATH\"\n\n# and then you can just do...\ncd C\n\nNote u have to add 'A/B' to CDPATH, not 'A/B/C'\nYou can add multiple paths to CDPATH just like PATH.\n", "Q: While installing, stays copying files, stuck!

After that you can boot from the USB and install it as a fresh installation. You can choose to upgrade the current system. If you are using the same architecture then it's fine.

Recently, an update that caused a problem with Gnome session caused me to lose a day's work. The solution was to rollback some packages to a previous version.\nThe update manager is now telling me that my old packages should be updated:\n\n... but I don't want to do that until I know that whatever bug or problem the latest version has is resolved.\nI understand that with any upgrade that there is a risk of instability. However, in the 8 years or more that I've been on Ubuntu, using the latest releases has been stable enough and with the benefit of the latest features and security. So, I'm not looking for general advice on how to handle upgrades.\nWhat I'm saying is that in this one particular instance, the bug introduced by these upgrades is severe and time wasting. But, as an end user, when I encounter a problem like this, I have no idea how to address a specific concern about a specific package. I don't, for example, know which of these packages is the problem, and I can't take time from my work schedule to be experimenting with each package.\nSo, my question is:\nHow do I find out who exactly is responsible for these, or any, packages so that I can contact them and let them know about the problem?\nHow do I freeze these packages only, but allow other upgrades to happen?\nubuntu-session\ngnome-session-common\ngnome-session-bin\ngnome-session\n\n\nA: You can prevent package to be udated by freezing them.\nYou do this like this :\necho \"<package name> hold\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\nYou can see the list of frozen package by doing this :\ndpkg --get-selections|grep hold\n\n\nA: As it's been said in the comments, you can never know when it's \"safe\" to update packages. Introducing new software ALWAYS has the possibility of ruining your environment.\nThis is why IT departments in companies use test environments and try out updates on similar machines before deploying them to their production machines (at least, any self-respecting admin would do so). You can use virtual machines as well, but that doesn't necessarily allow you to test anything related to the hardware or gui (i.e. your gnome problem), just core services.\nIf you don't have the luxury of a test environment, you can be a little more sure about the updates if you don't enable automatic updates (or checking for updates), and manually check if there are updates available and browse the web to see if there are any bugs reported with the updates. In that case, always lag a couple days/weeks behind the updates (unless there's a huge security risk).\nMy personal experience though, is that software these days is tested as good as possible before it's rolled out, and if you want to take the manual way of checking everything before installing, you'll be spending A LOT more time than you would on the occasional hiccup. And indeed, if you have experienced problems, if you want to protect yourself from doing a days work to recover, you should install some snapshot technology (e.g. btrfs) which allows you to revert quickly.\nSo everything in a nutshell, there is no answer to your request, only guidelines on how to deal with reality. You have to make up your own mind to see what works best for you.\n", "Q: Torrent applications getting slow download speed? Allowed port in iptables with this command sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6881 -j ACCEPT.\nAfter ran this command, Transmission client port shows open but in next 30 seconds it's shows closed.\nIs there any option to allow port to particular application?\n\nA: I have had similar experience with Transmission, plus I think that Transmission doesn't offer a whole lot of options to configure the client... \nSo I replaced it with utorrent for Linux (http://www.howopensource.com/2011/08/install-utorrent-in-ubuntu-fedora/). I'm a happy camper ever since. You could give it a try if you're not desperately fixed on using Transmission as your torrent client.\nIf you're familiar with the Windows version of uTorrent, you won't quite get the same, be warned! Instead, a utorrent daemon is loaded that you can access via your browser. You have a lot of the same options in Linux, but not quite the same amount. The nice thing about it though, is that it's completely ad free (or is it my ad block that kills the ads?).\nIn any case, the utorrent daemon seems to run a lot smoother than the transmission client that comes as a default with Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Files deleted using Linux still show up in Windows I use Ubuntu and Windows 7 as dual boot. \nI deleted a video from the Downloads folder in C drive while using my Ubuntu OS. I simply selected the video and did a Shift+Delete. When I switch to Windows, the file still shows up, although it gives an error while trying to open. \nWhat went wrong while deleting the file in Ubuntu?\nCan I fix this and make the icon disappear in Windows using Ubuntu?\n\nA: This looks like a corrupted filesystem to me. Try chkdsk on Windows or fsck on Linux to check your file system and fix any possible corruption.\nI don't think trash is the issue here. Both Ubuntu and Windows have this mechanism, with a similar concept – when “deleting” a file from the file manager, it is simply moved to a special folder instead of being deleted, and some metadata (original location and deletion date) is stored in a database. However, the implementations differ, so files moved to Trash under Ubuntu would not appear in the Windows Recycle Bin and vice versa. However, since files are moved, either way of deleting them will cause them to disappear from its original location.\nNote that if you delete a file in another way than through the file manager, the trash folder may not be used and the file actually gets deleted.\n\nA: They might still show up because they're in Ubuntu's trash bin. Try emptying your trash bin in Ubuntu with the C: disk mounted. \n", "Q: 14.04 - gnome forgets disabled keyboard shortcuts after boot. Is there a workaround?

So the question is how much secure a ubuntu system is without any supportive anti-virus and other security software's.\nWhat packages are preferred to be used with ubuntu for secure computing??\nI am emphasizing on how much secure is Ubuntu from penetration point of veiw..and if it is so much immune then how does it do so...or if it is not immune which packages are preffered to be used to make it more secure to any penetration attempt??\n\nA: To start off, no system is 100 % secure. Even if you're running Linux, something can go wrong.  If you want 100% security, turn off your system.  In my opinion you don't need anti-virus software in Ubuntu, because a virus can't harm Linux, mainly because in order to install itself or infect your computer, a virus needs your password. Plus the fact that, you generally install software from secured repositories.\nIf you need security, a firewall is already installed by default. It's called Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW).\nSecurity vulnerabilities can show up in any OS. Ubuntu automatically performs a daily check for available security updates. As long as these security updates are applied immediately, your system will be OK.  \nUbuntu automatically performs a daily check for available security updates.  As long as these vulnerabilities are discovered quickly and repaired in a timley fashion, it won't cause an issue. \nExtra measures that you can use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you use a strong password\n\n*Protect confidential information, by storing it offline\n\n*Be wary of suspicious e-mails\n\n*Back up your data … and make sure you can restore it\n\n*Protect information in all its forms\nExtra Reading\n\nA: I have never used an anti-virus in six years of using Linux (Ubuntu for most of that time). I think it's quite reasonable to say you'll be fine without one.\nIf you'd like one to, for example, scan files you're about to send to or have received from a Windows machine, ClamAV runs on Ubuntu and is very easy to use.\nWith regard to firewalls, the default tool is ufw (\"uncomplicated firewall\"). You can read a little more about it here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW\n\nA: I feel like I've enumerated this a hundred times or more but Ubuntu isn't \"immune\".\nLike a lot of Linux distributions, we have features that people read too much into:\n\n*\n\n*Nice maintained repos (but how do we know they're virus free?)\n\n*By default we run unprivileged (Windows does too)\n\n*Open source mean that anybody can audit the code and submit their patches (but do they?)\n\n*Ubuntu doesn't run that many services by default\n\n*AppArmor does limit the range of some applications\n\nAnd as soon as you add a user, all bets are off.\n\n*\n\n*Users add things from PPAs without looking at where they come from.\n\n\n*Users download .deb installers because they've got two decades of experience downloading .exe files. These can be scripted to run anything and they run it as root.\n\n\n*Users will run almost any scripting you give them if they think it'll help their problem and you can very curtly (and opaquely) script almost anything in Ubuntu by default.\n\n\n*User view dodgy websites not knowing that their browser and Flash is just as exploitable as Windows users' browsers with Flash. There's a reason pwn2own entrants always go for the browser — it's a weak point.\n\n\n*Users install a SSH server with an account that has a weak password (ie any password, use keys kids). Tips for securing SSH.\n\n\n*Users install other services that shouldn't be web-accessible and don't use a firewall. Before they know it, their weak MySQL password is cracked or their webserver is exploited because they don't update it nearly often enough.\n\n\n*Users dump whatever version of generic PHP script on their LAMP install and never update it.\nThe only thing that actually works in our favour is that desktop users are currently a target so small that it's not worth attacking... But that could change at any moment. Servers have been being hacked for years but again, this is mostly down to poor administration.\nSo many people think they can create an Ubuntu server, stick their PHP app on its and don't need to do anything with it. They all get hacked.\nAnd in terms of physical security, Ubuntu is pretty weak. Reboot to root console and you have everything. This can be disabled but it's not the default.\n", "Q: C++ system() function for further arguments in ubuntu I didn't really know how to even look for the solution for this one.

Everything has gone great except that I get screen tearing on anything that goes fullscreen. I've searched around and tried loads of different solutions but none have worked. My GFX card is a nVidia GT 650M, I hope someone has a solution.\n\nA: Screen tearing is a very annoying problem and can be caused by different things.\nCheck if your vsync is enabled and check whether your monitor's refresh frequency is set to the same value as the software value.\nA quick search online shows that the NVidia 650 has this problem for quite a few people. I advise you to search around and see what works for you. Different people report different methods of dealing with it.\nIt greatly depends on the vendor of the GPU, what other hardware, drivers and settings you are using.\n\nA: First install CompizConfig-Settings-Manager by\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nOpen CompizConfig-Settings-Manager find Composite and check it. Now Click Composite and uncheck the box of Unredirect Fullscreen Windows.\nClose CompizConfig-Settings-Manager.\n\nA: If you are still having the issues with video tearing using your Nvidia card you can run the following in a terminal:\n nvidia-settings --assign CurrentMetaMode=\"nvidia-auto-select +0+0 { ForceFullCompositionPipeline = On }\"\nWorked great on a few of my machines running on Ubuntu 16.04.\nAssuming you are using one video card, Alternatively you can try this config file edit in the file located at:  /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nSection \"Device\"\nIdentifier \"Device0\"\nDriver \"nvidia\"\nVendorName \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\nBoardName \"GeForce GTX 650\"\nOption \"RegistryDwords\" \"PerfLevelSrc=0x2222\"\nOption \"TripleBuffer\" \"True\"\nEndSection\nYou can change the performance level value to \"PerfLevelSrc=0x2233\" if your video card does not like the full performance setting above.\n\nA: This may Also help...\n  Do a complete removal of existing Nvidia drivers and Config's.\nI use Terminal booting to the grub recover option in the boot menu.

First the 64-bit version. It went all fine until I was asked how I wanted it installed. I chose alongside Windows 7, and it asked me to remove the installation device and press Enter. I removed the DVD, pressed Enter, and the computer rebooted, but with Windows. Nothing else happened, I could just use Windows as normal, or try again. Any idea how to fix this?\nI then tried with the 32-bit version (I also have a 32-bit version of Windows 7). This one does not provide the option to install alongside Windows 7. This is strange, because I previously did it, and I'm just trying to re-install it after I restored my computer to factory settings. Is it possible that the partition for Linux is still on my drive? How can I assign it again and increase its size. If not, any idea on how to solve this is very welcome!\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: When you are installing Linux, you have to make sure that your OS is properly SHUT DOWN, so don't suspend or do anything else. If your Windows is in suspended mode, Ubuntu will see the Windows partition (usually the first partition on your drive, where your MBR is stored)  as being mounted, and unless you force the unmount (you could cause problems with your Windows doing this), the ubuntu installer won't have access to write to your MBR and install the boot loader properly.\nYou can still use your Windows' bootloader and configure it to show you your Linux partition. I would advise to use Windows' native bootloader, but in case you're not familiar with it, you could give https://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/ a try.\n", "Q: switch between file tabs in geany open some files with geany how to switch between tabs by key switch?For example you open file1 and file2 and file3 with geany .

I'm doing this under Ubuntu 14.04 and very happy with it. \nThe utility downloads the files and saves them with the following name scheme: \nTITLE(artist-track)-ID.mp3\n\nSo an actual filename looks like:\nEPIC RAP BATTLE of MANLINESS-_EzDRpkfaO4.mp3\n\nSome other file names in the folder look like:\nEPIC RAP BATTLE of MANLINESS-_EzDRpkfaO4.mp3\nMartin Garrix - Animals (Official Video)-gCYcHz2k5x0.mp3\nStromae - Papaoutai-oiKj0Z_Xnjc.mp3\n\nAt first, this was no problem. It didn't bother me while listening to my music in Rhytmbox.\nBut when moving to phone or other devices it is pretty confusing to see a so long name, and some players, like the Samsung ones, treat that last part (id after second dash) of the name as Album or something.\nI'd like to create a bash script that removes what's after the second dash in the name for all files, so it'll make them like this:\nFrom: Martin Garrix - Animals (Official Video)-gCYcHz2k5x0.mp3\nTo: Martin Garrix - Animals (Official Video).mp3\nIs it also possible to instruct youtube-dl to exclude the ID from now on?\nI am currently downloading with the command:\nyoutube-dl --extract-audio --audio-quality 0 --audio-format mp3 URL\n\n\nA: sed can accomplish this in a single line, albeit in a rather convoluted way.\nls | sed 's/\\(.*\\)\\(-.*\\)/mv \\\"&\\\" \\\"\\1.mp3\\\"/' | bash\n\nThis first lists the files in the current directory (assuming all the files you want to rename are in the current directory), and then uses sed's s/regex/replacement command to generate a sensible mv command which is then piped to bash which executes it. This assumes all of your files are something of the form \"A-C.mp3\" or \"A - B-C.mp3\". Here is how it works:\nThe regex part of the sed command is \n\\(.*\\)\\(-.*\\)\n\nthis \"groups\" the name into two groupings (delimited with escaped parentheses): one matching \".*\" (any number of any character) and another matching \"-.*\", a dash followed by any number of any character. Notice that this matches the entire filename (in two groups). Also note that since \"greedy\" regex is used, the first group will match \"A\" in \"A-C.mp3\" and \"A - B\", not just \"A \", in \"A - B-C.mp3\", as wanted.\nThe replacement part of the sed command is\nmv \\\"&\\\" \\\"\\1.mp3\\\"/\n\nNote that an & character instructs sed to insert the entire pattern that matched regex, in this case that is the entire filename, and the \\1 instructs sed to insert the part of the filename that matched the first grouping \".*\". These two are combined with an preceding mv and a trailing .mp3, with escaped quotation marks to produce a sensible rename command. For example, for \"A - B-C.mp3\", the full sed command will produce:\nmv \"A - B-C.mp3\" \"A - B.mp3\"\n\nAnd finally all of this is piped to bash, which happily executes the mv (rename) command.\n\nA: You can check it with this command: \nfor i in *.mp3; do echo \"$(echo $i|cut -d- -f1,2).mp3\"; done\n\nNote that you do have file names without 2 dashes, so it won't work for everything.\nIf you actually want to change the names, \nfor i in *.mp3\ndo\n  newname=\"$(echo $i|cut -d- -f1,2).mp3\";\n  mv $i $newname\ndone\n\n\nA: I would use the Perl-based rename command - for example, to remove the shortest sequence of word-characters starting with - ahead of the .mp3 suffix, you could try\nrename -nv -- 's/-\\w+?[.]mp3$/.mp3/' *.mp3\n\nThe n option runs the command in 'dry run' mode - if the matches appear correct, remove the n option and run it again.\n\nA: The part you don't want is the video id. You can use youtube-dl's output template functionality:\n--output \"%(title)s\"\n\nthis will use only the title and omit the id. Run youtube-dl with no parameters to see other options.\nYou can fix your existing downloads:\nfor i in *; do mv \"$i\" `basename \"$i\" .mp3 | cut -f -2 -d \"-\"`.mp3; done\n\n(This is equivalent to Jakke's answer).\n\nA: A solution using only the shell:\nfilename=foo-bar-baz\n\nwhile read -rd-; do\n    newname=\"${newname:+$newname-}$REPLY\"\ndone <<< \"$filename\"\n\nmv \"$filename\" \"$newname\"\n\nThis works because the file name doesn't end with a dash, so the last token is ignored.\n", "Q: Will removing Nvidia Drivers cause any harm?

On the Wikipedia's article (Computer terminal) under the hard copy terminals section of the article it says this \"Early user terminals connected to computers were electromechanical teleprinters or teletypewriters (TeleTYpewriter, TTY)...\" \nSo does TTY stand for teletypewriters?  But it doesn't make any sense for me because I have never seen it and have no idea what \"tele\" means.\n\nA: Yes, the origin of TTY in Unix is from teletypewriter. The tele in telephone, teletypewriter, etc comes from a Greek root meaning far or distant. tele + phon (sound) = Speaking at a distance and so on.\nTimeshare systems (pre-Unix) developed physical terminals that allowed you to interact with (share) the computer during your scheduled time. These terminals meant you did not have to be physically in front of the computer to use it. You could also send output to a teletypewriter, that would print the output at that location. \nThis was the existing physical infrastructure when Unix was developed, so it was natural to use it for Unix networking. Emulation in virtual or software terminals of the features in physical terminals prevented older code or network infrastructure from breaking. \nIt's this origin in physical terminals (and ultimately the machines origins in the telgraph (distant writing) system and their use of control codes that accounts for certain terminal standards today. These include the standard 80 character width  and the carriage return and linefeed codes.\n\nA: Early user terminals connected to computers were electromechanical teleprinters or teletypewriters (TeleTYpewriter, TTY), and since then TTY has continued to be used as the name for the text-only console although now this text-only console is a virtual console not a physical console. \nThere are 6 virtual consoles in Ubuntu accessed by the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Alt+F1 to Ctrl+Alt+F6. You can move away from a virtual console (move the console to the background) by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F7.  \nIn Ubuntu 17.10 the login screen now uses virtual terminal 1. In Ubuntu 17.10 and later press Ctrl+Alt+F3 up to Ctrl+Alt+F6 for accessing a virtual console and press Ctrl+Alt+F2 to go back to the desktop environment.\n\nUbuntu 18.04 virtual console \n\nA: The first printing telegraph machine was patented in 1846.  Various companies continued developing them, and the word \"Teletype\" was first trademarked in 1921. One of these companies changed its name to the Teletype Corporation in 1928 and was acquired by AT&T in 1930. (Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter)\nSo these machines had seen almost 100 years of development before the first computers, and were the obvious choice for a human-interface device. There were more expensive terminals, but Teletypes were usually the cheapest and most reliable choices.  AT&T/Bell Labs owned Teletype corporation when Unix was first developed, and the Digital Equipment computers it was developed on included Teletype 33ASR terminals as standard equipment. TTY was the device name for terminals on the PDP-7 and PDP-11 that Unix originated on, it probably went back to the PDP-1 and who knows what before that.  So when they started working on a terminal device handler for Unix, why would they use anything else?\nI was confused when I first learned that MSDOS used COM: as the device name for serial ports.  I thought TTY was handed down from the ancients, this is heresy!\n\nA: This is a teletype writer:\n\nPressing a key sends a character down the serial link. Incoming characters on the serial link are printed on the printer. So when you type ls, you get a hardcopy of the file listing.\n(from http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~djg11/howcomputerswork/)\n\nA: In the later days of the teletypes, it was adopted by the deaf community as a form of communications.  Officially called TDD (Telephone Device for the Deaf) with the development & refinement of equipment that used the same communication media of Baudot and Ascii, it was widely adopted by the deaf to sign \"TTY\" because it's easier to sign than than \"TDD\".  Nowdays, it's fast becoming ancient as deaf people use video relays to communicate.  TTY/TDD's are mainly found in public settings at airports, government agencies, public venues, etc. that are hardly used due to the proliferation of wireless devices.\n\nA: So, back in the day. Computers where hooked up via serial connection to the Teletype you mention. They were essentially matrix printers. You can look on youtube and see how they work. To maintain legacy code, each terminal or UI window you have gets liked to a tty device under /dev. \nNothing but semantics. \n\nA: Some of us want a one sentence answer:\n\nis this just a fancy name for saying \"I am using the terminal\" or tty = the \"the process associated to the terminal process that exchanges information with the system and you\"\n\nI like the visual analogy here: https://askubuntu.com/a/482244/230288 you can see how the type writer is the physical process that gives the info you type to the system and the paper displays the response from the system. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n", "Q: How to Find from which folder my PC is taking regular backup via rsnapshot We are taking daily incremental backup from our main office in New Jersy.For that we are using rsnapshot & we have generated authentication key so that we don't need any daily password authentication. Now My question is How can I know from which folder it is taking daily backup to my PC.\nP.S : I am using ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32-bit\nPlease give me direct & simple answer because I am new for Ubuntu\n\nA: Only you can answer this as when you configured rsnapshot you should have specified the directories/folders that you wanted to back up and where you wanted them placed onto your computer.\nPerhaps you have not really understood the way rsnapshot works?\nHere is an (simple) example config that may help:\nbackup  remoteuser@newjerseyserver:/etc/ newjersey/\n\nThe above config is backing up the /etc directory on the remote server newjersey to your local computer's rsnapshot_root defined area in a directory named newjersey.\nYou would have specified the rsnapshot_root area in your /etc/rsnapshot.conf file - as an example if it was set to /rsnapshots/ then the newjersey etc directory would be seen on your local computer in /rsnapshots/hourly.0/newjersey/etc based on you using an hourly rsnapshot.\nIf the above is making no sense at all, then google for \"rsnapshot tutorial\" and read the many sites with articles on rnsapshot with screenshots etc... it will make things clearer. \n", "Q: Apache(2.4.7) LDAP URL authentication on ubuntu 14.04 The following LDAP URL authentication is NOT working for mediawiki on ubuntu 14.04 LTS server, which is working on ubuntu 9.10 server.\ncat /etc/apache2/sites-available/global.conf\n<Directory /mediawiki>\n        Options +FollowSymLinks\n        AllowOverride all\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n\n\nAuthType Basic\n            AuthName \"Web Site Authentication: Login with your user id\"\n            AuthBasicProvider ldap\n            #AuthzLDAPAuthoritative on\n            AuthLDAPURL \"ldap://192.168.1.3:389/dc=mydomain,dc=net?uid\"\n            AuthLDAPBindDN \"cn=admin,dc=mydomain,dc=net\"\n            AuthLDAPBindPassword secret\n            Require valid-user\n</Directory>\n\nNot working in the sense it's not prompting for authentication at all, just allows to access. No errors. There are many changes in Ubuntu 14.04, such as web root directory changed to /var/www/html in apache 2.4, AuthzLDAPAuthoritative is deprecated(that's why commented)....\nIf I paste the same code in 000-defaults replacing /mediawiki with /var/www/html then it prompts for authentication for accessing http://192.168.1.3. But no effect for http://192.168.1.3/mediawiki\nAm I missing anything in apache 2.4.7?. I'm confused, anybody has any idea?\n\nA: According to Apache documentation:\n\"Directory-path is either the full path to a directory, or a wild-card string using Unix shell-style matching. In a wild-card string, ? matches any single character, and * matches any sequences of characters.\"\nIf mediawiki directory full path is /var/www/html/mediawiki try:\n  <Directory /var/www/html/mediawiki>  \n\nIf not, verify if you have forgot .htaccess file \n", "Q: Ubuntu installation does not start I am trying to install Ubuntu on my old laptop (Celeron 1.7, 1Mb RAM) from a CD/DVD. I downloaded an older distribution with no PAE (I have already tried 9.04 and 10.4). \nBoth downloads freeze when I start the very first step of the installation - when I click on Install Ubuntu /Install Ubuntu desktop (whatever is after the language selection) - installation just freezes with dash/underscore on the screen.\nI have already done the checksum for both downloads (they are ok), performed the memory test (it is also ok). Disk check freezes the system too, but I dbl checked the hdd on another Ubuntu pc and it returned no errors. Installation also freezes at the same stage when I completely remove hdd...\nWhat could possibly be wrong and any solution to this?\nThanks!\n\nYes, thank you the memory is  1Gb!\n\nA: I found what was the problem - both distros were conflicting with a new usb hub I used to connect the keyboard and the mouse to the notebook.

There is no file /etc/X11/xorg/conf.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Going into CompizConfig Settings Manager, Window Management and ticking the box next to Resize Window solved my problem. It is confusing, that resizing windows is not enabled by default. \n", "Q: Copy the Windows 7 files to Ubuntu 14.04 I was working in the Windows 7 OS previously, now i shifted to the ubuntu 14.04 version. I had important file on D && E drive of Windows 7 which i couldn't take backup. How to recover those data in Ubutnu?\n(I had choose the only ubuntu option while installing the ubuntu)\n\nA: If you chose the Delete Windows option, then there is no way to recover your files (if the files were in the same partition as the Windows install).\nIf you backed up the files to another partition/drive, then you can open them with Ubuntu's file manager by selecting where it is.\n", "Q: MySQL takes ages to load (only when using WP) I'm not sure what's happening but it's since a while that I'm experiencing using my dev site (running on a VM) on the local Ubuntu machine. \nThe site runs on a Wordpress instance using MySQL setup to use innodb table on a separate folder. \nI don't have permission problems, as far as I know. \nIt I try to use MySQL CLI I can query the database without problems; the same using phpmyadmin.\nBut when it comes to access via the site it takes ages and more often than not I need to stop the service.\nAnd that's again another symptom something doesn't work as it should.\nStopping the service via sudo service mysql stop I can see it immediately stops (phpmyadmin can't log in anymore) but the command line prompt keep on hold like it is working.\nThe only way I have to get the CLI ready is to brutally stop the service with a CTRL+C.\nAny idea of what's wrong?\nThanks \n\nA: You can see if this is a MySQL issue by running (swap the caps out for your runtime variables):\nmysql -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD DATABASE \"show processlist;\"\n\n...while actioning a request. It'll show you the running-at-that-time queries along with how long they've taken. If you have a particularly slow query, it'll be in there. If that's too quick, there are methods of logging queries.\nIt could also be Wordpress (or your theme, or whatever) hammering the database with small queries. As somebody who builds online systems I'm perfectly qualified to let you in on a secret: Wordpress sucks. Oh okay, that's not a secret. You need to do a lot to make it perform well. To set you off in the right direction (assuming it's not a poorly written template): caching plugins!\nIn the same vein, watch htop while making requests. PHP+Wordpress will likely monster through a huge chunk of CPU to generate the page. It could just be that which is taking so long. If you can't fix it with caching (and you're on a 64bit computer) you could try HHVM (the almost-drop-in replacement for PHP-CGI from Facebook). It's much, much faster but needs installing. It's not as simple as apt-get install lamp-server^.\nAnd finally, it does sound like it could be a DNS issue. If you're specifying a domain name as your database address and its resolution is taking forever (or worse, failing half the time), that's going to stuff up a connection. Switch it to an IP (127.0.0.1 if it's local) and try again.\n\nA: As suggested from @Oli in the other other it was a matter of DNS and name resolution. However, it was not in the same direction as he suggested. \nIt turned out to be that MySQL was trying to do IP resolution on each call, causing a DNS lookup. Because the db server is internal and had no connection to the outside world, the lookup would eventually timeout.\nI resolved the problem by adding the skip-name-resolve directive in the my.conf SQL configuration file located beneath /etc/mysql of my VM.\nNow my local WP rocks.\n", "Q: Brightness not changing Dell 15r SE and ubuntu 12.04 With my current laptop I can't change my brightness anymore\nI tried xbacklight -set 50 (nothing happened)\nand also changed this line\n\ngrub_cmdline_linux_default= \"quiet splash\" \n\nto\n\ngrub_cmdline_linux_default= \"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nand updated the grub but still it didn't solve the problem.\nIs there a solution to this?\n\nA: Put this in your .bashrc:\nalias screen='xrandr --output LVDS1 --brightness $1'\n\nThan you can enter\nscreen 0.9\n\nAnd the brightness changes.\n", "Q: PPA with latest PHP 5.3.x branch for 12.04 Is there a PHP 5.3.x PPA for 12.04?\n\nA: There are several PPA s with PHP 5.3.X for Ubuntu 12.04.\n\n\n*\n\n*ppa:sjinks/x3m\n\n*ppa:team-mayhem/ppa\n\n*ppa:rip84/php5\n\n*ppa:skettler/php\n", "Q: When will ubuntu fully support high resolution displays I've tried tinkering with font sizes in the unity-tweak-tool and changing the scale in the display but have been unable to find a workable solution.\nWill there be proper support for this in the future? If so when can I expect it? I'd love to start using ubuntu again. \n\nA: Unity, the default desktop for Ubuntu, does not have much option for scaling displays. Since 14.04 however, you should be able to adjust the scaling of the launcher and panel in Settings:\n\nIn the 'Apperance' settings as well, you can change the icon size in the launcher.\nYou may also want to try Gnome shell, as that has had support for high-res displays since 3.10.

I just realized that one of my production machines has :\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-proposed main restricted universe multiverse\n\nenabled inside its apt-get sources.list.  luckily this is just a cloud based load balancer..\nis it safe to remove this line from sources.list? if a \"beta\" (or \"proposed\" update) is overwritten by a stable release in the future, does anybody see potential issues that could arise in such a scenario? \nif all I face is a potential \"downgrade\" to a stable release, this is not a problem.\nthanks!\n\nA: Yes, it is safe to remove the -proposed pocket.\nBy default, apt won't downgrade your packages. However, when there is a newer version in any other pocket/repo, apt will upgrade the package to that version.\nAs it is, -proposed has a lower priority than the other pockets (-proposed has a priority of 400, while most other things have a priority of 500), so I believe you would have to explicitly request a package from this pocket for -apt to use this pocket.\nEDIT: The -proposed pocket is not by default a lesser priority than the other pockets (see here on setting it as a lower priority). Therefore, if you enabled -proposed, your packages will be from this pocket.\n", "Q: MAAS: Unable to start \"Commisioned\" nodes I am having problems while trying to start my first node using KVM (QEMU 2.0.0) and MAAS.

Then you will need to add a Power address and Power ID.  The power address is the command to start the vm \"qemu:///system on a local machine.  The Power ID is the name of the vm.\n\nA: It's probably that you don't have an ssh key associated with the user yet.\nClick the user name in the upper right, click preferences, add an ssh public key, then you should be able to start it.\nBTW, if you \"hover\" over the start button on the node details page, I think it gives you this information.\n", "Q: I can't log into my ubuntu 12.04 When I try to log in on my Ubuntu 12.04 it goes to a black screen ( of logging in checking stuff ), and says Checking battery   -----     [ok] ( I'm using a computer instead of a laptop ) and just goes back to the login screen.\n\nTwo days before I executed the command sudo startx trying to start KDE, but it didn't work.

It essentially tells pulseaudio to load reload it's list of bluetooth devices.\n\nA: Extending upon Mark's answer, which basically did the trick for me.\nThe problem is that the bluetooth service tries to load the pulseaudio bluetooth module at startup, which fails because they require X11 to be running. You need to change the configuration so that the pulseaudio bluetooth module is loaded after X11. \n\n\n*\n\n*Tell the bluetooth service to not load the module. To do this, edit /etc/pulse/default.pa and comment out these lines by putting # characters in front of them:\n.ifexists module-bluetooth-discover.so\nload-module module-bluetooth-discover\n.endif\n\n\n*Configure the module to be loaded after X11. To do this, edit /usr/bin/start-pulseaudio-x11 and add two lines:\nif [ x\"$DISPLAY\" != x ] ; then\n    # ...\n\n    # Add these lines:\n    /usr/bin/pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n    /usr/bin/pactl load-module module-switch-on-connect\nfi\n\n\n*Restart pulseaudio and bluetooh. Either reboot your machine or use the following commands:\npulseaudio -k\nstart-pulseaudio-x11\nsudo service bluetooth restart\n\nThis way, the pulseaudio bluetooth module should be working and Volume Control (pavucontrol) should detect the bluetooth device and list it under input and output devices.\n\nA: The headset is properly paired and shows under Bluetooth Devices but it does not show as an available INPUT / OUTPUT source for audio.\nThe problem is that the pulseaudio bluetooth module is loaded before X11, changing a couple of config files do the trick:\nPulseAudio can not load bluetooth module 15.10/16.04\nnano /etc/pulse/default.pa\nComment out the following lines:\n#.ifexists module-bluetooth-discover.so\n#load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n#.endif\n\nnano /usr/bin/start-pulseaudio-x11\nFind the following lines and add after them:\nif [ x”$SESSION_MANAGER” != x ] ; then\n/usr/bin/pactl load-module module-x11-xsmp “display=$DISPLAY session_manager=$SESSION_MANAGER” > /dev/null\nfi\n\n\nAdd the following lines:\n\n/usr/bin/pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n/usr/bin/pactl load-module module-switch-on-connect\n\nThis way the Pulse audio’s Bluetooth modules will not be downloaded at boot time but after x11 is started.\n\nA: I had the same problem on Ubuntu 20.04 with my Pixus Bluetooth headphones.\nThe ubuntu Bluetooth manager saw the headphones and correctly connected them, but ALSA didn't see them.\nYou can check the list of Bluetooth devices by command\nbluetoothctl devices\n\nand you can check what outputs ALSA has by command\npactl list sinks short\n\nThe solution that I found is to set option ControllerMode to bredr in file /etc/bluetooth/main.conf\n# Restricts all controllers to the specified transport.
